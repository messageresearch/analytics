something it's out there somewhere yeah amen praise the Lord just proves there's more of him for us wow Jesus thank you Lord amen we'll go the Lord in prayer now take up their prayer requests the only requests I have gotten this morning is uh sister Norma sent me a text earlier for her Aunt Wanda uh she has cancer and she's and she heard her with her back she hurt her back she's having a hard time right now so please remember sister Norma's Aunt Wanda in prayer especially this cancer of course the back is one thing and I remember the sad part is talk to you several times and mention my sister but you know when you got cancer it just takes that one little thing and then all of a sudden it just spirals downhill from there just drastically if anybody's ever had a personal experience with someone that had cancer they can have it have it have it and then all of a sudden something will happen like this and I'm not saying she is we're gonna pray for her here but they seem to just spiral down at that point and it just in no time it's over I remember we went visited my sister my mom called and said that she was doing really bad and we got there and we went to visit for Thanksgiving and time with the kids and they were trading her wigs out and taking silly pictures and they went bowling and they did all this stuff it's like wow you know you think this is just this is my sister of old she's just gonna keep going and going and that was Thanksgiving passed Before Christmas because it was right after that um just it went right after that but amen we're just going to trust the Lord in his Divine wisdom to move on to Sister Norman's Aunt Wanda right now amen for this situation amen sister Shelia wrote a request please join in prayer for my son Dominic flying to London this Tuesday to give a speech be a part of a conference and we'll fly home next Sunday amen thank you all believing for traveling mercies and safety and a blessed experience amen God bless you all [Music] um she also has at the bottom here shria R and Gabriel seem to have a stomach virus so please remember them in prayer as well amen I'm guessing Alice is okay [Music] man so Sharia art and Gabriel have some sort of stunning virus so let's remember them in prayer amen with all the things going on the devil's on a rampage he knows his time is short the greater is he that is in US anyone have an unspoken request in your heart today anyone something somebody missed you'd like to mention yeah looking away from my neighbor Paul he has cancer he's been before Lord yes you put him in my life amen I need you I'm learning the video amen Paul's A Good Man spent time with him went to eat I believe didn't he go with us or go eat one time to eat at the Coopers no I think so yeah I think you went over there one time he helped Zach take the oil because none of us uh I don't consider myself a mechanic but I'm sort of mechanically inclined but the Patsy mechanic we couldn't get it all the oil drain plug yeah Paul came over there got under there and did what he did and got it all mechanical is like a good man help press uh he's he's done a lot he's done a lot for me actually uh but his brother Pat's a very good friend next door neighbor so please remember him in prayer if you would absolutely if I wanted to mention my sister Esther I went to visit her Friday and she took a fall the day before it was all boost up might have a broken toe on some of all the other issues for sister lady as well even anyone else let's stand if we could then take these things to the award today please remember me I'll be flying out at five today took us off the Salt Lake and then put us back on so it looks like things are going to be moving along we might actually start washing some cars this week it looks like now that things have come together so uh but I leave at five so appreciate your prayers and the work week and I'll come down remember Patricia today and Patricia yes not feeling well today as well amen Lord Jesus we just sang that song create in me a clean heart yes Lord Jesus unto me the joy of my salvation Lord May that speak to our hearts yes Lord I am so burdened because our Pastor said already our enemy Satan is going about like a roaring lion he knows his time is almost up Jesus Jesus and he's fighting us harder than ever before you know James put it so soberly he that keepeth the whole law it offended at one point he is guilty of all all mine yes Lord search our hearts help us Lord Jesus if the enemy had thousands of years of practice Up in Heaven Sin originated in heaven and then when he was through he was cast down with the third of the Angels yes and Lord give us that discernment to recognize the devil and all his tricks oh Jesus Jesus help us to identify ourselves with you in your word at all times Lord I can see in the book of Acts your children your disciples your women and men of God they came together broke bread praise went on in witness and their lives were so full of you so Godly that people fell in their Shadows yes they were healed amen and father Where Do We Stand today we think we are doing all right I didn't find ourselves with the world we have more of a fellowship with World worthy people in the things of the world than the things of God help us Lord there's things in our lives that we know that we're not right but we're going to continue to live any life we want to in the other slate father we're gonna miss it if we go repent keep us on the protection of your precious blood help us to recognize that we are yours we are vessels that you want to work through that your life may be manifested underserved let your love may be extended to everyone yes that's around us Lord oh help us in our shortcomings Lord let it speaks to my heart we know judgment begins at the house of God Lord I'm so thankful that's all these years of my good points but Lord that's not going to keep me out of your kingdom show me where I fall shorts oh yes Lord through the preaching of the word through the exhortations whatever it takes lord it's like James also said our life is like a vapor we're here one minute and gone tonight oh yes oh Lord speak to our hearts our treasure is this where our heart will be also you know our hearts but we're not right may we repent of it even now because there are some serious needs amongst your people yes God lord we are not a defeated church we are more than conquerors in the name of Jesus Christ and Lord there's several that are dealing with cancer your lord we know that you are truly our great physician our high priests that can be touched by the feelings of our infirmities and with your strength we are healed we claim Deliverance for sister numbers friend and all the other ones are dealing with serious ailments and and diseases father we claim what belongs to us yes when enemy gives us a box of rattlesnakes the problem said we just give it back amen yes Lord that we stand on your word we stand on your promise we claim total delivery we claim healing for each and every Hallelujah yes Jesus and Lord all the unspoken prayer requests you know each and every heart Lord you may you grant to them their hearts desire yes I just read in your word this morning you said ass [Music] [Music] our brother is he brings forth your word let us not be here to warm in a state or just having something to do but let our hearts hunger and thirst for your righteousness so it shall be filled let us be fed then as we leave this morning we'll be like the ones that you walk with in the world of Emmaus yes that our hearts burn within us amen thank you Lord along the way this morning in your name we pray may the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen amen praise the Lord you could be seated if you'd like testimony amen I wanted to say um that uh Joel appreciate your prayers for Joel he did so good last Sunday uh just fantastic I mean for for a kid that Barrett doesn't have drums only time he plays is when he goes for his lessons and to get up in front of all those people and do what he did Sunday was such a real blessing he's so good you just see that the Lord has his hand on him there's a talent there and he was nervous you could tell he was he was very nervous but he did exceptionally well I was so proud of him so thank you for your prayers amen appreciate that uh it also brings me to a point I wanted to mention or ask would anyone have an objection not that Joel is like anywhere near playing them yet but anyone have an objection if I bring my drums and put them in the corner set them up in here you know um they'll probably just sit there for now unless or until he gets the point in time that uh uh he can play them or just keep a rhythm that's that's what I've been trying to tell him the whole time he's just in church we just we just that's that's the only thing really my opinion that's about the only purpose drum Servant Church is you just you they're just there to keep beat they're not turned they're not to turn church service into a rock concert or a jazz show there to keep a beat to get a nice steady beat and um and it's just nice that someone wants to share their talent with others and I appreciate Micah and Zach and their talents the Lord bless them with and they're extremely talented in what they do and then I feel blessed to have a look on both sides of new year but um if it does get to that point and so I want to make sure before I put them up there's any objection so if everybody's okay with that might operating the whole thing in but some and put it in the corner over there maybe if he gets a chance he can come out and practice a little bit from time to time and we'll see how that goes so amen but I appreciate your prayers about that anyone else have a testimony anything yeah yes um we have a box turtle and he has a lot of Personality he'll come up to you and stick out his neck we hadn't seen him in a week and you know I have ring and I get notices of different things going on in the neighborhood and one guy reported that there's a loose box turtle in his property and we hadn't seen him and Leah has she admitted that she leaves the garage door open and then The Little Door going into the garage and and being that we didn't see him as ran down to that neighborhood was looking for him and when she got back she says I I didn't find him I said what makes you think it's him he might be buried so we look under the bush we look where he would we couldn't find any signs that he was around so I told her let's pray amen ask the Lord that he'll come out and he'll show himself amen and we pray the prayer of faith and since it's too hot he won't come out half an hour later he was out saying I'm here amen praise the Lord wonderful amen where was he I he there's a bull she in your yard in our yard oh okay Lord then show himself he came out and he usually don't come out when it's so hot yeah when it's dry but he the Lord brought him out praise the Lord God is good anyone else yeah yeah so we've been watching the YouTube trying to learn things I don't know we're so old they don't need to do early but we're in uh I see you we watch the stories of the Bible and uh and the studies and things and and I'm just I think the Lord speaking to me uh is the revelations are are Revelations from God they're learning that he's turned loose even for all the knowledge that we go to the moon or whatever yeah it puts it in people's mind to be able to do this and to go ahead and do it and uh different things they studied they studied Bible and things that I've already studied so I was interested and I live I listened close up the year that we're living in from creation it's nice to hear I'm talking about the beginning it was in creation and then yeah and all the studies have been made in the the Christian uh followings and and the Jewish followings and and I think all these things are Revelations of where God has already got it in his Bible and he just helps explain it to him and let him understand all of a sudden they see it oh wow I know I can see that you know and find out what year it is you know why that well here we are in this present time it's just so far from creationism it's amazing that that we there's so many things are there I mean even if you didn't study it you can sit down at the YouTube and see this presentation and and it just goes on and it's wow that's from the Lord you know just all that knowledge and Revelation and and that's available yeah in these in these times and it just makes you all wonder you go to heaven and you're gonna see all this stuff unfold yeah and just know things that are wow you know I studied it and I didn't really see that little trigger there you know what it is over here yeah there's just and it just opens you up to more and more yeah amen praise the Lord for it for any Revelations that he gives us yes all the time amen it's just like my neighbor he has a Revelations of what he comes over to face something the Lord just gives him that blessing and yeah sometimes you just get frustrated but you call somebody in and next thing you know here we go amen praise the lord it's the Lord in our lives thank you Jesus yes what he has in store for us amen can't even begin going to start praise and I've been dealing a pull towards a neighborhood City for several months and so the week before last time went and joined which wasn't very much I spoke to the director volunteering there Black Ops I mean one some lots of respiratory integration that I do at the career Central's office and it was approved for one high record S I believe when it's a pope I'm busy enough right so I believe there's something amen something someone yes there and I wouldn't I want to thank him amen amen yes praise the Lord yes God has it all under control knows what he's doing I'll win where we just try to step through the doors he opens it yeah amen yes right Micah's got a song for it so to have him come here [Music] bless you bless the Lord is happening seeing the service this morning so that's why I was singing so much but I had this on my heart too so he gave me more of me listen Lord song we all know feel free to sing along [Music] out of here [Music] so I'll cherish Ed always [Music] oh yes [Music] for my years [Music] an exchange [Music] amen Jesus Saints

sovereign foreign [Music] [Applause] amen How We Do Cherish that precious rugged cross that Jesus Christ was willing to go to give his life and die for us amen departed and to sanctify us amen praise the Lord Jesus let's stand up if we're good this morning deal with she enjoyed the service amen let's turn over to Matthew chapter 11. amen we'll try to pick up where we left off last time [Music] chapter 11. continuing on with the thought God in simplicity amen let's did part one so this will be part two I want to focus on today the guided Simplicity the seed of Satan amen the seed of Satan be our Focus today Matthew chapter 11. we'll just read one verse verse 25. I do 11 25. before we do let's just power his forward of prayer if we could Lord Jesus father God we're so very thankful your grace and mercy to us Lord thank you for the opportunity to be in your house one more time lord we don't know but what this might be the last Gathering we ever have we'll never meet like this again Lord and one day that'll be the truth and Lord we do truly believe as a as a body of Believers that that is so real God so real to us in this day that we live lord it's not just something we say we truly believe that this could be be the very last time that we meet like this Lord we just pray God that you're going to help us Lord now do the remaining part of this service that all that we could do for you God as you would speak to us from your word help us Lord through the revealing of this word to draw closer to you Lord you open your word to us once again and show us in there what you'd have us to see and know God we're we're a needy people today father is evident Lord by the prayer requests and the things that we know in our lives our families and different ones Lord God that we are a needy people today but trusting you father for all things because you bring and do everything that is good and right you make all things work together for our good Lord because we love you Lord thank you for this word thank you for the ability to turn back the pages of this word and expect you once again to speak to us from it to meet us here Lord we rebuke every demonic spirit that would try to hurt hinder and filtrate this service in any way God that you would get the glory honor and praise for all that is said and done now may it accomplish that that you send it forth for now as we committed to you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen amen Matthew chapter 11 verse 25 we'll read this one scripture and let you be seated at that time Jesus answered and said I thank the old father Lord of Heaven and Earth because thou has hid these things from the wise and prudence and has revealed them unto uh unto babes amen you could be seated if you like Amen Kid and revealed in the same mechanism amen God hiding himself and revealing himself in the same that is the Simplicity of who God is amen we went into the realization I truly believe that uh if if it's if if a God is going to hold accountable uh someone as young as 12 years old that brother Branham talked about the age of accountability 12 13 14. I believe it should be at the point that a person of that age should be able to grasp understand and believe the revelation of God's word to be saved to be born again to take God's word and for that word to work in their lives amen it doesn't take them a chemical engineer it doesn't take someone of uh a degree of 16 years of their walls plaster of the paper it's just something that God simply reveals to his children something that God in Simplicity shows himself to us recognizing that it is him a lot of times if you can see it and it is something that's that is brought in that simplistic of a way you can pretty well believe that that is God Amen because man complicates things but God doesn't amen Men actually tried as we read last week Men actually try to complicate God Amen and to others they do complicate God but God himself is not complicated amen amen God is not hard to find God has got not hard to understand amen God is not hard to get a revelation from amen our ability and our letting go of ourselves enough to believe amen amen now let's go back over to Revelation chapter 12. uh we delved into last week amen which oddly enough and unbeknownst to me uh brother zeph did last week uh read from Revelation 12 as well and I want to go back to the seventh verse now last week or last time we spoke uh we went to the first verse and went through of the Heavenly uh Gatherings of these symbols that are in the scripture that brother Branham teaches us through these the Sim uh the symbols of the word like even through Revelation 5 and the seals and them they're just symbols that there is something that God reveals that is based on that so so we went through those things about the woman the Jews the Orthodox church and the new is the new gospel church coming forth and the uh the law going away Grace coming in amen and uh the 12 apostles but and of course Christ being born Herod there waiting to destroy Christ as soon as he was born but now I want to go back to the seventh verse and talk about this this war again amen and what that war meant uh as we uh as you read Revelation 12 7 amen and what this was now I mentioned this the last time we spoke which I told you was kind of jumping forward to the next message which is today uh brother uh Dennis mentioned in his prayer today uh about Sin beginning in Heaven Sin did not originate here on Earth sin originated in heaven and we read this again because we know that the devil uh as we can go over and find in Isaiah 14 where he desired to be like the most high worship like God lifted above God being being worshiped like God that's what this that's what in the in Lucifer's heart he wanted to do when it begins to talk about the dragon the the red dragon the the serpent uh the uh the devil and Lucifers all the same amen so now he preached a message that convinced a third of the angels to believe his message amen and so there was a war in heaven seventh verse Michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought and his angels and prevailed not neither was their place found any more in heaven the Great Dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and Satan which deceiveth the whole world he was cast out into the Earth and his angels were cast out with him amen so all of this the devil Lucifer Satan was cast out of Heaven because he was no longer able to be there it says there was no there was no place found anymore well um a casket is not a good place for a living human being amen uh a casket is not a place for a living human being um Jesus never attended a funeral why because if Jesus went to a funeral the man came back to life amen amen when there's no place Mount in heaven that means that heaven is perfect pure holy righteous and any uh inkling to the contrary of that there's no place for that in heaven so because it was no place for evil for deception for for Satan anymore he was cast out and those that believed his message were cast out with him a third of the angels of heaven were cast out with the devil and were cast down into the Earth thou precious Brothers have he mentioned uh the other day about the creation and without form and void and I believe some of schofield's notes goes along that line where it talks about after the creation that Satan was kicked out into his judgment there that turned the earth into without form and void and chaos and and it took the word of God now whether that's true or not we don't absolutely know for sure but uh I I could see what he's talking about I could see how that would absolutely uh be something that would come to pass that God's perfect creation being thrown into chaos by Satan in his is is Fallen Angels coming and doing what they did but then it took the word of God regardless when the Earth was without form and boy Darkness upon the face of thief it took the word of God to come forth and set that Earth that God had created in his perfect proper position amen took the word of God because after the creation it begins in the third verse by saying and God said so it took the word of God in the chaotic state that it was in it took the word of God to bring this Earth back into the perfect or into the perfect place that it was meant to be in God's mind God had the creation in his mind before he created it and when he created it he created it the way he wanted it but when it was in a chaotic State there had to be something that caused it to form into the image that God saw in his mind now when God had you in his mind and and and in his mind you were to come into this Earth and a predetermined time way uh purpose in his mind you you were that perfect being because you were the attribute of God Amen you were the thought of God and there's not a thought of God that comes out of him that's not perfect and righteous and holy and exactly the way that God informed it or desired for it to be but when we come into this Earth we come into this word uh uh uh in sin-shaped iniquity speaking Lies We Came in a way that was chaotic we came to this earth in a way that was dark and and without form and without anything good amen you don't have to teach a baby to lie it's inherent in them because of the nature that they're born in that situation amen but it takes the word of God it takes the word and what is the word because this is the part I want to get to today amen a word is a seed a word is a seed that gets planted amen that's why it's very important to know what you listen to yeah to understand what you listen to Because those seeds get planted and if it's the wrong seed friend and it's planted in you it will come to its place of maturity yeah cause a seed in the right ground the right atmosphere it will mature to the place that it that it was intended to of what is inside the seeds you got to be very careful uh what you listen to what word you listen to who you hear preaching I'm not telling you who to and not to that's up to you I'm just saying that we all have to be very careful about what we who we listen to amen as far as the word goes because the word is a seed and it took the word of God to go forth on this Earth the low Gospel of God to come forth and root over this Earth to form it and to shape it and to make it exactly into the beautiful place that God intended it be to begin with but now on our theme God said God said God said light uh Darkness it was seeds it was a a botany life animal life human life but let's go to the 11th verse uh still Genesis 1 11 [Music] because there's just this particular part again like I said I I want to focus on uh for this morning Genesis 1 11. amen and God said let the Earth bring forth grass the herb yielding seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind amen so again as we know inside of body life God placed in that botany life that the ability to reproduce itself amen the seed inside that botany life was placed there by God for it to reproduce itself amen amen and it was so after his condescene is in itself upon the Earth it was soaked and the Earth brought forth grass and the herb yielding seed after his kind and the tree yielding fruit amen the tree yielding fruit whose seed was in itself after his time and God saw that it was good amen so inside each one of these botany live animal life and human life was seed to be able to reproduce of its own kind amen a cumin seed doesn't produce a pig a dog seed doesn't produce uh an aloe plant amen an orange seed doesn't produce a man amen an orange seed produces an orange amen so the seed of God produces one thing God the seed of God can only produce one thing because the seed of God is exactly what in it is God amen and when your seed is planted and it Finds Its bedding ground it only reproduces what it is amen God saw this that it was good but now look and remember Satan sin began in heaven cast out on the Earth and as he was cast on in this earth you know he's going to do everything you can to continue to sow his seed like he did in heaven he's going to continue to try to disrupt all of the perfect order that God had said in order on Earth just like he did in heaven Satan is always to this very day Satan is always and still is looking for someone that he can work in yeah he's trying to find some way to get in someone so that he can work through that person and when God and when Satan was cast on this Earth he realized he couldn't get to God's perfect creation through botany mine he just couldn't do it um a fern Bush doesn't speak a cactus doesn't talk uh a cactus uh a pine tree can't have relations with a human it can't happen amen so he found the one person now forgive me for this but he found the one person in God's evolutionary scale yes I did say that word because God is an evolution it's just not the way the scientists say he is right amen amen you can understand that God continuously evolved his creation even from the first time that he spoke amen right he created botany life then he created animal life then he created human life well in whatever measure you want to measure that with that's an evoluting of God in his perfect understanding it's his perfect ways I should say in God's perfect place so Satan understands this so in God's way of and his evolutionary of creation he created and began with botany life and went all the way up to the chimpanzee and the and and the gorilla the eight and then in between there he created a another animal and it was called The Serpent right that serpent was created as the link between the monkey and the man that that's that is why to this day that evolution in the way that Darwin the different ones the scientists believe today can still only even though they try to teach it like a fact it can only be considered to in professional documents as a theory right because they've been unable to prove it and why they've been unable to prove it because the serpent is not in his original creation as that link between the monkey and the man and man himself so smart can't see the simplest of it remember that time where that man challenged brother Branham and the and the Lord kept the spirit kept speaking through brother random and said tell him it's here say we're at that serpent seat he said where is it he said tell him it's here but where is it he said it's a serpent amen the spirit of God speaking through that Prophet to this unbeliever the skeptic of where the where the word of God manifests itself even in the world today but Satan's still looking for someone that he can work through looking for a vessel that he could find he's still trying to find that vessel but he found in the Garden of Eden he found the one seed the one link that connects with the human and the animal and that was the serpent seed the serpent was be gullible yes the serpent was beguiling but he was begalable he was able Satan was able to use the serpent to get in him to be able to spread his seed July to try to bring disbelief so now we can see us he's found that he's looking for a subject as he's found the serpent to work and he's looking for someone at some place that he can sow this seed now now he's looking for not just a natural seed which he was able to do he's looking to sow a spiritual seed and the first thing that the devil tries to do is to sow a spiritual seed before the physical seed ever takes root amen amen you notice in the Garden of Eden let's just go over to the third the uh Genesis 3. we'll just read it again thank you Genesis 3 1. look here now now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made and he said unto the woman yea have God said ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden now he's not purposely at this point trying to sow a natural seed he's trying to sow a spiritual seed remember where did Brother Branham say the greatest battle ever fought takes place it's up here in the mind and that's exactly what the serpent Satan threw the serpent is trying to get through to Eve is trying to get to that greatest battle ever fought in her mind to deceive her into believing what he's bringing her is the truth said friend be careful what you listen to amen someone may be a great Orchard maybe a powerful deliverer they may even be anointed but that doesn't mean what they're bringing is the truth yeah amen you've got to be very careful see uh and this serpent very very beguiling amen he said unto the woman ye shall um uh yay had had God said ye shall eat and not eat of every tree of the garden again questioning God's word the woman said unto the serpent we may eat of the fruits of the tree of the garden but the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden God has said ye shall not eat it neither shall ye touch it lest she die that's God's word in its purest form that's exactly what God Said Amen but look with the serpent again being being influenced of the devil Satan just like he did in heaven he's working to do this here now in God's children that is here on the earth he's trying to do the exact same thing he's trying to sow his seed he's trying to get his seed now notice you cannot to to believe that there's a literal uh physical Satan scene is wrong there's not a physical literal Satan seed it's a serpent seed amen that's physical literal serpency but there is a spiritual seed that is of the devil that he continually tries to sow in whomever he can find a way to get in amen a spiritual seed and he's trying to sow that seed and eat he's trying to get his seed of doubt and unbelief to the uh to Eve the serpent said unto the woman ye shall not surely die for God doth know that in the day you eat thereof then your eyes shall be opened and ye shall be as Gods knowing good and evil now everything he says the truth but it wasn't God's word amen it was true what he said happened but it wasn't God's word that's not what God Said Amen a lot of people a lot of times people come up and try to say something and and think so well this is true and look at this but it's not what God's word says I will stick with God's word period amen it doesn't I whatever anybody else might do or say God's word is what I am focused on is that's my meat that's my life amen regardless of what all the other scientists can proven whatever it's like I was telling brothers that the other day we and I tell every brother I take up her sister up to Sabino I said you know you'll hear him now I didn't listen to it this time they don't give you the narration as you go up now the used to be the driver would narrate and tell you all this stuff I got the earphones and you got to plug in and listen on your earphones and stuff and the driver just drives so it's taken kind of some of that human element out of it but in that in that that they used to tell and I don't know what they told because I didn't listen I've listened to that a hundred times so I didn't listen but as if Brothers have listened on the earphone and I told him I said you know when you get up here close to the top the driver or whoever's narrating it now I'll tell you that those big rocks over there fell off of there uh in this earthquake of 19 whatever I don't even remember anymore some great big earthquake and those rocks came loose and fell down now to how they knew that I don't know they're just speculating probably I said but I always tell every brother or sister anybody I take up there I said but brother green told me and told us if you remember that though that brother Branham told him that those rocks were put in place when Jesus Christ was crucified and the Earth did quake and the Rocks did rent I said now you can believe what the scientists are saying but I'll take what the what the prophet said amen amen I'll I'll hold to what brother Branham said instead of a scientist that probably speculating or thinking that it fell off in some great earthquake no he said those were put in place when the Rocks did quake and the Earth did rent the Earth that that's what I'll take from it so what he's saying is true what the serpent is telling Eve is true but it's not God's word you can't leave God's word you've got to stay with God's word now would all of this come to pass at some point in time maybe amen not that it would have ever been through the original sin and the ACT between the man and the woman but it might have come to the place that as of the wisdom that that the serpent is talking about but now look what he found look what look what we know what happened for God does knowing the day either of then your eyes shall be open and you shall be as God's knowing good and evil so first the spiritual seed was sown before the physical seed could be sown because remember the battle's up here am I amen and once the enemy wins the battle up here it takes place in here right right amen when he won that battle in her mind he won that battle in the physical sense and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise she took which those are some powerful apples now I'm telling you uh if we if it's apples that make a person wise and uh in a day when Common Sense isn't so common anymore like I'll say what brother Branham said on the Patsy apples again amen amen I had some powerful fruit though that would make somebody wise she took of the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also unto her husband with her and he did eat and the eyes of them both were open again plus some powerful fruit open their eyes and they knew that they were naked and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons and I took a physical a took a physical a spiritual implantation of a seed before a physical implantation of a seed could take place and of course we know what happens next it comes out in the fourth chapter and she has twins she has a cane and she has an able one is from the seed of the serpent amen seated the serpent not the seed of Satan the seed of Satan is a spirit is a spiritual seed amen just like the seed of God is a spiritual seed that God put in each one of you that spiritual seed that's the Manifest and the to come forth as God as God manifesting himself on this Earth that spiritual seat is the same seed that Satan is the same it's a spiritual seed that brings forth upon the earth now look at this this is God of this evil age amen talking again about the the seed of Satan God of this evil age we find now this evil age is to prove look this is one of my favorite quotes out of the 100 200 000 quotes that are my favorites this is one of my very favorites uh now we find this evil age God of this evil age Jeffersonville August 1965. we find out this evil age is to prove to Satan that she who she the bride amen God's Pride she is not like Eve God's pride is not like Adam's bride she is not like Eve that she is not that type of a woman praise the Lord to FLIR around with all these other thoughts denominations dogmas doctrines she doesn't flirt with all that unbelief and all the uh the wisdom of man he's not that kind of a woman she holds to God's word in God's word alone because who seed is in her praise God because she she belongs to God amen amen praise the Lord she's not that kind of a woman so we are here what I read from that is we are here as the Bride of Jesus Christ to prove to Satan amen first and foremost prove to Satan that we this bride is not like Eve amen I'm not going to fall we don't fall for all this uh altering of the word or or some man's idea of it or or hydrating it in some way or interjecting our own thoughts opinions ideas we are not like this Eve we believe God's word and we're going to hold to it until our last breath because it is Who We Are amen it is Who We Are praise God and she will be tried who is that she we us we the bride she will be Tried by his word the Bride As Adam's bride was Tried by the word Adam's bride failed seed was sown it corrupted her amen and it had to take a Son of God a pure Son of God Adam to go down to Redeemer is the only way that it's the only way that she found redemption or salvation is through her husband going down and becoming what she was it's the only way amen and Adam's Pride believed every bit of the word all but confused on One Promise they used the same yesterday today and forever see but failed on One Promise under the temptation of the enemy face to face and now the people that's called for his name of course is his bride she is to come in contact Again by the same thing seed of God the word of God praise the Lord not by denominational truth or something but by every word for in the beginning of the Bible man was given the word of God to live by one word one word misinterpreted by a man called Satan or the serpent in a person of an animal called The Serpent Satan in this person could talk to Eve and misinterpret the word to her and was lost so seeing he says it must be by every word amen every word every word is a seed of God Amen that's that's planted in the individual the seeds of the serpent the seeds of Satan were sown in Eve and she believed it praise the Lord the Bible says that she was in the transgression not Adam amen she was in the because she she believed this to be the truth look here again God of this evil age [Music] hello God this evil a same message and notice he preached the serpent Satan through the serpent preached that kind of scientific social educated Progressive gospel to eat amen same scientific social educated Progressive gospel to Eve and then in every one of those facets people take and complicate god with to be amen it's like I said last time saying it's it's no more than an equality it's in spirit right that's really good to try to complicate God is no more than than a nicolaitan spirit to try to project to the people that the priest knows the preacher knows the pastor knows more than you know you've got to listen to me to even come close to try to figure it out and you'll probably never figure it out anyway like we have oh it's just a nickel dance in spirit it's like a Catholic Church keeping the Bible from the uh from from children of God back in the dark ages to try to keep the word away from them amen it's it it's the same spirit preached that kind of scientific every one of these science science will take you as far farther from God you can think social educated educational take you a million miles from God Progressive gospel how many people here today talk about a progressive gospel now I know in me I've grown in the Lord but that doesn't mean the gospel has progressed right right that doesn't mean that God has changed hey may God still the same I might see some things differently than I used to but the gospel is the same gospel I might know more of it you might know more believe more of it and being revealed but the but the gospel itself is the same God has not changed so the belief of progressive gospel is just to think that God has changed God's doing something different he's doing it in a different way he's revealing something through the word that uh revealing something that's not in the word I should say that's just try to put some uh extra something on it to get people's attention to try to to try to mess with their mind because he wants to plant a seed there uh Satan wants to plant that seed because he knows if he can get that seed planted he's got an invoice an inroads to your heart to your to your soul if he can get in there amen but he preached that kind of scientific social educated Progressive gospel to Eve and Adam's bride believed it Adam's bride believed it in fact brother Branham said that he went looking for this kind of wisdom when she left her husband brother random says she went out looking for the kind of wisdom that would make her a smarter or the wisdom to to to be in a higher position of some kind he said she went looking for it you know what friend if there's something in your life that or something of the word that you don't like or something that you prefer not doing you know you're gonna find somebody that's going to tell you it's okay not to do it right right well you're gonna find somebody that'll tell you it's okay to do it or whatever the situation is amen you're gonna find somebody it's like that story I told about uh my old boss years ago when I first started at uh Columbia beauty supply beauty and barber supply back in Charlotte we had a sales consultant came in and he he was a Christian considered himself a Christian went to church regular and all these things and he would always try to witness to Roy and try to tell Roy about Jesus and Roy wasn't interested but he kept doing it anyway and kudos to him for trying to witness but you know he got to the point and said Roy why don't you go to church Roy doesn't go to church he said why don't you go to church he said well this that and the other whatever excuses were he said well you know just keep going until you find one that you like he said that this this man told told Roy he said going to church is like a glove you just have to find one that fits and I thought all you're fishing for is trying to find the preacher that'll preach something just to tickle your ear so that you can live however you want to and do whatever you want to and think that you're a Christian right that's that's the world today yes that's what you see all these people like uh I'll I'll say it just like the Oprah Winfrey's and different they live all kinds of ways and say and say they're a Christian and and musicians Sometimes they come out and they look just as horrible ungodly and and and and that's so uh how they look and how they had that's up to them but don't do all that they come out and try to say that you're some kind of Christian right that's your devout Christian or some kind of and then look and act like that and talk like that and see you know that just doesn't fly but but a lot of people believe that because they found something like the glove amen that that it it fits well you can find it even go in I had I had the other day I had the the older guy the guy I told you was the curmudgeon on my team is a good friend now uh he asked me the other day he said well I'm Newton he said you know if you had a bigger Church you wouldn't even have to work here because he was talking about our managers planning on retiring stuff and he said you wouldn't even have to do this job I said well Rhonda said you know if I compromised on the word I could probably have a church full people yeah he's looked at me and laughed he said that's probably true amen I said yeah I was just late let down the standards let down the bars Don't Preach to Pure gospel I mean sure you can have a church full of people you just compromise a little here and compromise a little there the the sin's okay just you know come in and repent and you know go out no that's that's the same deception that has came through the Catholicism right you can live whatever your life you want just come and pay your pennants and going about your way you'll be okay and what you know whatever they do uh you're all you're all fine you know and if you do die outside of it we'll we'll pay enough money we'll we'll get you out of purgatory anyway it'll be all right that's the same Spirit yes amen I said you can find it if there's something you want to do you can find anybody in the and you look on YouTube or whatever you'd find anybody that'll tell you it's okay to do so and so oh they'll just use the scripture to try to confuse you or that was the Old Testament well if that was the Old Testament the Old Testament it's not any good anymore why does your Bible on your put have the Old Testament in it then if you don't even believe it why do you even have it what's the point right amen oh they'll go over to the New Testament though when it serves their purpose but see it's seen it's the seed of Satan that he's continuously trying to sow into the minds of people to get them to believe the same thing that he believed in the garden that God did me what he said but God means exactly what he says Saints yeah amen amen he means exactly what he says and he does exactly what he said he would do yes amen Adam's bride believe it and he has succeeded in filling his so-called bride of Christ the Church of the Church of the second Adam with the same thing my Saints what is it then what day are we living if it's gotten that way to this world today that they live in that kind of deception throwing out the word of God for the word of a man throwing out the truth of God's word because some other preacher said it was okay oh God have mercy amen we don't follow man we follow the word we follow what Jesus Christ said amen praise the Lord I did have this one more I wanted to read amen the seed of discrepancy listen this is uh January 1965. January 1965. seed of discrepancy look each age each age produce such a crop every age has did it and ours is no excuse we have the same thing and a greater age of it than all other ages put together one because all those things are all wound up right in this last stage right all that White Horse red horse black horses all becoming to a Pale Horse right it's all come into one now at this last time this is The Showdown amen this is The Showdown Aid this is The Showdown time amen uh this is the ending of world's history as he said this is the this is the great discrepancy uh that's ever been upon the Earth is on the face of the Earth today discrepancy in other ages pulled them away from the true and living God to Idols today Jesus said in Matthew 24 24 that it would be so close that it would deceive the very elected if it was possible talk about discrepancy oh my scene of discrepancy is so Connie Satan is among the people and just such a theologian to 99 of the word 99 of the truth brings about as much Division and separation from God as a complete lie because one little deviation of the truth is a lie amen you can call it white lie you can call it purple eye yellow green blue I don't care what color you put on it it's still a lot right amen and people do the same thing Satan among the people just such a theologian a doctor of divinity trying to spread that seed again what does he do complicates the word what does he do complicate the message you've got to listen to me to understand it you got to come to this church for you can get it friend that's a lot of the devil amen God never prerequisited every one of us as individuals we go where God leads us absolutely we better go where God leads us to go amen but we don't have to be in a certain Ministry or list of certain thing that that's just man trying to manipulate people trying to make you feel like that it's got to be done in a certain way by a certain person uh how could you ever listen to such a horrible speaker well you know what brother Branham by no means was even close to being the best speaker that there ever was Amen brother Branham was not a very good orator but he got his point across he got his message across amen he got what he wanted to say across and of course it was to the people that were willing to listen it was a people that was willing to listen you see the difference in in in Billy Paul's testimony when he talks about the man who was witnessing this guy working he gave him a book a brother ran him and he gave him a book and the man came back the next day and said don't you ever get me anything by this man ever again the man said what's the problem that's that's one of the best messages he said that man in that book called me a buzzer and he said that's funny because I read the same message and that same man in that same book called me an eagle amen it just depends where where is the seed being sown amen what seeds is being sown amen praise the Lord look let me finish this quote now Satan is among the people and just such a theologian such a doctor of divinity can teach that word almost almost perfectly Jesus said so but just watch him there'll be somewhere said we'll come uh now that wasn't for this oh yes it is because God said it was God's book Satan is more Connie more deceiving more intrusive than he's ever been and he has to be because he knows his time's running short yes he knows that his ability to be able to influence all of you is about out right right he knows this time because he nobody knows it any more than he does well what does he do he Stripes he fights he battles he sends out as many of his little minions his fallen angels that he probably possibly can to get you deceived could you get you below what you really are to try to get you to doubt in some way to question things about God and his word and the message oh my that's exactly it's just I I think I told you all one time a very dear friend and still a dear friend in my opinion left a message I called him and said brother I heard so and so he said well I haven't left of course he had and he has but that's what he told me personally on the phone he said but so and so on such such and I've seen things and he said I I read this or I saw this video by a certain brother up and and mile looked at those things it was so convincing he said I'll send it to you I said don't bother brother not interested yeah yeah why would the Bible says don't give place to the devil amen and anything that comes against the word or God's prophet and this message is of the devil and I'm not interested I don't want to hear it I'm not going to hear it that's just the devil trying to see that's what he he pushed play and that devil got into his head it already started working obviously and that seed was sold yeah and now what do you do it's going to come to fruition it's going to come that seed it's going to come to maturity amen and to this day he's still not still not in the message he preached so many years in the message I don't know how he can how you can read the Bible and not see the message in it I to me the only way the the way I know this message of course through revelation of God is by the message that God brought through a prophet I look and I think well how how can you read the scriptures we just read and try to preset to a congregation without including what you know brother random said and the truth about Serpentine how could you do it right I don't I don't see how a person can do it but anyway it's just a place to try to sow that seat it's like Jesus said in Matthew I'll go to it real quick but Matthew 13 24 another Parable put forth unto them saying the Kingdom of Heaven is likened unto a man which sowed uh was so good seed in his field oh man God so good seed in his field but while men slept his enemy came and so tears among the wheat and went his way now the seed that was sown by the good man is going to come up the scene that was sown by the madman is going to come up it's going to reach it reach its place Adventure and when you become a Christian you still reap what you sow you understand that we understand we still reap what we sow the thing is when we become Christians we sow a lot less or hopefully none of the Bad Seed anymore so that a whole crop is nothing but good seed amen that's the point and then we reap the goodness of God from the seed that's been sown that's God sowing that seed the bad man is Satan The Good Man Is God but Satan continuously tries to sow that seed and in the sowing of that seat well let me let me go to this one point and I'll close here Revelation chapter 6. he did this exact same thing through the churches he did it in the Garden of Eden and he did it in the church ages excuse me Revelation chapter 2. let's look at this Revelation chapter 2. let's just start with the verse one unto the end of the Church of Ephesus we're starting the church ages now Ephesus the first church write these things says he the holy Seven Stars his right hand and walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks I Know Thy Works in my labor and thy patience and how those cannot bear them which are evil and thou has tried them which say they are Apostles but they're not and they are not and has found them Liars what was that scripture we read the other day about hymenius and felitis that Paul said they're Liars right Paul called them out by name and said these people are deceivers these men are teaching false Doctrine amen and others believe it [Music] he said you have found them that are liars they are liars amen people don't want to say that anymore today friend but it's still the same it's a lie amen it's the one common denominator that all politics has they're all liars I shouldn't say oh maybe there's some good people still on there I don't know but they're just a bunch of liars you can you can see something in front of your face and then you can go and look and somebody's saying well this isn't that you know I just saw it well don't believe your eyes now because what you're looking at is not real yeah you're just lying just say it you're just a liar you don't want to tell the truth because it's inconvenient for you just tell it's just a lie right amen and and that's scripture Jesus here says that you have found them to be Liars they are liars false Doctrine what's a false Doctrine it's alive yes what is it people out there it's like I said a minute ago if there's something you want to do or something you don't want to do friend you can find somebody somewhere on the Internet or somewhere that'll tell you it's okay to do it or not do it right amen that's deception yes and they'll try to use the word against it but it's the word that tells you to do it yeah amen amen but look it's trying to fit that glove amen trying to fit that glove I just want to find a teacher with itchy ears it'll tell me what I want to hear that I can live how I want that I can do what I want amen if you if there's something if there's a desire in your heart outside of God's word you can find somebody a preacher that'll tell you it's okay amen and it's not because it's against God's word what is Jesus calling them Liars they're Liars they're deceiving people into believing what they think are their interpretation of the word is and they're Liars amen is it true and it may sound harsh for me but that's just the truth amen it's not a time to to compromise on the word if Jesus said they're Liars that's what they are I just gotta believe it and third verse and has born and has patience and for my name's sake has labored and has not fainted nevertheless I have somewhat against thee because thou has less left thy first love how did they because a seed was sowed amen a seed was sowed and when that seed was sold there was people that got convinced of it and started swaying from the original truth amen they started going off the original word look at this now remember therefore from whence our fallen and repent and do the first works or else I will come unto thee quickly and remove that Candlestick out of its place except thou repent but this thou has that thou hate us the Deeds of the Nicolaitans which I also hate amen well if you go to the next one you read how much further it's gotten how much further down each Church it has gotten in one a seed become a deed and next to deed becomes a realization and and on and on from the dropping of the seed continues on with Satan moving his church that he created in heaven with a third of the Angels forward into believing his lies he did the same thing in infiltrating the church angels as they began off in Ephesians amen their deeds became reality they became things that they continuously did that was off the word of God yes they started baptizing in titles instead of the name of Jesus Christ they started adopting different ways the communion and the fellowship and ended up where it is today amen where it's Fallen to the place that it's at today how did it get there through deception right through seed through the sowing of seed amen like I said you can search high low you'll find somebody that that'll say what you want them to say amen there's a lot of voices in the land today Saints you got to be very careful of what you listen to listen Ephesian Church age the True Vine hated the formal Deeds of the Nicolaitans and so did God God hates the Deeds of the nicolasans what was Deeds listen we just said this but let me read it what was deeds in the Ephesian Church in the Church of Ephesus became a Doctrine in the pergamist church something that was sown as a seed became a Deeds to the place that God said you've left your first love to then in the Perkins age became a doctrine that they were actually called to follow and lived by amen a Doctrine a Doctrine is something that we consider truth that we uh a a truth of God's word that we live by that's what a Doctrine is that's why we call the book that they assembled together uh the Cod book brother Branham Church order Doctrine because it's a it's a form if you will of things of things that we live by yeah it's what we live by we don't live by it because they're rules we live both because we believe it's the word of God and it's our heart to live it but that's what we live by we look that's what a Doctrine is a Doctrine here was adopted because it was alive amen a lie of the devil in the program is church in in Ephesus the first church it was a deed in the next Church it became a Doctrine can you hear it do you understand it now it was a deed in Ephesus and watch over here in pergamas it became a Doctrine it just started here in its little baby form but what did Paul say Paul said Beware because upon my departure Grievous wolves will come and enter in not sparing the flock what did Brother Branham say basically exactly the same thing yes upon my departure there will be people come and they will deceive you they will they will try to change the word manipulate the word make it sound like something that that tickles the ear instead of what the truth of God's word says it is amen but that's God I know there's many things that we do as Christians as Born Again Believers it grates against the flesh yeah absolutely because that black dog and white dog are going to keep fighting until you have no more breath to draw that's right amen it grates against the flesh but we know what is Right In God's word and how to live it yes and what God uh God has the standard that God has for us that we stand on amen amen it's God's word man is still trying to complicate it God is trying to make it simple and today that war is still carrying on the war that started in heaven is still going on today yes the Battleground is up here say he's still trying to sow his spiritual seed in you to try to get you to doubt disbelief try to complicate it try to make it beyond your reach it's like the proverbial banana on the stick or whatever you like to eat amen you know you're on a stationary bike and you just can't seem to get the right to that to that whatever it is I just give you peddling peddling pedaling and kinky well that's what Satan does that's not a God Amen it's attainable from God but Satan always tries to make it so it's just the deception of the devil that's just complicated so much so they just won't they can't see it they won't understand that's part of the seed of the devil that tries to get you this leave what God 's True Word doubt first and then manipulate amen let's stand if we could God's word is pure amen God's word is simple God's word is there if we believe and hold to what that word says yes God makes it come to pass amen we've seen it over and over and over I mean we heard testimonies in here today amen of God showing himself revealing himself to understand Amen to me I see how how what a difference it makes when a man of God like brother Dennis in his testimony I'd just pick on you uh talking about them looking for that Turtle looking and looking and looking and looking can't find them despair discouraged let's pray yes oh man praise the Lord and his wife who he's still witnessing to to try to come and be here believe this truth yes born again sees that you don't think that doesn't have an influence when after prayer and after not seeing him for how long did you say a week over a week and looking and looking at nowhere to be founded and all of a sudden 30 minutes after praying there he is amen that's just god-working Saints that's God working in our lives and that testimony could be coupled with probably another 100 more if we had the time for each of us to remember and try to recount the many times that God's done that for us yes yes amen praise the Lord he's mindful amen he knows he knows what he's doing and he does it for our good praise the Lord Jesus amen excuse me part of my congestion I'm I'm preaching through it anyway I'm not going to let the devil beat me I was in here yesterday and I thought well I should I just text everybody no I'm not going to do that I'm not contagious or anything it is this congestion just hanging on that's why I asked Micah my throat was so bad yesterday I asked Micah could you help me sing uh and of course he he wears the mic anyway but I wanted to let him know I might not be up to my voice singing and then preaching so amen you know me I just when I sing I can't help it I I just have to sing I can't I can't just not sing and when the spirit hits the emotion moves I I just got to think greater is he that's in me though praise the Lord let's sing it to him now amen greater is he that is amen praise [Music] God has promised us today is over the coming up sing it now amen [Music] and on the day of many courses came a rushing Mighty winds with the power greater than [Music] well I'm so glad I've got it too I'm gonna let the whole way man

Jesus I have a testimony that when I first became a Christian it was about 15 18 months before I became filled with Holy Ghost and I just prayed and fasted and everything I could until that point would happen and what had happened um there was the change in me that I've got to share something with you I I had heard a message like this always from the pulpit which always be preached but it made me so afraid that if I would just see something you know that maybe I'd get a seed inside of me and oh golly maybe I'd fall you know I didn't understand the ceiling of God was just that it's the ceiling and and nothing can get in or out have I made mistakes oh yeah and but it's just like it's just like God will Point those things out and you might feel a little a little uncomfortable about something well that's that's God in Me working to show me something's not right and he will straighten it out if he has to point it out in a congregation and somebody that doesn't even know me and say you over there you're doing such and such and so on so and it's half you're correct yeah cannot fall when you have the seed of God inside testimony sister that's my testimony I have not Fallen God every time has correct we understand that and I want I don't want anybody to think they can fall if they know they have the Holy Ghost absolutely nobody said anybody was falling no but it made me so afraid I want to share my testimony the fear is gone well it's a fear of the devil the fear is gone fears of the devil absolutely because I've been taught that you could fall if you got someone and
