[13:59] of this that he will really turn his
[14:01] heart towards the lord amen no he grew
[14:03] up catholic but he said he went to a
[14:04] non-denominational church when he moved
[14:06] to tucson so yes ma'am um
[14:09] i pray that he will continue to do that
[14:11] and then there's um i have a very dear
[14:14] friend in kentucky that um
[14:16] she is
[14:17] literally the most

[14:36] struggling with the grief with the death
[14:38] of his mom he was the baby of her family

[14:43] going through that grief
[14:45] at this time i just my heart just goes
[14:47] out to them
[14:49] i constantly pray for them but

[14:55] it just you know just lingers and i just
[14:57] i pray for him i kind of understand it
[14:59] at the time but i really understand it
[15:01] now and so i really want to pray for him

[45:48] in the name of the lord jesus christ we

[45:52] amen saint john chapter 3
[45:58] saint john chapter 3 verse 15 that
[46:01] whosoever believeth in him should not
[46:03] perish but have eternal life
[46:06] for god so loved the world that he gave
[46:08] his only begotten son that whosoever
[46:09] believeth in him should not perish but
[46:11] have everlasting life you could be
[46:14] seated if you like
[46:17] amen
[46:18] we want to still focus on that eternal
[46:20] part which of course is the whole
[46:22] foundation underneath the who am i part
[46:25] the the who am i a title that i put upon
[46:27] this message that eternal part is of
[46:29] course the underlying theme of of of
[46:32] this whole thing and what we talked
[46:34] about last week and the sonship and the
[46:37] eternity part and and how it plays its
[46:40] part in and what we believe and how we
[46:43] live and and the faith that we have in
[46:45] our lives the faith that we have looked
[46:47] in
[46:48] those things if we believe those things
[46:50] to be the truth if we believe that those
[46:52] things pertain to us if we believe that
[46:54] we are who the scripture says we are
[46:57] then that should bolster our faith to
[46:59] believe that whatever we ask in his name
[47:02] he'll give to us
[47:03] he promised that and see that helps us
[47:06] to be able to live a more a more godly
[47:08] life christian life closer to him more
[47:11] like him bringing us to that precipice
[47:13] that place where god is changing us
[47:17] inside from inside out that one day
[47:20] it'll even change our mortal bodies and
[47:22] we'll go to meet him in the air
[47:24] all that comes from from that faith from
[47:27] that uh acceptance and knowing who you
[47:29] are believing who you are reaching that
[47:32] place in
[47:33] in you by that faith that that's who you
[47:36] are amen now now
[47:38] the devil's going to bring doubt but a
[47:40] lot of times the doubt will come because
[47:42] your life doesn't match up to what the
[47:44] scripture says and if your life isn't
[47:46] matching the scripture then you need to
[47:47] get your life right yeah that's the
[47:49] bottom line to that if your life's not
[47:51] right get your life right if you're not
[47:53] born again get born again if you've not
[47:54] been baptized be baptized follow the
[47:57] scripture precedent and it will it will
[47:59] do what it said it would do
[48:01] amen but but if you've done that you're
[48:04] who you believe the word says that you
[48:05] are then you grab ahold of that by faith
[48:08] and don't let the devil rob it from you
[48:10] but hold on to it by faith and believe
[48:12] that god's going to answer that in every
[48:14] way in in every time because he is
[48:18] faithful yes he is faithful that promise
[48:21] amen now last time that we uh uh
[48:25] entertained this thought uh we ended up
[48:28] in ephesians so i want to go back there
[48:30] and i want to kind of pick up where we
[48:31] left off last time obviously as i said
[48:34] last week was our christmas message if
[48:36] you will on the prince of peace and
[48:38] being at peace and you know i've really
[48:41] tried to
[48:42] well ever since the lord really kind of
[48:44] settled that in my spirit i i try to
[48:47] practice that more
[48:49] uh but ever since the last week and last
[48:52] sunday even that much more just just be
[48:55] at that piece yes uh there's still
[48:59] the world's just gone crazy i mean
[49:01] brother brown said that we had a
[49:02] wholesale insanity and we know that
[49:04] we're living in that time where there's
[49:06] just a wholesale insanity
[49:08] you look at the way people are acting
[49:10] you look at things that's going on you
[49:12] look at the government the things that
[49:14] get said and the things that you've done
[49:15] and sometimes i look at some of the
[49:17] headlines and i think what are you
[49:19] thinking right that that's just that's
[49:22] not even normal human rational thinking
[49:25] right
[49:26] normal human rational way to act or
[49:29] behave
[49:30] right it just it just boggles the
[49:33] i i would say the the the common natural
[49:36] thought process
[49:37] of some of the things that said
[49:40] and and
[49:41] and what's going on
[49:43] uh
[49:44] i even
[49:46] i got to give you one example before we
[49:47] go to this now but i even heard that of
[49:50] course we know that uh the crime is on
[49:54] on a very
[49:56] large scale now increase
[49:58] exponentially and a lot of that's in uh
[50:02] some of that's in california san
[50:03] francisco different places i've heard
[50:05] that some of those some of those places
[50:07] where there's that rampant uh a really
[50:10] over-the-top crime looting stealing
[50:14] even murdering
[50:16] and at gunpoint
[50:18] a woman walked in the other day with a
[50:19] pickaxe and threatened anybody to stop
[50:22] her from stealing whatever she wanted
[50:25] that they're going to pay the criminal
[50:27] so that they'll stop
[50:29] killing people wow
[50:32] they're going to go to the criminal and
[50:34] say okay we know that you're a criminal
[50:36] we're going to pay you now if you just
[50:38] won't kill anybody just don't kill
[50:40] anybody and we'll pay you for it right
[50:42] it's just the
[50:44] the normal logical thinking is
[50:46] absolutely gone and it just it baffles
[50:50] the mind sometimes i look at it i think
[50:52] what are these people thinking but it's
[50:54] satan's eating that's right they were
[50:56] just living in satan's eating and and
[50:58] that spirit the the bride is being
[51:00] pressed out brother branham said she
[51:01] would the bride's being pressed out
[51:04] she's she's being pressed out she's
[51:05] being pressed up right amen she's being
[51:08] pressed upward
[51:09] and and that total darkness is engulfing
[51:12] the world and that's what it's got to do
[51:14] but if we know who we are it's not a
[51:16] threat
[51:17] it's not a worry you can still live and
[51:20] rest in peace
[51:22] because you know who your prince of
[51:23] peace is right amen
[51:26] now let's get back to this first uh for
[51:28] ephesians chapter one again uh like i
[51:31] said this is more or less a guide
[51:33] if anything else and i looked at it the
[51:35] other day and i thought mah who can even
[51:37] read that my handwriting is so horrible
[51:40] uh and i've been reminded of that many
[51:41] times in my life by teachers and spouses
[51:44] just foul singular but i tried to go
[51:47] back and rewrite it where it looks a
[51:49] little more legible so i hope it's a
[51:52] little more legible to you but it's more
[51:54] or less a guideline
[51:55] and and how it just it struck me the
[51:58] other day how paul wrote this letter to
[52:00] the ephesians this first chapter here it
[52:02] just out it just hit me so astounding i
[52:04] thought you know it would look good if
[52:06] there was a visual of that
[52:08] to see how the progression was
[52:11] and how paul
[52:13] paul wrote it out here so let's go back
[52:15] and read it again ephesians 1 we'll
[52:17] start with the first verse again and
[52:19] we'll just we went through i think the
[52:21] first three
[52:22] um
[52:23] oh and plus last time i forgot one so i
[52:25] left one out so i had to add in but
[52:28] let's go i think i went through
[52:29] predestination but we'll go through it
[52:30] again and we'll do go through the first
[52:32] two a little quicker than we did last
[52:33] time
[52:35] and just revisit this and and uh follow
[52:38] through with this again
[52:39] paul an apostle of jesus christ by the
[52:42] will of god to the saints which are at
[52:44] ephesus and to the faithful in christ
[52:46] jesus
[52:47] grace be to you and peace from god our
[52:50] father and from the lord jesus christ
[52:53] blessed be the god and father of our
[52:55] lord jesus christ who had blessed us
[52:58] with all spiritual blessings
[53:00] in heavenly places in christ
[53:03] praise the lord where's the heavenly
[53:04] places in christ
[53:08] according as he has chosen us in him
[53:11] when
[53:13] before the foundation of the world we
[53:15] were chosen in him before the foundation
[53:19] of the world so we again had the great
[53:22] elohim he wasn't god because god's an
[53:25] object to worship there was nothing or
[53:27] no one there to worship him he was the
[53:29] self-existing elohim
[53:32] as we know him as god
[53:34] then it breaks down to who we are
[53:38] amen chosen
[53:40] he chose us
[53:41] in him so where were we
[53:44] we were in him
[53:45] so he chose us in him because
[53:48] we were attributes we've said so many
[53:51] times through this series attributes of
[53:53] his thoughts of his the intellectual
[53:56] property amen chosen in him before the
[54:00] foundation of the world before this
[54:02] world was ever laid the galaxy stars
[54:04] moons uh universes all the things out
[54:06] that we see before any of that ever
[54:08] happened god chose you that's how
[54:10] our name was able to be put on the
[54:12] lamb's book of life before
[54:14] the foundation of the world to perform
[54:16] before the forming of the world our
[54:18] names were put on the lamb's book of
[54:20] life why because he chose us then so out
[54:23] of elohim came us the chosen amen he
[54:27] hand picked us amen
[54:29] that we should be holy and without blame
[54:33] before him in love and that's exactly
[54:35] how god created man when god created man
[54:39] he created man before him because god
[54:42] spoke adam out of the dust of the earth
[54:45] breathed into him the breath of life so
[54:48] before him was a man walked perfect holy
[54:52] without blame
[54:53] amen and how does that work by love
[54:56] right how does everything of god work
[54:58] right by love amen
[55:01] how does grace work by his love how does
[55:03] faith work by islam how do we
[55:07] have love for one another through his
[55:09] love every all of it operates by his
[55:11] love so
[55:12] we are holy so
[55:14] adam there was holy and without blame
[55:17] before the lord then there was a fall
[55:19] amen
[55:20] there was a fall of the garden of eden
[55:22] so after that we were chosen now
[55:27] after we were chosen
[55:29] he predestinated us
[55:32] unto the adoption of children
[55:34] by jesus christ to himself according to
[55:37] the good pleasure of his will so now
[55:39] he's predestinated us and remember
[55:42] there is a con there is a very distinct
[55:45] connection between the four knowledge
[55:48] and the predestination of god but they
[55:51] are not the same
[55:52] amen remember the foreknowledge of god
[55:56] is the all-knowing part of god he knew
[55:58] the beginning from the end as we have to
[56:01] say it he knew from eternity to our
[56:03] eternity if that's better amen he knew
[56:06] from eternity to eternity he knows
[56:09] everything brother banh said every nap
[56:12] that would ever come on this earth and
[56:13] every
[56:14] time that now would bat its eye and how
[56:17] much tallow every gnat would make and
[56:19] produce in its life
[56:21] that's an infinite god that is an
[56:24] all-knowing god
[56:26] but from that all-knowing came his
[56:29] predestination
[56:31] the predestination now places us as
[56:34] those uh adopted sons
[56:37] that that predestines who we are who
[56:41] we're going to be where we're going to
[56:43] come from who our parents were where we
[56:46] lived where we were born what country
[56:48] what state what what language what uh
[56:52] what the creed or or color or or
[56:55] nationality that all of us would be
[56:57] we're all predestinated to that purpose
[57:00] there's a reason why you were born in
[57:02] the family if you were predestinated you
[57:04] were chosen you're in the mind of god
[57:07] there was a reason why you came forth in
[57:10] the family that you came forth in and
[57:12] had the parents that you had there was a
[57:14] reason why it was tucson or charlotte
[57:17] north carolina or jeffersonville indiana
[57:20] or or kentucky burkesville or wherever
[57:22] it was that you were born there was a
[57:24] reason
[57:25] god
[57:26] predestinated that for the purpose of
[57:29] him
[57:31] that purpose
[57:33] by jesus christ was to
[57:36] fulfill the will of god to his good
[57:39] pleasure
[57:40] it was to fulfill the will of god to his
[57:44] good pleasure now no matter what of the
[57:47] four corners of the earth you were born
[57:48] in and whatever god called you or
[57:51] commissioned you or purposed you to do
[57:53] that's the
[57:54] predestination
[57:56] amen he predestinated you to that
[57:59] and put you here and put you in us in a
[58:02] flesh body
[58:03] to be able to fulfill that will and that
[58:06] purpose now we were only able to do that
[58:09] after the fall because of jesus christ
[58:14] amen jesus christ came to do away with
[58:17] sin like we said last week the purpose
[58:20] first john
[58:21] that of christ's manifesting was to do
[58:24] away with sin annihilate sin
[58:27] to get rid of sin well sin didn't even
[58:30] enter in the camp until adam and eve in
[58:32] the garden of eden
[58:34] so jesus christ had to be manifested you
[58:36] look how quickly this story unfolds as
[58:39] paul is telling it from the great elohim
[58:42] to the choosing of us in his mind before
[58:44] the foundation of the world and
[58:47] predestinating us to the purpose that we
[58:49] are to fulfill while we're here
[58:52] the predestinated purpose that we have
[58:55] and every one of us have that
[58:56] predestinated purpose yes in fact it's
[58:59] like i said the other sunday uh that
[59:02] predestinated purpose that god has he
[59:05] has for you
[59:07] not somebody else right
[59:09] you don't you don't sit there or or say
[59:12] god god wants you to do something well
[59:14] god gets somebody else to do that no you
[59:17] were predestinated to do it that's why
[59:19] he's called you that's why he's asking
[59:21] you to do it yes because he's he's
[59:24] depending on you whatever it is he's
[59:26] depending on you to do it he might send
[59:29] a specific person your way to talk to or
[59:32] witness to or to pray for
[59:34] you are the one god has chosen to do
[59:37] that right you say well i'm not
[59:39] important i i don't preach i don't sing
[59:42] i don't play an instrument i don't do
[59:44] this i don't do that i i just uh uh i
[59:47] i'm not an important person in the
[59:49] kingdom of god saints in the saint and
[59:52] the sonship of jesus christ every one of
[59:55] us is just as important as the next and
[59:58] that includes brother branham right yes
[1:00:00] yes in the sonship of jesus christ he
[1:00:03] had a higher calling in his life right
[1:00:06] but in the sonship of jesus christ he is
[1:00:08] no higher than you or i right at all
[1:00:11] he fulfilled the purpose god put him
[1:00:13] here for i believe right amen and you
[1:00:16] have to fulfill that purpose that god
[1:00:19] put you here for right
[1:00:21] the only way we're able to do and
[1:00:24] fulfill that purpose is by the adoption
[1:00:27] of children by jesus christ
[1:00:30] because jesus came to do away with the
[1:00:32] sin
[1:00:33] if you were encumbered with that sin in
[1:00:35] your life you could not fulfill the
[1:00:37] purpose and the predestinated will that
[1:00:39] god brought you here for you couldn't do
[1:00:42] it
[1:00:42] in fact you had no desire for god even
[1:00:45] right until god came and took that sin
[1:00:47] away from you had no desire for uh for
[1:00:49] god or godliness or predestination or
[1:00:52] doing anything from the lord amen i
[1:00:55] didn't right i don't think anybody did
[1:00:57] but when jesus christ came
[1:01:00] amen
[1:01:01] and god and christ did away with sin
[1:01:04] brought in and initiated the grace of
[1:01:07] god in our lives that vehicle i talked
[1:01:09] about the other day that helps us
[1:01:12] understand and get ourselves to the
[1:01:14] place that not only god's forgiven you
[1:01:18] you believe that right
[1:01:20] god's forgiven you yes but that vehicle
[1:01:23] god gave us is so that we as mortals can
[1:01:27] get to the place in our mind in our
[1:01:30] spirit that we forgive ourselves right
[1:01:33] which is a lot of times the hardest
[1:01:35] thing amen
[1:01:37] forgiving ourselves god's already
[1:01:39] forgiving you yes and you've
[1:01:40] acknowledged you know god's forgiven you
[1:01:42] the blood of jesus christ annihilates
[1:01:44] every sin amen you know that but so many
[1:01:48] times and the devil uses this as one of
[1:01:50] his devices is to try to encumber you
[1:01:52] with with the unforgiveness of yourself
[1:01:55] right right you hold yourself guilty of
[1:01:58] those things when the blood of jesus
[1:02:00] christ has annihilated and it has no
[1:02:02] part of you again amen
[1:02:04] forgiving yourself right that's what
[1:02:07] grace is about
[1:02:08] the grace of god is about you
[1:02:10] understanding that through his grace and
[1:02:12] through that blood i am guiltless
[1:02:16] praise the lord
[1:02:18] let that vehicle work in your life amen
[1:02:20] because if you feel guilt now if you
[1:02:22] feel condemned right then then you can't
[1:02:24] have the faith that you need to have as
[1:02:26] a child of god
[1:02:27] you can't reach that place to fulfill
[1:02:30] that purpose god wants you to do it's
[1:02:31] like we talked about the other day
[1:02:33] you become a person less than what you
[1:02:35] ought to be
[1:02:37] god's purpose in your life to fulfill
[1:02:40] it has to be fulfilled at the fullness
[1:02:42] of the capacity that god has given to
[1:02:45] you
[1:02:45] if god has given that to you then use it
[1:02:48] the best your ability amen i thank god
[1:02:50] almost every day i say god thank you
[1:02:52] lord for hell strength life in my body
[1:02:55] and for the and a sound mind to be able
[1:02:57] to serve you better today than i did
[1:03:00] yesterday
[1:03:02] and if you do that every day every other
[1:03:04] day is each day is it is in the rearview
[1:03:07] mirror because this is a better day this
[1:03:09] is a new day this is a day to serve the
[1:03:11] lord better today
[1:03:13] now better can be a
[1:03:15] relative term what does better mean a
[1:03:18] better means different to everybody so
[1:03:21] better to you might be different than my
[1:03:23] better but it's better than it was
[1:03:25] yesterday lord i want to be closer to
[1:03:27] you
[1:03:28] more like you
[1:03:29] that's the predestinated will of god
[1:03:32] through the adoption of the blood of
[1:03:33] christ that has annihilated that sin
[1:03:36] believe that that blood has annihilated
[1:03:38] that sin believe that
[1:03:40] believe that if you live it now if you
[1:03:42] don't live it then that's a whole
[1:03:44] different thing right it doesn't work if
[1:03:46] you don't believe it if it's not a part
[1:03:48] if you don't live it then it doesn't
[1:03:49] work for you
[1:03:51] but it but if you do
[1:03:53] if it's a part of you if you believe it
[1:03:55] and you live it and you want it to be
[1:03:57] that way and there's no there's no other
[1:04:00] encumbrance
[1:04:01] encumbrances in your life to hinder you
[1:04:03] from it you believe that it's it's yours
[1:04:05] right amen it's yours yeah amen but but
[1:04:09] i will say there's nothing worse than an
[1:04:11] unbeliever trying to act and live the
[1:04:12] life of a believer
[1:04:14] because it just doesn't work
[1:04:16] it makes a person miserable first of all
[1:04:19] because they know they have a desire
[1:04:21] still burning in their heart to go do
[1:04:23] something else they know that
[1:04:25] but yet they try to conform to that to
[1:04:28] that image
[1:04:29] that that we're supposed to be
[1:04:31] transformed into
[1:04:33] they try to conform themselves into it
[1:04:36] and it just doesn't work it just makes
[1:04:38] people miserable yes you know a a
[1:04:40] believer can't live the life an
[1:04:42] unbeliever can't live the life of a
[1:04:44] believer it just doesn't work but if
[1:04:47] that word is in you and that faith is in
[1:04:49] you you believe and you know this is who
[1:04:51] you are then you just you stand on that
[1:04:53] it's just it becomes who you are you
[1:04:55] live it because it becomes a part of who
[1:04:56] you are
[1:04:58] we were chosen predestinated
[1:05:01] praise the lord predestinated
[1:05:05] unto the adoption of children
[1:05:07] by jesus christ to himself
[1:05:10] according to the good pleasure of his
[1:05:12] will amen it's not my will it's his will
[1:05:15] not my way it's not what i want to do is
[1:05:18] not it's not my life even i died i died
[1:05:21] to myself paul said i died
[1:05:23] amen that he might live
[1:05:25] and we all died of ourselves that he
[1:05:27] might lives not my will not my way his
[1:05:29] way amen whatever you would have lord
[1:05:31] that's what i want
[1:05:33] and it's to the praise and the glory of
[1:05:35] his grace
[1:05:37] the glory of his grace wherein he hath
[1:05:39] made us accepted in the beloved
[1:05:42] in whom we have redemption
[1:05:46] now
[1:05:47] we've been chosen
[1:05:49] in this choosing he predestinated us
[1:05:52] that adoption is that predestination
[1:05:56] then he redeemed us because we were
[1:05:59] fallen
[1:06:00] there had to be a redemption come in
[1:06:02] whom we have redemption through his
[1:06:05] blood
[1:06:06] the forgiveness of sins according to the
[1:06:08] riches of his grace now how rich is his
[1:06:11] grace
[1:06:13] well there's no end to it right
[1:06:15] to us right his grace is bountiful amen
[1:06:18] and
[1:06:19] it's it's more than we could even
[1:06:21] imagine or hope for
[1:06:23] but it's by his grace that we're able to
[1:06:25] be redeemed
[1:06:26] so in so we came chosen predestined but
[1:06:30] then when we came in this world we came
[1:06:32] in a falling condition so there had to
[1:06:33] be redemption through the blood of
[1:06:35] christ
[1:06:36] that redeemed us back to himself
[1:06:39] forgiving us of our sin annihilating
[1:06:42] that sin
[1:06:44] there's no more sin about you
[1:06:46] you've been redeemed you were here
[1:06:49] falling down to here
[1:06:51] god's
[1:06:52] got it his blood redeemed us back to who
[1:06:55] we're supposed to be
[1:06:57] again the only way that we could fulfill
[1:07:00] that adoption fulfill that purpose was
[1:07:04] to be in that redemptive
[1:07:06] plan yes that redemptive process that
[1:07:10] redemptive place because it put us back
[1:07:13] where we're supposed to be in him
[1:07:16] amen in the mind of god where he saw us
[1:07:18] before the foundation of the world
[1:07:19] that's where we're supposed to be that's
[1:07:21] where our lives are supposed to live
[1:07:23] be lived right there
[1:07:26] amen before the lord there had to be the
[1:07:28] redemption so chosen predestined
[1:07:31] predestinated then we were redeemed
[1:07:34] and we were redeemed and brought back
[1:07:36] into our proper position
[1:07:38] amen let's continue on through his blood
[1:07:41] the forgiveness of sins
[1:07:43] according to the riches of his grace
[1:07:46] where he had now look he had the bounded
[1:07:50] toward us
[1:07:51] in all wisdom and prudence what his
[1:07:54] grace
[1:07:55] he abounded to no wonder brother adam
[1:07:58] said if you go to hell you'll have to
[1:07:59] trample all over the blood of christ
[1:08:02] because his grace is so bountiful amen
[1:08:06] you never find anywhere in the bible
[1:08:08] where it says his judgment is bountiful
[1:08:13] amen but his judgment is true his
[1:08:15] judgment is real but his grace is
[1:08:17] abundant
[1:08:19] his grace abounds above and beyond
[1:08:22] anything any any any disease any
[1:08:26] affliction
[1:08:27] any unbelief
[1:08:28] his grace abounds amen amen even beyond
[1:08:32] his judgment his judgment only exists
[1:08:36] when humanity refuses absolutely flat
[1:08:40] out refuses his grace
[1:08:43] yes that's the only time his judgment
[1:08:45] comes into play yes it's when his grace
[1:08:48] is completely totally rejected and
[1:08:51] spurned
[1:08:52] then there's nothing left but judgment
[1:08:54] right right once his grace is burned
[1:08:56] there's nothing left but judgment but
[1:08:57] his grace is a bountiful
[1:08:59] yes praise the lord no wonder we've been
[1:09:02] redeemed no wonder we've been brought
[1:09:03] back to where we're supposed to be where
[1:09:05] we were in the mind of god before the
[1:09:07] foundation of the world god wanted to
[1:09:08] bring us back to this place here right
[1:09:11] when he chose us when he chose us he
[1:09:13] didn't choose us in that fallen
[1:09:15] condition
[1:09:16] he chose us in his mind as eternal
[1:09:19] beings amen attributes of himself right
[1:09:24] have fellowship
[1:09:26] to be worshipped
[1:09:27] amen to uh
[1:09:30] to fulfill that purpose to fulfill the
[1:09:32] will of god on this earth
[1:09:34] amen whatever he wants us to do and he
[1:09:37] and then shed his grace in our lives
[1:09:40] amen now there's people
[1:09:42] and and there's ministries and there's
[1:09:44] there's people that that turn the grace
[1:09:47] of god into lasciviousness
[1:09:49] there's people that take the grace of
[1:09:51] god and make a disgrace out of it i hate
[1:09:54] to say that but i mean that's what paul
[1:09:56] said to romans
[1:09:58] there's people that do that they do that
[1:10:00] yet today they take the grace of god
[1:10:02] and they trample all over the blood of
[1:10:04] christ thinking they can just live
[1:10:06] whatever they want to by their own will
[1:10:07] and their own dictates no no the grace
[1:10:10] of god has come so that we can be
[1:10:12] reconciled back to him again
[1:10:14] so we can do his good pleasure not ours
[1:10:18] yeah amen so people who think oh this uh
[1:10:21] god's grace is just so amazing yes it is
[1:10:24] but it's not amazing for you just to
[1:10:25] live however you want to right it's not
[1:10:28] amazing just so you can do whatever you
[1:10:30] want live whatever life you want dress
[1:10:32] and act and do whatever you want no no
[1:10:33] no his grace isn't there for you just to
[1:10:36] be whatever you want live what no it's
[1:10:38] not there for that
[1:10:40] it's there to reconcile us back to him
[1:10:42] and that vehicle to alleviate that
[1:10:45] burden
[1:10:46] that sin burden off of us
[1:10:49] so that we can recognize i have been
[1:10:51] redeemed
[1:10:53] i have been brought back to where i was
[1:10:55] in the mind of god before the foundation
[1:10:57] of the world that's that seed
[1:11:00] that's that seed that acknowledgement
[1:11:03] and recognition of that seed that was in
[1:11:05] there that was god that eternal part of
[1:11:07] you that was god has brought forth that
[1:11:10] life again
[1:11:12] and that life takes over your spirit
[1:11:14] life takes over your body life and
[1:11:16] you're a different person
[1:11:18] you look the same
[1:11:20] amen but you won't for long
[1:11:22] amen amen we will be changed in the
[1:11:24] moment the twinkling of an eye our
[1:11:26] bodies will be changed these moral
[1:11:28] beings will put on immortality and we
[1:11:31] will be a different
[1:11:33] people
[1:11:34] even in the flesh
[1:11:36] not bound to this time not bound to the
[1:11:38] sin
[1:11:39] amen but new creatures yes praise the
[1:11:41] lord new creatures through his
[1:11:43] redemption
[1:11:44] by his grace his bountiful grace

[1:11:50] prudence
[1:11:52] amen and prudence is with importance
[1:11:55] amen you do something with prudence it's
[1:11:57] with importance amen
[1:12:01] ninth verse now
[1:12:03] having made known unto us the mystery of
[1:12:06] his will
[1:12:07] according to his good pleasure which he
[1:12:10] had purposed in himself so he chose us
[1:12:13] he predestinated us he redeemed us back
[1:12:17] to where we were supposed to be
[1:12:19] and when we've reached that level of
[1:12:21] being to the place in the mind of god
[1:12:23] born again filled with his spirit that
[1:12:25] seed birthing forth life in you that god
[1:12:29] see then he gave you revelation
[1:12:32] he unveiled the mystery of the will of
[1:12:35] god according to his purpose
[1:12:38] he unveiled it
[1:12:40] it's no longer a mystery to those who
[1:12:43] believe to those who have received it to
[1:12:45] those who god has shown it to that
[1:12:48] mystery is no longer a mystery
[1:12:52] it's no longer a mystery not to the
[1:12:53] bride
[1:12:54] because that because the cover has been
[1:12:57] ripped off
[1:12:58] the the truth has been made known and
[1:13:01] it's and it's revealed
[1:13:03] the mystery of his will the revelation
[1:13:06] of god has been unveiled to you so now
[1:13:09] you know who he is
[1:13:12] and who you are in him
[1:13:15] and that's
[1:13:17] and that's the purpose of christ
[1:13:19] was to help us understand who we are in
[1:13:21] him yes the purpose of christ coming is
[1:13:24] to help us get to that place to know
[1:13:26] it's the only way we could be redeemed
[1:13:27] is through that blood
[1:13:29] i've been redeemed by the blood of the
[1:13:31] lamb amen
[1:13:32] that's the only way we can be redeemed
[1:13:34] but once we're redeemed and once we're
[1:13:37] in that position that's when god begins
[1:13:39] to unfold himself to us
[1:13:41] that's when god begins to reveal himself
[1:13:43] to us that's when we begin to learn
[1:13:46] that's when god begins to put things in
[1:13:48] your heart so that you can recognize not
[1:13:50] only who he is as god which a lot of
[1:13:52] people know but who you are in him which
[1:13:55] most people don't know
[1:13:57] if they are in him at all they don't
[1:14:00] know that
[1:14:01] but that's why god come to reveal to us
[1:14:04] his work so that we can understand what
[1:14:07] part we play today and who we are
[1:14:10] just in these few verses paul is
[1:14:13] teaching the ephesian church
[1:14:15] the complete unfolding from the
[1:14:18] beginning as we say beginning
[1:14:20] from eternity and the elohim
[1:14:24] and who we are we're the chosen
[1:14:26] the predestinated
[1:14:28] where the redeemed
[1:14:30] god has revealed these things to us amen
[1:14:33] that revelation as i've said many times
[1:14:36] becomes a part of who you are
[1:14:38] and when it becomes a part of who you
[1:14:40] are then you live it then it's lived
[1:14:43] through you
[1:14:44] it's not lived through you until you
[1:14:46] understand or have a revelation of it
[1:14:49] it might be a knowledge that someone
[1:14:51] works on a little here and there or
[1:14:53] something or you get a knowledge of
[1:14:54] being baptized in the name of the lord
[1:14:56] jesus christ you go get baptized and
[1:14:57] then somebody talks you out of it you go
[1:14:59] back the other way or whatever it it not
[1:15:01] knowledge revelation
[1:15:04] and that's and then and that's how from
[1:15:06] from glory to glory to glory he's
[1:15:09] changing me
[1:15:11] amen we grow in the grace and knowledge
[1:15:15] of the lord jesus well we know his grace
[1:15:17] is bountiful that knowledge is the
[1:15:19] revelation that god unveils to us
[1:15:22] that was a mystery
[1:15:25] having made known unto us
[1:15:28] the mystery of his will yes praise the
[1:15:31] lord
[1:15:32] but you have to you have to get to the
[1:15:34] place to where that word is becoming
[1:15:37] more prominent and more uh productive in
[1:15:40] your life becomes more part of your life
[1:15:43] that's how we grow into the word that's
[1:15:46] how we become the word
[1:15:49] that's how we become
[1:15:50] a mate a bride for christ
[1:15:54] is that we have to grow to become like
[1:15:57] he is
[1:15:58] because christ isn't marrying a
[1:16:00] prostitute right
[1:16:02] christ isn't marrying someone who comes
[1:16:04] to church once in a while or dabbles in
[1:16:06] the truth or uh maybe gets baptized
[1:16:09] right or something and and goes off and
[1:16:11] lives another way or goes to a different
[1:16:13] church except some other denominational
[1:16:15] dogma so god's not marrying something
[1:16:17] like that
[1:16:19] he's marrying a pure chaste virgin
[1:16:23] that is the word
[1:16:25] that is of like kind
[1:16:27] and we are a light kind to him
[1:16:30] even though in these animal flesh were
[1:16:33] nothing but beasts without the holy
[1:16:35] ghost which
[1:16:37] becomes more and more evident every day
[1:16:39] as we realize the beast nature of people
[1:16:42] uh around the world around this country
[1:16:44] almost every day
[1:16:46] without the holy ghost a man it's just a
[1:16:48] beast but becoming that word
[1:16:51] the bride becoming that word so that
[1:16:54] we're like kind
[1:16:55] he came in flesh to redeem us back to
[1:16:58] him and once we've been redeemed through
[1:17:00] the revelation of his word we become the
[1:17:02] word amen he became us
[1:17:06] so we can become him
[1:17:09] his blood is still here still on that
[1:17:11] mercy seat making intercession on our
[1:17:14] behalf and that blood is here to
[1:17:18] take that blood takes our place
[1:17:21] that that sin position that humanity
[1:17:23] that we were born in it takes that from
[1:17:26] us it becomes that
[1:17:28] christ became sin so that we would
[1:17:32] we would be righteous
[1:17:34] we're now robed in his righteousness
[1:17:38] because we become his righteousness he
[1:17:40] became us kin folk a human so we could
[1:17:43] become him
[1:17:45] and the only which is the only way that
[1:17:48] he would he would marry a bride
[1:17:50] is to be like him
[1:17:52] that's where we came from
[1:17:54] we were redeemed for that purpose
[1:17:57] the revelation of that word is to bring
[1:17:59] us back to that place through the
[1:18:02] growing in grace and knowledge of the
[1:18:04] word
[1:18:06] that's why god had to send a prophet for
[1:18:08] this last day
[1:18:09] to bring this last day bride back into
[1:18:12] that place again where she becomes to
[1:18:14] look in the very image of christ
[1:18:17] because in the beginning or or the day
[1:18:19] of pentecost those people came out
[1:18:22] kicking and screaming and speaking in
[1:18:23] tongues they were reflecting themselves
[1:18:26] in the image of the very christ they had
[1:18:28] just crucified
[1:18:29] but after so long in the years that that
[1:18:32] that seed had to go on the ground and
[1:18:34] die and rot so it could raise again
[1:18:36] afresh today
[1:18:38] scripturally it had to happen
[1:18:42] so that this last day bride could
[1:18:44] reflect that first day brian
[1:18:47] that this last day bribe would be the
[1:18:49] reflection of jesus christ just like
[1:18:51] that first day bride was that's why i
[1:18:54] pro that's why from paul to brother
[1:18:56] brown there had to be that prophet to
[1:18:58] bring that word
[1:18:59] not that brother branham was god friends
[1:19:01] we don't believe that right amen we
[1:19:03] don't believe brother branham was god
[1:19:06] but we believe that god spoke through
[1:19:08] him
[1:19:09] amen but i also believe god speaks
[1:19:11] through you
[1:19:12] yes i believe god speaks through me yes
[1:19:15] amen yeah
[1:19:17] god uses us just like he did brother but
[1:19:20] there had to be a truth of a message
[1:19:21] brought from the revelation the
[1:19:24] unveiling the
[1:19:25] revelation of the word
[1:19:27] so that this bride could could see that
[1:19:31] and know that was who she is
[1:19:33] just like that eagle in the chicken yard
[1:19:36] when it came over and that scream went
[1:19:38] out
[1:19:39] who understood the scream
[1:19:41] not the chickens
[1:19:43] pecking scratching in the chicken yard
[1:19:44] but the eagle
[1:19:46] she recognized
[1:19:47] that voice sounds familiar to me and out
[1:19:50] of that she came
[1:19:52] through the revelation what revelation
[1:19:54] who she was
[1:19:56] i'm not a chicken
[1:19:58] i wasn't born a chicken
[1:19:59] amen i was born in the chicken yard but
[1:20:02] i wasn't born a chicken i was born an
[1:20:04] eagle am i i was born in a in a a pigsty
[1:20:09] in a chicken yard but i was always an
[1:20:12] eagle
[1:20:13] see because
[1:20:14] that's who god saw me as exactly amen
[1:20:18] and god and
[1:20:19] and then when you come to realize that
[1:20:21] then you come out of that mess
[1:20:23] and you fly in the heavens now
[1:20:25] amen you make heaven your home yes so
[1:20:28] you don't worry about all the stuff
[1:20:29] that's going on down here because your
[1:20:31] home is heaven
[1:20:32] your home isn't here your home is heaven
[1:20:34] not this cosmos anyway amen it's not
[1:20:37] here it's in heaven so god give us that
[1:20:39] revelation so we would grow to the point
[1:20:42] that god want us to be because here
[1:20:44] we're just talking about a birth
[1:20:45] redemption is just the birth of the new
[1:20:47] birth
[1:20:48] amen
[1:20:49] but the revelation is how we grow
[1:20:52] amen showed us the mystery
[1:20:55] again it's according to his good
[1:20:57] pleasure which he had purposed it
[1:20:58] himself
[1:20:59] that in the dispensation of the fullness
[1:21:01] of times he might gather together in one
[1:21:05] all things
[1:21:07] in christ amen all things
[1:21:10] my son
[1:21:12] hear ye him all things all power given
[1:21:15] unto him heaven and earth all things
[1:21:18] give it to him gather together
[1:21:21] one in all things in christ
[1:21:24] both which are in heaven and which are
[1:21:26] on earth even in him
[1:21:29] praise the lord
[1:21:30] it's all god's
[1:21:33] it's all god's
[1:21:35] the son was just sent to gather his
[1:21:37] children
[1:21:38] it's like that psalm micah sings amen
[1:21:40] that midnight christ gathering his
[1:21:42] children together the purpose
[1:21:44] christ the sonship annihilate sin
[1:21:47] gathered his children together
[1:21:49] to bring them all together in christ
[1:21:51] amen that were presented to him
[1:21:54] without blame
[1:21:56] holy and without blame
[1:21:59] that's how we were chosen
[1:22:01] that's how we will end
[1:22:04] holy and without blame
[1:22:06] in christ because the only place we
[1:22:09] could go is to christ
[1:22:12] we go to christ the mediator that's the
[1:22:14] only way we can make it
[1:22:15] people go to mary people go to images
[1:22:18] people go to saints and and engraven
[1:22:21] images and stuff and they think that
[1:22:22] that that's the intermediate to get them
[1:22:25] there that's garbage that's death that's
[1:22:27] heathenism that's demonic yes
[1:22:30] that's death
[1:22:32] amen the only mediator between god and
[1:22:35] man is that man jesus christ amen
[1:22:38] all things in him
[1:22:40] so we're gathered all together in christ
[1:22:42] that he presents us amen
[1:22:46] a chaste virgin
[1:22:47] holy
[1:22:48] and without blame but it has to be in
[1:22:50] him
[1:22:53] the fullness of times gathered in christ
[1:22:57] heaven and earth
[1:22:58] even in him
[1:23:02] the end of time
[1:23:03] the ending the winding up yes we are
[1:23:06] chosen
[1:23:08] predestinated

[1:23:34] now heaven and earth
[1:23:36] gathering all together how are we
[1:23:38] gathering together on the earth not in
[1:23:40] this little room
[1:23:42] but under the auspice of the blood of
[1:23:44] jesus christ internationally this bride
[1:23:47] is gathering
[1:23:49] so she's gathering together
[1:23:52] through
[1:23:52] the revelation of the word
[1:23:55] recognizing the day that we're living
[1:23:58] who we are in him
[1:23:59] we're all gathering together under that
[1:24:02] one auspice we all worship together

[1:24:07] that shed blood of jesus christ we're
[1:24:09] all coming together

[1:25:40] belongs to us
[1:25:43] sure we have inheritances and insurances
[1:25:46] in this world of course we do but
[1:25:48] they're not solidified or finalized
[1:25:50] until we get on the other side
[1:25:52] amen till we get on the other side
[1:25:56] and the inheritance that god has given
[1:25:58] us that we're looking to friend
[1:26:01] that that perfect place
[1:26:03] that
[1:26:05] the beauty that it that it can be
[1:26:07] expressed in human language paul said
[1:26:10] eyes not seniors not heard so
[1:26:13] to try to find a little
[1:26:15] glimpse of it
[1:26:17] of what god has in store for us friend
[1:26:19] as inheritance what's an inheritance an
[1:26:21] inheritance is something that's given to
[1:26:23] your kin
[1:26:24] something that's given to your posterity
[1:26:28] well if we're not the posterity of god
[1:26:30] then who are we
[1:26:32] if we're not the kin of god if we're not
[1:26:33] the offspring of god if we're not the
[1:26:36] chosen of god then who are we
[1:26:39] god help us but in god
[1:26:42] even if we're not there's a posterity of
[1:26:44] god there's the children of god there's

[1:26:49] ones that are his offspring
[1:26:51] those are those are the ones that he saw
[1:26:53] in his mind and chosen predestined
[1:26:56] before the foundation of the world to
[1:26:58] give an inheritance too
[1:27:00] those are the ones that receive
[1:27:01] inheritance
[1:27:04] the rest has the inheritance of death
[1:27:06] yes in fact those that die without
[1:27:08] christ will be in the grave thousand
[1:27:10] years at least a thousand years
[1:27:12] amen
[1:27:13] we go to wedding supper of the lamb and
[1:27:15] the inheritance god blesses us
[1:27:17] oh friend what a time it's going to be
[1:27:19] you can't even begin to imagine
[1:27:21] we try to i guess sometimes i try to to
[1:27:24] imagine what it's going to be like when
[1:27:25] we're on the other side
[1:27:27] but really what is it going to be like
[1:27:30] praise the lord and then we live with
[1:27:33] him and you know you have the things
[1:27:35] that finalize here on the earth and you
[1:27:37] had the millennium and you had the white
[1:27:38] throne judgment and the new city the new
[1:27:41] new jerusalem and on through eternity
[1:27:43] and all through eternity and all through
[1:27:45] eternity
[1:27:46] amen it goes it just reverts goes right
[1:27:49] back to him
[1:27:51] amen it's like you said and heard many
[1:27:53] times other ministers myself we come
[1:27:56] from god
[1:27:59] go back to the home
[1:28:01] amen
[1:28:02] come from god chosen
[1:28:04] predestinated
[1:28:05] then redeemed
[1:28:08] revealed to
[1:28:09] end of the times the mysteries of god
[1:28:12] and and his inheritance to us
[1:28:16] and then it just goes and go reverts
[1:28:17] right back to god again amen amen that's
[1:28:20] where it all goes
[1:28:22] that's where it all came from that's
[1:28:23] where it all goes to hallelujah it's
[1:28:25] like we read last week the sonship amen
[1:28:29] jesus christ that sonship now i want you
[1:28:32] to understand when i read that quote
[1:28:33] last week amen i could read it again if
[1:28:35] you if you felt necessary but uh when i
[1:28:38] read that quote last week i want to
[1:28:39] understand
[1:28:40] that i wasn't saying god has an end
[1:28:44] no oh my no
[1:28:46] not even close
[1:28:48] he's talking about the sonship of christ
[1:28:51] that came out of god that was attribute
[1:28:53] of god yes that attribute will no longer
[1:28:56] be necessary right amen brother brown
[1:28:59] said there cannot be
[1:29:01] an eternal son
[1:29:03] he cannot be eternal and then be his son
[1:29:06] right
[1:29:07] praise the lord
[1:29:09] well then that just again begs to us the
[1:29:12] question if we're sons and daughters of
[1:29:14] god won't that relationship dissolve as
[1:29:17] well
[1:29:19] will it not eventually end if we're sons
[1:29:22] of god that we were begotten can't be
[1:29:24] eternal
[1:29:25] again then it goes back to where the
[1:29:28] eternity is
[1:29:31] in him amen that's where we were chosen
[1:29:35] amen
[1:29:36] that's where we were chosen
[1:29:39] we weren't sons and daughters here we
[1:29:41] were just god here
[1:29:44] a part of god now
[1:29:45] other people say oh you're calling us
[1:29:47] god no i didn't say that
[1:29:50] you got got to understand that's not
[1:29:52] what i'm trying to say i'm not trying to
[1:29:54] say you are god but i am trying to help
[1:29:56] us understand by the scripture that the
[1:29:59] seed that was placed in you from god was
[1:30:02] that part of god who you are
[1:30:05] that's your eternity
[1:30:08] that's your eternal part who you are
[1:30:11] through eternity that's how god chose
[1:30:13] you
[1:30:15] amen
[1:30:17] you are that intellectual property it's
[1:30:19] just a part of you it was expressed out
[1:30:23] thrown into these
[1:30:25] human bodies
[1:30:27] that we might do all the things that
[1:30:29] paul laid out to us
[1:30:31] but then it just goes right back to god
[1:30:33] again
[1:30:35] amen
[1:30:36] praise the lord
[1:30:38] that's who we are in him yes because we
[1:30:41] are in him
[1:30:43] that godly part that god called for us
[1:30:46] to be and who are the people that
[1:30:48] fulfill this that that he's that paul
[1:30:51] said here
[1:30:52] let's finish reading this while we're on
[1:30:54] it in whom we have obtained an
[1:30:56] inheritance being predestinated
[1:30:58] according to the purpose of him who
[1:31:00] worketh all things after the counsel of
[1:31:02] his own will
[1:31:04] that we should be to the praise of the
[1:31:07] of his glory
[1:31:09] who first trusted in christ
[1:31:12] in whom he also trusted after that he
[1:31:15] heard the word of truth the gospel of
[1:31:17] your salvation
[1:31:19] in whom also after that ye believed ye
[1:31:22] were sealed with the holy spirit of
[1:31:25] promise
[1:31:26] which is the earnest of our inheritance
[1:31:29] until the redemption of the purchased
[1:31:32] possession unto the praise of his glory
[1:31:35] what is that gift
[1:31:38] what is that gift that gift is himself
[1:31:42] that gift is the holy spirit
[1:31:45] but what does that holy spirit come for
[1:31:48] the purpose to do
[1:31:50] to bring us back to him
[1:31:53] praise the lord
[1:31:55] it's a temporal gift
[1:31:58] amen let me read you something here
[1:32:01] i i don't mean to
[1:32:03] throw us for
[1:32:05] any more loops in a day but listen this
[1:32:07] things that are to be rialto california
[1:32:10] night
[1:32:11] december 5th 1965
[1:32:14] one of the last messages one of the last
[1:32:16] things brother branham ever said with
[1:32:18] human lips
[1:32:21] he said you people say i got the baptism
[1:32:24] of the holy spirit
[1:32:26] he said that still has nothing to do
[1:32:29] with it
[1:32:31] oh my
[1:32:33] that still has nothing to do with it
[1:32:35] what's a baptism it's an immersion
[1:32:38] it's a covering amen just like if you're
[1:32:41] being baptized
[1:32:43] if you go out and be baptized your
[1:32:45] spirit didn't get baptized
[1:32:47] your soul didn't get baptized what got
[1:32:49] baptized your body what went in the
[1:32:51] water your body what got wet your body
[1:32:54] when that anointing comes and that
[1:32:56] spirit falls fresh it falls on the wheat
[1:32:59] and the tares who gets the water the
[1:33:01] wheat and the tares
[1:33:03] but the tares aren't predestined
[1:33:06] but they lift up and say oh praise the
[1:33:08] lord anyway
[1:33:10] but they're not chosen
[1:33:12] they're not predestinated they're tares
[1:33:15] they just come in there through the
[1:33:16] enemy to mess up the wheat
[1:33:21] but that real gift
[1:33:23] oh brother wait a minute let me let me
[1:33:25] finish this he said i got the people i
[1:33:28] got the baptism of the spirit that still
[1:33:31] has nothing to do with it that's just
[1:33:34] only a temporal gift for you
[1:33:37] and temporal just means a short gift
[1:33:39] just a a borrowed time a short time
[1:33:44] he said the real gift
[1:33:47] amen
[1:33:48] the real gift
[1:33:50] is in your soul
[1:33:52] down in there see
[1:33:54] that was born of god
[1:33:57] and that controls the whole thing to the
[1:34:00] word of god and the will of god and
[1:34:03] there's where you grow
[1:34:06] that's where you go up from
[1:34:08] amen
[1:34:09] the soul
[1:34:10] not not a simple baptism
[1:34:13] and i don't
[1:34:14] i hear a lot of people say oh you've got
[1:34:15] to have the baptism holy ghost i
[1:34:17] understand what they're saying
[1:34:19] event they mean exactly what we mean
[1:34:22] exact same thing i mean
[1:34:25] being born again the soul
[1:34:28] amen
[1:34:29] and it's just verbage but brother
[1:34:32] branham puts it this way
[1:34:34] i got the baptism of the holy spirit he
[1:34:36] said that has nothing to do with it
[1:34:39] there's a lot of people get a baptism
[1:34:41] yes but you need a feeling
[1:34:45] amen god's people need to be born again
[1:34:48] with an indwelling presence of the
[1:34:50] spirit of god
[1:34:51] that's what brings that seed to life
[1:34:53] yeah not just a simple immersion not
[1:34:56] just enough to tingle your flesh and
[1:34:58] make you operate a gift of some kind so
[1:35:00] many people think that they're okay in
[1:35:02] the kingdom of god and can do whatever
[1:35:04] they want because they have some little
[1:35:05] gift or something right
[1:35:07] has nothing to do with it gifts and
[1:35:09] callings of god without repentance don't
[1:35:11] have to repent have a gift amen born
[1:35:14] with it yes amen
[1:35:17] this holy spirit he said that's just
[1:35:19] that temporal gift but the real gift is
[1:35:21] your soul
[1:35:22] amen that inside of the inside that's
[1:35:26] the real gift that's the real because
[1:35:28] that's the real you
[1:35:29] amen
[1:35:30] brother graham says this now mighty god
[1:35:33] unveiled before us
[1:35:37] june 1964 i'm going to close in just a
[1:35:39] few minutes
[1:35:40] the mighty god unveiled before us a lot
[1:35:42] of people don't even know brother
[1:35:43] branham said this he only said it a few
[1:35:45] times but listen
[1:35:47] he said but when he come
[1:35:49] expressed exactly like the testament
[1:35:52] said he would be expressed
[1:35:54] then all those who was redeemable
[1:35:59] believe it
[1:36:00] redeemable is that even a word
[1:36:03] it is to me
[1:36:04] because he said it
[1:36:06] might not find it webster's dictionary i
[1:36:08] don't know never looked but i believe it
[1:36:11] who was to be the ones to receive it the
[1:36:14] redeemable
[1:36:15] i know i read for god so loved the world
[1:36:17] he gave his only begotten son whosoever
[1:36:19] believes shall be uh shall never perish
[1:36:22] amen
[1:36:23] but
[1:36:24] brother branham
[1:36:26] and and that's true this is not negating
[1:36:29] what john 3 16 says right no right
[1:36:32] whosoever believeth anyway
[1:36:34] but this says that he came for those who
[1:36:38] were redeemable
[1:36:40] well what does that mean that means that
[1:36:42] not everybody was redeemable
[1:36:45] not everybody is going to be redeemed
[1:36:47] because they're not redeemable who are
[1:36:49] the non-redeemable those who did not
[1:36:52] have that seed
[1:36:53] right
[1:36:54] that seed of god that was placed in
[1:36:56] there before the foundation of the world
[1:36:58] those who were never chosen they weren't
[1:37:00] chosen of god
[1:37:02] amen just because a man and a woman can
[1:37:04] procreate doesn't mean that they were a
[1:37:06] chosen of god right
[1:37:09] doesn't mean they were predestined
[1:37:12] doesn't mean they were even known of god
[1:37:13] the bible says that jesus said depart
[1:37:16] from me workers iniquity i never knew
[1:37:18] you
[1:37:20] never even knew you
[1:37:23] well just because they can come together
[1:37:24] doesn't make them a predestinated god of
[1:37:28] god or in the mind of god
[1:37:30] that's why he said i never knew you
[1:37:33] those that god knew were in the mind of
[1:37:35] god
[1:37:36] well if you're in the mind of god friend
[1:37:37] you're a part of god
[1:37:39] you're eternal as he is
[1:37:41] well then how could they have been in
[1:37:42] the thoughts and the eternal thought of
[1:37:44] god how could they have been a part of
[1:37:46] god back then
[1:37:48] if they're not redeemable
[1:37:50] right they couldn't be
[1:37:52] it's like saying that people that
[1:37:54] there's an eternal hell like i said the
[1:37:56] other day people say there's an eternal
[1:37:58] hell with the if if people get sick when
[1:38:00] eternal hell they gotta have eternal
[1:38:02] life
[1:38:03] well if you got eternal life you're god
[1:38:06] because that's the only eternal life
[1:38:08] there is it doesn't make sense
[1:38:11] amen you see
[1:38:13] so it doesn't it doesn't make sense for
[1:38:17] for people to say well uh god knew
[1:38:20] everybody he didn't know everybody
[1:38:22] see there's a difference in having a
[1:38:24] knowledge of something and having a
[1:38:26] revelation of something
[1:38:28] even to us in our human understanding we
[1:38:31] can know something but we can we can
[1:38:34] also have a revelation of something
[1:38:36] knowing something is just a passing
[1:38:37] knowledge
[1:38:39] maybe that's like science or medicine
[1:38:41] right you know science might think they
[1:38:44] know exactly perfect well and then
[1:38:46] somebody comes out tomorrow and says
[1:38:48] well no it's this way right oh you know
[1:38:50] what you're right
[1:38:52] they thought the atom was the smallest
[1:38:54] thing that there ever was until they
[1:38:55] split it up and found a whole bunch of
[1:38:56] stuff inside of it and there and
[1:38:58] installed a whole nother science thing
[1:39:00] the world
[1:39:01] and then and then that became the
[1:39:03] absolute
[1:39:04] oh we're scientists see look what we did
[1:39:06] yeah well 20 years ago you were saying
[1:39:08] that was nothing smaller than the atom
[1:39:10] now what are you saying
[1:39:11] see so
[1:39:13] you understand you can go on and on
[1:39:15] medicine same way
[1:39:17] medical doctors they learn all the time
[1:39:19] but god doesn't he's perfect amen he's
[1:39:22] not learning he's all-knowing
[1:39:24] yeah praise the lord
[1:39:27] only those who are redeemable
[1:39:30] all those who was redeemable back to the
[1:39:33] quote here believed it
[1:39:35] because they were the thoughts of god
[1:39:39] the attributes of him at the beginning
[1:39:41] was made flesh and redeemable and was
[1:39:44] brought back to god
[1:39:47] redeemable
[1:39:48] redeemed brought back to god they were
[1:39:52] redeemable and was brought back to god
[1:39:55] as many as received him to them gave he
[1:39:58] power to become the sons of god
[1:40:00] because
[1:40:03] they were redeemable
[1:40:06] amen praise the lord see jesus again
[1:40:12] you didn't become seed
[1:40:14] because you become born again
[1:40:18] amen you were born again because you
[1:40:21] were seen that's right
[1:40:23] you got to understand which one came
[1:40:25] first which one has the has the
[1:40:27] precedent over the other the seed has
[1:40:30] the precedent
[1:40:31] not the border
[1:40:33] i became sick i was born again no no no
[1:40:35] you became born again because you
[1:40:36] received
[1:40:38] you were redeemable
[1:40:40] that's how you could come to this
[1:40:42] because you were already redeemable
[1:40:44] because you were that place in god's
[1:40:46] mind that god put that little part down
[1:40:49] in you amen
[1:40:52] they were there from the beginning in
[1:40:53] the expression he said oh if we can stop
[1:40:55] here a moment if it would be possible
[1:40:57] think of that tonight the message of the
[1:40:59] hour the expressed
[1:41:02] thoughts of jehovah
[1:41:05] expressed
[1:41:06] thoughts of jehovah and that's exactly
[1:41:09] what we are today we are the expression
[1:41:13] of the thoughts of jehovah
[1:41:15] now you're looking at an old nasty human
[1:41:18] flesh
[1:41:19] but in here in there
[1:41:22] lies the expression
[1:41:24] that was the thought of god jehovah
[1:41:26] elohim from the beginning
[1:41:28] that's how he chose you
[1:41:30] amen amen
[1:41:32] that's how he decided
[1:41:34] that that was that who you were to be
[1:41:37] amen
[1:41:38] and then the predestination unfolded who
[1:41:41] you were what's your name family and all
[1:41:44] those things all came through that
[1:41:45] predestination god had a purpose god had
[1:41:48] a plan
[1:41:49] amen it's like when i went through the
[1:41:51] gifts of the spirit even and talked
[1:41:53] about the five-fold ministry and and the
[1:41:56] reason i believe the reason why why god
[1:42:00] puts different gifts in different
[1:42:02] individuals
[1:42:03] because he prepared that individual
[1:42:06] for that gift from their birth
[1:42:09] from their childhood from the home they
[1:42:11] were brought up into the parents that
[1:42:13] they had that their their nature
[1:42:16] was brought into that place yo brother
[1:42:19] brown describes the different name even
[1:42:20] the different natures between say and of
[1:42:23] different natures of ministry between an
[1:42:25] evangelist and a pastor
[1:42:30] and that's why god that's why all this
[1:42:32] exists
[1:42:34] that's why you are who you are yes
[1:42:36] that's why we have to pray daily lord
[1:42:38] let not my will your will be done yes
[1:42:41] what would you have me to do
[1:42:44] where would you lead me to go who would
[1:42:46] you have me to talk to and i'm not
[1:42:48] talking about that there's some great
[1:42:50] event that happens every day
[1:42:53] there might be one time brother adams
[1:42:55] even said in a gift of the spirit he
[1:42:57] said god might operate that tongues or
[1:42:59] that prophecy one time in your life and
[1:43:01] never again right one time
[1:43:05] amen
[1:43:06] that means we don't still serve a
[1:43:07] purpose but that might have been the one
[1:43:09] thing god had placed only you could do
[1:43:12] at that place at that time and whatever
[1:43:15] the result was
[1:43:17] that was for you
[1:43:18] amen that's why we're here
[1:43:21] that's why god's called us that's why
[1:43:22] god's predestinated us that's what god
[1:43:24] redeemed us that's why god revealed
[1:43:26] himself and oh it's just on and on and
[1:43:28] on amen but that's who we really are yes
[1:43:32] amen not the man you're looking at
[1:43:35] not the people i'm looking at
[1:43:37] amen but the real the real us
[1:43:40] is him
[1:43:42] the eternity
[1:43:43] from the beginning
[1:43:45] that he expressed
[1:43:47] in this world today i am looking at the
[1:43:50] expression i believe
[1:43:52] the expression of jehovah god right now
[1:43:56] amen you believe that amen amen let's
[1:44:00] stand if we could
[1:44:07] appraisal i believe that amen i believe
[1:44:10] that's who god made me i believe that's
[1:44:12] what god put me here and intended me to
[1:44:14] be yes
[1:44:17] do i make mistakes oh absolutely do i
[1:44:19] fall short all the time
[1:44:22] doesn't make me less of who god wanted
[1:44:24] me to call me to be yes amen doesn't
[1:44:27] does it take me out of the family of god
[1:44:29] yes
[1:44:31] it doesn't make me less of a person
[1:44:33] doesn't make me less in the mind of god
[1:44:36] amen
[1:44:36] i still am who i am by the grace of god
[1:44:39] the abundant
[1:44:41] the abundant grace of god
[1:44:43] not that not not as a disgrace
[1:44:46] but the grace of god yes has called me
[1:44:48] to be who i am called you to be who you
[1:44:51] are

[1:51:56] from a couple of people but i do want to
[1:51:58] try to have a brother's breakfast on
[1:52:00] saturday january 8th at the denny's here

[1:52:11] uh at the denny's here i want to have
[1:52:13] breakfast there with the brothers i'm
[1:52:15] trying to give an advance notice enough
[1:52:17] that hopefully
[1:52:19] more will be able to make it but i hope
[1:52:21] all the brothers
[1:52:22] part of this church hope you all can
[1:52:24] make it
[1:52:25] but saturday morning january 8th
[1:52:27] and this has been on my heart for a
[1:52:29] while
[1:52:30] so this has nothing to do with what
[1:52:32] happened in service today or last week
[1:52:34] or whatever but it's been on my heart
[1:52:36] for a while starting the new year then
[1:52:38] next sunday
[1:52:41] i want us to get back to
[1:52:44] pardon me i want to get back to writing
[1:52:46] down the prayer requests and the praise
[1:52:48] reports
[1:52:50] out
[1:52:51] amen and not have
[1:52:53] john or me or whoever
[1:52:56] call out for prayer requests and and
[1:52:58] praise reports anymore if you if you get
[1:53:01] here in time to write them down write it
[1:53:03] down if you don't if you need to write
[1:53:05] it down on a piece of paper if you're at
[1:53:07] home or in your car or just come in or
[1:53:09] something it doesn't have to be on that
[1:53:11] pad uh but write it down we'll get it up
[1:53:14] here uh to be read behind the pulpit so
[1:53:17] that uh it gets red
[1:53:19] and then so we can get to the i'm sorry
[1:53:22] yeah and you can you can always text the
[1:53:24] the three or four the two or three i
[1:53:27] wrote down today most of those were
[1:53:29] texts to me
[1:53:31] like i didn't even know sister
[1:53:32] tamblington had passed away tablet the
[1:53:34] text and let me know
[1:53:35] brother john texted me yesterday and
[1:53:37] well actually john told me thursday that
[1:53:39] brother luke had passed away but he
[1:53:41] asked cheryl didn't want me to announce
[1:53:43] until after she had told
[1:53:45] uh their congregation or
[1:53:47] whoever what she wanted to tell but he
[1:53:49] texted me
[1:53:51] it was yesterday christmas and said it
[1:53:54] was okay to announce it
[1:53:56] so that's why i write it down so when i
[1:53:58] get in here in the morning i put them
[1:54:01] out but i want to try to keep a little
[1:54:02] more order a little more structure to
[1:54:04] the service
[1:54:06] so if you have prayer requests or praise
[1:54:09] reports write them down and uh whoever's
[1:54:12] leading the songs we'll read them and
[1:54:14] we'll go from there so that we can we
[1:54:16] can keep it that way so i did that
[1:54:19] year and a half ago or so and then covet
[1:54:21] came and
[1:54:22] we bounced different places and things
[1:54:24] got a little looser again and we didn't
[1:54:27] have a place to put the things to write
[1:54:29] them down very conveniently and also
[1:54:32] but now we do
[1:54:34] our building and
[1:54:35] everything we have it all so i wanted to
[1:54:38] start instituting i felt like lord put
[1:54:40] that on my heart actually probably a
[1:54:41] month or two ago uh to try to start
[1:54:44] doing that again so
[1:54:45] uh please if you're listening uh if you
[1:54:48] have a prayer request next sunday i want
[1:54:49] to start instituting that next sunday uh
[1:54:52] we're not going to open the floor for
[1:54:54] prayer requests this is something just
[1:54:57] deathly urgent or something
[1:54:59] and
[1:55:00] praise reports or if you have a song we
[1:55:02] have pat over there if you have a
[1:55:04] special song that you want to sing and
[1:55:06] write it down and give it to the song
[1:55:08] leader then we know
[1:55:09] and it's there so
[1:55:12] so just we just want to keep that a
[1:55:14] little a little more structured
[1:55:20] uh anymore but i i don't want to offend
[1:55:23] him more than anything he put that on my
[1:55:25] heart and like i said we did it back
[1:55:27] when and it was going good and then
[1:55:30] covet and all that so anyway i want to
[1:55:32] get back to doing that so
[1:55:34] so i appreciate everyone's cooperation
[1:55:36] and love and prayers about that so
[1:55:38] amen love the lord jesus amen amen
[1:55:42] praise the lord from time to time i
[1:55:44] still let it still feel in my heart to
[1:55:47] ask if anybody has something on your
[1:55:49] heart to say after service i might still
[1:55:51] do that
[1:55:52] but
[1:55:54] i just do that as i feel led to do so
[1:55:56] i don't always do it you might notice
[1:55:58] but i do it like i said i do it as i
[1:56:00] feel loved to do and if i don't do it
[1:56:03] apologize but uh
[1:56:05] anyway so
[1:56:07] i i don't want to stifle the holy spirit
[1:56:15] keep it in order the way the way the
