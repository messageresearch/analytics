in a nation that we can still have the freedoms and liberties that we do to worship the lord advertise on our door on out front and come in and worship without the fear of imprisonment or arrest or persecution although it seems like chris christian persecution is becoming more and more rampant across the country now but god protects his own yes he's watching over protecting us but i'm still very thankful to live in a country uh that we have the freedoms and liberties that we do that god blessed us with amen so lord richly bless you let's stand to our feet up with goodness i'm going to invite

lord you could be seated if you like amen i know it seems like they said that the patriotism i guess of our country is kind of diminished to a point but you know i just attribute it sometimes to um it's kind of like having skin in the game as they would say you know back when this country was founded and men and women fought for its freedom they had skin in the game it's kind of like church amen if you don't have skin in the game it's just a place to come sometimes you know you know it doesn't really mean a whole lot but if you give of your time and your effort and your finances and your prayers and all that you do for it then you've got skin in the game that means something to you yes amen when you got it the same thing in this country they had skin in the gay literal life depended on it uh patrick henry give me your liberty or give me death amen you know because if they had been caught and the british had won they would have been hung and uh whatever other manner of death they would have put to them but uh but thank god there had to be a freedom of liberty you know they had it today and i believe it was the same thing it's like serving in the military or something like that those men and women they have they have skin in the game they they respect it because they fought for its freedoms uh and today is i believe it's the same thing spiritually so i believe that's why we're here today too yes so we'll just sing us songs today worship him amen expect him to be with us praise the lord let's sing this on the screen it's not in it's this one's not in our song book here

looking for a catching away but without that token amen without that spirit life without that new birth yes you'll be here when the bride goes home yeah amen amen praise the lord that uh holy spirit that new birth that's our ticket home yes praise the lord can't enter that ship without it can't get on that train without it praise the lord amen if there's ever an emphasis that we should have in this world this life today that is it amen everything that's going on everybody puts great emphasis on all these other things of the world friend if there's one emphasis that humanity should have today is to get born again amen get that spirit get born again of the holy spirit of god amen amen that's the only thing jesus said you must amen he didn't make it a an option he made it a prerequisite you must be born again all right praise the lord praise god amen we'll go live in prayer now take a prayer request didn't look like there was any over there i didn't have any uh i didn't get any prayer requests from this morning we want to remember a couple of the prayer requests that we had this past week please continue to remember sister uh sister julian prayer she's still struggling with some uh physical issues that she's just it's been very tough on her um so please remember her in prayer um going into detail unless she asked me to about it but she's been struggling mightily with some physical issues so please uh please remember sister julie in prayer we also want to continue remember sister savannah in prayer and maybe or uh cheyenne excuse me well all of them all the frauds of course all of us but cheyenne we um whether whether she ever goes back home or not i want to hear right amen and i want to see her back in church that's to me that's what matters the most family's fine that's all good but there's a time you leave family and we've all left family almost all of them at some point in time but the main thing is to be in in the house of the lord and serving and worshiping the lord so that's the thing that matters the most so please continue to remember her in prayer amen sister matisse had her did you have a prayer request yeah i do my daughter and i had a falling out based on some lies that were told when she was 12 years old she was born in 1981 and i'm arguing with a 12 year old child's memory and she didn't have all the facts and and it's just split us up and um i'm just i tried to present it to her and anyway it's i'm just praying that god would just intervene in some way and and um allow us to she cut me off so i was praying that god um you know i gave her the proof i gave her the proof that those were lies and um and i just i'm just praying that god will just i'm gonna send her a letter and just pray that god will just help us through this amen so that you can be healed i believe he will especially have her heal because she's dealing with some beliefs that are incorrect amen i appreciate your prayers for me in fact maybe at the end of service i'll have some of your brothers come my shoulder neck here is just absolutely excruciating um killing me even now but by the grace of god we press forward but uh it might it just happens i don't know why every three or four months or something i slouch or whatever i do or i don't know uh it can be one side or the other but this time i barely was able to take a shower this morning uh but i appreciate your prayers for that if you would amen it just kind of goes down my back and takes my breath away even but um but by the grace of god amen by his stripes we are healed amen anyone have an unspoken request on your heart this hurts brother let's stand brother dennis would you pray for these needs today lord jesus in unison with our heads and our hearts for your presence your holy presence knowing that father you're mindful of each and every one yes you're not partial you're not one to select certain ones and reject others long we come through your precious blood we're all excited yes amen and lord i was reading about paul was talking about i have no confidence in the flesh and me the more so paul was saying by hebrew hebrews circumcised by the the benjamin and tribe and just just brought up um with the scriptures and knowing it back backwards and forwards and then he recognized as he met you a living god you have to lose all that you have to die to himself that you may be able to use them for your honor and for your glory how much more should it speak to our hearts that we need to die out we need to be out of the way that you may be able to work your holy spirit your will in us father and i'm even convinced that much more as our pastor even said already i'll make the hour and people's hearts are failing for fear and people are wondering uh how much worse can it get and we know according to your word the ones that reject your word your vindicated truth for this day the worst is yet to come and lord help us to recognize to put you first to be dedicated to be consecrated truth we say lord that we want to be better christians but let our hearts speak for itself not just words but just fall uh yes deaf ears but let it be our living truth lord in this late hour lord unless you reveal yourself to us we're going to continue the way we are it's like brother brown and your prophet said it's not the big things were we failed god it's the little things we leave undone and and how he said how can i teach you algebra if you don't know your abcs and lord speak to our hearts we're here in your house to draw closer to you to become better christians to be better prepared for a rapture amen it's a reality only to the bride your prophet said and lord there are some that are sick this morning that need a touch from you our sister julie at home screaming lord oh may you come under sea and give her her heart's desire may you deliver from all that she's going through for thou art truly a high priest that can be touched by the feelings of our infirmities and with your sights we are healed and made that healing touch reach out to each and every one that needs a touch from you father may our hearts burn within us when we know as we pray that you met us along the way father oh lord all the unspoken uh uh requests all the hands and hearts so we're lifted up to you may you grant them their hearts desire according to your word that their joys may be full that their cup runeth over that the testimonies will come forth and you're truly with us yes you have not forsaken us you're truly the same yesterday today yes forever thank you lord bless our pastor father that's why we're here not to be seen or to see one another but to hear your word preach to let us grow in a stature of a perfect man yes father to let your word come forth as a sword of faith
