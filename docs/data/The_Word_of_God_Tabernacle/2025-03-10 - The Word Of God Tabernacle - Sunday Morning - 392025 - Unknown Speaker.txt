when we get over there won't be any prayer requests to mention be a lot of praising going on Amen no prayer requests thank the Lord for that amen praise the Lord Jesus this world is not my home amen we need to continue to remember that too amen praise the Lord let's sing it this world is not my home I'm just a passing through my treasures are laid up somewhere beyond the blue the Angels beckon me from Heaven's open door and I can feel at home in this world anymore oh Lord you know I have no friend like you if Heaven's not my home dear Lord what will I do the Angels beckon me from Heaven's open door and I can feel at Hope in this world anymore they're all expecting me and that's one thing I know I fixed it up with Jesus many years ago I know he'll see me through though I am weak and poor and I I can't feel at home in this world anymore oh Lord you know I have no friend like you if Heaven's not my home dear Lord what will I do the Angels beckon me from Heaven's open door and I can't feel at home in this world anymore we just over in the glory land will live eternally the Saints on every hand are shouting Victory the song of sweetest praise drift back from Heaven Shore and I can't feel at home with this world anymore oh Lord you know I have no friend like you if Heaven's not my home dear Lord what will I do the Angels beckon me from Heaven's open door and I can't feel at home in this world anymore oh Lord you know I have no friend like you if Heaven's not my home dear Lord what will I do the Angels Be Me from heaven open door and I can't feel at home in this world anymore no I can't feel at home in this world anymore amen praise the Lord my isn't that the true Saints praise the Lord there was a time where you felt more comfortable amen walking the streets and going shopping and but you realize more and more every day this this world is pulling away amen the bride's pulling away she's becoming less and less like this world Amen and more and more like Jesus Christ the more we become like Christ the less you'll be like this world because this world is becoming more and more demonic every day I help I'm so glad this world's not my home this this world Cosmos is not where we belong amen praise the Lord we're sojourners pilgrims and sojourners here amen praise the Lord so thankful of that amen mik said he had a testimony for us today so amen we're going to give him time to do that now God bless you um a quick well kind of a quick testimony there's a lot of details to it it's not M personal but it's a friend of mine who's not a Christian or a Believer but I I felt it enough to share with everyone um about three weeks ago um my friend art had uh what they thought or what he thought was was a like a stomach clue some virus that's been going on throwing up been sick and went to the hospital and they didn't do any checks or anything they just went off of what he said and he think it was a s virus so they gave him some antia stuff and sent him home and then like a week later it it it happened again but at worse um in incredibly terrible pain and and nausea and despite medication and stuff so they took him to the emergency room again it turned out they he had appendicitis um but there was an abscess on theend on the appendix um and what he was experiencing was appendicitis and not a flu a stomach flu stomach virus his appendix had actually first but because the abscess was on the appendix itself it already had the capsule kind of a pimple for the not familiar what the what an absess is but the body creates like a barrier around something um so when the appendix burst the abscess caught it so that it didn't spread through his body oh my and the likelihood of that happening in the way that it did is just absolutely Miracle just typically as most of you probably know if you have a a ptis and at first you have minutes till you go to the sepsis and die so it's only a miracle that he had the abess growing on the appendix so that when it did burst they caught it kind of like a balloon and saved his life so he has a he has a drain in it now and it's draining because they can't take it out till it's drained so it's for five days or so but Tuesday he's supposed to go get the draining removed and check and make sure that it's they can take it out wow my goodness what a testimony you imagine goodness that's you would think the worst thing in the world is to have an abess growing on an organ or or theual organ in your body and wow that thing needs to be removed well it's a good thing he didn't have it removed because it sounds like that could have been what saved his life M well God knows amen there's always a reason there a reason the Lord does this reason the Lord put mik in his life you never know amen God's always in control God's always in charge we just let him keep doing it just keep walking the walk as he Footsteps in front of us that's all we know to do amen but that's the best thing we can do praise the Lord people talk about all the time this that the other and and I understand finding the will of the Lord in life AB absolutely you know but sometimes sometimes it's just a matter of taking a step at a time and just trusting him amen just take another step and just keep trusting him let him take care of it amen praise the Lord some people sometimes people call it Blind Faith um it really is you trust the Lord Jesus emphatically you know he's going to take care of you period and that's I guess that's Blind Faith that's all right as long as the faith is there amen that's what matters praise the Lord the Lord Jesus in our lives amen yeah sister she would you give brother's amen uh why don't you give um I can read it uh he brother Paul was diagnosed with u uh he was in stage four um I forget some of the details that's why it was um Let me let me just read it be easier as sister sheilia gave it to me uh she talked to Sister Margaret uh the doctor's appointment Tuesday told Brother Paul's cancer is still getting smaller brother Paul S well the Paul sar's cancer is still getting smaller uh he's been one month off of Keo chemo infusion treatments they want to see him in May to check again uh starting from white blood cell this is Sister sheilia is writing here starting from white blood cell leukemia two weeks 3 months months to live and how long this was six a year ago three months three months ago okay I knew it had been a while uh he was given two weeks two weeks to live three uh three months ago correct yeah uh we know God is answering prayer and uh the cancer is going away it's getting smaller Brother Paul's still with us and we thank the Lord Jesus that God is the Healer amen even of cancer God is still the Healer praise the Lord the cancer is still getting smaller even after being off the chemo infusion treatments praise the Lord amen God is good amen so thankful for brother Paul Sister Margaret SAR just a wonderful testimony healing of cancer amen God is good anybody else amen praise the Lord not we'll just stand to our feet then and well we'll go to the scripture and Lord willing we try to leave off of where we uh pick up sort of where we left off last time uh we're on adoption part seven uh this is maturity part two uh and growing to maturity as a Christian grows to maturity that's the whole point of Jesus saying be ye therefore perfect that whole part of adoption is maturity amen being mature Christians praise the Lord so we're going to Matthew uh St Matthew Chapter 5 we're going to begin our scripture reading there again Matthew chapter 5: 48 amen Matthew 5 verse 48 Matthew 5:48 we'll read that scripture amen before we do could we just bow our heads for another word of prayer precious Lord Jesus father again we're so thankful Lord of your blessings so thank than F God that you're with us so thankful of these testimonies so thankful that to know God that you're still real and that you still work miracles and that you are a miracle working God you're still a Healer you're still a savior Lord all the great attributes we know you to be through the scripture father you are as much of those now as you have ever been to every one of us Lord God it's not exclusive Lord Jesus to just our for and no more Lord you are good to all of of us Lord and we're so thankful for it God that's why we can call on your name Lord for even family that may not serve you or friends that may not know you or or even pets and things God that's in our lives Lord that just is special to us Lord because we know Lord if it's special to us it's special to you because we're special to you Lord and God we know that you're mindful of us and that you're always with us God thank you for the blessings of your word thank you for the revelation of that word thank you thank you Lord for the acknowledgement God of our growth in your spirit and the growth in your word and we grow in the in in the uh uh the knowledge of the word Lord may you continue to speak to us Lord and reveal to us that word and that that word help us to mature every day in our lives help it grow Lord in our lives God that we can become the very embodiment of Jesus Christ on this Earth today let others see Jesus Through us when we walk this planet know there's something different when we see our friends families workers relatives they know there's something different Lord because it's you in us but more than that God I pray that you'd put a thirst in every one of them to have what we have to get what we have Lord that's the main thing God not just that we're different but that they Lord can have what we have and recognize how important that is and recognize a true peace and a true joy and a true love and life God that people think they have today without you but no way you can have it without you lord may you bless the remain part of the service God we commit it into your hands we may be few in number Lord but we know God that we're Mighty through you Lord and we believe God that we're to through gathered in your name you're there in the midst have your way in this service speak to us now from your word Lord show us in here what you'd have us to see and know we'll be careful to thank you and praise you worship you for all of it in the lovely holy name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ we pray amen amen Matthew chapter 5:48 we'll read this one scripture let you be seated Matthew 548 Jesus said be ye therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect and you could be seated if you'd like amen we know what that Perfection means praise the Lord so uh we know that means a full age mature uh let's go over to Hebrews we've read this scripture once here we went through it did not delve into it quite as much but Hebrews chapter 5 uh verse 8 we're going to start our context from today or our text if you will Matthew chap 5 uh verse 8 speaking starting back from that maturity bringing us on Lord willing from where we left off the last time we before last amen of this place of maturity Matthew 5:8 Matthew 5:8 there uh though he were a son yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered learned amen amen remember learning to become mature is a learning process that's why we grow in Grace and in knowledge amen learning is a growth process praise the Lord as you as you grow you learn amen though he were a son even a son learned obedience by the things which he suffered being made perfect and being made being made perfect amen now that word is a different word same root word but a different meaning of the word this word also means to be uh perfect but it it it but the def is to be finished completed reached its final End Amen or uh complete or or as we a lot of times use the word perfect as imperfect a sinless Perfection we know Jesus Christ obviously was sinlessly perfect amen took on the form of human flesh but he himself was perfect praise the Lord so we know in that Perfection he was made Amen to be perfect to bring it to an end if you will to finish completion praise the Lord and that's what we're expecting looking for of all of our Lives all of our Lives Jesus was born that way but Jesus was born that way so he could come live bleed die and come back so that we could reach the same Perfection that he was Amen to bring us to that completion Amen to bring us to the place that we reach the Fulfillment or finishing of our lives and that finishing is the two wit full Redemption of the Redemption of our bodies The Taking of our bodies when we leave this place amen we get to that place of of of finishment of bringing to a completion an end oh my I just look forward to that so much amen Jesus being perfect amen now at Ninth verse being made perfect he became the author of author of Eternal salvation unto all them that obey him called of God an high priest after the order of MDC we know of course that that same logos amen that came out of God that form of God that uh logos of God that came out of God Amen uh first showed himself in mzc obviously then 11th first down of whom we have many things to say and hard to be uttered or difficult to explain seeing that you are dull of hearing and that makes it understandable if a person hasn't reached the place of receiving uh the full maturity of a message uh it would just go right over their heads amen like I said the other day if you try if you tried to bring a message just really somewhat simple I I would call it that that this is you try to bring something even probably as simply as this to like a a denominational church or something or Catholic church Baptist uh they would have no idea probably what you're talking about most of them would anyway would have no idea what you're talking about it' go right over their heads well Paul is saying the same thing here the Hebrew letter said uh there's many things that we would like to say and talk about the relationship between Jesus and MDC but I can't do it because you I can't it's difficult to explain to you because you're slothful in your you're learning you're hearing that's what dull means is slothful he saying you can't if you're not going to receive it why would I explain it now we know that we've reached the place of this age or the ending of this age enter into the bride age where this bride now has got to the place that God sent her a prophet Messenger to preach to us Christ is the mystery of God revealed or and I should say not or who is this MDC amen now why did God send a prophet Messenger to bring a message to this Bride for this last day called who is this mzc to bring an understanding of what Paul was talking about here that they could not understand because it went over their head because do we the bride today has reached that place we've come to that place the Bride is a hole of a place of maturity where they could receive that word maybe it wasn't exactly at the time that brother Brandon preached it maybe not but he knew that God told him to store up this food to store up in the storehouse these messages so then it comes to the time of getting to the end of that age and now we're almost 60 years after brother Bam's even been gone gone not not here with us but it's been almost 60 years since he left us amen so you can imagine see these these messages these nuggets these these this food that was stored up was ministered over 60 years ago and now we're receiving it been been for years I wouldn't say just right now but uh the bride uh through this maturing time has come to the place that they recognize and receive now you click on who is this mezd a light goes off it it it it it it it it anchors into your soul I was going to say it makes sense but that that's not that making sense doesn't even describe what it does to the bride for this word when this word comes forth you listen to it and you say well that makes sense but that really doesn't even describe it that word coming into you elevates your spirit elevates your life so to the place of maturity that just making sense doesn't even do it justice it it it just comes and it it it elevates you it brings you to a place in the spirit of God and and drawing your relation the whole point is to draw a relationship uh closer to the Lord Jesus that's I mean that's the whole point really it's making sure that our relationship with the Lord becomes more solidified than ever every time we pray every time we go to church every time we listen to a word preached a message spoke whatever it is uh it it elevates us and brings us closer and closer and more and more to that place and that's what we want in line because that's what we need out of life amen people want to live it up people don't know what live it up means until you've come to this place to where Christ comes into your life and begins to speak to you and reveal his word to you and bring you to the place of understanding so when you click on who is this mezic when you click on Christ and mystery God revealed you click on those it it feeds you amen because you're not looking to drink a gallon of milk you're looking to eat a T-bone steak I say T-Bone all the time my favorite State's Riv I don't know why I use T-Bone all the time grandma t- that was my mom's favorite my mom lik T-Bone talk about T-Bones all the time rii is my favorite uh fine glass milk's okay but it's that meat praise the lord it's the meat of the word he couldn't do it here he said I I would love to say many things to you if I could paraphrase this for a second I'd love to say many things to you but it's difficult to explain to you because you're dull of hearing or slothful of hearing you can't receive it amen but praise God he sent a message for this last day because remember all through this all through these Church ages we've got to that place amen that we'll we'll talk up in just a minute that was stepping stones to bring us to where we are today all those early ages were just to bring us that they're all bride we don't discount that they're not they're absolutely everyone from the first church age to today all bride that were bride in those ages not every age was bride but the ones that were in that age that were bride was bride just like we are but they were just Stepping Stones to get to the place of where we are today amen that's why if you go to a denomination that was built by a messenger uh uh 800 years ago they're not going to understand because they're still preaching that the just shall live by faith and where that is good and that is scriptural and we still like and receive the just D still live by faith uh we we've continued on uh taking that bill building block with us to a place of perfection a place of maturity and not just that we're down here and you hear any NE this preaches they're just dull of hearing they can't receive it it goes over their heads and a lot of times they say well if my church doesn't preach it it's you know it's not right or if it's not from my denomination then it's not right or you know that's spirits in the message too right that's not just denomination amen because denomination Spirit has eat this message up Saints this denomination spirit is all over the message he said if it's not like this oh we got to listen to Joseph if he doesn't say it then it it's not right it's not the messeng if you don't come to our church you know we just take you out from under the blood you're not even a Christian anymore if you don't come here you don't tell me that denomination is not existing in this message it does yes amen you tell them any truth any spiritual revealed truth the message the word it goes right over their heads and don't want to hear it a lot of times don't want to hear it but don't hear it Paul said I'd love to explain it to you but it's difficult to explain because you don't listen you're dull of hearing slothful of hearing 12th verse now for when for the time you ought to be teachers he's saying now he's saying right now you should be teaching but for the time you ought to be teachers ye have need that one teach you again my so what did they learn what did they learn what have you learned if you've been taught but you have to be taught again that means that what you were taught the first time did not take did not uh connect it did not take effect at least you're not living it you're not preaching it you're not believing it amen CU it needs so when you should be teachers you're being taught again which be the first principles of the Oracles of God and are become he's telling now you are become such as have need of milk and not of strong meat amen bottle be fed off the bottle again simple little things things that we know to be true things that we still preach amen baptisms amen gifts of the Spirit things like that amen we don't need to we do take that as scripture and we do teach it because it should be taught but it's not something that that that a mature bride needs to understand how these things should be we should know how they are these gifts and how they should operate we should know we should know what the steps of process of Salvation are we should know where we come into Christ at that and what the Lord does to us in that position it all should be plain to us now amen we should be able to use those the Stepping Stones as we get to the place that the full maturity of the word is now ministered to a bride because she can receive it she could not receive it then and dar I say like I did the other day they probably didn't receive it even when brother Brandon was preaching it at that time but thank God that message is is Thor in the storehouses so we can go listen to it and God can minister to us and God can reveal that word to us and you can start recognizing that God is using you to bring you along as a mature Christian bring us along to a finish to a completion amen that completion Romans 8 amen is that completion praise the Lord to it the Redemption of our bodies become such as have need of milk and not strong meat for everyone that uses milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness for he is a babe in other words not mature amen babes babies children not mature is basically what he's saying you have come to place you of of your of not being mature amen for you use milk because you're unskillful or unknowledgeable in the word of righteousness but strong meat belongeth to them that are a full age there's that mature there's that perfect that he's talking about same root word as we just read of Jesus being perfect but it means a full age wanting nothing of necessity for completeness full grown adult that's what it means full age perfect strong meat belongeth to them that are perfect of full age even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil now 6th chapter first verse we'll keep reading therefore what does he say now he says therefore we've left we've left off of the other we've grown into maturity uh feasting on strong meat praise the Lord therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ amen let us go on unto Perfection again same word praise the Lord same word Perfection maturity let us go on to be mature Christians if you will not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and a faith towards God this age was burn forth of isus Street and the and the returning of the gifts and the speaking of tongues and the the the prophecy and and all the gifts manifesting themselves to the place that people just uh as they had that gift that was poured out on people uh it's it's like trying to it's like trying to go into the shower wearing a shower cap to not get your hair wet amen when the water dumps on you it dumps on everything and that's what the spirit of God did and people just went off W with all the gifts operating all over the place people would stand up in the midddle of uh of brother Brandon preaching and just stand up and start speaking in tongues why childish that's childish friend right mean God's not in that when the word is being brought forth that word has the preeminence right amen every other Spirit take subjection to that word amen even the speaking of tongues people would stand up start prophesying people stand up speak in tongues and then try to prophesy interpret the the speaking in tongues all the gifts of operation all those things but childish amen childish with it that's the whole thing they would be childish with it but that's how it was born how was it born it was born a baby like everything it's born is born a baby when something's born it's born a baby if it's a seed of botney life if it's a seed of animal life if it's a seed of human life when it comes forth and it's birth forth It's a 80 every time it's got some growing to do and that body had growing to do praise the Lord this age had growing to do that's why brother Brandon was born about the exact same time Amen to bring about that exact same thing to grow forth into the maturity of the age that we're living in now which is the separation of the Bride from the World which is the separation from the bride and the church because the bride has moved on into maturity the church is down here jabbering about with their tongues and and all the gifts and things and there's nothing wrong with the gifts when they're in order when they're done right in operation and it is of God Amen when it is of god then that's okay praise the Lord but this gone on and about and forth we'll just read it we we'll get to it in a minute but now we gone on into Perfection not laying again the foundation repentance from dead works and of Faith towards god of the doctrine of baptisms and of laying on of hands and resurrection of the dead and of Eternal judgment and this will we do if God permit why because it's time to go on into Perfection it's time for the bride to go on into that maturity to go on into that place of this is the completion friend we're there's not another age after this one we are not we are not a stepping stone we are not an inart message Age We Are The mature age we are the completion we are the finishing now the seventh Church age with the church goes on into predition but the bride in the bride age she goes up in a Rapture because she reaches that place of maturity she reaches that place where God is bringing her to to receive that word to receive that message to receive that truth and that truth changing her and making her more like Christ every day this bride goes into a Rapture the church goes into predition amen but the bride goes out of here she's the one that God was perfect bringing to that place of maturity we're not worried about laying uh uh uh all these things that the the foundations of of of what we know we still observe ordinances if somebody wants to come get baptized or uh communion footwash and those things but just continuing on with what now you know that you should be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ not father Son and Holy Ghost you know what if I just took the next six services and just make sure and we just talk about that you know that we're not going to go back and lay that back out again amen we've reached the places beyond that hopefully prayerfully we've all been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we've all been born again of the spirit of God coming and living and becoming the permanent resent of your soul hopefully we've all gotten to that place you a said maybe the children that are younger than that but we've all come to that place amen because that's that time that's the time that we're living we're living at that day we're living in that age right now amen trying to do God a service without his will he said now notice I'm skip some of this it's very treacherous a very treacherous text if you don't get it right I feel this part I want to say brother said I feel that the hour is coming dares I say the hour is now Saints the hour is now it's not yesterday it's not tomorrow the hour is now praise the Lord that I feel that we should be men and women instead of babies we should have strong meat instead of milk praise the Lord I believe that too I believe you all get to that place we've all get to the place place that we can receive that that God can Minister that to us because we're mature Christians we don't have to worry about understanding of the the the simple things that the laid the foundation but the things that God continues to help us to grow with to help us to become more like him with just like the things we were just talking about that brings us along to the place that we understand who we are amen you you remember what brother bam said happens when this Bride Comes to know who she is do you know you remember what he said about that what happens to the bride that comes to the place that she knows who she is she will be an invincible Army the devil can do anything and everything to her but he will leave defeated because she will be when this Bride Comes to the place that she knows who she is she will be an invincible Army praise God this bride is getting to the place hopefully we are at that place where when brother Bram said this bride she will have thus sayith the Lord or she will shut up she will have thus sayith the Lord from God or she will be quiet she'll set still amen thus sayeth the Lord this is God's word this is God speaking this is God to us amen that's thus sayith the Lord when brother bam said thus sayith the Lord that meant that was a direct communication from God thus sayeth the Lord she'll have not just brother Bram see all so many people they want to keep putting everything on brother Bram no no no no brother Bram said she who she the bride Amen brother R's been gone like I said almost 60 years coming up on 60 years been gone he didn't say him he said she the bride and let me tell you friend brother branon wasn't the only bride member he wasn't the only one that comprised of the Bride for this last day by the way if you go into a church like I was talking about earlier and you even use that use that phraseology of the Bride th just that would probably send people heading to the exits and wonder what is this man talking about what is where is he going with this and don't even realize that that's what the scripture calls us right I I would dare us to say that a lot of Christian prob themselves Christian people today probably don't even know that that phraseology of bride is even in the scripture don't even know it I remember read read one part of the article that that man wrote in dissension of the message they went around and interviewed these churches and people and stuff and found out some of the horrible things that happened in the name of the message he put in there that that things like the message and the bride were used as that was some kind of cuss word that was some kind of word of dissension some kind of word to make us sound like freaky people when it's in when it's scriptural he has no idea no idea it's even in the Bible it's the word scripture what is this bride this bride is the Bride of Jesus Christ and she's got to that place where she's thus sayith the Lord or she's or she's sitting still amen thus said that's maturity remember power without character is satanic power so we say that a lot Power without character satanic amen but let me ask you this question what is power with character if power without character is satanic what is power with character I'd say it's Godly if power without character is satanic then power with character is Godly well we try to bring these phrases and these things that we talk all the time that make some uh great something or whatever it's really simple it's just a matter of the bride having thus sayith the Lord power with character she's got the character why because she's a grown woman she knows how to handle the word she knows how the Lord wants done another quote excuse me but brother another quote the bride knows what he wants done with the word praise the Lord mature that's the point that's what we're preaching on maturity let's go to Isaiah chapter 28 Isaiah chapter 28 we'll begin with verse 9 Isaiah 289 praise the Lord amen things aren't always say the same thank God for that amen so thankful for that changes sometimes hard but when it's Chang in the Lord when we grow in him it's all good Isaiah 28:9 let's read now Whom Shall he teach knowledge and Whom Shall he make to understand Doctrine them that are weaned from the milk and drawn from the breast those are the ones why because they're they're not feeding on the milk anymore they're feeding on the the meat amen the ribi stake for precept must be upon precept precept upon precept line upon line line upon line here a little and there a little for with stammering lips and an other tongue will he speak to this people and you can speak perfect English in the in the vernacular of whoever it is scriptural truth message meat and they still will think you're speaking in tongues because they will have a they won't have a clue what you're saying amen you might as well speak a foreign language because they don't know Amen to whom he said this is the rest praise the lord we rest in it wherewith ye may cause the weary to rest and this is the refreshing yet they would not hear but the word of the Lord was unto them precept upon precept precept upon precept line upon line line upon line here a little there a little that there uh that they might go and fall backward and be broken and snared and taken those that don't receive those that don't hear those that are dull of hearing cannot receive it dull of hearing cannot receive the truth those that are slow of listening Paul made sure he didn't choke them to death remember what he told we talked about in Corinthians remember what he told them he said I'm I didn't come to you great swelling words of wisdom I could but I didn't I saved those wisdom the speaking of wisdom to mature groups and they w mature what did he tell the Hebrews same thing praise the Lord I would explain all these things I would ad Minister all these things to you but you can't receive them so he didn't want to choke them to death so he let them go amen and taught them what they could receive right believing trusting at one day they'll get to the place that they can receive that meat amen and get to the place to where they can receive the understanding of the truth for that for the for their hour for their day that's why that phrase is there for their day brother am uses that phrase a lot for their day why because it's significant it makes a difference what day you're in as so what you receive we go back to cor First Corinthians I want to pick up here where we left the other day 1 Corinthians chapter 13 the love chapter as we know it but I want to read the last part of the chapter CH of verse vers [Music] 8 1 Corinthians 13:8 I want to go through this again amen 1 Corinthians 138 charity never faileth thank God for that because he loves us unconditionally if he loves us unconditionally that love doesn't fail praise the Lord doesn't quit doesn't stop never ends because it's unconditional nothing changes it it can't change because it's God it's God's love and it comes from God it can't change praise the Lord never fail but where there be prophecies they shall fail whether there be tongues they shall cease whether there be knowledge it shall vanish away all these things are insignificant we laid those as Stepping Stones as stumbling as uh uh uh uh stepping blocks that we step to to move forward amen just like the bride has moved forward amen for we know in part and we prophesy in part but when that which is perfect has come that which is in part shall be done away when I was a child I spake as a child I understood as a child I thought as a child but when I became a man I put away childish things now look justification was in in part Luther the just shall live by faith justification was a part satification Wesley moved up a step Wesley sanctification was a part wasn't all of it it was a part and what they brought what they learned what they knew was what they needed for their day amen they were in part but when that which is perfect is come that which is in part will be done away now what does that mean amen what does that done away mean look let me read this question answers number two 1964 brother says 1 Corinthians 13 says that which is that which is per has come that which is in part shall be done away with so all these little things listen now if you're streaming you watch this listen so all these little things of jumping up and down like a king trying to talk in tongues and all these other things when that which is perfect and we do have today by God's help the perfect interpretation of the word with Divine Vindication praise the Lord amen 1964 he preached that we have now today by God's help the perfect interpretation of the of of the the word with Divine Vindication then that which is in part is done away with when I was a child I spoke as a child stood as a child but when I become a man I put away childish things now what is he talking about just like the scripture says amen I go to preaching and these little things he's talking about now what is he saying he's not talking about because brother random remember we know brother random believed in the gifts of the Spirit we know the gifts of the Spirit operated in his life right to Great degree to the to to the degree that a lot of people try to impersonate him that try to impersonate the moving of that gift to try to impersonate the moving of that spirit and those things he tries to impersonate that people try to impersonate that in brother Brown they try to impersonate so much so he's not saying that you can't speak in tongues anymore he said I he said I would be anti- word if I talk that right he wasn't against prophecy he wasn't against the uh uh the governments and heals he wasn't against the organization of a church amen he wasn't against these things so what is he talking about when it talks about when that that which is perfect is come and we know that which is perfect has come we know that which is imp which is perfect is here we know that so what happens if that which is imperfect is come then that which is in part is done away it doesn't mean quit but it means this listen Church order Church order well Brethren I appreciate being here with you tonight brother Neville these deacons trustees Sunday school superintendent all of you we trust that the Lord will help you now to carry out these orders for the kingdom of God the reason I have said this is because I think think you have grown from children to adults praise the Lord just what we're discussing when you was a child you talk like a child you understood as a child but now you're a man now you are a mature bride praise the Lord he's talking to his board there I'm talking to you I'm talking to us he's talking to us amen now we we here today grown from children to adults when you was a child you talk like a child understood as a child but now you are an adult now you are a man so let's act like adults in the house of God act like adults what was it all these things that came forth in the beginning of that church and the restoration of the gifts amen uh back at isza Street and and the spirit just fell like a bucket of water on people and they just spoke in tongues there no gifts operating and all the things that's going on uh these things are just out of order and just out of control but what was it it was infant age it was just starting out it's a baby just born it had to come to a place of maturity amen now this age will not this age goes to predition like I said but a bride comes out of this age to complete the bride the the the statue of a perfect man up to the Pinnacle the peak which is where this bride is to to the time that she goes home it's going home time amen it's going home time so when this when this bride reaches to that place cuz he's not preaching to the church he's preaching to the bride I'm not preaching to a room full of unbelievers I'm preaching to who I believe are bride right mature bride now you've come to the place of maturity now we know that we should act like them in the house of God Amen I shouldn't even have to but Michel put it on there and I do I hit this at the end of every service because this is what a mature Christian should do this is what a mature bride member no should take place in the house of God the house that's dedicated and consecrated to the Lord Jesus this is what it should be amen we should know that it shouldn't have to be something that we have to put up here amen and by the grace of God and I do believe that that we all follow that and are respectful in the house of God Amen but that's what it means to be a mature an adult Christian listen now let's act like adults in the house of God back to the quote here behaving ourselves and honoring our offices and honoring every office every gift now he's talking about what put when that which is imperfect when that which is perfect is come that which is in part shall be done away every gift that the Lord has given us let's put it in order and honor God with our gifts and our offices that's exactly what he's talking about that I I believe is exactly what the scripture is talking about that which is perfect is here so that which is in part falls under subjection to that which is perfect amen justification was part sanctification part but now we're up in the Holy Spirit we're up in the heavenlies we're up in the place of meat we're up in the place of maturity we're up in the place of adulthood amen now we're up in the place of adulthood we act like adults we act like Christian adults in the house of God we act like Christian adults in the presence of one another and in the presence of God how do we do that he's not saying you can't speak in tongues for it's a genuine gift of God he's not saying you can't prophesy if it's a genuine gift and God's operating and moving on you to do that he's not saying that he's saying let every gift of the Lord that he has given us be put in order amen when everything's put in order then it's just right put in order and honor God with our gifts and our offices amen that's why everything should be decently in an order should be done right now that doesn't mean that we turn our churches into morons that doesn't mean that we turn our churches into a place that's colder than uh uh Siberia it just means that it's that everything is in order and let me tell you friend people can jump up and down Scream and Shout Whatever churches they go to they can come out with all kinds of these devices and whatever they think that they can communicate with God or uh whatever whatever they want to I don't whatever I I I want to stick with what CH God has given us the word this mature Bride for this day they can do whatever they want amen let let them let them do all those things out the world and whatever and self-proclaimed prophets and what they can say and do whatever they want to that's their choice but I'm here to tell you that God has put this in order and you will find no matter what all this else is going on over there say oh boy they must really have the power of God but they've got a bunch of emotion is what they have because when the word that which is perfect is not present all you've got is emotion and you got a bunch of emotion oh it'll make people LIF their hands emotional make you cry harder than any than any moving of the spirit remember Satan can impersonate any gift yes but he cannot bring that word word by word so what are you majoring on right amen you can't major on a minor and the gifts are minors the word is the major you can't major on a minor praise the Lord so when the word has come the word is that which is perfect and when it's in order I'm I promise you I guarantee you there'll be more more moving of the spirit of God in a sanctuary that's in order and place the way God's word says to than any of this other Jumping Up Down screaming shouting yelling and whatever they do I guarantee you there's more spirit of God Amen in that place it's order people say oh that looks like a dead place to me those people don't move they don't shout they don't do this that and the other but when the word has come that which is perfect is here amen oh I don't feel A tingle up my spine oh the hair didn't go up on the back of my neck I didn't feel anything well probably because you're a dead wood pardoning expression shouldn't be that meaning Christ crasp but that's the truth amen because God's moving we feel the moving of the spirit we know when it's God moving amen when you have the spirit of God in you you know when that SP is moving and people say well you're not jumping danc nobody's nobody's dancing nobody's running around the church now you can if the Lord moves on you you go right ahead amen amen don't you don't you quench the spirit of the Lord just don't do it during the preaching and because it's got to be in order got to be done respectfully decently in order I've seen I've been in places where uh uh little girls come up like 15 16 17 years old come up in a prayer line or come up to be prayed for and as soon as the minister comes and even just barely touches them they're falling out and screaming and yelling and uh uh thriving around in the the the uh uh wood shavings and everything I I saw one girl she fell out and her skirts flew up and I said that's not of God no that's indecent if her skirt flies up like that that's indecent that's not God right I saw one girl she felt like she got such a spirit she just kept going back backwards and she ran I mean hard the platform was like 3 foot high and she ran the back of her back into that platform that girl probably broke her back she laid down on this she laid there I don't know how long in the wood shaving I said that's just that's not of God God's not going to do that to you friend amen I mean you can lose yourself absolutely but it's going to be done decently and in order amen it's going to be done God if it's God it's going to be done done right I liked can I brag on my daughter for a second I like the time we went over to a a Kino stadium and there was this I I forgot what it was all about but it's secular uh uh ministering Minister whatever it was I forgot who invited anyway brother green said it we went over there people come up and they were they were jabbering some like they were speaking in tongues and some were falling out and this that and the other and all this stuff was happening and all these people were falling and and Tabitha went up for prayer and and I have to say this and brag of my daughter people said people were saying in the congregation now if it happens to her I'm going to believe it bragging on her a little bit because they had so much confidence in her of the moving of the spirit of God that all this other that was going on they knew if that Spirit hit her like that it was genuine it was of God and of course uh she got up there got prayed for turn around walk and sit down like and everybody was kind of okay I get it now amen a lot of people just do that Saints I I don't know why but it's just the way it is but truth of the matter is if it's genuine and it's of God it's going to be decent in order and that's what brother Bam's talking about that which is perfect has come that which is a part be done away put in order put in order amen the word always has the preeminence and honor God with our gifts and our offices that's how you do it praise the Lord that's how you honor God like I said there'll be more God in a church that's in order that people out charismatics where it might say is dead if it's done in order it'll be done right amen that screaming shouting dancing speaking in tongues proph that's all perfectly fine I I have no problem with that at all done in order decency right absolutely praise God that's not what he's talking about being done away he means being put in order amen you can't major on a minor amen the minor the the the gifts are the minor the major is the word praise the the Lord let me read this quote to you uh well you know let me I got I got want to read this one more scripture and then we'll we'll go to that just one Zachariah chapter uh 14 it brings us to that mature now uh Zechariah Chapter 14 one verse Zechariah 141 verse 7 Zechariah 14:7 but it shall be one day which shall be known to the Lord not day nor night but it shall come to pass at the evening time praise the Lord and we're at the evening time of the world we're at the evening time of the message we're at the evening time of the Bride age we're coming at the evening time of the Le de age this is the evening time Saints at the evening time time it shall be light what does light do what does light do when light is brought in it in its proper strength it brings life to Seed Life is In light there's life in the sun you know without the sun there'd be no life without the sun there's no life there's life in light what does the light do when the light comes in this last day that we're living the light brings it to a place of maturity the light will mature the seed the light will mature the bride and what is the light is done for this day the light of the word the light of the Gospel has brought life it has brought a maturity to this bride turn on the light listen now brother R said but you take the Sun that shines in August put it on the week today which was January it would kill it certainly you can't do that it must comeing It season why why Paul could not preach to the Corinthians Hebrews like he talked about he could not do it what would have done it would have choked them out so must God's wheat and grain ripen just in the season and what's she doing is this the season she's ripening ripening right now amen shu is pulled away there I say brother man talked about the Shu pulling away Shu has pulled away the rain the seed is now laying in the presence of sun rening she's getting to that full maturity the bride is getting to that place of completion of fullness of per because that's that's the bride's going to come to this place when he takes her home that's when the body change hits when internationally the bride internationally is changed in a moment twinkling of an eye praise the Lord remember it's a mature woman not a child God's not marrying a child he's marrying a mature woman the season it's in but now but how could a son well the wheat would die the fruits would die the sun lives today with shine rathera it's coming an oncoming Harvest is ripening the grain should mature with the light justification part Luther SA ific ation part Wesley now it's got to the place when it's evening time there's it shall be light the fullness of the light the the grain has matured amen with the light he sent us a prophet they said this was right irenius and this was right with Martin and this was right with Columbus this was right with Luther this was right with les Wesley he brought it and put it all together and preached a message that's been stored up for us to listen to to that's been stored up in the storehouses so that it can feed us it's a Grainery uh like like would put to shame the Egyptian Grainer when Joseph come and they stored up enough grain for seven years with this Grainery that this food that was stored up for us would put that Grainery to shame of the food that we have to Feast on oh praise God the grain should mature with the light but the thing is today the church grain won't want to mature it wants to stay right back remember Mooney uh s youny Cox Alvin they want to stay and listen to to those that's why they those people would just go right over their heads they couldn't receive it amen they couldn't understand it but this is an another hour this is another day this is the advancement of the Gospel it's coming to its maturity so we can't live in what Luther said only or Wesley said only or some of the rest of them were living in the lights that predict for this day amen the grain is mature the light if it goes ahead with the light the light brings the grain to maturity praise the Lord and the evening light which is now there shall be light praise the Lord I got to read one more here I'm going to close amen spoken words your origal seed notice what Harmony Jesus NE never did anything until seen of the father or the father showed him first Harmony between God and Christ see John 5:19 so will the bride amen oh my let let me just read through this this is spoken words original seat this is people don't want to listen to messages before the seals this is before the seals this was 19 1962 it was an about a 6 or8 hour message I forget now uh he preached like three or four hours and they went to lunch and came back or had lunch there on the grounds I forgot how it was and then he preached three or four more hours amen spoken words original seat believe that's what it was he spoke this 1962 so so will the bride and she shows he shows her his Word of Life he shows her and she receives it she never doubts it nothing can harm her not even death praise the Lord nothing can harm you amen you believe that nothing can harm you right not even death for if the seed be planted the water will rise and will come up again amen then I got a real big he said a a real great big Hallelujah here is the secret the word is in the bride and the mind of Christ listen now to know what he wants done with the word who does the bride he didn't say himself although he did because he's part of the Bride not himself he never put it all on himself but the bride who is she I'm part of it I think I'm looking at part of it the bride around the world internationally Bride In The City Bride In the state bride in the this country Bri all around the world Amen she's a many membered body few in number by comparison to the seven billion that live on this planet now give or take amen she's a small number but she's God's she's God's chosen she's his bride she's come to that place of maturity here it is she amen the bride in the mind of Christ knows what God wants done with the world word praise the Lord now you want to talk power with character there it is power with character is Godly she he she knows what he wants done with the word praise the Lord and she does it in his name she has she has not he not William Brandon she has thus sayith the Lord now there's people in this message would call that blasphemy and that's a direct quote from the prophet they claim to believe amen it's a truth I believe it I believe it she will know they people say if you say thus sayi the Lord he said brother BR said that she the bride will have thus sayith the Lord glory to God this then it is gerti so the Holy Spirit Waters it until it's grown and serves its purpose they will do only they will do only his will glory to God no one can persuade them different they have thus sayith the Lord or they keep still praise the Lord Jesus amen that's what you call mature when my son got to the place that it was time for him to drive a car I had no problems giving in my keys amen I knew he might mess up I knew he might get a ticket I knew he might have a wreck Tabitha too my daughter too amen but I had no problem giving it to them because they were at that place in life they had grown up to the place that I believe they were responsible enough to know we all make mistakes we all have accidents uh my son just followed in my footsteps I think I had like two accidents in the first year of my license or something like that uh but things things happen but I had no problem and see that's what when God sees that in our lives people wonder say why why isn't I gotten to this place maybe youve not mature enough to the place where God can entrust you with it we get to the place where God maturity level where God can entrust us with it he's not going to withhold any good thing from us he never does the Bible says he doesn't he gives it to us but it's got to be to that place remember the man is not going to turn his Factory over to a son that is not worthy to run it he's not going to turn his business over to a son that's going to run it into the ground is going to bleed it dry for every penny it can get so he can fly around living up the good life as they call it he's going to do it

one answer all I have all you have to do is follow him praise the Lord just follow him amen praise the Lord amen we have uh a couple of announc I appreciate your prayers I had a good week last week wasn't bad at all flight wasn't bad uh going out was was fine uh still don't like American Airlines but that's beside the point uh I had a good week we just worked like 10hour days it wasn't uh wasn't very stressful wasn't too hard uh got a little extra sleep at night didn't have to fly out till like 10:00 on Saturday so uh but everything was safe and fine I appreciated because they were going a lot of storms going on Sunday when we got there um for the flight so I didn't you know it's um it it was kind of touch and go as to whether we were even able to get there but he actually got like to to California and he took a hard right and went straight North and then went straight East uh West into uh Fresno where we landed over the mountain Mountain to try to avoid all that storm and when we made that left turn to go over the mountains the plane just started floating around like this wind was hitting it and wind was we were hitting void spots it was and I just said Lord stop that then please stop it for us get this plane under control and let it be smooth all the way back all the way into the airport you know what it stopped and it was smooth all the storms going on and all the lightning and everything the winds till we got we landed it was nice and smooth we landed at the airports perfect as you please got there and the sun was out actually amen now we went to go get our car it started raining and then it started raining hard and then it started hailing hard it was pretty bad after that but we got there safe amen Lord took care of it as he always does so I appreciate that next week will be regular time 10:30 uh he hasn't made our flight flight schedule yet but there's only one non-stop flight from here to Minneapolis and it's Delta and it leaves at 155 so that gives me time to we just do our regular 10:30 service um to be able to get to the airport in time so that'll be just fine so we'll keep that the way it is uh also uh brother Pat's birthday is coming up next week 17th St Patrick's Day if you ever wonder about brother Pat's birthday is St Patrick's Day uh I think he told us the other day at lunch here we're going to name him something else I forgot what it was he's probably watching I'm sorry I forgot what he said but when he was born on St Patrick's Day they named him Patrick but anyway uh he wants to do something special next Sunday which is the 16th I believe it is St Patrick's Day is Monday uh if if I'm correct is that right is next okay so the 16th next Sunday um he wants invite everybody to come to brother John's uh after church it
