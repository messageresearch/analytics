you would also Shariah sent a text earlier and ask for prayer for her uh or Nana so it is okay I wasn't sure if it's if it was pronounced the way it was spelled uh Shiraz Nana La Vida uh high blood pressure is having a hard time bringing the high blood pressure down so uh let's remember her in prayer if we could also um the prayer request here from the sister Norma says it asks that sister Judy Arnold asked the church to please pray her exam uh will come out good this Wednesday and kind of exam it is but sister Judy Arnold is having an exam this coming Wednesday she wants the results to be positive so praise the Lord for positive for her amen praise the Lord so just remember those requests anyone have an unspoken request on your heart Lord he always knows our needs amen amen is the Lord Jesus I stand to our feet if we could oh man we'll take these Deeds to the Lord ask brother Dennis if he would do that for us brother Lord as we pray together as a body of Believers we know we're calling you on the scene yes Jesus we know that you're mindful of each and every one and there's no bread in your word this morning Father the gospel did not come only your word but in power and yes yes amen Lord let that become more realistic God yes we know father good people don't make it to Heaven nice and happy people don't make it in heaven it's them they've been uh bought with a price of your blood that accepted you yes Jesus the sacrifice you made at Calvary Hallelujah yes we have accepted you we also have accepted your word we know that the enemy is fighting us harder than ever but greater is amen that's in US yes thank you Lord if God be with us who can be against us and let us have that discernment father to recognize how the Devils fighting us we know your word tells us as Paul spoke in Hebrews to assemble our ourselves together Jesus the more so as you see that day approaching and father was seen less and less of people wanting and and diligently coming to your house of worship it's the enemy fighting us father trying to get us away from hearing your word no knowing that Faith cometh by hearing and hearing of the word yes Lord without faith it's impossible to please God it's time father to stop playing Church you will have a bride without spotting blemish that is totally enveloped with your word she is a wordbride she is not relying realizing that it's of her ability or are accepting her own ability but she knows that it's you father working your will in her yes oh Father who can know the mind of the Lord that we may instruct him but we have the mind of Christ we'll let that become more real in our lives than ever before that battle is yours it's not our fight it's yours yes oh Father we surrender all we want to become the bride word bright that you're gonna come as in Rapture I believe very soon oh Lord greater the sacrifice the greater the blessing and oh Lord let us put forth a foot of faith and then diligently seek you with all that yes Jesus in our Lord our needs amongst your body this morning you said it's too shall agree it's touching anything it shall come to pass yes this is more than two Believers this morning Father we claim healing for all that need a healing touch for the prayer requests that were spoken this morning come unto seem and heal him for thou in a High Praise that can be touched by the feelings of my infirmities and with your stripes we are healed we claim what you pay for us already at Calvary is the finished work father and Lord whatever else a person a Believer this one has NATO as they raise their hands as they raise their hearts to you may you grant them uh overflowing cup of your virtue Waters to give them their heart's desire yeah we know your word says delight yourself in the Lord and you'll give us the desires of our hearts yes Lord father We Believe each and every once a victory in your word this morning and bless our pastor as he brings forth your word help us to receive your

difference but anyway so I guess I did a good job then so but I appreciate my wife coming and uh shampooing the carpet this when you get everything out of here it's a pretty big room uh we did everything but Micah's little Nest we left all that there so but we were getting black spots and things around and dirty spots and so um didn't mean to for a while so I appreciate my wife uh coming

generous enough to help me get my car fixed uh God bless them and everyone in our church praise the Lord so thankful for that it's all ripped all good got it and running and stopping I don't know no

the grace of God so I'm thankful for that is this did you wanna song and sister Norman had a song so we'll have Micah's got the words up here for this one so one of my favorites so pray the Lord bless him as he sings for us today foreign since I was a child but when you start singing in front of a bunch of people there's no time what will happen so I'm going for hearts um true uh Happy Mother's Day to all the mothers and soon to be mothers or fathers that are both mother and father at the same time to certain circumstances but this is one of my long series in Singapore feel free to sing along

the arms of Jesus praise the Lord go ahead and turn to the scripture now amen if we can stand to our feet I'm gonna go over to First Kings read the scripture First Kings very familiar scripture just happy Mother's Day as Mike said to all the mothers to all the potential mothers who future mothers who have written name uh incur amen praise the Lord but uh we'll just take a little a little thought on the Mother's Day topic that we have here and of course as uh brother random told us and I adhere to Mother's Day kind of in the world is more of a racket than anything because every day really should be a Mother's Day and how special mothers are to us carrying every child regardless of the circumstance or situation under a heart for nine months you know there's there's going to be that there's going to be that attachment regardless of what it is and it just lays into perspective uh what we live with today in this world and what's going on in the world today so I'm going to title this so many different titles but looking upon and reflecting on Godly women and Godly mothers and looking in the world today and all the things that's going out there and the motherhood if you will that's out there I titled this the heart of a real mother the heart of a real mother so First Kings chapter 3 is where we're going to go to Solomon the story of Solomon and two women that you all very familiar with and draw our context from today amen before we do this is by our heads for another word of prayer for good Lord Jesus father we're so very thankful again for another beautiful day that you give us thank you for your grace your mercy your love your blessings and Lord all the Bountiful things that you give us continuously every day unmerited unfavorable of unfavored Lord but God you love us so much that you gave your own life for us you loved us so much that you continue to be with us and never leave us or forsake us you love us so much that Lord when we get tangled up in situations and messes you're always there with us Lord when we get down you bring us up when we get sick you heal us when we get depressed Lord you're always there to uh to to bring encouragement and help Lord father it's so much that you do for us and continue to do and we just thank you for it Lord so many things that we can couldn't even hardly begin to to say to speak yes but Lord just take a moment to Thank You Lord because we know that you to us our father and mother you're everything and you Lord you put an atom in the beginning the masculine and the feminist Spirit Lord is what you created him in your image just like that God so we look to you God for those things for the nurturing and for uh uh uh for the compassion and all that that goes with that Spirit Lord we thank you for it because you are everything to us and Lord we just pray that your Holy Spirit would have preeminence Lord once again on the main part of this service speak to us from your word today Lord let your spirit God continue to flow through this place Lord as it did on the day of Pentecost and feeling that spirit so strong Lord that it would that it would well up in US of faith God to receive whatever we have have need of today we rebuke every demonic spirit that would try to hurt hinder infiltrate this service in any way God that you would get the glory and the praise for all that is said and done no doubt Lord I come here during the week and Lord there's just so many evil spirits swirling around this world Lord there's so many evil demonic spirits around this place God we rebuke them every one father For Your Glory and Honor for the for the purpose of this meeting for the purpose of Us coming here in solitude of this place away from all those Spirits away from that of the world Lord God just expecting you to meet with us here in this place God doing the exceedingly abundantly above all that we could ever ask for things so we received that Lord today from your Bounty and we thank you for it Lord now may you accomplish Lord whatever purpose you have for this service today Lord is that song that was saying that we began Lord the service with Lord we know there's great things in store for us today there's great things that you have Lord for this meeting for us for us here your people God that you would do here today so we committed to you Lord we let ourselves go may you just use us for your glory and honor to speak through to hear through uh whatever you'd have to become accomplished today God we committed to you and thank you for it Lord now in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen amen I will read this uh uh we'll read this story here is again all very familiar to it but um First Kings chapter 3 uh we're gonna begin reading with verse 16. First Kings chapter 3 verse 16. amen I think uh as I as the lord gave me this title here it it this is the first story that came to my heart because to me this probably as much as any biblical story that would that would pertain to a mother or a motherhood uh exhibits the heart of a real mother as much as anything does any story in the scripture any reality of this Bible uh this one does so let's read it as we go through now First Kings chapter 3 verse 16 then came their two women that were harlots unto the king and stood before him the one woman said oh my Lord I and this woman dwell in one house and I was delivered of a child with her in the house and he came to pass the third day after that I was delivered that this woman was delivered also and we were together there was no stranger with us in the house save uh save we too in the house and This Woman's child died in the night because she overlaid it and she arose at midnight or basically in the middle of the night not necessarily at 12 o'clock but in the middle of the night and took my son from beside me while thou handmaid slept and laid it in her bosom and laid her dead child in my bosom and when I Rose in the morning to give my child suck behold it was dead but when I had considered it in the morning behold it was not my son which I did bare the and the other woman said nay but the living is my son and the dead is thy son and this said no but the dead is thy son and the living is my son thus they spake before the king then said the king the one saith this is my son that liveth and thy son is dead the other saith nade but thy son is death and my son is living and the King said bring me a sword and they brought a sword before the king and the King said divide the living child in two and give half to the one and half to the other then spake the woman Whom The Chill the living child was unto the king for her vows yearned upon her son and she said oh my Lord give her the living child and in no wise slay it but the other said Let It Be neither mine nor thine but divided then the king answered and said give her the living child and in no I slayeth she is the mother thereof and all Israel heard of the Judgment which the king had judged and they feared the king for they are respected and reverenced him for they saw that the wisdom of God was in him to do judgment you could be seated if you like again probably as much as anything now there was others there's other instances situations that really display the heart of a true mother a true Godly mother a true Christian mother but this is the first one that came on my heart that was really exemplary of what a real a real true mother for the heart of her son will be amen the real true heart of a mother for her son would want the best for that child would want the best for uh for her son or for her daughter thus she would want whatever it would mean even if it meant for that child to be away from her she would rather her child be away from her and be prosperous and blessed and Alive than actually to be with her and so that's the real heart of a real mother now you see all kinds in the world today but we're talking about the heart of a real mother now I want you to notice uh that a lot of times get skipped over in this story but the fact is when these two women came before the king the scripture says that they were both harlots both of them were amen so as you would think as a harlot would be as you would imagine that that person as we would imagine today or or talk about or uh uh uh display that that that person would be someone of ill Fame someone that didn't have uh the right kind of heart or the right kind of spirit or the right kind of person to want what would be best for their child in other words motherhood and the perversion of a human Spirit can become perverted even regardless of the this feminist spirit that God put which we'll get to a little bit later into the woman even with that feminist Spirit which was put in the woman for a reason even with that that Spirit can be perverted remember the human spirit the mind can be perverted and even with that you'd think well uh neither one of these women would really care that much because you see today uh the same thing and you you see actual normal what considered normal healthy people aborting or uh abortion is just a pleasure word they put to murder because actually abortion is just murder just like a fancy word the devil likes the fancy word stuff that's evil up you know like uh like cancer is just a devil amen it's just a demonic spirit is what it is and just like they fancy of murdering an unborn child with the word abortion so uh you you see millions and millions of that you see if uh turn up in trash bins and uh left on doorsteps and uh all kinds of things happy you think well how could the heart of a mother do that with the heart of a real mother couldn't do that wouldn't do that amen or wouldn't throw them in the river or put them in the trash bin they may give them up for adoption if a mother feels like that she's not able to appropriately take care of that child again that goes to the heart of a mother to rather have that child away from her but Prosper than to have that child uh uh began or or or whatever condition that they think would be derogatory for that child every mother would want the best for that child unless that spirit is perverted you think well the the heart of the heart the the heart of a harlot would already have been perverted but not necessarily right remember the woman at the well the woman at the well does not describe scripturally what her life was like before that period but if you go listen to the dramatization and things that brother random said about her in two or three different places we don't know what that poor girl went through to bring her to the place that she had all of those husbands amen we don't know what she went through we don't know what her life was like it may have been starvation or do this we don't know we don't know what kind of a mother she had that drove her maybe to that point but we do know that when life came when truth came when it presented itself to this woman she received it so there had to be something in her amen you understand what I'm saying there must have been something in her in that woman at the well that when Christ came and he explained to her who he was and her eyes were open she recognized who she was and ran in the city and testified everybody she could find amen so regardless of whether she was a harlot or not her heart wasn't her heart was not corrupted amen her heart was not corrupted that sounds strange but it's true now if you look at this other woman it would appear as though her heart had been corrupted because even though it was her child that she laid over and died look at her attitude when it came to murdering This Little Child right she said I don't care kill it divided half and give apart to me an apartment now what kind of a heart would speak to that right amen now you can see even the difference in the two women right there although they were both harlots the hearts of those women one had the heart of a mother the other didn't because even a true mother would want the child of the other mothers uh the child of the other mother to be helped and blessed too because that's the heart of a real mother it would not say uh if my baby's dead your baby's gonna die see that's a corrupted heart yes even though both women were harlots one heart was was still good we would say because she had that heart of a mother the others wasn't even with her son dead she still wanted the other one dead amen that's not a pure heart but the heart of a real mother stepped forward and said no don't don't kill it give the living child to this woman let the Child live whatever it is even if I have to be without him and of course the wisdom that God had given Solomon so that Solomon in in that wisdom said let's kill the baby we'll find out who the real mother is and the real mother said no don't kill it and Solomon said that's the mother amen mom could we use some of that wisdom today yes get some of that judgment in the world today he got to understand this is the real mother this this woman has the heart of a real mother this one does it amen this one is and a real mother would want her child to live and to prosper and be blessed regardless of what it would cost her regardless of whether it meant that she was going to be separated from that child she still wants what's best for that child now um as Mother's Day is and we'll go over I want to turn over to Genesis chapter 3. amen God purposely in the Garden of Eden God made the man and he made the man with the masculine and the feminist spirit but when God made the Manna help me he took out of the man the feminist Spirit into the woman so you understand when God made the man that helped me he took the feminist Spirit out to put it in this in the female so that the female would have that part of the feminist Spirit to be able to uh accomplish to be able to uh live out the part of of life that was to that was the cause for the feminist Spirit uh the the nurturing and the compassion and the kind of love see there there's there's there's no outside of God there is no match to love outside of a mother's love there's you cannot match a mother's love a real Godly True Mother you can't match your love you can't match your mother's prayer of mother's prayer for her child prevails to God I believe is much or more than any prayer God hears those prayers those prayers continue to reverberate I believe the prayers of my mother continue to reverberate for me she's gone on to her reward I'm still here I believe my mother's prayers is still going on before the Lord the love that she had the heart of that real mother towards her son towards her children of course I'm the only one left but George towards me is still reverberating today it's still having an effect today amen that's that's the part of what God took out of the man and put into the woman the what it what it would be to accomplish that in two individuals instead of one individual because it was the responsibility of one individual at one time that was Adam everything that was to be accomplished and the masculine and feminist Spirit was to be done by one person but when God made a help mate he took that feminist spirit and divided that if you could say job up and the man was to accomplish and live out the masculine part of the job that was to be accomplished in in Eden and the woman was to accomplish the part that was to be done by the feminist spirit through through the woman and that's where the motherhood comes from God did that for a reason God did that for a purpose there's a reason now I know uh it's probably not the same anymore but when I was growing up uh my mother would get upset with me but my mother never disciplined me uh that probably is not necessarily the right thing to do but my mother never disciplined me my mother never spanked me that was only my dad and I don't know how many times I I was according to my dad I was a pretty good boy so uh it didn't happen a whole lot of times but my mom used to tell me where your father gets home why because the part of that was to be accomplished by him right the part of what she had accomplished by her and she said where did you go father gets home would you like a peanut butter jelly for lunch because he's going to discipline you but I'm going to make you lunch amen so that so that was the masculine part the man amen right or wrong probably not uh probably not politically correct anymore but I was my my dad was a disciplinarian and my mother made me lunch uh because she was the nurturer she was the one that loved she was the one that was there that was compassionate and and uh and look Beyond those things but my dad knew that I needed not that she didn't know but needed the correction so it worked both ways amen amen the job of raising Newton Bennett was accomplished by two people the man and the woman now you see what's happening in the world today now brother random told us 50 years ago 60 years ago that it's not juvenile delinquency it is parent delinquency and the more the time goes by the more you see it the more it becomes prevalent the more you recognize it um the more you see that one parent homes just don't do it or no parent homes it's like my Capri sometimes a man has to be mom and dad sometimes a woman has to be mom and dad uh and and that's sometimes works out I've there's uh people I know in fact one guy that's a senator in South Carolina now he's a black fella Scott uh Senator Scott I forget his name but uh he talks about if I remember right he talks about being raised by his mother see but how many times that that is an anomaly how many times is it though that when it's only the mother that's there to raise the child that the child loses that sense of masculinity and and one and and usually goes one of two ways it either reverts back and becomes more into an effeminate Spirit or it goes out and it just it it overdoes the masculine part and kills people and Bullies people and uh all those things see it was it was my point is that the raising of the child was meant to be done by the man and the woman there was it was meant to be a a a a male and a female there now of course sometimes things happen and uh that can't be done but optimally that's the way it's supposed to be so when God here in Genesis chapter 3 separated that Spirit let's look here amen because um would dabble a little bit in in the things that's going on in the world today but let's look First Genesis chapter 3 verse 17. now this is after the fall of course Genesis 3 17 and unto Adam he said because thou has hearkened unto the voice of thy wife and has Eden of the tree of which I commanded these saying they thou shall not eat of it cursed is the ground for thy sake and Sorrows shall thou eat of it all the days of thy life now remember as we said the other day we read this God did not curse Adam he cursed the ground for Adam's sake amen so when so when God cursed the ground now you know that God God in the beginning said let there be created the Earth the heavens and everything that was therein but when he did that he took from what he created to continue his creation he created botany life he created animal life he created human life and so much so that when the fall came when uh when this took place um let's just continue reading thorns and Thorns also in thistle shall it bring uh forth to thee and thou shalt eat the herb of the field and the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread till thou return unto the ground for out of it was thou taken for dust Thou Art unto dust shalt thou return now when if God cursed the ground then everything that was from the ground is cursed also when when Adam fell that's how we know that when Adam fell all of creation fell you say well how can botany life fail because body life dies off every year and it never was intended to be that way it'll it'll raise back again bring back another spring another leaves more fruit but it dies out during certain periods of time most of them do anyway the grassers uh trees and things like that and it it it it it doesn't have that Everlasting as it was to be to begin with animal life of course we know does amen you see the animal life before the animal well and body like rose bushes they didn't have Thorn stickers the cactus and everything that that didn't exist before the fall uh everything became gnarled up and and sticky if you will uh animal life same thing you never had a a lion eating of eating a lamb you never had these animals attacking each other we got um falcons fly around our building and those Falcons will come and catch another little bird and eat it I I didn't think of Falcon would ever do that but it does they do they come and catch them I see them they catch them and they they'll they'll kill the little bird and eat it and it never would have done that and look at human life I accumulates human all the time not necessarily in cannibalism but murder and uh and and saying horrible things about each other and running down one another's character and hating one another and you see it happen all the time in human life all of creation fell so the so when God cursed he cursed the ground for Adam's sake and said from thus that you came and dust you'll return amen when it was cursed all of creation was cursed all of creation fell Saints but I want you to notice something even though animal nature animal life has been cursed even though animal life doesn't have a soul I would put most animals against a lot of women today as a mother sometimes I feel like you had these uh Jungle Book stories of or Tarzan Tarzan was raised by supposedly raised by apes or uh uh a little baby Raised by Wolves or something sometimes I wonder if that's not better than some of the women today amen unfortunately look at it the the greatest babysitter you got today you can't hardly go in a restaurant today and some kids not watching a monitor monitors are the uh the number one babysitter for kids today and I I I'm sorry I don't I just um uh I know I was raced at a different time but I just don't know that there's anything on there that is so necessary that you can't have a child sit at a dinner table without pitching a fit without watching some Mickey Mouse or something uh just how is that training a child yeah yeah it just doesn't make sense to me you don't see the animal doing that amen well they can do it well they race they raise the child by the nature that they have amen most animal nature and that's that's and that's in a fallen condition and without a soul the animal doesn't have a soul but yet still unfortunately seems like a lot of animals do a better job than people would do at raising their own child but look at the other look at here now um out of the ground um uh that tilled out return unto the ground for out of it was thou taken for dust Thou Art and to dust shalt thou return and Adam called his wife's name e because she was the mother of all living and Adam also in his wife unto excuse me unto Adam also unto his wife did the Lord God make coats of skins and clothe them now notice God did not and it was never that we ever saw nothing we ever heard in the scripture about an animal dying or body life or anything else until after the fall after the fall after judgment has been laid God laid out the judgment and the serpent of the woman to the man cursed the ground only at that time that you read an animal with slain and God did it God is the one now who slain the animal they met a lot of people want to say uh different things about killing animals and things it never was so in the beginning it was not supposed to be that way but nor was a human supposed to die Noah's body life supposed to die or had thorns and stickers on them all of this none of this was supposed to be from the beginning but after the fall is when you read for the first time that an animal dies and it dies for the most noble purpose God Did It for sacrificial purposes amen God did it but it was only after the fall that God did it right now what is happening now what is happening in the world today now they're changing they're trying to change roles the man is is working so hard in in many places to become the woman and the woman has worked so hard to become the man you see it even in the world today and and the things that uh that's that's promoted and pushed out there to to make the male more feminine well that's all for a purpose it's all to a reason Saints amen is to completely first of all abolish the the family Dynamic and to crush motherhood because when you've crushed motherhood you've crushed your nation look what brother random said here um this isn't one of the questions and answers but he said and the backbone of Any Nation is Womanhood when it comes to morals and when you break motherhood look what he said now when you break motherhood you've broke your nation well what do you expect to happen in the world today then the whole focus and aim of the devil and upon this country and upon humanity is to First destroy the family but then to break the woman to break motherhood and when it's done then the nation's finished right right and you look at it today where does it stand you have people that are that are still good people you have Christians and used to have people that are just good people I mean people that are good people and and and they take care of their children and they're they're not necessarily a bunch of roustables and and you know just going out to bars every night and that kind of they're good people they might go to a nominal church or might not go to a church or they might go Christmas and Easter but they raise their kids right they want them in a good school and they want their kids raised right and not indoctrinated in school but but taught in school and so that they're they're children raised to where they're proud of their posterity they want to continue the family lineage but it seems like and probably because it seems like the negative is pushed out pushed out in front so much that that it's it's become an overwhelming thing that it's it's gone the other direction uh I I I you see all kinds when you go to an airport uh there's there's all kinds of people so malls uh airports things like that um you you can almost see the past 200 years in an airport uh you can see poodle skirts and uh you can see hairdos from the 50s and you can see uh just about anything up up to Modern today to where sometimes you look at it and it's almost like they started in the 20s and they finished in the 2000s from from top to bottom or bottom to top and I'm not making fun of them that's just all they know see that's that hell horse rider uh we're living in the day of the Revelation 5 the pale horse rider where all those mixed up colors is all together is taking all that from here and all that from there and it's mixing all together there's no when I was going to school there was an identity there was certain specific identity it was stupid but it was an identity uh and probably every uh child going through school uh High School had some certain identity uh that looked ridiculous and stupid uh and ours did too but it was an identity today there isn't you don't see one you I I've been when I was driving I'd be about high school and and see kids coming out of high school you see all kinds of kids used to be uh when I went to school it was used it was usually one or maybe two things you see a kid look like one or two things whatever it was Amen in the 80s but now you see kids come out and some have hair down here and some shape it some I have just it it's just all mixed up uh it it just there's no identity anymore because it's all mixed together it's all mixed up and it's just the situation of the world and and how we're living I think when I and when I see uh at a store or something I see a dad go down the go down the the aisle and he's got him a ponytail or something down here you look and that little boy his little boy's got the exact same thing you go on you you see a a a a woman she's got tattoos all over and I see this little girl and what she got little tattoos now they're probably the little fake ones that but she's got tattoos on her thing how what chance does that portal and girl have with a mother like that what chance is that little boy got with a father like that and it just it just speaks to the parent delinquency again that there is in the world today right the parent delinquency and the Heart of the mother and I I'm not going to declare it officially but to me it looks as though the heart of the mother is broken in this nation the heart of the mother is broken in this nation to the point that less than 50 I heard statistics lately less than 50 percent of women today chroming growing up at a high school college want to be mothers less than 50 percent want to have children that's a sad State of Affairs friend now part of it they claim is because of climate change and they don't want any more children but whatever the reason less than 50 percent of girls today growing up when I was growing up it was it was a foregone conclusion it just it just happened the girl wanted to be a mother they had little baby dolls and carried around and mother little plastic little molded pieces of plastic they bothered them because it was in them to do it was in their heart to want to be a mother the whole time and she's mothering this little piece of plastic trying to shove this little bottle of just to mother this piece of plastic and there's nothing in it amen but but that's what she wanted to do nowadays it's it's it it barely exists if at all now look what's happening Romans chapter 8 in the spirit Realm Romans chapter 8 I'll pose here in a few minutes Romans chapter 8 what is what is happening in this in the spirit realm now the the spiritual battle that that's that's going on the and and the spiritual battle for your children is now becoming a physical battle you hear it all the time the devil's after your kids the devil's after your children you've got to protect your children now more than ever yes there there are more organizations today uh out in schools teaching them and telling them your parents don't need to know your parents should know there's there's actual uh political leaders saying that the children don't belong to the parents the political leaders of this country are saying that children do not belong to the parents they belong to the community friend more than ever now is the time to guard to protect but what's happening in that Spirit realm of Romans chapter 8 we see what's taking place for us now Romans 8 18. for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in US for the earnest expectation of the creature or creation the earnest expectation of the creation is waiting for the manifestation or the revealing the unveiling of the sons of God the manifesting of the sons of God the unveiling of the sons of God all of creation is groaning and waiting for the sons of God to begin to manifest to begin to unfold and reveal why for the creature was made subject to vanity not willingly but by reason of him who has subjected the same in Hope because the creature itself also amen creation itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the Glorious Liberty of the children of God Amen when the sons of God when the children of God begin to unfold begin to reveal begin to manifest all of creation is happy because creation itself will be delivered from this bondage praise the Lord it'll go back to the way it was for we know that the whole creation groanth and travaleth in pain together until now and not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit even we ourselves grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption that is to say to wit that is to say the Redemption of our bodies the Redemption of our bodies friends if we are that close if we believe and feel that we are that close to the point of the Redemption of our bodies a rapture then where are we at today yes in regards to the manifestation of the sons of God where are we God's children are beginning to manifest themselves show themselves in who they really are and look the darker the world gets the greater the light shines on the true Christian the crazier you look the more odd you look the more peculiar you are but the brighter the light shines because everything else is getting so dark all of the world is going uh in in a chaotic condition but God has his children God in the spirit realm has those that believe that are becoming the manifested sons of God they're revealing and unveiling who they are as sons of God yes not just words not just letters on a page but a living representation of Jesus Christ on the Earth today yes a manifestation of of God's children to show and to bring because when this happens the the blending over from this world that we live in into eternity will come to fruition and all of creation will come back to the place that it was in the Garden of Eden amen the line will lay down with the lamb yes there'll be no more thorns and thistles no more Cactus like this no more thorns on the rose bush botany life animal life human life will all back come back to the place that it was originally meant to be amen through this as this manifested sons of God now I want to read one more uh scripture uh over in Exodus and we're going to close Exodus chapter 2 beginning with verse 1. Exodus 2 1. and there when a man of the house of Levi and took to wife a daughter of Levi and the woman conceived and bear a son and when she saw him that he was a goodly child she hid him three months she hidden because Pharaoh had put out a decree because the the Israelites were so blessed the Hebrews were so blessed God was with him so much that they multiplied and prospered and multiplied and prospered and the race of the rose of a pharaoh who knew not Joseph and the promise that that Pharaoh had made to Joseph in his in his posterity to come and live in Goshen that they they they they became such a mighty uh people Pharaoh was afraid that they would rise up against pharaoh and against Egypt and take over the place so he starts telling the middle they bring him in bondage and they put them in hard bondage and and they start turning them into slaves and he tells the he tells the midwives that deliver the Hebrew children uh when they're delivered if it's a female keep it alive but if it's a male kill it so now jacobeds son Moses is born she sees he's a goodly child and hides him for three months so he doesn't get killed now of course The Midwives feared God too so they were holding back killing the the men children as well but she hid Moses three months but when she can no longer hide him she took him uh she took for him an archival rushes out dogged it with slime and with pitch put the child they're in and she laid it in the flags by the riverbank River Brink Rivers Brink and his sister stood afar off Miriam to be at what would be done to him the daughter of pharaoh came down to wash herself at the river and her maidens walked Along by the Riverside and when she saw the ark among the flags she sent her maid to fetch it and when she had opened it she saw the child and behold the Babe wept now see if this if there's anything in the heart especially the heart of a woman it's going to have compassion for that child regardless of if it was against the pharaoh's edict regardless of if it was a Hebrew or whatever her heart went out the baby's crying the baby wept and she had compassion on him and said this is one of the Hebrews children but she had such compassion that her heart reached out to this child and took it unto herself now notice this as I close God would have allowed this to happen so to the place that we don't know how many Hebrew boys were killed before after Moses but if Pharaoh had not you said this is the tender hand of Jehovah now amen the tender hand into Jehovah a lot of people say why would God allow such a thing why would God allow the pharaoh to put out an Egypt edict to kill all the Hebrew boys well if that edict wasn't there she would have never hid Moses if that edict wasn't there she would have never put him in that uh in that River to be found by Pharaoh's daughter to be put and raised in the how of Halls of Egypt right under the pharaoh's nose who was supposed to be the deliverer of the people that he just put in bondage amen you try to write a strip like that friend it doesn't work that way but God knows what he's doing God knows exactly what he's doing even when it becomes a hardship it looks like sometimes to us God can see remember the vision of faith God can see further than we can he knows the end from the beginning that's right you think this looks cruel but if it hadn't been for that eating from that fair hero and don't know how many Hebrews you how many Hebrew mothers lost their son they'll be with them in eternity but I don't know how many there in this life that they lost but if it hadn't been for that none of the other story of Moses would have ever would have ever happened amen amen God started right there how did God start the Deliverance of the children of Israel he started it with an edict from the heart of pharaoh to kill the Hebrew boys amen that just sounds rational but God knows exactly what he's doing amen how could we even begin to question why and how God does things because he works all things together for our good and our vision of faith is not right here our vision of faith is in the future our vision of faith is through the eternities friend and what does it matter I've said this a few weeks a couple months ago remember all children go to heaven and if all children go to heaven and you get to spend eternity with your child or with your son daughter over there what better thing I would rather have my children through eternity than here on this Earth I'm thankful God give give them to us but one of them is with the Lord and I know we know we'll see him again as much or more to me than if he was said his congregation amen because I'm going to be with him on the other side they will be with them on the other side and God knows that and he takes care of us is the tender hand of Jehovah maneuvering and making any what did he do he he used the heart of a mother to bring this about he got into her heart to cause her to do this to realize I would rather have my son raised enough wherever else I'd rather I'd rather risk him to the crocodiles in the Nile River I'd rather risk I've trusted my God and put him right in the hands of pharaoh and the and the Allah pharaoh praise the Lord and not only that but the the woman found Miriam and Miriam led her to her mother who actually nursed her own son because of her act she still got to nurse Moses praise the Lord because God's mindful Ness God knows exactly what he's doing amen in this message Mother's Day 1959 brother Graham said you know a man like Moses if he could credit anything to his character it was because he had a god-sent mother and God used that mother's heart to to bring this that whole thing about you know it was she that prayed Jocko bed and had long for this baby and when he was born she was the one who cooed him cuddled him built the ark placed him in the bull rushes when her her poor heartbreaking her only little baby outstanding um the most outstanding little chunk that was in all the world and how a mother likes any baby but this special little fella and then in her heart she knew that he was born for a purpose and then he had to take place and place him in the very dinner the crocodiles in the Nile River by faith she did it knowing god was able to take care of him and to summarize the love of a mother and the actions of the character of her faith for Faith does not Place itself upon the sifting shifting Sands Faith rests solidly upon the unmovable Rock of God's Eternal word amen by faith she did this yes praise the Lord and it's by faith you do that today yes a Godly holy ghost-filled mother the real heart of a mother is to want the best Amen to want the best for that child regardless of the circumstance regardless of even if she doesn't even if she's not with him she wants the best for that amen outside of all the things that we see and hear of today and the things of the world and that Spirit of mother being perverted in the woman you see so many more today amen I I see them all the time every week as I go traveling sometimes I double take and yep that's a woman sometimes it's hard to know but you double take yeah that's a man um you have to look twice because that spirit's becoming perverted yes amen that Spirit Satan is perverting that Spirit yes amen and it's and it's it's getting so mixed up that it's it's perverted the whole place yes amen but thank God this world's not our home amen amen this world's not our home praise the Lord let's stand if we could I'm so thankful that in the beginning In The Garden of being that God took that that spirit out of the man and put it into the woman amen I've witnessed that my whole life through my wife through my mother and then through my wife and now through my daughter um I've seen it my whole life and the True Heart of a real mother and what it does what it produces and it makes me so thankful that God took that out of man in the Garden of Eden and put it in her amen put it in her I know when our children were being raised [Music] there were certain times I could hold them and they just cried bloody murder but when Mom got a hold of them they just snuggled in that is all she wrote amen because it's just different amen they're home if it makes a huge difference praise the Lord I want to sing this song I had this song slated um for the song service but I want to sing it we sang it the other day I want to sing it when Michael wasn't here now we got the word so we could sing it together but when I was uh looking at the song lists and

gave him from the dead because he was dead his body being dead he's raised from the dead you raise him again from the dead amen amen this woman she got a child from a dead woman she thought praise God
