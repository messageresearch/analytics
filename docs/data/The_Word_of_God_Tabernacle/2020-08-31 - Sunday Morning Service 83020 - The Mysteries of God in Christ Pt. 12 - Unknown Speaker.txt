========================================
hello saints good morning to you god bless you again today beautiful sunday morning the lord give us again and uh sorry to be a little bit late have a little hiccup there again but thank the lord to give us a ability to be able to do this and thankful that you're there and appreciate the lord's goodness to us bringing us through another week to another sunday and just feel blessed that lord is shining upon us and knowing that we're wrapping up this world's history and that uh his bride is the ones that he looks to and uh we trust in him and believe in him and we know the lord is always with us he never leaves or forsakes us and i'm so thankful to have you all there and appreciate you being part of our family and uh love you and appreciate you uh god couldn't have assembled a better group of people so just welcome you to this service today as i've told you before and maybe we'll reiterate at the end of this service um got the building really really close to getting to where we could probably have service again uh and live person next sunday should be uh should be fine so i know i said that last sunday but some hiccup happened this week me and brother roger went a couple days after work to put in a couple hours and you got some of the lights working you want to get them all working and brother angel's working on the floor and trying to get the carpet down so the lord willing we get those couple things done before next sunday then uh we'll be ready to have service in there so god's been good to us and i appreciate his blessings and his love to us so i guess we'll start out a new month next month next sunday of course as you all know tuesday september is hard to believe uh of course i'll be i'll be glad the heat subsides a little bit uh so glad to get some rain last night and we're supposed to get a good bit of rain again today i think about three o'clock 100 chance of rain but thankful that the lord would reign on us spiritually too so welcome to the service today i pray something will be said to bless and help you today we have a couple prayer requests here that we want to make mention to you um we have uh one from brother danny of course he had mentioned before about his sons uh it just seems like there's outside interference trying to influence his sons away from him and he really wants the lord's intervention on that so just pray the lord would have his way in that situation sister norma also request prayer for his grant for her grandson he'd come to tucson but his transmission went on his truck and uh she wants the lord to just intervene somehow make a way to get his transmission fixed so he can get back home uh with his truck so i appreciate the lord and trust in the lord would be upon that also uh sister sheila sent a prayer request for her son dominic her brother harlan and of course she wanted to mention that alice uh alice's birthday is tomorrow so um happy birthday to alice will be three tomorrow so happy birthday alice god bless you um so thankful that the lord has blessed a nice healthy couple of years for her i also found out this week that my old church back in north carolina brother richard boatwright has um have gotten had gotten someone in the church that had coveted and it had spread in the church so there's several members there that that have coveted so i would ask that you pray with them uh the church name is king's tabernacle and the ones there i don't even know who all has it uh but just remember them in prayer if you would i'm sorry this uh encoding thing i don't know what that is is gonna keep this buffering so i sincerely apologize hopefully the audio will come through if the video doesn't drive you crazy freezing and letting go so hopefully the audio will be a good stream you can listen because that's really the main part of this anyway but i do apologize for that um anyway so brother uh so remember that in prayer if you would also brother dave williamson just sent me a prayer request pray for danielle um now excuse me because i haven't read through this yet she has a complicated pregnancy she's facing a potential risky surgery today for a placenta something her placenta has grown through her uterine wall she's having contractions uh if delivery begins she could lead to death and not sure the two-month plus premature baby would survive the delivery so her name is danielle i'm assuming it's probably a client of uh brother dave so if you remember that in prayer too for this danielle i heard back from several of my friends as you all know the hurricane just went up through a a major swath of louisiana and i have a lot of friends and of course brother pat has uh his daughter rachel there and and shreveport or uh vulgar city or boger city blues bossier city uh they're in uh shreveport and of course that's you most of you probably know austin that's where they live uh but i've heard from several of them they're doing good the lord blessed them and they have power out of course but uh no injuries no deaths and they're all doing very well the ones i've heard from anyway so i'm very thankful for that god was merciful to them even in lake charles i i knew some older couple that i visited the churches up there and came and heard me minister and was fellowshipping with them um there in lake charles right where the hurricane hit so um all is well and we're thankful that god bless them and and was with them so just remember these requests of course uh there's several people as we know uh back at brother donnie reagan's church that had contracted coveted including brother donnie brother daryl ward uh brother terry tittle his wife uh brother daryl ward's son was actually taking care of him and his brother daryl's wife was taking care of him then she got it he was taking care of her and now the son has it and so just remember them all in prayer uh this whole thing we're just trusting the lord's intervention and god bless them and and bring perfect complete healing in every situation so we know god is mindful amen and god is with us uh i want to mention this after service too it looks like there's only a few people maybe watching right now so i'll try to remember this maybe my wife's sitting here help remind me that next saturday september 5th we're going to have a baptism uh at the zenkus house pool uh in their backyards very good very secluded we've had a baptism there before uh they're supposed to be quite a few people i've heard up to 16 people that want to get baptized next saturday of sister priscilla's family and the different ones there so a lot to explain there but we i don't want to take the time to do that but remember if you'd like to come be a part of that it's next saturday at 3 p.m if you want to know the details address whatever next saturday september 5th at 3 pm uh we're gonna have a baptism and there's going to be quite a few people there and it's going to be i really believe it's going to be a nice blessing and that takes place there and just trust that people get the holy ghost and uh be more people come into the kingdom of god that's the whole thing of it too so we're just trusting the lord and just praying that the lord would intervene and have his way in that situation but if you come and like to remember next saturday the 5th at 3 p.m so remember that if you would i want to announce that at the end of service at the end of this message too so so appreciate you being there those who are those who are coming those who may watch this on archives god bless you let's bow our heads you have a need of prayer of course lord knows our hearts he knows your heart so um you just hold those before the lord in your heart and as we go forward in prayer now precious jesus father again you are the master you are the lord you are the head of this body you are the one that has preeminence in all things and of course in our lives we're trusting in that lord father as we go through this service lord as we've gone through this uh this series of services i trust and pray god that your hand is upon it that you are pleased with it lord and that somehow it gets through to my heart it gets through to each one of us that we can draw closer to you that this is something that encourages us and blesses us and that that word we can feed upon lord and find our place in that body and see where we are and what's happening today and what part we play and lord the full expression of jesus christ upon this planet today is manifested through the bride of jesus christ through the preeminence that you have in this body as the head lord you are the beginning of this you are the ending of it you are the foundation of revelation you are the cast on the finish line lord you are the alpha omega beginning and ending and lord to you we approach right now for these prayer requests believing that your hand would be upon them lord i might not can remember every one of them now as i bring them before you but lord the good thing about that is that we know that you knew everyone before they became a request and of course we just mentioned them verbally lord we put them in the air for them to reverberate around the world for forever god because the voice just keeps caring and caring and caring and lord is being recorded on this device today who knows the time terries that this might be played back over and over again but lord we're believing god that you are mindful of a request and every need and we lift them before you today father in the name of jesus christ sister shelia and request lord for her um uh for her brother harlan and for her son dominic and of course the celebration of alice's birthday tomorrow god we're so thankful father you

her grandson pray that you'd move on his truck lord touch it somehow or make a way somehow god that he could get that transmission fixed to be able to take it back home with him lord of course we want

the request for his sons that we brought before you before and believing god is we just knock on that door lord that unjust judge believing god that you are faithful and true that move upon his sons

glory and honor we give it to you in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen god bless you uh seems like that video is still buffering a little bit but we're just going to keep pressing on and trust the lord's going to bless today so we're again on the mysteries of god in christ this will be part 12 is also having the preeminence in his people god having the primitives and his people this is part 4. so we'll go back to revelation chapter 10 verse 7 where we are with the mysteries of god in christ as we begin our scripture reading here but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished as he had declared to his servants the prophets i want you again to remember that mystery of god and the contrasting of mystery singular of god and mysteries plural of god if you may have missed this or not seen this up to this point mysteries of god the mystery of god being the revelation of jesus christ which has gone through the past two weekends of going into the scripture that that foundation of that church is laid upon the revelation of who jesus is that mystery of god was to be finished the completion of that in the bride today that's how she becomes that preeminent in her to fulfill that complete expression of jesus christ upon this earth today uh and he in in containing in jesus is the mysteries plural all the things that's been left out and tied up at this last day as that prophet of god brother brown took those loose ends tied them all together that's those mysteries well every bit of it's tied up in the mystery of god that was finished in that present day truth and that messenger brought to us no doubt it was all through the church ages of course we know and everyone played their part and it just happens to be that we're here at the end time and we're here at the end part of this we're going to finish this up by the grace of god and his help and of course the rapture culminating so as we're on part four of uh god having the preeminence in his people i want to go back to that subtitle verse that i want to read in colossians chapter one again colossians chapter one and maybe this one and maybe one more lord willing and we'll be live in our church next sunday lord willing um i want to finish this part of it up and then we'll get into that last part and see where the lord takes it from there so uh first uh colossians chapter 1 verse 17 and he is before all things jesus christ before all things and by him all things consist or stand they still stand today and he is jesus is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence for it please to follow that in him should all fullness dwell and remember went into that uh foundation of course we started with the beginning of the creation of god jesus revelation 3 14 i believe it is and got into uh the body the foundation foundation this church is built upon and last week we started building that body off of that foundation and seeing in a couple scriptures but of course first corinthians 12 jesus building that body and this body being fit and joined together and we are all part of the same mystical body of jesus christ internationally around the world we are all a part of that same mystical body of jesus christ we are one in him as that body as he is that that head of that cornerstone he is the foundation stone of this building of this church of this bride and he is the capstone that also being the beginning and the finishing the author and the finisher the alpha and omega he is the one that is our completeness and in him is that mysteries amen that's contained in the scripture that we see so we'll continue on as we've built up this body now that god has the preeminence in see we got to create that foundation first remember how important that foundation is we read last week how important that foundation is baptism is good reading your bible is great going to church is fantastic all that is is essential to a christian all of it must be done but unless you've got that right foundation then all the rest of it's just uh deeds that we do see just all deeds becomes something it means something it's meaningful to us when we know that we have that foundation that is built on the revelation of who jesus christ is again i'm going to say this he's not the second person of a godhead of a trinity excuse me he's not the second person of a trinity he's not some great prophet or something he is he is god almighty veiled in flesh so the revelation is built upon that and then and him having the preeminence as the head of this body has the preeminence in our lives if he doesn't have the preeminence then there's no way that this brian can fulfill the expression that jesus has called her for in this last day she's fulfilling that expression for that purpose that's why we're here that's our point of being here now i want to go and build on that hit a couple of nuances that i want to talk about here in the scripture today so in first peter chapter 2 uh i want to begin today to to start our foundation on the scripture and the message for today uh first peter chapter two uh we'll just begin with verse one first peter two one let's read it here wherefore laying aside all malice and all guile and hypocrisies and envies and all evil speakings as newborn babes desired a sincere milk of the word that ye may grow thereby grow thereby see if the if so be have tasted that the lord is gracious to whom coming listen now it's where i want to get to to whom coming of course we know he has been here and yet he is coming right and he's coming to take a bride home we're going to meet him in the air praise the lord that dissension of christ and the ascension of the bride as we meet him in the air to go to the lord's supper as to whom coming as unto a living stone amen a living stone is that living stone he was crucified he was buried he but he resurrected on the third day and he is that living stone that was disallowed we talked about indeed of men who is those men the builders those who are responsible for building uh the spiritual house by which jesus was to be the inhabiter of that was their purpose but they disallowed him they again put him at not set him aside worthless is how they declared him they took a thief over jesus christ the religious leader screamed out for barabbas a thief and a murder over jesus christ they disallowed indeed a man but he's chosen of god amen he was chosen of god but look not only was jesus chosen of god but those who come from him were chosen of god if you were from christ which we'll get to a little bit later if you are from christ you were chosen in god as well god chose you god hand picked you god deliberately wanted you and called you from his mind from before the foundation of the world as a part of him he called you as a part of him you are chosen you are uh in him from the beginning there was no beginning all the way back before there was a beginning you were in him so yes jesus was chosen look he was disallowing men but he was chosen of god and he is precious amen we've gotten to know how precious he is of course but i want you to know that you're chosen of god too as we keep reading listen now ye also amen has lively stones now what is that lively see that lively again here we got is is quickened or made alive see ephesians 2 told us that we were once dead in our sins we were dead in our sins see but the word quickened us made us alive now we are living stones we are lively stones we're not dead anymore we're not dead in sin we're dead to sin now see the difference of being a christian or not being a christian is if the non-christian he's still dead in his sin so he's dead but the christian is dead to sin she has nothing more to do with sin blessed is the man to whom god will not impute sin praise the lord oh i just love it now i don't know that we'll be able to do it today but next week getting to who we are friend you got this has got to bring you some faith this is this has got to bring faith to this pride to help us see see who we are who god has chose us to be it's not it wasn't something that we manufactured are made of god did this and he did it to you and for you because of who you are he chose you see we are lively stones quicken god with his holy spirit come into you who were once dead in sin that holy spirit come into you and made you alive quickened you as a lively stone you're a part of that building aren't you well amen a lot of these stone are built up a spiritual house now we of course like i said last week are individually built up a spiritual house for the indwelling presence of jesus christ as we individually are we are as a body of believers as each one is in its place each placement is building up the entire body we make up the mystical body of jesus christ but we're still the inhabitation of the holy spirit jesus christ built up a spiritual house a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to god by jesus christ we are to offer spiritual sacrifices that's acceptable to god those spiritual sacrifices that god has given us to be able to offer up i was challenged one time about the old testament some of you may know this and it's nobody in our church okay so but one time i was challenged about the old testament i said absolutely believe the old testament as much as i do it foreshadowed the new it brought forth the things that god was doing then and and just transferred it over when the blood of jesus christ christ came in the blood of jesus christ was he said well you still offer up sacrifice do you still sacrifice it absolutely of course we do of course the mindset there was the sacrifice of bull and goats and and and live animals that we take and slit our throats well no we don't do that but we are a holy priesthood offering up spiritual sacrifices god transformed it away from the blood of bulls and goats over to the blood of jesus christ now people have a hard time understanding that people stumble at that because because they don't understand why the blood why does it have to be such a mess well the blood is where the life is the blood is where the life is see you say well if you take the heart out you'll die of course you take the liver out or the kidneys or the brain and that's true but you can have every single organ in your body working absolutely perfect and not one speck of thing wrong with any organ in your body but if you take the blood out you're gonna die because the life is in the blood and see god knows that when he did that of course we created us put that life in us that life is in the blood the life of the body it's in the blood so when that blood was shed it was the representation of the life the blood cells was broke that released god when when the blood cell of christ was broke it released god see because that life is in that blood so it had to be that blood yeah one time they offered those bulls and goats and that's what was acceptable to god but no longer because the perfect sacrifice the lamb of god came and shed his blood and when that blood was shed we now offer up spiritual sacrifices of praise to our lord for what he's done for us that's the spiritual sacrifice as a holy priesthood that's not just a minister that's not just a man that's the bride that's all of us collectively as a bride internationally we all offer up spiritual sacrifices to the lord praising him worshiping him glorifying him living a life that's pleasing to him that's worshiping god when you go out and you live a life and you look like a christian you act like a christian you talk like a christian according to god's word you're worshiping the lord you're showing forth those spiritual sacrifices people may call you names and sell kind of things about us or the sisters or whatever you're offering up spiritual sacrifices to the lord when you walk in the walmart looking the way you do when you walk into the stores and grocery stores and places of in public you're offering spiritual sacrifices you're showing that you're a holy priesthood you're not belong to this world you don't belong to the devil you belong to god you're a lively stone you're no more dead in sin you're a lively stone that's coming offering spiritual sacrifice because you're a holy priesthood you're a minister your life preaches everywhere you go your life preaches to everybody amen i'm so thankful we still do all for spiritual sacrifices saints we still do offer sacrifices it's just not the slitting of the throats the bulls and dogs anymore amen but it's still that the transfer the blood of jesus christ and it's acceptable to god by jesus christ it's acceptable to god now because it's through jesus christ the bulls and goats one day was acceptable to god but it wasn't through jesus christ now it's through jesus christ which is our lord and savior and through him becomes acceptable so now we don't have to do the bulls and goats this is the more perfect sacrifice amen sixth verse wherefore also it is contained in the scripture behold i lay in zion a chief cornerstone elect precious and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded we believe on him see again laid in zion that chief cornerstone elected precious unto you therefore which believe he is precious and i do do you amen do you today believe he is precious amen therefore believe that he is precious but unto them which be disobedient the stone which the builders disallowed the same has made the head at the corner there we go again it's another place it tells us the builders rejected it the the the christian leaders of the world today many of them have rejected it the message came the message came to the united states it came through a humble uh uh kentuckian little ruddy man that wasn't much to look at but when he came forth with the word of god when god moved in his life friend everything had to stop back up because of what god had given to that man amen that prophet of god that god did here in america by how many people accept it today how many people believe it today it's been rejected jesus christ was rejected it was rejected then rejected by many down through the church ages rejected here at this last day jesus christ being rejected friend leaves one thing and that's judgment god help us that's where we are the builders disallowed the same jesus christ made it ahead of the corner and a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense even to them which stumbled at the word being disobedient whereunto also they were appointed because they have no revelation they have accepted a denomination they've accepted a seminary's teaching they've accepted some man's interpretation instead of the revelation of jesus christ and the word they've accepted some free god trinity explanation of being one god instead of realizing that he is one father son holy spirit is the same triune body a godhead of god himself he's not three he's one and they've rejected that that it becomes a rock of offense to them it's a stumbling stone they don't understand it but it has to come by revelation people reject revelation you remember the story of course brother brown told he met that guy and he said brother brown told him it's got to be it's got to be revealed to you he said well i reject revelation he said you reject god because the bible says you can't even believe him unless by the revelation of jesus christ you can't believe he exists but by the revelation amen got to believe who he is and even to them which they stumble at the word being disobedient where unto also they were appointed disobedient living in darkness and then trying to remember we get to darkness here people you know john 3 says that people love the darkness rather than the light that came to me this week the light came and it was like a revelation and i thought people are the way they are because they live in darkness they can't see that they're in the darkness because everything that's around them is dark that's all they can see darkness covered the earth grows darkness the people well they're in darkness they don't see because they're in darkness but they're darkness because they want to be in darkness they have chose their path they have chose their way and their destination and it is dark and they can't see because all that's around them is dark everybody tries to change those things but you can't unless the light comes and they receive the light those are the children of disobedience ninth verse but ye amen here we go again now see to this to this bride to us but ye are a chosen generation amen what i tell you we know we're chosen god chose us a chosen generation a royal priesthood now was a holy priesthood yeah it says a royal priesthood well holy priesthood of course is holy righteous uh royal is is his kingdomship is a rulership amen a royal someone who is a of a royal family the king queen princess whatever they belong to um a family that's that's forgive me but that family is an elite group because they're chosen by god it wasn't because you were born into a certain name of branham family or bennett family or jones or brown or john's or whatever it's not because you're born into that natural name family but we're a part of the family of god we've taken on his name we've taken on his characteristics we've taken on the mind of christ the mind of christ reflects christ because we do what he what that mind would do the only way you can have it is because you know the word by the word by the spirit of royal priesthood well of course it's royal why because god chose you well if he's the supreme if he's the preeminent then those who he chose have to be royalty because he chose them we're a part of his family a holy nation a peculiar people a peculiar people that ye should show forth the praises of him who called you out of darkness into the marvelous light see again you that you should show forth the praises of him what is that that that's what we just read over here in the fifth verse that's spiritual sacrifices we're to offer up spirits as a holy person all from spiritual sacrifices well we're a whole a royal priesthood holy nation peculiar people show forth the praises of him that's our spiritual sacrifices we our spiritual facts sacrifices are our praises to him not just that you go into church with some emotion it's not just that it seems like that people think things are better when they're louder and they're not just just because uh you know you you can go to a ball game or something and the louder they get that you think the better the game is you go to a church you think oh the louder the people the better the church service not necessarily might be but not necessarily noise doesn't equal it doesn't equate the same see but our praises come from our hearts our praises come from our life and we show forth those praises who call us out of darkness into that marvelous light well anybody that's in that darkness that would choose and decide and want to be called by god into that marvelous light can enter into that light if they want to be in that light but they choose darkness john 3 they prefer darkness over the light but god has called us out of that darkness we're no longer dead in sin we're dead to sin and now walking in the light of jesus christ walking in the light of the gospel of the word in that marvelous light which in time pass we're not a people but now the people of god which have um the people of god which had not obtained mercy but now have obtained mercy because we're the people of life we're we're a royal priesthood we're a holy generation we're a holy nation see as one remember that body is not just body here is as literal my body but body adjective figurative a body internationally a many member body once that was in one man jesus christ but when christ died and rose again and came back he came back and split himself through the spirit part into a many member body and from that 120 it's gone out around the world and there's i don't know how many now thousands millions around the world to have the spirit of god in them because of that one thing was once in one man now it's in the many member body of jesus christ we're all a part of that body as lively stones living stones we've been quickened made alive stones that fit into that body that god has the preeminence god is the head of it god is the one that's in control of this body he has called us out of light see um as a nation as a as a a group see because that that nation that tells us there that we're a part of uh makes us a part of one another makes us a part of him we're all a part of each other god is the head of that corner amen we're that house that god chose to live in that household or that family that family is a body we're all a part of that same family amen being a part of him let's move on ephesians chapter five ephesians chapter five we'll begin uh reading with verse 21. pardon me ephesians 5 21. ephesians 5 21 is continuing with this headship amen this headship ephesians 5 21 submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of god wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands as unto the lord for the husband is the head of the wife even as christ is the head of the church and he is the savior of the body again god reminding us the spiritual typing the natural the natural typing the spiritual god's helping us understand the feminist part being under subjection to the male part helping us realize that why submitting themselves to their own husbands as unto the lord amen now as as unto the lord you've got to remember that part the husband is the head of the wife even as christ is the head of the church and that's true and you say that brings well then then the husband is the the ruler well you better be careful where you go with that rulership buddy because you're responsible to god for that and god is the one that will hold you responsible so uh you want to make sure that you're going to take on that holy responsibility you understand what that responsibility holds because you're responsible to god for that and for her amen because it's as unto the lord husband is the head of the wife even as christ is the head of the church he is the head of his bride amen the head of that body the church and is the savior of the body therefore as the church is subject unto christ so let the wives be uh be to their own husbands in everything husbands love your wives even as christ also loved the church and gave himself for it there you go you got to understand if you have if you understand how jesus loves his bride you can understand how much him as the head loves you and gave his life for you and what he did for us that we can put ourselves in that position of recognizing that headship then we can understand the position that we are to fulfill as men as husbands because that honor that's supposed to be bestowed goes both ways friends it goes both ways that honor that's supposed to be uh given is is on both sides see the husband's the head of the wife he was christ said head of the church therefore as the church is subject becomes christ let the wise be their own husband husbands love your wives even as christ also loved the church and he gave himself forth he loved this church so much he gave himself for it that he might sanctify and cleanse it with a washing of water by the word now what's god doing what's jesus doing for his bride he not only saved her but he called her and separated her and put her aside washing her with the water sanctifying and cleansing her with the washing of the water see the the he's typing this of course the husband and and christ the church the bride as the church he not only gave himself for it but he he did that so he could be the one to sanctify her that he could be the one to cleanse her that he could be the one to purify her that he could be the one to to consecrate her sanctifies consecrating and cleanses to purify her by the washing of the water of the word if you take the water and that washing uh brother brahm talks about it quite extensively and invisible union but you go back into uh numbers uh believe it's chapter 19 in the waters of separation when you get into the waters of separation what did that do what that did of course you'd say well you still believe the old testament yeah i do and and all that does is bring from then of the literal washing that they had there and those waters of separation was to bring a divine remember you're a royal priesthood you're a holy nation we're not talking about the united states we're not talking about germany england uh france china we're talking about you the body of jesus christ we're talking about the bride of jesus christ you as that body that holy nation you are called by god that separates you that waters of separation the old testament was what god brought to them to cleanse them see to cleanse and to purify to consecrate them so that they would be a separate people that's why god gave of course abraham the seal of circumcision to the men that's why he give to the the the group the things that they needed to do the course all the holy days the religious ceremonies and and the priests had to have this garment and everything just right god gave all those things to them to separate them from all the rest of the world why did god separate them because there are different people they were called to serve him they were called as his people they weren't to look like serpent seed they weren't to look like the world they weren't to look like the city folk they were god called god ordained god chosen consecrated and purified they were separate god called them separate he changed their diet he changed their clothes he changed everything about them well for him when you become washed and cleansed and consecrated you become a part of him you are his chosen so those waters of the separation of the word it's the word that does the separation now amen and we're not talking about prejudice we're not talking about racism we're talking about god's people amen you say well god is it is do we believe in segregation well when it comes to the work we do but that's the only dividing line has nothing to do with the prejudice has nothing to do with racism because as christians as god loved everybody we do we lose there's nothing so souls were 10 million worlds man how could we ever think anything derogatory about someone with a soul contained worth a million worlds no no because because of who we are and we know how precious life is that's why we don't agree with those that would get in office that would uh promote abortion uh i would never vote for someone who uh promoted abortion because it's not uh it's murder so but we'll move on from that but you understand that waters of separation jesus came himself made us a royal priesthood by sanctifying us as the head of the body amen he's the head notice the responsibilities we said before as the head sanctified cleansed consecrated purified this bride by the washing of the water by the word the word brings the separation amen the word brings to separation so you say the word is everything else god does for us in the separating of helping us see that we're different as a peculiar people from the rest of the world we are god called god chosen not everybody is and that may sound bad may sound prideful i don't know what you want to think about it that's what the bible says if you're a part of it then it doesn't matter if you're a part of it then there's nothing to it you're just a part of it see you you don't get mad at it you don't consider it a prejudiced or anything because you're part of it if you're a part of it then you're just that's just who you are see because you're a part of it it's just like the only people that yell and scream at the cops today are the ones that are crooks the good law-abiding citizens aren't screaming and yelling at the cops because they obey the law the the ones that are screaming and yelling and don't like cops around the people that are things the people that don't do things wrong that or don't obey the law those that people don't like them anyway we'll move on that's a whole other subject but the washing the water is what separates us amen who did that jesus by what means the word washington the water by the word that waters of separation has brought us and divided us apart from the rest of the world now we're not a part of the rest of the world we don't belong to the rest of the world jesus is our husband we are his bride and we owe our fidelity to him solely to him amen we'll get to that in a minute we owe our fidelity to him we are we are chased to the lord amen because we've been separated he is the savior of the body become a holy priesthood to offer spiritual sacrifices as a separate people amen and whoever and whosoever will let them come see i'm not saying my foreign no more it's whosoever will so whosoever is part of that wonderful that's great we're all a part of that same mystical body of jesus christ amen 27 first that he might present it to himself present it who me you the bride presented to who himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish how in the world do we as humans obtain a garment that's without spot wrinkle or blemish that he would present to himself because it's his garment we were wrote in his righteousness not ours he took my place at calvary so i could take his here i jettisoned my sin corruptable garnet to take on his righteous garment now that garment was without spot wrinkle or blemish so it's not me it's him it's him working that work in me that he might present us this bride to himself as a glorious church not having spot wrinkle or any such thing holy without blemish praise the lord now we're robed in his righteousness now wonder you can approach the throne of god boldly because you're standing not on your own merits but on his you're not standing on your own righteousness but he is that helps us understand he took my place so i could take his well that's more than just a song friend that's a reality that's a fact that's something that brings us into perfect community fellowship with the lord because he took our place he's made us blessed is the man whom god will not repute sin amen righteous as he is righteous so what men to love their wives as their own bodies men love your wives as your own bodies you want to beat up on her beat up on yourself give yourself a bloody nose break your arm there you go that's what it's supposed to be you're supposed to love your wife as yourself if you want to make her a punching bag make yourself a punching bag go slam into the wall knock yourself upside the head with crowbar that you do it because it says your own body see you say well that's foolishness mutant really is it what does the bible say how does god look at it i'm not worried about you think about what the hospital says the doctor says i couldn't care less about what the doctors hospitals say what does god say how does god look at it when we do those things and act that way what is god thinking about you the bible says that a man that would that should love his wife as his own body he that loveth his wife loveth himself for no man ever yet hateth his own flesh but nerds and cherished it even as the lord the church oh yeah you stand fine and clear and perfect amen well you've done that to her whatever that's not god amen that's the devil that's a satanic spirit for we are members of his body of his flesh of his bone for this cause shall men leave his father and mother and shall be joined unto his wife and they too shall be one flesh this is a great mystery but i speak concerning concerning christ in the church this is a great mystery singular or what's he talking about he's talking about christ in the church yes it's a type of the bride it's a type of the bride of humans of men and women but he's talking about bride about christ in his church see we came from one another we came from him the man is to love his wife as he loves himself because he loves jesus it's like i've said many times friend i you know people think that this bride is going to have to go through some big punishment or some great tribulation or something friend we don't do that god didn't marry us brother man who said god didn't marry this pride to put her through a bunch of punishment he didn't marry her carry her across the threshold and then beat up on her no no no doesn't work that way see let me read you this quote here mystery of christ is a mystery now you see the secret what to the restored fallen eve as she was a pre-figure eve was a pre-figure of the church and now as god opened up the sight of adam and took out eve by his own flesh and blood divided in his spirit masculine feminist course masculine state adam finished spirit he put an e to feminist she put in eve took the rib from under his side and made eve out of it so god did the same thing god did the same thing taking out of the side of christ the blood and the water and christ is the word and taking the word in making up his church amen his bride a word bride without spot wrinkle or blemish see eve back to himself again redeemed by the blood that was to come from his body out of his own body this bride came from his own body came this bride amen you see it now god's great mystery being unfolded it's been hidden since the foundation of the world prefigured all the way down through watch it now see that says mysteries that was his brought in in the revelation of jesus christ and here in ephesians many other places it'll give you to it because she is to be a word church a word bride now down through the ages he has been slowly unfolding this mystery revealing it now can you see down through what happened in pre-figure now he opened adam's side took out the flesh which is adam to make eve the bride has to be the word because he is the word she is the word because he is the word he's not the word because she's the word she's the word because he's the word because she came from him that's how he could cleanse her sanctify her unto himself and present him to himself as he brought the spot wrinkle or blemish because it's the word we the bride are the word because of the word be made flesh that makes her that expression of jesus christ that preeminence in her makes her that expression amen now i want to look i i got a couple more scriptures i don't know if i get both of my time's running out but i want to go to first corinthians chapter 6 and verse 12. first corinthians chapter 6 verse 12 and i want to start reading here because i want to get back to the point that we were just reading in ephesians where paul's talking about husband and wife or paul's talking about the the natural type and the spiritual of christ and the bride and the husband and the and and the wife see and and how we belong to him man we're bought with a price see we're not our own because we're bought with a price but first corinthians 6 12 all things are lawful unto me but all things are not expedient or profitable or good paul's saying i could do anything lawfully but i can't do anything that that's not profitable or good that might put a stumbling block or something in front of somebody oh i could do it and i could do it legally or by the word but i wouldn't do certain things just because it might stumble somebody else is what he's saying it's not expedient or good to do it see all things are lawful for me but i will not be brought under the power of any there you go then he just didn't in a nutshell just sew up my preeminence he just paul just said i will not be under the power of any amen he has the preeminence i'm not going to be under the power of a government under the power of of anybody i'm going to be under the power of jesus christ yes we give honor to our president we give honor to our bosses things like that we do those that have we honor those that have rule over that's the bible we know that but i will not be brought under the power of anybody but jesus christ has the preeminence in me the preeminence in you eats for the belly the belly for meats and what he's talking about now is i'm not i'm not even gonna be brought under the power of my own body is that okay i mean there's a real important part of fasting i i know you know the bible says praying fast that we like to pray fast but there is a part of fasting unfortunately hopefully people still do it i'm thankful the lord give it to me to be able to do but um but i hope we do it but notice he's saying and this power is actually reserved even to you and your own will he's reserving this to your own body's control or your own willpower see of your own self this if we were to go by our own cells where would we end up but he's talking i'm not going to come under the power of that means for the belly the belly for meats but god shall destroy both of them i'm not going to come under power to that but god shall destroy both uh it in them now the body is not for fornication but for the lord and the lord for the body fornication is unclean living amen and people think it's just a certain act but brother brown tells us fornication is just unclean living see so the body paul's saying now the body is not for fornication but for the lord and the lord is for the body see not to mention now that fornication is not just a physical fornication it's not just a natural unclean living that is spiritual too friend that is spiritual if you're partake if you claim to be jesus christ and you're partaking of something that's hybrid or man-made or you're falling along under the hospice of of some organization or denomination or something and you're you're being controlled by them and what they're feeding you is their dogma then you're under their control paul says i won't be brought up the power of any but we now fall under the headship of him the body is not for fornication it's not fun clean living neither is the spirit your spirit's not for fornication brother god put away his original bride for spiritual fornication we are not for fornication see we're not for unclean living we are for the lord our body our spirit our souls they are the lords they don't belong to me amen i sold them to him i gave them to him i want him to have them i am bought with a price i no longer my own is that the scripture we are no longer our own we are bought with a price i belong to him see god has both raised up the lord and will raise up us by his own power so now not only do we come out of jesus christ at calvary but he has raised us up well he's raised us up has quickened us lively stones were sitting in heavenly places in christ jesus now what is that that's the bride's place each one of your positions in that body is sitting in that heavenly place place is plural because there's many member bodies see but we're all a part of that same body he raised up the lord will also raise us up by his own power romans 8 says that same spirit dwell in you it will quicken you your mortal body make it alive raise it up friend aren't that you know what we're looking for our loved ones are gone before to appear before us anytime anytime and the power of that resurrection the power that rapture is going to change these bodies we're going to go into up the air meet him to a land who the marriage supper of the lamb know you not that your bodies are the members of christ shall i then take the members of christ and and make them the members of a harlot god forbid that's not just physical now that's spiritual we are to be chaste to the lord amen we are chaste to the lord not to fornicate with unclean living spiritually or naturally we are to yoke ourselves up with the pure revealed word what no you're not that he which is joined to a harlot is one body for two shall the two saith he shall be one flesh so that's flesh what about spirit one if we're joined to christ we're one in him we're one oh i just i love that philippians 2. we've read it through this series maybe next time maybe next week we'll read it again we yoked with him or one let me move on but he uh but he that is joined unto the lord is one spirit flee fornication every sin that a man doeth is without the body but he that committed fornication sinneth against his own body what know ye not that your body is the temple of the holy ghost which is in you which ye have of god and ye are not your own for ye are bought with a price therefore glorify god in your body your spirit which are god's we belong to him we are bought with a price we are not our own amen paul obviously they were debating with him there and he said what he steals them he says what know ye not that your body is the temple of the holy ghost amen your body is the temple of the holy ghost this is where the presence of the spirit of god jesus christ dwells no you're not your body is the temple of the holy ghost which is in you the holy ghost which he have of god we are not our own we're bought with a price if we're bought with a price we don't want to be yoked up with someone else or something else or fornicate or flirt with the world or flirt with some denomination or something or something darkness oh god no lord help us we this bride is chaste to him we are we are yoked with him we are one in him we came from him the word we are the word and married back and joined back with him as one flesh as one body as one member of that body praise the lord he is the head of that body he is the preeminence over that body he has a preeminence in me why because i'm bought you know i can go to a store and i could want an apple as long as that apple is in that store and belongs to the store owner that store owner can do whatever he wants to that apple belongs to him i can go to the store and i can look at the apple and i can pick it up if he lets me i can pick it up of course with kovac now you might not even be allowed to do that but i don't know anyway if you pick up an apple if he allows you to because it's not your apple but once you take that apple and you pay for it it becomes yours when it becomes yours you can do whatever you want to with it because it's yours belongs to you now doesn't belong to anybody else doesn't belong to the store anymore you don't belong to satan anymore you belong to jesus christ you don't belong to yourself you belong to christ and if we belong to christ then we do what he calls for us to do because it has the preeminence in our lives because we're bought with that price god has paid for us god shed his precious blood gave his precious life that we would be bought with that price that we would belong to him now he does what he desires with us and we say yes lord yes lord now if apple had legs mouth they could run and talk and whatever had a spirit a heart soul then they could have their own free will and you have your own free will but what i i've died to myself though to raise in jesus christ that he might have the preeminence a bride like that is the only bride the only group that could be the full expression of jesus christ for this last day and that's what he wants us to be we belong to him holy fully totally we belong to him amen we are his purchased possession and there's one more scripture i want to read real quick we want to expound on it very much but just to follow up with what we just read if he just read to you um that we are bought with the price of ephesians now ephesians chapter 1 verse 13 and 14. look at this real quick we close ephesians 1 13 in whom ye also trusted after that ye heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation in whom also after that ye believed ye were sealed with the holy spirit of promise after that you believed other denominations a lot of christians and well a lot of millions believe this but those that do think maybe to get it in simultaneously instantaneously and you can but the bible says here after that ye believed you were sealed with the holy spirit of promise which is the earnest the down payment of our inheritance unto until the redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory what is that purchased possession we belong to him we are bought with a price we are bought with a price where his purchased possession now we belong to him now we have received that earnest or that down payment of our eternal inheritance until the full redemption not just that we've been redeemed spiritually but the full redemption of these bodies changing go to meet him in the air that full redemption when that full redemption takes place then we go to meet him in the air that's the redemption to with the redemption of our bodies because we belong to him we're bought with a price you are no longer your own see unto uh until the redemption of the purchased possession that's you that is me that full redemption of the purchased possession we are the possession he has purchased unto the praise of his glory amen lord will a navy we can pick up there next week but we are his possession amen we are purchased of him he paid the ultimate price he paid the highest price that could be paid to redeem this pride back to himself now we belong to him because we belong to him he is the preeminence i don't belong to myself i belong to him oh my i want to get to that next part but we're going to stop there um i'd really like to take it from there we'll do that lord willing to the lord jerry's next week uh in our own building so praise the lord god bless you prayed something to say to bless you today strengthen and help you in some way look friend we're a peculiar people we're in the world but not of the world

we belong to him he has the preeminence in us because he bought us cleansed us sanctified us and is presenting us to himself as a chaste virgin pure holy righteous without spot wrinkle or blemish amen i know sometimes you might not feel that way but that's the word that's the truth it's because it's it's not your work you did it anyway it's his work so praise the lord not based on me it's based on
