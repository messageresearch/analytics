[25:32] prayed that the lord would just take
[25:34] care of it and pray anything bad on the
[25:36] boy
[25:37] but he ended up like the next day having

[27:28] what god might when we
[27:31] are
[27:31] dwelling together in unity and love one
[27:35] for another and lord it really touched
[27:37] my heart what our pastor said about
[27:40] abraham our father of the faith that he
[27:43] sought for a city who builder and maker
[27:47] was god and lord he knew that this
[27:50] wasn't a permanent dwelling place but
[27:53] you had a heavenly place awaiting him
[27:56] and us and all the believers
[28:00] trust you in your word and believe your
[28:02] promises i remember billy graham said
[28:05] there's over 3 000 promises in the bible

[29:21] desires of our hearts amen

[46:47] amen
[46:48] amen genesis chapter 1 verse 1.
[46:51] i will start reading in the beginning
[46:54] god
[46:55] created the heaven and the earth
[46:58] and the earth was without form and void
[47:01] and darkness was upon the face of the
[47:03] deep the spirit of god moved upon the
[47:06] face of the waters
[47:08] god said let there be light and there
[47:09] was light and god saw the light that it
[47:12] was good
[47:13] and god divided the light from the
[47:15] darkness and god called the night the
[47:17] light day and the darkness he called
[47:19] night and the evening and the morning
[47:21] with the first day
[47:22] and you could be seated if you'd like
[47:24] praise god
[47:26] amen as you're seated turn over with me
[47:28] to genesis chapter 8.
[47:33] we're going to go to genesis chapter 8
[47:35] now
[47:38] read a few verses of scripture here and
[47:40] then we're going to turn over to acts
[47:41] chapter 2.
[47:44] genesis chapter 8
[47:46] we'll start with verse 15
[47:50] genesis 8 15 and god spake unto noah
[47:53] saying
[47:54] go forth of the ark thou and thy wife
[47:57] and thy sons and thy sons wives with
[47:59] thee
[48:00] bring forth with thee every living thing
[48:02] that is with thee of all flesh both the
[48:05] fowl and of catalan of every creeping
[48:07] thing that creepeth upon the earth that
[48:09] they may uh breed abundantly in the
[48:12] earth and be fruitful and multiply upon
[48:14] the earth
[48:15] and noah went forth and his sons his
[48:18] wives
[48:19] his wife and his son's wives with him
[48:22] every beast every creeping thing and
[48:24] every fowl and whatsoever creepeth upon
[48:26] the earth after their kind went forth
[48:30] out of the ark
[48:32] one more acts chapter 2.
[48:37] amen we want to girl turn over to acts
[48:39] chapter 2 read a few verses of scripture
[48:42] here
[48:45] amen acts chapter two i'm going to begin
[48:48] with verse one
[48:50] in acts chapter two
[48:52] and when the day of pentecost was fully
[48:54] come they were all with one accord in
[48:57] one place
[48:58] suddenly there came a sound from heaven
[49:00] as of a rushing mighty wind and it
[49:03] filled all the house where they were
[49:05] sitting and there appeared unto them
[49:07] cloven tongues like as a fire and it sat
[49:10] upon each of them and
[49:12] they were all filled with the holy ghost
[49:15] and began to speak with other tongues as
[49:18] the spirit gave them utterance
[49:21] amen now these three scriptures may
[49:25] seem
[49:26] odd to join together and to read
[49:28] together but there is one commonality
[49:31] that these three scriptures have
[49:34] each of these three scriptures
[49:38] uh institutes a new beginning
[49:42] and that's what i want to speak on today
[49:45] uh probably again for the next few
[49:46] sundays however the lord leads it uh i
[49:49] want to speak on the new beginning
[49:51] new beginning in the beginning god
[49:54] created then you had another beginning
[49:56] after the andaluvian world and the flood
[49:59] then you had another new beginning here
[50:01] on the day of pentecost after jesus was
[50:04] born died resurrected sent his spirit
[50:08] back upon the earth there was another
[50:10] beginning but there is to be a new
[50:12] beginning even after this point and we
[50:15] know what that new beginning is the new
[50:17] heaven and the new earth
[50:19] but to get to that point uh
[50:22] let's just take it a little bit at a
[50:24] time shall we so as we begin back at the
[50:27] beginning uh in the beginning when god
[50:30] created the heaven and the earth in the
[50:32] beginning
[50:33] we know that
[50:34] uh that the word
[50:36] specifically
[50:38] tells us and brother branham told us
[50:40] excuse me
[50:42] that
[50:43] there is a
[50:44] major occurrence every 2 000 years
[50:47] approximately
[50:49] every 2 000 years now i want to get into
[50:51] something with a little detail today but
[50:53] not be uh too lengthy with it but a but
[50:56] a little detail to understand some
[50:58] things of where we are today
[51:01] because there's a lot happens between
[51:04] genesis 1 and where we are right now or
[51:06] genesis 1 and revelation 21 uh when the
[51:09] new heaven and the new earth that god
[51:11] shows to john coming down from heaven as
[51:13] a bride ignored for her husband there's
[51:15] a lot that happens between point a and
[51:17] point b
[51:18] uh but to start but to get to point b we
[51:22] need to we need to start with point a
[51:24] and and work our way to that place so uh
[51:27] i want to get to a couple of things to
[51:29] mention today uh and and one of them is
[51:33] to lay the groundwork for this is that
[51:35] we understand scripturally that there's
[51:39] a major occurrence on the earth every
[51:42] two thousand years from the time that
[51:44] god said in the beginning in the
[51:46] beginning god created well we know
[51:49] there's no beginning to god because he's
[51:50] elohim the self-existing god that never
[51:53] had a beginning and never will have an
[51:55] ending but for us and for our
[51:57] understanding and our little human p
[51:59] brains there was a beginning that we can
[52:01] look to how do we know that before
[52:04] this specific beginning there weren't
[52:06] other beginnings in other worlds and
[52:08] other things that god did we don't know
[52:11] he's god he can do whatever he wants
[52:13] people debate all the
[52:15] terrestrial activity and and celestial
[52:18] the et and all that stuff uh out in and
[52:22] who knows what god has beyond our
[52:25] reach as human beings we don't know but
[52:27] we know he's god and we know he's
[52:28] capable of doing anything and he can do
[52:31] and will do anything he wants to do so
[52:34] that's in his hands but to us
[52:36] we have an in the beginning that in the
[52:38] beginning is what we look to
[52:40] to start with so in that beginning god
[52:43] created now from that creation up to the
[52:46] time that god now it's strange because
[52:48] it only took seven chapters as we see
[52:51] scripturally in the bible to go for that
[52:54] two thousand years in that first period
[52:58] it only took seven chapters of the bible
[53:00] from genesis 1 to genesis 8. the world
[53:03] had become so bad the world had become
[53:06] so corrupt uh that god himself even said
[53:10] of course the word says he repented that
[53:13] he made man
[53:14] that the world had gotten so bad he
[53:16] repented that he made man so he
[53:19] destroyed
[53:20] all of the things that was upon the
[53:22] earth except we know upon the ark the
[53:25] the a souls and the animals and the
[53:27] things that god preserved that after the
[53:29] flood would be able to come out in a new
[53:32] beginning to start over again that's why
[53:34] god told them when they came off the ark
[53:37] be fruitful and multiply let the animals
[53:39] go forth and be fruitful and multiplied
[53:41] the humans which is animal flesh go
[53:44] forth and be fruitful and multiply and
[53:47] and that was the multiplication that
[53:49] began that new beginning it did not
[53:51] eradicate sin however like in the
[53:54] beginning there was no sin sin was still
[53:58] remember brother aaron teaches us that
[53:59] the serpents he went through the ark
[54:02] the serpent scene went through the ark
[54:04] and on the other side there was still
[54:06] that sin but it was a new beginning of
[54:09] another what we know to be the 2000
[54:12] years after the flood or as we could
[54:14] term it uh as the world's terminology is
[54:18] as well they used to i don't know if
[54:19] they do anymore or not um
[54:22] did they still term
[54:24] uh
[54:25] the smart kids that go to school do they
[54:27] still call
[54:28] the time between there and before jesus
[54:31] christ was born do they still call that
[54:33] a uh bc
[54:35] yeah
[54:36] they still in school they still call it
[54:37] bc so we we still
[54:40] i still call it that i just don't know
[54:42] if they officially called bc that's the
[54:44] bc time before christ
[54:46] in between that time another 2 000 years
[54:49] that takes us all the way through to the
[54:51] birth of jesus christ and then there's
[54:53] the a.d after christ now does he still
[54:55] call it a.d
[54:57] i don't know okay so
[54:59] we will for that point of understanding
[55:01] that after death after christ and his
[55:04] death burial and resurrection that's the
[55:06] a.d period of the time that we live now
[55:08] in this 2000 year so there's a major
[55:11] occurrence that happens like that every
[55:13] 2000 years upon the earth let me read
[55:16] you something here
[55:18] in future home now if you've never
[55:20] listened to future home
[55:22] uh i would encourage you to do so now
[55:24] it's
[55:26] three hours and 45 minute four hour
[55:28] sermon so it's quite lengthy uh it would
[55:32] be challenging to listen to especially
[55:34] with most of our busy schedules in one
[55:36] sitting
[55:38] but if you could listen to it a little
[55:41] at a time 30 minutes a day hour a day
[55:43] whatever you can do it'll really be a
[55:45] blessing to you it's a very powerful
[55:47] sermon and kind of gave me the thought
[55:49] for this series here on the new
[55:52] beginning but from that
[55:54] future home the future home of the
[55:56] heavenly bridegroom and earthly bride
[55:59] is the full title
[56:01] he preached it in august of 1964. he
[56:03] makes this statement
[56:06] the world
[56:07] has now almost 6 000 years now remember
[56:10] he says almost 6 000 years so
[56:14] this is going to be a little less
[56:16] evangelistic today and a little more
[56:17] teaching if you will
[56:19] there has been almost 6 000 years but
[56:21] not understand brother brown spoke this
[56:24] in 1964.
[56:26] now we're 22 plus years beyond the year
[56:30] 2000
[56:32] okay and i want to i want to try to
[56:33] break something down to you later even
[56:35] about that
[56:36] but in 1964
[56:39] brother branstad now we've been almost 6
[56:41] 000 years uh that's the world almost 6
[56:45] 000 years old see in every 2 000 years
[56:49] it's had a destruction of some kind an
[56:52] event that's took place now brother
[56:55] branham called it destruction
[56:57] but the the first 2 000 years was
[57:00] certainly a destruction where god
[57:03] destroyed all the light that was on the
[57:04] earth except for what was on the ark
[57:06] certainly the second one was of course
[57:09] jesus christ when christ came and
[57:12] sacrificed his life at calvary he
[57:15] dropped his blood upon the earth was
[57:16] that major event
[57:18] destructive
[57:21] maybe wouldn't be considered a
[57:22] destructive time but we but we do know
[57:25] that that was a major occurrence that
[57:27] took place
[57:29] when jesus christ dropped the chemistry
[57:32] of the blood from his body the body of
[57:34] god that dropped upon this earth it
[57:37] bought
[57:38] b-o-u-g-h-t
[57:40] bought
[57:41] that earth back to its original place
[57:44] because this was god's creation god
[57:47] created it it was his but when adam lost
[57:49] it he lost his inheritance he lost his
[57:52] right to life and he lost the earth that
[57:56] he had control over he lost the book of
[57:58] life which he had in his hands he lost
[58:00] all to the one that he lost it to except
[58:03] of course the book of life which satan's
[58:05] dirty hands couldn't take it that way
[58:06] back to god but he lost this earth and
[58:09] satan took claims over this earth now
[58:12] satan still has a
[58:15] as a squatter
[58:17] rights upon the earth but he does not
[58:19] own it anymore when jesus christ dropped
[58:22] that blood upon it it bought this earth
[58:25] as we have said so many times about our
[58:27] own selves this earth out of the
[58:30] pawnshop god redeemed this earth the
[58:34] earth itself from which all of our
[58:36] bodies came
[58:37] he redeemed by dropping his the
[58:40] chemistry of his blood upon the earth a
[58:43] major occurrence a new beginning that
[58:46] started now we know for us that new
[58:49] beginning was the spirit of the blood
[58:52] that came and went to god and came back
[58:54] upon the worshipper in the form of the
[58:56] holy spirit that was our new beginning
[58:59] as a spiritual perspective for this 2000
[59:02] years that we are still in
[59:04] so the andaluvian world the destruction
[59:07] the flood
[59:08] the uh the the bc world before christ
[59:13] the dropping of his blood upon the earth
[59:15] and then the bc or
[59:18] a.d
[59:19] world which we live in now that was
[59:21] after that time which will in
[59:24] in due time will find its destruction as
[59:27] well
[59:28] by fire
[59:30] so brother brown again every 2 000 years
[59:33] it's had a destruction
[59:35] first 2000 has been a major currency
[59:38] every 2 000 years first 2000 the flood
[59:41] came and he baptized it with what water
[59:44] amen baptize this world with water
[59:48] next 2000 jesus came to sanctify and
[59:51] claim it by dropping his blood upon it
[59:54] and called it his own again brought it
[59:57] back redeemed the earth back to its
[1:00:00] rightful owner back to the right place
[1:00:02] that's why he says
[1:00:04] pawn shop because a person one person
[1:00:06] was a a rightful owner if i went and
[1:00:09] bought this phone
[1:00:10] and i went and bought this phone and it
[1:00:12] was mine and i took it to a pawn shop
[1:00:15] and said okay i want a little money for
[1:00:17] that but i reserve the right to come
[1:00:19] back and buy this phone back from you
[1:00:21] when i get the money to be able to do it
[1:00:23] that's why the pawns ask why i guess
[1:00:25] brother random so aptly called it out of
[1:00:27] the pawn shop because it never really
[1:00:30] relinquished his right to it he always
[1:00:34] had the ability to go back and claim
[1:00:36] that property for his own again
[1:00:39] paying the right price with the right
[1:00:41] price in this case was the life and
[1:00:44] blood of jesus christ god himself that
[1:00:47] brought this earth back so when that
[1:00:49] blood went to the ground and bought this
[1:00:51] earth back to god so now it belongs to
[1:00:53] him again
[1:00:54] and if it belongs to him it belongs to
[1:00:56] you because everything that was he
[1:00:58] everything that is his is ours
[1:01:00] and of course he had to do that you say
[1:01:03] well why the earth because every one of
[1:01:05] our bodies come from this earth
[1:01:08] the bodies that we are housed in the
[1:01:10] bodies of every christian every son or
[1:01:13] daughter of god from time the beginning
[1:01:16] of time
[1:01:17] belong that came from this earth
[1:01:20] belongs to god amen every one of them
[1:01:23] you say this body will be annihilated no
[1:01:25] it will not
[1:01:27] this body does not get annihilated it
[1:01:30] gets it it gets its uh uh it comes into
[1:01:34] a glorified condition
[1:01:37] it doesn't get annihilated and done away
[1:01:38] with it we have no need for that well
[1:01:41] yeah we do because the bible says we do
[1:01:43] brother branham said we would
[1:01:46] amen we come back
[1:01:49] when we leave this world uh let's just
[1:01:52] say the saints that have gone on
[1:01:54] uh they're in a heavenly realm now
[1:01:57] they're in their theophany
[1:01:58] but when that voice calls that theolph
[1:02:01] and he comes back and as brother branham
[1:02:03] said picks up this body in a glorified
[1:02:07] condition amen that's why it's able to
[1:02:09] be here that's why christ was able to be
[1:02:12] here
[1:02:13] and it comes in a glorified condition so
[1:02:16] that is
[1:02:18] the glorified condition that god called
[1:02:21] why the purpose of this earth needed to
[1:02:23] be purchased back
[1:02:25] amen because every bit of us you're not
[1:02:28] just your soul was bought saints
[1:02:31] amen your spirit your body god owns it
[1:02:33] all
[1:02:34] he all of all who we are belongs to god
[1:02:37] not just our soul
[1:02:39] our soul is going back to him that's the
[1:02:41] most important thing of course because
[1:02:43] that's the life that's the that's the
[1:02:45] thing that houses god
[1:02:47] but this body god's coming to pick this
[1:02:50] uh we are coming to pick our these
[1:02:52] bodies back up in a glorified condition
[1:02:54] live in a glorified state
[1:02:56] brother branham said i used to wonder
[1:02:58] uh when i get on the other side well
[1:03:00] we'll just be like clouds and just
[1:03:01] floating around and saying oh hey dennis
[1:03:04] hey uh lydia
[1:03:07] hey you doing and just floating by as
[1:03:09] clouds just going around up there and
[1:03:11] then he said god took him on the uh
[1:03:12] beyond the curtain of time and showed
[1:03:15] him and he got up there and there were
[1:03:16] humans standing just like you and i are
[1:03:18] right now
[1:03:19] he went up and shook their hands hugged
[1:03:21] their necks sisters because there's no
[1:03:23] sensation there hugging him around the
[1:03:26] neck or our precious brother yes he said
[1:03:29] it's just as real as it is right here
[1:03:31] why because god purchased this back so
[1:03:34] that we would be in that condition when
[1:03:36] we get there yes but it'll just be a
[1:03:38] glorified kid it'll be in the state that
[1:03:41] it was supposed to be in the garden of
[1:03:43] eden to start with
[1:03:44] amen
[1:03:45] before sin entered in before sin took
[1:03:48] control that's why his blood had to come
[1:03:51] and redeem that back so that part that
[1:03:54] that 2000 years that brought this uh
[1:03:57] this
[1:03:58] earth back to himself he claimed it
[1:04:01] dropped his blood upon it and called it
[1:04:03] his
[1:04:04] praise the lord
[1:04:06] all right i'll come again king and queen
[1:04:08] this and he says the second but he means
[1:04:10] the third because that's the first
[1:04:12] second then this would be the third two
[1:04:13] thousand years
[1:04:15] uh what does he do
[1:04:17] he comes and gives his rest period and
[1:04:20] then burns her off and claims it for his
[1:04:22] own and his own come back on it and now
[1:04:26] he's talking about uh a a millennium or
[1:04:29] type of seventh day that he comes back
[1:04:31] but each each time remember each period
[1:04:35] there's something that happens after
[1:04:37] each period of each 2000 years there's
[1:04:40] an occurrence that takes place
[1:04:42] a major occurrence that takes place that
[1:04:45] was
[1:04:45] the the point that brother branham was
[1:04:47] trying to make here that occurrence that
[1:04:49] happens every 2000 years now that brings
[1:04:52] us to a point
[1:04:55] it brings us to a point that
[1:04:59] people so many times get themselves
[1:05:01] scrupled up in
[1:05:03] they try to
[1:05:06] take
[1:05:07] and
[1:05:08] if this is a word mathematize
[1:05:11] everything
[1:05:13] add subtract or a thousand years is one
[1:05:16] day one days a thousand years and it's
[1:05:18] been so many years and how many days and
[1:05:21] how many minutes and how many seconds
[1:05:23] and and they try to they try to say that
[1:05:26] this is going to be the day or this is
[1:05:28] going to be the month or this is going
[1:05:30] to be the year and i've known people in
[1:05:32] this message to try to do that
[1:05:34] people in this message to try to say oh
[1:05:36] god's coming back in in in august of
[1:05:39] 2022 he'll be here you can count on it
[1:05:43] i've done the math
[1:05:46] what math
[1:05:48] if it's not simple enough that a
[1:05:51] six-year-old could understand it then
[1:05:53] something's wrong amen it should be in
[1:05:56] the place god doesn't make his word so
[1:05:59] complicated that you've got to learn
[1:06:01] calculus and trigonometry to be able to
[1:06:03] figure it out
[1:06:05] it doesn't work that way
[1:06:07] it's got to be in simplicity now to
[1:06:09] throw the whole thing out of caterer
[1:06:12] let's look at this for a moment
[1:06:15] the julian calendar that we know of
[1:06:17] today that we go by the julian calendar
[1:06:19] is 365 and a quarter days
[1:06:23] so that's why we have the one extra day
[1:06:25] every four years in february for what we
[1:06:28] call leap year
[1:06:30] 365 and a quarter day how did they come
[1:06:32] up with that they came up with that by
[1:06:34] the revolutions of the earth and hitting
[1:06:36] a certain star at a certain time and
[1:06:38] they figured that's how long it took for
[1:06:39] the earth to go all the way around to
[1:06:41] get to this point again
[1:06:43] 365 and a quarter but the prophetic
[1:06:45] calendar in the prophetic calendar
[1:06:49] there's only 360 days in a year
[1:06:52] 360 30 days in every month
[1:06:56] 360 days now
[1:06:58] which calendar are you going to judge
[1:07:00] your math by right who are you going to
[1:07:05] take as the supreme authority
[1:07:07] that this is the correct way to say it's
[1:07:10] got to be this day or this moment or
[1:07:12] this month of this year
[1:07:14] see because it's thrown all out of cater
[1:07:17] if you were to do that let's just say if
[1:07:20] the prophetic calendar had gone through
[1:07:23] all the way to this time the year 1971
[1:07:27] would have actually been the year 2000.
[1:07:31] now something happens every 2000 years
[1:07:33] and that is correct how far behind are
[1:07:35] we
[1:07:37] i don't know and i'm not saying that
[1:07:39] prophetically and i'm not saying that's
[1:07:41] absolute i'm just saying that if you do
[1:07:44] the math
[1:07:46] that
[1:07:46] 1971 30 days in a month 360 days in a
[1:07:51] year 1971 would be the would have been
[1:07:54] the year 2000.
[1:07:56] amen
[1:07:58] now
[1:08:02] let me just read this let me just read
[1:08:05] this to you
[1:08:06] that brother brown the 70 weeks of
[1:08:08] daniel brother man makes several
[1:08:11] statements about it
[1:08:18] before i do that
[1:08:20] let me mention something here
[1:08:23] anybody that's a student of the bible
[1:08:25] who's read their bible through
[1:08:27] who's
[1:08:28] studied the bible
[1:08:30] looked at a lot of the
[1:08:32] the dates or the the years
[1:08:36] you'll notice that there's
[1:08:39] what the world would claim variance
[1:08:42] in certain days certain years certain
[1:08:45] numbers of years
[1:08:48] like
[1:08:48] how long
[1:08:50] were the children of israel in egypt
[1:08:54] boy i always say 400 years
[1:08:56] then you had moses
[1:08:59] he was 80 years before he ever went to
[1:09:03] uh
[1:09:04] to go back to egypt to
[1:09:06] get the israelites out
[1:09:08] god sent it back
[1:09:10] there's places in the scripture where it
[1:09:12] talks about i think it's 440 years
[1:09:16] we understand
[1:09:19] that
[1:09:20] in so many times in the scripture
[1:09:24] there's
[1:09:25] approximate times that's given you say
[1:09:28] 400 years
[1:09:30] sometimes
[1:09:31] now understand i take the little the
[1:09:33] scripture completely literal
[1:09:36] i'm not a figurative person with the
[1:09:38] scripture i believe it means what it
[1:09:40] says
[1:09:41] and and
[1:09:42] and it produces what it says it would
[1:09:45] produce
[1:09:46] i'm i'm a literal interpreter of the
[1:09:48] scripture i believe it means what it
[1:09:50] says but now when you look in so many of
[1:09:53] these places
[1:09:54] and you can see
[1:09:56] where
[1:09:59] the the times the years can again look
[1:10:04] to the world as being contradictory
[1:10:07] well it says so much this time or it
[1:10:10] says so much this time where it said it
[1:10:12] was so many years or it was so many
[1:10:14] years over here well
[1:10:17] when it gets to the point
[1:10:19] that it's it says well it's 400 years it
[1:10:23] now some places in the scripture it does
[1:10:25] say the word about
[1:10:28] now how much
[1:10:30] leverage does the word about give you
[1:10:33] one year two years five years ten years
[1:10:36] i don't know but it says even many times
[1:10:39] about this long or about this many years
[1:10:43] oh we don't know
[1:10:45] but if you want to take it as i said i'm
[1:10:47] a literal interpreter of the scripture
[1:10:49] from january 1st to december 31st that
[1:10:52] is 400 years to the day 400 years i
[1:10:56] don't believe it was like that
[1:10:58] i believe it was approximately during
[1:11:01] that period of time give or take a few a
[1:11:04] few years or a few dozen years i don't
[1:11:06] know see because god doesn't dwell in
[1:11:09] those time elements right one day's a
[1:11:12] thousand years thousand years is one day
[1:11:13] what do we know
[1:11:15] so if we take it as a literal say
[1:11:18] january 1st to december 31st well
[1:11:20] december 31st they left egypt no it
[1:11:23] didn't work like that i don't believe it
[1:11:25] did right
[1:11:27] to from january 1st to december 31st and
[1:11:29] on the 31st god didn't keep them there
[1:11:31] one second over 400 years i don't
[1:11:34] believe that's the way the scripture is
[1:11:36] to be understood
[1:11:37] or to be revealed to because
[1:11:41] and so many times are like that there's
[1:11:44] those approximate periods of time
[1:11:48] that the scripture goes into
[1:11:50] is
[1:11:51] about around approximately
[1:11:54] 400 years
[1:11:55] so to try to pinpoint something down to
[1:11:58] an exact moment day second
[1:12:03] now
[1:12:04] i'm probably getting ahead of myself on
[1:12:06] the quote
[1:12:07] but
[1:12:08] brother branham says that
[1:12:10] the lord does that to keep all of us
[1:12:13] studying
[1:12:15] and looking and in prayer and in
[1:12:19] consecration of our lives
[1:12:21] because we don't know
[1:12:24] it could be before we leave this
[1:12:25] building
[1:12:27] it could be 10 years from now we don't
[1:12:29] know yeah
[1:12:30] but we keep pressing that battle we keep
[1:12:32] our hearts clean we keep our minds pure
[1:12:35] we keep our focus on him
[1:12:37] continuing to press this battle
[1:12:40] regardless if it's in five minutes or
[1:12:42] five years
[1:12:43] amen now
[1:12:45] that being said let me read this
[1:12:47] seven weeks of daniel got two brother
[1:12:50] man says we got two or three different
[1:12:51] calendars we go back to the old
[1:12:54] astronomy calendar
[1:12:56] we find out that that in the julian
[1:12:59] calendar there's 365 and a quarter days
[1:13:02] in the year
[1:13:03] they timed that by the passing of sardis
[1:13:06] and different stars and so forth to time
[1:13:08] it out
[1:13:09] we find it in the roman calendar that we
[1:13:12] live under now 365 days in a year by the
[1:13:15] calendar
[1:13:16] but in the christian or prophetic
[1:13:18] calendar we find there's only 360 days
[1:13:22] in a year now which one are you going to
[1:13:24] go by
[1:13:27] because it well that one seems like five
[1:13:28] days but five days is just one year well
[1:13:31] when you spread that over a thousand
[1:13:32] years two thousand years six thousand
[1:13:34] years
[1:13:35] that's a huge gap
[1:13:37] that's a big amount of time in days
[1:13:41] now you might wonder how this confusion
[1:13:44] came about now listen brother braham
[1:13:46] says listen this closely because he's
[1:13:49] he's putting this out for the for us to
[1:13:51] understand he says now this i can only
[1:13:54] say as myself speaking
[1:13:57] i believe that back before the
[1:13:59] andalumian destruction back in the days
[1:14:01] of job and so forth they kept the times
[1:14:04] by the stars and we understand or back
[1:14:07] before that time that the world stood
[1:14:09] upright
[1:14:11] and then the sin of man the overflow of
[1:14:14] the world and uh and the floods come it
[1:14:17] tilted amen
[1:14:19] therefore when we have the great we have
[1:14:21] these great ice glaciers and so forth
[1:14:23] and all the top and bottom of the earth
[1:14:25] is filled with ice so once we had it
[1:14:27] straight up
[1:14:29] following it one way then it became
[1:14:31] tilted 23 and a half degrees
[1:14:34] it tilted which changed of course the
[1:14:36] rotation the times before we'd see the
[1:14:38] stars and those things that would happen
[1:14:41] now that's what he said he believed
[1:14:43] happened
[1:14:44] personally
[1:14:46] i'll take his word over
[1:14:48] anybody for that matter
[1:14:50] i was going to say certain specific ones
[1:14:52] but i'll take it over anybody even if
[1:14:54] he's just saying now this is just me
[1:14:56] uh i'll still tell unless he create
[1:14:58] corrected it later which i don't ever
[1:15:00] find that he did uh i'll take that
[1:15:03] even if it's just his opinion his
[1:15:06] opinion is probably greater than
[1:15:08] most if not all scientists today
[1:15:11] ice glaciers full top and bottom of the
[1:15:13] earth now we know that and the earth
[1:15:14] does not set straight up and we know
[1:15:17] that scientific fact we know that no
[1:15:20] there's no debating that they know that
[1:15:23] does not set straight up it sets tilted
[1:15:26] that shook it from where the moon and
[1:15:28] the stars where we were looking at it
[1:15:30] misplaced it or you could not keep time
[1:15:33] by it anymore because it was lopsided
[1:15:36] tilted therefore it would not hit them
[1:15:39] stars at the same time because it's out
[1:15:42] of cater to them stars you understand he
[1:15:44] said i believe that's what it is now
[1:15:47] how does a person
[1:15:50] feel like they can mathematize the
[1:15:53] scripture
[1:15:54] to say it's got to be this specific time
[1:15:57] or day or year
[1:16:00] jesus said no man knows the day or the
[1:16:02] hour right
[1:16:04] so how would we even
[1:16:06] i don't even understand why a christian
[1:16:08] who sees that scripture would waste
[1:16:10] their time to try to figure out what day
[1:16:13] it's going to be right
[1:16:15] and i'm sorry to be so blunt but to me
[1:16:17] that's just a waste of time
[1:16:20] your time could be so much better used
[1:16:22] than trying to figure out the day moment
[1:16:24] year month that jesus is coming back
[1:16:28] amen
[1:16:29] and the truth of it is it doesn't really
[1:16:32] matter when he comes back because he may
[1:16:34] come back for you today
[1:16:37] amen and if he comes for you today
[1:16:39] that's all that matters to you amen
[1:16:42] amen all that matters to you
[1:16:45] is the time he's coming to take me amen
[1:16:48] to me that's what matters yeah i care
[1:16:50] about all of you yeah my family i care
[1:16:52] about all of you but what matters to me
[1:16:54] and my salvation is when is he coming to
[1:16:57] me take me home because i may go before
[1:16:59] the tribute before the uh the rapture i
[1:17:02] don't know
[1:17:03] so that so when you get down to it
[1:17:06] you mathematize all these things
[1:17:09] what does it really mean
[1:17:11] see
[1:17:12] and
[1:17:13] it is to confound
[1:17:16] the the
[1:17:18] brilliant minds
[1:17:20] the the brilliant minds of today still
[1:17:22] have yet to figure a lot of these things
[1:17:24] out obviously
[1:17:26] they have figured and found a way to
[1:17:28] figure out a lot of things we've had a
[1:17:30] lot of smart men on the earth
[1:17:32] they figured out a lot of things
[1:17:34] unfortunately most of them didn't
[1:17:37] understand the scriptural the spiritual
[1:17:38] application of it but they understood
[1:17:41] the principle of it and the fit and the
[1:17:43] spiritual application or the the uh the
[1:17:45] scientific application of it but they're
[1:17:48] smart men but still
[1:17:51] so confounded there's there's just
[1:17:54] no
[1:17:55] one way to say that's exactly right
[1:17:58] that's in god's hands
[1:18:00] amen again remember listen i'm going to
[1:18:02] read it
[1:18:04] why brother battle said it's that way
[1:18:07] he said i it's it's laying back in that
[1:18:10] condition
[1:18:11] only shows that this is a period of time
[1:18:14] can't you see
[1:18:16] god don't have things out of cater god
[1:18:19] doesn't
[1:18:20] he's just letting it run like that for a
[1:18:23] time and i truly believe that this was
[1:18:26] done and at this last days is when god
[1:18:29] is going to reveal these secrets to the
[1:18:31] church
[1:18:32] he hasn't done it before and the reason
[1:18:34] he hasn't done it is to keep the church
[1:18:37] watching and praying all the time amen
[1:18:40] because you don't know yes amen
[1:18:44] it
[1:18:45] it's always something that keeps our
[1:18:47] vision focused on one thing
[1:18:50] and and pressing towards that thing amen
[1:18:53] that mark we talked about last week
[1:18:56] that mark he said it's to keep them
[1:18:58] watching and praying all the time
[1:19:01] not knowing when it was going to be but
[1:19:03] remember daniel 12 he said the wise
[1:19:05] shall understand in the last days it has
[1:19:08] been given the spirit of wisdom comes
[1:19:10] into the church to make known to the
[1:19:11] church by the revelation of the holy
[1:19:13] ghost bringing the church the revealing
[1:19:15] of that day that we are living in just
[1:19:18] as gabriel came to daniel the holy
[1:19:20] spirit comes to the church in these last
[1:19:22] days to reveal these great deep secret
[1:19:25] things
[1:19:26] amen understand
[1:19:29] and it's to understand what
[1:19:31] he's coming to take us home when is his
[1:19:34] choice it's his decision but we are
[1:19:38] continuing to are to continue to watch
[1:19:40] and pray yes
[1:19:41] amen
[1:19:42] keep our focus don't lose that
[1:19:44] enthusiasm for the coming of the lord
[1:19:46] amen
[1:19:47] therefore
[1:19:48] then stars wouldn't pass in line of the
[1:19:51] earth at the same time as they used to
[1:19:55] therefore the roman calendar is wrong
[1:19:57] too because you cannot put together
[1:19:59] the days
[1:20:01] so
[1:20:03] how do you figure it out it's not to be
[1:20:05] figured out that's kind of
[1:20:07] probably the baseline point that he was
[1:20:09] making i'm making to understand it's not
[1:20:12] to be figured out
[1:20:13] it's just to believe
[1:20:16] there's just been so many things that i
[1:20:18] could say right here that we find out
[1:20:19] even nature itself that talks about it
[1:20:22] so
[1:20:23] in that
[1:20:24] we see that
[1:20:27] the scripture
[1:20:29] yet still talks about
[1:20:31] and
[1:20:32] reiterates to the point of 30 days in a
[1:20:35] month
[1:20:36] especially in the new testament
[1:20:39] now if you look in the new testament
[1:20:40] there are several places but if you go
[1:20:42] to revelation 11 and 12 specifically yes
[1:20:46] there's more than those two but those
[1:20:48] two specific
[1:20:50] you'll see that the bible talks about
[1:20:52] the
[1:20:53] 103 score
[1:20:56] 1
[1:20:56] 200 and 3 score days
[1:20:59] that is three and a half years exactly
[1:21:02] yes that's three and a half years
[1:21:04] exactly by 30 days in a month that
[1:21:07] scripturally
[1:21:09] two thousand
[1:21:10] three of
[1:21:11] one thousand two hundred three score
[1:21:13] days is three and a half years now you
[1:21:15] can do the math that's not hard to do
[1:21:18] if you take that and divide it out by 30
[1:21:21] days in a month you get three and a half
[1:21:23] years well what's that three and a half
[1:21:25] years that's the three and a half years
[1:21:27] after the bride leads or the tribulation
[1:21:30] of that period of time before or after
[1:21:33] the rapture to the time that the
[1:21:35] millennium sets in
[1:21:37] because remember in daniel 70 weeks
[1:21:41] he was
[1:21:42] cut off in the midst
[1:21:45] in the middle
[1:21:46] so
[1:21:48] christ's original ministry was
[1:21:50] approximately three and a half years
[1:21:51] correct
[1:21:53] the second or that last half of the 70
[1:21:56] weeks is the second half that happens
[1:21:58] after the bride is gone
[1:22:01] that three and a half years that's the
[1:22:04] time that christ comes to the jews and
[1:22:06] reveals himself to the jews
[1:22:09] and they look at him and they say where
[1:22:10] did you get those scars and he says in
[1:22:12] the house of my friends and they
[1:22:14] realized who he was who he is they
[1:22:16] realized they crucified him and they put
[1:22:19] on sackcloth and ash and mourned for
[1:22:21] weeks months
[1:22:23] because of it because they crucified the
[1:22:25] very messiah but they did it because
[1:22:27] they were they were blinded yes
[1:22:30] their eyes were blinded they were
[1:22:32] looking for god in a certain way and he
[1:22:34] didn't come that way so they missed him
[1:22:36] amen there i you say their eyes were
[1:22:39] blinded god blinded their eyes
[1:22:41] uh
[1:22:43] i say that
[1:22:45] that
[1:22:46] they were blinded because they were
[1:22:47] looking in a different direction they
[1:22:49] were looking for something else
[1:22:51] you know you can completely miss
[1:22:54] something if you're looking in the wrong
[1:22:55] direction yes if some if i know
[1:22:58] somebody's coming down the street up
[1:22:59] here and i'm standing at the front door
[1:23:01] staring at the door that car will pass
[1:23:03] me i'll never see him because i'm
[1:23:05] looking the wrong way
[1:23:06] i'll miss it i was blinded to them
[1:23:09] if it's coming down if there's a car
[1:23:11] coming down the road and somebody says
[1:23:13] it's a yellow convertible and i'm
[1:23:14] looking for a green uh pickup i'll miss
[1:23:18] it
[1:23:19] the yellow convertible go right behind i
[1:23:21] won't even know anything about it
[1:23:23] so you see you can actually be looking
[1:23:25] at something a certain way and miss it
[1:23:28] completely because you're looking at it
[1:23:30] you're looking at it wrong
[1:23:32] and the jews were looking at it wrong
[1:23:34] that's why they were blinded that's why
[1:23:36] they didn't see him because they were
[1:23:38] looking at it wrong it was their their
[1:23:40] organizations denominations their their
[1:23:42] their system that caused that
[1:23:45] it's just like the denominations today
[1:23:48] i i believe most of those people in
[1:23:50] denominations are just as sincere as
[1:23:52] they can be they're just looking at it
[1:23:54] wrong yeah
[1:23:56] they haven't applied that isab that we
[1:23:58] read last week in the in the laodicean
[1:24:00] church age that jesus said
[1:24:03] by i said that you may apply the i said
[1:24:06] that you can see
[1:24:08] well they can't see because the eyes
[1:24:10] have not been applied
[1:24:12] they probably don't even know there is
[1:24:13] any such
[1:24:14] thing they just i believe jesus well the
[1:24:17] devil believes in jesus
[1:24:20] that doesn't get you to heaven believing
[1:24:22] in jesus
[1:24:24] amen
[1:24:25] but it brings us to a point of
[1:24:27] understanding that they didn't see him
[1:24:33] but they will see him
[1:24:35] in that three and a half years the two
[1:24:37] witnesses come in revelation 11.
[1:24:40] the woman the bra of the the jewish uh
[1:24:44] woman
[1:24:45] hid in the woods
[1:24:46] uh woods he had three and a half years
[1:24:50] uh
[1:24:51] one thousand two hundred three score
[1:24:52] days three and a half years that's that
[1:24:54] second half
[1:24:56] and at the end of that god reveals
[1:24:58] himself to them and they recognize who
[1:25:00] he is
[1:25:01] amen now what god does to those that
[1:25:03] have that pass away before that time
[1:25:05] that's up to him
[1:25:07] amen i
[1:25:09] i couldn't say but i know if you die
[1:25:11] believing you'll be there yes amen
[1:25:15] that's that's just how god does it
[1:25:17] that's his choice however he decides to
[1:25:19] do it now but in revelation 11 and 12 it
[1:25:23] does speak about that one thousand two
[1:25:26] hundred and three score days
[1:25:29] that god has uh that for the for the
[1:25:32] jews now
[1:25:36] in the andaluvian world
[1:25:38] and we'll get back to this in just a few
[1:25:40] minutes
[1:25:44] but in the andaluvian world
[1:25:47] you see
[1:25:48] how satan
[1:25:50] perverts everything that god does
[1:25:53] satan perverts everything god does
[1:25:57] so much so
[1:25:58] that we know numerically according to
[1:26:00] the scripture god does work in new
[1:26:02] marriage
[1:26:03] it didn't say worked in mathematics but
[1:26:05] god is mathematic so but
[1:26:09] but he does work in numerix threes fives
[1:26:11] sevens tens twelves we know he does
[1:26:13] scripturally
[1:26:15] the threes of course becomes very
[1:26:18] prominent in that three is the number of
[1:26:20] perfection
[1:26:22] the andaluvian world
[1:26:25] the bc world
[1:26:27] and the a.d world
[1:26:29] are the three
[1:26:32] manifestations of those periods
[1:26:35] that god works in now we're at the end
[1:26:37] of that last one we know that
[1:26:39] uh the first two we we've already we've
[1:26:42] already
[1:26:43] at or passed that last one
[1:26:45] are we in the year
[1:26:47] uh
[1:26:48] 2018 if if that
[1:26:51] if that prophetic calendar was correct
[1:26:54] if it has been that way in god's mind
[1:26:57] now not not only earth we know that the
[1:27:01] earth
[1:27:02] rotates at a certain rate and and we
[1:27:05] know by science that you
[1:27:07] can watch the stars and say three and a
[1:27:09] half three uh 365 and a quarter days it
[1:27:13] takes for that thing to go around we
[1:27:15] know that the way it is today but i'm
[1:27:18] not necessarily at this point with all
[1:27:20] the methods trying to figure that out
[1:27:23] i'm concerned most about god
[1:27:26] what is in his mind
[1:27:28] what is in his heart how does god see it
[1:27:31] not how does
[1:27:33] not what my calendar says not what my
[1:27:35] clock says my watch how does how does
[1:27:38] god see it because that's what matters
[1:27:40] to us
[1:27:41] how god sees it not what science says
[1:27:43] about it but how god sees it and how
[1:27:46] does god see it well we can only know
[1:27:48] about what his scripture says
[1:27:50] amen you had an andaluvian world you had
[1:27:52] the the bc you had the a.d and now we're
[1:27:55] at the end of that period of time now if
[1:27:57] that 360 days in a year
[1:28:01] was to
[1:28:02] was in god's mind the perfect way of it
[1:28:05] three sick 30 days in a month 360 days a
[1:28:09] year if that's god's mind of it and
[1:28:11] that's the perfect way that he has set
[1:28:13] then we're actually in the year 2050
[1:28:18] to god
[1:28:20] i think it's because the year 2000 is
[1:28:23] 1971.
[1:28:26] how late are we
[1:28:28] how late is this if a major occurrence
[1:28:31] happens every two thousand years where
[1:28:34] are we today
[1:28:36] friend we're we're at the end of the end
[1:28:38] of the end of this
[1:28:41] this is this is that proverbial uh
[1:28:45] cliff you would say that if i took one
[1:28:47] more step i'm going off the edge
[1:28:50] if if time pushes me much more we're
[1:28:53] going to be going off the end
[1:28:55] but thank god in this case we're not
[1:28:57] going to be going off the end we're
[1:28:58] going to be going up
[1:29:00] but we're at the end of it that's the
[1:29:02] point we're at the end of this
[1:29:04] the first 2 000 years
[1:29:06] just like god does to the man just like
[1:29:09] god does to the human the first two
[1:29:11] thousand years god takes this earth and
[1:29:13] he baptizes it
[1:29:16] amen he gets it ready he sanctifies it
[1:29:19] the earth in that condition now second
[1:29:22] two thousand years jesus comes god he
[1:29:25] sheds his blood upon this earth
[1:29:27] amen justifies this earth just like he
[1:29:31] does for us
[1:29:32] just like
[1:29:34] even even a baby that is born
[1:29:37] you look at a child that is born what
[1:29:39] happens when a child is born first thing
[1:29:41] comes water
[1:29:44] amen
[1:29:45] next thing comes blood
[1:29:47] next thing comes life
[1:29:50] well that's that's god's pattern all the
[1:29:52] way along
[1:29:54] the same things happen to our spiritual
[1:29:56] bird
[1:29:58] water blood life
[1:30:00] his spirit comes and takes control of
[1:30:03] our lives
[1:30:04] that baptism of the holy ghost as
[1:30:07] brother branham said
[1:30:09] makes way
[1:30:11] listen to me close i wish i had this
[1:30:13] quote but i don't i've read it to you
[1:30:14] here before
[1:30:16] makes way for the person of christ to
[1:30:20] come live in you
[1:30:23] he said that's what the baptism is for
[1:30:26] to make way for the person of christ to
[1:30:30] come and live in you
[1:30:32] those three steps justification
[1:30:33] sanctification holy ghost get you to the
[1:30:36] place
[1:30:37] amen that christ is pleased to come and
[1:30:40] live
[1:30:41] well that's why he's getting this earth
[1:30:43] to that place friend because this is
[1:30:45] where we're going to live
[1:30:47] that's why he had to do this earth the
[1:30:49] exact same way because this earth is
[1:30:51] where we are going to live in this new
[1:30:54] heaven and new earth
[1:30:56] is right here on this earth on this
[1:30:59] planet is where we're going to live so
[1:31:01] we had to do it the same way
[1:31:03] before he could set one more foot on
[1:31:06] here it had to be completely purified
[1:31:10] amen
[1:31:11] that's why now you get certain songs for
[1:31:14] people
[1:31:15] and these songs talk about jesus coming
[1:31:17] and setting foot on this earth no no no
[1:31:19] no no that doesn't happen
[1:31:21] sometimes we do sing those songs i'll
[1:31:23] sing them every once in a while but
[1:31:25] that's not scriptural
[1:31:26] this next time when god comes to take
[1:31:29] his bride home he does not set foot upon
[1:31:31] this earth the only foot that's set upon
[1:31:34] this earth that's the semblance of jesus
[1:31:36] christ is you
[1:31:38] me
[1:31:39] that's the only footsteps that's going
[1:31:41] to walk this earth now that's resemble
[1:31:44] or or is jesus christ in flesh god in
[1:31:47] flesh is going to be you yes when he
[1:31:50] comes we go to meet him in the air yes
[1:31:52] he doesn't come back on this earth again
[1:31:54] cannot come back on this earth again
[1:31:56] redemptive process has already been done
[1:32:00] the next things for him to do is in a
[1:32:01] pure this place gets into a purified
[1:32:04] condition and
[1:32:05] we come and we walk out with him in the
[1:32:07] millennium on the way on the ashes of
[1:32:09] the wicked right only way he could do it
[1:32:11] has to be purified
[1:32:13] so the third one
[1:32:16] water blood
[1:32:18] fire
[1:32:19] spirit
[1:32:21] amen you say fire yeah well what do you
[1:32:23] think the holy spirit was it came into
[1:32:25] your life
[1:32:26] it's the holy ghost in fire and it's
[1:32:29] keeping me alive
[1:32:31] amen you know that song
[1:32:34] keeping me alive keeping me alive it's
[1:32:37] the holy ghost and fire and it's keeping
[1:32:39] me alive
[1:32:40] jesus is keeping me alive yes it's a
[1:32:43] fire that burns all the old nature out
[1:32:46] that eradicates and completely destroys
[1:32:49] any semblance of sin in your soul
[1:32:53] on this earth
[1:32:55] a baby is born amen oh it's the life of
[1:33:00] god
[1:33:01] that comes brother abraham tells us
[1:33:03] there's an angel
[1:33:05] when a woman is pregnant he talks about
[1:33:07] getting sweet there's an angel that is
[1:33:09] sitting there just waiting for that life
[1:33:12] to issue forth
[1:33:14] and that angel is just right there
[1:33:16] waiting to match with that little child
[1:33:18] yes so old babies go to heaven
[1:33:21] amen any baby that dies before the age
[1:33:23] of accountability they go to heaven
[1:33:26] are they predestinated we don't know
[1:33:28] that but we know they all go to heaven
[1:33:30] because they're still innocent that that
[1:33:32] life is just waiting right there
[1:33:35] water blood fire now god's going to
[1:33:37] destroy this earth with fire and never
[1:33:39] we know the prophetic vision brother
[1:33:41] brother green reminded us over and over
[1:33:43] and over and over and over again burnt
[1:33:45] border the border coast to coast this
[1:33:47] country anyway right the world will be
[1:33:50] that way it has to be purified yes even
[1:33:53] brother madam said in this new heaven
[1:33:54] and new earth even the atmospheres
[1:33:58] the air around us the molecules and
[1:34:02] atoms everything in the sky and the the
[1:34:06] the the atmospheres all around us will
[1:34:08] explode
[1:34:11] because it has to be purified
[1:34:13] there cannot be a speck of sin
[1:34:17] when he comes and sets his foot back
[1:34:19] here again
[1:34:20] not aspect of sin
[1:34:22] praise the lord
[1:34:24] that's the place i'm looking to saints
[1:34:26] yeah not aspect of sin there can't be
[1:34:28] that's why god had to take that
[1:34:30] andalubian world and then baptize it and
[1:34:32] this bc world and and
[1:34:34] drop his blood on an end in this last
[1:34:36] that we're in it'll be destroyed by fire
[1:34:39] obviously after the bride's gone right
[1:34:41] we will be gone from here when it
[1:34:43] strikes this earth and then you have
[1:34:45] that period of time and the tribulation
[1:34:47] sets in at the end of it the nuclear
[1:34:49] destruction all that destroys this earth
[1:34:51] burns it up and we come in the
[1:34:53] millennium and walk out on the ashes of
[1:34:55] the wicked
[1:34:56] revelation 19 praise the lord
[1:34:59] jesus christ a white horse all all those
[1:35:02] white horses with him behind him coming
[1:35:04] amen down upon for this last time now
[1:35:07] that's before the white throne judgment
[1:35:09] remember
[1:35:11] that is still that millennium is still a
[1:35:14] period of time
[1:35:17] amen still have not you say well enter
[1:35:20] into the eternities yes our bodies have
[1:35:23] but as this world continues to unfold
[1:35:26] that itself the seventh day
[1:35:29] amen the seventh day
[1:35:32] it's been two thousand
[1:35:34] two thousand two thousand six
[1:35:37] now that's sick because one day is a
[1:35:39] thousand years a thousand years is one
[1:35:41] day one two three four five six days
[1:35:44] what's that seventh day
[1:35:48] that's the thousand years of rest
[1:35:51] when god himself in genesis took that
[1:35:54] seventh day to rest
[1:35:56] is the seventh day of rest it's also a
[1:35:59] thousand years one full day
[1:36:02] since the fall in the garden of eden not
[1:36:06] one human has lived one full day on this
[1:36:08] earth to god
[1:36:11] not not a human has lived 1 000 years
[1:36:14] because of the curse of sin
[1:36:16] no man has lived on this earth no human
[1:36:19] has lived on this earth a thousand years
[1:36:22] methuselah was the closest 969 but
[1:36:25] nobody has until
[1:36:29] that curse is broken of the original sin
[1:36:32] and when the original sin
[1:36:34] of that curse is broken
[1:36:36] and christ and his bride come back upon
[1:36:40] this earth to walk out of the ashes of
[1:36:42] the wicked in the millennium period
[1:36:44] it'll be 1 000 years right
[1:36:48] amen
[1:36:49] breaking of that original sin
[1:36:52] because man will then live upon this
[1:36:55] earth
[1:36:56] one thousand years
[1:36:58] praise the lord
[1:36:59] breaking that that sin
[1:37:02] that
[1:37:03] other beginning but now
[1:37:05] as leviticus teaches us i've got to
[1:37:08] close here there's an eighth day
[1:37:11] that we enter into you say eighth day
[1:37:14] how does an eighth day come i think it's
[1:37:16] the video leviticus 26. uh we we may get
[1:37:19] into that a little i'm not sure
[1:37:21] sometimes some of those laws and things
[1:37:23] out of leviticus
[1:37:25] kind of get a little dry so we might hit
[1:37:27] some highlights of it but uh i want you
[1:37:30] awake when we get done it's like it kind
[1:37:32] of you can study it on your own but it
[1:37:34] talks about an eighth day
[1:37:36] and what is an eighth day because that
[1:37:38] throws out the complete pneumatics of
[1:37:40] the bible
[1:37:41] right but that eighth day is just a holy
[1:37:44] convocation of the rolling over of the
[1:37:46] beginning of a new beginning yes amen
[1:37:50] it's a rolling over a beginning of the
[1:37:52] first day again which starts after the
[1:37:55] millennium after the gaga magog after
[1:37:59] the white throne judgment
[1:38:01] when the holy city the new jerusalem
[1:38:03] comes which is going to be our ultimate
[1:38:04] goal that we're going to get to when
[1:38:06] we're
[1:38:07] finishing this series up that new city
[1:38:10] the new jerusalem that we're going
[1:38:12] through that beautiful city that's been
[1:38:13] set up that come down as a bride adored
[1:38:16] for her husband let's just read it
[1:38:18] before we go can we do that
[1:38:20] let's go to revelation 21
[1:38:27] revelation chapter 21 probably all read
[1:38:30] it i want to read it together here again
[1:38:36] now you notice as you're turning there
[1:38:38] satan as i said earlier has perverted
[1:38:42] all the things the works of god satan's
[1:38:44] perverted all the works of god
[1:38:47] you notice in in the seals
[1:38:50] when we talked about him breaking
[1:38:52] uh the
[1:38:54] the breaking of the seals the revealing
[1:38:56] of the seals was to expose satan
[1:39:00] satan and his tactics to the church ages
[1:39:03] there's a white horse rider there's a
[1:39:05] red horse rider there's a black one and
[1:39:07] a pale horse rider now that three is
[1:39:10] what encompasses those church ages that
[1:39:12] last one is just death
[1:39:14] right the fourth one is death the fourth
[1:39:17] one only rides for the complete
[1:39:19] destruction
[1:39:21] amen the first three
[1:39:23] listen
[1:39:24] now i'm sorry tom's getting away from me
[1:39:28] but those three
[1:39:29] now
[1:39:30] are the ones
[1:39:32] that we described in the new birth
[1:39:36] justification sanctification holy ghost
[1:39:38] the baptism of the holy ghost making way
[1:39:42] for christ to come live in you
[1:39:45] amen
[1:39:46] those three horse riders white red black
[1:39:49] are simply
[1:39:51] conditioning this world
[1:39:53] to get it to the place
[1:39:55] that the pale horse rider comes
[1:39:58] and murders kills death hell
[1:40:01] death and hell follow him right we know
[1:40:03] that scripture tells us for death it's
[1:40:05] not a third writing per se
[1:40:08] because each one took a couple of
[1:40:10] thousand years but it's that last the
[1:40:12] first three just made way for death to
[1:40:14] come in
[1:40:16] that death is eternal separation from
[1:40:18] god and in this case that death is
[1:40:20] physical death
[1:40:22] a killing
[1:40:24] murdering destruction the bible says
[1:40:26] they'll kill you thinking they're doing
[1:40:28] god or service
[1:40:30] amen
[1:40:31] now
[1:40:32] not you
[1:40:33] will be gone in the rapture
[1:40:36] but they'll be killing thinking they're
[1:40:38] doing god thinking thinking they're
[1:40:39] doing god a service
[1:40:41] mind
[1:40:42] but you see how satan steals it his goes
[1:40:45] forth in threes just like god does
[1:40:48] you go look
[1:40:50] in in the greatest deception
[1:40:54] i'm going to say it this way the
[1:40:55] greatest deception that satan has ever
[1:40:59] conjured up
[1:41:00] to get
[1:41:02] good
[1:41:03] moral
[1:41:05] god-loving people to believe that there
[1:41:07] are three gods
[1:41:09] the trinity right right
[1:41:12] the greatest deception satan has ever
[1:41:14] conjured up that there are three gods
[1:41:16] instead of one
[1:41:19] three
[1:41:20] what has he gotten po in the pope in
[1:41:23] rome
[1:41:25] the three crowns the the the crown has
[1:41:28] the the three crown
[1:41:30] thing of the pope and it's just it's
[1:41:32] just all satan does and a perversion of
[1:41:34] what god does
[1:41:36] he's done the exact same thing his
[1:41:38] threes have been a perversion of what
[1:41:40] god
[1:41:42] has already showed his
[1:41:44] satan's powers the same way power of the
[1:41:47] trinity that horse the the the crown the
[1:41:51] viker crown it's just all the perversion
[1:41:54] amen trying to convince people there's
[1:41:56] three gods
[1:41:58] amen
[1:42:00] remember
[1:42:02] evil spirits travel in the titles of
[1:42:04] father son holy ghost
[1:42:06] amen i'll never forget that lesson
[1:42:08] brother green called us about
[1:42:09] abracadabra

[1:42:16] going to close here revelation 21
[1:42:20] and i saw a new heaven and a newer and a
[1:42:23] new earth for the first heaven and the
[1:42:25] first earth were passed away now

[1:42:28] later you know the pass away it's a
[1:42:32] a word that starts with p i forget it
[1:42:34] doesn't mean annihilated it just means
[1:42:36] change from one form to another but
[1:42:38] we'll talk more about that later and in
[1:42:40] the first earth were passed away
[1:42:42] and there was no more sea

[1:42:51] the atmospheres will explode everything
[1:42:54] from under the crust of the earth
[1:42:55] everything above the crust of the earth
[1:42:57] and all the atmospheres and heavens will
[1:42:59] explode

[1:43:07] city praise the lord new jerusalem
[1:43:08] coming down from god out of heaven
[1:43:10] prepared as a bride adored for her
[1:43:12] husband

[1:43:15] heavens saying behold the tabernacle of
[1:43:17] god is with men and he will dwell with
[1:43:19] them and they shall be his people and
[1:43:21] god himself shall be with them and be

[1:43:52] me it is done i am alpha omega the
[1:43:55] beginning and the end i will give unto

[1:44:00] to he that overcometh shall inherit all
[1:44:02] things and i will be his god and he
[1:44:04] shall be my son

[1:52:53] and i don't
[1:52:54] i don't want it to be that way for craig
[1:52:56] i want the lord to bless him because he
[1:52:57] blessed us and gave us this place i know
[1:53:00] it's a good bit less than market value
[1:53:02] uh i don't want him to be
[1:53:05] uh not be blessed as a result but
[1:53:08] uh takes a little bit of pressure off
[1:53:10] when we have some extra places that he
[1:53:12] can put people if they come looking so
[1:53:15] but if the lord has another place for us
[1:53:17] that's okay too
[1:53:18] amen i i i'd like to have a more
[1:53:21] permanent place something that we know
[1:53:23] is ours and
[1:53:24] whatever so but and but who knows we may
[1:53:27] never have that maybe
[1:53:29] maybe we just don't have enough time for
[1:53:31] that well i don't know just whatever the
[1:53:33] lord's will is that's what we're doing
[1:53:35] but uh appreciate your prayers in that
[1:53:37] and we'll see what happens
[1:53:39] so the lord's got it under control
[1:53:41] anyway so if he if he does move us out
[1:53:44] of here there will be a place for us
[1:53:47] that's just
[1:53:48] that's just the way i believe it i
[1:53:49] believe he's always done it he will
[1:53:51] continue to do it
