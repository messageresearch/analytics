[19:16] little easier on my voice today. I
[19:17] preached brother Roger last. Worked

[19:21] and preached last night for brother
[19:23] Roger. Uh but uh the Lord's gives

[19:29] uh all will be well. Amen. So but just
[19:32] kind of taking trying to take it a
[19:34] little easier on my throat. Uh 30
[19:37] uh goodness I've done lost count. 36
[19:40] years of ministering and leading songs
[19:43] these many years and all it just it
[19:44] takes a toll on your voice. I remember
[19:46] brother Brandon went to the doctor one
[19:48] time and said there was nothing wrong
[19:50] with his voice. He just had calluses on
[19:52] his vocal cords. He said, "Well, that
[19:54] seems like a good thing." Amen. It's
[19:57] kind of like a battle scar. Yeah. Amen.
[20:00] So, I don't know if that's the same
[20:01] here, but sometimes when you use it and
[20:04] use it, it kind of uh it it's still
[20:07] flesh, so it gives out. Uh but we're
[20:10] just trusting the Lord for strength this
[20:12] morning. So, Brother Dennis, would you
[20:13] take these to the Lord for us?
[20:16] Lord Jesus, it's an honor to be in your
[20:20] house once again. Yes, Lord. to know
[20:22] that it's not an opportunity necessarily
[20:26] to see one another, but it's a time to
[20:30] meet with you. Yes, Lord Jesus. Knowing
[20:32] that you're in our midst, you said when
[20:34] two or three are gathered in my name,
[20:36] I'll be in the midst. Amen. Hallelujah.
[20:39] With you. I don't go by numbers. Thank
[20:42] you, Jesus. I don't go by uh church
[20:45] buildings or or attendance. I go by the
[20:49] hearts of my people.
[20:52] Hallelujah. And I believe it. It's a
[20:55] hour that the enem is fighting us harder
[20:58] than we he's ever fought. He knows that
[21:01] his time is running out. Yes. How much
[21:04] more should you quicken to us that we
[21:08] have to be led of your spirit are led by
[21:12] the spirit of God. Amen. They are the
[21:15] sons of God. Thank you Lord. Then father
[21:18] help us to walk in the spirit knowing
[21:21] that there's so many signs and so
[21:24] displaying itself. What we're literally
[21:28] seeing is the scriptures being
[21:30] fulfilled. Yes. Amen. And father we
[21:33] thank you for another Easter means
[21:36] resurrection. Thank you Lord. And we as
[21:38] believers we honor your resurrection
[21:41] every day. Hallelujah. to be thankful
[21:44] for you, the worthy one, our kinsman
[21:47] redeemer, to die for our sins, that we
[21:51] may believe in you. You come to give us
[21:54] life and to give it more abundantly,
[21:57] Father. Yes, God. And Lord, I remember
[22:00] as I read in the scriptures, Mary uh was
[22:04] talking to you about the resurrection.
[22:06] She just didn't understand. And you told
[22:09] her, "I am the resurrection and the
[22:13] life." Amen. He that was once dead
[22:16] believeth in me shall never die. And
[22:19] then he says, "Do you believe?" And
[22:22] father, we have to be in the spirit. We
[22:26] have to abide in your word at all times.
[22:30] Oh, we can be real good because we're
[22:33] we're dwelling in your spirit right now.
[22:35] But the real test is when we're at our
[22:38] jobs, when we're at our homes, when
[22:41] we're shopping, there's allseeing God
[22:44] watching you. What are you doing then?
[22:46] Are you still displaying yourself to be
[22:50] a written epistle read and known of all
[22:53] men, a walking Bible? Some people will
[22:56] never ever pick up a Bible. And the only
[23:00] Bible they'll ever see is your life
[23:03] walking before them. Yes, God. And Lord,
[23:06] there are many precious believers a part
[23:09] of our family that are sick this
[23:12] morning. The ps I read that text,
[23:16] brother Pad, they wanted to come to
[23:18] church, but they were feeling worn out
[23:21] and tired. And our sister Julie's been
[23:24] sick. Our sister sir uh Sheilio that's
[23:28] been dealing with some uh rowdy
[23:31] neighbors is keeping her up. Oh, father
[23:34] and our sister Lydia. Lord, may you
[23:38] touch her as well. Lord, we believe
[23:41] everyone will receive their portion this
[23:44] morning. You don't want us to live a
[23:47] life of defeat. Amen. Greater he is in
[23:50] us than he is in the world. Lord, God be
[23:54] with us. Who can be against us? Amen.
[23:56] When Satan comes in like a flood, you'll
[23:59] raise that standard. And father we
[24:02] believe that each and everyone would
[24:04] receive their portion overflowing.
[24:07] Father and a high priest that can be
[24:10] touched by the feelings of our
[24:13] infirmities and by your stripes we are
[24:15] healed Jesus. We are more than
[24:17] conquerors in the name of Jesus Christ.
[24:21] We may feel defeated at times but as we
[24:26] look unto Jesus the author and finisher
[24:29] of our faith. Amen. We know father we
[24:32] have the victory. Hallelujah. Granted,
[24:34] father bless our pastor as he brings
[24:38] forth your word of life. May it fall in
[24:42] good ground in our hearts that we become
[24:46] stronger Christians, better prepared for
[24:49] our sooncoming rapture. In your name we
[24:52] pray, Father, name the Lord Jesus
[24:55] Christ. Amen. Amen. Amen. Praise the
[24:58] Lord. You can be seated if you'd
[25:00] like.
[25:01] Amen. Praise the Lord. I'm assuming
[25:04] since this is on here, you've got a
[25:07] song. Praise the Lord. Micah puts his
[25:10] songs on the tablet. He didn't say
[25:12] anything. So, but I noticed it on the
[25:14] tablet. So, I'm believing that since
[25:16] it's on the tablet, he's got a song to
[25:18] sing for us. So, Lord, bless him this
[25:20] morning.
[25:31] I sing this probably the last time most
[25:33] I think we were at but it's a song that
[25:36] um Donny Reagan has sang. I I don't know
[25:38] if he wrote it because I can't find it
[25:40] anywhere. Um it's not really one to sing
[25:42] along to. It's more of a storytelling,
[25:44] but it's a relevant to Easter. So I hope
[25:46] it's a blessing. Amen. Amen. Bless you,
[25:50] Lord.
[25:53] [Music]
[26:09] The sun was hot. An angry mom gathered
[26:13] by the gravestone building.
[26:17] This man draped in velvet with curly
[26:19] black beard stepped out on his
[26:25] balcony. Nervously washing his hands to
[26:28] rhythm of the blood. Pilate never washed
[26:32] away. Amen.
[26:36] As his wrinkled brow showed the worried
[26:39] lines, I heard Pilot say,
[26:43] "Amen. I find no fault in this man
[26:46] called Jesus, healer from the shores of
[26:51] Galilee. I command you to ask me to let
[26:54] him go free. Don't make me take his
[26:57] blood to the grave with me.
[27:01] nervously washing his hands to rid him
[27:04] of the blood he could never wash
[27:10] away. As the moss grew for blood of this
[27:13] innocent man, I heard Pilot
[27:17] pray. And it was midnight in the middle
[27:21] of the
[27:24] day. Tripping soldiers fell before Jesus
[27:28] crossed the grave.
[27:32] The homo shook. The veil was meant for
[27:36] sinners. Christ was slain. And it was
[27:40] midnight in the middle of the
[27:42] [Music]
[27:44] day. Thunder rolled across the rumbling
[27:51] mountains. Lightning burned like a fire
[27:54] across the sea.
[27:58] But on the holy heels, the angels wave
[28:01] the crimson flag and triumph. They
[28:04] shouted
[28:05] death,
[28:07] death, death. Good Lord. Don't you know
[28:11] that death is swallowed up in
[28:16] victory,
[28:17] victory?
[28:20] Amen.
[28:21] Thunder across the rumbling
[28:26] mountain. Lightning were like a fire
[28:29] across the
[28:31] [Music]
[28:32] sea. But on the holy hills, the angels
[28:36] wave the crimson flag of triumph. They
[28:39] shouted
[28:40] death,
[28:42] death,
[28:44] death. Don't you know that death is
[28:47] swallowed up in
[28:51] victory? Victory.
[28:57] Amen. Praise the Lord Jesus. Hallelujah.
[29:00] Amen. Yes, it is. Thank you, Lord. Could
[29:03] you just see that, saints? Amen. The
[29:05] angels encamped around about us. Amen.
[29:08] On those heels, waving the flags of
[29:11] triumph. Yes. Amen. When it looked like
[29:13] death was the end of it, it was just the
[29:16] beginning. Praise the Lord. They thought
[29:18] that was the finality of it, but it
[29:21] wasn't the finality. It was just the
[29:23] start. Amen. what he had done was to
[29:25] rouse up something. Satan is like a it's
[29:29] like a person thinking that he's got a
[29:32] hold of something and goes and reaches
[29:33] and it turns out to be a rattlesnake.
[29:36] Amen. That rattlesnake bit him and there
[29:38] was nothing he could do about it. Yes.
[29:40] Praise the Lord. Can imagine Satan
[29:43] standing there thinking, "Oh, I've got
[29:45] him now." Amen. I've got him now. He's
[29:49] hanging there and there's no hope.
[29:50] There's no way he can get off of there.
[29:53] Oh, but praise the Lord. That was just
[29:55] exactly what he wanted to be done. Amen.
[29:59] To bring liberty, to bring victory, to
[30:01] bring salvation to us. Praise the Lord.
[30:05] Oh, praise God. Victory. Victory.
[30:08] Victory in Jesus. Amen. Amen.
[30:11] Hallelujah. Praise the
[30:13] Lord. Amen. That's one more song number
[30:17] 350 in the book. Amen. We'll have it on
[30:20] the screen here. He is alive and well.
[30:24] Praise the Lord. He's alive and well.
[30:26] Living in me to tell that he's the same
[30:28] yesterday, today, and forever. Yes, he
[30:31] will. Amen. Thank you, Lord. 350 in the
[30:33] book. Amen. On the screen
[30:36] here. Amen. I'm not sure if we've sang
[30:38] this here or not, but heard it many
[30:41] times. We want to sing it to the
[30:43] Lord. Amen. He's
[30:47] alive and
[30:49] well, living in me.
[30:52] to tell the world that he is the
[31:02] same. He's the same
[31:07] yesterday,
[31:09] today, and forever.
[31:13] Jesus is
[31:16] alive and
[31:19] well. Well, this same
[31:23] Jesus who
[31:24] died on the
[31:27] cross,
[31:29] crucified is the
[31:31] life in our
[31:34] hearts today.
[31:41] resurrected
[31:42] again. Oh, in this body without
[31:47] sin. Praise
[31:49] God. He's
[31:51] alive and well.
[31:54] [Music]
[31:57] And
[31:58] before he
[32:00] ascended his word, he
[32:05] commanded to
[32:07] us that we would have
[32:13] power and with that you'll be in
[32:17] you when the Holy Ghost comes on you.
[32:23] Yes,
[32:24] Jesus is
[32:26] alive and well.
[32:30] [Applause]
[32:32] The
[32:33] promise he
[32:35] gives to show that he
[32:39] lives in
[32:42] those who
[32:44] truly
[32:48] believe. All the works that I do well,
[32:54] they will be done by you. Praise
[32:59] God. You're alive. alive and
[33:05] well. Yes, you're
[33:07] alive and you're well living in me to
[33:14] tell the world that you are the same.
[33:23] You're the same
[33:27] yesterday,
[33:28] today, and
[33:31] forever.
[33:33] Jesus, you're
[33:35] alive and
[33:37] [Applause]
[33:39] well. Yes,
[33:41] Jesus, you're
[33:43] alive and
[33:45] [Applause]
[33:48] well. Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[33:52] He is alive and well. Praise the Lord.
[33:56] Living in me to tell to give us the
[33:59] power that we would have. Amen. Praise
[34:03] the Lord Jesus. Oh, aren't you thankful
[34:05] for that today? Amen. Praise God. Amen.
[34:09] What a wonderful Lord and Savior. Amen.
[34:12] To give us that power to overcome today.
[34:15] Now, we have that same power to overcome
[34:18] that he overcame with. Amen. Thank you,
[34:21] Lord Jesus. Amen. Let's stand to our
[34:24] feet now if we could. We'll change the
[34:25] order of the
[34:27] service.
[34:29] Amen. Let's trust and pray the Lord
[34:32] just bless the service. Amen. Now go
[34:36] over, turn in our Bibles now to
[34:39] Philippians chapter
[34:42] 3. Amen. We're going to go to
[34:44] Philippians chapter
[34:45] 3. Praise the Lord. Just see if does
[34:49] anyone might have a testimony on your
[34:51] heart today. I mean it is Easter so
[34:53] praise the Lord if you have a testimony
[34:54] or something on your heart.
[34:58] Amen. I do. Yes sir. Brother Dennis.
[35:01] Yes. Uh remember God is in the little
[35:04] things. We want to do bigger things. But
[35:06] if we can't trust him with the little
[35:08] things, how can he use us in a greater
[35:11] way? Amen. I bought a about a year ago a
[35:14] laser printer and that things a little
[35:17] bit more complicated for me and for Leah
[35:20] than what we thought. And um I had to
[35:23] buy the right type of ink and and I
[35:26] couldn't get it going. So I prayed,
[35:28] "Lord, help me. You're the only one can
[35:31] help me get this going." I did a few
[35:32] things. The thing started printing like
[35:35] it lost its mind. So there was other
[35:38] things I print. It never came out. And
[35:41] whatever I did, I knew it was the Lord.
[35:44] Amen. Praise the Lord. Yes, he is. Even
[35:48] in the little things, still God. Amen.
[35:50] Praise the Lord Jesus. Amen. Anyone
[35:53] else?
[35:55] Amen. Not Philippians chapter 3. Amen.
[35:58] We're going to begin our reading today.
[36:00] Philippians chapter
[36:01] 3:7. Praise the Lord. Before we do,
[36:03] could we just bow our heads for another
[36:05] word of prayer? Amen. Lord Jesus, so
[36:07] very thankful again, Father, to be here
[36:10] in your house, Lord, expecting great
[36:12] things once again today as you have
[36:14] always done, as you've already done, and
[36:17] trusting you, Lord, to be pleased with
[36:19] what happens in this sanctuary, in this
[36:21] place today. Lord, we know in ourselves
[36:24] we are insufficient for the task, Lord.
[36:26] We know that we are nothing but trusting
[36:28] you in all things, for everything, God,
[36:31] because you are the mighty conqueror.
[36:33] You are the one that rose from the dead.
[36:35] You are the one that conquered death,
[36:37] hell, and the grave. You are the one
[36:39] that because of your conquering has made
[36:41] us more than conquerors today, Lord,
[36:43] through him that loved us. And thank
[36:46] you, Lord Jesus, today that we have no
[36:48] worries, Father. There is no worries in
[36:51] this life because you have everything
[36:53] under control, Lord. And we are your
[36:55] hands. We are your children, Father. We
[36:57] know that regardless of what may happen,
[36:59] regardless of how this world may go, how
[37:02] the destruction and the degradation and
[37:04] the decline, Lord, of this world and its
[37:07] morals and ethics, Lord, we know that we
[37:09] stand true, God, to your word upon the
[37:12] realization and the revelation of your
[37:14] word today. God, thank you so much,
[37:17] Lord, for this word. Thank you for the
[37:19] blessings of your word. Thank you for
[37:20] the power that you give us, God. Lord,
[37:23] the authority, the word to continue to
[37:25] press forward in this battle, Lord,
[37:27] regardless of what time we have left,
[37:30] what you'd have us to do, where you
[37:31] would lead us, what you would show us,
[37:33] God, we're desiring more than anything,
[37:35] more than everything, God, Lord, to be
[37:37] your children, to be your disciples, to
[37:39] be led by your spirit, Lord, for you to
[37:42] use us, God. We thank you so much for
[37:45] this beautiful Easter Sunday, Lord, and
[37:48] honoring of your resurrection. We honor
[37:50] your resurrection as we meet every
[37:51] Sunday. But Lord, just a special time,
[37:54] God, knowing that that Good Friday,
[37:57] Lord, you gave up your life. You laid
[37:59] down your life, Lord. Nobody could take
[38:01] it. You laid it down, Lord, on Saturday,
[38:04] God, there in the pits of hell. Yeah. At
[38:06] that time, Father, with that showdown,
[38:09] it wasn't like the war in heaven. It
[38:11] wasn't like like the war with Lucifer
[38:13] and Michael. You just slapped him up
[38:15] against the wall. You took those keys to
[38:17] death and hell. You emptied out
[38:19] paradise. And you rose again victorious.
[38:22] Oh, what a wonderful time, Lord. We
[38:25] stand, God. Because you rose, we rose.
[38:28] Because you're victorious, we are
[38:30] victorious today. Oh, hallelujah. Thank
[38:33] you, Jesus. Thank you, Jesus. Oh, God.
[38:35] We rebuke every demonic spirit that
[38:37] would try to hurt, hinder, infiltrate
[38:39] this service in any way. That you would
[38:41] get glory and honor and praise for all
[38:43] that is said and done. We love you. We
[38:45] thank you. We just commit this service,
[38:47] the remaining part of it, into your
[38:49] hands. In the precious, holy, lovely
[38:51] name of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[38:53] Christ, we pray. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[38:57] Praise the Lord. Philippians chapter 3.
[38:59] Now we'll begin reading with verse 7.
[39:01] Philippians
[39:04] 3:7. But what things were gained to me,
[39:07] those I counted loss for Christ. Yay,
[39:11] doubtless I count all things but loss
[39:14] for the excellency of the knowledge of
[39:16] Jesus Christ my Lord, for whom I have
[39:19] suffered the loss of all things, and do
[39:22] count them but dung, that I may win
[39:25] Christ, and be found in him, not having
[39:28] my own righteousness which is of the
[39:30] law, but that which is through the faith
[39:32] of Christ, the righteousness which is of
[39:35] God by faith, that I may know
[39:38] him and the power of his resurrection.
[39:42] Amen. And the fellowship of his
[39:45] sufferings, being made conformable unto
[39:48] his death, if by any means I might
[39:51] attain unto the resurrection of the
[39:53] dead. Praise the Lord. Yes. Not as
[39:57] though I had already attained either
[39:59] were already perfect, but I follow after
[40:02] if that I may apprehend, that for which
[40:05] also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus.
[40:09] Brethren, I count not myself to have
[40:12] apprehended, but this one thing I do,
[40:14] forgetting those things which are
[40:16] behind, and reaching forth unto those
[40:18] things which are before, I press toward
[40:21] the mark for the prize of the high
[40:23] calling of God in Christ Jesus. Amen.
[40:26] You can be seated if you'd like.
[40:30] Amen.
[40:32] What powerful words. There's a reason
[40:34] the Lord chose the disciples that he
[40:37] chose. There's a reason that he chose
[40:39] the prophets he chose. There's a reason
[40:40] that he chose those men of authority and
[40:43] women of uh that he had chose. There's a
[40:46] reason that he chose them. Amen. Yes.
[40:49] And just being led of the Holy Spirit to
[40:52] bring this word to us to help us to
[40:54] understand in those words the context of
[40:57] what he's trying to bring to us and
[40:59] minister and show to us through the
[41:01] scripture. Amen. But I want to focus of
[41:04] course on the the one portion of the
[41:07] scripture that uh that's found in verse
[41:10] 10 that I may know him and the power of
[41:15] his resurrection. I want to speak on the
[41:17] power of the resurrection today. The
[41:20] power of the resurrection. There's power
[41:23] in that resurrection. Amen. And
[41:26] understanding that that power is a
[41:29] transferable power. Amen. in so much
[41:32] that uh uh he had ownership to recognize
[41:38] Jesus had ownership of that power. Now
[41:40] we we we understand that that power
[41:43] represents an authority. Amen. We know
[41:46] that we don't have any power of our own.
[41:49] Yes. But we have an authority that's
[41:51] been given to us by Jesus Christ and by
[41:54] the word. We have authority to be able
[41:56] to speak to be able to speak according
[41:59] to the context of the word in Jesus
[42:02] Christ. We had that authority. We had
[42:05] that authority that power of that
[42:07] resurrection to be able to stand as
[42:09] Christians and know that that
[42:11] resurrection has come in our lives.
[42:14] Amen. And because he raised, we've
[42:16] raised.
[42:18] Amen. That power is something that the
[42:20] Lord give us. Now that that power that
[42:24] authority that is given to us, we
[42:27] recognize, excuse me, given to us by
[42:30] that that has the authority by the one
[42:32] that has the power. Amen. Someone who
[42:35] does not have that power cannot give you
[42:38] that power. Right? They cannot give you
[42:40] that authority if they don't have it.
[42:42] Amen. Amen. Praise. You can go uh you
[42:45] can go to the library down the street
[42:47] and say, "Uh, librarian, I would like to
[42:50] have the power to give a ticket to
[42:53] someone speeding down
[42:55] Oracle." You might go to a uh to a
[42:58] Cracker Barrel and buy a fake badge. You
[43:01] might go to the Office Depot and buy a
[43:03] little pad of paper. And you might have
[43:06] a pencil to come out. And you might even
[43:08] try to stop somebody on the road and
[43:09] give them a ticket for speeding. But
[43:11] there's no power behind your author and
[43:14] no authority behind your uh
[43:16] deliberation, right? Behind what you're
[43:18] doing. There's no authority. Don't
[43:21] matter whether the librarian said, "Oh,
[43:22] sure. I give you every power that I have
[43:25] to be able to go and enforce that." You
[43:28] you still have no power. Why? Because
[43:30] the librarian did not have the power to
[43:33] start with. Right? If they don't have
[43:35] the power, they can't give that power to
[43:37] you. Yes. Amen. Amen. It's like a It's
[43:41] like a stranger coming into your house.
[43:43] Yes. And and when you've got company and
[43:47] that stranger comes into your house and
[43:48] says, "Hey, you know, uh I I I want to
[43:52] give you this radio
[43:55] here." You can't give them my radio.
[43:58] It's not your radio, right? It's my
[44:01] radio, right? You don't have the
[44:04] authority to give a stranger my radio,
[44:07] right? It's mine.
[44:10] Amen. Amen. Now, if if I want to give
[44:13] them the radio, I can do it because it's
[44:15] mine, right? I paid for it. It belongs
[44:18] to me. Amen. You understand? See, that
[44:21] power, that authority, it belongs to him
[44:25] because God gave it to him. All power
[44:28] and authority is given unto you in
[44:29] heaven and in earth. Praise the Lord. So
[44:32] that power is is transferable.
[44:35] The power of the resurrection is
[44:37] transferable to recognize that because
[44:40] he did it, you can do it because we are
[44:43] in him. Amen. Praise the Lord. Now, if
[44:47] if uh if you go down to city hall or to
[44:50] the police department or however that
[44:52] works, I don't know. Uh Joel may know.
[44:54] He's not in here right now, but uh
[44:56] because he wants to be a policeman. How
[44:58] how they determine that. But somehow
[45:01] they have a system that the government
[45:03] of the city of Tucson or the uh county
[45:06] of Puma County or the state of Arizona
[45:08] can impart to an individual if they pass
[45:11] all the regulations and tests and
[45:13] whatever else that they can give them
[45:15] the authority. Why? To stop someone
[45:18] going down to earth. Why? Because they
[45:20] have the power to start with. Where do
[45:22] they get the power? Well, in our form of
[45:24] government, they get the power from the
[45:26] people or it's supposed to
[45:28] be. All the power that's given of
[45:31] government that is over the people of
[45:33] our country is given to them by the
[45:35] people of the country. The power is in
[45:38] our hands to give to them. They in turn
[45:41] give that power over to say we don't
[45:43] want somebody recklessly driving down
[45:45] Oracle. So if you see somebody doing
[45:47] that, you can stop them and get them a
[45:49] ticket, find them $200 or whatever it
[45:53] is. Because the people said with the
[45:56] power that we don't want somebody going
[45:59] recklessly down the road because they
[46:00] might kill somebody, they might injure
[46:02] our family or friends or someone that we
[46:04] know. They might hurt somebody. We don't
[46:06] want that to happen. So we give you the
[46:09] authority to do that. How can they do
[46:10] that? Because they have the authority to
[46:12] start with, right? Yeah. Yes, Jesus had
[46:15] the authority to start with. Amen. And
[46:17] because he had the authority, he was
[46:19] able to give that authority. Amen. He
[46:21] was able to transfer that power, that
[46:24] power and authority to be able to speak.
[46:27] Amen. We we in ourselves have nothing,
[46:31] right? But we do have the power. We do
[46:35] have the authority by Jesus Christ given
[46:38] to us by Jesus Christ to be able to
[46:42] stand in the power of that resurrection
[46:45] and realize that that power of
[46:46] resurrection belongs to us. Right? Amen.
[46:50] We can no longer worry. We we no longer
[46:52] worry about
[46:54] death. We no longer worry about hell. We
[46:57] no longer worry about the grave because
[46:59] those have been
[47:00] conquered. If he conquered and gave us
[47:03] the power of that resurrection, he gave
[47:05] us that
[47:07] authority, then Satan has no hold on us,
[47:10] right? Sin has no hold on us. Death has
[47:13] no hold on us. That's why Paul said,
[47:16] "Oh, death, where is your sting? Oh
[47:18] grave, where is your victory?" Because
[47:20] there is none anymore to those who die
[47:23] in Jesus Christ that has no hold. We
[47:26] have the authority. We have the power
[47:28] because he raised. We raised who? Praise
[47:31] the Lord. Let's go over to St.
[47:34] Luke chapter
[47:36] 10. Even as Jesus was here on
[47:41] earth, praise God. Even as he was here,
[47:44] St. Luke chapter
[47:46] 10, Jesus come had the authority given
[47:49] to him by God. Amen. To say, "Look,
[47:52] these disciples, these are yours." Amen.
[47:56] And Jesus went about handpicking his
[47:59] disciples. And he handpicked every one
[48:01] of them for different reasons. He even
[48:03] handpicked Judas's chariot. But he
[48:06] handpicked him for a reason. Amen.
[48:09] Because it was a job that Judas's
[48:10] chariot was supposed to do. And we know
[48:13] what that job was. But that job was to
[48:16] put was to put Christ on display. It was
[48:19] to put him on in court. It was to put
[48:22] him on uh uh uh judgment by Pilate. It
[48:27] was supposed to cause the people to
[48:29] scream, "Crucify him. Let his blood be
[48:33] on us and our children." It was It was
[48:36] imperative to him. It was his job to
[48:39] sell out the Lord for a purpose. Amen.
[48:43] Brother Bam said even Hitler served
[48:45] God's purpose. Right. Right. Amen. Well,
[48:48] think about that, friend. I mean, I if
[48:51] you if you don't have Christ, if you
[48:52] don't have a revelation, if you don't
[48:54] have an understanding of the workings of
[48:56] God through the scripture, how will you
[48:58] ever understand how that could be?
[49:01] Because that's one thing that hinders a
[49:04] lot of people from even believing or
[49:06] even serving God because they can't
[49:08] understand how this could happen, this
[49:10] could happen, this could happen. But
[49:11] that for some reason people of the world
[49:14] always tend to blame our Lord God for
[49:18] all the bad things and still serve other
[49:22] gods. Right?
[49:24] Well, why isn't the mass shooting over
[49:27] here Muhammad's fault?
[49:31] Why is it God's fault?
[49:33] Why isn't this why why isn't the the the
[49:36] rapes, the gamers? Why isn't that
[49:38] Buddha's fault? Why is it always God's
[49:41] fault? But everybody always blames God.
[49:44] They don't believe in him. They don't
[49:46] want to serve him, but they want to
[49:47] blame him for everything. Why would he
[49:49] let this happen?
[49:51] Oh no. Okay. Well, why would why did
[49:54] Muhammad let that
[49:56] happen? It does this must make any
[49:59] common sense. But see, the understanding
[50:01] is that this is the truth. Yes. Amen.
[50:05] Amen.
[50:07] Muslim I may get in trouble. is a false
[50:10] religion. Yes, it is. Uh all these other
[50:12] religions are false religions. We're the
[50:15] only one that the devil cares about
[50:17] because this is the only one that's
[50:18] right. Yes. This is the only one that's
[50:20] true. This is the one that gets attacked
[50:23] because this the one this is the one
[50:25] that's real. This is the one that's
[50:28] true. The others aren't. They don't get
[50:30] attacked like we do because theirs
[50:32] aren't real. The devil don't care about
[50:34] that. He doesn't care about the
[50:36] Buddhists and all. He doesn't care about
[50:38] because they they he's already got them.
[50:41] He isn't worried about that because all
[50:43] that's false and demonic anyway. So
[50:46] thinking so what every gun that Satan
[50:49] has is trained on Christians. Yes. On
[50:52] believers. Yes. And especially on bornag
[50:56] again believers. Yes. Because he knows
[50:59] that's the ones that has the truth.
[51:01] That's where the truth lies. And he
[51:04] knows he can't hurt, hinder, conquer
[51:07] anything because God's already given us
[51:09] the power to overcome. The authority by
[51:12] the resurrection has been given into our
[51:15] hands. Praise the Lord. That's why
[51:17] that's why Paul said to know him and the
[51:21] power of his
[51:23] resurrection. Praise the Lord. Now,
[51:25] let's look St. Luke chapter
[51:27] 10. Look at this for a minute. St. Luke
[51:29] chapter 10. Uh we'll start with verse
[51:32] 17.
[51:35] St. Luke
[51:38] 10:17, the disciples go about and
[51:40] they're going about doing the job the
[51:43] Lord had given them and they're praying
[51:44] for people and they're laying hands on
[51:46] people and miracles are taking place and
[51:48] devils are being cast out and people are
[51:51] being healed. So they come back 17 and
[51:53] the 70 returned again with joy saying,
[51:56] Lord, even the devils are subject unto
[51:59] us through thy name. And he said unto
[52:02] them, I beheld Satan as lightning
[52:06] falling from heaven. Fall from heaven.
[52:10] Behold, look what he said. Now Jesus
[52:13] said, behold, I give unto
[52:17] you. Praise the Lord. Now he can do
[52:20] that. Why? Because he has that power.
[52:23] Amen. Amen. He's not trying to give
[52:25] somebody a radio that doesn't belong to
[52:27] him. He isn't trying to give somebody
[52:29] something that doesn't belong to him.
[52:30] It's his. And because it's his, he can
[52:33] give it. Yes. I give unto you power to
[52:39] tread on serpents and scorpions. And
[52:42] look at this now. And over all the
[52:46] power of the
[52:48] enemy. I've given you authority. I've
[52:52] given you power now over all the power
[52:56] of the enemy. Amen. Of course, the great
[52:59] trinity of Satan is death, hell, and the
[53:01] grave. That's his great trinity. Outside
[53:04] of course, Father, Son, the Holy Ghost,
[53:06] and those things, death, hell, and the
[53:08] grave is his trinity. Amen. And Jesus
[53:12] telling them, these disciples here,
[53:15] understand, see, when I look at the
[53:17] scripture, I don't just account people
[53:19] say, "Well, well, that's just in the
[53:21] Bible. Well, that was just those few
[53:23] people." I don't count it that way. I
[53:25] don't, brother didn't count it that way,
[53:27] right? I kind of look at it and say when
[53:29] he's speaking to them, he's speaking to
[53:31] me. Yes. When he is telling them in the
[53:34] scripture that this power is given,
[53:36] what's it been given to? It's been given
[53:38] to God's people. When he gives it to
[53:41] God's people, I'm a part of God's
[53:43] people. It's been given to me.
[53:46] That power wasn't just given to those
[53:48] few people. That power was given to me.
[53:51] The power to what? tread on scorpions
[53:54] and and and uh deadly things and over
[53:58] all the power of the enemy, right?
[54:01] Whatever Satan, whatever the power of
[54:03] Satan may have, it's like uh well, Micah
[54:06] sang that song. It it it's like the
[54:08] devil, as I said, as I said earlier,
[54:11] sitting there believing, thinking, can
[54:13] you imagine? I finally got him. Amen.
[54:17] The son of God, he's hanging there on a
[54:19] cross. He's he's he's beat
[54:23] senseless. He's dragging that hunk of
[54:26] wood up a cobblestone with his back laid
[54:29] open and blood going everywhere. Can you
[54:32] imagine how weak a person gets when the
[54:35] blood just pours out of their body like
[54:37] that? Amen.
[54:39] 30-year-old, 33 year old man. The blood
[54:41] just pouring out of his body and he's
[54:44] trying to drag that big heavy cross up
[54:46] that cobblestone street going up that
[54:48] hill knowing knowing what the end result
[54:51] of that was. Amen. But he did it anyway
[54:56] because when he was on the cross, I was
[54:59] on his mind. Amen. Every last she said,
[55:02] "Oh,
[55:03] that's for art.
[55:06] Oh, that's for Dennis. Oh, that one's
[55:10] for uh uh Danny. Amen. Amen. Praise the
[55:16] Lord. Because he had us on his mind.
[55:19] Yes. He had the power to be able to take
[55:22] that and transfer it. Because we didn't
[55:25] have to go through that. He's the mighty
[55:27] conqueror, saints. But he made us more
[55:29] than conquerors because we didn't have
[55:31] to go through that. Yes. He did it for
[55:33] us. Amen.
[55:35] And he gave us the power over the the
[55:39] authority over all of the power of
[55:41] Satan. Amen. All of the all the power
[55:46] that Satan may have to be able to try
[55:48] and come and the only power he's got is
[55:50] deception. Right? That that's all the
[55:52] power he's got. Deception. He can
[55:55] deceive you into thinking you're not a
[55:57] Christian or deceive you into sickness
[55:59] or deceive you into doubt or deceive you
[56:02] into trying to lead you astray or he he
[56:05] he's got all kinds of of trickeries.
[56:08] Amen. To try to keep us from where we're
[56:11] supposed to be in leading by this Holy
[56:13] Spirit. He he Amen. That that but that's
[56:17] all he's got. That's that's he he's he's
[56:20] got a a gun and no bullets. He's got a
[56:22] bow and no arrows, right? He's got a
[56:24] bark and no bite. He's got a bite with
[56:27] no teeth. He's He's a a helpless,
[56:30] hopeless, hless individual because all
[56:33] the power that he has, we have authority
[56:36] over it. Greater is he that is in you.
[56:38] Amen. Than he that is in this world.
[56:41] Hallelujah. Praise God. The power. No
[56:43] wonder Paul said, "I'd like to know him
[56:45] and in the power of his resurrection."
[56:49] Why? Because that that that that belongs
[56:51] to me. That's of my authority. That's of
[56:55] my reality. Praise the Lord. I give to
[56:58] you. Amen. Are you willing to accept it
[57:01] today? Amen. Amen. Are you willing to
[57:03] accept it today? Because this power was
[57:06] given to you. Amen. There was 70 of them
[57:09] standing there, friend. Amen. Where did
[57:11] they all go at the
[57:13] end? He starts preaching to them. The
[57:16] world was great when he was given them
[57:18] power. It was wonderful when the gifts
[57:20] were being manifested. It was great when
[57:23] they were be able to go and lay hands
[57:25] and devils were cast out. But what
[57:27] happened when Jesus broke down the word
[57:29] to them and he said, "Unless you eat my
[57:31] flesh and drink my blood, you have no
[57:33] life in you." Where do they go then?
[57:36] Oh my
[57:37] goodness. This this man's crazy. Who
[57:41] could hear this kind of thing? Who could
[57:44] put up with this? They they didn't hang
[57:46] around. Oh, it was great when all the
[57:48] gifts were going and everything, but
[57:50] when the word came forth, Amen. And when
[57:52] the revelation of the word began to
[57:54] expound to the people,
[57:57] Amen. They had nothing to represent,
[58:00] nothing to understand. What is he
[58:02] talking about? He's a vampire. He's a
[58:04] cannibal. He's What kind of a person is
[58:07] this? Drink his fle blood and eat his
[58:11] flesh. Well, this just doesn't make any
[58:14] sense at all. It's great when he said
[58:15] this said, "I give to you power over all
[58:18] the enemy." Amen. But look now, even in
[58:23] all that, he said, "I give you power
[58:26] over all the uh uh all the power of the
[58:28] enemy, and nothing shall by any means
[58:32] hurt you." Right? Do you believe that?
[58:35] Amen. Nothing by any means shall hurt
[58:39] you.
[58:40] Praise God. Amen. Then what are we
[58:43] worried about?
[58:44] Why do we fret so? Why does it stress us
[58:48] out so much? The things of life when you
[58:51] know in the scripture this is not just
[58:54] for them. This is for us.
[58:57] When you know that in the scripture he's
[58:59] already given us power over all the
[59:02] power of the enemy so that nothing that
[59:04] he does should hurt you. Right?
[59:08] Death has nothing on you. Yes. Sin. Sin
[59:11] has Remember in Ephesians 2, we once
[59:14] were dead in sin. Our sins made us dead,
[59:20] but now we're dead to sin. Sin has no
[59:23] more hold on you.
[59:25] Amen. Sin has no say in your life. Amen.
[59:29] Nothing can hurt you. Nothing can. Then
[59:31] what do we fret over? What are we
[59:33] worried about? Amen. Nothing by any
[59:37] means shall hurt you. Notwithstanding in
[59:39] this rejoice not that the spirits are
[59:42] subject unto you, but rather rejoice
[59:45] because your names are written in
[59:47] heaven. Amen. Amen. And brother Brandham
[59:50] said, and we know, of course, there was
[59:52] at least one we know standing there
[59:53] whose name was not written in heaven.
[59:55] Right. Amen. But yet he was there. He
[59:58] was a part of the celebration. He was a
[1:00:00] part of the church. He looked apart. He
[1:00:02] played a part. He sounded a part. Amen.
[1:00:05] Everything about it filled out just
[1:00:07] right with him. But when it come right
[1:00:09] down to it, justified,
[1:00:11] sanctified. But when it come down to it,
[1:00:13] he could not go on to the upper room,
[1:00:15] receive the Holy Ghost. He sold his Lord
[1:00:17] out for 30 pieces of silver, went and
[1:00:18] hung himself. Right.
[1:00:21] My So there we know what's the most
[1:00:24] important thing. It ain't worried about
[1:00:26] that. It's that your names are written
[1:00:28] in heaven. Praise the Lord Jesus. If I'm
[1:00:31] in him and he's in me and uh uh if we're
[1:00:35] one together, then what have we have to
[1:00:36] worry about? Amen. He's given us that
[1:00:39] power of authority to overcome
[1:00:42] all all of the enemy. All of the tricks
[1:00:46] of the enemy, he's given us authority
[1:00:47] and power over.
[1:00:50] Remember, Good Friday did not have the
[1:00:53] final say. Easter Sunday did. Amen.
[1:00:57] Amen.
[1:00:59] The grave did not have the final word.
[1:01:02] Death did not have the final word. Hell
[1:01:06] did not have the final word. Darkness
[1:01:09] does not have the final word. Pilate
[1:01:11] even there sentencing Jesus as Micah is
[1:01:14] saying didn't want to tried to wash the
[1:01:16] blood off his hands. He couldn't do it.
[1:01:20] He had not did not have the final word.
[1:01:22] In fact, Jesus said Pilate told him, "I
[1:01:25] have the power to kill you." Oh, no you
[1:01:28] don't. You wouldn't have one ounce of
[1:01:30] power if my father hadn't given it to
[1:01:32] you. Right. There's You couldn't touch
[1:01:34] me if it weren't given to you already.
[1:01:38] Praise the Lord. It don't matter what
[1:01:40] the devil tries to tell you. It doesn't
[1:01:41] matter what the devil tries to say to
[1:01:43] you, do to you. Amen. He can't do
[1:01:46] anything without God's authority. That's
[1:01:48] right. Amen. And you have authority over
[1:01:51] that enemy. Yes.
[1:01:53] Every every enemy, every power. Praise
[1:01:58] the Lord. Pilate has no power. Had no
[1:02:01] power over Jesus. Death Helen had had
[1:02:04] not the final word. Amen. Hell didn't
[1:02:08] have the final word. Heaven does. Yes.
[1:02:11] Praise the Lord. The grave didn't have
[1:02:13] the final word. Death didn't have the
[1:02:16] final word. Resurrection did. Amen. The
[1:02:19] grave didn't have the final word. Life
[1:02:22] has the final word. Yes. Darkness today
[1:02:25] it does. It looks dark out there,
[1:02:26] friend. Yes. But darkness does not have
[1:02:28] the final word. The light does. Yes.
[1:02:32] Praise the Lord. When the light comes
[1:02:33] up, the darkness has to scatter. Right.
[1:02:36] It has no choice. The darkness cannot
[1:02:39] stay when light comes. Yes. Praise the
[1:02:42] Lord. Let's go over to Romans now.
[1:02:44] Chapter 8. Romans 8.
[1:02:53] Amen. Power of the resurrection. Amen.
[1:02:57] Authority of the
[1:03:00] resurrection. Standing on his word.
[1:03:02] Romans chapter
[1:03:05] 8. Amen. Let's read a few verses of
[1:03:08] scripture
[1:03:09] here. Let's start with the seventh
[1:03:12] verse. Romans 8:7.
[1:03:16] Because the carnal mind is enmity
[1:03:19] against God. For it is not subject to
[1:03:22] the law of God, neither indeed can
[1:03:25] be. So then they that are in the flesh
[1:03:28] cannot please God. Right. In the flesh.
[1:03:31] Because where did the authority come?
[1:03:33] Amen. The authority doesn't come in the
[1:03:35] flesh. The power doesn't come in the
[1:03:37] flesh. Yes. Amen. The powers the power
[1:03:40] authority is not here. The power and
[1:03:43] authority is in the is in the spirit
[1:03:45] realm. Amen. Not here. Praise the Lord.
[1:03:48] You move all heaven and earth by the
[1:03:50] words that you speak, but not in the
[1:03:52] natural. It's in the spiritual. Praise
[1:03:55] the Lord. So, if we're in the flesh,
[1:03:58] what can we profit, right? Nothing can
[1:04:01] be profited in the
[1:04:03] flesh. It's not subject to the law of
[1:04:06] God. Neither indeed can be. So then,
[1:04:09] they that are in the flesh cannot please
[1:04:12] God. Cannot please God.
[1:04:15] But ye are not in the flesh, but in the
[1:04:19] spirit. If so, be that the spirit of God
[1:04:22] dwell in you. Amen. Now, if any man have
[1:04:25] not the spirit of Christ, he is none of
[1:04:28] his.
[1:04:30] So, you can't claim to that. If you
[1:04:32] don't have the spirit of God, you're not
[1:04:34] a part of him.
[1:04:36] Amen. You can try and say and do all you
[1:04:39] want. Won't work for you because you're
[1:04:41] not part of him. Amen. You must be part
[1:04:44] of him for this to work. You must have
[1:04:47] the Holy Ghost. You must be a born again
[1:04:50] Christian. It is not an option. Yes. If
[1:04:53] you don't have the Holy Ghost, you are
[1:04:55] none of his. Right. Praise God.
[1:04:59] If any man have not the spirit of
[1:05:01] Christ, he's none of his. Right. Amen.
[1:05:05] And if Christ be in you, the body is
[1:05:07] dead because of sin, but the spirit is
[1:05:11] life because of righteousness. Now,
[1:05:13] think about the think about the woman
[1:05:15] that that that that Jesus caught in in
[1:05:19] the act of
[1:05:20] adultery. And think about that for a
[1:05:22] moment. Everybody around her was ready
[1:05:26] to stone her to death. Oh, what a
[1:05:28] horrible sin she has committed. And
[1:05:31] yeah, it wasn't good. Yeah, it was
[1:05:33] against the law. Yeah, it it was an
[1:05:36] unrighteous act. But everybody is so
[1:05:39] mortified because of this woman that
[1:05:41] they're ready to stone her to death,
[1:05:43] right? What did Jesus do?
[1:05:48] Amen. Think about it. Amen.
[1:05:52] They're ready to kill her. Oh, what a
[1:05:54] horrible thing this woman has done. What
[1:05:57] a horrible
[1:05:58] individual. Jesus settles down and
[1:06:00] starts writing. Imagine. Can you
[1:06:02] imagine? It never says in the scripture
[1:06:04] what he's writing down, but I've often
[1:06:07] uh uh speculated maybe he's writing
[1:06:10] their names down when I'm sure many of
[1:06:13] them he doesn't know. Maybe he's writing
[1:06:16] their name down and their sins, right?
[1:06:19] Maybe he's writing their sins down. Yes.
[1:06:22] And they're
[1:06:23] like, "U,
[1:06:26] hey, I'm out of here."
[1:06:29] Amen. Maybe he's writing their sins
[1:06:32] down. They're sitting there accusing her
[1:06:35] and they're sitting there just as
[1:06:37] hypocritical as anything. Write stoning
[1:06:40] her for hers and Jesus writing their
[1:06:43] sins down. Right? Amen. I don't doubt
[1:06:46] that that's the case, friend. You know
[1:06:48] why? Because he said, "Ye without sin
[1:06:50] can cast the first stone." Right? How
[1:06:53] can they say, "Well, I'm guilty of that.
[1:06:56] I'm guilty of that. Oh, God, I'm guilty
[1:06:58] of that." And we're so easy. Why are we
[1:07:00] so eager to make everybody so guilty?
[1:07:03] Yes. Why are we so eager to put
[1:07:05] everybody in hell? Yeah. Why are we so
[1:07:07] eager to stone people to death? Right.
[1:07:10] When we are just as guilty as any of the
[1:07:13] rest. Amen. Amen.
[1:07:16] We we we puff our chest out. We act so
[1:07:19] pious and self-righteous. We are we are
[1:07:23] the the epitome of sinless perfection.
[1:07:27] Everybody must bow down to me. Oh,
[1:07:30] really?
[1:07:32] Let's go before that great light of God
[1:07:34] and see if you say the same thing.
[1:07:36] Right. Amen. And that's what their
[1:07:38] standard pious my my my law says. Well,
[1:07:42] it says here too and what you just did
[1:07:44] and this and that and the other. Oh, I'm
[1:07:46] not sure about that. Amen. Reminds me of
[1:07:49] that time brother Green told the story
[1:07:50] of that uh when he watched and saw and
[1:07:53] that that uh uh I think it was the woman
[1:07:57] came forth and uh said that she had been
[1:08:00] unfaithful to her husband and her
[1:08:02] husband comes storming out there to to
[1:08:04] to do something to his wife come
[1:08:06] storming out. How dare you woman do
[1:08:09] this? And brother Brandham stops and
[1:08:10] points at him and says and how about you
[1:08:12] and your redheaded secretary the other
[1:08:14] day.
[1:08:16] Amen. Brother, Brother Green said he
[1:08:17] probably left skid marks. He stopped so
[1:08:19] fast. Mhm. Amen. Amen. Oh, how dare you
[1:08:24] do that, woman. Well, what about you?
[1:08:25] And that redheaded Oh my. Right. Amen.
[1:08:28] There it is. Name. Write it down. Yes.
[1:08:32] Amen. I imagine probably as soon as
[1:08:34] Jesus wrote down so and so's name and so
[1:08:37] and that sin, they probably, oh boy, I
[1:08:40] better get out of it. They probably
[1:08:41] dropped their rock and they took off.
[1:08:43] Right. Amen. One at a time. They saw it,
[1:08:46] dropped it, left. He said, "Now ye
[1:08:47] without sin, cast the first stone."
[1:08:49] Right?
[1:08:52] People are always happy to cast the
[1:08:53] stones until it points at them. Amen.
[1:08:57] What's the old saying? Cast stones and
[1:08:59] live in a glass house, right? Amen.
[1:09:02] Amen. Cast stones and want to cast
[1:09:04] stones all the time. Oh, how could they
[1:09:06] do that? How could they be that way?
[1:09:08] Well, God help. You know, if it weren't
[1:09:11] for the grace of God, you'd be a bum or
[1:09:14] a prisoner or a prostitute on the corner
[1:09:17] street right now. God help me. God help
[1:09:20] us all saints. Amen. We have we are in
[1:09:24] no position to judge somebody else.
[1:09:26] Amen. And every one of them. And as he
[1:09:29] looked up, he said, "Lady, woman, where
[1:09:34] are thy accusers?" She might not have
[1:09:36] even noticed it. She's probably sitting
[1:09:38] there bracing for the stones, right? She
[1:09:41] might not have even noticed it, right?
[1:09:43] When Jesus said, "Where are your
[1:09:44] accusers?" She
[1:09:49] probably, "I don't have
[1:09:52] any." Jesus stood up and said, "Neither
[1:09:54] do I condemn thee. Go and sin no more."
[1:09:58] Praise the Lord. Amen. Set that woman
[1:10:00] free. Amen. You think that woman lived a
[1:10:03] perfect sinless life after that? Of
[1:10:06] course, she didn't. She was a human,
[1:10:07] right? Amen. Like all the rest of us, I
[1:10:10] don't think she ever committed did that
[1:10:13] again. But she wasn't a sinless person
[1:10:15] after that. She was a human being. Yes.
[1:10:17] Amen. Just like when the Lord fills us
[1:10:19] with his spirit and we become born again
[1:10:22] Christians and we live our Christian
[1:10:23] life, that doesn't mean you're perfect,
[1:10:25] sinless. That doesn't mean you never did
[1:10:28] anything wrong the rest of from yet from
[1:10:30] that time forward. You never did one
[1:10:32] more thing or thought one more thing or
[1:10:34] anything wrong in your life. Yes, that's
[1:10:37] right. Amen. Now, where are our stones?
[1:10:40] Amen. I like to believe my stone was
[1:10:43] rolled away at Calvary at the at the
[1:10:45] suppler. Amen. That stone was rolled
[1:10:48] away and Jesus came forth. Praise the
[1:10:51] Lord. Conquering and to conquer. Thank
[1:10:54] God for that. Amen. Look at this. Now,
[1:10:57] let's pick up where we left off.
[1:11:00] And if Christ be in you, the body is
[1:11:02] dead because of
[1:11:04] sin, but the spirit is life because of
[1:11:08] righteousness. Amen. Not our
[1:11:10] righteousness. As Paul said, it's not my
[1:11:13] righteousness which is of the law. Amen.
[1:11:17] To be a good person. To be a good
[1:11:20] person, you live on your own right. It's
[1:11:22] not my righteousness. Paul said, "It's
[1:11:25] not it's it's not my righteousness, not
[1:11:27] the good deeds I've done. It's his
[1:11:30] righteousness. But it's the spirit of
[1:11:32] life because of righteousness.
[1:11:36] But if the spirit of him that raised up
[1:11:39] Jesus from the dead, that Holy Spirit,
[1:11:42] God's spirit that raised Jesus from the
[1:11:46] dead dwell in you. He that raised up
[1:11:49] Christ from the dead shall also quicken
[1:11:53] your mortal bodies. Amen. Praise God. by
[1:11:56] his spirit that dwelleth in you. He's
[1:11:59] quickening. We talked about I I told you
[1:12:02] the other day we got depth in that
[1:12:03] quickening that I was going to mess up
[1:12:05] my Christmas my Easter message. But that
[1:12:07] quickening power was to take and make
[1:12:10] alive that that was
[1:12:13] dead. What is that? To make alive that
[1:12:16] that was dead is
[1:12:19] resurrection. Praise the Lord. That's
[1:12:21] what resurrection is. That's what Easter
[1:12:24] is. is to come forth to have life after
[1:12:27] death is to bring forth life to those
[1:12:30] that are dead. Amen. Amen. That
[1:12:33] quickening power by the spirit of God,
[1:12:36] the spirit of that same spirit, the Holy
[1:12:38] Spirit, again, if that spirit's not in
[1:12:41] you, you're none of his, right? You must
[1:12:44] be born again. Amen. You must be born
[1:12:48] again. That spirit of God that is in
[1:12:51] there, that Holy Spirit is what quickens
[1:12:55] that power, the quickening of power of
[1:12:58] God quickens our mortal
[1:13:03] bodies. Our mortal
[1:13:05] bodies, you feel that quickening power
[1:13:09] when the spirit of God comes and moves
[1:13:11] in your midst. Amen. I don't care if
[1:13:13] you're in a restaurant. I don't care if
[1:13:15] you're in the grocery store. I don't
[1:13:16] care if you're at home. I don't care if
[1:13:18] you're in your car. You don't have to be
[1:13:19] in church, right? I don't care if you're
[1:13:21] in church. Yeah. But you sometimes you
[1:13:24] feel that quickening power will come on
[1:13:26] you. Yes. Amen. Sometimes you feel it's
[1:13:30] just moving and pulsating inside you.
[1:13:32] That quickening power because it's life.
[1:13:35] Amen. Amen. It's life in you. It's like
[1:13:37] brother Random talked about that dew
[1:13:39] drop when the sun comes up in the
[1:13:41] morning and that dew drop fell in the
[1:13:44] darkness of the evening and that dew
[1:13:46] drop comes. We don't have much dew here
[1:13:47] in Tucson. So it's maybe a little bit of
[1:13:49] an anomaly for us, but I've lived in the
[1:13:51] east and I've seen it when that dew drop
[1:13:54] coming and when you go outside on a
[1:13:55] blade of grass, that little drop of dew
[1:13:57] drop sitting there on that grass,
[1:13:59] brother talked about that sun comes up,
[1:14:01] that little dew drop, it'll just start
[1:14:03] quivering. It's getting ready. Amen. Cuz
[1:14:07] life's come up. The quickening power is
[1:14:09] hitting that dew drop. Amen. It's coming
[1:14:12] to life. Praise the Lord. That little
[1:14:14] dew drop starts quivering and it starts
[1:14:16] moving as that stun sun starts getting
[1:14:19] higher and higher because that dew drop
[1:14:21] is ready to go back where it came from.
[1:14:23] Amen. Praise the Lord. Look friend, this
[1:14:26] su n has risen but the s o n has risen.
[1:14:30] The power of his resurrection has caused
[1:14:34] in us that quivering, that power to
[1:14:38] shake within us. There's an
[1:14:40] identification in my soul.
[1:14:43] It's starting to come as much in my
[1:14:45] flesh too as I see the way this world is
[1:14:47] going. But I feel that quickening power
[1:14:49] in my soul, the quivering of that power
[1:14:52] in my soul because this body, this
[1:14:55] person, this this mortal who I we're
[1:14:58] getting ready to go home. Yes. Amen.
[1:15:02] It's quivering. It's shaking. It's with
[1:15:05] great anticipation of that sun, the s o
[1:15:08] n rising has risen for us to go and meet
[1:15:12] him in the air. Amen. So shall we ever
[1:15:15] be with the Lord. That is the power of
[1:15:17] the resurrection, saints. Praise the
[1:15:20] Lord. Oh, it's wonderful. Jesus, Christ
[1:15:23] raised, but what about us? What about
[1:15:25] the raising of us in that power? Praise
[1:15:28] the Lord. It done him good. That's
[1:15:30] great. But I want it to do me good, too.
[1:15:33] Amen. I want that power to be
[1:15:35] transferable. I want that power to come
[1:15:37] into my life. I want that power to be in
[1:15:39] my life so that as it raised him, just
[1:15:42] as the scripture said, as it raised him,
[1:15:45] it will also raise me. Amen. It'll also
[1:15:48] bring to light this mortal body. Oh, in
[1:15:52] the moment, in the twinkling of an eye,
[1:15:54] saints, yes, there'll be a changing of
[1:15:56] our bodies. Amen. But said it'll be like
[1:15:58] a pin prick. It's the way he described
[1:16:00] it. That'll change our mortal bodies. If
[1:16:03] we're here to the rapture, it'll change
[1:16:06] our mortal bodies. And so shall we go
[1:16:08] with the Lord to be with him, meet him
[1:16:10] in the air, and so shall we ever be with
[1:16:12] him. Amen. Praise the Lord. It's like
[1:16:14] that due drop, that quickening power
[1:16:16] that comes that raised up Jesus. It'll
[1:16:19] raise up our mortal, but it'll quicken
[1:16:21] our mortal bodies. I believe that
[1:16:23] quickening power is already taking place
[1:16:25] in our lives. Yes. Amen. just continues
[1:16:28] to pulsate through us as we walk through
[1:16:30] life, as we serve the Lord. We feel that
[1:16:34] quickening power. Again, like I said,
[1:16:36] don't matter. You can feel it when
[1:16:37] you're in the grocery store. You can
[1:16:39] feel it when you go to a restaurant. You
[1:16:41] can feel it in your car. Talk to him.
[1:16:43] Put him first. Think on him. Amen. Amen.
[1:16:46] Sing songs. Worship him. He comes on the
[1:16:48] scene, saints. That's why I enjoy
[1:16:50] feeling him in our services. So
[1:16:53] powerful, God. The the quickening power.
[1:16:55] so powerful comes into our lives. Yes,
[1:16:58] it changes everything. Praise God.
[1:17:03] Amen. Thank you, Lord. Amen. Because it
[1:17:06] quickens us. It makes us that power of
[1:17:09] the resurrection makes us
[1:17:13] alive. It quickens our mortal bodies by
[1:17:16] the spirit that dwelleth in you. Praise
[1:17:21] the Lord. That's what I said. It's just
[1:17:23] like a a a Matthew 25. Those that did
[1:17:28] not have it, they're like, "Oh, we're
[1:17:30] going to go out real quick and get it."
[1:17:31] No, it doesn't work that way.
[1:17:34] You have to have it when he comes or
[1:17:36] you're none of his. Praise the Lord.
[1:17:39] They said, "Give us yours." No, you got
[1:17:42] to go where we got it. Right. Amen. I
[1:17:45] can't give you mine. I won't have you
[1:17:46] for myself. Right. Kind of a crude
[1:17:49] analogy, but that's the way the
[1:17:50] scripture describes it, right? Amen. You
[1:17:53] got to go get for yourself. They go when
[1:17:55] they go when they try to get it and you
[1:17:58] see what happens. The Lord comes and
[1:18:00] takes his chosen home. Yes, he does.
[1:18:02] Praise the Lord. Therefore, brethren, we
[1:18:05] are debtors not to the flesh to live
[1:18:08] after the flesh. For if you live after
[1:18:11] the flesh, ye shall die. But if you
[1:18:13] through the spirit do mortify the deeds
[1:18:16] of the body, ye shall live. Praise the
[1:18:19] Lord. That quickening power, it makes
[1:18:22] alive.
[1:18:24] Amen. Amen. It makes
[1:18:26] alive. When Jesus attended a funeral, a
[1:18:30] man came to life. Yes.
[1:18:34] Can you
[1:18:35] imagine? When life comes, death can't
[1:18:37] stay where there's life.
[1:18:41] Praise the Lord.
[1:18:43] You you you can keep somebody in a deep
[1:18:45] dark dungeon, but as soon as that light
[1:18:47] comes up, life strikes. It changes
[1:18:52] everything. You can leave a seed in the
[1:18:55] ground, but as soon as that light comes
[1:18:57] up and hits it, that there's life in
[1:19:00] light. There's life in that quickening
[1:19:03] power. Amen. First Corinthians now,
[1:19:06] chapter
[1:19:07] 15. Close here in just a minute. 1
[1:19:10] Corinthians chapter 15.
[1:19:17] 1 Corinthians
[1:19:24] 15:42. Let's read
[1:19:26] here. So also is the resurrection of the
[1:19:31] dead. It is sown in corruption. It is
[1:19:35] raised in incorruption.
[1:19:37] Praise the Lord. Because again, we're
[1:19:39] still mortals. We're still humans. Amen.
[1:19:42] It is sown in corruption, but it is
[1:19:45] raised in incorruption.
[1:19:47] Resurrection. It is sown in dishonor. It
[1:19:51] is raised in
[1:19:53] glory. It is sown in weakness. It is
[1:19:56] raised in power. Amen. Good Friday
[1:19:59] didn't have the final say, right? Praise
[1:20:02] the Lord. The devil, I got him now. No,
[1:20:05] you don't. You just played right into
[1:20:08] his hands. That's exactly what was
[1:20:10] supposed to happen. If it wasn't, he had
[1:20:12] called 12 legions of babies to come and
[1:20:14] take him off that cross. That was
[1:20:16] exactly what was supposed to happen.
[1:20:19] Praise the Lord. Oh, now what's he got?
[1:20:21] He doesn't just have one on his hands.
[1:20:23] Now he's got millions that he's having
[1:20:25] to fight
[1:20:26] against. Raised in power. It is sown a
[1:20:30] natural body. It is raised a spiritual
[1:20:33] body. There is a natural body. There is
[1:20:36] a spiritual body. And so it is written,
[1:20:39] the first man, Adam, was made a living
[1:20:43] soul. The last Adam was made a
[1:20:46] quickening spirit. Amen. Praise the
[1:20:49] Lord. That quickening spirit with the
[1:20:52] power of the
[1:20:53] resurrection to trade to to to uh uh
[1:20:58] transfer that power to you to transfer
[1:21:02] that power to whomsoever he will. Yeah.
[1:21:06] So that now we can have that same
[1:21:08] authority.
[1:21:10] You can tell the devil what to do. You
[1:21:13] can tell the devil where to go. Yes. If
[1:21:15] you have that spirit in you, it's the
[1:21:17] same quickening power. Amen. It's the
[1:21:19] same life. A life he cannot fight
[1:21:22] against. He's tried many
[1:21:24] times. He even tried when he came forth
[1:21:27] to deceive him on the mount uh uh of
[1:21:30] temptation. He tried to deceive him, but
[1:21:33] he still couldn't. He couldn't do it
[1:21:35] because death can't dwell with there's
[1:21:37] life. Amen. Praise the Lord. The last
[1:21:40] Adam is a quickening spirit. A spirit to
[1:21:44] bring forth life or uh as you would say
[1:21:48] lifegiving. Amen. This last Adam was
[1:21:52] made a lifegiving
[1:21:54] spirit. And amongst of all the death,
[1:21:58] that spirit is the lifegiving spirit. It
[1:22:01] brings life to those to to that that is
[1:22:04] dead to that that is his. Praise the
[1:22:06] Lord. That belongs to him. It was a It
[1:22:09] was a uh quickening spirit today. It
[1:22:13] still quickens. Still quickens to us our
[1:22:16] lives today. Amen. One more
[1:22:20] scripture. St. John chapter
[1:22:27] 6. St. John chapter 6. read a few verses
[1:22:30] of scripture starting with the 60th
[1:22:33] verse. Get back to read the scripture of
[1:22:37] the analogy we made a little bit
[1:22:39] earlier. St. John chapter 6 verse
[1:22:42] 60.
[1:22:46] Amen. So thankful for Easter. Amen. I've
[1:22:51] told you before I've I've seen the
[1:22:52] Passion movie. I saw it uh one time with
[1:22:56] brother Juel Forny in the theater. in
[1:22:59] the
[1:23:00] Xolo. It was uh it was hard to
[1:23:03] watch. Uh and I I I bought it because I
[1:23:08] wanted to see it
[1:23:10] again. And I've actually watched it one
[1:23:14] time to the part where he's being I
[1:23:17] don't even know where it is today. You
[1:23:18] know where it is? Okay. My wife knows. I
[1:23:20] don't even know where it is. I put it in
[1:23:23] one time to watch it. I was going to
[1:23:25] watch that movie again. I watched it all
[1:23:27] the way up to the part He's getting
[1:23:29] scores. I just couldn't take it anymore.
[1:23:30] Right. I actually had to turn it off. I
[1:23:33] know he did that for me and I and I'm so
[1:23:36] thankful that he went through that for
[1:23:38] me, but I just couldn't watch it. I I
[1:23:41] started I it started getting to that
[1:23:43] point. I had to shut it off. I've never
[1:23:45] touched it again. It's wherever it is.
[1:23:48] I've never seen it again. I I maybe I'll
[1:23:52] break it out one day and try to watch it
[1:23:54] again if I can to see if I can get I
[1:23:56] just couldn't get through that part.
[1:23:58] Amen. It just it just tore me up so bad.
[1:24:01] I couldn't watch it anymore to think of
[1:24:04] what my savior went through for
[1:24:07] me. It it was just more than I could
[1:24:10] take as a mortal, as a human. And and
[1:24:12] and I I actually think of myself as a
[1:24:16] pretty resilient individual sometimes. U
[1:24:19] I've been we've been through a lot. I've
[1:24:20] had a lot go on in life. And you know,
[1:24:24] uh, I feel like when the devil comes in
[1:24:27] like a flood, God's always raised that
[1:24:29] standard. And we've just, you just keep
[1:24:32] going and crest every wave and, you
[1:24:34] know, and just keep pressing the battle.
[1:24:37] Just keep moving
[1:24:38] forward. Resilient. Amen. Don't worry
[1:24:42] about those things and what tomorrow's
[1:24:45] going to bring. Amen. It may hold
[1:24:46] something totally different than what
[1:24:48] you're thinking. Amen. And I've seen
[1:24:50] that happen in my life so many times.
[1:24:52] But when it got to that part, I just
[1:24:53] couldn't watch it. Amen. It just tore me
[1:24:56] up so bad I couldn't watch. I put it
[1:24:58] away. I haven't seen it since. So, but
[1:25:01] it it it it's
[1:25:03] reality. It's what uh it's what he went
[1:25:06] through for us. I personally believe and
[1:25:10] and I could be totally wrong, but I
[1:25:12] personally believe that if Brother
[1:25:14] Brandon was here to see that movie, I
[1:25:15] believe he would have identified that
[1:25:17] movie as the closest that he would that
[1:25:19] that has been dramatized to what
[1:25:22] actually happened, right? Simply because
[1:25:25] and and I don't I don't venture without
[1:25:29] authority here. Uh I say that because of
[1:25:31] the descriptions that I've read that
[1:25:33] brother Graham gives an account of that
[1:25:35] day. Right. Yeah. When I read and and
[1:25:39] what brother Brandham gives, that's a
[1:25:40] dramatization of the account of that day
[1:25:42] and I watch that movie, they come pretty
[1:25:45] close to the same thing. That's that's
[1:25:48] one reason I say that that that he would
[1:25:51] have said that if he was here to see
[1:25:53] that movie, right? Amen. Because because
[1:25:55] of the description, the dramatization
[1:25:57] he's given of that time of being able to
[1:26:00] actually see his rib cage. He was beat
[1:26:03] so badly. Yes. Amen. U I
[1:26:08] when I it it just but it was it was more
[1:26:11] than I could take. Amen. Again, maybe
[1:26:14] one day I'll be able to break it out and
[1:26:16] read it again. But Amen. We're in St.
[1:26:18] John chapter 6. Like I said, I'm going
[1:26:20] to close here. St. John chapter 6 verse
[1:26:24] 60. Many therefore of his
[1:26:27] disciples when they heard this said,
[1:26:30] "This is a hard saying." This is what
[1:26:32] the we had said just earlier. Amen. They
[1:26:36] like they liked all the miracles. They
[1:26:38] liked all the moving of the spirit. They
[1:26:40] liked the gifts of the spirit. They
[1:26:42] liked the operating of the gifts. They
[1:26:44] liked all those things happening. They
[1:26:46] liked watching the 5,000 get fed with
[1:26:48] loaves and fishes. They enjoyed all
[1:26:51] that. So much so they just followed
[1:26:52] Jesus around. Amen. They were just
[1:26:55] followers. They weren't they weren't
[1:26:57] disciples. They were just followers.
[1:26:59] Right. Amen. But when it got down to the
[1:27:03] truth of the word Amen. And Jesus told
[1:27:06] them, "I am the bread of life." Yes. You
[1:27:09] must partake of me or you have no life
[1:27:12] in you. He said, "Unless you eat my
[1:27:15] flesh and drink my blood, you have no
[1:27:18] life in you." Yes.
[1:27:20] Many therefore of his disciples when
[1:27:22] they heard this said, "This is a hard
[1:27:25] saying. Who can hear it?" Right? Who
[1:27:29] could hear this? Amen. I can imagine
[1:27:31] even his actual disciples are probably
[1:27:34] looking at each other thinking, "What is
[1:27:35] he talking about?" Right?
[1:27:38] What is eat his flesh? He's never told
[1:27:40] us that before.
[1:27:43] But he didn't give them any context.
[1:27:45] He didn't give them any explanation.
[1:27:47] Yes. He didn't tell them what he meant.
[1:27:51] He just said, "Unless you eat my flesh
[1:27:53] and drink my blood, you have no life in
[1:27:55] you." And left it right
[1:27:57] there. So only the believer is going to
[1:28:00] follow that. Yes. Follow that and hold
[1:28:03] to that and trust that is the word of
[1:28:06] God. Yes. As we read, listen,
[1:28:10] many therefore his disciples when they
[1:28:12] heard this saying, "This is a hard
[1:28:13] saying. Who can hear it?" I tell you,
[1:28:16] there's one group today that'll hear it
[1:28:18] and she's called the bride.
[1:28:20] Amen. She'll hear it. She'll live it.
[1:28:23] Yes. She'll become it because it is her.
[1:28:27] Yes, sir. Amen. That's right. When Jesus
[1:28:30] knew in himself that his disciples
[1:28:32] murmured at it, he said unto them, "Does
[1:28:34] this offend you?"
[1:28:36] What if you shall see the son of man
[1:28:39] ascend up where he was
[1:28:41] before? It is the spirit that quickenth.
[1:28:45] Praise the Lord. Amen. It's not the
[1:28:47] words. It's the spirit. The spirit that
[1:28:50] quickenth. It's the spirit that brings
[1:28:52] the revelation on the word. Amen. The
[1:28:56] flesh profitth nothing. The words that I
[1:28:58] speak unto you, they are spirit and they
[1:29:00] are life. But there are some of you that
[1:29:03] believe not. For Jesus knew from the
[1:29:05] beginning who they were that believed
[1:29:07] not. And who should betray him? And he
[1:29:09] said, therefore uh therefore said I unto
[1:29:13] you, that no man can come unto me except
[1:29:16] it were given unto him of my father.
[1:29:18] From that
[1:29:20] time, many of his disciples went back
[1:29:23] and walked no more with him. Oh, it was
[1:29:26] great when the 70 came and they're
[1:29:29] celebrating and they're saying, "Even
[1:29:31] the devils are subject unto us to thy
[1:29:33] name."
[1:29:35] They that was great. They were revering
[1:29:38] in all the gifts of the spirit. But when
[1:29:40] the word came, what did they do? They
[1:29:44] departed away from that because they
[1:29:46] couldn't hear it. Right? It was a hard
[1:29:48] saying for them. It was something that
[1:29:50] they could not receive. That's why Jesus
[1:29:52] said that the spirit is what quickens.
[1:29:56] Amen. If you could receive this, it is a
[1:29:58] spirit that quickenth. That's why Jesus
[1:30:01] told Peter when you're converted, then
[1:30:04] you can strengthen the brothers. Yes. In
[1:30:06] other words, I I heard something on the
[1:30:08] I said this last night, but I heard
[1:30:10] something on the radio the other day uh
[1:30:12] that this minister, pope or priest,
[1:30:15] whatever he was come up and he talked
[1:30:17] about. You know, the thing I just
[1:30:18] couldn't understand though was when
[1:30:20] Peter when Peter what Peter did, I said,
[1:30:23] "Oh, what a lack of revelation. What a
[1:30:26] misunderstanding of the scripture." God
[1:30:29] had every bit of that purposely done.
[1:30:32] Jesus had already told Peter when you're
[1:30:36] converted then you can strengthen the
[1:30:38] brothers. Yes. Right. At that time Peter
[1:30:41] was not converted. Right. Oh my. What?
[1:30:46] What? What? See it just brings what? The
[1:30:47] carnal mind comes in. That's why Jesus
[1:30:50] said it's the spirit that quickens. Yes.
[1:30:53] Amen. Not the carnal mind. Not the not
[1:30:56] the human nature. Amen. But the spirit
[1:30:59] that quickens. The spirit is what brings
[1:31:02] it to life. The spirit is what reveals
[1:31:05] it. The spirit is what helps you to
[1:31:07] grasp and and not understand but just
[1:31:10] become a part of your life. But many of
[1:31:12] them left from that time. They they
[1:31:15] couldn't hear it. They walked with him
[1:31:17] no more.
[1:31:19] Amen. You know, the same thing happened
[1:31:21] in brother Brown's ministry. That people
[1:31:23] still follow the gifts and all all they
[1:31:25] really cared about was the gifts. And a
[1:31:28] lot of people today, that's kind of what
[1:31:29] they follow. They they're more concerned
[1:31:31] with the gifts, right? I even knew of a
[1:31:34] sister back that was uh here when
[1:31:37] Brother Brandon was here. She's passed
[1:31:38] on now back in North Carolina. And she
[1:31:40] said, "Oh, if Brother Brandon was just
[1:31:42] here," I said, "What would he do now
[1:31:43] that God can't already do,
[1:31:46] right?"
[1:31:49] What? So you're I I didn't say this, but
[1:31:52] So you're saying when Brother Brandham
[1:31:54] died, God died. What's the point of him
[1:31:57] being here
[1:31:58] then? Amen. You see how that that
[1:32:02] that carnal mind looks at that
[1:32:06] and and thinks on those things. It's the
[1:32:08] word that brings life. Yes. It's the the
[1:32:12] the spirit on the word that brings it to
[1:32:14] life. Amen. Because it's the spirit that
[1:32:16] quicken it and makes it life. They
[1:32:19] walked with him no
[1:32:21] more. 67th verse. Then Jesus said unto
[1:32:24] the twel, "Will ye go all uh also go
[1:32:27] away?" Then Simon Peter start speaks
[1:32:31] spokesman of the group answered him Lord
[1:32:35] to whom shall we go? Thou has the words
[1:32:39] of eternal life and we believe that and
[1:32:42] are sure that thou art that Christ the
[1:32:44] son of the living God. Amen.
[1:32:48] He says I've chosen you and one of you
[1:32:50] is a devil. Yeah. But Peter I I don't
[1:32:54] Peter had not been converted. I don't
[1:32:57] believe Peter had any more understanding
[1:32:58] of what Jesus was saying than the ones
[1:33:00] that walked away. He just had enough
[1:33:02] spirit in him. He just had enough
[1:33:05] knowledge. Well, it was that that that
[1:33:07] seed. Yes. That germ seed of life. Yes.
[1:33:10] Amen. That representation. He had the
[1:33:13] representation. The others walked away.
[1:33:15] Had no representation. Amen. He had that
[1:33:17] representation to realize you had the
[1:33:19] words of eternal life. We believe what
[1:33:21] you tell us. We might not understand it
[1:33:24] all, but we know that you have the words
[1:33:25] of eternal life. And wherever you go,
[1:33:27] we're going with you. Yeah. Amen. Praise
[1:33:31] the Lord. I'm sure at the same time,
[1:33:33] he's probably looking over at Adam,
[1:33:34] Andrew, and what is he talking about? I
[1:33:38] don't know. I've never heard him say
[1:33:39] that before. What could he possibly be
[1:33:42] meaning? Amen. Try to figure it out.
[1:33:45] Just like they did at the last supper.
[1:33:48] Amen. Amen.
[1:33:50] murmuring amongst each other who's the
[1:33:52] greatest, who is the best, you know,
[1:33:54] who's the who's the greatest one? What
[1:33:56] who is he thinks the best one? Who is
[1:33:58] the number one amongst the group? You
[1:34:00] Amen. Just it's just humans as humans
[1:34:03] do. Praise the Lord. It didn't matter.
[1:34:06] Amen. Because we were all a part of that
[1:34:08] body. We're all a part of him in in in
[1:34:12] that light. Thank God that he that the
[1:34:15] power of that resurrection's been
[1:34:17] transferred. Amen. transferred to us. So
[1:34:21] now we have that authority. Amen. Over
[1:34:26] all the power of Satan. That includes
[1:34:29] death, hell, and the grave. Because he
[1:34:31] rose, I rose. Amen. Amen. Praise the
[1:34:35] Lord. Let's stand today.
[1:34:43] Only way I could rise is because he
[1:34:47] rose. The only way that I could stand
[1:34:51] victorious is because he is already
[1:34:54] conquered. The only way I could be more
[1:34:55] than a conqueror is because he
[1:34:57] conquered. Conquered death, hell, and
[1:34:58] the grave. Praise the Lord
[1:35:01] Jesus. I'm so thankful the Lord did that
[1:35:04] for me, for us that we would be able to
[1:35:08] have that authority
[1:35:09] today. What is there to worry about,
[1:35:11] saints? What is there to fret over? What
[1:35:15] is there to get all excited and tore up
[1:35:17] about? God has it all in his hands.
[1:35:20] Amen. The only doubt would that the only
[1:35:23] doubt that could possibly come is if
[1:35:25] someone just doesn't belong to him and
[1:35:27] doesn't have the faith to believe
[1:35:30] it. I don't want to be one of them.
[1:35:33] Believe him. I trust him. His word is
[1:35:36] true.
[1:35:37] Amen. Praise the Lord
[1:35:40] Jesus. Amen. God bless you today. Let's
[1:35:43] sing this chorus again. We sang it
[1:35:45] earlier today.
[1:35:49] Amen. Praise the Lord. God's not dead.
[1:35:52] He is alive. Let's celebrate a little
[1:35:55] bit. Amen. They were all depressed and
[1:35:58] down Good Friday. But when he rose
[1:36:00] again, they were
[1:36:01] confused. Amen. They were a little
[1:36:04] confused, but it was a happy time cuz he
[1:36:08] was back again. Praise the Lord. And
[1:36:11] today, Amen. Jesus God's not dead. Jesus
[1:36:15] is not dead. He's still alive. Amen.

[1:37:38] walking. One more time now. It's God's
[1:37:42] darkness. He is
[1:37:44] alive.

[1:37:49] alive. God's
[1:37:52] goodness. He is alive. I feel him in my
[1:37:56] hands. I feel him in my feet. I feel him
[1:38:00] in my heart. And I feel him all over
[1:38:06] me. Praise the Lord Jesus.
[1:38:10] Amen. Glory to God. Amen. Thank you,
[1:38:15] Jesus. Yes. Thank you, Lord. He is not
[1:38:18] dead. Yes. He is alive. He has arisen.
[1:38:22] And saints, if he's not dead, that means
[1:38:24] I'm not dead. Yes. If he couldn't die,
[1:38:27] that means I can't die. Amen. If he rose
[1:38:30] again, that means I'll rise again. Yes.
[1:38:32] Praise the Lord Jesus. This corruptible
[1:38:35] will put on incorruption. This mortality
[1:38:38] will put on immortality.
[1:38:41] Amen.
[1:38:42] Death, hell, and the grave has been
[1:38:44] conquered. Yes. It no longer has a hold
[1:38:48] on God's children. Yes. Thank you, Lord
[1:38:51] Jesus.
[1:38:52] Praise God. I'm so glad I serve a rising
[1:38:55] risen living savior. Yes. He's the same
