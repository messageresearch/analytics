amen we appreciate the Lord blessing us and being with us watching over keeping us healthy and strong and being able to have another beautiful Sunday service for his glory and honor we have a couple of prayer requests want to make known to you today want to continue to remember the fra house in prayer they're still quarantined as you know maybe remember the sister for Chile's sister Priscilla's sister tested positive positive for coronavirus and her subsequent family members are starting to get ill in that not going to the hospital I kind of recommended maybe they go the one of them is having a hard time breathing and I recommend it maybe going and getting on a ventilator but they said so many people died on the ventilators well reason people are dying on ventilators is because the only reason they put them on a ventilator is when there are really bad condition right so when you're in really bad condition they put you on a ventilator so the worst people in the worst cases are dying on ventilators well that's why they're dying on ventilators not because there's something wrong with ventilators but anyway we want to remember her family of course angel and the kids so remember them this will be in their second week of their quarantine and just I believe the Lord's protective gonna be with them so but pray for them and the fam we'll also got text from sister Celia earlier today to remember her continued remember her brother Harlan he's got a big day coming up in the June 26th which I guess is - about two weeks from now ish so we don't give too much detail but just again sister Celia wants you to remember her brother Harlan in prayer he's still in Texas still going through what he's going through there with this home and his wife so please remember him in prayer also to remember sister sure aya and brother art still having car troubles it's in the shop and the shops having a hard time keeping it from overheating so but I guess in this heat is kind of hard to keep anything from over here but her heart's supposed to so let's just remember them people get overheated guys a lot of times burning cars but let's just remember them and prayer the Lord would just help them guide the mechanic however to fix your car two words in a place of repair that they can have a car and do things and come out Church in also please remember them in prayer anyone else have a spoken request real quick I know we're trying to change it that's kind of one of the reasons I wanted to do the song service again today these are members would get back into the into the the routine I hate using that word especially when it comes to church but when you get the routine of coming in and writing down the prayer requests and praise report so I want to have I noticed we didn't have set out but I want to set out one that has four praise reports too so we got the prayer requests but remember also the praise reports we want to put down so we want to have those so we don't call every service we just have it written down and read it to you move forward so if you remember that is again we get into the routine of being together again remember that write the prayer requests in that down and if it's a praise report for now it's okay if you want to put it on a price on a prayer request sheet that's fine just we'll just put it on there and just read it to you so that we have that so we do have one written for brother Pat I just glanced at it brother Pat for a moment it lists sort of like more of a praise report but we'll go ahead and give a read it to you anyhow so it's in the Pats are thankful that Jesus provides it provides a hedge around their family amen brother a hundred percent with that pray for continued blessings from Jesus they are appreciated brother Pat and or sister Pat - and we also want to welcome and thank often being with us again amen he's not an inaugural member he's a part of us has been since he was about this this thereabouts so but we're also very thankful to have girlfriend Iulia with us so welcome girlfriend Julie were thankful that you were able to be with us today - no reason to bus we're just a small group of people that love the Lord but if you want to know anything about awesome of course good kids there aren't a lot to tell so I am pleased to announce as far as I know there's not a lot to tell but appreciate them and appreciate y'all Pete you're glad to have you today man so thankful for that but real quick does anybody have a spoke mind obviously several missing today so that you remember them as well the Frye was again like I said quarantine our trust cars acting up brother Dennis and Danny are usually streaming together remember brother Dennis's wife Leah she again she still works at that doctor's office and they very strongly recommend the separation and that not coming together and gathering together so it kind of hard on front of Dennis but remember her remember him amen the Lord is with us but again remember them in prayer and I haven't heard from sister Julie but just remember each one and work together as a group and we thank the Lord for His blessings to us teen you remember Tom who was here with us last week with sister Matisse so but we're thankful God didn't have an unspoken quest let's stand to our feet if we could take these knees to the Lord now amen trust his intervention bless our lives if you just announces let's see if you need to use the restroom recommend you don't if you don't have to but if you need to use the restroom there down past the elevator in the hall on the right if you go down that little hallway the restrooms are there so brother Pat would you pray for us to be better thank you Jesus for convicting each of us to come in you be here today yes we came here to worship you yes thank you for loving Jesus we appreciate the convictions of everyone to be here honest it makes our church and appreciate the fact that we aren't having a church and yes you thank you lord amen be with us here today and give us a revelation to understand what's going on yes Jesus thank you for the heaven Church today in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ a great man god bless you you can be seated again if you'd like turn over to Psalm number 228 number 228 Jesus [Music] [Applause] [Music] Oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] you know present you know his hand is with us amen I'm so thankful he's one that we can always depend upon you know I was talking to him a little bit this morning and you know what King Jimmy is as I was talking to him I vomited he's always been that close friend and I thought about making Lord willing maybe a little following for a midweek but just give you a little snippet I just started thinking about you know much as I love my wife and as much as I'm whether there's times of my life she's not with me my parents aren't with me anymore I was with them for many many years but I wasn't always with them and they're not here anymore I'm not always with my children I'm always with my grandchildren I'm always with my church family friends but you know there's one that's always there amen that's him praise the Lord thankful he is always there and it reminded me too and maybe should have mentioned as a prayer request but you know there's some fires going up in the hills you know this time last Sunday I didn't think a whole lot about it because lightning strike I think was Friday but you know I just just push rich not all the fuel up there for fires and wildfires but that thing has gotten pretty bad so just remember that Lord just protect the people and keep everyone safe and watch over them just especially the firefighters who brave the flames and the heed and you know I watch those guys those people may be women - I don't know but they put on that gear that's real heavy and thick and those tanks and the weight and the heat it's 106 and it can't be easy so just remember them in prayer if you would - and we're just thankful that there's those that are willing to do that and to be there and to fight those fires and the tankers and helicopters and so but the Lord protects us and keeps us in his hands amen you know that bolt of lightning could have hit right outside any one of our houses and started that fire and come our way and you know brother the patents are on that sparsely populated area out there with acreage and a lot of a lot of vegetation but God protects amen watches over each one of us so we're very thankful for that amen he's a wonderful living God isn't he so thankful God to give us that time so amen god bless you today and then we'll go to the Word of God and do you want to have a special song people to encourage people to encourage your friends and so forth especially with this spire and so forth that when the scientists were traveling the DNA they discovered that all the entire Hebrew alphabet is encoded in the DNA and one woman her remark to her because her husband was good friends with these scientists she heard mark was well that's easy because now they're finding messages Raisa Laurens can deny that Amen scripture says we are made in His image his reflection amen body spirit soul he's a triune being and we are too so you want to sing too I thought he'd be tired too tired to see today swam is a little hard out yesterday once you come over here next year where people can see ready right there okay [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] bears delete songs anymore praise the Lord thankful raised train them and the way they should go right it's true that's right amen all these parents today just won't let the kids do whatever and make their own decisions or 5 years old they don't know how to make decisions they don't know whether he's a boy or girl check his chromosomes that'll tell you I was just so sad I I am NOT a fan of the Harry Potter and all that garbage but or the or the author but it strains it she I've read this week I just say this and we'll go to the word but I just read this week that she is under fire now she is actually being ridiculed because she had the audacity to come out and say there is a difference upon birth of a male and a female she's under fire for saying that she is in trouble she's being ridiculed because she actually said there's a difference between a boy a girl a male and a female hope it but anyway that's our society right praise the Lord but I meant but I am thankful God's not dead he's still alive praise the Lord Jesus amen if you stand with me turn in your Bibles now to Roman's we'll go to the eighth chapter really a simple thought this after this morning saying this morning afternoon this morning kind of a simple thought actually this this again there were two messages that came on a Sunday that I kind of resonated their thought was gonna originate a midweek and the Lord changed it this in our streaming said now this is the same thing this I was gonna do this last week as a midweek and I went twice I even started to set my camera for my desk twice to do this and something happened each time it stopped me and then the other day I just felt compelled the Lord that to make this for today so I'm just trust in the Lord has a reason for that right he been so Romans 8 we'll start with verse 26 Romans chapter 8 start with verse 26 but let's bow our head to get forward of prayer pretty good precious Jesus father again would come to you thanking you for all the grace and mercy you give us your love and help and health and strength and life and Lord your loving blessings to us Lord is nothing we deserve this nothing we earned it's it's nothing Lord that we can attain to of our own abilities but we're thankful God that you and your unmerited favor give it to us Lord not because we loved you but because you loved us and your love is unconditional God there is nothing that it is based upon other than the fact that you chose to and we thank you today God we want to return to you after we've come to the recognition and acknowledgement Lord of that love that you have toward us now and this service today return to that just a little portion to you God in our hearts and let you know Lord how much we love you today I believe that love that we have for you God is unconditional and compelled us to be in the house of God in this service again today God we're thankful father that you're with us you never leave us or forsake us your grace and mercy Lord is more bountiful than we could ever even begin to use but God we know that you're there with us and we want be careful to give you the praise and thanks to the glory for Lord you are the only one there that is there for us continually we're leading on you Lord and we're trusting in you believing father you again to speak through these lips anoint the hearers and Lord may you just anointing may your Holy Spirit fall upon the rest of this service as we commit it to you now in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen Romans 8:26 only 26 to 28 inclusive likewise the spirit also helpeth our infirmities for we know not what we should pray for as we ought but the spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered and he that searches the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit because he maketh intercession for the Saints according to the will of God and we know that all things work together for good to them that are that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose you can be seen it if you'd like and a lot of times we take and I just want to title this today if you will closer to him closer to him as you could probably see the title of that would be a nice midweek but again I feel like the Lord stretched it up to bring it today thus as a result we ended up not now having a midweek again which my apologies for but I don't know it's me or what I just couldn't find a mind of the Lord or something to bring to you for a midweek so I apologize I can always go in the scripture and read something in that but I don't I don't ever want to do that I can but I prefer is the leading of the Lord I prefer the Lord give me something that's going to be food for your soul is going to be something that's encouragement something that's fresh that God is giving an anointing and I'm bringing to you each one of us likewise so but I want you now just to keep that in mind closer to him now that's where this came from because of everything that's going on sure all that's being pressed upon people today but I want to draw onto this of course I'm gonna major really on the 28th first but I want to draw the comparison or the completion of this script your beginning in the 26th verse that really goes from the first verse but just for sake of time if you'd like to go back and read the entire chapter of chapter 8 of Romans but back in the 26th verse and look and see what what is being taught to us what what Paul is trying to explain to us Orie she's doing the Romans the Roman Church to us today so that we can garner from this what the Holy Spirit is teaching us for today likewise look now likewise the spirit now that's the Holy Spirit of course also help with our infirmities and that's our inabilities our shortcomings in that the Holy Spirit is there to help those shortcomings for for each of our lives each of our lives we live daily we can all probably confess to the fact that for lack of better verbage there's gaps in our lives not that we fall asleep or not that we get knocked unconscious or not that but there's just gaps there's just places where you know the Spirit comes to make intercession to fill that gap to fill that void to fill that empty place if you will and I'm sure we all can understand and attain the fact that we've had those empty places we've had those void spots on our lives but the Bible says that the Spirit help with our infirmities which is Vail at filling in those shortcomings those places where we fall short God fills in for us amen is like coming up coming down a road and coming to a bridge well if there's no bridge there you can't go any further you have to go down in the river or whatever but that but and there's those gaps and the Holy Spirit's the same way life is that way we know that turns and there's heels and there's curves and there's smooth places and there's left places and there's harder places but it's just like that road when you go on across the road of life there's a lot of times there's those gaps those missing spots now a lot of people when they find those missing spots are those infirmities and they get into those empty places many times people go to the liquor cabinet or they'll go to the drug cabinet or though the medicine cabinet to get drugs or or they'll try to fill it with riotous living or gambling or something like that everybody tries to and has to fill in that gap see and and in filling in that gap we all have the ability to to take that gap and fill it with the Lord because with Jesus because that's what the purpose of that gap is for God wants everybody to to surrender their lives to him to make him number one of their lives and to be born again and God puts that in every inherent in every human so when that road when that road of light comes to that gap the Holy Spirit those who have the Holy Spirit makes a bridge or helps it says that in Furman see that shortcoming God bridges that God God puts a bridge up there so when you keep going you don't have to reach to the medicine you don't have to reach the the the drug excuse me or the alcohol or something like that some people release it by gambling and doing other things you don't have to fill that gap because God is there the Holy Spirit is there to fill that gap so when that gap comes to that little empty place in your life and I want to make this a focal point of this service is it God fills that gap in so that you can just keep riding the waves cresting over every road every mob every bump every Hill every dip God is that Holy Spirit is there to feel that he helps those infirmities he's there to be there in those shortcomings those those times were we fall short and the times even a question the times that were just not sure the times feel like maybe we're searching for something well you know that God put that inherent in you to search for him God wants you to search for him that's why it's there so that the Holy Spirit is is there to level that place out it helps that it helps fill that gap it helped bridge that infirmity amen so we all have them every human has them it's just which way are we gonna reach to are we gonna reach to God amen cuz during this day and hour and this is where I got the thought during this day and hour especially now the riots and the looting and the protip Amin Fred you said all it's the end time they've been doing that for hundreds of years that's nothing new I mean it's pretty I hate to see it it's a bad situation but that's been going on for years that's not something that's unusual and new that that type of things been going on for years tens of years decades hundreds of years even people get in the streets protest I mean the French Revolution was all about people protesting to take over the country and take over the government so it's always been there so you don't don't look at that but the thought that came to me was we're all in the middle of this and there's so many things going on in in so many lives and and there's people out there that don't have jobs yet there's people out there that are trying to make ends meet there's people out there that we're living paycheck to paycheck and all of a sudden in one 24-hour period BAM there was it ended it stopped they had no more checks they had no more income they had no more way to pay bills rent feed their children and all this just stopped so the pressure is felt you know a few weeks ago I preached on pressure the pressure is felt the pressure is felt by everybody but the pressure is there to not only just pressurize us as I talked about on that sermon that that pressure is there to it's going to do one of two things the pressure is either to draw you closer to you or it's going to pull you further away from him and that's the point of it the point of it is it's separating it's bringing the body line between those that really believe and are born again and filled with the Holy Spirit of those who aren't and that dividing line is becoming broader and broader because the gap the Holy Spirit is filling in the gaps that the helping those infirmities of those that have that but if you don't those are the places were people and sometimes may have thought they had the Holy Ghost and really didn't people who thought they were a Christian and really weren't people who thought they were going to a good church or listening to the Word of God er that they all thought that they were in this great position but then when the pressure came in the and the hardships come down then where do they go because they're going to go one of two places they're gonna go away from God further from God or they're going to get closer to God and God wants us to take these times and become closer to him amen closer to him maybe wonder why did God even in some places shut us up in homes for days and weeks on in instead of having so much other things going on in life in so many other places to go and so much else to do God's shutting us up in our homes what are we used in that time for to come closer to young guess what God wants us to do that's the whole point God makes it therefore is if we draw closer to him every bit of what is happening to bring us to that point now some more voluntarily get closer to the Lord it's more of a desire it's more of an unction is more of a pull in some people it's just like children you know when you raise children all most of us in here have and some of us may yet still do that but most of us have when you raise children you know I've heard the saying I've said it others have said some come easy and some come hard some children learn easy and some children learn hard some children you say okay don't do this because you're gonna fall and hurt yourself some children are like oh okay well Danny says I better I better not do that because I don't I don't wanna I don't want to break my arm so I'm not gonna do it and they don't do it and some kids no matter what you say they're gonna do it they're gonna wait to you're not there you're not looking or they distracted you somehow and they're gonna do whatever that is you told her not to do now they're most the time they're gonna fall and do exactly what you said and what's gonna happen to that child is gonna be exactly what you told him what happened and you would think that would be enough but it isn't always enough the next time you say okay now don't do this I told you over here what what happened just exactly what you told me daddy wasn't I'm telling you the same things gonna happen you're gonna get in that one child that one that comes hard they're gonna do it every time but but it but some come and they they come easy like okay you know Maya I will confess to you even be from the south I was not spanked very often in my life and my sister got so mad at me she called me a spoiled rotten brat and everything else and I probably was what was the youngest youngest usually as poor Brad but anyway I Owen denied that necessarily but but I asked my dad I actually asked my dad one time because she kept saying going on about I asked to ask my dad one time I said why did you not and he said whoa son I didn't have to he said you might have done something once he said sometimes I would tell you and you just wouldn't do it and sometimes you would do it and I would tell you not to do it again you wouldn't do it again so there was no need to spank you to teach you a lesson or to show you that you're not you you're too old baby had not dude the things I tell you not to do and you learn you were an easy learner so I didn't have to spank you as much so as well that was his testimony I don't know I sure didn't feel that way I thought it was pretty bad kid but this was what he told me and some come easy some come hard you know and this is anything with the children of God some are easy some are hard some some are gonna come the hard way some look at it and they draw closer to the Lord and some look at it and you know God's got to give him a little more of a nudge he's got to give him a little more of a just an unction and some people he's just got a flat-out shove then he does and it's a little harder when he shoves it's a lot harder than if you just come on your own but even when he shoves you the end result is the whole point the one that comes on his own becomes closer to God the one that has to get nudged becomes closer to God the one that is shoved into a whiplash becomes closer so the whole point is regardless of whether it's easy come or hard aids the end results the same see and that's the whole point that God wants us to become closer to him and everything we do and everything of what God's saying it won't be wants us to be closer to him a lot of people take things and they think well this is this is too hard this is too rough this is this is a I don't understand why God would do that you know and and then people leave because they just don't how could a God do this why he just wants to bring you closer to him and he figured out a way or he didn't figured out he knew but there is a way that to bring you to that place if you're gonna come to that place and so the pressure comes to say well are we gonna come this way we're gonna come closer to God or are we just gonna forget God and go away so that that gap is there for a purpose that's my reason for saying all that I get that gap is there for a purpose that infirmity is there for a purpose we all have them different ways and shortcomings we all have this Showboat shortcomings the Holy Spirit is there to help us with those shortcomings just like other people again they just drink their self into oblivion see they they try to overcome that gap by not remembering it or being so out of their minds that they don't feel anything right they numb their senses so much that that there's no feeling about what's going on and they hope that by the time they come out of that and they take their head out of the toilet that they're gonna be better off rarely ever happens from I know of what I know of it's probably worse but but that's the whole point of trying to numb themselves to get past that let's see when you have the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost helps you through that the Holy Ghost helps level that place the Holy Ghost helps bridge that gap so he takes care of it for us now let's that's the first part of the verse list for we know for we know not excuse me for we know not what we should pray for as we ought but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered so that spirit is making those intercession on our behalf as we pray as we speak to the Lord as our relationship with the Lord is enhanced we don't know necessarily or understand necessarily yes we have things that are written down yes we have things in our minds and friends and family people we know that need prayer and things saying we let those people up those are more supplications really the prayer supplication is when you supplicate before the Lord and you talk to them about the infirmities and the needs and the people and things like that but when we just speak to the Lord we just pray to the Lord we don't know necessarily how to pray but the Holy Spirit does amen now look because that spirit is making the intercession on our behalf because that because that blood is still there amen remember we talked about that that the mercy seat there will be something that will try to convince you that it's not there anymore I differ with that I believe it is still there because it is still making intercession because the inner of even the bride is necessary for today brother Branham said if that blood was not there your prayer could not get through to God that's pretty simple to me that making intercession with groanings which cannot be uttered or understood if you will or understood sometimes you know we talk about the speaking in tongues of men and angels and that kind of thing but it's just an intercession that the Lord does on our behalf the Lord speaks through you the Lord helps us to understand those things that are the purpose that God has in our lives and he that searches the hearts that's God of course knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit the mind of the Spirit now it's transcending my desires my wants it's going beyond what I want to happen and it's reaching to a level of as a Christian living my life for him not for me my life is lived for the Lord Jesus has for many many years now there's a lot of flaws and a lot of gaps and a lot of infirmities in there shortcomings but I've tried my best to live my life for him it's not my life it's his life now thankfully and I appreciate the Lord allowing me to be able to spend time and health and strength to go to work and earn income and make a living and provide for my family and things like that the Lord allows those things in our life that we can do that but we do that on his behalf we do that for him we do it as unto the Lord even though it may not be going to the hospital and praying for the sick or attending someone or having Church or something or ministering or it doesn't have to be that it's just being unto the Lord and for anything and everything you do and that's what the minds of the Spirit it is it's getting us into the place of God's perfect will so it's not my will anymore it's not my life it's his life it's his life so let me finish this up in the mind of the Spirit because he maketh intercession for the Saints according to the will of God now notice that he doesn't make intercession according to what your wants are he doesn't make intercession based on what now I do know the Bible says if we delight ourselves in the Lord he'll give us the desires of my heart that's the scripture I believe that that's the truth but Lautrec we're not here to appease ourselves the Spirit doesn't make intercession for us on to mention our desires or to match our wants or to just drop a million dollars in your lap or a Bentley in the parking lot or a house in the foothills that's not the point and God bless you with that then well praise the Lord I mean if God allows you to have money then there's nothing wrong with that you know I just started harder for a rich man to get through into the kingdom of heaven than a camel through that veneto but anyway there's this fine doesn't say it couldn't do it just more complicated so if God did that to you and give it to you for a reason for a purpose and it's not for your glorification it's not for your self edification it's not for you to be exalted it's not for you to be looked upon as something wonderful or greater some statue or something it's for God the intercession listen the intercession that the spirit makes on our behalf is according to his will not my will now if that intercession has to fight against something that I'm trying to accomplish or do selfishly rules if I'm doing it because it's something that that is a selfish desire self-esteem or maybe even contrary to the will of God that intercession is making that change it's going to manipulate that to work it becomes into God's perfect will and God's perfect will in our lives you've heard me say it and I still believe and I'll say it again in my opinion God permissive will is failure I don't ever want to be in God's permissive will I always want to be in His perfect wheel thank God further permissive wheel because I found myself there more often than I'd like to be and I'm thankful it exists and brings us to the place that we do end up in His perfect wheel but I still don't want to ever go there I still want to stay in God's perfect well why don't we do that the intercession of the Spirit is according to the will of God so if we just follow that intercession of the of that remember II say we don't we don't know 26 mercy we don't know we know not what we should pray for we up as for we up but the Spirit making intercession for us with us for what to bring us that intercession is to bring us to God's perfect will for God's will in our life well no wonder we might not know cuz I don't always know what God's will is for me you know we wake up on Sunday morning that was a pretty easy one to figure out we take shower and get ready to come to church I'm prepare for the service and you come and attend and those things are pretty simple but what about all the other times and all the other hours and days and hours that we spend I was spending it selfishly are we spending it for self gate are we doing something for the Lord you know it struck me and you know you know I have always had a very high opinion of brother Roger Collins and and my thoughts for him towards him and our friendship together and I've always known him to be a man of God that me some may like to hear Minister some may not that's there's neither here nor there to me but but that's just true he saw a person now same thing with me it'd be the same with you I mean he's just even in your normal life some people like hanging around you and some people don't but you preach to not some people like being around some people don't that's just the way it is anyway but he said something the other day that struck me now we have conversation like because we've been working together a lot but he told a man the other day and I believe it was anyway one of the jobs I believe it was he and he told the man that because brother Roger doesn't charge a whole lot for what we did and the man said well you the next closest person was way above what you charge me and brother Roger said well sir I'm not in this to make a look to make myself rich I'm not in this to build some great organization I'm not in this to make some great company he said I'm in this just to try to earn a little bit of money that I can put towards the Lord and for the work of the Lord in the ministry well what a testimony you know to tell a total stranger and someone don't even know if he was eaten ate is don't know the man from Adam don't know him at all and to give that testimony that's powerful and that was tremendous to me a witness to me I thought you know that's exactly right that's what we do what we do whether it's a bigger sum or smaller sum where we do it because we want to do as unto the Lord it's all that we do this unto the Lord not to build a kingdom here not to build some nice plush flowery bed of ease that we fly through on to make that in our lives to be for the Lord now the hard part it's the easy part for the Christian the hard part for those that are is verse 28 now they didn't remember that intercessions made according to the will of God not according to your will according to the will of God so remember that because that's where the rub comes and we know verse 28 we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose so we know that not every other thing not 90% of things but we know because again we are of the spirit we know that all things are going to work together for our good both when that happens it's not always easy for those things to work together for our good because a lot of times we don't know what is for our good we may not know what the will of God is for us tomorrow the Lord may send you someplace to go pray for something here to go minister to somebody or so we don't know what tomorrow holds we don't know what the afternoon holds we know what we're doing right now but what the will of God is there we know that all things are going to work together now again the rub sometimes those things working in them in the way they are may come against what the little kingdom you're trying to build maybe or the or the the self-righteousness or the building of your own kingdom in your own ego and it may rub against what you want to be doing can always do what we want to do so it may rub against what we want to do but we know it's gonna work together for our good it's got to work together it'll rub against your flesh many times it'll be hard to go through sometimes it may make a tunnel so dark you can't see the light on the other end but it's gonna work together somehow because God has it in control somehow it works together for two people say well how could this happen oh why would this child die why would they have had why would God have allowed the dark ages why could this be this way God allows those things to work every bit of it together for the good of his children to be in His perfect will led by his spirit to be in the position to do what we can for him why do we do certain things we do I was gonna be a little more specific and and maybe a mine and Sonia's life I don't know you don't always understand it sometimes I've had it happen sometimes where the Lord gives just a little glimpse maybe afterwards I say this was done this way for that purpose maybe just for one person's right I had some you go to sister or Sonia Tabitha go to sister Holmquist funeral and saw Claire Peterson there and or Chloe Peterson and who I forgot the connection anyway it was it was probably through Austin I think Austin and Claire moved up to Ohio and but anyways people that came to our church in Florida they came and were part of the church like halfway you know like after we were there for a year year and a half something like that and it was a man and his wife and his two children and and they came to church and I you know we had somebody to church to invite them and they came and they became a part of our journey they like their eyes became opening baptized they saw the message and and praise the Lord you know dairy they're still in it today and but I guess somehow they the family member met up in Ohio or somewhere and the sister Denise is actually her name Dave somehow through to Chloe Peterson to Tabitha to give me the number to call her and hurts our reason II was that I was the one that led her to the Lord well honestly friends I never thought I never occurred to me that that was the way she felt about it because you know there was a brother invited in the church and they came and I just preached the word I just had the doors open and preach the word but in her mind and her feelings that that was how she came to this truth attributing of that to me I'm like well it's not me I had that - God had nothing to do with it but when these little things happen you think why did I even do that or why did I even go there or why did I even say that what was this accomplishing what was this doing Lord I really believe this was your perfect wheel book why and maybe the Lord would just show you a little glimpse of something to help you understand I'm a I I mean you ever heard that you ever heard the old saying you had to go around your fist to get to your phone you know that happens a lot in the Christian life the Lord might have to change this circumstance and move these people and change this over here and break this to happen that way in this and so that this chain events can bring it all around to this one thing that God wants to accomplish right in somebody's life he'll do this change this move this here move that there do this and cause it all just to be for that one point that one purpose that one moment it may not be but one minute of time in human life but that one time brought about the perfect will of God for that person for that whole family whatever that one thing that one place that one point all things work together for our good now who are the ones that it works together for to them that love God now do you love God oh you can go on the any Christian Church today and not guarantee every hand would go up right do you love God everybody yes and they may not say anything but even you going maybe to the Catholics the Presbyterians and Lutheran's and Pentecostals and charismatics and walking to certain these big mega churches - do you love Donnell they would just every one of them but you let the real pressure hit and that's when you find out for sure because there's a lot of people that have a passing affinity for the Lord right there's a lot of people that have an affection for the Lord maybe even a filial love like Peter talked about in John 21 may have a little figlio lover human love for the Lord and something that's just kind of a superficial surface type of love that they think that they have for God well God's been good to me - yeah I love him do you know God loved you even when you weren't good even when you didn't know it even when you denied him he still loved you that was his choice what is our choice do we love him because he did something for us do we love him because he saved us do we love Him because He healed us do we love him because he's been so good to us do we love him because he's always there for us do we leaven because he's the matchless Savior because he's our Lord and God do we love him because of any circumstance that God's ever done if you love forms based on anything then when that thing that it's based on is removed you don't have love anymore if that condition is removed the love goes with it if you really love God you love him unconditionally just like He loves us so under the worst conditions all things work together for those that love God if it's under the best or worse conditions you still love it whether he takes away the most dear thing in your life you still love it whether he's changed the most you had all this money in property land whatever and every bit of it's gone you still love it and some people look at it and say well I just I just can't do anymore I just can't stand this anymore God so I'm gonna give to you more than you what you can stand right amen amen and when it comes to our family and our children and things like that that's a whole nother episode too that's a whole other thing you notice parents you do anything for your children for as a spouse you do anything for your spouse you love them but when it comes to between that and God what's the choice now it doesn't always come down to that fortunately we're not so hard-headed that those things happen a lot but God uses those things to bring us into his into his perfect will that love is a agapo agape love that's God's love but it's a verb if you go look at it in the Greek you'll see that that word is a verb so what it's saying is that verb that which which is something that's an action right a verb is an action so this love is an action it's not just the regular agape love of God this is God's love in action this is a verb so it's something that that we see in being in action for the Lord all things work together for them that are in action for the Lord somebody and those that are doing something for God those that are living their lives for the purpose of of being pleasing to the Lord all these things work together because it's an action that we have that causes these things to work together in the obedience of the Lord in the Lord's will of course making intercession see how I think see that the 26:17 verses all manage to come together perfectly together amen bringing about the the purposeful results that God had in his mind before the foundation of the world we may not know what his ways are higher than our ways his thoughts higher than our thoughts so we may not know we don't always know the will of God we don't always know what is the the perfect will of God but sometimes we can get so eased in Zion that we forget about those things that's happening you know it's like it's like the Eagle stirring the nest you know remember have talked about the Eagles turning the nest when the Eagle builds the nest she builds a nice big nest and then she puts thorns and stickers and briars and stuff underneath it and then she comes she gets rabbits fur and birds feathers whatever and she packs out all dykes nice down and nice and neat just like she's sliding in your beautiful comfortable bed to go to sleep at night you know it's all nice and comfortable in this it feels good when the little babies are born and they come out and they they walk around on how nice that beautiful animal fur isn't and it feels so good but then when that little that little eagle gets a little bit older mama starts taking so that fur and throwing it away so that little bird who is supposed to be getting to the place of Independence and going out on their own it's getting too too comfortable in that nest it moms like nope do you get too comfortable in this nest you'll just sit here and rot coz mama ain't gonna go feed you all the time mom's not gonna come feed you all the times you don't want to see if you set in this nest you're just gonna stay here die so what she got to do she's got to take a little bit of the fur out and throw it over the side and you know the little birdie he feels good and all of a sudden he comes over that place doesn't have any fur de hits authorities oh that that hurt and she takes another little bit of that firm throws it down and you know before long that nest is so uncomfortable for that little that little birdie said I got to get out of here I can't stand this nest anymore this was beautiful whistles I loved it but now I can't stand it eating then he goes out on his own and he's flying around in the heavens and he finds his food and he eats and he goes and he flies around he and what is he doing he's accomplishing the purpose and he was built for he's accomplishing the reason that God made him and he's flying around the heavens he's doing exactly what God commanded her called or built in to do and that's what God does for us sometime God's got to just pull a little bit he wants to get us in a place of desperation that were that that our that our lies not again we just got to go back for just a moment please we'll go back for just a moment again not forgetting that God's God's not making it to work it's not providing for you which to me out of all the things that's been going on in this country in the world and the people begging in the food lines oh my I've seen pictures of the food banks of the cars lined up for miles just to get food at a food bank because they had no food how many how many your cupboards are empty anybody anything here your cupboards empty no is your gas tank empty is your bank account empty or is God taking care of you has God been there for us and all the midst of all that and everything that's been going on and lining up and nothing wrong with the people the food banks not nothing wrong with those that are in need jesus said the poor you always have with you we know that that will happen these people may not have been poor but they're in need now but thank God he's been there for us and he's protected us that he's kept us and in Florida kept their unemployment checks coming in give us a little boost with the stimulus money again and things you know God's just provided God is took care of us and I'm so thankful God is there but we don't want to take that and become comfortable either we don't want to take it become East we need to let that verb of love continue to work in our lives we're in what the work for the Lord Amen remember everybody's under that pressure everybody is it's just how you react to it what you do by it God desires for us to become closer to him you go back and read Joe I was gonna read it today but for second time it's getting away from us go back and read Joe again refresh your memory go through it slowly the first three chapters at least the first two and go through just look what Joe went through God said that Joe was perfect and upright before him and that was God's testimony about Joe now didn't matter what Joe look at who looked at when he got up in the morning in the mirror and the proverbial mirror mum had beers in but just think you get up and look at yourself it's more important that what God sees you as what you see of yourself now if you see if yourself in the word that that's the way that God sees you but God saw job is a perfect and upright man one that feared God and eschewed or turn away from evil I believe God's looking for the same type of individual today and I believe God's looking for that in us today but Joe fit that bill Joe was that man in my opinion I doubt I've never met him maybe the Lord when I get a chance to ask him if he really felt Joe when you were acumen and blood was coursing through your veins did you actually feel like you were perfect and upright before God I've been sure to guess that you probably will say no just like every one of us would probably say no but it doesn't matter because it's the way God saw now the thing that comes along in jobs loss he's perfect and upright probably does not see himself that way so we'll go that I don't know he may have I just doubt he did amen cuz I know I believe how God looks upon his children today and I'm sure there's none of us that think that way oh yes I'm perfect complete than not yeah you could lay a finger to me yeah every one of us has our shortcomings right every one of us has those gaps think I I would almost guarantee job didn't feel that way but God felt that way about it but now if you're in the position now see cuz you got to know who you are if you're in that position because remember all this God is using so that we become closer to him it's like the toothpaste tube I mentioned to you before you know if you take the lid off a toothpaste tube and you grab it you squeeze it in the middle you know some of that toothpaste is going to shoot out it is it can't be in the tomb anymore because of pressures too great they can't stand it well that's those people that say well I love God yeah I'm in the church yeah you're in the tube I go to church and I yeah I'm a faithful member of so in some denomination or this baguette church or something yeah I go to wherever it is and and I'm thankful to it yeah well praise the Lord that's great but then when that squeeze comes when that toothpaste ooze get squeezed where are you gonna be because those that don't get squeezed out just come closer together the other part of the toothpaste just goes into that tubing and squeezes then it comes out much closer together that's all God wants us just to become more like him God wants just to be closer to him and all that's going on he's doing all of this to bring us closer to him now God now Joe was already perfect and upright feared God eschewed evil so if in job's fine let's just just paint a picture for a moment and jobs mine maybe in your mind you think well you know I'm full of faults and mistakes and I have shortcomings and and and all these things and and you know you really don't have a maybe a large opinion as a Christian in your mind of yourself then when those things come assist you that God's looking a job and maybe job obviously wasn't thinking that way about himself but then this trial comes and Satan's walking around in heaven and God says what are you doing here Lisa's whopping the earth looking around going to and fro and and God God suggest to to the Satan God's suggestion to Satan Satan didn't suggest it to God God suggested it to to Satan have you considered job he's my servant he's perfect he's upright he fears me he loves me fears me he turns away from evil and Satan said I have but you got a hinge around him you've got him hedged I can't touch him praise the Lord not wonderful to know the world Christian can be where we can live our lives in a place to work it's hedged about with God's holy angels that not not a finger of Satan can touch praise the Lord but remember now it only tastes one teeny little gap for him to get it wedged himself in there and get it but God keeps us hedged and protected because there's only it for somehow there's a reason he's able to get in there's because God's allowed it God's allowed it it's for a reason and if it's fir and gods allowed it for a reason and Lord just help me to fulfill Romans 8:28 because I love you Lord and regardless of what trial or whatever come I'm still gonna love you regardless I don't love because you save me I don't love you clothes you heal me I don't love because you always been there and all those things are good I appreciate you God has those attributes about it but I love him just because he is period as long as he exists and that will be through eternity I'll still love it love will never die but let's just say for a moment Joe felt that way about himself when that trial came and Satan and God said I'll take down that hedge and he said you can do anything Zinn job but touch joke don't touch Joe you know don't don't lay a finger on Toby's a finger and Satan fingers spirit don't lay a finger on Joe so what is Satan go about doing he kills his kids and he takes all of his wealth and he kills all of his animals and they his all the servants and and he's basically just got a couple of servants here and there and his wife but Satan took everything from him and God shaved his head fell on his face and worshiped God he took that and became closer to God he was a man that was upright and perfect before God and yet through all of that he got closer to God what does that prove to me that proves to me that a person that in God's mind is perfect and upright pin still get closer to him amen as he fell on his face and he worshiped God and did it again Satan's going around what you doing here again I'm going to in front earth again it's what what happened with Joe well you know you did all this this and this but they said well you know I'm paraphrasing of course God didn't say this what did you do when you did all that to him Satan what was his reaction I don't want to say cuz he knows what happened he knows what job did job continued to worship thought even though everything was taken from him you know why because Satan just like he does you he believes that you only love and serve God because of something God did for you he absolutely believes that that's why he told God you take down that hedge then I'll make him curse you to your face now some some do but they weren't his to begin with but the others they just come closer to God they say Lord I don't understand this but I need a little nourishment right now and they snuggle up to his breasts and they they get nourishment and they love him and he loves me they are together praise the Lord so I'll tell you what I'll let you I'll let you have joke you can touch his flesh but don't you take his life now it's amazing what you can live through right he said don't take his life you can do also whatever to Joe what he's gotten him personally now but now don't don't don't take his life now a lot of people and I have before look at this scenario with Joe a job was the flesh man just like us standing sitting here today this is not a fictional character we didn't get this out of the Bugs Bunny cartoons friend job was a real man flashing blood had human children and a wife just like you know the humans do he was a man not not a fictional character was a man and even in this and I think well then Satan afflicted job with sore boils all anybody can take that I mean that's hard that would be rough but more than that look at how Satan touch Joe the way that Satan touched Joe Wade farther more than the boils I mean boys are just flesh that's just you know he's sitting there scraping on when there's a sheep and he's scraping his balls and the dead flesh is falling off and he's set in there but the attack that was worse than the boils was when Satan got on Joe's wife when Satan got on jokes white and Joe's white came up to him and looked at him with anger and contempt and said why don't you this curse God and die that was the lowest point my opinion the lowest point Joe ever had when his own flesh and blood his own bone of his bone flesh of his flesh declared to him just to curse God and die now she wasn't done that under normal circumstances that was a devil that got on her to say that that attack was way worse than the children wait worse than the servants way worse than the animals the wealth way worse than the boils was his own flesh of flesh bone upon coming and telling him that shook him to the very core of his be and yet Joe broke from rose from that and he said shall we receive good of God and not even shall receive all the things that God has blessed us with done for us and given to us and not the things that are needful for us the things that are harsh and sometimes hardened sometimes divided and break and take away I got had friendships of my life friend that I cherished and treasured that are no longer friendships and probably never will be again that's hard that's very very taxing and troubling and difficult but it's just a fact now is there is there anything wrong with my friend no anything wrong with me no it's just God's purpose why I don't know why did Paul and Barnabas attack each other we're at each other's throats to the point that they had such sharp contention that they had to separate and one go one way and one go the other fine so Paul could go to this place and preach the gospel and Barnabas could go to this place and preach the gospel and not both of them go to one place and preach the gospel he had two places they got preached the gospel nothing wrong with Barnabas nothing wrong with Paul it's God's purpose God caused it to happen so two places can get ministered to instead of one now that's my simplistic way of looking at that but it's still true it's just way God works job said though though he's yeah I will trust him he said shell would receive good and not bad at the hand of the Lord the Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away blessed be the name of the Lord I don't tell you I didn't know it as well as I do today but that became our battling crime when the Lord took our son that was hard even only after a day and a half that was the greatest hardest time I would say in my life I have probably my wife too but I'd say in my life but God worked it for a purpose God's worked it for a reason and that became my battle cry the whole time the Lord get the Lord take away that should be the name of the Lord tomorrow may not be like today next week may not be like this week things may change and they may change drastically but we don't know but we do know what we do know we may not know that but what we do know is it all things are gonna work together for our good because we love God our love is unconditional it's God's love that we've returned back to him ago over love in action that love in action shows up regardless of what takes place I still love him if you still love him you're gonna stay with I mean you're going to get closer to God you're gonna take these hardships in these tough times and you're gonna get closer to God with him become more like him because those that don't love him like that are going to be the people that fall away and they're gonna go away I don't understand this I can't understand none of us may comprehend what God's doing but the point is I don't have to understand it I just have to believe it if God's working it for his purpose for his will then it's all going to come together for our good all right amen praise the Lord we're all going to be there together and as to them who are the called according to God's purpose you know the later we get to the end of this time and they're taught and the higher we get on that pyramid ladder the less room there is at the top so as we climb this ladder of statute of a perfect man we're getting to the place to where some fell away here and some fell away there and some fell away here and some fell away there and the more drastic the cut is at the top the fewer there is left now there's many that fall asleep in the Lord of course those will be there but the alive and remain group is just going to be a small group just going to be a small representation there at the top but the more I've said this before the more a couple spends time together and it can be any couple it doesn't have to be a married couple married couples just spend more time and more intimate time together so it makes a difference but the more time people spend together the more time it any two individuals spend together the more they become like each other and the more they look like each other and I believe that's exactly the purpose God's trying to do he's just trying to get us to the place that we that we spend more time with him that we become closer like him that we look more like him which is the reflection of the word the word is who he is more like the word so that she becomes him flesh of his flesh bone of his bone life of his life spirit of his spirit everything that God does for that purpose is to bring us into his image and more like him closer to him he wants to proclaim Lord I want to be closer to you I want to be more like you and closer to you morning and all this is going on in my life all that's going on in this country in the world Lord just helped me that my life can become more like you amen you know I'll say this and I hope Austin doesn't get embarrassed her Hughley but there was a time when me and my wife David I got a picture over my dresser of us and we were about 18 HF yes dating him this is it same man well and you know I you know high school was a blur for me they often just graduated so congratulations well glad you were able to make it you both did okay well congratulations to both of you we think well we said we made you're just starting but anyway I thought my school is a blur to me and it was a blur because I only cared about one thing and that was she's sitting on the back row I didn't care what grades I got I didn't care what classes I took I enjoyed woodshop I enjoy band because she was in it but I I had just got to work think well you know that that's just the end all that's it you know that's she's everything I wanted need and that's life you know what that's that's gonna be the Adhan that that that became so all-consuming you know it just became a part of life thought well forget the place we're married then we get to the place we have kids and we get to but you soon realize when you get a little age on you that that was just one little chapter in the whole storybook and in the whole story book of life and and as my life as it was or my wife's or maybe be yours and that all consuming time it was for me it was all about her that's it for me it was all about her so being at that place at that time no meant a lot to me but you know it was just as all-consuming as it was that it's just that one little moment of time one little blip of life that moves on from there that you get to the next one and then you move to the next one then life goes on and then this changes over here and this is different and then it's just you begin to realize it was just it was just a part of life it was just a chapter of life in that position what we're going through now is is that it is that chapter it is that part of life it's this little time that gods give us right here amen far it's this place we don't know how long we'll be here I tell them up front I said you know you want to make it for next week I said yeah but I need to have the option to cancel it yeah that's no problem cancel when you're lying so we can't so if the board provides another place which I believe he he already has he already knows and just waiting from show me or open it up I literally believe and I'll just say this as I close I literally believe just between us that the Lord has the place and I believe that place is gonna is gonna open up in the next 60 90 days something to that effect it's just it's there it's just not in the place for us yet now whether that means a place to rent maybe that or that means financial ability to purchase something I don't know but it's just how I feel so you can feel something and not have all the details right you may not know specifically but I really believe this is going to happen and so if as it comes forth I believe that's going to happen and it's just another part our chapter live in life that God continues to bring us forward on amen but all of it all of it just like I was with my wife then my whole desire was to be closer to her now all my whole desire is to be closer to him I believe that sprinters are - I trust that's all of our desires today is to take this time and all that's going on and and whatever happens and just use that to to become closer to the Lord amen and I believe God will bless us by it to continue to help us keep us and strengthen us in this in this walk amen let's stand if we could I appreciate the Lord's goodness and blessing us and I do appreciate the place the Lord provided for us over here tonight I appreciate the Lord providing us this as I said the other day I didn't worry I've told y'all several times even from years ago if the Lord was to take us out of the other place he had another place for us because it's his work so he's responsible to it it's not yours not mine it's his right so if it's his and he's responsible to it not me not you he's responsible if he's responsible then I guarantee he's gonna take care of it exactly so when the Lord put on my heart that to have a provision he brought me right here I told you this is the first place the Lord brought me I've passed all the other hotels to come here just because that's what my heart now I went to I went to all the other hotels none of work days in across the street I told you last week was half this size and twice the money went to others they weren't opening theirs up yet the Lord brought me here so there's a reason I believe there's a reason why we're here I'm believing is to pray but there's I'm looking for something more permanent Amen that the Lord will the Lord opens up for us so amen you agree with me yes Amen god bless you gotta keep us healthy and strong watch over protect and bless you amen let's why don't we use our our departing song that Joel sang for us can we do that amen praise the well I was gonna
