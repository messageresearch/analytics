of you amen hallelujah oh saints i'm just going to go out on a limb here and say that i believe we all want that yes amen i know we all need it praise the lord but i believe that we all want it we've all had the things of the world the things in life and all that goes on in the world amen but what we need more than anything is more of him praise the lord jesus and i believe that heart that desire in that heart will bring it to pass one more before we go to the lord in prayer now one more little chorus number 543 of the book amen is on the screen here praise the lord jesus i want more of jesus more more and more amen i want more than i've ever had before praise the lord let this be that day amen and then let tomorrow be that day and then let the next day be that day words more more grow in grace amen praise the lord i want more of jesus more and more and more i want more of jesus than i've ever had before [Music] i want more of jesus so i give him more of me amen [Music] [Music] so i give [Music] him jesus [Music] [Music] [Music] jesus more and more and more i want more of jesus [Music] [Music] amen praise the lord jesus so we know what the solution is we want more of him we give him more of ourselves praise the lord jesus amen that's what makes the difference we relinquish ourselves and our rights into his hands he can take it and use it amen praise the lord jesus we've got a few uh prayer requests here that we want to make mention to you today um thank you sister matisse for writing this as a praise so it's easier for me to recognize if it's a praise report if it says that on there um art and shri are on their way supposed to be the biosteros or running a little bit late today but sister shreya wanted me to put a prayer request in for art his shoulder effect still bothering him remember last week we had that prayer request for him so let's continue to remember him in prayer also micah put in a prayer request brother tom zanka of course uh that's still like today's the last day of the gym show so they'll be starting to wrap up probably not tonight maybe a little tonight but more tomorrow and so mike put in a prayer request that laura would just help him and the ones that are helping him next few days breaking down all the displays and handling the big heavy rock and machinery so we want to remember him in prayer in that situation also brother angel told me they would be streaming today god bless you family if you're there now trust you are that he put in a prayer request they uh streaming today because they have a little sickness in the family there in the home and they all you know in the same home and his mom and all uh had a little sickness there so they felt to stay home instead of coming and potentially spreading it but he had a prayer request if uh pray for healing of course for them granted the desires of their heart for a home of course brother angel says priscilla they want to try to move out of their mom's home again and get a home of their own which i would advise there's always a reason why the bible said to leave father and mother and cling to the family that's the way it's uh hopefully now sometimes it works out okay but a lot of times it doesn't um i know when we tried to live with my mother didn't work yeah even after my dad passed away uh it it didn't work just as much as my mom loved my uh my wife and my wife my mother and everything it just you know it just without going into detail it just doesn't work just didn't work so we moved out and everything was great but they want to have a new home and want to try to find a new home their finances close the wall to the lord remove all doubts fears unbelief let their epistle be rid of all men grace and mercy to god so remember that in prayer for them as well amen i did not see any prayer requests over there uh but if you have an unspoken one and let it be known by updating him so thank you have brother dennis for the danny back with us today battling that devil coveted amen but by the grace of god they didn't get it too heavy and of course you don't see my family or mine and sonia's tabitha and zach and the kids are home tabitha and joel tested positive this week for covet with the little home test thing they're both feeling fine the whole family zach had a few little symptoms too but they're all feeling fine they're doing good but they stayed home of course just to be safe so they're home today god bless you love my family too miss you joel and emma and my family but uh they're home there so let's pray for them too if you would remember them in prayer amen praise the lord let's stand on our feet then trying to think it seems like i always feel like a lot of times i'm up here and i forget certain requests or something and that's why i try to write them down and put them in my phone so that i know them sometimes i forget them if if there was one that i forgot then you can let me know uh or if you have one that i forgot you can raise your hand i always forget amen god knows though that's the most important thing so amen brother dennis would you take these things to the lord brother lord jesus we bought our hearts and heads and unity of the faith yes father known father you are mindful of each and every one of us yes there's no respected persons to you you're not partial whatever we have need of you are concerned and you're more than able to meet our needs according to your riches and glory amen knowing father it's not something you can do you might do you will do it's something you have done already at calvary and i heard the prophet as i was driving up to church he says there's one place you meet each and every believer that's under the shed blood of jesus christ hallelujah and whatever we can be the father with all that's going on with this coping and these diseases and whoever needs a healing touch you are our great physician a high priestess that can be touched by the feelings of our infirmities and with your stripes we are healed yes we got to claim what you have done for us yes the word says you're a high priest of our confession and we stand on your word we stand on your promises it's not our fight father it's yours it's not our battle it's yours help us to recognize that more and more lord we try to do things ourselves we're going to fall short of by a million miles but father greater he that's in us than he is in the world amen father is your work that you want to complete in each and every one this morning lord may we be yielded vessels lord that you can complete the work you can finish what you have started and father that our hearts will be longing for more of you ours will be striving to be in line with your word no compromise no no uh laxatical attitudes oh father set our hearts on fire yes we know the enemy recognizes that his time is almost out and he's fighting harder than ever before but father you are fighting harder than ever before for your people and we claim each and everyone's needs well whether it be a house whether it be finances whatever it may be our father has met our needs according to your word and your promises yes granted lord in your name we pray name the lord jesus christ amen hallelujah amen god bless you could be seated amen i want to say i woke up in the middle of the night last night and the devil had attacked my throat or something i had a nightmare dream i don't really understand or know what happened i still can't comprehend what happened but i woke up coughing wheezing hacking couldn't breathe i was gagging i don't i don't know i don't know what it was i don't know what happened my wife came in and um she's like what's going on i said i just feel like i got something in my throat and she said can you breathe and i breathe in and out of my nose and it was it was the weirdest experience i don't know what happened but it was like it was like something was grasping my throat that's right um and and i just can't explain it i even looked up on my phone real quick what it might be you know when you feel a lump in your throat or something uh i i just don't know um like i said it just felt like something was gripping my throat and she brought me some honey and drank a little water or something and i just went back to sleep thought well if i can breathe through my nose i can breathe and you have to be fine if if i'm not i'll see you lord real soon but uh he took care of me and woke up this morning felt good and i got to be honest saying my throat feels stronger today than i can i can't remember my throat feeling this strong when you when you sing and you lead songs and i tend to get a little happy up here so i'll probably probably sing beyond my voice's potential uh and probably gets me in trouble sometimes but i can't help it just the spirit just gets on me i just want to uh praise him so much and uh and then in preaching and you throw you know how brother branham said he got callouses on his voice on his vocal cords and but uh i i i gotta be after last night i thought man my my throat feels stronger today than i can remember i can't remember last time i'm just so thankful god blessed it amen i want to sing another song here we got a few praise reports and micah has a song for us um it's song number 612 if you're home looking in a song book or it's on the screen if you hear amen as the deer painted for the water amen praise the lord our soul belongs after him he is our portion he is our refuge our strength our guide [Music] the water [Music] desire and i long to worship thee you alone are my strength my shield to your [Music] all alone are my hearts desire and i long to worship you're my friend and you are my brother even though you are a king i love you more [Music] my [Music] desire i want you more than gold or silver only [Music] is [Music] my [Music] be one more time now you all are my strengths [Music] you alone are my hearts desire and i long to worship amen hallelujah thank you jesus he's our hearts desire saints amen i love to worship him i love to praise him i thank him did he give us this place we can come in out from the world and shut those doors and it's just us amen he's here manifesting himself in our lives letting him letting us know that he's here with us and it's a desire it's a longing in our hearts to continue to worship to praise him amen thank you jesus what a wonderful god he is amen thank you lord sister matisse wrote this praise report down it says thank you jesus for taking away the covet spirit that was sitting on my chest squeezing me the spirit is gone by jesus spirit in his blood i have taken time to clear it out mucus so don't panic if i call but i haven't heard him yet so praise the lord the spirit is the spirit of covet is gone though hallelujah and thank you all for praying amen brother danny wrote one as well i want to thank god uh that catching coveted was not as serious as it could have been i felt like i had a cold and congested i know it affects everyone differently but i still feel congested every day especially in the morning this uh must be after the after effect i pray that it will ease off amen of course it does amen you're healed praise the lord in jesus name thank god for that wonderful testimony from brother danny amen thank the lord sister lydia sent me a praise report this week as you probably all know i'm sure she gave it to the sisters especially her blood work came back and everything's perfect amen everything's normal everything's right everything's good praise the lord so thank god for that she also gave a praise report about robert but i'm gonna let her give it because i i forgot exactly the details and i have to look it up on my phone anyway uh robert um had a issues with its intestines that's what it was and now uh they have given him some antibiotics for 10 days and then after the 10 days he will go back to the doctor and see if he is going to need more treatment but uh he was at my house yesterday and he looked really well he thanks everybody for your prayers and um we're just hoping that it's nothing in your house yes amen praise the lord amen so far so good and in case y'all were wondering um we don't necessarily although some need it but we don't necessarily pass the mic around because we can't hear one another but because of the camera uh sometimes when you speak it's just not quite loud enough to get to the camera mic so that it goes out to those streaming and those who might watch it in archives so if you're wondering and you don't like holding the mic or something it's it's really you might think well they can hear me it's really more uh for the camera and the streaming than anything else so that you know that mike has got a song for us she's also got a testimony and he wrote it down for me but i'm gonna go ahead and just let him give the testimony since he's seen anyway so go ahead mike um so i went to get my oil change thursday and i asked specific questions to make sure that they were doing what i knew needed to be done other than changing the water like topping off coolant and stuff like that but after i got done the coolant my coolant light kept coming on so this morning i was like i need to check it i checked it they didn't top it off but also the cap to the oil where you put it in the engine was not on so i freaked out a little bit and started panicking and i was looking around the engine and looking underneath to see if maybe it fell in the oil pan around and i i was like man and they're closed on sunday so i can't call them to see if they have it i could drive and see if autozone had it because i woke up early this morning i would have had time i was like okay calm down florida i need your help just find this and then so i just pan down and on the black rim of the engine casing there it was sitting upside down it kind of blended in so just because it was black also so i just want to thank the lord for helping me find it thursday friday saturday and today four days without the oil cap on and it was just sitting there thank you we all know this song was a blessing there's one verse that people don't sing very often and i'm going to sing that one today too but the word should be on the uh oh here we go sorry about that feel free [Music] [Applause] [Music] and my life is worth the living just because he lives [Music] and they called him jesus [Music] is [Music] is [Music] a newborn baby [Music] amen [Music] this child can face uncertainties because jesus [Music] [Applause] [Music] because is [Music] and life is worth the meaning just because he lives [Music] oh [Music] [Music] amen [Music] is [Music] [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Music] thank you jesus praise the lord he makes it all worth living doesn't he amen by his grace and mercy and his life in our life you know there's nothing like trust in the lord jesus for everything amen in all things and in all ways we trust him amen praise the lord that's the thing the world can't see you know the world makes excuses and talks about what about this and that what about this disaster and this destruction and this death and this person and this situation in the dark ages and you know they just don't see the sovereignty of god they just can't realize how much we're just clay in the potter's hands amen and they missed the whole you missed the whole thing amen missed the whole scenario about being a christian just for that purpose but i'm so thankful god reveals it to us amen it lets us know it's his greater plan and his perfect will whatever it is that's what i want to do amen thank you jesus let's stand to our feet now amen we'll go ahead and go to the word of god and change the order of the service and good to see you again brother chuck good to have you brother amen thanks for bringing your mother we're going to turn over to saint luke chapter 12. saint luke chapter 12 we're going to read a couple of verses here verses 32-34 and just a little something simple this morning got here this morning and i looked in the closet and kind of wore a different i guess uh color combo than i really ever wear and i got here and i think i looked like the carpet because i got the revelation of the carpet this morning i looked and i thought wow it's pretty close yeah amen sounds good to me praise the lord jesus luke 12 20 32 but let's just bow our heads for a while if we could lord jesus father we're certainly grateful thankful lord that you're here with us yes lord you never leave us or forsake us you promised you'd be here with us and we're so thankful that you are father and know that your spirit is moving among us and manifesting yourself to us raising our faith level lord to the place that we can receive what we need from you today from this word what you have to speak to us lord correct us strengthen us bless us lord uplift us and encourage us lord and give us that uh that desire to we continue to press this battle of life lord god we have ups and downs we have goods and bads we have ins and outs but lord through all of it you already you are always there you are the lily of the valley as well as the bright morning stars and we thank you god for these that have come lord for those who may be streaming watching today lord may you just bless us in a special way god help those at home god may your spirit that is omnipresent go all over lord who may be watching and be a participant of this service even those who may archive it later god would just trust you and believe that your spirit is going to brood over us be with us move in and out through us lord god we rebuke every demonic spirit that would try to hurt hinder infiltrate this service in any way that you lord would get the glory honor and praise for all that is said and done here today lord we're thankful for all that you do for us and lord we're thankful through the week god and for this sunday morning that you give us this place that you've given us to come to this morning and expecting you to meet with us to speak to us and have your way in each and every one of our lives so god just let this word come forth in power and manifestation of your spirit and let it not return void but accomplish that that you send it forth for and bring us more into your image and likeness by it we commit it to you and ask your uh uh your hand of mercy to be upon it upon us lord to anoint the hearing speaker as we commit this remaining part of the service into your hands in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen luke 12 32 32-34 let you be seated fear not little flock what is your father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom sell that ye have and give alms provide yourselves bags which wax not old a treasure in heaven in the heavens that faileth not where no thief approacheth nor moth corrupt for where your treasure is there will your heart be also you can be seated if you'd like amen i guess that's quite a scripture for today when we see and acknowledge and recognize around the country around the world the great thefts that are taking place all over the place brazen thefts thefts that just you know divide defy logic defy any thought of things it's almost a weekly occurrence anymore that i look and see things that's going on and you know it could discourage you if you're not a christian if you don't know better and you don't know where you're going and what the lord's doing in our lives it can be quite discouraging but when you recognize the lord's hands on it all and he's taking care of it but every week is like something that i look at and see and i think mine when i was a child this would have never happened when i was growing up you would have never seen this when i was in school this would have never happened and it seems like a weekly occurrence anymore that i'm saying that about things that are unfolding just in our country but it comes to help us recognize that so many of those things that we're still living in satan's eden but god's protection is around us god still takes care of us and blesses us and watches over us but my thought this morning is going to be on the actual 34th verse which where you are uh where for where your treasure is there will your heart be also where your treasure is there your heart be also i want to speak on a little subject of what is your appetite what are you desiring what is it that you want amen because everybody does everybody has things that goes on in their mind and then their spirit everybody has things that goes on in their soul and those things that are in life that we do we do to satisfy those appetites uh we are supposed i guess the sisters and the brothers too i guess we're gonna go have some to eat after church here today and you know it's to satisfy a certain appetite uh a physical appetite is something that our brains are telling us that control tower god put in us that we have to go eat or we're going to die well you know the same thing is in our soul the same thing with our spirit body the spirit man there's something that has to that he has to have or he's going to die spiritually so the question then becomes what's feeding you what is your appetite what are you wanting uh what is it you're looking for because the bible jesus said here where your treasure is there's where your heart's gonna be you know a treasure is something that somebody lays up or stores up a treasure is something like uh uh you know would be maybe in the old pirate days in a treasure chest with gold coins today their bank accounts or uh iras or something like that they're treasures there's things that we consider valuable or we have a safe at home with uh valuables or guns in it or memorabilia or something from our lives from our kids and you know those are treasures that we store up it's things that we consider important you know it wouldn't be a treasure uh it would be a treasure to you if it wasn't something that was that was the desire of your heart i think that's what jesus is saying here because it's the desire of your heart that's what makes it a treasure because where your treasure is that's where your heart's going to be well the treasure is there because that's what your heart is desiring that's where your appetite is that's what you're thinking now in the natural we think about things we have storage my wife keeps telling us we need to get rid of the storage so all that stuff away but a lot of that stuff we have in that storage are things that our kids and uh from years ago and things that were important to us and i have little things that i say that she might not know that i have left over from high school when we were dating stuff like that those are physical uh desires physical appetite of things that we consider a treasure it's a treasure to me somebody would come along if i uh if i neglected to pay the bill on the storage unit and some storage wars were coming along and they bought it they'd take this stuff and they thought the fastest quickest closest dumpster they could find but to me it's a treasure to me it's important to me it's a it's a memory she said you never look at that stuff again don't matter i know it's there am i i know it's there so it's important to me it's a treasure to me is it a treasure to you what is your treasure see and that's just something physical of course ministering church or majoring on the spiritual aspect of it and where that treasure is and what that storing up is because that's what's going to tell uh dictate in your heart what what what is in your heart what is in your heart is going to be what's valuable to you it's going to be what you feed on and where your appetite is that your treasure is going to be uh that is going to be a reflection of where your heart is your treasure what you've stored up what you felt important to you spiritually is what you're storing up it's where your heart is it's what's controlling you it's that control tower of god see because we had a control tower in our in the spirit being we had a control tower when we were sinners when we were lost in sinners and lived in the world and weren't born again and just lived off the desires of our old nature that's what we stored up that's what we felt was important that's where our heart was so that's what we fed on but when you become born again then you start feeding on something different you start feeding on things that are more important to you your appetite changes yes that's the see the bottom line of the service today your appetite changes it changes from the things of the world to the things of god it changes for the things of satan to the things of the lord and when it does then everything about that because you have a heart change you have a soul change when that nature changes then everything that comes with that changes as well your appetite changes what you consider important changes what you store up as a treasure changes all those things are different than what they used to be spiritually because you now are a different person you're not the same person you were then you are a new creature in christ jesus so the appetite that that you portray is what's in your heart right it's what you want to it's what you want to feed and the reason i want to nail that down is the fact that that that will show to you not in church not around other church members or when you're trying to be all good and nice and and we're trying to put forth a facade of some kind but you know if your heart is changed and you're a new person you don't have to put up a facade you don't have to be pretentious you just be who you are because who you are is manifesting from your heart is showing that now it's of god and my appetite is for god not of the world so it's a it's a great barometer it's a great uh uh type host i guess you'd say or or measure that you can know what kind of heart you have now what appetite you have because that's gonna prove what's in your heart when you get outside of church when you're at work or when you're alone what is your appetite what are you wanting to feed on what what are you wanting your soul what do you want in your spirit body to feed on that that time because what you're wanting to feed on at that time is proof of what's in your heart where you're at whether you're saved or not whether you're born again or not that'll dictate to it because that's the number one barometer that tells you because what you desire is what's in your heart right what you if you desire to eat that just shows that there's something that that that's that's missing and in the simplistic form of it food is missing and as food is missing you get hungry if water is missing you get thirsty that just shows that that that what is controlling you in here that's naturally again so spiritually it proves to you what spirit you are of what nature you are of depending on what you're desiring to feed off of amen now i'm not saying we're monks and then every single waking moment that you're uh that you're in a prostate position or something we all have lives and we all do things and uh and things of our lives to enjoy our lives and things like that but that's not what we're talking about we're talking about the fundamental foundation of the of the the desire that's in your heart the appetite that you have because what treasures your your your uh building up is proving what's there amen so we understand that's what's showing it what's there um what's important to you amen uh like i said about the storage unit you i guess you've heard the old saying a one man's junk to another man's treasure uh there's people in the world today that are making a boatload of money because they're taking some piece of junk somebody sold for a dollar to yard sale and they're because they know the value of it and they're taking and putting it on ebay or online somewhere and they're selling it for 100 000 hundred dollars or a thousand dollars or five thousand whatever they can get for it sometimes somebody buys an old painting or something they think is worthless well it was hung at my great-grandma's house and you know she died and it was getting rid of it they said oh you want it and i said no not really well take it because of some memorabilia and the next first yard sale they get they sell it for five bucks and somebody takes it who knows what they're doing and they take that painting and say now that painting's worth ten thousand dollars they'll buy for five bucks and sell it for ten grand amen one man's junction another man's treasure but what is the treasure to us what's important to us let's go over to matthew and uh read a scripture here to continue with matthew five matthew 5 1 beginning of the beatitude sermon on the mount matthew chapter five verse one and seeing the multitudes he went up into a mountain and when he was set his disciple set his disciples came unto him and he opened his mouth and taught them saying blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven blessed are they that mourn for they shall be comforted you know shall is the most positive word in the english language shall they shall be comforted blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth now this goes against everything that the world does today right yeah if you notice if you go and you read through this you recognize that every attribute that god's listing here it really goes completely con the world's going completely contrary to that today sixth verse now blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness what is that appetite that appetite is from someone who is hungering and thirsting for righteousness now what is righteousness christ amen jesus christ is righteous the deeds he did are righteousness he is a righteous god and the only one that is righteous is him and if you thirst and hunger after christ then you can receive that righteousness that he is of because you receive him when you receive him you receive every attribute of him and everything that comes along with that fullness of the godhead bodily comes into you christ is that manifestation of it that that reveals itself to you you hunger and thirst now someone can say well i'm born again well that's wonderful i'm glad i'm filled with god's spirit born again got the holy ghost got the token going in that rapture praise the lord what is your thirst what are you hungry for what is your appetite because if you're hungry and thirsting after righteousness after christ you will be filled amen you will be yeah and that righteousness will become your righteousness you sell righteous automatically god takes care of that by his spirit but you grow in the grace of god the grace and the knowledge of the lord jesus as we continue to uh look and and and act and and present ourselves more christ-like it's like i said last week i don't even think you should be allowed to call yourself a christian unless you've been born again yes and then brother adam said a man shouldn't be ministering the gospel unless he's come face to face with that pillar of fire now he's not talking about a literal pillar of fire but he's talking about the spirit christ in the man i don't believe even a person can call themselves a christian because to be a christian is to be christ-like to be christ-like is manifesting his righteousness to manifest that righteousness proves what appetite you have because that's what your treasure is that's what you desire for that's what you long for is that is that appetite that only he can fill yeah everybody goes to everything else now of course satan will do everything he can to pervert that appetite and to try to get it to uh uh dumbed down or watered down or in some way give some sort of substitute uh try to bring discouragement or distraction or something and of course we know this world is full of distractions and satan does everything you can to try to keep it distracted and pervert that thirst but there's only one if there's a true hunger a true thirst for that righteousness there's only one way that righteousness can be filled and that's by christ yes he's the only one that can do it he's the only one that can fill it it's the only place you can get it you can go to your uh neighbor you can go to the church you can go to your pastor you can go wherever but there's only one that can do that only one that can fulfill that hunger and thirst in your soul and that's jesus christ yes only place you can get it people say well if the prophet we're only here no you know you won't go get it from him if he were still here you couldn't get it from him he didn't give it to anybody only jesus christ could give it amen he is that righteousness we are robed in his righteousness that's what makes us righteous amen righteousness taking on the righteousness of jesus christ because of the hunger the thirst that we have in our lives if that hunger and thirst is in there then that righteousness is going to be there it's going to be the stored up treasure that our heart longs for every day that our heart desires for every day it's long friend as long as we're in this past house as long as we're in this uh this body of flesh we're going to always desire more of god right if we're born of god and our soul is filled with his spirit there's always going to be that hunger for him yes every day every moment even in the depths if we're working our job or or if we're uh just doing something in our normal everyday lives whatever it is it's always going to be that hunger for him a lot of times uh things will happen that to me how the lord speaks sometimes is doing something that i would maybe normally do on a daily basis a daily basis and something specific will happen but because your mind your appetite your desire is in a certain place and it's there all the time even if you're not conscious of it right that when that thing that god whatever reason god made jews a specific time you know you know like he deals with that specific time in that specific way or that specific person to bring something to enlighten you if it wasn't there you would just go right over it i sometimes would probably miss it anyway probably miss god uh even job said he passes by me and i don't even recognize it but most of the time i would say that because that is there because that appetite because of that desire is there when that when an instance comes along and god just reveals himself that much more to you and and opens up more of himself to you which he continues to do yes amen god continues to brother adam said god will be unfolding himself to us through eternity right amen so if he does that every day it shows there's something there that that acute spirit that is that it that is cognizant of god and is desiring to have something from him any moment anytime whenever god wants to show it reveal it to me whenever god wants to let me know whatever sometimes god is coming certain ways at certain times of things i've had on the shelf that i didn't understand for months or years god will reveal to him and and drop it right there say i didn't know i i hadn't seen that right right and then and it cinches it all up right there that just shows see that's in the middle of everything that goes on in life because that desire is there because that heart and that that appetite is there as soon as it comes across you catch because god knows that that that's in your heart and your heart's desiring that and god might come and bring and drop it right there and you say praise the lord that's exactly it i was listening uh monday uh we worked in benson me and brother roger i was going down uh the interstate and listening to a message and and uh brother branham said something and friend i tell you i i probably got to believe and i've quoted this but i've probably got to believe i've heard this multiple times i won't even begin to say how many multiple times i'm sure i've heard this i know i've heard this message very that that really speak to me that brother branham says but when i was going to he he said this one specific thing and for some reason well we know the reason that's what i'm preaching about it quickened to my heart and i thought and i just about wrong throat having a jubilee praise the lord that that's something that had been on my heart for so long and just and i know i've heard it before but because the appetite was there and god come and sweat that across and it quickened to my heart just like that dropped in my heart and quickened praise the lord that's it it wasn't anything that was like an outstanding something that was going to answer the world's problems it's just something that newton had a desire for it's just something that i had been looking at and and got mindful of that and because of that desire god sent it down my you could have fed me a 32-ounce t-bone perfectly cooked in season and i wouldn't have been any happier amen that fed knee is as much as the that steak would have praise the lord the best rack of ribs are the juiciest hunk of brisket that that that was that was food for the soul amen fed me praise the lord but you understand it wasn't anything i wasn't in my closet i wasn't down on my knees every moment that you live because of that desire because of that appetite god can drop something at any time amen somebody else somebody stranger in a supermarket might say it and and something quickened to you amen it's just that simple but it's based on your appetite it's based on your hunger where your heart is and what you're desiring what you're looking for amen because god's going to feel it saints he's going to feel it and the difference between when you are a sinner and now that you're born again is so astronomically different the appetite doesn't even resemble each other anymore amen it just it comes to the part of what you what you want what are you wanting see look in that same message now this this isn't um this quote isn't what uh what the lord had dropped in my heart this this came afterwards that part but this is from that message things that are to be he said now notice how the expecting mother on earth today how the mother's body craves for certain things mother pregnant amen craves for certain things you had a husband's have a wife that's been pregnant you know what i'm talking about or what he's talking about and i know it as well too amen it's the only time in life when uh it's probably the only time in life when certain women leap pickled ice cream or or or uh licorice chicken just or uh sardines or something it got a midnight at midnight they got a craving for sardines i don't know anybody who's ever had a craving for sardines you might have had to eat them for survival but a craving for sardines does that exist i don't want to offend anybody you know what i'm saying but when a mother when she gets that baby see there's just those things that she craves for certain things she didn't crave them before she got pregnant but now there's life in her because there's another life in her it's causing her body to react in the chemistry of her body to react in certain ways it tells her i need this i'm craving this i want this and and it's to get in her body to take care of her and the baby he said now i guess uh i'm speaking i hope to all adults that will understand the mother and the birth of the baby if there's something lacking in her body she begins to crave certain things now brother branham is isolating this to a woman who is pregnant a woman who is pregnant not a man despite all the world's trying to tell you today a man can't get pregnant i don't care how many emojis iphone puts on their phone of a pregnant man it is not possible it's biologically impossible but when a woman gets pregnant you see her body changes and that's who brother adam's talking about but you know it happens in your natural body under normal circumstances as well if your body starts craving or needing certain things your body will start acting in a certain way to make you want that whatever's in there brother bantam talked about the the the boy needing sulfur his body needing sulfur so much that he started eating the buy the petal off his bicycle and erasers off the pencil to get the sulfur that his body was needing so bad the same thing will happen to our bodies our natural bodies if your body is needing something uh it'll start craving that thing until you until you satisfy it with something and with that item with that chemical chemical that vitamin that that that thing that our that our bodies are made of that it needs uh i know sometimes on the job especially in the summer i'm getting a little dehydrated my body will start cramping up well that's just my body saying you need this get some potassium get some water uh get something in your body because my body is reacting to adversely to something because it needs something else right it needs this food or it needs this water it needs something to to help calm that down and take care of the problem see and your body does that now brother adam specifically talking about a pregnant woman because that's probably more uh of course i don't know how more extreme you can get than eating the petals off a bicycle but uh the extremities that we see when the woman gets pregnant sometimes like i said uh you know she's not gonna eat the i the pickle ice cream before after she's pregnant just during and and at midnight one o'clock or whatever however you can get it but our bodies are like that anyway well if our natural body is like that is not our spiritual body like that yeah it is not even at midnight one o'clock two o'clock in the morning isn't our spiritual bodies like that that craves for something as well has god ever woke you up at two or three in the morning and all of a sudden you don't realize why you're awake but something drops into your heart and and and you know it's god's presence there amen or during the day i talked about you know during the day or going down the road or meeting somebody but sometimes just wake up and not really realize or why god i need to get some sleep got to work tomorrow but god's got something he wants to drop into your heart right amen and god will do it look how dad he said i remember we was raised in such a poor family we didn't hardly have anything to eat when many of us uh were kids many of you suffered the same thing so it seems like it's getting back to that too so how that when before the baby would be born mother would crave something and dad would just pinch corners everything to get it for her see it's her the body her body the calcium so forth of her body the vitamins that she needs judy is being made up see and she craves for things the food for the coming child and how the parents they try to get this so the baby will be born as perfectly and happy as possible her body is craving that her body is needing that if her physical body is needing that friend our spiritual bodies are needing that she is craving that because she's pregnant amen she's she's craving it because her body has changed she's not the person she was before she was pregnant we are not the people we were before we became born again before we became christians and it changes our appetite yes it does it changes what we feed on it changes what we desire it changes what our treasures are what's important to us all those things change but because we're different people so what is our appetite what do we desire to feed on what do we desire to lay our treasures up that's where our heart is hungry thirst after righteousness you will be filled you shall be filled amen and that feeling is his spirit that comes and reveals itself to us and lets himself be known to us amen let me read this we'll go to second corinthians here but in thirst abraham says now we find god gives the control tower to you to give you the things that you need amen now that's spiritual and physical god gives you the control tower so that it can give you the things that you need now the control tower in you is what directs you and this thirst runs this control tower tells you what you have need of spiritually speaking the control tower in the body and in the soul also there's a control tower of the body that tells you that you need the things in your body and it's brought to you by thirst your body starts thirsting lips get chapped mouth gets dry you ever notice you ever uh i used to have seen like old westerns back in the time and filmed in tucson or different places and and they'd be out in a desert and had no water they would go pick up a couple of pebbles or something off the ground and start sucking on a pebble because they're trying to generate some saliva in their mouth so that their mouths aren't so dry but then it gets to a place to where you can't even produce or generate any saliva because your body's gotten so dried up but what's it doing it's telling you it's like the crayons it's telling you you need water if you don't get water in simplistic terms with the body you're going to die if you don't get it you're going to die and it's telling you that it's letting you know i believe that's what god tries to let us know every day amen we need him we need that hunger that thirst we need to crave for god we need to crave for his life his his uh his spirit his words because that's what's going to sustain the spiritual man because if we neglect the spirit man it's going to die the spirit man is going to wither away and our spirit our experience with the lord is going to become nothing amen we'll quit the things of god reading our bible or praying or coming to church or tithes or offering whatever it is the things that we that we do in god's life it just it's showing that something's starting to dry up and wither away right when you start neglecting the things that you used to consider important things that you used to consider essential when those things start going away and driving up drying up oh i'm too busy to pray anymore then you're too busy to live because you can't live without it yes i i i'm too busy to pray or read my bible anymore i'm too busy to come to church well then i tell you what i'm gonna pray that god take everything out of your life that's encumbering you so that you can get back to where you should be with him and i probably don't even have to pray that because if you belong to him he'll do it anyway amen he'll do it anyway it's like uh i've experienced and i've known and ministering almost 35 years now and different places of the country different churches people i notice when people aren't given to the lord when they're not giving to the lord their lives start going downhill that's right things start getting in trouble for them they start having more problems different ways because look whether it's a set of tires or tithe in a box god's going to get it anyway that's just what happens god takes care of that so what boils down to then is god saying to you just like the mouth the pebbles just like the body the cramping god is telling you you need to change course you need to change something you need to let me be your desire spiritually hunger and thirst you shall be filled you need to change this get unbusy my work keeps me too busy well then god's gonna fire you if you belong to him and work is keeping you from him you're done you forget that job you're just quit now before you even get fired you understand because it's not god's not going to let anything become between you and him yes and if it starts to if it gets to that place to wear that thirsty it's like it's like uh we just read that first scripture when jesus said uh sell that you have give alms and give your alms provide yourselves now look what he's saying provide yourselves bags which a bag is just something that they carry their money in you notice that judas held the bag when they talked about jesus with the disciples judas was the possessor of the bag the bag is something that is what's held your your uh your wealth your possessions your treasure your treasures were in your bag see uh just like when david went down he had his bag and when david went down to the creek uh he had his bag he took those five smooth stones and he stuck them in his bag amen his treasure so when he got to the place that he needed him it was in his back well jesus is saying provide yourselves bags which wax not which means what not a natural not this natural thing that holds a dollar or two but your bag of god of of the spirit of god that holds up treasures in heaven that moth can't corrupt and thieves cannot steal put your treasure there not here there praise the lord that's why he said so then he said where your treasure there's where your heart is amen there's where the difference comes there's control tower in the body tells you what you uh what need in your body it's brought to you by thirst and like i said the other that's god speaking to you amen that's god speaking to you also there's a control tower in your soul that tells you the spiritual things that you have need of something in your spirit and you by this listen now and you by this can tell what kind of life is controlling you amen amen by this that spirit control tower that tells you the spiritual things that you need by this that spirit it will tell you what kind of life is controlling you that's guess in a nutshell what i was sort of trying to explain earlier that's how you can know what life is controlling you amen when you can see your desires are then you can tell that by that what are your desires by that what kind of thing what kind of something that's in you that's creating this desire that you have see it can tell in your soul what's this uh what this desire is by the nature of the thirst that you have on the nature of the thirst that you have amen got a couple more scriptures second corinthians before we close second corinthians chapter five amen second corinthians chapter five just to try to finish this off now second corinthians 5 verse 16. and i will honest i've had i've had a couple things in my heart i've wanted to try to to bring here and i every sunday it's it's almost like the lord is keeps putting it off so i just keep bringing what he gives me uh until we get to that point so just trusting him whatever whatever the lord's doing that's what matters the most second corinthians 5 16 now wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh yea though we have known christ after the flesh yet now henceforth knowing him no more therefore if any man be in christ he is a new creature he is the righteousness of jesus christ old things are passed away the appetite of the old days has passed away behold all things are become new not some he's not saying hold on to this all this stuff out here and and and but this is okay just give jesus this but not this give god this but not this no no all things all things have become new and all things are of god who has reconciled us to him by jesus christ and had given us the ministry of reconciliation we have been purchased by his blood and brought back together with him brother branham puts it this way man and god heaven and earth embrace one another again yes praise the lord the ministry of reconciliation to it that is to say that god was in christ reconciling the world unto himself not imputing their trespasses unto them and had committed unto us the word of reconciliation how their how there can be a reconciliation because there's an imputation of sin or no imputation of sin when sin is not imputed when sin is not reckoned to you then you can be reconciled to the sinless one because god took away our sin and made us sinners or the very righteousness of jesus christ then man and god can be reconciled again amen the word of reconciliation now them now then we are ambassadors for christ as though god did this beseech you by us we pray you in christ said be reconciled to god for he hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin that we but we might be made the righteousness of god in him praise the lord he took our sin because he was sinless and made us sinless who was sin so that we might can become the righteousness of jesus christ yes the only way we can be righteous is the fact that he gave us and robed us in his righteousness that's the only righteousness we could attain to it's the only way we could even say that we are righteous it's because of him did he make this man righteous this mutant benedict is not righteous my flesh my my my body here me as a human it's not righteous i make mistakes and do things wrong all the time we all do all of sin and come short of the glory of god but his righteousness is what i stand upon because it's his righteousness that destroyed sin in my life that made me righteous praise the lord amen amen thank god for that romans chapter 3. romans 3 21. but now let's see here romans 3 21 yes but now the righteousness of god without the law listen now the righteousness of god without the law is manifested who is he talking about he's talking about christ he's talking about jesus jesus was manifested as the righteousness of god without the law why did the law not pertain as we would say to christ because he was sinless why did law come into play to begin with because of sin because sin came in play it took it took a law to bring man under control to try to squelch the sin in their lives without a speed limit sign on the interstate could you imagine how fast people would be going on the interstate right now if there was no sign on there to tell them to go a certain limit i mean i know nobody obeys it anyway or most a lot of people but it would be anarchy i mean there's places in the world like the audubon where there is no speed limit and there's actually less accidents on the audubon than there is mo in a city like tucson that goes on because they're just going 200 miles an hour and they're all going this way and they're not stopping and they're not swerving and they're not exiting and coming on they're just going and they have actually less accidents than they do anyplace else but anyway that's beside the point but that law is to bring people under subjection to the law to to squelch a person down because a nature because the nature of a man is a brute beast and he is his nature is just to go wild and just to do anything and everything and you see kind of that nature exposing itself in this country today people are kind of just doing whatever they want right they're living doing going however they want to setting up homeless camps with needles and school yards and uh going and smashing stuff out of people's stores and just taking them and walking out going into a a drug store with a bag and just clearing off the shelves and just walk right out the door no regard for anything anybody or any you know it means absolutely nothing see no limits see so it becomes complete anarchy so the law came in to respect because god needed to bring man back into a perspective of being like him with laws with truth with justice with a heart that is obedient well jesus came without sin so because there was no sin in him he was the perfect man he didn't have to worry about a law to keep him under control the life that was in him kept him what he who he was supposed to be and that's what he projects to us yes not that he did away with the law the law has not been done away with because we're still humans brew beasts but the spirit of god the sinless spirit of god that came in us makes us that way automatically because it changed your desire it changed your appetite there was once time an appetite for you to just live however and drink smoke drugs gamble riders living whatever it was you might have done every bit of it because that was desiring you to do that brought you under the law but when you got born again and the spirit of christ came into you which was manifested without law it made you sinless and it changed your desires right now you don't need somebody to tell you don't go into denny's and have a meal and walk out without pain there's something in you that tells you that don't go into the to the jewelry store and bash the cabinet the counters out and steal tens of thousands of jewelry out of there because there's something in you that tells you that's wrong you shouldn't do that and it keeps you from doing it now i'm not going to say that these people that are doing it aren't doing it because they think it's the right thing to do i i don't know what they're thinking obviously they're not thinking right but you understand my point when christ is in you you don't need a sign to tell you don't do this don't do that don't go here don't go there because that life is already in you that life is what controls you now that life is what controls your desire that life is what controls your appetite that life is what tells you what to and god give us his word to live by so what greater thing do we have saints we have his life and his spirit in us and him and the letter of the word to live by what greater thing is there no wonder jesus said if you hunger and thirst after righteousness you shall be filled right amen it's inherent because god giveth yes and if we do it he will do what he said he would do yes the righteousness of god without the law is manifested being witnessed by the law and the prophets now look who witnesses it the law witnesses it because why because the law has no power over him amen you understand the law has no power over him because he's perfect he's sinless so the law has the so the law is witnessing this the prophet's witnessing because there's no power over that because he's sinless perfect even the righteousness of god which is by faith of jesus christ unto all and upon all them that believe for there is what there's no difference praise the lord amen so the righteousness that jesus christ was on when he was a flesh man living here is the same righteousness that you are now robbed of there's no difference no difference amen amen jesus christ that righteous come upon all them that believe and we believe i believe we're a group of believers today we believe that that faith brings us into that place to help us understand there's not a difference very well in the life that was in him and the life that was reviewed romans 8 says if that same life that was in him is in you it'll do the same thing to you as it did to him right amen there's no difference yes praise the lord for all have sinned and come short of the glory of god being justified freely by his grace justified now that word justifies the same word is righteous righteous the word righteous means it is ought to be conditioned if you're righteous it means that you are what you supposed to be in christ in god's eyes in god's mind not the world in god's mind the way god looks at you your righteousness when god sees righteousness he sees it as it should be as he's seen it before the foundation of the world justifies the same thing when you've been justified it means though you had never done it in the first place right which means that it never in your life it never happened now that's not a physical application that is a spiritual application now some people try to attach that to a physical application and get things all messed up amen somebody might have been drunk and ran over a woman with a kid and killed them all and got in court and said well judge i never did it well we got witnesses that say you did it it's your car we got a photograph we got people that saw you we know that you are the one in there we know that well yeah but i've been justified oh yeah he'll throw you in jail quicker you can spit amen why because you did it right you can't take the spiritual application and apply it physically i've known people even in this message try to do that judge i didn't do it yes you did just admit you do it yes repent make things right in the physical but in god's eyes if if that applies you never did it in the first place praise the lord i'd rather go to jail for a million years and know that in god's eyes i never did it right praise the lord amen so that justifies the same thing justification brings a man into his place of righteousness it annihilates all that sin all that uh unbelief so that it brings you back into the ought to be conditioned yes this god sees you justified freely by his grace no law now through grace through the redemption that is in christ jesus redemption bring us back to where we were in the mind of god we were here we fell but then redemption brings us back to reconciling back to where we should be that's our outfit condition that's the righteousness of god that's the justification of god amen amen that's where a christian lives yes whom god has set forth to be a perpetuation through faith in his blood to declare his righteousness for the remission of sin that are passed through the forbearance of god now perpetuation is just someone who takes your place yes if someone is perpetuating for you it means that they've taken your place amen a proxy if you will they've taken your place jesus christ took our place yes became our perpetuation he became me so i might become him by grace not through the law but by grace yes why not through the law because christ and his sinlessness came and done and didn't do away with the law but brought us beyond the law amen that we might be the righteousness of jesus christ to declare i say at this time his righteousness that he might be just and the justifier of him which believeth in jesus where is boasting then because we didn't do it that's all he did it all praise the lord i just said yes lord just try to be obedient where's boasting it is excluded by what law of words nay but by the law of faith therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law praise the lord it changes our appetite changes our desires it changes what we want in life the thing then is what does it witness to us what is it witness to you it's the lord speaking to our hearts now so what is that witness to you yes that that that word your treasure is in life i don't consider anything in my life i love my son i love my wife i love my daughter my grandchildren my son-in-law i love you all across the country i have friends and brothers and people i love so very dearly but i give every one of you up for him every one of you yes in a heartbeat i wouldn't even think twice right as much as i love you but i only love you because it's in him but i'd drop every one of you and i believe you better do the same thing to me yes and a heartbeat like hot potato as we said in the south for him amen praise the lord because he's number one amen yes number one if he's number one that's going to be your desire that's going to be what your appetite is psalms 42 as the heart pantheth after the water broke soul painteth my soul after thee o god my soul thirsteth for god for the living god when shall i come and appear before god praise the lord good way that david penned it there my soul longest after you yes that song we sang whoever wrote that song inspired by the scripture my soul desires for you lord my soul longeth after you it took the thought of the deer that might have been wounded or shot or something if that deer can get to some water and get some light giving uh uh chemicals in god-given chemicals into his body he can have a chance to live many can stop that bleeding and he can he can live past that see has that heart painted with every heartbeat that that goes by in our lives it draws us closer to him that song that that brother wrote lafontaine and i feel that hole hey man i feel that pull that what's that that pull is just something that's in you that that's that's what your appetite is your appetite is pulling you calling you to him amen and as we see these days going by and we see that time approaching amen he becomes more and more precious more and more paramount all of our lives amen praise the lord jesus let's stand if we could it's what becomes the most important thing in life serving him living for him being here for him doing everything we can to feed our souls with the living god amen praise the lord so the question then becomes what is your appetite what are you feeding on what do you desire to feed on amen do you pick up the bible and think of it as a drudgery that or a law you pick up the bible and say well i've got to read the bible today i'm not considered a christian if that's what it's about friend i'm not going to tell you to put it down but you need something more than just letters on a page amen you need a spirit that comes in because these are just this this is dead letter unless the spirit comes and brings it to life amen do you get into a position of prayer and think well i've got i got to spend this time i got to do this god won't like me anymore or i won't be considered a christian then it's a drudgery at that point it's not a desire amen when it's the desire to do it freely and that's what our whole lives are to him it's free it's it's living in the liberty that is jesus christ because we're dead and our lives are hitting him through christ praise the lord amen let's sing this little chorus and we worship the lord before we go today you know brother brown said the best time to worship is after the word has gone forth god has brought that bomb and soothed over that spirit and and that worship that is here just draws in that much nearer let's worship him now [Music] flow through me holy spirit [Music] me [Music] oh [Music] yes [Music] lord jesus [Music] yes [Music] me [Music] holy spirit flow through me as i lift my hands to worship [Music] [Applause] [Music] holy spirit hallelujah amen see that's a desire amen that's the desire that we do because it's in our hearts it's what we're thirsting for it's what we're longing for it's what we want out of life yes it comes from the depths of our soul because that's where our treasures are amen because he is our treachery yes he is you found that pearl of great price what do you do you lay everything else aside to get it to obtain it to hold it to treasure amen there's no greater pearl of great price i know of in christ in his word amen praise the lord you know friends he's so good to us and serving the lord jesus is the greatest privilege that human has ever had yes and i'm thankful that he put it in my life and the surrender of my life to do that to him to him and to him only amen praise the lord god bless you amen god is good i appreciate each one of you being here being in the house of the lord trust something was said to bless you today amen that our desires continually be to him that our appetite continually to be for you you know your appetite your appetite like i was saying just very quickly your appetite isn't developed because [Music] of your wanting it your appetite develops because your body wants it amen i i've seen a lot of people and i eat kind of slow you all know that right but now i ain't kind of slow i've seen people buying so fast most people eat i guess what you consider normal i'm slow not normal but i've seen people eat so fast and and i think to myself now not being critical but i think that person is just eating to survive that's they're just putting food down their throat to live but i don't need to live i eat because i enjoy it you understand because i want that to be something that's a continual spiritual blessing to me to not eat so fast i've gone through the bible in a year and done those things like people do but i like pouring over that word i like eating it slow like i do physically i guess that's just the nature different natures of different people in that but i thought i think you know they just eat just to have something in their belly but i don't eat for that reason i eat because i enjoy food i eat because it tastes good i don't eat stuff it doesn't taste good to me and maybe it doesn't taste good to me because my body doesn't need it i don't know but i only eat because it tastes good and i take my time eating it i had a good friend i know i ate fat she was in the army he was in the reserves i know why he was he was a lineman and the power company he ate i couldn't have my food salted as fast as he'd have his plate clear he said boy you still got a lot of food there yes and looks like you're i said yeah your plate's empty how are you enjoying your food he said i've ate it already i said so you're not enjoying your food anymore he says no i've already ate it that's why i'm still enjoying mine so eat your heart out i'm still enjoying mine and i guess i'm that way i try to probably like that way a lot spiritually too i just just pour over it amen spiritually pour over it i just take my time and see if there's something in there god is there something in there i need to know see the appetite doesn't come from you it comes from your body it comes from a different source your appetite from god it doesn't come from you it comes from a different source there's god in there it's christ in there that causes that appetite amen praise the lord god bless you love you appreciate

brother and myself i says god's in control amen and we have believers praying for us we're standing on the word and by his grace he pulled us through yes amen praise the lord and he does for different reasons amen we're all different but i want you to notice something and our precious brother charlie just passed but um i want you to notice something that they had a severe covet and a more severe coping but less contagious and then a very much less severe but more contagious that seems like probably what's going on now maybe sister shelia sister matisse katy brothers my family different ones
