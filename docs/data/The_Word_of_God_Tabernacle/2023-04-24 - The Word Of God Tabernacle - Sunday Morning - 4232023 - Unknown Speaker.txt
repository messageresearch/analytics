Lord Jesus I'm so thankful that we can reach out and just touch him amen praise the Lord doesn't take some great big blown up thing all we just do is just Reach Out And Touch him he's available all the time anytime amen praise the Lord Jesus I have a request here from Sister Shelia she had mentioned earlier in this week that we please pray for sister Joy hakami several physical healing needs she has because she's an excruciating pain and so let's say sister Joy's been dealing with this for quite some time now I know that I still keep where I've been meaning to ask you how she was because I pray for all the time and uh regularly and I I just kept every time I pray for her um I kept thinking well I need to ask and see how she's doing and I keep forgetting so thank you for that sister Sheila is we do need to remember Sister joy in prayer if we could amen also brother Danny put a prayer request he said I've been going through the last couple of weeks of tenants washing their clothes at early morning hours four or five A.M and not being courteous or considerate to the people that live by the laundry room prayers that this will stop and manage will start being more involved in incidents reported amen so I certainly understand that brother it's tough you've got as much commotion going on I'm kind of a light sleeper myself but just not always a good thing because when I go on trips and stuff I have a lot of times air conditioners I'll have a constant fan that just run all night but all but all it does is dry me out so it's kind of a catch-22 so you stay away from all the commotion going around or uh because you can't breathe it's one way or the other so brother Danny for that need of prayer this morning also amen sister Norma wrote a praise report here but it also kind of has a prayer request so if it's you're okay with you I'm going to read it um the praise report was thank God for prayers for Kathy who we pray for the other day all went well with her colonoscopy but she says that she has an infection in her stomach so they took a biopsy of that infected so let's remember her sister Kathy still in prayer and amen the Lord would just bless her and touch her so I'm thankful for the prayer for the praise report thankful God was Mindful and blessed her through that colonoscopy but we certainly want to remember that need in prayer for the infection in her stomach as well so amen does anyone have an unspoken request on your heart we all have needs desires and a heartless stand to our feet if we could and then we'll take these thieves to the Lord in prayer brother Dennis if you would fall asleep let's pray together Lord Jesus who comes for you with burdens on our heart and we know we serve a God that's mindful of all our needs and Lord I had it in my heart as our pastor already mentioned there was a lady that had a blood issue for 12 years and Lord she spent all her money to go to the doctor oh my mind they couldn't do anything for her father but then she heard about a man Dr Jesus yes and she heard the testimonies that people were just touching His Garment Hallelujah and Lord she rushed through the crowd cause she heard that Jesus was gonna be there and she ran to Jesus and was able to Touch the Hem of His Garden amen yes and our Lord turned around and said who touched me and the disciples were confused because everybody was touching him but they asked the Lord everyone is touching you he says no but virtue has left me yes and he looked he knew who touched him yes he looked right at her amen sister your faith has made you whole thank you Jesus and father let there be a testimony in our hearts Let It Be Lord today Lord yes our faith in your promises our faith in your word [Music] leave us forsaken Lord that same faith that we reach out even now for them that need a healing touch amen Lord that once are sick Kathy and and different ones that need our healing time yes may they reach out father for you're the same yesterday today and forever Lord your power has not weakened it's still the same yes Lord when we reach out for each amen for that healing bless you want you to know for thou art truly are yes Father Hallelujah by the feelings of our infirmities thank you with your strength we are healed and I can recall the promising the sickest body on the face of this Earth is a spiritual body Jesus Christ we can see fathers this year the time of your second coming approaches near and near there's less people coming to church there's less people being concerned with their walk with you they're more involved with the things of the world to see what they can get and how they can be more accomplished than to be more dedicated and consecrated in serving you help us fathers and following obedience to your word for we know that obedience is better to sacrifice even your Prophet taught us full obedience to the whole word of God's entitles you to the Token to father if we don't have it it's time to cry out Lord fill me with your Holy Spirit get me out of the way Lord you must be first you must have the preeminence you will have a bride yes be so out of the way and they will see Jesus only and father all the unspoken prayer requests may you touch each and every heart as they're reaching out as well father yes all dreams their hearts desire oh Lord help us to draw closer to you Lords help us to read Walk in the light as you are the light to Heaven Fellowship one with another for the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us from all our sins and Lord bless our pastors who bring forth your word may your word just help us become better Christians yes may your word fall on good ground in our hearts and that truly they'll uh see the testimony not of ourselves we false short daily but they'll seek Jesus Christ yes Lord hallelujah Lord in your name we pray name the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen amen praise the Lord you can be seated if you'd like sister Matisse handed me a note here she has a testimony so sister Matisse if you'd like to go ahead and give your testimony okay um foreign in the days of the flood and that Noah was the only one who was left pure in his generation of the floods and it struck me how how that we that Faith had answered the hearts of eight people not one eight people so think about that and they all gone on the boat and they were all saved and I just realized that people want to look at one another as all they're they're hybrid or this racism and and all this you know difference and I God just blessed me with that so much just they just got on the boat yes amen praise the Lord there's a light boat today man praise the Lord Jesus looking for the Rapture does anyone else have a testimony on your heart yes for the dentist yes um this is the Lord once again uh protecting me as one of his children and it's just Supernatural I was going down on Broadway heading west about to cross uh Harrison and that car let off I thought you know they're going to be turning left but they didn't stop they kept going and I had my little daughter who's going to take him and get his nails trimmed in and I sold the spunky hold on and I swerved my truck and I says Lord just see us through this accident I didn't hear anything so I parked my truck on Broadway and I got out I didn't see anything Lord your Angels were protecting me but because we are carnal I pulled off on by Sonic and I checked again so from there on as I was taking my dog to get his nails to him I was praising the Lord amen that was Supernatural yes because I saw we were going to get hit yes but God who's rich amen amen yes praise the Lord I remember that testimony in North Carolina the money cuts I knew my wife that my son would remember same thing happened going across the intersection coming and it was crying out to the Lord and nothing happened and I looked over there and said did that car just go through US yes take support yes I think it's been about a month after you had whether you had a little precious adult friend and he mentioned if anybody have heart problems to help us yes Sunday morning I try to start the car here so I was frustrated as well to make a word about it and he prayed that yeah started amen praise the Lord there's one thing I know he has Faith yes amen Joel and them are both I know I can testify those little they have faith amen praise the Lord but that's scriptural isn't it yeah faith is a little child yeah praise the Lord anyone else amen let's sing one more song before we uh change over the service now song number oh I've got here 237 came in 237 we'll have it on the screen here and let's start with the course I don't seem to sound very open uh very often so it'll be with it you probably all know it amen Micah can you help me too amen so we'll try to sing This Together have a little talk with Jesus amen praise the Lord let us have a little talk when Jesus let him tell us all about our troubles we'll hear our famous cry he will answer by Empire [Music] [Music] through it all the fire is burning you have a little talk with Jesus [Music] [Music] Christ [Music] [Music] now let us tell them all about our troubles burning [Music] [Music] tell them all about our trouble we will hear our pain is [Music] [Music] amen just a little talk with Jesus praise the Lord amen makes it right thank you Lord I was intended to sing the verses of that but I don't think I even got the course not right so if you can't get the course right down to that as well as always sounds better in my head amen but the truth of the sir the truth of the song is still the same amen just have a little talk with Jesus praise the Lord it doesn't take much it doesn't take a a great big blown out thing just a little talk with him amen praise the lord it's amazing how sometimes we'll get to the place that we've talked to one another and talk to our children or we talk to other people and and a certain way and uh and we we talk a certain way to our children and we talk a certain way to our grandchildren we talk a certain way to our brothers and sisters we talk a certain way to just people on the street or people at work or something but you know when we get to talking to Jesus it's like we gotta change everything and make it some great big blown out thing it doesn't have to be just yes amen just a conversation just to talk with him he's listening the Bible says his ear is turned to The Cry of the righteous so we listen all right he listens amen and we speak to him amen praise the Lord let's stand to our feet if we could we'll go ahead and change the order of the service now amen praise the Lord Jesus glad to see each one this morning amen I want to go begin in our in the scripture in Genesis chapter 2. amen I had to given this several years ago and as uh the thought came on my heart the other day uh it reminisced me back to this and I felt like the Lord just impressed me to try to bring this again it's been six seven years ago or so amen but I want to start in Genesis chapter 2 read a couple of verses of scripture there before we let you be seated Genesis chapter 2. we'll begin with the 15th verse and but before we do let's just bow our heads for another word of prayer if you could Lord Jesus father we're very grateful and thankful for this beautiful day that you've given us for a day Lord another Resurrection Day I know Easter is passed Lord but this is still to us that Resurrection Day the day when you Rose from the grave Lord and you showed that you were more than just a God that people worship or Idols or or stone metal wood Lord you are the you are the almighty omnipotent all-knowing all-powerful God that Rose from the grave Lord and come back again into the believer to prove even in this day that you are the same yesterday today and forever Lord bless us in this service may you have your way in this today God as we commit it to you our prayers have gone up before you our desires our worship our our our songs from our heart Lord to glorify you to praise you Lord and expect you to receive God that is a sweet smelling savior now Lord again we approach this most sacred part of our service as it is every time lord your precious word I pray that you would speak this word to our hearts Lord that you would show us in here where we need to be what we need to do Lord and help us to draw closer to you more like you in this last day Lord we need you father in a special way God for this world and God I just don't know any other way to put it I mean uh brother Branham said it many times years ago and Satan's eaten but Lord It's just you look around and see they just they just completely lost their minds the world's just completely lost their minds yes the the affection for one another and the love and the desire and Lord the the the love Is Just God it's just it is sad to see but Lord we know that you've given us something Lord and to stand true to Stand Tall to stand right according to your Word of Faith Lord to believe this holy writ God that you've given us that you put before us this message that you spoke to us Lord through our precious Prophet Lord may your Holy Spirit now take full control of this service as we committed to you we rebuke every demonic Spirit who would try to hurt hinder and filtrate this service in any way in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Lord that you would have complete control and that all things would be done for your glory and honor now may Lord you God have your preeminence here that whatever your purpose is for this service today would be accomplished as we committed to you asked your blessings on it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen praise the Lord Genesis chapter 2 we're going to begin reading with verse 15. amen I had a rough week this week pretty tired feel good now of course under the anointing God is just always a real blessing but this was I think I've mentioned before we did a week one this week up in Colorado Springs and it was uh been in about 70 hours it was a pretty rough week hard pretty hard work so but thankful God it's blessed us amen and uh thankful for good flights and bringing me back home and being here with you today so I'm very thankful God's blessings now Genesis chapter 2 uh we'll read verses 15 16 and 17 and we'll let you be seated and the Lord God took the man put him into the Garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it the Lord God commanded the man saying of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat but of the tree of the the tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil Thou shalt not eat of it for in the day that thou eat us thereof Thou shalt surely die and you can be seated if you like now we do know and realize and as the scripture has told us and that brother Randolph reminded us many times of that death doesn't necessarily and doesn't uh and our vernacular is a multi multifaceted word it doesn't just mean that breath has left your physical body in fact brother random talked about when it mentions death in the scripture it's talking about a spiritual death amenities you know that when Adam and Eve cross over that line that God told him not to or they would die they did not die physically they still lived after that point in time but the spiritual death so what happened was God that through through the Disobedience of man a great Chasm was thrown between God and man so the fellowship that Adam had that God had with Adam that he came down and cool of the afternoon every day and spoke to Adam was broken the separation happened right there When sin came in the camp and it was no longer the way it used to be God and man were separated supposedly and uh and assumedly forever that God would never man would never be reconciled back to God the same way that it was with Adam when Adam and Eve at that day before the fall now let's read Genesis chapter 3 go a page over Genesis chapter 3 where we begin reading with verse 17. continue on with this story now Genesis 3 17. and unto Adam he said because thou has hearkened unto the voice of thy wife and has eaten of the tree of which I commanded thee saying thou shall not eat of it now again remember which I have said in the past this was not something that was in the woman's curse this was not something that God said to Eve why because God did not tell Eve what he just said here that you should not eat of the tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil he did not tell you that he told Adam that so it wasn't in Eve's curse it was only in Adams because only to Adam did God give those instructions now Eve's instructions came from her head Adam amen she learned of it she knew of it she knew she shouldn't have done it based on what Adam told her was what which is what God Said So when Adam spoke that word to Eve it was just as God was standing there telling her amen so that I say that because that brings us in light of understanding that just because an individual just because a person a human relays something or speak something it helps us understand how when brother Brown says that this bride becomes the voice of God how does she become the voice of God when she's speaking God's word when she is speaking God's word it is if though God is speaking to that person amen it doesn't water it down now it does if the person doesn't relay God's word the way the word says if they interject their own thoughts or opinions or something into it then it's not God speaking but if it's per a person and I'm not talking about just a minister I'm not talking about just a pastor preacher I'm talking about anybody anybody that's why the bride amen is the final voice to the final age it didn't say brother Branham was the final voice to the final age it didn't say the pastors or preachers it said the bride brother Adam said through God speaking the bride is the final voice to the final age how because she only speaks God's word she speaks when he speaks and she is silent when he is silent praise the Lord and when she speaks she speaks only God's word so when she speaks God's word it is if God is speaking when Adam was speaking to Eve it was God telling Eve through Adam you shall not do this praise the Lord so she knew it but she did it but the curse now was to Adam and being her head it was his responsibility let's follow let's go through now cursed is the ground for thy sake and sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life thorns and thistle shall it bring forth to thee and thou shalt eat the herb of the field thanks Adam appreciate it had a hard week this week the sweat of my brow appreciate it a lot been nice but it's just still been in that Garden right praise the Lord appreciate it uh uh dad that was as a rough week but anyway um in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread till thou return unto the ground for out of it was thou taken for dust Thou Art and unto dust shalt thou return now notice that was never something that God told Adam until the fall even though he was taken from the Dust that was never part of the conversation until after the fall that he would return back to the dust from which he came denoting eternal life helping us know that from the very beginning here in the Garden of Eden when God took from the dust and made Adam it's spoke of eternal life because there was no back to the Dust but now after the curse after the fall there was a falling in of man into the dust again and Adam called his wife's name Eve because she is the mother of all living now now the woman now has a name right amen did not have a name up to this point but now she has a name why because she is the mother of all living not Adam the father of all living but he the mother of all living and aren't you Adam also and to his wife did the Lord God make coats of skin and clothe them and the Lord God said behold the man is become as one of us to know good and evil and now lest he put forth his hand and take also of the tree of life and eat and live forever therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the Garden of Eden sent him away to till the ground from when she was taken so he God drove out the man and he placed at the east of the Garden of Eden cherubimes with a flaming sword which turned every way to keep the way of the tree of life now as we see that God has taken and pushed man ejected or uh uh pushed man out of the Garden of Eden took him out of the Garden of Eden and told him that he from from that time that he would return to the dust from that time God would no longer come and meet with them Fellowship speak lip to ear that it would no longer be that way now sin through that great Chasm between God and man sin did it Sin Sin dug a huge Grand Canyon between God and man wider than the Grand Canyon so why it was felt to be un uh untraversed there was no way to get from point A to point B there was no way for a man and God to be reconciled again but God this separation and this Chasm caused her where the access that man had to God was gone God began to speak to man and limit that access to begin to start a little bit of a a way where there could be substitutes made uh substitutes me that that would that would be a point see because when God uh it was never the way it was before the fall but God started right here in the 21st verse by making a way for man and God to have some sort of relationship never like it was there's still there's still chasms that Chasm is still there it's about to make some sort of a Reconciliation some sort of a bringing back together again God took those sheep and slew the Sheep took the lives of innocent animals and through the shinskin and for Adam and Eve to put on so that they could come out from their hiding into God's presence again but they there was a separation before there was no separation before the fall but now there's a separation man now has a covering man now has something that is shielding them from God Amen as much as that Chasm was thrown of sin God started right here to make a way in the slightest way a substitute that would allow man and God to have some sort of a relationship never was again like it was right it couldn't be because God said the day you eat thereof that's the day you're gonna die that's the day that me and you are separated here Adam amen and they still work now notice when when when Adam fell there was a separation brought between God and man so what did Adam do Adam being the amateur god of the Earth being God's spoken word Adam knew so he did what when he heard God he created a buffer between him and God he went into the bushes he hid from God of course he you can't hide from God the Bible says he hid he can't hide you know that uh but that but but Adam knew enough to put a buffer between him and God so he he got in the bushes he hid in the bushy him and he hid in the bushes to create a barrier but then when God came down and he said where are you well God knew exactly where they were but God's talking to Adam saying Adam where are you do you know where you are Adam do you realize what has happened see God people people would have an old Dopey Grandpa like God that's walking around saying where is Adam I can't find Adam God knew exactly where Adam was he's God he's omnipotent he's all-knowing there is no way Adam could get out of a into a place where God God couldn't find him nor can any of you none of us can ever get to a place to worship well I'm gonna hide this from God no you're not you can't it's impossible it was impossible for Adam to hide from him but he got and and Adam knew that and again I'm not trying to change the word Saints but when it when it says hid uh Adam Adam knew he wasn't hiding from God Adam knew there was no way he could hide from the almighty omnipotent all-knowing he knew he couldn't but what he did is he got in the bushes and created a buffer he created a separation a place that that it could not be the way it was before when Adam came down when God used to come before and they came together man they had fellowship and lived to era and talked and enjoyed each other's company in the cool of the day but now it was different and Adam knew it so he he hid in the bushes or he got in the bushes he said God I know I'm here I know what happened I'm so sorry Adam I told you not to do this I know the wife she gave me said this and tempted me with it and and and and I fell by it and he did because he knew if he hadn't God would have destroyed her and he loved her she was bone of his bone flesh of his flesh life of his life right and he didn't want to see her get destroyed so he was willing to become sin so that God would not destroy her because he knew that he wouldn't destroy Adam because he was his son right he wasn't going to destroy Adam but there was a separation there but now since the two had become one Adam and Eve had become one even one flesh amen as it was flesh of Flesh bone of Bones as Adam said when there was one flesh then God couldn't destroy her without destroying him right amen so he they hide in the bushes the curses come he cursed even he cursed at him and he cursed to Cursed the ground excuse me not Adam they cursed the ground and and the whole time there's this buffer between God and man there's this buffer and then all of a sudden God takes it upon himself to take some animal life innocent animal life which was a substitute of what their relationship was Prior their relationship was pure and righteous and holy now sin had entered in so there had to be something that could be a substitute that God would accept so that Adam and Eve could again uh speak to God so that there could still be uh some sort of a relationship nothing like it was because there's that great Chasm no more could he come down did he come down in the cool of the day and all the relationship they had it was all different but God took those sheets in and throw them into the bushes notice Adam and Eve it doesn't say Adam and Eve came out from the bushes into God's presence and put them on no God threw them into the bushes and they put on that barrier before they could come out of the bushes so once the bush separated them now the now the sheepskin separated them amen even though they were right there if there was a separation there was a barrier amen it couldn't be the way it was and God from there of course speaking of Jesus Christ obviously if you can't read the first three chapters of Genesis and see Jesus Christ all over the word then I challenge you to go read it again yes and read it until you find Jesus in there over and over and over and over amen this being one of those places yes amen this being one of those places and when God did when God ejected Adam out of the Garden of Eden God continually from that time begin to make laws and rules and and and and and substitutes and so uh animals became change substitutes and and and animal life and the sacrifice and the blood and all the specifics that God was very very specific about now let me interject here for just a moment in my humble opinion I don't believe that God made each of these rules and regulations so strenuous that man couldn't do them right no he did not he they could follow them and they did follow them evangela became a stink in God's notes he did not make him to where they couldn't follow them but God is always continually it's like tithe and offering God is always challenging us to obedience yeah yes are we going to obey his word not just part of his word but all of his word and everything that God gave them there was a purpose and a reason and it spoke forward as a type and Shadow to Jesus Christ in the New Testament amen it all spoke forward but what it was was an obedience are you going to do this and this and this and leave this off and not do this part see God didn't do it just uh superficially he did it for a reason right right everything God does for a reason again it's like taught in an offering God doesn't need your money right God owns it all he doesn't need a dime of your money but it's not our money it's his yes it's his that he gives to us showing that we could be good good stewards of what God has blessed us with it's just an act of obedience that's all it is Saints God didn't need this the way it was God didn't need it so specific and the high Freaks and the garments and the threads and the Tabernacle he didn't need it to be that way but he's testing their obedience all the way testing their obedience are they going to do what I tell them to do to down to the very thread are they going to do it the way I tell them to do it amen God is continually doing that substituting trying to see because there's nothing that can bring that Chasm remember in Revelation chapter 5 John looked around down through the animals of history no doubt that God revealing by Supernatural Vision maybe that he looked down through the animals of time even to the Garden of Eden with Adam and Eve and said there was nobody working there was no man worthy to take this book and to loose these seals nobody could bridge that Chasm no m-a-n no human no person had the ability the right to take that book much less open it nobody and so John began to web he wept because his name was in that book and he knew if there wasn't someone to come forward that could loose those seals to open that book and to reveal that Redemption that all of humanity was lost down to Adam and Eve all of humanity would have been lost right and he knew it so he began to weep there was no way back no way back the substitutes that God made the animal life the the botany life the the blood uh the high priests all that God did and going into the holies of holies and and and and making that substitution making those restitutions from the people it was only a substitute there was no way John looked down he saw William Branham no he's not good enough looked down he saw the Great Men of this day and uh name whoever you want we can call out the ones that brother Ram said The Messengers of their day uh like Luther and Wesley and and Martin and and all down to to even to Paul looked down to Paul and say nope he's not worthy either look down through the animals of time into uh to to to Jacob and and Esau and and who all the way down all the Great Men Moses and and and all the great men that God had down to Noah and even to the Garden of Eden and there was no man nobody was Worthy to be able to take finally a lamb stepped forth amen somebody cried John look the Lamb of God to take away this [Music] amen step fourth fourth of bloody lamb to take that Redemption amen and was able had the ability to be able to redeem men back to bridge that Chasm that man Jesus Christ throw his own blood was able to bridge that sin chasm do where God and man could come back into relation and fellowship like they did in the Garden of Eden amen back to the place that it once was man's still in the Fallen condition now so it's not exactly the same not physically but the relationship that God and man now have to be able to speak lip to ear to be able to access God at any time to be able to speak to him to know that he hears you to know that he is always there amen if you want to try to get a hold of the president United States good luck amen personally I like to talk to him a while he might not hear what I got to say but I like talk to him in fact I don't know if a president of life is probably would have liked to talk to me but Democrat Republican I couldn't care less amen because my only interest is getting into Jesus Christ but you can't you good luck try to talk Donald Trump good luck amen try to talk to these dignitaries of the world good luck try to talk to these billionaires millionaires good luck I used to have one I drove I used to have rich people in the car worst tippers ever people got tons of money worse people to tip ever yeah you're getting the perfect ride perfect uh Place everything perfect conversation nicely we're good and on give you a dime I picked I picked a woman up one time in a cardboard box she gave me a 20 tip that's the truth friends now it wasn't quite a cardboard box it was just pretty it's pretty tore down Shanty though it wasn't much to look at I took her to the I took her to the bus station not the airport the bus station she gave me 20 tip I took two lawyers one time from the airport to the Ventana Canyon I think they gave me a dollar or something or no tip at all I can't remember it was nothing these people were talking about spending 200 for a tea time a piece for four of them got nothing amen but that's just the way it is you try to get in company of those people they don't want to talk to you right right you're too far down uh on on the on the class scale you're not good enough to talk to them you know even back in the day when people got rich and they would get into the company of rich people they would still looked down on them they called them new money I mean good luck talking to people like that but Jesus Christ he talked to at any moment in time amen and he will listen he will welcome you he will invite you to come in and he wants us to talk to him he wants us to have Fellowship we went through all of he went through all of that all that he went through in life and being despised and no Beauty we could look on him to desire him and and being scourged and beat and dying and uh and hanging on a cross and and naked shade he had nothing so we could have access to him now that sand castle that was thrown down has had a bloody bridge bridge to cross from God to man so that God and man could come what did Brother Ram say and embrace one another I think he even said it one time to kiss one another God and man again in Fellowship oh praise the Lord amen friend we have that ability but and the opportunity but do we take it do we take advantage of it it seems like the mindset has got to be if I'm not in a specific closet or I'm not alone or or I don't have hours to speak to him then you know I just won't just wake up in the morning and talk to him for a minute and thank you pray over your meal or anything you can do just to speak to God yes look at the prayers that Jesus had when he was here he'll be in the middle of a throne to be able to say father I thank you it's been a minute and a half talking to the Lord that was it amen amen but how effective was it how much did it mean praise the lord we have that access today and don't seem to want to take advantage of it not like we should and God help me I pray and tell you God help me I wanted to be the focal point of my mind the focal point of my life no matter what I'm doing no matter what's going on in my life amen Romans chapter 8 let's read a few things we'll uh to solidify this is you know very well but amen before we close today Romans chapter 8. is calm let's bridge that Gap that Bloody bridge now from man to God has been created cross over to come back together again that blood that atonement that payment for our wrongdoing has happened now Romans 8 1 says there is therefore now right I've told you many times Jose I love that yeah the scripture says there is therefore now now is a Perpetual word now is never in the past now is never in the present or in the future it is always in the present it is always right now praise God which means that by the time you can say now another now is here to take its place right there is therefore now that cover now yes yeah does it cover now yes does it cover now now now now it never Fades away it is a Perpetual saying and existence of now is now is now there is no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus right now do you mean tomorrow well will there be a now tomorrow will there be a now in five seconds will there be a now at an hour will there be a now tonight whether it be a now when you're asleep will there be a now when you wake up amen there's always now because now it's perpetual it all it is ever existing there is therefore now you under it doesn't go past it doesn't go future it's always here there's therefore now no condemnation praise God them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit that's spirit bridge that Bloody yeah that that Bloody bridge that bridge that Gap that sin Gap that brought God and man back together again oh Hallelujah aren't you thankful Saints come to be reconciled again amen not a substitute not a bull or a goat or or a red heifer all the things that they talk about no no high priest I don't need anybody amen we do ask one another all of us to pray for one another that's scripture but I don't need anybody to go into that holies of holies for me amen I go in it myself used to be there was a time in that day that if you just walked into that holies of holies you dropped dead it was Scout can anybody win that holies of police but today is death not to amen praise God yes you don't need a high priest you don't need me you don't need you don't need your spouse or you can walk right into that holiest of holies and speak to God and have access to God God hears yeah you might not hear an audible voice but you know by faith that he's listening you know by his word that he's listening amen because he promised I believe it was through uh David his ear is turned to The Cry of the righteous he's listening he is perpetually listening wanting to have Fellowship talk with communion with each one of us that's the real communion actually amen the bread the wine that's lots of representation but our True Fellowship our true communion is that that we speak to him talking and together amen not just a one-way conversation but together live to ear for the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus had made me free from the law of sin and death praise the Lord for what the law could not do and that it was weak through the flesh God sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh didn't say it was simple it was in the likeness of simple pleasure and for sin condemn sin in the flesh now if his flesh had been a sinful flesh he could not have accomplished that but because he was only and merely in the likeness of sinful flesh he could take our sin amen that the righteousness of the law the righteousness of the law amen might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit the life amen the light that's there the life of God that's always what we're looking for amen that life am I without the life it's not alive you're not care who they say they all don't care what denomination preach or anything else there's no life there if there's no God like it's it's dead there's no life the only life there is is when the life of Jesus Christ comes that's the only life that there is life amen the true life first John chapter 5 chapter one amen first John first John chapter one uh chapter 1 verse 5. this then is the message which we have received which we have heard of him and declare unto you that God is light and in him is no Darkness at all if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have Fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanses us for all sin sin is what unbelief it cleanses us from all unbelief which tells us what that we by faith believe that he's there that he is God and that we're speaking to him and that he hears us and that even if there's not an audible response we know he's listening amen amen that's why we have prayer requests that's why we say the things we say and do and have prayer in God's listening God's always listening amen cleanses us from all sin if we say that we have no sin we deceive ourselves untruth it's not in us see that's the difference even at the same time that that sin can be present that bridge is still gapped the or that Chasm is still gapped by the bridge even at the same time because it said if we say we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us if we confess our sins he is faithful and just forgive us for our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness praise the Lord what does that do that places Us in his position amen well rightfully so because he took our position if Jesus took our place then we by the scripture rightfully are to take his place that's what he told us when he takes away all unrighteousness well if all unrighteousness is God what does that make you righteous what's the opposite of unrighteous righteous well if he's taken away all unrighteousness what does that make you righteous in Christ Jesus not of your own abilities not of your own doing not of your own uh abilities but by Jesus Christ is robed you now with his righteousness yes praise the Lord because he's taken all of that away all of the unrighteousness if we say that we have not sinned we make him a liar and his word is not in US but that's that has placed Us in the position as he took our place to take his that places Us in that position of sonship amen with Jesus Christ now people want to talk about a different operations of gifts uh people want to try to elevate brother around to a certain place he had a different gift friend but in the sonship of Jesus Christ we are all the same yes Amen in the sonship of Jesus Christ we are all the same it did not take more blood to save me than it did to say brother random right it did not take more blood to save me than anybody else or more blood to save you than anybody else because we're all the same amen unrighteousness disbelief sin is it is all the same amen now there's different applications just like there's different offices brother Adam held a different office absolutely amen telling a little white lie it's still unbelief but do we equate it in this life the same as a murderer well no we don't but the same blood alleviates it all yes Kansas all unrighteousness now she has become him because he took my place so I could take him he's rode me in his righteousness now I have the ability the the opportunity the privilege of speaking to him amen amen all the time Paul said pray without ceasing well what is prayer and people want to make prayer of different things to me you you prayer can be what you want we went through a three or four or five series part part series about prayer but it can be whatever you want it to mean for him because prayer is a very personal thing you can make it what you want to I've heard people say well you shouldn't pray like that if you're talking to the Lord Jesus God Of Heaven and Earth and that is the way you and him communicate I'm not here to judge that right right I'm not here to uh to criticize you for that if you want to this and thousand days that's fine just talk to him that's all he's looking for just to talk to him just the fellowship communion with him I wasn't here to tell anybody this is why this is how you do it now someone that's just a ranked Center and doesn't know how you know it's a or what to say uh the sinner's prayer then I understand that but after a person you get to the place you just talk to God yes you just talk to him just like he's your brother yeah just like he's your uh your your best buddy amen you just talk to him say God it doesn't have to be eloquent I when I pray sin it Saints I'm not looking for your approval I'm not looking to get some big trophy that says best prayer on Sunday morning I'm not looking to get some metal that says that you know top-notch prayer we we rank this man as the top 10 prayer in the world today I don't care anything about that as long as I'm talking to him yes and we're fellowshipping that's all I care about and I'm telling you that's all he cares about and then that should be all that you care about just to talk to him you don't have to pray in service to impress one another right amen you're not you're not here to try to find the right words that other people would approve up or something you just talk to him yes you know and and it just something simple yeah amen something simple it doesn't have to be blown out but God hears amen God hears and God responds amen let's go back over to Romans real quick Romans chapter 5 this time Romans chapter 5 for read uh beginning with verse one amen let's look at this man was falling man man was in the following conditions Saints and we know that and I I reckon I guess the whole point of my um my message today is that we have full access to God full unfettered access to God yes we do at any time any millisecond of your life at any time of the day in any part of the world even if you're on the International Space Station if you're in the middle of a rocket going through space if you're on an airplane doesn't matter any millisecond of your life you can reach God yes we have that kind of unfettered access to him yes my whole point is to take advantage take advantage of and don't do it to where like brother random said well the boy in the prayer book he said I just thought of the prayer book in the garbage but or I think he said fire actually but but it's not that God do this do this do this and like we're praying or asking to change God's mind in fact that's very dangerous yes you don't believe me ask Hezekiah yeah you can't but one day you will how'd that go with you we don't want him to change his mind I don't want God to change his mind even if I could do it I don't want him to change his mind yeah because this is perfect and everything that he that says and does for me is going to be the best thing that could ever happen in my life and I know that again back to Faith back to faith believing so I don't want to change his mind but Lord let my let my will crumble to where your will becomes my will amen praise the Lord Romans chapter 5 verse one therefore being justified by faith and what is justification as if it would never happen in the first place amen beautiful isn't it it's the blood of Jesus Christ justify by faith we have we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ by whom also we have access amen by faith into his grace wherein we stand and rejoice in Hope of the glory of God and not only so but we glory in tribulations also knowing that tribulations work as patients and patience experience and experience hope and hope make it not a shame because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us for when we were yet without Strength In Due Time Christ died for the ungodly first scarcely for a righteous man will one die for it yet for adventure for a good man some would even Dare To Die but God oh yes but but God commended his love toward us in that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us praise the lord well it had to be that way obviously because if he waited for us to no longer be Sinners to come and die we wouldn't have needed him to come and die because we would no longer been Sinners right right amen he came and died so that we would no longer be Setters right right the only way that he could have come and died is if we were still in a sinful condition right praise the Lord he died for us much more than being now justified by his blood we shall be saved from the Wrath through him for if if when we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his son much more being reconciled we shall be saved by his life now what is that reconciling mean that reconciling means that were brought back amen brought back to him through that atonement the atonement is something that pays the price for something to make an atonement to make a restitution for amen which they keep talking about today in San Francisco and for slavery and stuff they want to they want to give millions of dollars for restitution or reparations to try to make up for what happened 300 200 years ago see high five I said well why stop there once you go back to anyway that's a whole different Summit but that's that's making an atonement that's a Tony for wrongdoing and what price could be paid to atone for my wrong doing so that I could come back to fellowship with God again only way is by God's approved sacrifice and that was by his only son Jesus Christ that was the only way it couldn't be through the blood of bulls the goats he had done thousands and tens and hundreds of thousands of animals died all through the Old Testament never one time did it ever bring him any closer to God but it it was acceptable by them to God because it was by obedience it was obedience to God that they did it amen until it became again Isaiah talked about it becoming a stink in God's nostrils because then it just became a formality and it does the same thing today if we come to church just because it's Sunday morning 10 30. oh I gotta go to church now uh that's the wrong attitude Saints yes it is amen if you wake up and say praise God there's church today that's different there's that desire that pull that Micah started our whole service out today that oh that pulls us that desire that pulls us that that that motivates us it's God it's God's motivating us to him praise the Lord amen being reconciled now brought back now that reconcile the atonement paid the price the reconciliation brought us back because that what so reconcile means when two people were separated and argument whatever it is spouse children family friends people fight people argue there's contention but when you reconcile you come back together again no more chasm there's no more disagreement or the disagreement has been bridged you understand between two people they separate because of disagreement because of fight or whatever it is there's something from between those two people that now separates them but there's got to be something happen that either bridges that Gap amen whether it's love or or understanding or or forgiveness or whatever it is something's got to bridge that Gap amen I best thing I know is forgiveness love and forgiveness bridges that Gap who love and forgiveness Bridge any Gap if it's the right kind of love or the gap's just gone you say well you know I see it the way you do now brother I I understand it I see it I agree that's the way it should be that's and you're in full agreement then there's no more Gap amen amen but love and forgiveness even if there is a gap between brother and sister whatever it is even if there is a gap you can bridge that Gap with love and understanding forgiveness Amen to bring back together again that's how you reconcile even well that's what Jesus Christ did for us Saints amen as long as this world is going that that Chasm will continue to exist because if it no longer existed then everybody would be saved there would be no gap between God and man every human would be safe but not every human can be saved narrow is the way that leads that's that bridge that's that Bloody bridge that takes you from where you are where you were hopefully uh to Jesus Christ again to me to reconcile to bring it back together again I believe in and recep God forgive me so love forgiveness and understanding bridges that gap between God and man praise the Lord now we can reconcile again to Jesus we can reconcile back again to God and have the same relationship to have the same relationship now again it's not going to be exactly like Adam because there's sin still here we're still in sin trapped in these sin bodies but any moment at any time God leads you God guides you God directs you he said he'd never leave you or forsake you he is always with you you speak to him you talk to him you fellowship with him amen he's always there he's always listening that access is full and unfettered since being reconciled we shall be saved by his life and not only so but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ by whom we now have received the atonement amen receive that atonement the price has been paid Jesus Christ paid that price at Calvary to redeem us back to him amen Hebrews uh you can go read Ephesians chapter 2 I was going to read Ephesians chapter 2 we'll skip that amen you go back and read this Jesus we are once Ephesians chapter 2 is one of my favorite chapters in the Bible I really enjoy Ephesians one and two for two is one's how do you pick one or the other I like I really enjoy Roman uh Ephesians chapter 2. we are once lost in and dead in our sin but now after the reconciliation through the atonement of his blood we've been brought back to now we are dead to sin amen amen because when we joined ourselves back with Jesus Christ the sin is now gone the death that the unbelief is now gone amen from us to God remember we're separating the physical from the spiritual physically you're still alive absolutely physically you're not dead no but spiritually it's been brought back and now in us there's no more sin there's no more doubt there's no more unbelief remember we've went through this first John chapter 3 amen when that seed remaineth in there there's no more uh there's no more sin can no more be sin do we still do things wrong makes sakes absolutely but in here there's no more sin God's living in there God if God were in there with sin then God is a sinner but he can the only reason that we in the can exist on this planet is because we're in these bodies that's the only way that's why when these bodies give away our spirit we're we're gone our soul is with God Amen because it was him to begin with that's how we're eternal is it's God to begin with it's his attribute praise God once we were dead in sin now we're dead too sins and trespasses they'd have no more relationship with us you know when people say oh he's dead to me sin is dead to me amen we are separated Hebrews four let me close with this Hebrews 4 chapter chapter 4 verse 14. seeing then that we have a great high priest that is passed into the heavens Jesus the son of God let us hold fast our profession don't wait for them hold fast to that profession I profess I am a Christian I profess I believe Jesus Christ to be the Son of God and My Savior My Lord my God hold to that profession amen don't let Satan take it from you for we for we have not an high priest which cannot be touched by the feeling of our infirmities which again the double negative means he is a high priest that you can touch right amen I like I hear people say I can't do nothing well you know what that means you can do something because can't do nothing means well if you can't do nothing that means you can do something right they say I can't do nothing well that just means you can do something then because the double negative cancels itself and makes it a positive no praise the Lord let's see even when Satan tries to do that God turns it around makes it for his good amen he can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities but was in all points tempted like as we are yet without sin Let Us therefore come boldly boldly unto the throne of grace now you got to know who you are to come to the throne of God boldly yes amen you just thought aroused about coming to the throne of God boldly if you do you're just you just want to die you're just a crazy person but you've got to know who you are to come boldly Before the Throne of God Amen the throne of grace that he may obtain mercy and find Grace to help in the time of need praise the Lord Jesus said you'd draw nine to me and I'll draw on to you and take one step to him he'll take a bunch of giant steps to you yes submit yourselves therefore unto God resist the devil and he will flee how many scriptures do we have that encourages us to make sure that we maintain that relationship he went through all of that to bridge that Gap that Chasm that Bloody bridge for that Chasm for man and God to come back in Fellowship again just for us to sit around and not do nothing about it or talk to him or fellowship with him or have come to you with them amen yes we have our we have our times that we should be in prayer for the Lord but friends you could talk to God anytime yes full unfettered accidents I've heard of places you think one of the most infallible things in this country today is to pick up now Dom 9-1-1 you're going to get some live person there that's going to be attending to your need I've heard today there's places that they've called and they've put you on hold it had gotten that bad amen or the police just don't show up at all sometimes sometimes you know I I I I need them here well you know they're over here because 10 people just killed or whatever it might be yeah sin has gotten to the place used to be when I first started driving if your wheels didn't come to a complete stop at a stop sign a cop saw you he'd give you a ticket yeah yeah now people blow through lights and signs that goes on it oh you're hardly there right amen I I've seen cops on the corner of the road and people just go right through the stop sign and do a thing about it you know a person go 10 10 15 miles an hour to spend them they let them go why because they're looking for the one going 30 and 40 over the speed limit it's gotten that bad God at any time remember what brother green taught us I think I I asked brother Green's permission to put it in my book first John 1 9 or 9-1-1 yeah remember I told us that 9119 and 9-1-1 amen I I even researched the history of 9-1-1 and when it first came into being in the first 9-1-1 call and all that it's that call that we can make any time to go right we don't have to worry about dotted numbers we don't have to worry about a busy signal we don't have to worry about call waiting we don't have to worry about call forwarding or just Direct amen at one time man didn't have that opportunity for him but we had that opportunity yeah we have that again privilege I like that word we have the privilege to be able to speak to you years enhancers praise the Lord amen let's stand up because praise the Lord he's always there he's always listening amen I feel like I want to sing one of these that we sang earlier today I've seen this Reach Out And Touch the Lord let's sing that chorus again to him just Reach Out And Touch him see the whole thing comes to us Saints the work that Jesus Christ did he hung at Calvary he said it is finished he finished his work yes it is done now it's us see the scripture draw nigh to him submit yourself to him reach out to him it follows our lot to do that to perform that part of it God responds amen God responds to that let's sing it as we reach out to him today we have any need in your life in your heart reach out to him today now Reach Out and touch the Lord Lord as he passes by you will find he's not too busy [Music] he is passing by this moment [Music] right now Saints so Reach Out And Touch the Lord as he passes by [Music] so Reach Out And Touch the Lord as ye go one more time now or Reach Out can't touch the Lord as he passes by you will find is not your busy to hear your heart he is passing eyes [Music] and touch the Lord as he goes by amen oh yes Jesus Hallelujah he's passed by this way against saints yes did you reach out to get what you have need of Amen it's up to us to do the reaching he's passed by and sometimes yes if you get what you have need of from the Lord you've got to reach out and touch them get it amen your every need will supply if we just Reach Out And Touch him praise the Lord amen praise the Lord Jesus God bless you this morning I pray something was said to bless and strengthen the Lord today and again if there's anything that tried to get across today is let us take advantage of that amen take advantage of that opportunity that privilege to be able to reach out and touch the Lord Jesus I know it sometimes maybe easier when you're doing things because I know a lot of times at work and something's just not going right and I said Lord just help me or when something gets completed really well I'm like thank you Lord I went together so good you know it's just those little things yes yes don't think for a second he doesn't hear that yes amen don't that that means something amen it means something praise the Lord God is there we just Reach Out And Touch him amen and praise the Lord God bless you appreciate each one of you being here if you're watching God bless you and pray something was said the bless and screen to you again today and the Lord Jesus take that opportunity that privilege that he's given us Amen to reach out to him he's here he's always with you never leaves or forsakes and I haven't had a chance to talk to Craig about the place behind here hopefully Lord willing I'll get to talk to him uh this week about that and I have been told uh by a couple of people that Mother's Day is probably not a good time to have the lunch which I fully understand makes sense just you know and I didn't necessarily mean that had to be that day I thought well if if it was available we could because the restaurants were busy but um but just around that time in the next month or so that's kind of what my mindset is and what I'm thinking so if anybody has the opinions or feelings uh it may change if the facility back here is uh open to us and we're able to use it and it's uh the configuration I haven't seen them so I don't know if the configuration inside them I mean they're all different some were open like this was wide open when I got here and some you know like next door was water but this one over here had like eight offices in it they had to tear all that out just to make a room and stuff like I don't know what the configuration is but if it works with the configuration and we can make it work then we might can just get some tables and chairs and have it over there and that would work great if that worked that way so we'll just see trust in the Lord just tell me what's on my heart and uh hopefully the Lord willing we can do something figure something out or I really enjoy our time together in the fellowship with that so I just trust that it's a blessing to you too so just pray with me on that if you could and I know the Lord will make a way amen amen I know the Lord will make a way so God
