[25:49] um I see here you got some pictures you
[25:51] want me to go over those with you want
[25:53] to tighten this
[25:54] or
[25:57] okay I'm going to sit here so I can see
[25:59] the pictures God bless you
[26:03] um didn't really know what to say or do
[26:07] um other than uh grateful for a good
[26:10] trip gone for about 14 days um flew from
[26:14] Tucson to Atlanta Atlanta to Athens um
[26:18] flight was great no issues no bumps no
[26:20] nothing um made up some time it supposed
[26:23] to be 10 and a half hours made in 10
[26:25] hours um slept on the plane everything
[26:27] was good there to get app up in Athens
[26:31] and everything is great so beautiful um
[26:34] it's a type of beauty that we don't have
[26:36] as far as I know on North and South
[26:38] America there's just a beauty in in the
[26:42] Mediterranean that we don't have here so
[26:44] much tropical um tropical vegetation
[26:49] it's just it's all natural everywhere
[26:51] what we have here like oh I'm growing
[26:53] oranges or I'm growing figs or I'm
[26:55] growing pomegranates they're they're
[26:57] everywhere there are um the the
[27:00] hillsides are full of olive trees the
[27:03] hillsides are full of huge Fung Grant
[27:05] trees bigger than I've ever seen big
[27:07] trees bigger than I've ever seen as big
[27:09] as this room um it's just amazing the
[27:13] beauty over there and it helps me to
[27:15] relate to what we hear in the Bible
[27:16] about the mberry trees and the
[27:18] pomegranates and the olives and how how
[27:20] that kind of coincides with what we read
[27:23] in the Bible um it was so great to be
[27:25] able to see that so I do have a couple
[27:27] pictures that out of the 4100 that I
[27:30] took to share with you um that do
[27:33] pertain a little bit to um the scripture
[27:35] and the things that we hear in the New
[27:37] Testament specifically um so the first
[27:40] the second stop we took was in Turkey um
[27:43] so we drove three hours to Ephesus um
[27:46] that we know the Ephesians church is
[27:48] where they were in Ephesus um but we our
[27:51] first stop in in Ephesus area was uh
[27:55] said to be the last house that Mary the
[27:57] mother of
[27:58] lived in before she passed so um this is
[28:02] a couple pictures of that
[28:05] the that I think that's a mulberry wow
[28:10] yeah there's another picture mberry um
[28:13] but Mulberry is also the trees that the
[28:15] silk worms eat and live in um and it's
[28:18] also where they build their cocoons and
[28:20] that they're harvested from the moary
[28:22] trees to make kind of Sil cloths and Sil
[28:27] RS couple
[28:29] extra side of the house um very rustic
[28:33] very old construction um just basically
[28:36] cement made out of dirt with dirt
[28:40] smooshed into what we know is
[28:45] Brick the obviously there's glass
[28:47] windows but back in the day they were
[28:49] not glass
[28:51] just area and then we drove back down
[28:55] the mountain to Ephesus this is the of
[28:58] epis what's left of it
[29:02] anyways so the people would come through
[29:04] either the east or west gate this is the
[29:06] East Gate this is where we started our
[29:07] tour and we work our way down to the
[29:09] west gate um and then a lot most of the
[29:13] ruins in Athens and the greater European
[29:15] area um what we see is ruins were
[29:18] actually messed up from previous
[29:20] restoration efforts before we had the
[29:22] technology to move these tons of of rock
[29:27] so will'll see lots of just pieces
[29:30] laying around everywhere um I took
[29:33] hundreds of pictures of just these kinds
[29:35] of pieces all over a huge Shaw puzzle um
[29:39] there are continued restoration efforts
[29:41] but they are so slow and meticulous
[29:42] about it it takes years and years and
[29:44] years um this is the stadium um where
[29:48] Paul stood and preached in Ephesians
[29:52] church so
[29:54] I I took a couple of the rocks from that
[29:58] and give it to my
[30:04] parents so it's just so neat to be in a
[30:08] place
[30:10] that an apostle stood and preach the
[30:14] word you could I mean I don't know how
[30:17] many Christians were there with me on
[30:19] our tour or just in the general group
[30:21] but it's just I didn't have a whole lot
[30:23] of time to kind of sit there and
[30:25] meditate but you I just touched the
[30:28] because scientifically I don't know if
[30:30] you know rocks absorb the energy and the
[30:32] sounds um in a way that humans don't
[30:35] know how to extract it um billions and
[30:38] billions of terabytes of data can be
[30:40] contained in crystals and rocks so I
[30:43] know that the words that Paul spoke are
[30:46] in those rocks and those pillars
[30:52] so um this is a politician speaking
[30:56] platform um politicians had three
[30:59] minutes to give their speech about what
[31:01] they wanted to do what they wanted to
[31:02] change um and then they only served for
[31:06] six months so policies they made they
[31:10] were done that way so they would have to
[31:11] live under them um but this is where
[31:14] they would stand and give their speech
[31:16] um this is the marketplace of Ephesus
[31:20] where most of the trading would happen
[31:23] um it's it's an amazing structure it's
[31:26] you can the how small they are compared
[31:29] to the heights you got a six foot person
[31:33] and then the rest of that even just
[31:35] these little statues are like 10t
[31:38] tall and it's just it's just amazing um
[31:41] we learned at one of the silk rug carpet
[31:46] manufacturing places where it's also
[31:48] made by hand that they actually use silk
[31:50] to cut the granite and the marble to
[31:52] make these kind of structures um and
[31:54] then here's a very very tree um that's
[31:59] in Ephesus when you walk into the great
[32:01] tourist area it's just there on the left
[32:03] and then um and bront is where all the
[32:06] ruins are so it was just absolutely huge
[32:10] there were a few big trees that size
[32:11] also um it was just incredible W and we
[32:16] take it for granted here but prickly
[32:17] bees are are there and they're actually
[32:19] invasive but I thought it was really
[32:21] neat to have a little bit of home on the
[32:24] trip um this is a overshot uh over the
[32:28] city of Athens this is also where Paul
[32:31] stood and preached in Athens um this
[32:35] building here in the middle that you
[32:38] see is um the Agora or ancient Agora it
[32:42] was just filled with a bunch of Market
[32:43] places and that was the General
[32:46] congregating area of everyone where all
[32:47] the markets were and Paul would stand up
[32:50] here on this rock base and reach out
[32:53] to um so it's you can't really tell but
[32:57] that
[32:58] it's huge it's probably 100 ft wide um
[33:02] it's been so traveled now that the rocks
[33:04] are like glass
[33:06] almost but yeah it was really neat and
[33:08] this is just a a zoomed in view of
[33:13] that ancient aora this that small
[33:16] building in the bottom right is a
[33:18] monastery they do have monasteries
[33:20] sprinkled throughout the cities and they
[33:22] all kind of look the
[33:24] same and this is what the acop looks
[33:28] like um you can see the Acropolis from
[33:30] anywhere in the city because it sits in
[33:31] the middle of the city high like that um
[33:35] so you got the the great Acropolis which
[33:38] is this is a closeup shot you can tell
[33:40] how large it is also by this tiny person
[33:43] standing in front of
[33:44] it there is a crane in the middle as
[33:48] they slowly
[33:50] reconstruct um any of this white piece
[33:54] are pieces that they can't find to put
[33:56] put back together so they used um New
[33:59] Marble from the area of grease to
[34:02] reconstruct any of the dark pieces are
[34:04] original um so they are still slowly
[34:06] very slowly rebuilding that and that
[34:09] area is also littered with just a jigsaw
[34:12] puzzle things that they use to put
[34:15] together and reconstruct the parts of
[34:19] Happ um this is a beach in Corfu an
[34:23] island of Greece the most beautiful
[34:25] beach I have ever seen and I just came
[34:27] back from the Caribbean so this makes
[34:28] the Caribbean look like a for AG it's
[34:32] the intense light blue that that water
[34:35] is is just absolutely incredible um so I
[34:39] had to include that and
[34:41] then those are just
[34:43] people and then this is the brokn
[34:47] um and just also
[34:50] beautiful water beautiful city Old City
[34:53] PS um it just the beauty is
[34:58] it would be hard without showing you
[34:59] more and more pictures to convey what
[35:01] that's like and what it looks
[35:04] like so those are all the pictures I I
[35:06] decided to show just I didn't want to
[35:08] take up too much time um but just thank
[35:10] the lord for keeping you safe um out
[35:12] there while around there there were cats
[35:15] everywhere um the the city takes care of
[35:18] them um but no there are cats everywhere
[35:20] but there are no pigeons um so we don't
[35:23] have to worry there wasn't all the
[35:25] pigeons and stuff trying to get your
[35:26] food sitting at a table CU all the
[35:29] restaurants they have sit in areas but
[35:32] they all have communal um like cover
[35:36] spots where you go to eat um because
[35:38] they don't really want you in the the
[35:40] restaurant so small but cats would just
[35:42] wander around through um the food was
[35:46] unlike what we have in the US it's
[35:48] unprocessed they don't import so
[35:50] anything we ate was grown in gree um the
[35:54] potatoes for the french fries don't
[35:56] taste like the french fries here they
[35:57] potatoes actually have flavor to them
[35:59] and they're a slight yellow color the
[36:01] tomatoes the Cucumbers the the yogurt
[36:04] was amazing um the honey they eat they
[36:08] eat their yogurt we call it Greek yogurt
[36:10] yogurt there they just put honey on it
[36:12] and eat it um yeah and then we went on
[36:16] the cruise the cruise in days we stopped
[36:18] at several Greek Islands a couple
[36:20] different um countries like turkey um
[36:24] and we got back um out after the crew
[36:28] stayed one day so that way we could
[36:30] recover and hop back on the flight and
[36:32] it was 11 and a half hours on the way
[36:34] back because of the Winds but everything
[36:37] was was great and just thankful that
[36:38] everything um went completely smooth no
[36:41] issues no health issues no sicknesses no
[36:44] ceases um no delays the Lord is to us
[36:49] amen thank you for your pra amen yes the
[36:53] Lord
[36:57] makes me want to
[36:59] go see those
[37:01] places guess I don't know never even
[37:03] been to Israel myself so maybe some in
[37:06] here have but I haven't even done now so
[37:09] but love to go places one time U they
[37:13] had planned a trip and U brother green
[37:18] uh with brother green or he wasn't
[37:23] going or he decided he was going to go
[37:26] and he asked me I said no I said I'm I'm
[37:30] going to stay here and help the Lord
[37:32] told me to come here to help you and
[37:34] you're going there you need me here to
[37:37] help um so he said he he appreciated
[37:41] that very much he said maybe one day
[37:42] just me and you will go and obviously
[37:46] honestly that never happened of course
[37:48] truth I think if I remember right the
[37:50] trip that he was planning anyway didn't
[37:53] happen uh he never did go back to your
[37:56] so um but I would like to go someday the
[38:00] Lord willing if it comes out that way
[38:03] kind of tough under the circumstances
[38:05] but you never know the Lord has a way of
[38:06] making things happen so we'll just see
[38:09] what he has in store so I'm so glad that
[38:13] U Lord blessed Micah and brought him
[38:15] back
[38:17] and obviously touched him on the trip
[38:20] so just seeing those things very
[38:23] powerful and then kind of makes things
[38:25] come alive you never
[38:28] before you read the scripture know the
[38:30] scripture well enough to understand what
[38:32] the pictures are about uh and then just
[38:35] kind of put yourself in there when you
[38:37] read that part of the scripture now you
[38:39] can keep in your mind the picture he
[38:41] took and what you saw on the picture and
[38:43] what you're reading put the two together
[38:46] and kind of makes a picture amen so I
[38:50] appreciate him doing that so God bless
[38:53] you God bless you let's stand if we
[38:55] could I'm going to go ahead and'll just
[38:56] change the service

[41:56] Christ we pray
[41:58] amen amen 2 Corinthians chapter 10 let's
[42:02] begin reading with verse
[42:05] one now I Paul myself beseech you by the
[42:09] meekness and gentleness of Christ who
[42:12] impr present and base among you but
[42:14] being absent and bold toward you but I
[42:17] beseech you that I may not that I may
[42:19] not be bold when I am present with that
[42:22] confidence wherewith I think to be bold
[42:25] against some which think think of us as
[42:28] if we walked according to the flesh for
[42:30] though we walk in the flesh we do not
[42:33] war after the flesh for the weapons of
[42:36] our Warfare the weapons of our Warfare
[42:39] are not carnal But Mighty through God to
[42:43] the pulling down of strongholds that's
[42:46] the strongholds of Satan right casting
[42:49] down imaginations and every High thing
[42:52] that exalteth itself against the
[42:55] knowledge of God and bring bringing into
[42:57] captivity every thought to The Obedience
[43:01] of Christ and having in a Readiness to
[43:04] Revenge all Disobedience when your
[43:07] obedience is fulfilled you could be
[43:10] seated if you'd
[43:12] like
[43:16] amen so as I said this Lord willing will
[43:19] be the uh the last part of this series
[43:23] on the Gateway or the Mind amen as we uh
[43:27] delve into this
[43:28] Lord not looking to to be too long but
[43:31] just how the Lord leads so amen um so we
[43:35] get to the mind I want to read this
[43:38] quote that I wanted to start out with
[43:40] after that amen that brother randam in
[43:43] 1964 Christ identified and the same in
[43:46] all generations and what he said in a
[43:49] couple places but this
[43:51] specifically uh uh read Christ
[43:54] identified the same in all generations
[43:56] April 1964 now look at the position
[44:01] everybody will admit she's in a Sodom
[44:04] condition I passed over California here
[44:07] the other day and got a hold of a
[44:08] magazine or a paper where it read
[44:10] homosexuals had increased 60% in LA in
[44:14] just the last year see oh my pitiful see
[44:18] it's just because women has throw
[44:21] themselves away that's right and just on
[44:23] the streets naked it's just a shame but
[44:26] the Bible says that it would be that way
[44:28] every man if they're just he said
[44:30] they're changed he said and it's going
[44:33] to get worse going to get worse and
[44:35] hasn't it my mind since
[44:39] 1964 and it's going to get worse in
[44:42] another if the world would stand listen
[44:45] to what he said now if the world would
[44:47] stand another 50 years the whole world
[44:51] would be totally
[44:53] insane look at the sanity Insanity 40
[44:57] from 40 from 20 years ago till this time
[45:00] look at it that was 60 years ago yes 60
[45:03] years ago he said 50 years be totally
[45:07] insane and you look and you see well
[45:10] people aren't filling up the insane
[45:11] asylums but look at the way they're
[45:13] living look at the way they're acting
[45:15] look at the way they're eating look at
[45:16] the way they're dressing the way they're
[45:19] dressing would make you realize there's
[45:21] something mentally unstable with that
[45:23] person to look at the people on the
[45:25] streets and how they dress or or don't
[45:28] dress their lack of dress makes you
[45:31] realize that must be something totally
[45:34] insane there must be something wrong
[45:36] mentally with that person the way they
[45:38] talk the things that are acceptable
[45:40] today you think it would be inside 40 30
[45:45] 25 30 years ago there were things
[45:47] thought that are common today that we
[45:50] thought back then a person would be
[45:52] insane to think that was okay to think
[45:54] that was normal to think that was right
[45:57] but that's the way it's gotten to be
[45:58] today yeah that it's that it's thought
[46:00] to be is something that's normal that's
[46:03] okay it's something that's that is a a a
[46:07] kind of run-of-the-mill if you will and
[46:09] it's something that you look at and as
[46:11] we know and we're reading the scripture
[46:13] is something that you can't help but
[46:14] know that somebody's there's there's
[46:16] some Insanity going on somewhere yes
[46:20] there there's there's people that have
[46:21] just lost their minds they don't they
[46:24] don't have their mental faculties to
[46:26] know what's right or wrong anymore uh
[46:29] it's all gone so if you think you say
[46:32] well 50 years will be totally insane
[46:34] this began longer back than 50 years
[46:36] from that time that this started and how
[46:39] crazy and how bad it's gotten today
[46:41] that's the way it's become amen where
[46:44] people people have completely in in in a
[46:48] lot of cases they've just lost their
[46:50] minds yes what was right what what what
[46:53] was right then is wrong now what what
[46:55] was wrong then is right right now and
[46:58] it's totally completely upside down and
[47:00] based on what we know as common decency
[47:04] and
[47:05] morality just just common morality is
[47:08] just not the same anymore uh laws on the
[47:12] books that don't even get observed
[47:14] anymore things you you wonder why things
[47:17] are illegal or they have laws on the
[47:21] books against certain things and and and
[47:23] it's just as common as anything else you
[47:25] think well why do they why why do they
[47:27] even
[47:28] bother it it just is just baffling to me
[47:31] I know in the state of Arizona they were
[47:33] fussing and
[47:35] complaining around the country and how
[47:38] Antiquated Arizona was because the
[47:41] Arizona state representatives decide to
[47:43] try to bring back or start to
[47:48] enforce an abortion law that's been on
[47:50] the books for over a hundred years for
[47:53] the state or however many years it was a
[47:56] long time
[47:57] start to bring that back it's always
[48:00] been there it's just people ignore it it
[48:03] doesn't exist in it it it's as though it
[48:06] didn't exist anymore and now they bring
[48:08] it back up and people criticize and say
[48:11] oh how dare Arizona do this it they're
[48:14] just it was just something that they
[48:15] brought up to say this is the law in the
[48:17] books and that's what we should enforce
[48:19] if you want to change it then we'll
[48:21] change then it you know you got to
[48:23] change it amen but it was like back then
[48:28] it was illegal for any kind of murder as
[48:31] such right now it's not doesn't matter
[48:35] it's not important to a lot of people
[48:37] anymore in fact um that's that's the
[48:41] thing that a lot of people that that uh
[48:45] they they must have in
[48:47] life uh they think they can live without
[48:50] air drink or water as long as they can
[48:52] ab abort their babies they're okay you
[48:54] know don't I don't need any water I just
[48:56] need to be able to murder my child I
[48:58] don't need any food you know that's just
[49:00] how bad it's gotten and and they think
[49:03] and they think that that's
[49:06] crazy lost their minds totally insane
[49:09] right amen let's go over to uh Matthew
[49:13] St Matthew chapter
[49:18] 22 Matthew chapter 22 begin with verse
[49:22] 35 maybe 34 let's start with verse 34
[49:29] Matthew
[49:33] 22:34 now look at this but when the
[49:36] Pharisees had heard that he Jesus had
[49:39] put the Sadducees to silence he tied
[49:42] their words up so much they didn't have
[49:44] an they didn't have an A a rebuttal for
[49:48] what Jesus was saying they were gathered
[49:52] together then one of them which was a
[49:54] lawyer asked him a question tempting him
[49:56] and saying Master tempting see wasn't
[50:01] serious he's tempting Master which is
[50:04] the great commandment in the law always
[50:07] trying to catch him with something amen
[50:09] same thing it's the same devil today
[50:12] does the same thing same tactic just
[50:14] trying to just trying to stir things to
[50:17] to to find something to accuse you with
[50:21] amen Jesus said unto him Thou shalt love
[50:25] the Lord thy God God with all thy heart
[50:28] with all thy soul with all thy mind this
[50:31] is the first and great commandment and
[50:34] the second is like unto it Thou shalt
[50:37] love thy neighbor as thyself on these
[50:41] two Commandments hang all the law and
[50:44] the prophets now look he said you must
[50:47] love the Lord thy God with all th heart
[50:49] soul
[50:51] mind but look at what Jesus is covering
[50:54] here look at what look at what his
[50:56] answer is first of all his answer that
[50:59] he's given is which uh I may Lord
[51:04] willing when I feel compelled to I keep
[51:06] thinking about trying to bring the
[51:08] series on bitterness again um offenses
[51:12] but I just haven't felt that to do it so
[51:14] I just haven't done it but in that this
[51:18] love we know there's the the three loves
[51:20] there's the love there's God's love
[51:22] which is a love it just exists and
[51:25] there's a human love which has uh a love
[51:32] of affection in it and a love of action
[51:36] so there there's a love filo love that's
[51:39] that is a that is a noun and a verb so
[51:42] it has two forms to the one love that's
[51:45] human love God's love agapo agapo agapo
[51:49] actually is that love Is Just it it just
[51:53] exist it it just is because God is as
[51:56] long as God is it is it's unconditional
[51:59] uh it's unchanging uh man's Love Changes
[52:02] man's love flip flops from one to the
[52:05] other and uh it's can be here today and
[52:08] gone tomorrow that's man's love but this
[52:11] love that he speaking of you look it up
[52:14] it says they shall Thou shalt love
[52:16] that's God's love that is the goppa love
[52:19] thou shalt love unconditionally the Lord
[52:23] thy God now look at what he's
[52:24] specifically bringing now it's got mind
[52:27] in here which is part of the which is
[52:29] the subject of what we've been dealing
[52:31] with Thou shalt love the Lord go thy God
[52:34] with all thy heart with all thy soul and
[52:38] with all thy mind all all all but now
[52:42] why is he differentiating them amen amen
[52:46] why is he differentiating the the heart
[52:49] soul mind the
[52:51] love love love of course ailia love a
[52:55] love is a love
[52:58] is a choice amen uh is a choice uh God's
[53:04] love not a choice it just exists
[53:07] um my love for him existed long before I
[53:10] even knew right it just was there amen
[53:15] because he was there praise the Lord but
[53:17] look how he splits this up he said Thou
[53:19] shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy
[53:22] heart now what's the heart the heart is
[53:25] the Cent
[53:27] of the physical life amen the heart is
[53:31] the center of the physical life you say
[53:32] the heart and the Soul's the same thing
[53:34] but the heart that we talk about the
[53:36] beating heart inside our bodies is the
[53:39] center of our physical life he said all
[53:42] th heart and with all thy soul and
[53:44] what's the soul the soul is the center
[53:47] of the spiritual life amen so the
[53:51] heart's the center of the physical life
[53:53] the soul is the center of the of the
[53:55] spiritual life
[53:57] and with all thy mind is the gateway to
[54:00] them amen so as that love comes it comes
[54:05] in a way that it filters through the
[54:07] Mind obviously but then it enters into
[54:10] an effects and takes over the physical
[54:15] the center of your physical being and
[54:17] the center of your spiritual being so
[54:20] every bit of
[54:22] you every part of you every molec of you
[54:27] spiritually and physically is to love
[54:30] the Lord thy God period amen amen every
[54:35] part of you not just giving a hand or a
[54:39] toe or as brother Brown preached a
[54:41] little room in the heart well you can go
[54:43] in here but you can't go over here no
[54:46] all of it all the heart all the physical
[54:49] all the spiritual and everything that
[54:51] enters in through the Gateway every bit
[54:53] of it is to love the Lord thy God with
[54:56] all thy heart soul and mind amen our
[54:59] entire life is to be absorbed with Jesus
[55:03] Christ our entire life every part of us
[55:05] every every part of our being every
[55:08] thought amen every action every deed
[55:14] every everything about us spiritually
[55:17] physically mentally emotionally in every
[55:19] way amen that's why Jesus is saying Thou
[55:22] shalt love the Lord thy God in every
[55:24] single facet capacity city of your being
[55:29] yes not just your physical being not
[55:31] just your spiritual being but your
[55:34] physical and your spiritual being amen
[55:38] amen through your mind the Gateway that
[55:40] is the gateway to the truth now look
[55:43] this is the first and great commandment
[55:47] praise the Lord to love the Lord thy God
[55:50] everything you've got everything
[55:52] absorbed in your in your entire being to
[55:56] love the Lord thy God Amen that's the
[55:59] first and great commandment but look
[56:00] what he says and the second is like unto
[56:04] it amen amen he didn't say it was
[56:07] exactly the same amen but look it is
[56:11] like unto it so you can't separate the
[56:14] two amen amen you can't separate the two
[56:17] they are two as he says like unto it
[56:21] they are twoo but they are
[56:24] inseparable amen that's why it's like
[56:26] unto it praise the
[56:28] Lord he says the second is like Thou
[56:31] shalt love that love is the same love
[56:35] agapa love unconditional love thou shalt
[56:40] love thy neighbor as thyself now who's
[56:43] your neighbor person lives under you
[56:45] person lives next to you person lives
[56:47] above you next door neighbor God down
[56:50] the street who is your
[56:52] neighbor everybody Humanity amen
[56:56] humanity is your neighbor amen and I
[56:59] could actually enter into that all of
[57:03] creation amen you realize all of
[57:06] creation came from God God spoke and
[57:09] every bit of what came out of him is
[57:12] what we see every day all of this
[57:15] creation amen it's beautiful God created
[57:18] till man got a hold of it right now now
[57:21] it's just and people love I guess
[57:23] somehow love all the buildings and stuff
[57:24] that's fine uh
[57:26] personally I I just soon have a 100
[57:29] acres in the middle of the woods with a
[57:31] cabin right in the middle of it and a
[57:33] nice stream going right through the
[57:34] middle I'd be fine with me amen I sent a
[57:37] song to my family this week asking if
[57:39] they ever heard it my wife stopped and
[57:42] listen to it I can't remember I could
[57:44] look it up but I don't want to take the
[57:46] time to do that but it's a song about
[57:47] the guy's talking about heaven he says I
[57:49] don't need I don't need streets of gold
[57:52] just a nice dirt path to get me home I
[57:54] don't need crystal seed is just a nice
[57:57] stream flowing in front of my cabin or
[57:59] something that's all I need and that's I
[58:01] just identify so much with that song
[58:04] because that's all I need that's all I
[58:06] care about big skyscrapers and all this
[58:08] stuff that that is what it is whatever
[58:10] that's that's fine man the marbles the
[58:13] uh the buildings and stuff that's all
[58:15] great the things Mah showed us and stuff
[58:17] that's wonderful that people build glad
[58:19] to have a roof over our heads here in
[58:20] air conditioning amen but just give me
[58:23] what God made amen amen that that's
[58:26] satisfies me all the time amen these two
[58:30] now these two Commandments hang all the
[58:32] laws and the prophets to love the Lord
[58:35] thy God all your being to love your
[58:37] neighbor everyone all of creation all
[58:41] Humanity love as
[58:43] yourself Amen in the exact same way that
[58:46] you love the Lord God now how many times
[58:48] do you see that manifested right how
[58:51] many times do you see it manifested that
[58:54] we love
[58:57] Humanity in the same context the same
[58:59] way that we love God Amen am that's what
[59:04] he
[59:05] said we can be critical of it all we
[59:07] want we can say well that's not possible
[59:10] or we can make excuse or whatever we
[59:12] want to say but that's what Jesus said
[59:14] amen so we either want to obey it we
[59:16] want to live it or we don't it's our
[59:18] choice but that's what he said amen all
[59:22] thy heart and soul the Gateway way that
[59:26] gets to them the Mind Amen to love all
[59:31] the same way that you love God yes amen
[59:35] praise the Lord let's go over to uh
[59:37] Proverbs chapter
[59:44] 23 praise the
[59:46] Lord the mind that place of decision yes
[59:50] amen the place of decision that people
[59:53] people can't understand things
[59:56] if if someone can't understand something
[59:59] you going over to Proverbs 23 if people
[1:00:02] can't understand something they they
[1:00:04] don't normally receive it amen you ever
[1:00:08] you ever thought of that if someone
[1:00:10] can't understand it with their brain
[1:00:12] they don't normally receive it right
[1:00:14] they don't normally accept it that's why
[1:00:16] we have to believe and accept the Lord
[1:00:19] Jesus by faith amen we accept and
[1:00:21] believe him by faith yes
[1:00:24] because we don't necessarily have the
[1:00:27] evidence of him standing there or or or
[1:00:31] whatever the evidence someone may be
[1:00:33] looking for if they can't believe it
[1:00:35] with their minds they they just a lot of
[1:00:38] times they don't accept it and there's
[1:00:40] so many things in the scripture that
[1:00:42] defy common logic there's so many things
[1:00:45] in the scripture that defy nor
[1:00:48] normalities in life and they don't make
[1:00:51] sense to the human mind you look at it
[1:00:53] and say how could that happen how can
[1:00:56] iron float it can't right without God
[1:01:01] right God can make iron float yes man
[1:01:06] can't chemically scientifically
[1:01:10] everybody says believe science well if I
[1:01:13] just believe science there's no way I'm
[1:01:15] going to believe that iron can float
[1:01:17] there's no way but did it do it yes yes
[1:01:22] amen go man lost a head in the in the
[1:01:25] river Prophet come along and made iron
[1:01:29] float that doesn't make sense right you
[1:01:32] can look at it with your own eyes and
[1:01:34] say I just I don't believe what I'm
[1:01:35] seeing have you ever said that I have
[1:01:39] yes not as dramatic as iron floating but
[1:01:42] I have said I can't believe what I'm
[1:01:44] seeing actually almost every day when I
[1:01:47] go down the street and I see people out
[1:01:49] I can't believe what I'm looking at I
[1:01:50] took a picture of a guy in the Denver
[1:01:52] Airport one time cuz I absolutely just
[1:01:54] could not believe what I was looking
[1:01:55] looking at I took a picture of
[1:01:58] it amen I actually and and and another
[1:02:01] time in in the Denver Airport I saw a
[1:02:03] woman going down the Concourse with a
[1:02:08] goat and I thought that there is no way
[1:02:12] that could be a support animal it didn't
[1:02:14] have the vest or any of that on I
[1:02:15] thought how in the world was that woman
[1:02:17] allowed to come into the airport with a
[1:02:20] goat and it wasn't a little nanny goat
[1:02:23] I'm talking about this goat was it was a
[1:02:25] big full SI goat with
[1:02:27] horns how could they allow that it it
[1:02:30] went by so fast I didn't get to take a
[1:02:31] picture of that one I got a picture of
[1:02:33] the guy I'm like how I can't believe
[1:02:35] what I'm seeing I looked at I like how I
[1:02:37] can't believe what I'm seeing there's a
[1:02:39] goat in the
[1:02:40] airport how does that happen I've heard
[1:02:42] of people bringing ostriches how does
[1:02:44] that happen they call them support
[1:02:46] animals I don't I don't understand I
[1:02:49] look say how could that happen I could
[1:02:51] look you could look if you were there at
[1:02:53] that time and see an axe head float on
[1:02:56] the water and say how could that happen
[1:02:57] I can't believe what I'm saying amen you
[1:03:00] see with your own eyes and not believe
[1:03:02] it it's hard to something just as simple
[1:03:06] as as as a Christian biblical principle
[1:03:10] of tithing there's no way that 90% of
[1:03:14] your money will go further than 100% of
[1:03:17] your money it's just not possible Right
[1:03:20] but it does it does right amen given in
[1:03:25] faith as unto the Lord it will go
[1:03:27] further as a than 100% right that's his
[1:03:31] word it happens and how many people in
[1:03:34] here and I heard you said
[1:03:36] amen because it's the truth it does
[1:03:40] doesn't make sense it defies common
[1:03:43] logic there's no way that can happen but
[1:03:46] it does it does exactly the same way
[1:03:49] that iron can float yes but it doesn't
[1:03:52] make sense to the human mind so the mind
[1:03:55] and so many ways it will cast it out
[1:03:57] because it just can't understand it it
[1:03:59] just can't believe it that's why you
[1:04:02] believe it by faith yes it's all faith
[1:04:05] everything about this walk with the Lord
[1:04:07] is Faith amen and you believe it you
[1:04:10] trust him now you don't do
[1:04:14] it you don't experiment with God you
[1:04:18] hear me right you don't experiment with
[1:04:21] God you don't say well let me see if I
[1:04:23] can try to get this iron to Flo no it
[1:04:25] won't work
[1:04:26] right amen won't work oh let me I'll
[1:04:29] just I'll give this experiment I I'll
[1:04:31] give a little bit and we'll just see
[1:04:33] what God does no no no God doesn't
[1:04:34] experiment friend right amen you either
[1:04:37] are or you aren't you're committed or
[1:04:39] you're not you do it as unto the Lord
[1:04:41] you don't it's not a this is not a
[1:04:43] scientific experiment it's not something
[1:04:45] you reason with your brain it's not
[1:04:48] something that you try to accumulate to
[1:04:50] to try to understand scientifically or
[1:04:52] prove you believe it by faith and God
[1:04:55] proves it every time amen and it doesn't
[1:04:58] matter what other people say I don't
[1:05:01] care about their opinions I know because
[1:05:03] I've seen it I believe it and it's a
[1:05:06] truth I've proved it I do it according
[1:05:09] to the scripture as unto the Lord God
[1:05:12] proves himself every time amen every
[1:05:15] time yes he does doesn't make sense none
[1:05:18] of it makes sense amen but God showed it
[1:05:21] to be true amen there are scientific
[1:05:24] experiments too
[1:05:26] that God has allowed people has allowed
[1:05:28] men the intelligence to be able to do
[1:05:31] could you imagine a hundred years ago or
[1:05:33] so uh a 777 flying over somebody's did
[1:05:38] you imagine a 777 flying over Ephesus
[1:05:41] when Paul's standing there
[1:05:44] preaching oh there's another load of
[1:05:47] tourists what is that
[1:05:49] thing amen but God has allowed the
[1:05:53] unbelievable to happen
[1:05:58] hundreds of tons of metal can St set
[1:06:02] suspended in the
[1:06:04] air or set floating in water right I'm
[1:06:09] definitely not smart enough to
[1:06:10] understand it it doesn't make sense to
[1:06:12] me I know there's a there's a there's a
[1:06:16] a a scientifical principle to it but how
[1:06:21] hundreds of tons of iron can
[1:06:24] float they do it that way or be
[1:06:28] suspended in air amen it doesn't make
[1:06:31] sense now they prove that
[1:06:33] scientifically you can't prove God Amen
[1:06:37] or I say prove scientifically you can
[1:06:40] prove him in fact when we were talking
[1:06:42] about tius Malachi 3 he said prove me
[1:06:45] right and see if I won't do what I said
[1:06:47] I would do praise the Lord so he does
[1:06:50] say actually that's the only place in
[1:06:52] the scripture that God actually said
[1:06:55] prove me you know that yes only place in
[1:06:57] the Bible where he said prove me right
[1:07:00] amen it's the truth but mind the mind
[1:07:03] just can't comprehended but that's why
[1:07:05] we believe it by faith amen now let's go
[1:07:08] to Proverbs 23 I told you I wouldn't be
[1:07:10] too long here now Proverbs
[1:07:14] 23 one verse verse
[1:07:21] 7 for as he thinketh in his heart
[1:07:25] thinketh in his heart how do you think
[1:07:28] in your
[1:07:29] heart amen you ever pardon the pun
[1:07:33] thought of
[1:07:34] that how a man thinketh in his heart
[1:07:37] right for as he thinketh in his heart as
[1:07:40] a person think it in his heart so is he
[1:07:44] how do you think with your heart amen a
[1:07:48] lot the exact same way that we were just
[1:07:51] talking about when Jesus said with all
[1:07:53] thy heart soul mind amen mind is the
[1:07:58] gateway to the heart yes amen that that
[1:08:01] you as we read the scripture
[1:08:05] thinketh that we receive except amen now
[1:08:09] if you cast down reasonings if you cast
[1:08:11] down imaginations and those things and
[1:08:13] bring them captive to the word or or or
[1:08:16] like we had the computer example where
[1:08:18] you put it in your software and you you
[1:08:20] you you put it in a a quarantine and you
[1:08:23] erase it that that's gone but but if
[1:08:28] something that you accept something that
[1:08:30] you receive something that you ponder
[1:08:33] that you that you accept and receive as
[1:08:35] truth as as
[1:08:38] reality that becomes a part of a person
[1:08:41] in their heart as he thinketh in his
[1:08:44] heart it it because the only way to get
[1:08:47] to the heart is through the mind yes
[1:08:50] amen so that's the way you get to a
[1:08:52] person's heart is through their is
[1:08:53] through their mind say through the the
[1:08:55] mind yeah see taste feel smell here
[1:08:57] imagination effect reason memory faith
[1:08:59] we believe trusting in God comes to the
[1:09:02] heart as a man thinks so is he as a man
[1:09:05] thinketh in his heart so is he he is
[1:09:08] that person because that's what he feeds
[1:09:11] upon that's what he looks at that's what
[1:09:14] he trusts in there's so many things too
[1:09:16] and absorbing even especially for the
[1:09:19] children even to absorb and to and and
[1:09:22] to take in they become that thing
[1:09:26] amen uh let me let me read this to you
[1:09:30] this is the the last quote but look it's
[1:09:32] 196 April again 1965 though God's
[1:09:36] provided place of worship look at this
[1:09:39] look at this teenage insane now he's
[1:09:42] talking about teenage Insanity yeah look
[1:09:46] at this teenage insane I told you the
[1:09:49] other day they was uh t uh uh taking an
[1:09:53] analysis there at the school in Arizona
[1:09:56] where I live and 80% of the children in
[1:10:00] school is mentally
[1:10:02] 80 now you can't say that word
[1:10:05] anymore that's not politically correct U
[1:10:08] but you know me I am probably about as
[1:10:11] far from politically correct as a human
[1:10:13] being can be I am not even remotely
[1:10:16] close to caring about being politically
[1:10:19] correct just say it as it is yes amen
[1:10:21] and the truth is and he's talking about
[1:10:24] here 80% of children in
[1:10:27] 1965 year I was born 1965 80% in the
[1:10:33] schools are mentally
[1:10:36] that's that's a hard number
[1:10:39] when you look at it think but look at
[1:10:41] where it's gone come to see remember
[1:10:44] remember the warning that brother green
[1:10:46] even gave and talked about uh with Ali
[1:10:49] oop remember about alyo anybody seen the
[1:10:52] cartoon character alyo right brother and
[1:10:55] brother brandom told Brother green said
[1:10:57] that's exactly what Satan looked like
[1:10:58] when I saw him was like that alyu
[1:11:01] cartoon character you think well that's
[1:11:03] simple there's that's harmless there's
[1:11:05] nothing to that but
[1:11:07] look what will there now look if 80% of
[1:11:11] the children are mentally what
[1:11:13] will their children be yes again you got
[1:11:17] a mama that's a flapper you got a mother
[1:11:20] a child that's a strip teas and a
[1:11:22] daughter that's a grand a granddaughter
[1:11:24] that's a porn star and a great
[1:11:26] granddaughter where does it go from
[1:11:27] there amen what is the next one going to
[1:11:30] be like right yeah I saw one time I I
[1:11:34] forget where but you know being out a
[1:11:36] lot i i u i I was out and I saw the
[1:11:41] mother and she had tattoos all over
[1:11:45] piercings the dad which I'm assuming is
[1:11:47] the dad the male and the female he had
[1:11:51] tattoos all over him piercings
[1:11:52] everywhere see the little boy probably
[1:11:56] Emma's age probably not even Joel's age
[1:11:58] more like Emma and
[1:11:59] Alice he was rocking around and had
[1:12:02] these little tattoos on his arm now I'm
[1:12:04] sure they were
[1:12:06] probably uh U fake
[1:12:10] um yeah the the stickers uh whatever
[1:12:15] they put like a sticker that they put
[1:12:18] I'm sure it was something like that but
[1:12:19] he had two or three of them on his arms
[1:12:22] I thought no wonder what is this poor
[1:12:24] kid example I prayed for the little boy
[1:12:27] right there in my heart said God help
[1:12:29] that little boy he has no chance if if
[1:12:33] the circumstances and condition remain
[1:12:35] like that that little boy has no chance
[1:12:37] at life he'll end up just he'll end up
[1:12:40] worse than Mom and Daddy his two
[1:12:42] influence I felt so sorry for him Amen
[1:12:46] in that condition that's what it becomes
[1:12:48] amen what has it got to see then say
[1:12:50] what will the next Generation we can't
[1:12:53] have he says now we we can't have
[1:12:56] another generation and I was 6 months
[1:12:58] from being born eight months eight
[1:13:01] months from being born we can't have
[1:13:03] another generation we're at the end
[1:13:06] Jesus said these things would come look
[1:13:09] at all these televisions things getting
[1:13:11] these fictitious things in order it'll
[1:13:14] come a time I predict that people will
[1:13:17] be completely totally insane the world
[1:13:20] will be the Bible speaks of such hideous
[1:13:23] sights as they show in movies today of
[1:13:26] some prehistoric creatures eggs that
[1:13:29] lived in the Earth for so many thousands
[1:13:31] and millions of years hatch and come
[1:13:34] forth to some just a minor thing see he
[1:13:37] said to what's going to happen when hell
[1:13:40] is loosed and open and the Devil comes
[1:13:43] out of these mysterious things when
[1:13:46] Locust locust look like women long hair
[1:13:49] teeth like lions why that that world
[1:13:53] will be completely totally
[1:13:55] insane right it's he and then he said
[1:13:59] it's not but just about one degree from
[1:14:01] it
[1:14:02] now what would he say 60 years later
[1:14:05] yeah if it was just one degree from it
[1:14:08] there friends where are we now if we see
[1:14:11] it the secretiveness of
[1:14:14] it of of Satan the the cunningness the
[1:14:18] the crafty the
[1:14:19] beguiling and the beguiling is one of
[1:14:22] the greatest hindrances because it's
[1:14:26] something you don't realize when you're
[1:14:28] being beguiled you don't realize you're
[1:14:30] being tricked right that's one of the
[1:14:32] attributes of beguilement is you don't
[1:14:34] recognize or realize you're actually
[1:14:36] being tricked yes into believing
[1:14:39] something into seeing something amen
[1:14:43] that's what begot and that's exactly
[1:14:45] what the devil does he makes it seem so
[1:14:48] normal so okay amen and see the problem
[1:14:52] is it seems like so many times we as
[1:14:55] Christians you know standards are up
[1:14:58] here and of course you know a Godly
[1:15:01] person should always have their standard
[1:15:03] higher than the world but our standard
[1:15:06] should never leave where it's supposed
[1:15:08] to be and that's in the word our
[1:15:11] standards the word not based on what
[1:15:13] they do out there but what the word says
[1:15:15] amen standard of the world may be going
[1:15:18] lower and lower but that doesn't mean
[1:15:19] the standard of the Christian follows
[1:15:21] along with it well I'm not like them
[1:15:25] well no the the standard of the
[1:15:27] Christians to stay here the scripture is
[1:15:30] here the world keeps doing this but we
[1:15:33] don't follow the world well as long as
[1:15:36] we're A step above the world we're okay
[1:15:38] no no no we stay here yes that's why you
[1:15:42] become more and more an oddball every
[1:15:44] day yes because the world is getting
[1:15:46] worse and worse every day yes what is it
[1:15:49] it's the deception of the Mind amen
[1:15:52] where does the devil work the most in
[1:15:55] the mind Amen to deceive to to try to
[1:16:00] trick to try
[1:16:02] to bring around something well this this
[1:16:06] at one time oh and then when something
[1:16:10] becomes mainstream that used to be
[1:16:12] thought of as
[1:16:14] immoral when something immoral becomes
[1:16:17] mainstream then the people that still
[1:16:19] believe in the morality become the the
[1:16:23] the oddball
[1:16:25] you become the crazy person and if you
[1:16:28] look at it we are certainly in the
[1:16:32] minority amen always in the minority
[1:16:35] because that's the that's the trick of
[1:16:36] the devil yes to normalize it in
[1:16:39] people's minds it's not normal there's
[1:16:42] nothing normal about it amen not
[1:16:45] according to the scripture Our Life our
[1:16:47] life is to stay up here our morality is
[1:16:50] to stay up here not to
[1:16:52] follow and just stay a step up above the
[1:16:55] world if if if the world's dropping and
[1:16:58] dropping and dropping we don't drop with
[1:17:00] it we maintain our morality we maintain
[1:17:04] our scriptural standards we don't lower
[1:17:07] them amen we stay right there with them
[1:17:09] but that's the trick of the devil the
[1:17:11] Mind devil said well that's okay you
[1:17:13] know it'll be all right just keep going
[1:17:16] along that's exactly what he told eeve
[1:17:18] he does the exact same thing oh it'll be
[1:17:21] okay because God does know then then
[1:17:23] that day see
[1:17:26] you'll be as Gods knowing good and evil
[1:17:29] the trick let's go over to
[1:17:31] Isaiah chapter
[1:17:33] 26 we'll read this scripture here
[1:17:36] another one close shortly Isaiah

[1:19:24] my mind is stayed on thee amen I trust
[1:19:28] in you my faith is in you he will keep
[1:19:33] me in perfect peace I've had so many
[1:19:36] times even at work the gods come along
[1:19:39] and say how can you be so calm and
[1:19:41] stuff's going crazy or something's
[1:19:42] messed up or something goes wrong how
[1:19:44] can you stay so calm I said it's peace
[1:19:47] amen that's all it is I I I I don't know
[1:19:51] how to explain it uh I I know I know how
[1:19:53] to get it
[1:19:55] because it's scriptural but I can't give
[1:19:57] it to you I can just tell you how I got
[1:20:00] it it doesn't upset me amen even we had
[1:20:05] the M the manager he just retired we had
[1:20:08] his retirement part party Friday even
[1:20:11] his boss the guy that hired me the the
[1:20:13] the upper guy um he even was talking
[1:20:17] about because I thanked him for hire me
[1:20:19] putting me on this team he said uh he
[1:20:21] saw me as a as a an even kill guy and I
[1:20:25] thought I that was I took that as a
[1:20:27] compliment yes amen because we all get a
[1:20:31] little exasperated sometimes we all get
[1:20:35] beside ourselves sometimes uh and act in
[1:20:38] ways maybe we shouldn't but by the by
[1:20:41] the grace of God we try to stay as even
[1:20:43] as even keill as just keep our minds on
[1:20:46] the Lord yes we keep our minds on God
[1:20:49] and he will keep us in perfect peace now
[1:20:52] when your mind is cluttered with every
[1:20:54] everything else then this doesn't
[1:20:57] work amen you got to keep your eyes and
[1:21:00] your mind on the Lord remember complete
[1:21:04] absorption of Jesus Christ in our being
[1:21:07] complete absorption in our body all that
[1:21:09] we are should be absorbed by Jesus
[1:21:13] Christ everything that we get everything
[1:21:15] that we are should be compl I'm not
[1:21:17] saying that we're monks and I'm not
[1:21:19] saying that but everything about
[1:21:22] everything should be about him right
[1:21:24] number one first and foremost I keep my
[1:21:27] mind on him he will keep you in perfect
[1:21:30] peace when it gets cluttered with all
[1:21:32] this other stuff going on and all the
[1:21:34] things in the world and everything
[1:21:35] that's happening around the world when
[1:21:37] all that stuff gets cluttered in your
[1:21:39] mind
[1:21:40] and then then yeah that your mind starts
[1:21:44] reasoning it starts thinking of things
[1:21:46] and what does the Bible say the first
[1:21:48] scripture we read cast down imaginations
[1:21:51] and reasonings yeah those don't become a
[1:21:54] part of who we are the word becomes a
[1:21:57] part of who we are that's what we follow
[1:21:59] that's what we live by because that's
[1:22:01] who we are amen amen then God keeps us
[1:22:06] in perfect peace yes amen because our
[1:22:09] mind is stayed on him amen stayed on him
