that balancing and getting off these drugs yeah there's a lot there to ask for anyone else have one let's try to i'm trying to be written down but you completely understand if you have to you know make notes of the congregation as well anyone else yes yes um this is maybe a twofold testimony but yet a very much concern this past thursday i took leah to a cardiologist she's been having some pain on her right side and when they ran the ekg and they they checked her heart she the cardiologist said she's in great health and they don't know what's going on should they run some more tests and that was good news when we left the doctor's office this past friday i believe was friday or saturday she had another attack and and it was so painful she she was thinking i might have to call paramedics and i prayed there's power in praise i [Music] but there's something going on and we know the lord is more than able to heal her above all and let us know what's going on pray for her as well like that anyone else do you want testimonies afterwards yeah yeah yeah we'll do we're just uh trying to get the prayer requests right yes sister olivia my niece suffers from my autoimmune tradition and she has been having a lot of issues with it i just want to mess with her her name is marie arson maureen heavenly father we approach you in that most wonderful name the lord jesus christ father yes make it unable for any of us to be here lord god who is shed blood through his grace lord god and we come in that name lord god through that blood to speak to your lord to where you uh could and do

always do not in the way we always expect it lord god or think it's gonna be but you answer lord god you love us uh beyond us understanding lord god even at times lord we don't know like brother dennis said again what you're doing and how you're doing it lord but we take you at your word father we know that you'll bring it to pass lord we ask that you touch our brother here lord god that

flesh struggles lord god with it we know lord god that you're the way that you live in the life lord we surrender all these things into your precious hands the service lord god yes our lives may you be the guest of honor lord god may you help us leave here drawn closer to you first of all and secondly lord to one another lord god is really being concerned about one another's needs and welfare in jesus christ's name we ask it father amen i maybe see it at this time and then i'll read over the written prayer requests here or a testimony this is from sister shelia here she's thanking the lord for answered prayers um i think it was a week or so ago now but the lord made it away from them to get a new car a new used car she said new to them here so but so that the friday after the accident uh so thank the lord for that amen did anyone else have a quick short just testimony here that they like yes many years ago when i was seven years old we pulled into a restaurant late at night my dad had been traveling and and we there must not have been a restaurant on the road because we didn't stop till it felt like about 9 00 8 30 9 30 at night he was feeding us and by that time of being seven i was out of it and i was sitting at the table like this i didn't want to eat i just wanted to sleep and my father says to me honey please straighten up because i was all slumped over and it hurt him you know he knew how it had been on the road and it hurt him and so but i felt like i couldn't let him control me because it was a i don't know it just didn't feel right and so i didn't do it and um from that point on i've been cursed with this slumping stuff and that's will it's right back here is your will center right here and and and i and i've been praying about this for years and that and i'll get temporary relief now it's coming to me just the last few days and i am so sore from all these muscles that have been contracted in the front and stretching them out and sometimes i find myself slumping in order to give myself relief but it's just so i thought maybe i was having a heart attack and it was just so sore along these neck muscles and everything where it's stretching out and god's healing me amen yeah just remind me i'm subconsciously trying to get relief from that pain when they're stretching out amen thank you thank you jesus thank you it takes 21 days to form a human anyone else yes i just need to take this time to uh let y'all know that god is still working in my our son lee's life amen he has restored him to begin with but now he is adding the double portion i talked to him last night it's just like the story of job but we know that job suffered greatly greatly and then my son suffered greatly also but i don't claim that he suffered as bad as joke but i can tell you that god has reinstated him and he is blessing him like god bless job amen amen he just keeps pouring in amen and i thank god so much for that yes all amen i'll just sing another song or two before we have uh a faster come up to putting the word here uh see i was thinking kind of different song with my heart oh let's turn to 686 here [Music] [Music] you are [Music] is you are

always by his spirit amen praise the lord he's so good to us isn't he amen thankful to be here today god richly bless each one of you happy fifth anniversary to the word of god tabernacle yesterday actually yesterday was the fifth anniversary of the actual first service that we had may 15th so um it seems like in some ways it's gone by fast in some ways it's gone by slow but here we are and uh i love all of you appreciate you so much even some who aren't here with us today but i love each one of you so very much and appreciate the lord's goodness amen amen i did come on my mind but i could remember absolutely for sure but raise your hand if you were at the very first service yes all right i got it right then those were the pats for the dennis and sister normal the ones that came to my mind the most uh there was a few i wasn't sure of but um i i think was that it i think that was i think that was it i remember there was four so that's four amen i can graduate now from kindergarten real life count to four please give me a thumbs up good yeah four that's what it was so for amen god's come a long ways with us and i sure do appreciate his goodness and his blessings so as you know we'll gonna have a little meal afterwards next door so don't run off uh everyone's welcome to stay and um and enjoy the food i've got plenty coming i i basted about on 30 people so and it looks like we've got a little more than half of that here the fry hoes are on their way though so that'll help fill the gap pretty good so they're on their way they'll be here hopefully shortly they went by to pick up her mom again for service today so pete please stay and feel free to fellowship we have the room next door as i said the other day from noon till three and uh so we have time to have fellowship and have a good meal and uh and enjoy our times together so amen so god bless you love you appreciate you so much uh thank the lord's goodness in our lives um there's something i wanted to also mention to you uh before i have you stand in us entering into the service i'm not gonna be very long today i had a simple thought on my mind this week and then when i started looking at some things yesterday this is what the lord gave me so this won't be too long just fairly simple message i guess but the other day which would have been sunny before last i meant to do this last sunday but sunday before last uh and our last part of the free will uh series that we had that i mentioned about uh brother branham and the brown tabernacle and some things that unfolded with the ministering there when brother branham left the pulpit to go out on the field and i mentioned that uh about and i mentioned his name then so i might as well mention it now graham snelling uh but i got some of the facts a little off the premise of what i said was still true but when i went to work with brother roger the next day who was the one that relayed to me the the information from his dad who was a deacon at the tabernacle and and those things and of course being a collins and being an integral part of the branham tabernacle for many many years uh he relayed this information to me many years ago and it just came on my heart the other day when when i was talking about it and the way that sometimes people can be uh and make decisions and things that aren't uh really motivated by the holy spirit and the word but um i mentioned about him that brother branham had put him in and that the brothers had taken him out well there's another one that was involved so i want to straighten this story out so that we understand but uh there was a there was a brother before grand snailing that brother branham uh said the lord told him or felt led to put that brother in as the pastor brown tabernacle so so brother branham had this brother as the pastor of branham tabernacle when brother branham was gone these the deacon brothers trustees those that were in charge of the church found out that he had been married before and they voted and kicked him out it came to brother branham and brother brown um which you know you can take it for what it is i'm just telling you the story the way it was given uh and somebody relayed that story to brother brown said they got rid of this brother found out he'd been double married and they kicked him out and brother bantam just put down his head and said i wish they hadn't done that and uh and it wasn't long after that that of course then brother branham put they had graham snelling come in and be the pastor well though i mentioned the ones that uh that had the issue of graham snelling uh had backslid or died in a backslidden condition but it wasn't that it was the first minister all the ones that had made the decision to get rid of the original pastor everyone backslid or died in a backslidden condition now this was before brother rogers dad became a deacon there but every one of them according to what he had been told had died in that backslidden condition or had backslid or been died in that back every one of them that voted to get rid of that first brother you know brother brown put his head down and said i wish they hadn't done that see so got to make sure that we know what the leading of the lord is on on a certain issue sometimes the word of god becomes another effect because of our tradition right and we hold to things so much in church allergy and religion that we forget about the spirit of god and we forget about the moving of the spirit of god you know uh we just need to make sure we stay in contact with that spirit now graham now i got this part of the story right he came in uh made a mistake with the lady brother roger just mentioned and said the word adultery i didn't say that i just said uh he got himself mixed up in a situation with a lady and uh and they came to brother brown and brother branham they prayed about it brother branham got before the people and said brother snelling has apologized he has repented his repentance is sincere and i believe that he should just stay in as the pastor so he stayed in as the pastor after his indiscretion but then after that brother branham found out that he began to get off the word he began to preach things that were contrary to the message the scripture and when he started getting off the word that's when brother branham they got rid of it that's when brother brown said okay that's so the point of that was to understand uh the things that happen in life sometimes uh are are are some sometimes superficial things or we all get caught mistakes and make uh fall or make a mistake or get caught in a trap or something and that wasn't concerning to to brother brandon it wasn't concerning to the lord the holy spirit he fell and made this mistake but what but where the dividing point was to get rid of him from behind the pulpit was when he got off the word right when he started preaching false doctrine that's when it became a problem right so you understand what my my whole point of that was if you were here a couple weeks ago you remember that uh that that was the point of this of the story was to get to that point to understand sometimes we look at something and and we get something so fixed in our minds we get and we get this church allergy and we get this religion and tradition and and all of a sudden you know we think we just cut it off instead of giving time for the holy spirit and the lord to mend him to help it and to make it right we got to take into account the things that the lord is doing right and what god might be doing in the situation see we look at it from one way and then and then we can come through like i said and say oh we'll just pray about it well we'll just put it before the lord let's have prayer meaning but when your mind is already made up and you're already fixated that it's going to be one way you can pray all you want but there's no change in your mind right you're not going to change an angel could come from heaven and try to convince it or change it but it's not going to change if your mind is fixed on it right and you're just all of a sudden well you know he's done and over then that's just the way it's going to be you can pray all you want right you can talk to god all you want but if your mind is made up god's not going to god can't move that and god's a gentleman god's not going to force himself on you right now god's not going to come down with a louisville slugger to alter your opinion about something yeah he's not going to do that you're a free moral agency with a free will see and and in that god trust you in those decisions sometimes we got to make sure well all the time we've got to make sure it's the leading of the holy spirit and god that's moving those decisions in ways that we go and things that we do and have an open mind amen remember what the bible says the bible says to to uh to to have grace to someone to have mercy to someone uh unless you fall in that same temptation right judge not let you be judged for the same judge you meet on somebody that judgment's going to come back to you he said well i never did that yeah but what else did you do over here you say well that's not as bad so now we're getting into the category of big sins and little sins we're getting into the category of that's worse than this if it's sin friend it's sin amen and if you're guilty you're guilty right whether it's this or whether it's that it doesn't matter right you understand so the point of that was being that we never never come to the throne of god with closed mind with a fixed opinion would think well this is just the way it is that's hard and fast done well then what is the grace of god in the mercy of god if that was the case then we would still be living under the law but that's not the case the grace of mercy the grace and mercy of god so many times will come in and want to help the situation the issue and solve it out just like brother adam said that graham had had had repented and had apologized and he made it right and has straightened it all out and brother bantam allowed him to stay as the pastor abandoned tabernacle under those conditions understand amen so i know people say wow how could that be i don't know i don't know because my my first thought would be yeah he needs to go right that would be my first thought but then when the grace of god coming into repentance and and and god was merciful who can question that right i'm not going to question the mercy of god in your life because i don't want him questioning in my life i don't want the mercy of god question in my life if i don't want it questioned in my life i'm sure not going to question it in your life right if god can cover as the song and saying the chiefess of sinners then he's god he can do whatever he wants right amen he he's god so who am i to say that's just the grace of god but if you really want to try to find the mind of god you need to come to god with an open heart with an open mind allowing god to change that opinion or that feeling or that free will moral agency that you have so that it fits god's will right not uh not somebody's but it fits god's will that's the thing that we want the most uh that's the thing that matters the most amen is the will of god that's what matters see and that's where we need to be with him and that's what matters see amen that's so that's that's the whole point of the story don't get things so fixed in your mind don't get so much religion and tradition and and and churchilogy that that it's just the hard and fast right it's like i said there's people out there today i know people uh there and brother branham said it this way oh my grandpa was a baptist and my path he was a baptist and i'll be a baptist till i die and my kids will be a baptist until he hits six foot underground and that's just the way it is right well it's the same thing some people say well i go to this church it's my church i'll never leave this church so no matter what happens or how much goes on or whatever is preached behind the pull pitch you're going to stay right there but some people will do that because it gets so much church allergy saying let the lord leave that's the whole the whole point let your free will be molded by god's will in your life amen and then you'll find yourself in a position where god's blessings are are continuing to abound in your life yes and that's what we want we want the blessings of the lord abounding see right we want the lord's blessings abounding in our homes and and in our church here and in our family see that's where we want we want god to continue to move and bless us and that's what we want the most isn't it the will of amen and that's the most important thing so that's that's where we stand today yes amen and i appreciate god's goodness to us so yes amen let's stand to our feet now i hope i got that cleared up i wanted to make sure that the facts of that were said correctly i i i didn't miss the premise of it but i wanted to make sure and get the facts of the story correct so that there was no misunderstanding um or anything like that and i think actually the power of the story had more merit once i remembered my brother roger telling me the rest of the story or the fullness of the story so it helped me understand that but let's turn over our bibles to first corinthians the food is about a half hour early but um we're going to still have church anyway but like i said we won't be too long half hour or so and and see where the lord takes it from there so first corinthians chapter 12. amen first corinthians chapter 12 verse 12. before we read let's just bow our heads if we could for another word of prayer precious lord jesus we're so very thankful god of your blessings and your love to us and lord for bringing us here once again lord to feast upon the precious word of the hour father that you would reveal this word to us and show us lord where we may be falling short and where we need to come shored up lord with you and for this word to become us lord that we would become that word lord that everything that we do god would would would emunate the the spirit of jesus christ in the word of the hour thank you lord for the blessings of of this church and for these people and lord for the time that you've given us lord in these past five years lord as i said it seems like in some ways it's gone by so fast and in some ways it seems like it's been real slow but you've always been with us every step of the way and we know that and we believe that and i thank you lord just from the little humble beginnings and lord the same four people lord that we're here at our first service are here today and god i'm just so thankful for them and every one of them here and those who may be streaming god bless them exceedingly lord i thank you father for the blessings you give us lord to be able to enjoy the time and fellowship with one another as we fellowship with you god we believe lord that that is the that is your love to us extended to us god is to be able to have one another and to love one another and be together as a family thank you father for all the grace and mercy and the love that you shine upon our pathway every day of our life for never leaving or forsaking us god we rebuke every demonic spirit lord that may be here to hurt hindu or filtrate this service in any way that you would get the glory and the honor for all that is said and done we thank you god for the word thank you for the revelation of it and praise everything we could do now will be pleasing to you in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen amen amen amen first corinthians 12 verse 12. let's just begin reading we'll just read a few verses here and let you be seated for as the body is one and have many members and all the members of that one body being many are one body so also is christ for by one spirit are we all baptized into one body whether we be jews or gentiles whether we be bond or free and have been all made to drink into one spirit for the body is not one member but many you can be seated if you like and i'm just going to talk about and this is the subject that came on my heart on the body the body because of the situation here and being our anniversary time and us as a family together and us as the church together we read here that paul is telling the corinthian church that the body of christ is one body it has many members but it's just one body and you know within that one body is the body that we have here today inside the one body of christ is many members we inside that body are one body as a church together amen we are one body fit inside the body of jesus christ we are many members but we are a body we are one together everyone that comes in and calls themselves a part of this church and attendance and tithes and this is your church and i'm your pastor and uh we're all together as a family you fall under that protection of the of that blood of this church and of jesus christ you all fall under that protection so because we're a part of that family and the blood of jesus christ of course protects the entire body of christ but we are just a microcosm of a little bit of of of what god does internationally around the world not just in tucson or in arizona or in the united states but all over the world god has little pockets just like this some are larger some are smaller but they're all families and they're all families together you know we we rarely see and and hopefully we won't see it very much if at all but you know there is a process that's in the scripture that brother branham talks about that that is taking out from under the blood well that process is exactly what i'm talking about of the blood that protects or that is over this congregation as a as a body as a family that uh pastor the headship and the people are all together as one body and when and when one unconfessed sin comes in it can ruin the body yeah it can mess up the whole church brother adam said it could cause this church to bitterly fail yes just one unconfessed sin so that process if someone lives in open sin and is unwilling to repent and has sinned against the church and against the people in the church and things and and they're unwilling to repent and and they just go out and live and and unrepented living whatever life they they want to live then there's that process of taking that person out from under the blood because the blood because if they were a part of this church if they're a part of a church and they fall under the auspice of that and that blood for that church that church and that blood is still responsible for that person so you see that's why that process is instituted so that that person no longer is under that same protection amen so if it's not under that same protection then the church body that local church body is not responsible for that that happens by that person outside or out from under the blood right you understand so that at that point when i know this has taken a turn i absolutely didn't have in my mind or expect but we're going with it once it's out from under the blood then too according to the scripture then god can or satan can begin to deal with that person or god forgive to deal with that person by using the devil right because they're out from under the blood they're out from under the protection of of the church they're out from under the protection of that blood that's where satan can get to them and god can use that tool to bring that person back and that's the whole point of it is to bring the person back it's not to make their lives miserable it's not to send them or doom them to hell is to make them and bring them to a point that they'll come back to where they're supposed to be under the protection of the blood in the body of that uh current church family right that's the whole point see but that family you understand that's the body that point of the body is what i'm trying to make and we're a part of that body paul talked about the body as a whole has many members and all the members he talked about jews and gentiles he talked about free and bond but we're all a part of that same body you know you look sometimes you think well uh uh i i i feel kind of like a misfit myself uh i i feel like sometimes that um you know even though i was an associate with brother green the tabernacle for 15 years uh that i just feel kind of like a misfit you know and and and sometimes when you feel that way uh it's because god wants to lead you or put you in a position where you belong right because that because god wants you if you're his child he wants you in a certain place right and and the gentleness of the sweetness of the holy spirit will manipulate you and move you in a certain way so that it brings you to a place again that doesn't negate your free will because you still have a decision but it will move you and guide you into the place that he wants you to be and see if you're pliable enough and if your heart is soft enough and if you're desiring to have the holy spirit move you and shape you and to have uh his will in your life then he's going to be able to move you in that way he's going to be able to put you in that position he's going to be able to bring you where you're supposed to be i believe that's why all of us are here today absolutely what the leading of the lord right whatever criticism whatever uh uh putting down people may do or whatever they may say about you or this church or me let it all follow me that's fine but it doesn't matter as long as i'm right with my lord right as long as i'm in his perfect will i'm not here to service other people's wills for my life no i'm here to service the will of god for my life and if god is shaping me and moving me and making us in a place where we're supposed to be to fulfill that purpose god give us then praise the lord that's where we're supposed to be and god will bless you there amen god will meet you there and bless you there yes and that's why and i believe saints that's why we've been seeing so many things happening and the spirit of god moving in our services and and the miracles and the things taking place in our lives in our families and in our homes and things that's happening in testimonies that are one right after the other i thought i thought maybe even having a little testimony service of things that that god may have done for you in the past a few years but i felt like that that this is what the lord wanted me to talk on so if you have a testimony though please you're more than welcome to give it when i get done but you know we all have something that's in our heart that the lord's been doing for us especially how we see god moving in our lives lately and in our families and and and some things you just see maybe a grain at a time it might just be a grain of sand at a time but you see the hand of god moving on it and you just have patience and you trust the lord and you believe god's going to make it work together for our good because he promised us he would do it because we love him with all of our hearts yes amen we have confidence in him and we believe in him amen but if we are one body and and and tighten it and brought together and i've said this before and i'll say it again and god bless you precious sisters for having your prayer group and getting together for lunch and spending time together and fellowship and uh you don't know how good that does my heart how that makes me when my wife comes says oh we're going to lunch how that just settles in my heart like a dove coming on a lamb amen it feels so good so appreciate it but uh and things like today and the fellowship it just means so much to me because that's the unity and that's the fellowship and that's the longing the loving that god wants his family to have for one another but understand satan is going to do everything he can to disrupt that yeah say he's going to do everything he can to try to come against that or hurt or hinder that in whatever way he can look at this if you go down i was going to read this whole part but just for sake of time just uh pieces of this now same chapter but on the 20 in the 24th verse first corinthians 12 24 for our comely parts have no need but god hath tempered the body together having given more abundant honor to that part which lacked amen well when the body come together of course in the day of pentecost and and afterwards in the book of acts when the body of christ came together nobody was wanting and nobody was excess but everybody was everybody was happy and everything was going fine and and their lives were great so the bot because the body becomes tempered together and the nicest of fire come and tried the light of the holy spirit and tried to keep back a part of that well you know what happened in eye since the fire right so but the bodies being tempered together see tempered the body together having more abundant honor to that part which lack that there should be no schism amen anybody know what a schism is schism is something that divides yes a schism is something that is meant to bring separation amen it's sort of like a it's a derivative of a word called shim a shim is something that you stick between usually two pieces of wood sometimes i balance my bookshelf with a shim because it's leaning forward and i need to put something under it so that it sets it up right but i'm sure if you took the door frames off of these doors there's probably shims inside there to separate the frame from from the uh uh from the actual door and because the door frame just sits in there and the door will be locked sided and it'll be it'll be uh uh caddy wampus and it won't open it won't close and it'll scrape hero straight there so you put a little shim that is meant to divide it starts at the end and just a tiny little smaller than a toothpick on the very end or right about the size of a toothpick a shim is on the very end those who don't know construction or anything like that might understand but it's a piece of wood about that long uh some numbers shorter longer but but at the very end it starts just in a very small tiny little section just like the size of a toothpick but then once it goes back towards the end of the shim it gets to about that thick maybe a quarter of an inch or so maybe even a little more than a quarter of an inch it'll get about that thick well the point of that is to separate is to divide the door frame from the door so that it can it can level the door up so it doesn't scrape and so that's a good process of hashem right but you understand that the point of the shim is at the very tip it just comes in as the smallest tiny little minute uh end on that shim and that's exactly what the devil does the devil will try to come in with the end of that shem just as small just as tiny just for the purpose of trying to shove that thing right through to bring a shism or division between the people yes and that's exactly what satan will try to do they'll try to do it to you to me to us to the family to us to me whatever and bring that division that separation to divide and to separate but it starts with just the smallest little thing friend if something happens if things come up if there's cross words said or if there's things that are offensive or something let's deal with it right amen i mean in small parts we've done that here but let's deal with it amen if somebody hurts you somebody offends you let's deal with it let's get it straight i don't want any chism friend no division no separation i i don't want you to feel like there's anybody in here that's in here now or comes to this congregation or part of this church that you couldn't go up and shake your hand hug your neck say i love you brother love you sister now of course the brothers and sisters don't you understand right but uh sister to sister brother brother say i love you i appreciate you i'm glad you're in my life i'm glad you're pro whatever and mean it you know brother branham said that there will people there'll be people that that they'll say i love you brother branham and he said they'll hug me around the neck he said but if they had a knife they'd stab me in the back now that's a prophetic gift that could know what the intent of that person's heart is i don't have that in that gift and you probably don't either although i have hugged some people that i felt like if they had a knife who's to have me in the back but but understand that can't be you right amen don't be that person right that if you hug them or something that you are ready to stab them in the back or ready at the first chance to try to spread gossip or hurt that person's character in any way character assassination is one of the most demonic things a church has to deal with that people in christianity has to deal with it is a horrible situation is a lie to hell amen he's saying it's right brother newton but that doesn't make it right you're spreading it you're talking about it you're slandering doesn't make it right tearing down that person's character doesn't make it right even if they did do it right right it doesn't make it right amen amen the love of god will bring together not separate right now the only separation there is is from belief from unbelief and sometimes god does that sometimes god has to use the word to bring a separation between belief and unbelief but friends we are brothers and sisters we love one another we're all part of the same body of jesus christ do you plan to get up there and you have occupy one end of heaven and the person you hate occupy the other end amen ain't gonna be that way i'm sorry it doesn't work like that if you go up there with hatred in your heart toward anybody friend you're not going to be there because there's nothing there but perfect love yeah and don't step and don't say here tell me that you're going to get perfect love when you get a body change doesn't happen that way a body change only separates you from this body you keep the same character that you have now that you when you get in that new body amen same if you hate here you'll hate there that's right if you love here you'll love there that's right so my point is don't be that person that says i would stab them in the back don't be that person even if somebody hurts you forgive them let forgiveness abound and forgive that person say brother you don't know what they did to me well i know what they did to jesus and he said father forgive right amen amen so you i'm sorry you don't have an excuse it's like the the testimony today uh about uh sister pat about lee going through and comparing him to job and she admitted said i'm sure lee didn't go through what job had to go through but similar and i'm sure we've all had our valleys where we felt like job at times or another but but to understand but that the lord brought from that place and and took him out of that amen so so who is legal to blame who is job going to blame who are we gonna blame right even if you most people blame god that's that's why they leave him because because well god how could god allow this to happen they leave god they leave the body they leave the family you see but i don't know you don't know what they did to me it doesn't matter what they did to you no you don't know what people have done to me either yes well some of you may know some of what's been done to me but you know we don't know but we do know one thing that love covert the multitude of sins in fact one place psalm says love covers all sin now that's the love of god not not worldly love right worldly love says oh yeah i'll love you as long as you agree with me right oh you're part of our group as long as you say what we say right oh we love you and we want to help you do everything we can for you but boy as soon as you turn around and you say something contrary they'll jump on you like a bunch of rabbit jackals feast off the carcass of whoever amen that's exactly and unfortunately i hate to say it but that's exactly some things i've experienced and seen in this message friend my my message today don't be that no don't be that person don't be that group don't be those ones yes say i promise you satan is going to do everything he can to take that little corner that slim of the shiver and stick it in there to try to get you to hate one another right that's right bringing negativity to then all you got to say is negative about somebody just waiting for a little juicy section of concept that you can spread about so-and-so amen i can't even begin to tell you the things that i know about other people that i would never tell somebody else i had to correct a brother one time the tucson tabernacle well several times but i'm thinking of one specific instance and the brother called me later he said oh please don't tell brother green i said brother if there's any corrections needs to be done god's going to do it not me right true and i never have never will of course brother green's gone now but never would amen it's still me i wouldn't do it right nor would i because that what what purpose would that serve right you see it and it doesn't matter if that person has done something to you or not get past that let the holy spirit let the love of god come in and let the grace of god take over and say if it weren't for the grace of god there go i exactly amen amen don't let that shift there should be no schism in the body yes but that members should have the same care one for another amen the same care one for another that there's no division no separation yes you know a lot of times we're unwilling to accept how difficult this can be sometimes unwilling to accept and and i'll probably i'm gonna have to close here shortly but i'll probably do this in a greater way just a message for the fifth anniversary but sometimes we don't realize how difficult it is to be a christian yeah how difficult it is to coexist with others to coexist with with brothers and sisters of the same church the same faith same belief the same message to coexist together because the enemy is always out to try to divide it to separate and destroy always that's this whole point to drive that division to drive that separation between between brothers and sisters and all he needs is just to get that little crack open that's all he needs to do just don't don't give place to the devil ephesians says don't give place to the devil amen i believe it's actually it might be right here close to what i'm getting ready to read i'm trying to remember amen yeah uh ephesians 4 27 never neither give place to the devil be ye angry sin not lest not the let not the sun go down upon your wrath neither give place to the devil don't allow the devil to get in there at all don't entertain him praise the lord but i want to read from ephesians 4 1 4 ephesians 4 1 therefore the prisoner of the lord beseech you that you walk worthy of the location wherewith you are called with all lowliness and meekness with long suffering for bearing one another in love endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace there is one body and one spirit even as you are called in one hope of your calling one lord one faith one baptism one god and father of all who is above all through all in you all now look at the look at the challenge laid on the ephesian church most probably the most perfect church in the bible look the what was laid to the ephesian church by paul this was the warning he gave very much amen look at this he said with all loneliness and meekness with long suffering for bearing one another in love endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace so what we're looking for and what my encouragement is to you today is to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace amen amen keep the unity of the spirit and the bond of peace that's what we're to do yes stay unified stay unified to christ stay unified to the body of christ internationally and unified to the local assembly that we have here now now you feel led to do what you i'm not trying to say you've got to stay here i'm not saying that you know me better than that right but what i'm saying is if we're here and we are a part of this right then we then we do what we we keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace now how are we to do that now this may be a little rough and i'm going to go through this kind of quickly but listen very closely because the prescription paul give us is in verses two and three with all lowliness amen that means we not have to humble ourselves right amen and sometimes to bite your tongue and to keep spreading gossip let's put it that way yes you have to be humble yeah you have to humble yourself with all humility or lowliness and meekness meekness is mild gentle amen to be mean with long suffering long suffering is to have patience i doubt if i asked anybody to raise their hand they had patience very very few if anybody's hand would go up we struggle probably very hard most of us on a daily basis basis with our patients right and of course society hasn't made that any easier with automobiles that go 100 miles 200 miles an hour with planes that go several hundred miles an hour you could be across the country in half a day nowadays amen i told you before it's like it's it's robbed the patience of people uh people used to just sit on the front porch and just enjoy sitting i i mean do people still do that or they're just so busy doing everything else or no patience or whatever has to be done because there's a lot to be done there's always a lot to be done people say i gotta do this because there's a lot to be done but you know what if you do that tomorrow there's still gonna be a lot to be done so if you skip the day there's still going to be a lot to be done if you work real hard today there's still going to be a lot to be done sometimes it just takes a little patience always seeking god first amen putting god first in every seek ye therefore first the kingdom of god then all these things would be added up to you it was one of the uh one of the messengers back i can't remember luther or who it was but uh uh i i i read somewhere i heard somewhere he made this statement he said if i don't take three hours and pray every morning i don't have enough time in my day to do what i need to do now that's just as illogical as believing that 90 of your funds will go as far as 100 it's illogical it doesn't work how does taking three hours out of your day give you more time to do what you need to do you know how it's how you spend it right amen it's how you spend those three hours yes amen it's how you spend that ten percent yes that's when god can take it and multiply yes so to understand that that that that's how god works to make all of this come about in our lives is to understand and trust him and everything patience very hard they used to uh women used to have this big metal thing in the corner of their kitchen they'd have to go outside chop down the wood have to cord up the wood and have to take the wood put it in this big metal thing they didn't have to build a fire inside the big metal thing and wait for it to get hot enough to put some food on it so it can start getting warm that's how they cooked how many days and hours did that take a lot of prep work of course with the wood but just from the fact of saying the wood is already in there you still got to build the fire you got to wait for it to get hot you got to do all this nowadays we stick stuff in this little metal box we push a button and we sit there and wait for it to get done because it just can't wait two minutes to cook this meal i can have an entire meal in two minutes well that's just too long i want it minute to hand and we sit there and wait for it to get done let's just can't wait patience our patients have been robbed lord help us yeah and then what's what's the what's the michael used to dance around with this uh little bunny that sang and said that he wants patience and he wants it right now that's kind of the way it is but we got to be patient we got to hum but be humble gentle and meet towards one another not overbearing not demonstrative not not matter of fact you don't make yourself build yourself up higher than don't act towards somebody like your condon sending down to their level just to communicate with them i'm not saying anybody does that but you understand see be humble be meek have patience with one another amen be patient forbearing one another in love forbearing is to endure and suffer [Music] suffer now how many of us willing to suffer because of your brother or sister right amen well that's what it says if you want if you want to keep the unity of the spirit of the bond of peace that's what you're going to do you're going to suffer you're going to endure amen you're going to you're going to endure forbearing endeavoring now endeavoring is to give diligence or labor work out give work labor diligence suffering patient humility well first of all none of those will happen if we're not humbling ourselves to the lord into whatever his purpose or humbling ourselves to one another amen being humble towards one another and letting the lord help each one of us in that same spirit right and when god does that then god then then we can keep and god keeps the body tight knit together satan will come in and satan will try to shake it and rattle it but god can keep it together that way see yes yeah right i used to read this every year to the church in my church in saint augustine i don't know that i've maybe read it once here but at the beginning of every year i read it and it's a good reminder so as i close i'm going to read this it is a word to the church christ and mystery god revealed love one another above everything so this is my this is my exhortation my final to hear today love one another above everything love one another no matter what the devil tries to say now you're all one great big sweet group now but remember my warning see satan won't let it stay that way no sir he'll shoot everything if he has to bring somebody in to make his target he'll bring in some critic or some unbeliever set him down and cause him to fellowship with one of the quietness and things then he will shoot that guy with some kind of poison stuff and he'll start through the church with it don't you take sides with it now this is just an example brother brown's given it doesn't have to be somebody coming in and shooting some poison okay this happens in so many different facets don't let that poison come and that dark hit you don't don't don't let your ear be a garbage dump right right and he'll start to the church with it don't you take sides don't you have nothing to do with anything else you stay right loving sweet kind to one another pray for that man that he'll be saved too pray for him or her he says right ever who it is just pray for them and stick with one another and stay with your pastor he's the shepherd god give him uh he's a shepherd and you give him respect he'll lead you through he's ordained of god to do so now do you remember that the enemy will come right and when he does just clean that much coast together and the one that the devil is using for an enemy he'll either just clean that much closer uh uh he'll either get out or he will come in and be one of you that's all don't never clan among one another or talk or make yourself clannish we are one i couldn't say left hand i'm mad at you i'm going to take you away because you're not a right hand he's my left hand i wanted to stay right there even the tip of my finger i want to be right there every part of my body stay right there and god wants us as a body of believers to stay right exactly with one another now you've got tapes on that you've got tapes on what we believe you've got tapes on discipline the church uh how we believe ourselves behave ourselves in the church how we uh how we got to come here together sitting together in heavenly places don't stay home if god is in your heart you can't hardly wait for them doors to open out yonder to get in here to fellowship with your brothers and sisters if you don't feel that way then i'll tell you it's time you got to pray in them because we're in the last days where the bible exalted us that much more even as we see that day approaching love one another with christian love divine love assemble ourselves together in heavenly places in christ jesus and love one another this will all men know you're my disciples when you have love one for the other that's right stay right together if the brother you think he's a little wrong or sister say lord don't ever let a root of bitterness spring up causing it which actually that that's actually where i got the subtitle from my book i saw my brother richard giberti one time which helped me tremendously get the book written and and all and he said you really should have a subtitle he said the root could mean anything see the roots all the lord gave me for the book he said you really should have a subtitle with satan and el guardo canelo why don't you pronounce that sorry butcher i'm sure on on on oracle just right behind the tabernacle we were sitting there eating and all of a sudden this dropped into me right here the poison acid of bitterness the root of bitterness the root of bitterness the poison acid of bitterness amen don't let that root of bitterness spring up because it'll affect him and it'll take the christ right out of your life that poison acids and malice and malice and jealousy and hatred that'll just take the holy spirit right away from you it'll run him from the tabernacle it'll kill the spirit of god or drive it away from here hurt your pastor it'll do everything don't you let it do it you just wax that much closer together take the buckle as the brother testified minister here hand that bucket buckle see on the whole armor of god put it on tight it up move right up closer together love one another anyhow talk nice to one another say nice things about one another and god will bless you amen and god will bless you yes amen god will bless you the great warning he gave to his church yes i believe it's something that we take to heart today that we that we look to and and and and take seriously you say oh it's one so wonderful i think about that and i pray when i'm praying sometimes and and i i'm thanking god for all the miracles he's done for us and all the things all the healings and keeping safe and protection and and all the the the hedge of god that he keeps around us safe and healthy and and i thank him for that so many times and then and then and then i start remembering lord but keep us keep us close to you yes keep us close to you as we stay close together each one of us stay close together as we stay close to him and don't let that devil come in don't let that chism come in don't let anything come in there that'll bring a division or some kind of a little sting or something just let it go away pray to the lord pray with that person whatever it needs to be to keep that all together together is how we conquer the enemy amen one coal out by itself will surely should shortly die but when it's in a nice roaring fire it stays all nice and blaze and hot very much amen it's a good place you can come in and warm yourself with you warm yourself by i tell you i look so forward to coming here and feeling your spirit and knowing that we're here together and that warmness of the fellowship and the spirit of god together it makes me feel so good amen just just the blessings of god and to see you here today too uh makes me feel so blessed just and even even reminiscing and going back and remembering that first service and the four people that were there are still here including of course my wife and myself tabitha tabitha was going to brother mark stroke orbs and you know mike was in back east i think and stuff and so anyway uh it was just i was total of six of us uh but god's been so good god has been so good he's blessed us so much i thank him so much we don't know what tomorrow holds friend amen we may not know what the lord's gonna have for us tomorrow amen amen but i know he's going to hold it amen amen and hold you in it praise the lord and i'm thankful for that god's so good to see you love him amen praise the lord let's stand if we could i had intentionally taken those few minutes at the beginning of uh of this to correct uh the error i had made before on the story that i told you but i felt it was imperative that i make that right yeah amen i wanted to sing this little chorus 271 271 if you have your songbook there we'll just sing this once or twice through [Music] we'll just sing the chorus of it amen 271 [Music] as we [Music] foreign [Music] is with jesus amen praise the lord jesus had an announcement to make to you if you'd like to make plans the northern arizona family camp is going to

very much so amen and remember these announcements and um seems like i'm missing something of the buildings the same things going on with that right now just continue to remember to pray for the situation as a whole i can't i i you know i talked to the lord about it but i haven't got any direct leadership other than that as of now but when something like this happens i can't help but feel there's something else going on right there's a reason why this is being delayed like it is i don't know right right not prophesying i i just uh i'm just telling you what's on my heart so so please just pray for that if you would we're all a part of this and all the part of the same i'm i'm you know it's working out fine here but i don't want to stay here but the lord's doing something so whatever it is we just want to step into it right yes two things um where are we going after this room and what time can we go into it you're going right now and it's right next door okay and the second thing is i want i'm considering i wanted to run it by you first if we could put a little sign in the foyer announcing that we're having church services here so that people that blow through the mayor maybe the christians that are missing having service on a sunday can come in or people that aren't you know yeah okay absolutely okay thought about that too it's a great idea can you run it by the desk and um i'll ask them i don't think they'll care we'll probably have to keep it out of the aisle but it'll be where people can see it i don't have a computer so i can't make a sign that's okay okay thank you okay great for israel amen well yeah absolutely um yeah there's a there's a whole lot going on it made me think about uh a lot of things that's going on that's part of it when they say peace peace sudden destruction right a sign before trump went out of office they signed four peace agreements between israel and arabs four they hadn't had peace like that whatever maybe and now all of a sudden you see what's happening now it's by a different group it's not it's not a it's not a violation of one of the four treaties those four treaties are holding this is a whole different arab group uh the united states gave them a half a billion dollars and they took that half a billion dollars and went to iran and bought a bunch of rockets to shoot over to israel now israel's retaliating and it's uh it's a situation uh i'm seeing and i want to make this a part of a whole other message but there's a lot a lot lot more evidence and videos and things of uh stuff flying around up there amen nobody knows what it is except for the bride yes amen maybe think about that meeting in the air he was singing today yes amen they're flying around up there brother brown just said don't worry about a little children pick you up one of these days yes amen anyway we'll just leave that for another time but absolutely brother pat you're right amen anyone else okay remember uh if you brought food beverage or food dessert beverage or what there's plenty of room to set up on the side i don't know how they set up the food uh so when you walk in the counter is on the left-hand side yeah the food's towards the middle and put the desserts towards the front on the left side of the juice machine okay get that so let's set the center perfect their food's already set up and it's set on this side on this side so when you walk in the food that's going to be served or well it's help yourself they're not serving us is on the left-hand side towards the end so the left-hand side as you walk in is where mike has said you can put your drinks desserts and that to eat okay does that sound all right okay um and they have that all it should be all set up is ready to go amen i love you i appreciate you i wanted to do something for you uh as a church as a congregation i was hoping a few more might be here but uh it's my gift to you and i pray the lord bless you richly so for the dentist would you dismiss us and pray for the food so as soon as it's helped yourself they're not serving you so everything should be there but so when you leave here you can go in and help yourself and sit down and start eating uh so brother dennis is going to bless the food as well thank you lord for this time of gathering together like precious faith yes dwelling together in unity lord thank you for the message you spoke to my heart lord that it's a time to live your life to be dead to ourselves yes to be out of the way that you may finish the work that you have started in us and i read even as our pastor brought it out in a sermon i read today as paul said oh no man nothing but to love one another yes and lord that's very important to love with sincerity with purity without
