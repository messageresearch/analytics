spirit amen thank you Lord Jesus [Music] praise the Lord where would we be without him Saints that's right what could we do without him if he wasn't here all over us and keeping us alive what would we do by my mind amen you ever look in retrospect of your life look back at the things that the Lord has done for you look back and when you weren't even serving him and you could just see the hand of God moving in your life bringing you to certain places and causing certain things to happen and sometimes you might have thought it was the most disastrous thing in your life but God made it work out together for your good and bring you right around to this point you look back and all we can do is just say thank you Lord Jesus yes amen and just worship Him Hallelujah just worship Him amen we'll want to go to the Lord in prayer now amen take any prayer requests I didn't have any myself this morning we do want to continue to remember um thank you buddy we do want to continue to remember um brother Noel and sister Shirley they're still in India and um and things are going well he sends me emails every once in a while if anybody would like to have those emails I can forward them to you sometimes they're a little lengthy but if you want to read them it's basically just him telling where they're at and where they're going and who they're ministering to and the results and things like that so if that's something that anybody wants to have it forward until you just let me know or put a note or something and thank you buddy I'll just send them to you so that you can um that you can read it for yourself so but please remember them in prayer if you would amen the Lord would just continue to move upon them and I know I mentioned to you I sent a text uh while I was at I believe it was the last time I was out of town that Brother Gary Vogel had passed away uh failed to mention something about it last week I know they had a memorial service while I was I believe it was while I was out of town uh so please remember Sister Annette the Vogel family if you will Amen in prayer as well uh also I believe this is from Sister Matisse she just wrote down uh for a young man uh let's see here it says for a young man who stole property uh with 15-year prison sentence uh if police get him is that correct yes please catch him he was uh he has I guess or was has brain damage two three years ago uh in terms of doing wrong things please pray for uh that he returns the the items back to the owner he is a homeless man you know his name yes but I want to withhold it okay that's fine amen let this do remember him God knows it God knows who he is so we remember that request of prayer amen anyone have an unspoken request in your heart he said Lord Lord knows all parts today let's stand to our feet if we could we just take these Deeds to the Lord welcome to announce the Lord and then those who have come in a little bit later brother Dennis if you take these needs to the Lord of course but I appreciate Lord Jesus with our hearts and heads and reverence to a great and almighty God Lord we want to be humble as we present our prayer requests before you yes Lord I can recall what the prophet said it's not how big we think we can become business how little yes that's the only way you can amen oh Lord we know the scripture says help us he did exalt us himself shall be a base and he that humbles himself should be exalted yes for God resists the proud and giveth Grace unto the humble and Lord there's so many that that think they have something uh even a A Gift of Gab or whatever and Lord if it's not totally surrendered to you lord it's their own abilities will fail you at the end and Lord we are needy people father and I can recall one time there was a Roman Centurion in that was had some great Authority and he sends his servants to speak to you Lord that one of his servants was sick and and needed a healing touch and when you when he spoke to that Centurion father you heard him say that you're not worthy to come under my roof but just speak the word yes and my servant shall be healed amen and Lord you said I have not found so great of a faith in Israel as this man this Centurion and Lord where is our faith when does it lie father Lord we don't have to love defeated lives it's for the promise that we live to know our privileges when we get away from the word when we stray from the truth that's when that enemy defeats us that's when we can't hardly look up to see the bottom but father it's not your um it's not our fight it's your fight it's not our our Battleship battle father and Lord when it gets rough and it gets tough and we're walking in the lows of valleys Lord that's when you and help us to recognize father the Lord to grow that extra mile to seek you more diligently than ever before yes to stay with your word there's only one way we can stay with your word it's to let your holy spirit will live and bring us through to your word the very word that you wrote you cannot deny any part of it and when we feel that we are denying it it's not your holy spirit it's the LIE of the enemy that's keeping us from your truths that are been presented this morning this man that needs Deliverance in the name of Jesus Christ he's running from you father catch him let the let the Justice be done let him fall all even now underground they commit his heart his life to you and do what he needs to do that's right and Lord all the other requests all that need a healing touch father we come boldly because we can identify it with that Centurion Lord we have the faith to claim healing whatever we have needed and for our loved ones we call you understand that Great and Mighty physician or the high priest that can be touched by the feelings of my own friends and with your stripes we are healed we claim victory we claim healing we claim Deliverance yes Lord there's many are going through mental battles but through um mental distresses through uh depression and anxiety whatever it may be we claim delivers in the name of Jesus space Satan get your hands off of God's Property we adjure you in the name of Jesus Christ to leave these people we call them soon for for victory in Jesus and father and all the unspoken prayer requests you know his heart Lord may you just grant him their heart's desire may it be above all father to stay with your word yes to claim your promises Lord You're Not Gonna it's like the prophet said it's not the big things we do for God it's the little things we leave undone it's not the great Revelations we might not understand it's the little things where we fail you and those little things will keep us out of the kingdom of God granted father bless our our pastor and a godly man that Waits on you to use them to speak to our hearts to give us that bread of life that we need at this time to grow stronger in faith to grow and to have a life that's worthy of the Gospel yes right amen Lord in your name and pray the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen amen praise the Lord you can be seated if you'd like amen praise the Lord Brother Danny wrote a praise report here that I want to read to you uh it says last Tuesday I was driving on River Road uh just past Hacienda Del Sol I stopped because the car in front of me suddenly stopped when I looked in my mirror I saw this full full-size truck not stopping and he rear end he rear-ended me and bounced to the side another car hit the truck then another car hit that one uh I pulled over and with the and by the grace of God my car wasn't damaged praise the Lord just some scratches just some scratch marks uh the police as usual didn't come right away and the people with damaged Vehicles told me yeah it wouldn't do any good to stay so I left and proceeded to my destination so praise the Lord amen amen thank you Jesus yes amen the Lord blessed and touched him kept his vehicle good running amen the Lord's mindful of our ever need amen praise the lordis has a testimony as well I got off the bus today at um I got off the bus today at um I don't know down there somewhere and I was and I was walking up and um and it was just thinking about how um I was sure to trying to walk in Both Worlds at the same time you know what I mean and and I crossed in this little lady was coming along and she was all dusty and she had her little and I saw a little lip glue and I said to her soon I saw it and I couldn't let it go and he said you know I said is everything all right and she just melted and I just put my arms around her and she quartered her and maybe you can keep her in prayer and uh so I I counseled her and she said thank you so much amen and this is what I want to share with you soon thank you for treating me like I'm a human being right amen you know Saints a lot of times that's all people are looking for today A lot of times people are distressed and discouraged and I just looking to be noticed amen be treated as a human I guess you fall off the dog sister Sheila you made it praise the lord it's a little late because she had four dogs around her trailer or something so uh but thank the Lord kept them at Bay so yeah psalm 107. in that city where the lamb is the light [Music] place where we're going Saints amen [Music] there's a country far beyond the Starry Sky there's a zero That Never Comes tonight [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] come on come on eternity without enough then our tear shall see forever [Applause] I am

[Music] favorite goes on I've Got a Mansion over there amen amen praise the Lord Jesus that's my destination Saints praise the Lord that's all of our Eternal destinations with the lamb is the light amen praise the Lord Jesus amen I mean looking forward to that amen amen yes praise the lord it's what we live for that's why we're here that's why we're doing the Lord's will amen and being led by his spirit and wherever he calls us to go and whatever he calls us to do yes amen by his perfect will amen praise the Lord this all stand now if we could amen turn in our Bibles to Genesis chapter 1. amen the Lord willing we'll try to leave all four weeks or pick up where we left off last week that of course we'll start with Genesis 1 1. this will be the new beginning part 18. we're almost done those who may uh be looking looking maybe to the end of this we are almost done yeah so praise the Lord just a couple more services I was looking at it unless the Lord changes something probably two to three more services of uh Beyond this one so probably a couple more into this one so amen new beginning that is true every day it ain't God opened my eyes to see another beautiful day let's just bow our heads if we could before we read this uh the word of God here Lord Jesus we're indeed grateful again Lord of all that you do for us we're thankful father for being here today we thank you for this place you've given us to come in from out of the world lord it's just a time of Solace that we have Lord attacked continually every day all the time and all around us Lord and seeing the degradation of humanity and and people just falling apart Lord it just it saddens my soul so much Lord but it feels so good to come into this place and become regenerated and renewed once again Lord as would could be said Lord even a new beginning here that you give us father from out of the world from out of those spirits and not of the things that would try to Buffet us so hard every day father and just worship you and glorify and praise you and learn of you and speak of you Lord and just sing about your glories and all that you do for us Lord it just it feels so good to our souls Lord It's a scouring out lord of the things of the past week and and Lord just entering in Lords will receive whatever you have need for us today and we thank you for it Lord thank you God for those that have come Lord and for those who may be streaming and just pray that your Holy Spirit would once again have the preeminence here Lord to do the exceeding abundantly above all that we could ever ask for a thing fill all this house where we are sitting here today God and do as you did on the day of Pentecost raise our faith up Lord come with power and manifestation Show Yourself real once again flow through this place Lord as you have done so many times and raise our faith to the level to receive and believe whatever you have for us today God show that word to our hearts reveal it help us to be encouraged by it Lord today maybe nothing new maybe nothing revelated or what people might say today but just something of an encouragement Lord to know that Lord this life that we're going through and all that we see around us and the degradation of humanity you'll never touch that sod it'll never be seen in that place nothing of the devil or any of his devices or any of those evil spirits will ever be felt Lord and God will be such a place such a Time thank you for it Lord thank you for the promise of your word Lord as we just enter into a little portion of it once again today expecting you to meet with us Lord and speak to us from it Grant it God may you anoint speaker and hear a like and we rebuke every demonic spirit that would try to hurt hinder and filtrate this service in any way Satan you have no place here you must go we adjure you in Jesus Christ's name amen you be all the glory honor and praise Lord Jesus for we commit ourselves to you now Lord in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen amen Genesis chapter one read a couple verses again here in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth the Earth was without form and void darkness is upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters and you could be seated if you'd like it's just outstanding I I just enjoy reading that I guess every time it may become old to you I don't know but I just enjoy reading that every time because it just inspires me inspires me to think of what God did and just the operation of God and sending forth his Spirit through his low Gods to move upon the creation that God creates for us he created that creation here he's gone to prepare prepare a place for us for a creation there and give us just a little Glimpse amen I think some of probably what we're in store for uh is not written in the scripture for us to read I think some of it would probably go beyond our human intellect or where we couldn't even comprehend it anyway uh and and and this Revelation thereof so I guess to maintain our human sanity the Lord put limits on certain things that he put down and he just I guess let John say that guy's never seen ears that are Paul I has not seen ears not heard neither in the heart of man what God's got in store so I guess that sums it up amen so what little bit we have here and some of it we venture on a little bit as I've said I told you some things I try to notate and make sure you understand or read it from the scripture or if it's something brother Branham said or something even that we crossed that I may have a personal opinion about uh I'll let you know that but we all have those thoughts and uh you know I I would I would rather take the scripture and of course even brother branham's word even if brother Branham is dramatizing something I take that over pretty much anybody else so amen so thankful for that but let's go over to Revelation chapter 21 we're going to try to pick up where we left off amen and I want to get this I have this turned around so I didn't want it become a distraction but this is the service and the time I wanted to spend a little bit more time and since we've spent so much time on it already uh I probably won't spend as much time on it today but I kind of try to draw it out a little bit better with some specifics and stats and I actually tried to uh make the Earth which the Earth is not perfectly round like that but the tambourine under here is so that's why I drew that off of if you're wondering how did he get such a perfect circle I was in here hunting for something and that's what the lord gave me to scale uh based on the earth and the pyramid-shaped mountain that that brother round about it's going to push up from the earth and because it was always a con a thought of mine uh how is something that is seemingly that large going to belch up from the earth when we see all that the Earth is going to go through obviously it becomes pretty clear but when you look at it in retrospect or in perspective of the size of the Earth it really isn't that big uh we we think about the 1500 miles and I did come up and did some math on the dimensions of that we tried to do that a little bit the other day but this was kind of the time I kind of got ahead of myself the last couple of services is what I'm trying to say this is what I wanted to try to present I had it on a flash drive that I did at the Tabernacle one time that Jordan put on for me couldn't find the flash drives so I thought well I've got a board here I put it on the flash drive there because I didn't have something to draw on uh brother green had talked over and over about getting something I could write on that would show up on the screen but we never did that so everything I did I just had to put in a computer and anyway so this time I could draw it and this is basically what it looks like with a lot of the numbers uh but if you uh some of the things I don't have here are the dimensions that we talked about last week now uh let's just read this again Revelation 21 1-2 and I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth for the first Heaven and the first Earth were passed away and there was no more C and I John saw the holy city New Jerusalem coming down from God out of Heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband also uh versus uh verse 16 uh we'll start with in the city life Foursquare the length of it is the largest of breath and he measured the city with the Reed uh 12 000 furlongs which we talked about last week that is 15 approximately 1500 miles the length and the breadth and the height are equal so sideways long ways up ways is all the same are equal uh and he measured the walls there of this we'll get to the walls another time uh so in in reading that in uh reading that back over again this is some of this is more in line with the dimensions that we talked about now uh we try to put it in our minds brother Branham tried to kind of explain it about from here to here I did some math yesterday it didn't take long uh but from San Diego from basically the Pacific Ocean to almost Shreveport Louisiana is 500 bottles we talked about I think I came up with Odessa and then Dallas actually it's farther than that it's more than half of the United States east to west so from the Pacific Ocean to almost or approximately Shreveport Louisiana that's 1500 miles and 1500 miles it's incredible but uh it come out and all that I could find that basically from in Tucson from the southern border from the United States Mexico border to the United States Canadian border is approximately 1500 miles so border to border top to bottom north to south is approximately 1500 miles if you set that city right here now we know it's not going to be set here amen we already know that's going to be over in Palestine where Abraham of course met Melchizedek and we'll I'll read something about that either this week or next week to to refer to that so the dimensions of the 1500 you can keep it in your mind basically from the Pacific coast and Pacific Ocean to Shreveport Louisiana and from the Canadian Southern uh northern border to the Mexico Southern border the United States of 1500 miles and of course it's going to be 1500 miles high now some of the math I wrote down uh somebody had mentioned to me and I had thought about it too so I decided to look it up said well man that that seems like that would take us almost to the Moon well the Moon is 238 900 miles from the earth so it's not even going to be remotely close to the Moon uh the Moon is a lot further away from the earth uh than uh than the 1500 miles I kind of Drew this and this this is pretty close to scale okay so the the scale of it the Earth were this big the the mountain with the the mountain I drew it as a pyramid but remember the pyramid is just the geographical shape it's going to be a mountain uh that pushes up kind of about where it's how much of the Earth would have to push up to make this mountain come up so you think that's going to be really high and yes it is it's going to be really high uh 1500 miles is 7 million 920 000 feet seven thousand seven million 920 000 feet divided by a plane traveling at 30 000 feet if you've ever fallen on the plane which we talked this mountain the top of it is going to be 264 times higher than a airplane flies right 264 times higher than an airplane flies which is incredible the other the only other thing I could think of a rule of measurement beside the moon which really doesn't bring much of a perspective on the uh because you can't really consider 238 900 miles 1500 miles that's a drip in the bucket but the space station has anybody ever seen the space station go over I've seen it we've I've done hikes up in Mount Lemmon out where it's just darker dark and you can see it going over uh over the space station uh goes over the Earth or orbits the earth at approximately 227 miles above the Earth's surface so this this this mountain is still going to be a quite a bit higher than even the International Space Station would travel but then when you start encompassing and that's why I put the 1500 miles here the Earth is almost 8 000 miles from Court through the core from top to bottom uh almost 8 000 miles so again this is five times uh the Earth is five plus times larger than this mountain is going to be so again when you think about the scope of how large it's going to be how high it's going to be it really as big as it is going to be it really doesn't take a whole lot of the Earth um it doesn't even remotely come close to the Moon uh but it does kind of fathom the brain when you think about beyond the ozone layer which I think is about 20 miles something like that uh and then the space station 227 miles uh this is this is going to be uh much higher than that but we can't think but now I mentioned ozone ozone layer and I mentioned space uh uh crap uh I I did look up uh the furthest orbiting satellite and it's billions of miles they say so that didn't even come into view either so I thought well how far are these satellites up there but you can't think of those again like I said last week we can't think in those terms so much I try to bring it in perspective for us uh so that we maybe can fathom what is going to go on and what it's going to be and look like but we really we really even struggle with that because everything's going to be changed right everything's going to be different there's going to be no more seat there's going to be no more seeing there's going to be no more germs diseases uh space station won't be up there all all of where the space station is and all is going to explode all of that atmospheres Heavens are going to explode all the gases and all that they have found out there are going to explode all that stuff is going to be done away with there'll be no more sin there's going to be no more even atmosphere of sin Satan will be in the Lake of Fire the devil Lucifer will be in the Lake of Fire and all his followers and all of that that you have to put up with and see every day all that's going to be done away with the Lake of Fire uh everything about what we know and how we conceive And precede things in this world is going to be all changed it's gonna be all different so when you think wow the airplane there won't be airplanes we'll travel is a thought uh 1500 miles high that is that is way high up off the Earth but again it's going to be so different that it's it Beyond this it's really hard to explain it's really hard not just to explain but to comprehend it's really hard to Fathom in our brains uh how this is going to be but by the scripture how how the scripture teaches us what brother Branham taught us about that and maybe some of you have spent some time listening to Future home this week I hope you have if you didn't maybe next week because we're not quite done with it yet but I know brother Dennis is over there not in his head he told us Wednesday when we went to lunch he had been listened to it I did two again uh most of it anyway to to two plus hours of it uh so I hope you did it it gives us a little more perspective Amen to follow along with and and see how this is is going to be set up and uh again I tried to make this more to scale so that it would it would you could see it a little better uh and maybe even in our little human P brains comprehend a little bit better how it's going to unfold and how it goes these numbers can be overwhelming these things when you think about them can can can overcome you and overwhelm you and think how can that be how can that be uh and and a lot of it is still how can that be how can that be but uh when we know that God can do anything uh God can make it however he wants we're not going to be in this world anymore this Cosmos living under the elements that we live today uh then what is there is there a limit to God there's no limits God can do whatever you want whenever you want however you want and in whatever way he wants amen so uh so we I want to finish now with with this and with that pyramid shape mountain with that mountain uh that we know it's going to push up I'm not done with it yet but I want to start focusing more on the city now amen were the uh John sought I saw the holy city New Jerusalem coming down from God out of heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband now to me and what I know and brother random said that City that God has gone to prepare for us which we will probably talk about next week more in detail um comes as it comes down is what it says the holy city coming down from God out of heaven prepared is adorned for her husband would set upon after this pyramid-shaped mountain has been pushed up will come down upon that mountain Amen in what fashion what form how much of it I don't know that's up to God right it doesn't say brother Adam doesn't say uh does it just is it just on the top is it just on the bottom does it fill the whole 1500 miles around only God knows that that's his that's his choice that's his decision um and and when you and when you look at this don't look at it look at it as you look at the mountain I I know I keep trying to harp on that but don't look at it as a pyramid with cut Corners look at it as a mountain like this uh and the way the mountain is shaped it's not shaped like a a geography or a geometry excuse me where it's just squares and cuts and Corners we do this is based on trying to understand how it is but it's going to be a mountain just like this just like the Catalina mountains right here it's going to be just like that pushed up from the earth just like these mountains were pushed up from the earth amen it's going to be just like that now this city that comes down I want to get to a specific part of this today that I want to talk about uh before we go and I'm going to read from future home here this uh this quote that I want to give to you says now uh the Lord in that day now look we're you know what let me read uh let me read these other scriptures first let's do this first uh let's go to the 23rd verse we've read it already uh but I want to read it again 23rd through the 27th and the city had no need of the sun neither of the moon to shine in it for the glory of God did lighten it and the lamb is the light thereof amen so it has there's no need of the sun neither of the Moon because the glory of God is going to lighten it for the lamb is the light amen amen now if you want to chop God into two or three pieces the denominations can do that but these are the self-sing person amen that lamb is that logos the thought of God remember Abraham went looking for a foundation whose Builder and maker was God who had foundations whose Builder and makers God and remember in the beginning when we read Genesis 1 1-2 in the beginning when God created when the logos came out of God that word that light that came out of God that created God did not take a saw and a hammer and a drill and build this Earth he spoke it the logos came out in word form as he spoke it and created by his own word yes that's how God creates by his own word so when that word came forth it created this rock that we're standing on today yes yes but it wasn't done with uh tools and with enhancements God spoke it and that logos as it created that's the creation of God God created that so that lamb now of that logos that came forth and went and went into the one that Abraham met on his uh that went down and sent the two angels to Sodom uh when he met Melchizedek uh when Jesus Christ came forth in the seed of a woman as a man as a kinsman redeemer it's God still condescending all the way through not two Gods Not three Gods the same one God who manifests himself in all these different ways that he does Amen we know mostly As the as the father-son the Holy Ghost well the Bible says God did Enlighten it the lamb is the light of it praise the Lord the lamb is the light thereof and the Nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light of it and kings of the Earth amen listen now Kings of the earth not just of this city but of the earth look now uh the Earth do bring their Glory and Honor into it into what into this city and the gates of it shall not be shut At All by day for there shall be no night there and they shall bring the glory and honor of the Nations into it and there shall in no wise enter into it anything that defileth neither whatsoever worketh Abomination or maketh a lie but they which are written in the Lamb's Book of Life praise the Lord now let's go down to 22nd chapter fifth verse and there shall be no night there amen when you have a continual Perpetual illumination as the lamb is and will be to this city there can't be a night there can be as long as the lights are on in this room Darkness can't exist right praise the Lord if the lights in this room were Perpetual existence continually there could never be dark in this room as long as there's light there can't be Darkness praise the Lord so there shall be no night there and they and they need no candle or lamp neither light of the Sun for the Lord God giveth them light and they shall reign forever and ever praise the Lord now let's go to this quote I was going to read in uh in future home if you listen to it this week it'll probably sound familiar to you the Lord in that day upon the top of it upon the top of what upon the top of this mountain upon the crest of this city upon the top of it shall create a fire of light to burn upon upon the day well you say day because the only reason to make it work right is to separate the two and he goes ahead and says it'll be a shelter a rest a refuge which we'll read uh maybe if I get to it in uh in Isaiah he talks about it being a refuge um uh in in Isaiah notice make exactly this speaking the Bible exactly if the walls are straight up and down he's talking about the walls of the city not the walls around the city uh you've got to differentiate the two not the actual City itself but he's talking about the actual City itself as some would think this is still a cube a man with a flat top and sides that are 1500 uh that he says now brother man said if the walls were straight up and down you could not see it amen there would be uh the shadows of that on the sides of a cube if you will it has to leave all of my Holy Mountain we read that scripture Isaiah he will create this light upon this mountain and it shall be for a defense now I've got to be honest with you that part I don't necessarily understand although we will get into uh those that are outside the city those are outside the wall those that bring the leaves in for the healing of the Nations and this is the part the point where Jesus Christ begins to rule the nations with a rod of iron Isaiah said it shall be for a defense this light shall be for a defense oh we have a song you talked about that amen I think we've sang that song last week maybe notice Mount Sinai was where God descended on top of it uh when he spoke to Israel in the pillar of fire he descended on top of a mountain now Sinai on the Mount of transfiguration we talked about the mountains was it last week or or maybe the week before I can't remember of the significance of the mountains uh suggested maybe you go back and listen to uh uh what is the attraction on the mountain that brother Brown talks about the experience and all that he had uh what he called Mount sunset sunset Mountain of these uh events scripturally happening on the mountain when he declared this is my beloved Son hear ye him he descended in a pillar of light in shining brightness upon the top of the mountain Before Peter James and John and there he was represented with both Moses and Elijah the translated and the dead raised oh my on this Throne on top of it again top of the mountain 1500 miles high amen amen 1500 miles high the hole now he says the whole world he corrects it later but not in the quote I'm reading here but he says the whole world will see the light uh of that world Jesus sitting on the throne on top of the world now World being as in you could say Cosmos again or the world as it exists in that City or outside that City it is not possible that this would lie down here I mean well possible I just said God could do anything so yeah God could do that but but in thinking in natural terms uh if the lights up here it would not light down here and and brother and brother random goes on later to explain that so I I just believing here that when he says the world he means that the world that we're living in remember a world is simply an atmosphere uh when brother Adam said you could create your own world and go live on it well you can create any atmosphere you want wherever you are and live in that atmosphere because that's what the world is the world doesn't constitute just a ball of dirt or this slump of clay that we're standing on a world is an atmosphere a place that you live it's where you are it's your existence amen and you can create that existence wherever you are in your home or in church or in your car or whatever whatever atmosphere you want to live in you have it on your job you have the ability to create that atmosphere and live it it doesn't matter if anybody else around you is living in it or wants to live in it that's irrelevant what is relevant is the fact that you are living where you want to be amen and where you desire to live in peace and love and harmony and Grace and blessings and healings and love and you want to live in that atmosphere live in that atmosphere don't worry about what everybody else is don't worry about what the world looks like and what's going on you live in that atmosphere and you want to create it in your car you want to create it by hugging a lady at the bus stop you want to create it at your job of those who are mocking and making fun of you whatever you need to do you create that atmosphere and live in simply a world Jesus is the light of that world amen he's the light of this world he's the light of our world that is that is what I will create in the world I live in for him to be the light of Praise the Lord so honestly it is just a manifestation of what we live spiritually today who we are what we desire to anyway sitting on Throne on top of the world top of the church top of Mount Zion 1500 miles high says half the size United States is actually as we have found out it's top to bottom takes up the entire United States east to west it takes up about two-thirds of the United States when you when you do the math and it raises Plum up so you can see in the world over 1500 miles high and all up and down all up and down the Earth will be the redeemed now Earth again not here he's talking about that City that part of that mountain where that city is setting will be the redeemed City uh city with the throne in top Revelation 21 23 they need no light for the lamb uh the lamb and the Lord God is the light thereof see the Lord God is that Pillar of Fire that led the children of Israel through the Wilderness amen he actually if you look in that quote up he actually says followed but that's not accurate uh they he led the children of Israel not followed the children of Israel that led the children of Israel through the Wilderness so if you're looking at that and you look at it you say brother Newton misquoted it no I didn't uh I just changed the little verbiage there from the state they he led the children of Israel through the wilderness and he is ascended upon the throne in that perfect Kingdom when that Kingdom that Jesus is to surrender the father God might be all in all Jesus sets upon his throne here is our Joseph then the king that is the light the light that will be on top of Mount Zion and His Holy Light will flood the entire city and then of course he says hallelujah praise the Lord I can say the same thing Hallelujah that that light will light the whole city when this isn't anything that's unusual to us we know in the scripture that it tells us many places and we have many instances where Jesus God the logos manifests itself as a light uh we just sang that um we just sang that course a few minutes ago he's the Holy Ghost and fire praise God the Holy Ghost in fire when that Holy Ghost comes into your life that fire burns out the old nature yes praise God if there wasn't a fire there to cleanse and remember fire is the best cleanser that we know of it's the best purifier that we know of that fire comes in and burns out and cleanses every bit of unrighteousness that was in your soul every bit of it maybe it burns it out the Holy Ghost in Fire and it's keeping me alive um Hebrews Hebrews chapter 12 verse 29 for our God is what a consuming fire praise the Lord what does the fire do a fire not only Burns a fire not only purifies a fire illuminates a fire brings light praise the Lord if you were in this room with no lights on in the middle of the night you couldn't see maybe the eyes uh the the your hand in front of your eyes if you struck a match it would probably like most of this room you could probably see at least parts of what was in the room you might can see parts of the wall and you see how much more power the light has over the darkness although see sometimes people seems like like to follow the darkness uh I don't know there's there's become this wholesale celebration in this country at least of darkness and it's baffling to me I guess it comes from uh uh what like superheroes or Star Wars or whatever you know uh people like to celebrate Darth Vader why he was a wicked evil murderer but they they talk about embracing the darkness why do people like Darkness so much when a simple match in a room that's pitch dark would scatter that Darkness the light is so much more powerful than the darkness it is actually uncomprehensible but people remember though John 3 says Saint John 3 they the men love Darkness rather than light amen why because their deeds are evil that's right amen their deeds are evil and the light exposes them right but the light and the exposing and what is that exposing that exposing us to bring it to bring it out the fire brings it out the fire burns it the fire purifies it the fire illuminates it amen to let it be to let it be known there's something going on here that's that's not right that's why people would rather have Darkness and Light they'd rather walk around as brother Adam said like the little boy and going through the the cemetery whistling like he's not scared in the middle of the night midnight going to a a graveyard little boy of course he's scared I know when I was a little boy a lot of times didn't even like to go in the daytime my dad would take me through where my mom and dad are buried my ancestors my my uh my son my daughter or my not my daughter excuse me my sister my sister I do have a son there but not a daughter uh or Barry and my dad used to like to take me through and say this is so and so and there's so and so and so and so on I don't remember uh but I like being with my dad so I enjoyed that time but I did not like walking through cemeteries even as a little boy I would walk through cemeteries uh like you know you're trying to avoid uh something on the floor I I just I never would step on any grave or anything I mean that was uh that was I don't know when I was a little boy you taboo I don't know what do you call it when you're a kid or something I just I hated it then but it's like uh people walk around this earth like that they walk around on the earth and they think that everything is okay and that you know they're twilling thumbs and they're whistling and they think everything's okay like the boy going through the graveyard not everything is not okay amen the light brings forth uh an illumination it brings forth the revelation of the darkness when the light even the smallest light comes forth it scatters Darkness yeah amen Darkness cannot stay where there is light praise the Lord so the light God represents himself through the scripture and many places we know as as light he's the consuming fire he's the Holy Ghost in fire uh again brother Ram said leading the children of Israel out of Egypt as God led the children of Israel by nine he led them by a cloud during the day by night he led them by a pillar of fire god and and as that Pillar of Fire moved they moved with it when that Pillar of Fire stopped they stopped and that's exactly what every one of us should do when God leads you follow him when he stops you stop when he moves you move where he goes you go with him but that's what the children of Israel did when God stopped they camped that was it they were there we used millions of people so it wasn't like half a dozen of us or 20 25 here in the church that we could just get up and go to a restaurant or something there's millions of people following this life and uh Moses was in charge of see so it wasn't just that easy but when it moved they moved when that light stopped they stopped but they were following that low gloss that light that manifestation of light that God is to prove that this was an illumination of the path that they were to walk brother around tells the story about a guy that uh that didn't want to believe what brother Brandon was preaching he said how do you know God's real and they come outside the church and they look and he says where do you live the man says I live on the other side of the house can you see the house no he said but I got a lantern he said well can you shine the Lantern on the house no can't see it well you know what's there have you been there yeah been there I know it's there uh it's just but you can't see it so how do I know it's theirs he said well how do you get there the man says there's a path right here that you can walk he says well how do you see the path he said I got a light he said but the light only lights you one step at a time praise the Lord but the light will illuminate the path to get you one step at a time to where you want to go to know that it exists that it is God Amen God leading him God doing the same thing today God struck Moses down with a burning bush Moses have you ever seen something burned you ever seen a burning bush I've seen trees burn bushes burn I've seen wildfires um I've seen uh I had fires campfires uh seen tons of stuff burned but you ever seen anything that burned that didn't consume I haven't that you set it on fire uh like a like a campfire you set it on fire and then and it just burns all night long no usually I'm not usually every single time I've started a fire or every single fire I've ever saw burned and consumed what it was burning but this bush did not consume so it had to be something other than the natural fire burning to destroy the bush it was gone amen it was that logos that came out of God that created this world that became Melchizedek that stood there and spoke to in a bush spoke to Moses there's a fire it was a light he saw that light he said I must turn aside amen I must go to sight and see this great sight one of the best decisions Moses ever made in his life right was the circle turn aside and go see that great site on the day of Pentecost they were in the upper room 120 of them sitting there the light came in that Holy Spirit came and lit upon each one of them and went into each one of them it illuminated the whole room and that power of that room became so Supernatural that people started knocking the doors out knocking the walls speaking in tongues the spirit of God moving to a place that the people that are around them and watching them thought they were crazy well you know they think the same thing today amen you can do about whatever you want in this world but when you become a Christian serve God and live like a Christian they think you're crazy why do you dress like that why do you look like that why do you not go there why do you not do this I had the the last week um we went into the hotel lobby I got a call for you and and all the guys they all bring and there they wanted to get a drink and says well it's up to them and the other guy the the curmudgeons and I'm winning over a little bit he said you're the only preacher I know that doesn't drink I said that's the that is the most shameful statement I think I've ever heard I did I said that is disgrace amen but but unfortunately it is probably true yeah I don't know but he said you're the only preacher I know that doesn't drink I said well I'm not a preacher I'm a minister remember we talked the other day about the difference and being a preacher at a Ministry said yeah you're right there's a difference amen that there's a fire see the Holy Ghost in fire Paul was struck down by a fire amen the pillar of fire that spoke out spoke to Paul too it wasn't a different part it was manifesting itself in a different way it wasn't in a bush amen it was in a cloud but it was the same God same logos that came all the way through that we just read about in the beginning God created same one nothing different same one that spoke to Moses out of the Bush he's here over Paul he says Saul Saul why persecute us thou me same God struck Paul uh Paul down and when Paul fell it changed his life amen at brother Brown's birth you know the testimony of the light that came in that shot through that window the the shuttered window they used to have shutters didn't just used to be decorations on the sides of Windows shutters actually used to be what covered the window right um and we don't have a lot of shuttered homes here though do we that's all back East uh but the shutters would actually cover that and it was propped open that white King shot in there and hung right over at his bird same like mademothe Ohio River one time said don't you eat drink don't you smoke or drink or defile your body in any way amen praise the Lord that same Pillar of Fire same Pillar of Fire had his picture took with him in Houston Texas where I'll be this afternoon not in that Auditorium but in Houston the fire that was over brother Branham that was took that brother Branham later said God honored Me by allowing me to have my picture taken with him amen that was over same pill or fire same God different manifestation amen may have been something like Paul experience we don't know but it's saying God same old God same word same creative power same light that came out and was and was there at that day I've seen them a lot like that I will say it's the exact same but it's God I believe it was God because you know Saints when God strikes you like that if you see something God manifests himself in that way something in you changes something in you uh you can feel you know it's different you know it's not something that's of the normal right because in you there's something different and you know it you can feel it it's God pulsating in you to let you know this is me this is this is me manifesting myself to you I've seen it in church I've had people tell me I had a girl one time when I was ministering in Florida she said that that was over my shoulder one time I didn't know you know you always feel the anointing but I I don't I hardly ever preach I don't feel an anointing so um gets me in trouble sometimes when I'm singing Because it blows my voice out because I just love to Worship the Lord but she saw that you know I didn't see it anybody else see it you know but she said she saw it it's just God God vindicating himself I've had other people tell me similar things I've seen those things on other people amen and in other situations it's just God God manifesting himself in that great light to show that he is still the light the light of the world so it's no uh it's no secret it's no uh uh you know no doubt that you you can't not believe excuse the double negative but you can't not believe what the scripture says about it because he has manifested himself through the scripture through our lives to see that it's just going to be the same God here Illuminating that city as he has shown himself all through the scripture right so what is there to doubt that's the word I was on how can you doubt what is there to doubt there's it removes all doubt to see that he would be there doing that when he has shown us that all the way through the scripture amen it's just him God manifesting himself let's go to Isaiah chapter four now I don't read that scripture that I read now there's others there's obviously other course time scriptures where God's manifested himself in the light God and again maybe you have experienced that in your life maybe you haven't doesn't make you an unbeliever doesn't make you a doubter it just God does it for some in some ways and some not others there's experiences that people have had and tell me about it and things and I'm like well I've never had that I've never seen that and you know I'm I'm like Lord I'd like to I'd like to get in on some of that I'd like to see that or or hear that or something uh I I've I've never heard god with an audible voice but I've had people tell me they've heard about it have you ever heard Bob with an audible voice anybody I thought there was some people in here that told me they had I've had something ring in my spirit so loud you would think it was an audible voice yeah in fact one of those times is the only reason I'm in Tucson when God spoke to me in that car that day on I-95 and going between St Augustine and Jacksonville told me to come here I knew it was him it rained so true it could have been Audible it wasn't but it was that real amen when those things happen you know it so if you have wonderful if you haven't that's a doubt or unbeliever or a or any of that you know God would give you the desire of your heart if you if you wanted to see some time the Lord could could manifest that to you but irregardless we know through the scripture we know how God operates God doesn't change we've got to always remember once God does it one way one time he's got to do it the exact same way all the way through he's not God yeah man so and seeing this and recognizing this in the scripture and brother Brown's description of it doesn't surprise us him amen Knight's actually really good sense Isaiah 4 5. and the Lord will create upon upon every Dwelling Place of Mount Zion every Dwelling Place amen I'll have a Dwelling Place in here I believe you'll have a Dwelling Place in here brother Branham even talked about when you hear uh when you when you go down the creek and see this cabin you hear somebody singing uh by the grace of God or something like that he says you know old brother Bill made it she'll be in one of those cabins down by the the River of Life that flows out of the throne amen would get to he says you'll know oh brother Bill made it praise the Lord so that Dwelling Place I'll have one of those Dwelling Places I Lord willing you'll have a mouth design and upon her assemblies a cloud and a smoke by day and The Shining of flaming fire by night for upon all the glory shall be a defense amen a defense from what I don't know all I know is that when a light shines it brings everything else into perspective amen you ever notice uh when when most of the time when armies strike even in the scripture when Army strike they strike at night and almost every time I remember the things that we've done good better and differentness as a nation it's always been at night it when uh Marines or SEALS or whatever go in to rescue a citizen or or to kill Bin Laden so it's always at night they do it at night because it's the it's the element of surprise because you you can't the illumination is you can't see see so the light the light is created as a defense because it because if anything wrong is happening it shows and then it exposes it it is exposed amen Saint John chapter 8. uh wait let me let's since we're Isaiah let's do this one first in Isaiah chapter 60. in Isaiah 60. uh let's see I believe it's starting with verse 19. the Sun the sun shall be no more thy light by day neither for brightness shall the moon give light unto thee but the Lord shall be unto thee an everlasting light amen and thy God thy glory amen praise the Lord thy son shall s-u-n shalt no more go down neither shall thy Moon withdraw itself for the Lord shall be thine Everlasting Light and the end of thy mourning shall be ended amen of the days of thy mourning shall be ended why because it's always life there won't be an existence of Darkness there won't be a need for Darkness again when there is a Perpetual continual light Darkness can't exist amen you ever notice light can exist where darkness is but Darkness can't exist where light is amen if light is here Darkness can't exist right but if darkness is here all you have to do is slip the light on and it scatters the darkness yes so light can come when there's darkness and Scatter the darkness but Darkness can't do that to the light right amen the holy way is for the is for the darkness to take hold is for the light to withdraw itself yeah which you see happening in the world today the light is withdrawing himself amen and soon the only light that is Illuminating in this Gentile world is the bride will be taken out of here the light will be gone all the light will be gone and as the light pulls and goes he's only only going to be dealing with his people the Jews we've talked about that a few weeks back a few months back amen he'll only be dealing with his people the Jews the rest of the world goes into chaos all the light is gone only way that Darkness can take over something is when light withdraws itself if light comes into Darkness Darkness has to flee amen praise the Lord and that's the way that that light brings itself exposes itself questions and answers 1964. on the top of Mount Zion will set the lamb and the city will uh will need no light we just read that for the lamb is the light thereof and above the lamb will be the father which is the logos God the great light the Eternal Light that'll shine just above the throne and Jesus will not be on his father's Throne he'll be on his throne father will hover over father and son will be one uh and while uh while they are yet speaking I'll answer see he's talking about us then and Jesus will commit a perfect uh perfect age a perfect Living God that he is redeemed and give over to the father is that right we'll turn to God the Father which is the spirit not a man Spirit but that life that he's talking about logos shiny amen Illuminating that world letting that light shine again remember what is that what is that logos that logos is the word of God it's God creating bringing forth coming out of word speech accounts saying amen that's what that logos is from God right amen it is it is God manifesting himself in that in in that in that way amen praise the Lord one more scripture uh I'm gonna read I had you going over Saint John chapter 8. um amen it's getting a little late to start on the next thing so we'll just we'll just finish with this John St John chapter 8. amen Saint John chapter 8 verse 12. this fake Jesus again unto them saying I am the light of the world he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness but shall have the light of life praise the Lord today walking in him brings the light of life in this God illuminates brings life not a not a a night a time of night not a Darkness it will bring an illumination of light that will be a Perpetual continual life amen amen I like the light and the sun I guess you know I grew up in North Carolina so I I was used to the very varied weather but when you come to Tucson you live here long enough you kind of get accustomed to the Sun and you go somewhere and the sun's not hot you're like where did it go I we're just a little bit sometimes when we go up north or uh the Midwest or something and go a whole week and don't see the Sun at all like my my this is I couldn't live here I look at people and I say I don't know how they can stand living where there's no sun how could you not at least today out of the week have some sun again he is so used to the sun I like the sun I like the light amen the light brings life amen Darkness brings death light brings life you go put a seed in the ground and and Shine for lack of better word Darkness on it won't grow but if you put it under the light it will grow and then Water and Light and it will grow praise the Lord let's stand if we could we'll talk about the water next week some of it amen he is the light thank God he shines that light upon our pathway amen praise the Lord give me a listing this little course before we go today is 3 16 in the book we all probably know it but amen if you're not sure 316 Sanctuary Lord prepare me amen let that light shine amen thought about singing that song for the kids today we should do it though Gabriel and Alice know just a light
