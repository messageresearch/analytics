[46:14] amen amen Genesis 3 21.
[46:18] unto Adam also unto his wife did the
[46:21] Lord God make coats of skins and clothe
[46:24] them amen you can be seated if you'd
[46:26] like
[46:27] praise the Lord
[46:29] the scripture that we read before every
[46:31] one of these times
[46:35] recognizing the significance of the holy
[46:37] spirit in our lives and the significance
[46:40] of what the Lord Jesus God Almighty did
[46:42] back in the Garden of Eden Way Back in
[46:45] Genesis 3 to show to us what he was
[46:47] going to continue to do down through
[46:49] time amen now this is the holy spirit
[46:52] part eight I want to talk about a
[46:54] defeated enemy amen who is our enemy we
[46:57] only have one enemy it's not one another
[46:59] it's not the church down the street it's
[47:02] not your mama daddy it's not your
[47:03] brother or sister it's the devil it's
[47:06] the only enemy we have saints he is the
[47:09] only one that wants to send you to Hell
[47:11] he's the only one that wants to destroy
[47:13] your life he's the only one that wants
[47:15] to take every bit of joy peace happiness
[47:18] love and anything good away from you is
[47:22] the devil right amen he's the only one
[47:24] he's the enemy but praise the Lord today
[47:26] I want to talk about a defeated enemy an
[47:29] enemy that has already been defeated
[47:31] before we get back to the word I want to
[47:33] go to Genesis chapter 22 now but before
[47:36] we get back to that I want you to
[47:38] recognize her think in your mind what
[47:40] kind of a battle would it be like what
[47:42] kind of a war would it be if we win
[47:45] against an army that absolutely had no
[47:48] fighting Spirit they had no Weaponry
[47:51] they had no intelligence of how to fight
[47:54] a war they had nothing on their side to
[47:57] be able to fight against would that be
[47:59] much of a fight
[48:01] no amen wouldn't be much of a fight you
[48:05] look at David and Goliath look at David
[48:07] and Goliath for a minute Goliath was a
[48:10] huge massive individual with with
[48:14] fingers and hands the size of that could
[48:18] go all the way around a basketball not
[48:19] even just Palm it 14 inch fingers and uh
[48:23] the massiveness that the the man's head
[48:26] would touch a basketball rim
[48:28] he was so massive and Little David
[48:31] coming out little ready David just
[48:33] insignificant to the world didn't look
[48:35] like much amen but the truth of it is
[48:39] even though David looked like the puny
[48:42] individual the Ruddy little boy that he
[48:45] was he had more Authority and more power
[48:49] and
[48:51] excuse me of this thing but in his
[48:52] little pinky then Goliath had in his
[48:55] entire massive being yes amen because he
[48:58] had God by his side he had the Lord with
[49:01] him he had he had uh the almighty with
[49:06] him following him now goliath
[49:09] he was almost ashamed to fight this
[49:12] little boy but that little boy said
[49:15] today I'm gonna take your head off and
[49:17] I'm gonna feed your flesh to the fowls
[49:19] of the air
[49:20] did he do it amen why because Goliath
[49:24] was already a defeated foe because God
[49:27] was with David amen amen Goliath didn't
[49:30] have a chance I don't care if he had
[49:32] sores and swords and and Shields and all
[49:35] that the Bible says he had made
[49:37] absolutely no difference all it took was
[49:40] one small smooth stone that David took
[49:44] out of the local Creek and he sung and
[49:46] it hit David right in the head the only
[49:48] spot that David had emptied or that
[49:51] Goliath had empty that David could have
[49:53] hit to bring the man down he was armored
[49:55] from head to toe but that one spot and
[49:58] that one spot is exactly just like God
[50:01] guiding a tree or a car through water
[50:04] guided that stone right to Goliath's
[50:06] forehead amen there was no battle to it
[50:09] there was no war to it it no
[50:14] Goliath didn't even take his sword out
[50:16] of a Sheen it was no battle Goliath was
[50:19] already defeated what do you think it
[50:21] would be today if we went against a an
[50:24] army that had no that had no guns they
[50:27] had no bullets they had no intelligent
[50:29] individuals to teach him or show him how
[50:31] to fight they had they they didn't have
[50:33] enough of anything to I mean there would
[50:36] be no there would be no there would be
[50:38] no war to that there would be no battle
[50:41] we sang a song that the Bible says that
[50:44] Satan's like a roaring lion seeking whom
[50:47] he made a devour friend but I want you
[50:49] to tell I want to tell you today to the
[50:51] Bride of Jesus Christ those that are
[50:53] born again and filled with the Holy
[50:55] Ghost Satan is a toothless lion
[50:58] he is a meow of a roar because he has
[51:02] nothing against the bride he has already
[51:04] defeated when was he defeated at Calvary
[51:08] Satan Was Defeated at Calvary now that
[51:11] Calvary experience of that Holy Spirit
[51:13] coming back on you has made you more
[51:16] than a conqueror it has made you the
[51:19] Victorious One it has made you to
[51:21] overcome all of the walls of the enemy
[51:24] because he is a defeated vote let's look
[51:26] at this now in Genesis chapter 22
[51:30] we're going to go back and talk about
[51:31] Abraham again
[51:35] Genesis 22 verse 15.
[51:39] Genesis 22 15 and the age of the Lord
[51:42] now this is after Abraham had been
[51:45] faithful to God to offer Isaac as a
[51:48] sacrifice and God provided Abraham a
[51:52] lamb instead of his son to sacrifice
[51:55] and because it is obedience the angel of
[51:58] the Lord called unto Abraham Out of
[52:00] Heaven the second time and said by
[52:02] myself have I sworn saith the Lord for
[52:06] because thou has done this thing and has
[52:09] not withheld thy son thine only son
[52:12] that in blessing our bless thee and in
[52:16] multiplying I will multiply thy seed as
[52:18] the stars of the heaven and as the
[52:21] sandwiches upon the seashore
[52:23] and remember who we talked about those
[52:25] words amen it's not just a literal seat
[52:29] of Abraham but the spiritual Seed of
[52:31] Abraham which is us today which includes
[52:34] the bride because we go you go over
[52:36] Romans and find out that it tells us
[52:38] that that promise wasn't just for
[52:40] Abraham but for those who would believe
[52:43] it is to us through the Royal Seed of
[52:46] Abraham Jesus Christ we have become now
[52:50] Heirs of that promise amen what's the
[52:54] promise that by sea shall possess the
[52:58] Gate of his enemies
[53:00] praise the Lord thy seed now we are part
[53:03] of that is that our uh our heritage is
[53:06] that our lineage that we are a part of
[53:09] the faith Seed of Abraham that this
[53:11] promises to us that we now possess the
[53:15] gates of our enemy
[53:17] praise the Lord let's continue on
[53:21] amen and in thy seed shall all the
[53:24] nations of the earth be blessed because
[53:26] thou Hast obeyed my voice
[53:29] so Abraham returned unto his young man
[53:31] and they rose up and went together to
[53:33] Bear sheep and Abraham dwelt at
[53:34] Beersheba now if you have any kind of
[53:37] consternation about this if there's any
[53:39] doubt let's go to the New Testament
[53:42] Matthew chapter 16.
[53:46] amen some people today for some reason
[53:49] they don't want to obey the Old
[53:51] Testament they don't want to listen to
[53:53] the Old Testament for some reason to
[53:55] some people the Old Testament isn't a
[53:58] part of the Bible anymore
[53:59] I'm not sure where people get that from
[54:02] or they think the Old Testament doesn't
[54:04] exist anymore or the Old Testament isn't
[54:07] pertinent anymore but let me tell you
[54:09] today Saints the Old Testament is just
[54:12] as much God's word as the New Testament
[54:15] amen amen
[54:18] right
[54:19] praise the Lord
[54:22] Matthew chapter but if there's an issue
[54:24] there if anybody ever watches you got an
[54:26] issue with the Old Testament Matthew
[54:28] chapter 16.
[54:30] verse 17.
[54:32] Jesus answered her now Jesus asked him
[54:35] who do men say that I am now that's the
[54:37] background Jesus standing there with
[54:40] disciples and he said and he's asking
[54:42] them a question who the man say that I
[54:44] am what have you heard about me what
[54:47] have you heard that other people are
[54:48] saying about me who are they saying that
[54:51] I am
[54:52] Jesus answered and and Simon Peter
[54:55] answered Thou Art the Christ the son of
[54:57] the Living God and Jesus answered and
[55:00] said unto him
[55:01] blessed art thou shock Simon barjona
[55:04] which means son of Jonah Simon son of
[55:07] Jonah for Flesh and Blood hath not
[55:09] revealed it
[55:11] now what is this it
[55:14] not him but it
[55:18] because it's significant to understand
[55:20] what that is because without that
[55:23] understanding without that Revelation
[55:25] you can't understand or know by
[55:27] revelation of whom or on what the church
[55:32] the foundation of the church is built on
[55:35] you have to know what that is see and it
[55:39] is not a person
[55:41] amen people want to say like the
[55:44] Catholic Church want to say that the
[55:46] church they are the true church they say
[55:48] is built on Peter because Jesus then
[55:52] said that thou art Peter which means
[55:54] little Stone
[55:55] so they say that that church was built
[55:58] upon Peter and they claim him as the
[56:01] first pope that's what they believe yeah
[56:03] but Peter is not an it
[56:07] I mean even this world of all the
[56:09] political correctness and and and
[56:11] pronouns that people want to be uh uh
[56:15] identified in is still not a person
[56:18] even in all the gender identity stuff
[56:21] today it is still not a person now I
[56:25] know it was on the TV show of Adam's
[56:27] Family
[56:28] doesn't it but that's fiction
[56:32] that was fiction it is not a person
[56:35] listen now
[56:38] Flesh and Blood hath not revealed it
[56:41] unto thee but my Father which is in
[56:44] heaven
[56:45] revealed it
[56:48] and I say unto also unto thee that thou
[56:51] art Peter and Upon This Rock I will
[56:55] build my church and the Gates of Hell
[56:57] shall not Prevail against
[56:59] it's
[57:00] again it's what is this it that the
[57:05] church is built upon
[57:07] they again Peter Catholic Church will
[57:10] say pomp eater
[57:12] many people want to say it's Jesus that
[57:15] the church is built on and we understand
[57:16] the foundation of the church is Jesus
[57:19] but if you don't understand by
[57:22] Revelation who Jesus is then it's
[57:26] irrelevant to you
[57:27] it doesn't mean anything to you unless
[57:30] you know who Jesus is and if you think
[57:33] Jesus is just the first second or third
[57:35] person whatever they put him as in a in
[57:38] a godhead or in a trinity then you don't
[57:41] understand or have a revelation of how
[57:43] this Foundation is established it's
[57:47] established because of the Revelation
[57:49] the it is the revelation of who Jesus is
[57:54] yes
[57:55] yes the revelation of Jesus Christ being
[57:58] God Almighty is what God founded this
[58:01] church
[58:02] that Revelation not cutting him up in
[58:05] the three pieces not putting him in as
[58:08] the second person of a godhead not
[58:10] trying to include him in some Trinity
[58:12] but Jesus Christ is God Almighty amen
[58:15] amen that was his ignition and Upon This
[58:18] Rock Amen the rock of revelation of who
[58:23] Jesus Christ is this church is founded
[58:26] the Revelation who Jesus is amen and you
[58:30] can go back and look there wasn't a
[58:32] single person baptized through history
[58:33] until uh until the Catholic churches
[58:36] form a nicia Romans 3 20 A.D there
[58:39] wasn't one single person baptized in the
[58:41] name of the titles
[58:42] of the followers on the Holy Ghost
[58:44] everybody through the scripture and on
[58:47] was baptized in the name of the Lord
[58:50] Jesus Christ
[58:52] which is actually a name amen which is
[58:54] actually the foundation by which this
[58:57] church is built anything other than that
[58:59] friend is not on the right foundation
[59:02] right your foundation is a seeking sin
[59:04] their Foundation is unstable but the
[59:07] foundation that this church the bride is
[59:09] built on is the foundation that Jesus
[59:12] Christ is God almighty
[59:14] amen
[59:15] he's the one in the same praise the Lord
[59:18] now look
[59:20] now that church is built on that
[59:23] Revelation it's built on that foundation
[59:25] and that church that bride today now a
[59:29] church is a called out group
[59:31] amen it means called out separated but
[59:34] the bride is called out from the church
[59:36] the literal Church of the world has been
[59:40] called out from the world but the bride
[59:42] has been called out of the church
[59:44] she is called out into a bright age for
[59:48] this last day she is a called out group
[59:50] of the called out amen
[59:53] the bride now built upon that built upon
[59:57] it that Revelation I will build my
[1:00:00] church and this bride this church the
[1:00:04] Gates of Hell
[1:00:05] shall not Prevail against him why not
[1:00:09] because because she is the she is the
[1:00:13] the GateKeeper
[1:00:15] of the gates of hell
[1:00:18] amen
[1:00:19] what did what did God tell Abraham
[1:00:24] you will possess the gates of your enemy
[1:00:28] you possess you have the ownership of
[1:00:32] the front door of Satan's owned docile
[1:00:36] domicile
[1:00:38] you operate and own and have leadership
[1:00:41] over
[1:00:43] whether Satan can come or go
[1:00:48] oh think about that for a minute that's
[1:00:49] not just a frivolous promise things
[1:00:52] to understand that if Satan doesn't tell
[1:00:56] us what to do we tell him what to do
[1:00:59] right
[1:01:00] right now he obeys us now not because of
[1:01:03] who I am Newton Bennett but because of
[1:01:06] the life that's in me remember it's the
[1:01:08] life behind the name amen when the soul
[1:01:10] is fought
[1:01:12] and and God the Holy Spirit lives and
[1:01:15] he's sealed in there
[1:01:17] Amen in a place it
[1:01:21] it affects the spirit it's the nature of
[1:01:24] the spirit and into the body
[1:01:26] it's that new birth that separates you
[1:01:28] that makes you separate that's why the
[1:01:30] Vagabonds you could not tell that Spirit
[1:01:33] what to do because all he had was a
[1:01:36] Jesus who Paul priests and I'm afraid
[1:01:39] that's the same that a lot of people
[1:01:40] have today they only have enough Jesus
[1:01:43] to get them in trouble
[1:01:44] they only have enough Jesus to make
[1:01:46] their lives miserable friend if
[1:01:49] you're gonna come into this if you're
[1:01:51] going to do this if you're gonna be born
[1:01:53] again if you want to be a part of the
[1:01:55] body of Christ if you want to be a part
[1:01:57] of the Bride of Jesus Christ go with it
[1:02:00] don't don't go in a halfway am I don't
[1:02:03] say I want to dip a toe in or or half it
[1:02:06] half out that's the most miserable kind
[1:02:09] of life that you could ever live right
[1:02:11] amen it needs to be all in or all out
[1:02:14] now look when Jesus said
[1:02:18] that that gates of hell would not
[1:02:20] Prevail against that Revelation amen of
[1:02:23] Jesus Christ the foundation that this
[1:02:26] church this bride is built on he said
[1:02:28] and I give I will give unto thee the
[1:02:32] Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven
[1:02:35] the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven now
[1:02:37] it's not a literal key you take out of
[1:02:39] your pocket and say I want to go on my
[1:02:41] front door
[1:02:42] it's not a literal key it's an authority
[1:02:45] it's a power-up through Authority that
[1:02:49] that God is giving to Peter
[1:02:51] God is saying Jesus is telling Peter
[1:02:54] down I am giving unto you the authority
[1:02:57] of the Kingdom of Heaven
[1:03:00] and whatsoever Thou shalt bind on Earth
[1:03:02] shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever
[1:03:04] Thou shalt loosed on Earth shall be
[1:03:05] loosed in heaven now that scripture
[1:03:08] ought to settled baptism for anybody
[1:03:10] that cares anything about the scripture
[1:03:12] amen because God gave Peter people said
[1:03:15] well I do it the way Jesus said well
[1:03:17] Jesus right here gave Peter the keys
[1:03:20] that whatever he bowed on Earth was
[1:03:21] bound in heaven well if Peter come out
[1:03:24] with the keys and said be baptized in
[1:03:25] the name of Jesus Christ don't you think
[1:03:27] that's what we ought to do amen he's the
[1:03:30] one with the keys he's the one with the
[1:03:32] authority he's the one that Jesus Christ
[1:03:35] said whatever you found here is bound in
[1:03:38] heaven I will honor what you do here
[1:03:40] I'll honor there now why did God give
[1:03:43] Peter that kind of authority because he
[1:03:45] knew Peter had the character to handle
[1:03:46] it correctly
[1:03:48] he knew that Peter wouldn't do anything
[1:03:50] outside of the word or anything outside
[1:03:52] of the spirit of Christ that would cause
[1:03:54] reproach
[1:03:56] amen that's why I gave him the authority
[1:03:58] now where does that Authority belong
[1:04:00] today
[1:04:01] amen if he was in the beginning there at
[1:04:05] the beginning of and Pentecost the
[1:04:08] spokesman of Pentecost the Holy Spirit
[1:04:09] came that that Authority simply passed
[1:04:13] through down Through the Ages that every
[1:04:16] single every single age had the exact
[1:04:18] same authority to this last stage
[1:04:21] this last stage now you can say because
[1:04:25] of the uh the the victory that she has
[1:04:28] won over sin over Satan now possesses
[1:04:32] The Authority the keys to the kingdom of
[1:04:34] heaven

[1:05:23] the gate you shall possess the gates of
[1:05:26] your enemy is that the promise to those
[1:05:29] of the face seed belongs to us now to
[1:05:33] those with authority of the revelation
[1:05:34] of who Jesus Christ is it belongs to us
[1:05:38] this Authority now you tell the devil

[1:06:21] know Jesus but I don't know you
[1:06:24] what what was different about him
[1:06:25] because Paul had some Jesus was some and

[1:08:11] million dollars uh uh whatever he
[1:08:13] wouldn't have left it to me it doesn't
[1:08:14] matter but if the judge says that it
[1:08:17] belongs to you friend it belongs to you
[1:08:19] but it's only yours when you take
[1:08:21] possession of it
[1:08:23] right it's not yours until you take
[1:08:25] possession of it when you take
[1:08:27] possession of it then it becomes yours

[1:08:44] defeated hell is defeated everything is
[1:08:48] defeated oh my wish I was twice my size
[1:08:51] now maybe I feel twice as good
[1:08:53] we are disputing with a conquered enemy
[1:08:56] that's my point Saints listen don't
[1:08:59] dispute with the devil you don't have to
[1:09:02] ask permission you're not devil would

[1:09:32] want this room to be filled with 100
[1:09:33] bills

[1:09:37] not the character of Christ all right
[1:09:39] amen the power with the character look
[1:09:43] no wonder Paul could say when they was
[1:09:46] building a block to chop his head off he
[1:09:48] said oh death where's thy sting

[1:11:12] promise as the Royal Seed of Abraham
[1:11:16] as we are that Royal Seed of Abraham by
[1:11:21] birth
[1:11:22] by New Birth
[1:11:24] we are the Royal Seed of Abraham that
[1:11:27] possess the Gate of the enemy praise the
[1:11:31] Lord not only is he defeated came to go
[1:11:33] home
[1:11:34] even not unless you let him
[1:11:37] if you let him then maybe he could go
[1:11:38] home he can't go home unless you let him
[1:11:42] praise the Lord let's go over to
[1:11:43] Galatians chapter 3.
[1:11:49] now we're talking about the Holy Spirit
[1:11:52] this whole thing is about the Holy
[1:11:54] Spirit the new Earth amen
[1:11:56] to understand what does that give us
[1:11:59] what does that what does that give us
[1:12:01] the rights to
[1:12:03] amen but we have to understand it
[1:12:05] belongs to us and it doesn't it but it's
[1:12:09] not ours until we take possession of it
[1:12:12] amen you about you have to take
[1:12:14] possession of it
[1:12:16] Galatians chapter 3 verse 6.
[1:12:20] amen
[1:12:22] even as Abraham believed God and it was
[1:12:26] accounted to him for righteousness
[1:12:29] know ye therefore that they which are of
[1:12:32] Faith the same are the children of
[1:12:35] Abraham they that are what of the faith
[1:12:37] yeah
[1:12:39] those that are of the faith are you of
[1:12:41] the faith today
[1:12:42] you identify with this
[1:12:45] okay then the same are the children of
[1:12:48] Abraham well if you're the children Seed
[1:12:51] of Abraham then that promise belongs to
[1:12:53] you
[1:12:54] that promise belongs to you just as much
[1:12:57] as the natural Seed of Abraham that came
[1:12:59] forth That Couldn't actually take
[1:13:01] literal possession of what we own today
[1:13:04] amen they have possession of what they
[1:13:07] could for their day but today is the day
[1:13:09] that you own every bit of it it's your
[1:13:13] inheritance
[1:13:14] as the children of Abraham and the
[1:13:16] scripture foreseeing that God would
[1:13:19] justify the Heathen through faith
[1:13:22] preached before the gospel unto Abraham
[1:13:24] saying in thee shall All Nations be
[1:13:28] blessed in Abraham so then they which
[1:13:31] are they which be of faith are blessed
[1:13:36] with faithful Abraham you got any doubt
[1:13:39] the scripture plainly lets us know what
[1:13:42] belongs to us what our inheritance is
[1:13:44] what our position is what our
[1:13:46] possessions are belongs to us
[1:13:49] amen you don't have to fret over all the
[1:13:53] other stuff it's ours
[1:13:56] amen if
[1:13:59] if your family owned Walmart you could
[1:14:01] walk into Walmart you could take out
[1:14:03] anything you wanted
[1:14:05] now not shareholders and all that but if
[1:14:07] you just you owned it outright if you're
[1:14:09] on the corner store if you own this
[1:14:11] Denny's right here it belongs to you 100
[1:14:13] belong to you you could walk that walk
[1:14:15] in sit out ask for the most expensive
[1:14:18] Meal which probably isn't very much a
[1:14:20] Denny's and you can get the most and and
[1:14:22] eat every minute and walk out the door
[1:14:24] it's yours belongs to you
[1:14:26] I can walk in and I can tell the kitchen
[1:14:28] help they're not working like they
[1:14:29] should I could tell the waiter they
[1:14:31] didn't do a very good job I I because it
[1:14:34] belongs to me
[1:14:36] it's mine you understand
[1:14:39] and when you take possession of it
[1:14:42] it shows that you believe that it's
[1:14:45] yours
[1:14:46] see some people it seems like are scared
[1:14:48] to take possession of it because when
[1:14:51] they take possession of it it makes them
[1:14:53] responsible
[1:14:55] and unfortunately today there's a
[1:14:58] horrible Spirit around the world of
[1:14:59] people not wanting to take
[1:15:01] responsibility for things
[1:15:03] uh they can Loot and still in cheat but
[1:15:05] it's somebody else's fault they can kill
[1:15:08] people and they can injure people and
[1:15:10] can push people in the Subways and they
[1:15:13] can cheat and steal and hit people
[1:15:15] upside the head with the ball back but
[1:15:16] it's somebody else's fault
[1:15:18] uh it's it's I my upbringing or I was
[1:15:22] cheated here or this have and excuse
[1:15:24] everything away there's no
[1:15:26] accountability right
[1:15:28] right every little Nuance in a person's
[1:15:31] life there's some kind of a medical
[1:15:32] diagnosis to call it the jqpf19723
[1:15:39] and what is that I have no idea but
[1:15:41] they're probably going to come up with
[1:15:42] this one day
[1:15:44] because of some kind of a disorder now
[1:15:46] don't get me wrong I know that the
[1:15:49] Humanity's getting rotten friend but it
[1:15:51] comes a time where a person has to take
[1:15:53] personal responsibility for their own
[1:15:55] actions right and unfortunately today a
[1:15:58] lot of people don't want to take
[1:16:00] responsibility because once you take
[1:16:03] possession of it you're responsible for
[1:16:05] it
[1:16:06] amen your your family might own this
[1:16:10] Denny's but if you don't do it and treat
[1:16:12] it and and present it correctly
[1:16:15] it will fail
[1:16:17] and it won't be anybody's fault but
[1:16:19] yours right
[1:16:21] right you ever heard of the the phrase
[1:16:23] the book stops here not one of my
[1:16:25] favorite phrases but that's the truth
[1:16:29] it comes a place in time where
[1:16:31] somebody's got to take responsibility
[1:16:33] because there's always somebody every
[1:16:37] human walks this planet has someone they
[1:16:40] have to answer to yeah
[1:16:42] amen and that's God very much everybody
[1:16:45] I don't care who they are I don't care
[1:16:48] where they come from I don't care what
[1:16:49] Authority his position they have I don't
[1:16:51] care if they're the smartest richest
[1:16:54] most powerful doesn't matter every human
[1:16:57] answers to at least one and that's God
[1:17:01] people don't want to take that Authority
[1:17:03] because they don't want the
[1:17:04] responsibility
[1:17:05] friend would rock with the
[1:17:07] responsibility with that power comes
[1:17:09] great responsibility to handle it
[1:17:11] properly
[1:17:12] they meant to handle it correctly but if
[1:17:15] you're born again you're not the spirit
[1:17:16] of God then God lives in you then you
[1:17:20] can trust and believe that what is Wing
[1:17:22] uh uh manifested out of you
[1:17:25] what it what is being manifested out of
[1:17:28] you is in accordance to the word of God
[1:17:30] Amen the spirit of God the truth of God
[1:17:33] used to be that back in the 80s I
[1:17:36] believe 90s they had that little
[1:17:38] bracelet wwjd what would Jesus do right
[1:17:41] you don't ever see him anymore but it's
[1:17:43] very true Unfortunately today you hear a
[1:17:45] lot of the other uh what would this
[1:17:48] person do or what would that person do
[1:17:49] or what would this burn I don't really
[1:17:50] care what that person would do I care
[1:17:52] about what he cares about what would he
[1:17:54] do yeah how would he do it yeah yes amen
[1:17:57] honestly
[1:17:59] I don't even want to do it the way
[1:18:00] brother random did necessarily I want to
[1:18:03] do it the way he did how does he want it
[1:18:06] done that's what I want now now
[1:18:07] understand I believe that what brother
[1:18:10] random did was in accordance to what he
[1:18:12] wanted to do but my relationship isn't
[1:18:15] with me brother Bradham and him my
[1:18:16] relationship with me and him
[1:18:19] praise the Lord that's where my
[1:18:21] authority comes from praise God not
[1:18:24] because brother Branham said but because
[1:18:26] Jesus said
[1:18:28] amen
[1:18:29] thank God that we know we have a prophet
[1:18:32] that said what he said yes praise the
[1:18:35] Lord so as I just did we can quote
[1:18:37] things understanding that that wasn't
[1:18:40] brother branham's Authority
[1:18:42] that was God's Authority yeah that was
[1:18:44] from Christ the word that's why it all
[1:18:47] matches up perfect amen kids to
[1:18:50] understand the devil doesn't control you
[1:18:52] you control
[1:18:54] we act so many times like the he
[1:18:57] controls us
[1:18:58] amen he doesn't control us we control
[1:19:01] him look at this real quick
[1:19:05] I'll read another one out of authority
[1:19:07] the token Shreveport look now
[1:19:11] in him is all fools in him is all the
[1:19:14] fullness of God all the fullness of the
[1:19:15] promise
[1:19:16] when we're baptized into him

[1:19:39] that not even sickness can stay in his

[1:20:16] token there and say I am the product
[1:20:20] that Jesus Christ bought and sickness
[1:20:22] please
[1:20:24] I am that problem I belong to him and
[1:20:27] Satan has no authority over me that God
[1:20:30] does not allow
[1:20:31] amen none zero Romans chapter 8.
[1:20:39] I got a couple more scriptures I want to
[1:20:41] read Romans chapter eight
[1:20:43] verse 1.
[1:20:46] there is therefore now you know how I
[1:20:49] love that word right yeah there is
[1:20:51] therefore now no condemnation to them
[1:20:55] which are in Christ Jesus who walk not
[1:20:58] after the flesh but after the spirit
[1:21:00] no condemnation if you're in Christ
[1:21:04] no condemnation as you walk after the
[1:21:07] spirit and not after the pledge no
[1:21:09] condemnation in you at all now Satan is
[1:21:13] going to try to come and condemn you
[1:21:16] but there's no condemnation I don't care
[1:21:18] what Satan tries to do and now is a
[1:21:21] Perpetual now existence it always is
[1:21:24] and now is not a tomorrow it's not a
[1:21:26] yesterday it is a noun
[1:21:28] right now no condemnation
[1:21:31] you're in Christ no condemnation Satan
[1:21:35] tries to come and bring you condemnation
[1:21:36] you know what to tell him
[1:21:39] display have your token on display let
[1:21:41] it know you are the purchased product of
[1:21:44] Jesus Christ
[1:21:45] you hear Brother Branham say I've said
[1:21:47] to myself
[1:21:48] take your hands off of God's Property
[1:21:52] why because he has no right being on
[1:21:54] God's Property
[1:21:56] amen when you have that authority to
[1:21:59] command him to go
[1:22:01] because you tell him where to go you
[1:22:03] tell him what to do
[1:22:05] for the law of the spirit of life in
[1:22:07] Christ Jesus had made me free from the
[1:22:10] law of sin and death
[1:22:11] for what the law could not do it is we
[1:22:14] that it was weak through the flesh God
[1:22:15] sending his own son in the likeness of
[1:22:17] sinful flesh and for sin condemn sin in
[1:22:21] the flesh because he was sinless if he
[1:22:24] lived a perfect sinless life in the
[1:22:26] human flesh
[1:22:28] that the righteousness of the law might
[1:22:31] be fulfilled in us who walked not after
[1:22:33] the flesh but after the spirit what is
[1:22:35] the righteousness of the law Jesus
[1:22:37] Christ amen Jesus Christ is the
[1:22:39] righteousness of the law and if Jesus
[1:22:41] Christ lives in you you are now
[1:22:43] righteous as he is righteous
[1:22:47] clothed in his righteousness without a
[1:22:50] spot wrinkle or blemish
[1:22:53] you got to believe that Saints yes
[1:22:57] Humanity has
[1:22:59] a tendency to look on the negative all
[1:23:01] the time
[1:23:03] I do it
[1:23:04] look on the mistakes look on the things
[1:23:06] you did wrong look on the little
[1:23:08] slip-ups and that's what the devil's
[1:23:10] gonna try to make you focus on but
[1:23:12] that's not who you are
[1:23:15] amen you are Christ veiled in flesh
[1:23:19] praise the Lord the righteousness of the
[1:23:22] law for they that are after The Flesh do
[1:23:24] mind the things of the flesh but they
[1:23:26] that are at the Spirit the things of the
[1:23:27] spirit for to be carnally minded is
[1:23:30] death
[1:23:31] but to be spiritually minded is life and
[1:23:33] peace because the carnal mind is enmity
[1:23:37] against God for it is not subject to the
[1:23:40] law of God neither indeed can be
[1:23:43] so then they that are in the flesh
[1:23:45] cannot please God
[1:23:47] but ye are not in the flesh but in the
[1:23:49] spirit
[1:23:50] the spirit of God capital is not your
[1:23:53] own human spirit
[1:23:54] if so be that the spirit of God dwell in
[1:23:57] you now if any man have not the spirit
[1:24:00] of Christ he is none of his and if
[1:24:01] Christ be in you the body is dead
[1:24:03] because of sin but the spirit is life
[1:24:05] because of righteousness again
[1:24:08] getting to our trial being
[1:24:11] the soul of man is what lives
[1:24:14] body and spirit
[1:24:16] they can be subject to the things of the
[1:24:18] world
[1:24:19] amen
[1:24:20] subject to not ownership
[1:24:23] but if the spirit of him that raised up
[1:24:26] Jesus from uh from the dead dwell in you
[1:24:29] he that raised up Christ from the dead
[1:24:32] shall also Quicken or make alive your
[1:24:36] mortal bodies by his spirit that
[1:24:38] dwelleth in you made you a
[1:24:42] lot by his spirit that lives in you now
[1:24:45] that now you have become more than a
[1:24:47] conqueror you are the one that possessed
[1:24:50] the gates of the enemy you are the ones
[1:24:52] that has the Keys of the Kingdom you are
[1:24:55] the one that owns all the promises that
[1:24:57] God has given us to be able to have
[1:24:59] ownership of responsibility to that you
[1:25:03] live a a Victorious Life in Christ Jesus

[1:26:32] taken the token that they had asked her
[1:26:34] to display and kept it in her living
[1:26:36] room she would have been destroyed
[1:26:39] don't matter what the promise said don't
[1:26:41] matter how and what they had who she had
[1:26:44] in her home if the token wasn't
[1:26:46] displayed there was no promise
[1:26:49] the promise was null and void at that
[1:26:51] point the token had to be on display
[1:26:54] before the promise would be enforced
[1:26:58] and once the token was let out the
[1:27:01] window it was on display for all of them
[1:27:04] to see then everything her and everyone

[1:27:29] saved
[1:27:30] whoever it was they believed they were
[1:27:33] saved Rahab her family was saved why
[1:27:36] because she applied the token

[1:28:51] an entryway into our lives entryway into
[1:28:55] our hearts entryway into our minds we

[1:30:22] Ephesians 2 1 you hath he quickened who
[1:30:26] were dead in trespasses in sin
[1:30:28] where an entire past you walked
[1:30:30] according to the course of the world
[1:30:32] according to the prince of the power of
[1:30:34] the air the spirit that now worketh in
[1:30:36] the children of Disobedience Satan the
[1:30:39] devil
[1:30:40] among them also we all had our
[1:30:43] conversation in time passed in the lusts
[1:30:45] of our flesh fulfilling the desires of
[1:30:48] the Flesh and of the mind and we're by
[1:30:50] Nature the children of Wrath even as
[1:30:52] others remember what that nature was
[1:30:54] that nature was your soul
[1:30:56] the soul is the nature of the spirit
[1:30:58] amen it's that nature that caused you to
[1:31:02] sin to live that way now your nature is
[1:31:05] God Jesus Christ the Holy Spirit your
[1:31:08] nature now is of God then
[1:31:10] everything that comes from that is of
[1:31:13] god
[1:31:15] amen once you were dead in sins but now
[1:31:19] you are dead to sin
[1:31:22] sin has no hold over you anymore
[1:31:24] praise God
[1:31:26] and boy we could go to First John 3 but
[1:31:28] we're going to keep going here but God
[1:31:30] who is rich in Mercy that'll probably be
[1:31:33] God who is rich in Mercy for his great
[1:31:35] love wherewith he loved us even when we
[1:31:37] were dead in sins dead in sins hath
[1:31:40] quickened us again there's that word
[1:31:42] made us alive together quickened is to
[1:31:45] make alive with Christ
[1:31:48] praise the Lord by grace are you saved
[1:31:50] and hath raised us up together and made
[1:31:53] us sit in Heavenly places in Christ
[1:31:54] Jesus that in the ages to come he might
[1:31:57] show his exceeding Riches of the grace
[1:31:59] and his kindness toward us through
[1:32:01] Christ Jesus for by grace are ye saved
[1:32:04] through faith and that not of ourselves
[1:32:06] it is the gift of God not of Works lest
[1:32:08] any man should boast for we are his
[1:32:11] workmanship
[1:32:12] praise the lord we are his workmanship
[1:32:15] created in Christ Jesus unto good works
[1:32:19] which God hath before ordained that we
[1:32:22] should walk in them

[1:33:35] you don't grasp the triunity of the
[1:33:38] human being of the body spirit and soul
[1:33:40] and understand that we make up three
[1:33:44] distinct different personalities if you
