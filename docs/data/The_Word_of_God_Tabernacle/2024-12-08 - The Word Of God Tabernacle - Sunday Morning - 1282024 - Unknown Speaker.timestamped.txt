[46:41] scripture reading
[46:44] seconds continue with the thought we had
[46:46] last weeken going Beyond the
[46:49] Veil part
[46:51] two amen Lord willing it um the way it
[46:55] looks now it'll be
[46:57] today and next Sunday see if how it
[47:01] works out that way Amen to finish this
[47:04] up the thing that the main part of the
[47:07] reason this came about actually is more
[47:10] going to be part three but um as I
[47:14] started looking at that part of it uh it
[47:18] kind of evolved from there to what
[47:20] became Parts one and now too so U anyway
[47:23] so 2 Kings 6 verse 13 we mentioned this
[47:27] last week uh I want to read it to begin
[47:30] our thought here for today amen so 2
[47:33] Kings chapter 6 we we'll from there
[47:36] let's just bow our heads from a word of
[47:38] prayer
[47:40] from Lord Jesus so very thankful once
[47:43] again Lord of blessing us with uh this
[47:46] place this time Lord this service we
[47:49] thank you Lord that you're with us God
[47:51] and that you never leave us or forsake
[47:52] us thank you again for this precious
[47:55] word Lord in this message message that
[47:57] we hold so dear to our hearts thank you
[47:59] Lord for not just the letter of the word
[48:01] but revealing it to our hearts and
[48:03] showing us in here what you'd have us to
[48:05] see and know Lord because we know that
[48:08] you did it for us Lord it is us that you
[48:11] came uh to redeem those that were
[48:13] redeemable to reveal to those who could
[48:16] receive Revelation for those whose eyes
[48:19] would be open Lord and the veil would be
[48:21] pulled back so that it would no longer
[48:23] be a mystery Lord but it would be
[48:24] something that's revealed in the open to
[48:27] us yes to others it may certainly still
[48:29] yet be a mystery God but to those who
[48:31] believe those who have received God it
[48:34] is no longer a mystery it's no longer
[48:36] something that's in the dark it's been
[48:38] manifested and made known God we thank
[48:41] you Lord for showing it to us Lord for
[48:43] opening our eyes and for us Lord to be
[48:45] able to fall in uh uh be in your kingdom
[48:48] as a part of your plan Lord God we pray
[48:51] that you'd have complete control the
[48:53] main part of the service Lord God may
[48:56] you just receive the worship father unto
[48:58] you as a sweet smelling Savior and now
[49:00] as your word comes forth may you heal us
[49:02] Lord and strengthen Us by it God as you
[49:05] speak to us along the way let it be to
[49:08] us God as we commit it to you the
[49:10] purpose God that you've have for this
[49:12] service today all those that are here
[49:14] may be streaming God let it be as we
[49:16] commit it into your hands we ask it and
[49:19] pray in the precious holy name of our
[49:21] Lord and Savior Jesus Christ we ask amen
[49:24] amen amen praise the Lord 2 Kings uh
[49:29] chapter 6 I'm just going to read one
[49:31] verse of scripture and then I'll let you
[49:32] be
[49:33] seated uh 2 Kings chapter 6 verse 17
[49:39] read 17 and let you be seated and then
[49:41] go back over the story a little bit we
[49:42] mentioned it last week in passing about
[49:45] this but I felt to start here with this
[49:47] story reading it today so 2 Kings 6:17
[49:52] and Elisha prayed and said Lord I pray
[49:55] thee open his eyes
[49:57] that he may see and the Lord opened the
[49:59] eyes of the young man and he saw and
[50:01] behold the mountain was full of horses
[50:04] and Chariots of Fire round about Elijah
[50:08] you can be seated if you'd
[50:10] like amen I want to read some more of
[50:12] the story if we can go back up to uh uh
[50:16] the 13th
[50:18] verse amen the king of
[50:20] Syria uh was upset uh of Israel was
[50:25] Waring with Israel and some unusual news
[50:28] today about Syria I guess uh Syria has
[50:31] been overthrown so the Syria of today I
[50:34] guess as things are changing in the
[50:36] Middle East still continuing to evolve
[50:39] continuing to change and you know if
[50:41] it's in the Middle East it's got to have
[50:42] some scriptural significance I can't say
[50:45] that I'm smart enough to know it all but
[50:48] um I'm it will unfold the way that God
[50:51] has it planned to unfold but at this day
[50:53] king of Syria Waring against Israel uh
[50:56] was was uh was upset with what was going
[50:58] on because Israel had a prophet in that
[51:01] day called Elisha and that Prophet knew
[51:04] all the things that God would reveal to
[51:06] him that was going on to be able to come
[51:08] against Syria and the king of Syria was
[51:11] mad about it and they said what are we
[51:13] going to do uh is it is there anybody
[51:15] that you know that uh that uh that uh is
[51:19] in this position that that is uh doing
[51:22] all this that that is giving us all
[51:25] these problems and and and they're like
[51:27] no King only one we know of is the
[51:29] prophet in Israel named Elisha this man
[51:33] is telling the king of Israel the very
[51:35] things that you're speaking in your bed
[51:38] chamber amen God knows no matter where
[51:41] you are no matter what's going on no
[51:43] matter what the situation God knows and
[51:45] if God knows he can show it to a prophet
[51:48] yes he can show it to any of us really
[51:50] but amen that gift of a prophetic gift
[51:53] God could show to him so God was
[51:55] revealing to Elisha the things that this
[51:57] King was saying in his own bed chamber
[52:00] amen so the king said let's go spy this
[52:02] out let's find out about this guy I want
[52:04] to bring him in here and I want to have
[52:06] a discussion with him so we'll start
[52:07] with the 13th verse amen the 12th verse
[52:11] uh talks about the servant said no my
[52:13] Lord oh King but elishah the prophet
[52:14] that is in Israel tth the king of Israel
[52:17] the words that thou speakest in thy bed
[52:19] chamber amen praise the Lord and he said
[52:23] go the the king of Syrian said go and
[52:26] spy where he is that I may send and
[52:29] fetch him and it was told him saying
[52:31] behold he is in
[52:33] Dothan therefore sent hether horses and
[52:36] chariots and a great host and they came
[52:39] by night and compassed the city about
[52:42] and when the servant of the man of God
[52:44] was risen early Gaza is this servant was
[52:47] risen early gone forth behold and host
[52:51] Compass the city both with horses and
[52:53] chariots and his servant said unto him
[52:56] Al last ask my master how shall we do
[52:59] because all he could see was the
[53:01] enemy amen you know that's a sad state
[53:05] to be in Saint when it when as
[53:08] Christians we call ourselves Christians
[53:11] that sometimes it seems like all we can
[53:13] see is the
[53:14] enemy amen and we say God help me to be
[53:17] able to see the Promise help me to be
[53:19] able to see you not just the enemy we
[53:22] should never only focus on the bad we
[53:26] should never only focus on the wrong or
[53:29] the things that's happened that has been
[53:31] uh contrary or against never Focus
[53:35] always focus on Jesus Christ never have
[53:38] your eyes only on the enemy right never
[53:41] have your eyes only on the problem never
[53:44] have your eyes only on the
[53:46] circumstances have your eyes focused on
[53:49] the promise am have your eyes focused on
[53:52] Jesus Christ and the solution not the
[53:55] problem amen but all Gaza could see was
[54:00] the problem all he could see was the
[54:02] enemy that was Comm that was surrounded
[54:05] he said Master what are we going to do
[54:08] and he answered fear not for they that
[54:10] be with us are more than that be with
[54:13] them well I could say the same thing
[54:15] today amen more is with us than what's
[54:19] with them amen greater is the solution
[54:22] than the problem better is the answer
[54:26] than the problem amen greater Is God
[54:29] than all anything that hell could throw
[54:32] against you praise the Lord amen more
[54:35] with us than there are with
[54:37] them and again Elisha prayed and said
[54:41] Lord I pray thee open his eyes now
[54:43] obviously his eyes were open man again
[54:45] we're talking about a veil obviously his
[54:48] eyes were open his natural physical eyes
[54:51] were open because you looked around and
[54:53] could see all the enemy around him
[54:55] that's why he went to Elisha and said
[54:57] Elisha we're in trouble they've got it
[55:00] the enemy has got us compassed around
[55:02] about what are we going to do so
[55:04] obviously his physical eyes were open
[55:06] that he could see but now Elisha is
[55:09] praying to God and said God lord I pray
[55:12] thee open his eyes what what part of his
[55:16] eyes was God to open to pull back the
[55:19] veil so that he could look into actually
[55:22] another dimension if you will to see all
[55:25] the horse es and Chariots of Fire round
[55:28] about as we just read the mountain was
[55:30] full of horses and Chariots of Fire
[55:32] round about Elisha pull back the veil so
[55:36] he could see into that Dimension where
[55:38] all of the uh uh all of the uh uh horses
[55:42] and Chariots of Fire and angels all
[55:44] around about Amen to have them
[55:46] surrounded well if we keep our eyes
[55:49] focused on that then we can understand
[55:50] that there is not one thing that come
[55:53] against me there's not one weapon that
[55:55] can come against me that can prosper why
[55:58] because greater is he that's in Me
[56:01] Greater in he that is have us H uh
[56:04] compassed around about us and the angels
[56:07] of God all surrounding about us we know
[56:10] that's the scripture around about us
[56:12] amen they they don't go to lunch they
[56:15] don't have dinner they don't go out to
[56:16] eat they don't Slumber they don't sleep
[56:19] they're around you all the time yes your
[56:21] body your mind your thoughts everything
[56:23] about you amen so if God is there to
[56:27] protect amen with flaming swords drawn
[56:31] the white enemy can penetrate that it's
[56:34] what God has given us to keep us
[56:36] protected yes amen now that it didn't
[56:39] prevent the enemy from coming in because
[56:42] look we know what happened next when
[56:44] they came down to him now the enemy
[56:46] comes down but thank God gaz's eyes were
[56:49] open the veil was lifted back and he was
[56:52] able to see into the spirit realm uh
[56:54] outside of just the physical that was
[56:56] around now obviously all the enemy they
[56:58] didn't see those Chariots of Fire and
[57:00] all of the horse the mountains full of
[57:02] all the angels and Chariots of Fire they
[57:04] didn't see it if they had seen it they
[57:06] would have probably went back home
[57:09] right what enemy would not Retreat when
[57:13] their enemy when their adversary is
[57:15] outnumbered them 100 to one or whatever
[57:18] it was uh by a lot what enemy would not
[57:22] retreat they would have probably went
[57:23] back home so it was only that's the
[57:26] Prophet saw it and as the prophet saw he
[57:28] asked Lord let my servant see it and God
[57:32] opened his eyes and he could see it so
[57:34] that took all the worry away there was
[57:36] no more worry now gazel wasn't worried
[57:39] anymore least it doesn't say he was
[57:42] there's no more evidence that gazer was
[57:44] worried anymore when we know that
[57:46] there's more with us that takes the
[57:48] worry away yes there's nothing to worry
[57:51] about nothing to be threatened over
[57:53] concerned about amen cuz we know that
[57:57] more is with us yes God's going to make
[57:59] it all work he always does yes always
[58:02] will amen when they came down to Elisha
[58:06] now Elisha prayed 18th verse unto the
[58:10] Lord and said Smite this people I pray
[58:13] thee with
[58:14] blindness and he smoked them with
[58:17] blindness according to um according to
[58:20] the word of Elisha and Elisha said unto
[58:24] them this is not the way NE neither is
[58:26] this the city follow me and I will bring
[58:28] you to the man whom you seek but he led
[58:31] them to
[58:33] Samaria now look
[58:37] they it doesn't
[58:39] specify but I believe of that God
[58:42] dropped a veil over their eyes so that
[58:45] they would not recognize
[58:48] Elisha or recognize even their
[58:51] surroundings if you
[58:53] will uh if they had been smoked with
[58:56] physical blindness they probably would
[58:58] not have stayed they uh this wouldn't
[59:00] have been something that uh that that
[59:02] they would have done this is something
[59:04] that God smoked them with blindness so
[59:06] they would not know who he was right
[59:08] amen but notice as he led them he led
[59:12] them to
[59:13] Samaria amen away from where they were
[59:16] supposed to be right in the heart of the
[59:20] enemy right into a trap I mean really I
[59:23] if if he wanted to uh if they wanted to
[59:26] at that time the king of Israel and and
[59:29] Elisha said well now that you they just
[59:31] slaughtered every one of them if they
[59:33] wanted to amen because they were brought
[59:36] right in the middle of the enemy Elisha
[59:39] let them right in the middle of a of
[59:42] enemy territory if you will and it came
[59:45] to pass when they were come into Samaria
[59:48] that Elisha said Lord Open the Eyes of
[59:51] the men that they may see and the Lord
[59:53] opened their eyes and they saw and
[59:55] behold that they were in the midst of
[59:57] Samaria so they were so blinded that
[1:00:00] they didn't even know that Elisha was
[1:00:02] sending them into the heart of the enemy
[1:00:05] right because they didn't realize they
[1:00:07] were in Samaria until God opened their
[1:00:09] eyes and then they realized they were in
[1:00:11] the middle of Samaria so then the king
[1:00:14] asked and said uh the king of Israel
[1:00:17] said un Elisha uh when he saw them my
[1:00:19] father shall I smite them shall I smite
[1:00:22] them and Elisha is like no no no no
[1:00:24] don't do that amen men give them bread
[1:00:27] give them water feed them amen isn't
[1:00:31] that what happens when God says that to
[1:00:33] us about our
[1:00:35] enemies we're not supposed to speak bad
[1:00:38] of our enemies we're not supposed to uh
[1:00:41] do horrible harmful things to our enemy
[1:00:44] we're supposed to love our enemy yes
[1:00:46] we're supposed to pray for our enemy yes
[1:00:48] we're supposed to help our enemy when
[1:00:49] they're in need that's what we're as
[1:00:52] Christians that's what we're supposed to
[1:00:53] do and and when they came the the the
[1:00:56] king said shall I smite them shall I
[1:00:57] smite them and he answered Thou shalt
[1:00:59] not Smite them wouldest thou Smite Those
[1:01:02] whom thou H has taken captive with thy
[1:01:04] sword and with thy bow set bread and
[1:01:07] water before them that they may eat and
[1:01:09] drink and go to their
[1:01:11] Master what kind of a testimony I'm not
[1:01:14] going to read the rest of the story you
[1:01:15] can read it if you haven't already but
[1:01:17] or reread it but what kind of a
[1:01:20] testimony would they have going back to
[1:01:23] the king of Syria if they can to the
[1:01:26] king of Syria and said you know we got
[1:01:28] there and we were at Dothan and we had
[1:01:30] the place
[1:01:31] surrounded but somebody we came up to wh
[1:01:35] whom they were looking for to take back
[1:01:38] God blinded their eyes took us in the
[1:01:40] middle of Samaria and you know what the
[1:01:43] King was there and could have
[1:01:44] slaughtered every one of us but they
[1:01:47] didn't even so much as Hold Us captive
[1:01:50] they gave us bread and water and sent us
[1:01:53] back
[1:01:54] here what testimony amen I when you when
[1:01:59] you think about a normal uh uh situation
[1:02:03] of adversaries
[1:02:06] enemies this does not fit that bill most
[1:02:10] people don't treat their enemies this
[1:02:12] way right and send those soldiers and
[1:02:16] those that were of Syria back to Syria
[1:02:19] back to their Master yes amen you want
[1:02:23] to have a place of peace
[1:02:26] that's how you do it amen a place of
[1:02:29] peace is to bring it together say well
[1:02:32] you know he could have killed us but he
[1:02:34] didn't yes but notice as I said said
[1:02:37] last week getting back to our subject as
[1:02:39] I said last week
[1:02:41] God God Veil God opened the eyes lifted
[1:02:46] the veil of Gesa took back the the the
[1:02:49] veil from his eyes to see into that
[1:02:52] other dimension to see those angels
[1:02:54] those Chariots of Fire around but then
[1:02:56] when it came to the enemy God blinded
[1:02:59] their eyes yes the same thing that
[1:03:02] opened Gaza eyes is the same thing that
[1:03:06] blinded the enemy the syrians the same
[1:03:09] thing blinded their eyes to see who
[1:03:12] Elisha was and even to the point of
[1:03:15] taking them into the middle of Samaria
[1:03:17] right the one that opened was the one
[1:03:20] that closed amen and and uh uh closed so
[1:03:25] the enemy could not see amen you think
[1:03:28] that's that same God could do the same
[1:03:30] thing for us today yes amen amen
[1:03:34] absolutely because God is still God yes
[1:03:37] God watches over us God is a good God
[1:03:40] now look again that the that
[1:03:44] Veil that God used remember we talked
[1:03:46] about Adam and Eve amen trading that
[1:03:49] Holy Veil for that lust
[1:03:52] Veil now God is showing that he unveiled
[1:03:56] the eyes of Gesa veiled the eyes of the
[1:03:59] enemy same thing God uses the same thing
[1:04:03] now
[1:04:05] um I want to go let me read this one
[1:04:08] scripture real
[1:04:09] quick
[1:04:11] um let me read two scriptures and then
[1:04:14] I'll kind of try to continue with my
[1:04:15] thought because I it's God's changing
[1:04:18] things up here so let's go to uh Matthew
[1:04:21] chap 11 I want to read one verse of
[1:04:23] scripture very familiar scripture
[1:04:24] reading Amen to
[1:04:28] to put what we're talking about kind of
[1:04:30] in continuity here in line but uh
[1:04:33] Matthew chap
[1:04:35] 11 uh one verse verse
[1:04:38] 25 Matthew
[1:04:48] 11:25 amen Matthew 11:25 at that time
[1:04:52] Jesus answered and said I thank thee oh
[1:04:56] Father Lord of Heaven and Earth because
[1:04:58] thou H has hid these things from the
[1:05:01] wise and
[1:05:02] prudent and has revealed them unto
[1:05:06] babes you have hid it from the wise and
[1:05:10] prudent but you've revealed it unto
[1:05:13] babes the very same thing that closes
[1:05:17] the eyes of the
[1:05:18] unbeliever is the same thing that opens
[1:05:21] the eyes of the believer amen so the
[1:05:23] unbeliever can't see the very thing that
[1:05:27] the believer is looking straight at
[1:05:31] right
[1:05:32] amen an unbeliever and a Believer could
[1:05:35] read the same scripture and one can come
[1:05:38] out and say you need to be baptized in
[1:05:41] the father Son and the Holy Ghost and
[1:05:43] the believer will come out and say you
[1:05:44] need to be baptized in the name of the
[1:05:46] Lord Jesus Christ amen because there's a
[1:05:49] revelation to the word to understand an
[1:05:52] unbeliever can take you and say now look
[1:05:54] I'll show you the script scripture
[1:05:56] there's there's one God there's two Gods
[1:05:58] there's three gods or an an unbeliever
[1:06:02] can actually come and say here's one God
[1:06:04] two Gods you know there's actually more
[1:06:06] scriptures to substantiate two gods and
[1:06:08] three Gods right but that's to the
[1:06:11] unbeliever they don't see the godhead is
[1:06:14] the truth you can go and you look at a
[1:06:16] scripture God reveals that whole
[1:06:18] scripture as you read through and you
[1:06:20] can look and you can see of course
[1:06:22] certain scriptures that it's just
[1:06:24] perfectly plain is the nose on your face
[1:06:27] that there's only one God yes that one
[1:06:30] God manifests himself in all of these
[1:06:33] offices to prove himself to to in
[1:06:37] whatever condition situation whoever it
[1:06:39] is Amen to us we know what he does and
[1:06:44] he sent his only son in the form of a
[1:06:48] baby in flesh that that flesh blinded
[1:06:53] the eyes of the unbeliever they couldn't
[1:06:54] see it right amen but it opens the eyes
[1:06:58] of those who do see it those that it's
[1:07:00] revealed to it's the same thing that
[1:07:02] opens is the same thing that closes
[1:07:04] right they look at it and it's closed
[1:07:07] they see three gods and they won't see
[1:07:09] anything else right we look at it we say
[1:07:11] how could you see three Gods right amen
[1:07:15] there can only be one yes and how many
[1:07:18] scriptures that we see that manifest the
[1:07:21] realization that there's only one God
[1:07:25] Amen
[1:07:26] well you just have to skip over that
[1:07:28] that's why they try to say well there's
[1:07:29] one God and uh uh in in uh three forms
[1:07:34] or three persons I think they say three
[1:07:36] persons but that one that those three
[1:07:39] persons is one
[1:07:41] person that doesn't even make common
[1:07:43] sense that doesn't even make natural
[1:07:45] sense much l scriptural sense that that
[1:07:49] makes no sense at all if you got three
[1:07:51] people you got three personalities you
[1:07:53] got three people right amen
[1:07:56] if you got one God who in him manifests
[1:08:00] all of the other attributes as Son and
[1:08:03] Holy Spirit and uh in MDC and in the in
[1:08:06] the power Pillar of Fire and the cloud
[1:08:08] and God manifests himself in many
[1:08:10] different ways the logos coming out of
[1:08:12] God the word of God coming out and
[1:08:14] manifesting in in in in the mzc and all
[1:08:18] the all of the manifestations that God
[1:08:20] has shown himself in those that are
[1:08:23] veiled to it can't see it right when God
[1:08:25] came to the pillar of cloud the uh to to
[1:08:28] Saul the men fell down but Saul
[1:08:32] worshiped God yes who art thou Lord
[1:08:36] right because he knew his the scales
[1:08:39] came off his eyes and he knew it could
[1:08:41] see a manifestation of the scripture of
[1:08:45] the Torah right there in front of him as
[1:08:48] that voice spoke to him I am Jesus who
[1:08:50] now
[1:08:52] persecutes amen amen the others heard
[1:08:54] Rumblings and no noises or whatever they
[1:08:56] heard
[1:08:58] amen Saul heard it God changed his name
[1:09:02] God blinded him right there physical
[1:09:06] blindness and took him in uh uh to be
[1:09:10] taken care of and nurtured and prayed
[1:09:12] for so he could pray and then God opened
[1:09:14] his eyes and he came out went he went
[1:09:17] into the darkness of Saul and he came
[1:09:19] out into the light as Paul right praise
[1:09:22] God the same God yeah amen amen amen was
[1:09:26] blinded but then revelated by the same
[1:09:30] God by the same thing those who don't
[1:09:32] believe the unbeliever is blinded to the
[1:09:35] things that you and I
[1:09:37] see because it's revealed to us and
[1:09:41] Jesus said I thank you Lord that you
[1:09:43] have hid it from the wise and prudent
[1:09:45] but revealed it to babes such as would
[1:09:47] learn there are eyes are holding to it
[1:09:50] they won't ever see it but now in
[1:09:53] Revelation in re ation especially in
[1:09:56] this age this age
[1:10:00] specifically unto the age unto the angel
[1:10:03] of the Church of L to see and write
[1:10:04] these things the amen the faithful true
[1:10:07] witness the beginning of the creation of
[1:10:09] God which is Jesus I Know Thy works that
[1:10:12] thou art neither cold nor hot I would
[1:10:14] thou work cold or hot so then because
[1:10:16] Thou Art lukewarm and neither cold nor
[1:10:18] hot I will spew out of my mouth because
[1:10:21] thou sayest I am rich and increased with
[1:10:23] goods and have need of nothing in my
[1:10:26] doesn't that just it absolutely pinpoint
[1:10:29] this generation amen this age yes have
[1:10:33] need of nothing and knowest not that
[1:10:37] thou are wretched and miserable and poor
[1:10:40] and
[1:10:41] blind and naked now there are blind
[1:10:45] people in the world today but there are
[1:10:47] far more people that can see physically
[1:10:50] see than what are blind so what's the
[1:10:53] blindness he's talking about that this l
[1:10:55] this leot and AG is stricken with
[1:10:58] spiritual blindness amen but Jesus said
[1:11:01] I thank you Lord that you've hit it from
[1:11:03] the wise and prudent they're blind to it
[1:11:06] can't see it oh how many places we find
[1:11:08] in the scripture that that veil has come
[1:11:11] on and how many places we find that God
[1:11:14] lifts that Veil that you can see it we
[1:11:18] see you look at the scripture friend
[1:11:20] when I read the Bible I don't find any
[1:11:23] way in this Bible
[1:11:25] that would that would constitute me
[1:11:28] baptizing in the name of the Lord in the
[1:11:30] father Son and Holy Ghost there's not
[1:11:31] one place right people said well Jesus
[1:11:34] said well that is true he said in the
[1:11:39] name amen K amen what about the guards
[1:11:43] that are guarding the gospels yes amen
[1:11:46] look it's not for everybody to see and
[1:11:48] not everybody's going to see it but he
[1:11:51] hid those things from the wise and
[1:11:53] prudent rich increase with Goods thou
[1:11:58] are wretched miserable and poor and
[1:12:02] blind and naked don't know it that's
[1:12:06] just it now today naked and don't know
[1:12:11] it now what does he say he says I
[1:12:14] counsel thee Le oia to buy of me gold
[1:12:18] tried in the fire that thou mayest be
[1:12:20] rich and white rainment that thou mayest
[1:12:23] be clothed and that the shame of thy
[1:12:26] nakedness do not appear and what anoint
[1:12:29] thine eyes with
[1:12:32] isab praise the Lord that thou mayest
[1:12:37] see praise God anoint it with Isa so
[1:12:43] that you can see that's a proclamation
[1:12:47] to Le oia to be able to see the word God
[1:12:51] sent a prophet in this day people hate
[1:12:54] it people despise it people put it down
[1:12:57] people leave it ridicule it say he's a
[1:12:59] liar I believe it amen it's been it's
[1:13:03] been revealed God has shown it to me my
[1:13:06] eyes have been opened the veil has been
[1:13:08] lifted and God has revealed to me that
[1:13:11] truth and there's not one thing that
[1:13:13] anybody could ever try to say that would
[1:13:15] that would persuade me any different
[1:13:18] it's been revealed my eyes have been
[1:13:20] open right amen I can see Danny has a
[1:13:24] blue shirt on and there's nobody can
[1:13:26] tell me that he doesn't right you'll
[1:13:28] never convince me that he does not have
[1:13:30] a blue shirt on no matter what you say
[1:13:33] no matter what you do amen that shirt is
[1:13:37] blue Amen
[1:13:39] period
[1:13:41] amen God has shown me the truth and
[1:13:44] there's not one thing in there that you
[1:13:46] can
[1:13:48] see that God hasn't already
[1:13:52] revealed the only when I read it the
[1:13:54] only only thing I see is baptizm baptism
[1:13:58] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:14:00] that's only thing in there that's right
[1:14:03] amen amen the Lord Jesus Christ is the
[1:14:06] name of father son Holy Ghost which
[1:14:09] Jesus said yeah Jesus was so adamant
[1:14:13] about it that he gave Peter the Holy
[1:14:16] Ghost his own life living in
[1:14:18] Peter and he sent Peter out on the dead
[1:14:21] Pentecost to preach to the rest of them
[1:14:24] after after he gave him the keys to the
[1:14:28] kingdom of
[1:14:29] heaven Jesus gave Peter the keys to the
[1:14:34] kingdom of heaven and he said whatsoever
[1:14:36] you bound on Earth will be bound in
[1:14:39] heaven now Peter steps forth on the day
[1:14:42] of Pentecost watch it Peter now be
[1:14:44] careful what you say because you've got
[1:14:47] the key and whatever you by now is going
[1:14:50] to be bound in heaven and Peter stood
[1:14:52] forth without reservation and said be
[1:14:55] you baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:14:58] for the remission of your sin and you
[1:15:01] shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[1:15:03] yeah praise the Lord you tell me that
[1:15:06] was that Peter was off with that having
[1:15:09] just received the Holy Spirit having
[1:15:12] just before that give that by Jesus own
[1:15:16] Direction given the keys to the kingdom
[1:15:18] of heaven or whatever he bound here be
[1:15:20] bound in
[1:15:22] heaven then they can't be a
[1:15:24] contradiction
[1:15:26] it's a contradiction to those that are
[1:15:27] blind yes it's a contradiction to those
[1:15:31] whose eyes cannot see they're not open
[1:15:35] that's why he said I adure you to buy me
[1:15:40] isav anoint thine eyes with isav so that
[1:15:43] you can see now let's go over to uh St
[1:15:52] Luke the same thing I I I
[1:15:56] I I gave this testimony again last week
[1:16:00] I believe it was last week that I
[1:16:03] remember I heard Billy Paul say it a
[1:16:05] couple of times but one time I think the
[1:16:08] last time I heard him give it was at the
[1:16:09] Tucson
[1:16:11] Tabernacle and he said that man remember
[1:16:14] youall remember when I get into the
[1:16:15] story had that book witness to that man
[1:16:17] and give him a guy who worked with I was
[1:16:19] give him I give him a book of brother
[1:16:21] Brandon he took that book home and he
[1:16:23] read it he brought that book back he was
[1:16:25] mad at that guy it was his friend mad at
[1:16:27] M said don't ever give me anything by
[1:16:29] that man again he said why not he said
[1:16:33] that man in that book called me a
[1:16:36] buzzard and he said well that's funny
[1:16:39] same man in the same book called me an
[1:16:41] eagle amen amen same thing that opened
[1:16:47] eyes is the same thing that closes eyes
[1:16:50] yes praise the Lord St Luke Chapter uh
[1:16:55] oh what are we at
[1:16:58] 24 St Luke chapter
[1:17:01] 24 the two men from
[1:17:08] emus let let's just start with verse 13
[1:17:11] I was just going to read a couple of
[1:17:12] verses of scripture but I'll read
[1:17:13] through it because there's a point up
[1:17:15] here that I that I want to get we might
[1:17:17] drop down anyway 13 let's start uh Luke
[1:17:23] 2413 and behold two two of them went
[1:17:25] that same day to a village called emus
[1:17:28] about 6 and a half miles
[1:17:29] away which was from Jerusalem about 3
[1:17:32] sare furong which about 6 and a half
[1:17:34] miles and they talked and they talked
[1:17:37] together of all the things which had
[1:17:39] happened and it came to pass that while
[1:17:42] they communed together in reason Jesus
[1:17:45] himself Drew near and went with them but
[1:17:49] their eyes were
[1:17:51] Holden that they should not know him so
[1:17:55] they saw him he was there with them they
[1:17:57] were talking together but their eyes
[1:18:00] were Holden they were captured the word
[1:18:02] Holden means that it was take hold of or
[1:18:05] to capture or to seize to seize hold of
[1:18:08] something Their Eyes Were seized Holden
[1:18:12] that they should not know him and he
[1:18:15] said unto them or veiled if if you will
[1:18:18] Their Eyes Were veiled that they so they
[1:18:21] could not see him amen could see
[1:18:23] naturally they weren't blind naturally
[1:18:26] but they were Holden spiritually to not
[1:18:28] recognize who he was amen and he said
[1:18:31] unto them what manner of communications
[1:18:34] are these that ye have to one another as
[1:18:36] you walk and are sad and they explain
[1:18:38] all the things and he says what things
[1:18:40] now 25th verse let's drop down to the
[1:18:42] 25th verse then he said unto them oh
[1:18:45] fools and slow of heart to believe all
[1:18:48] that the prophets have
[1:18:49] spoken ought not Christ to have suffered
[1:18:52] these things and to enter into to his
[1:18:56] glory and at the beginning at Moses and
[1:19:00] all the prophets he expounded unto them
[1:19:03] in all the scripture the things
[1:19:05] concerning
[1:19:07] himself explaining to them remember this
[1:19:10] scripture it tells about this that's me
[1:19:13] that's well he didn't say that's me but
[1:19:15] explaining it that this had to happen
[1:19:18] this was a fulfillment of
[1:19:20] scripture and and he began to tell them
[1:19:23] about this scripture
[1:19:25] and that scripture and this scripture
[1:19:27] this scripture it's got to come to pass
[1:19:29] well it came to pass this scripture had
[1:19:32] to come to pass it's came to pass and he
[1:19:35] be to expound to them all through the
[1:19:37] Torah all through the scriptures the
[1:19:39] things that concerned him they didn't
[1:19:42] know who he was of course at the time
[1:19:44] but the scripture to understand as hard
[1:19:48] as it was in as much as they and and I
[1:19:52] if it been me I wouldn't have wanted to
[1:19:54] Happ either had to happen it had to
[1:19:57] happen Jesus had to go through this this
[1:20:01] had to take place for the Fulfillment of
[1:20:05] scripture and as he expounded it to them
[1:20:08] look concerning himself they drew n to
[1:20:12] the village where they went and he made
[1:20:14] uh made though he would have gone
[1:20:16] further but they constrained him saying
[1:20:18] Abe with us for it is toward evening and
[1:20:20] the day is far spent and he went in to
[1:20:23] chry with them
[1:20:25] and it came to pass as he sat at meat
[1:20:28] with them he took bread and blessed it
[1:20:31] and break it and gave them to eat and
[1:20:35] their eyes were
[1:20:37] open why at that time were their eyes
[1:20:41] open why when he was expounding the
[1:20:44] scripture to them did their their eyes
[1:20:47] not come open amen now because the the
[1:20:50] scripture brings Revelation revelation
[1:20:53] of the scripture but it's it's the word
[1:20:55] the the spirit brings the Revelation
[1:20:58] brings the life it's the spirit that
[1:21:00] hits the word that makes it live amen
[1:21:04] so so why was this specific time the
[1:21:07] time that their eyes came open I
[1:21:09] remember brother green used to talk
[1:21:10] about how he how he would they would sit
[1:21:13] with him and he would take the bread and
[1:21:15] break it in front of them and they
[1:21:17] recognized how he did
[1:21:20] it was similar or was something that
[1:21:24] brought back to their remembrance well
[1:21:25] that's the way Jesus used to break it
[1:21:28] however tear it or pull it or however he
[1:21:30] broke I
[1:21:32] know that brother green would talk about
[1:21:34] that and that makes that that makes
[1:21:36] sense I kind of think uh it falls along
[1:21:39] the lines of breaking of bread when you
[1:21:41] break when the bread is broken it brings
[1:21:44] Revelation amen when it's open when it's
[1:21:47] manifested when it's made known when the
[1:21:50] bread is broken when it's made known and
[1:21:51] when it's revealed it becomes known to
[1:21:54] you then it's no longer hidden right
[1:21:57] then they could recognize who he was
[1:21:59] their eyes were open and they knew him
[1:22:01] and he vanished out of their sight he
[1:22:04] recogniz they recognized him after the
[1:22:08] breaking of bread after the opening of
[1:22:11] the word after the word was expounded to
[1:22:14] them he broke the bread and they and
[1:22:18] they and the Revelation came the the the
[1:22:21] veil was
[1:22:22] lifted when the veil was was lifted they
[1:22:25] could see who he was amen their eyes
[1:22:28] came open their spiritual eyes where
[1:22:30] they could recognize that's Jesus right
[1:22:33] amen this is him he vanished out of
[1:22:35] their sight but not before they
[1:22:37] recognized and realized this is him he
[1:22:41] was with us he walked with us he talked
[1:22:43] with us and they spoke to one another
[1:22:46] and said did not our hearts burn within
[1:22:48] us while he talked to us and while he
[1:22:51] opened to us the scripture amen
[1:22:54] praise the Lord did not our hearts burn
[1:22:58] and that that's the way it should always
[1:23:00] be yes when Jesus is speaking to us it
[1:23:03] should always be that God is the
[1:23:06] Revelation that word is burning in our
[1:23:08] hearts as God reveals it to it as God
[1:23:11] shows us that Veil is lifted it's
[1:23:13] manifested and shown it's revealed the
[1:23:17] word he T that that because they
[1:23:19] specifically
[1:23:21] said when he opened to us the script
[1:23:24] scures amen when he opened to us now
[1:23:29] look it does not say as far as I know
[1:23:33] they did not have a Bible in their hands
[1:23:36] they weren't following along like we are
[1:23:38] here in church right they were just
[1:23:42] talking they were communing they were
[1:23:44] fellowshipping right Jesus is just
[1:23:46] starting to O open the scripture to
[1:23:49] them as he was walking along with them
[1:23:53] of the things that's in in the scripture
[1:23:55] do you not realize that so and so and
[1:23:57] such and such this is what it says and
[1:23:59] this is what it was supposed to do this
[1:24:01] day this scriptures
[1:24:03] fulfilled amen he didn't take a physical
[1:24:08] Bible and open it but as he preached and
[1:24:12] ministered the word it became re it
[1:24:14] became Revelation to them the opening
[1:24:18] wasn't a physical Bible the opening was
[1:24:21] the spirit revealing to them yes opening
[1:24:25] to them what the scripture and the
[1:24:27] revelation of that could you imagine and
[1:24:31] if they were sitting there and the
[1:24:34] horror of what they had just gone
[1:24:35] through and Jesus just being crucified
[1:24:38] in the manner he was crucified I you
[1:24:41] can't even imagine the kind of condition
[1:24:43] that human mind was in they probably
[1:24:45] didn't even realize or think about the
[1:24:48] scripture that said it had to be that
[1:24:50] way right and it was going to be that
[1:24:52] way right and but as you look at it you
[1:24:55] say well that had to be that way that
[1:24:58] that was a fulfillment of that now
[1:25:00] people can't realize that people today I
[1:25:04] you go and even ask to say you think
[1:25:06] it's the end time oh absolutely well you
[1:25:08] know at the end time God's supposed to
[1:25:10] send a prophet right really yeah you
[1:25:14] read Malachi 4 oh yeah Elijah is
[1:25:17] supposed to come well where is he if
[1:25:19] this is the end where is
[1:25:22] he people have no answer yeah because
[1:25:25] they don't know right their eyes are
[1:25:27] blinded to it but if God opened their
[1:25:30] eyes you could recognize and see that's
[1:25:32] how one of the families in Florida came
[1:25:34] started coming to our
[1:25:35] church they were moving down to Florida
[1:25:38] cuz her dad lived down there in St
[1:25:40] Augustine and a guy that came to our
[1:25:42] church worked for her dad and when they
[1:25:45] came uh and and moved to St Augustine he
[1:25:49] got to talking to them well while they
[1:25:51] were moving from I believe it was
[1:25:53] Michigan down to Florida um they started
[1:25:58] she they went to church up there they
[1:26:00] started talking her and her husband and
[1:26:03] and saying and reading in the Bible
[1:26:05] because their Minister had just been
[1:26:07] reading Malachi
[1:26:08] 4 and she looked said well where is that
[1:26:12] Elijah if we're at this end where is
[1:26:14] that Elijah right you see they didn't
[1:26:16] have an answer because the pastor didn't
[1:26:19] have an answer they didn't know but when
[1:26:21] they got to St Augustine they man a man
[1:26:24] met a man that knew right and that was
[1:26:26] the man that went to our church that was
[1:26:28] working for her dad and when they got
[1:26:31] together he began to tell when when they
[1:26:34] started talking about the story he began
[1:26:37] to tell her said I can tell you where
[1:26:38] that Elijah is amen and they started
[1:26:42] coming to church they're still message
[1:26:43] Believers today they moved back to
[1:26:45] Michigan but that I've contacted I've
[1:26:47] talked to uh a little bit since uh we
[1:26:51] left there and still still message
[1:26:53] believers good going to church praise
[1:26:55] the Lord because it just took someone
[1:26:59] that that scripture came and said this
[1:27:01] is the Fulfillment of that right and it
[1:27:04] opened their eyes to see yes that's a
[1:27:06] fulfillment of that now the religious of
[1:27:09] that day will look at it and crucify him
[1:27:12] and say he needed to be crucified they
[1:27:14] don't even come can't even fathom that
[1:27:18] this scripture that they knew so well
[1:27:20] right these religious leaders knew the
[1:27:22] scripture the Torah so well
[1:27:24] brother R said they could take a pen and
[1:27:27] stick it through the scroll which is
[1:27:28] round hold up stick a pen through it
[1:27:31] tell you where it HD and what it said
[1:27:33] amen they knew it that well right but
[1:27:37] when Jesus the Fulfillment of that
[1:27:39] scripture showed up in front of them
[1:27:41] their eyes they couldn't see
[1:27:44] Amen Let let's let's go over uh
[1:27:48] Romans I'm just doing this as it comes
[1:27:51] now so I'm skipping other stuff but
[1:27:53] Romans chap 11 vers
[1:27:55] 5 Romans 11:5 says even so then at this
[1:27:59] present time also there is a Remnant
[1:28:02] according to the election of Grace thank
[1:28:05] God for that and if by Grace then it is
[1:28:07] no more of wors otherwise Grace is no
[1:28:10] more Grace but if it be of works then
[1:28:13] there is no more uh Grace otherwise work
[1:28:15] is no more work what then Israel hath
[1:28:19] not obtained that which he seeketh for
[1:28:22] but the election
[1:28:24] hath obtained it and the rest were
[1:28:26] blinded the election praise God God had
[1:28:30] to take the Wild Olive Tree grafted into
[1:28:34] the to the uh uh the the uh uh the old
[1:28:38] Olive Tree the Wild Olive Tree had to be
[1:28:41] grafted in so that the Gentiles would
[1:28:43] have a chance to receive the message to
[1:28:46] receive the truth amen for their eyes to
[1:28:49] be open for the scales to fall off and
[1:28:52] for that to happen
[1:28:54] the rest were blinded blinded to what to
[1:28:58] who he was amen they were as blind to
[1:29:03] who he was as the syrians were to who
[1:29:07] Elisha was they were just as blinded to
[1:29:10] it who did it they were just as blinded
[1:29:14] to re realizing who he was as the two
[1:29:17] going to amus did not recognize
[1:29:20] Jesus finally they did
[1:29:24] the two men in EMAs finally recognized
[1:29:26] who he was their eyes came open oh
[1:29:28] friend look there be a day when their
[1:29:31] eyes come open yes they were blinded
[1:29:33] here not to know him but their eyes will
[1:29:35] come open and when they do they'll
[1:29:38] recognize that they crucified the very
[1:29:40] Messiah yes my praise God but for now
[1:29:44] still now they're still blinded to it
[1:29:47] they can't they they couldn't see it

[1:29:59] Horse with golden armor and and take and
[1:30:03] slew the enemy with with with a sword or
[1:30:07] something I mean what what was their
[1:30:09] Invision I mean Isaiah said a virgin
[1:30:12] shall conceive and bring forth the Son
[1:30:15] of
[1:30:16] God but when it happened when it
[1:30:18] fulfilled they couldn't see
[1:30:21] it amen they didn't recognize that was
[1:30:24] him he was the Fulfillment of that
[1:30:26] scripture Their Eyes Were blinded they
[1:30:29] had to be blinded so I could see so I
[1:30:32] could know so that it would go from the
[1:30:36] prophecy praise the Lord of Abraham CL
[1:30:40] Crossing his arms that at the cross the
[1:30:43] blessing would go from the older to the
[1:30:45] younger Hallelujah from Israel to the
[1:30:49] tame olive tree to the Gentile the Wild
[1:30:51] Olive
[1:30:52] Tree at the
[1:30:54] cross at the cross where I first saw the
[1:30:57] light yes the burden of my soul was
[1:31:01] lifted rolled away my eyes came open and
[1:31:04] I could see God removed the scale God
[1:31:08] removed the veil that we could see now

[1:31:14] are still captive yeah amen captive to
[1:31:17] what they were looking that they must

[1:34:03] themselves from what was standing right
[1:34:05] in front of them amen I remember brother

[1:34:46] opportunity amen oh God help us not miss
[1:34:50] that opportunity amen
[1:34:53] that flesh will will will create a a
[1:34:57] veil a problem the flesh is the veil
[1:35:00] I'll read a quote here but
[1:35:03] faith faith will help get you past that
[1:35:06] Veil amen we're coming up on the time
[1:35:09] that most of us the the world or
[1:35:11] whatever they celebrate
[1:35:13] Christmas probably a lot of kids growing
[1:35:15] up today don't even know what Christmas
[1:35:17] is probably don't certainly don't even
[1:35:19] know when Jesus was actually born but
[1:35:22] celebrating it December 25th that time
[1:35:27] but Jesus birth blinded so many people
[1:35:30] they couldn't see it amen how could the
[1:35:34] creator of Heaven and
[1:35:36] Earth lay on a manure pile after his
[1:35:41] birth my because he became humble like
[1:35:46] one of us he became human condenscending
[1:35:49] down into human flesh and that flesh
[1:35:52] veiled him from what for they could see
[1:35:54] that's why you know brother ramam said
[1:35:56] if this veil of Flesh would fall off
[1:35:58] you'd see God standing in front of you
[1:36:00] yeah not CA he's God because if the same
[1:36:02] thing happened to you I'd see God there
[1:36:04] yes amen it's the veil that keeps us
[1:36:07] from seeing him in that capacity it's
[1:36:10] the veil it's the veil of Flesh God
[1:36:12] takes that Veil off amen and it takes
[1:36:14] Faith to believe it takes Faith to see
[1:36:18] you the way God sees you amen
[1:36:24] I we see each other in our natural
[1:36:29] habitat as human
[1:36:31] beings but it takes Faith to look Beyond
[1:36:36] as God did for Gesa to look Beyond to
[1:36:39] see you the way God sees you yes Amen to
[1:36:43] see everyone the way God sees them God
[1:36:46] open my eyes praise the Lord that I may
[1:36:49] see Lord open my eyes I want to see yes
[1:36:53] it takes Faith to believe now look I
[1:36:56] read this I'm going
[1:36:57] close in he in the Hebrew series 1957 he
[1:37:02] said the veil is the flesh the veil is
[1:37:06] what keeps us from seeing God face to
[1:37:08] face in this church the veil is what
[1:37:11] keeps us from seeing the Angels at their
[1:37:13] positions this morning standing by the
[1:37:17] seats the veil is what keeps us from
[1:37:20] seeing him we're we're hid behind the
[1:37:22] veil and that Veil is the flesh we are
[1:37:26] Sons and Daughters of God we're in the
[1:37:27] presence of God the angels of God are
[1:37:30] encamped around about those who fear Him
[1:37:32] we're in the presence of God all the
[1:37:34] time I never lead thee I'll never lead
[1:37:36] thee nor forsake Thee I will be with
[1:37:39] thee always even unto the end but the
[1:37:41] veil is the flesh remember that is a
[1:37:43] veil but it's The Veil The Veil he's
[1:37:46] talking about now the veil of Flesh
[1:37:48] that's what keeps us out of the pre out
[1:37:50] of his presence but through the soul the
[1:37:53] fear our faith faith we know that he's
[1:37:56] watching us he's standing by us here
[1:37:58] right now he's going back to the story
[1:38:02] of of Elisha and gahaz he said down at
[1:38:04] Dothan one morning an old Prophet
[1:38:07] surrounded by an army of servants went I
[1:38:09] said oh Father the whole country
[1:38:11] surrounded by aliens and Elijah raised
[1:38:14] up and said why son there's more with us
[1:38:16] than there are with them he batted his
[1:38:18] eyes looked around he could see nothing
[1:38:20] he said God I would that you'd open his
[1:38:22] eyes take away the veil and when the
[1:38:26] veil dropped from over his eyes around
[1:38:29] the old Prophet was Chariots of Fire the
[1:38:32] mountains on fire the angels of God and
[1:38:35] the angels and chariots there you are
[1:38:38] Gaz could see amen he could say I see
[1:38:43] now praise the Lord the veil had dropped
[1:38:47] amen he said now brother B said now
[1:38:49] there's where the hindrance is so many
[1:38:52] times the hindrance is with the flesh
[1:38:56] yes with our
[1:38:58] flesh together our flesh me myself flesh
[1:39:03] again don't fixate on the
[1:39:06] wrong amen and trust me friend we all
[1:39:10] know this this is the
[1:39:12] wrong so don't get fixated on this yes
[1:39:16] nasty flesh yes amen don't get don't
