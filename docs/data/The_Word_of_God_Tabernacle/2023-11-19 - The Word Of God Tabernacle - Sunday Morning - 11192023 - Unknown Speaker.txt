giving him praise and worship amen we're here to thank him for all that he does for us you know it should be something every day brother Bram talked about a mother's day you know and how people would take that Mother's Day and make it a specific day to make mother know how much she's loved and make her know how much she's appreciated and make her know with flowers or candy or whatever to let her know how much she's loved and appreciated he said but every day should be a Mother's Day amen and if every day should be a Mother's Day just in that context how much more should every day be a day of Thanksgiving that we give to our Lord Jesus amen we come in on Sundays we spend this time this special moment to worship him to praise Him amen expect him to meet with with us but every day should be a Thanksgiving to the Lord we got this one day of the year that we concentrate all our Thanksgiving Lord we're so thankful amen I don't know how much like brother Danny said how much the rest of the world really even understands it just it's just become so much of a formality it's become so much of a commercialization amen Thanksgiving is skipped over people go all Halloween and go all out and then Christmas comes and they go all out they go from one polar into the other amen praise the Lord but there's right there in the middle that you can never forget amen that our Founding Father set for this nation time of worship and a time of Thanksgiving that we give to the Lord Jesus amen are you thankful today praise the Lord very thankful I want you to know too that when I was looking up songs week before last these are the songs that the Lord put together for me for today and it didn't even realize it was the Sunday before Thanksgiving oh that is the truth did not even realize it till yesterday thank you Lord and I thought wow tomorrow is Thanksgiving maybe uh maybe Lord will give me something about Thanksgiving uh for service today and I get here this morning and I look at the songs I'm like my those are all the songs I would probably sing for Thanksgiving to the Lord amen and God already put him there praise the Lord he's mindful amen and I'm so thankful just to know that we are we are his bought with a price he leads us and guides us amen praise the lord we want to go to the Lord in prayer now we've noticed there's quite a few people missing today amen we miss when anybody's not we miss so very much amen but brother Dennis is out as we all know we text to let you all know that brother Dennis was having problems with his left knee bothered him really bad um uh Joel could oh you've got him already see he's already a step up head me yeah amen so efficient thank you buddy um and he went to the doctor uh and found out that the that he had shingles the shingles were really flaring up his knee maybe more so he been having a lot of problems with his right knee because his right knee has not been doesn't have knee replacement just kind of bone on bone so his right knee's been balling he talked about maybe doing a transplant of his right knee this next year uh but then his left knee started flaring up which was unusual but found out again he had shingles uh and for all I've heard about shingles and anybody that's had them and my dad had them back when I was a kid uh only thing I remember about them is they're extremely painful that's the one thing I remember about them uh of course it matters and sometimes it's different depending on where on the body they manifest themselves but uh the one thing I hear is they're extremely painful uh sometimes they last even for months but we're going to believe for perfect healing for brother Dennis the Lord will touch him also sister Norman's not been feeling well this week uh she's feeling better but she thought she'd stay home get some more rest make sure that she she's feeling a lot better sister Lydia had been around some people that she uh had found out they had covid so sister Lydia is fine but just precaution sister Lydia stayed home uh to make sure that if something happened or if she happened to be around that person something so uh just remember Sister lyia in prayer of course my wife's not here um she woke up well she was coughing and hacking all night or a lot of the night having trouble sleeping uh and she woke up this morning and she sounded pretty rough but then she text me later and said that she uh when she got up she was very dizzy and you probably all know my wife has gets cases of vertigo and when that dizzy spell hits her there's nothing we had found that she can do but go lay down and go to bed try to sleep at all uh so she stayed home today uh so I trust and pray that you just remember her in prayer as well brother Danny has a prayer request here it says uh we were notified that we have new owners again at my apartment complex does that mean someone bought the apartment complex again yes okay so somebody new owns the complex yeah just okay recently okay they they even sent out a notice that numer numerous improvements including a high grade uh with a key including a high excuse me High Gate uh with a key to come and go which is safety is there's a big concern uh I got a certified letter stating that my rent will be increased by $295 starting January 1 I got till 121 which is just a couple of weeks away to make a decision to Stay or Leave praying that I will make the right decision amen just pray the Lord touch you help you brother Danny make the right decision do the right thing that's that's quite a jump $295 especially especially for that place I was getting ready to say especially for that area no offense but uh it's it's not the Primo area of town to live in for that kind of rent to go up like that so we just remember that for brother Danny prayer the Lord would just have intervene in that situation uh got a prayer here prayer request prayer for Pat's neighbor uh Paul so weak he can't stand he's your next door Paul's his next door neighbor uh we've talked about Paul here uh fell and had to be picked up by Pat uh give them both strength amen so just pray that the Lord would just help Paul he's uh he's been a good friend of Pat Uh he's been good to us as we said before he even came over and helped helped us all of us tried I think to take off Zach's drain plug off their car couldn't do it he comes over and he's under what five minutes or less and gets it off like how did you do that but he but never wants anything pray a bearing for me and all he's just he's just a good guy he came to lunch di or two at Coopers and um uh just pray the Lord would just move on him we're all we're all growing older so uh I remember one time when brother Brandon was praying for U uh older couple uh they were in their 90s back at that time oh D their name just left me and brother random had a prayer request for him and he's like you know we he like 95 we only we can only really ask so much at 95 years old uh but our bodies do start breaking down uh but God's still the Healer so amen let's just remember Paul in prayer if we could um amen praise the Lord thankful for that God is so good isn't he amen we miss those that aren't here then but just trust in the Lord just move on them and touch and help them I know Sister Norma had a a special prayer request uh that she wanted to make mention as a secret request uh had been on my heart too uh that we know about the situation so amen anybody else you have an unspoken request I'm sure we all have things on our hearts we just desire the Lord to do for us let's stand to our feet if we could amen just trust in the Lord have his way and move on each of these situations bless them according to his riches and glory amen praise the lorda would let's go our heads gracious Heavenly Father Lord God Jesus stand to our feet and bow our head in reverence Lord Jesus towards the earth and the dust from which we came Lord Jesus knowing that without you that's all we are we're just us God but Lord we thank you for making us more than that and for being in our lives and for leading us and guiding us each and every day father Yes Lord thank you Jes we have several people out Lord Jesus some for precautions and some that are not feeling well Lord God but we know that you are the Healer you are the doctor of doctors you're the doctor that taught our doct here Lord Jes that everything is in your hands Lord Jesus and we commit each and everyone into your hands knowing that you will touch them that your will will be done in their lives Lord Jes gr God thank you for your presence in this service thus far Lord God and those whose hands were raised when we ask that in the unspoken Lord God you know each and every one of our hearts in thank you Lord we lay everything at your feet Lord Jesus and ask that you would move in each and every one of our lives may be with us the remaining part of the service Lord God that nothing would be hindering to your spirit and that we can receive what you have for us we commit ourselves and this service into your hands Jesus Christ we ask amen amen amen you can be seated if you'd like brother Bild down I remembered it while you were praying too that Bild y I remembered his name too amen uh I always just ask uh yesterday uh actually Friday probably I um um I don't know what happened I always wear my knee brace now but U my knees swoll up again it it was yesterday it was it was like a basketball softball probably not a basketball it's swollen up and and it's it's swollen up pretty good right now put some ice on I got home yesterday and ice and heat to try to help the swelling uh but I can stand here so thankful to the Lord for that always forget to ask for prayer but it wasn't a rough week had a good week the Lord blessed and uh thankful for that it just I don't know what causes it to flare up like that sometimes uh but I'm just trusting the Lord's perfect healing amen and appreciate all your prayers and um just pray that the Lord would just have his way I um spent spent last week is you know I've had a cough and I told you last time last week I'd quit taking the the allergy medicine to try to help loosen all that stuff up so just get rid of that cough and stuff just started coming up I don't I'm not going to be very graphic other than that but uh it was it was U it was pretty graphic it was a lot so this past week at the hotel um there was Monday Tuesday Wednesday even into Thursday I couldn't even hardly talk um my voice was just just from all that and my throat and stuff so uh I'm so if I struggle a little bit trying to get my voice back to singing uh forgive me uh I definitely not a singer to start with so I appreciate all your support and your raising your voices to sing as well it helps a lot so uh but again if my voice kind of is a little squeaky today uh there's a reason for that so and my apologies amen Micah or Micah Joel's got a praise report here that he wants to give to you he wrote it out himself praise report the Lord Joel says I have been uh worrying less and feeling much more happy praise the Lord so thank God for that amen praise the Lord he's good to us isn't he amen I appreciate Joel just loves the Lord Jesus with all of his heart it means so much to his Gramps and and Emma does too I don't want to leave her out but uh they just my grandchildren just love the Lord so much and appreciate Godly Parents that would raise him in the nurture and admonition of God yes amen amen praise the Lord praise the Lord one more song before we change over the service now amen song number 204 amen song number 204 for it'll be on the screen here like trying to find it I probably know the words this been a while since we've sang it amen Hey

God is mindful of us amen praise the Lord Jesus amen can we stand to our feet now we'll just go ahead and change the service praise the Lord amen what a wonderful God what a mighty God thank you Jesus amen I've said this before and I'm a little eer about saying it but I'm going to say it anyway I wasn't anticipating this to be a very long service today so we'll see again though a lot of times my expectations are not the same as his so we just try to to do what he leads us to do whatever that might be amen let's turn over to Psalms chapter 100 amen I know we talked last week about um finishing up that last part that we had on that God in Simplicity and false teachers that the last part of the third part of that uh but um just felt to do something about Thanksgiving today at uh not that it's makes that difference every day of Thanksgiving but when we have this special time to be with family friends give thanks to the Lord um hopefully maybe a Grateful Nation amen because it's something that we that we have here in the United States a thankfulness uh you go over in Australia there's not a Thanksgiving that I know of not like we have England of course they don't have one our uh a lot of our thankfulness is that we were able to come here for Religious Freedom and worship the God how we wanted to without the oppression of the Catholic church in England amen amen so here we have it and it's important to us it means a lot that we're very thankful for the Lord Jesus all he does for us let's bow our heads before we read the word today now Lord Jesus father we are so very again thankful of your grace your mercy your love the blessings you give us Lord we are nothing without you and we recognize and realize that Lord without your hand upon us without you leading guiding us without you showing us and strengthening us and giving us all the unmar favor and Grace God that we could even hope or think father so many times Lord as you open up the windows of heaven and pour out blessings that that we can't even contain God it's just just so good to know that you are the one there the one that owns the cattle on Thousand Hills that is our supplier that is our Giver that is our healer Lord that is our strength you are shield and buckler you are strong mighty tower you're our L of the valley Bright Morning Star you are that and so much more alpha omega beginning ending Lord you are our God you are our Lord and we love you and praise you thank you Lord we are so very thankful even though every day that we have as a Thanksgiving to you father we do spay we do still pay special close attention to know that this season that we're living here now and the acknowledgment of this nation coming up to this time of a real Thanksgiving father that the foundation of that Thanksgiving is rooted solely in you so many other things that we have come from Pagan Traditions or different things Lord and God they are what they are we celebrate them as such Lord and as we do for you God and but Lord this is that time Lord that we know that the foundation of this rooted in the Thanksgiving of our forefathers to give praise to you those pilgrims that came across and we're so thankful for a new found land for a new found uh a place to worship Lord out from under the oppression and of man or man's boot or some kind of denomination or religious spirit Lord to worship you as we have as we see fit father to worship you God here in this place that's what we have done and intend to continue to do Lord to glorify and magnify Your Name Lord I pray God that as we rebuke every demonic spirit that would try to hurt hinder and filtrate this service in any way that you get the glory honor and praise for all that is said and done here in this place today blessed be with those who weren't able to make it for whatever reason Lord may your hand be upon them and bless and strengthen them in a special way Lord accomplish now God the purpose that you have this and establish this service to be so today let it be according to your perfect will father and we'll give you all the thanks and the praise for the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen Psalms chapter 100 I want to read the entire chapter just five verses Make a Joyful Noise unto the Lord All Ye Lands serve the Lord with gladness come before his presence with seeing know ye that the Lord he is God it is he that hath made us and not we ourselves we are his people and the Sheep of his pasture enter into his gates with Thanksgiving and into his courts with praise be thank thankful unto him and bless his name for the Lord is good his Mercy is Everlasting and his truth endureth to all generations and you can be seated if You' like that's amen as actually that was my mom's favorite Psalm my mom always likes Psalms 101 she like the whole chapter but Psalms 101 as many of you probably know my family knows how much my mom loved to sing yes but she sang about as well as brother brandom and about as well as I do which isn't saying a whole lot but she loved to sing so she love this verse that said Make a Joyful Noise amen now a lot of people go around and say well the the Bible says the noise is supposed to be joyful but friend if it's coming from your heart is worship to the Lord is joyful it doesn't matter how melodious it is but it does matter how joyful it is when it comes from a Heart of Worship amen when it comes from a Heart of Worship it's joyful and it's joyful to the Lord praise the Lord so uh she was not afraid to get in front of anybody at any church at any time and singing what the lord gave her she wasn't ashamed to make a tape she had a cassette tape put out amen that brother Dwight Hall made for her and and and my mom knew and she actually asked brother Dwight who has obviously he very talented good musician and singer and she asked him when he went to do to go to that tape she said brother would you please just would you sing all these songs for these are the song She Wrote all the songs on her cassette if you ever heard her cassette they probably still have some at the Tabernacle um they weren't in great demand most people like uh uh like Great Performances and all when they listen but um you know a lot of people don't want to listen to like someone like my mom or brother brandom so there's probably a lot of them still left I I had a bunch left after she passed I I'm not sure where they are but had several but anyway if you've listen to it excuse me every song on that tape my mother wrote she wrote she wrote over a hundred songs she only put six or eight on the cassette but she went and asked brother Hall she said would you sing these songs on this tape for me she was she really didn't want to put out the songs with her singing them and brother twice said oh absolutely not he said I won't even do it if you don't sing them and she said okay it's every song on there my mother sang amen and it is what it is but God gave her that Talent amen that desire praise the Lord and I inherited that desire I love to sing I Love to Worship the Lord uh can't carry it tune in a 10 bucket but I love to sing so pardon me if it bothers you uh if there's something that you run away I it doesn't matter I love to sing I I i' i' prefer have a song leader for here but I love to sing I've always loved to sing I like music of course my children kind of got that too they love music um can sing Mike and T the sing I don't know how they got to sing but they're very good singers me and tabias or and Sonia is not very good but but love to sing amen and Make a Joyful Noise to give Thanksgiving to the Lord and that is the whole point of it amen a lot of times we we probably don't sing as uh as much as we should in church as we you know maybe we don't feel comfortable or something but it doesn't matter that's not the point the point is to make a Joyful Noise to the Lord and if it's something of worship from your heart is joyful the Lord receives his it as joyful amen and if he receives it as joyful then what else do you want what else do we expect if we're singing to try to get somebody's attention well that's a different deal if you're singing to try to get a record deal from some record company or some that's a whole different deal but if you're singing To Worship the Lord if you're singing to make a Joyful Noise if you're singing Because You Love the Lord and you want to worship him and you want to worship Him according to the scripture and you want to lift your voice and worship to God and give Thanksgiving to the Lord there you go amen then who else what else is there for anyone to say but that that we enter into his courts with Thanksgiving amen into his house with praise that's why we start our services out with lifting our voices to the Lord to worship and to praise him there's a particular point of this that I want to get to though in this service today let's go over to Leviticus I want to read a verse of scripture out of Leviticus chapter 22 because as you all know we sang the song we give the sacrifice amen we give this sacrifice of praise um and and I will let you know if I move around a little bit more just understand it it starts hurting my knee if I just stand in one place too long so it helps me if I move a little bit more I kind of move anyway but maybe more so than I normally do so uh if it if it bothers you I'm sorry but um Leviticus 22 verse 29 amen Leviticus 22:29 listen to this now because we we sang the song we give the sacrifice of praise the praise that we give we give as a sacrifice unto the Lord uh I remember a brother I've mentioned this before brother dentist knows very well uh that mentioned about uh we don't we don't U uh we don't hold the Old Testament uh like we do the New Testament I said brother it's all the word of God am you can't get rid of any of it Genesis 1 to revelation 22 it's all the inspired word of God he said well we don't sacrifice animals anymore said yes but we offer up spiritual sacrifices to the Lord giving him thanks With Praise of our lips amen amen that's the sacrifice we give so to look at the comparison that we have that we give thanks giving we just read as David said Thanksgiving praise to the Lord we give Thanksgiving to the Lord it it I believe it should be in the same context The Same Spirit as God had explained to them as they were giving literal sacrifices literal animal sacrifices I believe is the lord gave them instruction for those literal animal sacrifices that that instruction goes for us today and our spiritual Worship in our spiritual sacrifice so I'm going to look at a couple of places and recognize one particular thing about our worship that should be in our hearts all the time now look Leviticus 22:29 and when ye will offer look now when ye will offer a sacrifice of Thanksgiving to the Lord offer it at your own will amen when you're going to off offer an offering unto the Lord offer it at your own will right now we we talked about this before in different aspects uh such as giving monetarily giving physically giving of your time uh tithe offering that kind of thing God always likes a cheerful Giver the scripture says God wants someone who gives of their heart amen they don't give because they want a tax deduction they don't give because they have nothing nothing better to do they don't give because they're forced to give or they become some sort of indentured servant they give because it's of their heart to give they don't give of their abundance they give of their substance right someone says I don't have time to do something that's the best time to do it yeah someone says I don't have the money to give that's the best time to give yeah amen Lord someone says I don't have the the the strength to get that's the best time to give I could have easily called service off today because of my voice because of my knee but I want to give everything I've got to the Lord if I fall down flat on this floor I know there's somebody here that'll pick me up right amen but if I'm going to do it it's going to be done at in praise and thanksgiving to the Lord Jesus amen amen and that's I believe what the Lord wants of all of us that it be given again the example that we have of our spiritual sacrifice mirroring the physical sacrifice that they gave one of the great instructions to give it at your own will right you give it freely from your heart yes you give it because you want to give it you give it of the desire to give it when you're forced to do something there's no blessing in that amen I've heard that people talk about how horrible is that and exchanging gifts and Christmas and it's a it's an act of rest rest of prosity I I I don't I don't see it that way you know because people should give not expecting to receive back right and and and and when you give you shouldn't expect somebody to give back amen now and and there shouldn't be an obligation on the other end to feel obligated to give back amen I so many times that it's happened and I've had ministers come here in Florida and the mountains and and and go to give the love offering for the ministering and for the work to the Lord and like oh no brother it's okay U you know the Lord's bless me and um I don't mean to call his name out but when brother when brother uh Dan Evans was here and preached for us I like to never got him to take a love offering yeah we took up a little love offering because I always give my tithe in than that uh but which you know makes it a lot more substantial that we as a congregation are able to give maybe to a visiting minister but he looked at it he's like I I can't take that I said brother I said don't you dare deprive me or this church of the blessing God has for us of giving this gift to you because you gave to the Lord amen you gave to the Lord by your time and presence and ministering let us give to the Lord by giving to you yes amen and that's that's what a Minister's tithing is supposed to be anyway is to give to the ministry amen but but I almost uh he he did take it I mean uh he bigger than I am but we would have had a contest if he hadn't took it cuz um that's just you know I've had other people say now don't don't don't deprive me of the blessing of giving amen because I'm giving it to you of my heart I'm giving it to you of my free will I'm giving it to you a as worship it's a worship you understand a giving is a worship we're thankful for things but we give as a result it's because that we're we're thankful we're we're worshiping we're worshiping God when we give when we give of ourselves when we give of our time everything we as we give it's worship we're worshiping the Lord amen of Thanksgiving but it's to be given of our own free will it's not to be given because you feel obligated or because you feel trapped or you feel forced to uh you you know you know me and 90% of the song Services we've had in the past almost eight years of the existence of this church I've been the song leader and you know me how many times and some of you have been here since the very first service how many times have I ever told you to raise your hands right or to clap or to or or to do something in worship how many how many times have I asked you I don't remember any may have amen usually if a song says let us lift up our holy hands I'm not asking you do it of your own free will right now I'm getting ready to read a scripture that may sound contrary to that but my belief is that we are to give it freely if you feel to raise your hand and worship you raise your hand right if you don't feel a spirit moving on you to raise your hand don't raise it yeah amen if you feel to lift your voice and worship and praise and sing as you go right ahead and do it if you don't and the spirit's not moved you don't do it amen if the spirit's moved on you to stand and speak in tongues and that's God doing it you better do it right if God moves on you and tells you to run around this church six times you better do iten although I would rather do it five or seven not six but anyway you better do it yeah don't worry about us if God's moving on you now you better make sure it's God but if God's moving on you to do it do it if he does it then just sit right there amen but you do it because God's giving you to do it not because I'm telling you to do it I hear so many times worship services and it's okay I'm not criticizing it I'm just telling you my way I'm not criticizing anybody but so many times I hear people say Okay clap to the Lord okay raise your hand okay okay standy okay do do this and and it's just it almost feels like I'm at a football game and the cheerleaders are saying go team go with I just only thing I'm missing is pom poms if if I want to worship I'm going to worship if I'm going to raise my f the spirit move I'm going to raise my hand I'm going to sing I'm going to praise but I do it of my own free will I do it because I love the Lord and because I want to worship Him amen I want to give everything I have in worship to the Lord amen that's why I like that part of that song so much just forget about yourself we get so distracted with everything else going on in life you know what friend yesterday is gone tomorrow may not ever be here but we have right now we try to make the best of what we can for what God's given us right now thankful for what God God has given us right now amen praise the Lord and we do it of our own free will let's continue let's go over to 2 Chronicles 2 Chronicles chapter 29 God wants our Thanksgiving our confession our praise our worship our testimonies to be of our own free will amen these are these feasts and these these parties were all a part of worship for them in the Old Testament they didn't well until it became uh a sneak in God's nostrils it became a tradition they didn't do it because they had to do it they did it because he wanted to do it it became a feast it became a party it became a worship of them when they did when they sacrificed an animal or or something the Lord had commanded them to do they did it as a worship to the Lord amen they didn't come because it was 10:30 on Sunday morning they did it because it was in their heart to do it and that's what God loves that's why God wants you come any other way that's the problem a lot of people have they come and they do something not they do it out of obligation or they they do it out of someone else's expectation and they get absolutely nothing and they come and they blame God for for not getting anything when it's not God's fault God has a way that you are to approach him by and if we don't approach him by the scriptural prescription that we are supposed to approach him by then is there's no acknowledgement there amen don't feel forced obligated you come because you want to not because it's Sunday at 10:30 or or or and see that's the way it got with them when it when we got over into Isaiah God told him God told Isaiah Isaiah told the people you've done this year after year all the time and now it's nothing to you but a tradition you go to okay it's time to getet the animal let's get the animals go down let's get this over with slit his throat get this done and over okay it's fine we're done we've done our Penance for the day that's no more than the Catholic church right well let's wake up at six o'clock in the morning so we can go do our pentes and so we can make sure and have the rest of the day for ourselves amen see friend it has to be more you have to approach God and and God told Isaiah that sacrifice now look God they were doing exactly what God told them to do they were doing exactly what God told him to do and in doing exactly what God told him to do mechanically it became a stink in God's nostrils you could look and say what have I done wrong Lord this is exactly what you told me to do but how we do it and why we do it is just as important as the mechanical actual doing it amen we say well I'm here in church Lord now hit me well that's not the right attitude you come to church because you're expecting to receive of the Lord but you're also expecting to give of yourself yeah you're also expecting that you're going to give everything you've got to this service to worship of the Lord that's what they were supposed to do when it became a stink in God's nostrils it was when it became a formality when it became a ritual and God told him you don't even care anymore but yet they were doing exactly what God told them to do you understand it's not simply the mechanic of doing something it's how why we do it the heart the approach the approach of worship amen when we lift our hands and worship to God that's it to us listen to me now to us it's our body but when we raise our hand to the Lord that's not a physical display of strength it's a Define yes of the light that's in US of gravity but our hand goes up because our heart says worship it's not a physical show of strength right it's a spiritual show of worship to the Lord that we worship God Amen praise the Lord you do it of your own free will yeah 2 Chronicles let's let's uh chapter 29 amen 30 verse 30 moreover Hezekiah the king and the princes commanded the Levites to sing praise now now this says they commanded them to sing now but understand this was the initial instruction that God was giving them on what was to be pleasing to the Lord the the command the instruction was thus this is how you do it and when they followed that once the instruction was given they did it that way every single time thereafter it's like almost anything you do it's like on my job when when my boss or someone on the team trains me to do something a certain way they don't have to train me again they don't have to tell me that I'm supposed to do this or how to do it I know how to do it I know what needs to be done so I go do it it's that simple but when the command comes so I see it says they commanded well what he's doing is they're he's instructing them amen this is the worship that follows amen so look now and when they had made an end of offering the king and all that were present with him bowed themselves and worship moreover King uh moreover uh Hezekiah the king the princes commanded the Levites to sing praise unto the Lord with the words of David and of uh ASF the and they sang Praises with gladness so although he told them instructed them this is what we do when they began to do it according to the command of the Lord when they did it they did it with gladness amen amen now how would we know to do something that pleased the Lord unless he told us yeah what was pleasing to him yes amen so when he tells us what is pleasing to him we say that's a command or that's instruction but he doesn't have to tell us that again God should not have to come down every service and saying raising your hands in worship is pleasing to me he should not have to do that yeah we know by the scripture that is pleasing to him it's a command instruction and he doesn't have to come every single time and say okay now raise your hand yeah right he shouldn't have to have a song leader stand up here and say okay everybody raise your hands now right right we should know to do that right and if it's in your heart to do it do it if it's not don't right that's the best I can tell you amen some people say well do it anyway it it it'll get you going maybe maybe it will but that's up to you but I'm I'm saying if it's in your heart to do then do it when God commands us when God instructs us of something he doesn't have to tell us over and over again we know to do that we know when we do that it's pleasing to the Lord right we know when we do that it's worship to the Lord as long as it's coming from our heart is worship to the Lord we know that so once the once the instruction the command has been instit Ed and it's been put into practice then it comes with gladness in the heart I I trust and believe this morning whether you're here at home that when we sang that song Lift Your Hands in praise to the Lord and we did that instruction from the song we did it with gladness yes amen we did it with gladness with worship from our heart not just because the song said so amen it isn't just that it isn't just that time it's because we do it from our heart and worship the command to the Levites they began to sing praises unto the Lord and the words of David esth the sear and they sang Praises with gladness praise the Lord not out of drudgery but with gladness and they bowed their heads and worshiped then Hezekiah answered and said now ye have consecrated yourselves unto the Lord come near and bring sacrifices and thank and thank offerings into the house of the Lord and the congregation brought in sacrifices and thank offerings and as many look at now look what it says and as many as were of a free heart amen a free heart burnt offerings now I know we have every we have a time and a place we have service excuse me we have service Sunday mornings 10:30 and we come to that it's a standard it's a standard that's been set that we have that we've decided on the Lord's provided us a place 10:30 on Sunday mornings but that doesn't change the fact that when we come here we do it with our Free Will amen it it would come to the place that it becomes such a formality and you see how it's happened in so many other ways people that they just quit doing it because they never wanted to do it to start with right if they never really wanted to do it and their heart's not there to do it it doesn't accomplish anything I shouldn't say it doesn't accomplish anything you can't come into the house of the Lord and not get something somehow uh you're going to walk out of here one way better or worse one way or the other something's going to happen to you if you come into the house of the L A real house of the Lord where the the words being preached something's going to happen to you amen one way or the other but a lot of people they would just quit they wouldn't do it at all but these people they would consider it as a command of something they had to do forced to do no this is of a free heart to bring of a free heart something that we that we desire in our hearts to do of our own free will let's go over to uh Hebrews now I got a couple more scriptures and I want to read before we dismiss Hebrews chapter 13 Hebrews 1315 look at this now by him therefore by him by God by God therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually amen the sacrifice to God uh the sacrifice of praise to God now we've gone over from Old Testament to New Testament the sacrifice is no more the the parties and the celebrations and the new moon and all and the the the killing of animals and stuff now our sacrifice because our sacrifice has been sacrificed Jesus Christ has already died and give his life and shed his blood for us once for all so now we have one thing to do that's Aller a sacrifice of praise of worship and Thanksgiving for what he's done for us for what the sacrifice did for us amen and that praise that sacrifice of praise is to be given to praise to God continually that is the fruit of our lips which a lot of people seem to want to substitute today giving thanks to his name now I'm not against any form of worship that somebody feels that they want to Worship the Lord if you want to clap clap I don't have a problem with that I mean I've mentioned it before I think in a lot of churches it's gotten to the place that people substitute that for actual worship to the lord it's just it's just an noise uh but if that's if that's your way you worship by all means I would never tell anybody if the Lord moves on you to do that to worship then worship but I want you to see what the scripture says about our praise our praise is to be given to God of the fruit of our lips the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name and look it is a whole lot lot easier to sit out there in the congregation and I would say even up here to sit out there in a congregation and do this versus worshiping the Lord with your lips how many people do you hear that actually verbalize their praise to the Lord praise the Lord hallelujah thank you Jesus amen praise God with the fruit of our lips how much easier amen and I'm not again I'm not squelching that at all if that's your form of worship if that's what you want to do to worship you go right ahead the Lord moves on you to do that you do it with the best in your heart you a free will with every ounce of energy you got amen but I'm showing you what the scripture says in giving praise sacrifice of praise from the fruit of our lips don't let one thing be a substitute for the other that's all I'm saying amen don't let this be a substitute for praise the Lord right amen because that's what the scripture says and that's all I know what the word says giving thanks to his name with the fruit of our lips that's our sacrifice we bring the sacrifice of praise amen with our lips praise God We Will We Will Rejoice but do good 16th verse now still Hebrews 13 verse 16 but do good and to communicate forget not for with such sacrifices God is well pleased amen God is well pleased you want to be well pleasing to the Lord that's one way to do it is to follow that prescription praise God give praise to God continually with the fruit of our lips amen praise the Lord fruit is something that is a result of uh uh the the the result of something else that's taken place amen like a tree a fruit wouldn't exist without a tree or or a plant am mean I know there's other plants that have fruits but a fruit wouldn't exist without a tree a fruit is just the result the end result of the existence of the tree or the plant the plant the tree there the fruit is going to come forth that fruit just proves what is in the plant if it's an orange tree it's the fruit is going to be an orange so the praise that you give is just a result of something that's already there it just proves what is in existence in your life in your heart amen amen where that coming from to Worship the Lord the fruit is just the end result it's what we give in existence to say God we acknowledge and we know that you are God and that we love you and we thank you we praise you we give you glory and honor for all that you have done and blessed us with in this life in this year this day amen praise to God praise to God that and that is well pleasing to the Lord that is well pleasing to the Lord if I want to do it I want to do it of my free will if I want to do it I do it because God's moving to do it if I want to do it I do it to Worship the Lord Jesus well pleasing to God Amen friend I don't mind telling you I I want to do things that are well pleasing to the Lord in fact I don't want to do anything that's not well pleasing to the Lord right do I am My Flesh oh I'm sure of course do I want to no I don't ever want to do anything that I wouldn't feel that wouldn't that would not be well pleasing to the Lord everything I do I want to be because that's my whole heart's desire amen that is of your free will your desire to want to be pleasing to the Lord one more scripture amen I think I have one more maybe I have two more Ephesians let's go to Ephesians chapter 5 Ephesians chapter 5 I do have two I got one more after this Ephesians 5:19 we start running into the same type of venue here though so uh speaking to yourselves in Psalms speaking to yourselves in Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord amen where does that worship begin in your heart praise God in your heart that's where your free will is remember the soul is the existence of Free Will amen praise the Lord making melody in your heart to the Lord 20th verse giving thanks always for all things unto God and the father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ giving thanks always for all things one more Philippians chapter 4 amen Philippians chapter 4: 5 let your moderation your gentleness patience the the calmness I guess you will moderation let your moderation be known unto all men the Lord is at hand be careful for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication and with Thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God praise the Lord with Thanksgiving and the peace of God which passees all understanding shall keep your hearts and Minds through Christ Jesus finally Brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are of good report if there be any virtue if there be any praise think on these things praise the Lord those things which you have both learned and received and heard and seen in me do and the God of Peace shall be with you amen all these things we do and we do and the God of Peace will be with you because those things are the things that are well pleasing to the Lord we give of our own free will we give of the desires of our heart we give because we love the Lord we do it because we want to do it and that's exactly the person that God looks for he doesn't do it because he doesn't want it be done because it's a ritual people a lot of people go to church and the whole thing is formality rituals God doesn't want rituals he wants things done of your own heart of your own free will your own desire that's what God wants from us anything else is forced is not worship it's just forced but if it's something that you do because you want to do it you do it because it's in your heart to do it you do it because you love him that's well pleasing to the Lord we sing praises to the Lord we give thanks pray to the Lord Jesus with the fruit of our lips it's a Thanksgiving we should all be very thankful this this season we have is is that time and we be thankful to the Lord Jesus very thankful for all he's done for us amen you thankful for today I'm so thankful I want the Lord to know that everything he's done for me and everything he's given me I love him and I thank him so much for it I don't know how many times during a year in my prayers I'll tell the Lord God you blessed me beyond anything that I ever deserved certainly more than ever thought but bless blessed beyond measure doesn't even describe how I feel What the Lord Has Done and given for me amen so when I say something like that it it it is that is as much as I can put it in human words and it goes beyond that why he does it is his choice his decision I'm just thankful for it amen God has been so good praise the Lord now I
