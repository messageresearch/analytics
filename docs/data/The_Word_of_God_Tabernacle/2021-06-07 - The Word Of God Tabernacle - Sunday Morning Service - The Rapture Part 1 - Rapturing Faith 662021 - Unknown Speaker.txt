you all the glory goes to you it's christ in us our hope of glory bless our pastor as he labors faithfully with your word may you use them to speak to our hearts that we can leave different than what way we came in that truly our hearts were burned within us and we as we met with you along the way this day granted lord in your name we pray name the lord jesus christ amen amen you may be seated i'm just going to read through a couple uh testimonies that were testimony that was brought in uh this morning by our brother danny um i'm just gonna read exactly how you wrote it here so i first want to give the victory to our lord and savior almost 15 years ago i was in prison and while there i was encouraged to be baptized as a christian i kept telling our ministry that i would be baptized when i was released and not parole that day was yesterday and i want to thank my brother my pastor in the word of god congregation for prayers and spiritual guidance and learning and staying [Applause] amen does anyone else have a testimony or a song special i just i just want to praise the lord for calvary amen that precious blood hitting the ground amen and for our salvation amen yes thank the lord for that amen i cannot help but cry out to god thank you i can walk amen the pain that i had i i'm amazed that i get up and i walk and i say look what you did lame to walk through oh god he caused me to walk praise the lord thank you [Music] joel has had somewhat of like a scratching problem with his skin and the lord has really been helping him last couple weeks to just clear all that up and just help him to stop that like yeah it's like a nervous tick or something so thank thank you amen praise the lord yes anyone else song special or testimony i have a testimony yes so um i've been asking the lord for three years now my my son and his girlfriend and my granddaughter have been wanting to move to washington and my prayers were that they don't move to washington that they moved somewhere where we could all gather as a family well a week ago my other daughter got a job in prescott as well so i believe god is moving my family to prescott and i just continue to pray for my family that we find housing and jobs for everybody else because i see god move in in his time not in mine amen praise the lord yes anyone else yes yes um yesterday after the baptismal we were all wet so we went and picked up some food and we live eating at danny's apartment and all of a sudden a huge gust of wind right in front of us and danny looked and behind there was no wind you know blowing the trees i says that's a sign from the lord man who did the right thing amen amen and then another quick testimony there was a sister i have been bringing her up for prayer uh gladys uh smith and um two weeks ago the lord took her and she suffered uh with cancer for over four years went through chemo for over four years but here's the testimony that really sticks in my heart i never met her but i would see her on facebook she was always happy always saying into the lord suffering like you won't believe and i then i heard the testimonies when the lord took her that she had such an impact on the believer's lives of the life she lived for the lord and i said to myself if i have half that testimony i would be happy amen for example thank the lord for taking her back home and now she's happier than she's ever been anywhere okay uh let's just sing this last song is uh we changed the order of the service it's number 698 i got on the mountain [Music] um when you're up on the mountains [Music] when is go wrong [Music] easy [Music] when things go wrong life is easy when you're up on the mountain and you've got peace [Music] don't lose [Music] oh [Music] is is [Music] is when things [Music] is amen you believe that today amen have you experienced that in your own life yeah amen you recognize and realize how god is such a god amen in the day when everything is going great but you know it's really in those hard times it's in those deep dark valleys it's in those tunnels where you don't think there's ever going to be a light at the end of that he's still god amen one of my wife's favorite uh stories i guess you call the story is the footsprints and the sands of time you see a lot of times she has things like that all over the place you know because for a while there's two sets of footprints and those are nice you enjoy those times when you look back and you realize there's many times that there was only one foot one set of footprints you think lord why did you leave me no that's when i was carrying you amen those are my those are my footsteps praise the lord and friend i can't even begin sometimes i look back and i think my where are two foot where where are there two sets there's only one there's miles and miles and miles and miles of only one set of footprints lord uh it seems like he's always carrying me but i'm so thankful that he's always there though amen and he always does do what he said he would do and that is he would never leave us or forsake us praise the lord amen god bless you today appreciate each one of you coming uh i i just feel it on my heart i really appreciate one of the micah and brother micah and brother zach know how much i appreciate uh what they do for our services and song services for the music and the singing and i went almost four years basically almost acapella and singing having to do the song service in the ministry myself and uh i i i appreciate them and i love them i thank them so much for doing what they do for our church service and song service and amen so god bless you too again appreciate you coming appreciate if you're watching streaming today may the lord richly bless you as well amen let's stand to our feet if we could we're going to turn over to scripture to first thessalonians first thessalonians chapter four i want to start a series on the rapture and it's been in my heart for a little while now and i just felt like when we got back from any interruption of service like from the trip and all that i felt on my heart to to do this so i want to try to start that today at the lord willing amen so we're going to begin our scripture reading first thessalonians chapter 4 verse 13. amen this is probably going to take several services but just however the lord leads and see where it goes from here but just we're at that time friend and it's just really really been pressing on my heart uh to bring this and just pray the lord meet with us and bless us in it but let's just bow our heads for another word of prayer if we could before we read the word precious lord jesus it is such a privilege to be here again lord thank you so much for this place that you've given us provided for us thank you lord for your life and our lives in our hearts lord leading us guiding us giving us the desire to be here today yes lord there's of course many places we could be today and of course there's many people that are in many other different places but god you've drawn us here once again lord to learn of you and for you to speak to us and meet with you father lord you promised us in this last day that where two or three are gathered in your name you would be in the midst lord we're many many more than that today god but we're trusting that lord we're following the obedience of your word that we would meet and gather together like this even that much more as we see the day approaching father and it's been pressed on every one of our hearts i believe lord but on mine here god to approach this subject today and just believing god that your holy spirit is here that your anointing god is flowing through this place and that you're going to use this vessel to speak the words that you'd have us to hear to draw us closer to you help help us to become more like your lord and lord to be ready in this time this hour that you've given us father it is a late hour we know that we're looking forward in any moment in time god for the resurrection of the dead for our loved ones to begin to peer before us god knowing that we won't have but a short time after that you'll call us to be home with you yes lord help us in this late hour to do all we can for you but to continue to uh be faithful at the post that you've given us father to be led by your spirit and yes lord may you just use us from all that we do and say and lord may you get glory and honor out of it lord i thank you for being with us in this service today help those that are here bless and help those who weren't able to make it today lord the prayer requests the needs of circumstance situations lord you are more than faithful god and we we thank you and love you for it lord yes now god we pray that your would bless the reading of your word as we committed to you in the reigning part of the service again lord that it would be uh it would glorify and magnify you lord because that's what the purpose that we're here for and we commit it to you now in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen amen amen first thessalonians 4. let's begin with ver chapter 4 verse 13. we know it probably some of us may be quoted by heart uh i actually was kind of torn back and forth of which subject or which scripture start with just so many you can but i i settled on this after study yesterday so but i would not have you to be ignorant brother concerning them which are asleep that you sorrow not even as others which have no hope for if we believe that jesus died and rose again even so them also which sleep in jesus will god bring with him for this we say unto you by the word of the lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the archangel and with the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with uh with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air so shall we ever be with the lord wherefore comfort want to comfort one another with these words you can be seated if you like i mean as i said there's several scriptures that could have been read to begin beginning this thought but this is really probably the most renowned scripture that we look to when we talk about a rapture or a catching away and when it hit my heart it it it reached that place of of the word rapture or where we get rapture from and really where we get rapture from we know here is uh is in the 17th verse when it says that we those who live and remain shall be caught up together that caught up is what we talk about when we talk about being enraptured or a rapture that takes place or a reaching of a different dimension an elevation of of of persons as if you will to a higher dimension to a higher realm and being enraptured uh reaching that level being caught up and that's what the scripture referring to is is to be caught up amen so as we start this subject on the rapture again like i said there's probably going to be several parts to this because as i look into it of course you mull it through your mind all the time because it's just a subject that is always on a christian's heart it is a subject it's always or should be always on a christian's mind is the rapture you know brother greene always reminded us that brother branham said never lose your enthusiasm for the coming of the lord well that's the rapture that's the catching away and us as people as christians reaching that place so it's a very uh very much a paramount thought in our minds that we always keep there's always something that that that we think of maybe not every single day but almost every day at least probably every week at some point in time christians around the world think about or are consumed with the rapture what is it going to be like who's going to be in it when is it going to happen who all's going to know there's pictures drawn there's photo uh a paintings made of you know and movies made of a rapture taking place and planes crashing and cars crashing and people going up into the air and and all these people looking at them and all these things that are taking place but i want you know friend it's not going to be like that but not according to the scripture right i'm not sure exactly what that what that pain beautiful pain uh very good artistry work but it's very unscriptural because if you look at the scripture it's not at all going to be like that uh we know that the the the rapture is going to be a secret catching away it's going to be like a thief in the night right it's going to be something that's going to happen and the world's not really even going to know about it right there's going to be probably a few select people there's going to be a a small amount of people around the world that are going to know right they're going to know that it's happening and maybe they start crying out about it maybe they start saying something about it and of course those people may very well and the tribulation end up in a a in a a rubber room i guess i don't know what better terminology to put it people think they've gone insane the rapture has already taken place uh uh they've gone they've gone crazy you know last last week uh you heard the subject about the misunderstanding that i talked about and uh kind of felt that like this goes right along with it a little bit because of the things that are misunderstood in here and i was reading uh some of the notes that scofield out of my study scofield bible had in here and i didn't realize how far off scofield was on on something as paramount and is as fundamental as as the rapture i look at some of his notes and i'm like my that is wrong and i look at this it goes over this note and i said man he's wrong there and i thank god for a prophet to come and help us to bring that scripture to tie all those things together and show us that this goes with this this goes with this this is out here and this doesn't happen until over here and uh and all those things but uh after service last week brother pat came up to me and uh said something that i had i had forgotten about that would have went really well with uh with with the uh uh uh with the subject that we were on last sunday because uh he as brother pat's given his testimony in church before how many of you were there it's been many years ago but uh about him going in the military and his private interview with brother branham and uh wanting to get out of the military and not have to be drafted and all and and you know brother brown says i i don't have a word of the lord for you but uh maybe the lord's got to work for you to do and of course brother pat as his testimony he had a work of the lord and uh he fulfilled we believe in retrospect and fulfilled that work of the lord and met the man that he led to the lord and uh told him about the prophet and the message and all and and brother pat had a radio he was listening and of course i'm condensing the story way down and he heard that there was a rapture taking place and they were all gathering in jeffersonville because the rapture was going on and brother pat got so excited he went out of his tenors uh wherever he was sleeping telling everybody the rapture was on the rapture was on the rapture was on well obviously that was a misunderstanding the rapture wasn't actually as we would say catching away at that moment in time although the rapture's been on uh basically since the death of christ since pentecost it's been on yes uh but uh to the point that we're all a body changing and enraptured that's a different story so it's a little misunderstanding but because of that uh brother uh pat going around and telling uh the all the ones around him and his sergeant and everybody the rapture is on the rapture zone that's happening in jefferson after islam they thought he was crazy so they sent him home because of misunderstanding they thought well this he's just lost his marbles he's and they sit and that's how he got to come home they thought he was crazy just because of the this news report that the rapture was on the misunderstanding that's there of the rapture taking place at that moment in time but the the fact of it is that uh there's going to be people that are going to know about it but it's going to be a secret catching away it's not going to be something that everybody's going to know about it's not going to be broadcast worldwide although it's going to be an international rapture right i think the alive and remain group is going to be a small enough group that there's so many people that disappear off this earth every day that nobody knows anything about and know know where they go and what happens to them then that uh that that's just gonna happen if people are just to say well they just disappear because of so and so and such and such and and life is just going to go on like normal churches are going to keep having church and preachers are going to keep preaching people going to keep coming to the altar they're going to keep having celebrations and worship and everything else going on just like it was going on before unlike the movie left behind it won't be like that right they're all in despair we miss the rapture and then they got even gonna know right they're not gonna know because it's gonna be a secret calling away it's not going to be to the to the multitudes it's not going to be to the huge conglomerations the denominations it's for a little elected lady that god calls and we chose to by the scripture call ourselves the bride amen that is the bride that god is calling to take her home to be with him one day and and that rapture is for that gentile bride yes that's what the rapture is for it is not for the old testament saints we know that's already taken place it's not for the jews it's for god's gentile bride of this new testament from the day of pentecost on through every church age it's not going to be just for the alive and remain it's going to be for those that have fallen asleep in christ from the very first church age from peter and paul and all those disciples there up until this moment and however long the lord may tarry it's going to be all of those that are alive and remain they're going to come up together and we're all going to be uh uh uh together here brother adam said 30 minimum 30 days and we're all going to go home to meet the lord in the air now the rapture in the rapture message because the rapture itself the rapture is a revelation now if the rapture is a revelation that it that excludes those that don't believe in revelation if a person a christian say well how can a christian not believe in revelation it's all through the bible good question i don't really know how they could but they did brother branham's time they do today they still deny the fact that there's revelation but god reveals to those to whom he will and he reveals to whom he will what he wants them to know yes now we may not all know everything all at the same time but we'll know what the lord that we need to know of the word and reveal to us to be able to change our mortal bodies into incorruption into immortality so that this body will change to go meet the lord in the air yes to a glorious body so that rapture being a revelation brings the understanding that this that it's a rapturing faith amen a faith a faith that brings about rapture a faith that brings about a body change and and that's kind of going to be the part of it that i want to talk about today now look at this quote but in the rapture message now you know brother bradham he just one little bank within yuma uh he preached the rapture message he was talking about only being 30 minutes i think it ended up being an hour that was trying to run him out and uh he kept saying over and over and he said okay we gotta hurry now and uh and rush through the last part of it but it ended up being a while so much so brother branham says i heard they took up an offer i want to take that offer and pay for the extended time of the use of the room see so uh but it's just this one message but in the rapture message brother madam makes this uh several of course quotes about the rapture but this one says but to the bride listen now to the bride the rapture is a revelation to her it is a revelation to her what is a revelation revelations faith remember we talked about a revelation uh to me a revelation is something that god reveals to you that becomes a part of who you are yes okay it becomes a part of who your your being your the way you live and who you are it just becomes a part of you just as much as you are a human being you live the life of a human being because you're a human being it's revealed to you that you're a human being you know you're a human and no nobody can come along and try to convince you that you're a gorilla nobody can come by and try to convince you that you're an elephant because you know you're not you're not a whale you're not a chimpanzee you're you're not a koala you're a human and nobody convinced you right nobody can convince you any different at all the revelation is the same thing it just becomes a part of who you are when god reveals something to you it drops down in your heart and it settles in there to the truth of what the word is and nobody else nobody can reason away then the scripture becomes enlightened to you the word becomes enlightened at that point the word is not just word anymore it's not just script on a page it becomes a living oracle it becomes a living word it becomes a living being because the word is christ and it becomes alive to you and and when it's alive to you then you take the other scripture and it ties itself in and it fits in so perfectly to say how could i miss that before because you didn't have the revelation of it amen and you didn't have the revelation because people try to intake intellectually tie the scripture together like again i said about scuffled notes he tried to intellectually uh uh bring these scriptures in together to try to make them tie together to try to make them make sense saints the bible isn't here to be sensible to you it is here for you to gain revelation of regardless of whether you understand it or not you don't have to understand something with your mental faculties for god to reveal it to you for you to understand in your spirit what it is by revelation you know there's going to be a rapture because it's revealed to you there's going to be a rapture amen not just because the bible says so even but because god's revealed that bible to you i i told you before i have taken a little issue now this is just my it's i'm not saying it should be changed so don't get me wrong i'm not arguing against it but i have a little disagreement with the seven seal book the seven seal book says the revelation of the seven seals but friend it's not the revelation of anything right it's the understanding is the truth of only god can bring revelation brother branham could not bring revelation he can preach the revelation that god give him of something but that doesn't reveal it to you it just becomes knowledge to you at that point right that's all it is it's just knowledge if they want to put the truth of the seven seals okay but it's not revealed until god reveals it to you and when god reveals it to you then it all fits perfectly and you think my i always wondered where that scripture would fit in and now because of god revealing something and it could have been something over here not even that scripture but that scripture comes in places in there and then maybe that scripture comes because it's a revelation right the rapture is the same way friend the rapture is a revelation it is something that is revealed to you it is something that you know is going to happen because it's ingrained in your spirit and nobody can take it away from you it's a revelation because faith is a revelation if faith is a revelation it's revealed to you that by faith you believe it amen now without faith you can't believe that something exists right if you can't see it faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things what no not not seen right so if it's not seen then you have to have faith to believe that it exists if you cannot come through that door today and show me a living embodiment god almighty standing before you how are you going to prove to somebody he exists right right it's got to be by faith you've got to receive it by faith and faith is a revelation how did abel know to offer to god a more excellent sacrifice than what cain's sacrifice was because it was revealed to him it wasn't just knowledge it was revealed to him what was pleasing to the lord and by faith amen by faith he offered to god a more excellent sacrifice what was that faith that faith was a revelation i am sure because you know sometimes we super spiritualize everything especially being in the message you know we have to super spiritualize everything but not everything is super spiritualized in fact a very small fraction of things really are super spiritualized the rest of is just god working in humans right it's just god doing his work through me and you god doing his work through brother brown god doing his work through men and women today through holy ghost-filled christians today it's just god working through us i think it's this exact same thing in the garden of eden i think that adam adam was talking to cain and abel and and i believe and i believe adam relayed the whole story of what happened and and it thinks the garden of eden and the fallen i think both boys were privy to the information that adam gave to him but to one boy it was just knowledge but to the other boy it was a revelation to abel it was a revelation it was revealed to abel by faith that what god had done in the garden of eden was what was pleasing to the lord that it took blood it took a blood sacrifice to please the lord oh well cain heard the uh this is just me this is not in the scripture but if i envision it and i see what happened in the garden of eden i could see adam walking with cain and abel i will just say for sake of argument his sons walking in the garden of eden now we know cain was of the wicked one it wasn't adam's seed but for lack of conversation there he's walking and talking to them and telling them just like a father with his sons teaching his sons raising them this is this this is this this is the story of this and this is what happened here and this is what happened to me and your mother and all you know how dad will do his kids that's all it is we can't you make everything so super spiritualized friend it's just a dad talking to his sons talking to the boys that are there that he's raising but to what it became knowledge it didn't mean anything to cain right he listened to the same story that abel listened to but he didn't have it he didn't have what he needed to gain the revelation of what the story meant what the what the behind the story was by revelation then abel was able to all front unto god a more excellent sacrifice by faith because to abel it was more than just a story to able it was more than just what happened to the garden of eden or just what happened to his mom and dad it was more than that right it was a revelation of whom the man the the deity that he was trying to please and live for it meant more to him to be able to please that deity and what it took to please him than just a story it was a revelation and when that revelation come time to be able to offer up a sacrifice to that god they were worshiping he knew it took more than just fruits and vegetables and body life right it took blood very much god himself signified by the slaying of those lambs that it was going to take blood to bring them back blood to please the lord innocent blood and abel knew that how did he know that he knew that by revelation by faith become revealed to him was revealed to him that it meant more to him than just a story hey this is what happened well cages well that's just a story that's a nice story pop appreciate that and let me just offer my sacrifice over here my peaches and apricots and apples and everything and surely the lord will accept that no no he won't because that sacrifice is without revelation right it's without spiritual truth to it amen that revelation now that that revelation by faith is a revelation it's what the rapture is to god's people to god's children to some it's a story in the bible to some it's fiction to some they don't even believe it to some it's just fiction to some it's a story in the bible to some they believe it's a million miles down the road never happened in our lifetime to some it is the most precious thing that we look to in the scripture of god's promise to his children of where he's going to take them yes amen that's why paul says to the thessalonian church as those that have no hope i don't want you to sorrow yes it's okay to grieve it's okay to be sorrowful to miss your loved ones but don't grieve as those that have no hope don't grieve as though you'll never see them again see as those that have no hope because there's people there and there's people today that have no hope because they have put their hope and trust in something else right they put their hope and trust in a government or in a money or in or in possessions or in medicine or in insurance they put their hope and trust in everything but god right and you put your hope in everything else you've got no hope right they have no hope they have no hope today there's people that think they have hope but they don't have hope because they haven't placed this word by revelation in their heart amen what did david say i'll take this and place it in my heart lord so i will not sin against you what is that that's a revelation amen that's that's david taking god's word into himself so that he won't sin against him what i plan to do and trust in my life my desire is to do everything i can do to be pleasing to you lord and that's all that's a christian that's our mantra that is our mantra to that that is our motive that's what we all should aspire to do in our lives lord what is it that's going to be pleasing to you help me to do that that's a revelation that's something that is revealed to you that is a dying of yourself so that christ can live in you through you and by him then in you a victorious life amen praise not without bumps and haunts and dips but it's a victorious life amen amen what did brother branham talk about a brother green all all those times brother branham told him about him billy paul all his great buddies here you'll be great buddies on the other side and all this stuff in the middle what does it matter yeah yeah amen what does this matter what does this amount to yes got bumps and humps lots and dips and all these rough places and hard places but you know in the end that's what god's looking for the result yeah the end result yes lord bring it as a revelation to our hearts bring it as a revelation when i read his bible every time i i try to remember every time lord just reveal to me and hear what you want me to know amen god will reveal it to you so the rebel the rapture is a revelation it's a revelation you think well that's just simple it really isn't because it's not for everybody nor is the revelation or the rapture is not for everybody but to the bride the rapture is a revelation to her it's revealed to her that the revelation the true bride of christ will be waiting for that revelation of the rapture now it is a revelation for the revelation is faith like we just talked about the revelation is faith you cannot have a revelation without it being faith because when something's revealed to you it doesn't have to be tangible it doesn't have to be something you can see tasteful smell or hear it it doesn't have to be something you can imagine a reason in your mind but you know it is because it's a revelation well how do you how is it revealed how do you believe it you got to have faith you got to have faith the only way to please the lord is how by faith you got to have faith is a revelation you cannot you cannot have a revelation without it being faith faith is a revelation because it's something that is revealed to you and it's revealed to you that's it amen somebody gives you a little bit of knowledge from the scripture you say oh i see that jesus said father son the holy ghost so hey let's baptize and follow us on the holy ghost after all is what jesus said that's a great argument but if you take the revelation of the word and you bring it down to what the what what the truth of it is and you see peter uh who had just come out from the holy spirit and in the upper room said the name of the lord jesus christ all that then you think well then why did jesus say this over here well if you have a revelation of what peter said in acts 2 38 what jesus said in in matthew 28 becomes alive amen you think i praise the lord they're just saying the same thing right amen amen it is simple because it's revealed but you believe it by faith amen i think god danny got that revelation amen he got his break he got his anklet off last sunday and he didn't want to waste past one saturday and he got a text said let's do it this saturday i said praise the lord let's do it amen amen so by the grace of god me and brother dennis were able to take and baptize brother danny in the name of the lord jesus christ you've been waiting for it amen and thankful because it became a revelation amen yeah because it was a revelation i've been in i've been in places where uh we're a great move of the spirit's going and it's wonderful and the spirit is falling and people are getting emotional and happy and they come to the altar and all and they go on they want to get baptized and another one sees somebody get baptized and inspires them to get baptized and then on and on and next thing you know 20 30 people been baptized well did they get baptized because it was revealed to them that they should get baptized by the word or were they just caught up in the emotion as they see somebody else getting baptized right i've seen people do that and next thing you know they're out back in the world right just doing whatever living however it wasn't a revelation to them they got caught up in the emotion or the feeling of it and what was going on and or wanted to be a part of the group or something and and they go and get baptized but it didn't mean anything because it was first of all probably there's no repentance it's got to be a true repentance a turn for that revelation to take effect now faith is a revelation because it's something that's revealed to you faith is a revelation is something that has been revealed like it was to abraham that could call anything contrary that what uh to what had been revealed to him as though it wasn't so now faith that's what faith is is the revelation of god the church is built upon a revelation the whole entire body is built upon that revelation that revelation of who god is now that revelation has got to bring a rapturing faith to a group of people those that have gone on and who resurrect first the dead those who have fallen asleep in christ they did so at that position of their life if they're going to be there when they passed they were in that position they were in that place of when they resurrected they were going to go to meet the lord they would be in the first resurrection see when they died they died in that place when this alive and remain group get to that place when she's alive in her name to to get to that place of rapturing faith to where she doesn't taste death then it's revealed to her that in any moment in time that this is going to begin to take place in our lives that a rapturing faith has got to come and and and instill its its position in your heart now we've talked about rapturing faith before we've talked about faith and and of course to me a perfect faith that brother branham preached is a rapturing faith because you can't get any better than a faith that has absolutely no failures or faults in it because that's what perfect is perfect faith is something that has no faults no mistakes it's it's the epitome of what it's supposed to be that would bring that would be a rapturing faith right now rapturing faith has got to be coupled with the timing the placement of god's perfect will for this event to take place amen now that that's not to say see look now that that the bride or that portions of it don't at this moment have rapturing faith you may have you may have reached a place in your life of or we'll just call it perfect faith i don't see too many people agreeing amen i feel the same way trust me uh i think when that perfect faith hits i won't be here anymore but there may be that place where you you you've received that kind of faith because look faith comes by hearing and hearing the word of god amen does it not right faith comes by hearing and hearing the word of god uh isaiah isaiah 55 says uh let's start with the sixth verse do you want to turn there go ahead i don't want to rush like i said it's going to be several parts to this so isaiah chapter 55 verse 6 because again mass man please say this again we so many times and please don't get it fixed in your mind saints that that everything is just super spiritualized everything has to be a super spiritual uh supernatural event of some kind all of it we know supernatural i mean because god is supernatural but most of the time it's just common elements of common things that just happen in our daily lives right right it's not something that's we get this superhero mentality can i say it that way yeah you just think that you're gonna ascend up onto the on the top of mount limit with some cape or something i got perfect faith i'm super spiritual and and some proclamation or exclamation when jesus was born did was there any proclamation on the mountains or any was there any bells whistles fireworks was it just a simple humble woman a simple humble man yes in a manger in in on a manure pile our savior was born yes no fanfare no capes no superhero supernatural spiritual i'm here to come to the world now jesus didn't come like that simple thinking if there's ever going to be a super spiritually then it's going to be the birth of jesus well that's exactly how they missed him right because that's what they had configured in their minds that this was going to happen when our messiah comes he's going to descend on the mount of olives with a tape and a robe and he's going to wipe them all away it wasn't that wasn't the bible the torah first of all but that's how they missed it they were blinded remember when we talked about them being blinded in the free will service the free will they were blinded how are they blinded because they had already had all this other stuff fixed in their minds it's going to be like this it's going to be like this god's going to do this it's going to be some great supers and then they missed the whole thing they absolutely were blinded and missed the entire event of their messiah coming and so many times we do the exact same thing yes we have it so fixed in our minds if god's going to do it like this and do it like this it's going to happen like this it's going to be all this great pop and circumstances all these things his bells and whistles and fireworks and everything and god's going to descend down on cattle in the mountains and a robe and and take it all over and see it's we get it so super spiritualized we miss how easily how commonly how perfectly and shall i say even mundane that god actually works most of the time that's how god actually works most of the time right it's just in the simplicity of it and that's what he's doing here that's that's what i want to help us to see friend you think oh well what it is like going to the fair and hitting that bell and yeah you hit the bell bing i hit it down that's i made it it doesn't work that way that's not how the supernatural the spiritual element works in our lives it doesn't work like that right that's why we're sitting here thinking oh brother you says there's people it's probably god might have perfect faith you might oh you i might you don't know it you might not know it but look friend faith comes by hearing the word amen well let me ask you a question do you listen to the word do you read the word right now do you listen to the word of the hour i'm not talking about a hybrid word it can't be something from uh some hibernation or some man's opinion or idea of the word but a purity of the holiness of god's unadulterated word because that's the only thing that will bring it yes and the only thing that will bring it so that's i'm only talking about that well when it's that then you can know right and this is the that faith comes by hearing so if you're hearing the word if the word is being ministered to your heart if you're reading it if you're listening to tapes or you're coming to church and you're listening to the word and the word is feeding you then look friend it's going to do what god said it will do whether you realize it's going on inside you or not it is there amen look what jesus look what isaiah says 55 and 6 seek ye the lord while he may be found call ye upon him while he is near let the wicked forsake his way in the unrighteous man his thoughts and let him return unto the lord and he will have mercy upon him and to our god for he will abundantly part praise the lord for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways saith the lord thank god for that amen praise the lord amen that's the truth amen so what does that mean well first of all that means that your carnal thoughts are going to be so far removed from what the truth really is that your way of it and your imagination and conjuring of it in your own imagination or thoughts are going to be so far removed from what the truth really is sometimes it's just you know it's like brother adam said just let it happen just let it come to pass don't worry about it you know we're enthused we're excited we're expecting we're we're in anticipation for the coming of the lord for the rapture but it's not that it changes and and makes our lives something different than what god's called us to do amen that's that's just moving outside of the realm of what god's called us to do remember last week program said if you plant potatoes just keep planting them right if i was building a house and i knew god was coming tomorrow i'd keep building on that house or that church or those potatoes or whatever i want to be found faithful at the post where god's put me what god has set before me i want to be found faithful doing that whatever it is amen you see now that's the simplicity of it look ninth verse for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts and your thoughts for as the rain cometh down and the snow from heaven and return it thought thither but water it uh water at the earth and make it bring forth and bud that it may give seed to the sower and bread to the eater so shall that's just a metaphor parable of of what the point god's trying to make through isaiah of course so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth his word see it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which i have pleased and shall prosper in the thing whereunto i sent it so if god's promised word is that faith cometh by hearing and you are hearing then what is going on inside you what is going on in your spiritual life god is bringing and adding faith to you whether you realize it or know it or not because that's the promise of his word he didn't ask you to feel it he just asked you to believe it and you just have to believe it that what he said it's not going to return void faith comes by hearing and if his word's going out it's going to do what he said it's going to do yes it's not going to return to him void just like the water that comes down and and waters the seed it brings forth life his word does the same thing it's coming into you and it's watering that seed and it's bringing forth life and as you need it it will be there so friend my belief here is and what i'm trying to say about this faith is that when when when the time is whatever time it is i know brother brahma said the rapture is overdue and the bride get herself ready the last one to come in or that last one to come in that last seed to come in which kind of became a little bit of a a sweep of the ministry a few years back it seemed like every preacher was preaching about that last seed and and that is true brother adam did say that that lassie to come in well what is that that last seed coming in doesn't have anything to do with your faith you understand what i'm saying it doesn't have anything to do with whether you have perfect faith or rapturing faith or not that is a timing element and that was the other element that i'm telling you about about the rapture yes the rapturing faith has got to be in place with the bride but it's got to be a timing element and that timing element is as he said that when that last seed comes in now what does that mean i don't know right now i would say it means when the last predestinated seed of these church ages has come and received the holy ghost that that that would be that last seed but now does that mean as soon as they're baptized receive the holy ghost do do they do they themselves need to attain to a place of that rapturing faith themselves first right now i don't know i can't tell you those things i just know what he said and what he said is when that last scene then the rapture will go are so many words don't quote me on that but so many words when that last seed comes in what does that mean well that just means that it's a timing element when that last seed comes and the then the bride internationally after she's listened to the word she's feasted on the word of god the message of the hour the the truth of god's word she has garnered then that faith is common it's built in her and it's become to a place that that as it is needed it becomes evident it becomes tangible then because you need it then it comes to a place where that rapturing faith takes over yes in your life i mean how how many of you we've had a lot of testimonies here recently i i've exhorted that because i i i want to be honest i'm proud of it not uh carnally proud but uh loving my congregation proud and my lord proud and and and all that goes with that the testimonies the miracles that god's been doing with us in this church how many testimonies we have today four or five i mean just we have more testimonies and prayer requests i like that amen amen that's just tremendous how god is doing and what god is doing but when that when that situation arose you don't you may not have known that that you had the faith to meet that challenge but when the challenge came when the opportunity presented itself the faith was there to meet it yeah hallelujah well your the faith was always there and see that's that's the thing that i've been challenged with my whole ministry and i've heard from so many people for so long and used to believe and fall in line myself but fred i've come to understand by the word and by the promises of god's word that god's bride is getting to that place or she is at that place if we're that close friend she is at that place if we're that close she's there at that place where she's gotten internationally now the bride not the church not the pretenders the true bride the living and remain have got to that place that in them when the challenge comes it'll be there to meet it won't if there won't be a necessity of of some emergency prayer meeting right there won't be a a a place of saying oh i've got to get a bunch of faith here real quick or something it's going to be there yes amen my proclamation to you friends today is it is there you may not realize it but the last time you needed some kind of a healing faith some kind of a supernatural faith and and and and the challenge came that faith met that challenge yes amen amen my own grandson today and his testimony oh my just just bless your heart because you know what he goes through yeah and and i know most of the times that we testify things i you know me and my wife especially are very privy to a lot of those things you might not know the details and stuff and how and how when you see me react and when you see my heart explode like it does you just you just don't know yeah sometimes you all just don't know when a sister brother or son when there's a testimony that takes place you just don't know that what what the underlying of that is and what a miracle it is right that god stepped forth and supernaturally did what he did well that was a faith that met that there was a faith that met that challenge yeah if i have that faith you have that faith we all have that faith together there's nothing that this church that that you as and we as a body of believers couldn't do nothing that's right not one thing first and foremost we make sure it's the will of the lord right the will of the lord is first and foremost that's the position that's the placement it's got to be according to the will of the lord i know brother graham said the rapture was overdue when he when the bride gets itself ready well what's that ready could just be as simple as that last season coming in because it's going to be an entire body yes from the toes to the crown of your head it's going to be a whole body from the first church age to the last it's going to be an entire body it started out in the feet coming out through the torso into the head into the intelligence in this last age but it makes up an entire body yes god's coming after a perfect bride she is without spot wrinkle and blemish she is a perfect bride she doesn't have the tip of her pinky finger missing right she's coming down to the various i believe brother noel johnson said one time to the very bottom of the skin on the bottom of your foot he's coming for a bride yes a whole bride a whole person yeah amen from the beginning to the end that's what he's coming for and there can't be one thing out of place there's one thing out of place it's not going to happen but don't you think for a minute that god's up there tapping i just wish those people would hurry up and get ready this is just i've been waiting so long for that bride to get ready i'm waiting to have a marriage supper that's god's not up there doing that right amen sometimes i've heard things that would make you almost think like that that god is setting up there and he's just you know arms cross just waiting for us to get ready just just go ahead and get ready so i can rap you now it's that's not god's not doing that right there's a place there's a time there's god's perfect will yes everything about it falls in line if we're according to this truth if we're a part of that word yes amen if we're part of that bride then we're part of all of what god's doing through revelation through faith that faith come by hearing hearing the word of god amen i want to give you example here in a minute but let me read this quote to you spiritual food and due seasons and i want you to get to build up now this holy oracles of god in the faith the faith of this hour amen the faith of this hour the faith is going to take more faith than ever was in any age for this has to be rapturing faith to be taken up right this has to be in this last day rapturing faith to be taken up what brings faith the word what had there to come in this last age to bring that kind of faith the word right amen the truth of the word of god brought through a vindicated prophet to a bride of christ revealed to her heart to show her who she is to bring faith into her heart for a body change it could only have happened in this last day you said oh they had great faith back then all kind of miracles and things that took place absolutely they did pentecost you think of the great faith they had at pentecost and the miracles through the book of acts all the miracles that took place how could they have not had rapturing faith wasn't time for it right i had to go through all the church ages see going to the ground come back forth had to die rock come back into this last day to take all those words because see god had a gentile bride he had to get her together right that wild olive tree had to be grafted in and bring all those loose ends from all those church ages to this last age to bring a message to bring the truth of a word to bring a bride to the place that she realizes in that word who she is and that faith coming by hearing that word amen to produce a rapture what did he say could not happen till this last day had to be in this last day and this is the day that we're living we're at the end of that it feels like sometimes we're past the end of that we're not we can't get ahead of god but we're at the end of that it's not some gift all the gifts of prophecies everything but it was in brother brown's ministry that was just catch attention to people that was first second pull that didn't mean anything or it meant something but it wasn't what god was using to bring this bride to the place where she's in rapture and condition a rapturing faith it didn't say faith comes by prophecies it didn't say faith comes by tongue speaking it didn't say faith comes by supernatural healing no faith comes by the word hearing the word right the word ministered to you though it be from a minister or you reading it yourself and the holy ghost ministering to you because it's a holy ghost anyway if it's a true minister of god it's it's the holy spirit ministering in any way whether it's somebody standing up here whether it's you reading and god revealing it straight from his work same same god same holy spirit same difference brings the same results in this last day has to be that way not a first bull not a second poll not miracles healings testimonies all the those are all fine and good friends that would just get people's attention but when you go and i've done a lot of fishing in my life done sainting i've done uh cast netting and you throw out the cast i used to do that in florida you throw it a cast net you pull it in you get all kind of stuff yeah i hate rocks and and and pieces of wood and you know i get some of the little fish i'm looking for for bait but i get other stuff too i get things we just toss those back that's not what i was looking for that's not what i threw it out there for i threw it out there to get this specific fish so i could go fishing with him that's what i threw him out for so that that that the the testimonies the the miracles the healings the the prophecies that that was just all just to get the attention of the people so you can say well this one and then this one and then this one because that's what god came for look at this look away to jesus so now i'm going to say something you probably heard this just this quote i think i've probably read it before but to me it's very powerful because december 1963 look away to jesus so now i'm going to say something to you now that i haven't said all along and that is the thing that we've uh looked for for so long for us many years four or five years maybe longer the third poll has now been vindicated and i'm sure you know what it is now vindicated is something to say well the third poll was here but now it's made itself known third part has many elements to it and the message isn't about the third poll but the third poll has many elements about it the most prominent element is the revealing of the word the opening of the word right because there had to be an opening of the word for all the other elements to become part of it that opening of the word what's the word the word is jesus christ christ is the word vindicating itself so what is he saying the third poll has now been vindicated i'm sure you know what it is the third pull opening of the word december 63. okay now remember there'll never be any impersonation of that because it can't be now notice satan can impersonate all these gifts right the prophecies the speaking in tongues the the the miracles the healings hey miracles healings yeah you don't believe so go to revelation 13. amen miracles because of miracles that he does many people follow him right all those no it's those the tests the uh miracles and all the things that took place the devil can impersonate those things he can impersonate those uh prophecies or or that tongue speaking or whatever he can impersonate those little gifts and things but what he can't do is bring that word word by word it is pure condition now you can hybrid it like he did to eve in the garden of eden he brought 99 of it to her but you saw what that one percent calls the 1 error cost and satan cannot bring that word word by word if he could friend he would have come through the blood of christ he'd be your brother right but he can't that's why there can't be an impersonation of this because the opening of that word and the revealing of christ to this last day brought a creation power to not just the prophet but to the bride of christ for this last day yeah it brought a creative power you hear what i'm saying yes those the storm going and the squirrels and all those things those were just things that god used to vindicate a prophet to show that that was just the wave sheath to show that this bride is in the same position to do what he did right because it's the same god amen we're his children filled with his holy spirit we're the same people god has created that for us that was just an example well what is the one thing that satan cannot do he cannot create yes because the pure word is a creation jesus said let in the beginning god said god created how did god create he spoke the word spoke and created a pure unadulterated word of god came forth and created the earth the heavens the universe the galaxies whatever however far it goes i'm not smart enough to know all that he created it by his work he spoke it created with the word then spoken out of him created what does the same word spoken out of a believer today do right it does the exact same thing yes how do you think healing comes how do you think deliverance comes that's just you speaking that and bringing about what you said would happen it's a creation satan can't do that that's why satan can't heal satan can't heal because healing's a creation amen he perverts and makes you sick he perverts and sends things down the gutter but he cannot create that's why faith operates by love there's not a single solitary fiber of love in satan not one not a speck people worship him people love him people try to go into the imaginations of satan but he has not one single fiber in his being of love for that person not one they want to go be with him they think hell is going to be so much more fun than heaven i know you've heard that garbage too but there's not what they don't know is there's not one single cell not a single atom or however we are made up in him to love that person to love anybody love operates the faith creation he cannot do it all these gifts and things he can impersonate but he cannot create it's a pure word the third poll has been vindicated there'll never be any impersonation of that cause it cannot be now it's in existence he said now it's in existence and i warned of this right soon right at this time now it's just happened so it could identify he said it's just happened so it can identify its presence among you see but it will not be used in a great way until this council begins to tighten up when it does when the things of pentecostals so forth can almost impersonate anything that can be done but when that time comes when the squeeze comes down then you'll see what you've seen temporarily be manifested in the fullness of its power where by whom you're looking at the bride of jesus christ internationally endued with that same power yes what did he tell him on the day of pentecost he told him they would be endued with power from on high yes were they amen are we you better believe it amen praise the lord as that holy spirit comes sweeping through there on the day of pentecost and it does the same thing yes amen amen i don't know if you ever feel or know it for him but he comes and sweeps through this place every time we're here every time without fail i pray for him every time and he is without fail every time amen amen praise the lord now i must continue evangelism he talks about um he said so the third pull is here let me move down because my time is out he said now this third pull will be the thing he said now to my opinion he said this will be the thing to my opinion i don't say the lord tells me this this will be the thing that will start the rapturing faith for the going away for the rapture what is that that's the word that's the third poll that's the manifestation of the the revelation of god's word to his people faith comes by hearing it's not complicated it's not hard people want to make it hard people want to complicate and scruple it all up even ministers try to bring all these things out friend it's not that hard it's not that complicated and it's not something that you got to sit there and say i got to work something up no faith comes by hearing if you're listening to the word if you're reading the word if god's revealing the holy spirit come revealing that true word of god for this day in your heart you are being endued with that power with that faith and it's in you it's that's why it's so important not not to let it rust or rot or sit on the shelf but to read it and listen to it to come to church to put on the tapes to do what you can to make sure that you're being fed the right kind of diet yes the right kind of food because faith comes from that yes amen that's where faith comes from now with this last i'm going to try to make this short with this last part of that word coming in look the type that we have of this of this body change this type that we have brother branham comes from abraham and sarah that that's that's the scriptural precedent that god uses when he talks about a body change bringing forth the promised son first of all there's got to be a body change to bring forth christ in your life you've got to be changed before life before christ could ever become evident in your life manifested through you you've got to be a different person than what you were when you were born amen now your skin's still on you and you still look the same but you yourself have changed you've become a new creature in christ jesus amen so as that has changed we know the element already exists in you so the precedent that we have abraham and sarah when when god waited so long because it has to be remember in god's time yes abraham can say god where are you you told me five years ago this was going to happen i'm waiting where are you god 10 years 15 years did you did i did i hear you wrong lord it's been 15 years and i still don't have it 20 years 20 years and he's still not here but the bible says even though genesis shows a little different story if you go in the new testament you find out that god records about abraham that he wavered not right it looks like in genesis he wavered if you read it and you think of it intellectually but if you read the book of acts romans i believe uh it tells you that he wavered mine right through unbelief but was strong giving praise to god to know that what was impossible was going to become possible because of the promise of god's word it seems impossible friend that we would go in a rapture it seems impossible it is absolutely illogical it's against science it's against medicine it's against anything and everything these uh uh atheists out here can prove that's fair but there's gonna be a body change yes just like abraham and sarah they had faith you say wait a minute they had faith hebrews 11. hebrews 11 8 by faith abraham when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance obeyed and he went out not knowing whether he went now is that faith or not a god he never saw heard over knew of or was not raised to worship told him to go somewhere and he said yes sir and he went i don't know where i'm going but i'm going to go anyhow right amen that's faith it was already in in abraham to know he followed it by faith he so adjourned in the land of promises in the strange country dwelling in tabernacles with isaac jacob the heirs with him with the same promise for he looked for a city whose foundations of which had foundations whose builder and maker is god faith through faith also sarah sarah herself receives strength body change because she was dead the bible tells us her mom was dead she was past the age of conceiving it was not scientifically medically possible at that time for sarah who had never bored a child to have a child right right it's just like they would say to noah it's never rained where's it gonna come from i don't know god just said so right amen her womb is dead she's an old woman how are you gonna have this child by her now i don't know but god said so amen in his time took 100 years for uh for noah 25 years for abraham god where is it 24 years later where is he but it's going to be in his time yes he said when i had child slate he should have already been here no no no no no it's going to happen the way god wants it to happen when god wants to happen amen and that's exactly and now eight and now sarah herself received strength to conceive seed and was delivered of a child when she was past age because she judged him faithful who had promised now if you go back to genesis you see when god told her or told abraham that he heard she heard it she laughed so how how could this happen how can this be god said so amen that's all that matters and when the time came and it was necessary that this child came forth the faith was there the faith was there you don't read anywhere where abraham and sarah had some great prayer meeting to make sure they had the faith to be able to conceive seed and to have a child you don't see anywhere in there oh sarah there's no way you can do it now you're you're a goner i'm an old man no it was there now if that's the type forgive me i'm closing if that's the type then where are we at today where are we at with this rapture and this rapturing faith today if that is our time some great supernatural event that happened to people so all there's got to be this great supernatural thing that will help increase our faith well friends what more do you think that could be a greater supernatural event than for all of our loved ones that have gone on to start showing up in front of us right but it's not going to be a it is it can spark a faith and i believe it will spark a faith but friend that that faith is going to be there because that word coming into your life that word coming into your heart and if you're not spending that time your that time with the word like you should then let me encourage you today yes amen spend that time with the lord spend that time in his word let that faith come let that faith build yes when you've ever when you've done that or you do that you know what i'm talking about and what it does but yet we get in here and we're in service and we're with one another and we think about the aches and pains and things going on it's well i don't have any faith at all yes you do yes you do it is there it was there when abraham and sarah needed it and it'll be there when you need it you just obey the word right it will do what it said it will do he will do what he said he would do amen praise the lord let's stand if we could this whole walk this whole walk of the lord is a is a a walk of faith it's all a walk of faith yes
