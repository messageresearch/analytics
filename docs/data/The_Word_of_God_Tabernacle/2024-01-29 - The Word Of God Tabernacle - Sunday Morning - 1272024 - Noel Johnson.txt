God bless you amen yes sister I have a request a prayer request for my my stepson is in prison and I he asked he sent a letter on the it was David the 10th I'm not sure when he sent it but um I didn't get the letter I didn't open it I didn't go in my mailbox until today I didn't go last week at the beginning so he's what and he needs he said please pray for me on January 16th and this is the 28 right and um and so I he said please fast and pray for me because I need deliverance and so I am even though it's the 16th I've learned God's time is not like our time and that I've been able to successfully ask prayers retroactive to the event because God knows the beginning amen and so I know that we can pray for him amen well the fact of his faith in writing the note to start with site brother Ram's said it's on your faith so the faith the fact that he had the faith to write that uh the Lord will honor that praise the Lord even if you weren't able to get the letter opened before then God knows and that's what matters he's asking for the Holy Ghost apparently he had a sanctifying experience before he doesn't believe he has the Holy Ghost so he's asking theost amen praise the Lord that's remember him Enoch Enoch in prayer yes you know used to be a student of ours when the school first started at well TLC school started at Tabernacle back 2001 good grief that was 23 years ago wow no wonder your kids are getting so big right and my grandkids that's wow has it been that long yes it has praise the Lord amen anyone have an unspoken request in your heart amen appreciate your prayers we had a good week um in Melbourne Florida last week um it was good trip good flights uh the Lord kept us healthy and the good weather was nice um went from 12 and 13 degrees in Albuquerque to 80 degrees in Milbert so was a little different amen but I am uh I do want to ask though I am starting my PT Tuesday for my knee so I appre pray appreciate your prayers for that amen just told the Lord I said well Lord if you're not going to if it's not going to be a miracle uh then I'm just going to trust the wisdom you give to doctors to take care of my needes so I'm supposed to go Tuesday 11:30 I appreciate you prayers for that as well so amen let's stand to our feet if we could amen we'll ask brother Den Lord Jesus we bow our hearts and heads in reverence to your Holy Spirit your presence is here this morning thank you Lord help us to recognize the day and the hour that we're living in Lord there's so much that's fighting us from illnesses to uh depression and mental disabilities and so many things father the enemy is throwing at us J and father you have given us an advocate you have given us uh armor that we have on at all times to recognize the devil in all his tricks oh Father without you we'll surely fail without you we are nothing and father help us to be humble and to be in a place like that uh Publican that went into the temple to pray he couldn't even lift up his head he says Lord forgive such sin ey amen and Lord we know you don't use the proud there's some that think well I got this ability and I got this uh um strength Lord you cannot use it oh Jesus perfect strength is made by Perfect weakness as our Prophet taught us and Lord we as that young man our sister shared that is crying out for the Holy Ghost may you go on a scene and Grant him that heart's desire and there are some here I believe that might have that same desire if there's something in our lives that we're still longing for the things of the world it's time to repent and get right with you father oh God help oh Lord you showed a prophet the bride in preview and the last part of that Vision the true bride was getting out of Step Lord that's that bride that refuses to obey your word in his fullness any little excuse they stop praying any little excuse they don't go to church any little excuse they feel that they don't have to love this one because he doesn't love them back oh Lord help us to recognize that we need to have that token UND displayed yes Lord we need to have your Holy Spirit totally in control ourselves out of the way dead to self as brother Brown said a dead man doesn't have any rights and Lord that's the only way you can work through your bride we need to die to ourselves even as we pray and present these request of different ones that need healing we know to truly reach your your throne we need to have compassion Lord as the prophet said as we live for others we look heaven in the face amen may may we truly have compassion for each and every everyone that needs a healing touch for we know that you heard the needs of your people for thou are a high priest that can be touched by the feelings of our infirm Hallelujah and with your stries we are healed and Lord I want to bring before you as we uh travel I can testify if you touch me already oh God what I've been through father Lord thank you Lord such a trial Lord but you came under s thank you Jesus Lord grant traveling mercies not only for myself for others am I needed may you uh use us to be a witness for you for father we know that there hours

I've been I've been starting a different series with the ones that are down there and here it would be a two-part um anyway I thought I'd forewarn you so if you don't like today don't bother coming back we while you're standing if you open your Bible Bibles to to John 1 read verses 1 through3 and the concentration on today's message is who just who is Jesus Christ he mentioned him about different things but but you know I've been doing some studying recently and brother B made a comment I'll get into that later but it open it broadened my it made me think in in different ways if you will so in in it says in John 1 starting at verse one it says in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God and all things were made by him without him was not anything made that was made amen and let's just pray our most gracious and loving Heavenly Father it is always our privilege to be able to come together as part of the body of Jesus Christ and then Lord to take and open up the pages of your word and read from it something which is written many years ago but Lord the revelation of what we just read is becoming greater and greater in this generation because Lord in this generation all things are to come to fulfillment amen yes so take me Lord as your servant this morning and use me and help me Lord to to express to the people through you through your anointing through your presence the different things Lord that I've been studying so Lord we might understand who we are yes Lord because lordless we understand who you are will never understand who we are yes Lord so bless us Lord through your word thank you Jesus I ask it in Jesus Christ's name amen amen you can be seated and God's power to transform he makes a statement Jesus Christ was God himself manifested because he was a Son of God because he because he was begotten but it was just a tabernacle for him to live in amen no man is seen God at any time but the only begotten of the father has declared him and this was the thing that struck out to me he said God built himself a house a body to live in to come down so we could touch him amen but we are now this Tabernacle and this is this is what anyway this this is what what brought me into thinking the way that we're doing right when we when begin to understand when we think of Jesus Christ here's a man who lived 2,000 years ago good man Prophet nice man he went about doing good he healed sick raised the dead did all kinds of nice wonderful things and then and then in the process of time he hung on a cross and he died for my sins how was 2,000 years ago okay that's nice and some people still have them 2,000 years ago sure Christmas what did they do yes oh isn't this a cute little baby oh isn't this a cute adorable little baby amen and then when he get to e oh it was so sad for him to that cute little baby to grow up and to have to hang on a cross so that I could be redeemed and that's where people put him yeah that's all it is to him but what it talks about in him was in in the beginning was the word when I think of the word I think of letters on a piece of page yeah okay I mean that that's that's just my mentality I was raised in a Baptist Church went to Assemblies of God's church and so here again trinitarian background and so when I began to read in this I began to think what was Jesus Christ the Bible says in the beginning was the word well the word when translator means the logos right and so to me the logos has an entirely different connotation when I think of the logos the logos is is is is everything that God is right manifested yeah he he was a complete expression of God he was a complete manifestation of God he was God in in every in every aspect amen and when I begin to look at them we see oh the Holy Spirit dwells in me third part of the Trinity no no the logos dwells in me amen and to me that has a different connotation absolutely because all of a sudden I begin to think of something else no it's it's it's this entity which we call God it's this eternal Supreme alls sufficient self-existing one that is what I have in me amen and that is what is leading and guiding my life it that is what I have access to because I am a son of that of that eternal spirit yes praise the Lord and so this is where my thoughts began to go and this is anyway this is this is what I began to to think about this this is where the sermons were developed so it say it's it's so God manifested himself in different forms as we go through the Bible we we go and we begin to realize God is a spirit a spirit has no form in order for that Spirit to manifest itself it has to take on a physical manifestation amen you don't see me because in me I am Spirit also sure but my body declares who I am okay you're all you also we don't see you we see the Tabernacle you dwell in amen and you because of your spirit because that's what dwells inside of you your body expresses who you are your body your body your spirit all of a sudden controls you and through and through the body that you live in all of a sudden that is where we that is how we understand who you are that is how we look upon you that is how we interact with you and and so here again we have to understand God is a spirit that spirit that Lo that Spirit formed itself Al Loos that logos came and began to begin the physical creation that physical creation God needed because God want to Fellowship his children Amen in spirit form we be one Spirit floating here and one Spirit floating here and one Spirit floating here but when we read about what brother bradam said when he went beyond the curtain of time what did he do those were real people yes their physical form the same form they had on Earth the only difference was is they no longer old and decrepit and whatever else that thing might happened no they were young again amen they were in their Prime of their life because brother B says God took a picture of you in your Prime and that's the picture that's going to come into development when we when we cross over to the other side and when we come back in glorified bodies that is the picture that'll be fully developed we will live in those bodies we will dwell in those bodies we will interact with each other in those bodies in those glorified bodies amen and I'm looking for this change yes right yes I'm getting this this one's kind of getting older and has its issues yeah but here again but but this is this is where we're coming to this is what we're going to and and and if we don't understand what Jesus Christ is if we think of him as a second person of a trinity something that lived 2,000 years ago that doesn't do me any good right if I have the a part of God as the holy SP Spirit dwelling in me but where's the other 2/3 yeah that doesn't do me any good any good either in my my my thinking when I realize it's the logos it's God himself all the very essence of everything God is that is what dwells inside of me praise the Lord and because that is what dwells inside of me somebody asked Brother Brad when all of a sudden he got Revelation to the godhead he asked well brother Brown who do I pray to do I pray you know because I used to pray to the father and I didn't want to offend the son so I prayed to him a little bit also and then every now and then I would inject the Holy Spirit and this because I you know I I didn't want any of them to get mad at me you know and all of a sudden he began to realize no God is a single entity God is God Amen so he says well who do you pray to you pray to the god that's in you amen amen because that's where God dwells amen all that God was he poured into Jesus Christ everything that was in Jesus Christ he is poured into his church amen and you look on the day of Pentecost what happened that logos came and separated itself out the pillar of fire separated itself out and began to dwell in every one of the Believers well that is what dwells in US it isn't a third person of a trinity it's God himself the very essence of everything that God is amen that is what dwells within us praise the Lord and and who is this he says so first so so he was first god Jehovah see then let's see him coming out of pH there's nothing there uh he said let's make it a little white light like a Mystic light like a Halo and that was the logos that went out of God in the beginning that was what and that was what was in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us he said in the beginning was God and then God and then out of God came the logos a part of God that went out of God yes but here have understand that when God God came and had to dwell within that thing that being that God had to come and dwell in the in the physical form that the logos was because God is a spirit when we get down a little bit further we find out what brother Bram says he says there is see like a little child playing before the door that logos was everything God was but that logos had to learn to submit to the God that was in it that it was a part of yeah well see this now comes down unto us we have to learn to submit to the god that dwells in US amen that logos dwells in us and what's he trying to do he's trying to he's trying to have the preeminence in our lives so that he can express himself through US amen yes everything God did in Jesus Christ he wants to do in you yes the only way the only limitation is the fact is we don't believe it we refuse to be acknowledge the fact that that God dwells inside of me and I I will listen to that God and and and I will allow that God to dwell in in in me and speak through me that God can do through me everything that he's wanting to accomplish amen when you look at Jesus Christ he only did as the father showed him yeah right well this is where we have to come in our lives sometimes we're going someplace and all of a sudden God inspires us and we just speak something to somebody well that happened my opinion that happens to be God speaking sure God wanted to use my voice to speak to another part of the body of Jesus Christ amen and so I was just sitting there and I opened my all of a sudden I fell that I opened my mouth and what came out I believe that was God and later on I found out well that was ministering to that lady's need sure in other times it's the same but also in your lives it isn't just ministers amen ministers have their place because God placed Ministry within the church so that God through that Ministry could minister to himself in the body yes but every one of us is equal right every one of us is the same you don't have to call your pastor to have prayer for something you do it sure we are Kings and Priests amen the same God that dwells in him dwells in you and all you have to do is allow the god that dwells in you to use you to minister to each other yes amen very true amen so brother Brown in in in in in the sermon who was God he go goes on and he says here is he says see it's just like a child playing before the door it it was the Son of God the Loos and I can see him out here and he spake and said let there be light there was nothing but there was something happened and Adam turned here and began to whirl around this way and that way he said where did where did he make it from he says I don't know there was nothing to make it from but he believed his own word yes and there came to life right the logos had to believe the God that was in it he had to believe that what the God in it was speaking through it and believe that what was coming out of his out of his mouth if that's that's part I I don't haven't seen the logos I have cou but here again but he spoke once that word went out that word's creative amen and because that word is creative he said let there be light light came yes it had to come because the God that was in the logos the God that was a part of that logos or the logos was a part of God that word which went forth it was creative and it had to come to pass it's like it says a virgin shall conceive okay I forget how many hundred of year later that word once it was spoken had to find a resting place yes it found a resting place in Mary right and so that that the word that was spoken all of a sudden it found in Mary the resting place and that created within Mary the seed which eventually would produce the body we call Jesus Christ amen in conference with god brother Bram says we got to come to the word that's the only he says and that is God in the beginning was the word the logos and the Word was with God and the Word was God and then he goes on here and he and and he goes on he say he and he said see God made man when he began to brood over the Earth up come like Easter FL flowers or upcome grass or some other species Rising higher and higher the great Holy Spirit brooding or or brooding means to to to mothering over cing he says and the flowers come up and the father said that's wonderful just keep it up and so to me it looks like there's almost for lack of a better word there was a training period for this logos to be able to manifest and to do what God intended to do through that logos yes he said the father said that's wonderful just keep it up and are brooded and after a while out come the birds and the next things come animals and finally the Earth reflected the reflection of himself that was brooding and that was God and he Adam was in the image of God and never did anything come higher than a man and man even to our beloved sisters a woman she is not in the original creation he say she's the byproduct of a man a part of him and in the same way we have to realize we as the bride of Christ we are a part of him amen I mean this is the type in the shadows when you go back and look in the Garden of Eden when Adam was created he when Adam was created male and female he was created and then God took part of God made a body for Adam to live in but but Adam was lonely so God took a part of Adam and he made another body and he led the other the other part of Adam to now come and dwell within the human body and so and so now Adam was complete yes Adam was never complete without Eve Christ is never complete without his bride because we are the other part of his body amen and we are supposed to manifest what he is yesen and he goes on to say and they are one in Christ oh yeah it's a great lesson we could go on with that and it goes on in Revelations 4:11 Thou Art Worthy of God to receive glory and honor and power for thou H has created all things and for thy pleasure they are created praise the Lord yes why did God create Satan why would he create his own enemy right if you have a business why would you hire somebody who was set out to destroy your business it's true I mean that makes no sense but God had attributes he wanted to express yes there had to be sickness so he could prove he was a Healer there there had to be there had to be things had something had to be lost in order for him to manifest himself as the Redeemer there had to be other other things that happen within the world and and the only reason they came is because of Satan right why do you get sick Satan attacks you right what does he attack he attacks your body amen what does God say I am your healer I've already he healed you I've already paid the price prise the Lord Stripes laid up right back was for your healing and if you can accept it you're healed it doesn't matter the symptoms it looks at the promise prise and the more we concentrate on the promise the more we can access that and the more we can believe and the more God will be able to do that through US Amen in Colossians 1:16 for by him were all things created that are in heaven that are on earth visible and invisible whether it be Thrones or dominions or principalities or power all things were created by Him and for him and he is before all things and by him all things consist and he's the head of the body the church who in the beginning who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence so we are we are his body he is to be the head yes the head takes you the body the body takes instructions from the head I mean when I when I walk my body has to send all the signals down and coordinate my walking and like you know and all of a sudden it decides not to then I Stumble and I fall okay the older you get the circus no longer work like they used to but anyway yeah but we have to begin to understand he is the head yes and everything is to take command from him it isn't us doing what we want right it's us obeying him amen and the more we will listen to him and the more we will obey him then the more of himself it can be expressed through US yes okay amen when we look at Jesus Christ he says I do only what the father shows me okay in fact one place he says it isn't me who does the work it's the father who dwells in me amen okay when you listening to brother Bram there's another place and I don't have the notes right in front of me but he said I was just standing there when the you know when the pillar of fire came down at the Ohio River he says I was just standing there and all of a sudden God wanted to use my voice and that's when the discernment and stuff yes and there are other times when the squirrels God says create them speak it right yeah okay so he did one and oh wow hey that's great the angel says I thought you said you needed three yes well yeah I did well where's the second one coming from okay and he said I'm going to go around here and go over there okay but I mean here again God gave him the permission to speak yes it wasn't him speaking because he wanted I mean I couldn't go out here and say I want a new Ferrari you know I don't think that would happen yeah because I don't think that's God's will right but yet there are other times and all of a sudden somebody else has a need and and so all of a sudden the anointing comes upon us and all of a sudden we pray for somebody and we give you your healing in the name of Jesus Christ amen and then God heals but here again it's God anointing it's God directing it's God using my voice to speak whatever it is he's wanting spoken amen we know that God we know that God appeared in different forms and different places in the Bible and so the voice of God was walking in the garden okay in what form I don't know but it says you know God came God God God appeared to Adam and Eve he appeared to Noah he appeared to different ones what form it doesn't tell us yeah but we know that there was a time when um when Abraham went to rescue lot and after the battle he was coming back through Jerusalem he met madc yeah melkisedek was a body form of theophany that that logos now took upon itself it cre it Formed that body called mezc and it sat there and it gave it gave um it gave Abram you know some food I think wine and bread okay but so God took on that form there but then when God was done with that formof away it went there was another time when all when God wanted to come and talk to ABRA to Abram and all of a sudden so he says you know because they were going to investigate what was going on in Sodom and Gomorrah why he had to do that I mean God's all knowing so anyway but God came and he appeared to Abram Abraham at that point in time and sat down and and that body ate it drank it it was a it was a physical form it had dust on its feet and then when when Sarah laughed it discerned what Sarah was Sarah had in her mind right and brother Brown so the way that God appeared to Abraham then is the same way that God is appearing to us now that's why the discernment that's that's why what we see in brother bram's life that was the Fulfillment of that title right amen but here again but God God appeared to Abram and there he ate and he drank and he began to tell Abraham he said you're going to have a child by Sarah okay the word became spoken yes year later all of a sudden they were they were holding holding Isaac amen okay we also know that there was a time when when uh they had invited the promised land and all of a sudden Joshua went out there and he began to overlook the city and well how do we going to do this it's nice strong wall strong Gates Strong this strong that and all of a sudden he send a presence of someone else and he pulled out a sword says who are you are you for us or for the enemy he saysi I'm the captain of the host I've come to make sure that my will is fulfilled yes I want you to do exactly what I tell you amen amen yes sir so so Joshua goes back and say everybody asked what's the plan what's the plan well we don't want to disturb the neighbors so have a nice breakfast we'll get up we kind quietly walk around the city come back have a nice lunch and rest relax um even in the sun too long well yeah we're going to do that for six days and you know but the seventh day we're going to walk around seven times then you're going to shout yes then we have the city amen but that in in in in Medic in in in military terms that's that's crazy yeah but that's what God told Joshua to do amen some of the times God tells us to do something that's crazy but that's God's will amen that's the way God wants it done sure and so as long as we obey what he wants done then it gets fulfilled what his will is and all the reason that we are our existence here is we are here to do the Willing of God we are here to be his body upon this Earth we are his hands we're his feet we're his eyes ears nose and mouth if God wants to go someplace we have to carry him because he's in US yes sometimes we'll drive because walking to Phoenix is hard you know so we drive right but I mean but here again you have to understand we carry God and then when God wants to minister to somebody he he has he wants to use his body amen because it's it's through his body that he wants to work but we have to be willing to allow him Amen in order for in order for us to be redeemed God in melkisedek could not die and redeem us because he was a theophany form yeah God and the one that appeared in Joshua could not die for us amen because he was theop for right God and the one that appeared to Moses and had Moses hide in the Rock um here again that form could not die for us because it had to become us amen he God literally had to take on the same flesh that we take on right and so God came in the form of Jesus Jesus Christ it says in what in Isaiah 9:6 For unto us as a child is born unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name Shall be Called wonderful counselor the Mighty God the Everlasting father the of peace that was that baby yes when he was born he was the son of God when he was born he was God now dwelling in a in a body of of of of a baby and that body had to grow and that body had to become stronger in sman church age brother B goes on he says he says I will give you a sign and a virgin shall be with child and the Virgin shall conceive and bear done and best bear a son and God came down in a blood cell not through a man but by the Holy Ghost and in the Virgin womb a tabernacle for the purpose of death was built the seed of the woman came in order that he that he be that he might bruise the seed of the woman came in order that he be bruised to bring us our Salvation yes the cell was created in the beginning of the creation of God and that is who Jesus is and that is what what we'll get into that but that is what Jesus Christ he's what is he what is he creating today right he's creating our bodies amen he's creating himself in US amen and this is what we have to realize Hallelujah see when that acceptable sacrifice rose out of the water God came and indwelt him fulfilling filling him with the spirit without measure okay that's when he became the Messiah yes in the exposition of the seven Church ages brother Bram goes on and says the beginning of the creation of God he said get get the people get the idea that Jesus was the first creation of God making him lower than the godhead then this first creation created all the rest of the universe and whatever it contains he says but that's not right you know that doesn't line up with the rest of the Bible amen the words are he is the beginner or the author of the creation of God yes he said now that's different that brings on a different connotation so there is no doubt that he is the creator he is the creator of a FSH physical creation yes he created the universe where did it come from out of nothing right we talk about the Big Bang all the big bang is saying out of nothing everything came that is in essence what they have no way to explain this true okay amen so out of nothing everything came okay that's fine so he goes on and go goes on brother Brown him in in in the in the seven Church ages there and Lady see him he says he calls himself the author of the creation of God this is another creation this has to do with the church this is a special designation of himself he is the creator of that church the Heavenly bridegroom created his own bride yes the Heavenly bride Jesus Jesus Christ God himself created you Amen wors in all yes he created you the way you are because that's the way he wanted you right right okay what was Jesus Christ he says it was a God man he was the son of God he was a new creation man and God met and joined he was the first of of this new race he is the head of this new race in Colossians he is the head of the body of the church he goes on now in Union with Christ he has in Union with Christ we have become this part of this new creation of God when you received the Holy when you were born you were a son or daughter of God Amen because God see God placed his seed in you before the foundations of the world when you were born that seed was in you then right in the process of time you heard the gospel what responded to that the part of God that was in you from the beginning all of a sudden God that that seed all of a sudden heard something and responded to that and that seed began to grow and began to express itself amen and then what did God do after you after you've gone through the process of accepting your salvation and then and then repenting of your sins and Desiring to have the fullness of God then God comes and dwells in you that's when you become this this new man that's when you become this God man that's when that the God man is God dwelling in human flesh yes that's what it was in Jesus Christ amen God when he was born he was the son of God but at the River Jordan God came in his fullness and dwelt in that body then he that's when he became this God man praise the lord well when you receive the Holy Spirit what do you become you become this God man you become where God himself dwells in your Tabernacle right brother R goes on this he says but now out of every Kindred tribe and Nation has purposed a new creation he was the first of that creation he was God created in the form of man now by his spirit is creating many sons unto himself God the Creator is creating himself a part of his creation yes God is recreating God is creating himself in you yes where you will become the creation of God you will become the manifestation of God himself amen praise the Lord the only thing of is you have two Natures right you have the nature you were born with that nature comes from the union of your parents you are the you express the nature of your parents right I mean there are mannerisms that I have that like my mother there other mannerisms I have that like my father why because I'm a product of their Union but now there's another Union where my real father is God yes right I was a part of God from the beginning I came into manifestation through the through the through the the birth of you know my parents but now what God is trying to do is he's trying to take my nature and I have to die out to what I am in my physical flesh yes and begin to allow the very nature of God to express itself through me amen but that means I have to die yes yes I have to die to myself not physically die and put in the grave that'll come eventually probably but I have I have to die to my own when you were baptized and you Rose up out of the water you were making a declaration I have died to myself I have desire died to my desires I have desire I have died to all the desires of My Flesh I have I have died to everything that I had pre-planned for the rest of my life amen and now what I'm doing I rising out of the water to a new life yes dedicated fully and wholly and solely to serve God Amen praise the Lord amen the only problem is we don't stay dead yeah I mean maybe you more than I have but I still fight this right amen but more and more I'm beginning to realize that Lord I am here to serve your purpose yes I here to do what you want me to do I here to minister unto others as you would guide and direct me the same with you this isn't Li Li limited to the ministry you are here to minister to each other yes you minister to each other by by just speaking a kind word by praying for them by lifting them up before God Amen and by doing the just just by fellowshipping and encouraging each other okay right yeah so he said now by his spirit is he is creating many sons unto himself God the Creator is creating himself a part of his creation he said this is the true revelation of God Amen that's you yes you are to be the true Revelation praise the Lord God is yes this was his purpose this took the this purpose took the form of through election it goes on and this is the interesting part his Sovereign power brought it to pass by his own decree he elected the members of this new creation amen he predestinated them for the adoption of children according to good pleasure of his will by his omnipotence omissions and omnipotence he brought it to pass yes amen it's not about you it's about him amen it's not about you striving to become it's about you taking and resting in him and letting him begin to mold you and make you into His Image amen it's I mean we often struggle to become what we think a Christian should be yeah Christian should be this way this way this way this way sure the only problem is our flesh ISS yeah try it but see as I rest in him and allow him having the preeminence in my life I automatically begin to manifest and do those things so I don't struggle with this anymore amen I said Lord I'm here yeah I get up in you know I made some mistakes today I'm sorry I I dwell in a clay right I dwell in something Lord that I really cannot fully control right but Lord you dwell in me and I'm taking myself and I'm allowing you as much as you can as much as you want to you use me for whatever purpose you see fit amen I remember brother brandham he told a story I think he was ministering up in Washington state and there was a young man there he was he was in the military service and he was going to commit suicide and brother Bram addressed him from the pulpit he said 'd don't do that and he talked to he talked to ministered a little bit and then anyway the next day they got in a car and I guess they were heading up into Alaska that that I think that's where they were going anyway they stopped off to have breakfast and brother Bram was just joking and kidding and being brother Bram but all of a sudden another car drove up and that boy happened to be in that other car they came into the restaurant and sat down and what I've heard he says brother bram's countenance changed and brother Bram excuse me then he went over to that young man and he ministered to him and he cast The Demon out of him amen God needed brother brandham there at that time to minister to that boy yes God orchestrated it God pre-planned it because when that boy left that they left that restaurant he he began Tobe if I remember right he says I'm free I'm free I'm free amen but see God orchestrated praise the Lord Brother Bram up until that time was brother Bram he was kidding joking laughing doing what he does sure but when God needed him yeah God took possession yes and ministered amen it's no different I mean I'm trying there's no difference here come on yes he was the prophet yes but God does is God limited to him if that if that's the case then he died how many years ago no no he's alive today amen he has a body that's us yes and he's wanting to do through us the same he did through the prophet amen you have just as much right to pray for for your neighbor and your friends and your relatives as as anybody else does that's right prayer is not limited to the ministry amen right if it is we're in bad shape right amen but you have to realize the part you play you're his body amen every one of you yes you are the body of Jesus Christ yes where does God dwell where does this logos dwell Amen in you the very essence of everything God is dwells in you right and you and he all he he he will never force you to do something that he that you will not allow him to do amen there was a time that one of our brothers in church um he had a he had surgery on his elbow surgery went about as well as the doctors could do it then he got a staff infection so they put antibiotics in it it seemed to take care of it then it came back and they irrigated and did something else and then it came back and God spoke to me he says we're not dealing with a physical problem we're dealing with a spiritual problem that's what God told me yeah he says go pray for him amen why don't you why why not the pastor why not the deacons why not the trustees why me I hate going to Charlotte traffic is terrible there if I had refused he never would have been prayed for and the infection would have taken his arm off but okay all right okay Lord I'll go I'll go amen went up there we visited a little bit and he said why are you here here I said God told me to come pray for you I said we're dealing with a spiritual problem not a physical amen so I cast The Demon out which was the infection and uh yeah then it was healed praise the Lord amen amen that doesn't make me anything right amen okay I didn't want to go but God impressed upon me this I need you to go amen you know Moses didn't want to go back to Egypt right he said well you choose somebody else he said I can't speak it very good anymore and there want I'm wanted for murder there and I got all these reasons why I cannot going I got a wife and I got kids and I got all these goats I got to take care of and God says you're going I don't have I don't have plan B your plan a plan a is the only plan I have right so he finally went you look at Jeremiah Jeremiah wanted to quit Lord you didn't tell me the problems I was going to have everybody hates me I like people but everybody hates me I'm not going to preach anymore I'm going to shut my mouth I'm going to go hide all of a sudden God says and and all of a sudden the spirit of God the word of God was in him like burning in the bones yeah he says I have no options I have to say what God gives me to say amen he wanted to quit that's right you talk to most ministers um after a while they yeah I like to preach but I sure don't like to be Pastor because I got all these problems anyway at least that's what others have said so but you have to realize God is God needs us to do what God wants us to do amen but you have to be willing to do as he directs yes this requires a relationship amen you have to know him amen you have to talk to him you have to interact with him so that he can tell you what what he's wanting for you to do amen it says in Hebrews 2:14 it says for as much that as the children were partakers of Flesh and Blood he also himself likewise took part of the saints that through death he might destroy him that had power of death that is the devil and deliver them who through their fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage for verily he took not in him the nature of angels but he took upon him the Seed of Abraham yes therefore in all things it behooved him to be made like unto his Brethren that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest and things pertain to God to make reconciliation for the sins of the people praise the Lord am he's our high priest yes because he suffered like we suffered amen he was born just like we were born he was a little bitty baby just like we were at one point in time and as he had to go through the teenage years with all the changes in the hormones and all the other things that affect you as you go through that process amen he had the same Temptations we have right he had the same problems in essence we have yes but because of the nature of God there was in him he was able to overcome those things yes Jesus Christ had to be born under the law so that the law that God had given through Moses would apply to him if he had been born in in Syria he' BN in some other place their laws of of of redemption would not have applied the same but he came to redeem he came to restore us back to what we were with God from the beginning amen amen because it says it was well it talks about in in in Leviticus 25 it talks about the near kinman coming in redeeming and once the Redeemer came and paid the price the one who was redeemed could go back to his belong back to his land he could go back to his house he could go back to his family everything was restored as if he had never if he had never sold himself into slavery right amen you see that's where we're going that's where we're we are going back to what we were in God before the fall amen we are being restored back to the Garden of Eden again we are being restored back to what we were in God before there was a fall before there was sin before there was any imperfection prise this is where we are being taken back to because this is what restoration means yes brother Bram says in possessing the Gate of the enemy he says he says now but when Jesus the son of God was virgin born shed his blood the life that was in the blood was God's itself he goes on he says God created both the egg and the blood cell and that was the tabernacle of God okay and he says we are saved by the blood of God that's where my faith is yes not walk out there in the blood of a prophet not walk out there in the blood of an ordinary man or a teacher or a theologian we walk out there in the blood of God God said so he become human being he changed his stand he he stretched his tent here with us and he became one of us he is our kinsman redeemer he had to become a Kinfolk to us because that was what because that was the law God became man and dwelt Among Us amen then in Galatians 4 it says but when the fullness of time was come God sent forth a son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons praise the Lord yes if we had not been redeemed we could never be restored as Sons and Daughters amen but by being redeemed we can go back to being what God intended for us to be from the beginning amen we can go back to being Sons and Daughters of God and actually that applies to us now yes yes but we're not willing to accept it true we're not willing to believe what we are in Christ it's not what we are by ourselves because by ourselves we're nothing amen okay by ourselves we're failures by ourselves you know we're just rotten old human flesh walking around on two feet until eventually they stick in the grave and it rots yeah that that that's what that's what this flesh is right but because we were a part of him from the beginning yes that's the difference we're being restored back as his son and daughter and and if we can and and what brother Brown said in one place he says when the bride begins to realize who and what she is she'll do the Greater Works amen right but we pull back from that because we we we begin to understand if I am restored back to as a son and daughter of God that means everything that God is I have access to yes right that's the power that dwells in each one of us amen and then we think about about that he says uhuh we don't believe it we're not willing to accept it until you can accept who you are amen God cannot fully fulfill yes okay amen SM in church AG he says now then we're coming to a conclusion as the Eternal logos God was manifested in the son in Jesus Christ all the fullness of the godhead bod and that Eternal one was the was was the father manifested in the flesh and thereby gained the title son so he's taking Jesus Christ making him deity making him to be all powerful amen he says then he goes on even so we he's taking us and equating us with the same manifestation the same with go with Jesus Christ even as we even as he was in the mind of God so we were in the mind of God even as even as that logos that God created we were in that Loos amen even even and then then we we were born we were we put into flesh yes even in the same way that God came in Jesus Christ now God is coming in us okay he goes on because see even so we Eternal in his thoughts in our turn became the many membered spoken word say manifested in flesh and and those Eternal thoughts now manifest in flesh are the sons of God even as we are soall Hallelujah yes we did not become seed by the rebirth right we were seed and therefore we're reborn only the elect can be reborn amen because we were seed is the reason we can be quickened yes in nonseed there's nothing to Quicken yes why isn't you go out and witness to somebody and they have no interest right there's nothing in there yeah I mean I mean we witness to people and I have no interest I like living in sin I like my drugs I like I like doing the things I like living in the darkness that I live in I like living in My Flesh and satisfying My Flesh and doing the things of my I'm not interested in Christianity yeah I become a Christian I have to give up all this stuff right not interested amen fine I'm not going to waste my time anymore you know but then you talk to somebody else hey that's interesting tell me more then you start the process okay amen he said hold this carefully in mind now take the next step redeem means to buy back it restores to the original owner God by his death the shed blood brought back his own you always were a sheep you never were a pig or a dog Tado sheep that's impossible for every kind of Life produces the same kind and there is no change in species amen as we were in the thoughts of God and then expressed in flesh there had to come a day when we would hear his voice the word and hearing that voice become aware of our father calling us and recognizing us we go in another section concerning Jesus Christ Our Lord which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh yeah he had to come in that lineage to be eligible to take the throne if he was not born in that lineage of David he would have no rights to the throne of David right okay and and the thing that we find when when you begin to look at the events surrounding his birth the people were expecting the kingh they weren't expecting a redeemer they were expecting the king yeah as we go and we look at Mary in Luke in Luke 1 and what 32 and he he shall be great he shall be called the son of the highest and the Lord God shall give unto him the Throne of his father David and he shall reign over the House of David forever and his kingdom there shall be nowh yes that's what they were looking for amen and Zach is zachar yeah okay he goes on his prayer talking about talking about about John the Baptist that we should be saved from our enemies and from the hand of all that hate us to perform the mercy promise to our father and to and remember His Holy Covenant the oath which God swear to Our Father Abraham that he would Grant unto us that we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies might serve him without fear in Hol and righteousness before him all the days of our life and thou child shall be called the prophet of the highest and thou shalt go before him to prepare the way for the Lord amen they were expecting a king yeah yes they weren't expecting the way he came right but we go on and and and John the John the Baptist became very um disillusioned when he saw you know when Jesus Christ he wasn't behaving like a king yeah he's just a humble little man going around doing good things he sent two of his disciples and said to Jesus are they he that should come or should we be looking for another one yeah when the men were come to him and said John the Baptist sent us okay we look for another one in that same hour he cured many of their infirmities and BLS evil spirits and to many that were blind he gave sight Jesus answering said go go your way and tell John the things that ye have heard seen and heard the blind see the lame walk rers are cleansed the deaf here the dead are raised and the poor the gospel is preached unto them amen but this isn't what they were expecting because in Luke the 4th chapter he he Jesus Christ he says he came to Nazareth where he had been brought up and as his custom was he went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day and he stood up for to read There was delivered into him the book of the prophet Isaiah and when he had opened the book he found the place where it was written he he said the spirit of the Lord is upon me because he has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach Deliverance of the captives recovering the sight of the blindness that Liberty them that are Bru and to preach the acceptable year of the Lord amen he handed the book back and he sat down this day this scripture is what is being fulfilled praise the Lord amen he came to redeem he came to defeat Satan yes he came to pay the price for our Redemption yes that is why he came and the last of the verse in in Isaiah 61 and two he says you know that that'll be fulfilled the second coming that's when he will come as as that's when he will come to sit upon the throne we have to realize we are a continuation of the anointing that was on Jesus Christ amen amen it isn't for us to go and make big names for ourselves Jesus Christ was the humblest thing you ever person you want to see yeah he went about Healing The Sick raising the dead casting out de demons he went about ministering to this one and ministering to the needs of that one he went about doing good to everybody that he ever came in contact with that is the anointing that was on him to fulfill that scripture amen that scripture is to be f is the continuation of that is to be fulfilled now through us right that is our commission that is what we are to be doing we are also to be going about preaching the gospel yeah you don't have to do it in words you can do it in your life amen we go about somebody is Si fine you pray for them right God will heal them through your prayers as well as anybody else's amen believe it amen it goes about somebody has a demon you cast it out the power lies within you yes okay but see we have when you look at the book of Acts what were they doing the book of Acts is a continuation of the ministry of Jesus Christ yes amen what did God do in our generation he came in a prophet he began to demonstrate unto us this is what Jesus Christ is this is the nature of Jesus Christ amen this is what God sent me what to show you Jesus Christ he came to declare who the father is because the father declared himself through the life and the Ministry of that Prophet brother Brandon was not Jesus Christ no he was a sinner just like we are amen right but he over period of his own life he began to learn how to yield himself to the spirit of God that dwelt in him and the more he was able to yield himself to the spirit of God that was in him the more that God could take and manifest himself through him amen and see that's where it comes out into Us Praise the Lord the more we can learn to yield ourselves our bodies into the god that dwells in us the more that that God can be able to manifest and express himself through US amen Brown says God wanted to accomplish three things he the once he needed total preeminence in amen that means total control yes he said he did that in Jesus Christ now he needs the same preeminence in his body the bride yes right then we will be restored Back to Eden and that's where the bride has to come amen we have to come to the place that we are willing to totally to yield our bodies to the god that dwells in us right he will not override our self-will amen you have brother B said you have to will yes to do the will of God so he will impress on you to do something you can say no I'm too busy today go bother somebody else yeah but I mean here again but we have we have to learn to we have to learn to listen to the spirit of God that dwells in US amen we have to be sensitive to the leadership of God in each and every one of us yes because God is wanting to use you in the same way that he did Jesus Christ the same way he did Brother Ram the same way he has done any all of the body of Jesus Christ down through time amen true you have to be willing to allow the spirit of God that dwells in you to have the preeminence so that God can express himself through you the same way he did in Jesus Christ amen God bless you right amen praise the Lord I believe that's a message for the day amen something that we can live by live to look for

prophet in a few minutes she's going to be there and brother bram's going to pray for her go pray for that woman but Lord I you know I don't know what's wrong with her and you know and what better

good amen any any I just love the pure gospel amen I love the pure gospel and you know me that just a minister just come and preach the pure gospel and don't feel like they have to impress somebody

hire so uh if you have something for brother null the Lord puts on your heart put in the Box amen we'll make sure every bit of it goes for brother null and uh be a an extension of the ministry that he has to those people in India of course and of course wherever the Lord sends him but we know he's had that Ministry to India for years and we tried to support it the best as possible and just good to hear that he's continuing that even though they're not necessarily physically going as much as they were uh that they're able still to minister to those people amen so the seed's been swn and just continue to water it and the technology the Lord has invented to be able to do it on computers and whatever and uh the Lord just bless you richly in it brother all so give us unto the Lord if you can
