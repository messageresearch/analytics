[39:19] amen thank you jesus we have a couple of
[39:23] prayer requests to mention to you today
[39:28] god amen
[39:30] sister sherida had texted me a little
[39:32] earlier
[39:33] and said that alice was up most of the
[39:35] night not feeling well she threw up said
[39:38] she's doing better this morning
[39:40] but
[39:41] they were going to stay home and uh
[39:43] alice gets thinking about it
[39:45] alice is going to get some rest
[39:47] uh
[39:48] make sure all is well with healing there
[39:50] so
[39:51] let's just continue to remember them in
[39:53] prayer if we could
[39:54] uh sister alice
[39:56] also sister julie had texted me
[39:59] and uh
[40:00] she said that uh
[40:02] she had a really bad headache this
[40:03] morning when she woke up she's been
[40:06] uh not feeling well and throwing up so
[40:09] it's remember sister julian prayer this
[40:11] morning as well the lord would just
[40:12] touch her also
[40:14] she has to request a prayer for a
[40:15] co-worker first named greg
[40:18] he texted her and said he really needed
[40:20] a touch from the lord didn't say whether
[40:23] spiritual physical
[40:26] financial i don't know but
[40:28] greg had enough confidence in julie
[40:30] having enough confidence in us that we
[40:32] would bring him before the lord
[40:34] and that god would just move on his
[40:36] behalf and touch him and the situation
[40:38] in his life this morning and also her of
[40:41] course remember her and prayer is not
[40:43] feeling well
[40:44] amen
[40:45] brother danny wrote out a request here
[40:47] says please pray
[40:49] for the people of
[40:50] ukraine thank you again buddy
[40:53] uh pray for the people of ukraine they
[40:55] are one of the bravest people on earth
[40:57] russia is a lot more powerful
[40:59] uh than ukraine has it outmanned and
[41:02] they are willing to
[41:04] die for their country that's the truth
[41:05] brother
[41:07] and uh
[41:08] zielinski that president he is set right
[41:10] there yeah amen
[41:12] even though
[41:13] putin's threatening to come and cut his
[41:14] head off he's staying right there i'll
[41:16] tell you it's
[41:17] a lot different than
[41:19] the ukrainian situation
[41:21] they they hit the hills but uh you're
[41:24] right brother they're very brave people
[41:26] as bombs were following a group of
[41:28] ukrainians huddled by a big rock started
[41:30] praying
[41:31] uh we never give up hope that is the
[41:33] truth amen there are believers i believe
[41:35] voice of god
[41:36] has put out
[41:38] memos about the believers that are over
[41:40] in ukraine and i'm sure there's probably
[41:42] believers in russia
[41:45] that that will be adversely affected by
[41:47] what's going on as well so
[41:49] let's just remember them in prayer if
[41:51] the lord would just touch them
[41:53] and continue to keep their hand
[41:55] his hand on them amen we all need it
[41:58] don't we
[41:59] amen i mean
[42:01] they feel the immediate effects of it
[42:03] friend but this will reverberate around
[42:05] the world
[42:06] uh this will have this not only in
[42:08] europe and uh but all around the world
[42:10] this this will reverberate around the
[42:13] world i think it already has begun but
[42:16] you know
[42:17] uh remember what brother branham said
[42:19] remember what god said
[42:21] god showed brother branham that was one
[42:23] of the political visions that god had
[42:25] gave brother branham watch russia
[42:27] watch russia yes watch russia amen at
[42:30] that time russia was the soviet union it
[42:33] wasn't even russia right
[42:35] but notice now today it is named russia
[42:38] yes and that voice that prophecy that
[42:40] god prophecy watch russia yes watch
[42:43] russia so we know amen
[42:46] we can't lose vision of that saints

[42:58] all the disturbance everything that's
[43:00] happening when they go down to get that
[43:01] oil

[43:05] uh brother dennis is this a um
[43:07] is this a testimony this is a testament

[48:42] the stairs my feet went out from under
[48:44] me as i hid the tall floor
[48:46] i landed uh and i landed face first but
[48:49] my face did not hit the floor because i
[48:51] landed on my right shoulder and arm
[48:54] and i thought i had even broken my arm
[48:56] but praise the lord the impact was so
[48:58] hard i just badly bruised myself
[49:01] no serious injuries and today it's still
[49:03] sore but i can now slowly raise my arm
[49:06] and feel the pain is gradually
[49:07] diminishing knowing god does watch and
[49:10] take care of his own
[49:11] amen praise the lord jesus a little bit
[49:14] different brother dennis than when maybe

[51:29] i really enjoyed hearing so much of the
[51:32] family get up and talk about their dad
[51:34] and their brother and
[51:36] uh
[51:37] it spoke a lot to me about the charlie i

[51:43] of man that he was

[59:19] something that we're not god this is a
[59:22] serious hour that we're living lord this

[1:00:48] all that is said and done here today yes
[1:00:50] for it is in is uh in your precious name

[1:01:08] you and we thank you for it now in the
[1:01:10] name of the lord jesus christ we pray
[1:01:12] amen amen amen hebrews chapter 10
[1:01:16] we'll begin reading with verse 25
[1:01:19] in hebrews 10 verse 25 not forsaking the
[1:01:22] assembling of ourselves together as the
[1:01:23] manner of some is but exhorting one
[1:01:26] another and so much more as you see that
[1:01:28] they're approaching and boy don't we
[1:01:31] for if we sin willfully after that we
[1:01:33] have received the knowledge of the truth
[1:01:36] there remaineth no more sacrifice for
[1:01:38] sins
[1:01:40] but a certain fearful looking for a
[1:01:42] judgment of fiery indignation which
[1:01:45] shall devire devour the adversaries you
[1:01:49] can be seated if you like
[1:01:52] amen
[1:01:53] i want to talk about uh entitled this
[1:01:55] today
[1:01:56] uh something the lord had put on my
[1:01:58] heart a couple of weeks ago called
[1:02:00] misinformation
[1:02:02] uh misinformation i guess for lack of
[1:02:04] any other title uh that's just what i
[1:02:07] want to call this today misinformation
[1:02:09] because it's it's going around it's
[1:02:10] around the country especially and it
[1:02:13] seems like that everybody today wants to
[1:02:15] be the arbiters of truth
[1:02:17] everybody wants to be the ones to be the
[1:02:20] ones that are listened to the ones that
[1:02:22] are believed the ones that say that they
[1:02:24] are the ones spewing and spouting the
[1:02:26] truth
[1:02:27] everybody thinks that they know what the
[1:02:29] truth is
[1:02:30] everybody thinks that they have the
[1:02:32] truth when in reality the only ones that
[1:02:35] truly have and know the truth is the
[1:02:37] christian
[1:02:38] amen is the true holy ghost born again
[1:02:41] filled christian amen those are the ones
[1:02:44] because they realize what the truth is
[1:02:47] and others they think they have truth
[1:02:49] and they want to let you know that
[1:02:51] everything else that you're hearing
[1:02:53] other than what they're saying is
[1:02:55] misinformation oh it's it's
[1:02:57] misinformation what is misinformation
[1:03:04] and see what it really break it down
[1:03:06] what really is misinformation well if
[1:03:09] you look up in the dictionary
[1:03:10] misinformation is classified as this
[1:03:13] false or inaccurate information well
[1:03:16] that's kind of a given right false or
[1:03:18] inaccurate information
[1:03:21] but where does that information derive
[1:03:23] from
[1:03:24] again who has taken it upon themselves
[1:03:28] to become the arbiters of what truth is
[1:03:31] or what misinformation is who has given
[1:03:34] that person who has given that
[1:03:36] organization who has given that news
[1:03:40] organization or that politician or that
[1:03:42] banker or that who has given these
[1:03:44] people the right to become the arbiters
[1:03:48] of what truth is right how do they know
[1:03:51] what misinformation is maybe they're
[1:03:54] misinformed
[1:03:55] maybe they misunderstood but yet they
[1:03:58] people presented as though this is the
[1:04:01] absolute fact and truth and anything
[1:04:04] else other than what i'm telling you is
[1:04:07] wrong
[1:04:08] it's misinformation
[1:04:11] who died and made them the boss
[1:04:14] i mean that's that's the thing i've
[1:04:15] heard for many years who died and made
[1:04:17] them the arbiters
[1:04:19] who's the one that that relinquished
[1:04:22] what real truth is over to their hands
[1:04:26] that they can stand forth and say listen
[1:04:28] to us and everything else is lies
[1:04:32] who'll give them that authority
[1:04:34] who'd get who had put them in that
[1:04:36] position
[1:04:38] nobody that i know of except themselves
[1:04:41] because they have a microphone or a
[1:04:42] camera or some way that they can spew
[1:04:45] whatever they want to to the world
[1:04:48] amen
[1:04:49] the only way that they the only way it's
[1:04:51] like brother rogers said last week the
[1:04:54] only power the devil has is what we give
[1:04:57] him right he has no power whatsoever
[1:05:00] he's very deceiving and deceptive and
[1:05:03] beguiling but he has no power at all
[1:05:06] only power he has is what you relinquish
[1:05:09] to it
[1:05:10] well the only power any of these people
[1:05:12] have to try to get before you and say
[1:05:15] that they're the arbiters of truth is
[1:05:17] the power that you give them right it's
[1:05:20] the power that people give them if you
[1:05:22] give them that power they will use that
[1:05:25] to bring
[1:05:27] misinformation you say how do you know
[1:05:29] it's misinformation because if it's not
[1:05:31] according to this
[1:05:33] it's misinformation
[1:05:35] amen
[1:05:36] the second part of the definition of
[1:05:38] misinformation is
[1:05:40] false or inaccurate information
[1:05:42] especially
[1:05:44] especially that which is meant to
[1:05:47] deliberately deceive
[1:05:50] now
[1:05:51] that got my attention
[1:05:53] because that you can look at it and say
[1:05:55] who is the deceiver
[1:05:57] amen who is the deceiver the deceiver is
[1:06:00] not the president the deceiver is not
[1:06:02] the news organization the deceiver is
[1:06:04] not the the minister of the spouting
[1:06:06] misinformation the deceiver is satan
[1:06:10] satan's the deceiver now he has all of
[1:06:13] these outlets that he's able to use to
[1:06:16] spew his misinformation
[1:06:18] but satan is the one that is out to
[1:06:21] deliberately deceive
[1:06:24] just like he did in the garden of eden
[1:06:26] where did misinformation start in the
[1:06:29] garden of eden that's right
[1:06:30] when he told her
[1:06:32] 99 of the truth
[1:06:35] that was all true what he told her oh
[1:06:37] yeah that you shall become gods you
[1:06:39] shall no good for me well you shall know
[1:06:41] he was absolutely right
[1:06:44] but he changed one word from what god's
[1:06:47] word says
[1:06:48] one word
[1:06:50] that one word changed every bit of the
[1:06:52] tone of what he was saying and brought
[1:06:54] it into a misinformation to deliberately
[1:06:58] deceive
[1:06:59] deliberately deceived and to understand
[1:07:02] that's exactly the motive that satan has
[1:07:05] today
[1:07:06] the same motive he had in the garden of
[1:07:08] eden is the same motive he has for this
[1:07:10] world for this country and for you if
[1:07:13] you'll listen to it
[1:07:16] he wants to bring misinformation in your
[1:07:18] life yes people say oh i've heard from
[1:07:20] god have you
[1:07:22] does it match this
[1:07:24] does it match this because this matches
[1:07:27] this this is the message
[1:07:29] this matches this if it doesn't match
[1:07:31] this
[1:07:32] i'm afraid we got a problem
[1:07:35] misinformation
[1:07:36] it's not it
[1:07:38] sometimes people do things like that and
[1:07:41] they and they bring it forth and it's
[1:07:43] not necessarily meant to deliberately
[1:07:45] deceive
[1:07:47] but the person the one who is sent forth
[1:07:50] to try to deliberately deceive you is
[1:07:53] the devil right
[1:07:54] and he'll use all kind of means to do it
[1:07:57] like i said he'll use people of
[1:07:59] authority he'll use churches
[1:08:02] he'll use people to claim that they have
[1:08:04] certain gifts he'll use
[1:08:06] governments he'll use presidents he'll
[1:08:09] use anything right down to even 99 of
[1:08:12] the truth to try to deceive you
[1:08:16] that's inside the deceptions exactly
[1:08:17] what he's shooting for because deception
[1:08:19] will get you off the path that you
[1:08:21] should be on deception will get you away
[1:08:24] from the word because the word is a
[1:08:26] straight narrow path
[1:08:28] deception takes you off of that path and
[1:08:31] if you can if you go off of that path
[1:08:33] you have to come back where you got off
[1:08:36] or you're going to continue to be
[1:08:37] deceived right and that deception is
[1:08:40] going to lead you into the darkness that
[1:08:42] is against the word it may look like
[1:08:44] something that you've twisted that
[1:08:46] brother branham said or that the the
[1:08:48] bible says
[1:08:49] but it really is something that's off of
[1:08:52] the the spirit and the of the letter of
[1:08:55] the word
[1:08:56] to bring misinformation to deliberately
[1:08:59] deceive
[1:09:00] to get you away from the word because he
[1:09:02] knows that you and the word are becoming
[1:09:05] one
[1:09:06] he's no match for that
[1:09:08] he's no match for you he's no match for
[1:09:11] the word amen
[1:09:13] your mere presence should absolutely
[1:09:16] shudder the devil
[1:09:18] every one of his minion demons your mere
[1:09:21] presence should call the devil to knock
[1:09:23] on his knees so hardy bruise them right
[1:09:26] now obviously physical application but
[1:09:29] you understand what i'm saying yes your
[1:09:31] presence just because of you being the
[1:09:34] word yes the misinformation is to take
[1:09:37] you away from that look what about look
[1:09:40] what it says in revelation here
[1:09:42] revelation chapter 22 verse 18.
[1:09:50] revelation 22 18
[1:09:52] for i testify unto every man that
[1:09:54] heareth the words of the prophecy of
[1:09:56] this book
[1:09:58] if any man
[1:10:01] anybody doesn't matter who it is
[1:10:03] i don't care how who they claim to be
[1:10:05] i don't care how long they've been
[1:10:07] preaching i don't care what kind of gift
[1:10:09] they claim to have i don't care how big
[1:10:11] their church is i don't care how much
[1:10:13] they can talk and speak and great
[1:10:15] orchards and
[1:10:17] claim to come then have the lld's and
[1:10:19] the degrees and i don't care if they've
[1:10:21] been ascended to the highest
[1:10:23] realms of the
[1:10:25] power in the world or it doesn't matter
[1:10:28] any man
[1:10:30] any man
[1:10:32] shall add unto these things
[1:10:35] god shall add unto him the plagues that
[1:10:37] are written in this book and if any man
[1:10:40] shall take away from the words of this
[1:10:42] book of this prophecy god shall take
[1:10:45] away his part out of the book of life
[1:10:47] and out of the holy city and from the
[1:10:49] things which are written in this book
[1:10:52] so what is god telling us the
[1:10:54] seriousness of this situation the
[1:10:56] seriousness of this misinformation the
[1:10:59] position
[1:11:01] of taking of becoming an arbiter of what
[1:11:04] truth is
[1:11:06] one word
[1:11:08] one word added one word subtracted
[1:11:12] you see the
[1:11:14] the judgment that befalls somebody that
[1:11:16] tries to become that arbiter
[1:11:20] leading people astray one word
[1:11:23] well it's not
[1:11:25] rocket science does we know what
[1:11:27] happened in the big art and the garden
[1:11:28] of eden in the beginning
[1:11:30] that's exactly the way his tactics were
[1:11:32] then he hasn't changed his tactics he's
[1:11:34] the same devil today
[1:11:35] he does the same way today exactly this
[1:11:38] evening now he's been coming along with
[1:11:41] more cunning and crafting and trying to
[1:11:43] deceive more but one word that's all it
[1:11:46] takes one word any added any subtracted
[1:11:50] so what is that where does that put us
[1:11:53] if we're not speaking the word then what
[1:11:55] are we speaking right
[1:11:58] if it's not the word then what is it
[1:12:02] it's misinformation if you want to be an
[1:12:04] arbiter of truth then that truth is
[1:12:07] going to derive from this scripture
[1:12:10] that's what truth is yes anything
[1:12:12] outside of that is not true
[1:12:15] because look friend
[1:12:16] truth
[1:12:18] let's just go back to let's just go back
[1:12:20] to the garden of eden why don't we do
[1:12:21] that in genesis chapter four
[1:12:28] genesis chapter four
[1:12:31] adding subtracting
[1:12:33] self-appointed arbiters
[1:12:36] an arbiter now is
[1:12:39] something of ultimate authority
[1:12:42] someone who claims to
[1:12:44] or feels like they have ascended to the
[1:12:46] point of being the ultimate authority
[1:12:50] the ultimate authority it's amazing how
[1:12:52] everybody seems to have the ultimate
[1:12:54] authority on everything of course
[1:12:56] everybody tries today to point to
[1:12:58] science and reason and medicine and all
[1:13:00] that when we know that how we know they
[1:13:03] themselves will even admit how quickly
[1:13:05] science and medicine changes
[1:13:08] because they gain more knowledge and as
[1:13:11] they gain more knowledge things change
[1:13:14] and as things change what was a couple
[1:13:16] of weeks ago isn't today
[1:13:19] but yet over here they claim to be the
[1:13:22] arbiters of truth
[1:13:24] we have exactly what you need well two
[1:13:26] weeks later they find out well
[1:13:28] that might not have been exactly what
[1:13:29] you needed
[1:13:31] why because they're not the arbiters of
[1:13:33] you yes
[1:13:34] the arbiter of truth says by my stripes
[1:13:36] you're healed that's arbitrary truth
[1:13:38] that that is true
[1:13:41] nobody can dispute that that is a fact
[1:13:44] now if people want to try to come and
[1:13:47] and
[1:13:47] and make it something that it's not well
[1:13:50] then that becomes misinformation
[1:13:52] all it takes is one word add it or
[1:13:55] subtract it and that becomes
[1:13:56] misinformation
[1:13:58] because that's not the truth the truth
[1:13:59] is in contained in this word
[1:14:02] now look uh genesis chapter four
[1:14:06] so there is no there is only one
[1:14:08] ultimate authority yes we know that yes
[1:14:11] there's only one ultimate authority and
[1:14:13] we know it's not the news we know it's
[1:14:15] not the government we know it's not
[1:14:18] it's not any of us
[1:14:20] amen there's only one truth praise the
[1:14:23] lord
[1:14:25] genesis chapter 4.
[1:14:28] let's begin with verse 1.
[1:14:30] and adam knew eve his wife and she
[1:14:33] conceived and
[1:14:35] bear cain and said i have gotten a man
[1:14:36] from the lord
[1:14:38] and she again bear his brother abel and
[1:14:40] abel was the keeper of the sheep but
[1:14:42] cain was the tiller of the ground and in
[1:14:44] process of time it came to pass that
[1:14:47] cain brought of the fruit of the ground
[1:14:49] an offering unto the lord and abel he
[1:14:52] also brought up the first things of his
[1:14:54] flock and of the fact thereof and the
[1:14:56] lord had respect unto abel and to his
[1:14:58] offering but unto canaan to his offering
[1:15:01] he had not respect
[1:15:03] and cain was very wrong and his
[1:15:06] countenance fell
[1:15:07] the lord said unto cain why art thou
[1:15:10] wrote and why is thou countenance
[1:15:11] followed if thou doest well
[1:15:14] shalt thou not be accepted
[1:15:17] my mind
[1:15:19] talking to the serpent seed himself
[1:15:21] giving him a space to repent
[1:15:25] giving the very serpent seed
[1:15:27] the opportunity to repent right now you
[1:15:31] want to talk about the grace of god
[1:15:32] friend
[1:15:33] and that there is no greater grace of
[1:15:35] god than god going to the devil himself
[1:15:37] and saying if you'll just do right i'll
[1:15:39] accept you right
[1:15:42] wow
[1:15:43] if people want to try to take god's
[1:15:45] grace and make a disgrace out of it
[1:15:47] oh lord help us
[1:15:49] god is telling you if thou shalt
[1:15:52] do well thou shalt thou not be accepted
[1:15:55] and if thou doest not well senteth lie
[1:15:57] that the door and unto thee shall his
[1:15:59] desire and thou shalt rule over him be
[1:16:02] his desire rule over him
[1:16:05] what is that grace of god telling us
[1:16:08] that grace of god is telling us that it
[1:16:10] extends as far as anybody will receive
[1:16:13] it right
[1:16:14] as long as it's received and accepted
[1:16:17] for the condition for the purpose god
[1:16:20] gives it forth not just to live any kind
[1:16:23] of life and be any kind of thing and do
[1:16:25] whatever you want and the grace of god
[1:16:26] will cover it no no no no to receive it
[1:16:29] as it's given to us in the word
[1:16:32] as god has given it it'll extend to
[1:16:34] anybody that's willing to receive it
[1:16:37] right brother branham said if satan will
[1:16:38] come through the blood and be your
[1:16:40] brother yes but he can't he won't he
[1:16:43] refuses to
[1:16:44] which takes us back to our first
[1:16:46] scripture he refuses to he knows what is
[1:16:49] right now look at cain here
[1:16:52] cain a derivative of that seed
[1:16:55] the first child unbelief the first the
[1:16:57] sin that came in and infiltrated in the
[1:17:00] garden of eden cain was that one who
[1:17:04] felt like he now became the arbiter of
[1:17:07] truth now you know my story
[1:17:10] my story scripturally
[1:17:12] when cain and abel were born they were
[1:17:14] twins
[1:17:16] one of the serpent one of adam
[1:17:18] and when they came forth i believe
[1:17:21] that adam being the son of god
[1:17:25] adam took his sons and treated them
[1:17:28] i i would think out of respect the same
[1:17:31] as i would do my son
[1:17:33] my children
[1:17:35] take them to the garden of eden
[1:17:37] show them all the things god did
[1:17:40] show the animals and
[1:17:43] abel this this fellow over here he's a
[1:17:45] lion
[1:17:47] i named him a lion because he's always
[1:17:49] lying around no i don't know my name
[1:17:51] but he landed he named him that for a
[1:17:53] reason could be i don't know but he
[1:17:55] named it that i named it because so and
[1:17:57] so see this giraffe look at his neck see
[1:18:00] this king and he's talking i believe
[1:18:03] these are his sons he's talking he's
[1:18:05] taking them around he's showing them the
[1:18:07] garden of eden he's still the fruit
[1:18:09] trees and you know god told us that we
[1:18:11] could do this and not this and you know
[1:18:13] all that all that uh all that a man do
[1:18:15] with his sons
[1:18:17] all that all that a man would teach his
[1:18:19] sons
[1:18:20] and i believe that that he told him
[1:18:22] about the fall
[1:18:24] and what had happened and what caused
[1:18:25] the fall
[1:18:27] and and the only way
[1:18:29] that him and their mother were able to
[1:18:32] come back out into the presence of god
[1:18:34] again
[1:18:35] albeit not the same way that they did
[1:18:37] before
[1:18:38] but at least in that in in that presence
[1:18:42] again was it god himself
[1:18:45] took the sheep
[1:18:47] and he slew the sheep and he took the
[1:18:48] bloody sheepskin and threw them in for
[1:18:50] adam and eve to come out and be able to
[1:18:52] come into his presence again not the
[1:18:54] same way as it was because they were
[1:18:56] separated at that time that fellowship
[1:18:58] could never be the same again
[1:19:00] not at that time not till jesus came
[1:19:02] could not be the same again but that
[1:19:05] bloody sheepskin is what was acceptable
[1:19:08] to god because god's the one that did it
[1:19:10] right adam didn't do it
[1:19:13] he didn't do it
[1:19:14] god did it right it was god's decision
[1:19:17] that it took blood
[1:19:19] the life of an innocent one to allow the
[1:19:23] the sinner to come back into god's
[1:19:25] presence again
[1:19:27] don't you think adam relayed that to his
[1:19:29] sons don't you think or to cain and abel
[1:19:31] don't you think he told them
[1:19:33] let them know i know i'm adding to the
[1:19:35] word but just paraphrase a little bit
[1:19:37] dramatizing i i believe he did i mean
[1:19:41] just in actuality
[1:19:43] told them
[1:19:44] this is what happened this is what
[1:19:46] happened cain though
[1:19:48] rejected what his dad said
[1:19:51] it's revelation uh relevant uh hebrews
[1:19:53] 11 4 tells us that by by faith
[1:19:56] abel offered unto god a more excellent
[1:19:58] sacrifice than cain well we know faith
[1:20:01] is a revelation right something that was
[1:20:03] revealed to them
[1:20:04] when adam was telling uh
[1:20:07] uh cain and abel abel got a revelation
[1:20:11] how did david get to revelation because
[1:20:12] he was of the seed of god
[1:20:14] how did cain not get that revelation
[1:20:16] because he was the seed of man he was
[1:20:18] the seed of
[1:20:19] the serpent right amen
[1:20:21] he didn't have that revelation
[1:20:23] he didn't have that understanding it was
[1:20:25] by revelation that cain received that uh
[1:20:28] that uh
[1:20:29] understanding of what was pleasing to
[1:20:31] the lord
[1:20:32] but even after
[1:20:35] god came to king
[1:20:37] and accepted abel's sacrifice and not
[1:20:40] cain's instead of correcting his
[1:20:43] misbehavior
[1:20:45] he rebelled
[1:20:46] right he became the arbiter of truth
[1:20:50] he rejected what his dad told him he
[1:20:53] rejected what his brother did
[1:20:55] he rejected what god told him he
[1:20:58] rejected god's grace
[1:21:00] he spurned god's grace and it was
[1:21:03] nothing left for cain at that time but
[1:21:05] judgment right he himself became the
[1:21:08] arbiter of truth
[1:21:10] i'm going to do it the way i want to do
[1:21:12] it and i don't care what you say god
[1:21:16] i'm going to do it the way i want to do
[1:21:17] it i don't care what that bible says
[1:21:20] oh you people i don't believe brother
[1:21:22] around was not a prophet's
[1:21:23] old-fashionedness there's nothing to
[1:21:25] that
[1:21:26] i believe it the way i want to believe
[1:21:28] it and people today are becoming their
[1:21:30] own gods
[1:21:32] they're becoming their own arbiters of
[1:21:34] truth just like cain did in the garden
[1:21:36] of eden he became his own armature of
[1:21:39] truth and rejected every bit of truth
[1:21:41] that was around him right to accept his
[1:21:44] own misinformation
[1:21:47] his own lie that he had cooked up in his
[1:21:50] mind to think that this i'm gonna do it
[1:21:53] this way god if you don't like it i
[1:21:55] don't care
[1:21:57] my isn't that just the same attitude
[1:21:58] people have today
[1:22:00] i'm going to do it the way i want i
[1:22:02] don't care what you say
[1:22:04] i'm going to do it however i want i'm
[1:22:05] going to act however more i'm going to
[1:22:07] live how i want and i don't care what
[1:22:09] anybody says
[1:22:10] preacher can preach what he wants bible
[1:22:12] can say what he wants i don't care if
[1:22:14] god it shall come i'm going to do it the
[1:22:16] way i want to do it and people live
[1:22:17] their lives exactly that way yes so much
[1:22:20] to the point
[1:22:24] that they just don't even believe in god
[1:22:26] anymore
[1:22:27] and their actions testify to it i don't
[1:22:30] care what their lips say
[1:22:32] their actions testify that they do not
[1:22:35] believe
[1:22:36] they do not believe in a god
[1:22:39] they do not believe in an almighty god
[1:22:41] of judgment who is the truth
[1:22:45] and the arbiter of truth
[1:22:49] can become his own arbiter people today
[1:22:52] are becoming their own arbiters of truth
[1:22:55] well i'll believe this part of the bible
[1:22:56] but i don't want to hear this part of
[1:22:58] the bible oh why is it why is the old
[1:23:00] testament even there to begin with we
[1:23:02] shouldn't even be following that old
[1:23:03] testament
[1:23:06] if without didn't have the old you
[1:23:07] wouldn't have the news that's right
[1:23:09] amen
[1:23:10] and without the types and shadows of the
[1:23:12] old how do we even see and understand
[1:23:14] what the new even means what god's even
[1:23:16] doing through when jesus is here and on
[1:23:19] and why we're here today
[1:23:22] i've heard brothers i've told you this
[1:23:24] before i've heard brothers say oh that's
[1:23:26] the old testament do you still sacrifice
[1:23:29] i said i absolutely do every time i go
[1:23:32] to church every day of my life i try
[1:23:34] i offer spiritual sacrifices unto my god
[1:23:37] giving praise in my lips amen i
[1:23:40] absolutely do now i don't take an animal
[1:23:42] and slit his throat and go build an
[1:23:44] altar and slit his throat and all the
[1:23:46] things that they did in the old
[1:23:47] testament but i take the spiritual
[1:23:49] application that there was in the old
[1:23:50] testament and applied in my life amen
[1:23:53] amen just like i do other things
[1:23:56] because it's the word of god
[1:23:59] they've become their own arbiters of
[1:24:01] truth by saying well i i i'll do this
[1:24:04] but i'm not going to do that i'll take
[1:24:06] this part of the word but i'm not going
[1:24:08] to take that part of the word and then
[1:24:09] when you stole them in the new testament
[1:24:12] that it's a follow-up of what's in the
[1:24:14] old well i you know that that's that's
[1:24:17] an allegory you know it didn't really
[1:24:18] mean it like that well you want to what
[1:24:20] do you say to somebody like that
[1:24:22] right
[1:24:23] they've become their own arbiters of the
[1:24:25] truth
[1:24:26] they don't want to hear the truth they
[1:24:27] don't want to know the truth the the
[1:24:29] truth in them are not on speaking terms
[1:24:33] and all that they have all that they
[1:24:34] know all that they give is a bunch of
[1:24:36] misinformation and all they have to do
[1:24:38] is find another little group of people
[1:24:40] who believe the same way and they form a
[1:24:42] little group and they're just a big
[1:24:43] group of misinformed people yes dares i
[1:24:46] say lost without christ they will be
[1:24:49] lost yes it's the same you got today
[1:24:53] you got half this country believing
[1:24:55] well probably even more than that it's
[1:24:58] just nothing but lies
[1:25:00] the things that's going on it's just
[1:25:02] nothing but lies
[1:25:04] it is what they want it to be see
[1:25:07] misinformation doesn't mean that it's
[1:25:09] that it's false information
[1:25:12] you know that misinformation isn't
[1:25:14] completely just something that's false
[1:25:17] misinformation can also be withholding
[1:25:20] facts about a subject that is pertinent
[1:25:22] to what you're telling them
[1:25:24] if you're withholding something that's
[1:25:26] valuable in what you're giving to people
[1:25:29] if you're withholding that not telling
[1:25:31] them that's misinformation right because
[1:25:34] they can't make an informed decision
[1:25:35] with only half the details right
[1:25:38] you got to know the whole story to
[1:25:40] understand what is actually happening
[1:25:42] what's unfolded
[1:25:44] now
[1:25:45] just like cain
[1:25:46] the world is doing the same thing
[1:25:49] god's coming down and saying if you'll
[1:25:51] just do what i tell you i will accept
[1:25:53] you
[1:25:54] and they're spurning every bit of grace
[1:25:56] god is trying to show to them yes
[1:25:58] they're rejecting it and remember
[1:26:00] brother graham said when you spurn grace
[1:26:02] there's nothing left but judgment yes
[1:26:04] right
[1:26:05] those who receive the knowledge of the
[1:26:07] truth
[1:26:09] and reject it
[1:26:11] remains no more sacrifice for sin
[1:26:15] people a lot of times put try to
[1:26:17] figure that out friend but it's really
[1:26:19] not hard listen to this two different
[1:26:22] powers of transformation or this is a
[1:26:24] power transformation god said our
[1:26:26] brother branham
[1:26:28] said
[1:26:29] cain was such a person
[1:26:32] religious indeed certainly
[1:26:34] but he had the wrong seed in him see and
[1:26:38] therefore it brought forth the serpent
[1:26:40] seed
[1:26:41] satan had hissed over his seat of uh of
[1:26:44] eden and that's what brought forth the
[1:26:46] king
[1:26:47] he put
[1:26:49] he's he's not at the brown tabernacle so
[1:26:52] he words it a little differently than he
[1:26:54] normally would
[1:26:56] uh basically he said satan had hissed
[1:26:58] over this seed
[1:27:00] we know what happened
[1:27:01] he's uh he's just in a different place
[1:27:03] so he's
[1:27:04] he's tamping his words down a little bit
[1:27:06] i guess and that's what brought forth
[1:27:09] the king
[1:27:10] he put his poison upon it look now
[1:27:14] he cain
[1:27:15] knew
[1:27:18] the perfect will of god
[1:27:20] he knew the perfect will of god came to
[1:27:23] it
[1:27:25] but he refused to do it
[1:27:28] there you go
[1:27:30] hebrews 10 26
[1:27:34] knew the perfect will of god and refused
[1:27:37] to do it
[1:27:38] people worry about that scripture
[1:27:39] sometimes people think that maybe they
[1:27:41] cross that line no no
[1:27:44] don't don't get that in your mind but
[1:27:46] now if you've received the knowledge of
[1:27:48] the truth and you absolutely flat out
[1:27:50] reject it
[1:27:52] you don't want to have anything to do it
[1:27:54] brother brown said cain knew the perfect
[1:27:56] will of god and refused to do it right
[1:28:00] from his daddy or well we'll say daddy
[1:28:04] from his stepdad
[1:28:06] from adam
[1:28:08] from his brother
[1:28:10] who who according if we take the
[1:28:12] scripture chronologically
[1:28:14] cain's sacrifice came first
[1:28:18] but after abel offered his sacrifice
[1:28:21] and god accepted abels and rejected
[1:28:24] cain's don't you think oh i see what's
[1:28:27] acceptable to god now
[1:28:29] abel would you mind me using one of your
[1:28:31] sheep
[1:28:33] i want to offer the same sacrifice
[1:28:36] but he didn't humble himself to do that
[1:28:39] and a lot of times that's
[1:28:41] one of the biggest things missing
[1:28:44] in people today is humility
[1:28:47] people don't want to humble themselves
[1:28:50] people don't want to humble themselves
[1:28:51] to the truth of god's word people don't
[1:28:53] want to humble themselves to a to a a
[1:28:56] message or or to a truth today
[1:28:59] people want to be
[1:29:01] built up in themselves oh
[1:29:03] i got it i know it i this is it
[1:29:06] and and they put a period at the end of
[1:29:08] their revelation
[1:29:10] you put a period at the end of your
[1:29:12] revelation you don't know my god
[1:29:15] you don't know the real god
[1:29:17] because
[1:29:18] my god does not have a period at the end
[1:29:21] yes he has a comma maybe
[1:29:24] or to be continued but he doesn't have a
[1:29:27] period because he's god almighty
[1:29:30] he's omnipotent all-knowing omniscient
[1:29:34] omnipresent
[1:29:36] he's infinite he's all-knowing he's
[1:29:38] all-powerful he's god
[1:29:42] how can that have an end
[1:29:44] there's no period to it
[1:29:47] people put a period on it and said this
[1:29:48] is it other than that become the
[1:29:50] arbiters of truth
[1:29:52] they self-appointed themselves the
[1:29:54] arbiter of truth
[1:29:56] all they have to do is have a few people
[1:29:58] listen to them
[1:30:00] but cain
[1:30:02] refused to do it
[1:30:05] he proved them to be the serpent seed
[1:30:09] when the scene uh when he seen the
[1:30:11] perfect will of god he refused it he had
[1:30:15] seen god's vindicate
[1:30:17] god vindicate abel's message
[1:30:20] he know that that was the will of god he
[1:30:23] saw it he saw god vindicated
[1:30:26] and what did god say to him
[1:30:29] he said if you'll just do the same thing
[1:30:32] and do worship like your brother you'll
[1:30:35] do well
[1:30:36] i will receive you
[1:30:38] yes that's the same thing he says to
[1:30:40] people today
[1:30:42] i will receive you if you just accept it
[1:30:45] the way that that's pleasing to me am i
[1:30:48] and people don't care they don't want to
[1:30:50] be pleasing to god
[1:30:52] why i don't know power
[1:30:55] popularity
[1:30:56] money
[1:30:58] you name it
[1:31:00] why do people do these things just flat
[1:31:03] out rejected to pride to humble
[1:31:05] themselves to the will of god
[1:31:07] too prideful
[1:31:09] to humble themselves to to the
[1:31:11] simplicity of the word
[1:31:13] god help us
[1:31:15] he was too prideful he was of the wrong
[1:31:17] seed
[1:31:18] if you do the same thing then
[1:31:20] then you do well now god's power to
[1:31:23] transform
[1:31:25] this is a
[1:31:26] a little earlier he preached these
[1:31:28] within
[1:31:29] a few weeks of each other god's power to
[1:31:32] transform but notice
[1:31:34] cain come to worship
[1:31:36] but he had the wrong seed in him now
[1:31:39] notice remember brother branham said
[1:31:41] when they came they built the altar just
[1:31:44] the same and brought the best he said
[1:31:46] he's just as sincere as he could be
[1:31:49] kane was just as sincere as abel
[1:31:52] built this built the altar and
[1:31:54] everything was just perfect exactly the
[1:31:56] way it was supposed to be
[1:31:59] everything he was just as religious
[1:32:02] he was just as pious
[1:32:05] he played the part he looked the part
[1:32:07] but when he come to the sacrifice
[1:32:09] when it comes to the thing that god
[1:32:12] looked at and accepted or rejected
[1:32:15] he could not do it he had no revelation
[1:32:17] he was willing to have church
[1:32:20] he was willing to have a big steeple
[1:32:22] building glass-stained windows he was
[1:32:24] willing to do all of the uh the things
[1:32:26] that needed to be done but the
[1:32:28] sacrifices where he fell short
[1:32:31] and that's exactly where people fall
[1:32:32] short today
[1:32:34] they want church oh people are okay with
[1:32:36] church they're okay with going to a
[1:32:37] building
[1:32:40] don't touch any of my life now like i
[1:32:42] was saying last night people wanted
[1:32:44] people want a god that'll be their
[1:32:46] savior but they don't want a god that'll
[1:32:47] be their lord right they don't want a
[1:32:50] god that will tell them what to do they
[1:32:51] don't want a god that will make them
[1:32:53] humble themselves and die to themselves
[1:32:56] so that they take up the mantle of
[1:32:57] christ and live by his spirit and by his
[1:33:00] will
[1:33:02] cain come to worship
[1:33:05] but he had the wrong seed him serpent
[1:33:07] seed the his of the serpent had hissed
[1:33:10] over him for the seed of the uh the seed
[1:33:12] of the woman he knew the perfect will of
[1:33:15] god but refused to do it
[1:33:17] he said did you know that
[1:33:19] listen now
[1:33:21] knows the will of god
[1:33:24] but just refuses to do it
[1:33:27] come on well if satan knows well god
[1:33:29] refuses to do it don't his children do
[1:33:31] the same
[1:33:33] yes the children will be the same satan
[1:33:36] knows the will of god but he just
[1:33:38] refuses to do it
[1:33:41] well then that's where you fall hebrews
[1:33:43] 10 26 that's where people fall
[1:33:46] they know the truth and they just flat
[1:33:47] refuse to do it i'm just not going to do
[1:33:50] it i'm not going to live that way i'm
[1:33:51] not going to accept it like that now
[1:33:53] some people say oh i can't live like
[1:33:55] that well what you're saying is you're
[1:33:57] not going to live like that right
[1:33:59] because the bottom line is you can if
[1:34:01] you want to
[1:34:03] people do what they want to do i
[1:34:06] found that out long time ago people are
[1:34:08] going to do what they want to do that's
[1:34:10] just happens the way it is and
[1:34:12] unfortunately
[1:34:14] it happens way too many times
[1:34:17] and if god's not a part of it see
[1:34:20] and that's where
[1:34:22] people have a
[1:34:23] a lot of people have a problem
[1:34:26] they want
[1:34:27] now follow my thought here they want god
[1:34:30] to be a part of their life
[1:34:34] and they do they're a lot of people
[1:34:36] they're sincere and wanting god to be a
[1:34:38] part of their life
[1:34:40] but they don't want god to be their life
[1:34:43] i don't want god to be a part of my life
[1:34:46] i want him to be my life
[1:34:49] he's either my life or nothing right not
[1:34:52] just a part of my life
[1:34:53] if you've got god as a part of your life
[1:34:56] well then you can put him here or take
[1:34:57] him out here well if you don't want him
[1:34:59] over here just pull him out you know if
[1:35:00] you don't like god here he just you just
[1:35:03] fit him in where you can
[1:35:06] and that's what people do yes they just
[1:35:08] fit god in wherever they can because
[1:35:10] he's only a part of their life
[1:35:12] he's not their life right if he's your
[1:35:15] life you'll be obedient do whatever he
[1:35:17] says be led by his spirit follow his
[1:35:20] word humble ourselves to obedience
[1:35:25] if he's our life if we are dead and he
[1:35:27] is alive in us then that's that's how we
[1:35:30] obey him that's how we live our lives
[1:35:32] but people
[1:35:34] most people just want him as a part of
[1:35:35] their life right i just i just want you
[1:35:38] over here god when i'm sick i need you
[1:35:40] to i need you to heal me
[1:35:42] uh
[1:35:43] when i need a raise at my job lord just
[1:35:46] speak to that man
[1:35:47] lord if i need some guy he's just i need
[1:35:50] you then you know then then oh prolonged
[1:35:52] god can just but that's just they just
[1:35:54] stick him in here and stick him in there
[1:35:55] and and he's just all this the rest of
[1:35:58] their time they're just going about
[1:35:59] their lives not even recognize or
[1:36:00] acknowledge that god even exists
[1:36:03] even people do that about the message
[1:36:06] amen
[1:36:08] satan knows the will of god
[1:36:11] he just refuses to do it
[1:36:13] how many people the same way god have
[1:36:16] mercy there remains no more sacrifice
[1:36:18] for sin
[1:36:20] at that point you know it won't do it
[1:36:23] no sacrifice for sin
[1:36:25] or rejections
[1:36:27] he had seen god vindicate abel's message
[1:36:30] now i want you to think use your
[1:36:31] thinking man's filter now for a minute
[1:36:33] abel's correct message that god
[1:36:35] vindicated to be the truth
[1:36:37] abel's message had been received
[1:36:40] and cain sought and knew that god had
[1:36:42] vindicated but he just refused to do it
[1:36:47] same thing today
[1:36:48] they've become the arbiters of their
[1:36:50] truth
[1:36:51] a man
[1:36:53] was baffled one day about this
[1:36:55] i'll close here in just a few minutes a
[1:36:57] man was baffled about this didn't
[1:36:59] understand it most probably the most
[1:37:01] powerful man on earth at the time saint
[1:37:03] john chapter 18.
[1:37:09] st john chapter 18.
[1:37:18] we'll begin reading uh verse 33.
[1:37:22] saint john 18 33 then pilate entered
[1:37:25] into the judgment hall again
[1:37:27] and called jesus
[1:37:29] said unto him art thou the king of the
[1:37:31] jews
[1:37:32] jesus answered him sayest thou this
[1:37:34] thing of thyself or did others tell it
[1:37:36] of me
[1:37:38] pilate answered him am i a jew
[1:37:40] thine old nation and the chief priests
[1:37:42] have delivered thee unto me what has
[1:37:45] thou done well see
[1:37:47] they became the arbiters of truth
[1:37:50] that's why they delivered christ to
[1:37:53] pilate
[1:37:54] because they were the arbiters of truth
[1:37:56] right at that point
[1:37:59] you're even even your chief priests have
[1:38:01] delivered you unto me what have you done
[1:38:04] jesus answered my kingdom is not of this
[1:38:06] world
[1:38:07] if my kingdom were of this world then
[1:38:08] would my servants fight that i should
[1:38:11] not be delivered to the jews but now is
[1:38:13] my kingdom not from hens pilate
[1:38:16] therefore said unto him art thou that a
[1:38:18] king then
[1:38:20] jesus answered if thou sayest that i am
[1:38:21] a king to this end was i born and for
[1:38:24] this cause came into the world that i
[1:38:26] should bear witness unto the truth
[1:38:29] the truth
[1:38:30] there's only one
[1:38:33] the truth
[1:38:35] it's not uttered by buddha
[1:38:37] it's not uttered by muhammad
[1:38:39] it's not uttered by any arbiter of their
[1:38:42] own truth in the world today there's
[1:38:44] only one truth
[1:38:46] it's not a written letter
[1:38:49] it's not in script
[1:38:52] it's not something anybody's uttered
[1:38:54] it's not something that's been projected
[1:38:56] or broadcast there's only one thing
[1:38:59] truth
[1:39:00] and that truth is a person
[1:39:03] that person is jesus christ amen that's
[1:39:06] the only the truth that exists
[1:39:09] he is jesus he is the arbiter of the
[1:39:14] truth
[1:39:15] because he is the truth
[1:39:17] and if what we're giving what we're
[1:39:19] saved what we're doing doesn't reflect
[1:39:22] him and this word
[1:39:24] then it is misinformation
[1:39:26] and it is not an arbiter of truth right
[1:39:29] an ultimate authority
[1:39:32] an ultimate type host
[1:39:35] amen
[1:39:39] i should bear witness unto the truth
[1:39:41] everyone that is of the truth heareth my
[1:39:44] voice aren't you thank god for the truth
[1:39:47] thank god for jesus christ yeah thank
[1:39:49] god for being a part of that
[1:39:51] thank god that i can put my name right
[1:39:54] there
[1:39:55] everyone you and bennett is of the truth
[1:39:59] because he hears my voice
[1:40:01] you put your name there
[1:40:03] you are off the truth because you hear
[1:40:05] his voice
[1:40:07] because you recognize every other voice
[1:40:09] is a lie and his is the truth
[1:40:12] he said that every man's word be a lot
[1:40:14] his words
[1:40:15] be true
[1:40:16] that word that truth is a person
[1:40:19] remember used to be a man was only as
[1:40:21] good as his word
[1:40:23] people
[1:40:24] lie don't think anything about it
[1:40:25] anymore
[1:40:26] it it it's so it's so sad
[1:40:30] give me this little caveat here
[1:40:32] that
[1:40:33] society and in a godly nation
[1:40:36] that people have gotten
[1:40:38] so loosed from their morals and the
[1:40:41] truth
[1:40:42] that
[1:40:43] lying and stealing mean nothing to
[1:40:46] people anymore
[1:40:48] i installed a ring doorbell on
[1:40:51] what was my client mary's house or son
[1:40:54] selling it i did a lot of work over
[1:40:55] there and i had to download an app to
[1:40:58] put the doorbell in
[1:40:59] well that app i guess i'm a member of
[1:41:02] now i get ring uh
[1:41:04] alerts all the time from around the
[1:41:06] neighborhood
[1:41:07] of
[1:41:09] things that happen lost dog or uh stuff
[1:41:12] like that
[1:41:13] and i can't tell you how many times i
[1:41:15] get alerts because of people just
[1:41:16] stealing a package off somebody's front
[1:41:18] porch

[1:41:58] this nation is ourselves yes
[1:42:02] this nation has destroyed itself not
[1:42:05] russia yeah russia hasn't destroyed
[1:42:08] people used to be scared to death of
[1:42:09] communism i'm not for communism i hate
[1:42:12] it
[1:42:13] but
[1:42:14] this nation was destroyed by communism
[1:42:18] there's a rise of people mostly young
[1:42:20] people that want socialism in our
[1:42:23] country
[1:42:24] even sitting in congress and they
[1:42:25] believe socialism or communism is the
[1:42:28] way that we should go
[1:42:30] that's not killing this country
[1:42:32] what killed this country was ourselves
[1:42:34] right when we rejected as a nation when
[1:42:36] we rejected god in this message we
[1:42:39] rejected him yes
[1:42:41] and when we rejected him what happens
[1:42:43] when spur uh grace has spurned judgment
[1:42:47] it's been in our judgment ever since and
[1:42:49] our morals and our ethics and our have
[1:42:52] all just
[1:42:53] downhill down yeah now if you're not
[1:42:56] careful a little infiltrated in our
[1:42:57] lives you just tell a lie and say oh i
[1:42:59] just told a little white lie no there is
[1:43:01] no such thing

[1:43:10] and people lie don't even think anything
[1:43:12] about it
[1:43:13] it means nothing to them anymore
[1:43:16] why just it it's a little bit of a light
[1:43:19] if it's a lie it's a life ranger if
[1:43:21] you're giving it to deceive people
[1:43:24] that's misinformation
[1:43:26] it's a lie

[1:43:30] i don't care what color it is right and
[1:43:32] it means nothing to people anymore to
[1:43:34] lie
[1:43:36] our presidents our government
[1:43:38] they lie all the time
[1:43:40] the people that claim to be the arbiters
[1:43:42] of truth and and news programs every day
[1:43:44] they lie
[1:43:45] just lie lie they don't care
[1:43:48] you know why they don't care cause no
[1:43:50] repercussion right why do people go in
[1:43:53] and smash these counters and take all
[1:43:55] the jewelry and all this stuff out run
[1:43:56] out the door why
[1:43:58] why do people go in the cvs's in the
[1:44:00] walgreens with bags and come out loaded
[1:44:02] with bags full of stuff and just walk
[1:44:04] out the door
[1:44:05] my wife saw it over here at burlington
[1:44:08] and just took stuff just walked out the
[1:44:09] door she saw it
[1:44:11] he just walked out the door yeah you
[1:44:14] know
[1:44:16] just having a nice day let's see their
[1:44:18] music or whatever just going to go have
[1:44:21] a bird
[1:44:22] or go fence some of the stuff they just
[1:44:24] stole to go to panda or something they
[1:44:26] don't care
[1:44:27] yeah
[1:44:27] absolutely no moral about it it's sad
[1:44:31] but it's where the nation has become why
[1:44:34] because people think that they know
[1:44:36] better
[1:44:37] people have come to the place that they
[1:44:39] think they know better right
[1:44:41] and when you get to the place that you
[1:44:42] know better than god we're lost friends
[1:44:46] we are lost
[1:44:48] pilate said unto him
[1:44:51] what is truth
[1:44:53] what is truth
[1:44:55] truth's not a what
[1:44:57] truth is a who
[1:44:59] truth is a person truth is jesus the
[1:45:02] truth was standing right there in front
[1:45:04] of pilate
[1:45:05] he's asking truth what is true
[1:45:09] why
[1:45:10] because at that moment this man is the
[1:45:13] arbiter of his own truth
[1:45:15] because he's powerful he's in charge
[1:45:18] he's the one who makes the rules he's
[1:45:20] the one that breaks the rules he's the
[1:45:22] one that says what comes and goes
[1:45:25] your life even told jesus your life is
[1:45:27] in my hands tell me something that'll
[1:45:29] cause me to release you i can kill you
[1:45:32] right now or i can set you free
[1:45:35] jesus said you have no power at all my
[1:45:37] father had to give it to you
[1:45:40] amen
[1:45:41] that's the truth
[1:45:43] praise the lord
[1:45:44] oh
[1:45:45] you know friend when you talk and
[1:45:47] think about how
[1:45:49] how that is that
[1:45:51] that that authority that power
[1:45:54] amen
[1:45:55] and the fact that he he himself not
[1:45:58] pilate have power over his life
[1:46:00] because jesus said i have authority over
[1:46:03] my life paraphrasing i'll lay it down
[1:46:06] i take it up again
[1:46:08] well people worry to death about all the
[1:46:10] things going on in this world today
[1:46:11] friend who has the power have you given
[1:46:13] and relinquished it to the devil
[1:46:16] or is that power in the truth
[1:46:19] do we believe that truth
[1:46:21] is that truth living in us
[1:46:24] is that true is that truth that we
[1:46:26] listen to and obey
[1:46:28] amen
[1:46:30] if it is then what are we worried about
[1:46:33] what are we scared over what are we
[1:46:34] fragging about
[1:46:36] there's nothing to be worried or scared
[1:46:39] frightened over
[1:46:41] amen god has it under control
[1:46:44] same god today
[1:46:46] proverbs
[1:46:48] i close here proverbs chapter 16
[1:46:52] verse 25 proverbs samuel says there's
[1:46:54] two different places or uh um
[1:46:57] solomon says it's two different places
[1:47:00] this and his phrase exactly the same way
[1:47:03] i looked it up again the other day
[1:47:05] the wording is exactly the same in both
[1:47:08] places
[1:47:09] i
[1:47:11] just picked proverbs 16 25 there is the
[1:47:13] way that seemeth right unto a man
[1:47:16] but the end thereof are the ways of
[1:47:19] death yes there's a way that seemeth
[1:47:21] right to man
[1:47:23] man
[1:47:24] becoming the arbiter of truth
[1:47:26] and that man says well this is what's
[1:47:28] right
[1:47:29] what gives him the authority to say that
[1:47:33] the only way he could have an authority
[1:47:34] to say anything like that is if people
[1:47:37] gave it to him
[1:47:39] to listen to him and obey him
[1:47:42] same thing with the devil
[1:47:44] the only way you have power if you
[1:47:46] listen to it and you obey it yes if you
[1:47:49] obey it then you've accepted that person
[1:47:52] as the arbiter of truth and if you've
[1:47:53] accepted that person as the arbitrator
[1:47:55] of truth you've rejected christ
[1:47:58] christ the word has no effect then but
[1:48:00] there is a way that seems right to man
[1:48:03] it looks okay looks good seems right
[1:48:06] exactly the same wording two places
[1:48:09] solomon says this
[1:48:11] what a warning friend
[1:48:13] that it does seem right to man it looks
[1:48:15] like it might be right but the end of
[1:48:17] that is death
[1:48:19] god help us never to choose the way of a
[1:48:22] man yes never to choose or put somebody
[1:48:25] on a pedestal as being the arbiter of
[1:48:27] truth people do that to pastors you know
[1:48:29] yeah
[1:48:30] brother bannon warned against it
[1:48:32] fought against it yes
[1:48:35] they called him jesus christ and
[1:48:37] baptized his name and put him on this
[1:48:39] pedestal he fought it and fought it even
[1:48:41] had that vision about the snake it got
[1:48:43] beheaded but wiggled into the into the
[1:48:46] water
[1:48:47] well what's the water represents people
[1:48:49] multitudes people how did that snake get
[1:48:51] its power then
[1:48:54] from the people yeah
[1:48:55] brother branham rejected it flat out
[1:48:57] over and over and people still do it
[1:49:00] people come against this message because
[1:49:02] they think brother branham said that no
[1:49:04] he did not
[1:49:06] he was absolutely against it yes
[1:49:09] but it wiggled in that water
[1:49:11] and it got into a multitude of people
[1:49:14] again and that's where it gained its
[1:49:16] strength back because people continued
[1:49:18] to believe it
[1:49:20] they saw brother branham just like cain
[1:49:22] saw abel
[1:49:24] saw it and thought wow that's you know
[1:49:27] made a carnal interpretation of a
[1:49:29] spiritual revelation
[1:49:32] and they do the same thing today
[1:49:34] but
[1:49:35] he only brought a man
[1:49:39] a person can only bring what god has
[1:49:43] given to bring
[1:49:44] it is contained in this scripture
[1:49:47] any one of us
[1:49:48] we're not the arbiters of our own truth
[1:49:51] we are not disputed misinformation our
[1:49:54] ideas about what we think the bible says
[1:49:56] or what we think the message our quote
[1:49:58] might say
[1:49:59] no it is don't tell me what he said
[1:50:02] don't
[1:50:03] don't tell me what he meant tell me what
[1:50:04] he said
[1:50:06] don't tell me what the interpretation of
[1:50:08] it is what does it say because what it
[1:50:11] says is going to interpret itself right
[1:50:13] by bringing it past
[1:50:15] that becomes the truth because we
[1:50:18] recognize it and see it as the truth
[1:50:22] amen god help us that way that seems
[1:50:25] right to man
[1:50:27] and people think oh surely god will
[1:50:29] accept this
[1:50:30] surely god will be okay with this
[1:50:33] surely god i i'm a good person
[1:50:36] friend look this is not the time to be
[1:50:38] playing church
[1:50:40] now i don't know
[1:50:44] that
[1:50:45] that scarlet dress of that vice
[1:50:48] president was what brother branham saw i
[1:50:50] don't know
[1:50:51] beautiful woman evil heart i don't know
[1:50:55] i don't know if
[1:50:57] what's going on over there now with
[1:50:58] russian ukraine is a fulfillment of that
[1:51:01] vision that god gave brother branham
[1:51:03] those seven that unfold i don't know
[1:51:07] i do know that the exclamation behind it
[1:51:10] is
[1:51:11] watch for it see what's going on see
[1:51:13] what happens when this takes place and
[1:51:14] when this is going on do you know that
[1:51:16] there's like
[1:51:17] nine
[1:51:19] pipe energy pipelines coming out of
[1:51:21] russia into europe and seven i believe
[1:51:24] that seven of them go through ukraine
[1:51:27] seven
[1:51:29] because ukraine is the big bulk of land
[1:51:32] between russia and europe
[1:51:34] seven of those pipelines go through
[1:51:36] ukraine i'm not saying that's it i don't
[1:51:38] know
[1:51:39] but i know what's going to happen
[1:51:41] but i know when russia gets to that
[1:51:43] place that man maybe gets mad or
[1:51:46] accidentally or something pushes that
[1:51:47] button for him we're gone
[1:51:49] this bride's gone raptures happens
[1:51:52] amen
[1:51:53] how close are we brother ram said that
[1:51:55] in the 50s yes how much closer are we
[1:51:58] today yes oh my god help us it's not a
[1:52:02] time to be playing church it's not a
[1:52:03] time to be straddling fences and say
[1:52:05] well you know i i i'm a good person god
[1:52:08] will accept me
[1:52:10] you know hell's going to be full of good
[1:52:12] people yes with good intentions
[1:52:15] i don't say that lightly i don't say it
[1:52:17] easily it's hard for me to say because i
[1:52:19] don't want anybody to go there
[1:52:20] but the fact is there's going to be
[1:52:23] god just told me
[1:52:25] to accept that that
[1:52:27] that truth
[1:52:29] that arbiter that that that truth that
[1:52:32] is jesus christ the word amen that that
[1:52:35] word and
[1:52:36] continue to engulf in my life the truth
[1:52:38] will set you free friends yes amen truth
[1:52:41] will set you free maybe now
[1:52:42] the little message the the songs the
[1:52:44] lord give me about being set free
[1:52:47] the emancipator and god's setting us
[1:52:49] free but it's the truth that sets you
[1:52:51] free
[1:52:52] it's christ the truth the word is what
[1:52:55] sets us free
[1:52:56] amen woe unto that person
[1:53:00] that sees that word that knows that word
[1:53:02] like like like brother brandon said cain
[1:53:05] even satan knows the will of god and
[1:53:07] just flat refuses to do it
[1:53:11] you know i believe over in peter it says
[1:53:13] it's been better for that person never
[1:53:15] to have known the truth at all right but
[1:53:17] to have come to that truth and rejected
[1:53:20] it yes
[1:53:22] my
[1:53:23] it's a bad fearful time for humanity
[1:53:25] saints is about to hit this earth
[1:53:27] already started yeah pray for those in

[1:54:02] those that are that need god
[1:54:05] amen we we all need him more and more
[1:54:07] every day yes amen let's stand if we
[1:54:10] could
[1:54:17] you know there was a man named jonah one
[1:54:18] time
[1:54:22] jonah didn't necessarily feel like he
[1:54:24] knew better
[1:54:26] he was just running from god
[1:54:28] he was just trying to get away from the
[1:54:30] truth he was trying to get away from the
[1:54:32] responsibility that was coming his way
[1:54:35] he uh
[1:54:36] he didn't know
[1:54:39] and he was
[1:54:40] he was trying to get away from it he was
[1:54:42] trying to run from it
[1:54:44] but
[1:54:45] as we probably have done before in our
[1:54:47] lives
[1:54:48] try to run from it
[1:54:50] god always has a way of bringing us back
[1:54:52] to where we should be
[1:54:54] he always has a way of of of causing us
[1:54:58] to come back to work uh to where he
[1:55:00] wants us in in his life yes amen
[1:55:04] and i believe he does it gently
[1:55:08] he did it to the jews
[1:55:10] amen call and and caused russia to rise
[1:55:14] up
[1:55:15] as one of them hitler and mussolini and
[1:55:17] stalin to to drive those jews back where
[1:55:20] they were supposed to be right bring
[1:55:22] those jews remember the
[1:55:24] great eagle on bringing back the
[1:55:26] prophets and the
[1:55:28] bringing them back on eagles wings
[1:55:30] you know all that was done for for that
[1:55:33] purpose
[1:55:35] nothing happens like this friend but
[1:55:38] what there's a purpose and there is a
[1:55:40] purpose
[1:55:41] amen there's a purpose
[1:55:44] i can't say that i am the arbiter of
[1:55:46] truth to know what that purpose
[1:55:47] necessarily is outside of what the
[1:55:49] scripture has said what brother branham
[1:55:51] or the prophecies has come amen i don't
[1:55:53] know but we do know

[1:59:30] that comes along
[1:59:32] that seems a little sketchy along those
[1:59:34] lines of that truth that's in you

[1:59:39] that's the spirit the holy spirit
[1:59:42] brother green would tell us you know say

[1:59:45] amen uh i've said several times it just
[1:59:49] it didn't ring the bell or something
[1:59:51] like that but you know
