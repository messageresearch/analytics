[31:52] my friends that used to live in Tucson
[31:54] he's a pediatric doctor moved to
[31:56] Indianapolis several years ago I think
[31:58] preo um and we got news on his Facebook
[32:02] that he unexpectedly passed away on the
[32:04] four it took this long to Friday for the
[32:08] family to be able to confirm this
[32:09] passing and the date the fourth so I
[32:13] don't know anything surrounding his
[32:15] passing but um I know it's been a sudden
[32:18] shock to the medical community where he
[32:20] is his family and and everyone
[32:23] connected how old was he he was 28
[32:30] more in
[32:33] passing
[32:44] Str I also have a request I forgot about
[32:47] it I am struggling to learn excess
[32:51] proceeds so that um I can start earning
[32:54] a real living and I've been struggling
[32:56] with this months now trying to now know
[33:01] because I took some time off to write a
[33:03] missionary piece that I have one for
[33:05] everybody to pass out the people you see
[33:08] on the street you know whoever you feel
[33:10] led to give it to um and because they've
[33:13] got nothing better to do than sit at
[33:15] their bus stop and pass out or scroll
[33:18] through their phone so it's the only way
[33:20] that we can reach these people when
[33:22] they're away because they can stay away
[33:24] for long enough so they'll figure that
[33:25] out themselves but I have um not been
[33:29] able to I'm slowly stepp step by step at
[33:33] a time trying to the abbreviations and
[33:36] terms and all this and I need help from
[33:40] the Lord to to get through this
[33:42] Labyrinth of real
[33:44] estate Mish you know Mish MOS that that
[33:49] I've never been exposed to before and
[33:51] the technical terms and the court terms
[33:53] where do you get this stuff and and and
[33:57] and um so I just need help with this I
[34:00] haven't even turned in my first case yet
[34:03] I'm struggling with that one now and um
[34:07] and so I just um I'm hoping that I can
[34:11] turn it in on
[34:13] Monday and and so I just need help with
[34:19] that I can real living my my uh
[34:23] government check is going to go away
[34:25] after Trump is elected and I've got to
[34:28] have income this isn't this isn't just I
[34:32] wish more money this is well first of
[34:35] all we don't know if Trump's going be
[34:36] elected second of all both candidates

[35:18] God's help well if that prophecy is a
[35:20] true prophecy then the Lord will take
[35:22] care of it because it's his word yeah

[50:12] to you Lord again in the name of the
[50:14] Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen amen
[50:19] Genesis CH 11 uh I want to read the
[50:22] first nine verses of Genesis 11
[50:27] and the whole earth was of one language
[50:30] and of one speech and it came to pass as
[50:33] they journeyed uh from the East that
[50:36] they found a plain in the land of Shar
[50:38] and they dwelt there and they said one
[50:41] to another go too let us make brick burn
[50:44] them thoroughly they had brick for stone
[50:46] and slime had they for Mortar they said
[50:49] go too let us build us a city and a
[50:51] tower whose top May reach unto heaven
[50:54] and let us make us a name lest we be
[50:57] scattered abroad upon the face of the
[50:59] whole earth the Lord came down to see
[51:02] the city and the tower which the
[51:04] children of men build it and the Lord
[51:06] said behold the people is one and they
[51:11] have all one language and this they
[51:13] begin to do and now nothing will be
[51:16] restrained from them which they have
[51:18] imagined to do go you let us go down and
[51:22] there confound their language that they
[51:24] may not understand one another's speech
[51:26] so the Lord scattered them abroad from
[51:28] the F uh from th upon the face of all
[51:31] the Earth and they left off to build the
[51:33] city therefore is the name of it called
[51:35] Babel because the Lord did there
[51:37] confound the language of all the Earth
[51:40] and and from then did the Lord scatter
[51:42] them abroad upon the face of all the
[51:45] Earth and you could be seated if you'd
[51:48] like
[51:51] amen I want to uh emphasize and uh bring
[51:56] uh a thought of Oneness today uh Oneness
[52:00] but the authority and the power uh by
[52:03] which this scripture uh brings to us
[52:06] that even God himself and his own
[52:09] verbage of what God has what was written
[52:11] in the scripture uh of the power of
[52:14] Oneness of the power of unity of the
[52:18] power of being together in one mind in
[52:20] one Accord the power of this evident
[52:23] here as God in his own language God
[52:27] himself said behold the people is one
[52:31] now that's the first thing the people
[52:33] are one amen and that's the first thing
[52:35] that has to be done regardless and now
[52:38] these were all in the same place these
[52:40] people were all in one location these
[52:42] people were all in uh uh within earshot
[52:45] of each other there was no internet
[52:47] there was no computers there was no
[52:49] telephone there was no uh cell phones uh
[52:53] there was no email there was no uh uh
[52:56] WhatsApp uh this was lip to ear back in
[52:59] the day uh they had no other way to
[53:02] communicate but to be within shouting
[53:04] distance of one another so these were
[53:07] all in one place but I want you to
[53:09] understand that they were one now you
[53:12] don't have to be in one place to be one
[53:15] right you don't have to be in the same
[53:16] room to be one you don't have to be in
[53:18] the same city state country to be one
[53:21] you can be one just by organizing
[53:23] yourself or or or coming together under
[53:27] a single entity that we all come
[53:31] together under amen and that entity I
[53:34] believe for the Bride of Jesus Christ is
[53:36] the spirit of God it's the spirit of God
[53:39] that is Unified around the world Amen to
[53:42] everyone that believes to everyone who
[53:45] has received that Spirit to everyone no
[53:48] matter where they are the deep dark
[53:50] reaches of this country whether they're
[53:53] alone by themselves they're bride member
[53:55] that spirit of God is on them just like
[53:58] he is on us and that makes us
[54:02] one that brings us together as one we're
[54:05] not together under the same language
[54:07] we're not together under the same race
[54:09] we're not together in the same Creed
[54:11] we're not together under the same
[54:13] nationality but we're together under one
[54:16] spirit and that spirit is Jesus Christen
[54:20] and together that brings us as one now
[54:22] that Oneness is a very important aspect
[54:26] cuz that's the first thing God said
[54:28] first thing God says they are one and
[54:32] because they are
[54:34] one they have all one language amen and
[54:37] of course uh the bride internationally
[54:40] has a language yes uh we know this bride
[54:43] has a language it's a language the rest
[54:46] of the world doesn't understand it's a
[54:48] language the rest of Christian language
[54:52] even Christians a lot don't understand
[54:55] the language that the has how many
[54:58] Christians that that do you know
[55:00] personally first of all how many
[55:02] Christians of those Christians do you
[55:04] know talk about Christ and mystery of
[55:06] God revealed how many of you know talk
[55:09] about the Seven Seals right seven Church
[55:11] ages right uh how many you know talk
[55:14] about it is the rising of the sun right
[55:16] uh how many of you uh have heard of of
[55:20] the of the language that that that the
[55:22] bride has come to know as something
[55:25] common for us us amen when we talk about
[55:28] the seals we don't even have to say the
[55:30] Seven Seals when you say seals you know
[55:33] what we're talking about any bride
[55:36] member anyone in this message knows of
[55:39] that same language that are we are of
[55:41] the same language you say seals you know
[55:43] what we're talking about amen you say
[55:46] Prophet you know what we're talking you
[55:48] know who we're talking about we're
[55:50] talking about Will William Mary and
[55:52] brandom you talk about church ages uh
[55:56] what other of the language that we use
[55:59] as as Bride As message people that we
[56:02] use that's a commonality to us that the
[56:04] rest of the world doesn't know right uh
[56:07] I I remember one time I had a very good
[56:09] friend he has passed on but he's a very
[56:12] dear friend we did a lot of stuff
[56:14] together played a lot of golf went to
[56:16] lunch a lot spent time together we
[56:18] worked together at the company when I
[56:20] was pury manager in Charlotte we were
[56:22] very close his name was Pat hman he
[56:24] actually came to Florida one time and I
[56:26] had him up and sang I got criticized
[56:28] because I had an unbeliever come and
[56:30] sang in our church but anyway um that's
[56:33] another story I had him say beautiful
[56:35] voice he had a really good voice uh good
[56:38] brother loved him uh when he was in
[56:40] Florida uh I took him out to this place
[56:43] that had like a there a side of beef was
[56:46] their prime rib um I took everybody
[56:50] there once I found out about it uh just
[56:53] delicious I uh I would go get the the
[56:56] big one and I eat the outside of it take
[56:58] the rest of it home and have sandwiches
[56:59] for two or three weeks uh but anyway I
[57:02] took him there and he looked at me and I
[57:05] had been witnessing to about the message
[57:06] and the prophet all this time he said
[57:08] what is the biggest difference that you
[57:10] would say that's between what I believe
[57:13] and what you believe now he followed a
[57:15] different nominal Minister who uh was
[57:20] along the Pentecostal line of speaking
[57:22] in tongues the is initial evidence of
[57:24] the Holy Ghost so much so
[57:27] that I went by their church one time
[57:28] their actual Church sign that advertised
[57:31] their sign out in front of their lawn
[57:33] was in the shape of a tongue oh that
[57:36] that's how that's how sold into that
[57:40] initial evidence speaking in tongues
[57:42] that they were but he asked me he said
[57:44] what's but I didn't I gifts aren't it I
[57:47] I'm not uh gifts are gifts that's what
[57:50] they are brother random called them
[57:52] temporal gifts uh we have them now
[57:55] they're for the Ed of the church the the
[57:58] body and things and and thank God for
[58:00] them but they're temporal uh but he
[58:03] asked me he said what's the biggest
[58:05] difference uh between what I believe
[58:07] what I follow and what and and and what
[58:10] you keep trying to tell me I said well
[58:12] uh the biggest thing that I know of that
[58:14] I could think of that that uh that put
[58:18] that made the Bible a new book was the
[58:20] seils and he looked at me like a mule
[58:22] looking at a new
[58:23] gate he said what is that
[58:27] and and now look this this was not a man
[58:30] that did not know the scripture now of
[58:32] course he knew basically what they
[58:35] taught him in the following that he
[58:38] followed uh of of that U televangelist
[58:42] Minister he did but he knew the
[58:45] scripture and I would have thought for
[58:46] sure I mean how do you not know I mean
[58:48] it's it's very scripture I mean it's a
[58:51] common language for us that we speak as
[58:53] as as message Believers but it's common
[58:56] in I mean it's not something that if
[58:58] you've read Revelations you know the
[59:00] seals uh it shouldn't be that uh
[59:05] non-common if you will but I said uh the
[59:08] opening of the revelation of the seals
[59:09] the opening of the seals and he didn't
[59:11] know what I was talking
[59:12] about and I of course I begin to explain
[59:15] it to him but then it made me of course
[59:18] realize this is not something common
[59:22] that even christiandom speaks about even
[59:24] other Christians and other Rel religions
[59:26] and denominations that they speak of
[59:28] they they don't talk like that that is
[59:31] not a language that they that that they
[59:33] revert to like we do because we know as
[59:37] brother randam talked about that the
[59:39] opening of the seals to him made the
[59:41] Bible a new book to him because then you
[59:43] could look at him of course the whole
[59:45] history uh back from the first church
[59:47] age all the way through made it all so
[59:50] clear to understand uh it it put it in a
[59:53] greater perspective to see and with the
[59:56] opening of that it opened up the the the
[59:58] the Bible uh as you read the Bible it
[1:00:03] doesn't read the same anymore now I I
[1:00:06] could not I've made this statement
[1:00:08] before and people think I've been a
[1:00:09] little uh uh I don't know uly about it
[1:00:13] or something but I I I've always said
[1:00:15] that the seals did not make the Bible a
[1:00:17] new book to me because I've never known
[1:00:21] the scripture now we grew up in a
[1:00:22] Baptist Church of course I but I was
[1:00:24] eight or nine when we left I was
[1:00:26] uh I got baptized there or I got put in
[1:00:29] the water under Father Son and the Holy
[1:00:31] Ghost that was a baptism but anyway uh
[1:00:34] in the Baptist Church but I didn't know
[1:00:36] anything about it wasn't anything that I
[1:00:38] didn't read my my Bible I read some
[1:00:40] scripture like I said the one scripture
[1:00:42] I knew was John
[1:00:43] 3:16 uh I didn't know the scripture so
[1:00:46] the only way to my point the only way
[1:00:49] that I've ever known the scripture is
[1:00:52] through the prism of the seals right
[1:00:55] I've never known anything any other way
[1:00:57] so if you understand what my point is I
[1:01:00] didn't know it pre seals so if you
[1:01:04] didn't know it pre seals how could it
[1:01:06] become a new book post seals if all
[1:01:09] youve ever known is post
[1:01:11] seal for something to become new it had
[1:01:13] to be
[1:01:14] old but it was never old to me it was
[1:01:17] always I always I've always in my in my
[1:01:21] Christian walk have always read the
[1:01:23] scripture when I really got to reading
[1:01:25] and studying the Bible Bible it was
[1:01:27] through the prism of the seals being
[1:01:29] open praise through through the through
[1:01:32] the revelation of the seals it's always
[1:01:34] been that way so it never was a new book
[1:01:36] to me but that's what
[1:01:38] made the difference of the opening of of
[1:01:41] the tearing of those seals to open that
[1:01:44] book for by Revelation for us to be able
[1:01:47] to see it for God to reveal it to us
[1:01:50] amen amen and I've always seen it that
[1:01:53] way when I thought about thought that's
[1:01:55] that's a language that we speak that
[1:01:57] they don't that's a a language that we
[1:02:00] speak and how much of that there so many
[1:02:03] that uh I didn't mention of course we
[1:02:06] could for the next 15 minutes talk about
[1:02:09] the things that we discuss or that we
[1:02:11] use as language verbage as message
[1:02:13] Believers and the rest of the country
[1:02:15] doesn't the rest of the world doesn't
[1:02:16] the most the Christians don't use it
[1:02:19] they don't understand it don't know what
[1:02:21] are you talking about so you didn't even
[1:02:23] go try to explain it seven Church agents
[1:02:26] what about there's lot most Christian
[1:02:28] don't even know they don't even believe
[1:02:30] that church
[1:02:31] ages all they believe is that's why I
[1:02:34] put that in my book you know I had that
[1:02:36] about I had a little excerpt about that
[1:02:38] in my book and brother Dale who was one
[1:02:41] of the proof readers came back and uh he
[1:02:44] said you need to uh clarify this and I
[1:02:48] said why he said because if your aim is
[1:02:51] for this book not to just be for message
[1:02:54] Believers but for any Christian
[1:02:55] Christian or anybody that would help if
[1:02:58] they can believe and apply those
[1:02:59] principles would help their life then
[1:03:01] you need to explain this because a lot
[1:03:03] of Christians don't believe right in the
[1:03:05] seven Church a they do not believe in
[1:03:08] dispensationalism they don't believe
[1:03:10] that they believe that Ephesus and smia
[1:03:13] were just churches that were there in
[1:03:16] that place at that time not Church ages
[1:03:20] so if you go and read my book and I get
[1:03:22] to that point uh you'll see I explain a
[1:03:25] a little bit to try to draw it out so
[1:03:27] people understand about brother brandom
[1:03:31] and that that's actually the one place
[1:03:33] in my entire book I mentioned brother
[1:03:35] brand was about that because he was a
[1:03:37] dispensationalist Lin was a dispensation
[1:03:40] I I put their names in there as to
[1:03:44] clarify but a lot of people don't even
[1:03:46] know that see language that we have
[1:03:49] Oneness we are of Oneness to be of one
[1:03:52] the first thing remember God said the
[1:03:55] people is one amen that's the number one
[1:03:58] thing that's the number one most
[1:04:00] important thing is that we must unify
[1:04:04] under the same spirit amen now we unify
[1:04:08] when we come together for church like
[1:04:10] this yes we come together in body and in
[1:04:13] mind but a Oneness that he's talking
[1:04:16] about to be one with those from around
[1:04:19] the
[1:04:20] world that we may never see that we may
[1:04:23] never speak to that we may never never
[1:04:25] know we are one with them because we're
[1:04:29] one with the thing that we can be one
[1:04:31] under and that's his Spirit the Oneness
[1:04:33] of God to have all language we all speak
[1:04:35] the same
[1:04:37] language amen there I call it I don't
[1:04:40] mean this to be in a uh of of uh an
[1:04:44] arrogant way but but in the truth it's a
[1:04:48] message language amen we all have speak
[1:04:52] a message
[1:04:53] language and this they begin to do and
[1:04:56] now now but now what he said they're
[1:04:58] one because they're one they have one
[1:05:01] language they're have one
[1:05:03] mind
[1:05:05] nothing this is the Lord speaking this
[1:05:08] is God nothing will be restrain from
[1:05:12] them which they have imagined to
[1:05:15] do whatever that they have it in their
[1:05:19] heart and mind to do they will
[1:05:22] accomplish it now think about that and
[1:05:25] think about the limits that we place on
[1:05:27] ourselves right and think about the
[1:05:29] limits that we place in our in in our
[1:05:32] Unity even of the Brethren think about
[1:05:35] the limits that we place and don't say
[1:05:37] we don't CA we do right we shouldn't but
[1:05:40] we do yes and and and and recognize how
[1:05:45] those limits are now exploited through
[1:05:48] this
[1:05:49] scripture when we reach to the place of
[1:05:53] Oneness together amen you can look at it
[1:05:56] around the world brother Bram preached
[1:05:57] about Oneness and how the world's coming
[1:06:00] together Amen in a Oneness and it's
[1:06:03] becoming more and more clear as divided
[1:06:06] as we are there's more Oneness going on
[1:06:09] in the back door that you don't know
[1:06:11] about right coming and forming together
[1:06:14] under under a different ospice under a
[1:06:17] under
[1:06:18] a a religion if you will to to bring
[1:06:22] forth someone that forget Harrison Trump
[1:06:27] yeah there's one that's going to come
[1:06:29] forth here very shortly Saints it's
[1:06:31] going to that they will pair in
[1:06:33] comparison to what's about to happen of
[1:06:36] who's about to raise up in this world
[1:06:38] today right to take over amen that the
[1:06:42] entire world will be in Oneness towards
[1:06:45] that person but think about just
[1:06:47] something
[1:06:48] small
[1:06:50] uh I I I think about something as small
[1:06:54] as
[1:06:56] uh uh a sports Stadium or an
[1:07:00] auditorium uh it it takes a coming
[1:07:04] together of people to agree that they're
[1:07:07] going to spend their hundred bucks to
[1:07:10] make sure that this thing gets
[1:07:13] built and it takes a million of
[1:07:16] them of course my numbers are skewed of
[1:07:19] course takes way more than aund million
[1:07:21] to build a stadium or an auditorium like
[1:07:24] that anymore but
[1:07:26] the point to come together to
[1:07:30] agree I'm going to put myund I'm going
[1:07:32] to put my 100 I'm gonna put myund think
[1:07:35] about a million people would have to
[1:07:37] come together hypothetically with a
[1:07:40] hundred bucks to say I'm going to take
[1:07:43] myund and I'm going to put it towards
[1:07:45] building this Auditorium I'm G to build
[1:07:47] it towards building put it towards
[1:07:49] building this stadium and it takes a
[1:07:51] million of them and if a million of them
[1:07:53] get into one mind and into one Accord in
[1:07:56] one thought and they all put their hund
[1:08:00] in they can do what they say they're
[1:08:02] going to do and they do it and how many
[1:08:05] times do they do it around the world so
[1:08:10] just in a small sense people still if
[1:08:14] they get together and they become one
[1:08:17] and they have the same thought and the
[1:08:19] same goal and the same language they can
[1:08:23] accomplish anything they want to amen
[1:08:25] right take those limitations off Saints
[1:08:29] if God will withhold nothing from these
[1:08:31] people they will they will accomplish
[1:08:34] what they said they would accomplish
[1:08:37] what do you think that we can accomplish
[1:08:39] if we come into one of Mind One Rapture
[1:08:42] oh of course the Rapture would would be
[1:08:45] the culmination of what would happen in
[1:08:47] this bride that would just simply be an
[1:08:51] an accumulation a culmination if you
[1:08:53] will of of what would happen happen in
[1:08:55] this bride she would come forth with
[1:08:58] such power with such Authority with such
[1:09:01] strength there's not a demon in hell
[1:09:04] would know what to do with any one of us
[1:09:07] amen amen they say well uh we've got all
[1:09:10] these reinforced demons but I got I got
[1:09:13] the Bride of Jesus Christ with
[1:09:15] me and guess who's backing
[1:09:19] her praise God in the name of Jesus
[1:09:24] demon have to flee right praise God
[1:09:29] nothing would this my admission now my
[1:09:32] admonishment nothing would be withheld
[1:09:35] from this bride to do what she wants to
[1:09:37] do if she's in one mind one language one
[1:09:41] Accord right now I know it come now
[1:09:44] there's there's never been a time I I
[1:09:48] know the scripture that that that God
[1:09:50] purposely scattered Brothers God
[1:09:53] purposely brought division in Brothers
[1:09:55] to to send them out to to spread this
[1:09:59] gospel but there's never been a time
[1:10:03] ever scripturally or in the history of
[1:10:06] the world that we have like we have
[1:10:08] today because there's never been a time
[1:10:12] where this bride at this time needs to
[1:10:14] come together more than she ever has now
[1:10:18] amen this is not a time for separation
[1:10:22] this is not a time for disagreement this
[1:10:24] is not a time for separation this is a
[1:10:27] time for Oneness this is a time now it
[1:10:30] doesn't have to all be in the same
[1:10:32] building amen it doesn't have to because
[1:10:35] we've said that before God sets a
[1:10:37] five-fold Ministry and even in that
[1:10:39] five-fold Ministry he sets a pastor over
[1:10:42] here and a pastor over here and a pastor
[1:10:44] over there and each one of them has the
[1:10:46] specific calling and and and and
[1:10:49] training or upbringing or whatever that
[1:10:52] God can use through that person to help
[1:10:54] those people
[1:10:55] and then God sends them to those to to
[1:10:58] that church for that reason and
[1:11:01] unfortunately uh I think we probably
[1:11:03] been scattered way too much based on
[1:11:05] personalities and uh orators and uh how
[1:11:11] uh handsome somebody is or or how well
[1:11:14] of a speaker they are or because my
[1:11:16] family goes there or because my friends
[1:11:18] go there uh I think we've been a little
[1:11:21] too skewed as far as that part of it
[1:11:23] goes I think we should all just be wor
[1:11:25] God tells us to be regardless of how big
[1:11:28] small ugly poor Rich doesn't matter
[1:11:31] where is God want me to be CU that's
[1:11:33] where your spiritual growth is going to
[1:11:35] come be where God puts you right being
[1:11:38] where God put you is going to is where
[1:11:40] your spiritual growth is going to come
[1:11:42] from because God's going to put you in
[1:11:44] the right place at the right time with
[1:11:46] the right church and the right Pastor to
[1:11:48] bring that spiritual growth forth in
[1:11:50] your life that's God doing it amen not
[1:11:54] not because
[1:11:56] my best friend goes there or not because
[1:11:58] this person oh he speaks so much better
[1:12:01] or this person's really quiet and really
[1:12:04] s this person's really loud and and
[1:12:07] borous and and very emotional now which
[1:12:11] one meet people they generally tend to
[1:12:14] go over to the meek ones and the ones
[1:12:16] that's a little more emotional tend to
[1:12:17] go over to the emotional side amen why
[1:12:21] should doesn't even need to be that way
[1:12:23] sints being God tells you to be but in
[1:12:27] that we all come together as
[1:12:30] one as one one mind one Accord
[1:12:34] nothing nothing would be withheld from
[1:12:37] them which they imagined to do God help
[1:12:41] us to get to that place amen Nothing To
[1:12:45] Be Imagined I I I can't
[1:12:48] imagine that there's one
[1:12:51] single believer bride member around the
[1:12:54] world today
[1:12:56] that's not longing and Desiring a
[1:13:00] Rapture not one I I I I couldn't imagine
[1:13:04] there is
[1:13:07] um we talk about it often we pray about
[1:13:10] it many times Amen in our conversation
[1:13:14] many times how close it's got to be so
[1:13:18] on so
[1:13:19] forth I can't imagine any believer bride
[1:13:23] person around the world that that
[1:13:25] wouldn't be their first number one focal
[1:13:28] thought in their life remember what
[1:13:30] brother green always told us remember
[1:13:32] what brother Brown said Never Lose Your
[1:13:34] Enthusiasm for the coming of the Lord
[1:13:36] right seems to wne a little bit but
[1:13:38] that's the exhortation yes Never Lose
[1:13:41] Your Enthusiasm for the coming of the
[1:13:43] lord I can't believe there's one person
[1:13:46] that that wouldn't be something that's
[1:13:48] the focal point of their mind Lord just
[1:13:51] any day now just any day now and what
[1:13:55] would that do for all of us to come into
[1:13:57] that one Accord into that one mind into
[1:13:59] that one
[1:14:01] place nothing would it be imagine what
[1:14:04] we believe could be done God what in
[1:14:07] other words the only way that God could
[1:14:09] stop them was to change their language
[1:14:12] well he's not going to do that to us no
[1:14:14] I mean he's the one that created the
[1:14:16] language he's the one that give us the
[1:14:18] language he's the one that sent it to us
[1:14:20] through a prophet so he's not going to
[1:14:22] change our language amen our language is
[1:14:25] is going to stay the same praise the
[1:14:27] Lord in a Oneness now so then what what
[1:14:30] do we look to we look to oh a a place of
[1:14:34] Oneness we look to a a a position of
[1:14:38] coming into that that one mind amen that
[1:14:42] one mind let's go over to uh Acts
[1:14:45] chapter
[1:14:51] 2 Acts chapter
[1:14:54] 2 let me read you this the Easter seal
[1:14:56] in Phoenix April
[1:15:00] 65 notice the Pentecostal people up
[1:15:03] there when they had got quickened by the
[1:15:05] Holy Spirit he said listen to me when
[1:15:08] those Pentecostal group up there on the
[1:15:10] dead Pentecost received their abstract
[1:15:13] Deed from God sure it glorified their
[1:15:16] souls they screamed they saw tongues of
[1:15:19] fire separated upon each of them and it
[1:15:22] so quickened their body praise the Lord
[1:15:26] it so quickened their body till they
[1:15:29] couldn't even speak in an Earthly
[1:15:31] language
[1:15:33] anymore praise the Lord it so quickened
[1:15:37] their Earthly body that they could not
[1:15:40] speak in an Earthly language anymore it
[1:15:42] quickened their body to a Heavenly
[1:15:45] language praise the Lord the place they
[1:15:47] were going to we are quickened then by
[1:15:50] the power of the Living God tongues
[1:15:53] quickened into a new Heavenly language
[1:15:56] to speak to them a rapturing up raising
[1:16:00] up into a different atmosphere than what
[1:16:03] with then where we've ever lived also
[1:16:05] with the new quickening life to come to
[1:16:07] them uh to come in them it quickened
[1:16:10] their language quickened their language
[1:16:12] they spoke in new tongues oh yes look it
[1:16:15] quickened their bodies until they flew
[1:16:17] so close to Heaven till it quickened
[1:16:19] their body to speak in a new language
[1:16:21] they had never heard
[1:16:23] before it quickened their bodies they
[1:16:25] spoke in a new Heavenly language they
[1:16:28] were quickened into the presence of God
[1:16:30] by the baptism of the Holy Ghost God
[1:16:33] quickening power baptized them into that
[1:16:37] they were they were in the place of
[1:16:39] worship then they were where they could
[1:16:41] worship the sadrin or nothing else could
[1:16:44] bother them because they were quickened
[1:16:46] they were new
[1:16:48] people that after they were of course
[1:16:51] quickened by the spirit of God Acts
[1:16:53] chapter 2 now I want to read read
[1:17:00] this one mind
[1:17:04] Oneness when the day acts
[1:17:07] 2:1 when the day of Pentecost was fully
[1:17:11] come they were all with one Accord in
[1:17:15] one place one Accord in one place now
[1:17:18] they two one one place amen
[1:17:22] understanding now I it's not lost on me
[1:17:27] that it is would be easier uh a lot of
[1:17:30] times to come into one mind if you are
[1:17:34] in one
[1:17:37] place but if the spirit of God is the
[1:17:41] same in Marisha as it is in
[1:17:45] Tucson how could that if it's the same
[1:17:49] and and I obviously use that if Loosely
[1:17:51] because we know it is the same there's
[1:17:54] it is here here how would it not be the
[1:17:56] same then to do the same to bring us
[1:18:00] into the same place of Oneness of one
[1:18:04] mind amen even though they were there
[1:18:06] because remember up to this point that
[1:18:09] Spirit had never been given this is the
[1:18:12] first initial uh uh uh giving of God
[1:18:16] giving his Spirit to the people on them
[1:18:19] in them the spirit of God Jesus Christ
[1:18:23] coming into the individual first time so
[1:18:27] for them to be in one place was
[1:18:30] important for them because they all
[1:18:32] received it in that one place at one
[1:18:34] time right they were in one Accord but
[1:18:37] the number one thing they were with all
[1:18:40] they were all with one
[1:18:42] Accord amen they were all of One mind
[1:18:45] they were one praise the Lord suddenly
[1:18:49] now when they became into now I I would
[1:18:54] venture to get yes when the 120 got
[1:18:57] there they didn't all all of a sudden
[1:19:01] come into one mind and want
[1:19:03] to it didn't I don't I don't think it
[1:19:06] happened the second they walked through
[1:19:08] the door right right right right they
[1:19:10] were they were there together they
[1:19:13] fellowshipped they talked they
[1:19:16] reminisced I guess crucifixion of Christ
[1:19:20] all the things that Christ had done
[1:19:22] while he was here and and all the things
[1:19:25] that brought them together as one see
[1:19:27] the problem a lot of times we have is
[1:19:29] that we fixate too much on the things
[1:19:31] that divide us rather than the things
[1:19:33] that bring us together amen that's right
[1:19:36] and we we fixate too much on the
[1:19:39] differences rather than the similarities
[1:19:42] and of course that's the devil's job uh
[1:19:45] Satan's job is to break Unity his number
[1:19:48] one thing that he desires to accomplish
[1:19:50] in US is to break us apart that's the
[1:19:53] number one thing he wants to do
[1:19:55] so what does he do he does his very best
[1:19:58] to try to help us to or cause us to
[1:20:01] fixate on the 1% that we disagree
[1:20:06] on instead of instead of focusing on the
[1:20:11] 99% that we agree on Amen even as people
[1:20:16] even as
[1:20:18] humans I I believe it's the same way I
[1:20:21] hear all the time you hear about
[1:20:23] political uh stuff out in the political
[1:20:25] with the election coming up and and and
[1:20:29] everything is about how horrible the
[1:20:31] other person
[1:20:32] is uh and in instead of and and and
[1:20:37] people get that and think well you know
[1:20:41] this person must be a
[1:20:43] devil uh probably I don't have any
[1:20:46] evidence of this but probably so much so
[1:20:48] a young kid climbing on a roof and triy
[1:20:49] to shoot one of
[1:20:51] them uh when you hear this stuff over
[1:20:54] and over again it takes a effect right
[1:20:57] but when it boils right down to it and
[1:21:01] you talk to people what do people want
[1:21:05] they want to be healthy they want to
[1:21:07] have money they want to be able to
[1:21:09] provide for their family they they maybe
[1:21:12] want to have a savings they want to be
[1:21:15] safe they want to be able to walk down
[1:21:17] the street and feel like they're not
[1:21:19] going to be murdered or shot in the head
[1:21:21] or or raped or
[1:21:23] whatever you break it right down to the
[1:21:27] core thing that most people in this
[1:21:29] country want and it's all the same right
[1:21:33] really but it's become so fixated on the
[1:21:36] things that divide rather than the
[1:21:38] things that bring together amen of
[1:21:40] course this country turned God down uh
[1:21:43] 70 some odd years ago now so we
[1:21:46] understand what's going on there but uh
[1:21:49] but as far as the bride is concerned the
[1:21:51] devil's going to do everything he can to
[1:21:52] try to cause us us to uh to fixate on
[1:21:57] the things that are different rather
[1:21:58] than the things that bring us together
[1:22:00] yes amen praise the Lord and I and again
[1:22:04] I think the things that bring us
[1:22:05] together are far more numerous than the
[1:22:07] things that would separate us yeah look
[1:22:11] I don't believe they walked in there and
[1:22:12] all of a sudden bam there it is right
[1:22:14] they barely get their seats and the
[1:22:16] spirit Falls no no I believe they were
[1:22:19] there they were praying they were
[1:22:21] fasting they were talking they were
[1:22:23] talking about God they were talking
[1:22:25] about Christ they were talking about all
[1:22:27] the Miracles and the things that he
[1:22:29] preached to us and my you remember that
[1:22:31] sermon he oh yeah I remember that God
[1:22:34] you remember when that he touched that
[1:22:37] one his eyes came up yeah he put mud in
[1:22:39] there how in the world could that have
[1:22:40] happen you just start talking about the
[1:22:42] Lord and then the Lord come on the scene
[1:22:44] how many times that ever happened in
[1:22:46] your life you really you start talking
[1:22:48] about the Lord and all of a sudden he's
[1:22:50] there amen praise the Lord that's just
[1:22:53] God I believe that happened here now
[1:22:57] suddenly then there came a sound from
[1:22:59] Heaven as a rushing Mighty Wind filled
[1:23:01] all the house where they were sitting
[1:23:03] praise God seeing the Oneness that's
[1:23:06] what I pray for every time we have a
[1:23:07] church service amen amen is that
[1:23:10] experience right there fill all this
[1:23:13] house right here where we're sitting
[1:23:16] amen because that's a
[1:23:18] Oneness praise the lord and there
[1:23:21] appeared unto them clothing tongues like
[1:23:23] as the fire and it sat upon each of them
[1:23:25] and they were all filled with the Holy
[1:23:28] Ghost and began to speak with other
[1:23:30] tongues like brother man was just saying
[1:23:32] as the spirit gave them utterance now
[1:23:34] let's drop down to the 37th verse let's
[1:23:36] see what the result
[1:23:41] is
[1:23:44] amen I remember telling me remember me
[1:23:46] telling you the other day the story
[1:23:48] about those Brothers after right after
[1:23:50] church one of them was the one that
[1:23:52] preached the other was a minister too
[1:23:55] and and just fussing and fussing and
[1:23:56] fussing the whole time we were there
[1:23:58] fussing and fussing people looking at us
[1:24:00] gotten so loud people were looking
[1:24:01] thinking my these people just came from
[1:24:03] church they don't act like Christians
[1:24:06] and and and I'm thinking but the entire
[1:24:09] time they spent they spent the entire
[1:24:12] dinner talking about things that
[1:24:13] separated
[1:24:14] them
[1:24:16] yeah I I I never went to ministers
[1:24:20] meetings because I always heard that the
[1:24:24] things that come up are the things that
[1:24:26] divide us the things that we disagree
[1:24:29] about now I believe we should all be
[1:24:31] able to come together and reading
[1:24:32] together absolutely I don't have a
[1:24:34] problem with that but when it becomes
[1:24:35] argumentative and it becomes
[1:24:37] boisterously over of one place or the
[1:24:39] other and then I heard when I was going
[1:24:41] back to visit my mom my brother there
[1:24:43] started a
[1:24:44] breakfast uh Tuesday mornings I forgot
[1:24:48] when it was anyway uh a Brother's
[1:24:51] breakfast Minister's breakfast and AD
[1:24:53] ministers come in and there would be
[1:24:56] ministers come in from time to time or
[1:24:58] one brother he came quite often and we
[1:25:01] knew what he believed and it was
[1:25:03] completely contrary to uh uh pretty much
[1:25:08] the rest of us but most of the time very
[1:25:11] rarely did it ever get to the place at
[1:25:14] that time that's why I kept going
[1:25:15] Michael went a few times that's why I
[1:25:17] kept going because it was just a nice
[1:25:19] breakfast we just talked about the Lord
[1:25:21] and we talked about the message and we
[1:25:22] talked about things that unifies and
[1:25:24] that we agree together and love one
[1:25:26] another and uh hug one another's neck
[1:25:29] and and that kind of thing but every
[1:25:31] once in a while something would come up
[1:25:32] and a little a little bur would get in
[1:25:34] somebody's saddle and all of a sudden
[1:25:35] there they go and they talk about well
[1:25:38] you know brother Braham said this and
[1:25:39] brother Braham said that and I'm
[1:25:40] thinking how are you ever going to
[1:25:41] convince this person it's got to take
[1:25:44] God Amen it's got to take God to reveal
[1:25:47] to them pray for them that's the number
[1:25:49] one thing we can do pray for them when
[1:25:52] they go in their own time and they're
[1:25:54] studying and they're praying and they're
[1:25:56] asking God for deliverance and guidance
[1:25:58] God can show it to them it's not if I
[1:26:01] can convince them that I'm right still
[1:26:03] doesn't do them any good right Amen
[1:26:06] brother bam
[1:26:07] said I can almost guarantee you in a lot
[1:26:11] of cases not every case that the guy on
[1:26:14] the other side has as many brother
[1:26:16] brandom saids as you do yes trust me
[1:26:19] I've been through it 30 some odd years
[1:26:21] of ministering friends I've been through
[1:26:23] it I know I've seen a lot of people I've
[1:26:25] met a lot of brothers I've seen been to
[1:26:28] a lot of message uh meetings and uh uh
[1:26:32] uh ministers meetings and church me I
[1:26:34] I've seen it from North Carolina to
[1:26:36] Florida to West Virginia to Tucson and
[1:26:38] all around trust me I've been there I
[1:26:43] know that's the thing all the time that
[1:26:47] people fuss
[1:26:48] about
[1:26:50] amen why don't you believe it like this
[1:26:53] well but brother Bram said well you know
[1:26:55] well brother brandham said this over
[1:26:59] here yeah but I believe what he said
[1:27:01] here more than what he said over there
[1:27:02] no no you can't do that right amen cuz
[1:27:07] what he's saying here doesn't contradict
[1:27:09] what he said over there that's right
[1:27:11] amen there might be a new light on it
[1:27:13] that the lord gave him over the time of
[1:27:15] his ministry that's right amen because
[1:27:17] there are some of those things but you
[1:27:20] you can't as much as the devil tries to
[1:27:24] make make it contradict it doesn't amen
[1:27:26] nor does it contradict the scripture nor
[1:27:28] does the the scripture contradict itself
[1:27:31] but that's the thing that people will
[1:27:32] focus on no when Oneness comes look 37th
[1:27:37] verse Acts
[1:27:39] 2:37 after all that that God did now
[1:27:43] when they heard this they were pricked
[1:27:45] in their hearts and said unto Peter and
[1:27:47] to the rest of the Apostles men and
[1:27:49] Brethren what shall we
[1:27:51] do then Peter said unto them repent and
[1:27:54] be baptized every one of you in the name
[1:27:58] of Jesus
[1:28:00] Christ Jesus Christ not some titles but
[1:28:05] be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:28:09] for the remission of sins and ye shall
[1:28:12] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[1:28:15] praise the Lord for that promise is to
[1:28:19] you and to your children and to all that
[1:28:23] are far off off even as many as the Lord
[1:28:26] Our God shall call now that just pretty
[1:28:28] much encompasses any human that draws a
[1:28:30] breath amen whomever God calls wherever
[1:28:34] they are whoever they are whatever
[1:28:36] Nation religion tongue whoever God can
[1:28:39] bring each one of them and how do we
[1:28:42] come together with them in this same
[1:28:46] because we receive the same Holy
[1:28:49] Ghost we receive the same Holy Ghost as
[1:28:52] they receive that's the Holy Ghost is
[1:28:54] not going to treat them over there
[1:28:56] different than he's treating us right
[1:28:59] the Holy Ghost is not going to treat
[1:29:00] that church down the street any
[1:29:02] different than he's treating us it's the
[1:29:04] same Holy Ghost and it's a God that does
[1:29:07] not
[1:29:08] change praise the Lord and with many
[1:29:11] other words did they did he testify and
[1:29:14] exhort saying save yourselves from this
[1:29:16] unw toward UNT
[1:29:19] generation then they that gladly
[1:29:21] received his word were baptized and the
[1:29:23] same same day they were added unto them
[1:29:26] about 3,000 souls and when's the last
[1:29:29] time you've been to a church service
[1:29:31] where 3,000 people were added that
[1:29:34] day in one
[1:29:36] sermon one message I've been in some
[1:29:40] good services for him but I've never
[1:29:41] seen 3,000 at one time I've seen couple
[1:29:45] dozen maybe maybe even up to 50ish or so
[1:29:49] be baptized at one time but never have I
[1:29:52] ever seen now maybe there's some
[1:29:54] overseas or something that goes this
[1:29:56] different than here but 3,000 in one
[1:30:01] message praise the Lord we'd have to
[1:30:05] build a new church really quick wouldn't
[1:30:07] we I don't think 3,000 people fitting
[1:30:10] here and they continued steadfastly in
[1:30:13] the apostles Doctrine and fellowship in
[1:30:15] a Breaking of bread and in prayer and
[1:30:18] fear Came Upon every soul and and Many
[1:30:21] Wonders and signs were done by the
[1:30:23] apostles and all that believed were
[1:30:25] together and had all things common
[1:30:29] praise the Lord that be beautiful God
[1:30:32] was up there now and God was here now
[1:30:35] say the same thing about us amen not
[1:30:38] just this church not just a city you
[1:30:42] know all over the
[1:30:43] world have all things
[1:30:47] common praise the
[1:30:49] Lord nothing nothing would be withheld
[1:30:52] from us nothing
[1:30:54] nothing would be off limits nothing
[1:30:56] would be out of reach that we would be
[1:30:58] able to do as a bride nothing amen we
[1:31:02] would talk about a Rapture amen praise
[1:31:04] the
[1:31:06] Lord they had all things common sold
[1:31:09] their possessions Goods parted them to
[1:31:11] all men so every man had need as every
[1:31:14] man had need and they continued daily
[1:31:17] with one Accord in the temple breaking
[1:31:20] bread from house to house to eat their
[1:31:22] meat with gladness and singleness of
[1:31:23] part praising God having favor with all
[1:31:26] the people and the Lord added to the
[1:31:28] church daily such as should be saved
[1:31:31] amen what an exhortation
[1:31:35] friend as much as God sent brother
[1:31:38] brandom to break down denominational
[1:31:42] barriers there were probably more
[1:31:44] denominational barriers after he left
[1:31:47] than when he was first
[1:31:49] came not his no fault of his that's
[1:31:52] right I mean brother bam even he even
[1:31:54] quit the field one time he's like the
[1:31:57] harder I preach and the more I go the
[1:32:00] worse the people get right yes I I
[1:32:03] scream and yell about bobhair women next
[1:32:06] time I go to the same place there's more
[1:32:07] of them than the were last time I was
[1:32:09] here right not not a fault of his did
[1:32:13] his duty but there's probably more
[1:32:15] division than even when he came and the
[1:32:19] one thing one of the focuses he had was
[1:32:22] to tear down those denominations
[1:32:25] walls
[1:32:27] amen praise the Lord and and I don't and
[1:32:30] look I'm not talking about denomination
[1:32:32] walls I'm not talking about Methodist
[1:32:34] walls I'm not talking about Catholic
[1:32:36] walls or Pentecostal walls I'm talking
[1:32:38] about message walls message denomination
[1:32:41] walls that's right amen because there's
[1:32:46] tons of denominational message walls
[1:32:50] yeah in this
[1:32:52] message let me finish by by reading
[1:32:55] this now this is a beautiful quote I've
[1:32:58] read this quote many
[1:33:00] times a total Deliverance
[1:33:04] 1957 he should he said that should be
[1:33:07] the motive of every Christian in every
[1:33:10] person in in the church is for to unify
[1:33:14] ourselves and stick
[1:33:16] together whatever the church vote for
[1:33:19] that's what we should stand for then say
[1:33:22] for instance that they want to change
[1:33:24] something in the church well then if
[1:33:26] trustees wants to or somebody else wants
[1:33:28] to deacons they want to change something
[1:33:30] come before the church and the church
[1:33:32] then
[1:33:33] together and if it's our idea here seems
[1:33:36] to be a little different than what the
[1:33:39] whole church wants or does let's
[1:33:42] sacrifice our idea because that's the
[1:33:46] only way we can stand
[1:33:49] United
[1:33:52] amen too many many times that thing
[1:33:55] sticks in a person I never wanted it
[1:33:58] that way to begin
[1:34:00] with amen instead of letting forgetting
[1:34:03] about just letting whatever it is your
[1:34:06] mind your thought your IDE Let It Go yes
[1:34:09] and come because it's the greater
[1:34:13] good amen if they weren't in one if they
[1:34:16] weren't one at the Tower of Babel and
[1:34:19] one says well I think we should use this
[1:34:20] the other says well I think we should
[1:34:21] use this well we should we should have
[1:34:23] it go this way instead of that way we
[1:34:25] should go this High instead of that high
[1:34:26] it should be this wide instead of that
[1:34:28] white and they just fuss and complain
[1:34:30] how God would have never had a reason to
[1:34:32] come down and say they're going to do
[1:34:34] what they want to do no they were one
[1:34:37] they had come together as one no doubt
[1:34:39] they were humans they had different
[1:34:41] ideas different opinions of things just
[1:34:44] like we all do
[1:34:45] today different ideas opinions amen but
[1:34:49] we sacrifice that brother R's talking
[1:34:51] about sacrif if I had brother Adam even
[1:34:54] said if I have a different idea I'm just
[1:34:56] one vote brother Adam said that I'm just
[1:34:59] one vote he said if my idea is different
[1:35:02] I sacrific that amen for the good of the
[1:35:05] church now if he had thus sayith the
[1:35:07] Lord that's something totally different
[1:35:09] amen thus sayith the Lord uh is is
[1:35:12] instruction from God not just an opinion
[1:35:15] or a thought amen now he says let's
[1:35:19] sacrifice that idea because that's the
[1:35:21] only way we can stand United and and if
[1:35:24] this
[1:35:25] church will just go on the way you're
[1:35:28] going now and be United together God
[1:35:31] will it is
[1:35:33] unlimited what God will do if we just
[1:35:37] stick
[1:35:38] together now that's what he's talking
[1:35:40] about of that church of there speaking
[1:35:42] in brandom Tabernacle it's unlimited
[1:35:46] what God will do with this church if we
[1:35:50] just stick
[1:35:51] together amen I I believe that's the
[1:35:54] same thing he's talking about the
[1:35:56] scripture how many we read two places
[1:35:59] now that we have
[1:36:02] that the unity of the people brought
[1:36:06] about results the unity at the Tower of
[1:36:10] Babel Unity on the day of Pentecost
[1:36:13] brought about results positive results
[1:36:17] of God on the day of Pentecost because
[1:36:20] that's when the spirit fell after they
[1:36:23] were in one mind yeah they came in one
[1:36:26] mind in one Accord and then the spirit
[1:36:29] fell on them now I asked them what would
[1:36:32] happen what would it be not just our
[1:36:35] church we could say our church brother
[1:36:36] Bram said brandom Tabernacle there we'd
[1:36:39] say the same thing for our church the
[1:36:42] greater vision of that then is in our
[1:36:44] little portion we do that as a
[1:36:47] congregation and our little portion to
[1:36:50] give what about the other Church down
[1:36:52] the street and the one uh the other
[1:36:54] nations and and the bride around the
[1:36:56] world
[1:36:58] right that come together now it's not a
[1:37:01] matter of saying okay I think we need a
[1:37:03] new air conditioner yeah that's a good
[1:37:04] idea let's vote on it I think we have a
[1:37:06] little money in the in the offering
[1:37:08] Let's uh uh let's get a you a new air
[1:37:11] conditioner nothing like that we're
[1:37:12] talking spiritual the thing that brings
[1:37:16] the results in our lives and as a bride
[1:37:20] spiritually that means the most amen air
[1:37:24] condition is nice to have especially in
[1:37:25] Tucson uh but that doesn't bring the
[1:37:29] spiritual results we look for and desire
[1:37:32] more the spiritual result than anything
[1:37:34] else now if we do that around the world
[1:37:37] it is an unlimited I will use brother
[1:37:40] bram's words around the world it is
[1:37:43] unlimited what God will do for all of us
[1:37:47] internationally around the world Amen
[1:37:51] people think well we we need a we we
[1:37:53] need a new Revival let's let let's just
[1:37:56] all come and have some meetings oh
[1:37:59] that's good but I tell you friend i'
[1:38:01] I've been I've been in thousands of
[1:38:04] meetings literally thousands of meetings
[1:38:08] special speakers if you will people
[1:38:11] coming together by the tens and by the
[1:38:13] hundreds even by the I've been in
[1:38:15] meetings where they've been by the
[1:38:17] thousands and have meetings together you
[1:38:20] think well that's wonderful
[1:38:24] what more on that can we
[1:38:26] do let's have prayer meetings oh that's
[1:38:29] great people have prayer meetings that's
[1:38:30] good I think brother po I'm going to be
[1:38:33] out of town but brother PO is having a
[1:38:34] Brother's prayer
[1:38:36] breakfast and God bless him that's
[1:38:39] wonderful those that can do that but now
[1:38:42] what
[1:38:43] do where do the results come
[1:38:48] from
[1:38:51] where there's it there has to be
[1:38:55] something you say well that that that's
[1:38:58] all we can do I I beg to differ yeah
[1:39:04] uh there there's so much more that can
[1:39:07] be done outside of just coming together
[1:39:11] to to pray together and have a breakfast
[1:39:13] that's wonderful though that's good I'm
[1:39:15] glad that's uh the brothers doing that
[1:39:17] that's uh God bless him for
[1:39:22] that but where is the true together this
[1:39:26] the true Unity the true Oneness the true
[1:39:30] one mind and one Accord the true the the
[1:39:33] true part of of of forgetting about the
[1:39:38] differences and coming together as a
[1:39:40] bride coming together as a church coming
[1:39:43] together under our common language amen
[1:39:47] our common mind of I tell you a friend
[1:39:51] personally a a Rapture is not going to
[1:39:53] happen until that takes
[1:39:55] place that's just a bottom line a
[1:39:57] Rapture is not going to happen until
[1:39:59] that takes place right so God help us
[1:40:01] all around the world amen amen and God
[1:40:05] helped me to work on forgetting about
[1:40:07] the things that divide and concentrate
[1:40:09] on the things that you unify that bring
[1:40:13] us together amen we do that as a church
[1:40:16] we do that as a bride we do that
[1:40:18] internationally Amen in our city in our
[1:40:21] state around the world amen help me help
[1:40:25] us to do our part Amen to bring that
[1:40:29] Unity to reality amen let's stand if we
[1:40:33] could the world's coming together under
[1:40:36] that Oneness
[1:40:39] yes amen the world's coming and unifying
[1:40:43] together under that Oneness I believe
[1:40:44] it's a bride's time it's not this not

[1:40:48] time this is our time that's

[1:40:54] of course once the bride's gone she'll
[1:40:56] she'll have a time that's for sure uh

[1:41:01] in but they're going to have a
[1:41:03] time uh it's going to be a time all
[1:41:05] right but uh I want to be I I want to be
[1:41:10] together with
