[34:50] amen take any prayer requests anyone
[34:52] might have
[34:53] amen i'm guessing there's none over
[34:55] there buddy didn't see any either
[34:57] praise the lord i had one prayer request
[34:59] that came up yesterday at the minister's
[35:01] meeting
[35:03] found out i guess it happened a little
[35:05] while ago but i did not know about it
[35:07] but i found out yesterday that brother
[35:09] michael patterson had a stroke
[35:14] he had gone through
[35:16] uh some physical ailments and some
[35:19] situations in his body apparently it was
[35:21] the front left lobe that excuse me that
[35:23] was affected
[35:25] but those of you know about mike
[35:27] patterson pastors in peoria up in the
[35:30] phoenix area
[35:32] he's getting up in age but he's a
[35:35] fine brother
[35:37] very good brother i've enjoyed brother
[35:39] mike's ministry but he had a stroke but
[35:42] like i said it's been from what i was
[35:44] told it's been a little a few months ago
[35:46] uh he's and he's recuperating and doing
[35:50] a lot better
[35:51] uh but it seems like and it sounds like
[35:54] my brother tom weathers yesterday that
[35:56] brother mike is going to resign the
[35:58] church that he's pastoring there
[36:00] i don't think he had a lot of people but
[36:02] that's not
[36:04] relevant really
[36:05] if a man calls god calls a man he calls
[36:08] him in is the end of it no matter where
[36:11] his family or one person or a thousand
[36:13] doesn't matter he calls him he calls him
[36:16] but um
[36:18] but it sounds like brother mike is
[36:21] going to be resigning the church there
[36:23] uh up in peoria so please remember him
[36:26] in prayer if you would family those
[36:28] affected with brother mike fortunately
[36:30] like i said it seems like he's he's
[36:32] doing well and getting a lot better and
[36:34] his motor skills are okay and his speech
[36:37] is okay so
[36:38] we're very thankful for that but please
[36:40] keep brother mike in your prayer if you
[36:41] would
[36:42] i'll mention and
[36:44] well i'll just go ahead and mention it
[36:47] because brother mike patterson
[36:50] again at this point
[36:52] looks like he's resigning the church
[36:54] uh they're selling everything that's in
[36:57] the church
[36:58] uh so
[36:59] i told brother tom i said well we're
[37:01] very interested in the sound system so
[37:04] uh we may get a sound system uh from if
[37:07] brother
[37:08] mike does end up liquidating uh the
[37:11] assets of the church he has pews organ
[37:14] things like that so
[37:16] i asked brother tom if you've just taken
[37:18] inventory things that they have but
[37:20] we're most interested in the sound
[37:21] system the lord will provide that
[37:24] uh it might be a provision the lord is
[37:26] making for us to be able to have the
[37:28] sound system that we've been looking for
[37:30] needing so
[37:31] amen appreciate brother roger letting us
[37:33] use the one that he has but um
[37:37] i really
[37:39] really should get it back to him because
[37:41] it's there he doesn't need it they're
[37:43] still in the hotel room right now but
[37:44] they are looking for a facility to rent
[37:47] uh so if they do he'll definitely need
[37:49] it so
[37:51] but
[37:52] keep that in your prayers too if you
[37:53] will that's the lord's will and god
[37:55] provides for it then that's what his
[37:56] perfect will is and then praise the lord
[37:59] um also from last sunday brother rick
[38:03] ellis i mentioned
[38:04] about the heart situation he did go
[38:06] through the surgery tuesday and came
[38:08] through it well and he's doing good so
[38:11] thank the lord for that
[38:12] amen anyone have an unspoken request on
[38:15] your heart
[38:16] amen lord knows all hearts to stand if
[38:18] we could
[38:22] praise the lord take these needs to the
[38:24] lord and all the
[38:26] unspoken and
[38:28] just trust the lord and his blessings in
[38:30] our lives brother dennis could you pray
[38:32] for him

[39:59] anything we go through it's been said
[40:02] already the enemy is fighting harder
[40:04] than ever before i just read in your
[40:07] word father that their the gospel was
[40:11] preached to all but some did not receive
[40:14] it because it wasn't mixed with faith
[40:17] and father that can also be us we can

[41:31] uh seeing god you know if we're living
[41:35] that life correct us lord if we go
[41:38] astray father as the prophet saw the
[41:42] bride in preview the bride tore the end
[41:45] and she came around one more time she
[41:48] was getting out of line don't let
[41:50] worldliness get ahold of us will that
[41:53] carnality rule us don't let the world
[41:57] sin be a part of our lives fathers help
[42:01] us lord we want to be a bride that is
[42:04] ready and bless each one as their hearts
[42:08] have been lifted up to you grant them
[42:10] the desires of their heart may their
[42:13] hearts burn within them as they know
[42:15] they met with you along the way may the
[42:18] testimonies come forth you're still
[42:21] alive you're still with your people you
[42:24] will not leave us nor forsake us you'll
[42:27] be with us to the end father in your
[42:30] name we pray in the name of the lord
[42:32] jesus christ amen amen amen praise the
[42:36] lord you can be seated if you like
[42:39] amen
[42:41] if you
[42:42] i'm sure notice we they got the the
[42:44] errors working
[42:47] uh it's not fixed
[42:50] uh they had to hardwire it
[42:52] uh around the thermostat
[42:55] so we operated with the breaker back
[42:57] there so it's on or off
[43:00] but i have found since i've been here
[43:02] yesterday and then this morning
[43:04] that it does
[43:06] obey the temperature on the thermostat
[43:09] so
[43:10] i've been standing here i've been
[43:12] feeling it coming on and going off it
[43:14] continuously blows
[43:16] but when the compressor kicks in it gets
[43:18] cold and then when it reaches that
[43:20] temperature i guess it kicks off so uh i
[43:22] told brother dennis if if we do get uh
[43:27] cool if it gets cold uh he can get up
[43:30] and flip the breaker off so that it just
[43:32] stops but so far it seems like it's
[43:35] doing okay to where
[43:36] uh when it gets to that temperature i
[43:39] put it on 72 when it gets to that
[43:41] temperature the compressor turns off so
[43:43] it's just blowing air so it doesn't get
[43:46] too cold so hopefully prayerfully uh
[43:48] it'll work that way now he's still
[43:50] working on it they're going to fix it
[43:51] right the way it's supposed to be but
[43:53] for today i just thought i'd mention
[43:55] that to you if it's something that uh
[43:58] uh
[43:58] that gets to that point if i see people
[44:00] starting to uh
[44:02] freeze then i was gonna let brother
[44:04] dennis know to turn the breaker off but
[44:07] so far it seems to be okay is everybody

[53:03] it'll become pretty evident here in just
[53:05] about two minutes who requested that
[53:07] song
[53:09] you probably already know now
[53:11] since i said that
[53:16] amen yes i am the one that requested
[53:18] that mike has sing that song praise the

[53:37] praise the lord saint john chapter 5.
[53:45] had a little trouble with my voice this
[53:47] weekend
[53:48] spent over four hours crawling around in
[53:51] an attic thursday and friday and
[53:53] uh insulation just gets to you after a
[53:56] bit i wore a mask so
[53:58] don't get mad at me i wore
[54:00] a surgical mask inside and inside out so
[54:03] backwards so that uh you know surgical
[54:06] masks protect what goes out of your
[54:08] mouth because they're to be used in
[54:10] sterile environments so they don't want
[54:12] anything coming out of your mouth into a
[54:14] sterile environment but i turned it
[54:16] around so nothing would come in
[54:19] but
[54:19] the insulation's just
[54:22] it's just tough it's three foot probably
[54:25] two and a half three foot high and we
[54:27] had to run every single wire in the
[54:29] attic to make sure because they had mice
[54:32] that were eating the wires and our job
[54:34] was to fix all the wires that the mice
[54:36] had eaten so i had to climb through and
[54:39] crawl through all the wires and the
[54:41] insulation
[54:43] so i think it i think it did a little
[54:45] bit of a number on my voice
[54:47] uh but um
[54:49] but i'm thankful the lord still have a
[54:51] voice amen to worship him with so saint
[54:54] john chapter 5 before we read the word
[54:56] can we give our heads for another word
[54:58] of prayer
[54:59] precious jesus we are very thankful
[55:02] again today of their love your grace
[55:04] your mercy the blessings you give us
[55:06] every day father for another beautiful
[55:08] sunday morning resurrection sunday
[55:10] morning god that you give us we don't
[55:12] just celebrate it on easter like a lot
[55:14] of the world does a lot of christendom
[55:16] does but we celebrate it every day of
[55:19] our lives but of course we come here on
[55:21] sunday morning and we celebrate as we
[55:23] gather together with those of like
[55:25] precious faith and expecting you to meet
[55:27] with us here once again
[55:29] lord we know that you
[55:31] come everywhere you're invited you stay
[55:34] wherever you're welcome and we pray god
[55:36] that the worship of our lips the praise
[55:38] from our heart lord was a welcoming and
[55:40] inviting lord spirit for you to dwell in
[55:43] for you to be here and to feel
[55:46] like you're welcome here lord with us
[55:48] yes you said you'd never leave us or
[55:50] forsake us but we're praying and
[55:52] trusting you to manifest that spirit to
[55:54] us here real right now god in this place
[55:58] god may you touch every heart of every
[55:59] life strengthen us draw us closer to you
[56:02] more like you may your word go forth and
[56:05] empower and manifestation and do what
[56:07] you have preordained for this service
[56:10] for each one of us here today
[56:12] we rebuke every demonic spirit that we
[56:14] try to hurt hindu or infiltrate this
[56:16] service in any way that you would get
[56:18] the glory honor and praise for all this
[56:20] said and done and trusting you again
[56:22] lord that your word will not return void
[56:24] but accomplish that that you purposed it
[56:27] to accomplish here today we committed to
[56:29] you we thank you for those that have
[56:30] come lord and for you most of all and
[56:33] pray that your holy spirit will have
[56:35] preeminence now the remaining part of
[56:37] this service is we committed and
[56:38] dedicated completely into your hands in
[56:40] the name of the lord jesus christ we
[56:42] pray amen amen
[56:45] amen saint john chapter 5
[56:47] i'll just read a verse of scripture here
[56:49] and then let you be seated
[56:53] praise the lord let's go down to uh
[56:56] verse six this place that uh
[57:00] kind of where the
[57:02] song came from when jesus saw him lie
[57:05] and knew that he had been now a long
[57:08] time in that case
[57:10] he saith unto him wilt thou be made
[57:12] whole
[57:13] the impotent man answered him sir i have
[57:15] no man when the water is troubled to put
[57:18] me in the pool into the pool but while i
[57:21] while i am coming another stepeth down
[57:23] before me
[57:24] jesus said unto him rise up
[57:27] rise take up thy bed and walk and
[57:30] immediately the man was made whole and
[57:33] took up his bed and walked uh
[57:36] and on the the same day was the sabbath
[57:39] let's drop down to
[57:43] verse 14
[57:45] afterward jesus findeth him in the
[57:47] temple and saith unto him behold thou
[57:51] art made whole
[57:52] sin no more lest a worst thing come upon
[57:56] thee unto thee amen you can be seated if
[57:59] you like
[58:01] amen i want to i want i want to read
[58:04] this entire story
[58:06] at least to that point that we finished
[58:08] up here
[58:11] um but i just
[58:13] you know to keep you standing so long
[58:16] uh i just figured i would read the sort
[58:18] of the parts that we're looking to here
[58:19] now just a simple thought of something
[58:21] the lord had put on my heart the other
[58:23] day to to bring to you here
[58:26] and recognizing and i thought
[58:29] actually whoever wrote the song that
[58:31] mike is saying was inspired
[58:33] it speaks very much to me about what
[58:35] this uh story is about
[58:38] and the situation that we fall in that
[58:40] we find a lot in humanity today
[58:42] especially in this country maybe not so
[58:44] much in other countries i'm not sure but
[58:47] in this country we have that happening
[58:49] but uh
[58:52] the one thing it seems like that a lot
[58:54] of people
[58:55] are shirking today or pushing off or not
[58:58] wanting to deal with is
[59:00] the responsibility
[59:03] i was listening to a message brother
[59:04] branham was uh talking about and going
[59:07] into nicoletanism a little bit and and
[59:10] the thought of that came on my heart
[59:12] even stronger and when i see
[59:14] the things that's going on in the world
[59:16] today and then i look at the scripture
[59:18] and then i look sometimes at our own
[59:20] lives and
[59:22] and things it kind of strikes to
[59:24] recognize that
[59:27] it's become a
[59:29] it seems like again in this country a
[59:31] wholesale laziness
[59:34] and i say that because
[59:37] it seems like people are becoming
[59:39] less inclined for responsibility and
[59:42] that's what actually
[59:45] happens to
[59:46] a lot of people i believe that that even
[59:49] end up homeless
[59:50] a lot of the homeless people some of
[59:52] them of course i know have drug
[59:55] addictions or mental
[59:57] issues and things like that but i've ran
[59:59] across and seen where a lot of people
[1:00:02] that
[1:00:03] and some people that i've talked to even
[1:00:06] that they
[1:00:07] they just don't want the responsibility
[1:00:10] of living what we would consider a
[1:00:13] normal everyday life
[1:00:15] getting up on when we're supposed to get
[1:00:17] up going to work or supposed to go to
[1:00:20] work have a boss that tells you what to
[1:00:22] do earn an income and a living and pay
[1:00:24] your bills and be responsible
[1:00:27] a lot of them just don't want to do that
[1:00:30] they don't want the responsibility that
[1:00:32] comes with that kind of a life so they
[1:00:35] would just prefer live out on the street
[1:00:37] and
[1:00:38] live under a bridge and just eat what
[1:00:40] they can eat and beg what they can get
[1:00:42] from and and that's how they live their
[1:00:44] lives and there's no responsibility to
[1:00:46] that it reminded me when brother branham
[1:00:48] was talking about that when i was
[1:00:50] listening to it the other day about that
[1:00:52] nicolaitanism and you know it came to me
[1:00:54] again and i've said this before that
[1:00:56] nicolaitanism is a very easy religion
[1:01:00] it's a very easy thing to follow there's
[1:01:02] really very minimal responsibility now
[1:01:05] there are duties that you have to
[1:01:07] perform but there's little
[1:01:09] responsibility because all the
[1:01:11] responsibility is put on the hierarchy
[1:01:14] all the responsibility is put on the
[1:01:16] people that are in charge all the people
[1:01:18] that are following along that are under
[1:01:20] this spirit all they have to do to feel
[1:01:23] like they're right is to obey whatever
[1:01:25] that person is telling them to do you do
[1:01:27] this and you're okay do the hail mary's
[1:01:30] and it's okay confess in the booth it's
[1:01:32] okay and you the repentance and the
[1:01:35] purgatory
[1:01:36] it's an easy religion we'll pray for you
[1:01:38] we'll uh we'll do all the prayers we'll
[1:01:41] do all the reading we'll tell you what
[1:01:43] the bible says you don't need to know
[1:01:44] what the bible says and for many years
[1:01:47] through the dark ages the catholic
[1:01:49] church held the scripture from the
[1:01:51] common man
[1:01:52] for that reason to keep control over
[1:01:54] them but it
[1:01:56] but but it but it becomes a very easy
[1:01:59] spirit to fall into
[1:02:01] it becomes and people become complacent
[1:02:04] they become lazy uh not content now
[1:02:08] again we've talked about that that's a
[1:02:09] different thing but complacency and and
[1:02:12] lazy
[1:02:13] lazy and religion lazy and how they do
[1:02:15] and what they do and how they act and uh
[1:02:18] and they just they don't want to take on
[1:02:21] the responsibility
[1:02:23] but life in itself is a responsibility
[1:02:27] everything about life is a
[1:02:28] responsibility and the sad part of it is
[1:02:31] as a christian and in the christian
[1:02:34] faith
[1:02:35] uh
[1:02:36] you you have to revert back to it to
[1:02:39] being a child
[1:02:41] to not have responsibility because the
[1:02:43] children are the ones the little babies
[1:02:45] of course have no responsibility as they
[1:02:47] get older they gain a little more
[1:02:49] responsibility and a little more
[1:02:50] responsibility till you become an adult
[1:02:53] and then when you become an adult you
[1:02:54] become accountable
[1:02:56] uh you have to be accountable for your
[1:02:58] life you have to be accountable to the
[1:03:00] things that you do and that you say
[1:03:02] and of course before god as a christian
[1:03:05] we're accountable for every word that we
[1:03:07] say in every thought that we think yes
[1:03:09] we're responsible to those things but as
[1:03:11] a human
[1:03:13] uh
[1:03:14] we have job responsibilities
[1:03:16] we have home responsibilities uh
[1:03:20] money
[1:03:21] bills
[1:03:23] uh as you grow up schools and and and
[1:03:26] families and and you have to buy clothes
[1:03:29] and have to eat and uh all those
[1:03:32] responsibilities
[1:03:34] uh get piled up now you know joel sit
[1:03:37] back there listening to me very intently
[1:03:39] but he just turned eight doesn't have to
[1:03:42] worry about the power bill his mommy and
[1:03:45] daddy do
[1:03:46] amen that's their responsibility not his
[1:03:48] responsibility he doesn't even think
[1:03:50] about it doesn't concern himself with it
[1:03:52] if he get hot he might turn the
[1:03:54] thermostat down to 50.
[1:03:57] run 24 7
[1:03:59] 800 power bill he doesn't care it's not
[1:04:01] his responsibility
[1:04:03] and but you understand
[1:04:07] that's the attitude that a lot of people
[1:04:08] have it's not my responsibility
[1:04:11] and
[1:04:12] i don't mean to continue to harp back on
[1:04:14] this because i know they're not all that
[1:04:16] way but um
[1:04:18] but if you go
[1:04:20] many times and zac tafta across the wash
[1:04:23] over there they kind of have a homeless
[1:04:25] haven back there there's several
[1:04:27] encampments they've been run off and
[1:04:29] they come back and then run off and come
[1:04:30] back and but when you go to where they
[1:04:32] were i was coming to me and roger
[1:04:34] returning or maybe it was just me anyway
[1:04:37] oh miracle mile and right there at the
[1:04:39] railroad tracks people they they camp
[1:04:42] there and they come they kick them out
[1:04:44] it's inside a fence they're not supposed
[1:04:45] to be right next to the railroad tracks
[1:04:47] they'll come and kick them out but then
[1:04:48] they come back and they kick them out
[1:04:50] and come back but every time they kick
[1:04:52] them out and they leave and you can tell
[1:04:54] when they leave because their
[1:04:55] encampments cleaned out their tents are
[1:04:57] gone and that there's just
[1:04:59] a horde of trash the size of this church
[1:05:02] left in the wake of those people
[1:05:05] but it it
[1:05:07] and i've seen it like that
[1:05:09] one time we went to california if you in
[1:05:12] certain places and uh
[1:05:14] and i just say california probably sure
[1:05:17] it's a lot of other places we went into
[1:05:19] a walmart
[1:05:20] and you go in we went into this walmart
[1:05:23] to look for some clothes and stuff is
[1:05:25] just scattered everywhere
[1:05:28] we literally i don't know if mike and
[1:05:29] tapped this when they were younger
[1:05:31] remember this we walk this walmart
[1:05:33] clothes are scattered everywhere
[1:05:35] they're not folded on the shelves
[1:05:37] there's probably almost as many clothes
[1:05:39] on the floor as there is on the shelves
[1:05:43] there's stuff strong everywhere
[1:05:46] because people
[1:05:48] don't take the responsibility
[1:05:50] if you take a piece of clothing off the
[1:05:53] shelf fold it back and put it the way
[1:05:55] you found it people don't care about
[1:05:57] that i actually literally watched a
[1:05:59] woman take some clothes that were nice
[1:06:02] clothes off the shelf that were folded
[1:06:04] neatly and put them up she didn't like
[1:06:06] it just throw it on the floor oh my
[1:06:08] goodness oh somebody also pick it up
[1:06:11] it's their responsibility
[1:06:14] but the sad part
[1:06:16] i saw that i mean you see this today my
[1:06:19] wife when somebody just grabbed arm
[1:06:21] loads of stuff and walked out the door
[1:06:23] you know it's somebody else's
[1:06:25] responsibility somebody else will pay
[1:06:27] the bill
[1:06:28] and that's the attitude a lot of people
[1:06:30] have but unfortunately it seems to bleed
[1:06:34] over into
[1:06:35] into christianity and into
[1:06:38] uh the mindset of of us
[1:06:41] even
[1:06:42] when you think about the necessity of
[1:06:46] having the responsibility a lot of
[1:06:48] people uh
[1:06:50] don't want information they don't want
[1:06:52] to know something
[1:06:53] because as soon as you know something
[1:06:56] you're responsible to what you know
[1:06:59] if you know the correct
[1:07:01] way of being baptized you're responsible
[1:07:04] to go get baptized according to that
[1:07:06] scripture right
[1:07:08] if you know it now if you don't know of
[1:07:09] course now there's there's no god
[1:07:12] doesn't weak at ignorance anymore so
[1:07:13] there's no excuse anyway
[1:07:16] but a lot of people just don't ask
[1:07:18] because they don't want to know
[1:07:20] they don't want the responsibility
[1:07:22] it's just it's just it's
[1:07:24] to me it reverts back to a wholesale
[1:07:26] laziness people just don't they just
[1:07:29] don't want to have
[1:07:31] any more responsibility than they have
[1:07:33] to have
[1:07:34] but as an adult
[1:07:36] especially as a christian friend and
[1:07:39] recognizing our responsibility isn't
[1:07:42] just to the person paying the bill or
[1:07:45] the person cleaning the floor our
[1:07:47] responsibility is to god amen he sees
[1:07:50] everything he knows everything and that
[1:07:53] is our responsibility now look at this
[1:07:56] story
[1:07:57] i'm going to read it again but let's
[1:07:59] look at this story
[1:08:02] after the after this there was a feast
[1:08:04] the jews jesus went up to jerusalem
[1:08:07] there is that jerusalem by the sheep
[1:08:09] market a pool which is called the hebrew
[1:08:11] tongue bethesda having five porches
[1:08:14] and these lay a great multitude of
[1:08:17] impotent folk a blind halt withered
[1:08:20] waiting for the moving of the water now
[1:08:22] you understand that that's all they had
[1:08:25] that's all they could do
[1:08:27] they people would literally bring
[1:08:30] others up to set there and wait
[1:08:34] or have somebody there waiting with them
[1:08:37] for the moving of the water and when the
[1:08:39] water moved when that angel come and
[1:08:41] moved that water for healing they would
[1:08:43] grab them and put them in the pool
[1:08:46] so that they could be healed so that
[1:08:48] they could be well and
[1:08:50] the bible says it was a great multitude
[1:08:53] of these people
[1:08:55] empty folk blind halt withered waiting
[1:08:58] for the moving of the water for an angel
[1:09:00] went down a certain season into the pool
[1:09:02] and troubled the water whosoever then
[1:09:04] first after the troubling of the water
[1:09:06] stepped in uh was made whole of what
[1:09:10] whatsoever disease he had
[1:09:12] and a certain man was there which had an
[1:09:14] infirmity 38 years like the song says
[1:09:17] 38 years when jesus saw him lie
[1:09:21] he knew that he had been now a long time
[1:09:24] in that case he said unto him strange
[1:09:27] question
[1:09:29] will thou be made whole
[1:09:32] in other words i guess the psalm they
[1:09:34] changed the verbiage do you want to be
[1:09:37] well
[1:09:38] do you want to be well
[1:09:40] and see that becomes a question it's a
[1:09:42] very
[1:09:43] pertinent question to me to understand
[1:09:47] do you really want to be well because
[1:09:49] see do you understand now you've been
[1:09:52] laying in this condition 38 years it
[1:09:54] doesn't say from his birth but it does
[1:09:57] say 38 years so we don't know how long
[1:09:59] that is and we do know that jesus went
[1:10:02] to this man specifically
[1:10:05] multitudes around this pool
[1:10:08] and the healer
[1:10:10] god the healer
[1:10:12] stepped around
[1:10:13] walked over and around no telling how
[1:10:16] many people to get to this one man
[1:10:19] none of them were healed
[1:10:21] god didn't tell to any of them at least
[1:10:23] not according to the scripture
[1:10:25] he walked all around all the other
[1:10:27] people just to get to this one man
[1:10:29] and but then when he got to him he said
[1:10:32] do you want to be well right will thou
[1:10:35] be made whole
[1:10:37] because you understand
[1:10:39] now i'm going to paraphrase this coming
[1:10:41] from me in this message
[1:10:43] do you understand now that your halt
[1:10:46] lame you can't even get up to get to the
[1:10:49] pool before somebody else has gotten
[1:10:51] there you've got nobody to help you but
[1:10:54] you understand
[1:10:56] now when you're able to walk and you
[1:10:59] have perfect health in your body you've
[1:11:02] got responsibility for that
[1:11:05] amen
[1:11:08] you're not going to lay here and beg
[1:11:09] arms anymore right you're not gonna this
[1:11:12] is not gonna be your life anymore right
[1:11:15] you you have responsibility you've gotta
[1:11:17] get a job
[1:11:19] you've gotta go to work
[1:11:20] you've gotta make a living you've gotta
[1:11:23] have a house
[1:11:24] you gotta have uh uh bills to pay food
[1:11:28] clothing
[1:11:29] you don't just sit there and wait for
[1:11:30] somebody to hand it to you anymore
[1:11:33] you've gotta get up and go do it
[1:11:35] people sometimes get so lazy and so
[1:11:38] complacent
[1:11:40] that they say one thing but they really
[1:11:43] don't want it
[1:11:44] right
[1:11:45] because it brings on responsibility
[1:11:48] they like their lives the way they are
[1:11:50] they like living the way they live they
[1:11:52] like to have uh uh everything handed to
[1:11:56] them or give to them or feel sorry for
[1:11:58] them or whatever they don't they don't
[1:12:00] really want to be well
[1:12:02] and i believe that's one of the
[1:12:04] questions jesus is asking do you even
[1:12:06] really want to be well
[1:12:08] because if you are well now it's going
[1:12:10] to change your life
[1:12:12] amen
[1:12:14] you're going to have to go to work
[1:12:16] you're going to have to fend for
[1:12:17] yourself you're going to have to do for
[1:12:19] yourself you're going to garner upon
[1:12:21] yourself more responsibility you've ever
[1:12:23] known in your life or so do you really
[1:12:25] want this
[1:12:27] do you want to be well and the
[1:12:29] responsibility that was given to him
[1:12:31] jesus laid on him later as we read
[1:12:34] jesus said well thou be made whole if
[1:12:37] the man answered him sir i have no man
[1:12:39] when the water is troubled to put me
[1:12:41] into the pool but while i am coming
[1:12:43] another step it down before me
[1:12:46] jesus said unto him rise take up thy bed
[1:12:48] and walk i believe jesus reached out
[1:12:50] pulled him up and he received stream
[1:12:53] amen
[1:12:55] took up his bed and and left the place
[1:12:58] and immediately the man was made whole
[1:13:01] and took up his bed and walked on that
[1:13:03] same day was the sabbath jews therefore
[1:13:06] said unto him that was cured
[1:13:08] it is the sabbath day it is not lawful
[1:13:10] for thee to carry thy bed he answered
[1:13:12] them uh he that made me whole the same
[1:13:16] the same said unto me take up thy bed
[1:13:18] and walk
[1:13:19] then asked him
[1:13:21] they him
[1:13:22] what man that which is said unto thee
[1:13:25] take up thy bed and walk
[1:13:27] and he and he that was healed was not
[1:13:29] who it was for jesus had conveyed
[1:13:31] himself away a multitude being in that
[1:13:34] place
[1:13:35] afterward jesus findeth him again we
[1:13:38] read this now afterward jesus findeth
[1:13:40] him in the temple and said unto him
[1:13:44] behold you're now well
[1:13:46] behold thou art made whole
[1:13:50] sin no more
[1:13:52] lest the worst thing
[1:13:54] come upon thee
[1:13:56] now
[1:13:57] over what a responsibility this man
[1:14:00] received by receiving that healing
[1:14:03] he received a great responsibility in
[1:14:05] his life
[1:14:07] he received responsibility for what
[1:14:09] jesus had told him
[1:14:10] and and and implored him even remember
[1:14:12] the woman who is found uh in the very
[1:14:15] act of adultery
[1:14:17] even she was found in the act of
[1:14:19] adultery they were chasing her down to
[1:14:21] stone her to death
[1:14:23] she ran into jesus
[1:14:25] and jesus began to write they begin to
[1:14:27] tell him all her sins
[1:14:29] you know he said well you without sin
[1:14:32] you cast the first on then you're
[1:14:34] telling me all about her sin what about
[1:14:36] your sin
[1:14:37] if you don't have any sin you can you
[1:14:39] can kill her
[1:14:41] throw us and and as she rode on the
[1:14:43] ground all of them began to drop their
[1:14:44] stones and walk away
[1:14:47] he said looked up he said well now where
[1:14:49] are thine accusers she said lord i have
[1:14:52] none
[1:14:53] and he said neither do i condemn thee
[1:14:56] praise the lord
[1:14:57] go
[1:14:58] and sin
[1:14:59] no more
[1:15:01] god had liberated her
[1:15:03] god had delivered her from her sin god
[1:15:06] had set her free from being put to death
[1:15:08] by them but god told her
[1:15:12] go and sin no more
[1:15:15] don't you go do that again don't live
[1:15:17] that life anymore
[1:15:18] the responsibility that you now have
[1:15:21] from this liberation i have set you free
[1:15:24] but now you have a responsibility and
[1:15:27] that is to live the life that is that is
[1:15:29] godly appropriate life
[1:15:32] sin no more
[1:15:33] don't go do what you've been doing i did
[1:15:35] not set you free just so you could go
[1:15:38] back into that man's bed
[1:15:40] i set you free so that you can be
[1:15:43] liberated to live the right kind of life
[1:15:45] amen amen and a lot of people had that
[1:15:48] that stigma
[1:15:50] that
[1:15:51] in their in their lives that they look
[1:15:53] at and they think
[1:15:55] do i do i really want this
[1:15:58] amen because remember the bible says to
[1:16:00] whom much is given
[1:16:02] much is required
[1:16:05] amen to whom much is given much is
[1:16:08] required right so it's to think well god
[1:16:11] did this great thing yeah but now what
[1:16:13] is he requiring
[1:16:16] but see the requiring is not what people
[1:16:19] want they just want the benefits of it
[1:16:22] without the responsibility and it
[1:16:24] doesn't happen that way
[1:16:26] it doesn't come that way
[1:16:28] if you want the blessing if you want the
[1:16:31] deliverance if you want the healing you
[1:16:33] have to be willing to accept the
[1:16:35] responsibility that comes with it right
[1:16:38] amen
[1:16:40] and that responsibility is a lot of
[1:16:42] things that people don't want to live up
[1:16:43] to today oh somebody else will do it
[1:16:45] somebody else will take care of it
[1:16:47] that's somebody else's problem
[1:16:50] everything that happens all around us as
[1:16:52] human beings is all of our problems yes
[1:16:56] amen throw a styrofoam cup in the in the
[1:16:58] wash oh that that's somebody else's
[1:17:01] problem that'll get washed up somebody
[1:17:02] will get it eventually
[1:17:05] well what if everybody in this city
[1:17:07] threw a styrofoam cup into santa cruz
[1:17:12] saying oh it'll be somebody else's
[1:17:13] responsibility then what happens
[1:17:17] it becomes a nasty cesspool
[1:17:20] and that's a position a lot of times
[1:17:22] people's lives end up in they end up in
[1:17:24] a nasty cesspool and they get a lot of
[1:17:26] attention people get a lot of attention
[1:17:29] sometimes oh we're in that uh bad
[1:17:32] situation and get a lot of attention
[1:17:36] uh
[1:17:38] but then
[1:17:39] then it makes you wonder with with all
[1:17:41] of this coming now this is this is
[1:17:43] really
[1:17:45] maybe not even borderline narcissism
[1:17:47] this is just flat out narcissism
[1:17:50] but
[1:17:51] we know that the world is neurotic
[1:17:52] brother adam told us the whole back 60
[1:17:54] years ago was neurotic right amen the
[1:17:57] narcissism is just it's the it's the
[1:18:00] flavor of the day if you will in the
[1:18:02] world today narcissism has just taken
[1:18:05] over and it's gotten to that place
[1:18:08] it's been amplified by social media
[1:18:12] but that's in the world i'm talking
[1:18:14] about us
[1:18:15] i'm talking about godly christians
[1:18:18] i'm talking about people that sometimes
[1:18:21] and i'm not talking about here
[1:18:23] but i have seen
[1:18:25] that makes me wonder this person asks
[1:18:28] for something but then they don't really
[1:18:32] present themselves like that's what
[1:18:34] they're wanting or expecting right
[1:18:37] and it makes you wonder why
[1:18:40] why if they if they're asking for this
[1:18:42] deliverance or whatever it is and then
[1:18:44] they don't
[1:18:46] their their demeanor doesn't make you
[1:18:48] feel like they that's something they're
[1:18:50] really looking for they just want a
[1:18:52] little sympathy or a pat on the back or
[1:18:55] give them a dollar or two or something
[1:18:57] then
[1:18:58] what is
[1:19:00] because they don't want because they
[1:19:01] don't want to change they don't want the
[1:19:03] responsibility of change
[1:19:06] and that then that becomes uh a
[1:19:09] wholesale thing that they have that they
[1:19:11] that some people they just don't want it
[1:19:13] they become so complacent
[1:19:16] they'll tell you oh yes i want this i
[1:19:18] want this deliverance whatever but then
[1:19:20] when they go back they're like well you
[1:19:22] know
[1:19:23] it's just like witnessing to people to
[1:19:25] be christians
[1:19:27] people don't want the responsibility of
[1:19:29] what it takes to live the life of a
[1:19:31] christian
[1:19:33] some people say well i
[1:19:35] you know i i just don't know if i can i
[1:19:37] said well you just have to surrender it
[1:19:39] to the lord and let him do it for you
[1:19:41] amen that's the best thing you can do
[1:19:43] right because none of us can live it but
[1:19:45] he can live it through us yes but it's
[1:19:47] the yielding of that
[1:19:49] but they're unwilling to give up
[1:19:52] what they have to give up
[1:19:54] to have what they need to be pleasing to
[1:19:57] the lord well if i'm going to be a
[1:19:58] christian then i have to i have to act
[1:20:01] like this and talk like this and live
[1:20:03] like this and wear those clothes and let
[1:20:04] my hair and blah blah blah and you know
[1:20:06] and now everything's all superficial
[1:20:08] look at it and it becomes
[1:20:11] uh they don't want the responsibility
[1:20:14] but see they don't understand the
[1:20:16] responsibility in that case when we give
[1:20:18] our lives to the lord the responsibility
[1:20:20] is not mine it's his
[1:20:23] it's his to live through me
[1:20:25] now it's mine to take care of the part
[1:20:27] that the lord that that i would be
[1:20:30] obedient to that and and
[1:20:33] it just makes you wonder sometimes do
[1:20:35] are people like that do they really want
[1:20:38] that responsibility
[1:20:40] now in acts chapter 3.
[1:20:47] acts chapter 3.
[1:20:50] we'll read this story
[1:20:52] acts chapter 3 verse 1.
[1:20:58] amen that's why a lot of times today
[1:21:01] people don't want to live up to the
[1:21:02] truth
[1:21:03] they don't want to face the truth
[1:21:05] people don't even want to hear the truth
[1:21:08] because the truth makes them responsible
[1:21:11] right the truth a lot of times if now
[1:21:14] remember i'm going to ask the shoe fits
[1:21:16] wear preacher so
[1:21:18] if it fits you you wear it whether
[1:21:20] you're watching or whatever
[1:21:22] but
[1:21:23] if
[1:21:24] if that puts you in in the place of
[1:21:27] being responsible for it
[1:21:30] do you really want it or do you not
[1:21:34] i think that was the bottom line
[1:21:35] question that god jesus asked the man in
[1:21:38] the pool of bethesda
[1:21:40] do you really want to
[1:21:43] people say they do i want to be a
[1:21:46] christian
[1:21:47] but do you want the responsibility that
[1:21:49] comes with being a christian
[1:21:51] with being a godly holy ghost filled
[1:21:54] living
[1:21:55] a godly life do you really want to be a
[1:21:57] christian and
[1:21:58] and people
[1:22:00] it's like i've said before people want a
[1:22:02] savior but they don't want a lord
[1:22:05] they want somebody to save them they
[1:22:07] want to feel like they've been saved
[1:22:09] scoured and that's what nicolaitan gives
[1:22:11] to people
[1:22:13] nicolaitan gives that religion gives a
[1:22:15] covering that people can feel they're
[1:22:18] okay
[1:22:20] when the bottom line is they've they've
[1:22:23] entered into a place that they feel okay
[1:22:26] with no responsibility
[1:22:28] well that doesn't work with god
[1:22:31] the relationship is not with a pastor or
[1:22:33] a priest or church it's with god
[1:22:37] and it's up to you
[1:22:38] to live that life
[1:22:40] and to read and to pray and to do the
[1:22:42] responsibility that it takes to be the
[1:22:45] person you're supposed to be
[1:22:48] a lot of people just don't want that
[1:22:50] they're not willing to take that
[1:22:53] amen and don't want to know the truth
[1:22:56] they don't want to know the truth the
[1:22:57] truth makes them responsible
[1:22:59] you know you know pilate tried that
[1:23:01] trial pilate tried his best to sure
[1:23:04] shift the responsibility of jesus
[1:23:06] standing in front of him
[1:23:08] right
[1:23:09] probably the worst day he may not have
[1:23:11] known it but the worst day of pilate's
[1:23:12] life is when they drug jesus to his
[1:23:14] front doorstep
[1:23:15] that's probably the worst day of his
[1:23:17] life
[1:23:18] because he didn't know what to do with
[1:23:19] him he tried to wash his hands of him
[1:23:22] but he couldn't do it
[1:23:24] i washed my hands i'm clean of the blood
[1:23:26] of this man no you're not
[1:23:29] because you had the power you had the
[1:23:31] responsibility you could let him go but
[1:23:34] you chose not to
[1:23:36] you can't wipe your hands of it and
[1:23:37] that's the same a lot of people oh i'll
[1:23:39] wipe my hands so you can't do that
[1:23:43] it's it falls on you it is your
[1:23:46] responsibility to take that up for
[1:23:48] yourself
[1:23:51] but people don't want to do it what they
[1:23:53] don't realize is by saying oh i don't
[1:23:55] want the responsibility and they push it
[1:23:57] off the responsibility still lays on
[1:24:00] them the responsibility still stops here
[1:24:04] it still stops with us
[1:24:06] regardless of whether we want to face it
[1:24:07] or not it's still ours right and in the
[1:24:10] eyes of god it's still ours yes
[1:24:13] acts chapter 3 verse 1. now peter and
[1:24:16] john went up together into the temple at
[1:24:18] the hour of prayer being the ninth hour
[1:24:22] and a certain man laying from his
[1:24:24] mother's womb was carried whom they laid
[1:24:27] they laid him they carried him and laid
[1:24:29] him at the gate of the temple which is
[1:24:31] called beautiful to ask arms of them
[1:24:33] that entered into the temple now this
[1:24:35] man we know by the scripture was this
[1:24:37] way from his mother's womb
[1:24:40] from birth he was like this
[1:24:43] who's seeing peter and john about to go
[1:24:45] into the temple aston alms that was his
[1:24:47] daily chore that's that's what he did
[1:24:50] and peter fastening his eyes upon him
[1:24:52] with john said look on us
[1:24:56] and he gave head unto them expecting
[1:24:58] receive something of them
[1:25:00] then peter said silver and gold have i
[1:25:02] none but such as i have i give thee give
[1:25:06] i thee in the name of jesus christ of
[1:25:09] nazareth rise up and walk
[1:25:11] and he took him by the right hand
[1:25:13] lifted him up and immediately his feet
[1:25:17] and ankle bones received strength
[1:25:20] and he leaping
[1:25:22] up
[1:25:23] stood
[1:25:24] and walking entered with him into the
[1:25:26] temple walking and leaping and praising
[1:25:29] god into the temple
[1:25:31] praise the lord that showed some
[1:25:33] character
[1:25:34] he didn't just get healed and jump and
[1:25:37] shout and run off home
[1:25:39] he went into the temple to praise the
[1:25:41] lord
[1:25:42] he went into the temple to praise god
[1:25:43] from whom his healing just came
[1:25:46] amen so this man
[1:25:49] received that
[1:25:51] he took that responsibility now i'm not
[1:25:54] sitting here anymore i'm doing what i'm
[1:25:56] supposed to do
[1:25:57] i'm going into the temple i'm going to
[1:25:59] go worship the lord
[1:26:02] walking into the temple walking leaping
[1:26:05] and praising god
[1:26:07] you know sometimes i know it's it's to
[1:26:10] the place that a person receives healing
[1:26:12] and
[1:26:13] i think sometimes it depends on their
[1:26:15] faith but that they uh
[1:26:17] need to get their strength in their legs
[1:26:20] they haven't walked before this man
[1:26:21] never walked he's like this from his
[1:26:23] mother's womb
[1:26:25] but when when immediately when that
[1:26:28] power of god struck that man he leaped
[1:26:31] up on his feet and he ran into the
[1:26:33] church
[1:26:34] this man never run in his life
[1:26:37] he never jumped in his life
[1:26:39] he never leaked he didn't know what
[1:26:41] leaping was except maybe to have seen
[1:26:43] somebody else but as soon as he got
[1:26:46] strength
[1:26:47] immediately he was leaping up and down
[1:26:49] jumping running dancing
[1:26:51] praise the lord
[1:26:53] he didn't say oh now let let me wait and
[1:26:56] see
[1:26:57] this
[1:26:59] is this going to work there's this
[1:27:01] no he just started jumping and dancing
[1:27:03] leaping and running to church to praise
[1:27:05] the lord amen amen
[1:27:08] and all that came with it
[1:27:09] all the people saw him walking and
[1:27:11] praising god and they knew that it was
[1:27:14] he uh
[1:27:16] they knew that it was he which set from
[1:27:18] the beautiful gate of the temple they
[1:27:20] were filled with wonder and amazement at
[1:27:22] that which had happened unto him
[1:27:24] praise the lord but what he did
[1:27:26] he went to praise god he did first what
[1:27:30] the most important thing is that you do
[1:27:32] amen you praise the lord now this man
[1:27:35] could have sat there and he could have
[1:27:37] said you know i i'm content where i'm at
[1:27:40] just give me some money
[1:27:43] i don't want the responsibility of going
[1:27:45] in the temple
[1:27:46] or living my life or having to go get a
[1:27:48] job tomorrow or any of that just give me
[1:27:50] some money that's all i want
[1:27:53] and it's the same thing i had a guy one
[1:27:55] time we lived in north carolina the guy
[1:27:57] came up to the door knocked on the door
[1:27:59] and he said uh do you have any money and
[1:28:01] i said yeah i got some money
[1:28:03] he said well could i have some i said
[1:28:05] well no
[1:28:06] i said but i got a i have a pile of wood
[1:28:09] in the backyard back here that i just
[1:28:10] cut down and and chopped up if you'll
[1:28:13] bring them and put them in the garage
[1:28:14] here for me i'll pay you oh have a nice
[1:28:16] day
[1:28:19] and he walked off he
[1:28:20] anyone do anything and he looked like a
[1:28:23] perfectly
[1:28:24] perfectly healthy specimen of a man he
[1:28:26] didn't look like in the invalid or
[1:28:28] anything he looked like he was perfectly
[1:28:30] well to work i said no you go and i'll
[1:28:32] pay you i'll give you uh money if you'll
[1:28:34] move this over for me wouldn't do it
[1:28:38] amen i
[1:28:39] i don't know uh you hear sometimes
[1:28:42] people say that but do they really mean
[1:28:44] it right
[1:28:45] do they do they really mean what they
[1:28:47] said my wife said one time she said i'm
[1:28:49] just gonna go out here and i'm gonna put
[1:28:50] up a sign that says i want all your
[1:28:51] money
[1:28:53] and see how many people give me money no
[1:28:56] god bless you no
[1:28:58] veteran no
[1:28:59] not just just give me your money
[1:29:03] and just see how many people give them
[1:29:04] money i i she probably probably would
[1:29:07] still do it give me all your money now
[1:29:09] without a gun of course give me one and
[1:29:11] see how many would do it
[1:29:13] you might still do it i don't know
[1:29:15] but
[1:29:16] that's all that
[1:29:18] a lot of people want and that's all that
[1:29:21] a lot of people want out of
[1:29:22] religion it's just a covering that's all
[1:29:25] they want out of it
[1:29:27] all all they
[1:29:29] people become so narcissists that all
[1:29:31] they want is is the compliments is the
[1:29:34] is the is the sorrowfulness is the uh
[1:29:38] the money that's given to them or
[1:29:40] something like that that's all they want
[1:29:42] they they don't want the responsibility
[1:29:44] of what they need to get and i'm afraid
[1:29:48] that a lot of times now this this isn't
[1:29:51] all of course
[1:29:52] uh
[1:29:53] there's obviously genuine
[1:29:55] needs and sicknesses and things but
[1:29:58] i just ran across people again i'm not
[1:30:00] talking about here but i ran across
[1:30:03] people that they
[1:30:04] that you talk to them about something
[1:30:07] and you you just get the understanding
[1:30:09] the feel they really don't want to
[1:30:11] change
[1:30:12] yes they really don't want to be healed
[1:30:15] they really don't want their perfect
[1:30:17] health back
[1:30:19] they're not they're not concerned with
[1:30:21] playing a game of basketball or football
[1:30:23] or golf or they're not concerned with
[1:30:26] lifting a 50 pound weight or climbing
[1:30:28] into an attic or under a
[1:30:30] under a trailer they're not concerned
[1:30:31] about that
[1:30:33] they don't care about that
[1:30:35] so
[1:30:37] in retrospect they're just happy the way
[1:30:39] they are
[1:30:42] they just live their lives and
[1:30:45] get what they can get out of it and they
[1:30:47] really don't want to be changed
[1:30:50] they really don't want to
[1:30:51] they don't want to be well
[1:30:53] they don't want to have a job
[1:30:55] they don't want the responsibility they
[1:30:57] don't want what it takes that comes with
[1:30:59] it
[1:31:00] and unfortunately it's a bad spirit
[1:31:02] today
[1:31:04] it's an overcoming spirit actually
[1:31:06] in in this laodicea my rights what is my
[1:31:10] rights friend you got no rights
[1:31:12] i'm just a sheep led by the shepherd
[1:31:14] right we got no rights
[1:31:17] amen
[1:31:18] we belong to god
[1:31:20] i i relinquished my rights when i called
[1:31:22] him my lord i relinquish my rights
[1:31:26] i want all my rights this is the
[1:31:27] laodicea see me first it's all about me
[1:31:31] the narcissism all about me
[1:31:33] and i really want the responsibility
[1:31:36] that's why you see so many
[1:31:40] troubles today with trying to get
[1:31:43] people to take jobs
[1:31:45] we sat and waited at a restaurant 15-20
[1:31:47] minutes to sit down and they got six
[1:31:49] eight empty tables but they don't have
[1:31:51] people to watch them
[1:31:52] they don't have wait staff or cook staff
[1:31:55] or whatever it is
[1:31:56] they don't have the people to do it
[1:31:58] and you look and you see what seems to
[1:32:00] be perfectly viable humans out on the
[1:32:02] street perfectly viable humans just
[1:32:05] staying at home being able to work can
[1:32:07] do what they should do but they just
[1:32:09] won't do it
[1:32:10] i read a statistic a majority of the
[1:32:13] young generation the gen x or whatever
[1:32:15] they call millennials whatever
[1:32:18] they would rather stay at home and do
[1:32:21] nothing
[1:32:23] than to have a job they don't like now
[1:32:26] how many of you here has ever had a job
[1:32:27] you don't like
[1:32:31] yeah because you were raised right and
[1:32:32] you knew what it took that you were
[1:32:34] supposed to go work and have a job and
[1:32:36] do what you're supposed to do or
[1:32:38] something like that but they they just
[1:32:40] they won't just want to even work well
[1:32:41] don't do anything
[1:32:43] even with inflation going up the way it
[1:32:45] is and it just comes they just don't
[1:32:46] want the responsibility what they want
[1:32:48] is to make a six six uh six figure
[1:32:51] income and work 20 hours a week
[1:32:55] amen
[1:32:58] people come into church and
[1:33:00] they walk out the same as they came in
[1:33:02] right why because when the word goes
[1:33:05] forth there's responsibility yes there's
[1:33:07] a responsibility to all of us
[1:33:09] probably me most than any of you
[1:33:12] this responsibility that comes with it
[1:33:17] sometimes it's not easy
[1:33:19] but it's
[1:33:20] necessary right amen i believe it's
[1:33:22] pleasing to the lord
[1:33:24] think about jonah for a minute let's
[1:33:26] read this jonah chapter 1 verse 1 i'm
[1:33:29] just going to read it we know the story
[1:33:31] very well now the word of the lord came
[1:33:33] unto jonah the son of
[1:33:34] uh hematite
[1:33:36] saying arise go to nineveh that great
[1:33:40] city and cry against it for their
[1:33:42] wickedness has come up before me
[1:33:45] but jonah rose up to flee unto tarshish
[1:33:48] from the presence of the lord and went
[1:33:50] down to joppa and he found the ship
[1:33:53] going to tarshish so he paid the fare
[1:33:55] thereof and went down into it to go with
[1:33:57] them into tarshish from the presence of
[1:34:00] the lord twice it says from the presence
[1:34:02] of the lord but jonah
[1:34:04] a horrible time had come god had asked
[1:34:07] him to do something he just flat out did
[1:34:08] not want to do
[1:34:10] again has anybody ever had god tell you
[1:34:13] to do something you just didn't want to
[1:34:14] do
[1:34:15] amen
[1:34:17] absolutely i have
[1:34:19] uh several times many times but
[1:34:22] uh
[1:34:25] jonah didn't want to go to nineveh
[1:34:28] he didn't want to go to this wicked
[1:34:30] place he didn't want to go to the evil
[1:34:32] to this evil place he wanted the
[1:34:34] comforts that what he had where he was
[1:34:37] i don't want to go if i'm going to go
[1:34:39] anywhere i'm going to try to get away
[1:34:40] from god and go to tarshish problem is
[1:34:42] you can't get away from god right
[1:34:44] because even in this case
[1:34:48] now it happens differently for all of us
[1:34:50] and for many through the ages
[1:34:54] but god in this one time had built a
[1:34:56] special fish now listen young people and
[1:34:59] now young people's not here today just
[1:35:02] told him
[1:35:04] god the bible does not say now i don't
[1:35:06] know about no any of these new
[1:35:08] translations
[1:35:10] but the real translation of the
[1:35:12] scripture does not say
[1:35:14] it was a whale right right and so many
[1:35:17] times people come and they try to refute
[1:35:19] this miracle by saying oh there's no way
[1:35:21] a whale can swallow jonah it does not
[1:35:24] say it was a whale that's right
[1:35:27] it says that god spilt a special fish
[1:35:31] amen right
[1:35:33] amen
[1:35:35] he god built a special prepared fish
[1:35:39] to swallow jonah
[1:35:42] amen
[1:35:43] god
[1:35:45] did this so if this miracle that we
[1:35:47] expect that god does miracles all the
[1:35:49] time if he does it he built this fish
[1:35:52] this one time shot
[1:35:54] this one-time fish what happened to this
[1:35:56] fish after he vomited jonah up on and
[1:35:58] none of it
[1:35:59] it doesn't say we don't know right
[1:36:02] but god built this fish special
[1:36:05] wasn't a whale it was this but now it
[1:36:07] could have been a whale but it wasn't a
[1:36:09] whale like we know today but it it was a
[1:36:11] special built fish
[1:36:13] and that's the only that's the that's
[1:36:15] the thing we need to know but people
[1:36:17] come up and say oh well can't do this
[1:36:19] wasn't a whale
[1:36:20] it says it was a special prepared fish
[1:36:23] by god there's where the miracle comes
[1:36:26] now how many times has god
[1:36:28] specially prepared a fish to swallow you
[1:36:33] not a literal fish but something in your
[1:36:35] life when you're going along in the way
[1:36:37] that you're not supposed to go
[1:36:39] or going in a way where god told you not
[1:36:41] to go or doing something you know that
[1:36:43] you shouldn't do and god sends something
[1:36:46] somebody a bird a fish a whale something
[1:36:51] and turned you around
[1:36:53] and put your feet back where they were
[1:36:54] supposed to be
[1:36:56] well that's just all god did for jonah
[1:36:58] it just happened to be that he was on a
[1:37:00] ship they threw him off the ship and
[1:37:01] there was that fish that got it prepared
[1:37:03] for him swallowed him up the best part
[1:37:05] about it is when he got up to nineveh
[1:37:07] and this and and jonah walks out from
[1:37:10] this fish's mouth and the nineveh
[1:37:12] worshipped the fish they fell down
[1:37:14] before him and listening anything jonah
[1:37:16] had to say
[1:37:19] because a fish had come up and vomited
[1:37:21] drone out
[1:37:22] on the land now these men have saw this
[1:37:25] great big fish and this man that had
[1:37:27] come out from that fish they would
[1:37:29] listen to anything he had to say amen
[1:37:32] praise the lord amen that's the truth
[1:37:34] amen
[1:37:35] so
[1:37:36] if that's what it takes then praise the
[1:37:38] lord
[1:37:39] but
[1:37:40] the point jonah tried to
[1:37:43] shirk the responsibility of what god was
[1:37:46] telling him to do god i don't want to do
[1:37:48] that i'm going to get away from you and
[1:37:49] go over here god says you can go where
[1:37:51] you want but there's no place you can
[1:37:52] run that i'm not there
[1:37:55] hey bud amen he could have told him
[1:37:56] right then i've got a fish ready for you
[1:37:59] when you when they kick you off the boat
[1:38:00] he'll be right there take you up to see
[1:38:02] we can't we don't see those things a lot
[1:38:04] of times
[1:38:05] the things that god is doing in the
[1:38:07] workings of the miracles that god is
[1:38:09] working in our lives we don't see him a
[1:38:10] lot of times until that actually
[1:38:12] happened
[1:38:13] but god is in control of it and that's
[1:38:15] the best part about it
[1:38:17] even when he tried to
[1:38:20] shirk his responsibility god still
[1:38:22] brought him in the place that he needed
[1:38:24] to be
[1:38:25] and god could took care of it for it
[1:38:28] if god sends you somewhere he's going to
[1:38:30] prepare where you're going for the
[1:38:32] purpose that god's looking look at when
[1:38:34] god sent moses to egypt
[1:38:37] god sent moses to egypt and told and
[1:38:40] told moses what to do but then he
[1:38:42] hardened pharaoh's heart against moses
[1:38:46] you would think that moses is going
[1:38:48] there and ready to take the place over
[1:38:51] as brother brown talked about here i'm
[1:38:53] ready to take over no god hardened
[1:38:55] pharaoh's heart there was no way he was
[1:38:57] going to take over the place
[1:38:58] he hardened his heart against him
[1:39:01] well god you're sending me over here i
[1:39:03] thought you'd
[1:39:04] i thought you'd have thrown me in and
[1:39:06] just laid me down in this nice bed of
[1:39:08] petal rose petals and all this flowery
[1:39:11] betta bees and i figured everything
[1:39:13] would just be nice and there'd be a big
[1:39:15] feather
[1:39:16] fanning me and grapes and you know and
[1:39:18] i'm i'm here to take over egypt and this
[1:39:22] that's
[1:39:24] is that the way god does things that
[1:39:27] that wasn't god's plan right
[1:39:30] but everything that god did and see
[1:39:32] god's not going to send you somewhere
[1:39:33] you don't have the strength to be able
[1:39:35] to overcome it right to be able to take
[1:39:37] care but god's not going to call
[1:39:38] something to for you to do in your life
[1:39:40] that you're incapable of doing
[1:39:43] amen now it may be something that you
[1:39:46] don't want to do it may be something
[1:39:48] you've never done before
[1:39:50] but god will make sure that when you get
[1:39:52] there and you obey him that he takes
[1:39:54] care of the circumstances to give you
[1:39:56] the strength to be able to follow
[1:39:58] through with it
[1:39:59] whatever it is
[1:40:01] and we've known that to be true in our
[1:40:03] lives
[1:40:04] thank god for it
[1:40:05] they got to give us the strength to be
[1:40:07] able to do it when we get there
[1:40:09] lord i don't know what i'm going to say
[1:40:11] i'll give you the words
[1:40:13] you just do what i tell you and that's
[1:40:16] where it comes down to the faith the
[1:40:18] faith of the responsibility that we have
[1:40:20] in obedience to god's word
[1:40:22] just do what i tell you i'll take care
[1:40:25] of the rest but god what am i going to
[1:40:27] do i'll show you what to do god what am
[1:40:30] i going to say i'll give you the words
[1:40:32] but i can't vote moses said i can't
[1:40:34] speak lord i'll i'll send aaron he'll be
[1:40:36] your prophet right and and and he can
[1:40:38] speak on your behalf but when it was
[1:40:40] time and god loosened moses tongue he
[1:40:42] spoke just like the rest of us
[1:40:44] amen because god can do that god can
[1:40:47] build a fish
[1:40:49] even when a man like jonah wants to run
[1:40:51] from the presence of the lord
[1:40:53] even when he wants to god's still there
[1:40:55] to take care of him
[1:40:57] amen god's still there to to
[1:41:00] to keep him
[1:41:01] keep him in his care
[1:41:03] there's a man i'll close here in just a
[1:41:05] minute there was a man here i had a few
[1:41:08] other scriptures but i'm going to go
[1:41:09] over to matthew now we'll just we'll
[1:41:11] close this
[1:41:18] matthew chapter
[1:41:20] uh
[1:41:21] chapter 19.
[1:41:25] very familiar story
[1:41:28] i'll close after this
[1:41:36] matthew chapter 19
[1:41:42] verse 16.
[1:41:44] rich run ruler behold one came and said
[1:41:47] unto him
[1:41:48] good master
[1:41:50] what good thing shall i do that i may
[1:41:52] have eternal life
[1:41:54] now he's asking this man is literally
[1:41:57] asking it's a question a lot of people
[1:41:59] probably wouldn't ask because they don't
[1:42:01] want to know the answer
[1:42:03] understand
[1:42:04] this is a question a lot of people would
[1:42:05] not ask because they don't want to know
[1:42:07] the answer right because once you know
[1:42:08] the answer and you've got the truth
[1:42:10] you're responsible to that truth yes
[1:42:12] amen and people want to know as little
[1:42:15] as possible
[1:42:17] and that and that's how that's how
[1:42:19] governments end up taking over countries
[1:42:21] that's how hitler was able to take over
[1:42:23] uh in nazis in germany
[1:42:27] just take over control the people don't
[1:42:29] ask questions no responsibility burn all
[1:42:31] the truth
[1:42:33] amen get rid of free speech uh burn all
[1:42:36] the books
[1:42:37] amen
[1:42:39] only you're only allowed to believe and
[1:42:41] think and say what we tell you
[1:42:44] and that's how you took control over it
[1:42:47] same thing's happening in this country
[1:42:49] amen
[1:42:51] then you just do what we tell you
[1:42:53] and then it's going to be that way it
[1:42:56] won't get to the germany way because
[1:42:58] that was a different time this
[1:43:00] this country will just be destroyed
[1:43:04] but a lot of people won't even ask this
[1:43:05] question but he asked the question
[1:43:08] so the responsibility is about to come
[1:43:11] what good thing
[1:43:14] that
[1:43:16] shall i do that i may have eternal life
[1:43:19] now remember this is a man who's
[1:43:21] rich he's a young man earned a living
[1:43:26] he's a deeds oriented person
[1:43:30] obviously because most people of wealth
[1:43:33] unless they've inherited it are deeds
[1:43:35] oriented people
[1:43:37] they've
[1:43:38] they've gotten or obtained their wealth
[1:43:40] from the from the sweat of their brow
[1:43:42] the work of their hand or
[1:43:44] idea or something they they they've
[1:43:47] gotten it this way
[1:43:49] so they're a deeds oriented person
[1:43:52] so this is a this is obviously a deeds
[1:43:55] oriented man because he's saying what
[1:43:58] good thing can i do
[1:44:00] because he wants to he wants to do a
[1:44:02] deed to be able to earn eternal life
[1:44:06] right but there's not a deed you can do
[1:44:08] to earn eternal life
[1:44:10] amen in fact there's nothing anybody any
[1:44:13] human can do to earn eternal life right
[1:44:15] it's a free gift
[1:44:19] and he said unto him why callest thou me
[1:44:22] good there is none good but one that is
[1:44:24] god
[1:44:25] but if thou will now this is the same
[1:44:28] question he asked the man that the pool
[1:44:29] of bethesda
[1:44:31] if you will it's your choice
[1:44:34] enter into life keep the commandments
[1:44:37] he said unto him which
[1:44:40] jesus jesus said thou shalt do no murder
[1:44:43] thou shalt not commit adultery thou
[1:44:45] shalt not steal thou shalt not bear
[1:44:47] false witness honor thy father and
[1:44:50] mother
[1:44:51] and
[1:44:52] and thou shalt love thy neighbor as
[1:44:54] thyself
[1:44:56] the young man said unto him all these
[1:44:58] things have i kept from my youth up what
[1:45:01] lack i get so he's a good man
[1:45:04] good boy good person
[1:45:06] probably an
[1:45:08] upstanding deacon in his local assembly
[1:45:11] probably gave faithful tithe offering
[1:45:14] probably was in attendance at every
[1:45:16] service led songs or whatever he did so
[1:45:19] he was a good person kept the
[1:45:21] commandments did everything that he was
[1:45:23] because he's a deeds oriented man
[1:45:27] so he did everything that the deeds
[1:45:30] required from him
[1:45:32] but now jesus required something more
[1:45:36] said unto him again if thou will
[1:45:39] if you will now it's if you want to
[1:45:43] he's your free moral agent you have the
[1:45:45] choice
[1:45:46] i'm going to give you the truth
[1:45:48] but you have the choice to make
[1:45:51] now the responsibility is about to
[1:45:52] follow him if thou will be perfect
[1:45:55] go and sell that thou has give to the
[1:45:58] poor and thou shalt have treasure in
[1:46:00] heaven and come and follow me
[1:46:05] the one thing
[1:46:07] that he loved the most
[1:46:10] his money
[1:46:11] was what the lord was requiring of him
[1:46:16] because that was what was standing
[1:46:17] between him and god that's what was
[1:46:19] standing between him and eternal life
[1:46:22] now that he knows the truth he's
[1:46:24] responsible to the truth right
[1:46:26] he has to
[1:46:28] to
[1:46:29] to be able to receive what he's asking
[1:46:32] of he has to do what the lord just told
[1:46:34] him to do
[1:46:35] that's the only way to do it
[1:46:37] come and follow me but when the young
[1:46:39] man heard that saying he went away
[1:46:41] sorrowful for he had great possessions
[1:46:45] jesus said unto his disciples verily i
[1:46:47] say unto you that a rich man shall
[1:46:48] hardly enter in the kingdom of heaven
[1:46:50] and again i say unto you it is easier
[1:46:52] for a camel to go through the eye of a
[1:46:54] needle than for a rich man to enter into
[1:46:56] the kingdom of god he didn't say it was
[1:46:58] impossible right
[1:47:00] he just said it's very difficult
[1:47:02] very challenging
[1:47:04] amen
[1:47:05] because of the reasoning now different
[1:47:07] circumstances with different people but
[1:47:10] reasoning based on what the rich young
[1:47:12] ruler just went through
[1:47:13] what he just went through
[1:47:15] fall in line with everyone that jesus is
[1:47:19] referring to every circumstance
[1:47:21] different that's why
[1:47:22] not impossible he didn't say it couldn't
[1:47:24] happen he just said it's very difficult
[1:47:27] because that mammon becomes their god
[1:47:30] when his disciples heard it they were
[1:47:32] exceeding amaze saying who then can be
[1:47:35] saved
[1:47:36] well i don't know what it was like then
[1:47:38] and how much money the disciples had
[1:47:40] there's a lot of people i know that
[1:47:41] aren't rich
[1:47:43] that don't have to worry about this
[1:47:45] situation
[1:47:46] they're like who can be saved if only
[1:47:48] the rich people is like i have a camel
[1:47:51] going through the eye of a needle well
[1:47:52] i'm not rich so
[1:47:55] i i don't know anybody here that is rich
[1:47:58] i guess maybe by some
[1:48:00] standards some certain world standards
[1:48:02] we might be but by the our standards
[1:48:05] here in this country we're not by any
[1:48:07] means rich
[1:48:10] they said who can be saved jesus said
[1:48:11] unto them
[1:48:12] and say unto them with men this is
[1:48:15] impossible but with god all things are
[1:48:18] possible
[1:48:19] all things are possible now are we
[1:48:22] willing to receive
[1:48:24] accept
[1:48:26] fall under the
[1:48:28] responsibility
[1:48:29] that god is called in in all of our
[1:48:33] lives not just as christians but even
[1:48:35] just as human
[1:48:36] just even as as people
[1:48:39] to receive and accept that
[1:48:40] responsibility for what it takes to do
[1:48:45] i want to be a christian
[1:48:48] that comes with a responsibility
[1:48:51] amen am i willing to do what the lord
[1:48:53] wants me to do yes am i willing to
[1:48:55] follow the word am i willing to listen
[1:48:57] to the truth am i willing to let that
[1:49:01] word
[1:49:02] live through me yes become that word in
[1:49:05] my life
[1:49:07] am i willing to
[1:49:08] uh
[1:49:10] to take on the responsibility of what it
[1:49:12] takes to try to help others to try to
[1:49:15] witness to others to try to help be a
[1:49:17] soul winner that others may come and
[1:49:19] receive what i have
[1:49:22] yeah am i willing to receive the
[1:49:23] responsibility of
[1:49:25] of living up to these uh these standards
[1:49:28] that god has set before us
[1:49:31] did you imagine think about
[1:49:33] think about if moses had not taken that
[1:49:35] responsibility let's we could even get
[1:49:37] closer to home think about it brother
[1:49:39] branham was unwilling to accept that
[1:49:41] responsibility
[1:49:44] what would this bride be like today
[1:49:46] right
[1:49:48] amen
[1:49:50] what if moses moses had 2 million people
[1:49:52] that he had fallen around the desert
[1:49:55] 2 million
[1:49:56] think about that
[1:49:58] and with women and children how many
[1:50:01] that
[1:50:02] multi-millions we don't even know for
[1:50:03] sure then there
[1:50:05] multi millions of people that he had
[1:50:07] depending on him relying on him
[1:50:09] listening to his word following where he
[1:50:12] took them
[1:50:13] why
[1:50:14] i think about the incredible
[1:50:16] responsibility that god has laid on me
[1:50:20] as a pastor of a church
[1:50:22] to give to you the truth that i believe
[1:50:24] he gives to me
[1:50:28] but then to think two million people
[1:50:33] think about this for a moment
[1:50:36] there was a brother at the minister's
[1:50:37] meeting yesterday they had been in the
[1:50:38] military and he talked about um
[1:50:41] how the military changes you
[1:50:44] i grew up of course hunting fishing
[1:50:47] handling guns i know how to handle guns
[1:50:50] a lot of people might not but i know how
[1:50:52] to handle guns he grew up handling guns
[1:50:54] he had a handle ghost but when he got to
[1:50:56] the military it changed his life
[1:50:59] first thing they taught him he said was
[1:51:00] to check your weapon
[1:51:02] because first thing you need to know is
[1:51:04] that weapon have any a bullet in it
[1:51:07] something that could harm somebody
[1:51:10] harm something or harm you
[1:51:12] yes
[1:51:13] check and make sure clear it
[1:51:16] and he talked about
[1:51:18] that in a spiritual application of uh
[1:51:21] the type of weaponry bullets that that
[1:51:24] go in that gun
[1:51:26] out
[1:51:27] if you're hunting
[1:51:29] different guns for different game
[1:51:32] different bullets sometimes for
[1:51:35] different game even with the same gun
[1:51:37] i've hunted with the same gun
[1:51:40] but
[1:51:40] for different game i used a different
[1:51:42] bullet
[1:51:45] and i got the thought and i wrote it
[1:51:47] down and gave it to him
[1:51:49] he seemed to like it
[1:51:52] i said
[1:51:53] bullets of the truth
[1:51:55] kill the enemy
[1:51:57] but bullets of lies kill each other
[1:52:00] amen
[1:52:02] and if and if a lie goes forth and
[1:52:05] somebody believes it
[1:52:07] now this is responsibility yeah
[1:52:09] if a lie goes forth and somebody
[1:52:11] believes it
[1:52:12] and that person tells 10 more people
[1:52:14] that believe it and those 10 people tell
[1:52:17] 10 more people that believe it just from
[1:52:19] that one lie
[1:52:22] moses had over 2 million people
[1:52:24] responsible to him
[1:52:26] god help us
[1:52:28] now you know why i stay in prayer
[1:52:31] because of a responsibility that falls
[1:52:35] in this position
[1:52:37] to make sure and do everything that i
[1:52:39] feel the lord
[1:52:42] gives and
[1:52:43] tells
[1:52:45] because it's
[1:52:47] it's a great responsibility and i take
[1:52:49] it as such
[1:52:51] wouldn't do it if it wasn't
[1:52:53] no way
[1:52:55] amen
[1:52:56] i remember i'll close with this i
[1:52:58] remember brother gray
[1:53:00] back
[1:53:02] 12 15 years ago
[1:53:04] people would come to other marina try to
[1:53:05] get him actually maybe even longer than
[1:53:07] that
[1:53:08] try to get brother green put him on a
[1:53:10] salary now other ministers do that and
[1:53:13] whatever they every church is sovereign
[1:53:15] however they feel to do but
[1:53:18] tried to put brother green on a salary
[1:53:20] and he said and brother greece
[1:53:23] how much do you think pastoring this
[1:53:24] church and all these people how much do
[1:53:26] you think that's worth
[1:53:28] i said oh i i think that's probably
[1:53:29] worth maybe 80 000 a year he says i
[1:53:31] wouldn't even consider even walking
[1:53:33] through the door for 80 000 a year
[1:53:36] now i don't have no clue how much
[1:53:38] money went through their eye or
[1:53:40] or
[1:53:41] how much you made i had no idea but i
[1:53:43] know brother green was the most giving
[1:53:45] man i'd ever met in my life
[1:53:48] brother green
[1:53:49] i guarantee you brother green probably
[1:53:51] gave more than he got i don't know how
[1:53:53] you do that but
[1:53:55] uh
[1:53:55] that's what you look for he probably
[1:53:58] gave more than he got
[1:53:59] they said he said i wouldn't walk
[1:54:01] through the door for you though did you
[1:54:02] imagine
[1:54:04] the responsibility
[1:54:07] think about i made the comment and i
[1:54:09] told him to his face i told the whole
[1:54:11] church i believe brother green was one
[1:54:12] of the greatest men ever lived i still
[1:54:14] believe that i'll probably believe that
[1:54:16] little dad died nothing i've ever heard
[1:54:18] even with all of his failures and
[1:54:19] mistakes nothing i ever heard to change
[1:54:21] that opinion of mine
[1:54:23] i believe it's one of the greatest to
[1:54:24] ever live
[1:54:26] because of the result
[1:54:28] and you think about
[1:54:29] all of that around the world and all the
[1:54:32] places gone ministers
[1:54:35] churches established
[1:54:37] message taken around the world
[1:54:41] apart even from the tabernacle
[1:54:44] i think mine
[1:54:46] the responsibility it's a great
[1:54:48] responsibility people want to be critics
[1:54:51] so quick to be critics
[1:54:54] but you think about the responsibility
[1:54:55] that falls there and
[1:54:58] ask yourself would i be willing to take
[1:55:00] that responsibility
[1:55:02] would i be willing to do that
[1:55:04] amen it is it's a great responsibility
[1:55:07] but but that's why
[1:55:09] that's why god placed ephesians 4
[1:55:12] that's why god
[1:55:15] raised us and put us in the places and
[1:55:17] give us the gifts and the the
[1:55:21] the gifts of the spirit the things god
[1:55:23] give us for all of us
[1:55:26] for the edifying of the body
[1:55:28] it's not just a pastor teacher or
[1:55:30] fivefold ministry it's all of us we're
[1:55:32] all responsible
[1:55:35] amen
[1:55:36] every one of us are responsible
[1:55:38] if there ever was a time saints we were
[1:55:41] to shake a loose of this spirit
[1:55:44] of laziness and complacency it is today
[1:55:48] yes
[1:55:49] because we're about this bride is about
[1:55:51] to do something
[1:55:53] that has never been done by a wholesale
[1:55:55] group
[1:55:56] ever
[1:55:58] that we know of scripture there's been
[1:56:00] people raptured but of course we know
[1:56:02] that we've taught on that there's been
[1:56:04] people raptured but never where you see
[1:56:06] a whole cell
[1:56:10] catching away of god's people at one
[1:56:11] time like it's what's about to happen
[1:56:13] yes
[1:56:14] the responsibility that falls on us
[1:56:18] because we're part of that yes amen
[1:56:21] you're part of that
[1:56:22] then that responsibility is yours
[1:56:24] whether you want it or not
[1:56:26] it's mine whether i want it or not and i
[1:56:28] do want it i welcome it
[1:56:30] but not to be complacent
[1:56:34] lazy
[1:56:35] of the things that's going on in the
[1:56:37] world today
[1:56:38] and god blesses us
[1:56:40] god blesses us for it saints
[1:56:42] amen

[1:56:53] congregation
[1:56:55] and personally and in our own personal
[1:56:58] lives
[1:57:01] people have been suffering
[1:57:03] and doing without
[1:57:05] and having it having to go to a
[1:57:09] waiting
[1:57:10] three hour long lines at a food bank or
[1:57:13] something god has blessed us

[2:06:10] uh
[2:06:11] may 15th is a sunday so hopefully people
[2:06:14] still streaming may 15th is a sunday
[2:06:18] um i want to buy all of your lunch
[2:06:20] at golden corral on may 15.
[2:06:24] i want to try to
[2:06:26] talk to golden corral to see if we can
[2:06:28] get the room in the back i don't know if
[2:06:30] we'll get the whole route to ourselves
[2:06:31] we don't really need the whole room but
[2:06:33] at least the corner of it were you know
[2:06:35] we said 20-25 people
[2:06:38] so
[2:06:40] it just
[2:06:40] i just feel like after
[2:06:43] all the
[2:06:45] talking about it and everything
[2:06:47] just simplify it and make it maybe a
[2:06:50] little easier on the sisters but um just
[2:06:54] sunday may 15
[2:06:56] will
[2:06:56] if you can and want to go to the golden
[2:06:59] corral on thornydale uh after church and
[2:07:02] i want to treat everybody's lunch it'll
[2:07:04] be our sixth it'll be the church's sixth
[2:07:06] anniversary
[2:07:07] and then last year we did the barbecue
[2:07:10] at the hotel
[2:07:12] but this this if people say well it's
[2:07:14] expensive don't worry about it
[2:07:17] if god can create a well he can create
[2:07:19] money to pay for your lunch don't worry
[2:07:21] about it
[2:07:22] uh we'll go golden corral i noticed some
[2:07:26] don't like it so much but
[2:07:28] um
[2:07:29] it seems like it's a nice facility to
[2:07:32] to
[2:07:33] be in the room where we can all sit
[2:07:35] together and hopefully
[2:07:37] i'll again i'll talk to them and make
[2:07:39] sure they accommodate that we can sit
[2:07:41] together like that

[2:07:48] we started
[2:07:49] uh
