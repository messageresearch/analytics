of course we know that god is uh god and what he's done for me is it's phenomenal and uh i thank the lord for uh his goodness uh and his grace i didn't know i had an interpreter thank you brother amen and we appreciate all of those who are here from iowa city we appreciate you thank you for coming by the grace of god and uh just as we fumble with this thing we'll get it all together i i'm going to try my best not to get excited [Music] my wife was telling me about the man the lady who was a very sophisticated woman uh she thought she was taking the bible from her dad my family and uh you know she put him up in the basement and we [Music] he read where the bottom of the sea there was no bottom to it because she knew he didn't have a bible and he said well i was just reading like the wish is this something wrong whether the ocean had no bottom to it and he said all i thought about was how my sins stay cast into the sea of forgetfulness and that was enough to inspire him so even though i'm going to take my time i told my wife i wasn't going to preach this morning [Music] [Music] let us turn to the scripture saint john 3. john saint john 3. and we're going to read a 16th verse jean-claude says and then we'll go to romans 8. and we'll read the 9th through the 16th verse there only says the word of god says according to saint john 3 16 for god so loved the world and that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever shall believe in him should not perish but have everlasting life says let us turn to romans 8 now roman wheats yeah we begin reading at the ninth verse of that chapter i will not belong tonight this morning it may be the shortest message i've ever preached but we give all glory to god but ye are not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be that the spirit of god dwell in you now if any man have not the spirit of christ he is none of his pardon and if christ be in you the body is dead because of sin but the spirit is life because of righteousness acoustic but if the spirit of him that raised up jesus christ from the dead dwelleth in you he that raised up christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by this by his spirit that dwelleth in you christ is therefore brethren we are debtors not to the flesh to live after the flesh for if we live after the flesh you shall die but if ye through the spirit do mortify the deeds of the body ye shall live for as many are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god feasted you for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but ye have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry our father paris the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of god list unfounded amen let us pray heavenly father god we thank you for your grace in your name jesus christ we pray amen amen you may be seated we appreciate our brother charles interpreting for us our interpreter yeah okay okay yeah they don't know about these things i don't god is good to us just in testimony of the surgery that i had i was looking for god to completely give me a healing before the service yeah but instead he chose to do it his way and either way i'm pleased as you see satisfaction i expected pain and discomfort after the surgery i thought my eye was a matter of fact i can see better now than then and it doesn't work so much please unfunctionally placed a lot of stress on my eyes hallelujah good to us we'd like to entitle our message tonight or this morning the reason and the purpose as i spoke the last time i talked about brother branham and the vision that god gave him nobody could see what he was trying to get over to us right so we know by the grace of god that the vision that he left with us we must press into it brother branham talked about pressing into uh the vision of healing he said if you can see yourself here you need to walk into that and of course that that will take place the reason why i'm dealing with redemption because a lot of people don't even know what redemption is to redeem in other words you you gain back your own your property by way of payment we know that adam and eve sinned i don't but what was this all about first of all it was the love of god in in his expression of redemption is an expression of redemption we don't know what it's going to be like after we're redeemed and make heaven but paul said eyes have not seen amen the purpose because god has made that provision for us and that provision is to bring us back to that place from whence we fail i marvel at the position that a lot of christians hold uh right now position uh that means we are in the end times that means that god is getting ready to burn the earth that means it's shorter uh the time is much shorter than what when we first believed the seventh church age is over though it continues it does not continue for us because the message of the hour has brought us out of the seventh message a lot of people will argue with you on that but the reason why they'll argue it's because they have not seen the coming of the lord they don't understand uh in 1963 when those seven angels standed out of heaven in a comprehensive if you notice through studying the scripture and the things that brother branham said there was a point in time brother branham began to talk about the bride husband [Music] because that has all had already been established and you and i if you if we read the message brother branham talked about when the seals were open went to sleep and the cry you know isaac in the field she understands that this is a time of translation a man that she can no longer be influenced by the spirit of leia the season amazement people are still [Music] that god is calling for us to come to a place of perfection this is why you have all of these distractions we got distracted by the kovic now we've been distracted by the wars [Music] if you revelation 3. she can see clearly now she once was blind but now she sees me and so you and i must understand into the image in which he wants us to be can you see what god's trying to do with you he said if you could just say the father you must understand every trial don't sit down will you allow yourself to be distracted like peter was complete when jesus bade him to come he began to look at all the winds and the waves [Applause] even though he was walking on the water hallelujah your vision must change you must change from the natural to the supernatural hallelujah amen because what's happening with you right now you're literally walking on the waters hallelujah you're walking on leia hallelujah you're walking on all circumstances but the moment you fail to keep your eyes on jesus you will begin to sink hallelujah into the very place god ordained you to walk on top of jesus coming from the message god is his own interpreter is some proper enterprise brother banham says hallelujah just hold jesus the coming of the of the lord of the son of man loving the fifth dilemma the spirit of god would come upon the earth this way did you disunderscore the form of human beings now here brother branham is talking about the prophet you see he's talking about brother branham but you understand it doesn't stop there right right because now the prophet of god is gone where is the spirit of god now let's play the germans now hallelujah william branham was not a fake his his vindication or god's vindication in his life proved who he was so you and i must understand who's the we're not here to be church members it's a frightening thing for me it's a frightening thing for me to see the condition of the spirit that's living in you it's what it is it's defined in you no no matter how you confess with your mouth what you are doing to scare faith is and you're living like hell if we become unfair amen let me say that again that's my lady you cannot say you've come from heaven and you're living like hell if we become it's the way we use that word the and the bible says he whom the son is set free hallelujah hallelujah now if you're not free you still can be free now let's go on he said the spirit of god would come upon the earth in a form of a human being in in the form of human beings [Music] [Music] and would do the same thing that god did in the human flesh as sodom remember they were waiting for a promised son use abraham you like to reject isaac was basically the rapture okay the coming of the promises and the bible said she received strength from god now the mystery of the whole scripture is god said to abraham and sarah before isaac was born i'm going to visit you ivanka [Music] isaac showed up this is what the message is supposed to do to you i failed if you're not being changed hallelujah you will not receive isaac hallelujah hallelujah i understand as leia are the seals as we were we could not produce this is where rapturing faith lay within the message don't let me sign what brother branham told us we must lay in the presence of the sun hallelujah he didn't say amen acknowledge yourself as being nothing else see this message didn't come to just give you an intellectual understanding and when you see people amen in this message that still have a problem with hatred you need to be born again jesus was even able to love his enemies you must love your enemy they've admitted in me amen we we we must understand that this is not uh you can't one thing about love you can't fake it you you can't pretend and let me say like this one of the things that i hate the most literally gets next to my spirit and let me tell you something brother branham said it makes him sick too but let somebody in the church mess up we're still working we're still working and at the end of the day god will get victory in everything um let's move on continue let me back it up here right right after that you that was the last sign that sodom and abraham group saw before the promised son arrived that and now the church spiritual has come to that hour church the spiritual has come to that hour the spirituality and so when god speaks
