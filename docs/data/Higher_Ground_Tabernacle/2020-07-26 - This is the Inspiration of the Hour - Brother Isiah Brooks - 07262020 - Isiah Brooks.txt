and as we stand we're just going to get right on into the word of god my wife would have been here but for some reason she didn't remember recall that we was having service this evening well praise the lord we're just going to try to pick up where he left off this morning and the day before the last service um if you would turn with me to jude the first chapter jude one please the 24th first i don't know about you guys but i'm really happy tonight i'm happy because i really the more i study the more i see the more freedom god gives me and when you see where you're headed it's a wonderful thing yes lord jude 1 24 25 now unto him that is able to keep you from falling and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy to the only wise god our savior be glory and majesty dominion and power both now and ever [Music] amen hebrews please fourth chapter we start at the first verse let us therefore fear there's a promise being left us of entering into his rest any of you should seem to come short of it for unto us was the gospel preached as well as unto them but the word preached did not profit them not being mixed with faith in them that heard it remember that for we which have believed do enter into rest as he said i have sworn in my wrath if they shall enter into my rest although the works were finished from the foundation of the world for he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise and god did rest the seventh day from all of his works let us pray father we thank you for your grace we thank you for your mercy and all that you have done for us and everything that you are doing we pray father that you're blessed of service in a special way we thank you lord for all that you are and father we love you because of your character in jesus christ's name we pray amen you may be seated uh just thinking about the to the service tonight and what god is requiring of us we talked and we spoke a little bit about the seven seals and the seven thunders and where we are in this time or in this dispensational time we know that we're at the end time amen because malachi 4 has come and gone and we also know that we are living in borrowed time if you want to say the long-suffering of god because in reality the rapture should have taken place already god is not we're not waiting on god god is waiting on us and you and i must understand that god the only way that you can please god is you must have faith faith is not something that you could work up it's not a psychological thing or intellectual thing it is something in which god gives you it is a finding it is finding favor with god many people we look and we read the scriptures and we hear where the bible tells us that abraham faith and he believed god but you must understand that god gave abraham that faith no man can believe god is that right it all of these things are directed by one thing inspiration and god gives that inspiration to the individual in which he's he he's chosen to give it to and i like to entitle this message this is the inspiration of the hour now we realize by god's grace and we talked about this in previous messages when brother adam talked about the junior jackson's dream about the white pyramid and the rock and said that that rock in itself could not be interpreted there was no written word amen and brother branham even asked that question in in service is the time because amen he was wondering you know what god was going to do he felt an inspiration he didn't fully understand the inspiration but he knew it had to do something with god understand a prophet a prophet is a straight shooter and brother branham was a straight shooter he was not one that would be willing amen as i said before to shoot a an animal a man in the side of the head or the ear or the chest he had to shoot that little squirrel right in between the eye and he even consulted the lord why am i like this when all the other brothers when they shoot they just so glad to get a kill but he was designed he was actually placed in a position where he had to keep it straight amen because he had a word he had a commission from god that required him to be that way and we so we so we realized by god's grace we're in he was he was actually being tormented if you want to say it because he didn't know remember and god allowed it to happen he actually thought it was his death he did not know like some people think he knew everything he did not know he didn't understand what was happening but then there's a question amen that he asked amen ensures the time and he he asked lord is these the angels of the lord that's coming to pick me up so he began to wonder and wonder and wonder until one day he was out there in the desert picking up a cocker barrel off of his pant leg and boom there it was one blast and seven angels came and caught him up amen into that pyramid cloud at one place he called it a circular cloud but we understand exactly what he meant i showed you by god's grace that that same cap pyramid cloud was actually the capstone of the pyramid or the capstan stone of the church ages however you want to put it but we understand my god that there has has to be an inspiration and if you don't have an inspiration now something's going wrong somewhere all true believers those who are chosen to be bride those who are called to be bride should be moving in a direction in which they themselves have no control over it it's almost like the animals who were led into the ark when the inspiration struck them they didn't know where they were going they didn't even understand but they knew they had to get somewhere at a certain time and be in that certain place when god moved and that's how it is with the bride of jesus christ she's under an inspiration and that inspiration amen is moving her amen and you know we're not at a place where we can afford to resist anymore that inspiration is pulling her and drawing her amen into that position that god has uh intended for her to be the thing i love about this message is that the message take away the guilt consciousness when the holy ghost comes it take away the guilt of consciousness as i said this morning many people would move forward faster if they stop condemning themselves amen why are you condemning yourself when god doesn't condemn you if god has totally justified you why would you not accept it see that's what i'm saying it must come by faith hallelujah amen you must understand in order to make a rapture it ain't a hope so it must become a no soul it must be a word the word of god that has been delivered to you if god said i'm justified i'm justified if he says i'm sanctified i'm sanctified if he says i'm here he is i'm here hallelujah because you must understand this flesh amen god god has already condemned it there's no way you can perfect this flesh when you try to perfect the flesh you have now adopted a system hallelujah and no system can perfect you neither can a system give you divine love you can work yourself to death hallelujah and god is the only one that can give it to you but the system in itself is there to control you and the bible said where the spirit of the lord is there's liberty and he whom the son set free is free indeed hallelujah you say oh but let me say it like this there's a time we needed a system hallelujah amen like a seed when it's planted into the ground and it begins to grow it grows in a systematic way hallelujah it has boundaries somebody help me here it has boundaries but those church ages was like a system and what did they do they they put laws and rules and regulations in place so that people can appear to be hallelujah but god ain't looking for the appearing to be he's looking for the reality of the seed hallelujah you had the lutherans you had the wesley we you know they all had something good about them but they did not look like the original seed hallelujah but you got to understand when god begins to move god is in this hour god is looking for the original seed hallelujah he said oh brother books what are you saying you know when cain killed abel amen the devil thought that he had uh the the world in a fix because k able was the only righteous seed and he killed the righteous seed hallelujah but then god appointed another seed and called his name seth and the bible said after god pointed south amen then the people began to call upon the name of the lord hallelujah and it doesn't tell us how long it was between abel and seth but we do know one thing there's a silence there there's no worship there hallelujah hey and abel represented the church and there was no worship it was when true worship came in when seth was appointed hallelujah to make a long story short true worship of jesus christ could not come back into focus until god appointed a seed and we call his name william branham and when god amen appointed him then he taught us what it meant to praise god how to worship god how to do those things that god would have us to do y'all understand me so let's move on what was it it's inspiration we're living in a time amen that you and i must understand the bible said holy men moved by the by the spirit of god see the spirit of god gotta move you amen you know how it is a lot of us we we love to witness but we can't witness until god moves upon us is that right amen this is the hour every man and woman of god i often think to myself i said what about tamar tamar looked like she was rejected and then she looked like she was finished but something moved upon it there was an inspiration that struck tamar it would have looked crazy and insane to everybody else but when it came to her it made all the sense in the world hallelujah and she moved and because she moved and and guess what she disguised herself as a prostitute hallelujah she knew the weakness of judah and she knew judah was coming her way listen because jude and tamar got together it didn't mean that she was going to get pregnant but god set it up hallelujah god set it up he works on both ears hallelujah and so we see by god's grace it is so important when the holy spirit tell you to do something do it but if you don't have a life if you don't have nothing you can't feel god or you can't hear god or you can't everybody even animals can hear god hallelujah oh come on somebody you know oftentimes we don't do because we don't want to do hallelujah but listen let's move on by the grace of god noah it was hard for the people to understand noah hallelujah in his day he heard god speak he knew it was the word because he was god's prophet god sent him forth to claim a great flood coming he built a way uh on the ark and in time of criticism make no difference to noah how many criticized he was the light of that day he was the word of god manifested for that day hallelujah and god destroyed the people you say well what do you mean listen the truth of the matter is you are the manifestation of the word today you are it is william brown who has done his thing you the word hallelujah help us jesus you and i supposed to be what the light of the world under the inspiration of the seven seals and the seven thunders you know why i'm saying it like that because under that inspiration we receive full authority and power everything we lost amen by the fall of adam has been restored but if you can't believe it it's only because that inspiration hasn't struck you yet hallelujah but when the inspiration strikes you it puts you in a place i'm not afraid of death i'm not afraid of corona i'm not afraid of nothing hallelujah why because the bible said no weapon formed against me shall prosper hallelujah you and i must understand you got to wake up you got to come to a place to realize amen you are bride hallelujah you're not some mistake hallelujah but you are the word of god predestinated for this hour to manifest jesus christ and him only hallelujah it is what it is hallelujah amen and even though it looked crazy you're gonna look crazy oh like i was saying this morning you can develop a systematic worship you can develop a way of doing it just right but that doesn't give you the holy ghost neither does it give you salvation there's a lot of people who can dress holier than us there's a lot of people who are far more faithful to church than we are hallelujah it's like jacob and esau come on somebody amen jacob amen esau looked better more like a christian than jacob jacob was a shy star hallelujah he was the one a man that looked like a devil but it wasn't about that god don't care about what you appear to be to somebody else he knows his seed the bible said he knows them that our ears and no matter what satan has clouded your your life with or covered you up amen it doesn't matter hallelujah when god begins to move hallelujah is that right no matter how bad of a person jacob was when god began to move when that inspiration got on jacob says i got to go back home hallelujah see that's what i'm saying you got to go back home you got to get your in your proper place and god is going to keep driving you because you know what as human beings we're lazy we don't like to study we don't like to read we don't like to do nothing but judge hallelujah come out it's the truth but god ain't all about that god is looking at a people amen that's ready for a rapture i don't know about you but i feel the inspiration i see what god is doing hallelujah and you know what i do not have to worry i've read you the scripture he's able not you he's able to present us faultless it ain't in your hands it's his it's in his hands hallelujah oh come on somebody find me somebody in the bible from genesis to revelation who was worthy hallelujah none was worthy that's what the book was all about that's why when the lamb took the book the bible said there was nobody worthy only one who was worthy hallelujah that means everybody outside of jesus christ who makes the rapture makes the rapture by grace and grace alone hallelujah it ain't about your systematic worship hallelujah it ain't about how you looking how you perform hallelujah is what god has determined you to be from the foundation of the world and the devil don't like it but there's another thing he can do about it the word is fixed and it can't be changed people say well oh praise god i can live any kind of way i want to well that just show you you ain't got nothing hallelujah because if it's truly a seed of god yo let me explain perfection see a lot of times we think perfection and i thought it this way for a long time we think perfection is i got my shoes on right i got my right colored shirt because see sometimes some people don't like you wearing colored shirts because they think that's wrong yeah it's true i know preachers right now who will not allow you to preach in their pulpit because of a colored shirt nonsense god wouldn't even care if i didn't have one on if i didn't have one to put on that is foolishness oh you say well what brooks are you insane what about the africans that he preached to didn't have no clothes on and they ran to get on blankets god gave them the holy ghost before they got clothed who knew of noah only god knew him and god called him but the perfection and work which i'm working with is not my touch not taste not handle not that's not perfection that's law hallelujah you know what perfection is if your earnest desire to do the perfect will of god every day that's perfection you're gonna make mistakes oh the bible said abraham was a perfect and upright mind was he not was not jose jobe perfect and upright did they make mistake yes in other words job would not have never had to even offer for sacrifice if he was that kind of perfection hallelujah is that right enoch enoch why is it not written that enoch did this and enoch did that and then i did this you know what it says he not walk with god hallelujah in other words as god talked to him and instructed him he followed the rules his perfection didn't come by just that his profession came by the blood of jesus christ without the shedding of blood there is no remission of sin hallelujah your perfection don't come by how wearing a tuxedo or wearing something it's all right if you got it i got a few tuxedos at home and i desire to wear it the church sometime but i thought no i don't want nobody to think i'm trying to be nothing sometimes i just put them on and see whether i can still fit them hallelujah you hear what i'm saying because i know if i wear my tuxedos people going to think what is he doing i'm wearing my tuxedos but let me move on by god's grace i'm working with the inspiration what's going to happen when the churches are closed you're shut down you got no clothes you got no food you know whatever they're going to do they're going to run us out of this place hallelujah you know why they're going to run us out i'm going to tell you remember i told you last week about the exodus the third exodus and i made a point i said when when joseph died there in egypt the jews should have gone back to the homeland but they did not why they were in goshen like the bride of jesus christ we're safe hallelujah we're enjoying the clothing and enjoying the food and enjoy we're just at a relaxed state and god says i can't bless you till you come back to your home hallelujah and god put the pressure on israel just to do what drive them back home was that was that the last time no sir even after they got into these great countries when they got busted up from titus and all the rest of them hallelujah you know what they did they got in germany they got in france they got in all these great countries and they began everywhere that you would go they prospered naturally but god said i can't move until you go back to your homeland hallelujah so he released stalin in all a mussolini and hitler and what did they do by the tender hand of jehovah they drove them back home just like pharaoh did with israel hallelujah and your day and my day is coming it's a shame that the bride of jesus christ with all of this word god got to put pressure on us calling the squeeze to get us back to the bible oh it's coming we too relaxed we're enjoying everything too much and you think this corona would have us praying more i'm saying oh my god message people don't eat fast don't get quiet people don't know what faster here more or less praying huh but oh don't you worry about it because fasting and praying is in the equation and whether you do it on your own or not god is going to make it happen hallelujah come on inspiration you got to be under the inspiration what inspiration that god we we've laid back so long and the seals were open in 1963. look how long it's taken us to realize something majestic has happened look how long it's taken us amen to realize amen this is our day our hour and our message what is it that the very god who was separated from the adam and eve has now returned to re-clothe us hallelujah to cover our nakedness the same god amen that that separated himself from adam and eve because of their sins hallelujah has come back and justified us hallelujah and has given us an unconditional covenant something that cannot fail something amen that god has said listen this is what i'm doing for you you can't do for me i've tried everything hallelujah with you all kinds of covenants and you break everyone so now i'm going to give you one that you cannot break hallelujah i don't know about you that makes me feel really good hallelujah that is my protection that is your protection that is the only way we'll make heaven because he's our protection hallelujah is that right no man can save his own soul god is the only savior of the soul hallelujah listen moses a great highly polished theologians great man born to be a prophet yay and all his theology and his books knowledge of god could not deliver the children of israel by knowledge hey so what your knowledge your knowledge do not deliver you anybody know what i'm talking about you got things in your life right now that needs to be delivered but you got all that knowledge that ain't what delivers you you know what deliver you it is the anointing it is the holy ghost it is the inspiration that breaks and destroy the yokes hallelujah that's why you and i we need the holy ghost i say like this tonight we need more of it now than we've ever needed it before hallelujah we need god to saturate us so much so that we're drunk and out of our minds hallelujah oh glory to god you love the lord something's moving people i'ma tell you because when i was in arizona and i saw that young man uh asian man chinese he's standing about six three six four amen and and i'm preaching on in the park he comes to weep in even at the church he's weeping when the last time you see somebody repent and they're crying can't even find it in church a big tall man crying and weeping you don't know what that did for me it had set my soul on fire because i realize there's still some more out there hallelujah one two or three lord whatever it takes deliver them lord direct me let me be moved by that inspiration to find these people hallelujah don't you don't you don't you dare think you can sit here like you got it all together god said listen i'm able to raise these stones i can call stones if you don't do it i call stones to cry out hallelujah there ain't no rock on crowd for me hallelujah you can sit up here and think well praise god listen god ain't starting about your religion god is he's more concerned about you listen this is what i was saying even today don't we so worried about the eyes outside let us con be concerned about the inside let god clean the inside of the cup that's right that's what jesus said to the pharisees i will live you're dirty you're filthy inwardly you dirty and filthy the cup needs to be clean and we all need a cleansing of the heart hallelujah you love the lord hallelujah you see the prophets cannot go by knowledge he got to go by inspiration inspiration huh let me ask you a question do you think samson had enough knowledge to know that he can he can kill all those philistines ain't enough knowledge in the world one man against 400 800 philistines a thousand high he he packed him up in heats that ain't no knowledge that ain't even human power that's the only ghost power how are you listen let me say it like this with all this knowledge how are you going to defeat the world council of churches how are you going to get out of this thing that's coming your way like a tidal wave hallelujah it's the inspiration brother man said we will we will we will we will crest every way it's not like we're not going to be confronted but we'll be inspired the message of the hour inspires you to do what be a conqueror even today somewhere my wife was telling me she heard it on the radio all of the churches are getting together to resolve their differences today and while we're over here taking our time ramses is growing hallelujah hey it's coming everything he's prophesied has come to pass thus far and it is coming you and i are going to be put in a position amen if we don't join this thing coming up amen we will be the ones persecuted amen hallelujah are you hearing everybody oh we all need to go back to church oh people don't be deceived it's the intellectuals saying we need to all come back together it's the intellectuals and what they're doing they are literally coming together to form the mark of the beast wake up and see where in this day we're in this hour and i keep trying to tell people i said don't you understand what satan has done he's locked out all of the world why why why why he's done it because he's getting ready to change the whole order it looks wicked it looks wicked they're tearing down statues and all kind of crazy stuff it is wicked but satan has something up his sleeve people he's changing the whole facial of america it's the truth and you and i must wake up to the smell of coffee because this same machinery is going to come your way it's going to make a turn right it's going to make a turn because as soon as this thing the more scientific it become the more the bride of jesus christ resists it because our god is not science our god is god hallelujah and that's the battle that has always been the battle lucifer and and jesus micah however you want to say it but that's the whole battle faith versus science hallelujah is that right that's what he gave eve in the beginning he gave her science and his science work his signs work children were supposed to come by by the spoken word we're supposed to be no babies like there's not going to be no babies in heaven babies in the new world it won't be can you imagine nursing a baby for eternity come on it makes no sense god will turn the people back to what he intended them to be from the beginning amen hallelujah and i'm so glad about it oh my the prophet cannot you see let me tell you something just like somebody told me the other day uh when i was in south carolina brother simon said to me said you know what my wife them told me he said i better be careful how i'm preaching because that same um kind of preaching gonna cause you to become a martyr and it was so funny because my son told me the same thing i ain't gonna be no mortal not that i would be ashamed to be one i don't care but that's not what i have been ordained to be hallelujah i'm the bride of jesus christ and i know there are people dying every day oh yeah yeah but my point is i i when i had cancer when they told me i had cancer you know i didn't i didn't ask god to heal me so i can be popular i said lord the only reason why i would ask you to hear me if that's what you want to do i'm not afraid to die i said the only reason why i'm asking you amen to heal me i said because if i can do something if i could be here when this change come this rapture take place if i can be part of mount zion showdown then so let it be hallelujah and you know how he answered me he healed me hallelujah so how could i be afraid of this hour when i know i've been ordained for this hour hallelujah i'm not afraid and i look at these things and you look at people like what's wrong with you you can't say it hey elijah and elisha had the same anointing and however elijah acted elijah got to act the same way hallelujah that's all i'm saying you say you got the elijah anointing and you're afraid to preach truth hallelujah amen come on it's the truth let's move on i'm talking about the inspiration the inspiration takes the fear of god fear of the devil out of you perfect love casts out fear you can't cast it out perfect love will cast it out hallelujah yeah is that right let me ask you how many of you can face a lion you think you won't get scared at first oh yeah your flesh will faint if god don't hold you up all you got to do he ain't got to give out you don't even have to give out a real roar huh hallelujah is that the truth and i ain't gonna be i'm gonna listen folks you know i'm gonna tell you i'm afraid of big dogs my flesh don't like big dogs oh y'all don't want to tell the truth you know what i could love dogs but them big dogs that like to bump you around y'all looking at me like y'all ain't scared you don't have to tell me nothing you might try to hold your faith you might try to hold let me say it like this until god drops in courage and strength let one chase you huh just let one i ain't talking about one on a leash i'm coming one off the leash let him and let's see what you're gonna do if god doesn't drop an inspiration on you you know what you're gonna do scream and then run that's just that's it you ain't gonna challenge no bad lion and you ain't gonna oh praise god yes no no no no no no think about the early church when the inspiration struck them huh they weren't afraid of rome they weren't well they weren't afraid of the arena you're going to die we're going to feed you to the lions and the inspiration struck them and they ran to the lions that's not human that's supernatural and our god is supernatural that's the inspiration we're under hallelujah is that right it was taken out of the hands of man brother branham even there even in his his showing the vision and he says listen he said i've taken you this far i can't take you no further but you see those blooded footprints follow them what was the bloody footprint that was calvary that was jesus that was joshua i can't take you no further as a man i've taken you as far as i can take you see the bloody footprints y'all understand me that's what what i'm working with amen brother branham has taken us as far as he can take us hallelujah he couldn't lift himself up it took those seven thunders to lift him up to where he's supposed to be that's all i'm telling you something happened there one blast seven angels was the manifestation of that white rock he said the angels i i got quotes if you need them he said the angels of the lord not angel angels of the lord came and picked me up people said oh there were seven men they could not have been brother ben said i first saw them as seven small birds then i saw them as seven pigeons then the next thing they came they came as seven angels hallelujah y'all am i right he said even the seven angels formed the wig over my head now they couldn't have been men could not have been oh people said well it was the theophanies of of uh uh of the seven angels of the seven church ages no it wasn't each one of those angels had a supernatural being revealing the word to them hallelujah you said well what do you mean brother because the seven angels were the seven thunders and guess what it was a hidden mystery that only they knew because god had told them hallelujah the brotherhood said did you see that other one that notable one that notable and he said that was the seventh angel so that you understand what he's trying to tell you that particular one represented jesus christ only because when it comes to the number seven every time you read seven seven seven seven always represents god hallelujah three is perfection and seven is completion i know i'm spitting grapes right now but it doesn't matter you got to realize that even if it's just oh oh you said well gabriel visited me well who was gabriel but christ who was micah but christ they just had they were they were immorphy it got him off they changed his mask and every time gabriel come hallelujah he says something's great going to happen why when christ steps on the scene something's about to change people of god i'm trying to tell us something you've got to come up these statues you what every trial you come through you got to whoop the devil climb jacob's ladder hallelujah that's what's making a rapture y'all hear what i'm saying now the truth of the matter is a lot of time if you're looking at your flesh you'll never see the virtues huh this old this old nasty house you're living in cannot reflect christ it's when god takes over hallelujah you said what do you mean brother branham was crossing that fence going to pray for that brother hallelujah he forgot that the bull was there all of a sudden he eat the bull he crossed the fence and the bull raised up a killer bull just killed a colored man not long ago he said i reached i went to reach for my pistol now was that a man instinct did there was fear there come on something was happening that made him look for the god hallelujah thank god for perfect love that's what people don't understand perfect love is not a thing perfect love is god himself that's the only perfect love and that's god god came on the scene and to make you know it was god brother branham said i just wish i could stay in that presence all the time it wasn't something that he stayed in all the time it was something that visited him even when it came to the bees something visited him that day cast that fear away and took control hallelujah is that right shadrach meshach and abednego you know they were how many of you come on somebody will see a blazing fire i ain't scared that's a lie flesh will fail you i know some people who are afraid of spiders flesh grown people they can't help it that's just their weakness and my point is is we need god we need that inspiration we need that visitation this thing is not collectively it's by by individuals every individual listen we're talking about marriage we're talking about a union union we're talking about god speaking secrets to you god ain't telling everything to everybody hallelujah and god you must understand coming to this rapture god ain't telling everybody and when he tells you something he knows you can keep it quiet just one little thing would have given us away right half hour silent brother i'm saying he said just one little thing moving could would have given us away the angels had to stop the seraphim had to stop everything had to stop hallelujah whatever was going on in heaven is stopped for who you and me so that we wouldn't be deceived god can never be deceived he didn't want the devil to get hold of it so that's what i'm trying to tell you amen before god can give you whatever it is you've got to come to a place where he can trust you um you know what i'm saying you can't be like samson's wife told her the secret about the about the lion and the the you know and the caucus and the bee and the honey and and the next thing she knows she done told all of phillips dies and when samson brought the riddle he found out that she they had they had they knew the it was too easy for him they knew see god looking for somebody that ain't gonna spill the beans when he can tell you something you can keep it that's what you call strength you love the lord give me a few more minutes you see one thing i and i anyway let the devil make fun of you people going to make fun of you especially now because you're saying man i'm in the message and you know what one thing i know about the message is not going to bring me to a system it's not going to turn me around and make me look at something that's already passed onward christian soldiers marching after war with the cross of jesus going on before and you and i must understand this is a time amen that god is saying wake up you need to get under this inspiration hallelujah you know anybody they don't get under it jesus was right there in jerusalem and people were still calling him devils a devil and here was these prostitutes and tax collectors and among us and everything else and they caught the inspiration when the religious people was looking over there and says who is this you see what i'm saying that's how it's going to be now so simple it passed right through you you know why because people are looking for great men of god great men of god hallelujah i can't help but chuckle sometimes because that's the way people think great men of god ain't no great men of god none you ain't great it's the god that's in you that's great and you say well what do you mean brother brooks i'm saying listen god will use some some nobodies am i right or wrong yes let me say it like this remember the rancher's son the man wanted to find her daughter uh for his wanted his son to marry and and you know he went among the wealthy and the rich and and that represents the organization denominations and while they were partying having a good time church folks drinking and smoking and lying and doping you know what i mean doing all those things and expect god was going to choose you to be something you know where he found her in the backyard rejected no shoes washing throwing dishwater out you think those stories would just give us just to make you feel good no it's a parabol jesus spoke in parables and god through the prophet was speaking in parables and the people in this message still ain't caught up yet why because we're so busy trying to be something god don't care about your shouting and your dancing that's what he was showing they had a pentecostal jubilee and god bypassed all of that and found somebody who thought and knew that they were unworthy that's what god wants he want to find a christian that that knows they're not even worthy to be a christian hallelujah and when that when that when that ranch's son saw her saw her character because that's what he was after he was at the character he's still out the character hallelujah he was out the character this is the inspiration of the day character not your own crisis character you can't take nothing with you if you don't believe me ask the egyptians all they thought was they could take all their gold and their treasures with them oh bury me with my treasure the only thing that treasure did was feed those grave robbers ain't going nowhere i don't care how diamond your diamond ring is when you die your diamond ring is standing right here y'all understand me the only thing you're going to pack with you is character whatever you are in character will determine your destination glory to god oh that that young lady says you know i can't be yeah but you're the one i like you don't want to i chose and then when she received his inspiration somebody help me here i'm paraphrasing i got it but when he she received his inspiration it was like he put a kiss on her when god kisses you you'll never forget it hallelujah i'ma say that again when god kisses you you'll never forget it hallelujah and that little girl says i don't care what you say he don't talk to me and he doesn't promise me i'm his bride you can laugh at me and i don't care if i'm poor as all get out to uh poor as dirt all i know is what he promised me and i'm saying amen so what i'm trying to tell you it's just the attitude you and i must have in this message take the promises whatever he says about you receive your promises stop crucifying yourself hallelujah live up to the expansion with joy in the presence of the lord there's fullness of joy and that's where i find that we we can tell when people are not in the presence of god because there is no joy hallelujah in the right hands what pleasure's forevermore i have pleasure in christ i don't need nobody else's i have pleasure in christ there's nothing like a holy ghost feeling oh somebody help me here you love the lord now listen here it is y'all believe the bible according to isaiah 43 1-7 but now thus said the lord that created thee o jacob and he that formed thee o israel fear not for i have redeemed thee i have called thee by thy name thou art mine when thou passes through the waters i will be with thee hallelujah and through the rivers they shall not overflow thee when they are walking through the fire thou shall not be burned neither shall the flame kindle upon thee now think about it we've seen it happen we've seen it shadrach meshach and abednego we've seen it we've seen it when when israel crossed the the the river and and and the jordan red sea and the jaw we've seen it hallelujah we've heard and we've seen amen when they threw john amen into a a big of oil to burn him he cook him whatever they were trying to do hallelujah don't you see what god is doing he's trying to show you that you have become invincible to the elements of this world if the seals being opened has placed us back like the prophet god said into a place before we sin that means the full authority of a son and daughter of god has been restored but it cannot operate without the faith of god you need faith to operate it what did god do promise you a rapture he promised you a rapture and then he raptures brother branham for the moment brother brandon wasn't the only one that was raptured paul was too paul said i was caught up in the third of heaven i don't know whether i was in the body or out the body that's what he said and god comes right around and take the last angel messenger and he catches him up and all he can do is come back and says i was caught up those seven angels picked me up and i was in the constellation you know what when he came back he couldn't remember a thing think that like god come right back and then those seven angels he said oh i got he said you see how mysterious he's in the seventh seal he said you see how mysterious this has been the angels of the lord has visited me he said i was going to open those seals according to my own knowledge you know reading this book and reading that book and things like that you know and everything he said but uh then then the angel the minister the inspiration would come people said like i said this morning it could not have been the seven church age messengers it was not their theophanies these men had to have angels to minister to them throughout the church ages hallelujah but those seven angels one blast and seven angels came one god and separated himself in seven ways ministering they may have had separate bodies but it was god who was doing the ministry hey there's nothing nothing nothing nothing that you and i can claim and say we did anything huh calling micah calling gabriel call him whatever brother better say when that angel went down to see see see abraham he he jumped into three bodies and then he said two of those angels went down to sodom just trying to confirm to you that oral robbers and billy graham's ministry was of god and he said that one that stayed with abraham the elected the chosen hey y'all i'll tell you what i don't know when when people gonna really receive that the elected the chosen of god you everybody can't see this but he chose you to see it he y'all believe that you believe in revelation blessed is the man who hear and see it you see it you hear it you receive it let me move on so when you say what do you mean so you can understand what i mean the elements has nothing to do we you say what if you don't believe that how you're going to be translated let me ask you how when jesus rose from the dead guess what he did he walked through the wall huh well that's jesus what about philip phillip explain to me what happened to you how would you translate it and you found yourself in the desert no chariot right huh you say oh brother what you're saying well what about when peter james and john when they were in jail and he'd come to his angel nobody saw the angel coming in and going out but the doors were swinging wide open y'all don't believe that i believe that with all my heart hallelujah my same god amen he turned water into wine now if he did it then he can do it when we need it he called fish and bread and all these things that fouls are there hey this government or governments no matter where they are they hate the bride because the bride represents the truth and as long as we're here we're spoiling their program it is only after the pride is gone when satan can do whatever he wants to do but as long as we're here we're spalling his program hallelujah you love the lord oh yes let me let me just read it so you say listen in series of time signs of the end time he says well then i turned again and i thought lord god what does this vision mean i wondered and then it come to me not a voice just come to me oh that is the angels of the lord coming to me my new commission and when i thought that i raised up my hands and said oh lord jesus what will you have me to do and the visions left me for almost an hour and and i couldn't feel now you people know that the blessings of the lord is what the blessing of the lord is but the power of the lord is altogether different the power of the lord in them kind of a places i felt it many many times before envisions but never like that i feel it feels like a reverent fear i was so scared until i was paralyzed in the presence of these beings so he was in the presence of seven beings and he felt paralyzed now have you noticed the mysterious part of this week now he's opening up god is ministering to the seven seals that what it is that's what it's been it's not it's been not a human being a man it has been the angels of the lord and there is witnesses of three sitting in here that a week ago a little over a week ago i was up way back in the mountains near nearly in mexico and two brethren that's sitting here picking cocker barrels off sam uh the sandburgs off the trousers leg and a blast went off that almost looked like shook the mountains down now that's right i never told my brethren but they know they noticed uh but they noticed a difference and he said unto me now be ready go east here is the interpretation of that vision see now to let you know brother softman has not got the net game that he went after we was trying to get it for him and he said now tonight for assigned to you he isn't going to do it just you just consecrate yourself at this time for the visitation of these angels now let me ask you a question if brother branham had to constantly create himself for the visitation of those angels what do you think you got to do huh you gotta consecrate yourself you think god's just gonna drop things down without consecration huh think about it even even when it came to uh uh uh uh uh uh how could esther even when it came to esther esther says listen i'm going to consecrate myself i got god i want god to do something here huh said i don't want nobody eating or drinking for three days oh i wonder can we do that still three days don't eat or drink three days he could have been could have been in this generation and all the people fasted for three days because she says if i perish let me perish that's the inspiration i'm going to see the king huh and god answered her prayer ah she was moving under that inspiration she cared nothing about her life her whole desire was to see the people of god saved yeah it wasn't just about her she could like like like uh her uncle said mordecai said you could just stay in this castle but you know one day it'll catch up with you they're gonna find out you're a jew one day or the other or you could think well god put me here for such a time as this and that's what god has done for us but tell you something people to whom much is given much is required we can sit up here and think oh i got it made but god didn't give us this this blessed message to sit still on it but you know what you can not move until the inspiration comes what is an inspiration i'mma close i'm not done i'm still i'm gonna lay onto this thing lord willing i'll be here uh sunday uh the ninth of next month brother simon will be coming he'll be preaching for us on saturday and sunday simon smith he'll be coming already got his ticket and everything so he'll be coming on the ninth or that weekend of the ninth so let's prepare for him and uh but i am going to be laying in on this because i really believe that it is so important for us to see where we are because see it's when you get laid easy when everything gets easy when you look like what we're doing now right satan shut down everything people are relaxed even the christian instead of saying oh my god god is doing something i better make myself ready because remember that was the inspiration of the girl i'm gonna make he don't promise me but i must make myself ready see we want god to do it all for us but you must make yourself ready amen hallelujah those who cease from sin what will suffer in the flesh you're going to suffer in your flesh your flesh is going to want to do everything you always ever wanted to do but you got to have a greater power on the inside like we all say great is he that's in me than any he that is in the world it's true it's true y'all know that it is true i know i'm up here and i i'm acting like a a a child but i can't help it i feel so good right now until i'm beside myself hallelujah normally when i was in in the nomination i'll be shouting and dancing and everything else running right now but i'm feeling that now with control huh i'm feeling that with control i don't need i don't i don't have to do all of that now i'm letting this thing saturate my being a divine influence directly and immediately exerted upon the mind or soul that's what an inspiration is hallelujah you love the lord he opened that book and i say this by by the grace of god and he restored the seed look what the prophet of god says he said man is always praising god for what he's done always looking forward for what he will do and in no and in ignoring what he's doing it's always been that same thing and everybody has got his own private interpretation god is his own interpreter god don't need no one to interpret the bible said it without interpretation it don't need man god interprets the bible himself god said let there be and there was light that sheltered god said a virgin shall conceive and she did that settled it and when god says anything and vindicate it that's his interpretation of it so i'm saying if we allow people to take away the cloud you're literally allowing the devil to take away your rapture take away all your promise take away everything the messenger stood for because that was the highlight of his ministry to do what point you to jesus christ like the first john the baptist pointed his disciples to jesus christ and that same anointing that was on elijah then says i must decrease and he must increase y'all hear what i'm saying hallelujah i don't have a prophet growing up in me i have jesus christ i'm growing up into him and he's growing up in me let's stand i'm telling you i i can't explain what i'm trying i'm just trying to preach it the way he gave it to me all i know is it's it's really disturbing when you see it ain't taking hold to people you know you can't make it happen it just you pray that somehow the people would chew it like could go home and chew on it amen until it becomes a part of you because i'm going to tell you something being part of the message system is not what savior no more than a baptist system or pentecostal system or catholic system save you none of that has any saving grace it can teach you it can program you it can show you how to do it right but that doesn't mean nothing if the true life of god is not in you you and i need life and only christ can give us that life there's so many that's why people fall away like fly because they did it right they did it right they did it right but they never came in contact hallelujah and if you don't come in contact with jesus christ you'll never be impregnated with it hallelujah there's got to be an impregnation of god in you hallelujah and you can't just your system can't do that like i said this morning one thing the system cannot do and that is give you divine love it can tell you how to be nice to each other oh you know and like i said i mean even our prophet said that a system like like like christian science can manufacture all of those virtues it ain't real we don't want manufacturing we want birth we want god to birth every one of those virtues in us so that it will feel every crack in every place in our souls right that the very life of god will be on display that's me maybe i'm insane sometime i i get so happy i start laughing i don't mean i'm not trying to be disrespectful i just can't help the way i'm made i'm just made different and i i love being this way i really do would you rather not me laugh than to cry or whatever i don't know but i just it's me and god made me this way i'm so glad to be the way i am i am so happy to have come the way i've come i can't change a thing i ain't trying to change i don't spend too many of my years as a christian trying to change me [Music] in all my effort i can't do it but i know the man who can i know the man who can and that's what he's trying to tell us you know you got people all through life you don't think those people are coming at the well the one causing adultery this and over here always trying to change i'm so sick of living this life listen to this i'm sick of this but then they had to find somebody who could change them and jesus christ is the only one that can change my heart oh god help us know change us jesus from glory to glory change us lord and we'll be careful to give you the praise and glory and the honor help us now in jesus christ [Music] hallelujah [Music] hallelujah [Music] i know [Music] is [Music] is [Music] because [Music] yes [Music] is [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] his word [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] is [Music]
