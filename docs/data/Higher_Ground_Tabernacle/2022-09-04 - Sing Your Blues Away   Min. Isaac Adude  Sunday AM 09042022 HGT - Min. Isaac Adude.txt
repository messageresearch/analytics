TRANSCRIPT
========================================
dear father god because we have needs that's going on hello we are here father god because we have questions though we came here father god because we wanted a fellowship with you hello we came here because we wanted to hear from you so that's why we pray oh father god that you take us out of the way lord could you remember your man lord and you speak to your people lord we pray father that you bless the heart so father we hear the word the goddess let us make let us put it in practice lord i pray father that you help me to be so sensible to the holy spirit so that i can only say what you want me to say amen the first two chapters of numbers what we've read amen you will see that in chapter 11 people complain and the word destroyed and chapter 21 you'll see that people spoke against moses and against god and the same thing happened with him by here and now here paul says you see baldi it meant that those things happen to us this shows no evil to be they don't think those things happen so that it can be a warning to us if we do the same thing we might have the same result but god is so merciful yeah he doesn't give us a trial that we can't we can't overcome you don't improve because it happens that sometimes you said before was it priest sometimes things don't go as plain sometimes it feels like a man you you are like in the box and you don't know where to go there are troubles on your left troubles on your right troubles in front of you and troubles behind you and you just don't know what to do and as a is the expression of dissatisfaction expression the dissatisfaction he meant to complain it means that you're not satisfied with the thing that's going on amen and if we bring it to uh the thought of this morning you're meant to complain it means that you're not satisfied with what god is giving you you're meant to complain about the meaning of god god is making a mistake somewhere because when we got through tribals when we got through trials god knows exactly what we're going through exactly god sees us he knows exactly what you what you're going through i mean i'm not satisfied with the way you treating me it meant by everything that happens to us for a reason amen the bible says in revelation you have to overcome who would be vancouver you meant to beat with him let me try to find it uh if i can find it i think if at the end of every age is ah amen um let's let's even take a revelation chapter two we read uh verse seven apocalypse versus set amen the bible says that he that has here let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches to him that overcomers as luke ivanka will i give to it with the tree of life which is in the midst of the paradise of god to him that overcome it all those kings i would convert you to syria a man on his way back this is instrumental they came in and came to came to meet him make you see that give me your honor they came to meet him the bible says that he gave him the communion abraham a part of himself but we don't want to wait until god answers those prayers for example lord let this uh uh when i'll say this son and this sign let that means that i can go and and you you want me to go to fulfill to be fulfilled you go and you make a choice and then after that you change your prayers yeah you'll be like lord if it's not your will don't let this work is it true this they that wait upon the lord shall renew their strengths they shall mount it up with wings teach all the bridges around let's go to the point and say now lower nothing in my arms or bring this i simply to uh simply to the cross god is not here listening to your prayers anymore um it feels like god is silent in austria amen you praying but there is no feedback even though it and see what kind of reaction what kind of reaction he will find in him the reaction but when he took his sheep and took his ass and took his camels and took his children i'll see what job says now and he said the lord gave and job said the lord gave and the lord taken away blessed be the name of the lord he found what he had told satan he had in jeopardy the spirit come upon the prophet and he screamed this let's pray evidence of the prophet i know my redeemer and at the last days he'll stand on the earth though the skin warns uh destroys this body yet in my flesh i shall seek god whom i shall see for myself shall behold and not uh he meant to wait and see what he had told the devil if it is still true see the videos meaning that every time that the triumph every time that you go through a hard times or a trial yes before the trials god tell the devil god tells the devil about you that he is able to overcome this trial that he is faithful when he trusts me so he gives him a way to come and tempt you you are called that permission so god will be there aside and waiting and to see if the sin report ahead in you if it is still the same him and he teaches his students about about something the teacher will be there waiting that the cheater that his student would do the same thing as you told them all the instructors i mean i tell i i told this this uh this lesson before and i i explained to them everything so i'm not too worried about my children because i know that they will pass this test but when those children pass the test the teacher will be so proud and will go tell other teachers you know i told you that they would do it that is the same way that god feels when we when we overcome you that is the same way that god feels when we pass all our trials all our tests like an engineer as an engineer yeah when you have a project for example you want to build something let's say for example an uh uh an engine or or or a house or whatever example let's say for example uh uh a martyr of something example has to make those prototypes and test them to make sure that what he's putting out there is the same i mean he's a real deal what people will buy people will buy people what i would tell the people that's what they would be buying if an engineer has to make as to go you know put his project through you know tests and then he has to test you know different different test frictions and all those kinds of tests that's the same thing with god see the members amen the god tries you may god test you it will amen to make sure that you are the real children of god to make sure that there will be nothing that will come and then we take you away what are almonds there will be no doubts that will come and take that away from you amen god trust you jews every son that cometh to god must first be tried shakthis given if we walk up and say i believe that jesus christ is the son of god he died for my sins and and rose again the third day that and your abilities and all that you have capacity you lay that on the altar that with nothing in your arms the prophet said that satan satan is going to shoot every dart at you he can as you can see but then if you turn aside from there and say well i'm sorry the bible said that you are illegitimate uh illegitimate children and not the children of god you know is unfounded because god tests every son of abraham amen we are abraham's seed and our hairs according to the promise that's the spirit that abraham had he had the promise given and if our father trusted god and if our father trusted god and took a promise to confirm you it took a promise an impossibility he had onto it for 25 years equipping before it was ever manifested accomplishment getting stronger all the time he sit just like the father no matter what happens we when we when we when we prayed for so much to come particularly when we get everything out of the way god came and showed god god showed up and told him to and and told him to leave his his uh uh parents house and along the way god was testing him solution along the way god was mourning him fascinating because the prophet said that a character is not a gift that's good characters character is not a gift the character but the character is a victory character comes you know with trials lord help me to have faith like abraham don't worry abraham amen in other words you praying lord don't give me a child and and and and and give me a promise and let me have faith like abraham for 25 years when we pray that lord i want to i want to serve you like job job you know in other words you sing the lord whatever you'd give to job and i wanted to i wanted to i want to pray like that i want to serve you like that because the only way you have a testimony is the self manufacturing you [Music] after spending i believe 40 days without eating and drinking amen amen after that the devil came and attempted him he overcame with the words saying that it is written this is only because that is the only way that will pass our temptation that is the only way we'll become we become victorious it's having the word with us the bible says in numbers chapter 13 verse 26 to 30. and they went and came to moses this is talking about the um the spies that moses uh sent to go spy on the lane you see this this is bianca and they went and came and talked to moses and they went and came to moses and and to aaron and to all the congregation of the children of israel unto the wilderness of parent to kadesh and brought back word unto them and unto all the congregation and showed them the fruit of the land and they told him and said we came under the land whether doubt sentenced us and surely it flowers with milk and honey and this is the fruit of it was nevertheless the people be strong that dwell in the land and the cities are ward and every great and and and very great and moreover we saw the children of anak there pl 45 and the amalekite dwell in the land of the south and the haiti and the jebusite and the amoria dwell in the mountains and the canaanite dwell by the sea and by the coast of jordan the people before moses and say let us go up at once and possess it for we are able to overcome it amen those people they knew exactly what god told them about the country about the land amen god told them that this land you know their their milk and honey flows is true you said that you know there are great fruits in the land and milk and honey flowing the land is good it's exactly what you say even they will step on us like little kids you want to come to these moses we don't have the army that our army is not strong enough to fight this uh uh to fight these people for combating caleb stood up and tell them to stop complaining about this stop whining about all those things and god is able to to overcome it remember we are able to overcome it because god bless us up god gave us the word jews are you will see it and you will see the result it will be really restricted stop complaining stop crying about this remember just have faith have faith because the god who promised it but there are no chains that god cannot break break i say amen there are no reasons that god cannot we cannot uh break we can that god cannot break me out of nepal the salvation of the lord [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] death knock knocks on your door the prophet you have the decision to make this is your problem either you have to you have to cast it away or to accept it women you you have the name of the lord jesus amen i have been healed before the foundation of the world when god shared this blood for my healing do you have assistance she had his blood so that i can be here to shout it was time for her to give some thanksgiving it was time for her to sing she started singing a new song you've been sick for so long [Music] their defense is departed from them lord defense and the lord is with us for the lord is with us he that is in you then he that is in the world so there is nothing to fear because you have god inside of you amen you have the greater one inside of you a man is greater to speak the word to your sickness and you will be here he knew that he was he knew that he wasn't fighting a combative and joshua knew that he was fighting by himself joseph and he knew that he had the angel of the lord with him he knew that god was fighting for him to do combative amen you're not fighting your trials alone you're not fighting these battles alone there is no temptation there there is no temptation taken you by such as is coming to men but god is faithful who will not suffer you to be tempted above you are able to do that but will with the temptation also make a way to escape that you may be able to bear it i thank oh my god knows your abilities he could never capacity and he knows exactly what to give you and whatever he gives you and he also makes a way to escape it may also makes a way out to overcome it the the the victoria it might be testing trials and temptations they don't always means that you have been forsaken they know it's a character that god is forging out of you character could you forge god is making a character god is making a person out of you informing person of who my god is making you you don't come for me so that you can have a testimony so that you can have something to share that you can have something to say because just she prayed all night the prophet she was praying and the prayer of a mom of a mom stop the plane that she stood there before she stood there before her house waiting for the prophet the prophet for hours for no dessert she didn't just pray and wait for 30 minutes no but she prayed and waited amen and god was regarding the prophet amen and when the prophet came that was the prophet she knew exactly that that was the prophet that she was waiting for exactly and her son was healed because the devil is accusing god of not being a healer basketball accused the devil is accusing god of not fulfilling everything that he said that he was going to fulfill so god needs new victorious this morning god needs new testimonies this morning not only what he did with abraham but simply clear with paul that's foreign not only what he did with joel and all the saints not only what he did with brother branham remember what he's doing with you this morning that's a god who's still here on jews the world want to see a god who's still saved and you are the person is that the person amen who's supposed to give that testimony women have delivered the children of israel you know out of egypt they told all those people how god let them cross waiting for them to do exactly what they've been telling the people they say that god is real amen when the trial came and they had to prove that that same god is real they had to stand for the they have to make sure they have to prove to the people that we're still serving the living god they had to prove to people that we're still serving a god who can deliver us them understood for god and god stood for them amen if you stand for god this morning and god will stand for you if you stand for god god will stand hey man when troubles come at your door just stand before god keep believing in him continue like abraham come abraham keep the faith god delivered keep marching continue keep on the firing line continue amen just stand for him understood for god and god stood for them so when they were cast into that fiery furnace it wasn't just something that they were reading of the bible you know it wasn't something that they just were reading all stories that their mothers or fathers told them about the past but god was there just in spare just in the spare of a moment he delivered he delivered them they knew that they were prayed up their scenes were confessed they knew that they had met all the requirements and yet he seemed to be silent what's amen god is looking for what is inside of you is your heart saying the same thing amen you might go today at work or school with hawaii your neighbors or your family family telling them that god is real lord especially when everything is going fine especially when everything is going explain you can go out there and shout and start shouting and praising god don't say but when mountains come by when mountains comes when do you still have the same testimony excuse me when troubles come true when hard times come no more do you still believe that god is able to deliver you amen so you have to make sure that whatever you say amen your heart is saying the same thing so when trouble comes which there will come a test will come in a hard time hard times will come the more we have to go through trials amen because god want to make god want us to have a good character for me but when all those things will come instead of singing the blues praising him for putting a confidence in you for having a comfortable trust in you because notice that god had to trust job but in order um him to go tell satan what job what who job was going when you have troubles when you have temptations and trials stop complaining stop talking about to stop stop whining about a realm stop complaining and crying about that amen just trust god fed confidence because complaining it's something really really bad that god doesn't like exclaiming the children of israel were complaining all the time and how many of them got they went to the what went to the promised land and then god doesn't like us to complain because when we complain it means that we're not satisfied with everything that he's doing foreign because we have to agree on something god only gives us the best that's going to work to junior don't usually so meaning that includes even our trials our temptations and everything because remember once when peter went to god and said the lord we have we have we left our houses and our wives in our children we left everything that i will give you trials i will give you temptations that will give you hard times it's a full package that it comes that it's a full package that god gives us oh [Music] to make sure that if it blesses you that you will not be proud and you won't you would still stop treating your brothers the same way that's why it gives us all that's why he gives us everything that he's given us amen so when you have trials don't complain stop praising him you can pray and thank god for it because the answer is on the way and when you pray you just wait on the lord if the musician can come and sing the song they that wait upon the lord teach me lord teach me how to wait a musician can come amen that's a prayer the lord teach me how to but i don't want to do something to be a hurry to be in a hurry and then i will miss everything just teach me lord to wait um or down on my knees till in your own good time you answer my pleas teach me not to rely on what others don't [Music] out to wait [Music] teach me lord [Music] to answer my please teach me not to rely on [Music] what others do what to wait [Music] upon the lord renew their strength they shall mount up with pleases [Music] teach me lord teach me lord [Music] upon the lord [Music] as an ego

lord upon the lord shall renew their strength they shall mount up with wings and as an ego [Music] teach me lord teach me lord [Music] teach me lord teach [Music] and i pray that this will be the prayer for everybody this morning amen to wait upon the lord because most of us if not all of us have prayed for something you still haven't gotten the thing that you've been praying [Music] [Music]
