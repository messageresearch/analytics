thank you brother surely we appreciate all of me what our musicians so only that's what we do not gonna prolong the time we just want to ask that you turn with us through psalms 103 this will be kind of like all um where we were with the meaning of Calvary but I guess we could tie this in too because of all of the blessings that Calvary gives us so let us turn to Psalms 103 and just bear with me we'll begin reading at the second verse bless the Lord O my soul and forget not all of his benefits who forgiveth all thine iniquities and healeth all that diseases who redeemeth thy life from destruction who crowneth thee with loving kindness and Tender Mercies who satisfy thy mouth with good things so that thy youth is renewed like the eagles the Lord executed righteousness and judgment for all that are pressed he made known his ways and to Moses his acts unto the children of Israel the Lord is merciful and gracious slow to anger and plenty Us in Mercy he will not always child neither will he keep his anger forever he have not dealt with us this is what I love after our sins nor rewarded us according to our iniquities for as the heaven is above the Earth so great is his Mercy toward them that fear Him as far as the East is from the West so far hath he removed our transgressions from us hallelujah like as a father pitius children so the law of paleth them that fear Him for he knoweth our frame he remembered that we are dust as for man his days are as grass as a flower of the field so he flourishes it for the wind passes over it and it is gone in the place thereof shall know it no more that's the way it is but the mercy of the Lord is from Everlasting to Everlasting upon them that fear him and his righteousness unto children's children let us pray our gracious father we thank you for your grace and your mercy we thank you for being so good to us Lord you have been better to us than we've been to ourselves and there are no words to express our gratitude towards you Lord but father search me o God if you find anything in me that shouldn't be please dear Lord take it out and strengthen us oh God because we want to be right we want to be whole Lord we want to be perfect even as your word has declared us Lord let your perfect will be done in our lives in your lovely name Jesus Christ we pray amen you may be seated you know I was thinking today thank you basically what what am I what am I doing what is it that I'm doing and um the Lord just kind of put this message on my heart I thought to go with another part of the other message there but the Lord made me see some things I had never seen before the subject of this message is the power of the word and I know if I had a subtopic it would be the influence of the rain you know the World At Large is not aware of the makings of God oftentimes men think that he's in control when he's not people don't often like the bad things that come their way because they fail to see that most of the time is for their own good you know a lot of times people do things and they expect not to reap what they sow but the Bible teaches us about the planting the sowing and the reaping and whatever Harvest you plant that's what you're going to read I was thinking about this country in particular uh there was a time when this country was founded on the word of God and as long as we were in the word and honored the word the influence of the word kept us the only reason why the Europeans or whoever it was in the beginning defeated this country is because they had God they had the word because it doesn't matter on how much your might is if God is against you you will fall and to prove my point Moses had God on his side he had the word and he there was a one-man invasion because God is the majority we as a country we had morals we had respect for elders and young old people and young people had respect for elders but all that was was because of the influence of the word if this country had not had that type of influence we would have been like the other heathens of the world that we call heathens but now we find out that that that those so-called heathens have more morals than what we have and the reason being is because we left the influence of the word you take our children most of them are still free they're not locked up in jail most of them are not on drugs or whatever the case may be but they fail to see you may have thought Mom and Daddy was mean but it wasn't mama and daddy that they were they were actually giving you the word and because of the word the influence of that word has kept you out of trouble and for real it's literally kept you from being from her death amen we fail to see that I was telling somebody I said it's hard for us to imagine God because no man have seen him at any time as he is all space all time you know and how God was at some point in time pretty much separate from his creation but then he steps into his creation and that in itself is a mystery but we fail to see that what eternal life is if we could count the years of how long it took basically to create the Earth the universe what we call our solar system that in itself is just a fraction of eternal life we can't even imagine it but that's one those that statement let there be light when God began to create everything the influence of God has always remained in his creation because he's all and in all and even this world is dark as it may be they are not aware that this whole thing is still standing on the word of God every day we're being influenced every decision we make throughout the day we're being influenced you're either being influenced by the word or you're being influenced by darkness which is the devil when we think about life eternal we can't comprehended our minds we it only can come by faith because he life eternal is one and he's the controller of everything is that right you think about even in the natural if you just take something that is symbolic of God which is the s-u-n and you take away the life or the light of that sun it may take a while for the um a manifestation of that to reach Earth but in no doubt no no no there's no way to say it won't because it will and when darkness would strike the Earth it's just dead because every botany everything that's living needs that sun to survive what is it is that influence of the Sun and and to look at the sun it you'll never hear it in the morning boasted on itself matter of fact it is so quiet you'll forget it's up there except that there'll be light and that's really the way it is with God Amen people forget he's here he's really visible to those who can see that's right him the influence of rain water think about it it has no respect a person's it doesn't matter if you are a poison ivory you still get the rain whether you be Thorns or thistles you still get the rain when that rain falls it doesn't just separate itself from the thistles the Thorns or the good flowers and plants it rains on everything and everything benefits from it uh you you may not even know this but even little pieces of sand benefits from the rain because if it wasn't for the rain you wouldn't have a rock or a stone it all works together the pressure of it everything is being influenced and I thought about that I said you know a lot of times people say oh I wish I was dead or I wish I could die but you can't just die and people have tried to commit them uh suicide and still won't die and the reason being is because it's being influenced by the almighty God and if it's not your time to die you won't die think about the many of plane crashes or train crashes or ships that went down and yet there were some survivals and I don't know how God does it all but he knows everything I was thinking about that and I said Lord yo you're so awesome and just a just to think your awesomeness can live in me that have lived and died it doesn't matter which or what country they were of and what nationality don't you know God knows exactly where they are he knows exactly what they're doing right now whether they be in heaven or hell There Is No Escape he influences everything is that right that's what David said I think it was David Isaiah one of the two he said even if I make my bed in hell Thou Art there see the knowledge of God is something that no man can escape even if he claims to be an atheist at some point in time he's got to come to the very question how did this all come about and even though he may reason within himself there is something that God has ordained in him that will always make him unsatisfied dissatisfied because the true answer is only in God y'all know what I'm saying you know how somebody asked you a question and you may answer them you know it's not quite right like what is his name you know his name is in your you can't remember his name is David but you might say Don but something tells you that's not right it's because you have that knowledge in you the truth of his name and that's how it is with God no matter how you deny him and how much you call him something else there's something in you that testify that God is real call it your conscience [Music] amen the influence of God is everywhere and people don't even realize it they think they're on you know the word of God Is Standing you know and they don't understand that the word of God is what everything sets upon and how can you be in the presence of the word it is not influence you this is why I believe God you know designed it the way he designed it to have seeds because he know that no matter what seed it is if it's in his presence it's going to live that's right and we're now in a situation in a season where you know we all come to church but we have been it has been defined it has been told to us the light of it has come to us that in every Church there's three kinds of believers and I've had to come to acknowledge that within the framework of our church everybody in here everybody that comes here don't truly believe that's right and when people can question the word of God it shows something is wrong Hallelujah glory to God think about it with all the miracles signs and wonders that Jesus did in his day the Pharisees and others came to hear and says tell us plainly claim it plainly yes yes just just give us some theological explanation on who you are wow those who were other seed saw and felt the same influence like a woman at the well we know when the Messiah come he's going to tell us all of these things same rain same God influenced whatever seed it was brought it to light those same seed that plane claimed Caiaphas himself who claimed to be a believer prophesied that a man one man would die for the whole world and yet he was one who crucified him think about it you got people in this message who have seen Miracle signs and wonders and they'll be the very ones to cry crucify him you and I must understand that the influence of this rain is something that people don't see because we're we're looking okay the latter rain we don't understand a lot of rain and that rain that influence of God comes to anoint every seed not just a bride every seed everything that he's planted must come to a harvest at this time whether it be good or whether it be evil Hallelujah the thing about it is you cannot Escape who you really are my God you ought to be so grateful to God that the world got you here on a Wednesday night huh something brought you here maybe you're not what you want to be but you know you're not what you used to be and maybe you're not what you ought to be but you know that the influence of this world the influence of God this thing that they preach to you have have literally been changing you little by little by little that means you are alive Hallelujah you know as I said when it rains even snakes enjoy that's right you know what I mean dogs enjoy it now I don't know about the cats but anyhow what I'm saying rain is something that most animals enjoy except in the winter but when the spring the summertime when life comes everybody does the birds get the singing it's a beautiful time but that rain influences the grass as well as the weeds is that right see what people don't understand is that influence of Jesus Christ not only anointed 11 apostles that were ordained of God to follow Christ but that same anointing anointed Judas huh see what people don't understand this message is not anointing just a bride it's literally anointing the judicices Hallelujah is it anointed the 70s those 70 disciples that left him look where we are look at those that turned around what was it it was the annoyed King it was that that rain that's falling that's invisible that most people can see but the bride she sees it her eyes is becoming wider and wider her understanding of who she is is now flourishing more and more and more she recognized Hallelujah that this message was a DOT designed for her Hallelujah not to curse Christ but to bless him Hallelujah not to stand against him but to stand for him Hallelujah America would have never been the country she is had not she had the word it's like Israel we call them God's chosen people why was it God chosen people because they had the word and that word influenced them that word listen when all the other countries was catching plagues as long as Israel was on the word no plague hit him right they were God was always their defense God was always the Escape is that right that's why brother random said if this country would have repented if they would have stayed a Christian Nation we wouldn't need any artillery God would fight our battles Hallelujah but look at what we've done we've left the word look what happened in Afghanistan hallelujah look what happened in the Vietnam War and all we've been losing the battles bye because we we moved out of the word and the influence of the word and because we've done that look what happens come on somebody it happens even in the families as long as the families pray together they stay together but when they move out of the presence of the Lord Chaos comes that's it God help us all you and I must understand amen how this light or message or the influence of the word has the ability to change you that's what it comes to do it how can I say it when I say change it comes to bring to light the revelation of who you really are [Music] because that woman who met Jesus Christ at the well all her life basically she had been an ill-famed woman but the truth of the matter is that light the influence of Jesus changed her from a prostitute to a saint Hallelujah she did not have to go through some psychologist God changed her what about the woman that met her met him at Simon's house look the word was there the influence was there but those who were negative those who were not seed they criticized the word is that right that's how it is here when you see people coming to church and criticizing the word it is a spirit of Darkness it shows who they are but then you look at the person that may look like trash but yet they come and they worship God they give God they all they are the ones that gets the gifts [Music] it affects us because we left the word America is one of the darkest places you can live and it's becoming gross Darkness with all of our laws with all of our regulations and guess what it is the light that is being persecuted but you know what I know Darkness never defeats life there is no possible way God has shown it through his nature he shows it every morning when the Sun rises no matter how bastard darkness is it's got to con succumb to the light that's coming and there's a battle between light and darkness almost Before Dawn they said it's the darkest before done and doesn't matter how much how thick the darkness comes life breaks through so is it with a Christian life no matter how dark your days come when you trust in the light of God God will bring a daylight he will have a Daybreak yes he will the influence of the word that's why he said if you abide in me in my word abide in you you can ask whatsoever you will and it shall be given let us not forget the benefits somebody said well brother Brooks if you don't go to heaven what what what what was that I said I'm gonna tell you something God is righteous in all of his judgment but if I had to testify even if I know I'm going to hell I'm saying Lord can I testify let me tell you something yeah it was good yes sir I'm worthy of everything you say I'm worthy of it but let me tell you something my life on Earth has been good Hallelujah you've been a friend when I was friendless you've been my mother you've been my brother you've been my father you've been my sister you've been my best friend you've been everything to me but nobody else was around you were there and when I was in my lowest of pits you come sometimes and give me a song of Deliverance y'all know what I'm talking about that influence I love it I love it hey Paul I love too is like who who who who bless the Lord oh my soul and forget not all his benefits amen who forgiveth all thine iniquity he didn't say sin he said iniquities when you know you're doing wrong and you do it anyway he forgives you hallelujah what a friend we have in Jesus [Music] all our sins and Greece he bear what a privilege it is to carry Everything To God In Prayer who heal it all dying diseases you know I was trying to get some insurance and uh they came to me and said no you got some discrepancies on your hospital record and I found out that they still had that I had cancer on there and so they couldn't give me uh insurance with that on my record and so I went to my doctor and I told him I said listen I don't have cancer and I need to prove that I don't have it right I said let me tell you something so I told him the situation and what the other doctor told me and how aggressive it was I said look at me how can I have cancer and this aggressive cancer supposedly was there I was going to do this to me and that to me years ago Look at me now he said ah he said that doctor made a mistake he said if you had cancer he said your PSA would be off the child now I feel like shouting but I got to keep on preaching but the thing that gets me because they did the stress test they did all of the whatever they call it you know what I mean and then then they gave me an MRI and everything nothing [Music] [Laughter] nothing nothing nothing so they're writing a letter have written a letter actually I have I forgot to pick it up but they have written a letter stating that I do not have cancer you know God is good who healeth all dying diseases you know what I'm saying so when you think about what God is doing in the midst of all this stuff Hallelujah you know I have to be careful because in my natural self uh it's difficult for me to be a pastor you may not understand that but I ran from it because I didn't want to be you know and when I say difficult I don't mean what I'm saying is I have to be careful that I don't get uh personalized things when things happen that's the way the battle is you know uh pastors have to be careful that day when things go wrong with that you know they don't make it personal we got to realize and keep it right we're dealing with spirits and our enemy is not people it's demons and powers and darkness but let me go on so I struggle with that sometime but that's one of my struggles but I can truly say God has always given me victory and you know how he gives me victory with the fact that I love the people because love covers a multitude of sin that that's the influence of the word you know somebody told me this and I can't remember oh somebody told now I've never seen brother but he said if you pray for your enemy and you don't love your enemy you will never get the victory I said I don't know whether he said it I've never seen it but it shows sound right to me you've got to love your enemy in order to pray for him in order to get the victory you've got to love your enemy now that's powerful and it was good for me let me move on because I got to hurry up I'm sorry I want you to just read this whole passage of scripture it's been a real blessing it is a real blessing to me the thing that I love about it is that God continues to lift his grace toward us and you know he tells us that we're like grass we're like flowers you know we pass away but his Mercy doesn't I mean he his Mercy just always his grace is always with us not only to us but to our children's children and he says uh Everlasting upon them that fear Him and and his righteousness unto children's children and you know I think about the influenced that God has had on my children and I think you know I would love them see love to see them give that give their whole lives to God but I've seen the influence hey man you understand me uh they could be locked up in jail they could be on drugs they could be out there doing whatever they want to do right but because of the influence of the word God has placed boundaries but think about when the if the word the word wasn't there if you had grown is no word and that's what has happened to America they grew up in homes with no word you know I don't know my mother couldn't read or write but she had the word the influence that she had on me is why I'm here today y'all understand me but now grandma in his clubs and grandpa is in the club and everybody's doing whatever and the Bible is nowhere to be found it's a shame it's a shame I'm dealing with America but that's all over the world what about us who are here you know it's amazing how we struggle with the children in Sunday school and and trying to beg the parents to bring them out shame on these parents I rebuke you in the name of the Lord why because the influence that these Bible studies and Bible classes were placed on your children in the long run will keep them out of trouble and don't blame nobody but you because the Bible said teach those children in the way they should go and if you teach them they will not depart but if you don't listen I'm gonna tell you something you do not have to teach your children evil because evil is always already there but they need the influence of the world to keep them straight [Music] people I'm telling you God if I had to do it all over I said a lot of things I would do differently with my children but I did my best to my understanding you know but I see I see people doing the same thing or worse then what I did I everything I did was for God it made no maybe you don't understand but I was in evangelist I ran a whole lot you understand what I'm saying I don't need to go there but what is the excuse of these people who won't bring their children to Sunday school and I hope they listen I hope that gossip tongue go out and spread this news I do if I can make somebody mad this is what I'm trying to do no discipline it's a shame let me tell you something don't you understand the influence of the word like I thought to myself I'm gonna have to go to this doctor and he claimed he's a Christian I'm gonna have to talk to him this way that way I did not have to I told him what I was wanted and I thought I was going to have to go and you know we was going to have a conference well they call me and told me see God oh I'm telling you God we'll work on your behalf [Applause] is that right just like Elijah right they said hi Elijah know all our business because God was telling him all your business man yeah the enemy of the word becomes nothing in the eyes of the Lord hello y'all better hear what I'm saying see that influence it's all around us like right now it looks like Satan has won y'all know it's the truth I mean the church people are the light of God where is it I mean you find Church those who supposed to be Christians you see their Life's a dim this is not time for the lights to be dim the light's supposed to be bright it's supposed to be set in a place where the whole world can see it but we find out Christians are becoming ashamed of the gospel of Christ many of them not all of them the truth of the matter is not supposed to be many not now just a few so if you wanted if you don't feel rained on don't feel left out you do not want to associate with somebody who's living a wicked life you better hear what I'm saying Darkness has no fellowship with light that's your Bible and if you don't want the influence of the darkness on you you separate yourself from it oh brother Brooks let me tell you something I don't have many friends and I don't have I don't need many I thank God for the ones that I have but I'm gonna tell you something I learned to do without them Hallelujah absolutely darkness is the absence of Life you've heard that before so when you see Christians walking around in darkness it's because the light of God is not shining and and understand what we're talking about let's talk about not light we're talking about Revelation is that right James said don't look in the mirror be holding your face and then forget what matter of man you're supposed to be and that's what we do we come to church we were talking about prayer you know prayer you know I praying screaming and hollering I mean you can pray like that desperation but I think a lot of times people think that when they scream and holler God gonna hear me God hear you when you're not even opening your mouth all right you know we look at these things and we we think that powers and how on how loud you get that ain't it it's a sincerity of the heart and you say well what do you mean prayer is also when you pray you must pray according to revelation you can't just call God something and you don't know he's that right you call him Lord and he's not your lord he won't even answer it's not calling like the woman thou son of David thou son of David have mercy on me now when he did say Lord she answered because he's Lord Over All you understand me you got to know your relationship the revelation of this hour what he is to you when we talk about life we're not talking about Cosmic like or but we're talking about eternal light what is eternal light the very revelation that he's still God not Buddha not Allah not some kind of isms and schisms we know the true and living God and God took all of that time to come down and and dwelt him in a man's body don't you realize that's revelation is that right let me prove it to you the Bible says in John 1 1-4 in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God that same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made is that right in him was life everything no matter who you are or what you are if you're breathing that's God's life you can't breathe you can't have no life in this world without God amen amen whatever and however he breaks it down to where a flee can breathe big is still God that's life in here was life and the life was the light of men the revelation of who men are who they are you say what do you mean we had no idea what Adam was like until Jesus came and Jesus being the second Adam showed us what a real man was supposed to be like it had nothing to do with Macho a real man is one who can follow the word who can deny himself who can who can be a sheep and let God Be The Shepherd that's what it is not my will but thine be done that's what a real man is he followed the word every inch of it whatever God told him to do he did it let me tell you all something it had to be quite humiliating for your lord and my Lord to die and hang on a cross stripped naked now you see on these pictures they got a piece of cloth around his Lawns that's not true they put that on there only not to offend people but he was naked nothing he bore your shame because we were naked when he found us and we became he became our sin that we might become his righteousness that is life turn with me now first Samuel see when the word is misplaced it always brings death always it cannot bring life Adam and he misplaced the word it brought death I think it uh me and uh brother uh Rich was talking about order God has an order everything must fall into that line of that order first Samuel fifth chapter 1-12 and I'm going to read through the whole thing I'm not going to try to break everything down but I just wanted to show you something and the Philistines took the Ark of God and brought it from Ebenezer unto ashdod when the Philistines took the Ark of God they brought it into the house of Dagon and said it by Dagon now those of you who know about Dagon diggons have fish have man hybrid and when they of ashda arose early on the morrow behold Dagon was falling down upon his face to the Earth before the Ark of the Lord and they took Dagon and said him in his place again and when they arose early on the morning to tomorrow morning behold Dagon was falling upon his face to the ground before the Ark of the Lord and the head of Dagon and both of the palms of his hands were cut off upon the thresh flow only the stump of Dagon was left to him sound like a serious battle went on when nobody was around therefore neither priest of Dagon nor any of that come into dagon's house tread upon the threshold of Dagon in ashtar until this day and let me say this just like the influence of God is moving the influence of darkness is too like I said if you could don't get the Holy Ghost you might wake up in the morning thinking you're a cat where did those inspiration come from they didn't come from heaven look look look look look at all listen and we know hell's gate was open in the 60s everybody went on Revival everything the Reviving of Rome the Reviving of Greece the Reviving of of Egypt everything and where did they do it I think in New York the vulgar and evil stuff that they did up there at a rock and roll concert and people to this day think that's one of the greatest things that ever happened and all it was was Rebellion Rebellion against Christianity Rebellion against God you know they free love they called it come on they didn't see the demon power behind it but look where it brought America to this day because of many of those same people became uh uh institutional teachers in colleges in high school and they influenced the whole America God have mercy on us people think that's great that was great but let me tell you something the world would not be in this trouble they are in it ain't just America I'm using America because this is where I live but the whole world is corrupt everything is corrupt there's no real place you call home now I don't know about y'all but I I get to a place sometime I just get so Lord I'm ready just you know not that I want to escape any uh persecution and that's not it I'm just homesick I know I don't belong here I don't treasure this if you had chicken you know what it tastes like fix it up all you want to y'all understand what I'm saying the same old stuff but the hand of the Lord was Heavy upon them of Ashton and he destroyed them and smoked them with M rods even ashtar and the and the coast thereof and you know I for a long time in my denomination we thought the imrods was hemrods but the the in some I looked it up in some places they used to use that word hemorrhoids like with him but it was actually boils it was like um two months tumors on the people and and God struck them with all that and the Bible says that these tumors weren't limited to the places that they would come up in so it actually caused a lot of pain and discomfort to the people but why why did this happen first of all they took something that didn't belong to them and they thought that this same Ark of the Covenant was a blessing to Israel perhaps it'll be a blessing to us and they failed to see it could not be because it was only given to a selected group of people who had a selected order and a selected way of doing things and and so therefore it was like they stole it it's just what happens Amen to those who are when to buy oil instead of getting the Holy Ghost they stole the tongues and they stole everything hello I mean you think about it we didn't hear nothing about Great Divine healings like we did until brother Brandon came on the scene and you saw the the discernments and all these great things that happened and then here come Janice and jambres but the original started with Moses y'all hear what I'm saying they mimic amen it's plagued with death it's black with you know their discernment I've got a feeling I gotta unction feelings and unctions that that's how they worship there when it came to Dagon you know they gone uh representer of God of multiplying you know but he was he was also uh in the beginning a Hebrew God a Hebrew item yes and so it's just one of those things that spread from one place to another y'all know how that is oh y'all don't believe that let somebody kill somebody on television and all of a sudden it spreads because what is a spirit and let me tell you something just like what we witnessed recently you watch it's coming again and the people you know they don't understand it but Darkness spreads too I'm trying to find this this thing I want to I want to listen Degas like I said was a half fish half man he was a hybrid he also there was another popular name that he went by and it was Beelzebub and you know that's the devil right right and he moves by way of popularity come on somebody like they said in Hollywood if you can get the person to laugh at it you got it and that's how it is it could be something that's really mean but you get them to laugh at it right they get the uh they did that to us in cartoons well you remember the Road Runner and how they would fight and hit each other upside the head and then your children start doing that spank for it but it was the cartoons that influenced them to do it this Darkness we're talking about starts out innocent always innocent when the famous things took the ark you know they took it from Ebenezer and Ebenezer means Stone of help they took it and moved it into ashta which means diffusion inclination theft it became a place of confusion feelings and you know what it was it was such a dog Spirit now it's amazing because if you read from one city to the next each City heard about what happened to the other City so all that gossip all that Darkness spread right and when that kind of that stuff hey what does it bring with it fear and fear brings torment hmm Hallelujah but nevertheless that images anything that is an image anything whether it be your church whether it be you whether it be anything nothing can stand the influence of the world will always throw it down now we look at this thing and I'm almost done in the message Supernatural because I really want you to understand we're being influenced every day that's why it's good to pray that's why it's good to study because you want the word to influence you through the day you wanted to have preeminence of you you you know you know things when you get ready to do something wrong you want that word to be there to influence you to do right see and if we don't if you don't if you move away from the word you're moving into darkness right Lord I haven't felt you in a long time what have you been doing in a long time you hear what I'm saying Jehovah God great Jehovah God who lived before there was an eternity wait a minute did y'all hear that he lived before there was an eternity you was without father without mother without beginning of days or ending of years and a reading upon the pages of the Sacred Book how the things that you did in the days of your that passed by and to have the privilege of living in this Dark Age just here at the end of the world and see you rise on the scene again but we don't think about it when someone get healed in this dark unbelieving generation that is the rising of the Sun that is light that is God moving and influencing hearts amen you think about it you rise on the scene again no guessing no man-made theology no cold atmosphere of just joining a church or signing a paper but living in the Shekinah Glory and the influence of a resurrected Lord Jesus confirming that's where we are and that's where we should stand confirm me that Jesus is Alive and Well the Bible said ye are the lights of the world that means you're the revelation of Jesus Christ in the world [Music] right but living in the Shekinah Glory and the influence of a resurrected Lord Jesus confirming fulfilling his word bringing to pass everything that he said yeah you get these sassy little children and says mom and daddy you just too strict on me I'll tell you one thing you better be glad that they are and understand the reason why they're strict is because they love you and they don't want the boogeyman to get you because he's surely out there y'all hear what I'm saying but when a child grow up and mature you know what they normally say mama and daddy you was right that's when you know they're growing up hey you can drive a car now right it's that's the way it is when they mature because they now know Mom and Dad's right so they're listening to the words that you say and they will obey those words and so Mama and Daddy can have confidence in that child because of the Revelation they have a poo mom and daddy is and they don't understand it Mom and Dad is is what they are is because of the influence of the word they always come back to the word Hallelujah think about it the Rich Young Ruler I love him I love to talk about him rather he was the way he was because of the influence of the word of God that has been given to him in his life he wasn't an evil person at least by the appearance but let's move on let's let's see what brother William says see he wanted to do something himself that's the way we do we want to do something ourselves the gift of God is a free gift God gives it to you you don't do one thing for it he ordained it to you and you're going to have it um Amen brother you got it everybody might have said amen but I didn't hear him notice he knew it was it was how he had to do it come excuse me but when he was confronted with how he had to do it it was different from his ritual it was different he could hold his money and belong to on to the church that he belonged to and so forth but Jesus knew that and knew that he had poured his money and and said he said go sell all you got and give it to the poor and come take up your cross and follow me and you'll have Treasures in Heaven but he couldn't do it that ended amazing the influence of Jesus brought some people to being a devil and it brought some people to being Saints the spirit of God the light of God the reign of God the anointing of God however you want to say it will always bring you to who you are at a man or a woman who's surely believed that they are Sons and Daughters of God will always come to a state of repentance Hallelujah cause before we would say we're all Devils we had the appearance of it anyway it's nothing but the truth the other leaders that he had had in his youth group youthful days has such an influence on him till he refused to accept God's provided way isn't that amazing which was Jesus Christ and we had the same thing among us people have been so influenced by doctrinal things to When You Preach Jesus it's like what are you talking about what do you mean oh my God it's amazing that people even in this message and when I say message I'm talking about Universal don't even know who Jesus is they tell you Malachi four years though yes it's a sad thing but it's true it's true and when you stop preaching this message the way I'm preaching they think you Antichrist and you're against the prophet of God and all that stuff I don't care what you think I really don't I can't stop you from thinking because while you thinking I'm a devil somebody in here is seeing light everybody is not thinking the same way and the words of God that spoken for this purpose is not received in the same manner I can't help Who You Are it's the truth how can I worry about it Jesus didn't even when he knew Judas was a devil he still loved him it's the way God has ordained it but the influence of the word will always bring forth of his kind [Laughter] you say oh brother what's what are you saying why do you think what anointing the same Jesus anointing right anointed those same peoples that cry out crucified it was the word written in the white devil who's among them but it was the presence of Jesus the influence of Jesus on those Devils that made them crucify him oh y'all don't see that yeah it is what it is my question is this why did everybody hate brother Branham after the seals were open you know why because now the Seas were being exposed those who were close to him who who pretended to be weak separated themselves and those who hated him in the beginning hated him more right only the true Seas of God stayed with it because they saw light they saw Jesus they didn't see a devil they didn't see an antichrist they saw Christ let me tell you something that same influence that same anointing is making manifest every seed yes sir amen amen when you get people in here they think they could just live any kind of way okay you can because really you can't help it if you're not born again you're going to live the life of a devil the way it is the other leaders that he had in this youthful days has such an influence on him until he refused to accept God's provided way which was Jesus Christ the only one who holds eternal life not the church can give you eternal life not your neighbor not your pastor not your priest not your Creed only Jesus Christ himself can give you eternal life no matter how good you are what you quit doing what you start doing you've got to accept the person of the Lord Jesus Christ how in the world y'all hear what I'm saying most people don't they they've never been there y'all better hear what I'm saying ask them in this church have you truly made Jesus Christ your personal savior oh no that's that's denominational that's we're in the methods I'm making fun I'm just the truth we're in the message you ain't in the message until the message is in you and the message is Jesus Christ the same yesterday the day and forever I don't care what people think my point is this people of God you will not have a charge on me that I didn't tell you the truth or you won't Jesus didn't care when they got mad at him and I don't either [Music] I'm people don't like this kind of preaching but I'm trying to tell you something no matter how good you are what you quit doing what you start doing you've got to accept the person of the Lord Jesus Christ and then when you do that he is the word and then your life fits right in the word and it manifests itself to this age that you're living in the real confession brings you to this day y'all understand me think about it I'm closing even sinners don't understand the influence because when I was a sinner there was times that I should have been killed dead and why not because of the influence of the word God had a place and a position for me if it had happened then I wouldn't be here now you hear me it was all about his gift and his purpose for me same way you don't have control over your life but there's always a force protecting you always a force moving you there's always a force trying to woo you trying to get you to see what's true but tradition have blinded the people because you was raised this way and raised that way and you grew up this way we all had all of that but there was such a greater pool I need the Lord Jesus and just like I tell the Lord I don't want to die not ready oh no I don't want to be on my bed begging God no no no I want to be like okay Hallelujah anyhow they Bosworth this is the moment I've been waiting for Hallelujah you know people afraid of Heaven they too they scared to Die Why when the world is greater the world that we're talking about is greater than this why would you you know what I'm saying you have to worry about polluted water polluted air you don't have to worry about nothing unseen oh y'all know what I'm saying we're talking about a world of bliss and people don't want to go there something's wrong Paul said I desire to go but I can't because I still got work to do um and I don't want to go prematurely I know Heaven is there I know the ram is that I have no doubt about that you know what I mean and you know I'm like I don't know when the end comes and my period my symptoms come to a period on this side because in reality is infinity you know what I mean but when it comes to appeared on this side I don't know no second left wasted I'm so sorry people say how can you say that and you got a family I said yeah I got a family and I was a part of a family and that family was a part of a family and nobody wasted a stop for nobody else they kept moving see what I'm saying is is like this when my mom died my whole world you know I came to a stop honestly I lived my life for my mom she was a Christian I lived it everything I achieved in high school was for my mom so when she died when I was going to my senior year I didn't know what else to do all those achievements that I received meant nothing to me God had to bring me down to needing him y'all hear what I'm saying and I thought that was the worst thing that could possibly happen to me yeah didn't even know how to talk about it to even my friends but now that I look around I realized it was the best thing it's kind of like Isaiah when King Isaiah died I saw the Lord that's what Isaiah said and my mom was my everything really if I had ever been in idolatry I probably was one who worshiped my mom I did everything she wanted me to do I never sass at her every one time I was correcting her in a nice way and I got slapped and it hurt my feelings so bad because I cried I'm like Mom I I had no intentions of talking back to you you don't talk back to me I think the very fact that she thought I was talking back to her hurt me more than the slap in the face that's the only time I recall but I'ma tell you something about that because of that my life changed my focus changed I didn't have Mom I needed someone and that someone came to my rescue who is Jesus Christ himself and I tell you what I have never in all my days and I became a Christian when I was young in my 19 20 years old something like that early I've never desired to turn back to the world ever you bragging brother Brooks know I'm just saying he kept me have I Fallen had made mistakes and all that absolutely a Christian every Christian had but when it comes to picking me up he picked me up he encouraged me to go on I didn't do that yeah yeah yeah yeah God is good yeah y'all don't know I'll tell you what I've come through some rough times but having everybody everybody but I appreciate the influence of God from a mother who couldn't read or write but her life influenced mine to make me want to be a Christian and I want to thank her and when I get there and see her there I'm just going to give her the biggest hugs she ever had in her life you love the Lord let's stand yeah and I I may not know the whole book but I thank God for the influence of the whole book hallelujah hallelujah Hallelujah anyhow don't let the devil get you down when this drop shot Comes Your Way hold your head up high and say hallelujah
