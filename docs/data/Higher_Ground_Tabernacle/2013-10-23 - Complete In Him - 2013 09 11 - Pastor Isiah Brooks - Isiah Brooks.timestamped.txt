[0:02] we're going to ask that you turn with us
[0:05] I've got so many places I would love to
[0:08] uh
[0:09] let's turn to Hebrews
[0:14] 11 and 40.
[0:18] this is a a series and of course I won't
[0:21] be able to finish this tonight this is
[0:22] basically a foundational type of message
[0:26] that I'll be preaching tonight
[0:29] and uh we want you from there
[0:33] to turn with us to
[0:36] second Colossians I mean Colossians 2 10
[0:39] and then second Peter 1 amen so Hebrews
[0:43] 11 40.
[0:48] amen
[0:49] God Heaven provided some better things
[0:52] for us
[0:54] that they without us should not be made
[0:57] perfect
[0:59] you love the Lord
[1:01] Colossians 2 10.
[1:07] uh
[1:08] amen
[1:15] Colossians 2 and 10
[1:21] and ye are complete in him
[1:24] which is the head of all principality
[1:27] and Power
[1:31] amen second Peter please
[1:33] first chapter
[1:42] we'll start reading at the fourth verse
[1:49] according as
[1:51] his divine power let's let's read the
[1:54] second verse I'm sorry
[1:56] Grace and peace be multiplied unto you
[2:00] through the knowledge of God
[2:02] and of Jesus our lord I really want you
[2:05] to really take note at Peter what he's
[2:08] saying here Grace and peace
[2:12] amen because he's getting ready to
[2:15] deliver something that uh
[2:17] is a powerful thing
[2:19] we don't have to fret
[2:22] a worry but we should be consistent
[2:26] according as his divine power have given
[2:29] unto us all things
[2:32] that pertain unto life and godliness
[2:35] through the knowledge of him that have
[2:37] called us to glory and virtue
[2:41] now I want you to see where Peter's
[2:44] coming he says according as his divine
[2:46] power his divine power have given unto
[2:51] us all things that pertain unto life and
[2:55] godliness through the knowledge of him
[2:58] that have called us to his to glory and
[3:01] virtue now if you could just hold that
[3:04] right there and flip to the 11th verse
[3:08] of the same chapter
[3:10] for so an entrance shall be ministered
[3:14] unto you abundantly
[3:17] on into the Everlasting Kingdom of our
[3:20] Lord and Savior Jesus Christ
[3:23] and I want you to know that this 11th
[3:25] verse could not be fulfilled
[3:28] completely until all day
[3:30] we need a Malachi for five we need an
[3:35] Elijah and I bring that out in the
[3:37] message how that Elijah brother Branham
[3:41] of our day
[3:43] was given that Ministry of entrance
[3:47] where we would know how to enter because
[3:50] remember a man that uh Matthew 25 uh we
[3:56] realized we had five wives and five
[3:58] foolish but the five went in the Bible
[4:01] never told us other how they got there
[4:04] other than that they had oil and extra
[4:08] okay oil and extra oil amen that's what
[4:13] makes the difference between us and
[4:16] denominationals is because God in this
[4:18] last day gave us extra oil
[4:22] all right let's go back amen whereby are
[4:25] given unto us exceeding great and
[4:29] precious promises that by these you
[4:32] might be partaker of the divine nature
[4:37] have an escape
[4:38] having escaped the corruption that is in
[4:42] the world through lust
[4:45] so by having the divine nature of being
[4:48] partakers of it that means God give each
[4:50] and every one of us apart
[4:52] amen and by having this we escape
[4:57] uh the corruption that is in the world
[5:00] through lust and understand he just uses
[5:03] plural lust because his lust is the
[5:05] flesh loves to the eye and pride of life
[5:10] and beside this giving all diligence to
[5:13] your faith virtue into virtue knowledge
[5:15] into knowledge Temperance into
[5:17] Temperance patience and to patience
[5:19] godliness and to Godliness brotherly
[5:21] kindness and to brotherly kindness
[5:23] charities
[5:25] for if these things be in you and abound
[5:27] they make you that you shall neither be
[5:30] Barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge
[5:32] of our Lord Jesus Christ
[5:34] but he that likes these things is blind
[5:37] and cannot see a far off and have
[5:39] forgotten that he was purged from his
[5:42] sins wherefore the rather Brethren give
[5:45] diligent to make your calling and
[5:46] elections sure
[5:48] for if you do these things you shall
[5:51] never fall
[5:53] foresaw an entrance shall be ministered
[5:56] I love that unto you abundantly into the
[6:00] Everlasting Kingdom of our Lord and
[6:02] Savior Jesus Christ
[6:05] now let us pray Heavenly Father God we
[6:08] come before you Lord as humbly as we
[6:10] know how we thank you for your Mighty
[6:12] grace and mercy and love that you have
[6:15] bestowed upon us father we come here to
[6:18] lift you up and to glorify your Holy
[6:21] Name there are no words to express our
[6:24] gratitude for the love divine that have
[6:27] been ministered unto us through your
[6:29] servant Elijah and father we thank you
[6:32] right now for the words of life in Jesus
[6:35] Christ's name we pray amen you may be
[6:38] seated
[6:40] I like to entitle this message
[6:44] uh
[6:45] complete in him
[6:49] completion is my theme
[6:53] wherein we realize by the grace of God
[6:57] that
[6:59] they cannot be perfect without us
[7:02] you know that really struck me in my
[7:05] studying and I really believe that it is
[7:08] just the season
[7:09] that we're living in we have heard and I
[7:13] want you to go home by the grace of God
[7:15] at some point in time and listen to
[7:17] Statue of a perfect man listen carefully
[7:21] amen because I really believe that
[7:22] that's the season that we're living in
[7:25] everything else is gathering and I
[7:27] believe that the Bride of Jesus Christ
[7:29] is gathering too
[7:31] you see uh the the denominational
[7:34] churches cannot produce a people for a
[7:38] rapture uh because the Rapture amen will
[7:42] consist of people who are without spot
[7:45] wrinkle and blemish I often wondered
[7:49] what that really was amen and how was
[7:52] that going to be possible for those of
[7:55] us who were born sinful and of sinful
[7:58] flesh but in Peter Peter is basically
[8:02] telling us that in this last day that
[8:04] God will fill you amen completely with
[8:08] his divine nature because he is the only
[8:11] one who was without spot wrinkle or
[8:14] blemish amen that is the only way that
[8:17] we can make a Rapture it doesn't mean
[8:21] that we uh won't be saved because the
[8:24] five foolish was saved they were
[8:26] complete as the five wise were complete
[8:31] now I want you to know something that
[8:34] God has shown me tonight amen according
[8:36] to James 1 and 4.
[8:39] it says but let patience have her
[8:42] perfect work that you may be perfect and
[8:46] entire
[8:47] wanting nothing
[8:50] amen so we understand calling and crying
[8:53] out for these Virtues Of Christ doesn't
[8:56] mean that they're going to come
[8:58] instantaneously
[9:01] but we understand as our brother Branham
[9:03] have said that every virtue is a victory
[9:08] there is a conquering of self self pride
[9:13] self uh uh Ambitions self everything
[9:17] that comes with self it is a conquering
[9:19] of self is that right amen and so we
[9:23] realize by the grace of God Amen that we
[9:26] are living in oh my the most exciting
[9:28] age of of all times we realize amen that
[9:32] God has done a mighty work
[9:34] Amen in our day and you know as the
[9:37] prophet of God said on that message he
[9:40] said you ought to seek these virtues
[9:42] every day
[9:45] every day until you are completely
[9:49] filled or satisfied or you can see it
[9:53] amen living its way through you it will
[9:57] not be something a man that you will
[9:59] mistaken
[10:01] it will be the literal life of Christ
[10:04] Living in you now I'm going to throw
[10:08] some things out because he said listen
[10:09] before these things can be added to you
[10:13] you must first be born again now I know
[10:16] what people say uh but they you know
[10:20] that I've had a many uh ways I've heard
[10:23] people say it but you know I asked the
[10:25] Lord and I says God I said now if I
[10:29] wanted to know exactly what to do uh in
[10:33] order to make a Rapture seeing that you
[10:35] have a ordained brother Branham uh to uh
[10:38] Minister this to us I said to myself you
[10:42] know what if I've got one tape what what
[10:45] if just one book or one tape is given to
[10:48] me which tape would it be
[10:50] and the Lord showed me the Statue of a
[10:53] perfect man
[10:54] uh and when I said that I asked that
[10:57] today I've heard it I've had Witnesses
[11:00] amen but personally I needed to know
[11:03] because I realize amen there's so much
[11:06] in there that personally I had myself
[11:09] missed
[11:11] salvation in itself come by way of
[11:15] election
[11:16] this is not something that you and I can
[11:19] manufacture it is not something that you
[11:22] can put on like brother Branham said you
[11:25] know a black bird trying to put in
[11:27] peacock feathers it is beyond any human
[11:30] effort that this thing is actually done
[11:33] so I want to just have to take my time
[11:36] tonight and like I said this is almost
[11:38] this is somewhat like the foundation I
[11:40] tried to uh by the grace of God really a
[11:43] minister Sunday morning and evening uh
[11:45] just to get it all cleared out but I'm
[11:48] so glad that you all who are here can
[11:50] hear about the grace of God what the
[11:52] Lord has in store for us in Isaiah 66
[11:56] and 1 it said thus said the Lord the
[12:00] heaven is my throne and the Earth is my
[12:04] footstool where is the house that you
[12:08] build unto me and where is the place of
[12:13] my rest
[12:14] for all those things have mine handmade
[12:18] and all those things
[12:21] have been said the Lord
[12:23] but to this man will I look even to him
[12:27] that is poor and of a contrite spirit
[12:30] and tremble it at my word
[12:34] first of all a man you there there's a
[12:37] condition I believe that the Holy Spirit
[12:40] has to get each and every one of us into
[12:43] and that condition is a poor and
[12:46] contrite spirit and one who can truly
[12:51] tremble or fear the word of the Lord
[12:55] now if you would just turn with me by
[12:57] the grace of God to James 4 2 you say
[13:00] well Lord maybe you would say well God
[13:03] I've been praying and you know I'm not
[13:06] there yet well it all depends on what
[13:09] you're praying for we're not here
[13:11] praying to be greater than one or the
[13:14] other
[13:14] uh but we're we're we're we're praying
[13:17] that God's word will be made manifest in
[13:20] US
[13:21] see we're not in the seventh age but
[13:25] this message brings us into what brother
[13:27] Branham called The Eternal age you can
[13:31] say the eighth age however you want to
[13:33] say it but brother Branham basically
[13:35] said it is an eternal age right amen so
[13:41] this age that we have been birthed into
[13:43] is eternal amen amen so anyway let's go
[13:48] on to James 4 2. it says let us start at
[13:53] the first verse for which come Wars and
[13:56] findings among you
[13:58] come they not his even of your lust that
[14:01] you warn your members
[14:03] ye lust and you have not you killed and
[14:07] desire to have
[14:08] and cannot obtain you fight in war and
[14:13] yet you have not because you ask not
[14:18] so our condition that we're now standing
[14:22] in is not because God's word has failed
[14:26] us
[14:27] but our motive and our objectives in
[14:29] life have been the cause of our
[14:32] condition
[14:33] now if you really want God the Bible
[14:35] said that if we ask in faith God would
[14:39] give it to you liberally and he will not
[14:43] upgrade right in other words God is
[14:46] waiting on us
[14:48] to ask
[14:49] amen not only to ask but to receive amen
[14:53] see because we have been so guilty in
[14:55] the past of listening to The Prophet's
[14:57] message and walking away and just saying
[15:00] is good
[15:01] but the prophet of God also preached the
[15:03] message hearing
[15:06] receiving
[15:07] and acting
[15:09] so how in the world we're going to act
[15:12] on what God would have us to bring forth
[15:15] now you and I realized by the grace of
[15:18] God
[15:19] that you must first have the seed
[15:23] because without the seed
[15:26] it cannot be a production of Christ it
[15:30] won't work it's like
[15:32] going to the soil of a place
[15:35] expecting an apple tree when the seed
[15:38] was never planted so the seed has to be
[15:41] planted in you and that seed must have
[15:44] had been planted amen before the
[15:47] foundation of the world
[15:49] now it's the seed in you because I want
[15:51] you to understand it's the seed in you
[15:54] and brother Branham goes along in the
[15:55] second coming
[15:56] he says
[15:58] and I'll give you an Akon
[16:02] and you have an econ tree potentially
[16:08] but it's in the seed form
[16:11] you cannot say you have actually got a
[16:15] tree
[16:16] and to the seed has produced a tree
[16:21] hello somebody
[16:23] so how you understand the Tree of Life
[16:26] must be produced in you
[16:29] it can't just remain in seed form
[16:32] right now once the life is quickened in
[16:36] you that means that seed has now began
[16:41] to grow
[16:43] brother random said in that sea we have
[16:45] everything everything to make a rapture
[16:51] see so God didn't even leave it in your
[16:54] hands he placed it in the sea
[16:58] but if the seed is in there
[17:01] it will cause you to act
[17:05] and behave in a certain way
[17:09] right
[17:11] so I want to say by the grace of God
[17:13] that listen because you're thirsting for
[17:17] more righteousness that is such a great
[17:20] thing
[17:21] but you don't just thirst without
[17:24] seeking for the water
[17:27] right you don't just stars for
[17:29] righteousness and said I'm thirsty and
[17:32] you're not seeking for more of it
[17:35] right because here Amen in the message
[17:38] time of a decision he said the word of
[17:41] God is a seed and a seed is planted in
[17:45] the ground and if that seed is watered
[17:48] it's spring forth into life if it's a
[17:52] germanized seed
[17:54] Jesus said the word was a seed then if
[17:57] the seed was falling into your heart and
[18:00] you watered that seed by faith believing
[18:03] it'll bring forth just after its kind
[18:07] or you can put it on record and after 30
[18:10] years of preaching I can say this that I
[18:13] have never one time sincerely ever asked
[18:16] God for anything and committed it to him
[18:19] he either give it to me or he told me
[18:22] why he couldn't do it and if you take
[18:26] the right mental attitude toward any
[18:28] Divine promise God has made it'll bring
[18:32] it to pass
[18:34] so if you look at Peter and add to your
[18:37] faith virtue knowledge all if you take
[18:39] the right mental attitude behind it amen
[18:43] here he says God will bring it to pass
[18:47] if you just simply say it's God's word
[18:51] it's not for me to try to figure it out
[18:53] that's God's business he spoke it that's
[18:57] all's necessary
[18:59] something will take place
[19:01] if there has been any to the glory of
[19:05] honor of God I have no education to be a
[19:08] preacher and God knows I'm not a Healer
[19:11] so he's basically saying I've done
[19:14] nothing other than take God at his word
[19:17] and because there's a seed in it it was
[19:19] quick and it was dramatized
[19:21] and it brought forth oh my God
[19:27] oh let me read another one tokun
[19:29] and when anything sealed inside of a
[19:32] seal
[19:33] you better not break it can't break it
[19:36] you not God's seal no for you uh you
[19:41] grieve not the holy spirit of God
[19:44] whereby you are sealed into the day of
[19:46] your Redemption
[19:47] and when the body's raised up it's a
[19:51] seed a sign that's the seed has been
[19:54] germanized with eternal life Zoe my own
[19:59] life and I raise it up at the last day
[20:02] and as you walk you have confidence that
[20:06] the Life of Christ is in you
[20:09] and you are in him by one Spirit we're
[20:12] baptized into one body and shield there
[20:16] by the Holy Ghost among disbelievers
[20:19] like this until the day that Jesus
[20:22] raises us up apply the token that what
[20:25] is mean to us we expect the sacrifice to
[20:29] give us life and it does
[20:32] then it gives us a token and we apply
[20:36] the token which is sealed see being
[20:39] partakers of this seal remember the
[20:42] scripture said we first believed we
[20:45] receive the Holy Ghost and then was
[20:47] sealed so you got to understand this is
[20:50] a process and a tree doesn't grow
[20:53] overnight
[20:56] but you've got to realize that those who
[20:59] make a Rapture in this day will be those
[21:03] who are mature
[21:05] who are crowned with Divine love
[21:12] don't get nervous because if you
[21:13] ordained to it nothing can make you I
[21:15] can't keep you from it
[21:17] right come on somebody
[21:19] now listen
[21:21] he this is what brother random said he
[21:24] says listen
[21:27] I have obtained this faith
[21:29] and I'm addressing this to them that has
[21:33] obtained the like Precious faith
[21:37] is not to the outside world this is to
[21:40] the church those that are in Christ
[21:44] and explaining Peter he said Grace and
[21:47] peace be multiplied unto you through the
[21:49] knowledge of God and through of Jesus
[21:53] Christ Our Lord according as his divine
[21:55] power has given unto us all things his
[21:59] divine power now has given unto us
[22:04] all things now watch this because every
[22:08] Church age had a virtue
[22:11] but in this age all things
[22:16] all of the virtues
[22:18] have been given to the Bride of Jesus
[22:21] Christ oh come on somebody
[22:23] it was only in this age all things
[22:26] pertaining to Jesus Christ could be
[22:29] given
[22:32] this is the only age
[22:33] and so therefore we needed an Elijah we
[22:37] needed a Ministry that could show us how
[22:39] to obtain these things that Peter is
[22:43] talking about
[22:45] right because most churches said if you
[22:47] just believe
[22:49] you know they say well you know you
[22:50] don't have to do all of that
[22:52] you know you saved by grace
[22:55] you know in some ways they're right but
[22:57] let me tell you something if you don't
[22:58] follow the message of your hour you're
[23:01] going to be left behind
[23:03] and when I say follow I don't mean
[23:06] mentally I mean step by step by step
[23:10] remember I said the other night amen it
[23:13] is the Shepherd that leads it is the
[23:16] sheep that follow right nothing gets
[23:19] ahead of the shepherd except the goat
[23:22] right
[23:23] come on everything else Lee the shepherd
[23:28] the Sheep the shepherd the Sheep I read
[23:32] that to you last week
[23:34] and so you and I must understand that
[23:36] God has an order
[23:39] right uh come on somebody yeah I that
[23:42] I'm glad you're keeping it low because I
[23:43] don't want to preach I want to teach
[23:44] just like this here whereby we are given
[23:47] unto given unto us a seemingly great and
[23:50] precious promises that by these
[23:52] we might be partakers of the divine
[23:55] nature now let that salt real deep now
[23:58] preaching this we're just teaching this
[24:00] lesson divine nature right we are giving
[24:03] unto us a seemingly great and precious
[24:05] promises that by these we might be
[24:08] partakers of his divine nature
[24:12] now I want to say this by the grace of
[24:15] God because we've had seven Church ages
[24:19] seven angels Seven Virtues and seven is
[24:23] completion
[24:24] and the word of God said we are complete
[24:27] in him
[24:30] right so the very things that so you
[24:34] can't say these virtues cannot be
[24:37] obtained
[24:38] you've got ages that have already done
[24:41] it
[24:43] those who made up the bride in each age
[24:46] obtain that virtue that's why I hear a
[24:51] Paul tells us they cannot be complete in
[24:54] Hebrew they cannot be complete because
[24:57] we are the ones that actually the
[24:59] literal Capstone comes down on WE
[25:02] display Divine love which seals in all
[25:06] the other Church Ages come on somebody
[25:08] amen and when we seal see they can't we
[25:11] say well Lord let the Rapture come they
[25:12] can they can't get up they cannot even
[25:16] come back until you and I are displaying
[25:21] Divine love
[25:25] you and I we're the holdup
[25:28] and you know why because we're not
[25:31] seeking him
[25:32] every day that thing hit me and struck
[25:36] me so hard Lord help me to seek you
[25:39] every day
[25:41] add to me Lord
[25:43] see because the Bible said can any man
[25:46] add a cubit to a statue
[25:51] you know if we could do that we'd go Zoo
[25:54] we'll finish it off
[25:56] but you see
[25:58] the greatest victories are the of the
[26:01] greater the battle the suite of the
[26:03] victory
[26:04] and God put us in this place to be tried
[26:07] and tested remember I told you amen when
[26:09] tried in the fire
[26:11] you've been invited the Bible said if
[26:13] come on go
[26:14] be tried in the fire and you say yes
[26:17] Lord
[26:19] so you answered that call because you
[26:22] recognized you were gold
[26:25] only the gold could recognize it right
[26:27] only the gold could respond to the
[26:30] invitation
[26:32] oh come on somebody that that makes me
[26:35] feel good he meant to know that I'm gold
[26:39] and I've come this way so the fire can
[26:43] prove that I'm gold
[26:46] all the tests go come the trial is going
[26:49] to come that's all right it's for
[26:51] ordained it's predestinating if Ephesus
[26:54] made it I can make it if Smyrna made it
[26:57] I can make it all the way down if if
[27:00] Philadelphia made it I can make it come
[27:02] on somebody why because they could not
[27:05] have made it either without Grace
[27:07] and peace
[27:11] um
[27:13] every Christian he says I'm an old
[27:15] veteran he said look at brother and
[27:17] sister kid here they're probably oldest
[27:20] in the building but if I ask them what
[27:22] is your harsh desire they'd say it it'll
[27:25] be closer to God see when you learn to
[27:29] when you learn of Christ there's
[27:31] something about him that's so loving you
[27:34] just try to get right into him
[27:37] excuse this expression I told my wife
[27:41] here not long ago
[27:42] both getting old and I said it to hers
[27:45] do you love me like you used to and she
[27:49] said I certainly do and I said you know
[27:51] I love you so much till I would like to
[27:54] take you and pull you inside of me
[27:58] so we would just be really one
[28:00] he said boy he says now multiply that
[28:04] listen
[28:05] a hundred million
[28:08] and then you'll find out how that the
[28:10] believer Who falls in love with Christ
[28:13] want to get into him because it's a love
[28:20] now I'ma tell you that's a thirst
[28:23] that's a desire that will not leave you
[28:27] until it's done
[28:29] my daughter Clara is pregnant and she
[28:33] was telling me about those cravings and
[28:35] you know she loved to exercise and she
[28:38] thought she was right now and she said
[28:40] when she got pregnant it caught her by
[28:42] uh surprise and the first thing she said
[28:45] Daddy did this
[28:48] and daddy did because I have been crying
[28:51] out to the Lord
[28:53] fix it give her a child and God did it
[28:57] hello somebody now my thing was amen
[29:02] she says daddy you know these Cravings
[29:06] she'd probably get mad at me for telling
[29:08] this she said these Cravings she says
[29:10] not only did I go by uh Chipotle and get
[29:14] me was one Sam and she said I got me two
[29:17] just in case I might want the second one
[29:19] later
[29:23] And she said Oh Daddy she said and think
[29:25] about it I had such a desire for Taco
[29:28] Bell
[29:30] now all she says I know this is wrong
[29:33] and maybe I'm expressing my fat feelings
[29:35] but what it is there's a life in there
[29:39] we're not like craves
[29:42] I asked my daughter in this sense it's
[29:44] so strong you've got to do something
[29:47] about it and she says nothing else will
[29:50] satisfy
[29:53] come on somebody that's how it is with
[29:56] God nothing else would satisfy that
[29:58] craving that's on the inside that's
[30:00] thirst to be just like him nothing
[30:02] nothing but one Soul what's so wonderful
[30:04] about my brothers the Bible said to you
[30:07] thirst and hunger for righteousness
[30:11] you shall be filled
[30:13] hey is that a promise or not that is
[30:17] truly the promises of God
[30:20] the thing about it is we must learn how
[30:23] to respect
[30:25] you know
[30:27] there's no respect to or for the things
[30:29] of God that's the problem
[30:32] you know we have hearted sacrifices
[30:34] given to the Lord
[30:36] I think about it and I was reading the
[30:38] scripture and I thought to myself Lord
[30:42] show me
[30:44] what this is all about
[30:47] Emma read it to you somehow I I missed
[30:50] what chapter I got it from uh you can
[30:52] look it up if you like if you write a
[30:53] few words down he that killeth and
[30:55] aren't
[30:57] a man
[31:00] I shall lamb as if he cut off a dog's
[31:02] neck
[31:03] he that offered oblation
[31:05] as if he offers swines blood
[31:09] he that burneth incense as if he's
[31:12] blessed and Idol yay they have chosen
[31:14] their own ways and their soul delighted
[31:17] in their Abominations
[31:19] I also would choose their delusions it
[31:23] would bring their fears upon them
[31:24] because when I call none did answer when
[31:28] I spake they did not hear but they did
[31:31] even before mine eyes and chose that in
[31:34] which I Delight not
[31:36] hear with the word of the Lord
[31:38] hear the word of the Lord ye that
[31:41] tremble at his word your brethren that
[31:43] hated you that cast you out for my
[31:47] name's sake said let the Lord be
[31:49] glorified but he shall appear to your
[31:52] joy and they shall be ashamed
[31:55] a voice of noise from the city a voice
[31:58] from the temple a voice of the Lord that
[32:02] rendereth recompense to his enemy and
[32:05] the Bible tells us by the grace of God
[32:07] listen what is it oftentimes we come in
[32:10] church we give him halfway praises
[32:13] oh come on somebody it's true we we
[32:16] offer up something that you know is
[32:18] equivalent to slaying a man or you know
[32:21] bringing in a dog or you know what I
[32:23] mean something that and that's the way
[32:25] he looks at it when there is no joy in
[32:28] it there's no uh you know excitement or
[32:32] you know uh uh uh uh uh being thankful
[32:35] or grateful this is the way God looks at
[32:38] it and really when you're in that
[32:40] condition condition you're not serving
[32:43] God
[32:45] you're serving yourself
[32:53] listen
[32:54] coming from a quote that the statue I
[32:56] got get the birth into you and it will
[32:58] add itself
[32:59] see think it's some kind of a hoax
[33:02] there's something fixed up between them
[33:05] they can't understand it until that man
[33:09] is born again
[33:10] then when he's born again then he's in
[33:14] line of Fellowship because he's a new
[33:17] creature creation that old suspicious
[33:20] doubting character he was is dead now
[33:24] he's a new creation so you see he don't
[33:27] have to add anything to his his now
[33:30] because it's automatically be added
[33:33] notice you must be born again and when
[33:37] you're born again you can't be born
[33:39] again without having faith that's right
[33:42] so you see on my chart here I got the
[33:46] very Foundation faith is the foundation
[33:48] of it all for without faith it's
[33:50] impossible to please God he that coming
[33:53] to God must believe that he is and
[33:55] reward of those that diligently seek him
[33:57] wait a minute he's a rewarder of those
[34:00] that diligence seek him now if
[34:04] Jacob had to wrestle with the angel to
[34:07] change his walk what do you think you
[34:09] got to do
[34:13] amen
[34:14] what do you think you got to do somebody
[34:17] said well can I lose
[34:20] my salvation
[34:22] no if it was real the first time you can
[34:27] but that's the thing you got to make
[34:29] sure it's real
[34:33] come on somebody see he must be and when
[34:37] you are skeptic of the Bible when you're
[34:40] skeptic of the word being right you just
[34:43] might as well stay back until first you
[34:46] believe it
[34:49] who listen you got to look at Peter and
[34:52] you got to say Lord this is me
[34:55] this is mine and I keep praying and
[34:58] praying and praying and praying till I
[35:01] see these things added to me because you
[35:04] got to understand it's the Holy Ghost
[35:07] that puts his approval
[35:10] because every time we think we got
[35:12] something we make a mess
[35:15] and I'm gonna say it like this that's
[35:16] way down down the road on my notes but a
[35:19] chain is only strong at his weakest link
[35:22] wherever you weak at that's where Satan
[35:25] breaks it and you know what it's like a
[35:27] domino effect
[35:30] y'all ever seen breeze on the string and
[35:32] break and go
[35:34] everything all those bees that's been
[35:36] added on that string break and Scatter
[35:38] why because at that point of weakness
[35:42] it destroyed the whole thing and that's
[35:45] why often time you feel like you're not
[35:47] a Christian because at that weak link is
[35:49] where Satan keeps getting you
[35:53] and he scatters everything else and
[35:55] guess what you got to start adding the
[35:56] bees all up again
[36:02] that's it and you see by the grace of
[36:05] God that's all right just don't ever
[36:06] give up
[36:07] you don't give up you keep adding adding
[36:11] adding adding adding and how do you add
[36:14] by faith and prayer
[36:17] right cause you can't do it
[36:20] the Bible said what have what house what
[36:23] house can you build me he said listen no
[36:26] no house he said the heavens is my it's
[36:28] my throne and Earth is my footstool he
[36:31] said but you have prepared prepared a
[36:32] body so God has prepared you
[36:39] how is he going to prepare you first of
[36:41] all he's got to bring the fire
[36:43] if we're going to abide behind in
[36:46] between the cherubins you got to have
[36:47] all this worldly stuff out of you
[36:50] but God is able if you pray
[36:53] amen right I'll never forget a brother
[36:55] Bible said those foolish version ass you
[36:57] know uh uh the wise give me of your all
[37:00] they say you go pray up
[37:02] you go pray up it's in prayer that's why
[37:06] Satan robs us
[37:08] that's where he robs him because he
[37:11] knows that the weakest Saint if they
[37:13] fall on their knees amen they can whip
[37:15] the devil
[37:16] that's the word
[37:18] any time any place
[37:21] any condition
[37:22] anywhere so down on your knees is where
[37:25] you get your victory
[37:28] amen nobody don't have to tell you where
[37:30] you're coming short all of us know
[37:32] as individuals we know where we're
[37:34] coming short what you're going to do
[37:35] about it
[37:37] when you realize the saints of God the
[37:39] Bible said we are encompassed about
[37:41] we're so great a cloud of witness
[37:43] they're cheering and says come on boy
[37:48] yeah you can do better come on they're
[37:51] cheering us on
[37:53] looking at us and says we can't move
[37:56] until you move
[37:59] God chose you to be the cream of the
[38:01] cream of the crowd come on somebody
[38:03] that's why the devil fights us we're in
[38:06] the worst age there ever was but God is
[38:08] using the greatest weapon he have a kid
[38:10] and that's the word that's why the word
[38:12] had to be restored
[38:14] had to be until you come and you and I
[38:17] come listen you can't even go up to up
[38:19] the scale without having faith in the
[38:21] word Now understand listen brother I'm
[38:24] saying now he says listen he goes and
[38:26] talks about he did not come to build an
[38:28] organization Christ never sent me to
[38:30] build an organization Christ me to
[38:33] build individuals to the statue of Jesus
[38:35] Christ that might be the powerhouse
[38:38] now I I've read you that the 11th verse
[38:41] the entrance he says listen I was
[38:43] ordained to fulfill that scripture
[38:47] who I was ordained to feel that
[38:49] scripture dwelling listen he said Jesus
[38:52] Christ that he might be the PowerHouse
[38:54] Dwelling Place of His Holy Spirit by his
[38:57] word uh-huh by his word built of an
[39:01] individual to that place not build an
[39:03] organization a great denomination but
[39:06] build the individual to Sons and
[39:08] Daughters of God he says that's the idea
[39:11] see add to your faith virtue to your
[39:14] virtue now add knowledge well now come
[39:17] on to a place now when they began to say
[39:19] well we don't have to accept that today
[39:22] you do have to it must be the scriptures
[39:26] cannot lie there are no private
[39:29] interpretation the Bible said you just
[39:31] believe it the way it is written there
[39:33] see you've got to have these things and
[39:36] the only way you'll ever be able to have
[39:39] them is to have heaven-born knowledge
[39:42] here it is see that's why he says I was
[39:45] out there in the woods he said and I
[39:47] waited for God to give me this
[39:52] see it was Heaven bone he said I
[39:55] couldn't preach that I I couldn't that
[39:57] ain't me God had to put the scriptures
[40:00] together and now I've got those
[40:02] heaven-born knowledge and I'm giving it
[40:03] to you here is the entrance you want to
[40:06] make a Rapture here it is
[40:16] there are no private interpretation
[40:18] anyway there's no private interpretation
[40:19] the Bible said you and us believe it the
[40:22] way it is written here see
[40:24] heaven-bone knowledge heaven-born
[40:26] knowledge will vindicate the word
[40:29] see you've got to believe now not make
[40:33] believe none of these are make beliefs
[40:35] see if you try to say uh don't be a
[40:38] blackbird putting pecan peacock feathers
[40:41] in yourself because they'll fall right
[40:43] out
[40:44] they're not naturally grown in there so
[40:48] you must understand the supernatural God
[40:51] must be supernaturally grown if I could
[40:54] put it that way it must supernaturally
[40:57] allow itself to be expressed because she
[41:00] says now listen you've got to understand
[41:03] that even uh uh uh uh uh Christian
[41:06] Science can show all of these things
[41:09] almost
[41:10] all of these kind of Virtues and things
[41:12] like that but you see they can't come
[41:14] all the way up
[41:16] they always will have a weak link
[41:19] why and it's put on
[41:23] Mind Over Matter
[41:24] but I tell you slap a man hard enough I
[41:27] tell you what he'll forget his Christian
[41:28] Science
[41:34] he will he'll forget his Christian
[41:36] Science but if it's God
[41:40] he'll turn the other chief come on
[41:42] somebody that's the kind we want we
[41:45] don't want the the kind we practice we
[41:47] want the kind that lives like brother
[41:49] Brandon said there's got to be seven
[41:51] live voices
[41:54] oh I love this
[41:56] the Bible says don't you worry about it
[41:59] talk about Israel now
[42:01] seventh verse here it says before she
[42:04] travails she brought forth but for her
[42:07] pain came she was delivered of a
[42:08] man-child
[42:10] who have heard such a thing who have
[42:12] seen such a things shall the Earth be
[42:15] made to bring forth in one day or shall
[42:17] a nation be born at once for as for as
[42:21] soon as Zion travaileth she brought
[42:23] forth her child
[42:27] how come on somebody
[42:32] oh
[42:34] so it's like this
[42:39] ah

[42:42] is
[42:45] huh y'all know what travailing is
[42:51] it's going to take something
[42:53] but soon as you prevent it ain't going
[42:56] to take that long but you got to get to
[42:58] the place that you wanted so much till
[43:00] you travail for it
[43:03] shall I bring to the birth and not cause
[43:05] to bring forth so if God put a desire in
[43:08] you to come to this and then cause you
[43:11] not to have it no no no no
[43:15] no I know he's talking about a nation
[43:16] but he's talking about us too in just a
[43:18] moment you'll see
[43:20] listen he says cause cause you to bring
[43:22] forth says the Lord shall I cause to
[43:24] bring forth and shut the wound

[43:29] Jerusalem and be glad with her all you
[43:32] that love her Rejoice for Joy with her
[43:35] all you that moan for her that ye may
[43:38] suck and be satisfied with the breast of
[43:40] her consolations that you may milk out
[43:43] and be delighted with the abundance of
[43:45] her glory y'all know what milk out is
[43:48] have you all ever seen a baby amen when
[43:50] that baby milk out all he's look like
[43:52] he's seeing angels and stars and
[43:53] everything I mean his eyes are just
[43:55] battening he's smiling from ear to ear

[44:00] that's the way it is supposed to be a
[44:02] Christian come on somebody amen you and
[44:05] I supposed to milk out on the words
[44:07] Hallelujah for thus said the Lord behold
[44:09] I will extend peace to her like a river
[44:14] and the glory of the Gentiles like a
[44:16] flooring stream then shall she suck she
[44:19] shall be born upon her side and be
[44:21] dangled upon her knees and as one whose
[44:24] mother confident so will I comfort you
[44:27] and ye shall be comforted in Jerusalem
[44:29] and who is Jerusalem
[44:31] the Bride of Jesus Christ she is the
[44:34] Jerusalem is that right come on somebody
[44:37] listen Psalms 127 1 says accept the Lord
[44:42] build the house they labor in Lane that
[44:46] build it except the Lord keep the city
[44:49] The Watchmen Wicked but in vain
[44:53] hello it is God who's keeping God who's
[44:56] God
[44:59] who's building the house he's still a
[45:02] carpenter son
[45:04] come on somebody and he still he laid
[45:07] the foundation amen zeruba said that
[45:10] same stone that was rejected God had
[45:12] made the head of the corner
[45:19] now the Lord
[45:23] belonging and shaping
[45:27] the heart
[45:30] why at of all times and all day when the
[45:34] prophet of God was on the scene
[45:36] he brought out the scripture
[45:38] as a man thinketh in his heart so is he
[45:42] he said theologians
[45:45] scientists and all thought that
[45:47] scripture was wrong
[45:48] because they say man thinketh in his
[45:51] head
[45:51] he said but science has discovered that
[45:55] in the heart of a man is a small little
[45:58] place about the size of a pinhead that
[46:01] has no blood vessels
[46:03] and he says that's where God abides
[46:07] see you don't need a whole lot of him
[46:09] you just need to live here hi come on
[46:12] all you need is a pinhead whatever it is
[46:15] think about it
[46:16] that little computer chip controls
[46:18] everything
[46:22] so you look at this he says listen all
[46:24] you need is that and let that be a pure
[46:28] seed if that seed is pure it'll bring
[46:32] forth pure God
[46:34] hello
[46:35] now God is powerful because he said a
[46:38] mustard seed and he likened himself as a
[46:39] mustard seed
[46:42] amen
[46:44] and he said that Mustard Seed is pure
[46:46] but look at the tree it brings forth
[46:51] huh
[46:53] the Bible said that Mustard Seed grows
[46:55] up to be one of the largest trees there
[46:56] is and every fowl of the air come in
[46:59] large in it
[47:02] come on somebody because I'm gonna tell
[47:04] you something about the Seal of the Holy
[47:05] Ghost amen that seal is recognized
[47:08] coming and going
[47:10] now let me get here just a minute give
[47:12] me a few minutes I'm not going to keep
[47:13] you long because I want you to really
[47:14] hold to what I said tonight
[47:16] like I said this is the foundation of
[47:18] what I want to finish ministering on
[47:20] Sunday if the Lord tariff not I'll keep
[47:22] going until then
[47:24] now first of all we understand you got
[47:28] to recognize it
[47:31] and you got to understand amen that
[47:33] you can't remain where you are none of
[47:37] us can remain where we are the whole
[47:40] point about this message is for you to
[47:43] examine yourself to see whether you be
[47:45] in the faith if you are in the faith
[47:48] then you ought to realize and recognize
[47:50] Lord or ask God where am I wait usually
[47:53] you don't have to ask you that you
[47:55] wouldn't have to ask him that because
[47:57] all of us know
[48:00] if you're still getting hot tempered
[48:02] that means you ain't you you'll be low
[48:04] temperance
[48:07] that means right
[48:10] you're below temperance
[48:12] if you still getting upset and carrying
[48:14] on like you yeah you still you're below
[48:16] tempers but that's okay maybe you got
[48:18] knowledge
[48:20] because I'm gonna show you by the grace
[48:21] of God
[48:22] wherever the weak link is is that where
[48:25] you that's where you're breaking
[48:27] before you can get Perfection you got to
[48:29] conquer that
[48:32] ooh Faith nah let me put it this way
[48:36] folks let me let me say like this how
[48:38] many look through the Old Testament was
[48:40] it Gideon who won the war or was it God
[48:42] who won the world forget him did David
[48:45] win the wars or was The God Who won the
[48:47] wars for David did Joshua win the walls
[48:50] no or was it God that won the war for
[48:52] Joshua see it was a promise and all
[48:56] Joshua David and Gideon had to do is
[48:58] believe what God Said and God made him a
[49:01] winner and all you got to do is believe
[49:04] what God Said and God will make you a
[49:06] winner
[49:08] Paul said we're more than conquered
[49:11] through Christ Jesus our lord thank God
[49:13] who gives us the victory
[49:16] so
[49:18] we have not because we asked not
[49:22] faith is a foundation
[49:24] right Peter stars are with faith
[49:27] right because you can't even start the
[49:31] building until the foundation is laid
[49:34] and the foundation is you must be born
[49:37] again
[49:38] right ain't no reason you're starting
[49:40] you must be born again
[49:43] of the water and of the spirit right
[49:45] come on somebody now we're not life you
[49:48] said well brother when does it really
[49:49] take place understand when that life
[49:51] comes in you because the word of God
[49:53] can't lie the life comes in you when you
[49:56] says Lord Jesus I accept you as my
[49:58] personal savior
[50:00] Jesus said at that time you have passed
[50:02] from Death unto life
[50:04] at that time you have passed from Death
[50:07] of the life you still as dirty as filthy
[50:09] as you've ever been
[50:10] but in there is a life that's going to
[50:13] change you if you feed it
[50:16] that's your that's your foundation you
[50:19] see a lot of people die at that point
[50:21] because they won't continue to feed it
[50:24] right but you see if you are absolutely
[50:27] elected God says ooh this is what I was
[50:31] telling somebody the other day I said I
[50:33] don't care nothing about no Greek in
[50:35] Hebrew
[50:37] that ain't what gives me life
[50:40] the Bible said the Holy Ghost
[50:42] will lead you and guide you into all
[50:45] truth not the dictionary or the
[50:47] commentary or the whatever area is just
[50:50] Jesus
[50:52] the Holy Ghost I I come on if I can't
[50:56] read or write I'll steal more no more
[50:58] than the theologians everyone that have
[51:01] gotten their doctorate degree amen why
[51:04] because I got the Holy Ghost and they
[51:06] don't
[51:11] no sir the Bible said the Holy Ghost
[51:14] will lead when somebody come with your
[51:16] Greek stop them right there because they
[51:18] confused about this Holy Ghost
[51:20] they don't know nothing about it why
[51:22] because you gotta in order to understand
[51:24] the scriptures you got to be born let me
[51:27] say it like this who understand God but
[51:29] God
[51:32] and an eagle understand an eagle because
[51:34] it's got the same life and you'll
[51:36] understand God because you got the same
[51:38] life
[51:42] Faith so you got to be born again you
[51:45] got to have God on the inside right
[51:47] that's where your foundation starts
[51:50] right it's way before baptism
[51:54] baptism is just the outward show that
[51:56] you've accepted the Lord Jesus Christ
[51:58] in your heart yet it's still necessary
[52:02] just as necessary
[52:04] as
[52:06] commune
[52:08] is that right so you can't even go any
[52:10] further if you don't have the baptism
[52:12] you're right there at Faith
[52:15] that's as far as your house has been
[52:16] built
[52:19] virtue and I think there's a lot to it
[52:21] and I'm gonna hit this back and forth
[52:23] back and forth virtue is strength and
[52:26] power
[52:27] must be able to give it out you must
[52:30] have it before you can give it out
[52:33] right because remember the woman amen
[52:35] who touched Jesus Jesus turned and said
[52:37] who touched me said virtue has gone out
[52:40] of me brother when he was here he had
[52:43] virtue because the Bible they tell us
[52:45] amen there were many times he almost
[52:47] couldn't even make it to his seat
[52:48] because he was so weak
[52:51] virtue is the power of God it's the
[52:54] strength of God even scientists have
[52:57] said that when people lay hands on the
[53:01] sick they have seen the light of God
[53:03] leave them and go to another person
[53:06] scientists know it's true
[53:09] hello somebody and you can't have virtue
[53:12] or even know that you got it without
[53:14] having faith that you have it
[53:17] oh I feel like I got virtue no I got
[53:20] virgin because he's in there
[53:22] is his virtue not mine
[53:26] that's why the prophet God said Jesus
[53:28] never healed one person he said I can't
[53:30] do nothing except the father show me and
[53:32] neither you or neither me I no nobody
[53:35] Jesus Christ is the Healer
[53:38] right now here it is knowledge knowledge
[53:41] to judge whether it's right or wrong
[53:45] see the word is right and every man be
[53:48] alive
[53:50] the Bible don't contradict itself
[53:52] you must get rid of everything that is
[53:55] scripturally scripture that isn't
[53:58] scripturally scriptural based
[54:01] I don't care how real it seems
[54:04] right
[54:05] for instance you have women preachers
[54:08] and all of them say God visited them
[54:10] all of them say that unseen visions and
[54:13] everything else and that's why they're
[54:15] there and the Bible says according to
[54:17] the knowledge of the word they are not
[54:18] supposed to preach it right so where do
[54:21] you go with the signs the Wonders the
[54:23] visions and the experience
[54:25] remember in this last day in Elijah time
[54:29] amen 400 prophets was deceived
[54:33] Pentecostal Brethren deceived because
[54:37] they rested on experience and not the
[54:40] word
[54:46] is that okay
[54:48] help us Lord the word is the revelation
[54:51] of Jesus Christ he keeps all of his
[54:54] promises don't need education from
[54:57] theological School the Holy Ghost will
[54:59] lead and guide me into all truth I'm
[55:02] leaving it right there that's knowledge
[55:05] knowledge to know that the word is right
[55:08] and it doesn't need an interpreter
[55:10] because God is his own interpreter
[55:12] interpreter
[55:13] right temperance
[55:16] mean Holy Spirit Temperance how to
[55:20] control I know y'all tongue
[55:24] not be a Tattler
[55:26] and fly off when somebody offends you
[55:33] yay yep that's where we need it
[55:38] you haven't gone no further than that
[55:40] you steal that knowledge so you got to
[55:42] get some Temperance in order to have
[55:44] Temperance he's got to seal it in you
[55:46] there's got to be some victories some
[55:49] hot fires getting all up in your face
[55:53] right it's the truth
[55:56] thank God in Jesus face and the Bible
[55:59] said he was like a sheep dumb wouldn't
[56:01] open his mouth
[56:04] that's the life
[56:07] that got to be present in US
[56:10] not just present but revealed or a
[56:13] manifest excuse me right not a toddler
[56:16] girl let me tell you
[56:22] and
[56:26] and women too nowadays you know they
[56:28] talk just as much they do amen come on
[56:30] somebody and when someone offends you
[56:33] right when you rail upon
[56:36] when you're railed upon
[56:39] and you're rail not back
[56:42] somebody really railing on you don't say
[56:44] nothing
[56:46] if you're going to say anything bless
[56:48] them
[56:50] bless those that curse you that's
[56:53] Jesus's word
[56:54] right
[56:56] you know here it is I'm gonna tell you
[56:58] something I have been so guilty
[57:01] because sometimes God gives you secrets
[57:05] hello
[57:06] he says listen he said if you come into
[57:08] your secret closet I'll tell you things
[57:11] secretly
[57:13] means if a secret Angels voting down
[57:15] nobody
[57:18] he didn't tell everybody he told you
[57:21] and how many times you try to tell
[57:23] people secrets and they don't know
[57:25] nothing about what you're trying to tell
[57:27] them because you ain't supposed to tell
[57:28] them
[57:31] I'm guilty
[57:33] you think they're going to rejoice
[57:40] come on somebody y'all can at least say
[57:42] amen God that's the truth we all are
[57:45] guilty
[57:46] all right
[57:49] I said Secrets now
[57:51] there's a difference between praise and
[57:52] all that I'm talking about secrets
[57:54] and sometimes people don't even want to
[57:56] hear that
[57:57] but anyway let's go on y'all all right
[58:00] with that
[58:00] I come listen listen in Temperance
[58:04] we have one thing
[58:07] and that is
[58:10] when somebody call you names
[58:13] like I said the other day I had people
[58:15] calling me two days to distract and then
[58:17] I was running the other day and I was
[58:18] crossing the street and I was still
[58:20] somewhere like on the edge with the
[58:22] rocks and the man said I saw it I felt
[58:25] it coming
[58:26] get on the sidewalk
[58:30] I like
[58:33] you know what I said you move over
[58:38] see and guess what just as soon as I did
[58:40] that the Holy Ghost says wrong
[58:44] because the college for the street
[58:47] right somehow I should have made just
[58:49] kept my mouth shut and just praise God
[58:51] y'all understand what I'm saying so but
[58:54] God showed me it's a good thing when God
[58:56] show you amen where you're wrong so you
[58:59] says Lord have mercy
[59:01] forgive me Lord cleanse me
[59:04] strengthen me brother random use the
[59:06] word vulcanized because every every uh
[59:11] uh uh uh
[59:12] uh virtue seals itself to the other and
[59:17] it strengthens
[59:20] it strengthens each other
[59:24] right
[59:26] so we look at these things and and
[59:28] understand that when you got faith
[59:30] virtue and knowledge that God's word is
[59:33] amen amen amen amen nothing contradicts
[59:37] it's true
[59:39] it's going to give you temperance
[59:41] is that all right and it's going to also
[59:44] give you patience
[59:45] see because our thing when you really
[59:48] know God's word is true you learn how to
[59:50] wait
[59:55] this is where the prophet of God says
[59:56] not only just patient is but he says
[59:59] patient
[1:00:00] patience
[1:00:02] with God
[1:00:05] patience with God
[1:00:09] it ain't just winning on each other we
[1:00:11] know we got a little of that
[1:00:13] but most of our problem comes from not
[1:00:16] being patient with God
[1:00:20] genuine Faith give genuine patience
[1:00:25] and Noah listen I want you to understand
[1:00:27] every one of these virtues operate by
[1:00:29] faith
[1:00:33] every one of them will operate by faith
[1:00:36] they can't even move without it
[1:00:38] you got to First believe that God's
[1:00:40] gonna give you all this
[1:00:42] the Bible said of men who come to God
[1:00:44] first believe that he is God and that
[1:00:47] he's a rewarder but it's going to reward
[1:00:49] you for what are you going to God for
[1:00:51] the Bible said it's a throne of grace so
[1:00:54] therefore you aren't you don't you don't
[1:00:55] you don't have to worry about whether
[1:00:56] you married it or not it's already
[1:00:58] unmerited favor for you it is Grace so
[1:01:03] he gives you that opportunity to come
[1:01:05] listen you and I will really have a
[1:01:08] rough time if God had to say well why
[1:01:10] didn't you do it
[1:01:11] I gave you everything you ever needed to
[1:01:14] make it I made it as easy as I possibly
[1:01:17] could for you and why didn't you do it
[1:01:24] don't tell me it's not easy
[1:01:26] the problem is we don't want to die to
[1:01:29] ourselves this old lazy flesh don't want
[1:01:31] to buckle the knees
[1:01:34] right this old lazy flesh and I tell you
[1:01:36] what we can run to wherever we want to
[1:01:39] run won't even worry about time
[1:01:40] especially when they come to shopping
[1:01:41] and but when it comes down to prayer
[1:01:47] huh
[1:01:49] oh it's true we can fellowship with each
[1:01:51] other for hours and with Jesus is only
[1:01:53] 10-15 minutes if that much
[1:01:57] ain't no travail in there
[1:02:00] no travailing
[1:02:02] now listen and I I'm not going to worry
[1:02:04] you because I'm going to stop right here
[1:02:06] on patience because I don't want to
[1:02:07] finish all of this I want you to go home
[1:02:09] and I want you to listen if you got a
[1:02:12] way of listening to Statue of perfect
[1:02:13] man so when I come you'll be spiritually
[1:02:16] ready
[1:02:17] amen patience patience with God genuine
[1:02:21] Faith give genuine patience Noah have
[1:02:24] patience with God for what 120 years oh
[1:02:29] Lord out listen I'm gonna have to say it
[1:02:31] God give me the Holy Ghost did you
[1:02:34] repent
[1:02:35] will you baptize the name of Lord Jesus
[1:02:37] Christ
[1:02:38] then wait on it
[1:02:40] they had to wait and you do too maybe
[1:02:42] your weight is a little longer but he
[1:02:45] promised it see so the devil came
[1:02:47] through me now I ain't gonna get it yes
[1:02:49] I am he promised it
[1:02:52] I don't care how long it took it took no
[1:02:54] 120 years he waited you know brother I
[1:02:57] said God attest you too he told Norris
[1:03:00] I'm gonna shut the door let the people
[1:03:01] know he's gonna rain no one say oh boy
[1:03:04] it's gonna rain it's gonna happen it's
[1:03:06] gonna happen he told me and listen with
[1:03:08] the door shut and God waited seven more
[1:03:12] days
[1:03:14] seven days no I look really silly
[1:03:17] but he believed God yep he never thought
[1:03:20] well made out maybe I made a mistake and
[1:03:22] I need to come up out of Desire
[1:03:24] Hallelujah but God made sure he didn't
[1:03:27] because it was God who shut the door
[1:03:30] Hallelujah see he was predestinated to
[1:03:33] take that trip and so are you
[1:03:35] you and I are predestinated to make a
[1:03:37] Rapture and God will lead you to it or
[1:03:41] he's going to drive you
[1:03:43] and you don't want him to drive you down
[1:03:45] but he's more than able to do it
[1:03:48] right
[1:03:50] if it's not here today it will be here
[1:03:52] tomorrow
[1:03:53] right
[1:03:54] when it comes to Healing deliverances
[1:03:56] whatever the case may be listen I'm not
[1:03:58] trying to tell you to manufacture
[1:03:59] something if it ain't there amen's
[1:04:02] healing sickness whatever it is you go
[1:04:03] to the doctor
[1:04:06] yeah I just read what brother Brown said
[1:04:08] you know there's a lady who actually
[1:04:10] believed that going to the doctor was
[1:04:12] sinful he says not so
[1:04:15] it is not a sin
[1:04:19] and you know what he eventually told
[1:04:21] that lady go take your medicine
[1:04:27] there's a balance to this thing folks
[1:04:31] but the devil will make you think you're
[1:04:32] not even a Christian because you don't
[1:04:34] believe in medicine hello Jesus could
[1:04:37] have spoke to that woman but he took
[1:04:38] spittle and Clay I'm that man and put
[1:04:40] put in that eye Jesus could have said
[1:04:42] you're healed but he said go wash in the
[1:04:44] pool us along
[1:04:45] see there must have been something in
[1:04:47] there that would if it wasn't just
[1:04:49] obedience something
[1:04:53] so God has more than one method of
[1:04:55] healing and delivering y'all love the
[1:04:58] Lord
[1:04:58] God will try your patience make you wait
[1:05:01] a little longer than you expect to
[1:05:03] right see there will come a resurrection
[1:05:06] some may sleep but there will be one
[1:05:08] right think about it everybody
[1:05:11] throughout the ages had to wait
[1:05:14] wait can you actually be the Hebrew boys
[1:05:18] waiting
[1:05:19] on God
[1:05:21] and God still ain't answering and you're
[1:05:24] approaching the fire
[1:05:28] yeah but they said even if he don't
[1:05:30] deliver us we know he's able see that's
[1:05:33] the attitude that's the right attitude
[1:05:35] oh my God you yeah I'm gonna wait on God
[1:05:38] no matter what and listen
[1:05:41] I'm a you that's that's where we've
[1:05:43] gotta we've got to understand that the
[1:05:45] promises that God is true we can look
[1:05:48] back and say he kept everyone one of one
[1:05:50] of them every age has been kept by God
[1:05:52] every one of them and God will not leave
[1:05:55] this this age undone
[1:05:57] there will be divine love manufacture uh
[1:06:00] manifest excuse me in a bride there will
[1:06:04] be
[1:06:05] ain't no answer but about it it might
[1:06:07] not be a great number
[1:06:09] but there will be those
[1:06:12] and I'm so thankful to say I'm one of
[1:06:14] them
[1:06:17] let's stand
[1:06:25] I wish I could quiz you right now to see
[1:06:27] how many of us understood what's being
[1:06:29] said because I want you to understand by
[1:06:31] the grace of God what did I say the
[1:06:33] victory is on your knees
[1:06:36] now you gotta fight
[1:06:38] the devil to get on your knees
[1:06:41] I don't care whether you feel it feeling
[1:06:43] got nothing to do with it
[1:06:45] it'd be good to feel it but if you don't
[1:06:47] feel it you stay there you talk to him
[1:06:50] because you know he hears you
[1:06:52] come on somebody you think God can't
[1:06:54] hear you on your knees when you can hear
[1:06:56] what's in your head
[1:06:59] every thought that goes through your
[1:07:01] head God hears it
[1:07:04] come on somebody I might can't hear but
[1:07:07] he hears every bit of it whether it's
[1:07:09] good or bad come on somebody and I'm
[1:07:11] telling you right now people he's
[1:07:13] waiting on us
[1:07:15] he's waiting on us
[1:07:17] amen if we've been disconnected if we've
[1:07:19] got out of line get back in line I have
[1:07:22] you know when you see yourself amen
[1:07:24] you've drifted on this side and maybe
[1:07:26] this and that whenever you find yourself
[1:07:28] doubting something that God has said
[1:07:30] already listen the thing is to repent
[1:07:35] get on your knees everything
[1:07:38] because this is not a man this is not a
[1:07:40] message this is not an hour of private
[1:07:42] interpretation everybody in this area
[1:07:44] everybody got a private interpretation
[1:07:46] of what they think the word means that's
[1:07:48] why God had to send a prophet with the
[1:07:50] right interpretation because it wasn't
[1:07:52] his like I said a prophet is like a
[1:07:54] eunuch he has no seed
[1:07:57] only God speaks through him he's built
[1:08:00] that way
[1:08:01] you love God
[1:08:03] Heavenly Father God we come before you
[1:08:07] as humbly as we know how
[1:08:09] Lord we thank you for your goodness we
[1:08:12] thank you for your grace
[1:08:14] Lord we believe that we have your Holy
[1:08:17] Spirit
[1:08:18] but we also know there's a growing
[1:08:20] period
[1:08:22] there is a maturing Lord
[1:08:24] and father that's what we are here for
[1:08:26] tonight that you put such a hunger and
[1:08:30] thirst in your people that after tonight
[1:08:32] they will seek you every day
[1:08:36] oh until the fullness of Christ is made
[1:08:39] manifested in them
[1:08:41] this is not a group thing Lord this is
[1:08:43] the individual thing and I pray father
[1:08:46] God that you would do just that for us
[1:08:49] tonight
[1:08:50] granted in Jesus Christ's name we pray
[1:08:52] amen
[1:08:55] to be like Jesus
[1:09:01] to be like
[1:09:05] Jesus
[1:09:08] on Earth our long
[1:09:12] to be like him
[1:09:18] all through life
[1:09:21] Journey
[1:09:24] from Earth to Glory
[1:09:30] I only
[1:09:33] have
[1:09:35] to be like it
[1:09:40] to be like Jesus
[1:09:47] to be like Jesus
[1:09:53] on Earth our Lord
[1:09:57] to be like
[1:10:01] him
[1:10:03] Glory
[1:10:15] I only am
[1:10:20] to be like him to Love Like Jesus to
[1:10:26] Love Like Jesus
[1:10:39] foreign
[1:11:38] I owe I only
[1:11:47] amen
[1:11:49] I just want to stress one thing
[1:11:53] it is the grace of God
[1:11:55] that God gives us space to repent
[1:11:59] amen
[1:12:01] because remember amen he gave Jezebel
[1:12:04] space to repent and she wouldn't do it
[1:12:08] so think about the grace of God that he
[1:12:11] gives us
[1:12:12] space to repent and when he gives us
[1:12:14] that space we must repent lest we become
[1:12:18] like Jezebel
[1:12:20] amen you love the Lord he always will
[1:12:23] give you that space but you've got to
[1:12:25] take advantage of it
