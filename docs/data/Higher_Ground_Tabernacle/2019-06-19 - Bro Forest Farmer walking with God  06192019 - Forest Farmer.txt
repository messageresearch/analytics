and my son was preaching and I told him I said I want to get up and visit with y'all sometimes didn't knowing be twice just this quick but just really enjoyed the spirit among y'all you can be seated for a few minutes first off I want to thank you all for sharing your pastor with us up there and Lord willing you are coming to Arkansas here in a few days we're looking forward to it I'll put it like that it just really enjoyed his ministry and you know tonight I'm not a pastor and I won't bring you a pastoral message you've got a pastor to do that but just a little something on my heart maybe encourage y'all a little bit and you know we've all got potential you know the scripture tells us that that if a man says on to his brother raca and you know that's not a word we use all the time so I got to looking it up and it meant of no value said if a man would say to his brother that you're of no value you don't have any potential that he'd be in danger of hellfire I I don't want to fit that category because I believe that we've all got potentially minoo eyes reading a story here the the life story of a general and he was telling that when he was the the lowest grade officer with a commission but there came a time in his life that he they had a need to use him in a capacity that normally would take either a captain or a lieutenant colonel much higher rank that than the lowly lieutenant that he was but the man that placed him in that position to do that job saw the potential that laid in the man and when he went into the job just fulfilled that position flawlessly until they got another high-ranking officer to step in and take that and you know I I think that we could apply that to our lives - if we would our children our little babies know more about trust in the Lord and following the leadership of the Lord but then the denominational pastors know out just because of the word that's been waved over and the presence of the Lord that they've learned to recognize I'm sorry I I'll have y'all stand back up for just a second but I'd like to read two scriptures in Genesis five and and of course we all understand brother Branham talking about it especially through the the seals and and then right on up to the rapture of how that Enoch was our type of the bride for today they you know true enough that Noah a win across the flood but he said that that represented that those that would go through the tribulation but there was a greater type that was given to us and that was a neat of Enoch because he was and then he was not and the Lord took him away and you know I found I I know that there's 12 or 13 different places that brother Branham makes reference of that that he uses the term that even if he could not have the faith that Enoch had to just walk with God and then to walk home with one place pardon me not one place but several places brother branham's speaking of Enoch he said that Enoch just walked so far with the Lord that he didn't want to go back home I like that but him being a type of our rapture and brother Branham said that that was the fulfillment for our day of those who are alive and remain I like that if you'd read with me in verse chapter five and verse 22 and Enoch walked with God after he began Mathu Scylla 300 years and he begat sons and daughters and all the days of Enoch were three hundred sixty and five years and Enoch walked with God and he was not for God took a men may the Lord had his blessings to his word and y'all could be seated Minoo we've we've often thought and you know random said something that that is really peculiar and that being that Enoch walked with God he says a number of times for 500 years and wouldn't it be something that time could be accounted to a man that he wasn't even on the face of the earth but that he walked with God and you know it sounds a whole lot to me about life it was that that when the gourd wanted to speak to job then he said joke gird up your loins I'm going to talk to you like a man and then he asked him the question said where was you at when the sons ago and what would it be if God could account time before there ever was time to us of walking with Him but that's kindly were I just like to take a text for just a little bit in and y'all pardon me I'm not used to to using these iPads and all but I may just quote a couple of scriptures to you I know that clifford's already told y'all about me being healed and I thank God for that you know sometimes I feel like that God loves me more than he does anybody else but I think we all Lord a feel that way you know I was the boy that was supposed to be crippled all of his life I'm the boy that had a hundred pounds was supposed to be getting around on crutches but the Lord had something other to say about that you know a winner when mom and dad had four of us kids and and they still wanted another one why I don't know the way that us four was but at any rate that's what they did and and then on spiritual food and due season my mother stepped up in the prayer line there and there was a lady right ahead of my mother and brother branham spoke to her and he said first of all he said you've got a lady's problem and said you're real nervous and your just that age to be nervous and said you have a ladies trouble a female trouble he said and there's another desire that you have you you want the Holy Ghost he said do you believe that if I lay hands upon you the Holy Ghost will come she said yes sir he said you believe that she said yes sir so he steps down any praise for it and he said something along the line of Lord I lay my hands upon this woman in the apostolic form and pray that she would receive the the Holy Ghost and then he tells her he said now just go your way rejoicing it's the children's bread now and about that time my mother stepped up and he said you had a real funny feeling when I said female trouble did you cuz that's what you had well I I'm not real good at English but I do know that had is passed in and he said just going away praising the Lord and I've heard on one of the tapes you could hear my mother in her kentucky english just real faintly saying thank you Lord Jesus now we read in the book of Genesis about how that male chassidut come to Abraham and Sarah and said according to the time of life and all of us that are adults wait but we understand that cycle of life of fertility and that and we know that it happened back there but I want to tell you what I've seen in my life because on July the 17th of 1965 the prophet of God told her that's what you had and according to the time of life on April the 28th of 1960 my baby brother was born nine months and ten days later according to the time of life and then you want to tell me that rain cloud was rocket smoke get out of here you tell me how a rocket can blow up and perfectly form the image of the hoffmans head of Christ at 33 and then we'll we might have something to start talking about amen but but you know what we a lot of times I think if we're not real careful we're prone to just write everything off and saying well you know that was true in in brother branham's ministry or that was true in Moses's ministry let me tell you something Moses has fulfilled his time the prophet of God fulfilled his time what he told us when he was here preaching the gospel to us was that the devil couldn't take him off the face of the earth until God accomplished what he desired out of his life amen but now they have gone on but it is become our time now we've had instruction given unto us and we're I'd like to take this text from is the scriptures that we just read of walking with God now I every one of us in here we felt the presence of God we know that there's been times that you knew that you was absolutely walking with the Lord brother Isaiah several years ago I I had been on a missions trip and I was I'd come back into the States and it was a week later and brother Wendell Martin from down here at Pawnee Oklahoma called me up and he said brother force how are you doing I said man I'm doing great I said right now brother Wendell I feel like I just stepped out of the pulpit and it's been a week since I left them I said but you know what ain't sure that I'm content to live any other way you know when you get those highs but we was in if we was in a meeting here three years ago four years ago out in New Mexico brother Manuel Salazar hey and the Saturday night of the meeting III mean the the meetings kicked off our Wednesday night meeting what was what you expect for Saturday night or Sunday morning and and and it just the whole meeting went that way and on that Saturday night it was just like a wave that swept through the building the brother that was speaking he had had something that was binding him up a little bit and he jumped up any hollered he said I'm free and when he did you could tell that he was how long he stayed free I don't know I don't care but right then he was free and then just a few minutes later he was skipping across the platform hollering I'm going in the rapture I'm going in the rapture I'm going and it was just like a you've stood out in the ocean and you get up about chest deep in the water and those big waves come up and it'll just lift you up but that's what it felt like and just a wave and then another wave and another wavin and there was a minister's wife that was setting it back a good ways back that she thought she was leaving right then and she didn't want to leave her little boys she turned around and grabbed him by the hand it was that real I did not expect to get back home at two o'clock the next morning we drove through a little town about four miles before we get to my house and my wife said forced I'm disappointed I said sherry how in the world can you be disciplined she said I didn't think we'd make it I've heard my mother and my daddy talk about when they were going home from the prophet of God preaching the seven seals that they did not expect to make it home because the nearness of the coming of the Lord was so present with them during those services they didn't think that they'd ever make it 300 miles back home from Jeffersonville I know that feeling now all those that's went on before they fulfilled their time but church now it's our time there's a sister used to sing a song said this is my time this is the end time I can't think of another time that I'd rather live I gotta let my light show can't wait til tomorrow I gotta let my little light shine cuz this is my time you remember the prophet of God when he was preaching the message greater is He that is in you and he told the story about being out in Colorado and the storm blew up and they is forecasted in and he told of all the brothers that was out there with him and some of them said that they didn't think that their truck would get out if it came of snow and brother Ibrahim told him he said if you're gonna go just go on and he said now you brothers that stay he said I'll try and stay here and hunt with you he said but I'm telling you if it ever starts snowing he said when you see the first drop of snowfall at all get back to camp he said I've seen it in 15 minutes that didn't be snowing so hard that you can't hardly see your hand in front of your face and so he's up there hunting by yourself by the grace of God I've been allowed to go up in there and he said it looked down couldn't even see the bottoms no more because it was snowing them clouds just a whirling and twisting and sleet blowing and there it was the blizzard forecast for several days a big blizzard coming brother Thomas here brother Tom Simpson coming down from Canada heard the forecast he was advised not to go through that part of the country because this forecast said it'd be a blizzard were you at brother time I think yeah that they're right here and he the the blizzard was coming everybody had done set in for it well I put my gun back under my shirt like this my red shirt started walking down the mountain as I started I got about half a mile from the saddle and oh my the big drops of snow like that and the wind twisting up on that mountain and blowing I couldn't see the bottom no more I can see about 20 feet in front of me or 30 and I known to come right back down this little what we call little hog back a little ridge and then come off to the creek and then I known to follow the creeks and where to go if it got real bad and so then I started down and I got about half way down and something said to me just as plain as you hear me stop and go back well I thought what was I thinking about maybe it's just my mind and I just couldn't make another step forward and he goes on to talk about David woods said David had fixed me a sandwich that morning I think he tried to get even with me for fixing his daddy one one time of onion and honey that's all that we had so so he fix me a balloon you know I don't know what all it was wrapped in there but I had it in my shirt and it done got wet through my shirt and I thought I'll just stop and eat this and maybe I'll it'll be alright then so I pulled out the sandwich about ten o'clock and I started to eat the sandwich and as eyes eat the sandwich I thought now I'll be all right and I started to move on but something said go back where you came from go back through that storm a half a mile or more back up the mountain and into that dark timber where you can hardly see as far as that organ but I'm getting to be an old man and I've been a Christian now for thirty-three years and I know no matter what how ridiculous it seems mind the Lord and do what the Lord says now tonight we could stand here and give you testimonies of what I've seen the Lord do brother Isaiah could do the same thing we could have a test I couldn't hear what the testimony was but I'll find out later we could all give testimonies of what we've seen the Lord do and most of it is because that somebody minded the Lord no matter how ridiculous that it seems amen and I turned him went back to the saddle feeling my way back over sleep getting harder and harder getting darker and darker and I sit there and just put my coat up like this or my shirt over the scope again set down and I thought what am I doing here why would I come back up here and I just waited a few minutes and I started to get up again and as plain as I'd ever want to hear of I said I am the creators of heaven and earth I make the winds and the rain I took off my hat now this is that same prophet that would stand there and time after time the the Lord would discern things through him and you recall him the film there what was it the thirteen or fourteen different things that he tells that lady standing there and he says I said great Jehovah is that you you know sometimes the enemy wants to beat us up because we'll know that the Lord speaking to us and will question even a prophet great Jehovah is that you he said I was the one who made the winds to cease upon the sea I was the one who made the waves to go down I created heavens and earth was not I not the one that told you to speak to those four squirrels and they come into existence I am God now when a voice speaks to you watch the scripture if it's not scriptural you leave it alone I don't care how plain it is you stay away from it I said yes Lord he said speak to those winds in that storm and it'll go away now this Bible lays before me which my life is in that Amen I raised up I said I do not doubt your voice Lord I said clouds snow rain sleet I resent your coming now you get out of here you know sometimes people try and prove who they are but when a man really knows who he is when a man really knows that he's got the word of the Lord for somebody he don't have to pump up nothing he just stand there and speak what the Lord has said he said storm I resent you being here you're coming in the name of Jesus Christ go to your places I say that the Sun must come out immediately and shine for four days till our hunting trip is over and I leave with my brethren and it was just gushing just went like that and it started to go going then it went stop I stood real still my brethren up here was wondering what was happening and the sleet rain stopped and there come a wind whirling down through the mountains lifted up the clouds one went this way east north west and south and within a few minutes the Sun was shining nice and warm that's truth God knows that's truth I just stood there looking around with my hat off looking I you say I got numb all over I thought the very God of creation it's all in his hands what's he telling me and I picked up my gun wiped off the scope started to walk again going down the hill and something said to me why don't you stroll with me through this wilderness walk with me and I said yes Lord with all of my heart it would be one of the greatest things I could do was walk with you so I put my gun over my shoulder and I started walking down through that never I acts late in it virgin timber walking through there and as I did walking along down through these game trails I felt like I believe I'll go up to the place where yesterday was our anniversary and I'll stand there with just a few minutes just as a little salute to me to where it's a little bunch of quaking aspen trees up on the little nob and I said I believe I'll walk up there just as a salute to our anniversary and then I'll go back down this other side in those dark timbers and walk around and go over around by towards corral Peaks and come down that way just walking and rejoicing I was saying father I know that you are walking with me what a privilege there is nobody greater I could be walking with the berry God and that warm sunshine and then if you drop down just a few paragraphs to 1:29 brother branham starts talking about that that as he was thinking about sister median talking about how that she had work around the house and he'd tell her just come here and sit down next to me and so he said well a seat going up here she gets time to do her work going along there thinking that now remember I laid this Bible up here so you'd see that I'm before the word as I was walking along something happened to me I started first I was thinking about when I taking her up on the honeymoon up here she was a pretty little black headed brown-eyed girl I was lifting her over these logs you know and and everything and trying to get her up there this place where I killed some bear and I wanted to show her one and so where I got the these bear and she had on my cowboy boots and that's been about 22 to 21 years before that 22 years I believe it was ago we were married in 1941 and I was picking her up you know over these logs and I thought now poor little fella putting up with me she's done done turned gray yeah I thought well I'm sorry I'm reading so much but just bear with me here a second well and I went brother branham clears his throat and and I hadn't shaved for a few days and I found out I was great too and I seen my beard sticking out here gray and I thought oh boy you're just about finished now see you you're going to do anything you better hurry up you're getting old to see and so as I went along like that something taken place all of a sudden in every motion and principle I was a boy I thought as a boy you know brother Ritchie's telling me here a little bit ago that you just turned 71 and I told you didn't look or act like it and you don't but you also told me that you remember when you turn 40 you know I don't walk as fluid as I did when I was 40 years old anymore but brother Brennan said something happened to me and he said in every motion I was a boy again I thought like a boy in every motion in principle I was a boy I thought as a boy and I had my head down I looked up and just as plain as I ever saw her there she stood sister meaty before me with her arms out and I stopped I rubbed my face I looked I said media is that you honey I looked here I thought now what's happened and I thought yes I'm walking with him anything could happen when you're walking with the Lord when you're walking with him somebody that you've been praying about that you get you've been trying to get hold of and they've been running away from him won't answer your phone call you say whatever you want to about it but I'm a witness of it because I was on a lake down in Arkansas that a couple of young men that I was trying to get a hold of been trying to reach him brother Isaiah for three years and one of them I've been out fishing with him and when I was out fishing it but he was on one side of a brush pile knives on the other was fishing a creek for crappie and the crappie we got it by my Hathor little bitty fellas but they had some big uns down there where they was that and man I set the hook on it and squalled my dragon I got his head up on top of the water and I said he'd go about pound and a half and I said hey look - here here comes a pretty good brilliant or what he comes running around there and he looked out there and he said oh brother farmer he said them's just the little in debt here so I'm out here fishing on the lake by myself a cold front bloating you couldn't hardly hire a hit and finally I got one little in that God and I took him off and I threw him back in the water and I said feller go tell your grandpa come up here and talk to me and you know III went to fishing a little bit and boy I set the hook on one and he squalled my drag and I got his head up on top of the water and I talked to myself sometimes fishing well well and bless it wherever I go you know I take my business partner with me I like having him with me you know and I said looky here here comes a pretty good and when I did my mind went back to fishing with them boys back four or five years before that as soon as I got that fish in I throwed him in the lab well I jerked off my cap and I went to pray and I said Lord you know I've been trying to get a hold of him for for these last three years and he won't even answer my phone call I went on fishing fishing I finished out my fishing trip caught a master fish I got up to the boat ramp when I did I run into a a Pentecostal preacher and talked to him for a little bit actually the way I got started talking just I'm sorry y'all he had a name on his boat and it was quote-unquote the visitation I said sir how did you come by the name on your boat he said well I'm a minister he said I pastor the the first United Pentecostal Church and Olive Branch Mississippi I said okay he said sometimes when I just really need to get away said I'll take the boat out and go fishing and if anybody calls looking for me my wife tells them he's out on visitation I said yeah I like that so we talked there for a few minutes and I got in the truck and pulled my boat out of the water and I was about thirty minutes on my way back home and my telephone rung and I didn't know the number not well this might be a real estate agent calling me with some work that there won't done because that's the work I was doing a mostly for real estate agents I pulled over on the side of the road and I answered it and it's one of them boys that I've been trying to get ahold of for three years he said poor farmer how you doing I said I'm doing fine I said but I don't know how you're doing I said son I just called your name out in prayer standing out in a boat it ain't been two and a half hours ago he said brother farmer I got to get back to where I was with the Lord at one time I said son I want you to know something if there's a desire in your heart to get back to where you was with the Lord there's a place in the arms of the Lord Jesus that was tailor-made for you you know brother I'm talking about that you hug your your sweetheart up to you and there's nobody else that can fit that print I want you to know that the bride of Jesus Christ that's been embraced in the arms of the Lord Jesus there's nobody else that can fit that print like we do oh I'm telling you he's a known time of God yes he is he said yes I'm walking with him and it changed then and I was back an old man again and the vision was gone from me and I stopped put it over my heart and I said Jesus my heart has been so burdened for years I don't have to tell you that I'm burdened I've repented I've repented I've done everything I know and why has it this burden doesn't leave me and I just started walking on as it was a climb this little knob just about 30 or 40 yards in front of me I started up this little Knoll and begin to feel real weak and there was a little quaking aspen out ten inches through a come-up made like a L and then went up again and I just got up there and I felt so weak and I was staggering it I I just I had my cap back on again and I just laid my head up against like this fit me just right to lay my head right here against that little quake and a slight this it's really a poplar it looks like a birch see and it I just laid against there and I was just standing there with my head down that warm Sun hitting me in the back and I think the very God that departed that rain and that wind and I heard something going Pat Pat spat and I thought what's that the water was all blowed off the Sun was out uh what's that spat and I looked down and it was water from my own knives cutting down through the gray beard and dropping off on the dry leaf that God had dried up laying before me and I just stood there like this just against the tree but in my hand this hand down my head laying against the tree my hand on the rifle sling like this standing there crying and I said god I'm not worthy to be your and I said I'm sorry I made many mistakes I I didn't mean to make mistakes Lord you've been so good to me my eyes closed and I heard something going stomp stomp stomp stomp I raised my eyes and standing right in front of me come three deer and I thought there's brother Evans one brother woods one and there's the three deer see just what I'm looking for now the rain dried up I reached to get my rifle I said I can't do that I promised him I promised God that I wouldn't do that see I promised him I wouldn't do it and something said to me but there it is and I thought yes that's what a man told David one time God delivered him into your hands you know King Saul and Joab told him said kill him there he lays and he said god forbid that I'd touch his anointed and those deer stood there and looked at me and I thought they can't get away there's no way for them to get away they're not thirty yards from me I got this rifle standing here and there's three deer no I can't do it I just can't do it it was a doing two big fawns and i i i just couldn't take the rifle i said i can't i never moved i just stayed there i said i can't do it because i promised god I wouldn't do it though then brethren they they don't need them deer see I I can't do this I just can't do it and that don't come walk now listen there'd been a hundred men shooting at them up there for four or five days scary the first sign of red and I had on a red shirt red cap first sign they're gone but they were standing there all three of them looking right at me I said mother take your babies and go out in the woods you're in my hands your life is in my hands I ain't going to hurt you I promised God that I wouldn't see and she walked closer she would look at me all of them walk closer till they come so close they could eat out of my hands nearly they and the wind blowing right on me so she turned around walked back a little piece all three of them and here she come back again walked right up to me I never moved I just stood there I said going out into the woods I love it to live see your life is in my hands but I spare you you couldn't get away you know you could I can kill all three of them and just about well one second three seconds anyhow just as fast as I could fire and they couldn't get away standing right by me and I said I spare you go on and live and I stood there and they went walking on went out into the woods I wiped my face like that and just then something happened a boy spoke out just as clear right out of them blue skies not a cloud it had all been within just a little bit of time and a voice spoke out and said you remembered your promise didn't you I said yes Lord he said I remember mine too I'll never leave you nor forsake you the burden left my heart it hasn't been there since may it never be again never again then I come to Tucson strange thing I have never had so much happening since I've come down I I believe it was God holding forth a tower I believe the time is now at hand for something must take place if we could only receive this truth now just a moment if we could only realize what this scripture means he that is in you is greater than he that's in the world we can't understand that yet we say we believe it and we know it's true but we really don't understand it greater is He that's in you greater is He that's in you than he that's in the world what is in you that's greater it's Christ The Anointed God that was in Christ is in you greater is He that is in you than he that in the world then if he is in you I said here a little bit ago that we could stand and give testimony still daylight in the morning not I'll tell you this much starting about the middle of January brother Isaiah when I was on my way out to harmony in the desert when I met you out there from then until about the middle of March I believe if I had somebody to write it down in a book I could write a book on what I'd sing the Lord doing too much time you say all brother farmers that that's really good it ain't me doing it it's him see if a man tries to take your glory from the Lord won't share his glory with it brother Isaiah continued of time after time after time of what you've seen the Lord do we go into a foreign country brother Isaiah we see the Lord do so much more but I believe it's because of the expectations of the people and also that we dedicate ourselves but I have found that if we would dedicate ourselves here in the States the way that we do when we go on a foreign trip that the Lord will do just as much for it whether it's in our Arizona or wherever you're at have you ever noticed that the Lord Jesus when he gave them instructions he told them beginning at Jerusalem when your endued with power beginning at Jerusalem I like to ask people every once in a while where's your Jerusalem when you're filled with the Holy Ghost the prophet of God told us we've got everything that lays within us already when he gives you the Holy Ghost to take a rapture right then when you're in dude with power where's your Jerusalem at whenever that starts the prophet of God said somebody asked him a young man said should I go to a seminary said no he said go out your candles lit he said while that fires burning don't let it die out amen I'm sorry I just had to preach here just a second it's no it's not you anymore living it's him living in you see it's not you're thinking what you would think about this it's what he said about this then if he is in you he absolutely would not deny what he said he couldn't do it but he would keep what he has said and he is trying to find that person that he can vindicate himself through God is trying to find that person that he can vindicate himself through you know tonight I'd like to ask you why can we not just humble ourself about like that young Mary that when the angel spoke to her and said something that was so fantastically strange there's no way that this has never happened but because it lined up with the word when Isaiah said that a virgin shall conceive that when the angel came to Mary and told her that be this on to you this is this is going to be that Mary said be it unto me you and I have had an angel through the message of the hour to come and tell us that God is searching out for some person that he can vindicate himself through can we not just raise up our hands tonight and say Lord be it on to me I need somebody to sing my praises Oh God be it unto me I need somebody to play a musical instrument that rings out in harmony to the voices I need somebody to testify of the love of the Lord Jesus Christ I need some personal witnesses that'll go to work and witness to somebody about how good that the Lord is Lord be it on to me let me be that fulfillment let me be a part of the vindication brother I say why don't you come up and and just pray over the whole church with us if you would if you want to stand up and and just raise your hands to the Lord let's just reach out to him tonight he's looking for that person Lord here am I here am I send me let's all just pray according
