[6:30] he would never forget us
[6:32] he would never leave us nor will he
[6:35] forsake us
[6:37] so we thank god for those of you who
[6:39] have come out to the house of the lord
[6:41] who appreciate the lord jesus and all
[6:44] the songs that have gone up before the
[6:46] lord we're not prolonging the time we're
[6:49] going to ask that you turn with us to
[6:52] philippians 2 5 and 6
[6:55] philippians 2.
[7:05] we preached this message when we were
[7:08] in michigan and we're going to
[7:12] work it this night um
[7:17] some added things and i trust the lord
[7:19] will bless you
[7:20] in his word tonight
[7:23] philippians 2 we're gonna read the fifth
[7:25] and sixth verse
[7:30] and then we'll go to revelations 10
[7:34] 1. philippians 2 5 and 6.
[7:38] let this mind be in you which was also
[7:42] in christ jesus who being in the form of
[7:46] god
[7:46] thought it not robbery to be equal
[7:50] with god revelations 10
[7:55] which is a familiar scripture
[7:59] we started the first verse and i saw
[8:02] another
[8:03] mighty angel come down from heaven
[8:06] clothed
[8:06] with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his
[8:09] head
[8:10] and his face was as it were the sun
[8:14] and his feet as pillars of fire and he
[8:17] had in his hand a little book open
[8:20] and he set his right foot upon the sea
[8:23] and his left foot on the earth and cried
[8:26] with a loud voice as when a lion roared
[8:29] and when he had cried seven thunders
[8:32] uttered
[8:33] their voices and when the seven thunders
[8:36] had uttered their voices
[8:38] i was about to write and i heard a voice
[8:42] from heaven saying unto me
[8:45] seal up those things which the seven
[8:47] thunders uttered
[8:48] and write them not and the angel which i
[8:52] saw stand upon the sea and upon the
[8:54] earth lift up his hands
[8:56] his hand to heaven and swear
[8:59] by him that liveth forever and ever
[9:03] who created heaven and the things that
[9:05] therein are
[9:07] and the earth and the things that
[9:09] therein are
[9:10] in the sea and the things that which are
[9:13] are therein that there should be time
[9:17] no longer but in the days of the voice
[9:20] of the seventh angel
[9:22] when he shall begin to sound the mystery
[9:25] of god should be finished
[9:27] as he have declared to his servants the
[9:29] prophets
[9:30] let us pray
[9:34] dear lord we thank you tonight we
[9:38] appreciate everyone that have come out
[9:39] to the house of the lord
[9:41] tonight lord we realize oh god those who
[9:46] did come came
[9:49] in a way of a sacrificial
[9:52] offering a willing offering though
[9:56] and we thank you for those who have come
[9:57] we pray that you bless them in a special
[9:59] way
[10:00] for those who could not make it here
[10:01] tonight for various reasons we pray that
[10:04] you bless them as well
[10:06] and those are men who are who are
[10:08] listening
[10:09] perhaps on the uh youtube that
[10:12] they will be blessed as well we ask
[10:15] these things in jesus christ's name we
[10:16] pray
[10:17] amen
[10:22] so we thank god for his grace and his
[10:24] mercy
[10:26] and i'm going to try to take my time and
[10:29] speak as clearly as i possibly can
[10:32] so that that those who are listening to
[10:36] the interpreter can
[10:38] understand what i'm saying
[10:41] but i want to entitle this
[10:46] message living in the evidence
[10:50] living in the evidence you know brother
[10:53] branham talks about a witness
[10:55] if you're going to be a witness he said
[10:58] it can't be
[10:58] something that has been told you it
[11:01] can't be a
[11:02] hearsay to be a witness you have
[11:06] you must be there to see it and
[11:10] with your own eyes to be a real
[11:13] testimony that the
[11:15] uh event did happen
[11:18] now we weren't there in our natural
[11:21] 2000 years ago but one thing
[11:25] jesus said that one day you'll be a
[11:27] witness
[11:30] of me and you must understand that if
[11:34] that be the case uh god is expecting us
[11:38] to have
[11:39] an experience that will
[11:43] become evidence that jesus christ is the
[11:46] same
[11:47] yesterday today and forever
[11:51] when we think about god and
[11:54] how the lord came and what he did for us
[11:58] it really uh encourages our soul
[12:02] it does more than that i'm so grateful
[12:06] that god has
[12:07] given us the grace to live in this
[12:10] hour because out of all of the ages
[12:15] we have the opportunity to see god
[12:18] in his fullness amen
[12:21] not in a partial way but we have come to
[12:25] see
[12:25] god in his fullness
[12:29] when god sent uh
[12:33] saint luke 17 30 and when the son of man
[12:36] was being revealed
[12:38] in our day the world at large
[12:42] large had no idea what they were looking
[12:46] at uh some looked at him
[12:49] as a little kentuckian and some
[12:52] uh look at him with envy and hatred
[12:56] there were those who were jealous and
[12:59] all this was a was a man who had been
[13:02] chosen by god
[13:04] to do a special work in these last days
[13:08] uh william branham was he uh anointed
[13:11] with the spirit of elijah
[13:13] uh he was a prophet of the age and he
[13:16] came to declare
[13:18] that jesus christ is the same yesterday
[13:22] today and forever he did not come to
[13:26] build a kingdom for himself
[13:29] hallelujah like we have you know
[13:32] in in our day different people following
[13:35] different men
[13:37] but we're like the scripture describes
[13:41] as paul said follow me
[13:44] as i follow christ we as i said is
[13:47] living
[13:48] in such a great time the bible tells us
[13:52] that we are supposed to let the mind
[13:54] that was in christ
[13:56] be in us and every time i think about
[14:00] that it just illuminates me
[14:03] it excites me because i believe that i
[14:06] have a promise
[14:08] that will come to pass
[14:11] and god when he promised us things
[14:14] there is nothing that makes him do what
[14:17] he does
[14:18] except his promise he is the god a man
[14:22] that cannot be
[14:23] flattered he can't be manipulated
[14:26] he can't be bought amen and the reason
[14:30] why
[14:30] god do what he does is because he makes
[14:34] his promise
[14:35] and when he makes a promise the bible
[14:37] says that his promises
[14:39] are yay amen every promise god has made
[14:44] god is obligated and will do
[14:47] amen make those promises come to pass
[14:51] there was a time that
[14:55] god was working in men and i want to
[14:58] read a quote in just a moment but
[14:59] he was working in men just like you and
[15:02] i
[15:03] god has always veiled himself in the
[15:06] beginning he was the pillar of fire
[15:09] in moses day he was the burning bush is
[15:12] that right
[15:13] in in abraham's day he was the three men
[15:16] walking up in the cool of the evening
[15:20] is that right amen god has always
[15:23] availed himself but there are those whom
[15:26] god
[15:28] reveals himself to and um
[15:32] these ones who god reveals himself is
[15:35] likened unto sons and daughters of god
[15:38] for example amen you had cain and abel
[15:42] amen they were required amen to bring
[15:44] forth a sacrifice
[15:45] unto the lord but they didn't have any
[15:48] literature and they didn't have any
[15:49] books
[15:50] they didn't have a a computer or in the
[15:53] internet
[15:54] uh the revelation the the understanding
[15:57] of what god wanted them to do had to
[16:00] come by revelation
[16:01] and we realize amen that abel amen
[16:04] received god's
[16:06] revelation in other words he received
[16:08] the very thought
[16:09] of god's mind to understand what he was
[16:13] to do
[16:14] or what was necessary for him to do
[16:17] and we find out but cain amen did not
[16:21] receive the revelation
[16:23] he you know and you got to understand
[16:25] now
[16:26] he understood by intellect
[16:29] but he didn't understand by revelation
[16:32] because god
[16:33] told cain that if he would go and do the
[16:36] exact what
[16:37] abel had done that his sacrifice would
[16:39] be accepted
[16:41] but being who he was a son of a serpent
[16:45] amen he was stubborn and refused to bow
[16:48] down to the word of god
[16:50] hallelujah you see we're here in today
[16:53] we're here
[16:54] to worship god and in order to worship
[16:57] god you worship him in spirit and truth
[17:00] understand what truth is truth is
[17:04] the word he said because my word is
[17:07] truth
[17:07] amen but you must have amen by god's
[17:10] grace that holy spirit
[17:12] because the holy spirit is the author of
[17:15] the word
[17:15] hallelujah he is the alpha he's the
[17:18] omega
[17:19] he's the beginning he's the ending amen
[17:21] he is the
[17:22] shepherd of our soul
[17:26] i heard something today
[17:33] and this man was preaching as a friend
[17:35] of mine and
[17:36] i don't normally listen to others but he
[17:39] said something that really
[17:41] struck my attention and
[17:44] in this he was talking about polycop
[17:49] and how polycock was a true servant of
[17:51] the lord and most of us need
[17:53] we know who apolo cop was and you know
[17:56] he was one that was hated
[18:00] amen among those pretend
[18:03] christians and of course roman itself
[18:07] you know we know how polly cop died they
[18:10] set him afire
[18:11] and uh they tried to set him afire
[18:14] and things wouldn't work and so they
[18:16] literally pierced him in the
[18:18] in the side and all of his blood ran out
[18:20] and
[18:21] and drowned the fire but one of the
[18:23] things that he
[18:24] said uh uh because the voice of god says
[18:27] fear not
[18:28] polycop i'm with thee now i don't know
[18:31] about you
[18:32] but if i have been fearing just a little
[18:35] bit
[18:35] and just to hear the voice of god speak
[18:38] to me
[18:39] amen that voice would automatically cast
[18:42] out the fear
[18:44] that i was experiencing and so what
[18:46] polycop
[18:48] said to himself was play the man
[18:52] now i don't know what my friend was
[18:54] talking about
[18:56] what all he saw when he stated that
[18:59] but i thought to myself the scripture
[19:03] let this mind be in you for example you
[19:07] know
[19:08] many of us don't remember the old
[19:12] stereos we used to have we call them
[19:15] records
[19:17] and they were made out of hard plastic
[19:19] or something
[19:20] but anyway we had uh and you had a
[19:23] little needle on
[19:24] there and it'll drop down on the record
[19:26] player and it began to play
[19:28] and it began to play and that's how we
[19:30] got out sound maybe i'm really old and
[19:32] y'all don't know what i'm talking about
[19:34] maybe that was in the ancient of days
[19:35] but in my day amen we spent lots of
[19:39] money on
[19:40] those kind of things like people are now
[19:43] spending on cell phones and all that
[19:44] kind of stuff
[19:46] but anyhow sometimes that record would
[19:49] get scratched and when it would get
[19:52] scratched
[19:53] it would play the same thing over
[19:56] yeah or skip yeah it would play the same
[19:59] and then you have to hit it
[20:00] for it to skip sometime because you
[20:02] wanted it to move on
[20:04] amen and so when i thought about play
[20:07] the man i thought okay
[20:09] this what i believe god wants us to see
[20:13] you see because we had an example in our
[20:16] day we call him elijah
[20:18] he had the spirit of elijah on him his
[20:21] name was william branham
[20:23] and i believe that if we would could
[20:25] play him
[20:27] because you got to understand the power
[20:29] that was behind him
[20:31] it was not his power it was the holy
[20:33] ghost power
[20:34] and the things in which he did we're
[20:37] able to do it
[20:38] let's supposing we playing a tape and he
[20:42] says
[20:42] you can do it and it gets stuck there
[20:45] you know what's going to say you can do
[20:47] it you can do it
[20:49] you can do it you can do and and and
[20:51] after a while when you hear
[20:54] that you can do it over and over again
[20:56] all of a sudden you say
[20:57] i can do it i can do it i can do it
[21:01] and that's what playing the messages is
[21:03] all about
[21:04] is because when you play the message
[21:06] you're playing the man
[21:08] not the man william branham but the man
[21:11] christ
[21:11] jesus hallelujah and those tapes amen
[21:15] and those books
[21:16] that we're constantly reading over and
[21:18] over sometimes you get stuck on one take
[21:20] for about a week or so
[21:23] amen because it gets so wonderfully good
[21:27] amen you just don't want to let nothing
[21:29] slip through the cracks
[21:31] amen so anyway i'm gonna say a few
[21:34] things on that because
[21:35] i believe that these characters and i
[21:37] heard brother branham say it
[21:40] these characters in the bible was put
[21:42] there for us
[21:44] they're there for us so that we can
[21:47] understand their behaviors
[21:50] in times of crisis
[21:53] hallelujah and if we could catch a hold
[21:56] of
[21:57] their uh life style of what they would
[22:01] do under certain circumstances
[22:03] and play that then you'll realize that
[22:07] what they did
[22:08] you can do also because what they did
[22:12] was impart
[22:14] but now we have the whole hallelujah
[22:18] think about it in the new testament it
[22:21] talks about a greek woman a phoenician
[22:23] woman
[22:24] and the prophet of god has a quote and
[22:26] i'm going to read that to you
[22:28] he talks about it amen and
[22:31] in the message perseverance and i think
[22:33] right now this is a time where god is
[22:35] asking us
[22:36] to persevere you know when you persevere
[22:39] you got
[22:40] literally you got a pressure you got
[22:42] obstacles
[22:43] you got things that will hinder you from
[22:46] moving forward
[22:47] if you didn't put a press to it you know
[22:50] she she you know she pressed through the
[22:52] crowd you see
[22:54] so but anyway he says this little greek
[22:58] woman
[22:58] no doubt had heard i like this of him
[23:02] heard of jesus the great revival
[23:06] a young prophet coming up in galilee
[23:10] from nazareth and was showing great
[23:13] signs and wonders she had heard of him
[23:18] and faith comes by hearing this
[23:21] seraphine woman
[23:24] being a greek hallelujah faith
[23:27] finds sources that others
[23:30] don't see amen
[23:33] hallelujah now you think that god would
[23:36] have used
[23:37] a jew at that time but he took a gentile
[23:42] a greek and he found
[23:45] faith in her heart many times people
[23:49] don't even know they have faith
[23:51] because they're resting upon feelings
[23:54] where feelings and faith lives in two
[23:57] different worlds
[23:59] they are basically of two different
[24:00] dimensions
[24:02] hallelujah faith is something that you
[24:04] cannot explain
[24:06] but you know you got it and see no
[24:08] matter what the devil tells you the
[24:10] devil says
[24:11] you won't make the rapture but the faith
[24:13] is a strong man
[24:15] say you are a liar because i have
[24:18] already made the rapture
[24:21] amen you see and i'm gonna just pause
[24:24] here for just a moment
[24:25] you know when uh uh elijah there was a
[24:29] a mount karma showdown
[24:32] and it was between the bell worshipers
[24:36] and ahab and elijah
[24:40] and remember amen when they were up on
[24:43] top of the mountain
[24:45] amen we we understood that elijah said
[24:49] uh it wasn't going to rain until i
[24:52] called for it
[24:53] but during this mount calmer showdown
[24:59] amen
[25:04] we we know that elijah told his servant
[25:06] go check
[25:07] and see if you see a cloud and he went
[25:11] seven times and on the seventh time he
[25:14] says
[25:15] i see a cloud about the size of a man's
[25:18] hand
[25:19] now you know amen that
[25:23] he wasn't looking at a cloud that was
[25:24] that size
[25:26] but what it was he was measuring you
[25:28] know they didn't have measure
[25:30] but he looked up and that cloud was
[25:32] about the measure of the size of his
[25:33] hand
[25:35] but the cloud up in the sky if he had
[25:37] gone was able to go to that cloud
[25:39] was far bigger than that and when he
[25:42] told elijah he said listen
[25:44] i see the cloud of the size of a man
[25:47] hand
[25:48] you know he says hurry up get in your
[25:50] chariot
[25:51] and go why because we're going to have
[25:54] an outpour i like that i like that
[25:58] but you see what happened the chariot
[26:00] was going too slow
[26:03] and that chariot represented the
[26:05] pentecostal church
[26:07] but this message is faster it's in a
[26:10] different dimension
[26:12] and what elijah running the way he was
[26:14] running
[26:15] what was happening he was in a different
[26:17] dimension
[26:18] you know no man can wear on like that
[26:21] amen
[26:22] without the help of the lord and what
[26:24] happened elijah
[26:26] beat amen ahab and the chariot and
[26:28] everything else
[26:30] to that place where he could see
[26:32] everything else you say tie that in
[26:35] because when we saw the cloud when the
[26:38] prophet of god was caught up
[26:40] he he was transferred uh transformed and
[26:45] changed into another dimension is that
[26:47] right
[26:48] and he ran faster than the pentecostal
[26:51] church
[26:52] in other words he was able to come back
[26:54] and tell us the future
[26:56] of what events would take place
[26:59] amen he told us amen about how
[27:02] jezebel would come and try to and kill
[27:05] and and put
[27:06] out a warrant oh
[27:09] you know a warrant you know what i mean
[27:10] by that
[27:12] for him in other words jezebel wants to
[27:15] kill him
[27:16] amen and you know of course that
[27:19] discouraged him but
[27:20] i'm trying to tell you something when
[27:22] god opened the seals
[27:25] he left pentecost back there and the
[27:28] message
[27:28] that we received since then
[27:31] hallelujah is a message of rapturing
[27:35] faith
[27:36] y'all understand me in other words i'm
[27:38] not doing away
[27:40] with it but i'm trying to tell you that
[27:42] it's already been judged
[27:44] leo this year's been judged she's been
[27:47] found wanting
[27:49] hallelujah god is not in laodicea
[27:53] because they put him out right
[27:57] so i'm saying these things to show you
[28:00] that we must
[28:01] concentrate on one thing he said one
[28:04] thing brothers one
[28:05] thing and and and we must make sure
[28:09] that this one thing of prophecy come to
[28:12] pass
[28:13] and what is that our translation
[28:17] one thing our maturing into christ
[28:21] one thing the fullness of god being
[28:24] manifested
[28:25] in us because we are
[28:28] the evidence of malachi 4
[28:31] and revelation 10 7. y'all understand me
[28:35] we're the evidence we're the proof that
[28:37] is real
[28:39] when god began to transform us
[28:42] as he has been in these years
[28:46] he we it proves that this message is
[28:49] right
[28:50] because we have accomplished things
[28:52] within our personality
[28:54] that we know that could not have taken
[28:56] place
[28:57] without the supernatural visitation of
[29:00] the angels
[29:02] you understand me
[29:06] let this mind be in you what christian
[29:09] in the denominations
[29:11] understand that scripture
[29:14] you know what they do they water it down
[29:16] says he can't really mean
[29:17] that but he means exactly that
[29:21] let the mind of christ be in you and so
[29:24] i ask you the question
[29:25] what was the mind of christ but god
[29:27] himself
[29:30] see we think like men and god says quit
[29:32] thinking like men
[29:34] think like gods supposedly
[29:37] amen you was in a situation and an
[29:40] obstacle got in your way
[29:42] and you was a god would you fret no sir
[29:45] you tell the obstacle get out of my way
[29:49] because you're god of the obstacle
[29:52] but if you're a man you'll be fight
[29:54] fight excuse me
[29:55] you if you're a man we will be fainting
[29:58] like peter and the rest of them
[30:00] he said what do you mean remember when
[30:02] they were on the boat
[30:04] and the wind began to become bolsterous
[30:06] brother said
[30:08] that was a type in the shadow you know
[30:09] that right we're getting ready for a big
[30:11] storm
[30:13] hallelujah god is getting ready to test
[30:16] your faith not just here in in higher
[30:19] ground the whole
[30:20] christian world is getting ready for a
[30:23] real big storm
[30:24] he said the wind blew the oars away that
[30:27] means you couldn't travel
[30:29] you couldn't move it was it was he was
[30:31] being tossed
[30:33] whichever way the wind was tossing that
[30:35] little ship it had to move
[30:37] is that right there was nothing to guard
[30:40] it with
[30:41] the sails broke you know and they
[30:43] thought here is jesus asleep
[30:45] and brother said that's exactly right
[30:48] he's perhaps resting
[30:50] since the last revival
[30:54] and all they can do now y'all know how
[30:56] oh remember when brother
[30:58] was here oh remember what jesus did oh
[31:00] you know they were going through what
[31:01] they experienced in the past
[31:04] and they forgot that jesus was still on
[31:06] the ship
[31:07] see that's the thing as christian as
[31:09] message believers
[31:10] we have forgotten that jesus is still in
[31:13] the ship
[31:14] he's in there amen he preached a message
[31:17] go away jesus
[31:19] hallelujah another message he preached
[31:21] calling jesus on the scene
[31:23] he said you gotta awaken your
[31:25] consciousness y'all know what i'm saying
[31:27] hallelujah because we have a good
[31:29] conscience toward god
[31:31] by what the resurrection to know that
[31:33] jesus christ
[31:34] is still in the ship but we gotta awaken
[31:36] him we've got to stir him up
[31:39] in order to have a revival in our souls
[31:42] yes sir hallelujah
[31:46] that faith see i said that seraphinisian
[31:49] woman god took somebody that
[31:52] nobody knew faith finds sources that
[31:55] others don't see
[31:57] and when she heard she believed she
[31:59] might have heard it of a neighbor's girl
[32:01] being healed of epilepsy which the child
[32:04] had
[32:05] and they may have they might have heard
[32:08] of the epilepsy
[32:09] being healed so her daughter had needed
[32:12] need of healing and she had heard jesus
[32:16] could do it
[32:18] hallelujah now you say well brothers
[32:21] what are you saying you got to
[32:22] understand that
[32:23] faith presses through the crowd
[32:26] let me say that again faith presses
[32:29] through the crowd what crowd
[32:31] all of the crowds of unbelief faith
[32:35] presses through it when the crowd is
[32:38] trying to hinder you
[32:39] from the object who is jesus christ or
[32:41] from the object
[32:43] which is your healing faith presses
[32:45] through
[32:47] in other words get out of my way
[32:50] yes sometimes faith got to elbow you
[32:55] to get you out of the way but faith
[32:58] never quits
[32:59] and it's something that you can't
[33:01] explain to anybody
[33:02] you don't know how to tell them why you
[33:04] believe what you believe but you believe
[33:06] why you believe this message tell me how
[33:09] what makes you believe this message
[33:12] hallelujah you might say well brother
[33:13] books i'm an evidence i know what god
[33:15] has done for me
[33:16] well a pentecostal church could say the
[33:17] same thing
[33:19] hallelujah but it's deeper than that
[33:22] because this message gives you identity
[33:26] hallelujah remember i've said it before
[33:29] why you did not follow uh
[33:32] uh billy graham why are you not
[33:34] following billy graham
[33:36] why did not you follow uh uh oral
[33:39] roberts
[33:40] but when you heard this message you
[33:43] heard a scream
[33:44] you heard something that was familiar
[33:47] and it caused you to follow why
[33:49] because jesus said my sheep heareth my
[33:52] voice
[33:53] and a stranger they will not follow
[33:57] hallelujah and i i feel like preaching
[33:59] but i got these quotes i got to read
[34:01] amen so really he said for he
[34:05] was god's word thomas jesus made flesh
[34:08] saint john 1. in the beginning was the
[34:10] word and the word was with god
[34:13] and the word was god and the word was
[34:15] made flesh
[34:16] and dwelt among us the same yesterday
[34:19] today and forever he was there to reveal
[34:23] the promises of god for his
[34:26] day you understand me there was a lot of
[34:30] people who
[34:31] faked it who pretended to be the elijah
[34:35] before the elijah came amen
[34:38] but you can't think it see he couldn't
[34:41] fake it
[34:42] in fact he didn't even know he was
[34:43] elijah for a long time
[34:46] but the gift that god had given to him
[34:49] right
[34:49] the bible said your gift will make room
[34:52] for you
[34:54] right so he had to manifest
[34:57] who what malachi fought he had to
[35:00] manifest
[35:01] revelation 10 7. he had to manifest
[35:05] luke 17 30. he had to manifest those
[35:08] scriptures
[35:08] and if he had not if he was not able
[35:11] to manifest that then he would have been
[35:14] thoughts
[35:15] according to the word but he hid every
[35:18] mark of the scripture
[35:19] describing who he was right he was why
[35:23] because he
[35:24] had christ god on the inside
[35:27] remember jesus did the same thing in his
[35:29] day
[35:30] hallelujah jesus said if you don't
[35:32] believe that i am he
[35:34] go search the scripture for in them they
[35:38] testify of me
[35:40] hallelujah and the prophet of our day
[35:42] could have said
[35:43] if you don't believe i'm the elijah
[35:46] he wasn't a proud man but he could have
[35:48] used it if you don't think that
[35:50] that i am he go search the scriptures
[35:53] find out what jesus promised
[35:55] in this day he promised that before the
[35:59] world
[35:59] in i will send you elijah
[36:03] hallelujah who elijah what the prophet i
[36:06] will send you elijah
[36:08] and not only that the son of man amen
[36:10] will be
[36:11] in this son of man and he will do the
[36:14] things that he did
[36:15] prior to the destruction of sodom and
[36:19] gomorrah
[36:20] he would have a gift of discernment did
[36:23] he prove it
[36:24] there were times several times he turned
[36:27] his back to the audience
[36:28] and called the names out of the people
[36:30] who needed healing and deliverance
[36:33] the same thing that the angels did
[36:36] amen when he met abraham in the cool of
[36:39] the evening
[36:41] here with sarah in the tent laughing at
[36:44] the promise
[36:45] hallelujah how can this thing be
[36:48] how can i have a child how can this
[36:50] thing be
[36:52] amen i'm old hallelujah
[36:55] how can this thing be my husband and i
[36:58] haven't seen pleasure
[36:59] in a long time and the bible said sarah
[37:02] laughed up her sleeve jesus
[37:05] or the son of man amen who visited
[37:09] abraham at that time says why did sarah
[37:11] laugh
[37:12] and sarah said i did not laugh she said
[37:14] yes you did
[37:16] right amen she didn't know who was
[37:18] visiting her
[37:20] hallelujah the prophet god said god
[37:22] would have killed her if she hadn't been
[37:24] part of abraham hallelujah you look at
[37:27] sarah but i want you to know we've been
[37:29] like sarah
[37:30] and god would have killed us long time
[37:32] ago had not we been a part of jesus
[37:35] christ
[37:36] oh hallelujah that's the way it is
[37:40] you know i was thinking there when they
[37:42] were singing that last song i forgot
[37:43] which one
[37:44] when it was but i thought oh my god
[37:48] i'm gonna see the fullness we're going
[37:51] to see the fullness
[37:53] y'all understand me you've been chosen
[37:56] to see the full
[37:57] manifestation of god hallelujah
[38:01] yes don't you understand i wish i had my
[38:03] cloud up here the cloud is not just
[38:06] uh something that god wanted to just
[38:08] take a picture of
[38:10] it came to signify something
[38:14] amen hallelujah it came to signify
[38:17] the defeat of all of the false prophets
[38:22] hallelujah did elijah them kill him he
[38:25] they did
[38:26] hallelujah you hear what i'm saying it
[38:30] it came to show amen that there is
[38:32] coming a
[38:33] fall of jezebel and her whole company
[38:39] that was a sign it was more than just
[38:41] seven angels
[38:42] it they came to signify god's victory
[38:46] over the devil and guess what nothing
[38:49] can stop it
[38:51] [Music]
[38:53] hallelujah amen not even jezebel right
[38:57] oh i'm going to kill him i'm going to
[38:58] kill him god god said yeah the dog's
[39:00] going to eat you up
[39:04] you see what i'm saying we're at a
[39:06] wonderful time
[39:07] that you and i are going to see god in a
[39:09] way we never thought we could see him
[39:11] you know what's going to happen but
[39:12] brother battle said listen he said it
[39:14] like this
[39:14] all that was in god he poured it into
[39:16] the to christ
[39:18] and all that was in christ important in

[39:39] its own will oh
[39:43] oh my god they haven't seen nothing yet
[39:46] it'll be a short quick work you say oh

[40:47] you hear me he is here to do it
[40:51] he was in the days of the prophets he
[40:54] was in moses

[40:58] he was in the rest of them to reveal
[41:01] god's promise
[41:02] of that age hallelujah
[41:05] this is what is so important that we
[41:07] could see that the rapture is on now

[41:17] hands of god

[41:20] hallelujah and
[41:21] let and come to know that each trial
[41:24] come to make you strong
[41:28] hallelujah i'm excited tonight because i
[41:31] really believe that will not fall from
[41:32] the translation
[41:34] and after the translation comes the
[41:36] destruction of the world
[41:38] and it's coming it's coming
[41:41] why because i'm coming
[41:45] you coming amen you can't even you can't
[41:48] even break the chain
[41:50] hallelujah the pool that god's got on
[41:52] you is his pool
[41:54] you can't even stop him hallelujah he
[41:56] you're caught in the trap
[41:58] you're caught in the net hallelujah he's
[42:00] roped you he's tied you up
[42:02] he's tangled you up and you can't get
[42:04] away matter of fact a true believer
[42:07] don't want to get away
[42:10] hallelujah he was in the rest of them to
[42:12] reveal god's promise
[42:14] of that age god
[42:17] lauded his word to each age hallelujah
[42:20] and he sent a prophet
[42:21] and the word goes to the prophet and
[42:23] straightens it out and that's exactly
[42:25] what he has
[42:26] done through the all the ages don't you
[42:28] see that's why we can't repeat just what
[42:30] what pentecost did they they were
[42:33] worshiping devils and didn't even know
[42:35] it
[42:36] blood in their hands and blood in their
[42:38] forehead and
[42:40] all kinds of strange things witches
[42:42] among them
[42:43] and they thought they were they were
[42:45] spirit-filled people
[42:47] but the prophet of god came and
[42:48] identified every bit of it
[42:50] and made fun of him
[42:55] yes he did
[42:59] you understand he did the same thing the
[43:01] elijah did on mount carmel
[43:03] go call for your guard scream louder
[43:07] maybe he's on a vacation
[43:10] huh see you got to know what you got
[43:13] this message of revelation 10 7 let me
[43:16] tell you something
[43:17] if the world could have it they'd take
[43:18] it
[43:20] if if listen it's the truth even if
[43:23] pentecost knew what it was
[43:25] they would have never let it go but
[43:27] somebody
[43:28] had to play the part where the bible
[43:31] according to revelation said
[43:33] that he was going to make jezebel a bed
[43:38] in other words he was going to set it up
[43:41] so these people could be seduced
[43:45] huh you say what oh yeah god set it up
[43:49] because his word said that they would
[43:52] right and they would commit spiritual
[43:54] fornication with the
[43:58] we know who that is it's the catholic
[43:59] church they're gonna take us off to
[44:01] youtube if it's playing or not anyway
[44:02] but anyhow
[44:05] you must understand you can't be afraid
[44:07] this is not a time to be a shy
[44:09] of what you believe no somebody need to
[44:13] hear it
[44:15] don't be ashamed no no no no
[44:19] no lord no right
[44:22] if any time it's time to really tell
[44:25] people that god sent a prophet
[44:26] so that you can see christ and what he
[44:29] did in it
[44:30] jesus christ the same yesterday
[44:31] therefore people say you don't need to
[44:34] say that but well let me tell you like
[44:36] this you don't need to say
[44:37] that you use another name for noah then
[44:43] there's an ark right but let's get
[44:45] people to jesus
[44:46] with jesus which jesus
[44:50] because our jesus is a different jesus
[44:54] i ain't telling you to worship william
[44:56] branham but i'm gonna tell you you gotta
[44:57] let him know there's a message that came
[44:59] through him
[45:01] is that right listen let's go to egypt
[45:04] just for a moment
[45:05] because here was joseph's brothers and
[45:08] i'm jumping all over the place
[45:09] but joseph brother did not want to
[45:11] recognize the gift that was in him
[45:13] but look what happened he goes to egypt
[45:16] and everybody you came in contact with
[45:19] recognized that god was with joseph
[45:21] that's right
[45:23] amen that's the way it is the very
[45:26] people that
[45:27] should recognize jesus they don't
[45:30] the bible said he came to his own and
[45:33] his own received him not
[45:35] but to such that would receive him he
[45:38] gave them the power to become the sons
[45:40] of god
[45:43] hallelujah think about it potiphar
[45:46] recognized him here he was in the jail
[45:51] the thesis uh and the butler in the jail
[45:53] house recognized him
[45:55] from one prison hall for one prison he
[45:57] looked like he was getting deeper
[45:59] and deeper and deeper amen into some
[46:02] dark place
[46:03] you understand me see when god take a
[46:06] trial
[46:07] and it seems like every time you turn
[46:08] around you get go deeper
[46:10] you go deeper you go deeper you know
[46:13] what's next a resurrection
[46:16] hallelujah he's taking you down so he
[46:19] can bring you up
[46:22] hallelujah your trials are not there to
[46:24] consume you
[46:25] they're there to perfect you gold
[46:29] tried in the fire hallelujah and you say
[46:32] oh are you going yes
[46:34] amen you're a diamond in the rough so
[46:37] god got to chip you off
[46:38] some in order for you to reflect christ
[46:41] jesus
[46:42] through the light of god you're all
[46:46] right with that
[46:47] give me a few more minutes see he is on
[46:49] he's the one here in the form of the
[46:51] holy ghost
[46:52] who knows everything and can reveal
[46:56] anything that he desires to do
[47:00] she believed this and no matter how much
[47:03] people didn't believe
[47:04] faith finds a source that other people
[47:08] don't know
[47:08] nothing about and when a man has got
[47:12] faith in god
[47:13] he's got a hold of something that he
[47:16] can't
[47:16] explain it it's something
[47:20] that he's got to hold off he cannot push
[47:23] it
[47:24] or shove it or pull it it takes
[47:27] him hallelujah that's the way faith
[47:31] is when a man really got faith in god
[47:34] it finds that source that others
[47:38] don't see
[47:41] you love that now that's wonderful to me
[47:44] see and when you say well what brothers
[47:46] why are you saying
[47:47] maybe i'm maybe i'm losing my mind
[47:50] i i'll say it like this but i believe
[47:53] that when you're born of god it makes
[47:55] you an amateur god
[47:57] like when you're born a man you're born
[48:00] an amateur man
[48:02] right if you're born of god you're born
[48:05] an amateur
[48:06] god because you're born of the same
[48:08] substance that god
[48:09] is just like you're born of the same
[48:12] substance as a man
[48:13] as your as your father and mother is
[48:15] y'all understand me
[48:17] so when you look at this thing you say
[48:18] well why would god do that that's the
[48:20] full manifestation of god
[48:23] you can't you can't preach about adam
[48:25] and leave eve out
[48:27] eve was a part of adam regardless to
[48:30] what she was
[48:31] and what she did and it proved that she
[48:34] was part of him because he took her back
[48:37] hallelujah like god is taking us back
[48:40] we are part of him and without us he's
[48:43] not satisfied he can't be
[48:46] filled
[48:48] that's why he says eat the book eat it
[48:52] all up
[48:53] eat the word eat the flesh of the son of
[48:56] man
[48:57] drink the bloody bleeding word of jesus
[48:59] christ
[49:00] see he because because we become him as
[49:03] he has become
[49:03] us right see that image of the invisible
[49:06] god this is what i'm saying
[49:08] when you say oh brothers what are you
[49:09] trying to say what i'm trying to say is
[49:11] that
[49:12] if we don't if we how can i say it the
[49:15] handship
[49:16] is here and the headship is jesus christ
[49:19] himself you understand me we're just a
[49:23] body
[49:24] but he is the headship right
[49:27] so in order to be complete the body in
[49:31] the head must connect
[49:33] and the connection of the head and the
[49:35] body comes through the baptism of the
[49:37] holy ghost
[49:38] hallelujah not just being baptized in
[49:40] water but baptized in the holy ghost
[49:45] right and you must mature and connect
[49:48] into christ where the body and the head
[49:50] is speaking the same thing the only way
[49:53] you can do that is remember his word
[49:56] hallelujah listen in the message
[49:59] putting on the whole arm of god uh
[50:03] here he says amen just like the word in
[50:06] the beginning was spoken to
[50:07] us in the garden of eden spoken word
[50:11] and the second time it was made flesh
[50:15] and dwelt among us and the third time it
[50:19] becomes part of us
[50:20] when the holy ghost dwelling in us god
[50:24] coming into a man whoa
[50:28] oh i'ma say it again i gotta say it
[50:30] again and the third
[50:31] time it becomes part of us
[50:35] when the holy ghost dwelling in us god
[50:38] coming into the man hallelujah
[50:42] that's like me wearing a suit i'm coming
[50:45] into the suit
[50:46] my flesh become god's clothing but
[50:49] inside the clothing is god himself
[50:54] help us jesus right amen
[51:00] god coming into the bands he first spoke
[51:02] the word
[51:03] the enemy tore it down then the word was
[51:06] made flesh
[51:07] he was crucified but now amen listen
[51:10] this
[51:10] but now there's a difference in the word
[51:15] the word is become the church and the
[51:18] church
[51:18] is the word oh my god
[51:22] you know what he just said in the
[51:24] beginning was the word
[51:26] the word was with god and the word was
[51:28] god
[51:29] so the church become god
[51:32] hallelujah she has the authority of god
[51:36] she has the power of god is that right
[51:38] jesus even said after which the holy
[51:40] ghost has come upon you
[51:42] you shall receive power and that power
[51:45] means
[51:45] authority this is where we fell
[51:48] from adam and eve had the same authority
[51:52] and now since the seals has been opened
[51:55] god takes us
[51:56] back to the beginning where the church
[51:58] is the authority of god on earth
[52:01] not the catholic church no the blood was
[52:04] churched
[52:08] all that god was he poured it in christ
[52:11] all that christ was poured into the
[52:13] church see
[52:13] the holy ghost now the enemy's got
[52:16] something
[52:17] right see then he isn't fighting
[52:20] something back here
[52:21] see so you and i must understand and i
[52:24] didn't know for a long time like i think
[52:26] i said it here before
[52:27] when i when i would read the scripture
[52:29] put on the whole i'm a god
[52:31] i thought i had to get the helmet from
[52:32] somewhere i had to get the breastplate
[52:35] from somewhere
[52:36] i had to get my short feet shot from
[52:38] somewhere i had to get different
[52:40] pieces of the armor out of the bible
[52:41] somewhere but i didn't understand
[52:44] that the fullness of the holy ghost is
[52:47] the armor of god
[52:48] jesus christ in you is his victory
[52:52] you understand me when god can stand in
[52:55] your shoes
[52:57] hallelujah that is your armor
[53:00] greater is he that is in us than he that
[53:03] is in the world
[53:04] i feel like shouting tonight yes i do
[53:08] why his presence has come we've seen his
[53:11] presence amen
[53:12] come through william branham but
[53:14] understand amen his coming
[53:16] and his presence is linked together
[53:19] right
[53:20] so you understand by the grace of god
[53:22] amen we're
[53:23] looking literally for changing of the
[53:27] body
[53:28] which body your body yes amen
[53:32] hallelujah and when that same presence
[53:35] has come
[53:35] into you the pillar of fire is now in
[53:38] you
[53:41] then you become the person of the logos
[53:46] huh brothers what are you talking about
[53:48] boy i'm telling you
[53:50] that i just not we didn't just begin
[53:54] my birth was in 1956 but i was before
[53:57] then
[54:00] you was before then but we came into
[54:03] this place to be tested and tried
[54:06] hallelujah but god knows the outcome he
[54:09] knows the end result
[54:11] that's why he put every one of our names
[54:13] in the lamb's book of life
[54:16] before the foundation of the world amen
[54:18] i hope i'm not going too fast brother
[54:20] okay amen i'm almost done i'm almost
[54:24] done
[54:24] one body we we the very essence see we
[54:28] in
[54:29] most people i'm telling you we must
[54:31] allow the holy spirit
[54:33] to mature us into christ we must
[54:37] because we're the evidence that this
[54:39] message is right
[54:41] they've forgotten about william brown
[54:42] and most of the people they've forgotten
[54:44] about the revivals and everything that
[54:46] took place now
[54:47] back then but we need to let them see
[54:50] he's alive and well
[54:52] the pentecostal church is dead they can
[54:55] sing they can shout
[54:56] speak in tongues you know sprutter like
[54:58] a car that needs a tune-up
[55:01] but you and i must understand the
[55:03] evidence that god
[55:05] word is true cannot be complete
[55:08] see the old testament cannot could not
[55:10] be complete without us
[55:12] we're the cap of the whole whole thing
[55:15] with
[55:16] the culmination i don't know whether you
[55:17] can say that the culmination of the
[55:19] whole thing
[55:20] with the crooks we're the end of it
[55:22] hallelujah the head of it
[55:25] somebody help me here oh my the bride of
[55:28] jesus christ
[55:30] is a part of his god here
[55:33] remember adam and eve was once adam adam
[55:38] you understand me now the whole earth is
[55:40] named after him jesus christ i'm almost
[55:42] done
[55:44] but i'm gonna read this quote here
[55:46] coming from christ it's the mystery of
[55:47] god
[55:49] and in there there would be a time come
[55:52] forth
[55:53] when he could express himself in
[55:55] fullness
[55:56] of his godhead deity through his church
[56:00] hey somebody fullness
[56:03] expressed his god's head through
[56:06] his church and you know what the godhead
[56:09] means it means supreme authority
[56:13] the essence of being god
[56:16] the supreme being he wants to express
[56:19] the supreme being through us oh
[56:22] somebody ought to say hallelujah why
[56:25] because it's not by power
[56:26] not by mine but by my spirit says the
[56:29] lord it's not
[56:30] him that willeth nor he that runeth but
[56:32] god who shows mercy
[56:34] thank god for the mercies of god you
[56:37] said what are you talking about
[56:38] brother branham didn't want to be no
[56:39] preacher he ran
[56:41] from it he did not want to be a preacher
[56:45] and god had to spank him to get him to
[56:48] do what he wanted him to do
[56:51] when he was falling into the dark pits
[56:54] of hell
[56:56] he said oh lord if you get me out of
[56:59] this place
[57:00] i'll do whatever you want me to do you
[57:03] see what i'm saying
[57:04] and sometimes god has to take us that
[57:06] way in order to wake us up
[57:10] hallelujah i feel so good
[57:14] listen oh my he says what
[57:18] the anointed man now the anointed people
[57:22] oh my to bring back the anointed bride

[59:11] omnipotence of god
