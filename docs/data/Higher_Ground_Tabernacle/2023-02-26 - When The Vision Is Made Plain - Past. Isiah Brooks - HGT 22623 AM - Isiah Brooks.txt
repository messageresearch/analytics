able to pull out they are here I thought Isaiah was going to beat a kill but a kill beat Isaiah glad to see you all the others who are here there's a lot of folks missing yeah you see but I trust wherever they may be God is blessing them I know that some are now uh serving the lord in a different place that's all good as long as they're serving the lord um no matter where it it encourages me when people go to church we know it's not all about church wherever they preach in Jesus Christ I'm excited somebody said well I don't have to go to church to find Jesus when you find Jesus he's going to tell you to go to church that's the will of the Lord you see the day approaching together amen as we stand we're going to give other to the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen we had our brother Justin by the house we had a wonderful Fellowship um she came even after she finished work but we still had a great time amen let us turn to Isaiah book of Isaiah the 60th chapter and we're going to come from Matthew yeah we'll read the 12th and 13th verse Matthew excuse me Isaiah 60 is the Old Testament all right and Shine for the light has come and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee left to us for Behold The Darkness shall cover the Earth and gross Darkness the people but the Lord shall rise upon thee amen and His glory shall be seen upon thee was and the Gentiles shall come to thy light and Kings to the brightness of thy Rising Hallelujah we'll now go to Matthew 6. 6 12 and 13. and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors and lead us not into temptation but Deliver Us from Evil for dying is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever amen I'm going to worry your patience just a little bit Romans 14. we'll read the 17th and the 18th verses out of Romans then when I ask you to read one more scripture and then we'll be seated but the kingdom of God is Not meat and drink but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy ghosts free that's all we need really for he that's in these excuse me for he that in these things serveth Christ is acceptable to God and approved of men so those who serve God in the Kingdom is acceptable to God that means god accepts you see since you and approved of men Hallelujah [Music] mark 11. 22-24. and Jesus answering said unto them have faith in God Jesus severely I say it to you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he said therefore I say unto you what things soever ye desire When you pray believe that you received them and ye shall have them let us pray father God we come before you Lord we thank you for being so good Lord I pray this morning revive this service that's why we come to church [Music] amen amen you may be seated hmm amen amen it was once hot now it's cool but I thank God for his grace [Music] but by the grace of God I am comfortable in the Holy Spirit I like to uh entitle this message when the vision is made plain you know the book the word of God tells us that without a vision uh the people parents and we understand the Bible is one big Vision something that God reveals to his people in order to serve him you see God but God be adds to add to attitude Hallelujah amen he's the god that continually unveil himself I mean we cannot comprehend god without a finite Minds so the Lord has to come down to our level he has the condensation the god of the universe The God Who made all things you think about it we can't even comprehend the performance how the Sun stays in place stays in place and just to think it's just nothing is out of order the thing is how much we might think the things yes [Music] we're living in a horrible Society but it is in order why because God prophesied through the through the uh uh gospels by way of the Old Testament he told us that this day would come in this day lovers of pleasure of God now we see our own eyes I can't understand people still want to watch Hallelujah we hate the word of God because the Bible says I want to say this think about it the Bible has all of your answers to your questions [Music] [Music] it tickles me a little bit you know because men think basketballs that they're smarter than God hallelujah now you can believe that you came from a monkey Deadpool um anyway yeah let's say frog he doesn't know how to interpret that word and I don't know how to tell him but the point is there is an evolution yeah in evolution but it's not according to science God has an evolution but it's not based on the laws of science it's based on the spoken word when God said let there be bring forth Our Kind s every time they get to that point they destroyed themselves [Music] I'm just going to give you a just a small example word of God in the last days this is a day of high breeding the cows they have breed the chicken they have breed the corn the the Maize whatever they can hybrid they do it you do phone it may be prettier sometimes those pieces so big we won't eat them but that comes from high breeding it's what I want to excuse me what I want to say is that according to the prophet of God every time you high breed something right that's why we all you know what I'm saying we we go and we work out those cows and like they say the comedies you are what you eat right you can't help it in America everybody folks that's the truth but it doesn't give us life it brings diabetes to process strange food I'm just saying that I'm working with a spiritual aspect because the bride of Christ we don't want me to Hallelujah the glory of the Lord Hallelujah because in this last days foreign [Music] and so it's not the man but it's the force behind the man not behind the man Christ that is and these men and they are part of the Kingdom Hallelujah they do Kingdom things because I'm trying to give you a vision so that you can understand that we're not called to the Lutheran anointing call to the Wesleyan knows and that anointing is there for us but everybody won't embrace it claims to be a Christian will not Embrace this anointing is here at the opening of the word amen we came to he called her bone why because she was in His image and lightness in this last day looking for church I'm not talking about a Baptist Church you understand me because all Israel is not Israel certain group of people is special class of people by his foreign [Music] no no you can't enter into this place any kind of ways Hallelujah no sin you know the Bible said uh if your brother has an option you make that thing right all right Hallelujah no unclean thing will enter into the city I was born unclean I was born y'all understand what I mean why am I why am I saying what I'm saying because I do not want anybody systematic worship you must be born again lead us not into temptation but Deliver Us from Evil now I don't know whether you feel that way but that's what I like allow me to be enter into temptation but Deliver Us from Evil this is what I like growth inside of me Omar is that right the Bible says God dwelling once a month in human foreign foreign [Music] yes when you come to God you must give him all of us you say what do you mean brother Rooks I haven't even gotten to my notes yet too many Rich Young rulers in the message Hallelujah Lord I do all of these things [Music] have you been born again that's the question because see really Jesus said to the Rich Young rulers [Music] cream of the clock they look like like he said I'm a real dude he said and in my life you couldn't find one pouch it was perfect Hallelujah but you see he had a religious spirit he was used to serving God according to the Jewish customs remember because what happened then when he met Jesus God took him off that high horse if you talk to God do you talk back to you God will speak back oh but Jesus was connecting himself to his people his people's name was Jesus Jesus Paul had to change there's a Time Paul said the good that I would do yeah [Music] I find not the way to do it but the evil I find a way to do it you understand me he said there's a law within me there's a law of Life there is a law of death but he said Thank be to God and Savior Jesus Christ Hallelujah so no matter our grandpa how we feel within ourselves always recognize the word of God hallelujah amen it's something how it quickens you yeah God has a way of making connections how many of you who how many of you has uh out here that has the Holy Ghost explain it to me there's no way to explain it and if you can't explain it you don't have it but you know once you get it something happened foreign [Applause] Hallelujah and that's that is really important it's important because we're coming into a time God will use individuals speaking the word foreign how is going to all happening I believe the word of God Hebrews 13 and 8. the Bible said Jesus Christ the same yesterday that means God does not change and what he did yesterday hallelujah how many of you believe Jesus Christ what's the fullness of the godhead father Jesus Christ is the creator Hallelujah the Bible says according to Saint John Hallelujah in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was gone that word Belgium as the only begotten of the father Jesus Christ somebody said well he wasn't he wasn't he wasn't even here hallelujah [Music] and listen when God began to use a person go to the king Palace he doesn't go to the governors why because God grows how to clean up America like it was in the Book of Genesis that's what he does to the seed of God Hallelujah the world might call me a prostitute but Jesus says [Applause] [Music] sheep here is my voice foreign [Music] Hallelujah we come to a place we're not just Christians Hallelujah where the word made flashlights [Music] the kingdom is not out here in Wyoming he's in here that's why it brings peace Christians don't have jobs [Music] hallelujah oh yes amen oh yes I love this word Jesus Jesus through all his ministries what to expect even in the animal kingdom anymore the animals teaches their young wine see see because we don't have a revelation of what he said if I didn't have God I'd forget my own name sometimes but the truth of the matter is when he talked about that he wasn't dealing with your flesh he was dealing with your teeth the body that God gave you before the fall I've wanna shoot them and in your theophany you know all things that's why Adam she was made with his theophany but just like the problem you receive this message that means you got a party somewhere [Applause] [Music] [Applause] hey man I don't know about you but I'm one of them so I know I got a college my calling is not to be just a message preacher without a vision the people perish zombies [Music] right they don't ran out of things to do you know all of the world and it's just to keep the people attention oh it's the truth don't you understand where the church world is worshiping all over again they don't even know it he said prove that to me scriptures amen they look like the same thing seven artists they look like the technology but why was worship Him I love the way Moses says hallelujah and what happened [Music] Hallelujah [Music] oh man cause she wasn't afraid of Moses amen Hallelujah let me say it like this you understand what I'm saying we talk about a Rapture how many of you have such an anointing we don't even have enough anointing for healing somebody help me here Hallelujah think about it you think Joshua just thought well I'm gonna say to that song if [Music] [Applause] [Music] is you walked on water are they Mastered on the zoo raised folks from today under that I know that he created bread still didn't want to hear his gosh he didn't take away from him amen you say he's the only he ain't the only one that said that you know Paul said it but in different words Christ that lives in me I'm dead you see me Hallelujah they had anointing Hallelujah Hallelujah like Joshua and Caleb said [Music] um I didn't cross over here just to be be a weak Christians is he I'm sorry brother I'm going so fast forgive me great is he that's in me then he that is in the world Hallelujah you really believe that I have to believe that I would ever lay this body down somebody help me man like the insurance man told brother Brandon said hey that Assurance won't get you into it get you get you in the grade oh we're little creators people don't even believe that but we are this is we we we pervert things and make sure God is already made you understand what I'm saying I mean these lights and everything else you know back in the day don't try to describe this to somebody what kind of Witchcraft if you try to tell them that you he was flying [Music] riding in the automobile y'all know what I'm saying I mean those kind of thing are like talking on the phone foreign absolutely why absolutely coming from the message Hallelujah he said after receiving the Holy Spirit God made the whole world out of nothing his word is creation was created that's what gets me let me just take it when it comes to a a horse let me use the dog the smart um a dog never have to go to school to learn how to bark Luciano boy a dog never left never have to go to school to learn how to bite that dog knows his mama it's man is we're the Fallen creatures we gotta learn how to talk and understand what we're talking about we have to learn how to walk divorce when they give birth especially to a horse you understand me those laws work with those kind of animals but there is a law of God each seed bring forth of its kindness you'll never find a horse in space because [Music] we're all growing but never lose your vision is that right Abraham see Abraham never lost his vision amen he didn't look for shitty he shall shout out to Winfield and maker with God he knew that you really existed because he met melchized Hallelujah and he knew my character that was a prince foreign and go down to Babylon Babylon look down there amen and and when uh Shadrach Meshach and abilities so I'm just going to say that's why people can't see God especially in human being because we're like badgers we're like that you know and people would especially if they know if they knew you as a sinner Christian now you can't comprehend God behind you don't know how bad you used to be amen thank you Lord that's how they look at Jesus you're taking any good thing come out of Nazarene foreign with the Roman soldier so he is why the Jew said do you think because in their mind Jesus hello so they couldn't see the Messiah he was likened to the badger skin there was no Beauty [Applause] and I noticed as a complete and it comes to pass just like you said it is that the spoken word is possible so so I said 172. you see when you speak anything good to you to us speak it till we believe it we believe it and that creative words what I'm trying to say is let's come to a place I'm bringing that issue to you this morning you must come to know [Music] that mainly that means you believe everyone every all of the words Hallelujah is that right if you if you are see ing you believe to know the Holy Ghost is necessary you believe that Jesus Christ does not change Jesus Christ we came to be sons and goddess of God that Jesus is Alive and Well I'm not talking about singing and dancing but I came to with power Hallelujah elephant [Music] you can give your body to be burned corporate bully you can feed the poor do all the religious things but you must have the Holy ghosts that is your Saving Grace he said I'm sure you all could see what it is it is see what it is coming of a greater deeper anointing of the Holy Spirit I don't know the only thing I know it takes God to put you into it take it foreign Hallelujah just remember you are the dove is the same nature is the most gentlest of all the birds of the heaven is the most interest of all the beasts of the earth so you see the spirit would coincide with one another this is hallelujah that's like when Jesus was being baptized Hallelujah in order for the dove to come down it can't be a wolf um the dove could not come on the wolf see it wouldn't stay there the wolf is a killer the lamb is gentle is that all right so why give me one more scripture you love the Lord now there's more to be said last week I preached the higher calling bringing you to a place where you can see to come into this it takes God to train you before me like 80 years when God trained Moses you train you almost all your life just to just to serve one purpose for me Hallelujah don't be discussed discourage at your mistakes and your faults hallelujah amen you love the Lord natural you know I'ma say it like this the natural man has to die yeah yeah every day is that right Paul said I died daily even when we make our mistakes we kill him today tomorrow we let him rise again you love the Lord is she a lot of times people don't understand how how do you I wonder what they with Paul said and follow me as I follow Christ they would have looked at him like a culture oh they looked at John that way they look at Jesus Jesus had 12 disciples their families and they following Jesus Jesus don't have no way to lay his head Jesus Christ you know you look at these and I I hate to say it but I'ma say it these Hollywood churches and the Bible speaks against all of that yeah okay my watch poster and set upon the towel and we'll watch to see what he will say unto me what I shall answer when I am approved is you know what I know the message in itself has been spoken evil of the message since I've been in this message in all manner of disease yes it's true there was a brother never met him but his father met me in the United States was born with some kind of retardation pray for that guys now our brother Danny I think Danny told me he knows I think it was brother Daly that told me I never met the man nobody can't tell me what he can't do nobody can tell cannot tell me what God can yes just in this church how many times we had these bad storms coming our way yeah and we wanted to have church and the storm dissipated and the news people said we don't know what happened but the prayer of a righteous man there's only one person we're here to glorify yeah you love the Lord second verse and the Lord said unto me and the Lord answered me excuse me write the vision make it plain upon tables that he may run that readeth it I think for the vision is yet for an appointed time because it will surely come it's a computer and it will not care yes so many things you don't have to be a rich and mighty in this world being great in the sight of God you have to be humble in your heart God calls that greatness he that's great enough to Humble himself that's great Hallelujah you love the Lord amen so we know by God's grace because I can't finish it just too much God's grace the Lord is is really doing something for us and we're approaching you see how the political realm moving in other words the Christians are becoming the enemy we're the ones that hold we're holding up Satan's moves and you know there's a time that that the world used to respect Christians Hallelujah I don't know what was happening in Congo and other places [Music] this is Ohio because God can't move without you God chooses I'm sorry foreign I'm gonna read this thing and I'm Gonna Let You Go oh Lord I believe the hour is soon coming that when the Loaves and the fish will be multiplied they will come a mark of the beast people don't even know that the market what the mark of the beast is a nice Church see the Hallelujah [Music] right there will come a mark of the beast there will come a confederation of churches they are put out they're put out a sign unionizing the church that no man can buy or sell in your church if it won't bother them in your church it won't bother them but the Holy Spirit and feed them as you did Israel in the world that's what people don't understand they shut the doors to the stores you can't uh buy or sell um foreign but um I'm just going to close here you know see but God is trying to get our attention like I said uh uh last Sunday this is your moment I can't I can't reveal this to you something God must reveal today make it happen in your life I'm not preaching this message to make you anxious I'm trying to make you aware the calling in which God is anxiety try to make
