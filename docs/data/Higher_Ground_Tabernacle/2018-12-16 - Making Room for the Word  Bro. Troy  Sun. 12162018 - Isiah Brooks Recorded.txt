thing when the Bride of Christ starts to make her requests known unto the Lord amen I remember you know the Daniel chapter 10 I believe it is Daniel 9 or Daniel had an eat his knees he started praying he prayed he prayed he prayed prayed for 21 days and all of a sudden the angel Gabriel was sent to him and when the angel came to him he said as soon as you start praying God started listening amen and I am come for every word that you pray maybe that's a blessing amen so we just said we just sung that but we actually prayed that Lord prepare me to be a sanctuary amen how many believes it he'll do it amen how many believes he's already done amen amen let's just open our Bibles to the book of 2nd Kings chapter 4 speak a message this morning called making room for the word second second Kings chapter 4 we'll start with the eighth verse and read on down to the seventeenth verse it says and it fell on a day that Elijah passed to Shuna where was a great woman and she constrained him to eat bread and so it was that oft as he passed by that he turned into there to eat bread and she said unto her hut unto her husband behold now I perceive that this is a holy man of God which passeth by us continually let us make a little chamber I pray thee on the wall I let us set up for him there a bed a table and a stool and a candlestick and it shall be that when he cometh to us he shall turn in thither my things are getting ready and it fell on a day that he came thither and he turned into the chamber and he lay there hey man remember the word comes to the prophets Haven and now the prophet with the word is now laying in their own house in their chamber that they prepared for him and he said take a haze' his servant call this Shunammite there was he was laying there something came on his mind while he was laying there and he said to Gaza his servant call this Shunammite and when he had called her she stood before him and he said unto him say now unto her behold thou hast been careful for us with all this care what is to be done for thee wouldest thou be spoken for to the king or to the captain of the host and she answered I dwell among my own own people and he said what then is to be done for her and gaze as answered verily she hath no child and her husband is old and he said call her and when he had called her she stood in the door and he said about this season according to the time of life thou shalt embrace a son a man let's just stop right there hey man Alyssa's bow our heads and word of Prayer Heavenly Father we just want to thank you Lord for your word Lord it's it's great and rich father Lord we just thank you for every every scripture father and Lord and this morning as we have gathered together one body in your name Lord where you said you'd be in the midst of us Lord and we just invite you into this place Laura this morning we open up our hearts father we don't hold anything back father Lord we just open up our hearts unto you Lord asking you to to move in this morning lawyers we make room for you Father Lord you take the highest place and have the preeminence this day we just thank you Lord for being such a blessing to us in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen you can be seated anyway I'm making room for the word this woman the Bible says she was a great woman amen they had fields they had a nice farm they had some type of wealth you know but one thing about it though is that when the word started passing by that she continually saw this man she knew there's a holy man so she offered up bread and he came in he would speak about what he was going the work of the Lord that he was on the hero they was the prophet and then the Prophet never really knows exactly what he's going to be doing from day to day but just as the spirit moves him he goes and does the spirit calls him to do so as the spirit will be calling the Prophet to go from here to there you have passed by this place continually amen so as as this woman kept seeing the Word of God on its way about his father's business as she said how can I be a blessing to the Word of God amen how can I be a blessing to the vessel that is holding the Word of God for our day amen how can I be a blessing to to make it just a little bit of assistance what can I do to make sure that the Word of God for this day has everything that it has need of to go wherever it needs to go amen so so she thought about what she could do what could possibly be done what would be the best thing to do is she thought you know if he's weary upon the journey if he's hungry you know we'll feed him I said you know let's just make a little place in our house a little room in our house so that when the word of god is passing by that he won't just stop and eat and go on but that the word of god might stop and stay for a while that's blessing amen not just the word of god but the anointed prophet of the Lord amen because when the word and the anointing get together and now we got the word the word is sitting on on bookshelves all over this country gathering dust amen amen and it's not doing anything for those people on Newt on who those bookshelves is sitting why is that they made room for the physical book but they haven't made room for the manifestation by the Holy Spirit of living gut amen that's why the most powerful book is ever written that has been flooded this entire country and is sitting on bookshelves all over this country that's why it's not having its effect amen because they made room for the physical book but they didn't make room for the spirit that could make this book come alive amen that could pull up the events out of history Amen suits so that you yourself can become living in Bible days again amen that's that's one thing I really drew me to this message is when I've you know looking for those Bible days and you know I heard that it was you know they said in the newspapers back in the 50s you know we're living Bible days have returned to the earth Bible days are here again amen you know when they saw the ministry of brother Branham on old ax and all the the miracles and the phenomena and the dead were raised the the sick were healed and all those things going on and and as and as that phenomena I was seen inspire the people to say we are seeing the things that were written in this book now coming to pass in our own day and it got the people excited yeah you got me excited amen why because I enjoy see not just this physical book but I like to see this book in action amen that's what I'm here for I really like to see my god on display I like to see him when he comes in in power hey I like to see it when he comes in and changes a situation I like to see a win when God can reach out his hand and take someone who's sick and heal him amen you know I don't know you know one of the most blessed thing you know when when I come into a church or someone comes up to me and says you know brother you you prayed for me last week and you know what in over a week I was healed or whatever eye problem I brought up it was delivering out what did that it was not me it's not that I had any power Amen it's not that it's just that God has has placed in the body of Christ the ability to bring requests up unto the Lord Amen when that request goes up unto the Lord God makes intercession for us based upon our confession amen and he reaches down and changes the situation here on the earth Amen to make whatever the situation is here on the earth match what it should be up in the heavens that's what our God does hey man I will I love I love to hear the testimonies a man that I just ever time we pray for someone here I just I expect that there's gonna be a testimony coming actually that's just the way I believe hey you should be the same way hey that's not for the minister s for the body of Christ amen to expect that when their prayer goes up to the altar where the blood of Christ is and when Christ makes intercession for you based upon your confession then you know something is going to come to pass hey man so this woman she made room for the Word of God and I think about it as they as they took the house and they added on that little place you know they put the hole in the wall or however they did it and they made that little room on the side and and they made a bed and they put the bed in there and they made a little stool and then they made a little table a man they put them in there and then they placed on the table a lampstand so he could have light so he could be comfortable amen they made a place where the Word of God the Prophet could be comfortable and so as as is that now look now look about it one of the first times that room was used the the Prophet came by the house and he goes into the house and now the house has changed there's now an additional room there and they say and she goes and she shows him this room he says this room is dedicated to you into your ministry I have made room in my house for you and for your ministry he walks into that room and and he lays down and she goes about her business about her day and as he's laying there he's sinking my lord I pray you would bless this woman Amen Lord I pray you'd bless this family for the things that they have done for making me comfortable Laurel I pray you bless this family Lord I don't know what she has Nita but Laura I just pray you and bless her a man and he's sitting there communion he's laying and the Bible says he was laying on the bed there that all sudden he he calls for her come here what's he doing the Lord has shown him she has a need so now the word once it's invited into the house and now our room has been made for the word in this house and as the word is staying there and remaining there remember it's not just that the word comes by and then leaves but now the word has come by in an estate the prophet has stayed he didn't just pass some grab some bread and left but the word came in and he stayed amen so as the word stayed there all of a sudden a thought came to the prophets mind this woman has a neat this woman has a neat he went and he talked to her until he found out what that need was and immediately God gave him permission to announce that that need will be taken care of she I need to have a baby and God gave her her need you know she would have lived without the baby you know she could have gotten by without having a child you know they had plenty they were comfortable they were living a comfortable life but there was this a desire inside of her heart that was according to the Word of God and she had been desire upon her heart and when the word came and stayed in her house that the Word of God through the Prophet answered back according to the desire of her heart my what a blessing they made room for the word made room for the word amen let's turn over to John chapter one the Baptist's here we'll start with John chapter 1 the 29th verse it says the next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him and saith behold the lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world I wouldn't love him standing there wouldn't you this is he of whom I said after me is cometh a man which is preferred before me for he was before me and I knew him not but that he should be made manifest to Israel therefore I am come baptizing with water and John bear record saying I saw the Spirit descend from heaven like a dove and it abode upon him so John the Prophet is testifying I saw the Spirit of God now this is the same spirit that created the heavens and the earth the same spirit that brooded in the back in the beginning I saw that spirit that spirit descending down from heaven like a dove and it abode upon this man it stayed there amen the spirit came down upon this man and it stayed there and I'm here to bear witness of him amen then he goes on to the next verse and and I knew him not but he that sent me he said when I saw this man I didn't know but I saw the spirit descending upon' now I get to verse 33 I knew him not but he the one that sent me to baptize with water that same one said unto me upon whom you shall see the spirit descending and remaining on him the same is he that baptizes with the Holy Ghost and I saw and I bear record that this is the son of God amen so so so so John said that the man of the very voice the very one that sent me to go baptize with water they sent me to go prepare the way for the Messiah that same one told me now one of these days you're gonna see the Spirit of God descending upon a man amen and when he descends he's gonna as a remain there amen and when you see that that man will be the one that baptizes with the Holy Ghost so John was going along and he sees us Mary says I didn't know him but all of a sudden I saw the Holy Ghost descending like a dove from the earth and I watched it and I said well that's just what that man that's just what the voice told me amen and when he went and he landed upon the head of Jesus and the Holy Spirit went hid there it stayed and remained still there amen it's still there that same spirit that created the heavens and the earth the same sphere that all power is in the hands of that spirit amen amen he can create he created this world out of nothing amen he can do anything he wants to amen he brewed it over the darkness amen back in the beginning and said this world ought not to be in this condition and so the Holy Spirit got to be brooding and said it shouldn't be in this condition so the spirit started planting seeds it started bringing up the earth it started making the place of the world a nice decent place to live so that we could enjoy it who did that spirit did that and now this same spirit is being seen coming down you know you know Israel needed that spirit amen they were a little they were really lacking it a man had been hundreds of years since they had a prophet amen they were living in bondage underneath the Roman system amen they their there their whole worship system was a dry terrible mess amen they they were they were doing all the sacrifices but they couldn't seem to obey the word their zeal was gone and all they were doing was just living according to the dry word and they couldn't see this word be made manifest in their lives so it was just a dry gospel to them amen and they had turned their religion into just a denominational mess so here comes what was it now religion had become in the same condition that the world was back in the beginning they meant the world in the beginning was dark and his void is formless it wasn't doing anything wasn't producing anything wasn't making thing'll it wasn't making anything alive it was dark it was void now religion the religion of Judaism had done the same thing Amen the religion of the Jews had become dark it was without for without void it wasn't doing anything it wasn't making anything live it wasn't making anything alive it was a dead religion so now with the same spirit that back gave life back in the beginning is now coming back now here to Jerusalem a man and that spirit had a messenger sent before him and that messenger said upon whom you see the Holy Spirit descending like a dove and remaining there that's the same one that is now going to go and select people to be depositories of this holy spirit that created the heavens and the earth this is the one that will baptize with the Holy Ghost so now we're in a good position we've identified the one that's going to baptize with the Holy Ghost and the world wasn't a need to be baptized with the Holy Ghost because let me tell you every time the Holy Ghost comes it brings life that's why the Holy Spirit comes he is the Tree of Life from the beginning and he has life to give I come that you might have life and have it more abundantly why why he said because the whole the life giver was on the inside of him he was the life giver amen I am come that you might have life and have it more abundantly amen amen so when John saw that Holy Spirit coming down he identified her right away this is the same this is he that baptized us with the Holy Ghost and I saw him bear record that this is the Son of God amen how did we get to this point let's go back let's go back over to Luke chapter one as we know this was a this is a blessed event they meant weird the word have was identified the Holy Ghost had been identified and it was here it was on the earth and it was ready to baptize with the Holy Ghost though the word had returned to the earth again how did we get to this point Luke chapter 1 verse 26 and the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee named Nazareth to a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph of the house of David and the Virgin's name was Mary an angel came in unto her and said hail thou art highly favoured and the Lord is with thee blessed art thou among women and when she saw him she was trouble at his saying and casts in her mind what manner of salutation this should be and the angel said unto her fear not Mary for thou hast found favor with God and behold thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son and shall call his name Jesus he shall be great and he shall be called the son of the highest and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David and he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever and of his kingdom there shall be no end amen amen and then we get down to verse 38 it says and Mary said Behold the handmaid of the Lord be it unto me according to thy word and the angel departed from her why the angel depart from her Amen this is when the angel decided to leave why the angel decide to leave at that point because as soon as she said Lord I believe Lord be it unto meet Lord that's nothing but the truth Lord be done to me according to thy word they eat is like that's it amen the work is done amen the Holy Spirit has selected the woman amen I've brought the message to the woman the messenger Gabriel came to the woman amen and when she heard the message the message went into her ears it came across the field of her mind and she had what a virgin not just a virgin womb well she had a virgin mind amen now this is important amen now look what had Mary done Mary had made room for the word she may not have realized that she did it but she had done it she had made room for the word she made room for what she had reserved her womb was reserved for the pattern of the word a meant her her mind was reserved to trust only in what the word set she knew the scriptures amen her heart had been prepared amen she she had kept her heart from the world of the things of the world amen and she was prepared she had kept herself through and through and that's why she was highly favored among women amen and so when the word came to her and the word was preached to her and the word came into the field of her mind she said yes that is the truth let it be unto me according to the Word of God just according to the word and that word as soon as she said that the word dropped down from her mind down into her heart I wanted to do it gave room for the Holy Spirit to place his word down in her womb and Jesus Christ began growing inside her womb why because she received the word she believed the word and she said yes and amen to the word that's the angel left because he knew the word had been preached and placed where to be amen amen and behold thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son and shall call his name Jesus he shall be great he should be called the son of the highest Laure God shall give unto him the throne of his father David he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever and of his kingdom there shall be no end that means he's still reigning somewhere amen this king is still around somewhere he still he's he is still on the throne he is still raining as king he still has power to make things happen according to his kingdoms sake that's why John the Baptist and Jesus both went preaching the kingdom of heaven the kingdom of heaven is coming unto you the kingdom of heaven is coming into you and that kingdom is still here now as we look around it at the newspapers we don't necessarily see the kingdom where he was we look around to the to the civilization that we have here we don't necessarily see the kingdom Amen when we look to the denominational churches and and the religion that we have today we don't necessarily see the kingdom but let me tell you the kingdom has a place that has been prepared for it to be it's of the ink the Bible says of the increase of his kingdom there shall be no it Amen that means that kingdoms going to increase and it's been increasing since the day that Jesus Christ was here of the increase of his kingdom there shall be no and that means it's still increasing amen where is it increasing everywhere where room is given to it amen everywhere where room is given to the word that kingdom comes makes itself home makes itself manifest and there it increases amen remember they when they built the the temple back in the beginning that they there was never a sound of a hammer heard there there was no sound of a tool heard on the site because they did all that work off-site and then they brought the piece in prepared and fit it together fit it together fit it together you know one of these days in a moment and twinkling of an eye we're gonna be changed amen and we're gonna go up and we're going to find out that the kingdom was increasing the whole time the kingdom was being built the whole time amen everywhere the where room was made for the kingdom to grow it grew amen and that's how the judgment is gonna be Amen why because people will be judged by whether they allowed room for the kingdom to grow or whether they refused the word of the Messiah amen Bruce what did the word do when it came John says this is he does baptizing with the Holy Ghost so Holy Ghost came and anointed the King Jesus Christ now that King is looking for subjects and what does he do he's baptizing them in the Holy Ghost and what happens when they're baptized with the Holy Ghost they began growing up into the kingdom they're being told they're being shaped they're being formed into that which will be brought up in one moment in the twinkling of an eye and set in this place same n and then what happens that same City John said I saw the city adorned as a bride descending from God out of heaven Amen shaped like a pyramid descending from God what happened the bride was prepared here on the earth as where all the noise takes place as where all the trouble takes place those were all the trials and a fairy furnace takes place amen but what are we doing were being prepared jesus said I go to prepare a place for you maybe we just didn't realize that he's preparing us a minute he's going to prepare a place he has a spot serve for us and we have to fit into that spot that means we have to be a certain shape a certain condition amen and that's why the Holy Spirit moves upon your life that's why the Holy Spirit convicts you when you do wrong that's why the Holy Spirit leads you to do this and to do that to get experience amen why because the Holy Spirit wants you to be in a certain shape a certain condition to have certain fruits on display amen certain fruits on display in your life so that when the rapture comes that you fit into the condition that you were God for ordained for you to fit in well when you resist the Holy Ghost you're rejecting the very one that is trying to shape you to prepare a place for you you're not making room for the Word of God amen let's turn over to mark chapter 11 they're that angel told Mary that he will rule as a king over the house of Jacob the increase of his kingdom there will be no end amen as his kingdom will continually grow a man so mark chapter 11 you read the first verse it says and when they meet they came nigh unto Jerusalem and when they came 9 to Jerusalem unto Beth Beth phage and Bethany at the Mount of Olives he sent forth two of his disciples we're gonna go forward to verse five here a second but what is going on right here is Jesus is coming back to Jerusalem amen the word is coming back to Jerusalem he made a full tour through all of Judea they meant through the house of Jacob he went to the Samaritans he went oh and he just was coming back now from Jericho and what did he do he was expressing that the kingdom of heaven is coming back to you amen preaching the kingdom of God preaching the kingdom of heaven a man now the the Jesus Christ the King is coming back to Jerusalem and as he enters what what to see if there's room for him there amen now let's go to verse 5 disciples into the city at verses 2 through 4 there told him to go and get a colt a donkey find him and bring him to the city so that Jesus can write in on the city on the donkey verse 5 says and certain of them stood there said to them what do you seen this Colt this donkey and they said to him even as Jesus had commanded and they let them go and they brought the Colt to Jesus and they cast their garments on him and he set on him and many spread their garments in the way and others cut down branches off the trees and strewed them in the way and they went before and they and they that followed cried saying Hosanna blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord blessed is the kingdom of our Father David and that cometh in the name of the Lord hosanna in the highest and Jesus entered into Jerusalem and into the temple and watch this and when he looked around upon all things and when he had looked around about upon all things and now the Eventide was come the who he went out unto Bethany with the twelve what just happened here Jesus came he entered into the city he was worshipped he entered and he looks around in turns into the temple he goes down to the city he looks around he looks upon all things and then when the evening comes he leaves the city and goes back to Bethany the word came but the word did not remain amen and while the word was there what'd he do he looked on all things that's what Jesus does amen the word came he entered into the very heart of Jerusalem into the very temple itself and he looked upon all things but then when the evening came he turned around and went back out to Bethany no matter how much they worship how much they praise him no matter all that it's still the word left amen remember you know it's not too far from here that that uh just not to me verses away to where where this is the disciples a few chapters down they say oh look at all these buildings look at all this he had already gone in beforehand and examined all things and he looked at them as they are praising the buildings he says I tell you the truth not one stone of these buildings or remain upon another what happened he looked he entered into the heart of Jerusalem there was no room for him there he left was a judgement was pronounced upon that City they rejected the word amen no matter how much they praise the word the word was still rejected he looked upon all things you know Jesus does the same thing when he enters into your heart amen he came to baptize us with the Holy Ghost he came to us to initiate us into his kingdom to cause us to be sons and daughters of God amen he enters into the very heart of us and he looks around in all things have you prepared room for the word amen does the word have room in your life to thrive to live to move and have its bean amen or does it just come and look around and find out there is no room here for me to stay remember God doesn't share a mint he might come he'll look around but then he'll just if he's not welcome it'll just pass on by amen and then jesus said this there will not be one stone remaining upon another why because they would not receive the word amen the same thing happens to - to an individual when when the gospel comes to pass across your heart and you have an opportunity to make room for the word in your heart and you see the word says repent be baptized in the name of Lord Jesus Christ and you shall be saved you say well I don't know if I want to do that I don't know if I don't want to repent because if I repent I would have to repent of this or of this I don't want to have to this or this up so therefore I'm not going to repent because I don't have to give this or this up they meant what are you doing then the word just passes right on by Amen when you when you say well I don't want the Holy Spirit to come upon me because I don't know what the Lord will lead me to do and you and you sir stand off from the Holy Spirit then the word just passes right on by why because you didn't make room for the Holy Spirit amen no matter how much you come to church no matter how much you take down the palm leaves and wave them around and say Hosanna Hosanna unto the highest Amen but Jesus looked at those turning out those Pharisees there watching all that and he said until you say blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord you'll never see me again Amen why because the word came but the word was not listened to amen amen I was I was Matthew 23 where he said you shall not he said verse 37 he said o Jerusalem Jerusalem thou that killest the prophets and stonest them which are sent unto you how often I would have gathered thy children together even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings and you would not behold your house is left unto you desolate for I say unto you ye shall not see me henceforth until you shall say blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord amen amen what happens when you say blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord you're receiving the word that has preached to you and making room for it in your heart to do all that is told unto you to do Amen that's what happens when you say blessed is he that cometh in the name of Lord you're gonna receive all the word that has preached unto you and say yes and amen to it amen let's turn over to John chapter 20 so Mary she received the word well soon as the word was pretty sure she received it she said yes name into it it dropped into her heart and continually groped from there and when the same thing happens to us well that's why what what we do we keep our heart pure or keep our heart clean keep our heart ready why because you don't know when Jesus is gonna come by I mean you got to be ready make room for the Holy Spirit to act in your life amen we got to do that every day yeah make room for the Holy Spirit every day to act in her life remember the whole river when we read their backing second kings that when they made the room for the Prophet that the Prophet came and this time it said of just leaving right away after eating he went into the room and he laid down and now on the inner chamber of their house the word was resting amen the same thing happens to us when we take time to read our Bibles we take time to pray we take time to met apply it meditate upon the word that the word doesn't just come by our place and leave and now the word is resting we can stare upon our minds and when that word when we're meditating and that word is on our minds and we say yes that's nothing but the truth and then the word drops down and becomes act amen remember the testimony brother Branham had of a sister Hattie right where she said that is nothing but the truth what happened the word came into her mind of a testimony of something that God had done amen and as soon as she heard she heard that word she could thought well that's kind of neat and just past somebody and that word would have went in her mind and then just left right after it amen but well she took and when the Prophet brother Branham took that and he said ty gave of the testimony ancient into her mind she says that is nothing but the truth that that word dropped down into her heart amen I wanted to do all sudden the Prophet brother Branham he's sitting there he's resting at her table and all of a sudden the angel comes and says give her whatever she desires as a second Kings being reacted upon the earth again so that which happened in the Old Testament it also has happened in the New Testament now has also happened in our day what kind of a day are we living in what kind of opportunities do we have on a day-by-day basis to listen to the word now let me tell you right now if I want to listen to the voice of Elijah I don't have a tape I could go play you know if I want to listen to the voice of of John the Baptist or of Elijah you know I don't have any of their sermons of course a few of them are written down here in the Bible a member I don't actually have any of their sermons recorded where I go and listen to their voice but here in this state we have a man upon who testified that the same spirit of Elijah that was on Elijah Elijah Elijah John the Baptist has now come and enter on to him and we have an opportunity to listen to that message to listen to that voice that's a blessed kind of means and what do you do what do you want you know some of the things you hear and there I never get tired of hearing those healing lines it's a reminder to me here in our day God has testified I am the same yesterday today and forever I have not changed I still remain the same of the increase of his kingdom there is no end he is still here a same Holy Ghost that John the Baptist said he this is he who has come to baptize with the Holy Ghost I saw the Spirit coming and landed upon him I remained upon him and now because I have seen that token I am here to testify that this is the Messiah the Holy Spirit is here and I wanted to do that Messiah came he went to Jerusalem Jerusalem wouldn't receive him so he left Jerusalem with his twelve went out to Bethany and not too long after that him and the those 12 and 120 women were in an upper room and the Holy Spirit came and descended upon them like tongues of fire and it remained and of the increase of that Kingdom it has not ended yet and it's continuing and continuing and continuing and we all have a grand opportunity to be that same city to make room for the word in our hearts to have the same Holy Ghost descend upon us so that as the Holy Spirit descended upon Christ and remained upon Christ now the Holy Spirit descends upon us and remains on us if you would just make room for him amen that's what happens and when the root and when the word is resting in your heart when the word is worshiped and the word is given the preeminence and the word is resting upon your heart and and and then what does it do it says ask whatever you will that's what he said in John in John 14 in John 15 in John 16 he said ask what you will ask what you will what do you want ask whatever you desire and it shall be done unto you I meant three times in three chapters he said whatever you ask ask seek knock it'll be given unto you and why why because when the word comes and abides in you amen you can have what you want I told you a turn at John 20 verse 19 it says then the same day evening is after the crucifixion after the resurrection being the first day of the week when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews came Jesus stood in the midst and said unto them peace be unto you and when he has so said he showed unto them his hands and his side and then were the disciples glad when they saw the Lord they meant then jesus said unto them peace be unto you as my father has sent me even so send I you and when he had said this he breathed on them and saith unto them receive ye the Holy Ghost what whosoever sins he remit they are remitted unto them and whosoever sins you retain they are retained I think about it he Jesus entered into Jerusalem or Jerusalem would receive him he left Jerusalem and how here gathered into this room are those that would receive him so he turns in to the room and he says peace beyond you the same Jesus is here this morning amen amen it says the same thing until you peace be unto you I'm here to enter into your heart I'm here to enter in to fill you with the Holy Ghost amen if you just make room for the word make room for Christ he said peace be unto you even as the father has sent me how did the father sent him because the word went into a willing heart of Mary Jesus was sent to the earth through a willing heart that would receive the word even as the father sent me now so I send you why you have willing hearts you've received the word now the same word as in me is now implanted into you amen and it's gonna bear the evidence and he breathed on them and said I'm sending you receive ye the Holy Ghost and now the same spirit that descended upon Christ and remain is now again descend upon these and remain I shall be with you I'll be in you until the end of the world Amen whosoever sins you remit they are emitted unto them and whosoever sins you retain they retain now why do you say that when the Holy Spirit comes it comes to judge sin amen it comes to make things right what is common there is a pattern in heaven that is what the earth is supposed to look like there is a pattern in heaven that is what you and I are supposed to look like amen our names were written upon the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world and that's not just the the English alphabet of our names that is who we are what we're supposed to be was written upon the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world and that's reading there's write written standing there in heaven Jesus says don't rejoice because the Devils are subject unto you but rather rejoice because your names are written on the Lamb's Book of Life up in heaven amen and so what your name is written up there it's a picture that God took of you amen is what you're supposed to look like this is what you're supposed to be and the Holy Ghost has come upon this earth a man to make you your body your spirit your soul match what is written up in the heavens amen so he breathed on them receive ye the Holy Ghost and so what the Holy Ghost will do unto you so in the when when when the earth was in darkness the Holy Spirit came and brooded upon it turned it into a Garden of Eden amen when Judaism had gone into darkness the Holy Spirit came and brooded upon it and gave them a promise of everlasting Messiah now all the Gentile ages has become darkness amen and all the tables are full of vomit amen amen every every house is as an unclean cage of every unclean and hateful bird amen every church every denomination a cage of an unclean hateful bird but the Holy Spirit has come upon this darkness a man is brooding over the people crying come out of her my people that you might be not be partakers of her sins I have a pattern of you that was written up in the heavens and I have come down the Holy Spirit come here in this day it's the word he wants you to make room for him in your heart so that you might be changed to look like what was written upon the Lamb's Book of Life in heaven amen and that life I have come that you might have life and have it more abundantly won't you make room for me in your heart amen love me adore me amen amen make room for the word in your heart amen so that the work and come and change you and to being what God wrote about you before the foundation of the world amen and Mary believed the word and the Word was made manifest on the inside of her amen amen it came out as a testimony that she believed the word amen so is it to us all every one of us have an opportunity to let the word pass on by or to open up our hearts and say yes Lord come in Lord come into my heart and let your holy spirit do whatever he sees fit to do change me mold me make me shake me into your image amen he again in Christ says and Paul said and he gave us power to become sons and daughters of God amen amen the rest of the world they might not see it they might not know it they may not understand it amen it's a mystery unto them amen but the Bride of Christ will be a mystery to the world why because of the the Spirit has been given unto us we are being changed day by day and one day in a moment and a twinkling eye those that made room for Christ in their hearts we changed taken up into glory and put into that position of the pyramid where God has reserved a place for them and you were shaped here on the earth they they a malicious tan as the father sent me so send I you and he breathed on them receive II the Holy Ghost amen amen the head of the church is the word and if the church won't listen to the word and the church becomes paralyzed and cannot act my brother Brandon said that every true church will write a book of acts behind it amen and that's what we're here to do is write a book of Acts behind us not that we write it but we write it every time we give a testimony of something that the Holy Ghost has done in our lives how did the Holy Ghost do that room was made for him and as a Holy Ghost lays there upon the bed that you made for him something enters into his mind and the Holy Ghost is inspired ask what should ever you will it'll be done unto you whatever what's the desire of your heart with what burning desire is there because when you when you when you cleanse your heart in your mind of all the filthiness of this world and the gospel begins to to have room to manifest and to grow and to be enlightened but in your mind in your heart then all of a sudden your desires change so you can be about your father's business amen and when your heart has changed to be about your father's business then all of a sudden desires start cropping up wow I wish I could do this for the Gospels sake I wish I could just I could do this it's according to the word I wish you O Lord I need a job so I can support my family Lord I need I need to I need this I wish my children love the Lord more Lord I wish that so-and-so would come to Christ I wish that that so-and-so could just be healed of this this constant problem that they have I would Laura so it's those mind has been put into prison and I see the chains upon my brother and my sister lord I just pray that somehow they'd be delivered and as the Holy Spirit is resting there upon your heart all sudden it moves lights flesh and the spirit gives utterance it says whatever you want whatever you desire it'll be even as you say what you made room for the word in your heart that's what Christ when he comes into a heart that's we're prepared that is how important it is that we stay virgins to the Word of God amen the word came to a Virgin Mary amen the word came to Eve but was not received because she wasn't a virgin unto the word amen and so when she gave birth she gave birth unto death because she wasn't a virgin under the word but Mary had an opportunity she kept her heart to the word alone and she said be it unto me Lord just according to your word amen and it was granted her the desires of her heart and so now the same opportunity we have an opportunity to make room for the word in our hearts amen I think my desires prayer if you don't have that room in your heart and I challenge you to come up here and we'll pray with you amen amen experience of the Holy Ghost coming down and baptizing you and remaining upon you to where you can honestly tell me without lying to my face that I know that the Holy Spirit has come upon me and it has remained upon me and just the same as Jesus was sitting to the earth that I have been sitting on the earth if that's not your testimony then you need to be filled with the Holy Ghost Christ came to fill us with this Holy Ghost if you would just make room for him in your heart amen then I would challenge you if you don't have that testimony then you come up right here to this altar and we will pray with you as our brother Isaac comes amen god bless you Saints eight be more like him hate me more like you make me more like you Jesus make me more like give me the sphere with love and make me more like Oh make me more like [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] holy spirit'
