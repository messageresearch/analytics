we stand we didn't come here to see each other neither did we come here to judge one another we came Amen to worship God often time we come to church and we look around and we see things that we may not like but the truth of the matter is it's not about you looking around it's about Christ because if we all would stand in the presence of God we all would be guilty without the grace of God without the blood of Jesus Christ where would we be and I don't know about you but I know every day is Resurrection day especially for me because I get up and when I get up in the morning that's my resurrection in this life but there is coming another resurrection by dying at night and waking up in the morning it's just a shadow and type of that great day that we're getting ready to experience we appreciate the Lord Jesus and I'm gonna ask you to turn with me to revelations the third chapter I say these things because I'm so glad that my salvation is not hindered upon people who whether they like me or not but one thing I do know is that God requires us to love everybody even on enemies and that is not just something that you say with your mouth it is a true expression I was telling somebody just yesterday I said even the dog knows when you fake they have enough discernment to know when somebody likes them or not so does cats so we being in the image and likeness of God we know as we turn to revelations to the third chapter these two scriptures may seeing as far from each other as the left and the right but by God's grace I trust he give us the grace to minister the thought of God this morning revelations the third chapter beginning at the 18th verse many of us are aware of this particular scripture I counseled thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou may it be rich and white raiment that thou may it be clothed and that the shame of that nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve that thou may it see as many as i love i rebuke let's go back up to the 17th verses where i really wanted to read forgive me because they'll say it i am rich and increased with Goods and have need of nothing and knowest not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked now jump to the 19th verse as many as i love i rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore and repent john the first chapter st. john the first chapter I think we may have it just a little bit too chilly in here please when you when you're too cold you can't worship like it would normally would worship when the temperature is just right John 1 beginning at the first verse in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was the light of men and the light shine it in darkness and the darkness comprehended it not heavenly father we come before you lord jesus as humbly as we know how we come to celebrate that great day in history where the resurrection of our Lord changed time changed calendars and changed many hearts we pray Lord God that you would bless this morning in a special way give us grace to minister your thoughts in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated it has so many things running through my mind in the time of working on this message I have been probably have too many notes and I try my best not to use them all because we might be here to the next service but by God's grace I I thought about Easter and I thought about the resurrection and I thought about what it was all about and you and I you and I know that by God's grace that Easter was to hell memorial the world called it Easter we call it the resurrection sunday is our day of worship before Sunday Saturday was the Jewish day of rest call it the Sabbath now we know that the true Sabbath is the Holy Spirit in your soul that's where we come to a place of rest even Paul say labor to enter into his rest so entering into the rest of God doesn't come so easy ly as some people think to accept the Lord Jesus Christ as your personal Savior it's just the beginning of your journey as as a baby being born must grow and mature my thought on this morning would just be sent around one word origin where did we originate from how did we get here and where are we going because we realized that everything has a beginning and an ending except God God is Elohim he is the self existing one often time people in this world don't nowhere to go because they don't know where they came from science has manipulated and control the minds of the people for hundreds of years now maybe longer some of us or some people believe that we originated from some pali water tadpole some NGO bought back as far as a rock well in one way there right but the rock is not a natural rock is a spiritual rock you and i are living in the worst age ever and this age is actually called satan's eden but my god and your God is a God of contrasts the only way that God could show that he's light he had to allow darkness to come the only way that God could show that he was successful and that he's mighty he had to bring failure it's God's teaching rule if I would say this world is but you and I must understand that we who have eternal life always did have it because eternal life is something that has no beginning and in order to have eternal life you have had to be in the mind of God before creation and how day we are living in a time of ancestry everybody want to know where they started and the simple answer is in the book of Genesis oh we can take you all the way back to Adam and Eve they men where God created man and before the old before Adam and Eve was created we can take you back what we call the logos and the Bible said in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning III all that one statement the same was in the beginning that same was in the beginning not just working with Christ but working with you with working with me the same it has to be the same and the thought Bible tells us that all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made this thing is a great mystery and I'm coming to something in just a bit I believe Jarret said or something this morning in my office I don't even know whether he realized what he was saying to me but it's like God is a come he's come a come back he's coming back he's bringing himself back into the place where he first thought of himself what he thought about himself one thing I know about him is that in his existence he thought about you and me but he had to read he had to bring a plan on the scene and you and I we celebrate Easter we celebrate the restoration resurrection of Jesus Christ and we have no idea sometimes what is all about all we see sometime as a man on the cross and crying out Father forgive them for they know not that what they do but that was it was greater than what the eyes could behold at that time this plan that God had for Christ was planned before the foundation of the world and this plan of redemption was no mistake God saw the fall of man you know when Adam and Eve fell God didn't say oh my what happened no but Lucifer amen was designed to be the enemy of the of God God knew he would be you know must understand that we have been forced to live in this civilization of what they call civilization and America is supposed to be a supreme I guess on the top of the line civilization what a joke because in this civilization this one that we're living in is just an illusion it looks real but it's not real everything is fake we're living in an age of fake news fake people fake Christians fake something that that looks real when it's not only because people don't know where they come from but when you can understand where you come from you can understand where you're going we realize a man that we're living amen in a time when when the church world and I'm jumping here for a moment just to get where I need to go we're living in a church world where the Bible says are calling the revelations they increase with good look at the massive buildings look at the massive people look at the clothing design of this and all that it's an appearance of being godly but it's fake because after Sunday they transform back into what they really are but the original life is eternal the original night cannot change it remains the same no matter what conditions may change the original life the original life the original life remains the same for an example the Robin that God created from the beginning he's still the Robin he still for thousands of years builds his house the same way he built it he hasn't modernized it he's not he doesn't have a split-level or a mansion still simple because he's not the fallen creature but there's something about man even in his fallen states he projects the image of his creator because he is but he's searching steel you know I looked and they had this Android and this Endor was a girl and they were talking with her and you know and they were saying you know scientists has made this Android look so real and so human it's amazing how they deny God but they want them be a creator like he is science a menace has come to a place where they're so close but they'll never be able to put their hands on life because life doesn't come by science life doesn't come by education you could be the dumbest man in the world and be the smartest man in the world because you choose Christ now I to say this by God's grace amen this this thing that when I'm working with the origin you and I have fallen with fallen creatures from where we come from and because of sin amen it barricaded the way back home even though men heard the call of God they could never return home did y'all know that thousands of years men would die and they will be locked up in the prison called paradise and paradise was nice but paradise wasn't home y'all know what I'm saying it's like going to a hotel on a vacation you enjoyed it but that hotel is not home and you and I know there's no place like home yet God put something in us to thirst for him something amen amen that animals don't have but one thing about it goddess is is it's beautiful in its in its ways I always tell somebody I said one thing about those little animals there in India and y'all have heard the story when an earthquake was getting ready to come they moved away from the walls but because of our intelligence we like Oh get me a telescope and let me see what's going on out here and it usually causes our death we call that curiosity and foolishness but you and I must realize amen that in this origin something is taking place right now and you and I must understand they meant that this life that Jesus I'm jumping all over the place but nevertheless I want you to understand that if there's an origin there's a return there's a return because eternal life is a circle oh it's like this it has no beginning nor ending it never stops and because we are part of eternal we have a journey and this journey Amen drop this down for a while in what we call time but when we die we get back into the loop we get arrived back in the place we fell from this is what calorie was all about Calvary was the restoration it came to restore he meant the Fallen creation of God it wasn't to put on a show or anything that people's hello you know it was it was it was the greatest and yet the saddest thing I ever God don't need your pity God needs repentance because amen it was because of our sins Jesus had to die yeah it was God's plan he was a lamb before the foundation of the world we're living in an intellectual age where people think they're so smart that they can outsmart God hallelujah they dabbling all into science thinking that they can you know jump through a wormhole into eternal life they're looking for a new world because they know this one is coming it's falling apart but yet there's another people that's looking for a new world but then it does world is really not new it's just we haven't been there in a long time we are living in a day of scoffers we're living in the day of non-believers we're living in the days of with the ballot bra but where the Word of God says amen we're living in a day of knowing we're living in the day of Sodom we're living in the day of intellectual Giants man's achievements in personalities or impersonation scuse me and you and I must understand that if we're not careful we can become ourselves an impersonation of Christianity hello because the person in Christianity is not a religion it's not a cult it's not a large it's not a group of people and then branded Baptist Methodist Presbyterian message that's not Christianity Christianity is when you have been born again when Christ is living only inside of you that's what Christianity is Christianity is not having the ability to see a prophet and to know what a property is that's not Christianity Christianity is when you have met Jesus Christ for yourself as somebody help me here until a man meets Jesus Christ he is insane because a man insanity is described as doing the same thing over and over and over again and expecting a different result i'ma go around in this circle and one of these old days amen ah I'll be set free not as long as you go in that circle when you and I when we understand Amen that our minds our thinking our thoughts that have been put on us because we are fallen individuals hmm I'm trying to hurry but it's not working you and I must understand that we are living in an age of perversion y'all heard me you know so many people they get quiet when you start using the word perversion because some people don't think they are but they are every last one of us that were born into this world were born perverted because we were not born according to the original plan of God somebody help me you know was to be born a meant by the spoken word hallelujah but we came by way of a woman is that right David described he said in sin did my mother conceive me and I was shapen in iniquity that means when I knew to do good I was going to do wrong anyway that's the kind of a person you and I came oh look at that cute angel that little baby cutie cutie and that little baby Amen is working you cry when it ain't hungry right cries when it's not wet sometime and just want you to hold it hallelujah oh you must understand that baby knows how to lie without you teaching it but because it was born with the fallen nature you don't have to teach it these evil things it is what it is hallelujah and as it was born to lie there is another flip there's another side of the court there must be a people that is born not to lie Oh somebody help me here the only thing that's true and faithful in this age is the word hmm it is the only thing that will not fail you the Bible said the grass withers and the flowers fade away but the word of the Lord shall stand I know this is the long I'm trying to get there in all of this God let a word to his disciples let not your heart be troubled you see God want to bring peace to the heart he wants to bring confidence to you and me you and I so that we can understand he meant that what he did on Calvary is enough it's not the grace of God plus it's not the blood of Jesus plus hallelujah no man can add a cubit to a statue hallelujah but in order to go back to where you come from you must have a revelation and jesus said upon this rock I'll build my church and the gates of Hell shall not prevail you're never and I'm gonna be preaching a little bit on the rapture this morning you'll never understand the rapture or even believe that you are are you worthy to take a rapture if you don't know where you come from you understand me when you understand amen where you come from then you understand there's a ship there's something waiting on me to take me back to where I came from there is not one Christian that can truly be satisfied living here no matter how wealthy God makes you or how prosperous and how much you achieve in a true Christian he's longing for heaven he's longing to return to that kind of a being that he failed from his role when I get to heaven I'm oh tall I'm gonna tell Eve well I had why she did better they don't need no more you can't blame e it's you now you have to make the choice is that right please Adam and Eve didn't have an example before them but you and I we have an example of what disobedience can make calls on you but it can that the tragedies of being disobedient the horror that comes with disobedience as I said in an earlier message you had two trees in that garden and in that garden you had the Tree of Life there's only one Tree of Life and then you had the tree of the knowledge of good and evil that was an impersonator of life hello that tree was an impersonator of life because he said oh you shall not surely die if you eat up this tree you're gonna live but God said if you eat of this tree you should die see them say you have a choice on whether you will take the tree of life over the tree of knowledge of good and evil I'm coming because I'm working with this origin here did you know that when God gives you the Holy Ghost he gives you his person that's God in you so the person said well I got the Holy Ghost and you're not living holy something's wrong we're gonna have battles because of this but the inward man knows right from wrong you know what people don't understand they say well let me ask you a question when Jesus was praying and he said father I was at this cup pass from me who he was he was praying to his father that's what he said who else could he have prayed to it was his father who was ill him who was the Holy Spirit Jesus Christ was the son of God by the natural man but in him dwelt the father hello him yah hear me the Bible said he had the fullness of Godhead bodily in him so when he prayed guess what the Bible said when you and I don't know how to pray the Holy Spirit will make intercessions for you who is the Holy Spirit he is the father hello so not only does the Holy Spirit comes down and he prays through you but he answers his prayers Oh somebody help me hallelujah so you must understand that if the Holy if you are praying in the spirit that's God praying that right Redemption by judgment he said he don't only make prayers but he answers prayers he is the one who answers his own prayer so if you prayed in the Holy Spirit why do you doubt that God will answer your prayer God prays it through you so that he can't answer it because he's the only one that can pray perfectly is that right I got it you've got it and because of Calvary we all have it listen Jesus didn't come just to save of the world about said he came into the world to save the world but he know he knew that all the world would not be saved he knew people would not accept Christianity and in this in this age America is almost complete apostasy he said neither pray I for these alone but for them also which shall believe on me through their word that they may all be one now if he prayed that how can i how can anything stop it when he pray they all I was a part of the thing and all may be one as thou father art in me I envy that they may also be one in us that the world may believe that thou has sent me and the glory which thou gave with me I have given them that they be one even as we are one hmm so that knocks out the scientific way thought on oneness when the Baptist the method is a Presbyterian the Catholic the message and whoever they all think oh we could be one because he prayed that we be one now that's not the one that God was talking about the Bible said by one spirit are we baptized into one body that's the oneness of God help me somebody it is given to you and I and I'm gonna go ahead and preach down it is given to you and I to know the mysteries hello mysteries that are unveiled to you is given to you by God by grace not because you are knit but because God chose to give it to you you can't buy it you came flat Oh God is that Alright you can fast fifty days if it was possible it says Lord I won't I'm fasting that that that I'll sing I'll be able to sing you know and I have a have a voice that I could really shake the world everything God's will you Engel fasting today's and all it is you die more than likely because if it's not the will of God to have you seen you will not because the gifts of God and the gifts and calling of God is well thought without repentance God called you before you ever thought about repenting ah because you and I was in the mind of God Oh help me Jesus I'm trying to get to something here so you and I must understand that when when Adam and he's sin I'm jumping and the Adam could not say Eve and Eve could not save Adam it took God to do it think about it the very tree they refused to eat of had to come to their rescue and that's how it is Jesus must come to our rescue the one who saved the world the one who died for us amen came to save us hallelujah in spite of our rebellion in that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us Satan had is trapped because death kept us in the grave nobody at that time wanted to go to the grave nobody knew what it was all about Jove even wrote and says I've seen it I've seen flowers come back I've seen trees come back I've seen everything come back but man where is he what is this thing about man lord I don't understand this thing and y'all know the word but the word came amen and it did what it showed Joe there was a day coming because of a day before Joe where were you when the sons of God shouted for joy when the sons of God even saw the lamb slain when the sons of God saw the lamp take the book where were you why because this same lamb that we're now talking about Jesus Christ the one who died and rose again he was a Lamb of God John said he was the Lamb of God but you got to understand this lamp this was no mistake this was no no coincident God planned it this way before the foundation of the world you can't appreciate love until you realize how bad you are you understand me Adam consent and Eve I love you hello honey I love you you're the apple of my eye but when II committed adultery which he failed to the serpent now was his love proving see God is love but it was the fog it was the fall of man God used it to show how you and me how much he loved us oh it's the truth Israel he loved God he he and God loves Israel but when Israel back slid on God when Israel stopped serving God you know what God said I'll never forget you I have read you on the palms of my hand you're mine and you will ever be mine is that right hallelujah and though we may be scattered everywhere Gentiles Jude we're everywhere in the book of Malachi the Word of God came says I will make my jewels up you see I'm saying if God made you a ruby if God made you a diamond if God made your sapphire whatever you are you might be covered with dirt but you steal the jewels of God it is okay even Paul seeing the conditions of man you know we're living in the worst days you don't as I said earlier this age is considered Satan's Eden for men who may not understand Satan even is the age in which Satan has become God is that right look on your TV sets a man is everywhere where death is being glorified monsters zombies whatever a man is being glorified and you've never seen anything really about Jesus anymore and then when you do look at something that has Jesus on it it's just an imitation it's just a fake hello it's the truth ha real original life is hard to find the original seed of God is hard to find but there there we have a hope that's beyond the grave and we have live set six thousands of years amen we have seen men rise and fall men rise and fall kingdoms rise and fall and I don't know why people think that America is going to be great again we're already fallen hello we were the last nation everybody else has fallen England fell is that right Russia fell where did they fall when God brought the revival to them and they rejected it where did America when God brought the revival to her and she rejected it that right in the 50s and then when God was pouring out his spirit eyes of the blind being open dead raised amen people in wheelchairs at you know being healed God even went to the White House and healed a senator put it right in their face and Senator Upshaw had been what in a wheelchair for about 60 years God healed him it's the White House and around and around that gift but they didn't America should have rallied around the noting of God if they had we would have been a millennium by now but we chose our rock and roll we chose our parties we chose everything that was against the original nature of God woo and we're going to pay for it people think it's just all America I'm telling you folks you better wake up and smell the coffee it's not just America that's wicked it's the whole world but we haven't hope it's been written all along in the book when things get bad God knows how to make a way of escape is that right the Bible said with all of the temptation God has already made a way of escape is that right oh come on somebody you look at this thing and you said well brothers what are you saying Paul wrote about he said but brother I would not you be ignorant brethren concerning them that asleep we die because of sin we go to sleep brother but before then you know all of those who die in Christ they just go to sleep for long rest those of those who are tired and want to rest one of those days you're gonna arrest me well if the Lord tarry but you and I must realize because of this message because of our understanding of Malachi 4 God sent us a word of comfort to know that those of us who die we die unto the and when we leave this place there's another place Paul said Amen in the Word of God he said if this earthly Tabernacle be dissolved I have one waiting for me hoping I'd die like Joel said though the skinned ones eat up my flesh yet in my flesh I will see God because on that day this coming a day like I read a scripture says yeah Friday is here but sunday is coming hallelujah and you and I must realize it meant that though we suffer in this life we gonna reign one day thank like that song say this world is not my home I'm just a passing through hallelujah for if we believe that Jesus Christ died and rose again even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him oh but they're dead no sir they're just in another dimension hallelujah they're living better now than they were here huh because they have a different body hallelujah come on somebody now the Bible says and tells us a man that there are those who escaped death did you know that I mean the first man that we know a record that escaped death was anak that's what Christ came for that's why Jesus came that he might undo death he would conquer death he would take away the effects of death I hope my English ain't too bad for you this morning but I get excited I'm sorry and you and I must realize hey man that the effects of death strikes everybody that's born in this dimension did you know that oh I keep saying Lord restore me so I can jog some more but you see when you get older your joints don't work as good as they used to Oh y'all young people y'all don't even know what I'm talking about y'all can jump up and get down and I have to creep up sometime but then I think the Lord I made it it's a different thing because on the inside of you you still young you still vibrant you feel the same way you always felt on the inside but this Tabernacle here because of CN is drying up the grass wither and the flowers fade away hallelujah is that right but Paul said I have a hope you're gonna sleep you're gonna die at the Lord tarry you goin to the grave hallelujah but you're not there when you die you go with him a lot of people don't want to believe life after death but I know it's true there was a time I was really really sick in my marriage when we were young and you know and I I something happened and I had an out-of-body experience you don't have to believe it but I did and I was able to look and I was able to see through where my wife was I saw her come in the room and everything else and she didn't know what was going on but my spirit or whatever was above looking and I was look out what brought me back down but it did nevertheless I have experienced it myself I didn't go to heaven I was just there you get sick enough something's gonna happen but nevertheless let's move on I know it's real even if if I had never had the experience I know it's real we're living in a time what we call the end time y'all know that the Bible said as it was in the days of Noah as it was in the days of Sodom on Sodom that's when the son of man shall come right and the son of man is a prophet with a word so you and I must understand we're living in that day because the message has come right and Paul said the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of an archangel and with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first hallelujah and we know when God opened up those seals amen all three were done in that time it is a progression now for revelation 10-7 came with a message and that message a man was behold the bridegroom cometh hey that's why we know that the rapture is soon here Wow because it's already in making people that oh I'll be change in the moment of a twinkle of an eye but let me say it like this the change must be all now you must be changing like like the Word of God says from glory to glory to glory hallelujah it is okay let me just move on because I my time is going out but let's just go there was a man called Lazarus is that right and Lazarus was a friend of Jesus I read this little book they claim it's a little got history in it it was called the Prince of the house of David and it talks about the death of Lazarus and they said that Lazarus when he was so dead the stench was unbearable and said that when they marry him roll the stone away the stench feel the air so much so to some passed out God did it if that was so he wanted all of the spectators to know Lazarus is not only dead but he was rotting and so we realized by God's grace that here was Jesus and everybody saying oh oh kidding this thing be I know this man opened the eyes of the bride I know he he healed the sick I know he did a lot of things but this man has been dead for days see Jesus didn't do that to play he wasn't there y'all people come see what I can do it wasn't him doing it hallelujah it was God in him y'all believe that because when his sister's my lambs and sisters came to their Lord know that Lazarus is sick come quickly he couldn't move on the moon news came back to him again Lord don't you know lavell is getting worse like he's gonna die Jesus couldn't move because he was a man but he was a God man and he was the son of man not a but V somebody help me here but he had to wait on the anointing he had to wait on the spirit he said except my father and my father don't show me I don't do nothing I'm not doing nothing I'm not moving I can do nothing except the father show me is that right but then after laughs that had been dead for days then God says now it's your time hallelujah now that was pre crucifixion before Calvary hallelujah and here was Jesus and then he told he goes right to the to Mary Martha takes him right to the to the two he tells him you go roll away the stone that's what God is telling you this morning you roll the way to stone because you and your heart and your mind is thinking it's impossible but I want you to know Mary Martha I am the resurrection I am the life hallelujah if there is going to be anything that's going to happen it's coming by me that's why it's so important to have Jesus on the scene you can't do nothing it ain't your prayers that answer that that that that data make things happen it's a God in you praying hallelujah and what happens I still today don't know how Barry and Martha rolled away that stone that was a huge stone I've been to Israel it was a huge stone heavy stone it took more than one Centurion to roll it but somehow they managed it and the Bible don't say how they did it but they were all the way here let me tell you something faith sometimes come easy and sometimes faith you got to push something out of the way and I think that's what we call unbelief lord help my unbelief yo let me tell y'all something most of us believe that God can heal most of us believe that God Amen could open the eyes of the blind some of us will even believe that God can raise the dead but you know what we're having unbelief in transformation that God can really change me into that we're having a hard time believing that the same Holy Spirit that created you that ordained you one out of a million to be born in this earthly dimension can change your character into his that's our problem because we have been Amen the way we've been for so long and God said I can give you knowledge I can give you tumors I can give you patience I can give you brotherly kindness and I can produce divine loving you but we struggle he's the same creator with all hallelujah God did this God did this but what about you what about the change in you because understand that when God called Lazarus from the dead he was dead his nose was something magan's was everywhere stitch fill the air and God transformed I don't know where the magaz went that's where they came from hallelujah all I know is when Lazarus came forth a man is shook the world of that day and he came out hopping more than likely because his feet was bound and he said loosed the man and let him go see that's the thing you are bound by religion grave clothes and you need the same voice to loose you in this message is the only thing that can loose you hallelujah then that voice was a scream you know the Bible said that his voice wouldn't even be heard in the streets but that day when Jesus went to last to me says Lazarus come forth hallelujah the prophet god said if he had said if he hadn't specified the name Amen everybody would have got up I believe it hallelujah you and I must understand I love this because it's a Shirley type of the resurrection because the next time you see Lazar he's sitting at the table eating and dining with Jesus Enoch the Bible said was translated he wasn't found he was able to walk with God and believe God so much that one day he changed from auto-tuned immortality and still today nobody don't have a record of where Enoch is I know he's at because there was a greater relative resurrection that did come see that what I'm trying to say if you could see what Calvary did rob you so oh you think Kaveri is just for your just heal oh god I thank you for healing me no oh lord I just thank you for making me feel good in god I'm so glad I got joy it's more than that it's a restoration is God taking his fallen creation and bringing it back to him hallelujah so oh oh the devil thought he steal God's jewels but God says I'm a greater thief I'll come like like a thief in the night and I'm gonna take my Jews away from you hallelujah is that right so you and I must understand that Enoch was translated nobody enthuse well I don't believe that Enoch built the pyramid you don't have to because God has revealed to us that only a supernatural element could have built that because even man can't do it today I've been to Egypt and I've seen those used stone some bigger than this longer than this room huge I kill taller than I am it'll take more than a crane it'll take more than ten thousand men with ropes and how they gonna get it up so high because they had technology that we did not and still don't have why are we trying to reach the moon they they were trying to reach heaven is that right their technology was so advanced God said let me go down and confuse him because if I don't confuse them their build their way up to heaven so they had a dimensional machine or whatever they had but God had to stop him because he knew man was intelligent he made him in His image and his likeness and when you get men on one Accord he can accomplish anything he wants to accomplish hallelujah now we had also Elijah who was translated who's raptured or take away on a fiery chariot however you want to say it but he left his heart and went to another dimension guess what he's still living 400 years later hover 800 have it was here he was talking to Jesus on Mount Transfiguration oh I'm so glad that these mysteries have been unfolded to us the greatest mystery that God has given me is my origin where I came from hallelujah oh come on somebody ha come on you said what do you mean that's why Jesus could say in the word my sheep hears my voice and a stranger they will not follow huh he was their side disciples themselves here they were Amen Pharisees Sadducees whatever they were remember when Jesus they come follow me they drop everything Peter fisherman quit his job and follow Jesus y'all give him why because he was God's sheep and then Jesus comes alone after he gathers them together and he tells them I knew you and you were with me before the foundation of the world somebody help me here so you said oh brother once I listen I can't help to be but what I am just like you cannot have to be but what you are if you are son and daughter of God you also be so happy if you're thirsty for more God you ought to be so happy don't be ashamed to be a Christian be to be a Christian be glad be joyous it is the world who's in bad shape not you when we get to a place where we don't understand this is harvest y'all understand what harvest is that's when the combine comes together comes and gather up all the wheat or whatever the harvest is it bundles it or it puts it in a place where it can be used and that's what God is getting that's what God is doing right now all right a man from the message Revelation he said you will recall that I mentioned at the beginning of this message that the book this book we are studying is the actual revelation of Jesus himself in the church and his works in the future ages then I mentioned that it takes the Holy Spirit to give us revelation or we will fail to get it you understand me that's why the bout said he will appear to those who are looking if you're not looking for us coming you won't see it if you don't love his appearance Amen that happened in 1963 you won't go you gotta love it I know am I crazy I must bring this out I'm not even done where I want to be in this life magazine and now y'all heard my testimony y'all remember this book some of y'all to know it Life magazine maybe some of you never seen it before but in this book when God began to move in America for the last time when America had rejected God in 1956 1957 she turned her back on God Christianity began to fall respect for God began to decline why because God had been rejected and so therefore he ba was written in this magazine in May 17 God did a great thing seven angels descended from heaven and this it made it made a cloud now you might not know think aha ring cloud C 1963 what was happening God was revealing the seven seals that's how far we are in time 1963 what year is it now in 1948 Israel became a nation and God said Amen that that generation will not pass until they see the coming of the Lord I'm trying to tell you how late he is because God don't deal with the Jews and the Gentiles at the same time but in this rain cloud I remember Amen as a young boy I don't know what grade I was in round 63 64 I was outside playing football with some of the guys and a white man came into my in my neighborhood and and and he had this book in his hand I'd never seen the book before but I remember it was a Life magazine and he opened the book to all three of us and he says can you see Jesus he said the Lord is soon to come now this may be a little heavy for you but it's true and he showed me this cloud and he turned it and when he turned it I was able to see the face of the Lord as a boy didn't know nothing about this message didn't know nothing about God send Elijah and all that didn't know that and I began to thank God I something I don't know what I did I said but I can see it I can see it the other two guys couldn't that white man had on a white suit and a black tie I'll never forget it he closed the book when I said I could see it he told me he said the Lord is soon to come the Lord is soon to come that's what he said he didn't say nothing he didn't say rapture he said the Lord is soon to come that I could recall and he closed the book and he left like I said it's branded my mind because in a black neighborhood in that day only the milkman the insurance man or something important man who was known by the neighborhood if they were white they were the only ones allowed y'all understand me so it he didn't look like he was afraid or anything he closed the book and I didn't see this this book again until I came into the message now because of technology men have been able to do things with this picture that at that time we weren't able to see so what they did they were able to magnify and this is what you get now you say what brother look that's that's something as you you believe in that I do with all my heart what was it it was the appearing God's appearing hello to the world that the world was soon to end that his coming was imminent and it was closer then than ever before when those seven seals were loosed because no man was worthy only Christ could and the Prophet God said he didn't see it and understand himself he said but when the angel told him to turn it right he saw it can you see it now this this the Bible says a man he would have on a wig a white wig that's the white wig this is the wig of judgment and in this white wig the Bible said he will come down and he put one left on the seat and one on right foot on the earth and one on the seat and he would declare that time would be no more that means time has run out for me the world is getting ready for total destruction but God mercy and grace was still there he still sent a message said whosoever will let him come he brought us an interest into the design nature of God that we will be preaching this and let me tell you something because we preached this we are scold we'll look down upon hallelujah but the Bible said he's never left himself without a witness Enoch was one man and it had to be millions in the world but he was the only one that was raptured Noah was one of eight eight Souls and nobody wanted to him believe his message but it did stop the flood hallelujah and as you've heard me say Amen everybody and noise day became a believer as they descended into hell hello and Jesus is that right that was the first seat Enoch was translated he went up no escape the judgment of God by going over hm Moses escape the judgment of God they're coming out she's not enough to come out of Egypt you got to make preparation for heaven huh oh lord have mercy I'm I don't never knows but my point is we are going back to being what we used to be hallelujah because of sin we we left we left we didn't we came here without our theophany you know what the theophany is as a word body a body that knows everything is that right and Jesus told his disciples you know all things and I used to scratch my head I said how do they know all things because he was working with the word he worked with their origin he was working where they came from he understood them he knew them you say what do you mean even though they were on earth their theophanies were in heaven is that right Jesus the house the son of man can be standing right here talking to you and yet he's in heaven how can brother Isaac be sitting right here and God said but he's in seven how can you be sitting right here but yet in hell is that right the Bible said we are now setting in heavenly places in Christ Jesus ooh when you hear the call of God as I said that Trump came down and that Trump means what the gathering of the people that right Trump also means war and all those things but it was the feast of the trumpet was blown and when they blew those trumpets it was gathering the people to a feast the voice the shout of a trumpet amen it brings us to what the feast the changing of the body and the only way that you can get to this feast you must have a change of the body is that right well then we call it the Lord's Supper we caught in the web we actually call it the wedding supper hey everybody are you looking forward to that if you got eternal life you were in God before there ever was a world did you know that Jeremiah I knew you that's when he said to Jeremiah I called you I made you a prophet before you even form into your mother's womb I was you were there oh come on somebody he said a brother would what what do you say I asked you a question if God would have called to take a rapture this morning can you truly say you would have made it yeah we know it's going to happen around a time like this somewhere in the spring because spring is a day a season of resurrection and when we have people and then they come to a place and then they said what brothers what are you saying let me tell you something you know how Enoch got to heaven flying on the wings of grace it wasn't his works that got him there it was the mercy and grace of God but if you don't believe in the mercy the grace of God Oh Lord I'm such a sinner I don't know what I'm gonna do oh my god I didn't do right oh yes confessional sense but he's faithful and just to forgive you of your sins and to cleanse you from all your unrighteousness you never bathe in regret when that Catholics you don't have to do penton's hallelujah oh come on somebody he's the Alpha and Omega and I'm saying let me say it this way and I know I've gone a long ways you just got one service Oh your mom's going to give me a little bit more me few more minutes here's the Alpha and excuse me he's the Alpha and the Omega he's the beginning and the end he's the first and the last whatever he did yesterday is what he's doing today I know that was bad you know he must realize by God's grace that when God does something he can't change his way of doing it if there's another way of doing it it takes away from his perfection hmm let me get back to Christ I'm gonna finish it off there's no way I can preach at all but the Bible said one day the voice of God every person that's dead will hear his voice that means the sinners and the saint but there is a voice that's that only those who would take a resurrection now can hear it did you know that everybody can hear it the world can't hear it but there are designated people a special class of people that can hear the voice of the age hallelujah everybody didn't follow Luther everybody didn't follow Wesley everybody didn't go Pentecostal only those who are predestinated to do it everybody can follow Malachi 4 huh it's only those who predestinated to do it and if your producer needed to do is follow it with all of your hearts hallelujah because this whole body this whole model will put on immortality hallelujah how you know cuz I see the change come in I can see God moving me from glory to glory brother Brooks do you make mistakes yeah I do and as long as I'm in this flesh I'm gonna make mistakes huh but in this soul of mine the Bible said if you have a willing mind God to do good God counted right hallelujah in one of these old days that Capstone's Jesus is that right the Bible said he is the cornerstone but Israel rejected the cornerstone but Peter on the day of Pentecost said but God has taken that same cornerstone and made it a headstone hallelujah he is the Alpha the corner and he's the head the Omega is that right and the bow said he is faithful and true y'all look love the Lord he said but he listened there's only one God and the father of all who is above all and through all and in you are is that right but you and I must understand a man that God is doing such a great thing with us because he bind every devil for us he said I bind the devil no he bound the devil and because the devil is bound you can bind him is that right the Bible said he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto me so you got to understand you say what presents uh oh you know what's going on let me tell you all something when God did this work through a little Kentucky and nobody wanted to hear him they rejected him many people may wonder what that picture is you know he said that's brother Branham and when I see that picture I don't see brother family I see the light above his head the light above his head it was the first supernatural sign a picture that this America had ever caught on camera he talked about it hello that's the same pillar fire that led the children of Israel hallelujah oh come on somebody ain't no worshipping of a man over here but the Christ Jesus that he produced no man I don't care all robbers Billy Graham and all of the great ministers of this hour could not come paired themselves to what God did through this man he was a humble man he never boasts himself he never produced man did that people did that and that was the working of the devil is that right to block the way it's true it's true how can we put him in a position that he didn't want to be in but we did it I said we but let me move on it was Jesus he came to declare he could do nothing oh he didn't he never healed a person he never raised the dead it was Christ in him showing us he was the wave she that there was more to come we can't just look at the man it's you now it's your day the move is on the bride you the ones who God wants to use to raise the dead you the one that God wills to use to open the eyes of the bride you're the one that God wants to use it bring good tidings to tell his people amen there's a rapture on we can't preach Moses message Joshua is on the scene but we can't forget what Moses preached because God said to Joshua don't you forget what Moses taught you you understand me but you and I we are in another fall of this message and until you come to recognize who you are yes lord I you know too many of us are we too grounded I'm gonna move done I had to cut it short because I want you to understand I ain't done I'm gonna keep preaching on this until you get it my thing is this you and I must understand that we are in after what we call the rapture age the whole world can't see that they can't see it but you little group of people he said fear not little flock it is the father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom and you and I are here amen because God sent a messenger for running himself like he did John the Baptist for running Jesus Christ is that right and now we in a position that we know that to be and we realized amen now that we can see the world Laodicea rich increase with good blind and make it and don't know it is that right that's how they are they really think they're gonna go sweeping through the city and they don't understand they're moving through the council of churches there's ru 90 time that y'all know that God is uniting all his people by supernatural verses right and he's uniting the world council of churches by organizations and denominationalism because that is the mark of the beast and people don't want to believe it but it's so and the sad part about it is when if they're not out of those systems before the rapture take place they will have received the mark because you can only receive the mark of God which is the Holy Spirit or the mark of the beast hello you understand me so I want you to understand you know church can save you no group of people can save you only Jesus Christ himself you love the Lord we conjugate as believe us as a body and every one of us differ in something but everything's one thing that we supposed to be agreeing on and that is having the Holy Ghost you love the Lord oh it was so much I want to bring let me just close with this because I've gone long enough Ephesians 1 says blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who have blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ according as he have chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will and everybody all I am adopted let me tell you something until your body is completely changed until you have a glorified body on you understand me it is that the rapture it is at the translation when you and I receive our completion then we'll preach for thirty to forty days what closing when Jesus raised from the dead when he when he died is that right y'all heard the shout you hear the message he is the message he is the message and when he said Father forgive them for they know not what they do when he said that guess what something happened and when he died something happened those that were in the grave heard his voice read the scripture the Bible said there was a great earthquake and you and I know we're looking for the great earthquake because around that time is when the resurrection takes place hmm when everything is chaotic that's when people won't even miss you they don't think you've been consumed hallelujah and don't you know even scientists says California is almost ready to go Oh y'all think I'm crazy maybe but I know that is true California will sink you said oh but what all those people my son is out there my brother's out there my cousin's out there but you know what God never destroyed the righteous with the wicked if he's righteous gotta get him out of there but if he's not it ain't my business somehow he'll it's the truth is the truth don't you realize they meant God Tosa alot Abraham says listen the angel said - until they we could get loud out there you we can't destroy the city see so let me go back to the am jumping but anyway when he Jesus descended into hell did y'all know that did you know that Jesus descended into hell the Bob said he went into the lower regions he went into that region to do it to preach to the souls that were in prison those souls who rejected him when he was in Noah's day discipline Jesus wasn't there yes he was that wasn't Noah preaching that was God in nor and when they rejected nor they rejected Jesus because all nor did was preach the word and then that was the first incident and then the second Exodus amen was when when Moses preached right now understand there is that Jesus had an exodus to what was he doing calling him out of the organized religion Jesus looked like a look call or what we define the cult hello y'all got quiet but he did here was this man amen with 12 disciples and all of them then left their jobs and left their homes and left everything and everything else following Jesus and Jesus said foxes have holes and birds have nests but the Son of man has no place to lay his head but I'm following you Jesus no matter what it takes stripped me from everything I'm following Jesus not a man not organization not even religion I'm following Jesus and when Jesus died the Bible said he went into the region of the loss and he preached through the souls in prison and you know what no doubt he more than likely said why did not you believe Noah Noah was my seed my man of righteousness and you fail to believe him did he say repent no there was no altar call he left those souls screaming in hell but when he left there the Bible said he went to paradise there in paradise you had Abraham and Sarah guess what you even had a thief on the cross they were all there in paradise hallelujah and I can see Jesus that they began to market coming up now they're coming up because now you got to realize that when Jesus rose he went to heaven amen he carried a band with him he cared all those who had died under that Old Covenant with him Oh lift up your gates ye everlasting doors and be lifted up and let the King of glory come in that angels at the gate says who is this King of glory I love that I wish they replay that for me when I get there he said the Lord mighty in battle what it was a battle he whooped the devil he defeated death hell and the grave hallelujah he went to hell for you took the keys out of the route of Satan's and shut the door back on him rose up and when he rolled everybody that died in God rose with him yeah read your Bible it says that even those who weren't believer Saucer oh that look like Abraham then look like Sarah hallelujah why because the dead in Cairo's appeared to many hello people saw them and still didn't believe if they were to believe Pentecost would have been more than 120 people but you know what that's the way it is now people can see miracles people can see signs and wonders and they still don't believe but anyway that was the resurrection see Jesus had to rise first in order for them to rise that right he rose he went amen and so you and I must understand that Jesus bridged the gap between time and eternity he made a way for us to get back home had not had been for Calvary we would have never been able to go back to where we came from and now the life of God is in us pulling us like a magnet back to himself you love the Lord I'm a minister on this for a little while but I cut it short today I didn't get where I really wanted to be but I'm gonna tell you something you got to know who you are I know I just didn't coming to this world to go to hell and God didn't make me a Christian and send me to hell he could have left me out there in the club if he wanted to but one thing I ask God for in 1977 I said to God and you know I saw something that was supernatural and I said to the Lord I says Lord whatever you do don't let me miss the rapture I brought that back to his attention just the other day I says Lord whatever you do don't let me miss the rapture and I know God is going to keep his promises he brought me that's when I had my eyes were open to this because I saw so much failure I saw so much you're not that done I'm not saying that that's saying I'm not saying that we don't have problems and we don't fail sometimes but I just saw too much I was a god I was a bro I was a brother that believe in the supernatural of God I've seen it in my mom and one of the things that I never liked it's when people would say well God don't mean that or that's not for our day when Hebrew says Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever he's a God that changed not and so you and I must understand you all of one you are either of the seed of God or you're not the soil only so to sees there's only two scenes the seed of God and the seed of the wicked one you have to determine who you are and I say it like this I am heaven bound and understand heaven ain't ain't my the resting place for me its resting place but it's not the final because after three and a half years we're coming back down here Oh God they'll be able to do a new heaven and a new earth come on somebody guess what y'all think I can shout now but y'all wait till they throw him in the lake of fire ha ha when they throw that Devon y'all might look up this the devil let's go no you gonna hear my voice you will hear me all that brother Brooks over there oh yeah you and I can't even imagine what its gonna be like when there is no trouble you know the Bible said in heaven to see it's like glass to see a glass you know why because the earth won't be wobbly no more you know why the why we have waves because the earth wobbles because of what the fall it staggers like a trumpet but in that day when everything is at peace the sea will be so crystal clear to be so calm it'll look like you can walk on it and guess what you can if you want to [Laughter] that's just how glorious what I'm trying to say is this civilization this is a dump the devil has made this world a dump stitch everywhere I was coming home amen you know I had to pick my wife up from Lima coming home on Friday I went down Friday morning came back Friday night long cry and some of the places I we passed through us at honey we must be in so and so cuz you could smell the stench but no one to get to heaven ooh there the flowers would be blooming the grass will be green you and I cannot even understand it we can't it's beyond but you know what I'm not going to heaven for the grass that's green grass the Prophet God said that his crown would be a new body and that's what I want see because that's the only thing that's giving me trouble right now is this old body anybody know what I'm talking about you call it the flesh that's what gives me trouble but in my soul my soul says Amen to every word surely we love the Lord there is a fountain filled with blood [Music] there is a fountain filled with blood amen [Music] amen [Music] [Music] he's dead there there [Music] these days [Music] rejoice to see [Music] [Music] though [Music] Wow my Oh [Music] Oh gosh [Music] yes my word [Music] [Music] we see [Music] [Music] [Music] spite me I saw this free iPhone has been my beady eye and so I [Music] and shine [Music] I shall be thick love I don't know whether if there's someone that desire prayer be glad to pray for you we just want to say by God's grace [Music] we need to leave here this morning asking God to reveal to us who we really are I wish I could bring a revival in this church but I can't it must be the people [Music] you must have a desire to move forward William Branham has done what he's come to do now you're on you got the ball I want to hear him say well done go listen to the messages your is your life worthy of the gospel if that doesn't call you to repent then I don't know where you because we have only one purpose here and that is to produce Jesus that's it we're here to produce Jesus to show a dying world that Jesus Christ is resurrected and he's living in us all Christians duties is to prove that Jesus lives doesn't matter where you get it you could get him on your knees you can get them in a barn you can get them in a pig stein you can get them in a church no matter where you get him he'll lead you right back to the same place God if it's the real Holy Ghost it cannot deny its word he cannot deny what he's doing in this day it will always be magnetized to it you understand me it's like when when when the disciples they meant he said or what baptism was you baptized under you know they saw John's disciples and they said we're barely John baptized unto repentance but you got to be baptized he said but it must be done in the name of the Lord Jesus or Jesus Christ did they get baptized and they did why because they wanted to be all word not some of it all all that was in God he poured it into Christ all that it was in Christ he put it into his bride his bride is not a faith we will leave out of here triumphantly not with our heads down not being defeated by Satan's either we are in a battle and he fought the battle for us that's what the Holy Ghost is given for amen that we might use Christ or Christ may use us to prove even in Satan's eater he is gone Jesus Christ is the more that I surrender the light the more oh the more control can harm myself live me and every day I surrender [Music] release my teeth patrol the molded I can humble myself [Music] and every day [Applause] No [Music] I love you
