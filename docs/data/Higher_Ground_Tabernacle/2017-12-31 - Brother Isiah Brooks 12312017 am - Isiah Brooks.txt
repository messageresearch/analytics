[Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] that's what we need hallelujah and God is willing to give it to every one of us Amen who want that divine love amen not some filial love but the agape in the god-given love the love that can only be given by God is the one that you can't fake it either it's real I like it I like the idea because I believe that everybody wants to be real halleluyah halleluyah as we stand please you know I I was thinking how so many of us are Christians and it's not just in this place we don't realize how important the Word of God is you know we should not be the people that just wait to come to church to read the Bible the Bible is a source that God has given to us and it is what we call our daily bread Bible in itself is so important to your spiritual growth without reading it you basically starving yourself spiritually and so I just thought I just Minister on I am the bread this morning because I think we need to know that this coming year we ought to be more dedicated to reading God's Word we say we love him but how can you love him and won't read his word I do understand a lot of people don't like reading but what you need to do is ask God to give you the grace to to love to read especially his word and if you don't if you don't want to do it that way ask God to give you an app so you can put the Bible on yo but my point the important thing is you need to hear it every day amen and that's me if I'm not reading I'm listening we're not listening I'm reading it's important even whether you know I think to myself even if I'm not getting it my subconscious is the man who's supposed to get it is getting it amen so I thank God for His grace and His mercy and I trust the Lord bless the students message Isaiah 40 we're gonna read the tenth and eleventh verse then we'll go through st. John 6 okay that's right we used to have some extra Bibles Isaiah 40 10 and 11 behold the Lord will come with strong hand and his arm shall rule for him behold his reward is with him and his work before him he shall feed his flock like a shepherd he should gather the Lambs with his arm and carry them in his bosom and shall gently lead those that are with young hallelujah st. John 6 we'll begin at the 44th verse I love that scripture ye shall feed his flock like a shepherd and a Good Shepherd always feeds his flock amen no man that can come to me except the Father which have sent me draw him and I will raise him up at the last day it is written in the prophets and they shall be all taught of God every man therefore that hath heard and have learned of the Father cometh unto me that's important that scripture and they shall be taught of God every man there forth that have heard and have learned of the Father cometh unto me not that any man have seen the father save he which is of God he hath seen the father verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me shall excuse me believe it on me hath everlasting life I am the that bread of life now you're gonna find out in some of the scriptures we talk about the bread of life but here Jesus as identifying himself with his own lips that he is I am that Bread of Life your father's did eat manna in the wilderness and are dated this is the bread which cometh down from heaven that a man may eat thereof and not die I am The Living bread which came down from heaven If any man eat of this bread he shall live forever and the bread that I will give is my flesh which I will give for the life of the world now he's really working it the Jews therefore strove among themselves saying how can this man give us his flesh to eat he calls a commotion a disturbance then jesus said unto them verily verily I say unto you except you eat this flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood ye have no life in you very important there whosoever eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood hath eternal life and I will raise him up at the last day for my flesh is meat indeed and my blood is drink indeed he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood dwelleth in me and I in him as a living father have sent me and I live by the father so he that eateth me even he shall live by me this is that bread which came down from heaven now how does your father's did eat manna and are dead he that eateth of this bread shall live for ever let us pray father we thank you for your grace thank you for your mercy we just pray Lord God this morning that you perfect will be done he'll dine on way Lord the father would give you the praise the glory and honor help us now Jesus that we will lure way all distractions out of our lives and father that we will focus this coming year Lord to learn more of you because you say take my yoke upon you and learn of me for I am meek and lowly in heart help us now take your great Shepherd in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated he is the great Shepherd amen now it's not too warm in here is it it is just tap down somebody yeah I'm already hot and I'm not even started yet haven't even started but I rather be too hot and then cool a little bit then to cook oh you know so we get a little bit more praise out of you when it's warm amen oh I can't move too fast when it's cold but you love the Lord I'm excited I'm excited because I see God doing things in my life and you ought to be excited too to see God doing things in your life now when we talk about bread we all know what that's like you know I know some people that just love bread bread is really good I like it too but I'm not like most people I can do without it but I do know some people they can't do without bread they gotta have bread and and it's okay because bread represent is a good thing we know about by God's grace that God has dealt with bread barley bread wheat French you know I'm saying and you know we must understand that God always liking himself as bread when we look about look at the scripture we find out that the bread I'm talking about it's not a natural greatest spiritual and we find out that Jesus is telling his disciples and all those who are listening who he really is now can you imagine you sitting in this group of people and Jesus is talking about the bread and he's talking about the manner because see a lot of the Pharisees and Sadducees they prompt this this this this speech that went on because they claimed that they were of Moses and of Abraham and and here was God coming down and he's telling them now you you you've got to follow me because I am that bread like Moses gave it in the wilderness now can you imagine their minds because being calm minded they could only see mana they can only see these little coriander seeds that they crushed and made me love flower out of and make bread that's all I can see but now you know because you got to understand he's now taking a tight and he's bringing it into reality that this was just a tight this is what when God was showing forth you know preparing the way for me and now he says now I am that bread and you know the thing that really gets me is that when Christ began to say your father's did eat manna in the wilderness and they are all dead now the Jews understood when he said dead he understood when he said they are all separated from God they did make it over and you think that that would have really caused a real stir and then he goes only said except you eat my flesh and drink my blood you have no life game you see you must eat the bleeding bloody word of the Son of Man and that's what this message is when we think about by God's grace Jesus is not working with ya you got to understand this congregation is calling and he's trying to give them something spiritual and now Jesus is saying if you're mine you're going to hear what I'm saying because my sheep hears my voice and a stranger they will not follow in other words they may not understand what I'm saying but they know what I'm saying is to truth see and he says now you say that you are of Abraham's Abraham is your father but he said in some places Abraham rejoiced to see my day and those just no snares he says now we know he got a devil cuz this man is not even over fifty years old see they even guess wrong but nevertheless amen they go on and I'd only get ahead of myself but the point is Jesus is trying like he always have tried to tell people I am yo get Gateway to life in other words if you're going to come to the invisible father you must come by me I am the visibility of God if you're going to see God you're gonna see him by mean if you're gonna have life you're gonna hit see him by me now see in that day they understood the importance of bread we got home consecrate it now right but in that day bread was a vital source of food for them it's amazing how they're telling us that wheat bread and barley bread and all these kind of brands now are no good for us when it's sustained Israel thank but God's bread in its original fall will always produce healthy things so we realized by God's grace and then he's he's telling us these things and he's trying to get us to see by God's grace that he is that bread of life now I want you to understand that even his disciples didn't fully understand what he was saying and there were times he had to just openly say what it really what he really was and he's standing getting right but at least those Devils saying wait a minute now and by hearing right are you trying to tell me that you and God are equal we gonna stone you but this is the important part I love this part jesus said in other words can you find any fault in me if you don't believe me for what I'm saying search my life my life will prove to you that I am not only the bread but there's no leavening in me that I have done everything God has told me to do right so he was like listen check it out search my background you'll find out that there's nothing hidden in my life I haven't done no sin you can't even find it there's not even one scripture in the law that can give me because I've done it there all right she they got mad at him because they knew right remember Amen when Nicodemus came to rabbi we know that thou art teacher from God we because we know no man can do these kind of miracles except God be with them so the crowd in itself had an idea even though they didn't want to accept him because perhaps he came from Nazareth and one case says can anything come good come out of Nazareth in other words with a wicked City and in the minds of you know you got to realize the Jews mindset mindset that that God is just so holy you know he could never be born you know in Nazareth come on live in Nazareth and he could never be born amen in a manger he could he be coming he's gonna come to the greatest stop organization there is he he'll come to the Pharisees and we'll blow the trumpet and here riding on a white horse or whatever the case may be but they had their all theology and because they had their own theology let me tell you something brother Aranda when he said and he preached that message God is revealed in simplicity and hidden in the same it's still the same if you look for God in this popped up thing you won't find him in God is among the lowly that's simple you find God in a place like this right I mean we don't have the stained-glass windows and all that you know we you know we we've just got what God has given us but it's in these kinds of places that's right even the prophet of God said if you want to look for God go looking for a storefront you might find him there see because God is in a simple way now how simple can you get when you liken yourself as bread and God comes along and he's saying listen and so father have sent me and I live by the father so he that eateth me even he should live by me now this is disturbing these people cause they have perhaps heard of cannibals and their minds like eat him this man is insane he not he's in hell only just eat me but drink my blood but you understand what he was doing he was purposely downsizing he was purposely shedding off the breed unbelievers and to make believers he was purposely and let me tell you something God will always bring a word if you taught if you own the line like that and God has warned you and warned you and warned you and warned you you know what God will do here bring a word that'll make you go he will purposely do it you think I'm crazy huh I lived when I lived in Lima Ohio there was a family Amen in it I don't call no names but this family you know was really giving me some trouble and they were bringing leavening in the church they were actually just not dressing right and doing right and the Holy Spirit said you preach this and they'll leave I preached it next Sunday they were gone I said brothers you should have done that I did not do it I was obedient because you got to understand why pastors have to be hard sometime because a little leavening with leaven the whole lump hello you don't believe that brother branham said that's what happened to the Pentecostal church they saw miss Kennedy and they all began to cut their hair and get that water head hairdo like Miss Kennedy why because some faster let the leavening in this is why when we take communion and I'm working with communion too this is why we take communion and the bread must be undone Lebanon it cannot have any kind of yeast or anything that is going to pump it up or alter it at all it must be simple right and you and I must understand Amen that this bread we're talking about comes from heaven I thought about this word and sometimes were preaching the way he want me to preach it when Jesus said man does not live by bread alone I thought wait a minute but he is the bread he's saying now he says in the scripture that you can't even live without him but he just told me he was the bread but he's not talking about a natural bread here because when he said but he lives by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God and I thought there it is because the Bible says in the beginning was the word the Word was with God and the Word was God hallelujah and I'm gonna read you some scripture jesus said he proceeded out of God hallelujah not only did he proceed of God but he became the very mouthpiece of God hallelujah this is why in the book of Revelation Jesus is called the Alpha and the Omega the a and is it or the Z hallelujah amen he is the beginning and he is the ending by him all things were made by him all things consist by him everything that is created was created by him I'm talking about this bread and this bread is so healthy because once you see that disparate ate if I if I had a little portion of of a little juice and you know we didn't know nothing about Jesus per se if I said this juice I know will not only transform you but change you back to your youth and would give them eternal life that's it but I've got only a small glass of it and it's mine I wonder how many of y'all will attack me before I you might not want to do it in front of everybody else but somebody would say if it's walking yeah it must work you know me all these gray hairs darling you know oh boy I got to get my hand on that right come on somebody you're not born again so you know how that nature is I got to get my hand on it you would do whatever you could do just to get a drop of it cuz that's all you need just a drop right and people could see that's how it is with God right just just gonna just get a drop I think about Lazarus you know I don't know what was in his mind but when that rich young ruler would would drop the crumbs from this table he understood those crowns was gonna sustain his life and that's the way I look at this world of goddesses Lord if you just gotta give me crumbs from this bread it will sustain my life hallelujah now we should oh brother this this bread is eternal and I love this because there's a story in the Word of God and st. Luke and you don't have to turn there but here's the disciples after it I'll be jumping back and forth after they came amen are their own the road of Annamayya and as they traveled the road in May as he comes visiting a stranger to them because remember Jesus Christ had been crucified and and and he was beaten to such a position Amen he did not even look human and so when they did I seen him his face his features was a mess perhaps there was no description that that they could give to you of him after that they had been he had been crucified but here's a young strong man walking with him but have had a hood on I don't know how he disguised himself but he began to walk with him brother and you know what I you know just putting it in our terms he probably just got up on him say well what's going on brothers you know and they looking at him like wait a minute are you coming from the same place I came from don't you know what just happened see you know you must understand how can I say it I like the way brother Jesse said even God praise hide and seek hallelujah and I like that because that is so true he hides himself in simplicity and he's revealed in the same right and God likes for you to seek out to him that's what about says seek me early and you will find me hallelujah but so God when God wants to hide he can walk right with you and you won't even know it's him that's why the Bible said be careful how you entertain strangers you could be entertaining angels unawares and so we find out by God's grace Amen that here they're on the road to Emmaus they all get down now watch this I'm gonna tell you something isn't it funny how you have Peter James and John thrown into jail while Jesus was living me uh excuse me and you know and then now they're excited they really excited because they know now he's living but but you find out that on the road to Emmaus these people are very sad brokenhearted I've lost my god in anyone standing in their minds or their hearts perhaps or with a mouse scuse me but in their minds and then they were discouraged and Jesus is faithful that God will not lose one he had called his disciples for a purpose because he was going to show them that he was really the Living bread huh now think about it how they must have been on the road to Emmaus thinking well you know that last supper we had was different even though he broke the bread and everything else something was going on because he began to tell us about the Son of Man being betrayed and all of these things and we didn't get it at the time but that bread he says now it was one bread and this is what I've been trying to tell us folks it's one bread one body one spirit this is why the prophet of God hated organization in denominationalism and if you're not careful you will form a nation around yourself but the body of Christ is not divided and you and I have no right to say who's got the Holy Ghost and who doesn't because you and I by God's grace some where we were before we came to this when I can remember giving my heart to the Lord at the age of 12 and I knew a change happened to me and I don't even know what I couldn't understand at all explain it from the age of 12 I could never hate anyone and I'm gonna tell you even then people did wicked things to me and I could never hate them that wasn't me I actually thought there was something wrong with me my daddy could hate why can't I hate but you see a change came into my life you said I don't believe that let me tell you something this is one experience no man can take for me when I was baptized in the name of the Father Son and Holy Ghost I came up out of that water and you know what God said to me I know it's his voice he said to me what is the name and I looked around bypass it and said nobody else and you know how they did it and those dignitary Baptist churches you know if you was poor and didn't have nothing you know your baptism was nothing but everybody that that money went down and I had to borrow in my robe like Jesus had to borrow his grave but you know I had the bar in my robe and you know you look at these people that had I watched everything oh this girl was oh it's wonderful it's wonderful but I had nobody to say wonderful to me but then God came along and says what is the name o my entire life God would always bring that back to me every now and again what is the name here I was a young man that had just come out of a not completed to college but I was out in Colorado came back home thirsting for God amen my friends had gotten saved and told me where to go to be where they went and you know I could remember the conversation before my mom died she told me about the baptism in the name of Lord Jesus Christ where to go well so all of these things became real I went up there it meant that long story short amen I ended up getting baptized but well while when I went to church I went up to the church not knowing I was late the church was over services were and here was the back door open while I'm going down this little inclined to go through the back I heard his father says be that baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ now you don't have to believe that or not but I could tell you what I know what it is to be a hypocrite and not even know it because while I was in the Baptist Church we would sing on televisions right I had a gospel group we we called ourselves what it was voice and faith or something but anyway we were seeing go to the door to the studio on Fridays practice you know feel you know show you do your show and then we go to the club afterwards not only hello you know Baptists can do that it's alright for them to do that you know so don't bother look at you as a hypocrite but God hmm and we went to the club we did our drinking and everything else in the whole time I'm feeling condemned because something took place in me at 12 and but I was always that kind of person that wanted to fit in so I would compromise but this time something started holding and catching and I was singing this song think God have been saying thank God have been saved you know he watched me through and through and may my heart brand new thank God of his Saint and I get home in the Lord say you hypocrite I [Music] didn't know what I didn't understand it I didn't even know what was going on in me but I was looking at everybody else oh it's true somehow members on the owner on the group would you bring them many bottles and everything and when they what we're gonna do this afterwards you know but I would be convicted you understand me I'm telling the story so you can understand and I wasn't in the message at that time but election was pulling on me see that's what polls all of the foolish virgins auto denomination is election that's what poor the bride out of denominationalism is election that's what poor the bride and whoever else out of the world election hallelujah listen God dealt with with John the Baptist when he was a child put him in the wilderness nobody knew who John was until he came stumping out of the wilderness declaring the gospel of Jesus Christ and who can tell John God ain't in dealing with you hallelujah he wasn't even a part of nobody's Church you understand me he is the bread of life and you say well well brother what happened so I go in there the pool was open brother siblings was right there and I said I come to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ well when I was going to church I didn't realize I was going to be baptized so God spoke to me I you don't have to believe this portion but I'm gonna tell you anyway I was baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ when I went down in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and I rose to come up oh my god and I know water baptism it's not regeneration but I'm gonna tell you something God stopped right then and there all that wickedness yummy when I woke up when I come out of that water lights were everywhere now you say life all I can tell you they were lights and I began to scream and holler look at all those lights y'all see nobody saw the lights but me didn't even know what they were at the time but anyway to make a long story short that went out this man got baptized and this happened happened happened happened but anyway I didn't know I kept going in my life but when it came to this message let me tell y'all something I gotta tell you this some of you may have never heard but my momma told me about this message even before she died and she said Junior don't you be don't you be discouraged you gonna go and God gonna save you you gonna be a preacher and she said you gonna be at that church when you get in that church there gonna be a hard time for you she said but whatever you do jr. don't be discouraged because God has a greater light coming when I came who my God when I came to this message God said to me now you know the greater light see so nobody can take it away from me but what I'm saying in this day is that message this message had been preached and we've been here we've had all kinds of great mysteries told to us but Paul warned us y'all know who Paul is he is the first angel the first prophet amen outside of Jesus himself to the Gentile church he was the messenger of the emphasis age he got the four brief clip blueprint from God and Paul had such an authority he said except you believe what I have preached If any man even if an angel preach something different put leavening to it let him be accursed Oh hallelujah so you and I must understand that William Branham when God brought Elisha in our day he kicked not God had to make him a prophet because he could not God could not afford if I want to say it like that he would not allow any other he couldn't do another reformer because the Reformers never did get it all straight hallelujah they just got their little portion at all but he needed someone that would bring the bread and get all the leavening out hallelujah that was his duty that's why amen the mysteries of predestination in the marriage and divorce enough all of these things had to come because God had to make sure that this message had no leavening that's why the probably God said preach it just like I preach it don't let it take away just give it to me like I'm and you got to understand what he's saying I was listening amen to the to the adoption series and he saw what a nugget he said but then he said it this duck it can be polished and this bucket can be polished what was he saying he talked about how the preachers a would come along and take the foundation of it staying with the very thought of it but giving you more of it hallelujah something that gonna fit you in your day right so we look at this thing is your brother Brooks are you in your saying are you insane if I am just let me stay like this because I believe that when you're truly born again there is such on us our overwhelming joy that really strikes your soul and I don't care what you go through that joy and that peace is still in your soul you can't even get rid of it why because it's your governing force when you fall it tells you to get back up hallelujah when you think even tells you to think right when you do wrong it tells you to do right when you feel your brother tells you to make it right see that is the Living bread and that Living bread and you cannot be affected by your emotions or what you think of what you feel is going to always tell you the truth and what's right you got to eat it though Lord he is it Lord I want to think like you you can't think like God without feeding the Holy Ghost this word hallelujah if you don't understand something let me tell you something you know how God keep his people alive by feeding them himself I don't mean feeding him feeding you with the spoon he gives you himself he is the only truth life Emma you understand me because you remember him in this bread and I'm Way off my nose but I'm a preacher like he wants me to preach it with this bread we're talking about he says now listen what he did there it was some karna bread he gave there in the wilderness did he help them any then they did when the murmurings lessened no it was increased ha because they didn't know what it was and there are so many people with the Holy Ghost but we'll never be effective really to you until you know what it is it's not a thing it's a person it is God it is your life it is what you are to become is that right you got to know that this manner is not a thing it's God that's why Jesus said to them except you eat my flesh whoo let's say the Word of God is the flesh of God this you got to read it that right John took God told John danger told John eat the whole book hmm I appreciate my sister over there she she said I just finished the whole Bible and I praise the Lord there's so many Christians they never read it all I'll let it be huh and we need to read him from A to Z little by little you don't have to read a book a day read as you you know your ability to read just read a little bit at a time but it ought to be an objective for you this year to finish the whole book oh my god and we you know we look at this thing you said well it's because you don't understand and I hate this day and I'm not trying to belittle anybody my point is there's so many people in this message who's never read that sure changes hello the church ages is so essential to the very seven seals if it wasn't so God would not have given it to you if it wasn't so God would not have indicated he would not have come down in jeffersonville tabernacle and write like a man on the wall he did that to vindicate how important it is for the bride to make yourself ready ah otherwise you allowing yourself to be vulnerable to leavening that's what happens in the message people don't fully get it they don't read it they don't study they don't look into it and then here comes some kind of preacher trying to make himself something ain't no great preachers in this message there's only Lord hallelujah y'all can say Amen if you like but my point is this amen I refuse and this is what I'm saying I said this down in Iowa City one of the greatest problems of the message is gossip backbiting telling lies you know even the Word of God said you and I as a believer should never believe a false report about a preacher don't let nobody tell you a lie about an elder without a witness I don't care how real it seemed you must understand the Satan he is a deceiver and his whole purpose is to get you tangled up in something that's not right you understand me hello God knows Satan spirit and Satan is how can I say it some people call a creeper cuz he me moved slowly hmm you don't know how gossip starts beautiful he might say I lose something like throwing out a hook and then you you won't respond in there throw something else out at you and then you're like oh you got you now there it goes now I want you to understand by God's grace that when Jesus and that's how come Jesus became a devil to a lot of people because of gossip did you know that oh we heard that your mama and your daddy right Mary and Joseph produced you you were born in fornication we heard right here was Jesus a grown man and that lie was still going on and wasn't even true wasn't true huh let me go on now he said our fathers did eat manna in the desert as it is written he gave them bread from heaven to eat and jesus said unto them verily verily I say unto you Moses gave you not the bread from heaven but my father giveth you the true bread from heaven in other words God sit down these natural things angel food it was sweet to the taste and it still wasn't enough is that right they said I'm tired of this man now I never get tired of God I could never get tired of his word hallelujah you know that's what happened actually I couldn't be married to another girl when I was in denominational this one girl that you know ain't gonna call her name you know Noah but still yet I was really in fact waiting with this girl and I thought oh she's so pretty oh ma and you know she can shout and she can sing and she can dance and oh look at their own thing one day in a Wednesday night service amen she gets up and she leaves outside I guess she wanted me to follow that wasn't gonna happen so I asked her and she did not even know brother brother reached I was a day or two away from asking her would she marry me mmm you know what she said to me so why did you go outside like that you stayed the whole time she said it got boring I extra out check it however you want to say it erased it deleted it my heart was hurting but I knew I could never marry a girl who thought the word was boring you know I could care less if they came by somebody who stuttered I stand right there and wait till he finish as long as it's the Word of God but people wants to be entertained and that's the problem with the message now we have entered into the entertainment arena you can't even joy God and that's how preachers preaching and doing all of that Jesus didn't do it so where's the lemon coming from and separately and have a list of things that he need to bring before he brings his finer point so everybody can jump and shout that's not the Lord that's Hollywood and when it's all said and done how do you feel do you feel strengthened do you feel like I'm leaving out here and I can conquer there like Goliath hallelujah do you feel like a man that when it is all said and done I've got something in me that could sustain me coz bread makes you feel for hmm am i I'm okay see we're coming into another year we can't enter into another year with the same mindset we had this year and expect to improve expect to be higher and to go closer to God right we can't do it and we feel like oh this is a religion then and I don't halfway believe it anyway but I'm a fake until I make it well you're gonna drop off down the road that won't work with the pressure that's coming hmm but some have to drop off you know it's written now we look at this thing he says listen let me move on by the grace of God you love the Lord the word of the Lord is in turn eternal because what happens is they walking to Emmaus it goes on now their hearts are burning and God they see something is happening here but I don't know exactly what it is they didn't record but one thing for sure when he got ready to leave and that's what brother Baron said God when they owned on incomes sometimes in the server's are upon you God will act like he want to leave sometimes you know what I'm saying you get out of your knees the power of God is there they love her it suddenly lifts but God wants to know how much you want him to remain you'd get up and said well my prayers over Oh beg him Lord plead with him stay with me a little while longer because if he stay with you a little while longer he's gonna break some bread he's gonna give you a revelation that you never seen before because that's exactly what he did to on the road to emmaus when they got there they stayed let have dinner Nina gets the bread and he breaks it then the Bible says then they ask for my god they didn't even hesitate let's let's sleep the night through no sir the Bible said let's go back to the others and tell them what we've seen but it calls the spirit when God reveals to you who he is and that he's really alive and well you gotta know this you must know this because the president is coming and if God is just a book reading to you you're gonna miss you're gonna go you gonna come short this Bible must live he he's living he talks yeah I'm sure everybody knows that God talks to me every day every day and you and I must know that that God wants to talk to you but sometimes we're so busy we can't hear him right we was coming down my son-in-law was coming down the church this morning I had my blinker light on I didn't hear it I had a thing over my ear and you know it was just covered my ears were covered with something man-made but he heard it because he didn't have nothing over his ears and I think that's what happens we come to the church and we've got these man-made thoughts in our minds and you know what it clogs up your hearing and when God comes you can't even hear it you're not in this spirit because you've been rushing and fussing and everything else and you get in the spirit at the end of the service and the message is over may God help us this morning amen to know that this bread is real the world is real and just like the Bible said oh my god it must not have any leavening why do you think God commands us to confess and make things right because that little Lebanon will puff your flesh it will alter who you really are y'all love that and we don't need no alteration if we do we need a transformation let's put it that way hallelujah now you love the Lord it's eternal and Jesus proved to them the bread I am the bread and if I told you that you live and will not die I must show you that I live and cannot die so he didn't say well I'm gonna give you this and I'ma wait till you die so you can live no he proved that he was the resurrection and he is the resurrection hallelujah he was doing all he could give do to let them know because you've been feeding on me this is what you're going to get hallelujah don't you understand that's what Paul was so excited about dying he was excited he said all death where is your sting o grave where is your victory thanks be to God who gives us the victory through our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ he understood I've been feeding on the bread I've been eating on the word and I passed from death unto life I cannot die anymore cry oh this is the part I like when Jesus had that loaf of bread all the pieces of that bread was from one loaf it was like a jigsaw puzzle there were no extra pieces every piece was important to make the picture perfect hallelujah I love it is nothing more discouraging when you have mastered a big puzzle and you come down to the last piece and you can't find it anybody know what I'm talking about a man especially when the pieces are small I hated those kind but I did them anyway it would take me time and time to get it but down the road we finally got in you oh but more like most of all there was nothing more discouraged when you couldn't find that last little piece and most of the time is in the middle somewhere where it could be sea mist or whatever see so but not with God there's only one brand I love it I'm loving these people because I know like like tonight we're gonna take communion I know more now with those one bread breaking off those pieces and in order to make it complete every piece must continue to exist you understand me and so what God does he says now he did oh so me and the piece become one me the bread and I we become one oh one bread one body and I'm part of it hallelujah the whole flow can be complete it cannot be complete without me it cannot be complete without you oh praise the Lord eternal life you mean to tell me just by partaking and eating this I have eternal life that's what he said mmm see I'm feeding something on the inside you know me I'm feeding something on the inside and one of my feet brother and said you must feed the Holy Ghost the word if you really want to grow in grace you got to feed it you got to give him muscles see because when he was born in you he was born like a baby the proper God said like Jesus was born in a manger may God be born in the manger of our hearts see when God was born in our hearts he born in a filthy place he had to clean up hallelujah Oh God is good to us he loved the Lord he feeds the hungry but watch this now because as it was then and I mama because of time I'm not gonna keep you much longer because of this realize that people are following the message because of the depth of the word and you hear that a lot right hello Jesus said you only follow me for the fish in the loaves see they want to impress you because they know the word and they can quote the word I want you to know that the devil can quote it better than any of us and won't even skip a beat but I don't care how much a man or is preaching this word if he's not getting into your personal life he's not really call because I'm gonna tell you something this message consists a bitter and sweet Oh correction be zealous to repeat that's your age when God called you he said be zealous to repent and this message came to hammer you say what to beat you to shape you to form you to get all this worldly stuff out of you so that God can see his reflection not yours not your image not my image his image that's the transformation it must be him transforming himself into you hallelujah am I wrong about this that's what Jesus said I don't do nothing except that's let's see the father doing it in other words I'm not here to get a name and to be glorified or to be honored he said I'm not even looking for your honor because my father are like me oh my hallelujah when we think about how God comes along and he feeds 5,000 right the Bible said he Fifi had only five loaves and two fish and he said bring him to me because be sure but they gonna stop Lord just a desolate place this age is desolate this is a desolate place and if God don't feed us we will die of hunger that's why I can't understand how people just miss church and miss search and expect for them not be hungry and expect for them not to be weak you gonna be weak you gonna be hungry and normally in your fall or faint because you miss your meal right and he says come together the more when you see that Day approaching and this is what I am trying to tell people you its obligated it's a commission it's almost like a command come together the law when you see that day approaching anybody see the day approaching if you can't see the rapture in view something's wrong with you if you can't see that this America is getting ready to go up in flames something's wrong with you not just America the whole world don't you understand if in the brother branham didn't say which would go out whether he said he said one bomb won't drop before we you know the rapture but he didn't say that that California won't drop off the map before we leave he didn't say that he left that just like California gonna sing hmm don't you know California sink what is going to do people why do you think that these audience is now melting the ice what were you thinking brother Brahim said even even Isaiah said it's gonna it's gonna it's gonna wobble and tartar like a drunkard there's gonna be a polar shift now you don't have to believe that but it will be it's been before Lansdale beneath Capernaum Pompeii and all these other places that underneath the ocean they're gonna rise where the balance a Florida would sink England would sink in the water you know they are even with the geologists now geologists and now mapping out the land that's going to be to remain with that will remain when all of this stuff happens they call it global warming I don't know what it is all I know is that the Word of God will be fulfilled and it doesn't matter how it's done it's gonna be done so you sure what brother was where is that gonna leave us huh I'm trusting we'll leave before the earthquake that's all I'm saying I'm just trying to give you a visual mind I don't know exactly how it's going to be but I tell you what it's gonna be ugly hello it's gonna be ugly and if that brothers dream who had that dream in 1933 if he's accurate and I really believe that dream was accurate because during that time there was no baby cars during that time there was no men wearing earrings huh you understand me if you've never heard read that dream it's good thing you go look it up the dream of 33 histories but my point is if this be of God it was not we know that this I was telling the church the other day trump means war ruler and then you got Jared amen which means to this thing and you you know the Lord shall descend with the Trump that means have been God is placed even in our white house a dissension and a trump right in our faces a sign a little piece of nugget to let us know how close it is will it be during this time it sounds like it may be but we know that Trump with what he did with Israel has caused a disturbance a political starburns it's actually busting up at you in religious disturbance because the Pope then jumped into it now y'all understand what I'm saying but let me tell you what Jerusalem will always be the capital Rome will never be the capital even though it would take God to bring her down y'all better wake up and smell the coffee let they say uh-huh what is leavening and I'm almost done with this portion I just have to finish the rest tonight learning is a substance or as a yeast or baking powder that's causes from fermentation and expansion of dough and batter you see that's why we don't do grape juice grape juice can firm in and be bitter and God is not bitter he's sweet hallelujah that's why our wine is not a bit of line it's a sweet wine hallelujah come on somebody amen and remember when Jesus was doing the bread and wine he said don't leave nothing eat it all drink it all right because this is me I don't want you to leave not one jot or tittle left eat it all and that's how it is we must eat the whole look I said Lord how do we eat the hope of death as some of us may not even be able to read he said but listen I am the book I am the bread I am the word and if you get sealed with the Holy Ghost that is the whole book ah you love the Lord man should not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God let me get you that one scripture and I'll let you go for tonight I believe it's st. John 16 No yeah 16 25 to 33 will read that will let you go I am that bread this bread is the Lord Jesus Christ and understand that's why the scripture says if we are baptized into him remember said that's why the death angel can pass because he can't see you because you are him you are in Christ and that word Christ is anointed world I'm saved and you ain't got no an aunty anointing is the word it is Christ God don't have says oh I'm Christ and here's some anointing he is the anointing he is the one that were braked listen when you get joy in your heart folks who you think putting it there when faith comes in your heart and you have an assurance don't you understand God is the one that placed it there you think about it that Pool of Bethesda and all those people used to come and according to history some folks would even fight and try to kill each other to see how and who would get in there there first and here was a crippled man and Jesus about passed all of them think about it he wasn't mistaken he he didn't get the wrong orders there was one man God saw and his favor went to that one man and he was not even the worst at the cool I know what y'all been doing staying up so late at night now you're tired but it's okay you know we look at these things and you feel that whatever we read we saw so we read you know it's true and don't put the pressure on the pastor because you stayed up my thing is this you look at these things and he says listen these things have I spoken unto you in Proverbs again at the 25th first but the time comes when I shall no more speak unto you in progress but I shall show you plenty of the father at that day you shall ask in my name and I say not unto you that I would pray the Father for you for the father himself love with you because ye have loved me and I believe that I am and I have believed that I came out from him hey wait a minute jesus says because I have believed I have came out from here you gotta believe it how you gonna get them you don't believe you came from him you gotta believe it right you love the Lord his disciples said unto Him Lord now speak it out plainly and speaketh no proverb so he says I come from God what's going to happen when the pressure coming you say I and my father are one you will that were distinguished you before from from the denomination and organization if Jesus had to say it you're gonna say it too and that's what people are knocking you I know you are huh I know your background no you don't if you knew my background you knew I came from glory you know I proceeded from the Father I came out of him you said well what do you mean brother ins are a I am the word now you see how do you is that right are you the word if you're not the word you're gonna pass away because the word is the only thing that's going to stand i am the word made manifest for this day guess what and because of the bride of Jesus Christ in the seals been ripped off and I have a clear view of the of the naked party of Jesus I know who I am how did you understand me I'm saying you got to know who you are and if I have seen him I know him and he knows me how do you know that because the bread I eat and I've been eating it takes away all i am lee-char it's my medicine it's my balm in Gilead you know when I use that word dalm I think about the vom be balm in Gilead hallelujah amen it would break up every devil's lie hallelujah oh my yes the Lord is good to us his disciples oh yeah jesus said unto them do you do you now believe like all these talking to him behold the hour cometh yeah is now come that ye shall be scattered every man to his own and shall lead me alone and yet I am NOT alone because the father is with me these things I have spoken to you that in me you may have peace and in the world you should have tribulation but be of good cheer I have overcome the world that's what my stop because he overcame we overcame brother BAM said every obstacle Jesus overcame we overcame in him do you believe that oh it's a whole lot I'm in prison huh I got these bad habits in I can't know I'm overcome it may not happen today but I'm also come up I'm predestinated to be overcome it's mine it might happen in the future it's still mine and I'm gonna claim it like it's today I'm waiting till happen hallelujah is that right that's right brother Balaam said if you want a baby and he talked to the sisters he's a you say I got one I'm having one right now right you claim it you speak it hallelujah you may not even God where the doctor say I've got this condition my son and I'm closing I really am this is my last thought my my son and I guess he doesn't mind I'm put it on Facebook but he and his wife is having a baby and the doctors told him and his wife by way of examining her that she had a condition that she couldn't have any children so I recommended them some stuffing and and but she wouldn't take it and my son said but we have another baby I believe it and we're gonna have us a baby she never used that stuff and God gave me the baby why somebody had faith somebody listen you know and I marvel that and it's Joseph my mom let Josie because Joseph could care less about the medication I told him about he just knew God showed him they were gonna have a child hallelujah now the only way down to Mexico to celebrate your glory to God anybody alive in here I got some people down huh okay good I'm glad to see it but my point is people when you take God at His Word don't look at circumstances well circumstances got to do with the promise of God now what you're going to do when if you should die and in God take 10 years to come back and you land up in that grave I'll ride it up with bones and everything you got to know you coming up out of there now if you can believe that you should be able to believe anything else cuz circumstances while you and the grave said there's no way just thinking what about those people that was there thousands of years into somebody said well they found the tomb of Joseph I say they must have found his writings that this was it because he wasn't there ain't gonna tell you that the jaws of a in the - y'all know that Joseph got up when Jesus got up hallelujah they could find whatever they find my Josephine is an empty tomb glory to God I'm feeling good why because Joseph dim ate off the rear breathe while all means of people was eating off the natural bread that came down that wonderful praise the Lord sweet nice hallelujah Joseph was seeing they excuse me I'm talking about Joshua now I'm sorry but Joshua was seeing something greater and Joseph was - Joseph knew he was packed with a dream in that vision being a property knew was going to come to pass even though he did not know how and where and when it was all said and done and God opened the curtains for Joseph Joseph realize oh my god the very thing I saw as a dream the thing I told my mom and my daddy and then they got mad with me and now here we are they're bowing before me the purpose is to save Israel hmm because he ain't after living less than you know I I know we all strong we all have our little things that we want God to overcome help us overcome I'm pressing and what I when I mean pressing is I'm learning to yield he's depressor I'm the yield er I'm learning to yield to God because you got the Holy Ghost doesn't mean you're going in the rapture you've saved hello you saved but only the statue of a perfect man that person who've come to a perfect statue in Christ listen go listen to it I'm not saying my words it's something I missed for a long time go go look at it and that's what the devil is messing with us oh I got the Holy Ghost he said that's what happened to the children in the wilderness they were justified they were sanctified and they wouldn't cross over that's what happened to Judas he was justified he was sanctified and they wouldn't cross over you've got to have Christ listen a hope the Bible said that whole creation waited for the manifestations of the sons of God if that had already been completed we would be called but God has a crowning jewel and that's his bride and she will come to maturity she will a man be able people Oh are we gonna speak things and there's this we are those who all come to a maturity because God is not going to handle give his word to a child Solomon said I've come for a full-grown woman I don't want no baby I won't I want everything developed hmm I'm no sister I get under this anointing and I just came out of style that's pretty father we come before you lord we think if your goodness we thank you for your mercy Lord is so good and rich to me may be simple but it's so rich to me because I see what you're doing and I see by your grace or God what you were you're bringing us - there's so many Lord God that's just oh god you know the conditions but father only you know the hearts of us all and I pray father God if our hearts are not in the right places that you would do something to change them now father forgive us and cleanse us from all our sins Lord change us from glory to glory like Paul said we're changed from glory to glory from faith all the way up to a divine nature Christ well you said Lord will not be failed fall and won't be a failure when it comes to bringing forth fruit help us now give us grace strengthen us Lord open our hearts and our eyes of understanding Lord let the people see they have heard this message and so for so long but there is a time when the time becomes now in Lord I believe what I heard you speak the time is now and we're going to prepare ourselves the time otherwise Lord we could be spewed just like all the other ages there are those who won't make it all Lutheran's didn't make it all Westlands didn't make it throughout all the ages they were always somebody who heard but because of their unbelief and because of their dilatory slothfulness they didn't make it I pray father God that that you blessed us and have mercy upon everyone that's here this morning that you'll do something in their souls do something and take the carnality away from them father may they see the lateness of the hour help us now because you said in your word many will lose out because of the cares of this life father please refocus us this coming we're coming Oh God maybe would be better Christians maybe Christians on fire hallelujah help us now law in your lovely name Jesus Christ we pray amen such a lovely lovely name the name of Jesus such a lovely love the name I love such a lovely lovely
