my friend love you too and y'all wonder where I learned earned it behold the man you can blame I wouldn't have it any other way amen I remember many years ago and I say many years it's been many years for me I used to watch brother Brooks in the pull pit and I used to thank God if you'd ever be gracious enough to me a dummy to allow me to work side by side with that brother I would just I would never ask you for nothing else ever again and I'm going to tell you I I I just have to say how thankful I am to the Lord that God's allowed me to have a friendship with your pastor it means the world to me and I can't begin to tell you how honored I I love him and God knows I wouldn't be the man I am today without isaah Brooks that's the truth and God knows that um you know you probably feel the same way about the man you know you thank God for the vessels that God sends into the place and men that are willing amen men that are willing amen thank God for them I said thank God for them amen thank God for them amen if we don't have men like this in this message people that are willing to speak up and tell the truth and preach and so for like that brother we're going to be in a real big mess for this day is over with but thank God we've got men of God on this Earth today that are willing to say what's right amen and tell the truth amen you may baby SE once again if you can I know it gets in your legs and you got to stand stand that's all right too but I'd like to invite my wife if she can put that baby down I don't know she's holding on awful tight and uh maybe have her come sing if she would this morning or this uh evening rather um I was thinking maybe try to sing a little bit better than what she did this morning I thought she was laying right with it this morning pretty good but I know there's more in there she just holding back he man appreciate you all very much and thank you for the opportunity to get to come and be with you like this and I I hate that it's just in and out seemed like and just such a quick spot of things but you know that's that's just kind of evangelism brother BR said you run into a city set it on fire and run back out so that's that's kind of the way of it sometimes and you don't really get the opportunity to really shake hands a whole lot even sometime but I was grateful to the Lord I had the opportunity to be able to greet some of y'all people here this afternoon and see you and so forth and and uh you know I love you don't youen amen I I know I was hard on you this morning called some of y'all pemon suckers and lemon suckers and all that kind of stuff but you know people get offended at you about them kind of things you know they they think that you're trying to say something to them he's you calling me that way well I I I was but I I wasn't saying it to be mean I was just telling the truth amen but when it's out of love you know and and uh and so well I think people can feel that too you know they they know that it's not trying to be hateful or mean to them and really in a way the only way you can describe how to get into the better part is you got to talk about this other part a little bit and uh folk don't like that they don't want you getting in their Tater Patch and all that kind of stuff like that but I I'm going to tell you something friends and you just just remember that I told you this deep in your heart hold these words in your in your soul and your being if we're ever going to get out of here if we're ever going to make the Rapture it's going to take people that are not the kind of people people that are going to be babied around and you know kind of somebody pacify them and preach it the way that they like it but if we're ever going to get out of here you just keep it in your heart you're going to have to take some hard preaching sometimes amen and somebody's going to have to tell you the truth and you're going to have to receive what is truth Man without it we're never going to get out of here oh my y'all look like you're good and hungry again tonight that's good that's good I've got a good meal laying in here ready for you in just a minute amen [Music] [Music] actually I

praise the Lord amen let's stand together tonight praise the Lord are you one of those Saints [Music] tonight amen amen let's turn to the Book of Revelation well if you got your happy shoes and your joy shoes on tonight you're probably going to let loose when I announc my title loosed from our sins amen now that was a little bit more on the Baptist side now if you've really been loose from your sins it looked like it' been a little bit better than that now letu let's try that one more time shall we loosed from your sins yeah that's much more like it that's it right there I understand I didn't emphasize it right I just said your sins I get it amen amen revelation in chapter 1 let's look at verse 4 verse 5 amen are you thankful to be a Christian I tell you the way the Lord moved for us this morning I'm just looking for a triple portion of that Revelation 1 verse4 and verse 5 John to the seven churches which are in Asia Grace be unto you and peace from him which is and which was and which is to come and from the seven spirits which are before his throne and from Jesus Christ who is the faithful Witness and the first begotten of the dead and the prince of the kings of the earth unto him that loved us I'm looking for those that have that Revelation tonight unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins and his very own blood now want you to listen to this in the church age book page 30 34 brother man reads the scripture he says the word washed is actually loosed loosed us from our sins in his own blood isn't that wonderful praise the Lord yes brother brandom it is but are you spiritual minded did you catch it it was his own blood that loosed us completely from our sins it was not human blood no not at all it was the blood of God Amen Peter called it the blood of Christ Paul called it the blood of the Lord and the blood of Jesus not three persons but one person amen let's pray together Heavenly Father how we thank you Lord Lord in an atmosphere like this I almost hold my breath before I pray just scared that I'll somehow do the wrong thing and move that great eternal spirit into a a different spot we're so careful Lord to hold on to you while you're here we want to grab a hold of every fiber every every little substance every molecule that you are oh God let our hearts be so set of flame tonight with the revelation of thy presence Lord Jesus we'll feel you in a more special way than we've ever felt you before in our life I look down at your word today and I recognize that any man with a human ability can take the Bible open up the pages of the Bible and by definition that man or woman has opened the Bible but I recognize that the only true opener of the word is not myself not any other preacher any other man or woman but it is the author himself I pray today Lord take your word and open it up to our hearts please won't you won't you take this tonight sir and speak to our hearts in a very Reverend and real way God give us the joy and the power that accompanies the Revelation help us Lord to see ourselves in a much different way than we've ever seen us Lord help us to recognize your presence in a way we've never recognized it and father help us to be able to uncover every area that might be hindering our walk with God tonight May the Holy Spirit Expose and oh God may you take us into thy hands and speak to us Lord both speaker and hearer for I submit both to you on this platform for the glory of God and the name of Jesus Christ amen and amen and all the saints of God said amen you may be seated may the Lord bless you you know friends the presence of the Lord is such a wonderful thing that when a man or woman gets a hold of it they don't really want to let it go as well they shouldn't because the true uh spirit of God or the true power of God in the heart of a Believer is more than just the ability to shout or to jump or to Rejoice which we believe in all of that as you heard me preach this morning I believe those things are true but it is also a loosing power is a power that when a man or woman is bound up by the law of of death or the law of sin or the law of transgression as we've been uh handed down this great grab bag of life that's just a terrible thing that uh your genetics and my genetics isn't really much to speak of but yet in that Holy Spirit there is a loosing power that gives us authority over this this body here so your daddy may have been high tempered your grandma may have been impatient and all that but once a man or woman receives the Holy Ghost it gives them authority over this body here you believe that now we realize that when John is writing this book here that the the the very revelation of this now if you just allow me a moment just to kind of lay a foundation it may not sound like I'm going where I might be going but uh you'll see how it ties together in just a moment but you you take this book of Revelation and this particular book is a special book to you and I the reason that it is indeed a special book is because God if you will kept a padlock or we know seven padlocks on This Book of Revelation that it could not be revealed until a certain time now if sitting around the table in Fellowship you had John the Baptist and uh John the Revelator and you had Isaiah and you had Jeremiah and you had uh all these different prophets you had Luther you had Wesley and you was to go around the room even the Apostle Paul Simon Peter and you was to say uh before the time of this book to be revealed uh now now brother John uh you're the one that had the vision do you understand what it means John would have to say no I I don't understand brother being what it means I see the symbols I had the vision everything was laid out but I don't understand it now if you wants to go and move to Paul will say the man who had the message of the day and Paul being the one that you would think would have the mystery of God that was contained in this book and say now Paul you're God's Great Apostle uh the Lord you know he's magnified your office he's G you such an authority that if you yourself came back and tried to correct it or an angel come from Heaven to correct that word then of course that person would have to be a curse that's the kind of message Paul had now now Paul surely surely you understand what this Book of Revelation is Paul have to say brother Ben honestly I I don't know what it means if you was to move to Simon Peter and say Simon Peter now you've got the keys to the kingdom you opened up the door for the Jew opened up the door for the Gentile through water baptism remission of sin and so forth surely Peter you've got the understanding of what this book of Revelation means and he would have to say honestly brother Ben I just don't know what it means now it doesn't mean that it's not the word of God and it doesn't mean just because somebody doesn't understand it doesn't mean that there's important values in it but what it shows us is that God kept a seven sealed padlock on this Revelation until the time that it was to Break Forth now we realize that where they couldn't raise their hand and say I I I'm In This Crowd and I understand it and let me tell you what it means where they couldn't raise their hand you and I can raise our hands tonight and say I Now understand what they didn't understand now we look in This Book of Revelation we realize that it is the mystery of God of the fullness of God everything God was historically present in the future it's all wrapped up in this book of Revelation and we realize that every book has what they call an Apostolic salutation or a greeting and so this Apostolic greeting or this salutation was common amongst many of the disciples uh you'd hear Paul for example say uh now to the church in Ephesus uh to the Saints uh Paul me an apostle I greet you in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ now what he was doing was not just finding words to to fill in pages and to make it sound nice or to sound pretty so it could be read poetically but it was actually putting in the mind of the reader that which they needed to think of as they read the rest of the letter so as Paul would go into the Ephesian age and he'd say I'm an apostle I magnify my office then the Saints could say oh I get it he's an apostle so he's not acting in the way of evangelism this is not an Evangelistic letter but he's an apostle or an order Setter so he's going to set forth the order of the church in Ephesus and coloss and Corin thians in these different ways so the apostolic greeting would tell you what the man had in his mind before he wrote the letter glory to God hallelujah see I'm already starting to shout because I know something you don't know now you realize when you come to all of these books James and Titus and fimon and Hebrews and all these different books that the Book of Revelation is set apart in one way from the rest of these books because it is the only book that was reserved to the ending of the church ages it is the only book The only letter that God ever wrote that he literally padlocked that Revelation to keep it from being revealed until the time of the end now you realize there's two books that the devil hates the most Genesis and Revelation and this particular book holds an answer to us in how we're supposed to live how we're supposed to serve God the type of ways we things we do to please the Lord onor on and off so as Jesus is going to give his Revelation or give his his you know his his unfolding what he is to John on the aisle of patmas he starts out with a greeting and he wants you to know what is in his mind when he goes to greet his children glory to God so he says now from he which is which was and which is to come Hallelujah from the very beginning of the very letter he wants you to know I am the same yesterday today and forever oh my Hallelujah notice and from him which is and which was and which is to come now notice in verse 5 this is where you really get the meat and potatoes if you will of the greeting he says and from Jesus Christ so this is not from John amen no this is not from John this is not John's letter to the elected of God this is the letter of Jesus Christ the revelation of Jesus Christ personally unto you wrote unto you in this letter now you'll notice it's from Jesus Christ and he says now children I want you to recognize I am a faithful witness oh brother there's been many people down through time that ain't been very faithful to me I've had friends that ain't been faithful I've had all kinds of deals at work it ain't been faithful but there's one person brother sister that will always be faithful to you and I and that is the Lord Jesus Christ himself amen you'll notice this now he is the first begotten would you mind bringing this up a little I'm going to be horse if I don't quit this way notice he is the first begotten of the Dead thank you now you'll notice that he wants to show you not only am I the Eternal one but I have Resurrection Life resurrection power and I am the first begotten of he which was dead and I am alive forever more glory to God now notice he is the first begotten of the dead he is the prince of the kings of the earth and it is unto him now notice now unto him that loved us so just in his hello just in his greeting he wants you to know I love you Hallelujah friends I wonder sometimes what people think the real theme of this message is you know what I'm saying I wonder sometimes what people really think the theme of this entire message really is the theme of this message is not how deep and how revelated you get come on somebody I'm not saying that it's wrong to have deep Revelations of God you ought to be studying this word day and night to know where you stand to know what Christ is the devil is you need to study to show yourself approved but but but understanding my mentally alone will never bring you to this oh it'll never bring you to that Revelation that Jesus Christ loved you before the foundation of the world or do you realize that if a man or woman knows that he loves them and you realize that God don't love everybody the Bible tells us in the Book of Romans he said Jacob have I loved Esau have I hated amen so if the very revelation of pre destination is he loved you you ought to be the happiest person amen That Ever Walked the face of this planet huah so he's saying unto him that loved us so already predestination is in view cuz there's some that God don't love amen praise the Lord amen there are some that God does not love at all amen oh you say that's nonsense for God so loved the world he gave his only begotten son don't think of it the way way you're thinking love moved God and love himself moved God for a sinful Humanity but God's love is only shared with those that are willing to reciprocate that love brother the devil won't get God's love amen inside of Hell won't get God's loveen come on y'all going to preach at me or stare at me come on these out here ain't going to get God's love but you and I can get a dose and a double portion of God's eternal love for you and I amen let me say it in street terms God ain't no dummy huh he knows who loves him and who don't love him he knows who's going to give back to him and who ain't going to give he know the end from the beginning he knows who's going to love him and who ain't going to love him I want to love him with all of my heart praise the Lord now notice unto him that loved us and and that is always a conjunction so if he loved you there's a second part that comes with that love amen he looses you from your sins in his very own blood amen Oh Glory to God glory to God so those who God's love who God loves those are the ones that will be recipients of God's loosing power amen how on Earth some of you all are sitting still right now I can't even figure it out oh my than of this now so the word that he uses for wash is actually loose so while I'm being washed I'm being loosed amen when I'm being loosed I'm being washed that works out pretty good don't it that's the reason you come to the house of God so the word can begin to communicate to your heart that you need to be washed look brother when you come to the house of God you don't come clean you don't come everything just so so but the Holy Spirit takes his word and he must wash you over and over and over again to br oh Hallelujah to show forth what the loosing power of Jesus Christ amen you just didn't get loose the day you got saved but every time you come to church you're being washed loosed loosed washed loosed wash loose over and over again he's loosing even tonight he's taking the chains off some of us praise the Lord now notice now it was his own blood St John chapter 6 verse 54 now we we touched on this just a little bit this morning but I want to go a little bit deeper in this St John chapter 6 verse 54 now notice Jesus says who so eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood hath eternal life and I will raise him up at the last day now I want you to notice here that Jesus himself is the word you just have to take my word for it I ain't got enough time to work it up and prove it to you you just going have to believe it so Jesus being the word him who being the Eternal one became flesh so the word in the beginning was the word the word was was with God the Word was God and the word became flesh so Jesus is not telling them I want you to know on my arm I want you to eat my finger off and eat my eyeball and and eat my foot and cannibalize my body after I'm gone and drink of my blood but he's saying I want you to partake of the revelation of who I am oh think of it so in the very opening of John's letter he is showing them what he told him in St John 6 this is the revelation of My Flesh and my blood let me ask you a question when you would take Adam and Eve and stand them side by side if Eve came from Adam's Body and she had his bones and she had his flesh tell me whose blood she had praise the Lord if you done a DNA test on Eve it would have showed up Adam Adam Adam Adam amen praise the Lord Lord so you take this bride Who is the very is partaking whose blood does she have Hallelujah whose blood does she have she don't have the blood of a Jew she don't have the blood of a gentile no she has the blood of her husband the second man Adam so Jesus says who so eats my flesh and drinks my blood so if the revelation of who he is is is what we're supposed to partake of if Adam and Eve had the same blood so when I eat his flesh and drink his blood I get the same Revelation about me that I get about him if he is eternal I am Eternal come on somebody now notice Jesus doesn't stop there no no he says and I will raise him up the very same words that he says in the Book of Revelation I am the first begotten of the don't you understand what that means it means when you partake of the revelation of Jesus Christ and he loves you he reveals himself to you he looses you from your sins not only does he give you the power to be free from sin but that very same revelation will also resurrect this body amen your flesh your cells will be rearranged all together am oh my now you know that we're forgiven we're also Justified but we're not just saved there is a difference in being saved and being redeemed yeah Hallelujah yeah glory to God Buckle in your Baptist seat belt I'm about to blow you out now if I was to walk out on this street out here out in the church parking lot will say and I find a cell phone and I take that cell phone I stick it in my pocket bring it back give one of the brothers I have saved that cell phone amen saved it from getting stepped on Sav it from getting run over I've saved it save that cell phone but if that cell phone was mine I didn't save it I redeemed it hallu you say why because it was mine in the first place Hallelujah Glory Hallelujah now there are those on this Earth that are going to be saved people at the end there'll be those that live outside the city the foolish virgin they will be saved but there is a difference between saved and Born Again Hallelujah I am not just saved but I am redeemed Redeemed by the blood and the grace of Almighty godall Oh Glory to God now notice save people they have a lot to worry about when they come up before the Throne of God because if one thing is laying in there that ain't right with God he'll see it now turn me now to Hebrews chapter 4:12 now let's let's just take a few scriptures tonight let's just look at how the bride stands before him now you realize all of us have the opportunity to stand before Christ's throne in prayer and so forth like that but now notice now Hebrews 4:12 for the word of God God is quick didn't say slow that's way some people are in church takes them 45 minutes to finally get their hand up in there but the word of God ain't slow it's quick hey that's why I preach so fast brother Isaiah it's that word in me making me go that fast the word of God is quick and it's not weak is so the word should never be delivered in a weak way should always come forth powerful any word of God is powerful amen notice and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing of su of Soul and Spirit and of the joints and Marrow and is a discerner of the thoughts and the intents of the heart now notice not only is your thoughts discernable but your intention is discernable too amen do you realize friends a lot of times when preachers go to preaching on things there may not be one person guilty of the actual act or whatever it may be that the that the the man's preaching about but do you realize that the Holy Ghost can see your intention of what you want to do do you realize that many of our sermons in this message are preach more from the Avenue of intention rather than action there are people that is sitting their heart and intend to backslide and intend to quit God and intend to be bitter and angry against this one that one so the man of God by the anoint of the the holy spirit will go right down that Avenue of intention and unearth those intentions and then people sit there and get mad as a devil and blow up like a bullfrog eating buck shot you know why you revealed their intention what they intend to do you remember the prophet of God when when he was standing there having that vision of standing in the trash heat remember the Holy Ghost gives brother bandam a vision of something that will never happen in his lifetime here he is standing there he's a bum he's out there in this trash Heap and he stands there and somebody says to him now brother bradam he said think of it at one time I was the leader of the Bride of Jesus Christ now why did the Holy Ghost show him that because brother Bam's intention was leave the field so God was not revealing his action he was revealing his intention that's good praise the Lord I tell you I guarantee one thing the parts of the service that I get more in trouble for than anything else is when I go to preaching on folks intention praise the Lord somebody amen when I go to preaching on what they intend to do and they'll say somebody told him that somebody revealed no no the Holy Spirit knows the intent of our heart now notice this verse 13 neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight but all things all things are naked and open in the eyes of him with whom we have to do now you'll find these same two words naked and open in Genesis 3:7 and the eyes of them both were opened and they knew that they were naked so God is looking down upon you and I and there's not one thought there's not one intention that you and I can hide from [Music] him now listen carefully because if you miss this next part you're going to miss the whole theme of what I'm hitting at but if you don't know then as you stand before the Lord that everything you are I don't mean partially I don't mean a third of the way everything you are is standing open in the eyes of God amen amen now okay how are you going to stand before his presence and walk up boldly as Paul will tell you in a few minutes boldly before the throne of grace and say Jesus I'm here to ask for this and Jesus I'm standing here to ask for that how you going to do it if you approach his throne in the way of I'm a sinner God sees me as a sinner I'm just saved I'm just forgiven I I just got little things on my life you know that ain't right and oh God I just don't want you to kill me and have mercy no wonder people approach him in that way because they know that their sins in their lives are naked their conscience tells them with Isaiah they know that they're naked and open in the eyes of him with whom they have to do or him they have to reckon so rather than stand there boldly they stand there like a sinner wonder what makes the difference well I'm glad you asked me I'm going to tell you tonight amen notice here in in moffit's Translation this just a different translation for the logos of God is a living thing amen active and more cutting than any sword with double edge yeah penetrating to the very division of Soul and Spirit joints and Marrow scrutinizing the very thoughts and conceptions of the heart amen and no created thing is hidden from him all things lie open and exposed before the eyes of him with whom we have to reckon now how you supposed to stand boldly when you stand like that how how are you supposed to stand there boldly and say God I want my kids I want my joy I want my peace if everything's naked and open yeah boy you're going to be in a mess standing there cuz you won't be able to hide one thing amen unless of course there's a remedy where God can't see it yes sir Hallelujah Glory praise the Lord amen hallelujah I let the kitty out of the bag a little bit too early but it was good anyhow notice this I had to say something y'all was about to pass out on me notice this in Way's translation I like a shadow when I read this listen this translation to Hebrews 4:12 for God's message is full of life and Power [Applause] power I said that's the way the message ought to read this message God's message is not given to us to make us intellectual no it's given because it's full of life and power amen it is Keener than the sharpest two-edged sword it pierces even to the severance of soul from Spirit and penetrates between the joints and the marrow and can discern the secret thoughts and purposes of the heart and no created thing is able to escape its scrutiny but everything lies bare and completely exposed before the eyes of him with whom we have to do Young's literal translation said that all things are naked and open to his eyes so tell me then how are you going to stand there and stand before his presence if you're just saved cuz just being saved means you're just forgiven but it doesn't mean the thing that caused you to sin the first place has been eradicated the little snake still lays inside the heart of a saved person so there's no way that you or I could stand before him and ask boldly ask boldly there's no way brother said we could ask boldly if inside our heart we're just saved amen can I tell it yet I'm about to blow up little bit further okay I'll hold him off in just don't let them blow up notice page 34 man said now would you like an Old Testament type of redemption let us go back to the Garden of Eden he said when the news first came from Glory that his son Adam had been lost did God send an angel you answer me did God send a son did God send another one likened unto us no but he came himself amen let me tell you Jesus's blood was not a not a mixture of Joseph and the holy ghost or or the Holy Ghost and Mary or Mary and the third of the Holy Ghost and 10th of Jose no it was all God God was his mother God was his father every cell in his body was created by the Lamb of God Amen to be the Lamb of God and created by the hand of his father the Lord amen so what blood is it that saved us is it the chemistry of the blood is it just a charge if I had a charger full of his blood up here could that save you no but faith in the revelation of what it really is that'll bring about redemption in the life of a child of God oh oh listen at this he said no he came himself to redeem redeem redeem that lost son he said Hallelujah God did not entrust his Plan of Salvation to another he trusted only himself notice God was made flesh the Eternal God indwelt a mortal body in order to take away sin he became the Lamb of God in order to shed his blood and enter into the veil with it Paul says let us therefore come boldly [Music] Hallelujah so how am I going to stand there boldly if I'm just a sinner saved by grace if I'm just a sinner we say that all the time I'm just an old sinner been saved by grace don't you lay that tag off on me that's right I am no longer a [Applause] sinner once the blood of Christ has loosed me amen I am no longer a sinner in his eyes but I am redeemed hallelujah oh do you realize that's why the message justification means so much to you and I we are not just saved we are not just forgiven but we are Justified amen what does it mean to be justified it means that you are forgiven as though it never took place in the beginning am listen this page 34 brother says consider this since it is the blood of God it is perfect blood amen you don't have it I don't have it I am not perfect I do not have perfect blood and neither do you but God's blood in Jesus was perfect amen perfect perfect there was not an ounce of sin there was not an ounce of degeneration there was not an ounce of that even the Bible said he made himself subject to the law of sin and death do you realize there was enough power the Lord Jesus that if he didn't want to die he could have made death hold off for a thousand years if you amen oh my praise the Lord I know y'all are worried about how horse my voice is but I can preach seven more services just sign like this don't worry about it I'll be all right you wor I want you to worry about this word don't worry about me now notice this now he said the power then of the loosing he said if it is the perfect blood if the perfect blood is lo loosing us from the power of bondage and the defilement of sin he said then the loosing is also perfect and complete oh my god do you understand that once he set you free once he takes the chains off of you you are free indeed it's a perfect loosing Hallelujah God don't halfway loose his children no sir he don't a third of the way loose his children you you are all the way loose how in the world could he stand there and Shake you before the devil if you're not perfectly free but you have perfect Freedom amen you've got perfect loosing by the grace of almighty God Lord thank you Jesus hallelujah oh my listen there is there now no condemnation it to them which are in Christ Jesus Romans 83334 there it is his death gave us the blood he said it is God that justifieth who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect amen Oh Glory to God thank you Jesus he said it is God that justifies who is he that condemneth it's Christ that died brother sister I'm convinced that if the devil would have known what that blood would have done for you and I he would have had a so a stitch and SE party at Calvary to keep that blood from coming out he would have done everything that he possibly could to keep that blood from falling on the ground and from loosing you and I oh my there it is the death gave us his blood the blood has loosed us amen there is therefore no condemnation amen because the blood has loosed us brother B says we are free amen we are Guiltless yes amen thank you Lord praise your name amen okay Glory so when you come up before the presence of the Lord and you stand up there saying now Jesus I'm just an old sinner God you see how riched low down and sorry and good for nothing I am oh God if you can have GCE on this poor little old sinner oh God and have mercy on me the wret that I am and I imagine Papa just sits back and goes just give him a few minutes he'll be done in a minute you okay Lord I get tired of hearing this nonsense every time he comes to pray so what are you going to do about it Jesus nothing I'm going to wait till he finishes and when he gets done maybe the revelation will strike him one day that all that trash he's talking I don't even see it amen amen praise the Lord I'm not giving you a license to go do what you want to do no if you got that in your heart you're not even born again in the first place but a real child of God full of the Holy Ghost when they step boldly do you realize the reason we step boldly Before the Throne of God is because God don't have one not one record not one amen hallelujah let's look at him K he goes up into that throne room of God and starts praying Lord Jesus I I tell you God I don't know why in the world you fool with me I don't know why in the world you even have mercy on me such scum as I am here comes slooh slooh foot that you hear them that's right they're no good they're sorry they're rotten I brought my compendium my library of their sins with me if you'd like to read from my book I'd like to tell you about all they've ever done and how they've done it after the devil gets done running his long tongue and J jaming his yammering his Jaws on for about 30 minutes the Holy Ghost just stops and says um excuse me I I like you know the fact that you think your book means something but my book supersede your booken so if you excuse me just a moment I need to make a search of my own glory to God so God calls out Angel 437 go get the book of Isaiah Brooks so the angel goes and gets the book out of God's compendium a predestinated seed amen remember the prophet of God said God put your picture in a file cabinet before the foundation of the world Amen in a roll ofex of predestination my name was already wrote down in his book amen before I had a chance to S before I ever done anything anything wrong my name was already on his book so the angel comes to the book and says here you go God here you go thank you Satan let's challenge your book with my book Hallelujah you see your book only has a record of from the time they took the Breath of Life till now but my book goes a little farther than that Hallelujah I'm going to go back before they sucked wind God opens up the book and he says H what'd you find God what'd you find nothing it's all covered in [Applause] [Music] blood everywhere I look if they had any sin I can't see it if they had downfalls I don't know it my book says they're completely and perfectly Loose by this Blood that's on this book oh do you realize children the prophet of God said that when your name went on the Lamb's Book of Life he said the name of the Lord Jesus went on there the same night and he said Jesus himself he said wrote your name and his name on the book with his very own blood you say where did he get blood John tells us John tells us for he was the lamb slain from the foundation of the world so in the mind of God there was already a sacrifice before you sucked Wind come on somebody come on somebody before you ever took the breath of life before you ever done a wrong before you ever done any sining at all your name was already bleached in the Clorox of the Holy Ghost Amen brother B says we are free we are Guiltless amen don't listen to man amen amen I wonder why brother bam would take time to say that wonder why he' tell us we Guiltless and then remind us not to listen to man because sometimes man man man come on now man does a lot of talking and that man always reminds you of everything you've ever done but God ain't looking at the man amen he's looking at the blood he's looking at the name he's looking at your representation this is why the prophet said when you pray your voice goes up and mingles with the Lamb of God and when he said he turns to hear you pray he said he doesn't see you he sees Jesus speaking the blood speaks on your behalf the blood speaks for you no wonder the bride can be the living Voice come on somebody no wonder the bride can be the living voice because it's not her speaking it's the voice of the Bride Oh Glory to God don't listen to man listen to the word you are loosed by the blood Colossians chapter 1 ver2 Colossians chapter 1 verse2 notice what what Paul says here giving thanks unto the father wow so I guess Paul believed in worshiping God in church too amen amen where in the world some of these dry hides get that idea I'm worshiping God in spirit and Truth well many of the letters that Paul writes he starts out by shouting praise the Lord blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ do you think Paul was sitting there in that jail C going Blessed Be I kind of have a feeling that him and Silas if they would have sang the Baptist version they wouldn't have got to that jail cell but see they were Pentecostal folk original Pentecost so I imagine Paul might have had to take many of his letters and go mess that one up again and throw it behind him you know why cuz when he started saying blessed he got about b l e glory to God hallelujah praise the Lord praise the Lord oh man I messed it up again amen why because when he got to thinking about what Jesus done for a blind man Hallelujah he couldn't hardly help but just get excited about what he was hearing people think that Paul is sitting there with his glasses on the end of his nose and he's writing scholarly you know you know a big Fountain pin calligraphy type style like that I imagine Paul would write a while set it down and Shout a while go back and ride a while sit down and Shout a while could you imagine the very Revelation that you and I enjoy breaking to this man fresh fresh fresh I don't mean that's secondhand or 30 or 40 times after a sermon but could you imagine this breaking fresh and him sitting in that jail cell going uh now what was that God was that a them a they and us uh who uh how what is it a pronoun an adverb or what is it I imagine by the time Paul got done getting caught up in the spirit after the Holy Ghost is breaking in Revelations he probably had to go back and check the language make sure he didn't change the language oh Hallelujah glory to God glory to God glory to God cuz as he got to WR he might have changed ad verbs oh glory amen amen the Revelation breaking this man listen which hath made us meet to be partakers with the inheritance of the Saints and light I want you to listen to me I am not a prodical son I am not a subordinate in God's kingdom I am not a subject in God's kingdom the baker is a subordinate the butler is a subject every little uh uh gopher as we call them here in the world every goer in the Kingdom there subordinates but I am not a goer amen amen but I am co-equal with the King [Music] I am a joint joint [Music] air but see why we don't like that sometimes is because we've got Pig pin mentality yeah we're like the prodical son we feel like the only way God loves us is if we got to get out in a big mess and do all this in the world and live like a bunch of devils and then come scraping back to God we feel that's the only way he's ever going to love us the only way he's going to have mercy on us is if somehow he takes p on us scum of the earth could you imagine a queen sitting up here in the castle and somebody walking up and saying I want a cake by midnight I imagine that king would speak up and say we have subjects for such work you don't speak to the queen in such a manner amen don't you understand why Jesus our daddy our King our our headship our husband don't you understand why he gets so mad when the devil talks to you the way he does amen amen do you think the devil is yammering on and Jesus ain't taking exception to it he's writing a book down of everything that long tongue says every word every accusation every Temptation everything he's ever said to you and don't kid yourself Jesus Takes exception to the devil talking to his Queen the way he does am oh Hallelujah Lord he'll let him Yammer on Yammer on Yammer on for so long and then after a while the Bible said that during the why years of the millennial Reign the Bible said God puts him in a pit and shuts him up Oh Glory let me tell you let him talk on but one day Jesus will shut him up hallelu I am not a subordinate amen I don't sit in the God's kingdom as a subject in God's kingdom the 144 thousands are servant in God's kingdom the foolish virgins those that toil outside the city all of that Bunch on the outside they're subjects in God's kingdom they're saved yes but God's redeemed property hallu is the wife amen the queen praise the Lord verse 13 WHO hath delivered us from the power of Darkness I don't know if y'all can handle this next part are you ready amen and half translated us amen into the kingdom of his dear son in case you haven't noticed that's a whole lot more than being saved right now notice verse 14 tells us how in whom we have what what remp not saving not being saved but we have red you can't make the Bible lie now brother it is what it is it says what it says and I believe it as it says it amen come on now amen so we don't have eternal saving but we have eternal Redemption how do we have Redemption through his blood even the Forgiveness or ephus the Greek word which is remission Deliverance Liberty release from bondage released from imprisonment y'all don't have to wait you can shout now if you need to Pardon and a pardon is not a pardon right and of sins it is to let them go as though they had never been committed amen hallelujah so my Redemption isn't just forgiveness but it's perfect Liberty glory glory to God this this this this this this this why you can walk up before the presence of the Lord stand right there and say hi God I love you praise the Lord amen nice to see you Jesus amen oh we don't have that view doing you know why because we got that that Reverend God's going to kill us at any moment View and we just walk up oh holy potentate of the ages great Ancient of Days I your humble worm I crawl to you in your presence could you imagine the queen sitting on the throne room and approaching the king and saying hey there hey hey there King don't kill me don't destroy me I I know I know I make mistakes every day he said shut your mouth you're the queen I don't care about that amen amen I know I do things wrong for he said shut your mouth I don't care about glory to God hallelujah he's not looking at your mistakes he's looking at your place he friends what more can I say to you this is the reason why we don't approach him right we approach him like oh God I am the worm I am the scum I am the good for nothing oh holy Ancient of Days don't destroy me could you imagine how Jesus sometimes listens to us pray and punches the Angels next to him and says when are they going to get it did they not realize my whole program is vested in them if I thought they were scum if I thought they was a worm I wouldn't hand my program over to them amen I wouldn't hand my mystery amen I wouldn't hand my mystery over to them but because she's my queen I say from he which is which was and is to come Shalom the revelation of Jesus Christ do you understand friends we're not subordinates we don't go to his presence and bow and scrape and seek to find favor with God we don't have to do that if God has ever filled you with the Holy Ghost you already have his favor amen all right I'm G to say something you might get mad at me but I'm going to say it anyways you know why we do a lot of that nonsense because we're trying to please our dead daddy or grandma or mama or somebody in our life or some husband or some wife wife or something like that and our subconscious is storing that scar down inside of our heart so we approach God the way we'd approach our daddy that never loved us right well praise the Lord the word amen in case you forgot say it I'm going to say it again say it again ain't going to hurt you say it again oh Jesus Lord I know that I've never made you proud your daddy or Jesus which one we talking about huh mama or Jesus which one are you trying to impress anyhow cuz when I read the Bible it says we've already found favor with him huh he loved us before we came while we were yet sinners praise the Lord while we were yet in sin and iniquity and transgression but Isaiah he already loved us so why do we scrape and Claw trying to find favor with a god we've already found favor with you know why cu the Revelation ain't struck you yet that Jesus ain't your daddy and Jesus ain't your grandpa and Jesus ain't your mama and Jesus ain't Obama and Jesus ain't llama and Jesus ain't other arm it is the holy ghost that found favor with you and you have found favor amen with almighty God you don't have to seek for it's already here thank you Lord oh but brother Ben if I don't come humbly and I humble is one thing showing him respect that's one thing but quit thinking of yourself as a servant quit approaching Jesus as though you have to approach him in servitude oh God I I'll give to you my life if you'll making a deal with God are we a little trade so you be a good boy and Jesus give you the good stuff huh when you're a bad boy he doesn't give you the good stuff you're bad so he's got to huh come on now that's our mentality of the Lord Jesus and you wonder why people aren't calling on him for boldness amen amen well praise the lord we sure had a good service this morning I'll tell you just this morning was wonderful this morning was just such a good service amen preach it brother Ben I think I will in spite of how quiet they get notice this Ephesians chapter 1 verse 7 now notice the Apostle Paul takes this same word and uses it again now watch in whom we have Redemption through his blood the Forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace so I don't just have God's pardoning Grace of my life to be saved but I have Redemption through his blood so the purpose of the blood was it spoke of redemption do you understand when Cain stood there and had no blood he was testifying he had no Redemption do you realize his very offering testified that he had no Redemptive value in the eyes of God Amen but when Abel slay that lamb and the blood went spilling down he was testifying I I have redeeming value in the eyes of God Amen I have redeeming value oh don't you know when Jesus shed his blood for you and I that's exactly what the Son of God was saying about you and I that we had redeeming value amen oh let me go a bit further and I'll try to close try try to close Hebrews chapter 9:12 neither by the blood of goats and Cales but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place I'm gonna let this come up before I read any further I want you to see it for yourself before I read it look at the next part having obtained Eternal Redemption for us there are no takebackspace and there can be no more Mercy for them I believe there's a spot the bride can cross over judgment where there is no more judgment against her but she is sealed by the Holy Spirit of Promise until the day of her Eternal [Music] Redemption so how how are you going to be in today and out tomorrow no somebody's lying to you amen somebody's telling you stories that ain't true amen amen once you are purged by the blood of Christ Oh Glory it's over over thank you Lord I said it's [Music] overall going tell you something friends I know the Holy Ghost led me to preach us tonight because every song tonight hit right on the same theme over and over and over over again I believe it's what absolutely God wants us to understand this notice verse 13 for the blood of bulls and goats and Ashes of heer sprinkling the unclean sanctify to the purifying of the flesh how much more shall the blood of Christ who through the eternal spirit the eternal spirit offered himself without spot to God Purge your conscience from dead Works to serve the Living God now listen if he is without spot if he was without spot and I get in [Music] him I with I am also with you are also without all of us that are in that blood are without spot and without wrinkle glory to God [Applause] hallelujah notice how Paul words this through through the eternal spirit he offered himself how did the eternal spirit offer himself he became a blood cell amen do you realize friends if the eternal spirit had not become a blood cell and there wouldn't have been a virgin birth Above This sex birth we were born with he would have been born in the same muck and the same mire as you and I because why because God made out of the ground every tree to grow and every tree can produce fruit and man had a fruit and so did the serpent amen amen so in order for God to recreate that generation he could not draw from the earth he had to create a new piece of earth oh Hallelujah brother B tells us in the future hm 8264 he said Jesus was the starting of the new heavens and the new Earth Hallelujah he was a new creation and from that spot of Earth he will recreate amen amen Hall oh my my my my my my my my notice in Hebrews chapter 10: 19 have therefore Brethren boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus now these next few quotes buckle up or don't buckle up they're going to be powerful either way you look at it I want you to listen what the blood of Christ does for you and I I behave myself up till now I don't promise you one more thing after that's these few quotes just give you my disclaimer so if I happen to run some of you over you won't sue me I know my redeemer Liv brother said that's the way sin is when it's dropped into the blood of the Savior it just isn't anymore amen it's gone he says no wonder he said it's in the sea of forgetfulness the tub of God's bleach it can never be found no [Music] more it just disintegrates hold on devil I'm about to hit you it's no more that's the way sin is once you see the real resurrection and the price that was paid for the resurrection oh brother B says isn't he wonderful amen amen amen he says now with our confession our belief and the confession of our sins believing all of our sins is in the sea of God forgetfulness he said he that will confess his sins God is just to Omit them amen amen so he remits then he omits [Laughter] Hallelujah Glory thank you Lord that was a good and Char as the world Amen he remits then he omits him brother R said there in the sea of God's forgiveness and never to be remembered again he said how many of you women know what bleach is a great big tub full of Clorox I am so glad that he didn't say it a tiny little thimble fo cuz my Jesus don't believe in thimble religion maybe some of these people out here believe in sprinkling but God don't believe in sprinkling he believes in baptizing come on somebody listen to me children listen to me tonight if you realize that God has a great big Wash Tub not a little bitty not a little tiny Bunch me and Sam was at a church not long back they had one of them big water and troughs for the C I mean it was a great big old Wash Tub I like to cut a rusty right there watching that tub oh my just to think that great big tub full of bleach that's what represents my father's blood and Grace Hallelujah he says you take one little eye dropper he said and take one drop of black ink and drop it into that bleach he says Watch What Happens it's gone am Amen brother B says that's your sin amen hallelujah all right now tell me tell me how are you going to get in the face of God if this doesn't happen how are you going to get in the face of God and ask him for one thing if this doesn't happen in your life you will approach him I'm a worm I'm scum I'm good for nothing because you know you're naked in his eyes but if you're you're forgiven as though it never happened you don't have to worry when you get up here his presence that he's going to find some little something on you listen the real True Believer when she does something wrong it's not a sin unto death anyways it's just a little stain that gets in her garment just a little spot on her dress Hallelujah just a little piece down on side that maybe a little mustard stained down the front Glory but when the bleach is applied he doesn't have to change the person he just has to get the stain out do you realize this is the very reason why when you do something wrong and you make a sin some of you people I tell you you're just like every other human being I've ever preached to the last 21 years of my life you'll go right back to the drawing board you'll erase all the years of service to God you'll erase all of his faithfulness all of your faithfulness you'll erase every little thing that you've ever done in his presence and you'll send it off as though it's just a bunch of off scour oh God I better start all over again no you don't when you got up this morning and come to church and you was invited to Wendy's or wherever you might have went and you got a little mustard staining on your tie did you say I better go get borned all over again I better go back and become a human being and do it all over again praise the Lord amen you didn't go back and say all right Mama I need to crawl back in the womb and get born all over again Lord you children are getting quiet on me but I'm going to preach it anyways amen come on now you didn't have to call back in the mama womb and become a human being to start all over again what'd you do you took that same old human body you take that same old ugly tie that you got from the dollar store and you walk up and you say honey I need some bleach amen cuz the person needs some bleach the person doesn't need a new birth they need bleach are any of you all hearing what I'm saying you don't have to run up and get born again all over you don't have to step right out there in the throws of God and say God birth me all over again you don't have to do that all you got to do is go back to that big old washtub than Lord oh oh I'm G to tell you if we was really Pentecostals we get with it here tonight you know what I'm saying I mean if we really was Pentecostal through and through I tell you we'd really to get with every one of us and get with it in the right way you know why we just don't seem to hit that spot of satisfaction when we're talking about this because we're scared to death that when we get out there on the street and make some kind of a mistake at work or whatever it might be we are scared to death that God is going to throw us back in hell but listen I am not preaching to you something that will be here today and gone tomorrow I am only identifying what already exist hallelujah praise the Lord thank you Lord oh listen this brother says stand right up over the tub squeeze it down and then look into the tub and find it that's why I like to tell the devil sometimes if you want to know what I done wrong I I challenge you to look into the blood of Christ and try to find my sin because if Satan's going to find it there's only one place my can go either it returns to me or it goes into that blood and once it goes into that blood I cordially invite the devil to go find it amen amen amen but it can't you know why because the sin the blood all becomes one thing oh oh listen he says when it struck that bleach it was so powerful that it just took the coloring right out of it amen that can never be anymore what is it it's gone yes it's eternally lost [Applause] hallu it's eternally lost how in the world are you ever going to go go back and find it when God himself can't even find it glory to God how are you ever going to find it yourself if Jesus himself can't find it I love this next statement I guess I've read this all over the country including home brother man says it's gone he said it's eternally lost he said said see what is it the ink itself becomes Clorox that's the blood of Jesus Christ to every confessed sin what is it it's forgotten it's done it's finished it's omitted it's divorced it's put away you know what I said I said every believer ought to take that quote and paste it in their purse and paste it everywhere and when the Devil comes back said you done say it's done it's divorced it's omitted it's forgotten HJ it's forgotten it's done it's finished it's omitted it's erased it's all put away it can never be remembered against you [Music] anymore now let me punch the devil real good and hard before I leave God and simplicity brother man said the coloring of sin goes back through those mediators and on down throughout the time until it hits the accuser Satan and it lays on him until [Music] [Applause] judgment so everything he's ever caused me to do every rotten good for nothing underhanded thing I've ever pulled in my life time and I'm sure I'm just like you there's a whole list you could put un next to your name everything Satan's everever tried to talk me into and things that I fell to all I have to do is repent tell Jesus I'm sorry amen and God says okay no wonder the devil hates you so bad he spends your entire life to trap you into something he thinks will be the end of you and at the very last moment you repent or make it right or whatever you do and Jesus Takes all that he worked to get against you and puts it back I don't get credit he does glory oh I wish I had twice my voice I'd shout twice as loud thank you Lamb of God thank you Lord Jesus brother says what happens to that son he becomes in perfect fellowship with the father he is standing on the other side of the chasm with no remembrance of sin against him when confess sin is dipped into the blood of Jesus Christ it kills all symptoms every molecule of sin goes back to the devil and lays on him to the day of judgment I love this statement listen to this I'll close brother says in Luke 63 he says when a man confesses his sin gets right with God God drops the sin of this confession in the blood of his own blood and forgives that sin and he replaces in that man the original spirit that should have been there wow Hallelujah beautiful amen his own Spirit making him a Son of God do you realize when Adam fell that what I should have come to the Earth what you should have come to the Earth with when we first came to this world we should have had the Holy Ghost when we came yes amen we should have been placed in this life with an infilling and indwelling of the Holy Ghost and Adam lost that infilling of the Holy Ghost so when I get the Holy Ghost God is only giving me what I I should have originally had already hallu oh my oh my man said making him a Son of God he said how much more ought the creative power of God be in the church he says amen it'll break down every wall of sin he said See it'll break it down completely amen and now I'm finished I'm done I'm completed L's [Applause] stand oh come on children let's do better than that hallelujah praise the Lord praise the Lord amen amen hallelujah glory to God glory to God praise the Lord loosed from our sins can you understand the difference between being forgiven and being redeemed somebody that's forgiven at the day at the second Resurrection the day of the Judgment there'll be those that will raise and there'll be many of them many of them that'll be given saving ability Jesus will save some of them as a sheep as a Shepherd would his sheep not that they were sheep that would indicate that there was a part of his Sheepfold in the beginning they wasn't and as sheep of God as sheep would he will give to them the saving value of being forgiven and gift to them the Holy Ghost they are not HS to it you and I are yes amen you and I are heirs to the Holy Ghost but he will give to some of them
