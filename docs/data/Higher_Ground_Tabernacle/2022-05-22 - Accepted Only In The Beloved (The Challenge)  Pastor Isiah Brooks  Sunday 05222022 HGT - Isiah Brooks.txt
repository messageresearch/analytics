appreciate everybody who's here this morning we want love divine love to be the essence the power in this place should be illuminated with the love power of god and uh we appreciate once again everybody that's here this morning i'm excited only because i know in whom i believe we are at a place in time where we must understand who we are and what we are and the purpose for which we were born we have sought this for so long and uh it's been on us right with us but now it's time to embrace your message [Music] not just to study it but it's time to become it and the only way that you can become this message you have to know the messenger and that's christ jesus himself as we stand let us turn to second peter we're gonna read there in the first chapter of second peter the 11th verse 1-11 second peter 11 1 and 11. you know i love the lord and he's so perfect in all his ways how many of you all enjoyed uh the ministry of um our brother ben i i was so blessed to know that god not only loves me but every fault i've had to deal with he ordained it but he's given me power to overcome it and i love that i love that you have no idea what that did for me because i inquired of the lord i know other things could be worse but i personally inquired of the lord and i wanted to know you know why out of all the things in the world uh uh i had this particular battle in my life and through the ministry of our brother ben he was helping me god answered my question and totally set me free from what condemnation yeah what almighty god we serve amen so we're coming by the grace of god god from ii peter the first chapter and we're going to read only the 11th verse for so and entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our lord and savior jesus christ [Music] the first chapter and we're going to read uh from beginning at the 6th verse to the 14th verse [Music] and it reads to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he have made us accepted in the beloved in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sin according to the riches of his grace wherein he have abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he have purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of time he might gather i love that together in one all things in christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in himself in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will i really like that after the counsel of his own will i love that 12th verse that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in christ which excuse me in christ in whom ye also trusted do you trust him after that you've heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation in whom also after that ye have believed ye were sealed with that holy spirit of promises [Music] which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory thank you for your patience let us pray lord jesus christ which as our brother saying this morning we are the temple of god and lord jesus we thank you father for not being a million miles away but lord you have chosen to abide within us and our father who art in heaven hallowed be thy name lord you are the holy one lord your elohim you are the god of self-existence and because of you we are here it's by your own thoughts we were created and we were made in a in your lovely name jesus christ our lord amen you may be seated we just thank god for uh i'll tell you his goodness and if i would have like a subtitle i would entitle it the challenge [Music] the challenge i trust everybody know what that word means but whenever there is a challenge there is an opposition and you hear me say this all the time we're also not against flesh and blood or spiritual wickedness in high places our enemy as it was since the beginning has always been satan not your brother not your but um i'm not here to just preach on that as the bride of jesus christ we must refocus throughout the years since brother branham has been off the scene we have lost focus the very thing that we were to overcome a denomination that works in organizations and denominations has grabbed a hold uh many of those who claim to be believers lost vision of who they were and the purpose for which they were born it got worse every age if i could say it became more deceived remember brother branham said it like this he said the lutherans were spurring off of the catholicism and then the wesleyans now the power of the holy ghost was now restored or being restored to the church but they failed they came short so much so the bible described the laodicean church age as blind and naked and wretched with but then god pulled out of that pentecostal church because god delivered israel out of egypt but egypt was still in israel of all ages we have more word than any age in more word than any age in in in ephesus age but can you imagine how long it took for those letters of paul to circulate to the various churches hallelujah but the thing in which they had was greater than silver and gold because even though they didn't have even before paul came meme avant paul new zealand hallelujah but paul came to do something he was an extension of the ministry of jesus christ but you can tell everybody it was jesus christ citizens that lived in paul do you have a victory on paul we come to fulfill a purpose and i'll come back to my thought here the denominational of who jesus christ you understand me that spirit is the thing that you and i must be careful about see this priesthood like this once the bride of jesus christ [Music] but let's go back beyond before then with jesus christ he was considered considered a devil because he was against the traditions of the elders the tradition and jesus exposed them in saint mark jesus exposed to mark he let them know it is a face of war it's not the food that goes in that defiles you hallelujah but he said it is the thing so jesus was saying to the pharisees you're a hypocrite that's what he said he said you put all of these laws and all these isms and all these schisms on the against televisions and then they got a big one in the house now we we don't want to realize this but we were free brother branham never left apostles for us he never left a group of ministers to say follow them. but since he's been gone we've had ministers to raise up many people follow [Music] not because of a testimony will follow people because they have a gift of healing hallelujah some people follow them because they might have a little discernment yeah hallelujah but not the reason to follow a man hallelujah he said brother books i don't believe that yeah the same system system you were to overcome can you devote that we failed to do so zombo now i'm going to tell you something random the pentecostals warned them him to join them wanted him to join the baptist wanted amen and let me say it like this yourself you're going to be a virgin unto the word you must you must be in contact with the virgin hallelujah listen let me say it like this because i'm a cut to the chase this one why did we need another message let me say it like this because some of y'all don't believe why did we need a new testament [Music] is that a monkey so much so brother branham called them pentecostal children he could not be delivered unto them the outer practice hallelujah just as predestinated as malachi 4. that's right the victory that god gave us the victory see what we we do just like denominations we judge each other we criticize each other we try to say who's going to make heaven and who's not can i say it but did paul need salvation hallelujah me and mine not the early church they had so much love for each other right but many times people are bringing somebody new into the church they may not look like you may not be dressed like you know immediately you want to clean the fish immediately go catch your own alley and if you catch your own you can help make sense so let's go on so you can understand how fallen we are book of companies call ourselves the bride we say i'm bright i'm gonna hit this but we said oh i believe in conduct and orders no you don't no one word broken uh one word broken and i'll tell you what that one word is jewish scripture church on time i just tied it all together so my point is i'm on point you can't point your finger secondly ain't none of us so if we're going to make that a law i'll see where we come late we just so you know that ain't going to save you you can be the church every day every second because he didn't come a few minutes late sometime he'd come out okay but god was dealing with him as long as you're late and god is dealing with you let me move on i'm taking my time this morning try not to be too much longer but let me just read you a quote coming from is your life worthy of the gospel brother said look at polycarp he said that's life worthy it is sadly look what paul said in the book of hebrews the 11th chapter who got the scripture didn't even worship he said they were sawed asunder is it pulled apart is it a dictionary wondered about it and gold skins don't leave listen when the stock market crash the stock market you don't have water you don't have food to you know your clothes get ragged we don't know how long we've got to go through this he'll be able to love him still hallelujah there you are that's life is worthy of the gospel how is mine and yours going to stand come on in my day of judgment and don't tell me that's a long time ago because jesus said one thousand years um as one as unto the lord is is one day let me read you another here you know and satan's son will be sealed in the last days so you're going to be healed you're going to be that all that did not have glory of god [Music] because he did not have the holy when you got christ on the inside of the curse see what i'm trying to say excuse me said this brother said i fear what i'm doing that the churches are you're not getting the people to christ and one thing about that you cannot force oh all the darkness is turning today hallelujah he says well he said yeah he said the mark of the beast began the god and everything that these churches have given to us and we've lived by it with salvation that's not cinepassa even brother branham told uh uh brandon tabernacle and probably what i'm doing you got to be born again you got to receive the holy ghost hallelujah is that right even before he left he says something's happening here i'm paraphrasing he said we used to have miracles here and the people would into you see so because you've been so used to well i'm telling you what to do because you obey them you're going to hell that's the people where they're getting it from these people god will do he broke down every tradition he could break down they had the people in bondage washing apart the the washing of parts literally brought death to them what do you mean did jesus ever break his words because absolutely but he broke the traditions of men you said what are you saying he how could he talk to her come on but not in the order of the leviticus priesthood is hello somebody they don't need [Music] listen i know what i'm talking about jesus they got an eighth angel and with him they got an eighth angel in europe with him angel won't the real eighth angel stand up huh there is an eighth yeah and with him what is jesus christ himself this is because remember the eternal god well when you know maybe i'm not the one a potential surprise but there's coming a one heck yeah coming down we needed this message this is the only message that would give you a rapturing of faith he hasn't had her revival yet that was when he was living right now the bride is in revival excuse me because a lot of times passed away revival [Applause] hallelujah systematic worship systematic will kill you you say how i know i've allowed the satan to succumb me to that on the event because when the spirit of god move on you okay it don't move you won't move unless somebody else moves but listen i don't care if you're the only one god comes down and anoints you for wine give him the praise give him the glory that god how do you know you become systematic because you won't read your bible you won't read your i'll pray until it's about time for church you know what i'm saying some of us in bad shape but we claim to be the word and this tree is a double has grown around the pole [Music] and it looks like the pole is is in the tree is you have never heard a snake until you come up against wine you don't even know he's there you could be standing there foreign [Music] has affected a lot of people in the in the message they're so only dying and they don't recognize it's death let me go on i know i know just help me i'm trying to go as fast as possible now you say what brother books what are you saying preached messages and david and goliath it was showing the condition of the church we have seen a lot of message preachers is but we can never defeat them if we feel like they're greater than us if we're ashamed of our message huh if we don't if we don't testify honestly i i don't know a person too long without letting him know that i'm a christian james but i want you to understand that this message has come together wisdom that's what paul said in we did not come to be another organization or denomination we came to be him louie come on somebody let me say like this week you better make sure they got the holy ghost but systematically we do the same thing mainly i'll marry you hallelujah if you message it to me you met this and this girl is just constantly draining him and taking him down the tube and i told him you got to get rid of her then oh but i love her oh mr lam i'll say which one you love the most god of this girl that's funny in it it's a holiness and i said you got to make a choice blew up i saw him the other day he would just she lives i'm like you asked me and i told you do what you want to do you know i'm i'm forgive me the slain but i do what people say i say yeah go ahead you do you scripture if that's what you want to do and do it this is the secret truth listen people here you'll never see me acting like a nicoletto that's everybody i've learned the hard way [Music] you love the lord second thessalonians quickly let me get your thought over here this morning uh you know listen i'm not here to form another little message church performing by god's grace i don't think i have any enemies because that's what jesus did that's the scavenger israel and i don't do it because i have to julie i would love because i wanted it because it's part of me to do something i don't have a hatred bone in my body i really don't i don't i don't know anybody that's just the holy spirit that's true i said why now well what about all those people they talk about you put the jeans so many things said about me i got thick skin when it comes to that you know to be honest with you i don't care it's easy but i can't help it because i know where i come from anyway let's move on i'm trying to get us to see the traditions of men do to you fondue you know how can brother branham lay out a law come on people and then tell you to break it eve now he'll come and he says okay selling service 30 45 minutes but then again he'll say you ought to at least get out of order enough to get long enough to get the holy ghost huh at least ought to get out of order long enough to get the holy ghost you don't understand what i'm saying it's going hard oh i'm sorry somebody help him no i'm trying to make sense to that i don't know french probably but my point is you want people to hear you wanting to understand and so i i say this to you i'm trying to get you to understand [Music] [Music] because all of us come from different churches and many of us are carrying the same kind of bag that you had over there i love this message and i understand what god has done in 1963 the change in brother bannon's ministry there's a time he preached to the church but then there was a time he switched preaching to the bride only hallelujah because he said those who are not of god they will get they'll kick the tapes out but you gotta be and you and i must go on to whatever hallelujah do i have more time let me say this y'all i didn't nobody how to say it anything but i said yes i do i do great now remember if there was anybody that was legalistic and god chose him god chose paul do you have issues with them out in the desert for three and a half years [Music] to be identified hallelujah the early church was called jesus it pleases you is that right sure paul said saul said this what the lord it's hard to kick against the prick see you where was jesus he was in the people he was in the christians he was and you and i cannot even imagine the synagogue is not holy some perspective i'll say no no because no ye are the temple of god hallelujah you mean to tell me all the feasts of faith sacrifices those were fighting but that was jesus in him breaking all those traditions hallelujah he didn't stop there love you sitting amen and see that's what people don't understand in this message racism where is the holy ghost that cylinder white church is this there this is the don't say concealer should never be labeled when i pass through the church in line 95 and i had an old sister come to me and i had javi being a black man casting a white church that's what i saw i said i thought we were all washed in the blood that's nonsense this is nonsense hmm hey it's the truth and then sometimes we think we're better than some other races how can you say i'm better and when that life is coming through that's real worship saul yeah he now we look at this and you and i must understand who's in the world four thousand years man hallelujah and on the day of pentecost it was a great thing you have been gone it was a change of something is that right when when when they honor the leviticus priesthood and all of that there comes another creature news and if you've got any kind of understanding you'll know that the ministry of william branham to bring in the news because it was a new testament y'all understand me the components remain right god's spirit was so invisible what happens after malachi 4 was it malachi was hundred years i think because jesus came on the scene without a vision the people perishing so men you know whatever they thought was right in there what we do not understand [Music] hallelujah because on the day of pentecost he was more concerned about this house so you can understand i'm not trying to tear anybody down and so at the end of the day all i found you're going to understand just like i said when you get to these places and folks expect you you to bow to them get away john now if you come in the bow or however you figure you want to have prayer that's that's what i'm not talking about how we all used to take off our shoes when we went to prayer come on but uh let me let me let me bring it the reality the the gravitation of this thing if the book is opened and the seals have been revealed it has come down this time the gathering of the people and if that be the case let me ask you something personally [Music] you can't never say that a certain dress we have a code that and i'm not saying holiness and holy dressing just deepak you got to understand where brother branham he was in a time when america was chaotic martin luther king he was moving in the realm of socialism to socialism ask the holy ghost these demonic don't come [Music] but it cannot [Music] but as long as you're in these systems no you don't want to sit on your system you don't go to my church i don't want it jesus and your preacher don't preach like my preaching [Music] um i want you to look up and see what all what kind of laws brother branham but he didn't tell you to do one thing maybe make sure there's so i'll have to do i have to do the rest later so that you understand that god has done something you drafted and many of us say oh we praise god he's done something that the devil is mad with because of fact that we are accepted in the beloved son he he's mad because we have a revelation that my sacrifice has made me free sacrifice he's mad because he we understand seriously no condemnation why are we afraid of goliath that's the challenge let me ask you one more question i don't care how much conduct and order you have committed adultery told you about the iphone i mean it was just something probably the ipad the ipad hallelujah come on somebody you know nobody can be with you but god hallelujah and i'm telling you now people of god we're we're living so beneath our privilege god can't use us like he wants us to want to use us ourselves the seals will open more consecrated and if he had to be more consecrated to perform the act or be there when god did what he did you got to be more consecrated no con of mine will be able to understand what i'm talking about you know especially when you start talking about preachers but i'm a preacher so i know but i'm not here to rule none of you suppose and if you think i'm here to rule you do anything you are totally wrong in this capstone message only love will prevail in this capstone only the bride will prevail we don't have time to fight and as long as we got little sex in the message however i was i i remember being an apostolic church that apostolic church wasn't a part of our apostolic church the rule was you couldn't go there and you were talking about going there you were stepped down for doing such a thing you know spectacular and that same stuff is in the messages that's why you need to study for the v2g and you need to listen for the equity and if i preach anything that you don't understand first lord show me what brother brooks says and if you could ever prove me wrong is he true you're welcome apparently know the protocol though there's a protocol you don't come with your finger right that's not the way you get anything from god you love the lord there's so much and i i kind of chewed it up a little bit more you understand me the bible said do unto others as you would have them to do unto you the word can never be broken if you have a problem with one another you know mcdonald's go buy somebody a good steak or something show people how much you love him last week last month i meant to make this announcement i don't know how we're going to do it [Music] [Music] because a lot of us don't know each other we know each other by faith but we don't know each other's names and so even if you got to make your own name tags messages [Music] you know i i want to wipe out every little ism thing in your mind that we may have traditions traditions keep us separated we've never and paul says we have to fight about the unity of our industry i'm sure she would love the help we need to find a place to have it or we can have it out here in the vegetables normally we all can't fit in here but graduate into the spiritual lord you've been so good to us i feel like i chopped your message up so welcome cg perhaps next time i'll be able to finish let the people see [Music] i want to see your holy spirit i want to see your power moving this church not not just the preacher but everybody and i know lord god that i ask gotta ask everybody that after the service [Music] those people know who i need to have the meeting with this is so what i'm trying to say is a prize y'all know what private means [Music] and uh we thank god for god and and and the lord we just thank you for all that he's doing for us you love the lord amen anybody need prayer how many you got something to do made herself ready take touch my lips here [Music] take me in by the blood of the lamb [Music] take me into the holy [Music] touch my lips here i am [Music] take me in by the blood of the land take me into the holy of holies take the coal touch my lips here i am oh take the cold touch my lips here [Music] take me in by the blood of the lamb take me into the holy [Music] take the coal touch my lips here i am once oh again me into the holy of holies take me in by the blood of the lamb oh take me into the holy of holies take the coal touch my lips here i am oh take me into the [Music] take me in by the blood of the lamb [Music] touch my lips here i am oh take the cold touch my lips [Music] beside the highway begging his eyes were blind the light he could not see he clutched his rags had shivered in the shadow and jesus came and made his [Music] darkness when jesus comes the tempter's power is broken when jesus comes the tears are wiped away [Music] for always change when jesus comes to stay from home and friends the evil spirits drove [Music] he dwelt in misery he caught himself [Music] when jesus comes the tempter's power is broken when jesus comes the tears are wiped away [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] disease [Music] [Music] jesus [Music] [Music] when jesus comes to sleep so men today have found the savior able they could not call [Music] lonely jesus came and dwelt himself with amen when jesus comes is broken when jesus comes the tears are wiped away he takes [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] the tears are wiped [Music] is over when jesus comes to stay once again so man today i've found the same you're able [Music] [Music] when jesus comes the tempter's power is broken when jesus the tears are wiped away [Music] glory for always when jesus amen god bless you amen if we would again clear the church and if you can meet it's okay to meet but let's meet outside those i think there's a nice grassy spot over there
