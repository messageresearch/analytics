[0:00] he took bread and blessed them and break
[0:03] them and gave to them and their eyes
[0:05] were opened and they knew him and he
[0:10] vanished out of their sight and they
[0:13] said one to another did not our heart
[0:16] burn within us while he talked with us
[0:19] by the way
[0:20] and while he opened to us the scriptures
[0:23] and they rose up the same hour and
[0:26] returned to Jerusalem and found the
[0:29] eleven gathered together and them that
[0:32] were with them saying the Lord is risen
[0:35] indeed and have appeared to Simon and
[0:39] they told what things were done in the
[0:43] way and how he was known of them in
[0:46] breaking a bread one more scripture
[0:53] let's go to Isaiah 40 please read the
[1:03] tenth verse their tenth and eleventh
[1:06] verse of that particular chapter Isaiah
[1:10] 40
[1:27] behold the Lord God will come with
[1:31] strong hand and his arm shall rule for
[1:35] him behold his reward is with him and
[1:40] his work before him he shall feed his
[1:44] flock like a shepherd he should gather
[1:48] the Lambs with his arm and carry them in
[1:52] his bosom they shall gently lead those
[1:56] that are with young let us pray Heavenly
[2:01] Father we come before you we thank you
[2:05] for such a great day that you have given
[2:10] to us we thank you for being so real and
[2:15] father without you we are nothing you
[2:19] have been out all in all and we realized
[2:24] in all things everything we're together
[2:28] for the good of them that love God we
[2:32] thank your Lord for being real to us
[2:35] Lord we thank you for everything
[2:37] bless the service that's the heart of
[2:40] these young men who come up to hear your
[2:43] tonight I pray that you would speak a
[2:44] word a word of encouragement to the
[2:48] young men as well as to us those of us
[2:50] who are remain bless us now we pray in
[2:53] Jesus Christ's name we pray in Jesus
[2:55] name Amen
[2:56] you may be seated as I was thinking and
[3:00] by God's grace and like I said I trust
[3:03] that the Lord will bless you tonight I
[3:06] think I was thinking about how sometimes
[3:09] we we really don't see how perfect his
[3:14] salvation is how sometimes we struggle
[3:19] because we don't have a definite I would
[3:26] I say a a vindication or the kind of
[3:32] vindication we want from God to define
[3:37] who we really are
[3:40] but I know one thing that that in this
[3:44] day and age the only reason why you're
[3:48] here tonight is because God brought you
[3:52] here and even to our young brothers who
[3:56] have come all the way from Iowa City
[3:58] don't come in vain because God brought
[4:01] you here God's Way it's so simple
[4:07] sometimes we fail to see his in his
[4:10] leadership have you ever gone by
[4:14] somebody's house and they were so glad
[4:17] to see you and they thought oh I just
[4:19] prayed that the Lord would send somebody
[4:21] by my house or I just prayed that God
[4:24] will have somebody called me or
[4:26] something like that and all of those
[4:28] things don't seem to be simple it's
[4:31] really in the hands of God or in the
[4:34] plan of God every jot every tittle every
[4:38] hair on your head is already numbered he
[4:42] as we were saying not long ago you know
[4:45] in this scientific world we find that
[4:49] they're in their science they're always
[4:51] trying to offer man a long life to live
[4:57] well if you take this pill or if you do
[5:00] this or do that you'll live longer but
[5:03] that's nonsense that's really contrary
[5:06] to the world you can be healthy and die
[5:10] you can be kind of on a sickly side and
[5:14] still live because our days are numbered
[5:18] from the time of our birth to the time
[5:22] we leave out of here
[5:23] those days are exact God doesn't erase
[5:28] any any time and we find out that every
[5:32] time God is ready to do something is
[5:35] it's perfect it's not according to man's
[5:38] clock it's according to God's clock a
[5:42] lot of times you you we look at these
[5:45] things and hit my my my subject tonight
[5:48] is by His plan it's not about you it's
[5:54] what
[5:54] makes God happy it's where God gets the
[5:57] glory he gets the glory out of us and
[6:02] regardless of how we may look it may
[6:05] look like it's not going just right God
[6:09] is the great Shepherd he knows how to
[6:13] lead us and one thing I know about sheep
[6:17] and I'm not just gonna preach on sheep
[6:19] and sheep trusts their Shepherd wherever
[6:23] the Shepherd goes to sheep will follow
[6:25] and they won't hear another voice they
[6:29] have in tuned their selves to his voice
[6:32] only if we could be sheep like that that
[6:36] could only tune our voice into his voice
[6:40] into us where that we would only hear
[6:42] him but the thing that I was thinking
[6:45] about was that how many times it it's in
[6:51] an inner in a way of a story God would
[6:54] tell us and he come by says well Mary
[6:57] was at the well and an angel showed up
[7:02] and it wasn't like Mary came to the well
[7:06] and the angel decided to show up
[7:11] but God ordained those actions to take
[7:15] place even though Mary wasn't aware that
[7:18] she was going to meet an angel that day
[7:20] but in God's mind he had already laid
[7:24] that plan out
[7:25] he knew what Mary was going to say every
[7:29] word that Mary uttered God had already
[7:32] seen it
[7:33] even though Mary didn't know the next
[7:36] verse or the next line in her
[7:40] conversation God knew every jot and
[7:43] every to know God knew when she says God
[7:46] how can this thing be when I've never
[7:49] known a man
[7:50] see that's God I love the open he he'll
[7:53] bring men to their own intelligence so
[7:55] they could ask questions so he can
[7:57] answer them and then Mary said to
[8:01] herself you know
[8:02] however this thing be Lord let it be
[8:05] according to thy word
[8:08] it was God's plan that day to meet Mary
[8:11] you understand what I'm saying
[8:13] when you got saved you just didn't get
[8:16] saved because all of a sudden you thirst
[8:19] for God you thirst for God because God
[8:23] gave you the thirst and at that
[8:26] appointed time he had already he could
[8:29] have given you he could have given you
[8:31] the Holy Ghost or he could have saved
[8:32] you at the moment you thirst but God
[8:35] allowed for the thirst to increase
[8:38] because there's a certain measure of
[8:41] thirst
[8:41] you must have before God can answer see
[8:45] sometimes you say oh I'm thirsty well
[8:47] not really because you can go on another
[8:51] hour to or however but when you're
[8:54] really thirsty or thirsting for
[8:57] something it's painful it's got I got to
[9:01] have it it's if it can become almost
[9:04] what we call it insane craving I gotta
[9:08] have it
[9:08] I would actually kill for it you
[9:11] understand me those kind of thirst and
[9:14] when a thirst in you overcome it is God
[9:18] none of us get thirst after God except
[9:21] God gives you the thirst
[9:23] the scripture says no man can come to
[9:26] God except God draws him when when it
[9:33] came to our a Jacob Jacob though he was
[9:37] a sight you don't it makes you wonder
[9:39] why God Lord why didn't you just go
[9:41] ahead on and give it to Jacob why didn't
[9:43] not Jacob come first but God showed you
[9:47] that even in the wound there's a battle
[9:49] and there's a battle with Jacob and Esau
[9:51] right there in the womb showing that
[9:54] even in your in your field you'll create
[9:56] it is creating you or bringing you in a
[9:59] place of a fall you were gonna always
[10:02] have about them from the womb to the
[10:04] grave amen I guess you you because here
[10:10] you had Esau and Jacob and you gotta you
[10:13] got you got in your in your right now by
[10:15] God's grace you have the old man and the
[10:18] new man Paul say kill the old man every
[10:21] they kill him right because you got to
[10:24] realize Amen that only one can live they
[10:27] can't both live at the same time only
[10:30] one can live but God planned it that way
[10:34] see because he want to see want you to
[10:37] see how much he cares and of course you
[10:40] got to understand you and I could never
[10:42] love heaven and love God except we come
[10:45] this way not in the way God wants us to
[10:49] love you right
[10:51] because love has been has never
[10:52] demonstrated it's not sound well how I
[10:56] know you love me well what did you do
[10:59] for me what way did you express to me
[11:02] that you love me right
[11:04] so understand by God's grace that love
[11:07] is not just words flowing out of your
[11:09] mouth oh I love you it is an expression
[11:12] and in that expression is a life in that
[11:15] life is God's life that life is a
[11:19] surrendering life that life is not a
[11:21] pride for life that life will give up
[11:23] everything to make you live right God so
[11:27] loved the world that He gave His only
[11:29] begotten Son but when I was thinking
[11:31] about that I thought about how I
[11:33] preached just last week on dimensional
[11:36] things see because we don't realize that
[11:39] God is watching right now he is the
[11:41] all-seeing eye he sees everything he
[11:44] hears our thoughts you kick you can't
[11:48] get no one that could be as great as
[11:50] years and when I say that I mean he
[11:53] cares in the sense that he knows every
[11:56] move you're going to make huh think
[11:59] about the scripture in that while we
[12:02] were yet sinners Christ died for us
[12:07] now think about this now how much God
[12:11] hate sin and sin his unbelief God hates
[12:16] it he hates the attributes of it and yet
[12:18] his love for you and I was so powerful
[12:21] that's why I say we need a server before
[12:24] Thanksgiving right because you and I
[12:27] must understand that God is not playing
[12:29] with your salvation
[12:31] maybe brother Brooks will make it maybe
[12:34] he won't
[12:35] you know I'm hoping he will know your
[12:40] salvation is solid is sound right
[12:45] yeah if God is giving you eternal life
[12:48] he cannot take it back it's sound
[12:52] it was so sound he wrote it in a book is
[12:56] that right I'm jumping almost but I'm
[13:00] saying all of these things because when
[13:03] we read the story and we find Amen that
[13:07] here was after the resurrection how
[13:11] Jesus purposely found those disciples
[13:17] now he didn't have to call nine-one-one
[13:20] I look up on some kind of diction area
[13:22] or since I'm kind of radar out excuse me
[13:26] he knew exactly where they were but my
[13:30] wonderful thing the wonderful thing the
[13:32] work the thing I love about God is that
[13:34] he could have automatically opened their
[13:36] eyes but you know a lot of times the
[13:39] Lord allows you to hear your heart God
[13:43] knows what's in your heart but sometimes
[13:45] he allows circumstances that come in
[13:48] your heart in your life so that you can
[13:50] utter whether what you believe or
[13:53] whether you disbelieve you bring
[13:56] yourself in his presence sometimes your
[13:58] anointing just come and you don't even
[14:00] know it's there on auntie you understand
[14:02] me and all of it all of a sudden you
[14:04] said oh god father forgive me I you know
[14:08] I didn't mean to do that and you know
[14:10] all of a sudden you know conviction
[14:12] comes on you when it should have been
[14:15] there all along but it comes on you at a
[14:18] time when you think you forgot know you
[14:20] failure to say you know mean do the job
[14:23] that you're supposed to do and then God
[14:26] God y'all know what I'm trying to say
[14:28] things that you should have gotten right
[14:30] or should get right all of a sudden God
[14:34] brings it back to your mind oh you know
[14:38] Lord I'm so sorry you know what and
[14:40] you're in most of the time we don't even
[14:43] recognize or realize that God is the one
[14:47] that brought it up
[14:49] now you could say Lord I ain't
[14:51] apologizing to that sister because she
[14:53] needs to apologize to me now you're
[14:55] talking to yourself who you're talking
[14:56] to
[14:56] oh I'm talking to you myself no you're
[14:58] not God is engaged you in a conversation
[15:03] and you're talking back to God in that
[15:06] way and you don't even know it you're
[15:08] not talking to yourself you talking to
[15:11] somebody see because he's done it you
[15:14] know and sometimes those waves those
[15:16] vibrations hit you in a certain way and
[15:18] then you began to talk thinking that
[15:21] you're talking to yourself and you're
[15:22] not hmm think about it how they will you
[15:29] know on their way to Emmaus and they
[15:32] said they've broken it hard and then
[15:34] they ask God where have you been you
[15:38] don't know if what has happened in
[15:40] Jerusalem and he lets him go on with
[15:42] that foolish talking and then he began
[15:45] to expound the word to them right here
[15:48] is all your gone to hell
[15:50] only legalism somebody say something say
[15:53] something to me the other day there's
[15:55] two types of hearts there's a stony
[15:57] heart and there's a heart of flesh
[16:01] legalism when it's the wrong wrong way
[16:06] of being legal is engraved in stone
[16:13] grace is in the heart of flesh because
[16:20] when you find a man that's so legal that
[16:22] he's actually condemning everything and
[16:24] everybody he doesn't even realize
[16:26] because of his the condition of his
[16:28] heart
[16:28] he's already condemned and that's the
[16:33] way God could have condemned them but he
[16:34] didn't he this is old foolish and hard
[16:37] you know have you not believed all that
[16:41] the scriptures have said but you see
[16:44] what do you mean that was a lesson they
[16:46] learned now after the resurrection he's
[16:49] still teaching them who he is and he's
[16:52] still giving them time to repent time to
[16:56] clean up hallelujah
[16:57] ha because they got him way they gotta
[17:00] meet him sometime
[17:01] on the day of pentecost why he does it
[17:05] that way is all this pleasure it's for
[17:08] his own good will
[17:09] why do God allows us ain't meant to get
[17:12] sick sometimes I thank God you said what
[17:15] do you mean and all things give things
[17:19] and I think God because even in this
[17:22] little call through whatever you want to
[17:24] call it and then what it has been the
[17:27] Bible says God healed him and as they
[17:30] walk on their way it manifested
[17:33] sometimes we just have to have faith
[17:35] that we are healed and as we walk it
[17:38] manifests itself it may instantly go but
[17:42] the you know is going to go because
[17:45] God's Word says with the stripes we heal
[17:47] is God's pleasure sometimes the only way
[17:52] he can get a real good sincere prayer
[17:54] out of us is to afflict us sometime now
[17:58] I'm looking at everybody so I don't
[18:00] think I'm throwing off I'm just trying
[18:03] to tell you that you and I are not in a
[18:06] position where God is not mindful of
[18:09] every condition in every state you're
[18:10] going through I was thinking about some
[18:13] of the young people there and I was
[18:15] sitting praying the other day that not
[18:17] only God gives them a green card but
[18:18] give them the citizenship they want you
[18:21] know I was thinking about that because I
[18:23] was talking to somebody about it and I
[18:25] said Lord I said I just prayed that you
[18:27] do that the devil says well you know
[18:28] according to trump we don't worry about
[18:30] Trump
[18:30] they say Trump's playing when God does
[18:34] something he does it all and he does it
[18:36] right you understand me
[18:40] no the Bible tells us that in all things
[18:43] he says listen we are more than
[18:46] conquerors through him that loved us can
[18:51] you be persuaded tonight I know that
[18:54] sound really simple but it's God's plan
[18:57] how in the world I got to Iowa from
[19:00] South Carolina I always marvel at that
[19:04] cuz I hate women I hate the cold
[19:08] God didn't say had to love it no he
[19:11] didn't I respect it because
[19:15] has a plan every season has a plan it's
[19:18] a reason for every season so I have to
[19:22] respect it but I marvel at how God has
[19:26] such as far as I'm concerned he has such
[19:28] a sense of humor and I'm telling you now
[19:32] if it wasn't for me and some others the
[19:36] winters up here would probably be more
[19:37] fierce than with it cuz I know God
[19:41] answered my prayer many times and others
[19:46] but I always says Lord I'm not trying to
[19:50] take away from what you're trying to do
[19:51] whatever you need to do with your
[19:53] weather do it not my will but thine be
[19:58] done
[19:58] right so we look at these things and you
[20:01] said well I am persuaded that neither
[20:03] death nor life nor Angels nor
[20:06] principalities nor powers nor things
[20:07] present nor things come what may Paul
[20:10] what made him able to say that what was
[20:14] it because he's on the pilla fire or was
[20:17] it you know because he he had a UH a
[20:20] great aptitude and a mind where he could
[20:23] study and remember the Scriptures no he
[20:27] met Christ and he knew that the Christ
[20:30] that was in the pillar of fire that
[20:32] spoke to him that day was no longer only
[20:34] outside but inside he understood that he
[20:38] had a seal that could not be broken that
[20:43] the promises of God are yay
[20:44] they could not be broken Paul says
[20:47] nothing can separate me whatever I go
[20:51] through and I'm telling you Paul went
[20:53] through some suffering let me tell you
[20:58] something when you find a person that
[21:03] gets some hardship in their lives and
[21:05] they go back into the world they never
[21:08] loved him
[21:09] they never met him like Paul Manning
[21:13] because every time Satan tries to accuse
[21:16] my god hey I find no father if anybody
[21:22] ought to be suffering it's me I'm the
[21:25] sinner God is
[21:28] and look at his mercies towards me how
[21:33] can I find fault in a God that loves me
[21:36] the way I am how can you with God who
[21:41] keeps you alive who feeds you and and
[21:44] gives you strength keep you healthy look
[21:47] around you there's so many people who
[21:49] don't have and yet in his plan he
[21:55] planned for you to be healthy hallelujah
[21:59] and you know what he guarantees you your
[22:01] health by placing you into the gospel
[22:04] because he knew that if I can get a
[22:06] people in the gospel no matter what kind
[22:08] of disease might try to strike him they
[22:11] will overcome because they know my word
[22:15] and they believe my word that's in his
[22:17] plan his plan
[22:18] amen is here for us to live a prosperous
[22:21] and healthy life it doesn't mean that
[22:25] you're not tempted and try your sons and
[22:28] that's what God is looking for real sons
[22:30] and daughters of God that's gonna stand
[22:33] on his word regardless to what Paul said
[22:36] I am persuaded that means nothing can
[22:38] convince me otherwise I am persuaded no
[22:43] matter what or height nor depth nor any
[22:46] other creature shall be able to separate
[22:48] us from all the devil the devil can not
[22:50] separate you once that union is there is
[22:54] there eternally hmm
[22:59] lead you about says he shall feed his
[23:03] flock like a shepherd he gather the less
[23:06] with its arms and carry them in his
[23:08] bosom and I love that about God because
[23:12] sometimes we stumble sometimes we fall
[23:15] sometimes we get weak and I tell you
[23:18] what you know what he does he doesn't
[23:19] kick you
[23:20] he carries you and every one of us can
[23:24] say here tonight that God has carried us
[23:26] at some point in time more than once
[23:29] times when we thought we couldn't go any
[23:32] further
[23:32] when the tests and trials were so
[23:34] overwhelming you said Oh God but then
[23:37] there's always a word of comfort think
[23:40] it not strange when you fall in to die
[23:42] temptation knowing that the trying of
[23:44] your faith is more precious than gold
[23:46] and knowing that God is working
[23:49] something out in you and you don't even
[23:51] know what it is but at the end of the
[23:53] day you're still bow down and says he's
[23:55] Lord and king of all think about it and
[23:59] this is what if we could get in them but
[24:01] people's mind how often times people
[24:03] wonder will I make it well in reality
[24:09] I've had that question and I've had God
[24:12] to answer for me right off the tape but
[24:15] my thought is is this is this will I
[24:19] make it we ask that question will I make
[24:25] it it is I've already made it
[24:29] I've already made it you understand it's
[24:32] not will I make it you've already made
[24:35] it when you pass from death unto life
[24:38] you've already made it but we think we
[24:43] look at our frailties and our little
[24:45] fleshly little things in and think oh my
[24:47] god this could hinder Paul says nothing
[24:49] can separate nothing can separate me oh
[24:55] you said what what do you mean it was
[24:57] God's plan for Saul to mess up God knew
[25:02] that Saul was gonna mess up as a king
[25:04] before Saul was even a king
[25:06] Sam you knew this man being a man he's
[25:10] gonna mess up and saw was the people's
[25:12] choice and because he was the people's
[25:17] choice
[25:18] God knew he's gonna mess up but give him
[25:19] a king anyway right but did God kicked
[25:24] Saul out of his economy because he
[25:27] messed up he even even ripped Samuels
[25:30] that was worthy of death I'm excuse me
[25:34] you know yeah a garment and you and you
[25:37] think to yourself you said all
[25:38] presidents what's going on but God says
[25:40] all you rip the the garment of Samuel
[25:44] and the kingdom is ripped from you but
[25:47] was he lost absolutely not and we think
[25:52] that God is so I don't know
[25:56] emotional like a man well you know if
[25:58] you don't treat me right I'm gonna send
[25:59] you to hell there's a lot of people who
[26:02] didn't treat God right and didn't go to
[26:04] hell so I didn't do right David didn't
[26:12] do right every man has done God wrong
[26:16] some way or another and yet he saves us
[26:21] anyway
[26:22] because it's his plan to save you your
[26:25] names were written in the Lamb's Book of
[26:27] Life before the foundation or this is
[26:29] why the people who said we believe this
[26:31] message ought to be the happiest people
[26:32] in the world
[26:35] rejoicing always should always be with
[26:37] us he said what brother was what you
[26:40] saying let me say God has steps that he
[26:45] carries us he could have he could have
[26:48] given the disciples all come follow me
[26:50] boom you got the Holy Ghost he could
[26:53] have given them that in the beginning
[26:54] but he worked with them for three and a
[26:58] half years if I could say like that and
[27:00] they did not have nothing but the Holy
[27:03] Ghost on their flesh that old nature was
[27:06] still living in them and can you imagine
[27:10] a God as holy as Jesus you don't say
[27:14] here disciples you trying to teach in
[27:16] the right way I know it I know somewhat
[27:19] a little bit how you trying to teach
[27:20] your children the right way and the next
[27:22] thing you know they fussing and fighting
[27:23] and Carol and a brother just takes me
[27:28] the other day he takes me the other day
[27:31] he said brother Brooks do you think my
[27:34] children's ears were put on backwards
[27:36] when we were teaching him the truth he
[27:39] said you think when they get older they
[27:40] get wiser and he just left it to him I
[27:44] said old brother don't worry I know
[27:45] exactly what you're going through
[27:47] because you know I'm sure God you know
[27:52] he says not to talk this boy haven't
[27:54] told him how many time and you know what
[27:57] you and I ought to be so thankful that
[27:58] God blood covers iniquity not just
[28:03] seeing iniquity and Nikoli is when you
[28:07] know to do good and you still don't do
[28:10] it
[28:10] right the Holy Ghost will warn you and
[28:13] say something and you'll Fletcher take
[28:15] you anyway see that's you've never
[28:17] experienced that before oh yeah but
[28:20] that's what Paul says you got you gotta
[28:22] kill it if you don't pray and keep that
[28:25] thing on the submission you think that
[28:26] old man is gonna be holy in making that
[28:29] only about this beast and he's gonna get
[28:33] you every time you neglect to pray and
[28:35] keep consecrated he's got a trick for
[28:38] you that's the old man that's the
[28:40] serpent
[28:41] I gotta see it right on the brother was
[28:48] talking about that the other day and I
[28:49] said that's where the real shame comes
[28:51] in when you know to do good and you
[28:53] don't do it oh yeah oh yeah you're right
[28:59] but what what secures us is that he's
[29:02] predestinated us he's Podesta nated us
[29:07] to be sons and daughters of God children
[29:10] of God of children with the Jesus Christ
[29:12] himself what according to it what good
[29:14] will and pleasure it's God's pleasure he
[29:19] said what oh the devil might knock you
[29:21] down for a few rounds amen but you know
[29:24] we always win the battle you know every
[29:27] day we win the battle every day because
[29:31] all you have to say is Father forgive me
[29:32] Lord cleanse me Lord feel me and you're
[29:36] right back where you started you don't
[29:38] need the devil don't like it but we got
[29:41] advantage of him we got an advantage
[29:44] over him and that is the blood of Jesus
[29:47] that's our advantage that no matter what
[29:52] sin we do and what unbelief we have in
[29:56] us at time God's blood still justifies
[30:00] us hey Roman process and brethren we are
[30:07] debtors not to the flesh to live after
[30:10] the flesh for if we live after the flesh
[30:12] we should die but if he through the
[30:15] spirit do mortify the deeds of the body
[30:17] you shall live now if there is it any
[30:21] debt we have a debt toward the whole
[30:23] period we have a situation where we need
[30:27] to let live live the life is what I'm
[30:30] saying we all God could I say like that
[30:34] we hold him our lives and we ought to
[30:38] will it willfully give him our lives but
[30:41] the Bible says it like this for as many
[30:44] as are led by the Spirit of God they are
[30:47] the sons of God right for ye have not
[30:51] received the spirit of bondage again to
[30:54] feel like it overcome you've already
[30:59] overcome you like that little crow a man
[31:02] Johnny crow Johnny crow why are you why
[31:05] don't you come I just can't because I've
[31:07] been going around the circle and God has
[31:10] already cut the card you gotta go you
[31:14] gotta yes go free you got to realize a
[31:16] man that the blood of Jesus Christ
[31:18] Calvary has got every cord of bondage
[31:22] every chord that's his plan that was a
[31:26] blood plan right Redemption by blood
[31:31] Redemption by power see once you can
[31:35] Slade that's the plan but now God wants
[31:38] to see the power of the blood in your
[31:40] life that's his plan that's his plan is
[31:47] that right
[31:48] listen prophet of God said in proof of
[31:52] his resurrection in the Providence of
[31:54] God's great eternal plan of salvation
[31:57] how that in time past when God made man
[32:00] to be a worshiper he loved himself he
[32:02] made him that way that he could he would
[32:06] have a desire to worship and all down
[32:09] through the ages man has loaned to look
[32:12] at a past the captain that hain't
[32:15] between him and where he is going he
[32:19] began to quote the king of England st.
[32:24] Augustine in 80 603 he said when King of
[32:28] England was baptized in the name of the
[32:31] Lord Jesus Christ by st. Augustine
[32:34] sitting at a great fireplace one night
[32:37] while he was talking to him about Christ
[32:40] a little sparrow flew in the into the
[32:43] light and fluttered around a little bit
[32:45] and flew out and st. Augustine said to
[32:48] the king he said where did he come from
[32:50] and where did he go - he said that's the
[32:53] way that every man that comes into this
[32:56] world he comes in here walks in a
[32:59] conscience of senses not knowing exactly
[33:01] where he comes from and there's only one
[33:04] book that can tell him where he's going
[33:08] - and that's the pipe on and by that the
[33:12] King was converted and gave his life to
[33:15] the Lord and the next morning he and all
[33:18] of his household was baptized in the
[33:21] name of the Lord see is she once a man
[33:25] see you don't have to slaughter man with
[33:27] Scripture
[33:28] give him something that he could see a
[33:31] reality something that he can just see
[33:33] that there is a God see cuz everybody
[33:37] know everybody want to know where they
[33:40] going and where they came from thank God
[33:44] for this message it's not that God comes
[33:47] along and do things that but but God's
[33:53] Word being God His Word is always tested
[33:58] God allow tests to come upon his own
[34:01] word that's what makes him God because
[34:06] he knows whatever he says it cannot come
[34:09] back void it will accomplish no matter
[34:11] what the adversary does or would do to
[34:14] try to stop the Word of God for being
[34:16] fulfilled
[34:17] excuse me it will come to pass
[34:23] not one word that one word can fail how
[34:28] God did that between the Old Testament
[34:31] and New Testament he spanned his plan of
[34:35] salvation he hosted up the ensign of God
[34:38] God was healed none other than the son
[34:41] of God to join man ant and to God man
[34:44] and to God it was a time tested he
[34:48] tested it through the seed of Abraham
[34:50] Oh down through Isaac Jacob Joseph
[34:53] down through David on down to the end
[34:56] until the perfect seed come that would
[34:58] stand in the middle and hold sinners or
[35:01] one in and God on the other and bridge
[35:04] the way and see that's why people think
[35:07] they can make heaven without Jesus but
[35:10] Jesus Christ is the bridge he is the one
[35:13] that will you know what God ordained
[35:15] that was his plan right and you and I
[35:18] when we realize that's why I don't
[35:20] understand Trinity how they want to put
[35:22] three guards in in this in this equation
[35:25] because God is such a just God he could
[35:28] not have sent somebody else to die for
[35:30] us he had to come himself and when God
[35:35] came himself he became the British he
[35:39] said find that find that in the Old
[35:41] Testament when Adam and Eve fell who
[35:44] became the bridge
[35:45] Jesus himself the voice walking in the
[35:49] cool of the Endon he was the one that
[35:51] brought the skins he was one that
[35:53] brought the blood in him hallelujah he
[35:56] was there at the beginning he's there
[35:58] being there's no way around is so
[36:01] perfectly plain but what did Adam and
[36:04] Eve them do they you see what I'm saying
[36:06] what did Adam and Eve do for God to do
[36:11] what he did when God has said sedated
[36:12] you surely you eat of this thing you
[36:14] should surely die
[36:15] what was it I tell you what it was
[36:19] nothing they do nothing do you don't see
[36:23] it in the scriptures when they were
[36:25] crying out for God Oh God it was God's
[36:30] plan you didn't look for God God look
[36:34] for you when you started looking for God
[36:36] it was when God put something in your
[36:38] heart to look for it we love the world I
[36:41] don't ain't nobody out that can say they
[36:44] didn't love it as long as it was going
[36:46] good you loved it but God was one this
[36:49] God making it go bad you didn't know
[36:51] that he was turning it up everything
[36:56] uncomfortable Amen so then he could put
[36:59] you put a cry in your heart for him God
[37:03] did that
[37:04] interrupted your life your wonderful
[37:07] life God did it he did to me he started
[37:11] to everybody and we reason this is the
[37:16] greatest enemy this mind you got to get
[37:19] rid of it I'm telling you you can't
[37:21] process God here God is only known in
[37:24] the heart he's only known in the heart
[37:26] when you think that you can outsmart God
[37:29] a little little little imp you know what
[37:31] I mean
[37:31] you know being sassy we God raising up
[37:34] his fists and you know God I got that
[37:36] you don't even have to put much pressure
[37:37] to it you know that much my thing is I
[37:40] just don't understand how men who can't
[37:43] even control their breathing can think
[37:46] that they got control of their lives it
[37:50] makes no sense to me you don't control
[37:54] that God controls it and I don't care if
[37:57] you say Oh breath don't leave me when
[37:59] God says that's your last one that's
[38:01] your last one don't make no difference I
[38:05] rich you how how famous you are you know
[38:08] I mean let's see how much control me and
[38:10] half of their lives now when death comes
[38:12] right every piece of God is right
[38:18] everything that's written in this Bible
[38:21] I believe willing to lay down my life
[38:23] for it I may not have faith enough to
[38:27] make every promise come to truth but
[38:29] I'll never stand in somebody else's way
[38:32] who does have faith to do it if I can't
[38:36] walk where Enoch walked with me and went
[38:39] home without dying I wouldn't stand in
[38:41] somebody else's way who could walk that
[38:44] way with God that's right it's dying
[38:48] tested and I believe that every word of
[38:50] God is pure and unadulterated so he what
[38:54] is he saying time is testing you time is
[39:00] testing you are you gonna continue to
[39:01] walk with God you walk with Him step by
[39:06] step like Enoch did it doesn't mean you
[39:09] don't make my space but walking with God
[39:11] makes you perfect
[39:17] huh yes this salvation is perfect and
[39:21] you think Oh God Lord am I going to get
[39:24] the Holy Ghost if I gonna get it the
[39:26] Bible says if you repent and be baptized
[39:29] in the name of Jesus Christ you will
[39:32] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[39:34] that ain't no ifs ands abide now God
[39:37] determines when he wants to give it to
[39:39] you and none of us can make it we can't
[39:43] make it happen but one thing I know if
[39:45] you ever get desperate enough you get it
[39:49] but where does the desperation come from
[39:52] absolutely make me desperate you see
[39:59] like I was telling her brother the other
[40:01] day
[40:01] I'll not be satisfied until I see all of
[40:06] Christ in me the fullness of my measure
[40:10] you understand me
[40:12] the fullness of my measure the measure
[40:14] that he has in me and when I how would
[40:17] you know because once that happens you
[40:20] will experience a complete satisfied
[40:22] satisfied satisfied satisfaction a
[40:30] complete satisfaction you said what were
[40:34] you doing brother boots you hate how
[40:35] they talk or whatever could see I know
[40:38] I'm healed
[40:39] and the devil and his line vanities is
[40:41] trying to say I'm not don't be scared of
[40:44] me for other brothers or sisters this is
[40:46] just lying bandit easy there's no
[40:48] sisters out there but anyway I look at
[40:50] these things and I said Lord I know what
[40:53] your word says not by power not by mind
[40:57] but by my spirit I want my brother's to
[41:03] know I get I'm encouraged I get really
[41:05] encouraged when when young people
[41:07] stirred up for the Lord that encourages
[41:10] me I love that I got saved when I was
[41:15] young and I'm telling you the fire has
[41:21] been burning ever since and I was one of
[41:24] those ones got out there on that corner
[41:27] and paid played my tambourine and saying
[41:28] and witness the people back
[41:31] I'm all kinds of times of the day at
[41:33] night I even had a key to the church so
[41:36] I can take him up there baptized I don't
[41:39] even know where they are this city but
[41:41] it was narrating my business God's
[41:43] business the people in my school said
[41:45] you know that Brooks guy he done went
[41:47] crazy they were so right but it wasn't
[41:50] me it was God and my thing is when I see
[41:54] young people like our brother Frank in
[41:56] different ones and a really stirred up
[41:57] about the Lord
[41:58] I just really get excited because I know
[42:01] what could be time with such talent now
[42:07] here we are who gonna instruct God who's
[42:11] gonna say to God who gonna say to the
[42:13] Lord you know Lord you know why didn't
[42:17] you make me this thus and the other let
[42:19] me read something to you brother Branham
[42:23] had nothing to do with who he was God
[42:29] did that and I'm gonna read something to
[42:32] you to prove my point
[42:33] you had nothing why aren't you dead
[42:37] why aren't we did you know here God
[42:40] brings me from all the way from Lyme and
[42:42] then brings you all from south from
[42:43] Africa and what why are you here
[42:46] what is there's a purpose behind this
[42:48] now it ain't just to save your natural
[42:50] life there's a purpose it wasn't here to
[42:54] to save my natural life there's a
[42:58] purpose you let's put it this way when
[43:00] God had Joseph and Mary to go there to
[43:03] Bethlehem it looked like they were going
[43:06] there just for the taxes but there was a
[43:09] child to be born in that city right so
[43:12] there's got to be some spiritual thing
[43:14] that God wants to do here for you that
[43:17] he couldn't do that see and you got to
[43:22] realize you got to search for it you got
[43:24] to look for it now Lord you brought us
[43:26] here and whatever the purpose is show me
[43:30] see that's why I'm here I'm not here to
[43:33] be in just about a pastor in Ohio I
[43:35] didn't come here just to be a pastor I
[43:38] was that before I came here
[43:40] there's a purpose and I don't care
[43:44] the group gets there's something that
[43:47] God is trying to show you stop looking
[43:50] at your earring ways that is not it
[43:53] it's the commission that God is trying
[43:56] to give us you can always be faulty in
[44:00] some way until God stops that until he
[44:04] comes and bring you to the perfection
[44:05] that he wants you to be in you're gonna
[44:07] still struggle until then but we don't
[44:11] stop fighting we don't stop struggling
[44:13] because we realize God is doing
[44:16] something in the inward man there's a
[44:18] plan and that plan is being fulfilled in
[44:21] every one of our lives no matter what it
[44:23] looks like you think brother Branham
[44:35] wanted to be what he was he didn't want
[44:40] that he didn't even want to be a
[44:42] preacher but that was God's choosing
[44:46] just like it's been God's choosing for
[44:49] us the morning of listen says listen I'm
[44:54] talking I'm a sovereign grace because I
[44:57] can tell you there have been several
[44:59] times I should be dead and yet I'm not I
[45:02] wasn't even a Christian when I was seed
[45:06] and that was what God protected see the
[45:11] morning up there in the mountain when
[45:13] they opened up the cabin door little old
[45:17] door it was a window it was a little
[45:19] door juh you push out and didn't have
[45:22] any glass in it push it out a light a
[45:25] light about so big around come rolling
[45:29] in and went down over the bed where
[45:31] mother was holding me in her arms that
[45:35] aren't adulterated that without
[45:38] unmerited grace that was God seeing
[45:42] nothing you can do or nothing I can do
[45:45] he says that's God's plan
[45:49] he gave me toe Jeremiah I chose you I
[45:52] elected you I did this you we didn't do
[45:56] nothing it was spiritual it was small
[45:58] if we're if we've got a gift of
[46:00] discernment you didn't do it God gave us
[46:03] that that's his plan and his plan is
[46:06] that if we have certain gifts all of
[46:09] these gifts is for his glory
[46:11] I wouldn't let brother Branham get out
[46:18] of it we really visit him
[46:21] they don't whatever you do don't don't
[46:23] don't mess around with women don't don't
[46:25] drink no wine and stuff like that and
[46:27] don't don't smoke he said there were
[46:30] times I wanted to do it you don't know
[46:33] that he wanted to do it he was dentist
[46:38] and all of a sudden that thing goes
[46:49] nothing can do what nothing can do
[46:51] nothing you could I can do that's God's
[46:54] plan it's got to be just what he says
[46:57] see he's determined if you notice gifts
[47:01] and calling is without repentance he
[47:04] said you believe that Jesus Christ was a
[47:07] woman see from the Garden of Eden that
[47:09] was promised you believe that it was
[47:12] show that sees your bruise the serpent
[47:15] I always think God is a God I said if
[47:18] I'm the least in heaven I still thank
[47:21] you because you didn't make me a Judas
[47:29] I'm glad to be who I I think are for
[47:34] every trial every test you know we can
[47:37] look back in our lives and we can see
[47:38] things in our life that we may have
[47:39] gotten into and wish we would not have
[47:41] but let me tell you something God didn't
[47:43] make a mistake in that while we were yet
[47:46] sinners he saw that he could have
[47:49] stopped every time every time you did
[47:51] sin he could have stopped it like he did
[47:53] brother branham he could have done it
[47:56] you and I just as important but you know
[47:59] why he wants to make something out of
[48:01] that in that great Judgment Day when
[48:04] people stand there and says Lord I just
[48:06] couldn't overcome you said come on over
[48:08] here brother what did I work what tell
[48:11] us tells us your testimony
[48:13] however lord I was in labor seeing I
[48:16] just could do hey I've got a group of
[48:18] people up here who come through later
[48:20] see I can tell you they overcame here
[48:23] they see yeah so no man will have an
[48:26] excuse you're not just sitting here
[48:28] doorman like without a purpose your
[48:30] presence will judge just your presence
[48:37] when you'll stand with Christ see he
[48:42] couldn't eat he listened Moses he
[48:44] couldn't help because he he was Moses he
[48:47] was both Moses is that right John the
[48:49] Baptist seven hundred and twelve years
[48:52] before he was born he was the voice of
[48:55] the one crying in the wilderness but I
[48:57] say the Prophet is that right Jeremiah
[49:00] God told Jeremiah said before he was
[49:02] born I knew you sanctified you and
[49:04] ordained you be a prophet over the
[49:05] nation before you even come from your
[49:08] mother's womb and Jeremih as far as I
[49:11] was concerned he had one of the toughest
[49:13] jobs a prophet ever had yeah he an easy
[49:17] kill I don't know those people are so
[49:19] hard hard and so backslidden reprobated
[49:22] and everything else and I can you
[49:25] imagine every altar call he called
[49:27] nobody couldn't even get a tear from
[49:30] their eyes it was so hard and listen let
[49:34] me tell you something the devil can so
[49:36] get to a person where they become so
[49:39] delusional until they think that what
[49:40] they're doing is right and that's
[49:42] exactly what happened to Israel they
[49:44] mess around with the more advice and all
[49:46] these other kind of ice and all of a
[49:48] sudden now then traditionally doing
[49:50] exactly what they're doing and don't
[49:52] even know they're wrong it took it
[49:54] Elijah just bring a separation from the
[49:58] right and the wrong in Israel right
[50:02] because you know Bailey's Lord and here
[50:05] there was his Oh Lord you said that
[50:07] can't be happening it's happening now
[50:09] people calling Lord under the
[50:11] inspiration of Trinity and they think
[50:13] that's Jesus Christ and it's not go
[50:18] don't look bad at me cuz I was there
[50:20] but it took a word to make me know that
[50:23] there's a God of Elijah and there's a
[50:25] god called
[50:27] that's under disguise of Trinity read
[50:30] study or histories it's there you know
[50:37] you got the Arabic God have mercy you
[50:41] know people don't mean to be ignorant
[50:43] but without a vision the people perish
[50:45] if God doesn't bring a prophet if he
[50:48] didn't bring a prophet we would all be
[50:50] in darkness right now because it's God's
[50:53] plan to bring a prophet to bring the
[50:56] word according to Amos that's the only
[50:58] way we can get it and you know like
[51:03] people don't understand you know I might
[51:05] not worship the Prophet but I show thank
[51:07] God oh my god I do honor him cuz I
[51:13] realized what he went through
[51:14] see right now we see things we see
[51:17] what's happening we can look in the
[51:19] audience and call it out right well
[51:22] brother Adam saw like I tell people I
[51:24] said don't y'all know when brother
[51:25] Branham was preaching the message as he
[51:26] was preaching everybody looked like
[51:28] Christians most of the women 90% of the
[51:30] women world war dresses most of them in
[51:33] my day didn't wear makeup most of them
[51:36] still was really women feminists you
[51:38] know right now oh you better know what
[51:48] you better get you a church girl that
[51:50] you know you've seen her grow up in
[51:51] church because out there you don't know
[51:53] what that what you're covering with your
[51:54] package you know it's the truth
[51:56] hey let me move on by God's grace
[51:59] because I don't have much longer but I'm
[52:01] saying you could not help you were born
[52:04] just the way God wanted you to be you
[52:07] think why why did God choose Thomas and
[52:11] he knew Thomas had problems with faith
[52:16] because he knew that was awake some
[52:18] Christians would but it did not exclude
[52:21] them he knew that some Christians was a
[52:25] hand on thing sometimes they got to feel
[52:28] it sometime they got to touch it but
[52:32] once he met the real God you never hear
[52:35] of Thomas ever doubt the game
[52:38] but he was a Christian and to that point
[52:41] everybody have their stages to walk
[52:43] through right I mean you can Sosa's same
[52:49] rain comes the same sunshine and all of
[52:52] them don't sprout at the same time
[52:56] wonder what that is
[52:58] cuz God didn't ordain for all on the
[53:01] prowl and so so is it with Christians
[53:04] all those blah blah 'some and gloom at
[53:06] the same time we just don't do it he's a
[53:09] god of variety you're like that now let
[53:12] me let me hurry up I'm a closing just a
[53:14] minute yeah I just got one more quote
[53:16] but when we see by God's grace and this
[53:18] is what I want to say to us before I
[53:20] forget Thanksgiving should be something
[53:23] we do every day and all things give
[53:26] things sometimes we just forget even in
[53:30] your trials and you test when you can
[53:34] hold your integrity and says I know God
[53:36] is working it out for me I may not be
[53:39] able to see it but thank you Jesus you
[53:41] know I'm gonna tell you something praise
[53:43] they take you a long way with God a lot
[53:46] of times people don't realize that
[53:47] grumbling and mumbling more you get into
[53:50] more trouble but when you begin to
[53:52] praise God for the harmful things that
[53:55] seem to be coming upon you thank you
[53:57] Jesus thank you for that thank you for
[53:58] this thing for that he knows what you
[54:01] and he'll get you come out of that thing
[54:03] and you see that your enemy has become
[54:05] your footstool yeah that's the way God
[54:10] works you he love praise he loved most
[54:15] of all when we trust him and I love the
[54:19] way that scripture says trust in the
[54:20] Lord with all your heart see that's what
[54:22] he wants he want for trust from us in
[54:26] him no matter which way he leads us and
[54:29] that was one of the things that that
[54:31] Joshua and Caleb could do no matter how
[54:33] bad it looked and how many people fell
[54:36] before them they kept trusting the god
[54:38] of Moses all right listen
[54:43] prophet God says like this and I'm
[54:45] leaving this would be a last one there's
[54:47] a big dark shadow setting yonder before
[54:50] us
[54:51] called death and every time our hearts
[54:54] beat we move one step closer to that one
[54:59] of these days it's going to take its
[55:02] last beat and we're going in I want to
[55:07] be at that at my time make my lot as I
[55:11] hope every one of you is tonight when I
[55:15] know that is it's laying just before me
[55:18] and I have to meet it I don't want to be
[55:21] a coward I want to be wrapped I want to
[55:26] wrap myself in the robe of his
[55:28] righteousness walking into it knowing
[55:31] this that I am sure that I know him in
[55:34] the power of his resurrection that's
[55:37] right see not just my power by blood
[55:41] powered by powerful powered by resurrect
[55:43] you need the rest
[55:44] that's what Paul says I don't want to
[55:45] just know him in the suffering I want to
[55:47] know him in the power of his
[55:48] resurrection
[55:49] that means when I die I wouldn't come
[55:52] right gonna be wrapped myself in the
[55:56] role of this righteous walking to it
[55:58] knowing this that I am sure that I know
[56:00] him in the power of his resurrection
[56:01] that's right
[56:03] that when he calls from among the dead
[56:06] I'll be called out with them that's a
[56:08] living God is a God of the living now as
[56:13] they journey in this land we found out
[56:15] that God made a plan for them he brought
[56:18] Redemption by the blood then we find out
[56:21] he brings Redemption again by power he
[56:24] we found right before last night before
[56:28] last that he had the blood applied which
[56:31] was very beautiful type of the believer
[56:32] that when he has accepted the death of
[56:36] Christ in his instead that he becomes a
[56:39] child of God he starts on his journey
[56:41] that don't you know a lot of Christians
[56:42] haven't done that they have not accepted
[56:45] Christ as they stayed that's why they
[56:49] still struggle struggle with em I say
[56:51] will I be saved because if you accept
[56:55] Christ in your place it's already paid
[56:57] that's sure that's assurance there you
[57:01] know what I'm saying it's assurance
[57:02] there you accept the
[57:04] as your savior he took your place so you
[57:08] you he died for you so you cannot die
[57:11] that's it so you say okay when you do
[57:16] that that that's an assurance but
[57:18] there's a lot of people in in this
[57:20] message who haven't even done that and
[57:22] they fall and they struggle in a you
[57:24] know in and out all kinds of stuff but
[57:27] it's because they have not accepted
[57:29] Christ as they say because when you do
[57:32] that you'd pass from death unto life I
[57:35] was telling a brother your dad said
[57:37] don't you know that's why the foolish
[57:38] virgins made it they weren't dead they
[57:42] were alive they it they were redemption
[57:49] by blood they gave their lives to Christ
[57:54] Redemption by power because they were
[57:57] able to be sanctified but they didn't go
[58:00] by the redemption of the Resurrection
[58:01] they needed a resurrection in them they
[58:04] needed the Holy Ghost in them to get
[58:06] them up but they go through the spirit I
[58:09] don't know how God works it out all I
[58:11] know is that the foolish virgins appear
[58:14] at the white throne judgment with the
[58:16] goats
[58:16] and it's God who has to separate them
[58:21] think about it because really brother
[58:24] answer like this you either receive the
[58:25] mark of the beast or the mark of God see
[58:30] so they didn't receive the mark of the
[58:32] beast because they had the blood of the
[58:35] Lamb not in his full measure and that's
[58:39] the problem a lot of people don't have
[58:40] it in the full measure but God cannot
[58:42] say you're gonna die when he said you've
[58:44] already passed from definitely life so
[58:47] god that's an honor his word they come
[58:50] up and they get eternal life but that's
[58:55] a white throne judgment see and people
[58:59] don't want to believe this but I said it
[59:01] like this you know if it's the same
[59:02] material made out of the same material
[59:05] means the same message people in this
[59:09] message you're not going all the way you
[59:13] understand me they won't be they know
[59:14] what he says divine nature they know
[59:17] that when brother Brown preached the
[59:20] statue of a perfect man they know we got
[59:22] to get there but nobody's working with
[59:24] it ah because we've had brothers come
[59:26] and they tried to make it works you got
[59:30] oh you know what I'm saying y'all know
[59:32] what I'm saying
[59:32] they made the statue of Christ works
[59:35] it's not works it's God building you not
[59:41] you building yourself
[59:43] he is the carpenter no man can add one
[59:47] cubit to a statue but when we see that
[59:51] the brick is not laid right we know how
[59:53] to pray God add to me and when you ask
[59:59] God for that expect trials is that right
[1:00:04] when when Israel was rebuilding the
[1:00:07] world they were in battle they had a
[1:00:09] scalpel or whatever one went hand and a
[1:00:12] sword in the other same manner that
[1:00:14] everybody was trying to stop him from
[1:00:16] building the wall so when you're in a
[1:00:18] build when you building God building you
[1:00:20] you're gonna go through a lot of trials
[1:00:22] you gonna go through tests but it's it's
[1:00:25] worth it all but that's God's playing
[1:00:28] and that's the only way we'll make her
[1:00:31] righteous by that plane I've been in the
[1:00:37] message sturdiest and what did you do
[1:00:38] with it when God is trying to build a
[1:00:43] house in you and we're so busy building
[1:00:47] Isles and building innocent bill at
[1:00:48] least David said Lord I've done all
[1:00:50] these things and the Lord is without a
[1:00:52] house even it's not that Scripture
[1:00:57] the Bible said the Fosters alcohol and
[1:00:59] birds have nests but the Son of man have
[1:01:00] no place to lay his head I preached that
[1:01:02] years ago I preached it years ago and a
[1:01:05] brother called me only brother you're
[1:01:06] wrong the gap stone has come down I said
[1:01:08] I'm not doubting that but where is it
[1:01:13] what lives do you see it he wants
[1:01:17] somewhere he can lay his head he wants
[1:01:20] to have headship over us as individuals
[1:01:24] the operation is here is already here
[1:01:27] it's in the atmosphere but God wants
[1:01:30] somebody who's willing to allow him to
[1:01:33] build his house right David was so
[1:01:40] worried about building God a house God
[1:01:42] says no I'm going to prepare a place for
[1:01:44] you that's where I am there you might be
[1:01:49] me all so is this okay now let me just
[1:01:56] closes out now God made manifest that he
[1:01:59] had given them life through the death of
[1:02:01] the Lamb now he's going to show them
[1:02:02] physical Redemption hallelujah see both
[1:02:05] of salvation and healing see for the
[1:02:07] natural man in the spiritual man that
[1:02:09] their angel passed over proving that God
[1:02:12] had made a way of escape through the
[1:02:14] offering of the blood and they accepted
[1:02:16] it now it is going to make our way of
[1:02:19] escape from the physical death like the
[1:02:23] believer also as soon as he gets say
[1:02:26] maybe a cancer excuse me has eaten him
[1:02:29] up or some disease
[1:02:31] God has redemption also through power
[1:02:34] the same answer me as he has redemption
[1:02:37] up for the Soul he has redemption for
[1:02:40] the body so see all the blood of Jesus
[1:02:44] Christ is to cover three parts of you
[1:02:47] your body soul and spirit the whole land
[1:02:52] is supposed to be saved and you know and
[1:02:54] I know we know that this this soul has
[1:02:57] been saying in the spirit amen god gives
[1:03:00] us a new spirit to put our whole egos in
[1:03:01] that spirit right redemptions for that
[1:03:04] to par but the last part God does it
[1:03:07] himself
[1:03:08] God gives you new body ah the new bodies
[1:03:13] waiting for you it's not that you know
[1:03:16] God ain't making heart making you now
[1:03:18] he's already made you hallelujah
[1:03:23] she is God's plan
[1:03:25] so we ought to say thank you Jesus my
[1:03:28] prayers this Lord I told somebody the
[1:03:31] other day I says I don't have no doubt
[1:03:32] in my heart I'm saying I've been saved a
[1:03:34] long time really in my knowledge you
[1:03:38] know what I mean I've been saying when I
[1:03:40] gave my heart to the Lord and everything
[1:03:41] I was saved right then and there God
[1:03:44] proved it all the way through but that
[1:03:46] ain't any what I'm pressing for I've
[1:03:50] been called according to the voice of
[1:03:52] Matthew 25 Malachi 4 we've been called
[1:03:57] to a rapture we are the elect lady the
[1:04:00] special class of people right we hear it
[1:04:03] all the time don't get frustrated in a
[1:04:07] sense when you feel like well Lord I
[1:04:10] don't have the Holy Ghost like I want it
[1:04:11] you got it like God wants you to have
[1:04:13] and at that time when God get ready to
[1:04:17] change you he's gonna change you if your
[1:04:19] faith is steady because without faith
[1:04:22] it's impossible to please God right
[1:04:25] Abraham can hold on to his promises for
[1:04:27] how long huh
[1:04:29] oh there he held on to it no priest 127
[1:04:35] years all right cuz God said he was
[1:04:37] going to rain he knew his job went over
[1:04:39] till it rain you know and you look at
[1:04:42] ourselves and we said we Abraham see I
[1:04:44] don't care if I'm in my last moment of
[1:04:48] living on this earth all of a sudden God
[1:04:50] packed me with the seal good enough
[1:04:53] Karina you know because it's not up to
[1:04:58] me when he was because there still
[1:05:00] thinks he might want me to do when I
[1:05:02] said this number y'all might not like
[1:05:04] this but there are things that God knows
[1:05:06] that down the road I might not hit this
[1:05:08] hit it just right but that that not hit
[1:05:12] it right might affects something else
[1:05:14] everything we do affects something
[1:05:16] whether it's positive or negative it's
[1:05:19] going to affect something right I mean
[1:05:23] you got to realize and then that even
[1:05:25] Simon when Simon wouldn't even watch
[1:05:27] Jesus feet say hello to him and nothing
[1:05:30] like that did you know that was still
[1:05:31] orchestrated by God and when God came to
[1:05:33] Simon house it wasn't just to see Simon
[1:05:35] he knew that every who's coming he said
[1:05:39] right there in a place where she could
[1:05:42] see him from where she was she knew he
[1:05:45] knew the horse he knew it that day he
[1:05:49] was going to be a knowledge it because
[1:05:51] he is such a lady I don't know you ought
[1:05:54] to know what kind of woman that is I
[1:05:55] mean you know and everything and he
[1:05:57] claimed himself to be a prophet now he's
[1:05:59] hearing everything they're saying you
[1:06:00] know some of us we could I don't know
[1:06:02] what we do we had such a discernment
[1:06:04] like that I don't know do you know
[1:06:07] brother Balaam had it that way sometimes
[1:06:10] he's preaching here so now you know you
[1:06:11] can't hide nothing from me now
[1:06:15] God can you imagine the forces that was
[1:06:18] coming his way but you know what the
[1:06:20] point I'm trying to say is this a lot of
[1:06:25] times we think even our erring ways yeah
[1:06:29] but even so God allowed things it
[1:06:32] doesn't mean that I'm telling you to go
[1:06:33] do something wrong but you know what
[1:06:36] when Ruth and her husband and sons went
[1:06:39] down to Moab
[1:06:40] you'd think God would say oh no don't
[1:06:44] you do that down there no there is some
[1:06:49] inside inspiration came from somewhere
[1:06:51] and they went down there why why did God
[1:06:56] send them down there had them to suffer
[1:06:59] don't get me wrong when you are doing
[1:07:00] wrong you're gonna suffer for it but at
[1:07:02] the same time God would be glorified in
[1:07:05] it he will always be glorified in it
[1:07:09] because he went down there and Ruth and
[1:07:11] all them and then they did Naomi they
[1:07:14] only picks up Ruth right but Ruth was
[1:07:17] always a seed how in low air a seed like
[1:07:22] Ruth who according to history said she
[1:07:24] was a priestess how she was gonna get to
[1:07:26] Israel this God went there for her God
[1:07:30] went down there as a secret agent that's
[1:07:36] why I said because even though naomi was
[1:07:41] down there and her son Marimo abideth
[1:07:44] stay taught Naomi the word I mean they
[1:07:48] over taught roof the word high - for her
[1:07:53] yo God gonna be my god your people and
[1:07:56] somewhere she saw some supernatural it
[1:07:59] was more she had to see more in them
[1:08:01] that she saw in Moab so God worked it
[1:08:06] all out it's like when God took Pharaoh
[1:08:08] and put him in
[1:08:10] I mean Moses and Pharaoh sisters house
[1:08:16] like a chaotic situation but God knew
[1:08:19] this season he was gonna make it bloom
[1:08:22] and I'm just saying right now young
[1:08:26] people I don't know what you're going
[1:08:28] through
[1:08:28] elders of the church all of us we're
[1:08:31] going through something everybody's
[1:08:32] going through something some worse than
[1:08:35] others but don't give up on God he'll
[1:08:40] never give up on you and all things I
[1:08:43] believe that Scripture all things work
[1:08:45] together for the good I have been in so
[1:08:49] many tight situations in my life and God
[1:08:51] has always come through every time every
[1:08:57] time and if you can trust him like that
[1:09:00] he'll be faithful like that that's Dan
[1:09:16] will always oh it was great that my
[1:09:30] liberty
[1:09:31] [Music]
[1:09:37] No
[1:09:39] [Music]
