[17:07] [Music]
[17:52] [Music]
[18:03] [Music]
[18:11] [Music]
[18:19] those songs I really enjoy
[18:22] I just feel ticklish all over singing
[18:26] that song I can't explain but it gives
[18:29] me so much joy because it's so true he's
[18:33] done something for me that the world
[18:36] cannot do amen I so thank God for His
[18:40] grace and His mercy all of you being
[18:42] here tonight you know I have been just
[18:47] really thinking about a lot of things
[18:50] and seeing where God is taking us we
[18:56] think your brother we're not that as we
[18:59] stand let us turn to Hebrews please and
[19:01] I just think the Lord for His goodness
[19:06] from Hebrews the eleventh chapter we
[19:09] start with the 13th verse Luke 1 glad to
[19:14] see brother Eugene and his family I
[19:17] appreciate the sacrifice but we're
[19:21] living in a time you know it's really a
[19:28] alarming time it people should be more
[19:32] alarmed because things are not getting
[19:38] better they're getting worse and this
[19:43] time could have never happened in the
[19:50] 60s even though to see
[19:51] these were bad the 60s were I would say
[19:56] like the sowing of the seed or the
[19:58] planting of the seed
[19:59] even though brother Branham preached to
[20:01] harvest but we know that we are in the
[20:05] harvest because there are things that we
[20:08] are seeing now III don't even know
[20:12] whether the Prophet is saw it or not I
[20:14] don't know but I do know one thing that
[20:17] there's no way to describe our day
[20:20] because when brother banner was here he
[20:23] was at that time rapture should have
[20:26] taken place
[20:27] he was the Bible says when it would be
[20:33] as it was in the days of Noah as the
[20:36] days of Sodom and the Prophet could not
[20:39] have come until that condition was
[20:43] prevalent and so we're farther down the
[20:48] road much farther down the road and
[20:55] things are getting pretty bad for the
[21:00] world for the world because you've got
[21:07] to realize that even though let's just
[21:10] read the scripture so I can have you
[21:11] seated Hebrews 11 13 through 14 these
[21:16] all died in faith not having received
[21:20] the promises but having seen them afar
[21:24] off and were persuaded of them and
[21:28] embraced them and confessed that they
[21:32] were strangers and pilgrims on the earth
[21:36] this is that now they confess way back
[21:40] then there were pilgrims and strangers
[21:42] on the earth for they that say such
[21:44] things declare plainly that they seek a
[21:47] country and truly if they have been
[21:51] mindful of that country from which they
[21:54] came out they might have had an
[21:57] opportunity to have returned but
[22:02] now they desire a better country that is
[22:05] and heavenly wherefore God is not
[22:10] ashamed to be called their God for he
[22:15] hath prepared for them a city Luke
[22:21] please 1 Luke 1 beginning at the 34th
[22:37] verse he said then said Mary unto the
[22:41] angel how shall this be seeing I know
[22:46] not a man and the angel answered and
[22:50] said unto her the Holy Ghost shall come
[22:52] upon thee and the power of the highest
[22:55] shall overshadow thee therefore also
[22:58] that holy thing which shall be born of
[23:01] thee shall be called the Son of God and
[23:05] behold thy cousin Elizabeth shall have
[23:09] also conceived a son in her old age and
[23:12] this is the sixth month with her who was
[23:17] called barren for with God nothing shall
[23:21] be impossible Mary said behold the
[23:26] handmaiden of the Lord be it unto me
[23:29] according to thy word and the angel
[23:33] departed from her let us pray Heavenly
[23:37] Father we come before you as humbly as
[23:42] we know how and we thank you for your
[23:45] grace and your mercy Lord there is so
[23:49] many things that our desire to say but
[23:52] it's not me
[23:54] the people need to hear from Lord is
[23:56] from you and father we pray that you
[23:59] give us grace to move completely out of
[24:01] your way minister to us tonight do what
[24:06] is necessary for our eyes to see the
[24:11] time that we're living in help us now in
[24:13] Jesus Christ's name we pray
[24:15] amen you may be seated I am I on my
[24:21] phone sometimes I get these little
[24:23] things articles and sometimes it some
[24:26] things attract me and get my attention
[24:29] and um I was showing my wife this man
[24:35] that was not a man and there was no way
[24:39] you could tell matter of fact this
[24:42] individual had worked with these people
[24:45] or for some time and they didn't even
[24:49] know that this man used to be a woman
[24:52] and the first thing I thought about was
[24:56] the young people and the young kids
[24:58] that's coming up and uh you better if
[25:03] the Lord tarry marry somebody that you
[25:06] know somebody in the family you know who
[25:12] say it because you have no idea what the
[25:18] world is doing now I said all of that
[25:22] because one thing for certain Satan is
[25:25] he likes to mimic or copy what God is
[25:30] trying to do he always he's doing the
[25:32] negative thing the opposite and just
[25:35] like God is trying to but the devil is
[25:38] transforming these people God is trying
[25:42] to transform us you and I must realize
[25:46] that if we can really see like I was
[25:49] telling her brother today I was talking
[25:51] to a young man in in Arizona and I was
[25:54] telling him how I can hardly sleep I'm
[25:57] forever praying and you know I'm waking
[26:00] up and I'm constantly a prayer on my
[26:02] mind when I had my foot foot feet hit
[26:04] the floor I'm talking to Jesus I said
[26:07] it's such an urgency in my soul and and
[26:09] I said how can other people not feel
[26:12] what's going on and in my soul I just
[26:15] know that that hour there's there's an
[26:17] urgency and there is also a fearfulness
[26:20] about this thing and and and I can see
[26:24] you know how everything is falling apart
[26:28] and you know we make
[26:29] this thing that happened in California
[26:31] likely but God sends messages through
[26:34] these things and you know people who
[26:36] were wealthy and who thought they had it
[26:38] made and a place called Paradise and in
[26:40] the judgment of God comes by just a
[26:42] rushing of a wind and you know we think
[26:46] to ourselves we see thee the way of
[26:49] falling apart like our prophet said and
[26:51] and and we must understand there's a
[26:54] reason everything is intentional God
[26:58] intends for certain things to happen I
[27:01] think me and a brother couple of times
[27:04] we're saying you know the the very
[27:07] Internet has been developed by science
[27:12] because God said that when those two
[27:16] prophets die in the streets in Jerusalem
[27:19] that the whole world would see them and
[27:22] we had to have that kind of a system so
[27:27] we know that that's coming to pass we
[27:31] see by God's grace that everything that
[27:34] God has spoken of has come to pass or
[27:38] it's coming to pass and so I thought
[27:42] about these things that here we were a
[27:45] people the Bible says that we have come
[27:50] from somewhere and we are Pilgrims and
[27:54] strangers see I know I can't explain it
[27:58] to you but I could you know I said then
[28:01] you might look at me crazy I said but
[28:03] God if my destiny is not heaven then I'd
[28:07] rather burn until I'm done finished
[28:11] because I do not want to exist without
[28:15] God I love the things of God I love the
[28:21] life of God I love the ways of God my
[28:25] better time throughout the week is here
[28:27] because I'm surrounded by God and you
[28:32] know it's just something about me I
[28:34] can't explain it all I could tell you is
[28:37] that you must have the same conviction I
[28:39] was not born to go to hell
[28:42] I was not born amen - mr. rapture there
[28:47] is a rapturing pool in my soul you know
[28:50] I'm not done with Jeremiah but I I
[28:53] wanted to just give it a little break
[28:54] because I realized too much will bring a
[28:58] people to a discouragement but what God
[29:01] is trying to get us to do is to see that
[29:04] you are not of this world
[29:07] this is not your home there are two
[29:12] inspirations one inspiration comes from
[29:15] hell in the other one comes from heaven
[29:17] and there should be pulls in your life
[29:23] the thing I love about it in my I want
[29:27] to want to say coming from another
[29:30] dimension
[29:31] that's my subject coming from another
[29:35] dimension or another world because you
[29:42] must realize by God's grace that in the
[29:45] beginning heaven in Earth was like
[29:49] husband and wife they were together
[29:53] whatever went on in heaven went on in
[29:56] Earth there was a vision of of some sort
[30:00] that that that that Adam and Eve could
[30:03] go to church and not feel like they the
[30:05] only two that showed up something went
[30:08] on in the garden that you and I can't
[30:10] imagine because remember this dimension
[30:14] veils us from all the others but when
[30:20] you go up higher you can see things from
[30:23] that dimension that you can't see from
[30:26] this one is that right even when the
[30:29] brother Brandon was laying on the bed
[30:31] and and all of a sudden he came up out
[30:33] of his body and he thought oh I must be
[30:35] dead something must have happened to me
[30:37] but he can look back from where he was
[30:40] into this dimension and still see the
[30:42] one that he was in - hallelujah he it
[30:46] ought to make you shake a little bit
[30:48] because the Bible said we are so
[30:50] encompassed about with so great a cloud
[30:54] of witnesses
[30:55] see there is a dimension where they can
[30:59] see you even though you can't see them
[31:01] is that the truth oh it's the truth
[31:04] when brother Brandon's wife first wife
[31:06] died she had to come back to comfort
[31:08] bill and she said but bill we are in a
[31:12] better place far better than you can
[31:15] imagine
[31:16] don't cry and worry no more she could
[31:19] see that and even though he couldn't see
[31:23] her she was able to come at some point
[31:26] in time put her arms around him and Pat
[31:28] him on his back it's real that dimension
[31:33] is more real than this one this this
[31:37] this dimension is a dimension of X I
[31:40] could say it came about because of
[31:42] unbelief this world is full of sin but
[31:48] the thing about it is brother mother
[31:51] Marcia
[31:52] whenever we need help God sees it and
[31:58] God will unlock or send down a messenger
[32:03] he will always sin help when we need it
[32:08] no wonder David said I look toward the
[32:12] hill from whence cometh my help my help
[32:15] cometh from the Lord there all right
[32:20] she will not alone it may feel like you
[32:24] alone but the Bible says I will never
[32:26] leave you and I will never forsake you
[32:29] and understand when Jesus said that he's
[32:32] basically including his whole kingdom he
[32:36] could have either said we will never
[32:38] leave you nor will we forsake you
[32:41] but if he had said that maybe somebody
[32:44] would have justified their Trinitarian
[32:46] doctrine so he said I hallelujah
[32:54] the Bible said blessed be the God and
[32:57] father of our Lord Jesus Christ who have
[33:00] blessed us with all spiritual blessings
[33:02] in heavenly places in Christ Jesus
[33:04] that's where you blessed in Christ Jesus
[33:09] huh so Christ Jesus must be not only God
[33:13] that but the Christ must be a place that
[33:16] you can dwell in is that right the Bible
[33:20] said with dwell in heavenly places in
[33:23] Christ Jesus so it's not God abiding in
[33:28] me only but I'm abiding in him and the
[33:31] Bible said if we abide in him and his
[33:34] word abide in us we could ask what we
[33:37] will but to see you and I must realize
[33:41] we are not of this world we are
[33:44] different people we are special class we
[33:48] are different race of people why because
[33:51] our blood is comes from God himself but
[33:58] you and I must understand because of the
[34:00] fall we are now in this dimension to do
[34:03] what be tried and tested is that the
[34:06] word where the venom said that's we came
[34:08] in here for to be tried and tested is
[34:13] that all right he said that's a good
[34:15] lesson for my brother back there he that
[34:19] cometh to God must first be tested
[34:21] tested with the word that God's test
[34:25] do you believe hallelujah he that comes
[34:28] to God must be tested that's the only
[34:31] shot that that only shows a true child
[34:35] then see him be tested and when he when
[34:39] the test comes you can't overcome less
[34:43] there's a test given to you and when
[34:47] test is given it is to see whether you
[34:51] can overcome or not jesus said to him
[34:55] that overcometh the test the test is the
[34:59] greatest thing that could ever happen to
[35:02] you I believe it is written in the
[35:04] scriptures Peter said that our trials
[35:06] are worth more to us than precious gold
[35:10] it's a testing time is one good evidence
[35:14] to us that God is with us when we're
[35:19] tested for all children of God are
[35:22] and try so this there's no way to get
[35:33] out of it if you really want to prove
[35:35] see we're here to prove as I said we're
[35:39] not from Satan's Eden we must prove that
[35:44] we're not children of the devil oh it's
[35:48] not enough to say it we must prove it
[35:52] and Jesus come to Nicodemus as I'll tell
[35:55] you how you can prove it you must be
[35:57] born again
[35:58] if you from that dimension you got to be
[36:02] born from that dimension that means
[36:06] being born we're from above is that
[36:09] Bible I don't come to a script in just a
[36:13] moment but you and I must realize amen
[36:16] this whole testing that we're going
[36:19] through right now it's just rude to you
[36:23] because God knows who you are is to
[36:25] prove to you who you are somehow you've
[36:29] got to make up your mind it's easy you
[36:33] determined within yourself did I come
[36:35] from Hell or did I come from heaven and
[36:37] if I have if I come from heaven that I
[36:40] must be about my father's business
[36:44] nothing else matters
[36:48] they the Bible said they they don't mind
[36:51] calling him their God because even the
[36:55] world is now saying Lucifer is God they
[37:01] just here Illuminati it's the world now
[37:05] in America they have satanic churches
[37:08] and everything else and those people are
[37:11] faithful they go to church morning then
[37:15] then the believers who say they believe
[37:17] us
[37:17] oh you said what do you mean I'm trying
[37:21] to tell you something if you can see
[37:24] that you are coming from another world
[37:26] this is not your home you just leave
[37:29] this stuff alone you realize this is
[37:33] poison to me it's trash
[37:36] it's dirty is not it is nothing I'll be
[37:39] able to find in heaven like this so I
[37:42] don't need it and I don't want it it
[37:46] will do something it'll make you
[37:48] separate yourself from this world you
[37:54] Kings
[37:55] the priests where have another world and
[38:02] the Bible comes to identify you so that
[38:06] you can say Amen there's something on
[38:09] the inside of me that makes me know
[38:11] that's where I'm from it's the simple
[38:15] eagle chicken story brother Branham
[38:17] talked about once he heard that's Queen
[38:20] he realized he was no longer a chicken
[38:24] he was an eagle and this message come to
[38:29] identify you who you are to separate you
[38:33] you and I must understand there must be
[38:36] a distinct set separation from the
[38:39] foolish bride and the bride the foolish
[38:43] virgins and the bride indistinct at some
[38:46] point in time there must be a
[38:49] distinction because the foolish comes to
[38:52] the wise give us of your oil right I
[38:58] told you the other day I said listen if
[39:01] you listen to the brother and provided
[39:03] way he spoke at several times he's you
[39:06] know a little bit of more this a little
[39:07] bit but he always brings it back to
[39:09] crying out for more if you think you can
[39:13] sit here and say I got it all made no
[39:16] shock when you got it all made everybody
[39:19] else gonna know you got it all me but my
[39:21] part is you never you don't stop till
[39:24] you get home is that right when your
[39:28] parachuters ship seen you to the store
[39:30] to buy something junior I gotta give you
[39:32] this kind of money make sure you get to
[39:34] change this what it should be around
[39:36] this much but listen when you get this
[39:38] change put it in your pocket grab the
[39:39] package and don't stop till you get back

[39:54] kind of time it was going to take you

[40:06] you to doing come on back home that's
[40:09] the whole thing I called you to be sons
[40:12] and daughters of God in this this old
[40:14] Satan's Eden do what you're supposed to
[40:17] do be us hunt be a daughter and then
[40:21] come on back home simple as that
[40:25] Bishop rose' says listen because the
[40:29] creature itself also shall be delivered
[40:32] from the bondage of corruption into the
[40:34] glorious liberty of the children of God
[40:37] for we know what this creature this
[40:41] creature will be delivered for those of
[40:45] you who noticed my watch that was a gift
[40:47] ha ha hey amen didn't mean to anyway
[40:52] let's go on listen for we know that the
[40:56] whole creation groaneth and travaileth
[40:59] in pain together until now how many you
[41:03] are groaning it's gross something in you
[41:07] must grow something in you must long for
[41:10] heaven why because heaven is a reality
[41:14] to those who are born again hey the
[41:19] prophet of God says listen he said he
[41:21] was up in Canada he said in all of those
[41:24] ducks and geese and stuff were born
[41:26] never been off the pond hallelujah
[41:29] then here come a drink whatever they do
[41:33] make that noise and those ducks and
[41:37] everything gathered around him
[41:38] we need took off the flight they
[41:41] followed him ma because they realized
[41:44] that Drake was a born leader something's
[41:48] wrong with you if you can't see that God
[41:51] doesn't drink hallelujah he said as
[41:54] a prophet who is a divine leader of God
[41:57] for God is that right and why did one of
[42:00] those breaking her what do they do they
[42:03] all and I love the winning formation
[42:05] they come in they come in like like a
[42:07] war phone information right like they're
[42:11] the way of a pyramid type you know think
[42:13] you know someone asked me let's go but
[42:16] anyway you realize by God's grace that
[42:20] we are in our timing I just wish I could
[42:23] get everybody to see what I'm seeing cuz
[42:25] I really been crying out not only for
[42:27] myself but for everybody as a God will
[42:30] awaken the people let them see Amen that
[42:34] this world is falling apart and that not
[42:36] only just America but every continent
[42:39] wars and rumors of wars one person
[42:43] trying to be better than the other and
[42:45] it's supposed to be it's intentional
[42:49] because the flood said that man the
[42:52] violence in the land head was
[42:54] overflowing when God said I repeat that
[43:00] made man because of the evil the
[43:02] violence and everything else that went
[43:04] alone in that area in that day is that
[43:08] right and you and I must understand by
[43:11] God's grace we are here we're here when
[43:18] brother Branham K
[43:19] introduced us to Joshua and Joshua says
[43:23] no foolishness on this journey even
[43:26] though it's grace I don't want none of
[43:28] those things in the world in your house
[43:32] of the world in your is that right so I
[43:35] don't want you to put none of that stuff
[43:37] in your house because that stuff is the
[43:39] thing that makes the body sick that's
[43:43] what brings dad's hallelujah into the
[43:46] cap oh it doesn't matter just a little
[43:48] bit of wedge and a little gold and a
[43:51] little something well you might say well
[43:52] I don't have no gold but anything that's
[43:54] the world and that stuff that they do
[43:59] and use if you got it there you are
[44:02] affecting the things that in your house
[44:03] in your house it's affecting the move of
[44:07] God
[44:09] guess what God told Joshua you go find
[44:13] them
[44:13] because I'm gonna tell you something you
[44:15] cannot tell me that God did not give a
[44:17] key and space to repent God gives
[44:20] everybody space to repent
[44:22] hello he gives everybody space to repent
[44:26] and when you don't repent judgment comes
[44:31] hallelujah he said listen God says I'm
[44:33] tired of people not getting victory in
[44:35] church I'm tired of people not getting
[44:37] their healing I'm tired of people not
[44:39] getting their deliverance is because
[44:41] somebody got something hiding healing in
[44:43] their house and he says listen Holy
[44:45] Ghost go find them and what happens it
[44:51] can cause his whole house animals and
[44:53] all to be killed we know the whole
[44:59] creation groaneth and travaileth in pain
[45:01] together until now and not only they but
[45:04] ourselves also which have the first
[45:06] fruit of the Spirit you know why I'm
[45:08] preaching like this because I know all
[45:10] of us if not all of us and most of us
[45:12] need to get rid of things and I'm gonna
[45:15] tell you it is vital it's a matter of
[45:18] life and death you tell me the revival
[45:21] all right a revival like Robinson is
[45:24] getting all the trash out of your life
[45:26] and we all need to get something I've
[45:29] cried out to God y'all might not believe
[45:32] it and you know
[45:33] have to but this soul was a rapture as
[45:37] she was coming on I see the wickedness
[45:39] and the evil and the hatred everybody
[45:41] hating everybody and you know all that
[45:44] stuff with we never dream it would be
[45:46] this way but it is and you and I better
[45:50] do something about it because you know
[45:51] we can't find you know no rock to hide
[45:54] us from what's going on ain't nothing
[45:57] gonna be able to hide you but Christ
[45:58] make sure your life is here in Christ
[46:01] right it's not just in America it's all
[46:04] over the world but you know what the
[46:06] funny thing is I read something with the
[46:09] property God said you know Americans are
[46:10] cocky you know they don't forgot they
[46:14] don't forgot what God has done for him
[46:15] for them he said but God is coming the
[46:19] judgment is coming and you know it is
[46:21] true I could remember the time you know
[46:24] when you were somewhere oh I'm an
[46:25] American now they don't care about what
[46:27] you are they laugh at you now but there
[46:29] was a time we were really cocky to be
[46:31] you know and people really respected
[46:33] Americans not overseas anymore they
[46:35] don't do it
[46:36] hallelujah let me move on not only they
[46:38] but ourselves also which are the first
[46:40] fruit of the Spirit even we ourselves
[46:42] groan within ourselves waiting for the
[46:45] doctor
[46:46] you're not crying out for perfection if
[46:50] you're not something on the inside I'm
[46:52] tired of this stuff something on the
[46:56] inside must cry out for foot perfection
[47:00] if you bother gay there's something on
[47:03] the inside that's crying out I know
[47:05] there's a resting place there's another
[47:09] hole there's another world hallelujah
[47:12] and I don't belong here if the Old
[47:16] Testament Saints could come to that
[47:18] conclusion that they were peeled them
[47:20] and strangers what about us that's one
[47:24] thing I love about the Jews most of
[47:27] those Jews no matter where they was in
[47:28] German Sweden or whatever they kept
[47:30] there they kept there are traditional
[47:33] things they look like Jews walk like
[47:37] Jews act like Jews hello
[47:40] yeah most of them I'm not saying you
[47:42] didn't have renegades you got renegades
[47:44] everywhere
[47:45] but that little core group that little
[47:47] remnant never ever traded their identity
[47:52] for the world acceptance a we in this
[47:58] bribe we won't address and act like them
[48:00] so they won't know God knows we speaking
[48:11] to for we are saved by a hope but hope
[48:16] that is seen is not hope for what a man
[48:21] seeing why does he yet hope for but if
[48:24] we hope for that we see not then do we
[48:28] with patience wait for H John that which
[48:35] is born of the flesh is flesh that which
[48:39] is born of the Spirit and here Jesus
[48:43] says no flesh and God is going to enter
[48:46] so how do you expect to go there there's
[48:50] got to be a part of you that will be
[48:53] able to be transferred from here to
[48:55] there and if that part of you is not
[49:00] born again if it's not God's it you go
[49:03] down and stead of up
[49:04] you must have God on the inside of you
[49:08] in order to escape death there is no
[49:12] resurrection without the resurrection on
[49:15] the inside y'all understand me we are
[49:19] coming from another dimension we're
[49:21] coming from another world and that's
[49:23] what Jesus said I came from God and I go
[49:26] back to God I can say that you can say
[49:30] that if you really have God on the
[49:33] inside but i'ma tell you flesh is flesh
[49:38] you think you're gonna decorate this
[49:40] fashion fool God you are mistaken
[49:43] cuz those Pharisees and Sadducees they
[49:47] were far more they were dressed more
[49:48] holier than you and I can imagine
[49:50] and God said yes you would have had a
[49:52] cold can I not come you look like white
[49:55] except because something that been
[49:57] washed clean
[49:58] but on the inside you're dead men's bone
[50:01] so you can't fool God with religion and
[50:04] tradition you must be born again I can't
[50:09] I cannot I cannot emphasize it because
[50:13] he told her didn't he he said this is
[50:16] the most deceptive age ever you got
[50:19] spirits right now in churches in the
[50:22] message that we call message
[50:25] impersonating the Holy Ghost
[50:28] you don't need an impersonator you need
[50:32] the real deal and any spirit that will
[50:35] cause you to hog read the word and say
[50:37] Amen to it is not the Holy Ghost the
[50:40] Holy Ghost only says a man to his word
[50:51] then all right mama not you must be born
[50:54] again Jesus didn't tell Nicodemus that
[50:56] for nothing he said okay you flash now
[51:00] okay he was born into it as well but if
[51:02] you're gonna go into this other kingdom
[51:03] you must have another birth that's
[51:05] simple you know Nicodemus about humppa
[51:09] how much how can I do it right and Jesus
[51:11] says now listen I want you to understand
[51:13] that win win win a man is born of the
[51:15] Holy Ghost he says the wind blows where
[51:17] it listeth and thou hearest the sound
[51:19] thereof but cannot tell whence it cometh
[51:22] and whither it goeth so is everyone born
[51:24] that is born of the Spirit
[51:26] basically says it's not from this
[51:29] dimension is that a visible thing that
[51:31] you can see when it happens hallelujah
[51:35] it comes I feel the wind but I don't see
[51:37] it but there's an effect on that wind
[51:40] that wind will make whatever it's
[51:42] blowing on make some noise do something
[51:45] you gonna know the wind is blowing but
[51:47] where it came from the way it goes
[51:49] nobody knows why because his God he's
[51:53] all in it all he's everywhere
[52:00] know how he does brother I'm said he's a
[52:02] man but omniscience knows he's here he's
[52:05] there he's in you he's in me he's
[52:07] everywhere God can do whatever he wants
[52:10] to do hallelujah
[52:13] is that Alright he said win for with men
[52:17] for when they speak great swelling words
[52:20] of vanity they allure through the lusts
[52:23] of the flesh through the must wantonness
[52:26] and that's the problem we have often
[52:28] often hear her are always justified as
[52:31] though we never sinned in the first
[52:32] place but see that's good that's the
[52:34] truth but if a man is not born again
[52:37] he'll take that as a means to go sin oh
[52:43] god don't forgive me you see but with
[52:47] that attitude
[52:48] it shows you don't have the goods yeah
[52:52] this is a message of grace for sure but
[52:55] brother said if you don't keep the
[52:56] balance to it you're making a message of
[52:59] disgrace and that's what's really
[53:02] happening it's the truth you say our
[53:06] brothers why do you say so many people
[53:07] in the message don't have the Holy Ghost
[53:09] because as time gets harder they
[53:12] stripping their clothes they're getting
[53:14] tight whatever they doing everything
[53:17] that they shouldn't be doing no look at
[53:23] it and prevention you to tell the
[53:25] spirituality by the woman in the church
[53:27] and if she start wearing the makeup and
[53:30] stand render the high-heeled shoes
[53:32] something's not being preached right not
[53:35] enough not enough fire in the message
[53:38] that's why I'm hammering right now maybe
[53:41] I've been too soft but I'm gonna tell
[53:43] you now if you're gonna make heaven you
[53:46] gotta follow the messenger follow me as
[53:49] I follow Christ that right oh you say
[53:53] ain't gonna matter yes he will brother
[53:55] branham tells a story about a woman who
[53:56] was a Holy Ghost filled woman it was
[53:59] tall about those high-heeled shoes you
[54:02] know what she thought all brother
[54:03] branham I can still make it but what she
[54:05] didn't realize is that the way was gonna
[54:07] get an error
[54:08] it may be narrow now but after a while
[54:11] you gonna see a lot of people leave
[54:13] because it's two straight brother it's
[54:15] two straight and people are lazy they do
[54:18] not want to get before God and cry out
[54:20] that's why they don't have it they want
[54:23] the formality of it they want to oh
[54:25] praise God I believe a messaging
[54:28] Harlow's thing but I'm gonna tell you
[54:30] what 2 million was with Moses and only 2
[54:34] made it over Toslink kayla represented
[54:38] those two who had the Holy Ghost I don't
[54:41] mean a ban on the death but I feel like
[54:43] a judge right now you know you show what
[54:45] do you mean brother Bruce what I'm
[54:46] trying to say listen don't blame me you
[54:50] know unless I didn't preach it to you
[54:52] but I'm gonna tell you something until
[54:55] you are confident that you got it and
[54:57] the you got it the way God says it I
[54:59] mean bringing change in your life I'm
[55:02] not talking about feeling good and being
[55:03] able to feel the presence I'm talking
[55:05] about living it living it so much a
[55:08] mentor you losing your mind
[55:09] and God's mind is settling in you that's
[55:12] what I'm talking about that's what
[55:14] brother BAM that's where he could
[55:15] contact with God and God knows the truth
[55:18] so many times how was it how it used to
[55:20] be when people who were law consecrated
[55:23] we say you know the Lord told me this
[55:24] and the Lord told me that the Lord can't
[55:26] told me to come by to see you today
[55:28] all right and it would be God but people
[55:30] don't hear from God no more except when
[55:33] they come to church and sometime they
[55:36] halfway hear it you know what I'm saying
[55:38] but as individuals you and I we were so
[55:41] concentrated God could talk to us every
[55:44] day even today I had such a day like
[55:45] that and every move I made God a minute
[55:49] things I had to do God a minute
[55:54] hallelujah it was so wonderful and so
[55:57] refreshing the truth of the matter is I
[56:03] forgot how good it was
[56:05] you know and my thing is he meant people
[56:07] of God if there is so much God for us
[56:10] and we're stealing from ourselves we're
[56:13] cheating ourselves amen
[56:16] God is so much he could give us so much
[56:18] his presence in his being you know with
[56:21] us throughout the day and we will settle
[56:23] for a little bit of his crumbs
[56:24] I don't want God just
[56:27] me I want God to welcome me I want him
[56:30] to talk to me
[56:31] hallelujah I wouldn't be I won't need
[56:33] its touch if he's living inside but we
[56:38] in our mind we don't we don't want to
[56:40] lose control of our mind that's it
[56:42] because people think once you go there
[56:44] boy you going crazy you can use use
[56:45] moving too fast with that but I want to
[56:48] lose my mind for his mind this is what
[56:55] this is now why are they promised them
[56:58] limited let me move back because that's
[57:00] the truth of the matter so many
[57:02] preachers you know they're promising
[57:03] Liberty to people that when they
[57:04] themselves are in bondage he says why
[57:06] they promise them Liberty they
[57:08] themselves are the servants of
[57:09] corruption for whom a man is overcome of
[57:12] the same he brought is brought into
[57:14] bondage that's what Paul said I'm gonna
[57:16] be in bondage to nothing so what old
[57:18] brother was right now I've got something
[57:20] that's binding me break it let the Holy
[57:23] Ghost destroy it
[57:24] you must that must become your enemy and
[57:27] you got to look at it as an enemy not a
[57:30] friend
[57:31] Paul said I will not allow anything to
[57:34] put me under bondage and if there's
[57:36] bondage in your life you need to look at
[57:38] that thing as a enemy because Jerusalem
[57:41] is free
[57:44] we're not of the bondswoman we're not to
[57:47] be slaves to no one
[57:49] nothing no help us I got enemies
[58:04] spiritual enemies and I'm going after
[58:09] I'm conquering my land brother
[58:11] hallelujah he told me to conquer I'm
[58:14] confident I'm comforting by the grace of
[58:17] God I'm conquering no sure ah
[58:23] at the end of the day I said Lord you
[58:25] know one time I just say God I don't
[58:26] need him to say well done yes I do
[58:28] I want him to say without done you know
[58:33] I don't know that well you know he was a
[58:34] poor example but come on II and I don't
[58:36] want that I want a well done
[58:41] he sent me here for a purpose
[58:43] he sent every one of us here for a
[58:45] purpose and we need to seek without that
[58:48] purple but that purpose is and say God
[58:50] let me be a soldier let me go at this
[58:53] thing with all the fight I got we had
[58:58] been better for them this is what he
[59:00] says this for if they if they have
[59:03] escaped the pollutions of the world
[59:04] through the knowledge of the Lord and
[59:07] Savior Jesus Christ they are again
[59:09] entangled therein and overcome the
[59:12] latter end is worse with them than the
[59:15] beginning for it had been better for
[59:18] them not to have known the way of
[59:20] righteousness then after they have known
[59:22] it to turn from the holy commandment
[59:24] delivered unto them but it is it but it
[59:28] is happened unto them according to the
[59:32] true proverb the dog is turned to his
[59:36] own vomit again in the song that was
[59:38] washed to her wallowing in the mire
[59:42] hallelujah so evidently they always were
[59:46] dogs and they always was hogs they tried
[59:50] to go but they couldn't why they did not
[59:54] get a nature change
[59:56] you can't walk this message and live
[1:00:00] this message without that nature change
[1:00:03] hmm oh I'm trouble help I'm talking
[1:00:07] about hell you know we are we are in a
[1:00:10] place right now God wants to help us he
[1:00:13] wants to deliver us he wants to give us
[1:00:15] victory he wants you back brother and
[1:00:17] says he wants to give us a Holy Ghost
[1:00:19] more than you you want to have it he
[1:00:22] gonna be able to blame God he saw our
[1:00:24] brother brings his lord to this message
[1:00:26] then the Holy Ghost no it's not because
[1:00:28] brother Brennan called this message the
[1:00:31] Holy Ghost message and he preached it
[1:00:35] amen he preached that message amen
[1:00:38] after the seals he preached the token he
[1:00:41] said that this one this one is the
[1:00:43] greatest of them all ha because if
[1:00:46] you've got the token if that Holy Ghost
[1:00:49] is sealing you hallelujah
[1:00:51] they can break the seal it's the truth
[1:00:58] but people don't want to pray they think
[1:01:00] you know we've gotten so lazy though you
[1:01:02] know I don't know I don't know but your
[1:01:04] Pentecostal experience ain't gonna make
[1:01:06] it you got to go beyond that when you
[1:01:11] get the Holy Ghost you just started out
[1:01:13] guarding I have no I clean thing up
[1:01:16] there
[1:01:17] not even meal you everything got to be
[1:01:21] holy
[1:01:24] look what Brennan said in 1950 so he
[1:01:27] said we need what we need is a Holy
[1:01:29] Ghost atmosphere
[1:01:31] that's right an atmosphere where the
[1:01:34] power of God are moving one Accord one
[1:01:38] place gathered together under that
[1:01:40] atmosphere of expecting God to move down
[1:01:43] and to do signs and wonders people don't
[1:01:46] come to church like that no more they do
[1:01:48] not come to church acknowledge a people
[1:01:51] I'm not saying everybody maybe there are
[1:01:53] a few but my thing is how many of you
[1:01:57] really come in expectation to truly get
[1:02:01] something from God just to see something
[1:02:03] supernatural and just at that oh I just
[1:02:07] studied that boom God comes across the
[1:02:10] pulpit with the same thing that's God
[1:02:14] showing you you were connected to him at
[1:02:17] that moment in time before you got here
[1:02:19] and he's coming to Amen the fellowship
[1:02:22] your hand but if you don't never have
[1:02:25] fellowship you don't know what's going
[1:02:27] on sometimes you say well God I want a
[1:02:32] healing I want a word of a healing God
[1:02:34] did a preacher come up and said you know
[1:02:36] good there's nothing too hard for God if
[1:02:39] you need healing we see Julian at that
[1:02:42] moment God just told you to receive your
[1:02:44] healing because that's what you came for
[1:02:47] and we'll let it go he didn't talk to me
[1:02:53] yes he did
[1:02:55] what are you saying God is here remember
[1:02:59] I told you last week I said listen all
[1:03:01] those colors going through the room all
[1:03:03] that radio and television going through
[1:03:05] it's in here even though you don't have
[1:03:07] that instrument to pick it up it's still
[1:03:09] here whether you can see smell taste or
[1:03:12] whatever it is here so is God he's here
[1:03:17] and we just don't we forget his present
[1:03:21] we forget his work we forget his
[1:03:23] promises and then you know you come and
[1:03:25] he said well I just need a touch from
[1:03:26] God he it ain't god that's that's fallen
[1:03:30] shot you falling short
[1:03:36] it's God God is here to deliver us he's
[1:03:40] able to give us everything we desire you
[1:03:42] know you know I want the Holy Ghost he
[1:03:45] said all you got to do is believe it
[1:03:47] confess it and go forward he's all our
[1:03:52] lord thank you for the Holy Ghost I got
[1:03:54] it they devastate do this I got the Holy
[1:03:57] Ghost you gotta let him know I got the
[1:04:00] Holy Ghost tell him you go forward like
[1:04:05] a warrior I got it you get it when I
[1:04:08] come fast believing and God gave it to
[1:04:10] me see but most of us we we don't have
[1:04:16] the kind of faith we should in ship but
[1:04:19] it really is that simple and the more
[1:04:22] you gathered them the more you see it
[1:04:24] the more they began to grow it began to
[1:04:27] manifest itself in you just like that
[1:04:30] but if you were coward God can't use no
[1:04:34] kava soldiers you think about this world
[1:04:41] that God left
[1:04:43] his dimension his domain to come to this
[1:04:49] world to save it and you got to realize
[1:04:57] it meant it was the man who we're the
[1:05:00] ones who called heaven to fall huh
[1:05:05] there gonna be a new heaven and a new
[1:05:07] earth why because of us God's redeeming
[1:05:12] the whole redeeming the whole thing he
[1:05:17] told Abraham he doesn't listen I want
[1:05:19] you to know not only will you be the
[1:05:21] father down here but there are you the
[1:05:24] father there - you got sons and
[1:05:28] daughters that cannot be counted down
[1:05:30] here but you got sons and daughters the
[1:05:32] bear that can't be counted
[1:05:34] you say brother Brooks preach it tell me
[1:05:36] the truth that's right
[1:05:37] brother brother priests of people amen
[1:05:40] he didn't even know they got saved it
[1:05:42] meant some at her old age remember the
[1:05:45] only in 97 years old she hugged him and
[1:05:47] said my precious brother that angel said
[1:05:50] do you remember her no because she was
[1:05:52] an old lady so what he was the prophet
[1:05:58] of her down here and up there she's part
[1:06:01] of him see she a lot of things I think
[1:06:05] one time we think that those of 24
[1:06:08] elders are sitting down in the chair
[1:06:09] waiting now are they doing stop whatever
[1:06:14] they doing they working in accordance to
[1:06:17] God's will in that dimension you say oh
[1:06:20] brother I don't know about that well the
[1:06:22] Bible says Satan himself comes to and
[1:06:24] fro even goes to church up there
[1:06:27] probably the Word of God says Satan is a
[1:06:29] believer whatever they preaching up
[1:06:32] there he believes it whenever they
[1:06:35] preaching out here he believes it you we
[1:06:38] the only ones that don't believe what he
[1:06:39] said but the devil knows that the Word
[1:06:42] of God cannot come back boy he knows it
[1:06:46] he's lived long enough to know it and
[1:06:49] everything that God does is in tensional
[1:06:52] sometimes the devil think he got God you
[1:06:54] know what I'm saying it's some some
[1:06:56] secret weapon up his sleeve
[1:06:57] ain't got nothing God when he conquered
[1:07:00] him he took everything from him but we
[1:07:03] don't believe it
[1:07:04] we need to believe that we need to
[1:07:06] believe that that Satan has nothing not
[1:07:10] even a pair of teeth he's got nothing
[1:07:16] but we are so free all the devil is due
[1:07:19] to the devil
[1:07:20] now the devil ain't doing nothing God
[1:07:22] got all things under control all he's
[1:07:27] doing is being a tool in God's hands Oh
[1:07:30] for as much then we are the offsprings
[1:07:32] of God we all do not think that the
[1:07:35] Godhead is like unto gold or silver or
[1:07:37] stone agreement by the art and man's
[1:07:39] devices and the time of ignorance God
[1:07:42] winked at it but now commands all men
[1:07:45] everywhere to repent you and I needed
[1:07:49] this is not our original state this is
[1:07:51] not what we started out as we were sons
[1:07:55] and daughters of God in the mind of God
[1:07:57] and with sons and daughters of God now
[1:08:00] and will be sons and daughters of God
[1:08:04] God you said you know we people have all
[1:08:08] these idols and things like that for
[1:08:10] what when God at you you're God's Idol
[1:08:15] because God is in you you God statue
[1:08:20] y'all understand me hallelujah so what
[1:08:23] brother I don't know i can tell you what
[1:08:25] God did he bowed himself to a man washed
[1:08:29] his feet God did it oh come on and then
[1:08:39] he told the story which is greater the
[1:08:41] servant on a master hallelujah G he said
[1:08:47] don't you understand in my kingdom the
[1:08:50] least distant greatest it's not how
[1:08:53] great you are here is how least how
[1:08:55] unless you can become here that's what
[1:08:59] makes you great there if you could
[1:09:01] humble yourself down here you'll be a
[1:09:02] great person up there because you won't
[1:09:05] be dealing with this pride and all that
[1:09:07] stuff like Lucifer did dealt with
[1:09:11] that's why Paul says I learned how to be
[1:09:13] your base you have the Lord because our
[1:09:18] being I will being our way of acting I
[1:09:21] will perform everything we do suppose be
[1:09:23] different from the world mister true
[1:09:27] tell my the impersonation the whole
[1:09:29] world is impersonators they see whatever
[1:09:32] Hollywood do they do it
[1:09:34] they see however the man see they sing
[1:09:36] it like the man but it's alright to sing
[1:09:39] a song say it like you sing it sometimes
[1:09:44] people say well brother Bruce did you
[1:09:46] write that song I say no but I feel like
[1:09:47] I did hallelujah why because I sing it
[1:09:51] like I seen it I do it like I do it I've
[1:09:56] always I've tried to impersonate but I
[1:09:58] can't do it you don't think it's a
[1:10:00] person nation but we try to get it just
[1:10:02] like the artists got it but you're not
[1:10:07] being yourself sing it like you sing it
[1:10:10] do it like you do it y'all understand me
[1:10:13] Amen I keep the game oh but anyway
[1:10:16] by God's grace let me hurry you and I
[1:10:19] must realize by ID give me a few more
[1:10:21] minutes what is your worth a lot of time
[1:10:27] we don't even know how much we work we
[1:10:29] think oh you know how many so many cents
[1:10:31] now I think inflation is going on it
[1:10:33] might you might we might be worth a
[1:10:35] dollar now maybe a couple years but my
[1:10:40] point is that's not the way God see you
[1:10:43] in the message perseverance the problem
[1:10:45] says I wonder if there's ministers here
[1:10:48] instructors in the world that would like
[1:10:51] to come remember
[1:10:53] eternal destination is being decided
[1:10:56] right now here is about seven or eight
[1:11:00] 10 people standing here and you know
[1:11:02] what that means our soul is worth ten
[1:11:07] thousand worlds we mustn't he said we
[1:11:12] must not take this lightly we can't even
[1:11:16] imagine it ten thousand worlds
[1:11:22] yo so
[1:11:23] that's why the devil loves it he'd know
[1:11:26] if he can get it he's got something
[1:11:28] valuable he spends all night and day
[1:11:32] trying to get souls the only thing is he
[1:11:37] getting the wrong ones anything he
[1:11:39] getting fool's gold you know he must
[1:11:44] realize this when we began to exhort God
[1:11:47] God will exalt you hello when you began
[1:11:53] to really exalt God he will exalt you in
[1:11:57] other words he becomes first in your
[1:12:03] life above every pleasure every pleasure
[1:12:08] he comes first and if you can put God
[1:12:12] above all your pleasures you'll find out
[1:12:16] you won't need no other pleasure out of
[1:12:19] side of Jesus Christ let me hurry up now
[1:12:23] brother says let's turn the camera I'm
[1:12:27] almost done I'm gonna finish right here
[1:12:28] cuz I pick it up later but but what I
[1:12:30] want everybody to understand listen I
[1:12:33] know we've come this far but somewhere
[1:12:37] you've got to separate you got a you got
[1:12:39] a you got a see yourself being different
[1:12:41] you should follow them I don't care
[1:12:44] don't don't even look at it like that
[1:12:46] cuz everybody that's following this
[1:12:47] message is not following the message I
[1:12:49] don't know who everybody is and it's
[1:12:52] important that I Know Who I am you don't
[1:12:54] know who everybody is but it's important
[1:12:57] you know who you are so you won't allow
[1:13:01] other people to influence your walk with
[1:13:03] God is that right oh you show oh what do
[1:13:08] you mean I'm telling you like this the
[1:13:10] serpent was in Adams church he was in
[1:13:17] Church but he wasn't a believer he came
[1:13:23] to overthrow and every serpent in the
[1:13:26] churches come to all the throne they are
[1:13:29] the troublemakers seemingly that they
[1:13:35] got the spirit right fun to do he says
[1:13:38] let's turn our cameras for a few minutes
[1:13:41] let's look up to glory all the time
[1:13:45] there's anything going on he says all
[1:13:47] the time there's anything going on down
[1:13:50] here there's something going on up there
[1:13:53] so all the stuff we see in the world
[1:13:56] everything that's happening right now
[1:13:58] don't you know something's going on you
[1:14:02] know a wall cannot even hit the earth
[1:14:04] unless an angel says womb something it's
[1:14:10] always angels involved you said what I
[1:14:13] mean I'm not gonna read all that that's
[1:14:14] really long but I'm gonna tell you what
[1:14:16] you think they're not watching you been
[1:14:20] watching you every move you make every
[1:14:24] time you get in trouble somebody's
[1:14:27] reporting it as God as if God doesn't
[1:14:30] already know those ages went up there
[1:14:34] that said Lord have you seen what's
[1:14:36] going on down in there you see what I'm
[1:14:40] saying because a lot of time we get in
[1:14:41] these fiery places we think God is not
[1:14:44] in the fire he's already there guess
[1:14:47] what he ordained it every testing trial
[1:14:52] you so I can understand how somebody can
[1:14:55] be so mean to me
[1:14:56] and say such stuff is that because God
[1:14:58] ordained it now he want to see how much
[1:15:03] character you have are you gonna raise
[1:15:06] up and puff up like a frog and go after
[1:15:09] him are you gonna humble yourself like a
[1:15:12] little lamb said Lord not my will but
[1:15:15] let thine be done
[1:15:20] if you can't do that it's too much you
[1:15:23] still living too much of you living
[1:15:25] still that right how are we gonna make
[1:15:29] it if God put us to the test I was
[1:15:31] thinking I think I woke up this morning
[1:15:33] thinking about that Lord if somebody
[1:15:35] slapped me in my face
[1:15:38] know what I'm gonna do is some other
[1:15:40] slap I was praying I don't know I was
[1:15:44] dreaming or something and I saw myself
[1:15:46] you know the poem and then the devil say
[1:15:49] yeah
[1:15:50] and they go yeah I'm a guy humming the
[1:15:51] number he said they're gonna keep doing
[1:15:53] it and I said if they keep doing it you
[1:15:55] know what I'm gonna do I'm gonna fall on
[1:15:56] my knees and let them have their way
[1:16:01] that was my little dream I trust that
[1:16:03] the way it happens if it happens you
[1:16:05] know because otherwise what's gonna
[1:16:08] happen you gonna fight and the Bible
[1:16:11] said if you fight with the sword see
[1:16:12] people in this message don't believe
[1:16:14] that and all I can tell you is that we
[1:16:16] better ask God for some real grace
[1:16:18] cuz Jesus want us to live it like he
[1:16:21] lived it
[1:16:22] woo take your cross and what follow me
[1:16:27] y'all know there are certain things in
[1:16:30] your at you the first thing you want to
[1:16:34] do is retaliate well I yeah right you
[1:16:41] wanna eat you're gonna defend and that's
[1:16:43] what Peter thought he was doing and God
[1:16:46] rebuke him for it so people say where I
[1:16:48] kind of right well I don't know I I just
[1:16:50] say lord help me if anything happened
[1:16:52] let me do what you would do Jesus that's
[1:16:55] all I want to do I don't care what
[1:16:56] people might say just let me do what you
[1:16:58] would do I have not seen Jesus fighting
[1:17:01] somebody knocking them all down the
[1:17:03] healing all that I just I'm not sick he
[1:17:05] ain't gonna do it he's not gonna do it
[1:17:08] always I can see him sitting there with
[1:17:11] his priestly garment my the first thing
[1:17:14] you know coming to his right I can see
[1:17:16] an angel coming up to his name name is
[1:17:18] Gabriel
[1:17:18] you know heavenly full heavens is full
[1:17:21] of angels don't you believe it I can see
[1:17:24] Gabriel run up in there and pull his
[1:17:27] sword say master I've served
[1:17:30] since the day you created me I hold the
[1:17:34] lightning in my hand look what's going
[1:17:36] on down there in Babylon they fixin to
[1:17:39] burn up three believers let me go down
[1:17:41] there this morning

[1:17:45] has got butter on it I believe he could
[1:17:58] he could have done it don't you I can
[1:18:01] hear him say let me go down there our
[1:18:03] clean babylon up this morning
[1:18:06] see y'all that's the way we'd be thinkin
[1:18:08] he said I can hear him say yes Gabriel
[1:18:12] you build a righteous angel you've
[1:18:15] obeyed me since the day I created you
[1:18:17] but I can't let you go then I see him
[1:18:20] sheath his sword stand back - attention
[1:18:23] to the side to the side up from the side
[1:18:26] comes another angel
[1:18:28] he's one word the one who was I had
[1:18:31] control over the water saying master
[1:18:33] have you looked down in Babylon why you
[1:18:36] give me that just jurisdiction over the
[1:18:39] antediluvian destruction I broke up the
[1:18:42] springs of the deep I drained the waters
[1:18:44] out of the heaven I washed your earth
[1:18:46] off let me go down there this morning
[1:18:48] and I washed Babylon off the face of the
[1:18:51] earth I believe he could have done it I
[1:18:53] can himself why would you build a good
[1:18:56] angel you've done just what I told you
[1:18:58] in there have diluvian de destruction
[1:19:00] you cleared the earth out and save nor
[1:19:03] but I can't let you do it said you have
[1:19:06] have you considered them said I've
[1:19:09] watched them all night long oh my his
[1:19:13] eye is on the sparrow I know he's
[1:19:15] watching me he knows what we were going
[1:19:18] what you're doing what you're thinking I
[1:19:20] can him say I've watched him all night
[1:19:24] long oh my if he was concerned about
[1:19:26] three how about the thousands that sit
[1:19:30] here of a right that that's in trouble
[1:19:33] sure he is I can hear him say I'll let
[1:19:36] you all go but I can't for I'm going
[1:19:39] myself
[1:19:41] that's a man-sized job
[1:19:44] so I'm going down I could see him rise
[1:19:48] from his chair his priestly garments
[1:19:50] wrapped around him I could see him look
[1:19:54] around way back over here in the in the
[1:19:57] north there's a big Thunder head I can
[1:19:59] hear him say come here each wind west
[1:20:02] wind north and south everything in the
[1:20:05] heavens obey him man knows more about
[1:20:07] student man knows more than he does man
[1:20:11] tries to figure it out the heavens obey
[1:20:13] him obedience is better than sacrifice
[1:20:16] to come here
[1:20:18] he's winds west wind north and south get
[1:20:21] under the Thunder hand over yonder and I
[1:20:23] want to take a trip this morning I could
[1:20:26] see them go over there roll under that
[1:20:28] big Thunder Thunder head come down along
[1:20:31] go aside of the throne he steps off of
[1:20:33] his throne onto that Big Thunder head
[1:20:35] like a chariot I reached over hook them
[1:20:39] four winds to the clouds out there going
[1:20:41] to ride like a chariot get a hold of
[1:20:43] zigzag lightning out the sky crack it
[1:20:51] that the point is God came down and my
[1:20:57] whole point is this there's always
[1:21:01] something going on in the unseen when
[1:21:05] you are in trouble you should all what
[1:21:09] yes
[1:21:10] even when Jesus had to go to Calvary and
[1:21:14] as a man he had gotten weak the Bible
[1:21:18] said an angel came and strengthened him
[1:21:22] yeah he went there a moment it seems
[1:21:25] like you all alone but the time that you
[1:21:28] think you're all alone you're not God is
[1:21:30] always watching and if we could trust
[1:21:34] him and we could obey him by God's grace
[1:21:36] can't you imagine where we would be
[1:21:38] right now if all we would just surrender
[1:21:41] everything to nicest Lord I surrender
[1:21:43] every thought every idea I'm going to
[1:21:47] exalt you almost high I'm gonna put you
[1:21:52] on the throne of my heart I'm gonna make
[1:21:55] you my capstone your
[1:21:58] Lord you must thought you might ever
[1:22:00] ething it may not even come up right now
[1:22:03] but that thought that thing brother
[1:22:05] brothers he says when God put words in
[1:22:07] your mouth and you speak them
[1:22:08] he said they materialize not just words
[1:22:14] when God put words in your mouth and
[1:22:16] causes you to speak them he said didn't
[1:22:19] they become materialized
[1:22:21] he said because God's Word cannot come
[1:22:24] back boy you saw what are you saying
[1:22:27] I'm saying when you speak with this
[1:22:30] stripes I'm healed and you really
[1:22:32] believe that that's God's word that came
[1:22:35] out of your mouth oh I thought to say it
[1:22:37] didn't think it and if you did God gave
[1:22:40] me the thought so it has to come to pass
[1:22:46] you know the devil ain't gonna give it
[1:22:48] to you he's not gonna give you the COO
[1:22:51] he's the one making you sick he knows
[1:22:54] that's God's provided way is that right
[1:22:57] did you know that brother Branham said
[1:22:59] it let me say it like this he went in
[1:23:02] his healing come campaigns he said that
[1:23:04] was God's provided way for people to be
[1:23:06] healed he said well what do you mean
[1:23:08] Jesus Christ even in there in the New
[1:23:10] Jerusalem all of that the Bible said
[1:23:12] there be a tree of life for the healing
[1:23:14] of the nation's
[1:23:16] still Jesus I'm almost done you love the
[1:23:23] Lord I'm a read description i'ma leave
[1:23:26] it with you tonight I trusted something
[1:23:30] happen I hadn't even listened to my
[1:23:31] brother's message yet preeminence I'm
[1:23:34] gonna listen to it though just been busy
[1:23:38] anyway
[1:23:39] Colossians 1:12 through 20 I'm closing
[1:23:42] on this he said given thanks unto the
[1:23:44] father which have made us meet to be
[1:23:46] partakers of the inheritance of the
[1:23:48] Saints in light who have delivered us
[1:23:50] from the powers of darkness and have
[1:23:51] translated us into the kingdom of his
[1:23:53] dear son in whom we have redemption
[1:23:56] through his blood even the forgiveness
[1:23:57] of sin right who is the image of the
[1:24:01] invisible God the firstborn of every
[1:24:03] creature for by him we're all things
[1:24:05] created that are in heaven that on earth
[1:24:07] visible invisible whether they be
[1:24:10] Thrones or dominions or principalities
[1:24:12] the powers all things were created by
[1:24:14] him and for him and he is before all
[1:24:18] things and by him all things consist and
[1:24:20] he is the head of the body the church
[1:24:23] who is the beginning of the first from
[1:24:25] the dead that in all things he might
[1:24:28] have preeminence for it pleased the
[1:24:30] father that in him should all fullness
[1:24:32] dwell and having made peace through the
[1:24:35] blood of his cross by him to reconcile
[1:24:37] all things that to himself
[1:24:39] if by him I say whether they be things
[1:24:42] in earth or things in heaven so what are
[1:24:45] you saying there ain't nothing that can
[1:24:50] stand before a true believer and not be
[1:24:57] conquered everything God puts before you
[1:25:03] he expects you to conquer to overcome it
[1:25:08] y'all hear me everything I said again
[1:25:12] that God lay before you as a test and a
[1:25:16] trial he placed it there because he know
[1:25:19] you can conquer it and he's expecting
[1:25:23] you to conquer that stay we're not of
[1:25:33] this world and if long as we continue to
[1:25:35] think like man we're gonna be just as
[1:25:37] weak but when you start thinking like
[1:25:39] God and where you came from and you know
[1:25:41] that God is on the inside of you and and
[1:25:43] he's given himself to you to be used by
[1:25:46] you us that's what he's here for he is
[1:25:52] the mighty Conqueror not you but he's
[1:25:55] given you himself so he can conquer your
[1:25:58] situations but we got to learn how to
[1:26:01] acknowledge the Lord in all our ways we
[1:26:03] must and that's what I did today
[1:26:05] everything I acknowledged him that's
[1:26:08] just what I'm going to do this I need
[1:26:09] your grace here and me and everything he
[1:26:13] was there my fact things were so smooth
[1:26:15] today I'm like I could Ollie really
[1:26:19] it was so wonderful like Lord I should
[1:26:23] have been doing this all alone you know
[1:26:25] we do it and then we stop and then we do
[1:26:26] it and we stop and we the one we pay the
[1:26:28] consequences but when you put god before
[1:26:31] yourself
[1:26:32] every day you can't help but come out as
[1:26:34] a winner
[1:26:35] let's pray dear Heavenly Father we come
[1:26:39] before your Lord as humbly as we know
[1:26:40] how I don't know how to speak or to
[1:26:44] preach but I try to say the things you
[1:26:47] would have me say father I pray that
[1:26:49] somebody was blessed here tonight
[1:26:51] I pray father God that somebody was
[1:26:53] delivered tonight oh god I pray that
[1:26:55] somebody got what they came for Lord
[1:26:57] with the day and the hour is so intense
[1:27:00] it's just beyond any way that I can
[1:27:03] describe it I don't know how to describe
[1:27:06] this darkness that we face every day but
[1:27:08] I realized oh God that will not come out
[1:27:11] as a winner if we don't keep the light
[1:27:13] turn on father keep our light turned on
[1:27:15] and all the bugs and everything else
[1:27:18] will scatter
[1:27:18] Oh God from this life father we thank
[1:27:21] you for your grace we thank you for
[1:27:23] those who came out to church this
[1:27:24] evening blessed him in a special way let
[1:27:28] them see that we gotta somehow pull our
[1:27:31] way pull ourselves away from the things
[1:27:33] of the world because if we must overcome
[1:27:35] Lord in order to be there in that great
[1:27:39] reunion Lord Jesus work your miracle in
[1:27:43] my life let your life live through me
[1:27:45] 100% and father will be will give you
[1:27:49] the praise glory and honor Lord will be
[1:27:51] like those 24 elders were thrown out on
[1:27:53] our crown because we realized God it's
[1:27:55] your amazing grace help us now change
[1:27:58] our hearts change our minds may our
[1:28:01] minds be like yours in Jesus Christ's
