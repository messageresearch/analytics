[6:42] we stand we appreciate the Lord Psalms
[6:47] 86 please we'll start there and keep
[6:50] moving by God's grace Psalms eight and
[6:54] six
[7:12] thou madest him to have dominion over
[7:16] the works of thy hand thou has put all
[7:20] things under his feet one more scripture
[7:27] first John three one two three
[7:39] such a beautiful day outside thank God
[7:44] for His grace I trust that the Sun will
[7:47] shine in this place amen
[7:51] first John three one through three
[7:55] [Music]
[7:56] it reads behold what manner of love the
[8:03] father has bestowed upon us that we
[8:07] should be called the sons of God
[8:09] therefore the world knoweth us not
[8:12] because it knew him not beloved now are
[8:15] we the sons of God and it does not yet
[8:18] appear what we shall be but we know that
[8:21] when he shall appear we shall be like
[8:23] him for we shall see him as he is and
[8:29] every man that hath this hope in him
[8:32] purifies himself even as he is pure
[8:38] let us pray father we thank you for your
[8:40] grace and your mercy we thank you for
[8:41] everything you've done for us thus far
[8:44] you have been better to us Lord than we
[8:46] have been to ourselves
[8:47] thank you dear Jesus thank you for
[8:50] bringing us long in the dangerous
[8:51] streets and highways without any hurt
[8:53] hummer danger coming upon this Lord
[8:55] thank your father give him a wife a
[8:57] special blessing for driving force Lord
[9:00] and forgive us our any anxieties that we
[9:03] would have inflicted upon her Lord we
[9:06] pray father God that you bless the
[9:08] service in a special way in Jesus
[9:10] Christ's name we pray amen you may be
[9:12] seated I like to just be going on
[9:15] tonight our topic in which I spoke this
[9:19] morning our position in Christ and and
[9:22] what we were working with by God's grace
[9:24] is that we are at a time in a place
[9:26] where we ought to know who we are how
[9:30] long will it take before the bride come
[9:33] to a place to understand who she is now
[9:37] brother Branham tells us that once we
[9:38] come into that place we will become an
[9:41] invincible army and I think they are the
[9:44] word army kind of makes people think
[9:47] that it's gonna be such great group but
[9:49] as individual we will collect
[9:52] and connect with one another at whatever
[9:55] specific time that God has ordained for
[9:58] us to do so I mean if it's just two or
[10:01] three on the side two or three will
[10:03] become the army of God remember now God
[10:06] took one man and as an army by the name
[10:10] of Moses and invaded Egypt so you've got
[10:13] to understand when God's a army he
[10:14] doesn't necessarily mean a great host of
[10:17] people because even when it came to
[10:20] Gideon God didn't use 30,000 at the time
[10:24] God used about 300 that couldn't to
[10:27] destroy about a few thousand so God had
[10:30] to you know his his way of counting is
[10:34] not the way we count but we understand
[10:38] that I'm one man can be an army for God
[10:40] is that right oh it is that way even
[10:44] among the Angels wormwood said Lord I
[10:47] destroyed the earth amen in an ant
[10:50] eluvian day let me go down and I'll turn
[10:54] everything upside down so you've got to
[10:56] realize amen God doesn't need plural as
[10:59] we see it he in a vast number he can use
[11:04] two or three is that right where two or
[11:07] three are gathered in my name there I am
[11:09] in the mist and that's all you need amen
[11:12] when we talk about our position you and
[11:15] I must understand the Bible says now are
[11:18] we the sons of God and I was as I was
[11:21] saying to the church this morning
[11:22] God is not talking about a now in your
[11:25] head he's talking about our now in your
[11:27] heart you understand me this is the
[11:29] throne of God this is where God operates
[11:32] not here he rules on the throne of your
[11:36] heart is that right this is why David
[11:40] said yea though I walk through the
[11:42] valley in the shadow of death I will
[11:44] fear no evil because thou art with me
[11:48] any man when God is with you you are the
[11:51] majority not the minority now I'll
[11:54] prepare the table before me in the
[11:56] presence of my enemies now I've known as
[11:58] my head with oil my cup runneth over
[12:01] amen so we understand
[12:03] that even in this battle and like I said
[12:07] once you come to understand your
[12:09] position like God said I would that you
[12:12] be the head and not the tail is that
[12:15] right so you and I must understand that
[12:17] whenever we are in battle if we will
[12:20] properly take our position we come out
[12:23] as a victim it is only when we wreck we
[12:26] do not recognize our position in Christ
[12:30] he is undefeated hallelujah and you and
[12:35] I must understand greater is He that is
[12:37] in us that in he that is in the world
[12:39] and remember I said not in your head is
[12:42] in your heart
[12:43] once the revelation of God is in your
[12:45] heart you become the greater room not
[12:49] the less than the greater so knowing
[12:52] that position as we know by God's grace
[12:55] amen there there is a church called the
[12:58] Queen of Heaven
[12:59] but you and I must understand that we
[13:01] are the Queen of Heaven we are the real
[13:04] Queen of Heaven you can't be a queen
[13:08] without authority hallelujah and that's
[13:11] what Jesus said after which the Holy
[13:13] Ghost is come upon you you shall receive
[13:16] authority that word power there means
[13:19] Authority and and in the prophet of God
[13:22] picked it up like this all that God was
[13:24] in God he pulled it into Christ all that
[13:26] was in Christ he pulled it into the
[13:28] church is that right and Jesus said if
[13:32] you abide in the vine and the vine abide
[13:35] in you you can add whatsoever you will
[13:38] Dominion that means you are the ruler
[13:43] you and I are the ruler is that right if
[13:47] the seers are open which they are and
[13:49] the shields put us back as the prophet
[13:52] of God said back into the day of Eden
[13:55] before the fall hallelujah before the
[14:00] fall that means we have dominion
[14:04] now we don't wait to heaven to get
[14:06] dominion is right when you when you talk
[14:08] about healing remember let's say why
[14:10] would we need a man healing
[14:13] the millennium when you already
[14:14] supernatural the millennium comes after
[14:18] the rapture after the rapture you have a
[14:21] supernatural body which we call a
[14:24] glorified body a man you never get sick
[14:28] you never get tired you never get weary
[14:31] but know your position because remember
[14:34] I told you that you and I must
[14:38] understand we are now the I am NOT the
[14:44] what I was or that I used to be Paul
[14:47] said we are Jesus Christ as he is we are
[14:53] in this world as he is not as he's going
[14:58] to be as he is as he ever said again as
[15:03] he is because what we do we allow this
[15:07] dimension to confuse us time cannot
[15:11] affect eternity hallelujah and we can
[15:19] see ourselves as he is we become either
[15:22] invincible that thought even brings on a
[15:26] translation as he is God is a spirit God
[15:33] is the only potentate
[15:35] he's Alpha he's Omega he's the beginning
[15:39] he's the ending he is and as he is so
[15:44] are we in this world we become
[15:47] invincible is that right
[15:50] see there was a church that was
[15:52] invincible in that church according to
[15:55] plan by way of political power and
[15:57] science the Catholic Church used to be
[16:00] invincible but Luther godly anointed a
[16:03] man by the name of Luther far because
[16:06] Luther recognized his position in Christ
[16:09] is that right if you can understand by
[16:12] God's grace and then the just shall live
[16:15] by faith
[16:16] I look up that faith by Bobby's the
[16:20] tortured one where says to get already
[16:24] rotted I can't
[16:26] here by car you understand me a man and
[16:29] through faith needs to come in from one
[16:31] way and go out the other right through
[16:35] faith Sara receive strength in other one
[16:39] she had to go through something for her
[16:42] full of faith to gain momentum minam hey
[16:45] man but if you ride know something you
[16:47] are doing nothing but resting right
[16:50] because it is the vehicle that you're
[16:53] riding on this taking you where you need
[16:55] to go and the just shall live by his
[16:59] faith all you have to all we have to do
[17:02] is get on his faith and ride it right no
[17:07] effort on our parts other than we get on
[17:10] it and let faith take us where we need
[17:13] to go Robert is that Alright
[17:16] hallelujah that's exactly what Rebecca
[17:19] did she got on that camel and that
[17:22] Campbell took her where she needed to go
[17:24] is that right
[17:25] brother branham rockin that Campbell as
[17:27] the anointing of God if you get into
[17:30] Christ you get on there nodding and that
[17:33] anointing will take you from earth to
[17:35] glory you understand me
[17:37] understanding your position so you can
[17:40] understand Rebecca understood her
[17:42] position when she made the choice to go
[17:45] with her in-laws she knew she was going
[17:47] to meet Isaac her husband she understood
[17:51] Amen that Ellie's ax was the vessel in
[17:54] which Abraham sent to bring her to Isaac
[18:02] but she didn't ride on ELISA she rolled
[18:06] on the caravel she wrote on Christ
[18:08] hallelujah
[18:10] it was the anointing that took her to
[18:13] Eleazar um excuse me tires excuse me so
[18:17] you must understand what I'm trying to
[18:18] say people don't understand the position
[18:22] in Christ and we're constantly looking
[18:25] back constantly looking back it's our
[18:29] right to see what brother Branham has
[18:31] done he's done what he's supposed to do
[18:33] but if we don't allow that same
[18:36] anointing
[18:40] like Elijah said Elisha said where is
[18:43] the god of Elijah he knew where he lied
[18:46] to us but he wanted to see the god of
[18:49] Elijah and the god of Elijah came on the
[18:52] scene and that's when he got a double
[18:54] portion is that right so you and I must
[18:57] understand what God is doing coming from
[19:01] the scripture according to Exodus 39 39
[19:03] 30 and 31 and they made and in here Dave
[19:07] at Moses is talking about the temple and
[19:10] what goes in the temple and what goes in
[19:12] the on the priests garments and
[19:13] everything else but here
[19:15] he's literally working with the crown
[19:16] that crowns the high priest and the high
[19:19] priest was a shadow on a type of the
[19:22] Lord Jesus right because he's the priest
[19:24] of all priests is that right he's me
[19:27] McKellar Dec y'all understand me so we
[19:29] know that it was a sin to go into the
[19:32] Holies of Holies amen as a sinner you
[19:36] had to go through justification you had
[19:38] to come through the brazen altar right
[19:40] you had to be washed you had to go
[19:41] through the lava you had to do all of
[19:43] that tape man and wash away your sin you
[19:46] had to come amen into the holy place
[19:47] which represent the golden candlesticks
[19:50] in' and those golden candlesticks
[19:52] represented seven church ages and those
[19:54] in that time the ministry the priests
[19:57] not the not the high priests but the
[19:58] priests itself was allowed to keep that
[20:01] lit and everything else is that right
[20:04] represented those church aides
[20:06] messengers that had to come and minister
[20:08] to the bride of those ages right but we
[20:12] understand that those candles could go
[20:14] out is that right and according to
[20:17] Matthew 25 those candles went out
[20:20] something without because it said three
[20:23] I'm your lamp right and somewhere the
[20:27] foolish version didn't trim and she
[20:30] found out that her oil was gone and the
[20:32] lights went out and you and I must
[20:35] understand but the foolish virgins
[20:37] trimmed her left youngest and me the
[20:40] ministry of the prophet of god the
[20:42] ministry of Malachi 4 came to gather us
[20:45] to a place where we can trim our lips
[20:50] get all the wax get all of the bee
[20:53] up off get all other decrees and the dog
[20:56] was and everything that had been been
[20:58] been been built up on these particular
[21:01] Church messengers and their ages we
[21:05] trimmed it all off and then so we could
[21:08] do what find our way to that Holies of
[21:12] Holies because you got to understand if
[21:15] those loves if that lamp wasn't burning
[21:17] it was pitch dark hallelujah because
[21:22] there is no sunlight for them
[21:24] pitch dark there so you needed a mint
[21:27] the seven golden candle you needed that
[21:29] camera to light the way to get into the
[21:33] Holies of Holies
[21:34] but once getting into the Holies of
[21:37] Holies
[21:38] you didn't need those lamps because
[21:41] behind the curtain was as a kind of
[21:44] glory
[21:45] so here Amen we find that Moses is
[21:49] saying here in in the 31st and they made
[21:52] a plate of the holy crown of pure gold
[21:55] and wrote upon it in a writing like to
[21:59] in the engraving of a signet holiness to
[22:02] the Lord and as I said even in this
[22:05] morning when you a crown represents
[22:08] something it represents victory
[22:11] somewhere you have won a contest for an
[22:15] example when they crown Miss America and
[22:19] they put that crown on her head Miss
[22:22] America is representing all of America
[22:25] right and she her beauty is a reflection
[22:30] of the country right because they have
[22:33] chosen the most beautiful the most
[22:35] talented supposedly woman to wear the
[22:39] crown hallelujah
[22:41] but here amen in this crown Amen that
[22:44] this is the high priest is wearing he
[22:47] says holiness to the Lord so what I'm
[22:50] trying to say is that the crown not only
[22:53] represents the faith the face of the
[22:57] person but it also represents the body
[23:00] the whole body is holiness to the Lord
[23:04] and it's crown with deity
[23:08] so you got to understand by God's grace
[23:11] and then it is crowned with deity and
[23:15] you all have seen the Catholic Church
[23:17] and they have those martyrs those might
[23:20] sir I might not pronounce it right mi T
[23:22] ar e which is a crown which is something
[23:25] that were wears you wear and it goes out
[23:27] like this
[23:28] it's kind of like a pyramid because
[23:29] that's the way it's supposed to be and
[23:31] that's the way it was with the priests
[23:33] they had this thing that went up kind of
[23:35] like to a point type of thing which was
[23:37] was that the type of a capstone is that
[23:41] right so you got to say well what are
[23:42] you trying to say brother Brooks because
[23:44] that high priest represented you and me
[23:51] cause see though you got to understand
[23:53] that's why you say what do you mean you
[23:56] got to understand that only the high
[23:58] priest was allowed to go beyond the
[24:01] curtain into the holy holy not just a
[24:04] regular priest you understand me
[24:07] for an example Abraham had a lot of
[24:09] children but all of them were not
[24:11] adopted hallelujah all of them then get
[24:15] full sonship only those who were adopted
[24:21] became Abraham's air right all that came
[24:26] by Isaac was two chosen so you got to
[24:29] understand so in this day everybody
[24:33] can't go behind the veil only those whom
[24:36] God has predestinated as the election
[24:39] right because Isaac was election and you
[24:44] and I must understand if you are under
[24:46] this message you have been chosen and
[24:49] elected to go behind the veil it is your
[24:54] inheritance right
[24:58] that's why Hebrew said that Jesus Christ
[25:01] has gone beyond the veil he has an
[25:04] anchor you understand me i Iike behind
[25:09] them they are anchor and I call her
[25:11] anchoring of the soul well behind
[25:15] in the Vale that means you're tied to
[25:18] the Inca you behind the veil and his
[25:21] purpose was this it meant that your soul
[25:24] go there come on somebody and won't be
[25:29] able to move knowing your position
[25:34] people say well what do you mean
[25:36] brothers i'ma tell y'all something
[25:38] David was king before he was crowned
[25:42] king he was an altered king he knew he
[25:46] was king he acted like a king he took
[25:49] the position of a king is that right
[25:52] his brothers were far more older than he
[25:54] was but when it came to define fighting
[25:57] Goliath he took his position Emin and
[26:01] the keen usually go out to battle first
[26:04] a real king gets in front of the army
[26:09] hallelujah to go battle and he went to
[26:12] battle Goliath somebody help me here see
[26:15] that's what I'm saying we can't as a
[26:17] bride of Jesus Christ we must understand
[26:20] we must take our position right the the
[26:24] decadence a denominations are back in
[26:27] the background they are afraid of what's
[26:30] happening here but there's got to be an
[26:32] anointed David somewhere that's going to
[26:35] take this position and defeat Goliath it
[26:40] must happen but you and I must
[26:42] understand we need the inspiration we
[26:45] need the anointing we need the
[26:47] revelation of who we are in this day you
[26:50] can't just move on your own it take God
[26:53] to unfold to you who you are and what
[26:57] time it is as what David said wait a
[27:02] minute
[27:03] is there not a cause look at what's
[27:07] happening around us is there not a cause
[27:10] somebody must be anointed a man to make
[27:14] this thing Leah y'all believe brother
[27:23] Branham had to hold the Holy Ghost
[27:25] brother Balin said I wish I could heal
[27:29] everybody he said but I can't why
[27:34] couldn't he he had the Holy Ghost he had
[27:38] to wait for his he had to wait to God
[27:43] inspired a God told him what to do
[27:46] hello somebody that's why we don't
[27:49] suddenly lay hand on people why because
[27:53] if God don't tell you to lay hand on
[27:55] somebody you can be taking something off
[27:57] of them that God put on it and if you
[28:00] take it off God gonna get you for doing
[28:03] it that's why I always say Lord not my
[28:05] will but let thine be done
[28:07] hmm but the true church sees you 19
[28:12] she's coming to a place where she's
[28:14] beginning to see who she is because
[28:16] she's looking around and she knows she's
[28:19] not like the other girls is that right
[28:22] when whenever all ranches son died
[28:25] ranches are the ranches son needed a
[28:29] wife dad old girl who was washing dishes
[28:32] knew she was not like the other girls
[28:35] and somewhere in this message you've got
[28:38] to come to see you're not like everybody
[28:41] else I don't care if they're wearing the
[28:45] message garment you must understand
[28:47] you're not like the others they can be
[28:50] flirtatious they can do all the dances
[28:53] they can do everything but were you you
[28:56] are right when you're supposed to be
[28:58] you're working on character whoo and you
[29:03] can't do what they do
[29:04] you can't go where they go you can't act
[29:08] what they uh-huh oh yeah you're just a
[29:11] man do you have the saint yes millions
[29:15] would come out of Egypt and there were
[29:17] two and said we're not like those other
[29:20] girls they shouted they dance they
[29:25] played the tambourine hallelujah but
[29:28] there was two jobs when Carol said no no
[29:30] no we're gonna stay with the word y'all
[29:32] can do what you got to do but we staying
[29:34] with the word hallelujah is that right
[29:39] your position we're not at the end of
[29:42] this thing per tail we're at the head
[29:45] this is where we are we're where the
[29:48] head ship is to come and have full
[29:52] control over the body is that right and
[29:55] that's where we are right now the head
[29:58] ship is come is that right the seal of
[30:02] God has been opened the pillar of fire
[30:06] has returned and that purified no matter
[30:11] see what you got to understand is that
[30:13] Moses was Anna's own leader Moses was a
[30:16] follower he fathered the pillar fire he
[30:20] fathered the pillar of cloud he knew who
[30:23] his headship was and as he followed the
[30:27] pillar cloud the people followed him
[30:33] somebody helped me here so you and I
[30:36] understand when when it comes to
[30:38] lukewarmness we understand when you find
[30:41] yourself in a place of lukewarmness and
[30:43] you have become frommel and you have
[30:45] become powerless brother branham like
[30:48] anna as the spirit of the Antichrist
[30:52] it is the Antichrist that makes you like
[30:55] that Hey so all I'm weary I'm tired but
[30:59] listen no matter how weary and the tire
[31:01] you get there ought to be still joy on
[31:04] the inside and the Bible says a man that
[31:08] in the presence of the Lord
[31:10] there's form this old joy he that
[31:17] overcometh the Bible says the same shall
[31:20] be clothed in white raiment and I will
[31:23] not blot out his name out of the book of
[31:25] life but I will confess his name before
[31:28] my father and before the Angels that
[31:33] means you got to overcome like I said
[31:36] this morning you must also realize that
[31:38] there are books that are being written
[31:41] everything you think everything you do
[31:44] if not confess is braced in the book is
[31:49] that right even the prophet of God when
[31:52] was dead behind the door when he would
[31:55] force he criticized the lady with purple
[31:57] hair and purple nails and purple this
[31:59] that and the other wherever she look he
[32:01] said lord I don't even know how you put
[32:03] up with this stuff you need to you know
[32:04] you were to destroy it causes
[32:06] come on behind the door all right
[32:09] sometime God has a call as a side it
[32:11] meant for us to see how we can arrested
[32:14] we are without the blood of Jesus God
[32:18] don't like surprises miss God want
[32:21] somebody who can humble himself
[32:24] hallelujah is that right the Pharisees
[32:27] in the sconces that you know in the
[32:29] marketplace law you can know that I paid
[32:31] my time and Lord you know I've been
[32:34] doing this knob Lord you know I've been
[32:36] given to the power yet that little
[32:38] publican smoked his breath this is God
[32:41] I'm not even worthy to call on your name
[32:43] and Jesus said which one you think will
[32:46] be received that man who knows is he or
[32:50] she is nothing hallelujah
[32:53] you know we God has made of everything
[32:56] but without God with nothing hallelujah
[33:00] is that right listen
[33:01] revelation says and they sung a new song
[33:05] saying down I'd rather to take the book
[33:07] and to open the seals thereof for thou
[33:10] was slain and have redeemed us to God by
[33:13] the blood of our every kindred and
[33:15] tongue and people and nation and have
[33:17] made us unto our God kings and priests
[33:20] and that's the thing we've always
[33:22] quoting that but we hardly ever see
[33:25] anybody take that position when you're
[33:27] gonna do it when are we going to do it
[33:31] we must come to know our position is
[33:35] that right when brother Branham he
[33:37] didn't first he at the first he didn't
[33:39] know he was a prophet he didn't even
[33:41] know he was the prophet of Malachi for
[33:43] he evolved into the littlest God brought
[33:48] him into it God even used a witch to
[33:53] tell him that you was born on a special
[33:55] day y'all understand me he didn't know
[33:59] and he was trying to get away from the
[34:01] witch and here we was the gift of God to
[34:05] the
[34:06] and yet he did not as of yet knew he
[34:09] didn't know it
[34:11] hello when he first met his first wife
[34:14] he didn't know who he was God sent him
[34:18] down there to those Pentecostals and his
[34:20] mother Lord talked him out of it
[34:24] had he known Louisville he would have
[34:27] stayed there
[34:29] he literally changed the events of time
[34:33] that's what he said had he remarried to
[34:36] stay there no telling what his ministry
[34:38] would have blossom out into but anyway
[34:42] my point is God has an appointed time
[34:45] for us to come to recognize who we
[34:48] really are but as you're moving he
[34:52] wasn't backing up he kept moving forward
[34:55] even through all his trials even through
[34:58] his tests he kept moving forward and you
[35:00] and I must continue to move forward no
[35:03] matter how many times we falter no
[35:05] matter how many times we fail God is
[35:09] going to bring us like I said the other
[35:11] day as long you got to go down before
[35:13] you come up getting numb but the truth
[35:17] you got to go down before you come up
[35:20] most of us know what we used to be we
[35:24] went down before we came up to this and
[35:28] in this time in this present time you
[35:31] and I must recognized this that when
[35:34] each trial like I wanted to say this
[35:37] morning I didn't just chance to say it
[35:39] when when God said they have become as
[35:42] we are knowing good and evil
[35:50] the lamb was slain before the foundation
[35:54] of the world and God knew before Adam
[36:02] fell that evil was coming matter of fact
[36:07] he put the tree there he made it there
[36:11] and he gave them the choice but he knew
[36:14] what they were going to do because he
[36:16] also knew in order for us a beat
[36:19] like him we had no girl from evil and
[36:24] since that tree since that fall we have
[36:29] been worked by good and evil you can't
[36:34] get out of it I don't care if you go to
[36:36] a monastery evil is there because you
[36:40] are there huh you don't have to teach a
[36:46] child to lie evil is dead you don't have
[36:51] to teach a child to be jealous
[36:53] evil is there you understand me so I'm
[36:57] saying this is why the scripture picks
[37:00] it up all things work together for the
[37:03] good of them that love the Lord you will
[37:06] do wrong you're going to do evil but I'm
[37:09] gonna work it around for your good
[37:13] hallelujah is that right
[37:15] the Bible according revelation the third
[37:16] chapter said calm try me I'm calling you
[37:21] try it gold tried in the fire hallelujah
[37:28] that means that man there's going to be
[37:30] a fire that's going to try you but it
[37:34] will burn all of the worldliness out of
[37:37] you all of the drug will come out of you
[37:41] hallelujah by way of fire
[37:44] thinking that strange when you father to
[37:47] divers temptation knowing that the
[37:49] trying of your faith is more precious
[37:51] than gold whoo
[37:54] like I try to tell people I said you
[37:56] know according to the Word of God Exodus
[38:00] the fourth chapter Amen here it was they
[38:02] meant Moses should have circumcised his
[38:05] his sons and he didn't he forgot he got
[38:08] busy and his wife Zipporah see that's
[38:11] what I'm saying that wives support
[38:14] represents the church Moses represents
[38:17] the preacher but the church should never
[38:21] forget her children needs to be
[38:24] circumcised and guess what every surah
[38:30] every one that's not circle
[38:32] sighs we'll be put away it didn't matter
[38:37] if he was Jewish you had to be
[38:40] circumcised you've got to have the Holy
[38:43] Ghost hey if you don't get it
[38:49] let me read it the way the Prophet says
[38:51] he said and where we are doing today
[38:53] that's where the Holiness Church has
[38:55] failed
[38:56] we've got too much time the Lord has got
[39:00] give us a lot of money we've got
[39:02] buildings great big churches and big
[39:05] spires and putting less seats and pipe
[39:09] organs until we've got the seal of God
[39:11] until we forgot the seal of God is that
[39:15] right what good is it going to do us
[39:18] with all the deep message Rees what good
[39:21] is going to do you amen the knowing God
[39:23] sent a prophet and the seven seals are
[39:25] open and the thunders and all of these
[39:26] said what good is it gonna do you it's
[39:29] just gonna give you an intellectual
[39:30] revival that ain't what we need we need
[39:34] the seal of God is that right Ezekiel
[39:38] shouted he said he said you told that
[39:41] angel kill and destroy everything that
[39:43] doesn't have the mark of God in their
[39:46] forehand hallelujah kill it all lock it
[39:51] all
[39:51] tear it up from the young to the old
[39:55] from the ancient to the young y'all
[39:57] knows nobody that's right every male is
[40:07] in Egypt of Israel that wasn't
[40:09] circumcised was cut off circumcision was
[40:13] the seal of the promise and circumcision
[40:16] of the Old Testament is the baptism of
[40:18] the Holy Ghost of the new y'all hear me
[40:21] it must be done he we don't have an
[40:24] option I don't get all right I'm right
[40:27] but there's got to be a manifestation of
[40:30] it but that right what good is this
[40:34] lightbulb if I cut it on and it won't
[40:36] light up yeah you gotta have some power
[40:41] inside it has to have some kind of
[40:44] mechanism
[40:45] that will connect with the power in
[40:47] there that's going to illuminate it
[40:50] otherwise the barbers room just might as
[40:53] well just throw it away
[40:54] what good is a Christian if there is no
[40:56] light if there is no light
[40:59] people can see Christ in you what is
[41:03] that you're a dead light bulb right
[41:07] people need to see Jesus and if they
[41:10] can't see Jesus what good like think
[41:12] about it if the salt loses Savior if you
[41:16] can't help something be preserved you're
[41:18] no good is that right and the Bible
[41:22] tells us that the bride or the children
[41:24] of God
[41:25] we are the salt of the earth we are the
[41:28] preserver but once once we lose our
[41:33] preservative of being able to preserve
[41:35] what glue you if you become like the
[41:37] world you just like the world you just
[41:39] as good as this dirt you might as well
[41:42] be trotted upon you understand me
[41:49] everything has a season is that right we
[41:53] have a winter summer spring and fall and
[41:55] we need all of it
[41:57] right we need that spring we need that
[42:00] summer we need that fall and we need
[42:02] that winter those seasons were given to
[42:05] us any Christians have four seasons hmm
[42:10] but I can guarantee you even if that
[42:12] tree could talk that tree would say oh
[42:15] I'm so glad the sun is shining in the
[42:18] right place now could see the Sun don't
[42:22] never stop shining it's just ain't
[42:24] shining exactly where you wanted to
[42:26] shine hallelujah amen but you want that
[42:30] Sun to shine in the right place so like
[42:32] and little so you can live through that
[42:36] the life is in you we all go through it
[42:41] but don't mean we finished because you
[42:44] know what happens right you go down and
[42:47] the grave the SAP goes down and you may
[42:49] stop right there right for the winter
[42:52] but when the summer comes and that SAP
[42:54] began to move again guess where you get
[42:56] new lives you get
[42:58] new leaves and in if you're mature
[43:00] enough you get some fruit if it's a
[43:04] fruit tree so you gotta understand
[43:06] knowing your position one thing I love
[43:07] about trees is that they don't get up
[43:10] and walk I thought about my trees and I
[43:15] said Oh Lord I'm glad I'm one of those
[43:17] walking trees I'm a human being right
[43:21] but I think about the other day when
[43:23] that coal was blowing and woohoo Lord
[43:25] and that tree was just catching couldn't
[43:28] even put on the overcoat hallelujah but
[43:32] God has a way of preserving his life by
[43:34] allowing that SAP to go down into the
[43:37] root and guess what the thing that would
[43:39] have been cold one day - it was becomes
[43:42] a blanket is that Alright whoo you love
[43:52] the Lord when we look and see by God's
[43:55] grace how God has been so good to us and
[44:00] you think you're what do you mean
[44:02] brother books I'm saying
[44:03] did you know let me read this according
[44:06] to numbers 21 and 14 it says wherefore
[44:08] is it said in the book of wars of the
[44:12] law when I heard that I'm like wow you
[44:15] mean to tell me that there's a book of
[44:18] wars all the wars that Israel go through
[44:22] are recorded and I thought if that be
[44:26] the case all of our wars all of our
[44:30] battles and guess what God just don't
[44:34] put out the good ones only there are
[44:38] times the Israel was on the run and God
[44:41] put it right there in there you know the
[44:44] only thing that we erase your bad wars
[44:46] it's the blood of Jesus the blood of
[44:50] Jesus make you a conqueror the blood of
[44:54] Jesus make you victorious every time why
[44:57] because he became our righteousness
[45:01] where we failed he won he becomes our
[45:07] righteousness when right we become scuse
[45:11] me
[45:12] we've become his righteousness and he
[45:14] becomes our sin oh I love that cuz every
[45:19] time the devil think he's got me it's an
[45:23] illusion
[45:24] the devil can never get me he could
[45:29] never get you you so what do you mean
[45:32] let me tell you something
[45:33] even though was it Wesley I think that
[45:36] had a sink I know when Wesley which one
[45:38] of those three they did they smoked
[45:41] Luther Luther smoked and I think it was
[45:44] Luther Wesley one of the two thought
[45:45] that Israel was the Antichrist hello but
[45:49] they're all spear was in the palm seven
[45:53] stars in the palm is head yet they made
[45:57] mistakes but their mistakes were not in
[46:03] a place to condemn them or to make them
[46:07] lose because they were already in the
[46:10] body hello somebody twelve disciples all
[46:15] of them were different all of them made
[46:19] mistakes and yet their throne set
[46:22] they're in heaven waiting for them
[46:24] hallelujah
[46:25] you and I must understand we must know
[46:28] our position when you come into Christ
[46:30] about said you are now sitting in
[46:33] heavenly places in Christ Jesus I didn't
[46:37] say all hear him I didn't say all around
[46:39] him I said in him and guess what no
[46:42] matter how bad your life seemed to be
[46:44] and how dark is seem to be if you are in
[46:47] Christ you are in light because God said
[46:52] there I know there is no darkness in him
[46:54] I don't know how he does it but that's
[46:58] what the Bible says in him there is no
[47:01] darkness do you think about it there all
[47:08] right there's only one church and that
[47:11] means that they are born into the body
[47:15] of Jesus Christ by the baptism of the
[47:18] oligos and that's why the devil tricked
[47:21] this age he tricked the age and he said
[47:24] yo you got the Holy Ghost
[47:26] out oh you got the holy ghost of his
[47:29] speaking tongues
[47:30] oh you got the holy ghost if you can
[47:32] prophesy oh you got the holy ghost of
[47:35] your faith for the church all of that is
[47:37] good yet all of that is nonsense hmm
[47:45] Nicodemus you're faithful but you must
[47:51] be born again
[47:53] huh people is not hard you said while
[47:57] you're sitting there brother books
[47:59] weren't being born again is just as hard
[48:02] as it was for Mary Mayer said lord I
[48:06] don't know how this thing gonna be but
[48:08] be it unto me according to your word all
[48:10] she had to do is receive it Rahab like I
[48:16] said this morning all we have had to do
[48:22] was receive the spies and she got
[48:26] eternal life he's the same yesterday
[48:30] today forever
[48:32] a pardon is not a pardon except to be
[48:36] received as a party everything has to be
[48:41] received
[48:42] it is a gift it is the gift of God
[48:45] eternal life is a gift of God you don't
[48:49] lack for it but you've gotta learn how
[48:51] to receive it hey that Alright she let
[49:01] me tell you brother there's all these
[49:04] not by shaking of hands and neither
[49:06] about water baptism of sprinkling nor
[49:08] does not stop eating meat or keeping
[49:10] Sabbath day
[49:11] but but by quitting smoking if I quit
[49:13] smoking oh if I stop chewing if I stop
[49:15] drinking if I stop swearing all these
[49:18] things that's not the way into Christ
[49:20] this is up all those things and still be
[49:24] lost it ain't your works it's the grace
[49:29] of God smoking cigarettes drinking
[49:31] whiskey running around with other women
[49:34] unlawfully and all these things that you
[49:37] - that's not sin that's not seeing
[49:41] cursing and swearing and drinking
[49:43] that's not sin that's the attributes of
[49:46] sin mmm what makes you do it but that
[49:52] isn't Searcy that's attributes is of it
[49:54] y'all know what it is right
[49:56] unbelief make you do it somewhere you're
[49:59] not believing who you are you're not
[50:01] where you are you're not recognizing
[50:03] your position in Christ hallelujah is
[50:06] that okay Oh Minister truth
[50:10] that's where people get mixed up the
[50:14] reason you curse smoke drink get angry
[50:17] and fly off the handle things like that
[50:19] is because you are a sinner
[50:23] that's not sin it's because you are
[50:26] you're a sinner jesus said the scripture
[50:28] says he that believeth not is condemned
[50:31] already hello it's not all those things
[50:36] that make your sinner he that believeth
[50:39] not is condemned already you don't need
[50:47] to know how it's going to be done but if
[50:49] you believe it's going to be done you
[50:52] are believer Abraham you won't have a
[50:58] son in roie I don't know how it's going
[51:02] to be done but I believe it's going to
[51:03] be done and the Bible said Abraham
[51:05] staggered not at the promise of God
[51:08] that's where we are I don't care how
[51:11] long it takes God's gonna do it mm-hmm
[51:24] one thing about Joshua he came to know
[51:27] who he was when a man is fighting about
[51:30] and he saw that he needed some extra
[51:32] sunlight to do it he was one of those
[51:37] oddball he's he's a hot dog
[51:39] Sean stand still he didn't say Oh son
[51:44] would you please stand still oh he
[51:47] commanded
[51:48] sunny spoke to it as though he owned it
[51:54] Sun stand still
[51:58] hello he didn't even say all Jehovah
[52:02] help me now
[52:03] he knew his position and when you come
[52:07] to know your position you have the mouth
[52:10] you have the word to come and to speak
[52:16] is that right
[52:17] I'll remember that Mexican baby who had
[52:19] cancer of the mouth and the doctors
[52:21] tried to operate it and and the Prophet
[52:24] God said there ain't a cancer got angry
[52:27] and the baby's mouth and everything
[52:28] swole up even bigger and the prophet of
[52:31] God sitting there you know feeling sorry
[52:33] for the baby and he was waiting on God
[52:35] then the Holy Spirit says but I'm
[52:38] waiting on you
[52:40] see all the time we wait on him
[52:42] sometimes God puts you in a position
[52:45] where you've got to do something he want
[52:48] to see your compassion is that right
[52:51] he said never before as a cross-eyed
[52:54] baby come before me and did not lead
[52:58] them with their eyes straightened why
[53:01] because of his little Sharon rose when
[53:04] she died the pain was so excruciating
[53:06] her eyes cross so what happened God he
[53:10] said it was a training period he didn't
[53:13] understand that God was training him so
[53:16] that when he would come across every
[53:18] cross-eyed baby
[53:19] he could have the compassion and the
[53:21] love to - to it fact that God could use
[53:24] it to heal that child see a lot of time
[53:27] we go through stuff we don't even
[53:28] realize God is doing that he's training
[53:31] you some of the suffering we go through
[53:34] is for other people and not ourselves
[53:39] help me Jesus coming to know who we are
[53:44] like I said we can't keep looking back
[53:46] you know when you look back but let me
[53:48] talk about that he said only frogs was
[53:51] back and he said that's unclean and you
[53:56] and I must understand we can't keep
[53:58] looking back
[54:00] is on the bride it is on the ride and
[54:04] guess what onward Christian soldiers
[54:07] marching as to war with the cross of
[54:11] Jesus marching on before it is Christ
[54:14] our eyes on him I love the scripture
[54:28] according to Hebrews 4:11 forces by
[54:31] faith Abel offered unto God a more
[54:33] excellent sacrifice than Cain , what was
[54:38] that we would have never known that King
[54:42] was more like an intellectual he thought
[54:45] whatever his vegetables were his
[54:47] religion was his ability to grow crops
[54:50] his ability to make a pure are beautiful
[54:53] and all he just lined the altar up with
[54:55] them and everything else why could not
[54:59] God accept that because that's not what
[55:02] he required hallelujah
[55:04] God interested in all the ones who do
[55:08] he wasn't one thing from you and that is
[55:11] for you to accept the bloody bleeding
[55:14] lamb the Word of God that was slain
[55:20] before the foundation of the law that's
[55:22] what gets you into the gate this Alea
[55:29] yes we work we work we do what we do
[55:33] because we love God if you love me
[55:36] you'll keep my Commandments hallelujah
[55:39] but I do not work the only time I walked
[55:42] was I labored to enter into his rest but
[55:49] your works don't save you it's good to
[55:51] do it but it doesn't is that right
[55:55] the work was finished the Bible says
[55:58] according Hebrews the works were
[56:00] finished before the foundation of the
[56:03] world so how can your work to do
[56:04] anything when it was all ready to finish
[56:06] we'll finish that Jesus did and we list
[56:09] it when he hung around the causes that
[56:11] it is finished all the works
[56:15] everything was done everything was
[56:18] completed when he says it's finished but
[56:20] in the mind of God when he said that it
[56:23] was before the foundation of the world
[56:25] it is finished and it was finished
[56:28] before the foundation of the world
[56:29] why did you how do you listen people let
[56:32] me say like this in closing when those
[56:34] Old Testament Saints got grace from God
[56:37] where did the grace come from it came
[56:41] from the beginning it came by way of the
[56:44] lamb did and it comes by the way of the
[56:47] lamb now and the prophet of God said
[56:49] they were able to glean from that Oh
[56:55] somebody help me here I'm almost done
[56:58] you love the Lord nineteen wrote Exodus
[57:09] 19 9 and the Lord said unto Moses lo I
[57:13] come to thee in a thick cloud that the
[57:15] people may hear let me before I finish
[57:18] reading this let me let me say remember
[57:19] that John Ryan I think it was John Ryan
[57:21] the blind man right extra extra read all
[57:24] about it he got back in the line several
[57:25] times there brother Brown you told me I
[57:27] was healed and he's in brother and said
[57:29] but I told you said you believe right
[57:31] see to say I believe one thing is that
[57:33] it believers the kind that God is
[57:36] looking for is a revelation something
[57:39] that strikes your heart right then it is
[57:41] done and once it strike your heart then
[57:44] things happens right cuz he said oh I
[57:47] believe brother Adam but it was just
[57:49] only from the air it was an intellectual
[57:51] faith as a prophet God said is that
[57:53] right and so many people have
[57:54] intellectual say God don't can use that
[57:57] he means this thing this dis dis this
[57:59] coming from the heart it must come from
[58:02] there in order for God to respond so to
[58:08] say I believe brother Branham that's not
[58:10] going to get you nowhere no belief is
[58:16] action acting upon the word you have
[58:19] heard belief is acting at least that's
[58:24] the kind that God accepts but this is my
[58:26] last scripture so you understand
[58:28] why we follow a message and a messenger
[58:32] the message is Jesus Christ the
[58:35] messenger is william branham you
[58:38] understand me it's like Moses Moses was
[58:42] the messenger
[58:43] Moses you understand me but the message
[58:46] was God who should I say sent me I am so
[58:53] I err was the spokesman Moses was just
[58:56] the veil of the spokesman so you let me
[59:00] read the scripture so you understand
[59:01] what I'm saying
[59:02] Exodus 19 and 9 says and the Lord said
[59:06] unto Moses lo I come unto thee in a
[59:08] thick cloud that the people may hear
[59:11] when I speak with thee and believe thee
[59:14] forever and Moses told the words of the
[59:18] P words of the people unto the Lord
[59:21] you understand me so you've got to
[59:24] understand that God there's another
[59:26] scripture I had and I must have erased
[59:28] it but God put Moses Moses was God's
[59:33] dead right but so when Moses died he
[59:38] tells Joshua Joshua remember all that
[59:45] Moses said because Moses knew that the
[59:49] ways in which he spoke was not his own
[59:51] the word he spoke came from the pillar
[59:54] of fire right and as you heard me say
[59:59] this morning not you some of you heard
[1:00:02] me say isn't it something how people
[1:00:05] could quote in the way they did and they
[1:00:10] approached the word Jesus himself it
[1:00:13] says Moses said you understand me so
[1:00:21] they trying to correct the word by what
[1:00:24] Moses said and that's what people are
[1:00:29] doing now they're cracking the word oh
[1:00:32] you say they don't do it yes they do
[1:00:35] the Prophet God made a mistake and said
[1:00:37] 700 and the Bible says 7
[1:00:41] and people are still saying some of them
[1:00:44] saying well he knew what he was saying
[1:00:45] it was 700 did y'all know that people do
[1:00:49] that
[1:00:50] how you gonna connect that when the
[1:00:54] problem of God comes back and said I
[1:00:55] didn't mean to say that oh I'm just
[1:00:59] telling you it's the same kind of spirit
[1:01:01] the same kind of thing amen and we know
[1:01:04] that the Prophet God's ported us back to
[1:01:06] this Bible Fuller's right back to the
[1:01:10] Bible John 5 closing on this scripture
[1:01:17] you know what I'm not trying to tell
[1:01:20] people you know not to say brother
[1:01:22] Branham or anything like that but like I
[1:01:24] told them even this morning different
[1:01:26] ones if you're not careful you'll find
[1:01:28] yourself worshiping him you will anytime
[1:01:32] you exhort something else or name or
[1:01:34] something above Jesus name that's
[1:01:37] worship no other name his name is
[1:01:40] exalted above every name and you'll
[1:01:44] never him brother branham preaching Paul
[1:01:47] said Paul said he preached what Paul
[1:01:49] said but he never called his name Harley
[1:01:53] ever why because he understood it when
[1:01:57] Paul II was Christ
[1:01:59] it was the anointed word but people
[1:02:03] don't realize there is a seducing spirit
[1:02:06] they don't understand an enticing spirit
[1:02:10] making you feel if you don't do it this
[1:02:12] way you're wrong that is wrong
[1:02:17] absolutely not of God John 546 to 47 for
[1:02:28] had ye believed Moses you would have
[1:02:30] believed me for he wrote of me but if ye
[1:02:36] believe not his writings how shall ye
[1:02:38] believe my words he tied it all in is
[1:02:45] that it's me all along Moses talked
[1:02:48] about me I'm me now
[1:02:50] and if you're not gonna believe me you
[1:02:52] didn't believe Moses
[1:02:56] it is what it is and I look at people I
[1:03:00] said what is wrong with folks don't
[1:03:03] y'all understand if you really had the
[1:03:05] Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost said that that
[1:03:08] this Holy Ghost would be a witness of
[1:03:09] Jesus but jesus said the Holy Ghost were
[1:03:13] witness of me nobody else and when they
[1:03:18] call old Paul and Paul me
[1:03:20] they worship Paul Paul says wait a
[1:03:22] minute he said yeah I know some of y'all
[1:03:24] would have given me your very eyes you
[1:03:28] worship me you you you you you allowed
[1:03:30] you came you saw me as Jesus Christ
[1:03:33] himself and Paul had to correct that
[1:03:35] spirit I said wait a minute
[1:03:36] I didn't die for nobody but now you want
[1:03:42] to baptize in my name
[1:03:44] see that was the new cheat that's in the
[1:03:47] New Testament people gave Paul that way
[1:03:50] and they did william branham the same
[1:03:52] way and they're still doing it and paul
[1:03:55] corrected it then and so therefore it
[1:03:58] needs correcting now it is what it is
[1:04:04] Paul said if you do that you make me an
[1:04:06] antichrist William Branham said if you
[1:04:08] do that you make him an antichrist see
[1:04:14] what people don't know their position
[1:04:15] they given Eloisa
[1:04:17] and then get me wrong I respect my
[1:04:19] prophet I love my prophet I thank God
[1:04:21] for him but only one that shed his blood
[1:04:27] for me with Jesus Christ and if I go any
[1:04:31] other way with that I become Antichrist
[1:04:34] y'all understand me he wasn't there he
[1:04:37] he you said what what do you mean only
[1:04:39] the Bible says none was worthy to loose
[1:04:41] the book loose the seals he's that right
[1:04:44] they said oh you're no brother brother
[1:04:45] laid his hand on me brother branham
[1:04:47] healed me and then brother Browne said I
[1:04:48] ain't never healed nobody that's what he
[1:04:52] said
[1:04:52] go read your message he said I'd never
[1:04:54] heal nobody is that right that's what
[1:04:58] jesus said jesus said I've never healed
[1:05:00] nobody that's what he said
[1:05:06] read your Bible Jesus said I know
[1:05:09] he'll nobody it was him whatever I saw
[1:05:16] the father dude that which I did here
[1:05:18] the - is that right brother Brando stood
[1:05:23] there on the stage and he saw that
[1:05:25] pillar fire moving he said that one over
[1:05:27] there sister so-and-so see it wasn't
[1:05:29] only him it was Jesus Christ doing that
[1:05:34] and what the man you and I never gave Oh
[1:05:39] Lord you know this is what make them
[1:05:42] work wrong because they said in Matthew
[1:05:44] says Lord have not we cast out devils
[1:05:47] what man you know can cast out a devil
[1:05:50] they taking God's credit they've taken
[1:05:54] his glory have not we cast out Devils in
[1:05:57] your name they're taking his glory he's
[1:06:05] here depart from me ye workers of
[1:06:08] iniquity you knew better you know you
[1:06:10] ain't got no power to cast out Devils
[1:06:13] let's stand it takes the Holy Spirit to
[1:06:17] do that hallelujah I know all y'all

[1:06:27] God for the word of God even it's kind

[1:06:41] pulled my shoes off I took the tie off I
