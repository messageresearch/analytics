John 1:1 the Bible says let's go there let's go there and then we'll come back I love the book of John John John was showed a lot of shown a lot of things that a lot of the other disciples didn't get because John was really close to the heart of God st. John 1:1 is that you know in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God right so I wanted to subject this message one God one book and one verse so that you can understand that everything is relative everything relates to each other because God created when God created everything it was good you know we understand what happened when it comes to Satan but everything happened because God spoke it you know in the beginning when we think about God we think about worship well even before there was worship God was what we call el him he was the self existing one and understand I said self existing one one okay because the Bible said God didn't say gods God created so we understand that this self existing one was the fountain of all intelligence all purity he was God now you and I can't understand that we must take him by faith because we only know a beginning and an ending but Elohim the self existing one means that he existed he had no beginning and he had no ending he's eternal and of course all of the finite minds can't comprehend what that is but I like to say when God the Bible says in the beginning God created the heavens and the earth that's why I said one verse universe one verse universe oh I like that because uni means one and verse means first by that one verse everything was created heaven and earth and that one verse unfolded itself into what we call books but with all of these books there's only one Bible and that one Bible came by one voice which was God's voice and so you and I must understand that everything is so well connected before the far we we we believe that heaven and earth was connected and whatever went on in heaven Adam saw and he knew one man described it he said the choir of heaven was so powerful and so well known by Adam it would wake him up with music in the morning now whether it be all true or not we understand that somehow heaven and earth was connected because sin is the thing that brought the breach brought a chasm brought a separation between God and man and all of these things were still in the plan of God because God who is the creator created all things we understand that when he speaks of creation you and I must understand that even in the way of we consider evil it was Lucifer who perverted the word and in in by perverting that word evil came into existence even in this world because you and I must understand by the grace of God that when this evil was brought forth he corrupted the creation of God just like it did in in Genesis God didn't create the earth boy but we understand something took place that made it void and God at that point had to separate light from the darkness just like he's doing now because the Bible declared that Jesus Christ is the Alpha and the Omega the beginning and the ending and if he separated darkness from light in the beginning he had to separate darkness from light at the end and we understand by God's grace that according to John that John declared Jesus Christ not as the work just as the word but he was he was the light of men he was the revelation of what a real man was to be had him when he fell he perverted it and since Adam we never saw a real man we just saw something that looked like one something that acted like one but the true man was to be in the very image and likeness of God and that fall brought men into the image of Adam not God so we understand by God's grace that like I said everything is connected so that you can understand what I'm saying I'm standing here today but a few minutes ago I was in the past if I stand here long enough I will become the future but I'm still standing here because time moves on and it's connected it is so connected that God could even ask job where were you when the sons of God shouted and sang for joy it is so connected Amen that Jesus could actually say a God could say to Jeremiah I knew you before you were form into your mother's womb I call do to be a prophet is that right it is so connected that God could see according to Isaiah nine and six a virgin or 69 a virgin shall conceive and bring forth the son and his name shall be called Emmanuel God with us hallelujah that means that these words that went out was just our herring or an announcement of something that had already been is that right because there's no new thing under the Sun you and I must understand that because we are in time doesn't mean that we're not somewhere else is that right it's true the Bible declare that I am now setting in heavenly places in Christ Jesus but I stand here preaching to you and as I preach to you now and now there I am preaching to you because as I am now I am there also is that right yes because Paul says listen when you see me I will be known even as I am known the resurrection it's not an action and I'm kind of jumping a little bit but the resurrection is not an action that make you different how can I say it like to resurrect something is to bring something back that once was not something different it has to be the same thing that went down to come back is that is that right when God resurrected Lazarus he didn't come forth as somebody else that was Lazarus now he came back in a brand new body but he still was as hallelujah is that right so I'm saying all of these things is this when God created Adam Adam was like a seed and every man a woman was in Adam because he was the original tree somebody help me here as they say amen you can count the seeds in an apple but you cannot count the apples that's in the seed is that right because we understand there's only those people who came from Adam and Eve is what we're now Express is expressing right now right think about it one man and one woman is the cause of billions time billions time billions of people on the face of the earth oh yeah you said well how come brother Brooks because you got to understand the serpent was wiped out but the mixture of him it's the thing that calls him to continue right so you said whoa what are you trying to tell me brother books I'm trying to get to something because we realized by God's grace that your names when God created everything before he even made it manifest in his mind he saw you he knew your name that which was spiritual is first Adam was spirit man first then God formed him from the dust of the earth hallelujah you said that can be it is true because even Jeremiah was spirit man first before God brought him here so are you in the mind of God he saw you spirit before he saw you flesh hello you don't believe it I'm saying like this then before Jesus was flesh he was spirit first he was the son of God and while you say son because elohim formed himself into what we call a word which is the logos right and that logos created everything is that right but see the logos was still God in a in a different form we call it amalfi he masked himself he clothed himself in light and he created he was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God well somebody help me here because you got to realize amen we were with God that part of us was with God we were in God with a very attributes of God otherwise you couldn't you you don't have eternal life only that which came from God is redeemable redeem means to bring back so you've got to find your position you got to come to identify yourself you and either with God or you were not with God and if you were with God that's what pours on us folks didn't you it's God was pulling on you is that pull on you yeah understanding so that you can understand and you've heard me say this before when it comes to the the animals in those day dumb animals but God had a pool on them and brought them into the ark right those animals didn't say didn't say okay it's gonna rain and I better get in the Ark no God pulled them into the ark because they were elected and chosen by God is that right I want you to understand this because no matter how beastly they may have been when they entered the door which was Jesus their nature was changed hallelujah somehow the lion nature was changed where he can lay down with the lamb somebody help me here see that's what entering into Jesus Christ does it changes your nature hallelujah because we have a beastly nature but when we get into Christ then nature changes hallelujah from the beastly nature to the nature of God because that's what we were stripped from when Adam and Eve sinned with the Beast God took away his nature and for that Oh from that time on men became beasts you say that's not true well let me put it this way this is why Cain slew Abel came was a murderer he had on the beastly nature is that right but he still was part of Eve but he was part of the serpent as well and now after the flood amen it looked like it was a clear course for God but here was that serpent mixed in to the human race because that's what people who understand the serpent was not a snake the serpent was a man looking creature that was able to highbreed like a donkey and a horse bring forth the mule that's why your flesh is so stubborn yeah you got that mule nature in your flesh so anyway let's move on by God's grace I know everybody think he just hits around the tree whenever you've seen a snake talk this man or this thing if you go back to the book of Revelation book of Revelation calls him the serpent that man see so what was happening then in Genesis was happening in Revelation hallelujah because revelation revealed that the serpent in the garden was a man look like a man talk like a man now here I'm saying but he was not in the image completely like Adam but close enough to bring forth children but all of this was in God's plan and what Satan did was mix the light with the darkness God separated it and then the serpent mixed it again and you and I must understand this mixture has gone on forever this is why we continually die is that right I don't care what they say your vitamins don't work when God get ready for you to die you're gonna die and that's what people don't understand amen vitamins may give you a little healthier life but there are many people who are healthy that comes down come up with cancer and everything else runners that die before they finish the race so it ain't about all of that even though those things profit little toe as the Bible says but we don't want just so we can profit little we want to live in the beginning God created the universe and you and I must understand anything like I said when Jesus said according to st. John 14 in my father's house are many mansions see I'm not done I'm going to prepare a place for you that where I am there you may be also understand that place is only given to the redeemed those who are in the mind of God before the foundation of the world let me put it this way you are not me being the man I've got the germ of life in me for man child the woman doesn't have it she she brings forth the egg I bring forth the blood cell hello and all of my children that has been now manifested were in me I didn't know I didn't know who they were I didn't even know their names God knew where every one of them hallelujah and God used me I'm just a borrowed vessel but they really belong to God see and God will use me to bring them into this dimension you understand me in order to get to heaven you must have come from heaven I'm gonna get to it in just a moment I want you to understand so you can understand as I said we are in a position and we've heard the prophet of God say this many times radio waves coming through the room you can't hear it can you hear colors are coming through the room can you see them pictures are coming through the room right now can you see them no but to show you and prove to you that is possible because you got a TV you got a television and that crystal is able to channel into that other dimension and bring it here today is today but in South Africa today was yesterday but there yesterday is my today and my today is somebody else tomorrow but it's still relative it still connected because we can get on the phone and I can call somebody right now who's now experiencing yesterday and I can take from today and go into yesterday by the food yes and then I could take yesterday for somebody old in the East or some other time and I can talk to them I can defy what we call time because of scientific discoveries it shows that eternity exists time is just something that God placed us in and we came here to be tried we came here to be tested we came here so that we can know good from evil and that's what people don't understand why God created evil so you can understand what evil is God didn't have to be taught he knew and believed you mean God intended for us to go on and be he said be fruitful and multiply it was Eve who made the choice Adam who made the choice to plunge us into what we call evil and this is why God says now they know good and evil so that you can understand and this is what I love about it it's a beautiful love story because you and I know that the God who created or allowed this perversion to come forth and then one day we'll do away completely with it hallelujah but without this evil we would have never appreciated heaven hallelujah like you heard me say you can't you said oh I love I love I love but when that person do something contrary to you that's when your love is tested that's when your love is tried hallelujah that's when you come to understand how much you love that person it was necessary the contrast was necessary to manifest right without the darkness you can't understand light it was necessary that darkness would be here so that you can see what light is ask a man who's born blind who's never seen is Allah in his life and one day his eyes are open I'll tell you what you talking about a rejoicing now is not only was he here but he now see what light is before then he couldn't see he could only in imagine in his mind what light was hallelujah so is it with the believer without the darkness you only imagine what light is but when light comes it's like opening up a blind man's eye you now see all of those things that you thought was harmful and it really wasn't when you can come to see that you are sons and daughters of God not just happen to be but born to be hallelujah like I was telling somebody the other day I said it I said understand the anointing we were up there in Pennsylvania nor not done nothing fell and I mean who the people were just worshiping the Lord worshiping the Lord and the Holy Spirit just moved me and says just calm it down some and let it saturate your soul and what the Lord was showing me is like a rain shower a rain shower it rains but that rain didn't come just wet your flesh it came to saturate the seed is that all right there's a boy I used to walk in this in the rain and I oh I love rain and still do but I walk in the rain and everything else and like you've heard me say it was it was even rain was really nice to fall on you it felt good you know showers and all that but you know as a child you know I used to say I didn't want the rain to just follow my head I want to see how teeth hello somebody better not try that now they're just it's just too bad it's got too many chemicals now you come up with a sore throat or something but you know the truth of the matter is it did something in other words the rain didn't come to change you what you are already ah it came to manifest what you are the Spirit of God comes to manifest who and what you are is that right have the rain ever change the orange tree into an apple one well I have the rain ever changed our pear tree into a watermelon vine or plant or whatever no it only manifested the life that was in the seed this is what the message come that ladder and farmer rain comes to teach you who you are and comes to anoint what you've been taught to bring forth the life and character of Christ hallelujah if you're born to W is just the devil people say ho say it like that you know people can't handle that but the Bible said Judas was the son of perdition meaning he was born a devil how do you know whether you be devil or not I said like this the Bible says my sheep hear my voice and a strain that they will not follow if you can hear the voice of God speaking to you it proves you not of this world but of another world hallelujah you ever thought about it how did when God called Peter James and John they quit their jobs they just went and followed why they were sheep they were no is that right oh come on somebody because Jesus even told his disciples I knew you before the foundation of the world I called you you know it's like we always thought God says well this one looked like he could follow me that one no watch the scripture God went in certain areas and certain directions and caused certain people you think they were only one standing there I'm waiting on Jesus no they were most a lot of people even Matthew the tax collector at that time was still beating people out of money and Jesus said follow me and his disciples got upset because he called Matthew they knew what kind of crook he was but you see on the inside of Matthew was a seed of God you and I we come as well looking like a kookaburra but inside it's what God is interested in that's why we can't just even as sinners we could not just fit in we couldn't just go with the flow we always felt guilty we'd always felt condemned when we did evil didn't know why we felt odd Amen different from everybody else because you are different from everybody else God is trying to give you your identity on who you are by the word oh lord help me Jesus you see even Ibaka says listen when the vision is very plain upon these tables that you may run that readeth did you know one time books were Bibles like Moses on tables of stone and all that then from there it was on the animal skin you know how the process went and the Bible says even your heart once was a table of stone but now God has transformed your heart into a heart of flesh and God has written his word where within the heart this is why the Holy Ghost is important if you can't even read and you get the Holy Ghost you're gonna know right from wrong because it's Christ the Spirit in you that's teaching you and the Bible said he would teach you and lead you into all truth is this okay you must understand Amen that this this is not some rolling of the dice what I hope somebody believe my story I hope somebody understand that I suffered for them no God knew you understand me we were in the pawnshop Satan put us in the pawnshop well let's put it this way he put us in the pest house you know the pest house is disease flesh a place where disease flesh is taken remember when smallpox and all these diseases in that they put quarantine on the door so you wouldn't contaminate some and that's what we are without Christ we're living in a pest house we're living in a body that's contaminated and you and I must understand what God did for us you and I must understand that he came looking for his own yard and heard the ego story it doesn't matter the Eagle lost his is eggs and sometimes the eggs are in the chicken coop or whatever but the egg is the thing that makes the difference and a chicken can make a Eagles eggs hatch a dog can do it if you put that egg and it keeps the right temperature you can do it and you and I must understand it didn't matter no matter what denomination you were hatched in if you are an eagle you are eagle in the beginning you just don't transform into a eagle is what you are from the beginning and what Satan has done he's disfigured us he's literally in our flash makers thing we're so evil was so unworthy to be saved and God has already saved you from the foundation of the world and now this day in this time you recognizing what Kaveri was all about it was redemption paying a price for what Adam and Eve did it was blood in the Genesis and the dead for blood had to be shed shed to redeem us no man was worthy I don't care how old Moses wasn't Joshua wasn't none of those great men's nor nobody was worthy could nobody could redeem us it took a god body hallelujah it took a man who was created by God himself and I know what people say Oh Mary was the mother of Jesus he never called her mother he called her woman she was the first incubator because if you read the scripture when she saw Jesus had left and couldn't find him she ran up to and says Jesus your father and I we lookin for you and Jesus says my father I'm about my father's business in other words he was denying her claim to be mother and Joseph II father his birth was supernatural read the scripture his blood was created by God his body was created by God otherwise he would have come in as a sinner hallelujah but he was not therefore when he was born his theophany was there see your theophany have we bypassed it because of the sin the word body which is God's body that he created without hand you don't know that I know you know that Paul said I look for city whose builder and maker is God and understand you so a city you're the city jesus said you are city that sets on a hill that cannot be here and the Bible said know ye not that you are the temple of God you are the temple that right come out says oh don't look for God up in heaven don't look for God over here there said God is not the even in your mouth oh no no when you receive the Holy Ghost you become a true son and daughter of God that's why Jesus says Abba Father which means our Father who art in heaven Philip said Lord show us the father and it suffices us and Jesus said unto Him have I been so long time with you and yet has thou not known me Philip says show me the father and she said have I not been with you so long you have not known me that seeing me have seen the father what was it the Bible said the fullness of the Godhead bodily dwelt in him that was God in human flesh God came down is that right that's what that's what I just said his name shall be called Emmanuel and Emmanuel means God with us here was Emmanuel God in a human body what was it he did the same thing that he did in Genesis with the first Adam it was God and Adam feeling and touching and communicating with the natural he Lord Himself hmm you said well you tell Matt listen the Bible said Adam was made in the image and likeness of God and he at that point in time he's not talking about the flesh he's talking about spirit the very image of Adam was the very God you said what do you talking about he he was he said what are you saying brother Brooks listen the Bible said that Jesus called us his brethren brethren that means we born of the same substance whoever his mother and father is is our mama and daddy-doo someone to heal me that's the word and you said what brothers what are you trying to tell me I'm trying to tell you just like I said the other day not here this thing has been so fixed and people don't like it but I can't help my daddy is God I'm gonna own up to that whether I look like it or not you know that people say well you know you look just like your daddy I can't see I can look in the mirror can't see it but they can see it better than me oh I can't and sometimes I look in the mirror and I can see a little bit of resemble it's not what God when God listen the Bible said they call them first Christians at Antioch not because of what they wore but because of their deeds because of their action because of their character was reflecting Jesus they act like him they talk like him they walk like him and the miracles followed them just like Jesus see being a Christian is not wearing anything on your shirt but it's okay to wear it we wear a thing else leave our jeans and you don't take the Levi's off of it you know it just whatever you wear the point is their name brands and we allow those name brands to remain whether it be shoes shirts or anything to our and I got off on something but my point is there is no scripture against it the point is that God comes to a place that he wants to be tangible that was the whole point because Adam before he was formed in the earth he was actually as in this dr. - II and he led the animals then but God wanted him to commune in a way that the animals can actually see him and feel him and God formed him out of the dust of the earth hello the whole purpose about God is becoming tangible the Bible said no man have seen God at any time also true but you and I must understand by God's grace that in the beginning God wanted to do something let me read a quote here then see God came down and the character of God was Christ he was the reflection he was God made visible notice God made visible in the beginning was God he wasn't even God then no God is an object of worship only thing he was was eternal and in him was attributes and those attributes were thoughts and those thoughts were expressed to words and words were made manifest for an example before you commit adultery you've already thought about it and those thoughts become worse and those words become action that's what happens but at first it was a thought did y'all know your thoughts ring louder in heaven and earth God hears every thought right now it rings louder so it shows it meant that this dimension is confined because you can't hear my thoughts unless God give me discernment and then it's not me as God you understand me but in heaven God hears your thoughts that right don't be alarmed Lucifer thought he was hiding it - and God said I have heard your thoughts and in your thoughts you have said see hadn't even come out of his mouth yet and God had already discerned it what is it it's all God becoming tangible and you are part of God and Jesus come to redeem those that was put on where the Lamb's Book of Life before the founders in the world it was God's thoughts and that's what he come to redeem and them as long as it strikes to them they see it because the life is in there but if life isn't in there then what can they do see they don't see it they'll never see it and the whole thing is Jesus said at that day you'll know that I'm in the father and the father's in me I am in you and you and me see what I'm saying it began to become true as a knowledge increase we understand who we are what we should have been and so we press amen to go into what we ought to be that city that God is preparing is not for sinners it's not for anything but those who were redeemable oh I'm enjoying Jesus and you and I must understand that we when it comes to God you and I must understand in that that God is not counting his sheep he knows the number already and he said I'll never lose one never lose one how can it be what Jesus says I'm the Alpha and the Omega the beginning and the ending saith the Lord which is which was and which is to come the Almighty and if he is the Almighty and there be another God that means he got no he has no might cuz Jesus got it all and you must understand that there oh yeah you got to understand this is why we must understand character we must understand the divine nature of God the divine nature of God is not something that we have an option it must be and it ain't something you can produce on your own that divine nature can only be produced if the seed of God is in you and if that seat is quickened it will bring forth like apples and oranges of his kind is that Alright you sure what do you mean brother Brooks there was a story told about a man who was walking down this country road or walking down this road and got hit by a car and when he got hit by the car his body went up in the air and landed five years or more after that somebody else was going the same way and he hit this man with the same description of the man that had gotten hit five years ago and was dead and not only that there were witnesses look it up you can look it up there was witnesses who actually saw this man fly in the air and land and when they went out to see them they find a man in front of God he wasn't there what was it it was a dimension that you and I need to recognize is there hallelujah there are two worlds you either from beneath or you from above is that right that was a lesson it meant that Jesus taught his disciples he said amen you can't understand me because you're not from above and I'm from above my sheep hear my voice and a stranger they will not follow don't shut down on God you and I must understand that this is not something hard to understand it's simple that's why you know we understand that we must be born again this old flesh and blood will not get into the heavens it cannot it will not enter into heaven oh it's absolutely the truth and it doesn't matter because the point is when God says something he means exactly what he says you saw our brother what are you saying I want you to understand that the theophany is a different body it's a word body it doesn't breathe because he's eternal breath was only given to this dimension and when the breath is given up you're gone hello but God don't have to breathe he is God he created the breath hallelujah and you and I must understand that the Optio there doesn't eat nor sleep but this body needs to eat and sleep this body doesn't grow old over there he said it doesn't exist it does the Bible tells me that when Jesus was on Mount Transfiguration Moses and Elijah appeared it wasn't a vision it was opening up the portal that you can see that these men were living in a different dimension yet they were standing on the mountain hallelujah it's just like the property God he says now I'm looking to another dimension I can see you but he was standing in this one and looking in the other ones this is what the Word of God does it opens up portal opens up the vision it begins to make us see who we are where we had it where we came from and it takes away Oh fear hallelujah it's not taste not touch not handle not that has nothing to do with it because you and I have been chosen by God and we have an unconditional covenant God has come to redeem his own that's what it's all about it ain't don't do this don't do that is God coming to redeem you and pulling you through bringing you through I used to work poor but he don't pull but he brings you through he leads you through the portal he knows the way home hallelujah Christ in you see he is the Redeemer he comes what a redeemed to do what pick up that which was fallen to redeem back to the place where he was at the beginning that's why the Word of God has been given unto us that after God opened the seals it placed us back in that position what position before the fall of Adam but if you don't believe it you will never benefit from it faith comes by hearing hearing the Word of God and if you can believe that God has put you back there you can ask whatever you will is that right the authority in which God gave Adam before the fall has returned back to the bride of Jesus Christ but we got to have faith to believe it and to put it in action hallelujah that's why the blind eyes are open that's why the dead is raised that's why I can say is heal that's why you name it why those things those gains of death is it comes from this dimension hallelujah that dimension that has fallen but healing comes from a different dimension healing comes from God is that right and the Bible said that God healed all of your diseases I will not solve all of them it comes from a different dimension the only light that can conquer darkness hello somebody let me move on he come to redeem not this cannon fodder that we see around professing to be Christians but that he came to redeem that's what's God's thinking at the beginning this other is just something that's mixed around to show the statue she in other words of God in the flower garden that plays a part but the statute is what you want to see the statue of Christ which God projected to the earth in the full of a man that statue you want to see that's the one the other is just make up pause you see this reflects his loving noble character God reflected in a man called Christ he was the only one that could do this this was no other character in heaven could do it see is that right John said no man was found worthy to open the book in the loose the seals thereof none I will use that scripture when the devil comes to me don't see you ain't enough of the hypocrisy you ain't doing this and you ain't doing that I said listen no man was worthy but the man that was worthy his name was Jesus Christ and he has redeemed me and guess what devil he lives in me that's why the Bob said who is gonna lay in the charge the gods he let it is God who justify it hallelujah that's right no man has ascended up into heaven but he that came down from heaven even the Son of Man which is in heaven never read the rest of the Bible here in John 3:12 in 15 says if I told you earthly things and you believe me not how shall ye believe me if I tell you of heavenly things huh how God gonna tell you how you gonna believe God if you can't believe that God can heal and deliver I'm telling you the earthly things God God can you know it's amazing because those prosperity people those one who preach prosperity they do a good job at it and those people have faith and it happens and yet we who are bride struggles why we need to key in the faith let God energize it let him quicken it let me say it like this just like I said the other day up in Pennsylvania this thing isn't it it never work without prayer you can say what you want to say you need prayer Oh what do you mean brother Bruce Jesus who was the son of God who was God had to pray he knew what he was coming into he knew what kaveri was all about he did oh well i'm the word and I'm going to Calvary no sir the Bible said he got in the Garden of Gethsemane and he prayed vehemently that means he heat with fire fire desperation and the Bible said he so prayed to the sweat of his was like drops of blood hallelujah he heeded lord please help me no sir it was in desperation Wow he knew as a man he had to submit to his father's will you say his father yes the Holy Spirit and so do you even though the Holy Ghost is in you you still must submit to his will that's the character that Christ has come to get it is to do what he says I always do the Father's will his whole ambition was to do the will of the word that's what made him the word whew I'm gonna read that again no man have ascended up into heaven hallelujah is that right no man has ascended up into heaven but he that came down from heaven even the Son of Man which is in heaven he said I'm already here I'm there I have a I have descended and I'm going back up there hallelujah hey man and if that be the truth we were in him so we had to be there before we came here and since we came here we go back hallelujah you said what do you mean you said I'm gonna tell you what do you think when God chose those 12 disciples he went back to heaven to prepare 12 Thrones they were already whoo God sent you down here and that's what sin gave you amnesia oh lord have mercy right remember that message and this is what remember remember what remember where you came from remember who you are remember the power and authority I've already given you where before the foundation of the world remember hallelujah you've heard about the story this man Amen who who was in the war and he was frickin shocked cuz Ebenezer you know sometimes shock treats you in a place where you forget your name forget who you are forget what you are whatever the case may be but he was traveling on a train because what had happened his company had already put out a bulletin and everything if you know with pictures or anything if you recognize this person data they have amnesia if you recognize this person we have him he want you know somebody pick him up well nobody would pick this particular man up but he was traveling on the train headed for whatever place they were taking him and the train stopped and when the train stopped he started he was looking out to win the life mmm that looks for me he didn't say that but that's it that was his action so he began to walk in the train man was getting ready to stop him but the man who was in who was in charge of him said no no no no let him go so they followed him the man got off the train and went down the path he went up this way and all of a sudden he's climbing the hill and his daddy was standing in the door his daddy sees him coming and run to him embrace him it says my son my son I knew you would return oh I love this baby cuz I see God hallelujah as I climb the hill one day he run to me and you say my son my son I knew you would return why because as he went along the way things became more familiar to him this is what the message does for you it began to make you remember who you are hallelujah and when the bride comes to know who she is she will become an invincible army wake up and remember that's one thing I love about Jesus when he did communion he says remember me I love remember me there's something about that remember me remember me mm-hmm is that right remember I told you in st. John 8:24 23 to 24 he said unto them ye are from beneath now he's talking to the Pharisees he's talking to the Sadducees he told me to do theydo great theologians of his day he said ye are from beneath what that means there's a world from beneath and even the world no even the world is now saying that there's another world underworld they call it it's a world it's politically ran by demons principalities and powers y'all think living here is bad you missed the rapture you die and go to hell you have never seen what you see in Hollywood all these murdering and butchering and dismembering you know we never had that in America until Hollywood start showing it and what did it do because what people don't understand is the television it's a portal it's an avenue that demons go in and out and they come and they're not you why are you looking and you don't have no idea what's happening until you do what you saw them do in Hollywood most of the people like they crazy it means that doing all these crazy thing is because of what they've seen oh come on somebody's the truth it's a portal you think you're gonna be spiritual and God's gonna take you in a rapture and you being amused by Devils hey we all have to overcome we all gotta overcome but God will make sure you do yeah from beneath I am from above ye all of this world and I am not of this world so Jesus there's another world I'm from a different one I said therefore to you that ye shall die in your sins for if you believe not that I am he yo shisha diners eat talking to the religious people of his day denominational in organizations who thought they had Jesus they had it all under control and here was God wrapped in fresh walking as a peasant and they missed him cuz God doesn't come with his greatness and that's the dust that's that's the mentality of the people today when they see the mega church and they see all these great things Oh God got to be in there God hides himself in simplicity he could have been born in a castle yet he was born in a manger he could have went to the finest city that was yet he decided to become a Nazarite and live in nazareth and if he know any history about nazareth nasa was one of the wickedest cities ever even so the disciples when they said that he's a Nazarite he came from never they say can that's how bad it was is there any good there murderers and thieves and all mongers and all of that was in that city and here was Jesus but you got to understand great is the menorah the better the fruit that's why God put us in this age the manure the trash what we have to come up through hello I know that sounds really bad but that's the way it is one more thing i'ma let you go because of the time and he's available for any sincere person who asked st. John 7 7 through 11 said ask and it shall be given you seek and ye shall find knock and it shall be opened for everyone that ask is ask if that means continuous receiveth and he that seeketh findeth and to him that knocketh it shall be opened that means that don't mean that means continue to knock that means continue to ask that means continue to seek is that right what man is there of you whom if his son ask bread would give him a stone or if we ask a fish would give him a serpent now watch what he says what man is there of you whom if his son the key word is son because he says listen my son I will open they gonna ask they're gonna seek they're gonna knock and my son I'm gonna give them Living bread he said then if then being evil know how to give good gifts unto his children how much more shall your father which is in heaven give you good things to them that ask him Jesus in 18th chapter of st. John's answered my kingdom is not of this world if my kingdom were of this world then would my servants fight that I should not be delivered to the Jews but now is my kingdom not from hence Pilate was asking him are you a king Pilate therefore said unto Him art thou a king then jesus answered thou sayeth that I am a king and to this end was I born and for this cause I came into the world that I should bear witness unto the truth listen and everyone that is of the truth heareth my voice right one moment please st. Luke 20 out this is not the end but I just have to stop here st. Luke 20 34 to 38 and jesus answered and said to them the children of this world marry and are giving in marriage but they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world and the resurrection from the dead neither marry nor given in marriage neither can they die any more so what you saying he said now I want you to understand we marry here but we our kingdom is not of this world when we get to heaven your wife will not be your wife she'll be your sister your brother your daddy will be your brother there is no marriage marriage and and having sexual activity was only in this dimension it was to reproduce here it was by the fall that we produced by sex but in the beginning it was supposed to be the spoken word this is why when God redeemed men and Jesus Christ came and he sent the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is Christ in you and as your preaching and a person believes that spoken word quickens the seed and now he becomes a newborn child of God by the preaching of the word spoken word right because remember over there everything will be by word spoken word is the original seed hallelujah that's what we need to learn that we have the ability to speak now but you know what it can't be spoken by by hands of unbelief in doubt if you say to this mountain be thou moon and believe in your heart and doubt not that mountain must mean that's the way Jesus taught his children but they which shall be accounted worthy obtained that world and the resurrection from the dead neither marry nor given in marriage neither can they die anymore for they are equal unto the angels and are the children of God being the children of the Resurrection equal to what angels the messengers ello equal why we all had to come through Calvary they did been born again they just got different positions right you got a position they got a position but we all had to be born again we all died except Christ's coming our lives right because a true saint of God doesn't die he goes to sleep because we know that when we die we got someone to carry us over we don't go down we go up neither can they die anymore but they are equal into the angels and are the children of God being the children are what the resurrection that means to bring back up that which we're down now that the dead are raised even Moses showed at that Bush when he called the Lord the God of Abraham the god of Isaac and the God of Jacob for he is not a god of the dead but of the living for all live unto Him now I just tried to give a foundation of this message one God that's right one God one book in one verse and my sub topic was universe showing that we are all connected you know the world even know what like that they call it the circle of life whatever but the whole point is we're connected in order for us to live we must eat something that's dead whether it be plant or animal life it shows that the death burial resurrection in order to live something must die over there won't be like that there'll be no more death there'll be no more sorrow there be no more pain we'll go back to where we were wherever we were is that right remember when Jesus died the only thing he asked father I would that they be with me that's all he asked for he cares about the ones he redeemed because we are considered his bride we're the ones in the city universe and you know the Bible says summer break for 30 some 60 and 100 wherever your lot is is what you're going to bring forth no matter how you try it is God who do work it not him that work is God who work it and you and I must understand that God has a plan and he has everything in place I don't care what it looks like nothing is out of cater I'm closing on this so that you understand we're traveling with Pilgrims and strangers and you've heard me say this before if they're being a alien you the ones because you came from somewhere and you're going somewhere right and if I told you one day these lights gonna come down and pick you up that the world is calling flying saucers they don't have no idea what they are we know they are investigating angels they did it in large time and they doing it now now they seen things they ain't never seen before signs and wonders the Bobby said it would be so but what is it it's going home time that's what it is it's going home time you see well what about the world the world was the way the world is they didn't see it in Noah's day they don't see it today why because people have taken this word and they Dave hybrid they say oh god don't mean that you ain't got to do all of that that's too much see no no not for the bride of Jesus Christ not for the elected she want to do everything God wants her to do at whatever cost if you read this Bible they say you're gonna lose your mind I want to lose it I want his mind the Bible said let this mind be in you there was also Christ Jesus he said well what do you mean brother books I'm gonna tell you something when God that book is being scrolled it was one scroll folks that that unraveled not like this one scroll and I want you to understand that's the way God see it one verse created at all in the beginning God created the heavens in the earth it created everything and he spoke let there be and exploded we don't know how long it took for it to react but everything that comes out of the mouth of God can never come back void you love the Lord let's stand let's have a word of Prayer please father we come before you Lord we thank you for your grace we thank you for your mercy and your love father we just pray that you would be merciful to us forgive us of our sins and our trespasses I trust Lord that in this lesson father we tried to give it the way you are giving it to us and if we done or said anything that wasn't correct I pray Lord God that you reveal it and reveal it to the people so they may understand that none of these things happen by chance everything has been pre planned by the foreknowledge of God and we thank you right now for everything we go through Lord that's why your Bible said think it not strange when you fall into divers temptations knowing that the trying of your faith is more precious than gold right now Lord we're in that time period of divers temptations Satan is moving but you told us not to think it's strange because we realize that we're being tried every child of God must be tried it's all right to be tried Lord by you because you've already told us through the word that we're more than conquerors and in our patience possess ye all souls Lord we thank you for tonight we thank you for your word we pray father that you continue to bless us be merciful to us Lord our desire is to be a hunt for sin in your Perfect we Lord grant it now and your lovely name Jesus Christ we pray amen it's
