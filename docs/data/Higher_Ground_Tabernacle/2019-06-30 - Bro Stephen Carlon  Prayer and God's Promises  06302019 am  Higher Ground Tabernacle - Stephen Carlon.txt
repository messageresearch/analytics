my my six-year-old son when he was about three or four he says dad Jesus is born in my soul I say this morning Jesus is born in my soul and we're feeding our soul this morning on the Word of God by His Holy Spirit that's the only thing that this holy ghosts on the inside of us can be sung is that word of God amen amen praise God well I just send greetings from my home church from brother Don and ster Mary send greetings from my wife Bethany and the children they send their greetings and we just want to was wanna send greetings and good news from a far country over there and in the great land of Minnesota and I just want to send it the extreme apologies that it's taking this long for us to visit and just love you all so much and it just we're all one big family and we just want to be a blessing to you this morning and just want to see what the Lord would have us for us this morning I just so thankful for my wife she got up early this morning with me about 5 a.m. well 4:30 a.m. got me all packed up and gave me something to eat on the way and just really took care of me and we're expecting our third baby in a September and so I'm so thankful for my wife and her sacrifice I'm so thankful for every sister here this morning on their sacrifice especially those sisters that are our wives it's just I just thank God the Lord given that's why man how do you think you think Lord for the wives and sisters amen you know that they have a such a sacrifice there is just listening to a story back in the times of the civil war of there was this this lady her name was Clara Barton and she was enlist she lived in the in the south and and she she was just doing everything that she could for the Lord and and teaching and everything like that and how that it got to a point where she was doing so much in that she was getting shunned by men from being able to just try to do something try to do something to teach children or anything like that and how that we never want to we want to never want to limit what God has for that God provided place for sisters in our our midst that God it got us given them that place we never want to be afraid of the roles that they can't have and they were the roles that they they do have and um but this morning I just want to just speak on a little thought of the prayer and God's promises this morning you just been really strong in my heart and you know there's so many times when I have gotten up to preach where I have I have just you know hours and hours and hours of studying you know just finger licking good subjects of of things that are just so wonderful and and then I'll go down to pray and something that I've hardly ever ever really just taken time to dive in a long time perhaps and I say well okay Lord I'm obedient oh I know that the people are pulling on something that it needs to happen and so I just want a sons of god and daughters we got our led by his Spirit amen so we just want to to look to the Lord this morning I never want to rush ahead of the Lord I never want to come on my own thoughts because my words will pass away my words are sinking sand saints of God if you get stuck in my words you're going down but but with the Lord I mean we're going out pay man praise God amen so let's all stand if we could let's just turn to Matthew chapter five this is simple scripture so thankful for brother Brooks allow me to come just it what an honor to be able to be a part of any part if I could just come and even play a song I'd be happy because it's just about Jesus and just want to serve serve the Bride of Christ this morning amen aim and praise God hallelujah thank you Lord amen let's just start with a verse 1 and seeing the multitudes he went up into the mountain he was set any and he was set with his disciples on where they came unto him and he opened his mouth and taught them saying blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven blessed are they that mourn for they shall be comforted blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth blessed are they the hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain mercy blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the children of God blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness sake for theirs is the kingdom of heaven blessed are ye when men shall revile you and persecute you and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake rejoice exceeding glad for great is your reward in heaven for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you even let's just ask Lord's blessings from the reading of the word heavenly father we just come before you this morning Lord we can sit through a church service father feel a little bit better Lord and go back to the same life we had before church Lord I know none of us here want that Lord we don't want to just be a hacker's just a little bit and just to get by another week Lord we want your thoughts we want your ways which are higher than our thoughts and our ways Lord Lord lift us up Lord if we're not standing Lord lift us up and let us stand father Lord quicken your word to us Lord I can't convince anybody of anything father but your Holy Spirit we have conference at the confidence in this morning Lord would you just be with us father would you bless His Word father and use use these poor lips father to give your people Lord what they need father that's what I'm here this morning father I pray you bless the here and the receiver father made no thought take preeminence over the Word of God if there's an evil spirits in here trying to stop the service we rebuke you Satan you take your hands off of God's property in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ when you submit you from this building and from the mind of each heart here tonight this morning Lord we just thank you Father now in the name of Lord Jesus Christ for your glory we ask you and we pray for also for brother Brooks father over at the other church father bless him load this morning Lord I pray father that you the noisome father to meet the needs for their in Jesus Christ's name Amen amen you may be seated amen praise God I just hope this that this is uh that we can get to see y'all more often because I I just hate coming into to not know you I would I would rather not just get up behind the pulpit and and not know you I want to get to know you and you know this I say a sign of a Good Shepherd is the one that smells like the Sheep amen and and if I'm a standing Shepherd for a little bit and I never get to smell like sheep that's not a very good Shepherd either so I just want to to be a servant and be among you and to get to know you and fellowship with you as your my brothers and sisters and I love you this seems like an odd text for a topic on prayer and bless and promises but you notice how these all these things the poor and spirit those that mourn are the meek those who hunger and thirst after righteousness the merciful the pure in heart the peacemakers those that are persecuted for righteousness sake it these are attributes of the Holy Spirit is the attributes of a son or daughter of God and with that God in a like jesus said to the disciples that you'll be hated that because we it's because they hated him and he hid the profits so these are signs of the heart of God like it says over in him let's turn over to Isaiah 61 one of my favorite scriptures and you could tell it was it was paramount for Jesus because it was his first text that we see in Scripture when Luke chapter 4 we're 61 in verse 1 if you had ever say a man any man the Spirit of the Lord is upon me because the Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek he has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted to proclaim Liberty to the captives and the opening of the prison to them that are bound to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord and the day of the vengeance of our God what is what is he saying here I would like to to offer to you if you can just in your imagination think of a document for each one of us this morning if we could fill in the blanks and we had to write our name and we had to write what is anointing us as a manifesto for our life is that we could say the spirit of and there would be a blank there is upon me and has anointed to me to blank and as and to and on and on and on and on is that there's it that we are each here on this earth I remember just sitting as a 13 year old young man it just waiting for my mom at the gas station he's in the car and I just heard a voice say just in my a my head say what are you doing here and it was you know how thoughts come and go but this thought it was different it was this question what am I doing here I said what am I doing here I said well the only thing I know I can be doing here is to to to get to heaven and to love Jesus and to spread the the joy of of what Jesus has done for me to others and then I hear that question what are you doing about it and it was just oh Lord that's it saints of God that's why we come to church every day or every Sunday every Wednesday what we come to prayer meeting is because we're asking ourselves the question what am I doing here and what am i doing about it because we can just come to church and we can hear wonderful doctrine and we can hear wonderful revelation but just like scripture says that in first Corinthians tanana that we could have all all these gifts and revelations and everything that but have not love or nothing and love isn't a state of being it's a state of doing it's not a state of a perfection of completion of of now we now we understand no now we now we are doing now we're we're giving out were freely freely giving I was sitting on a roof nailing gutters to the hanging gutters to the roof and I'd mentioned this just a second ago but I just it was just like Lourdes in me is reaction to God calling us is Who am I and then then could you get to that place where we can say here am I because my pastor told me there's a gift in you to preach this is about 10 years ago I think it was going to be eight years ago and and I said Who am I Who am I and I just I feel like I'm going off topic but I just feel like the people the Lord is pulling through you so I just I just just phone leading of the Lord is that is that for two years I said Who am I and the Lord finally said Stephen freely received freely give each one of you this morning you've really received amen now to be able to freely give I remember I had a dream when I was young being a missionary and just just tell you a little bit about myself I was about maybe 12 or 13 years old and in the dream I had a I was in a like hotel or an apartment building and I knew I was going on a missions trip and I was I was shredded I didn't have a suitcase so I was gathering all my worldly possessions and my favourite Nike shoes and my my favorite shirts and everything at that and I was just trying to grab it too and try to hold on to all this stuff and some brothers came in said Stephen what are you doing we need to go we're gonna need to be late for our trip and I looked at that and I was in that moment of the world or God's calling and I just dropped everything and just took whatever I just needed to get by and went and you can see the the symbology there and then the next scene we got out on a plane and we're in the middle of this this is clearing in a rainforest and there was these natives coming out of rainforest and and I were each given a sword and I and the sword I had I could barely hold it in one hand and it was just this small handled sword and I said and the other brothers got a sword and they were using their swords and and I said Lord if I'm gonna fight for you I need to be able to hold this sword and I just was praying lord please give me a sword I can know I can grasp firmly and the sword grew out where I could hold it with both hands and it was just made right so I could really grip it and just to see how the Word of God is like that how that you know at first when we're young we're trying to grip the the Word of God and it's and yet we maybe don't even know how to fight with it you know but with the promises of God for that will defeat every one of our enemies each one of those things are the God that heel up the air by the ice your stripes I'm healed maybe we're just grasping it and where you just don't have a handle on it yet and what we could say just like the man said with the Sun that had the evil spirit that oh lord help my unbelief and then all of a sudden he could grasp at that firmer Amen that wonderful saints of God how that you know the it's the sort of spirit which is the word of God and now that we're learning to grasp that sword and it what how do we grasp it like brother BAM said it's faith that grips that word of God so that God creasing our faith it's that muscle gripping the Word of God to hold fast now they say you heard this the how that when you you grip a sword long enough in battle that even if you were to let go your hand would be God made your hand so that you could never let go that you after a battle is over a lot of times that they would have to pry their fingers with almost like a pliers type thing just to get their hands out of the sword because it would be there was so dead locked onto that sword because they had that death grip saying I'm I'm running for my life I'm standing firm on the Word of God and I'm holding on the sword with all my might and and of course being young in the faith and in this story on the next thing that happened in this dream I had as I was so excited for this the sword now I could grasp firmly I was just started waving it around and showing it off and and before you knew it I struck the tip on a rock and I broke the tip off and I even had anyone used it yet and I just oh I just dropped to my knees I said lord please forgive me you know cure the first thing I do is just abuse the sword you've given me by just being show a show off with it I said Lord would you please forgive me and about my head and opened my eyes and the tip had grown back on the sword and that how that we don't ever want to use this word of God for my ministry or or for you know God showed me this and I think you know wow what would a plagiarism thing to say oh you know well the using it for our own purpose and and to you know like the there was a I love photography how many love photography there was a man Ansel Adams he may remember how he used to take beautiful black-and-white photos back in the day when there was only black and white of just beautiful landscapes you know of just national parks and just oh he just captured everything and you know God had lit the sky he he done all the set design he they put the trees there the foilage the rocks the mountains the creatures everything he had put in the place everything and Ansel Adams would say he says I didn't do anything he says all I had all I did was just being the right place when God wanted someone to take a picture and that's us it's a god that's me and you is that we are in the we pray that the Lord will put us in that right place where when God wants to do something that we're right there to say yes amen how many wants to say yes this morning amen because it's this it's this time that we have even me here this morning there's a reason for it and I know it's not me but it's just that Lord is here this morning for each one of us that he can do something and it's just like we we know brother Branham I know the pillar of fire appeared over his head and what'd he say he says I'm nothing I just happened to be standing there when the pillar fire wanted to take its picture amen so again you he wasn't saying no look at me look at what God did for me no it was I just happened to be standing there when God wanted his picture taken and so that it's it's about him being lifted up like Jesus said I am meek and lowly and how brother branham always talked about God's and simplicity all that God uses simplicity and faith and it was it I'm sorry simplicity faith and humility I believe you said to work as works and that it's not something this big organization in this big pomp that we know that God is working and that the promises that he has in his word coming in effect in our lives that it's just you can only come down like the sermon the lamb and the dove we're we're we're than that place to have a nature to let just like the Lamb of God in the Jordan River when John was baptizing him how he was that lamb and that dove could have send upon him and he wasn't this wolfish nature that was snarling and biting it was this Lamb of God and that the the the nature of the Holy Spirit from the father could come down send upon him amen amen how many wants all the promises of God have you ever stopped to think you know at the end of our life when we get on the other side since of God you know there's so many promises in this Bible how many will we use on this earth how many how many scriptures will we know by heart because they're just so sweet sweeter than honey how much will we capitalize on this how much opportunity will we actually take it's there how much will we take amen this someone had said that there's over I think was over five five thousand four hundred sixty-seven promises in God's Word five thousand four hundred and sixty-seven promises in God's Word how many will we cash in on maybe 300 400 who would want to cash in maybe just on a thousand Wow thousand promises in God's Word what about maybe 2,000 maybe that we just enough to get us through life how about all of them amen and you know how they even you think about that and you think about how that even through through through different through different men through the ages that God used to promise to point to those promises and even to think about how when the Lord gave brother Branham his commission when he had he'd he'd just had to get a whole loan with the Lord and the Lord met him and he said if you can be sincere and get the people to believe nothing will stand and you're in the way of your prayer not even cancer and they just it just struck me Saints one time I listened to a sermon and I was thinking about my healing and I was thinking about this Lord remind me Steven that's a promise today that when you listen to a tape and you hear brother Brandon praying and it's not brother branham but it's it says nothing can stand in the way of your prayer so when we're sincere I believe this all my heart since God went on sincere when you're sincere and you're listening those tapes and he said brother Branham is praying for you and that prayer or praying for praying nothing can stand in the way of that prayer not even cancer because and it's not the sovereignty of brother Branham or the power of brother Branham or anything No it's the Lord giving brother branham a promise and just like look at look at Elijah when he was even buried when he was everybody was in in the ground not even buried he was just in the pits and they threw a dead body in there how that even that dead body came back to life because that there was something and that wasn't Elijah it was the anointing that God had given Eliezer Elijah because God does nothing left that seals up through his servants the prophets so it's not lifting up any man but it's lifting up Christ that that same spirit that raised Christ from the dead dwells in you there's a promise it'll do what they look quicken our mortal bodies amen do that spirit dwelling in you you know in this there's things that each one of us how many of us a burden on their heart just things that you've been praying about for years or maybe you don't understand something maybe there's something in the surface you don't understand yet and you've heard it preached over and over and over again those things that you're like it's for me I know it's for me and sometimes it's a season brother Joey right you know that God's just wanting us to persevere you know the trial of our face is more precious than gold right and yet sometimes there's there's ways we can go after something and get it sooner I believe and sometimes that I think I'm just gonna be a vulnerable here this morning and say that sometimes I'm tempted to rather than going in before his presence and staying in his presence I kind of just go out in the waiting room and I kind of just sit back and and just kind of just well I'm gonna swing on you Lord I'm just gonna sit back and maybe maybe I'll just kind of get on my phone a little bit and kind of just we're just all this wait until you have an answer for me oh wow that's neat ooh oh that's pretty neat oh that's a good information and now pretty soon I'm just addicted to information and pretty soon I'm now I'm looking up you know what does Google say about it oh you know what does this say about it and there's nothing wrong with with those things as if it's not an absolute but yet we're here to inquire the Lord not inquire of our iPhone or our Samsung or whatever amen is that that it's that's not the absolute as I'm sure brother Brooks has preached that we that so many times it's the counsel of the ungodly saints of God amen that's it's so many times this is just all that internet is just the counsel of the ungodly so many times and we end for us student to not just be in the waiting room with the world waiting to hear from God and to get complacent and just oh why wouldn't he do something but just to to to push forward when we don't know what to do to see that God has for us I love brother Branham preaches in 1953 seeking after Jesus he says now let every one of you your homes be a prayer room just start praying everywhere and how prayer is so important and to make our prayers known to God we must be confident for his promises to be for us that to expect that his promise is there for us that when a man that brother Brown preaches also in the Jehovah Jireh 457 he says when a man is born again of the Spirit of God every divine blessing in this Bible belongs to you I'm gonna read that again when a man is born of born again of the Spirit of God every divine blessing in this Bible belongs to you amen is that for you are you that man are you that woman amen it belongs to you amen let him know that Amen that you're looking for that you're when you raise your hand in faith he's saying oh they believe it I'm rose listening to I just been been witnessing to my my my wife's cousins we'd gone down to a little town in Minnesota Lanesboro and we'd gone biking together and and we're sitting around the campfire cuz they're they're really Unitarianism a lot of that and Lutheran background where they just read prayers out of a book and they just pretty of just can sermons and and everything or just they just believe they believe nothing pretty much for me even going to their church is that just very just not no strong beliefs and we were just sitting around the fire and I was just pouring out to them you know and they said you know I believe I could do good things you know I mean you know we have our faith and you have your faith and I just do get things I'll just I know God God will look at that and say it's okay you know you could just see and so I was just pouring into them just you know the way of the Lord and God's provided way and just pouring out and how many times you got a chance to do be a witness and the first thing after that you just get hungry for more and you just want to feel yourself back up and that's I'd be careful I'm grabbing trailing off a little bit here but be careful because right when you pour out and that freely give now that's when Satan can come and say you're thirsty I'm gonna get in and then the end oh wow brother rich you've done such a good job you know to be a witness you know you can just sit back a while on the set that just just take take your leisure and you know why don't you just just read just read a fiction a fictional book and why don't you just when all of a sudden you're you're needing that verse you again you're needing that life from the throne of God and so many times that that that seniors try to come in for me and when I've just poured myself out and spend that Oh take your rest you know Steven yo you know look at how spiritual you are and you just pour yourself out to others you know just just pat pat Steven on the back and just just just take care of him for for a while but it's taking air of the flesh and not the spirit taking care of the fleshly man of the world and how that we by God's grace can do I've read back into that word and I was on the way home from Lanesboro and everybody was sleeping in the car now I turn on if that sermon on power of decision preached in 1955 there's that as a good series if you ever haven't listened to it brother Brett preached in 1955 I think I think it was 12 times in Chicago because when you when you listen to near the end of those those series you say wow people are just charged up they're just they're just on fire and and yet when it's because he'd already been there seven eight nine times and he pushes on the power of Satan the power of God and the power of decision and you know just talking about how that we know when we when we respond to the Lord and faith how that God sees that I was it was the end the service and the Lord was using brother Branham said there was healings in the service and people were getting healed left and right and and he says oh you know sister your he loved diabetes and the name of Lord Jesus Christ and he says oh isn't that wonderful let's say praise the Lord Nicolle congregation says praise Lord I'm and I'm in the car I'm saying praise the Lord I'm filling back up and he says you know the angel Lord standing right by the woman and I just get chills all over my body and I just see oh praise God he says you there up in the balcony what do you think of all this and I said I believe it with all my heart and he says you believe it with all of your heart and I just about had I had a had a conniption I said Oh glory to god this is so good is that there's for each one of us even for you young people you may say oh you know that's for brother Steven or that's for adults or is that there's so much that it's just happy and delightful in the Lord Amen don't you believe it Saints I mean you've seen it in your life and that choosing life choosing the Lord if there's something that happens it's so wonderful but it takes our expectations and that takes us running to the throne amen amen but reaching out for the things of God how do we reach out for more of his promises did you know that that brother Bram said prayer is the stepladder to reach the unreachable he says when well when I buy a house why it's just like if this place belonged to me and it was a big arcade and I come in here and I want to find out what I got I go around pull out this drawer and look in it and see what I got here go over here and see what I got in here if anything seems a little bit too high I get me a stepladder I go up to it find out what it's all about amen and when I get God say brother I took this old treasure book of God and looked through it and see what I possessed amen took out this treasure book I find out that every blessing that's in it belongs to me and it belongs to every believer si yes sir if some and they'll listen to this if some of them seems to be a little out of my reach I'll pray till I get to it if something seems to be a little about all my reach I'll pray till I get to it amen every promise in the book is yours he-man Saints this crew this great arcade of gods a commonly belongs to every believer and by one spirit were all baptized in this big arcade and everything in there belongs to us and we're heir of all things and every promise of God amen and then add adoption he lights to it again he says oh but it's so good to look at yes but just like brother Neville said about the arcade yesterday get you a step letter and go around and see what you got yes sir that's what this is like God's Holy Spirit is our stepladder to tell us what we got God's Holy Spirit as our stepladder to tell us what we got see so we have the Holy Spirit and we have prayer because we know how many a parade and just felt like there's nothing just you just praying and just and it's just your praying and like brother Billy you know Billy Graham says you pray till you feel like bring it and that did you know saints of God that you know the scripture says I believe it's in its in Colossians chapter 2 it says you know God has given us the power to will and to do of his good pleasure it's not our power it's not our will that's died will be done so it has to be his will coming in through us so if you're if you're challenged by this and say I want that I want to reach and take God's stepladder of the Holy Spirit but I have the Holy Spirit God can give that to you because remember it's when you when you make a decision for Christ to ask him in your heart that his Holy Spirit hasn't come in yet and how that you have your own renewed will but you don't have God's will there's power of his will in you and how that we have that and now we run with all of our might brother Keith and we say I'm gonna do this for God because I'm saved and I'm gonna do everything I can for the kingdom and then we fall on our face why because God us to teach us can't be any of us amen has to be all of him and that it can't be just our renewed will um there's a wonderful book brother y'all know brother blot a from from the cities um he told me about this book um by a ministry from the end of the 1800s blander Murray and he has this little book called absolute surrender and he talks about that how the man has his own renewed will right when he gets saved and he said further Andrew said he had someone come up to him and say this young man he says I know it was God's willing me and he says well did you fail he says yeah but he says it was not God's willing you for God never fails Amen so we know we each have to get to what is it impossible for man amen Oh wretched man though that we are is possible with God praise be to God for the man who learns both lessons amen that it is possible for God that we can move on we can go on in him we're heirs to the promise Amen praise God this is from this sermon on Jehovah Jireh and he says every bit of it belongs to you it's yours I've give it to you it's yours well Abraham was going to fall heir to all of it so he said get up and walk around through the land and see what you own praise God I think God calls his children of Abraham to do that amen for us to get up and walk around to take to to go through their scriptures uh how many times have you taken a scripture verse and you like even brother Brown says you know lay that need right in your Bible you know put it right next to it you lay it before the Lord speak it that's right brother Keith how that we we I think so many times that Satan wants to make the promises of God so ambiguous well Lord you promised in your word in Jesus name Amen and and is this kind of this hope kind of I don't know if I have it but when we can say I remember we had a bill come up my son Levi needed like this retainer for his teeth - straight in his teeth and to test the morning the making but the Lord has already answered the first part and Bethany was at the dentist's office and she goes it's gonna be thousands of thousands of dollars for this and there's there's they have the retainer and they were about to give it to me should I just finance it I said oh honey I think let's just pray about that why don't we just pray about that see if the Lord provides we don't have the money but let's just pray about that and I said and so we went home and we just took that bill of how much it was gonna be and we just put it right in the Bible in Acts chapter 19 and or no we're know in where it says I will provide all your needs I will supply all your needs according in monterrey riches and glory we just put it right in there and we all put our hands on the Bible and we and sometimes we need to do the things Saints for our brain and our mind and and for our of course faith comes by hearing and hearing by the Word of God so to put attention on that and we prayed over it I just felt so inspired to do that and within a week I tune pianos as well as play and I had seen on Craigslist a piano for four very very low cost and it was a grand piano a Yamaha grand piano some to half it gaan piano and I said why is it being listed for so low and it was a tenth of the cost of a brand-new and I said this this looks like something that we should look at so I called up a gentleman I've been apprentice in under for 30 years about 40 years actually now and I said Tim I'm wanting to know if this piano was any good he's like oh that Yamaha 7 a half-foot c7 conservatory piano he says I know I saw that on there he says I've been calling everybody up I know say you need to buy this piano he says I tuned for our church and I said you need to pay me to go down there and get this piano for you for your church and nobody wanted it and I said well praise God I went down there and was it was from a Pentecostal Church and they were getting rid of it and getting a keyboard and said and so right now I mean I'm in the middle of just I'm just giving it an overhaul to sell it and God made a way a provision for me to pay for that bill through that I'm just so thankful saints of God that it's a when we're looking when we're expecting we're looking for for the promise of God's you know to me like I grew up in the message and so especially for you youth you hear the things same things over and over and over again and it feels like a cliche like only believe only believe and if we see anything from Hollywood to only believe means Steven oh oh no I dropped it oh I didn't believe but that's not it it's we say like where the brand says faith is when God drops it down in your heart and says it's just so and no one can take that away from you it's a gift of God we don't work ourselves into it and that really helped me for you young people if you're trying to understand faith that faith is when God drops it down in your heart and just says it's just so and even if you if you don't have it yet you go into prayer knees and say lord I need this and I don't have the faith for it and don't don't kid yourself or don't be on it be honest with the Lord you see I don't know I don't have the faith for them if you don't have to feel like you had the faith let's say when I'll have a face for this but give me the faith drop it down in my heart that it's just so unknown no intellectual can take it our way for me that it's just so that I can grip this promise but it comes by prayer it comes by by laying in that promise until you get it and taking that step ladder of prayer and then also of the Holy Spirit having by His Holy Spirit how many have had that time where you're praying and you're praying and all of a sudden it is well all of a sudden there was just rest where you just had that rest I so remember at one time I got on my knees I was working when I was young young girl I know I'm still young but the and this lady one of my ladies at the caribou I worked at a caribou coffee she said will you pray for my son he's just going through some hard times right now will you pray for my son acid I will pray for your son Terry Terry and so I went home and I got on my knees and I just prayed and you would think oh well brother Stephen you prayed for hours and you labored and and you you just don't the word and you just stayed there all night and you sweat it and everything out and you cried and you prayed and and then in the morning and the dawn all of a sudden you got an answer and that's how it has to be every time and that's what I thought and I got on my knees and I was probably on my knees for maybe six or seven minutes maybe and all of a sudden it's gonna be alright I knew it and you know that sense of God when you have in you go it is well with my soul and the next time I saw her she says Stephen he's gotten through it he's all right praise God that he gives us those answers we pray sometimes we pray and it said let that labor of prayer and I believe it's almost led that Cup it's getting filled up with prayer and then the Lord weights so that cup is full and then also pours the all those prayers of those years in one moment and it's over amen so the us if we feel like we haven't heard from heaven know that we're filling that cup with prayers and that he's he's watching those he remembers the prayers of the saints amen so for us to keep enduring to the end and keep praying and believing and that for you young people you know what only believe looks like in a picture belief is a funnel over your head and belief is you haven't that funnel open and unbelief is closing that funnel and having to be a roof over your head and so that when God comes passing by and all of a sudden he wants to do something for you were praying and he comes down and if you have that roof on your head of doubt just pull this falls off over the edge and you're like oh I knew I wouldn't get it just comes down and it's trying to trying to come out it's just pouring down for you but just going right off the roof but when you have that funnel the funnel of belief and he comes gummys by when he pours down it just goes right in because you're open you're open only believe it's just you're open to what his promises are and that's what faith is it's not this Hollywood faith of if I just believe it concentrate and I don't break my concentration that's faith and I tense my body no ah there it is no it's just that openness just stay open to the Lord and close I put it put a roof on your head when it comes the devil you men don't let him rooster all right bread brother I'm said you know any time he comes around tries a poor young cuz you know it's God above God with and got in and Satan is trying to do that - he's trying to be be over us shadow over us and a shadow in us and through us so he's trying to do that - so don't let him come through put that roof over your head of the just just put it take that word of God and use it as a rough right and even when scene comes amen but then when when the Lord comes just praise God just grab everything you can amen like what like in the Psalms David said open wide your mouth and I will fill it and and how he says he daily loads us with benefits you know you only think about this how many you got to work like where you got a truck and you had to go to work and then you in you had to go to the receiving dock and get all your supplies and I'm right when I finally had a job where I had to do that I was like oh my goodness this is just like the scripture because I got my lunch I got he had my lunch for the day and I got its bait lunch and that's the open their mouth wine I will fill it so like also that I have I have something in my tell me for the day to build have energy to work and then he Oh he not only daily loads my truck with blessings fills me up for the equipment for the day all those promises he's just filling up filling up equipping quick of being that that vessel of our life to be able to go wrong and do what we need to do and get it done amen amen praise God amen is this all right praise God I just want to be a blessing to y'all and I just I just know that there's more promises that we have to take hold of amen I mean you think about its going beyond the status quo right the status quo my beat well you know I know sister and so and so she had a promise you know it's pretty good you know that was goes all right or oh they even had someone happens sometimes and if we just go off of that Saints our expectation is way down here right that simple faith to just believe I had this just I just want to tell you testimony Chris your faith a lady at work her name is Debbie I work for Costco we actually had a grand opening for the store that transferred to I'm in st. cloud yesterday but I was working in Maple Grove last year and this lady came up to me and she says we were just talking about different things and she says you know I have tears at night where I get I have tears and I said I grew up and and I would just I would see things in the room I would I would it was like my eyes were closed but I would see the whole room and I would see spiritual warfare and things over me and and everything and I would just get and sometimes I could feel things on me and a lot of times the Lord used it even though Satan minute for evil sometimes God would use it for good if I let something in if I let in a movie I shouldn't have been watching I snuck in a movie when I was living at home he would show me all the spirits that that would let in so it was it was good for me to for him to show me that but there was I said I had that same thing and I said mom taught me that that you know it's the power and the name of Jesus that kicks those Devils out so I would start using that and I come against the enemy in my dreams and it would work every time and it's amazing because I said so just rebuke the devil in the name of Jesus and I saw her two weeks later and I was just going on my break we we worked for five hours stocking in the store and then we go to lunch and I usually just run to the lunchroom and just sit down and I'm just ready to just take a nap because it's so hard work but I just felt like Steven go outside that's it okay I'll go outside so I'm walking out the door not thinking anything of it here walks in Debbie and she just comes in and she goes Oh Steven it worked I says what worked and she goes she says for 61 years I've had I've had spirits over my body I haven't been able to sleep on my back for 61 years because if I sleep on my back it's a vulnerable position and so that's when relief spirits will try to come and I'm making I'm trying to make this Sun scary sounding for our audience but she says I'd always have to in my sleep call out for my husband John John and it's the only way I would know because I can't wake up I'm so paralyzed and I were just called John John and you would know to shake me and wake me up for 60 about 61 62 years and she says I'd been calling the wrong name this whole time praise God aren't you glad for that saints of God 60 about 62 years achieved in she'd been dealing with this all the time where Satan had her bound and just horrible horrible horrible things every night it happened and she said and I said I and I saw her again and she says Stephen it's so wonderful and she said I could sleep on my back it's just so wonderful to be able to sleep on my back praise God and do you know what it sinks of God what's so wonderful and it's for each one of us is that we took the Word of God we and we sent the Lord Jesus and I just said just sent the Lord Jesus over to take two for her to take the name of Jesus with her and you know what the feeling that I felt is Jesus went took care of business he really did it that she been doing this for 62 years and I just one time just freely she freely share with what I had received and he took care of business just like that he just took care of it and it was just amazing how it's like if you send someone to do something and you don't know if it's going to happen or not and you don't know they're gonna be able to do it or not cuz this is an instrumental task you know like I said about the status quo you know maybe this happened maybe and you come back and you hear they took care of business it's over that's to me what says there's no God like my god even though we've seen it before in the past when it's personal like that where you say there's no God like my god he'd take care of it just just speaking his name bringing his presence on the scene and taking care of his daughter Debbie he said she said she told me she said when I was when I was having a hard time with the Lord years ago she said my daughter came to me and she said I saw Jesus mom and she said he told me to tell you that to believe in him and then he's coming back soon so it held her in that time I tailed her in that time and that sometimes we hear silence from God and yet how his promises are speaking to us saints of God we say the Lord you're silent and yet we have a whole love letter of 550 500 promises in his word and more I has not seen or years not heard orders never even entered in the heart of man what God has in store for those that love them that's not just on the other side saying to God that's right now right here this morning amen praise God amen do you believe it Amen praise God hallelujah amen let's just all stand this morning praise God let's just bow our heads in his presence there's fullness of joy and then right at his right hand misery's for every more no pleasures forevermore Heavenly Father we come before you this morning Lord knowing that your
