[24:14] I want you to say like you
[24:23] these are
[24:33] Oh
[24:45] in the name of
[24:56] I just like rubbing that in the devil's
[24:58] face he can rage all he want to he is
[25:07] defeated totally defeated as we stand
[25:14] we're gonna go right into the word of
[25:17] God
[25:18] god bless each and every one of you we
[25:22] have been dealing with the subject of
[25:26] preparing for a new world it is
[25:29] absolutely in plain view we can see the
[25:34] prophecies being fulfilled right before
[25:38] our eyes
[25:47] excuse me
[25:53] and we're so grateful that we have been
[25:57] chosen by God we didn't choose him he
[26:04] chose us and I am so grateful tonight
[26:11] that God knows how to preserve the soul
[26:15] you don't preserve your soul it is God
[26:19] who has preserved your soul is that
[26:23] right
[26:24] it is God who has kept this secret from
[26:27] the foundation of the world he put our
[26:30] names in the Lamb's Book of Life
[26:32] he hid us there but now that book has
[26:37] been opened it is now time for the
[26:40] manifestations of the sons of God the
[26:43] whole of creation have known and groaned
[26:47] and still do until the sons of God is
[26:52] made manifest understand when the sons
[26:57] of God gets in their place then the
[27:02] world would get in their place things
[27:04] will change they talk about a new order
[27:07] a new order is coming ha ha ha but it's
[27:11] not according to the way they think it
[27:13] is according to the way God has thought
[27:18] is that all right you and I we want you
[27:22] to turn by God's grace we realize like I
[27:26] said we're living in the last days God
[27:28] is recreating and I'm glad to be a part
[27:32] of that creation I'm so glad to see that
[27:37] I am in a process that cannot be stopped
[27:42] it cannot be hindered because God said
[27:46] that he had begun the good work in us is
[27:49] faithful to complete it you and I must
[27:53] understand we did not come here by
[27:56] choice if I could say it like this God
[28:00] dropped us in to this dimension
[28:05] hello and you and I must understand that
[28:09] before that happened a choice was made
[28:13] you may not remember it but the choice
[28:18] was made just like God made the choice
[28:22] of Calvary he decided that kalbarri was
[28:28] the best way to do it he made that
[28:30] choice and he came and fulfilled that
[28:34] choice and so therefore God gave us a
[28:38] choice and because we qu chose Amen to
[28:43] follow Jesus then we are now following
[28:47] him now this is not some coincident this
[28:52] is not something where we can think that
[28:55] well I just think that you know we came
[28:59] here by chance but I want to tell you
[29:02] that we you did not come here by chance
[29:05] God for ordained each and every one of
[29:08] us and I'm just so happy to be one of
[29:12] his I was telling her brother the other
[29:14] day I could have been a lot of things
[29:16] and you know but I'm so glad he didn't
[29:19] make me Judas and that has turned to
[29:25] second Thessalonians 2 the brother said
[29:33] I've never heard that before but I tell
[29:36] you what mighty men have come and gone
[29:42] but what makes a man mighty and when he
[29:47] can submit to the will of God Moses was
[29:52] the meekest man outside of Christ but
[29:57] the meekness was not weakness the
[30:00] meekness was that he was able to follow
[30:03] the leadership of what we call the
[30:06] pillar of fire 2nd Thessalonians 2 we're
[30:12] gonna read a couple of passage of
[30:13] Scripture because we're living in the
[30:16] last days can you
[30:19] we're living in the last days and you
[30:23] and I must ask God to give us vision you
[30:30] know Jesus told us in order to escape
[30:32] the wrath that is to come we much watch
[30:36] and pray watch and pray and I find out
[30:43] that a lot of people watch but they
[30:46] don't pray but you must watch and pray
[30:50] that God will account you worthy to
[30:53] escape a lot of people don't see it they
[30:57] really think the world is gonna continue
[30:59] on the way it is going somebody might
[31:02] even think we got another 100 I don't
[31:05] believe it I can't imagine it and I'm so
[31:08] glad if we do have another hundred
[31:10] within that hundred I'll be gone it is a
[31:18] fact that if the generations that was
[31:23] before us because just catch a vision of
[31:28] what the America has become they would
[31:33] die from a heart attack Daniel saw the
[31:39] end time and the Bible said he got so
[31:42] sick I forgot how many days he was on
[31:47] his bed just sick because he could not
[31:50] imagine a man who was created in God's
[31:55] image that he would become so perverted
[31:59] and things would get so loose where men
[32:04] would actually lose their identity and
[32:07] they would forget who they are and we're
[32:13] living in that day second Thessalonians
[32:18] 2 one two three now we beseech you
[32:21] brethren by the coming of our Lord Jesus
[32:26] Christ and by our gathering together
[32:30] unto Him
[32:32] see when you come the church you're not
[32:34] gathering unto me you're gathering unto
[32:37] Him if you have the Holy Spirit you are
[32:40] gathering unto Christ right so you
[32:44] understand that if I'm under the
[32:47] anointing of God it's not me that speak
[32:49] but God through me I'm just a veil and I
[32:53] tried my best to prepare myself to be
[32:56] able to move out of his way so that he
[32:59] can speak just not a preacher and not a
[33:02] theologian but a son of God that has
[33:08] been ordained by God to preach and so
[33:13] you must understand that if you come
[33:15] here and you said well brother Brooks
[33:17] preach the good message you missed and
[33:21] you did not recognize the presence of
[33:25] God it is it either it is or it is not
[33:33] but something gathers you something
[33:36] pulls you together amen to hear the word
[33:39] and the Bible tells us where the caucus
[33:43] is there were the Eagles be gathered we
[33:51] are gathered together unto him that ye
[33:54] be not soon shaken in mind or be
[33:58] troubled neither by spirit nor by word
[34:04] nor by letter as from us as that day of
[34:09] Christ is at hand now you must
[34:13] understand this letter was written
[34:15] almost 2,000 years ago but now we are at
[34:23] the end time so that you will know the
[34:26] Bible says that the day a day with the
[34:29] Lord is as a thousand years and a
[34:32] thousand years is as a day is that right
[34:35] the first two thousand years came the
[34:39] flood Noah right the second two thousand
[34:44] years
[34:45] Jesus Christ hallelujah amen the third
[34:49] two thousand years came the son of man
[34:54] come on we're at the end time hallelujah
[34:59] because the Bible tells us when the Son
[35:02] of Man comes shall he find faith in the
[35:07] earth not some other kind of faith but
[35:11] his faith not religion not denominations
[35:16] not organisations but the faith of God
[35:19] hallelujah and the only way you can have
[35:23] the faith of God you must have God on
[35:26] the inside because the Bible said that
[35:29] the just shall live by his faith people
[35:33] say don't give me that whole it goes
[35:35] where you can't make heaven without it
[35:40] let no man deceive you by any means for
[35:45] that day shall not come except there
[35:48] come a falling away first and that man
[35:51] of sin be revealed the son of perdition
[35:55] so we understand they have to come a
[35:58] falling away this is why you see the
[36:01] true Church of God dwindling in size is
[36:05] that right oh it's the truth remember
[36:08] when Jesus was preaching he had
[36:11] multitudes of people but as that day
[36:15] approached for the Son of Man to reveal
[36:19] himself to show who he really was they
[36:23] were all gone matter of fact the people
[36:25] who he healed and delivered was their
[36:27] screaming crucify him crucify him
[36:31] the very word that brought deliverance
[36:33] that's how it is today the very word
[36:36] that brings deliverance people are
[36:38] saying crucify crucify it that's
[36:41] nonsense
[36:43] you all think you're the only one right
[36:45] well I can tell you like this Moses was
[36:47] the only one right nor was the only one
[36:53] right Jesus was the only one right I'm
[36:58] not right
[36:59] but Jesus is let's move on one more
[37:03] scripture second Peter the first chapter
[37:07] everybody can't be right
[37:08] here's what I'll follow the I follow the
[37:11] big churches come out somebody you and I
[37:14] must understand that Moses had the
[37:16] biggest church ever he had over 2
[37:20] million in his church but how many of
[37:23] them were sincere how many of them made
[37:26] it to the promised land only 2 out of
[37:29] that great generation and that was
[37:31] Joshua and Caleb
[37:32] and Jesus said amen yes your father's
[37:36] did eat manna in the wilderness and yet
[37:39] yes they are all dead why they murmured
[37:42] they complain and they form
[37:44] organizations and denominations hello
[37:48] Nathan and Cora it's the same 2nd Peter
[37:54] 1 8 through 11 people don't even know
[37:58] who them what the mark of the beast is
[38:00] people but it is that way think it's
[38:04] coming no no the mark of the beast has
[38:05] been here for a long time and people
[38:07] don't understand when you choose your
[38:09] organization and your denomination over
[38:11] the word you receive the mark the same
[38:18] thing Cain did over Abel right second
[38:22] peter 1 i'm throwing a lot of things out
[38:23] i don't mean to but it's just what he's
[38:25] telling me to say 2nd peter 1 8 through
[38:28] 11 but if these things be in you and
[38:30] abound they make you that ye shall
[38:34] neither be barren nor unfruitful in the
[38:37] knowledge of our lord jesus christ
[38:40] now you think everybody would want to
[38:42] know what this these things are if it's
[38:45] going to make me fruitful and abound i
[38:47] need to know what those things are
[38:49] because as christians we don't want to
[38:51] be just Christians we want to be the
[38:53] very reflection of Jesus Christ but he
[38:57] that lacketh these things is blind and
[39:00] cannot see afar off and have forgotten
[39:04] that he was purged from his old sins is
[39:10] that right that's why you see so many
[39:12] Chris
[39:12] not living christian lives because
[39:15] they're lacking these things and they
[39:18] have come to a place where they are
[39:20] blind they're not living it because
[39:24] they'd forgotten where for the rather
[39:27] brethren give diligence to make your
[39:30] calling and election sure I love the
[39:33] scripture that means I can make my
[39:35] calling and election sure no doubt about
[39:40] it I know who I am and where I'm going
[39:42] for if you do these things you shall
[39:45] never fall you'll never disbelieve the
[39:52] Word of God if you do these things for
[39:57] so an entrance shall be ministered unto
[40:00] you abundantly not sparingly abundantly
[40:06] don't tell me what God can't do
[40:10] abundantly that means more than enough
[40:17] abundantly into the everlasting kingdom
[40:20] of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ let
[40:25] us pray
[40:26] gracious father God we thank you for
[40:30] your amazing grace Lord you've been good
[40:33] to us
[40:33] you've been better to us than we have
[40:36] been to ourselves you have delivered us
[40:39] so many times and you've delivered us
[40:41] you've given us great conquest over our
[40:45] own desires in our own ways father you
[40:50] have sealed us with your Holy Spirit and
[40:52] father I pray tonight if there be any in
[40:55] the house that don't know you that
[40:57] haven't experienced the joy of heaven
[41:00] that your grace will be with them
[41:02] tonight that you will touch them and
[41:05] give them a hunger for you Lord that
[41:08] they will never stop until that hunger
[41:11] it's fulfilled and quenched bless us now
[41:13] bless each and every heart as we
[41:16] administer your word speak through our
[41:18] lips give us grace to move completely
[41:20] out of your way in Jesus Christ's name
[41:22] we pray amen
[41:23] you may be seated
[41:28] as we have spoken in the past we have
[41:30] done about three lessons already the
[41:35] thing that gives me joy is to know that
[41:38] this world is not my home the Bible says
[41:44] that a man born of a woman is sure to
[41:47] die and you and I know that it doesn't
[41:53] matter how rich and famous you become it
[41:58] doesn't matter what kind what color your
[42:00] skin if you're born a man or a woman
[42:06] you're going to die the only thing
[42:10] that's going to stop death it's the
[42:14] blood of Jesus Christ see because when a
[42:18] man accept Jesus Christ as his Savior
[42:20] and really believe in present - the
[42:22] kingdom of God the Bible says doe you be
[42:25] dead yet shall you live and we who die
[42:30] in Christ we do not die it's let's put
[42:35] it this way as the science as we say
[42:37] there's another dimension there is
[42:42] another dimension that people do not
[42:44] know and they're not aware of because
[42:47] it's supernatural they can't pick it up
[42:49] on their scientific machines but it's
[42:53] dead right it's like television you
[42:58] can't pick it up with your eyes and your
[43:00] ears just as we are but scientists have
[43:03] developed machines that can pick up
[43:06] these sound waves in these pictures and
[43:08] display them before us is that right oh
[43:11] come on you not understand that Marilyn
[43:14] Monroe died in what the 60s or so and
[43:17] you can turn on the set and you can see
[43:20] Marilyn Monroe just as she lived in
[43:24] speaking talking acting showing that
[43:28] there is a dimension that we don't know
[43:31] of that dimension not only records you
[43:36] it recalls your thoughts your words
[43:39] your actions the clothing that you wear
[43:42] see if malleable road has to go before
[43:45] the judgement there is no way she can
[43:47] say I didn't do it because everything
[43:52] has been filmed and captured yep
[43:55] you understand me what scientist comes
[43:58] up with is something that has already
[44:00] been is that right Solomon said there's
[44:04] no new thing under the Sun hallelujah
[44:09] trying to say oh we believe that there
[44:12] is some teleporting I want you to know
[44:14] we did that long time ago hallelujah
[44:19] the Bible said Enoch walked with God and
[44:22] he was found not why because he was
[44:25] translated hello he was teleported the
[44:31] same Niger he meant was caught up by
[44:35] Chariots of Fire where did he go to
[44:40] another dimension see those of us who
[44:44] died in Christ we live we don't die we
[44:47] moved to another place there is a heaven
[44:51] and there is a hell and if you serve God
[44:55] you go up if you don't serve and you go
[44:57] down not to it but if these things be in
[45:03] you and you and I know what those things
[45:04] are Peter tells us add to your faith
[45:07] virtue virtue knowledge knowledge
[45:09] temperance temperance patient godliness
[45:11] brotherly kindness and the Holy Spirit
[45:13] which is love divine love see so when
[45:16] you get born again amen
[45:18] you just don't get born again it's just
[45:23] the beginning of growth hello
[45:27] for example when you were born a baby
[45:30] you didn't stay a baby can you imagine
[45:33] if we just kept the baby look and all we
[45:38] did was just grow that would look
[45:41] strange but we just don't grow we mature
[45:45] and every Son of God was born of God
[45:51] must mature
[45:53] and as we mature we much we're not just
[45:57] maturing into anything we're born of God
[46:00] so if we're going to mature we're
[46:03] maturing into the very image and
[46:05] likeness of God somebody help me here so
[46:09] the things that God is able to do we
[46:12] learn how to do them
[46:13] oh come on somebody you and I must
[46:18] understand that Jesus when he was here
[46:20] on earth he was God in flesh the Bible
[46:23] said the fullness of the Godhead bodily
[46:24] dwelt in him and while he was on earth
[46:27] he was teaching his his children his
[46:31] disciples things that were supernatural
[46:35] is that right see Jesus was a carpenter
[46:38] but never in the scripture you'll find
[46:41] out Jesus showing him how to build a
[46:42] natural house but he did teach them how
[46:46] to build spiritual houses is that right
[46:51] hallelujah he even came to Nicodemus as
[46:54] listen you Manuka demons came to him
[46:57] says Nicodemus you must be born again
[46:59] because I want you to understand they're
[47:02] two worlds here there's a natural
[47:03] there's a spiritual world you've been
[47:05] born into this this natural world that
[47:08] is your first coming hallelujah but even
[47:12] as Jesus has a second coming don't you
[47:15] realize you have a second coming that if
[47:18] you came from God you go back to God and
[47:25] while he was here amen our first coming
[47:29] we came natural that's what the Bible
[47:31] says according Corinthians coming
[47:33] natural man you come corruptible you're
[47:40] born in a house of death
[47:43] this is a world of death
[47:46] everything that's born in it dies it's
[47:51] just the opposite of what's on the other
[47:53] side there is a world where you're never
[47:57] done and we are preparing we who are
[48:04] true Christians are preparing
[48:07] for the world to come this is why we
[48:10] press like Paul said perast toward the
[48:13] lock of a hot colon which is in Christ
[48:16] Jesus
[48:16] it's a press it just doesn't drop in
[48:21] your lap you and I who have grown to to
[48:26] maturity we've come to an old age some
[48:28] of us amen and as a child we grow up and
[48:31] how many of us when we were 18 years old
[48:32] we thought we were men all right we
[48:37] thought we knew it hallelujah mom and
[48:38] dad couldn't tell us nothing but now
[48:41] when we get father you look back and
[48:42] says oh I wish I can do it over
[48:45] why because amen as you mature you begin
[48:49] to learn and you began to understand
[48:51] that a lot of these things you did in
[48:53] the way you make decisions were childish
[48:56] ways of doing it
[48:58] and that's why Paul said I put away the
[49:00] childish things now that I'm a man I'm
[49:03] doing it I'm working as a man hallelujah
[49:06] you love the Lord so you and I must
[49:09] understand scuse me you and I must
[49:12] understand Amen that God is bringing us
[49:15] to a place that we're preparing for
[49:18] another world people think Christianity
[49:21] is just a a a denomination or cult or
[49:26] something to do some people think it's
[49:28] insanity but we're the only truth you
[49:32] we're the only people that has sanity a
[49:35] lot of what people think it's insane is
[49:37] what I mean but we're the only one that
[49:39] has sanity but because we know we're
[49:42] going to die and we're living preparing
[49:47] to die so we can live is that right I'm
[49:52] dying to live if that makes sense
[49:56] I'm losing out of the way so God can
[49:59] live in me which I press books that's
[50:02] nonsense
[50:03] but let me ask you about this then let
[50:05] me this is one of the old ones but let
[50:06] me ask you where were you before you got
[50:10] here there's an answer but I mean do
[50:15] anybody remember when you were in your
[50:16] mother's womb you were there
[50:21] nine months if you were healthy and that
[50:25] world was lovely you didn't have to work
[50:30] all you had to do was play suck your
[50:34] thumb if you won't - right
[50:38] sometimes mama eats something that you
[50:39] like and you gave her a kick and said
[50:41] thank you and then there were times she
[50:44] would eat something that you didn't like
[50:46] and you gave her more than a kick you
[50:49] made her bring it back up
[50:51] come on so you gotta understand what in
[50:54] that world it was a nine months world
[50:57] that you lived in and you don't remember
[51:00] it but it's a fact that's the only way
[51:04] you could have gotten here hallelujah so
[51:09] you said well what are you saying
[51:10] brother looks I'm saying before you were
[51:12] in your mother's womb you were somewhere
[51:15] you don't remember it but you got here
[51:20] hallelujah out of the millions of germs
[51:23] that that your father produced you was
[51:28] that one in a million your birth in your
[51:33] selection was more supernatural than the
[51:37] birth of Jesus God didn't have to go
[51:40] through a million
[51:42] there was only one but the man produces
[51:47] a million sperms our law and many of
[51:51] those spawns are those seeds get to the
[51:53] egg before others do but only one
[51:57] it's predestinated only one has your
[52:02] code on it that's why I try to tell
[52:04] people if I made it then I can make it
[52:06] again hallelujah if I made it then I can
[52:11] make it again hallelujah I and you are
[52:15] deep predestinated to be with us we come
[52:21] to this earth and guess what we had a
[52:24] decision to make a breath or not to take
[52:27] a breath hello yeah I got I got
[52:32] something coming for you at the well but
[52:34] some people think wow you know this is
[52:36] this thing is random random nothing is
[52:38] random
[52:40] everything that happens God
[52:43] predestinated to be just as that
[52:48] hallelujah
[52:51] they move on so we know that as we move
[52:55] along the Christ and people don't
[52:57] understand listen people you've got to
[52:59] be born again in order to mature you got
[53:01] to be a baby in Christ in order to be a
[53:03] man in Christ or woman in Christ
[53:06] you just don't become a woman or a man
[53:09] some people get saving it I'm here know
[53:12] when you get saved at the beginning that
[53:14] is just the beginning and like a toddler
[53:17] and like one you're going to make
[53:18] mistakes you go far you go skinned your
[53:21] knee and everybody's gonna say get up
[53:22] get up cuz you're young but then when
[53:25] you get old and you start doing that
[53:29] people don't treat you like they used to
[53:32] no because they expect you to mature
[53:35] into a greater Christian you don't stay
[53:39] the same
[53:40] color is that right even Paul had
[53:43] refuses listen you'd still drinking milk
[53:47] when you ought to be on meat you ought
[53:50] to be teaching and you're still acting
[53:51] like babies the pastor's not gonna burp
[53:56] you when you are come become a certain
[54:00] age you learned how to burp yourself a
[54:08] people want all past it please this is
[54:17] the hour that you must grow up songs of
[54:22] Solomon said that God is coming back for
[54:25] a mature bride he's not coming back for
[54:28] a little girl in character she must be
[54:32] mature she must be like he is she must
[54:37] be that way Oh in order to be compatible
[54:40] she has to be now
[54:43] it's not human effort
[54:46] you cannot do it I can't do it but if
[54:51] God if you would allow God to come into
[54:54] you you say old brother would you time I
[54:56] let God come into me the Holy Ghost yeah
[55:01] we as soon as we allow all those other
[55:04] demons come in you don't say man when
[55:09] that smoking demon said well I want to
[55:11] slow you don't say nothing when that
[55:13] drinking demons off I want a drink
[55:16] if the drinking demon and the smoking
[55:19] demon can rule you think about what the
[55:21] Holy Ghost who is God can do he'll take
[55:26] away all of your desires to sin he'll
[55:31] move in your life but you got to want
[55:34] him more than you want your own life you
[55:38] got to give him all and most Christians
[55:40] don't want to do that they say well I
[55:42] give God some of my life I give him part
[55:44] of my life
[55:45] God don't want some and he don't want
[55:47] hard he won't oh is that right oh it's
[55:53] like a man in a woman when a man marry a
[55:56] woman he don't want just her hand am I
[56:03] making sense I didn't marry your hand
[56:07] you're my body and I'm yours
[56:09] come on somebody it's the truth and so
[56:14] it is with God God don't want your hand
[56:16] he don't want your mind he don't want
[56:18] your show feet he wants everything you
[56:21] can offer hallelujah hey somebody help
[56:26] me here Unitas understand
[56:28] it meant that we are on a road to a new
[56:31] civilization we are on our way to a new
[56:35] world this one is going to be destroyed
[56:38] don't tell me it will be it's already in
[56:43] the making hallelujah is that right
[56:47] they didn't want to believe no one his
[56:48] day but did it happen people still
[56:52] questioning that even after scientists
[56:55] have actually found the ark on the top
[56:57] of Mount Eric you know did you know
[56:59] motors
[57:00] Moses took a rope and he climbed up
[57:02] there with that boat no that's it
[57:08] nonsense that boat settled there on the
[57:12] top of Mount act-out rack because the
[57:14] Bible said it did hallelujah and how did
[57:19] a boat get way up there is because the
[57:21] waters were way up there and that's one
[57:24] of the highest tallest mountains in the
[57:26] whole entire world
[57:30] let scientists explain that one y'all
[57:34] hear me we have a prayer on our side
[57:38] did y'all know that jesus prayed for you
[57:44] hallelujah
[57:45] Saint John 17:20 says neither pray I for
[57:48] these alone but for them also which
[57:51] shall believe on me through their word
[57:54] how can it fail how can it ever come
[57:57] shot when Jesus himself pray for you I
[58:01] accept the prayer when he prayed he pray
[58:05] for me hallelujah that they all may be
[58:09] one as thou father art in me and I in
[58:13] thee that they also may be one in us
[58:17] that the world we believe that thou has
[58:20] sent me that you and I are testimonies
[58:26] our lives that we live is a reflection
[58:29] of Jesus Christ we look strange to
[58:32] people because they can't comprehend us
[58:34] because we don't do the things of the
[58:36] world but don't feel bad about it that's
[58:40] exactly what we're supposed to do we
[58:43] don't put it on it puts us on it comes
[58:46] on it is already home it's just a light
[58:50] that cannot go out hallelujah oh lord
[58:54] have mercy that all may be one is the
[58:58] father and me I envy that they also may
[59:01] be one in us that the world may believe
[59:04] that thou has sent me this is it and the
[59:07] glory oh glory which thou have
[59:13] gave me I have given them that they may
[59:17] be one even as we are one what is the
[59:21] glory of God other than the Holy Spirit
[59:26] because the Holy Spirit is God Himself
[59:29] in you hallelujah it is Elohim it is the
[59:35] self existing one it's your Holman IRA
[59:38] you over this canoe hallelujah he's God
[59:43] he's hauling it all in you hallelujah
[59:47] that's why he told his disciples you can
[59:50] ask whatsoever you will and it shall be
[59:52] given unto you you got to believe it
[59:55] though
[59:56] it can't be some kind of hair knowledge
[59:58] well I know the Lord save me God ain't
[1:00:01] saving you in your head God saves you in
[1:00:04] your heart that's where the throne of
[1:00:06] God is it's in your heart
[1:00:08] whew somebody help me here because I'm
[1:00:12] gonna tell you something there's a many
[1:00:14] Christians who's singing and shouting
[1:00:16] and dancing and running up and down the
[1:00:19] house and can't live one lick hallelujah
[1:00:23] and they think they're gonna make a
[1:00:24] rapture because they feel the anointing
[1:00:27] let me tell you something Judas was
[1:00:30] anointing Judas cast out Devils with the
[1:00:34] twelve hallelujah Judas preached and he
[1:00:38] was a devil hallelujah Caiaphas's
[1:00:42] prophesy under the anointing of the Holy
[1:00:46] Spirit and was a devil hello Hey
[1:00:53] all of that that's where the world have
[1:00:56] deceived the people that's where
[1:00:57] organization denomination is to see the
[1:01:00] people it is the life of Christ you say
[1:01:05] well prove me brother Paul says you have
[1:01:08] faith to move mountains you can give all
[1:01:12] you have to feed the poor hallelujah you
[1:01:16] can give your body to be burned and have
[1:01:18] not charity with His divine love which
[1:01:24] is God himself it profits you
[1:01:27] nothing hmm the people ain't doing it
[1:01:34] you know why because they don't know it
[1:01:36] these are secrets these are things that
[1:01:39] God is imparted to his ride preparing
[1:01:43] her for a kingdom to come is that right
[1:01:46] don't believe that Jesus will call me
[1:01:48] Saint John 14 he says I behold I go away
[1:01:51] I go away to prepare for you a place
[1:01:54] that where I am there you may be also
[1:01:58] that means it's there because he says is
[1:02:01] there guarding stupid let me say it like
[1:02:06] this you and I have come into this world
[1:02:09] because God chose it and guess what he
[1:02:12] fashioned it just for you if you love
[1:02:15] mountains he created those mountains yes
[1:02:18] for you Oh somebody help

[1:02:38] home until Satan directed and do his his

[1:03:13] Allah he fixed that thing up just like
[1:03:15] that

[1:03:22] gonna be just like that oh I know some
[1:03:28] of y'all like meat forget it

[1:03:44] in the new world it won't be such of a
[1:03:47] thing let me hurry up you and I must
[1:03:49] understand that when we fail this is a
[1:03:52] pest house how many I'll believe that
[1:03:53] this is a house of diseases you can
[1:03:57] catch anything that's out there because

[1:04:17] and you couldn't reach it he torments
[1:04:22] you with it
[1:04:25] and the devil loves to see you struggle
[1:04:29] so you got to understand Amen that this
[1:04:32] is a pest house how many times Amen you

[1:04:46] you can't even remember what you're
[1:04:48] getting ready to say see he messes with
[1:04:50] us all the time but the civilization
[1:04:54] that's to come has nothing like this
[1:04:57] it's complete perfection way beyond
[1:05:01] anything you can believe it
[1:05:03] listen see there will be a civilization
[1:05:06] in the world that we're going to but it
[1:05:09] won't be this kind of a civilization see
[1:05:13] you don't mean for in the civilization
[1:05:18] we have sickness sorrow lust death
[1:05:22] everything in the civilizations is wrong
[1:05:24] but is that that civilization there
[1:05:28] would be none of these things we won't
[1:05:30] need science hallelujah
[1:05:34] science is the perversion of the
[1:05:36] original anyhow is that right remember
[1:05:40] it was after the fall when hey I'm
[1:05:41] children moved out and they began to
[1:05:43] fall on this and build this and music
[1:05:46] and all of that but before then there
[1:05:49] was a kind of canis pee around the earth
[1:05:52] and heaven and earth
[1:05:54] was joined hallelujah
[1:05:58] before the fall Adam could hear the
[1:06:01] angels singing yo y'all know y'all don't
[1:06:04] know that that's why sometimes when you
[1:06:06] get in the supernatural and God moves
[1:06:09] you into that dimension you can
[1:06:11] literally hear angels sing how many have
[1:06:14] had a witness to that uh-huh I've been
[1:06:18] in services where the angels were
[1:06:19] singing and they caught it on tape
[1:06:22] not somebody else's tape I can get it
[1:06:26] for you precious brother I hope and hope
[1:06:33] he still has it it's been so many years
[1:06:35] but we had that even if it happened here
[1:06:38] we had that happen here where the angel
[1:06:43] were singing Hallelujah is that right
[1:06:47] I'm a witness about 1213 people in this
[1:06:51] church heard them singing you say they
[1:06:55] couldn't have been an angel wouldn't
[1:06:56] higher ground I can tell you that now
[1:06:58] you would have known hallelujah science
[1:07:05] is the perversion of the original anyhow
[1:07:07] see you split the molecules you split
[1:07:09] atoms and do so and so to blow you up
[1:07:12] you take gunpowder and bang bang this
[1:07:14] kill to kill something you take the car
[1:07:16] in the kick job that the gasoline out of
[1:07:19] the earth and the materials out of the
[1:07:21] earth to loosen up the fibers so it can
[1:07:24] blow up and go down the road at 90 miles
[1:07:27] an hour and kill somebody see oh so
[1:07:30] nervous squeezing it squeezing and hurry
[1:07:33] up and we got to put pushing and taking
[1:07:35] and all it's all of the devil y'all know
[1:07:39] that and none of us think about it when
[1:07:40] you go to the mall but how many times is
[1:07:43] it so crowd you get frustrated people
[1:07:45] bumping all into you and everything else
[1:07:47] you don't know whether they trying to
[1:07:48] pickpocket you or what mr. truth it is
[1:07:53] pretty warm in here and I apologize for
[1:07:54] that the kingdom of God will not have
[1:07:57] automobiles I'm so sorry
[1:08:00] hallelujah we won't need them ask Elijah
[1:08:06] the Bible said the anointing of the Lord
[1:08:08] healed Elijah he outran the cherry
[1:08:12] hallelujah oh come on y'all believe that
[1:08:15] oh my Amen in scientists achievements no
[1:08:19] it won't have any education at all
[1:08:22] education came by the fall that's what
[1:08:27] the two I was thinking about that
[1:08:28] there's more tonight before coming out
[1:08:30] here stop it started out looking good
[1:08:34] y'all know what I'm saying get educated
[1:08:36] you need it
[1:08:37] and what has educated education done has
[1:08:40] educated the people away from God
[1:08:44] hmm they don't need him they become so
[1:08:47] smart and so intelligent
[1:08:49] they don't need God anymore we don't
[1:08:51] need miracles because we got doctors let
[1:08:54] me tell you something thousands of
[1:08:56] people are dying every day by the hand
[1:08:59] of doctors doctors okay as long as you
[1:09:04] keep them in their place but when you
[1:09:07] think that you're so smart and that's
[1:09:09] what's wrong with people they think
[1:09:11] they're so smart they think it outsmart
[1:09:14] God and that's the problem you can get
[1:09:16] your D D D LD d and don't know nothing
[1:09:21] you say brother Brooks don't say there
[1:09:23] let me let me prove it to you the
[1:09:25] Pharisees saw Jesus and called him a
[1:09:29] devil they called him Beelzebub the
[1:09:34] doctors of divinity in that day studied
[1:09:37] the Old Testament so well so when Jesus
[1:09:40] came they they were blind to who he was
[1:09:43] yet there was a prostitute at the well
[1:09:46] who didn't know nothing but she said
[1:09:49] when the Messiah shall come he should
[1:09:51] tell us these things
[1:09:52] [Music]
[1:09:53] he didn't she never called him a devil
[1:09:56] she recognized who he was and when he
[1:09:59] said I am he she read to the city and
[1:10:02] said come see a man who told me all the
[1:10:04] other things about myself is this not
[1:10:06] the Messiah who see that don't make you
[1:10:13] closer to God
[1:10:14] matter of fact most of those people
[1:10:15] don't even believe in God they don't
[1:10:17] even believe that that Jesus was born
[1:10:19] virgin boy I know what I'm talking about
[1:10:23] many of my friends just dropped out of
[1:10:26] theology because of that help us Lord
[1:10:31] God is simple
[1:10:33] God is simple and the only way to
[1:10:35] understand God you must become simple it
[1:10:38] is not the downgrading education I think
[1:10:40] God for that but when your education
[1:10:43] rules out God and the supernatural it's
[1:10:48] bad as well put it away and get on your
[1:10:50] knees
[1:10:52] see God has secrets y'all understand
[1:10:55] that I'm trying to hurry
[1:10:57] God has secrets and most of the time his
[1:11:01] secrets blinds the world hello they said
[1:11:06] tell us Jesus tell us plainly who you
[1:11:08] are remember that they questioned him
[1:11:12] who are you who give you that your
[1:11:14] authority we heard that you was born of
[1:11:16] fornication because Mary and Joseph were
[1:11:18] married hallelujah but tell us who who
[1:11:23] gives you this authority jesus said okay
[1:11:26] since you're gonna play this game I'm
[1:11:28] gonna play it with you John was he of
[1:11:33] God or was he of the devil and they
[1:11:40] gathered together near communica Council
[1:11:42] and they began to think now if we say
[1:11:47] that John was of the devil these people
[1:11:50] are hitting on stone us but if we say
[1:11:56] that he is of God then he's going to ask
[1:11:58] you ask us why didn't you follow him and
[1:12:01] so they came with a wise conclusion they
[1:12:04] said Lord we cannot tell and then Jesus
[1:12:07] I like it he says I can't tell you
[1:12:09] either hallelujah I love that cuk not
[1:12:14] smart God you can't outsmart him he's
[1:12:16] already got it he's far ahead of who is
[1:12:21] this ok listen and his secrets listen
[1:12:24] people cannot understand how God could
[1:12:26] be in Christ and Christ can be in God
[1:12:28] they can't understand that God is one
[1:12:29] and not three three divine
[1:12:32] the station but is one God one Holy
[1:12:36] Spirit hallelujah
[1:12:39] father in creation son in Redemption and
[1:12:42] the Holy Ghost today hallelujah God
[1:12:45] unfolding himself Oh somebody help me
[1:12:50] here now you and I we are preparing
[1:12:52] ourselves we are rising up in character
[1:12:55] we can't just say well praise the Lord I
[1:12:57] got fir virtue I could pray for the sick
[1:12:59] and there get healed that ain't all it
[1:13:02] you got to come to knowledge and your
[1:13:05] knowledge must make one statement he is
[1:13:09] God he that cometh to God must first
[1:13:12] believe that he is God and that he is a
[1:13:14] rewarder of them that diligently camp if
[1:13:16] you don't know that Jesus Christ is God
[1:13:19] your knowledge is of no value ah
[1:13:22] because once you know he's God I can ask
[1:13:25] you a question is there anything too
[1:13:27] hard for God God can do anything let me
[1:13:30] hurry up don't you know God supersedes
[1:13:33] for his own children he super sees his
[1:13:37] own law what do you mean God has laws
[1:13:42] when you die you're going to rot is that
[1:13:48] right when a podiatrist
[1:13:50] that dies rots hallelujah but God can
[1:13:54] superseded hallelujah Mary said Lord
[1:13:58] don't you know that has been dead for
[1:14:01] four days he's rotted he's thinking and
[1:14:05] you want us to open the grave he said I
[1:14:08] said if you believe you're gonna see I
[1:14:10] am the resurrection hallelujah oh I feel
[1:14:13] like shouting because you got to
[1:14:15] understand when it comes to you God with
[1:14:17] supersedeas law he will go beyond that's
[1:14:22] why I see you can't put God in a box you
[1:14:27] can't put him in about teeth go beyond
[1:14:29] that the Bible said he is knowledge is
[1:14:32] far beyond whatsoever we ask or think we
[1:14:36] can't imagine what he can do because it
[1:14:38] can go beyond your imaginations
[1:14:41] hallelujah is there anything too hard
[1:14:43] for God
[1:14:45] hallelujah let's blow up and let's say
[1:14:47] he is God that's the thing that I love
[1:14:50] it meant that God took one man and
[1:14:53] superseded right he conquered him in
[1:14:57] Egypt by one man one man Moses and Egypt
[1:15:03] was just like Russia or bigger
[1:15:06] hallelujah but one man would have stick
[1:15:09] in his hand with the orders from God
[1:15:11] with down the Pharaohs that Pharaoh let
[1:15:13] my people go
[1:15:14] and guess what Pharaoh had to let them
[1:15:17] go he after God whooped him up a little
[1:15:19] bit hallelujah superseding come on
[1:15:25] somebody think about it God listen the
[1:15:29] law said you cannot walk on water how
[1:15:34] many y'all can walk on water
[1:15:35] I tell you what the only way you can't
[1:15:37] if God says walk hallelujah but God
[1:15:41] superseded his love for Peter it was not
[1:15:46] in the world it was going where in the
[1:15:47] law there was nowhere in the Old
[1:15:50] Testament you'll be able to walk on
[1:15:52] water but that was God in human flesh he
[1:15:58] was the creator and still is I remember
[1:16:03] when I was in the University of South
[1:16:04] Carolina me and my instructor got in a
[1:16:07] big argument and everybody was afraid of
[1:16:09] him because he was an atheist and he's
[1:16:12] trying to tell people you know God
[1:16:14] doesn't exist and stuff and I had I
[1:16:16] couldn't take it I had to just go out
[1:16:17] with it I thought to myself if he
[1:16:19] flunked me let him flunk me but I'm
[1:16:21] gonna let him know I am a Christian I
[1:16:23] say sure you're wrong I said just with
[1:16:27] the mental mind men can do things
[1:16:30] hallelujah I said but think about it
[1:16:33] before Christopher Columbus came over
[1:16:35] here he had to have faith hallelujah
[1:16:39] he believed that there was something
[1:16:40] here by inspiration and he found the
[1:16:44] land because he had a vision that the
[1:16:47] land was there hallelujah I said think
[1:16:50] about it we just used a small portion of
[1:16:52] our brain if God would give us a whole
[1:16:55] thing hallelujah we may even have the
[1:16:58] village to walk through walls at the end
[1:17:02] of the day I got an a he was a man how
[1:17:08] can you do that I couldn't help it
[1:17:10] something like like like like Jeremiah
[1:17:12] said it was like fire shut up in my bone
[1:17:14] that man respected me from that day on
[1:17:18] hallelujah
[1:17:19] I didn't convert him but he respected me
[1:17:21] hallelujah you see what do you mean God
[1:17:24] was superseded I still wonder how in the
[1:17:28] world
[1:17:29] Jonah stayed in that belly over the way
[1:17:31] of three days down in the bottom of that
[1:17:37] y'all know the bottom of the ocean we
[1:17:39] can't even get a submarine down there
[1:17:41] that can withstand the pressure and God
[1:17:44] took him down there because after that
[1:17:47] the whale ate he wanted to rest and he
[1:17:50] went down to the bottom of the ocean in
[1:17:52] the depths of the sea which was a
[1:17:54] representation and the type of hell that
[1:17:57] Jesus would one day descend into hell
[1:17:59] for you and I is that right that's what
[1:18:04] Jesus said
[1:18:05] remember Dona as it was in Jonah so you
[1:18:09] and I must understand all these things
[1:18:10] were shadows in time let me hurry up so
[1:18:13] you must understand God was superseded
[1:18:15] what a minute wait a minute don't you
[1:18:17] know your battles let me say it like
[1:18:19] this like our brother our Caleb said you
[1:18:26] more how can i how do you see it the
[1:18:30] devil isn't more afraid of you you you
[1:18:33] you're greater uh how do you see it I
[1:18:36] can't remember but anyway you are more
[1:18:38] powerful than the devil he ought to be
[1:18:43] afraid of you I would be if I was to see
[1:18:52] a man they say shot stand still and the
[1:18:56] Sun Stood Still the Bible said it was
[1:18:59] the first time that God a beta man voice
[1:19:08] create
[1:19:10] why because that son knew who Joshua was
[1:19:16] hallelujah and I'm gonna tell you
[1:19:18] something
[1:19:18] the whole creation know who you are
[1:19:21] that's why it's important for you to
[1:19:24] come to know who you are
[1:19:26] once you know who you are then you can
[1:19:29] work it somebody help me here it's the
[1:19:33] truth how many times we prayed in this
[1:19:36] assembly that storms that were coming
[1:19:38] our way with disperser go somewhere else
[1:19:40] and it happened just like that and the
[1:19:43] news people said we don't know what
[1:19:44] happened but we know what happened when
[1:19:47] the sons of God begins to pray things
[1:19:50] have to change
[1:19:53] hmm do y'all know how big Jericho was
[1:19:58] and God superseded the law there was no
[1:20:01] army in that day could have told those
[1:20:04] walls down it was so thick that chariots
[1:20:07] could walk on them
[1:20:08] but God told Joshua you just March it
[1:20:14] wasn't the marching it wasn't the
[1:20:16] stumping I don't care what scientists
[1:20:19] say it was not the stopping it was their
[1:20:21] obedience
[1:20:22] if you obey God's Word he'll make it
[1:20:25] come to pass hallelujah I was telling
[1:20:30] somebody today I said cuz my brother has
[1:20:32] cancer same thing and I said the doctor
[1:20:35] told me I had cancer about two years ago
[1:20:37] and I cried the first time and then I
[1:20:40] regroup hallelujah hey I said hey no way
[1:20:45] I'm accepting that come on somebody if
[1:20:49] you accept it you got it you got to
[1:20:52] refuse the package I don't care if their
[1:20:55] science science signs that you got

[1:21:04] spina bifida I said if you believe that
[1:21:07] your baby got spina bifida it'll come
[1:21:09] out that way I said but if you know that
[1:21:12] God is a healer and God gave you that
[1:21:14] baby you believe that your baby is going
[1:21:17] to be right hallelujah and guess what
[1:21:20] they wanted her to abort that baby
[1:21:22] when that baby came out it was healthy
[1:21:26] that's that's what God does for his
[1:21:29] children
[1:21:31] this ain't no science is faith you love
[1:21:40] the Lord you and I must understand him
[1:21:46] and there's got to be somebody to
[1:21:48] manifest the word for this day huh
[1:21:51] God said there will be sons and
[1:21:53] daughters of God on the earth the whole
[1:21:58] creation is waiting and groaning to see
[1:22:01] the manifestations of the sons of God
[1:22:03] and they won't be able to see that until
[1:22:06] you and I become fully matured very
[1:22:11] image and likeness of God Oh miracles
[1:22:14] have always been signs and wonders have
[1:22:17] always been hallelujah from Genesis all
[1:22:21] the way up hallelujah
[1:22:23] but this age is when the true sons of
[1:22:26] God those who have been seeds to come to
[1:22:30] maturity this is the day this is the
[1:22:34] hour limit this this is not religion we
[1:22:36] this message is not a religion it's life
[1:22:41] it's blood the life of the blood
[1:22:44] hallelujah this is what we're working
[1:22:46] with we're now seeing Amen God manifests
[1:22:49] himself in human beings like he used to
[1:22:52] do see everybody think that it's all
[1:22:55] dead this with the young Pentecost
[1:22:58] pilly calls had a lot of signs but one
[1:23:01] thing they couldn't do they couldn't
[1:23:02] live it what do you say they could live
[1:23:04] it that's why you've got so many
[1:23:05] denominations hallelujah because they
[1:23:08] didn't know how to love their brothers
[1:23:09] who were different
[1:23:10] oh come on somebody but the love of God
[1:23:14] knows how to love even the unlovable
[1:23:20] hallelujah this bride she's not a
[1:23:22] denomination she's not an organization
[1:23:24] she is the word may manifest for her
[1:23:27] days this okay you and I must understand
[1:23:29] that God told Abraham I will bless you
[1:23:31] and I will make your father not I will
[1:23:34] now I have
[1:23:35] I have made you a father and you'll come
[1:23:38] to me in an old age did it happen
[1:23:41] Abraham is that right hallelujah and
[1:23:44] Abraham to this day is still known as
[1:23:47] the father of Nations hallelujah he said
[1:23:51] and you're going to be saved well and it
[1:23:53] was already done ha
[1:23:55] it was unconditional that's what people
[1:23:58] in this message you must understand in
[1:24:00] order to achieve this you must
[1:24:02] understand that you your companies is
[1:24:04] unconditional it's not based upon what
[1:24:07] you do and what you don't do it is what
[1:24:09] you believe
[1:24:10] it is what you receive hallelujah is
[1:24:13] that right it's just like Jesus telling
[1:24:15] Mary and Martha roll away the stone
[1:24:19] that's supernatural I still want to know
[1:24:22] how they did it
[1:24:23] you know you think Mary muscles you know
[1:24:25] they roll up their sleeve come on Mary
[1:24:28] Martha let's go no it was faith the same
[1:24:33] thing Jesus told them if you say to this
[1:24:36] mountain be that move same thing to
[1:24:40] women how many I been to Jerusalem
[1:24:41] before I've been there I've seen the
[1:24:44] grave I've seen how huge the stone would
[1:24:46] have been and no two women could have
[1:24:49] ever moved that stone without faith oh
[1:24:53] you think that's impossible
[1:24:55] how you gonna get up out of the grave

[1:24:58] there you got to have faith that is
[1:25:03] gonna come for Lu you Oh somebody help
[1:25:06] me here yeah it does that right the
[1:25:09] Bible said the Old Testament Saints died
[1:25:11] in faith not having received the
[1:25:15] promises that they knew it was coming
[1:25:17] what was the promises promised son the
[1:25:20] resurrection hallelujah and with that
[1:25:24] resurrection King there was some that
[1:25:26] may have been just about a teaspoon of
[1:25:28] ashes left but when Jesus rose from the
[1:25:31] dead the Bible said they all rose the
[1:25:36] graves were opened reach all scripture
[1:25:37] they walked around about 40 days before
[1:25:42] they went up in their theophanies
[1:25:45] glorified body excuse me
[1:25:49] hmm see you don't die that's why when
[1:25:52] when Jesus Christ was on Mount
[1:25:54] Transfiguration Moses and Elijah was
[1:25:56] there when when Sam or when Saul went to
[1:25:59] the Witch of Endor the call of Samuel
[1:26:02] Samuel was still there whew supernatural
[1:26:08] God and the supernatural people I'm
[1:26:10] tired of being natural you ought to be
[1:26:16] tired of being natural you ought to be
[1:26:20] thirsty and crying out for the
[1:26:22] supernatural hello if you're born
[1:26:26] supernatural that's what you want

[1:26:40] birth mom it's actually on my
[1:26:43] certificate born on the day of Pentecost

[1:26:53] Holy Ghost were you there oh come on I
[1:26:55] was there when Paul preached all night
[1:27:01] that man fell out of the window and Paul
[1:27:04] went over there and pray for him and he
[1:27:05] rolled back to life were you there
[1:27:07] I was there why because wherever God is
[1:27:11] I am Oh somebody help me here oh that's
[1:27:17] just the way it is I mean you can't you
[1:27:18] may not be able to see it but I'm I'm
[1:27:20] saying Lord remember me cause me to
[1:27:22] remember cause me to remember what
[1:27:24] caused me to remember cuz I understand I
[1:27:26] came in here
[1:27:27] sin gave me amnesia hallelujah hey man
[1:27:31] the shock of the cake gave me amnesia
[1:27:33] and now this message is opening my
[1:27:36] understanding of who I am and where I
[1:27:39] came from and where I'm going I'm
[1:27:42] look like a lunatic that's okay
[1:27:46] because this is not my world if there
[1:27:48] are aliens I'm one of them
[1:27:54] hallelujah and one of those lights gonna
[1:27:56] pick me up when these days oh come on
[1:27:59] somebody y'all got scared on that one
[1:28:01] but it's true oh but you see but he
[1:28:10] chose to come as Abraham see did y'all
[1:28:12] know that Jesus Christ chose see Abraham
[1:28:15] super seed the way he chose to come to
[1:28:19] show in this last day God super sign
[1:28:23] we're not just anything my that's why
[1:28:26] you must be born again
[1:28:27] because if you born just of the natural
[1:28:30] you're gonna repeat what your mom and
[1:28:31] your daddy did because you are product
[1:28:36] of the tree you can't help it that's why

[1:28:57] desire changes everything changes you're
[1:29:01] no longer connected to this world but
[1:29:03] you're looking for a city whose builder
[1:29:05] and maker is God hallelujah are you
[1:29:08] becoming Abraham's seed you become a
[1:29:11] supernatural trying to this generation
[1:29:14] hallelujah the doctors didn't even want
[1:29:17] to tell me I didn't have cancer no more
[1:29:19] but I tell you what hallelujah they say
[1:29:21] it was so aggressive it was all in my
[1:29:23] bones hallelujah I'm shouting on these
[1:29:26] bones hallelujah and all the stuff they
[1:29:38] showed me all that my point is what I
[1:29:42] was not going to accept that just like I
[1:29:44] told you my mother long when they told
[1:29:46] my mother Lord I hope I got the story
[1:29:48] correct the doctor said well you know
[1:29:50] you're gonna die she said did Jesus tell
[1:29:52] you that huh if Jesus didn't tell you I
[1:29:55] was going down what
[1:29:56] mean I'm going down you don't have the
[1:29:57] power of life one of these over you know
[1:30:00] people said well if you eat right you

[1:30:07] lie

[1:30:15] you you know have a better quality of
[1:30:17] life but when God pulls your card you
[1:30:21] can be as thin as a rail I got a brother

[1:30:27] call his name but I better not say that
[1:30:29] he's gonna listen to this tape but my
[1:30:32] point is he's still living he's still
[1:30:35] moving cuz he's a Christian
[1:30:38] y'all hear what I'm saying my point is
[1:30:41] there ain't no an extension of life God
[1:30:43] is already determined you're in and
[1:30:44] you're beginning hallelujah come on
[1:30:47] somebody

[1:32:53] it is let me hurry up God wants to give
[1:32:58] us that supernatural power right that's
[1:33:01] what the Holy Ghost is after which the
[1:33:03] Holy Ghost has come upon you you shall
[1:33:05] receive power and that word is Authority
[1:33:08] that means the devil will recognize you
[1:33:11] when you get that Olie ghost he must
[1:33:14] obey you not you not the power that not
[1:33:18] not you but you got the uniform on it's
[1:33:21] like the policeman he ain't got no more
[1:33:23] power than you but when you see his
[1:33:25] uniform you must respect it and that's
[1:33:29] how it's the devil when the devil see
[1:33:30] that you got the Holy Ghost he must
[1:33:32] respect you I'm almost done we've got a
[1:33:36] rising character in order to make this
[1:33:39] rapture the Bible says nothing that
[1:33:45] defiles the city shall enter therein so
[1:33:48] that means all your bad habits got to go
[1:33:50] whew but Lord how I'm gonna do it you
[1:33:54] can't but the Holy Ghost can whoa
[1:33:57] somebody help me here you got to learn
[1:34:00] how to pray I'm telling you that's where
[1:34:04] the key is it's in your prayer life you
[1:34:08] want God you gotta talk to him he said
[1:34:10] you have not because you ask not
[1:34:13] hallelujah things that ought to be he
[1:34:17] said if you would pray and ask God to
[1:34:19] clean you up from all these things
[1:34:21] that God will do it God cannot lie
[1:34:26] so we ain't got no excuse Lord I got a
[1:34:31] temper
[1:34:33] hmm that temper don't mean that in the
[1:34:35] God hmm
[1:34:40] you know God no future did y'all know
[1:34:43] that and he can tell you he said Peter
[1:34:47] before the crow thrice
[1:34:49] you going to deny me now how did he know
[1:34:52] that he knows he's God he don't need to
[1:34:59] television said he don't need seeing in
[1:35:00] he knows the news before it comes why he
[1:35:04] wrote it he knew what was next in the
[1:35:09] play in the drama and he told Peter you
[1:35:12] it's already written you're gonna deny
[1:35:13] me Peter said not me Lord ain't no way
[1:35:16] I'm gonna deny you Lord I die with you
[1:35:18] cheesy okay when the pressure came guess
[1:35:22] what he did not him why why did Peter
[1:35:24] denied Jesus under the pressure because
[1:35:26] he did not have the Holy Ghost he was a
[1:35:29] real Christian but he did not have the
[1:35:32] Holy Ghost he followed Jesus for three
[1:35:34] and a half years but he did not have the
[1:35:36] Holy Ghost
[1:35:37] every time you deny Christ when you
[1:35:40] under some kind of pressure it shows you
[1:35:42] don't have it like you ought to have it
[1:35:47] and he said if you be ashamed of me and
[1:35:49] adulterous generation he said I'll be a
[1:35:52] shame of you hmm
[1:35:56] is this okay I'm just gonna close with
[1:36:07] this scripture I'm not done I just have
[1:36:09] to keep going into not tonight y'all I
[1:36:14] could feel it just that quick not
[1:36:17] tonight
[1:36:22] 2nd Peter turn with me 3 second Peter
[1:36:25] the 3rd chapter I hope you've been
[1:36:28] blessed tonight folks we must take
[1:36:32] inventory and i'ma tell you in order to
[1:36:34] comment
[1:36:35] place where Christ want you you must
[1:36:38] pray you don't have a choice huh if my
[1:36:43] people they which I'll call by my name
[1:36:45] will humble themselves and pray seek my
[1:36:49] face and turn from their wicked ways
[1:36:51] then I will hear from heaven and I will
[1:36:55] heal the land is that right and so you
[1:36:59] and I must understand in order for God
[1:37:01] to heal you and to bring you into the
[1:37:05] character that you supposed to be or you
[1:37:07] thirst for and that's a good thing if
[1:37:09] you thirsting for righteousness he said
[1:37:12] he will feel you every man and woman
[1:37:15] that hunger and thirst for Isis he said
[1:37:16] I will feel you and never let the devil
[1:37:20] take that hunger and thirst from you
[1:37:22] it's not in your time the Bible said in
[1:37:25] God's time in his own time he makes all
[1:37:28] things beautiful and that's what I try
[1:37:30] to tell the devil every time he tried to
[1:37:32] make me fall and stumble I said but
[1:37:34] still yet in his own time yeah at the
[1:37:39] end of the day huh in his own time
[1:37:43] now I don't doubt it perfection his mind
[1:37:47] in Christ
[1:37:50] second Peter three eight through ten he
[1:37:52] said beloved be not ignorant of this one
[1:37:55] thing that one day is with the Lord as a
[1:37:58] thousand years and a thousand years as
[1:38:00] one day the Lord is not slack concerning
[1:38:03] his promise as some men count slackness
[1:38:05] but is long-suffering to us-ward not
[1:38:09] willing that any should perish but that
[1:38:12] all should come to repentance and that's
[1:38:14] what we're living we're living in the
[1:38:15] long-suffering of God time has already
[1:38:19] been declared no more everything that
[1:38:22] God started is only in look at all the
[1:38:25] nations they're all fighting each other
[1:38:28] not just in America all over seas
[1:38:30] everywhere even China everybody's
[1:38:34] fighting everybody's frustrated because
[1:38:36] they know somebody is going to push the
[1:38:39] button it's the spirit of destruction
[1:38:41] people that's what it is
[1:38:43] and the devil set the whole world up
[1:38:46] with with television and all of these

[1:38:51] brainwashed you know that people love

[1:39:02] how many movies they made about the
[1:39:03] world coming to an end and you know men
[1:39:05] man destroy in the world we told them
[1:39:07] that long time ago the Bible did it's
[1:39:12] going to happen and where will you be
[1:39:14] what sides will you stand on because I'm

[1:39:46] should perish but that all should come
[1:39:47] to repentance but the day of the Lord
[1:39:49] will come as a thief in the night into
[1:39:52] which the heavens shall perish away pass

[1:39:56] the elements shall melt with fervent
[1:39:58] heat the earth also and the works that
[1:40:01] are therein shall be burned up and they

[1:40:27] change it ain't all about climate change
[1:40:29] is about them exploding the bombs
[1:40:30] everything has laws and when you
[1:40:34] interrupt those laws it's a set things
[1:40:37] into chaos that is why in let me say it
[1:40:41] like you want me to say that is why in
[1:40:43] the book of Genesis something chaotic
[1:40:46] happened that left the world in chaos
[1:40:50] God didn't create it like that void and
[1:40:52] without form and shape no something
[1:40:55] calls that you say how you know that
[1:41:00] because he said replenish
[1:41:03] you can't replenish something unless it
[1:41:05] was something there before he don't tell
[1:41:11] us all the secrets and all the things
[1:41:13] but one thing for certain something
[1:41:15] calls that because it's coming back to
[1:41:18] that alpha has become is becoming the
[1:41:21] Omega and mankind is gonna cause this
[1:41:25] world to spin out of orbit and instead
[1:41:28] of going out like it did in the flood
