[31:25] for your sacrifice for being here

[31:31] let us turn to St. John, 4th chapter,
[31:35] the fourth chapter of St. John,
[31:39] and we're going to read the 24th verse.
[31:48] And then from St. John the fourth
[31:50] chapter, we go down to St. John 17.
[32:05] John 4:24,
[32:10] &gt;&gt; God is a spirit,
[32:14] &gt;&gt; and they that worship him must worship
[32:16] him in spirit and in truth.
[32:24] &gt;&gt; St. John 17
[32:38] 15th verse.
[32:42] &gt;&gt; I pray not thou should have taketh them
[32:45] out of the world, but that thou should
[32:48] keep them from the evil.
[32:54] &gt;&gt; They are not of the world.
[32:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:58] Even as I am not of the world,
[33:02] &gt;&gt; sanctify them through the truth.
[33:07] &gt;&gt; Thy word is truth.
[33:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We love the Lord.
[33:13] &gt;&gt; Let us pray.
[33:15] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father God,
[33:17] &gt;&gt; we come before you, Lord, as humbly as
[33:19] we know how.
[33:21] &gt;&gt; And we thank you for your grace and your
[33:22] mercy.
[33:24] &gt;&gt; We thank you for being so good to us.
[33:28] You have been better to us than we have
[33:30] been to ourselves.
[33:36] &gt;&gt; And we pray, Father,
[33:38] &gt;&gt; tonight that you look beyond our faults,
[33:41] see our needs, oh God.
[33:44] We'll be careful to give you the praise,
[33:47] glory, and honor. In your name, Jesus
[33:49] Christ, we pray.
[33:52] Amen. You may be seated.
[33:58] Amen.
[34:01] &gt;&gt; We just like to entitle the message
[34:05] &gt;&gt; the living God revealed
[34:11] dealing with the living God being
[34:13] revealed to you personally.
[34:20] I'm going to read a little quote from
[34:21] brother Brandham
[34:24] &gt;&gt; coming from 1950.
[34:28] &gt;&gt; I believe that's August 8 to 15
[34:34] paragraph 8.
[34:37] &gt;&gt; Here he says, "Grant Lord
[34:40] that something will be said tonight or
[34:43] done
[34:45] &gt;&gt; that will cause the wayward to turn to
[34:47] Christ.
[34:51] For we believe and feel pressure in the
[34:54] spirit
[34:58] that great judgments are upon these
[35:00] lands in the last days,
[35:07] plagues,
[35:08] disease, germs
[35:11] already bred up to be scattered
[35:14] throughout the nations.
[35:17] [Music]
[35:20] No doctor knows even how to take a hold
[35:23] of it.
[35:26] Oh God, we have to believe in divine
[35:29] healing. Then
[35:34] when nations are breeding germs
[35:36] together,
[35:38] they burst them in bombs
[35:40] and millions die in hours over it.
[35:48] I want you to understand this is 1950
[35:53] and the prophet is talking about what
[35:55] they're going to do.
[35:59] &gt;&gt; If he's not a prophet, I don't know what
[36:00] he is
[36:02] because that's what they're doing now
[36:04] and is already in the making.
[36:08] He said, "But oh, we're we're so
[36:10] thankful
[36:12] that when the destroying angel went
[36:14] forth,
[36:18] &gt;&gt; you said, "Touch not, touch not none
[36:23] that has the seal of the father upon
[36:25] their forehead.
[36:29] They are mine."
[36:32] Oh, we're so glad tonight
[36:34] to be under the blood,
[36:37] safely protected
[36:40] as Israel in the days of old,
[36:44] &gt;&gt; putting the blood upon the lentil and of
[36:47] the doorpost,
[36:50] upon the doorpost, signs of the cross.
[36:58] And when the death angel was sweeping in
[37:00] the land,
[37:06] the dark wings bowed down.
[37:10] &gt;&gt; But when he seen the blood,
[37:14] he rose up again,
[37:17] and I will pass over you.
[37:21] Waiting sacrificial lamb been killed.
[37:27] We take his body upon under the blood
[37:30] safe.
[37:33] &gt;&gt; Oh God, waiting for the midnight hour to
[37:37] come
[37:39] when the march out is called.
[37:46] We're going out some of these nights to
[37:48] the promised landed
[37:53] shard with the gospel of peace.
[37:58] the full armor of the whole arm of the
[38:00] gospel
[38:04] going forward. Help us, dear Lord,
[38:09] &gt;&gt; to buckle up tonight.
[38:12] Examine the post and the ll to see if
[38:14] the blood's dead.
[38:20] Then walk forward to challenge every
[38:22] enemy.
[38:27] Knowing that our great chief captain,
[38:31] the one that met Joshua after crossing
[38:34] the river,
[38:37] said, "I am the captain of the Lord's
[38:38] host,
[38:40] oh God."
[38:42] Joshua trembled.
[38:44] He knew that you were leading.
[38:48] Hallelujah.
[38:50] And I say all of this
[38:52] &gt;&gt; by the grace of God.
[38:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is the hour
[38:58] &gt;&gt; or the time that you must know who God
[39:01] is.
[39:04] &gt;&gt; It is imperative
[39:07] something or is is is of the most
[39:10] importance.
[39:14] It is necessary.
[39:17] Hallelujah. that you know who God is.
[39:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. In the message, who is God?
[39:26] &gt;&gt; The prophet said,
[39:28] &gt;&gt; the one that stood there and rolled
[39:30] stars off of his hand
[39:36] and rose worlds out of his hand
[39:41] and made the things which we do not that
[39:43] do not appear.
[39:46] Hallelujah.
[39:47] He said deity
[39:49] deity himself lived in manity
[39:54] the creator
[39:56] &gt;&gt; that made heaven and earth lives in
[39:58] mankind.
[40:02] Why? No wonder
[40:05] cripples
[40:07] when you realize that you're straighten
[40:08] out
[40:10] the creator is here.
[40:12] No wonder blind
[40:15] and they can't see. Open up.
[40:18] The creator is here. The creator
[40:22] &gt;&gt; realize who we are.
[40:26] &gt;&gt; We are sons and daughters of God.
[40:29] His offspring.
[40:32] I'm I'm reading this because you've got
[40:35] to know who God is.
[40:40] It is it is not only necessary
[40:44] &gt;&gt; but it is a must.
[40:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I'm not talking about a
[40:50] feelood.
[40:54] I'm not talking about a shout. I'm not
[40:56] talking about a dance.
[40:59] I'm talking about God in you.
[41:03] Because he said in that day, you'll know
[41:06] that I'm in the father. The father's in
[41:09] me and I am in you. Hallelujah. We must
[41:13] wake up to the reality of who we are.
[41:18] Y'all better hear what I'm saying. These
[41:20] things are coming and nothing can stop
[41:23] it.
[41:25] Once the word of God is gone out,
[41:29] it cannot come back void.
[41:34] Hallelujah.
[41:36] That's right.
[41:39] We are sons and daughters of God,
[41:42] &gt;&gt; his offspring.
[41:44] &gt;&gt; Then we're something like God was.
[41:48] Jesus said itself,
[41:50] it is written, you're gods, written in
[41:54] your law.
[41:56] We become a part of God, a son of God by
[42:00] the adoption through Jesus Christ.
[42:03] Therefore,
[42:05] if you realize that that very God
[42:10] that made the dirt and the earth
[42:14] and what'sever here
[42:17] is living among men,
[42:20] where is our faith, friends?
[42:24] Hallelujah. We've got to quit thinking
[42:27] like men.
[42:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. and think the way God would
[42:32] think. Hallelujah. He said, "These
[42:35] things I do
[42:37] when he was on earth, greater shall you
[42:40] do if I go unto my father
[42:44] and whatsoever thing you desire.
[42:47] When you pray, believe you receive them,
[42:52] you shall have them." That's the creator
[42:56] speaking.
[42:58] Is that right? Then it doesn't lay in
[43:00] him, it lays upon us.
[43:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[43:08] Who is God?
[43:09] &gt;&gt; He said now deity is here with us.
[43:14] Deity in us yet a little while
[43:20] and the world seeth me no more. Is that
[43:23] scripture?
[43:25] &gt;&gt; Yes. Ye shall see me
[43:28] for I'll be with you, even in you until
[43:32] the end of the world. Then Christ is in
[43:36] the church
[43:38] until there is no more world.
[43:41] Then if we can find where Christ is
[43:43] working in the church,
[43:46] that's the church I want to be in.
[43:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[43:51] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[43:53] &gt;&gt; So we must understand
[43:55] You can't understand God
[43:59] without being consecrated.
[44:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And you can't understand God
[44:05] &gt;&gt; without faith.
[44:08] &gt;&gt; And faith is a gift from God.
[44:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But to the bride of Christ,
[44:15] God has blessed us with every heavenly
[44:17] gift.
[44:19] He has blessed us abundantly with
[44:21] spiritual things.
[44:24] But how many of us possess these things?
[44:28] We're so busy about ourselves
[44:31] in our own lives when the work of God
[44:34] has not yet been done.
[44:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[44:39] Don't you realize the rapture can't take
[44:43] place
[44:45] until God see his very image?
[44:48] &gt;&gt; Until he see his likeness, excuse me.
[44:52] his likeness in human beings.
[44:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But understand this, it does
[44:59] not have to be a majority.
[45:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You better hear what I'm
[45:04] saying. Enoch was the only one
[45:08] that had the faith to walk with God.
[45:12] Hallelujah. And the Bible said he so
[45:14] pleased God,
[45:17] &gt;&gt; he wasn't found. He was raptured.
[45:19] &gt;&gt; He was translated. And the prophet God
[45:22] says that the bride is a type of Enoch.
[45:26] &gt;&gt; Y'all hear what I'm saying? We're not
[45:28] church people.
[45:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We are bride.
[45:34] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[45:35] &gt;&gt; And if we are God.
[45:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You must understand.
[45:40] &gt;&gt; It takes faith.
[45:42] It takes revelation.
[45:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:47] &gt;&gt; Hebrews Hebrews uh uh 11, please.
[45:57] You got to understand
[46:00] &gt;&gt; we go nowhere
[46:02] with
[46:02] &gt;&gt; without having the revelation of God.
[46:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[46:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[46:09] &gt;&gt; God doesn't m He said the devil don't
[46:11] mind you say, "Oh, he's Elohim.
[46:16] and that he's Jehovah Gyra.
[46:21] &gt;&gt; Can I say it like this? The devil knows
[46:23] that.
[46:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[46:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[46:26] &gt;&gt; But one thing the devil lacked,
[46:28] &gt;&gt; it's a true revelation of who God is.
[46:32] He He can't receive that. This is why he
[46:36] continues to fight God
[46:38] expecting to win.
[46:41] Hallelujah. But when you understand who
[46:44] God is,
[46:46] That revelation has come to you.
[46:49] &gt;&gt; You have you become an invincible enemy.
[46:55] &gt;&gt; Hebrews 11 1-10.
[47:00] &gt;&gt; This ain't about politics.
[47:03] &gt;&gt; This is not this is not about
[47:07] who and what we want.
[47:10] It's all about God. It's what God wants.
[47:15] Hebrews 11 1-10.
[47:18] &gt;&gt; Now faith is the substance of things
[47:19] hoped for,
[47:21] the evidence of things not seen.
[47:25] For by it the elders obtain a good
[47:28] report.
[47:31] Now what what did brother Brandham say
[47:33] faith was?
[47:36] Hallelujah. He said it was revealed
[47:40] &gt;&gt; unto Abel
[47:42] what the sacrifice was.
[47:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[47:48] &gt;&gt; Y'all understand me? And if that was
[47:51] from the beginning,
[47:53] it will be to the end.
[47:56] Hallelujah. Brother Brandham didn't work
[47:58] by hope.
[48:01] &gt;&gt; He worked by the faith and revelation
[48:04] that God gave him.
[48:06] Hallelujah.
[48:09] &gt;&gt; Did you not know
[48:11] &gt;&gt; it was a while before brother Brandham
[48:13] saw himself in the scripture?
[48:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[48:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[48:21] &gt;&gt; It was a while before that revelation
[48:23] struck him.
[48:27] But when it struck him,
[48:30] &gt;&gt; hallelujah, and he saw himself.
[48:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It changed everything.
[48:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. See, that's what I'm talking
[48:41] about.
[48:42] &gt;&gt; You got to know who you are.
[48:44] &gt;&gt; Well, I hope I'm bride.
[48:48] You got to know who you are.
[48:51] &gt;&gt; And if you know who you are, then you
[48:53] know that the scripture is yours.
[48:56] It is your inheritance.
[49:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[49:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[49:02] &gt;&gt; Through faith.
[49:03] &gt;&gt; We understand that the worlds were
[49:05] framed
[49:07] by the word of God.
[49:09] &gt;&gt; So that things which are seen
[49:12] were not made of things which do appear.
[49:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This is why I say faith is
[49:19] not just a thing.
[49:21] Faith is a person.
[49:24] And that person is Jesus Christ.
[49:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[49:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[49:29] &gt;&gt; So right because all things were made by
[49:32] him.
[49:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, is that right?
[49:37] &gt;&gt; There was no substance there.
[49:40] Nothing. But the word spoke
[49:44] and when the word spoke,
[49:46] everything came into existence.
[49:49] Hallelujah. And like the prophet of God
[49:52] says, God believes in his own word.
[49:57] &gt;&gt; So how can you be a part of God and not
[50:00] believe in the word of God?
[50:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[50:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[50:05] &gt;&gt; Now I'm telling you some things tonight
[50:08] because a lot of us think religion going
[50:10] to get us there.
[50:12] Our church going to get us there.
[50:15] So you understand the Catholic people
[50:17] believe their church going to get them
[50:19] there too.
[50:21] Hallelujah.
[50:25] And like I said the other day, you can
[50:28] be so well taught
[50:31] &gt;&gt; until your teachings will blind you.
[50:36] &gt;&gt; It ain't by teaching.
[50:39] It's by revelation. Upon this rock I
[50:42] build my church.
[50:45] Hallelujah. Those Pharisees were way
[50:48] they were taught far better than us
[50:52] but they did not have the revelation of
[50:54] the word and when the word came
[50:58] they call it the devil. Is that right?
[51:02] When Luther the Lutheran were taught so
[51:04] so well in the Lutheran doctrine
[51:08] [Music]
[51:10] until the Westlands came
[51:12] and the Lutheran called the Westlands
[51:14] the devil.
[51:17] And the westerns were so taught in their
[51:19] doctrine
[51:21] to when the Pentecostal came, they
[51:23] called it the devil.
[51:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What about us?
[51:29] &gt;&gt; What about us? We're so well taught to
[51:33] the Holy Spirit himself.
[51:36] Can barely move in the church
[51:39] because we know so much doctrine.
[51:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But he whom the Son is set
[51:45] free is free indeed. And where the
[51:49] Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.
[51:53] Hallelujah. Message or no message. I've
[51:57] never let anybody put me in prison. Oh,
[52:01] come on. You said, "What are you talking
[52:02] about, Brother Brooks? I'm saying you're
[52:05] so well taught. You're so well taught
[52:08] that the Holy Ghost can't even move.
[52:12] God want to move in you. You sit still
[52:15] like a law. Hallelujah. But when
[52:18] revelation strikes, hallelujah, I don't
[52:22] care who sitting next to me.
[52:25] &gt;&gt; I don't care if the president was in the
[52:27] building. Oh my God. When God move, I
[52:31] want to move with him. Y'all better hear
[52:33] what I'm saying. This is not about
[52:37] church. This is about the Holy Ghost.
[52:40] And if you don't know the Holy Ghost,
[52:44] your church rules
[52:46] and your church creed
[52:50] binds you.
[52:54] Is that right? Is it true?
[52:57] &gt;&gt; You can go to some churches and if you
[52:59] don't mention Brother Brandham's name,
[53:02] oh, you better not go there. They say
[53:05] you're not in the message.
[53:08] &gt;&gt; I'm going ask you a question.
[53:10] How many times did Paul say I mean how
[53:13] many times did brother Brandham say Paul
[53:17] &gt;&gt; and he said I'm following the Paul
[53:19] message
[53:25] you said brother Benam the message is
[53:27] the same
[53:29] I got your attention now
[53:31] &gt;&gt; let me tell you something if you don't
[53:34] see Jesus Christ
[53:36] &gt;&gt; you are an idoltor
[53:41] That's right.
[53:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's true.
[53:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[53:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[53:45] &gt;&gt; Paul said, "Nobody, I didn't die for
[53:47] you."
[53:49] Some say of Paul, some say of Cphus.
[53:52] This spirit has been around a long time
[53:54] ago.
[53:55] Hallelujah. But there's only one who
[53:58] died for me, and that is the Lord Jesus
[54:00] Christ.
[54:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[54:03] &gt;&gt; I don't disrespect Brother Panam. I know
[54:06] where he where he stands. Hallelujah.
[54:10] &gt;&gt; But how can I constantly look back
[54:14] trying to go forward?
[54:20] &gt;&gt; People don't like the way I preach, but
[54:21] that's okay. I'm not I'm not preaching
[54:24] for people and I'm not trying to please
[54:26] nobody here.
[54:29] We're trying to get you to a place that
[54:31] you can come to recognize who you are.
[54:35] Y'all understand me?
[54:37] &gt;&gt; There's a Bible full of types
[54:40] where you can see brother Brown in it.
[54:43] &gt;&gt; There's no doubt about that.
[54:45] &gt;&gt; But it but but who are you?
[54:48] &gt;&gt; Who are you? What is your revelation
[54:52] of who you are tonight?
[54:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[54:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[54:57] &gt;&gt; If Jesus had to find himself in the
[54:59] scripture, you must find yourself in the
[55:02] scripture. If brother Brandham had to
[55:04] find himself in the scripture, you must
[55:07] find yourself in the scripture.
[55:10] Hallelujah. And when you find yourself
[55:12] in the scripture,
[55:15] nobody in this message can put you out.
[55:21] &gt;&gt; Nobody.
[55:28] &gt;&gt; The thing about it, I'm not ashamed to
[55:30] talk about brother Brandon, read his
[55:31] quotes and things like that.
[55:33] because I know who I'm work what I'm
[55:35] working with.
[55:43] &gt;&gt; It's the Holy Spirit.
[55:46] &gt;&gt; Because I'm going to tell you how the
[55:47] church started.
[55:50] &gt;&gt; Peter did not have a scripture before
[55:52] him,
[55:55] &gt;&gt; but he was the word.
[55:59] &gt;&gt; And when he quoted Joel,
[56:02] He did not have a scroll in his hand.
[56:07] He was under the inspiration of the Holy
[56:09] Ghost.
[56:11] &gt;&gt; And the Holy Ghost fell.
[56:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What are you talking about
[56:16] when they were in Kia's house?
[56:19] They didn't have a scroll. They didn't
[56:22] have a book.
[56:23] &gt;&gt; But they were the word.
[56:26] They learn how to be led by the Holy
[56:29] Spirit
[56:30] to say the right things at the right
[56:33] time. Hallelujah. And then what
[56:36] happened? Kneel's house. The Holy Ghost
[56:39] fell.
[56:40] Y'all hear what I'm saying?
[56:42] The letter kill it.
[56:44] &gt;&gt; But it's the spirit that gives life.
[56:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[56:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[56:53] &gt;&gt; By faith.
[56:54] &gt;&gt; Fourth verse.
[56:56] Abel offered unto God a more excellent
[56:58] sacrifice than Cain.
[57:00] By faith, brother said it was
[57:02] revelation.
[57:04] And that revelation became faith.
[57:07] You say, "Well, brother Brandham wasn't
[57:08] that way." Yes, he did. When God
[57:11] revealed to brother Brandham what he was
[57:13] going to do, brother Brandham faith,
[57:17] that faith, he said, "I never seen it
[57:19] fail.
[57:22] I saw the vision. I can speak the vision
[57:26] and I know the vision is going to come
[57:28] to pass.
[57:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because I know it will never
[57:32] fail.
[57:34] &gt;&gt; What was that?
[57:35] &gt;&gt; That was God.
[57:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[57:39] &gt;&gt; You understand me? God. Jesus Christ.
[57:42] Hallelujah. The spirit of Jesus Christ
[57:44] is what? Prophecy.
[57:54] Yeah. I don't know how people do that,
[57:56] but they do.
[57:58] &gt;&gt; By faith
[57:59] &gt;&gt; was uh by faith Enoch,
[58:03] &gt;&gt; hallelujah, was translated.
[58:06] &gt;&gt; Did y'all hear that?
[58:08] &gt;&gt; By revelation,
[58:10] &gt;&gt; can I say it like that? If faith and
[58:12] revelation is the same, God revealed to
[58:16] Enoch
[58:19] what it took to get there.
[58:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[58:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[58:24] &gt;&gt; Now, how are you going to work it? If
[58:27] you don't know God, how you going to
[58:31] I'm coming to the scripture. Yeah. Amen.
[58:34] Because God because God had translated
[58:37] him
[58:39] for but for before his translation he
[58:42] had this testimony that he pleased God.
[58:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But look at this sixth
[58:50] verse. But without faith
[58:55] it's impossible to please him.
[58:58] He didn't say without hope.
[59:01] He said it was without faith.
[59:03] Hallelujah. And he told his disciples,
[59:07] &gt;&gt; "It is given to you to know the
[59:09] mysteries.
[59:12] I have hid it from the wise
[59:16] and the prudent,
[59:18] &gt;&gt; but I'm revealing it.
[59:20] I'm giving faith to my children, the
[59:24] humble ones." Somebody help me here. You
[59:27] got to understand, we need Jesus. We
[59:30] need that Holy Ghost. We need that
[59:33] power. Hallelujah.
[59:36] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[59:38] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[59:39] &gt;&gt; And I'm going to tell you something.
[59:41] People don't understand when they're
[59:42] dead.
[59:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[59:46] &gt;&gt; They're dead and don't even know it.
[59:49] Because if the word can't get you
[59:50] excited,
[59:52] nothing will.
[59:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[59:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[59:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. For he that cometh to God that let
[1:00:00] me let me say one thing about brother
[1:00:01] Brandham. Brother Brandham can even hear
[1:00:04] a Baptist PE preacher preach
[1:00:07] and enjoy it
[1:00:09] because he he would preach the word.
[1:00:11] Whenever he said he whenever he preached
[1:00:14] the word
[1:00:16] he said even it was just a nugget you
[1:00:17] say amen.
[1:00:25] &gt;&gt; Let me tell y'all something. You know I
[1:00:28] love you,
[1:00:30] &gt;&gt; but knowledge will not get you there.
[1:00:35] &gt;&gt; Knowing who Moses was
[1:00:38] didn't do them any good
[1:00:42] because they refuse to humble themselves
[1:00:44] to the voice of God.
[1:00:48] Knowing who brother Brandham is not
[1:00:51] going to do you any good
[1:00:54] when you don't live what he preached
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; is that right
[1:01:02] &gt;&gt; even Jesus said if you love me keep my
[1:01:03] commandments
[1:01:06] hallelujah I'm excited tonight
[1:01:10] but without faith it is impossible to
[1:01:13] please him
[1:01:15] this is where I'm going for He that
[1:01:18] cometh to God
[1:01:21] must
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; must must
[1:01:25] I'm going say it again must
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; believe that he is
[1:01:34] believe that he is God
[1:01:36] and that he is a rewarder
[1:01:39] of them that diligently seek him.
[1:01:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; Can I ask you a question?
[1:01:47] When we look at the the divine nature of
[1:01:50] God,
[1:01:52] &gt;&gt; what do you think that is?
[1:01:57] That's the elements of God.
[1:02:01] &gt;&gt; That's element. That's Elohim.
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; It is not a fleshly thing. It's
[1:02:06] spiritual.
[1:02:08] &gt;&gt; The divine nature is Elohim.
[1:02:13] &gt;&gt; Go listen to the message. Who is God?
[1:02:17] Brother Brandham said it was his nature
[1:02:21] that created everything.
[1:02:23] Hallelujah. And the nature of Jesus
[1:02:26] Christ and the nature of God is the
[1:02:28] same.
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; We're not talking about just being kind.
[1:02:36] We're talking about the nature of God
[1:02:38] coming in you and you then begin to
[1:02:42] behave like God.
[1:02:45] Hallelujah.
[1:02:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:47] &gt;&gt; And we call it what? The Holy Ghost.
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; The matured Holy Ghost.
[1:02:56] &gt;&gt; Some people don't understand.
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; But let me say it like this.
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; God has always been the Holy Ghost.
[1:03:06] &gt;&gt; There ain't there's only one Holy Ghost.
[1:03:10] &gt;&gt; Now in the Old Testament, they don't
[1:03:12] call him the Holy Ghost.
[1:03:15] They call him the father.
[1:03:19] &gt;&gt; He still was the Holy Ghost,
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:03:24] &gt;&gt; When they saw him in the pillar of fire,
[1:03:28] &gt;&gt; he still was God. He still was a father.
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, come on, somebody. When
[1:03:34] he come down and dwelt in Jesus,
[1:03:37] he still was the father in he was the
[1:03:40] same Holy Ghost. He was the same Christ.
[1:03:44] Hallelujah.
[1:03:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:45] &gt;&gt; Y'all understand what I'm saying? So
[1:03:48] when God comes into you, he's a what?
[1:03:51] &gt;&gt; He's a father.
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; He's a son.
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; He's a Holy Ghost.
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That one God is in you.
[1:04:00] [Music]
[1:04:01] Hallelujah. It's a revelation.
[1:04:04] And when you know that God is in you,
[1:04:07] you do not worry
[1:04:10] because you know
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; God is in control.
[1:04:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:16] &gt;&gt; There's only one true authority.
[1:04:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And it ain't the devil.
[1:04:23] &gt;&gt; The devil was stripped of his authority.
[1:04:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. There's only one true
[1:04:28] authority
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; and that's God Almighty
[1:04:32] who bears the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:04:35] Christ.
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; One authority. He was the one saying let
[1:04:39] there be who was that in the beginning
[1:04:43] was the word. The word was with God and
[1:04:47] the word was God. That same word came
[1:04:52] down and made himself a house in flesh
[1:04:56] and we beheld him as the only begotten
[1:04:58] of the father full of grace and truth.
[1:05:02] Hallelujah. But the Bible says he gave
[1:05:06] power
[1:05:08] to them who would believe they would
[1:05:10] become the sons of God. And what is a
[1:05:14] son of God is the pillar of fire
[1:05:18] stepping into your flesh.
[1:05:21] That's what it is. And then you become
[1:05:24] the tabernacle of God. Is that right?
[1:05:28] The Bible said, "Know ye not that you're
[1:05:31] the tabernacle of God." Hallelujah. And
[1:05:34] if God is in you, he doesn't lose any of
[1:05:38] his power. He's still omnipotent. He
[1:05:42] still is the only authority. He still is
[1:05:46] God.
[1:05:47] &gt;&gt; It's not the scripture saying ye are
[1:05:51] God.
[1:05:56] &gt;&gt; It's a revelation.
[1:05:59] &gt;&gt; But you got to have it.
[1:06:03] &gt;&gt; And the Bible says
[1:06:05] &gt;&gt; he is a rewarder
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; of them that diligently seek
[1:06:11] That don't mean picking up your Bible
[1:06:13] every now and again.
[1:06:16] &gt;&gt; That means seeking him.
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; When you search for something in the
[1:06:20] house that you've lost, you continue to
[1:06:23] search for it.
[1:06:25] You look in places that you know you
[1:06:27] didn't put it, but you look looking and
[1:06:30] looking. And then once you find, you
[1:06:33] like, oh,
[1:06:35] you know what? And sometimes it's right
[1:06:38] in your face.
[1:06:44] How many times you looking for your keys
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; and they're right in your hand
[1:06:55] sometime. I'm looking for my phone
[1:06:58] and my phone is basically said here I
[1:07:00] am.
[1:07:02] I'm looking right at it. I can't see.
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; What is that?
[1:07:07] either
[1:07:10] it was there and then it wasn't there
[1:07:11] and God put it there.
[1:07:14] He does.
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; I was just walking down the street the
[1:07:20] other day on my walk.
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; I had never seen a flock of doves
[1:07:25] before.
[1:07:28] &gt;&gt; A flock of doves.
[1:07:34] &gt;&gt; And uh I'm like, "Wow, that's awesome.
[1:07:38] And the Holy Spirit said, "Turn around
[1:07:39] and count them."
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; And there were seven doves.
[1:07:45] &gt;&gt; And then when I look up, there was one
[1:07:47] only on the wire.
[1:07:50] Eight months.
[1:07:52] I say, "Thank you, Lord. Maybe I'm being
[1:07:54] too spiritual, but I know what I know
[1:07:56] what I've asked God for." Hallelujah.
[1:07:59] And I'm taking that as a witness
[1:08:02] because I haven't seen the flock of
[1:08:04] doves like that since then.
[1:08:06] Hallelujah. I know. I know. My God. See
[1:08:09] what one thing I've learned
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; by walking in the morning. The beauty of
[1:08:15] nature and how God speaks through the
[1:08:18] nature.
[1:08:20] And when you when you really in the
[1:08:21] spirit, you feel him. You know he's
[1:08:24] there. Times it it was getting ready to
[1:08:26] rain. And I said, "Lord, you don't let
[1:08:29] it rain till I get home." And all of a
[1:08:32] sudden, the clouds part. You know, y'all
[1:08:35] think I'm crazy, but I'm going tell you,
[1:08:37] if you talk to him, hallelujah,
[1:08:40] fellowship with him, hallelujah, he'll
[1:08:43] reveal himself to you.
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. My God is the God of the
[1:08:48] clouds. My God is the God of the rain.
[1:08:52] Why shouldn't I talk to him like he's
[1:08:54] God?
[1:08:56] [Music]
[1:08:59] Sometime we don't even realize what we
[1:09:01] got.
[1:09:02] That's what brother said. Lord, I I feel
[1:09:04] that the church don't know who she is.
[1:09:09] Hallelujah. But you can't do it no
[1:09:11] different.
[1:09:13] If it took faith for Noah,
[1:09:16] it's going to take faith for you. If it
[1:09:19] took faith for Enoch,
[1:09:21] it's going to take faith for you. If it
[1:09:24] took faith for Abraham,
[1:09:28] it's going to take faith for you.
[1:09:30] And how on earth you going to get it
[1:09:33] &gt;&gt; if God don't reveal it to you?
[1:09:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:39] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:09:41] &gt;&gt; Yes, ma'am. Yes, sir. This ain't no
[1:09:43] work.
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; Faith is not even a feeling.
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; It's when you know that you know that
[1:09:50] you know that you know.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; That's all I can tell you.
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; And nobody can take that from you.
[1:09:57] [Music]
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; It's real.
[1:10:04] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham didn't preach this
[1:10:05] message for us to just read it like a
[1:10:08] like a newspaper.
[1:10:11] Hallelujah. He want action,
[1:10:15] hearing and acting upon the word of God.
[1:10:21] It's got to live. And if you are the
[1:10:23] epistles of God, that means you're the
[1:10:25] word of God living.
[1:10:28] Hallelujah. That's the truth.
[1:10:31] &gt;&gt; Storms come and you say, "Oh my God,
[1:10:32] what I'm going to do?" What do you mean?
[1:10:35] &gt;&gt; Think about the word.
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When anybody patriot or not,
[1:10:44] when Satan would come in like a flood,
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; the spirit of the Lord will always lift
[1:10:51] up a standard.
[1:10:53] What happens when you're faced with a
[1:10:56] situation
[1:10:58] and you can't solve it?
[1:11:01] You go to God in prayer. You believe God
[1:11:05] until things change.
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:11:11] &gt;&gt; Because you have faith. There's a
[1:11:13] revelation. If I ask anything in his
[1:11:16] name
[1:11:18] and be what? Believe it, it shall be
[1:11:21] given.
[1:11:24] By faith,
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; Abraham, when he's called to go out into
[1:11:28] a place,
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; which he should afterwards receive for
[1:11:33] an inheritance,
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; obeyed, and he went out, not knowing
[1:11:40] whether he went,
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; but he was going to receive it as an
[1:11:44] inheritance.
[1:11:47] We talk about a rapture. We talk about
[1:11:49] the change of the body. That's our
[1:11:52] inheritance.
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We don't know how to get
[1:11:56] there, but by faith we know we going to
[1:11:58] get there.
[1:12:00] Hallelujah. And then prophet of God
[1:12:02] comes along and drops in a vision.
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It was more than a vision.
[1:12:08] He said, he said, I was there. I hugged
[1:12:12] those people.
[1:12:14] &gt;&gt; I hugged those people.
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; Man and woman, and I saw you there. Now
[1:12:19] let me ask you a question.
[1:12:22] When your leader, God in the prophet of
[1:12:26] God told you about the promised land,
[1:12:30] what are you going to do? Oh my God.
[1:12:33] There's giants in the land. There were
[1:12:36] giants then. They're giants now. They're
[1:12:39] big devils in this world. Hallelujah.
[1:12:42] But what God did yesterday,
[1:12:45] he's doing it today. He's a giant slayer
[1:12:49] today. I don't care what the problems
[1:12:52] are.
[1:12:53] There's nothing too hard for God.
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, let me say it like
[1:12:59] this. You say, "Lord, I want the Holy
[1:13:01] Ghost." And the Bible said, "God will
[1:13:05] not give you a serpent
[1:13:07] for bread." Hallelujah. You want the
[1:13:11] Holy Ghost, you got to believe you going
[1:13:13] to get it.
[1:13:15] You got to believe it's for you.
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. And you know what?
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; Whether you feel it or not.
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; When the Holy Ghost comes,
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; it will change you.
[1:13:29] &gt;&gt; It'll drive those lustful spirits away
[1:13:31] from you. It'll drive that d that lying
[1:13:35] devil out of your life. Hallelujah.
[1:13:38] It'll it'll drive those thie spirits
[1:13:41] away. Hallelujah. The Holy Ghost will do
[1:13:44] it. Not you. The Holy Ghost will do it.
[1:13:48] Hallelujah. Because the Holy Ghost is
[1:13:51] the fire of God. Hallelujah. And he
[1:13:55] comes to burn every devil away from you.
[1:13:58] I don't know about you. But I can't be
[1:14:01] happy. Hallelujah. Fully happy.
[1:14:05] Hallelujah. Until I know that this land
[1:14:08] has been fully conquered.
[1:14:11] Hallelujah. I know I got the power
[1:14:13] within me.
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:14:17] &gt;&gt; And in his time,
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; I say in his time,
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; hallelujah, he's going to give me my
[1:14:25] mountain.
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; Look for a city
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; which had no foundation,
[1:14:37] &gt;&gt; whose builder and maker is who?
[1:14:43] Hallelujah.
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; It's more than just a mansion over
[1:14:46] there.
[1:14:49] &gt;&gt; He made you.
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Made you spiritual man
[1:14:54] first.
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Then he made us what? These
[1:14:57] old carnal fleshly things.
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But I'm going tell you
[1:15:01] something. God is God.
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; And you got to realize that God and
[1:15:06] Jesus Christ is the same person.
[1:15:09] And that at the name of Jesus, every
[1:15:11] knee shall bow, every tongue shall
[1:15:14] confess, that he is Lord to the glory of
[1:15:17] God the Father.
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; Y'all understand what I'm saying?
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; Use the name.
[1:15:25] &gt;&gt; Oh, I got to feel goosebumps. I ain't
[1:15:27] got to feel nothing.
[1:15:30] Use the name
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; and watch God. Watch God bless you.
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:15:39] &gt;&gt; You love the Lord.
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; Adoption to
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; 60
[1:15:47] live 18.
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; 1965 18.
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You love the Lord,
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; people. I am enjoying Jesus.
[1:15:57] Do you make mistakes? I make mistakes
[1:15:59] every day.
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; But I'm going to do what he wants me to
[1:16:05] do.
[1:16:07] &gt;&gt; I'm going to praise him in situation.
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; If I fall and scrape my knees, I'm gonna
[1:16:13] tell him thank you.
[1:16:17] I
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; I know what I'm talking about.
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; One time I was walking
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; and I stumped my toe on the on the
[1:16:24] pavement
[1:16:29] and I had to duck my head.
[1:16:32] In doing that, I ducked my head.
[1:16:35] And then when I looked around,
[1:16:37] there was a branch I was going to bump
[1:16:39] my head into.
[1:16:41] And I had rather stomp my toe
[1:16:44] than to bump my head on that branch.
[1:16:48] You say that wasn't God. That was God.
[1:16:54] Hallelujah.
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; Sometime he causing little things of
[1:16:56] pain,
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; but he you don't understand what he just
[1:17:00] protected you from.
[1:17:07] Paragraph 40.
[1:17:09] &gt;&gt; Let me draw
[1:17:11] &gt;&gt; you a little illustration here.
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; It's good. We go back. I believe I'll
[1:17:18] talk on it a little bit the other night
[1:17:21] or struck it in Genesis the first
[1:17:24] chapter.
[1:17:25] &gt;&gt; Genesis 1:26.
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; He said, "When God called his name Lord
[1:17:30] God,
[1:17:33] It's in the word
[1:17:35] l Elohim
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; which means selfexisting one.
[1:17:43] There was nothing else existed but
[1:17:48] listen closely. There was no air. There
[1:17:51] was no light. There was no stars. There
[1:17:55] was no world. There was nothing else. It
[1:17:58] was God and God alone.
[1:18:01] L E L E L E L E L E L E L E L E L E L E
[1:18:02] L E.
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; Now he made that. You understand what
[1:18:08] I'm saying?
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; So that same God that created everything
[1:18:14] is in you when you receive the Holy
[1:18:17] Ghost.
[1:18:19] Don't try to understand it. You got to
[1:18:23] believe it.
[1:18:25] &gt;&gt; Believe it, people.
[1:18:32] Keep humble
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; but believe it.
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; Inside of that
[1:18:42] &gt;&gt; was attributes
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; which meant that he was
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; inside of this great
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; Ella Elohim Elohim
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; was a was attributes.
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; There you go. You know what the
[1:18:57] attribute is?
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; Oh, let me say it this way. This
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; was a nature.
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; He didn't change his nature.
[1:19:09] &gt;&gt; Nature.
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; We don't even realize what God trying to
[1:19:12] get us to.
[1:19:14] We think it's just a poster up on the
[1:19:16] wall.
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:20] He's trying to put a himself in you
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; like he did in the body of Jesus Christ
[1:19:27] &gt;&gt; so he can say this is my well this is my
[1:19:30] son whom I'm well pleased and dwell in
[1:19:33] this is what he's looking for
[1:19:35] Jesus who was the first born of his
[1:19:37] creation hallelujah and we come after
[1:19:41] that
[1:19:45] &gt;&gt; hallelujah and Jesus understood
[1:19:49] what he possessed
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; and what possessed him.
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; So much so in John 10:30, which is one
[1:19:56] of my favorite scriptures, he said, "I
[1:19:59] am the father of
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This ain't no fairy tale.
[1:20:07] This reality,
[1:20:10] can I say it like this?"
[1:20:12] Brother Bon talks about a million to
[1:20:14] one. Oneion
[1:20:22] You weren't born a Muslim.
[1:20:25] God was your God.
[1:20:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; You wasn't born in Buddhism,
[1:20:32] &gt;&gt; Hinduism,
[1:20:33] Hinduism.
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; Look at all these religions
[1:20:37] and everybody think they're right.
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; And everybody almost can produce some
[1:20:42] kind of supernatural.
[1:20:47] Y'all hear what I'm saying?
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; The prophet of God told us that
[1:20:51] &gt;&gt; there's some Muslims that have put y'all
[1:20:52] Christians to shame.
[1:20:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But there's got to be a
[1:20:57] difference.
[1:20:59] Like that Muslim said,
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; he said, "Your prophet promised that
[1:21:04] when when you get the Holy Ghost, when
[1:21:06] you become a Christian,
[1:21:09] these signs shall follow you.
[1:21:12] What he did on earth is what you
[1:21:14] supposed to be doing. Now,
[1:21:18] people don't care. Oh, I'm a Christian.
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; And ain't no life behind it. There ain't
[1:21:22] no power behind it. No signs are
[1:21:26] following you.
[1:21:28] Some of us ain't never seen a sign.
[1:21:33] What is that?
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; Something you missing.
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; And don't confuse churchism
[1:21:41] with having the Holy Ghost.
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; You don't get a second chance when your
[1:21:49] life get ready to leave here. You're
[1:21:52] going to have to have that token life.
[1:21:54] You're going to have to have that Holy
[1:21:55] Ghost. That's the only thing that's
[1:21:57] going to take you out. It ain't going to
[1:21:59] be your memory. Oh, I know the quotes. I
[1:22:02] know the quotes back and forth, you
[1:22:04] know. No, that won't work.
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; It ain't going to work.
[1:22:10] You got to know Christ.
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; He said in that day,
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; you'll know I'm in the Father. The
[1:22:17] Father's in me and I'm in you. You got
[1:22:19] to know something.
[1:22:21] And it's a revelation.
[1:22:23] That revelation will bring some good
[1:22:25] feelings.
[1:22:28] Hallelujah. It's like winning a million
[1:22:30] dollars.
[1:22:32] You don't have the million dollars yet,
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; but oh my, it brings some good feelings.
[1:22:39] Hallelujah.
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; Y'all don't People don't know how fast.
[1:22:46] You know what? You can die right now.
[1:22:48] Each and every one of us can drop dead
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; right now. We could do that.
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; And the question is, are you ready?
[1:23:00] Are you prepared?
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; You know, it's amazing. We'll let the
[1:23:04] devil talk to us all day.
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; And then when God try to talk to you,
[1:23:10] you block him with your own thoughts.
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; You disrespect God.
[1:23:17] When you come into the house of God and
[1:23:20] you got all these other things on your
[1:23:22] mind as if he doesn't know it
[1:23:26] [Music]
[1:23:28] and he's talking and you're allowing
[1:23:30] Satan to talk to you while he's talking.
[1:23:35] I can't stand that.
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; I even tell some of the people at my
[1:23:40] house.
[1:23:41] &gt;&gt; How do y'all talk over each other?
[1:23:45] &gt;&gt; It's rude. It's disrespectful.
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; When they try to do that to me, I said,
[1:23:52] "Hold up, stop.
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; I can't talk and you talk at the same
[1:23:56] time
[1:23:59] &gt;&gt; and me understand you and you understand
[1:24:00] me.
[1:24:04] But we'll come here
[1:24:06] &gt;&gt; and the devil is talking to you
[1:24:07] listening more to him.
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord help us.
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; Can I finish? Inside of that was
[1:24:20] attributes which meant
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; that he was
[1:24:25] inside of this great l Elohim
[1:24:29] was an attribute.
[1:24:31] You know what an attribute is
[1:24:35] or let me say it like this was a nature
[1:24:40] that so the little fella
[1:24:43] will get it and I'm one of them little
[1:24:46] fellas that has to get it that way
[1:24:50] inside of him was the inside of him was
[1:24:55] the nature to be a father
[1:24:57] but he's selfexistent
[1:25:00] there ain't think nothing of him to be a
[1:25:03] father by.
[1:25:05] And now down inside of that
[1:25:08] &gt;&gt; was something else that he was God and a
[1:25:12] God is an object of worship
[1:25:15] but he was self-existent
[1:25:18] lim.
[1:25:20] So there was nothing to worship him
[1:25:23] inside of that.
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; He was a savior and there was nothing
[1:25:28] lost to be saved.
[1:25:31] And inside of that,
[1:25:33] &gt;&gt; he was a healer. See, but there was
[1:25:35] nothing sick to be healed.
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; Wasn't nothing to be sick.
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, do you get the picture?
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; So, his attributes, his nature produced
[1:25:48] what is today.
[1:25:51] Everything you see, everything that is.
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; You say, "Wait a minute, brother Brooks.
[1:25:58] Don't you understand? When God allow you
[1:26:01] to get sick,
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; it's only because he wants you to know
[1:26:04] that he's a healer.
[1:26:07] When you get discouraged,
[1:26:09] don't you know he wants you to know he's
[1:26:11] a burden bearer. He's a heavy load
[1:26:14] sharer. He's a peace giver. Hallelujah.
[1:26:19] All these things are coming to you so
[1:26:21] that you can come to know him.
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Every day. Almost every day.
[1:26:28] I just I just talked to him. I said,
[1:26:30] "Lord, you're so good to me.
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; You're so good to me." He do things he
[1:26:36] spoils me.
[1:26:47] I I I I I I I wanted a a massage chair.
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; The thing cost over $5,000.
[1:27:01] &gt;&gt; No, I didn't pay $5,000.
[1:27:05] But let me show you what God did. The
[1:27:08] brother where I saw the chair, he sells
[1:27:10] it
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; in Colorado.
[1:27:14] He calls me one day. Do you still want
[1:27:17] this a chair?
[1:27:20] He said, "My company is upgrading mine
[1:27:25] and and and I'll sell it to you."
[1:27:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:29] &gt;&gt; For a little or nothing.
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; Now, think about this because I'm
[1:27:37] thinking though you selling it to me,
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; I'm seeing God. How am I going to get
[1:27:42] it?
[1:27:45] And then he had a brother from his
[1:27:48] church who's coming on a business trip
[1:27:51] to De Mo.
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; He brings the chair
[1:27:59] while he's he brings the chair. He
[1:28:02] actually brings it into the house. You
[1:28:05] got to see God.
[1:28:06] &gt;&gt; And he puts it together.
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; And God knows my mechanic skills are
[1:28:11] just down.
[1:28:14] Y'all hear what I'm saying?
[1:28:17] I wanted me a hammock.
[1:28:19] A hammock. One of those things you lay
[1:28:21] in outside.
[1:28:28] Been want one for a while.
[1:28:32] And uh and then my my son and my
[1:28:34] daughter,
[1:28:36] they bought me a hammock.
[1:28:43] Y'all looking at me like I'm crazy.
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; But I'mma tell you like this.
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; When you really serve the Lord,
[1:28:51] [Music]
[1:28:55] God comes through.
[1:28:59] You know what I mean? I didn't, you
[1:29:01] know, I didn't beg God
[1:29:03] &gt;&gt; for neither of these things,
[1:29:06] &gt;&gt; but God gave it to me anyway.
[1:29:11] I'm telling you,
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; those are just little things.
[1:29:15] &gt;&gt; And I often think, well, if God going to
[1:29:16] give me natural, what about spiritual?
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; We went to the eye doctor today
[1:29:29] &gt;&gt; and my eye has improved so well.
[1:29:34] So they extended extended my time to
[1:29:38] come again.
[1:29:43] &gt;&gt; But you they don't know I'm speaking
[1:29:45] complete heal.
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; You hear what I'm saying?
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; And I'm waiting
[1:29:52] for the doctor to get shocked.
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; But what they didn't see is what I saw
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; in his time.
[1:30:03] Hallelujah.
[1:30:04] Oh my God. I'm so Y'all don't know what
[1:30:07] it is to get a needle in your eye every
[1:30:09] so
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; but I saw God today in a great way.
[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; I told you I saw those. I'm going to get
[1:30:21] it.
[1:30:25] &gt;&gt; Hey, I saw the doves. I'm going to get
[1:30:27] it. Is that right? I'm not comparing
[1:30:29] myself with brother Brandham. Brother
[1:30:31] Brandham saw those doves.
[1:30:33] Hallelujah. Or those squirrels, rather.
[1:30:36] And he got completely healed.
[1:30:40] Let
[1:30:41] &gt;&gt; me I'm enjoying Jesus. I hope you are
[1:30:44] with me.
[1:30:45] &gt;&gt; But I'm trying to get you to place to
[1:30:46] you'll know
[1:30:48] first. You got to know he's God.
[1:30:52] How many of us know he's God?
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; In your heart, people, you got to know
[1:30:58] he's God.
[1:31:01] Because if you don't know he's God in
[1:31:02] your heart, somebody's going to take it
[1:31:05] away from you.
[1:31:09] The squeeze come,
[1:31:11] &gt;&gt; they'll take it from you.
[1:31:13] &gt;&gt; If it's not in your heart,
[1:31:16] hallelujah. They said, "Oh, it can't
[1:31:18] be." So Judas followed him. How long?
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; It wasn't in his heart.
[1:31:25] Brother Ben said he was among the ones
[1:31:26] casting out devils.
[1:31:30] It wasn't in his heart.
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; And when the squeeze came
[1:31:35] hallelujah,
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; he betrayed God.
[1:31:40] Even Peter,
[1:31:42] &gt;&gt; it wasn't in his heart.
[1:31:46] That's why he lied.
[1:31:47] [Music]
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; And but God said, "I know who you are,
[1:31:51] Peter.
[1:31:53] &gt;&gt; You're a seed.
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; Cuz one day you going to be converted.
[1:31:58] One day it's going to be in your heart.
[1:32:01] &gt;&gt; And when it's in your heart, you go
[1:32:04] strengthen your brother.
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; Love the Lord. You got to know him for
[1:32:10] yourself diligently. Seek him. How do
[1:32:14] you seek him on your knees
[1:32:17] in the scriptures
[1:32:19] listening to tapes?
[1:32:22] How many of y'all do the tapes still
[1:32:24] move you?
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[1:32:28] Oh yes. Oh yes. Oh yes. Oh yes. I don't
[1:32:32] hear a man. I hear the voice of God.
[1:32:35] Y'all understand me?
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "Brother Brandon can't
[1:32:39] sing. He sang good to me."
[1:32:45] Yeah. Coming from the heart. That's
[1:32:47] right. Let me move on.
[1:32:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:55] &gt;&gt; Yeah. coming from the message deity of
[1:32:57] Jesus Christ 1949
[1:32:59] 1225
[1:33:02] you know you can't please people but I
[1:33:05] tell you I tell you one thing for
[1:33:06] certain
[1:33:08] &gt;&gt; you got to know him
[1:33:11] and he's got to know you
[1:33:14] was talking with a precious friend of
[1:33:16] mine from South Africa
[1:33:19] &gt;&gt; just the other day
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; and I said brother brother he's a pastor
[1:33:24] I said there's so many people in the
[1:33:26] message that that appears to have not
[1:33:28] the Holy Ghost.
[1:33:30] I said it just seem like there's just a
[1:33:33] system that got
[1:33:36] locked in.
[1:33:39] You can tell their behavior
[1:33:44] is not like God.
[1:33:46] You know, you know what I'm saying? And
[1:33:50] and I I was just telling him that and he
[1:33:52] said, "Brother," he said, "I find it
[1:33:54] here everywhere."
[1:33:57] &gt;&gt; He said, "Everybody thinking it's a
[1:33:59] shouting, a dance when we've been
[1:34:01] warned. We've been warned. We've been
[1:34:03] warned. That's not it.
[1:34:07] It's finding God in you. You got to come
[1:34:10] to know he's in you."
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. That's what he
[1:34:15] said. You'll know in that day. Not that
[1:34:17] you'll wonder. You'll know.
[1:34:22] Hallelujah.
[1:34:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:23] &gt;&gt; And there's so many. It's just like,
[1:34:25] Lord, help us.
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; You know, I love the worship. I know. I
[1:34:29] love the praise.
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; But but you know what has happened to
[1:34:34] the enthusiasm
[1:34:36] that people once had when it came to the
[1:34:38] message?
[1:34:41] Something's wrong. You don't have to say
[1:34:43] it, but something.
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; I'm telling you, something's wrong.
[1:34:50] Paragraph 134.
[1:34:53] &gt;&gt; Which way you're going this morning?
[1:34:56] &gt;&gt; What are you dreaming?
[1:35:00] &gt;&gt; I don't care which kind of group it
[1:35:02] likes.
[1:35:06] Each one of you, you're going to go into
[1:35:10] an eternity one these days.
[1:35:13] And without Christ, without the Holy
[1:35:16] Ghost,
[1:35:17] &gt;&gt; your soul is lost.
[1:35:20] Remember that
[1:35:22] &gt;&gt; you cannot meet that but only by
[1:35:25] accepting Christ
[1:35:30] by the Holy Spirit.
[1:35:33] If he is in you, he's the power of God.
[1:35:39] Live by it. He's God in you. The Bible
[1:35:43] says you become God. That's right.
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; Aren't ye all gods?
[1:35:50] &gt;&gt; And Jesus said, the Pharisees said, you
[1:35:52] make yourself god. Said, isn't it
[1:35:55] written in your law that ye are gods? He
[1:35:59] made Moses a god of Pharaoh.
[1:36:04] &gt;&gt; And he makes you a god to the people.
[1:36:06] That's right. You
[1:36:08] &gt;&gt; this morning are written epistles of
[1:36:11] God.
[1:36:12] Your lives are God's are all God's.
[1:36:16] And you must cherish
[1:36:19] [Music]
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; that Holy Ghost.
[1:36:23] &gt;&gt; Cherish it.
[1:36:27] Cherish it. It means you're not going to
[1:36:28] let the fire go out.
[1:36:32] Cherish it.
[1:36:40] Galatians 1 and I'm gonna let you go.
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; This is what Paul says
[1:36:54] 111 and 12.
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; But I certify you, brethren,
[1:37:00] &gt;&gt; that the gospel which was preached of me
[1:37:03] is not at the man
[1:37:06] This is Paul. It's not after man. This
[1:37:09] is not a man gospel. This is not Paul's
[1:37:12] gospel
[1:37:14] &gt;&gt; is what he's saying.
[1:37:18] &gt;&gt; Basically, we can say, "Well, it's
[1:37:20] Paul's gospel because it was God in
[1:37:21] him."
[1:37:23] But Paul couldn't come up with that.
[1:37:26] Let me tell y'all something. Brother
[1:37:28] Brandon could not have come up
[1:37:30] with the word like that.
[1:37:33] That was God in the man.
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; No man could have come through the
[1:37:39] scriptures like that.
[1:37:43] A seventh grade education. Come on.
[1:37:47] Hallelujah. And when brother Brandham
[1:37:49] didn't understand,
[1:37:51] who did he go to?
[1:37:54] He went to God in prayer.
[1:37:57] Hallelujah. When he didn't understand,
[1:38:01] Amen. the wheat and the tear.
[1:38:08] He the wheat and the tear. He didn't
[1:38:11] understand what he saw among the
[1:38:13] Pentecostals.
[1:38:15] One speaking in tongue and the other one
[1:38:17] interpreting.
[1:38:18] Hallelujah. One was a devil and the one
[1:38:21] was a saint.
[1:38:23] Hallelujah. And God took him to Hebrews
[1:38:25] 6.
[1:38:27] That was God. Hallelujah. Opening up his
[1:38:30] eyes.
[1:38:31] to what that was all about.
[1:38:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; People are I'm telling you
[1:38:49] &gt;&gt; for neither receive it of of man.
[1:38:54] &gt;&gt; In other words, nobody's school gave me
[1:38:56] this.
[1:38:57] Neither was I taught of it.
[1:39:01] But by the what? Revelation
[1:39:04] of Jesus Christ.
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; It was the Holy Ghost.
[1:39:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. That took Paul in the Arabian
[1:39:10] desert
[1:39:12] for three years or so and taught him the
[1:39:14] word.
[1:39:16] And when Paul came out of the desert,
[1:39:19] his revelation was greater than all the
[1:39:21] others.
[1:39:23] So much so Peter said, "The things that
[1:39:25] Paul write are sometimes hard to
[1:39:28] understand.
[1:39:30] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:39:31] &gt;&gt; Why? Because Paul was a prophet.
[1:39:34] &gt;&gt; We would have never known that had it
[1:39:37] not been for this message.
[1:39:39] &gt;&gt; Paul the apostle. But it's never written
[1:39:41] Paul the prophet.
[1:39:44] And the word of the Lord comes through
[1:39:45] the prophet.
[1:39:47] And Paul wrote almost the whole New
[1:39:49] Testament.
[1:39:51] Hallelujah.
[1:39:52] Y'all hear what I'm saying?
[1:40:03] Let me show you something.
[1:40:05] &gt;&gt; Come to me, brother. When he was in the
[1:40:09] vision,
[1:40:13] he said, "I want to see Jesus."
[1:40:16] &gt;&gt; And the angel said, "You can't.
[1:40:19] &gt;&gt; Not now because he's
[1:40:22] higher."
[1:40:25] &gt;&gt; Y'all understand me?
[1:40:29] So what are you saying?
[1:40:31] &gt;&gt; You know when people say Jes brother
[1:40:32] Adam is God.
[1:40:34] &gt;&gt; That ain't what he saw.
[1:40:38] &gt;&gt; That ain't what he saw.
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; He saw Jesus as God.
[1:40:42] &gt;&gt; And there's only one that sits on the
[1:40:44] throne.
[1:40:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; Y'all ready to go already?
[1:40:57] What about you, brother?
[1:41:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:08] &gt;&gt; You love the Lord.
[1:41:10] &gt;&gt; So, I'm almost done. Y'all know I always
[1:41:12] go to 9:00.
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; So, I got seven more minutes.
[1:41:19] &gt;&gt; Oh, Lord have mercy.
[1:41:22] You love the Lord.
[1:41:26] Brother, uh, here here Galatians 2:2,
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; he said, "I went up by revelation
[1:41:36] &gt;&gt; and communicated unto them that gospel
[1:41:38] which I preach among the Gentiles."
[1:41:43] And you got to understand, Paul had to
[1:41:45] move by revelation
[1:41:48] because there was nothing in the
[1:41:49] scripture
[1:41:51] telling him to go to the Gentiles.
[1:41:55] God spoke to him
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; and told him to kick off his shoes ever.
[1:42:01] &gt;&gt; Shut it down.
[1:42:03] &gt;&gt; I got you now going to the Gentiles.
[1:42:07] &gt;&gt; Revelation speaks.
[1:42:11] &gt;&gt; It speaks.
[1:42:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:15] &gt;&gt; You love the Lord.
[1:42:20] &gt;&gt; Last scripture.
[1:42:24] 1 Corinthians
[1:42:26] &gt;&gt; 16
[1:42:29] &gt;&gt; 22- 23.
[1:42:37] &gt;&gt; If any man love not the Lord Jesus
[1:42:40] Christ,
[1:42:42] let him be anathema there not.
[1:42:47] &gt;&gt; How many of y'all know what that means?
[1:42:50] It means let him be a curse.
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; You don't love the Lord Jesus, you are a
[1:43:00] curse.
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; And that word cannot be broken.
[1:43:10] &gt;&gt; It can't be broken.
[1:43:13] Let's stand.
[1:43:18] [Applause]
[1:43:38] I know God is God and he don't ever
[1:43:43] change. I know God is God and he don't
[1:43:49] I know God is God and he don't ever
[1:43:53] change and I don't remember the rest of
[1:43:55] it.
[1:43:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:03] Yes, that'll be good.
[1:44:08] Father God, we thank you. Let us bow a
[1:44:10] word of prayer. Our
[1:44:14] heavenly father, we come before you
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; as humbly as we know how.

[1:44:29] &gt;&gt; And father, I ask, oh God, that you
[1:44:32] continue to open your word,
[1:44:35] continue to give us understanding of who
[1:44:37] you are and who we are in you. that our
[1:44:41] revelation
[1:44:43] will be your revelation
[1:44:46] and our our understanding
[1:44:48] of you will be your understanding.
[1:44:51] Lord, help us that our mind be your mind
[1:44:53] and our thoughts be your thoughts.

[1:44:59] Jesus,
[1:45:01] Lord, let it be in us. Oh God, kill
[1:45:04] every demon, every devil, every spot of
[1:45:08] darkness that may lay in me.

[1:45:16] of the revelation
[1:45:18] of who you are. Cleanse us from all
[1:45:20] unrighteousness.
[1:45:22] Father God, we realize, oh God, he that
[1:45:25] cometh to God must first believe that he
[1:45:28] is God and that he is a reward of those
[1:45:32] that diligently seek him. Let us not
[1:45:35] stop seeking. Let us not stop looking
[1:45:38] and searching. Oh God, until we find
[1:45:42] what we're looking for and come into the
[1:45:44] complete revelation of who you are in
[1:45:48] us, bless us now in your name, Jesus
[1:45:51] Christ, we pray.
