TRANSCRIPT
========================================
e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e and and and and those things are not correct with the scriptures um a church family is a community of people that attend the same church that's how they Define it uh more than that a church family shares in the fullness of faith and life together Amen in other words I don't have uh a party or of a gathering even if you're not invited you should be invited you should be able to attend you should be able to come unless it's just a real private situation but we find out that people do things and they don't understand that they're being Prejudice when they do it because often time people love those who love them amen and many times they fail to see that even the unlovable if you want to say it maybe a Christian maybe feeble maybe whatever the case may be let's put it this way I admire people who have a son or a daughter with an Affliction but they love that child they're not ashamed of that child and when I see that I think about myself or I think about those who who God is now transforming and changing because in the eyes of God because of sin we all are afflicted amen I mean in a way we all came into this world y'all understand what I'm saying because we didn't come in with the nature of God now I'm saying all of this thing to get to my point I want you to understand that we fail to see children are children they can't behave like adults amen that's right they don't have the mind of an adult amen the way they think is the way children think amen um we understand by God's grace how a family can be so divided like for example we didn't know or we would not have known except by Revelation that Cain and a were of two different seed yet they were in the same family by the by the by the mother and I really it's never in the scripture where Adam and Eve treated Cain differently it was only when Cain slew AEL we saw the the the division of the family because God divided them then am he separated them and usually that's what happens you know when we came to Christ I I myself can say by the grace of God I'm the only one in this message God separated me from my family natural and then he gave me a a family of my own and I rais my family in the ammonition of the Lord they may not all be serving God at this time but I believe that every one of my children has been given to me by God Amen and at one day God will bring them to the Foe and so I said that to say this when we talk about unconditional love it is what God is requiring of us amen toward our families easy said than done no man can do it on his own only the Holy Spirit can take you to that level level of love now we people say well you know let's say this for example somebody offend you and you say okay I forgive them but I don't even want to see them no more no well that's not true you did not forgive them amen that's right because forgiveness also bring about restoration amen and when something is restored that means it comes back to its original position whether it be a brother whether it be a sister whether it be a cousin whatever it is amen uh when forgiveness is cuz that's what happens when God forgives us he brings us to the place to the to the proper place from which we fell in other words he doesn't bring us to a lesser place he he restores us to to the very level that we were at before we F fell so I'm saying all of this because when God came to Abel uh when God came to Caan's asked him you know where is Abel and that amazes me where is Abel thy brother and Cain responded with I know not am I My Brother's Keeper so with his question he answered the the he answered back to God the reason why God asked him because you are your brother's keeper amen we are even in this family of God we are each other's keeper the Bible said if you see your brother do something wrong you go to him in what love that you might do what restore him that's the way it works it didn't say go call Suzie which a lot of people do or scorn Suzy or get mad at Susie because I'm going to say it like this we all have come short of the glory of God Amen every one of us the battle today are not with flesh it's not flesh and blood that we're battling and I think often time as Christians we forget I forget you know what I'm saying somebody you know especially when it comes to children we look at children when they do wrong we want to we want to we want to drive that devil away but you know love conquers it love is greater than a rod it really is and often time we pass on traditions instead of seeking God on how to handle certain situations we ourselves become carnal that's right you understand and we understand by the grace of God and by this message we are to never spank children in our anger amen that's where that's where a lot of things come in uh un um unforeseen hurts now turn with me to Ephesians 6:12 we're about ready to get into our lesson now we understand by the grace of God education cannot we can't be educated into love matter of fact education is the thing that divides most families even in the time of of of when God uh put Cain out he went the educated way and I'm not wrong I'm not saying anything wrong with education but most times when people get educated they get puffed up Pride becomes their their lord and most people think that they're better than someone else because of education and you can look throughout Every Nation whether it be India whether it be Africa whether it be Europe whether it be it was always the rich the educated the knowledgeable ones and those little ones that didn't know anything and they could be family but the but the well- educated didn't want to fellowship with the ignorant see that that's what made Jesus different he went to the low class he went to the rejected he went into the uneducated people he fellowship with the people the priest and all of his clan wouldn't have nothing to do with amen and see you got to understand what family is because the Bible said Jesus seeketh those he went to seek his sheep and he could care less where they were most of his sheep in the beginning were poor they didn't have much they were uneducated you know I can't imagine what people thought when they saw Jesus and the 12 disciples he looked like a you know first of all he was homeless y'all know that right so that's how come Jesus can relate to the homeless people cuz he was homeless the Bible said foxes have holes uh uh birds have nests but the son of man have no place to lay his head so we understand by the grace of God the more educated or the more people think they are in that real it becomes a real danger zone for them God is Not doesn't wink at at at he he's not like against education because we have some the most like like like Daniel Brilliant Paul brilliant Luke brilliant just brilliant people educated people but they knew where the education was coming from and they understood they were nothing without God even Paul said with all of my learning I count this thing as D because I want to know Jesus Christ in the power in his suffering and in the power of his resurrection now Ephesians 612 goes on to say for we Ral not against flesh and blood but against principalities against power against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places and uh this is the thing that we must keep F we we keep our eyes focused because offenses will come you know I don't care how oh I love you I love you but offense is going to come offenses come between husband and wife offenses come between children and mother children and father I mean it's going to come the Bible said it's going to come so there's nothing that can stop it but God looks at our reaction to the offenses education can't do it matter of fact most of the time if we look at it it is the thing that that divides the people the knowledge right I'm saying all of this thing because a horse doesn't need to be educated on how to love its Pony a cow doesn't need how to be educated to learn to love his calf all of the animal kingdom birds birds will attack a human when it comes to their little chicken or whatever you want to say it right I've been running and and not even knowing I'm by birds and n and here they come trying to hit me in the head right Innocent but they have that nature that they would will they would take on almost The Impossible challenged to actually protect their children most mothers have that instinct most fathers have that instinct but not all yall understand what I'm saying and that is a natural response what about the spiritual because the spiritual response uh when it comes to the mother and the father has to be on a higher plane I'm learning myself and I'll be honest with you if I had to go back and teach my children over there's so many other things or new things that I see that I would teach teach them but it would be based upon love mercy and Grace amen because that's how God is teaching me right now coming from the message things that are to be paragraph 55 now in the world that we live in this education I want to prove to you education science civilization and all these things that we seemingly so enjoyed today is of Satan why are you bringing this brother because often time we go to science to help us in our spiritual man when all we need is God we do we think science can help us but in reality it's like taking a pill that's going to make things worse in the long run and I say that because amen I know I know I'm I'm working with Spirits now I'm not natural I'm not carnal I'm working with spiritual because every problem in the in the in the way of a man or woman is spiritual amen call it whatever you want to but every demon that torments is a devil physically spiritually mentally however want to say it and the cure to all of this is divine love amen love conquers all whether it be in you or outside of You Love Will Conquer All right now all these things Satan he says listen and all these things that we seemingly to enjoy today is of Satan and will perish you say brother brother brandham civilization yes sir civilization comes by Satan Genesis 4 proves it kon's son see started the civilization building cities and organs and so forth and civilization came by what knowledge knowledge is what the devil sold Eve in the Garden of Eden that causes her to cramp uh transgress God's Commandments and I think about people who are in places right now that don't even know their right hand from their left they may be tribal people but they love each other amen they will face uh lions or whatever the case may be to protect their families and we with education you know what we'll do we'll judge it and run yeah but I find out it was one of the things that I learned when I went to India at night went to find those people who were really in need instead of working with because in India they have people out there on the streets that fakes it but we went to see and then we were passing out some candy and stuff and those little boys that we had given something to they ran I didn't know where they were running to I just thought they were happy that they had candy next thing I know we was about almost about ready to be Stampede they went and got their buddies their family to me that touched me than more than anything you know because it's like me if or you especially in America you you win a jackpot you know you going to keep it Hush Hush you don't want nobody know that you done won the lottery or whatever the case may be but not those people see all they had they had such a love and that thing was to survive and they went and ran and got their friends I don't know how close of a relatives they were to each other but I knew one thing they came together as one amen with the hands out it was a blessing to me I was thinking to myself who is the rich man right so I'm coming to you one thing I can truly say about my mother nobody in my family could ever say that my mother did not love them now they didn't treat her right they didn't respect her they didn't honor her but she had the ability to give her children love and we were poor and to this day I believe because and now don't get me wrong my mother was a Christian so she had something to give us and that was Christ children obey your parents that's the first verse of this uh lesson tonight children obey your parent in the Lord for this is right but we know that in science or in education children have a right not to obey their parents that's right but when it comes to God that's the right thing to do if a child and I God is my witness I stand my mother thought I sat at her one time and I was just correcting her I didn't realize that was sassing she slapped me and and it wasn't a slap that hurt me it was the fact that she thought I was talking back to her I think to talk back to your mother as a child is so disrespectful to God as well as to your parent it is something that I know that once the Holy Ghost feels a child they don't do that and if they would ever let it slip they immediately make it right oh I'm sorry Mom I'm sorry Dad right cuz though in my day we had such a law and a rule that was a fearful thing there is no way that you're going to talk back to your mom and dad without your mom and dad coming after you that was the way it was so most children in my day was afraid to talk back or respond to their parents in a diff in a disrespectful way and my mother used to say which is which is so true say when a child is disobedient and disrespect their parents you shorten your days on Earth God Cuts your day short that is the truth honor thy father and thy mother now you got to understand what I'm saying we don't wrestle against flesh and blood it's spiritual wickedness in high places principalities and Powers because your father and your mother is maybe not what you want them to be I've had a father that didn't do much for me but I loved my father I always honored him and I never disrespected him no matter how bad he was he was a drunkard to be honest with you and uh but I always gave him respect now my other siblings they did not y'all understand what I'm saying I'm saying the power of the Holy Ghost will change you amen that's the only one that's the only only uh uh God is the only one that can put you in your right position honor thy father and thy mother because listen if you don't honor your father and your mother you're not going to honor nobody else if you disrespect your mother and your father you're going to disrespect everybody else that's why you see children when they bad in school they bad at home when you can't rule them in school they because they unruly at home that's the way it works right honor thy father mother which is the first commandment with promise because the Lord said if you honor your mother and your father your days will be long amen now we understand that I'm I'm working on the children now but I'm coming to the parents in in a moment because we as parents and I have been guilty in my life we provoke our children by the way we do things or by the way we say things you don't and sometimes I know we we we judge by sight we accuse them of things that they're not guilty of then all of a sudden there's a problem everybody does it or everybody have done it the Bible said that it may be well with thee and that thou may live long on the earth I had people in my class who I I I assume because they were so bad out in the world I assume they were in other words they died early May 20 21 22 died young doing bad things and most of the time when when you people get caught doing bad things is because they never take took heed to the warning of their mother and their father and ye father provoke not your children to wrath and this is what I've learned in my in my uh in my time of living on the earth we were always told well Daddy why should I do that because I told you I I'm telling you to do it but that's not right it's not because you you need to explain to me why I'm doing this or why you want me to do this I mean you just don't use up Authority like you can do it but what does that do it provokes a child to Wrath because they don't understand why you telling because in their minds they think they may even think it's silly to do it you understand what I'm saying they may not understand what you're doing so when you just use Authority like that we call it nowadays bullying but that's that was not the intent the intent was Direction and guidance don't go that way because cause right you learn to express and explains to Children why you telling them because if if you do this this will harm you if you don't turn from this direction it's going to it's going to it's going to really put you in a bad position or you know I'll put it this way there were times my mother would see friends of mine I call friends and she said Junior those people are not your friends but because I was in my teenage years I'm grown you know that's the way we think I mean and we don't realize we're not grown till you get older you realize oh my God I thought I knew it I no you don't you just think you know it that's your hormones thinking you think making you think that way and but I'm going tell you my mother was right and down the road because I wouldn't let those friends go down the road who gets hurt me and those people proved to me they were not my friend so parents have Insight they have experience and therefore that's why you supposed to respect them because they have more experience they have lived longer they've been into through all kinds of stuff St stuff that you haven't gone through matter of fact my wife and I we could join together in un Unity because we taught our children we tried to keep them away from the harmful things but because they didn't listen they have been entrapped many of them them but it's not our fault the reason why I said it like this because they never honored us as father and mother amen that's right because when you honor somebody as father and mother you don't necessarily understand why but you are obedient that's how it is with God you you are obedient because you know they know what they're talking about right is this okay any questions okay yes it it's leaning to your own understanding basically he wants you to be obedient and not take another way because you think it's going to please him remember what Saul did God told Saul to kill everything and Saul within himself thought by the influence of the people if I saved the king and most and the best of the animals God would be pleased no God is not pleased with your sacrifice he's only pleased with obedience obeying his word matter of fact he said when you do that when you know that word and you go beyond that intentionally that stubbornness and that stubbornness is as witchcraft in the Eyes Of God it's a serious offense it's like anything we do when God say don't do it I'm not I'm going to do it anyway with that stubbornness then God looks at you as you as though you have been influenced by witchcraft you are Bewitched because a foolish person is going to do that kind of a thing right A wise man going to keep his Commandments a foolish person will lean to their own understanding God knows God understand that kind of a thing children do that we all do it I remember one time and I I don't want to take up too much time I got to move forward but I remember one time I had a friend who who got my mom told me not to hang out with he cored me to go to the movies we went to the movies it was Daylight we went and saw the whole movie when we came out it was p pitch black dark and I knew back in the day we didn't have cell phones so you know parents were worried and you know all I could think about is when I get home what kind of lie I can tell I was scared now I was scared cuz I knew I was going to get a whipping she told me not to do it the thing is that the guy that got me into trouble didn't get the whipping or punishment I got in trouble right and every lie I tried to tell she says no we've been there already so there was no way for me to get out of it but I would have never gone that way I never would have had to do that because that individual was like the devil to me you know what I mean though he was a friend he was telling me to go opposite to what my mom said anybody that teaches you to go opposite to your parents and you know your parents is telling you the truth is not a friend it's not a friend it's the enemy using that person and when you go contrary who going to be hurt you and that's so true your friends will get you in trouble but they can't get you out that's the way it works that's what happened to me I learn obedience through the things I suffered I'm just going to right and ye fathers provoke not your children to wrath but bring them up in the nurture and ammonition of the Lord you know what nurturing is it means little by little you know you don't stuffing with this and stuffing with that you you nurturing is like you you handling things with care you know your counseling is with care your counseling you know is not all rude and you know abrupt you know forceful it's it's nurturing little it's like when you nurture a plant or an animal you give a little milk at a time and and and that's the way it's supposed to be with your children um like I said I can say this because I can look back and see where I fail in these areas but now that I see I can tell people listen if we don't learn how to love our children we can't even love ourselves and most of the time when we don't love ourselves we can't love our children and all of us at some point in time will be parents if the Lord should carry and one thing I know that even in the animal kingdom they'll give their life for their sibling or for their their offspring that's what we do that's even in the animal so what about the spiritual right this is what I love about God that prodal son was as bad as he can be the Bible said he went off and he got came to himself he's getting ready to eat the slop pig slop he's already laying out there with him but he came to himself and he said to himself you know I got a father my father is rich I don't know whether he will accept me back as a son but I I'll present myself to him as a servant and the Bible said when that prodal son turned to come back home the father was waiting and the father saw him coming and ran to him I love that song that's that's the only time I seen him run and he ran to that prodal son and and the prodical son was telling him Lord I be a servant I'll be and God and and and the father says you can't be a servant because you're a son and and he says go go prepare about the Fatt C whatever we're going to have a banquet slip that rang on his finger what happened he was restored amen back to his position in which he was supposed to be cuz he never was he was always a son even if he was eating pig slop but you know the TR truth of the matter is is when we see people in the family of God and they go backslide you know when they come back you don't see that welome welcoming but it should be that love should be oh I'm so glad you overcame I'm so glad you came back let's help you get back to your position let's celebrate y y'all know what I mean we don't do that but as a family this is where it should be our love should be I don't care what you did out there it's is in the past now let's go forward you a son you a daughter of God love on each other that's what family is all about and Jesus proved it Peter denied him three times cursed while he was doing it that's right but Jesus says I can't go any further that's my son amen that's one of mine and before we go any further y'all make sure y'all bring Peter you understand me and that's where it should be we should never say oh they get over it or you know just let somebody walk out the door and not even think about them not even call them not even go after them that's family people people are family living for others as I said the other other service we must learn how to live for others amen and we all the only way that would help us we we need to learn how to put ourselves in other people's position that could have been me amen when you can stablish that kind of thought in your mind then you have the compassion that you need to have one for another fathers don't provoke them and I've done it in the past you know I'm the kind of person you know I rarely when I when I get angry I'm angry it's slow to angry but I once I get there it's kind of hard to pull me back out of that realm uh one thing I hate is disrespect from a child I don't care who you are and I think God feels the same way he doesn't like disrespect and the first thing I think about when someone disrespect me is what did I do to deserve this dishonor and my thoughts is hav not been this hav not been that hav not been but you see that's man that that's not the way I should be doing it that's not the way it should be done why should I care they called him a devil they sped on him he said nothing and I think sometimes we we we live too much we got too much flesh amen and our pride Rises up and then that gets us in trouble because you ain't talking to me like that who do you think you are you know that's the way we do and the next thing you know I'm coming at you but that's what we do but that's not the proper way we wrestle not against flesh and blood when you see a person acting in the wrong way you must recognize this is spiritual and if I don't handle it in a spiritual way it's going to get bad somebody's going to get hurt words could be said that cannot be taken back and that's what we this is where Satan comes in to divide education can't do that I don't care what psychiatrist you go through they can give you some reasoning and both most of the time they're going to tell you what you already know because you done told them the problem in the beginning and they're going to just reord it to make it sound like they telling you something that you didn't tell them but you told them that when you first they said what what's your problem and then you spew everything out and then they reroute that thing and come back and tell you the same thing you said and then they going to give you some kind of Solution that's not going to work because the psychiatrist go to psychiatrist themselves for help amen that's right and the only M mind regulator is Jesus amen hallelujah because I'm going to tell you what a psychi is going to do they're going to take you all the way in your path and bring up all those hurts and then they when that all those hurts come up then you going to remember all it's like a nightmare amen that's right it's a nightmare nightmare amen and I'm going to say it like this by the grace of God if it's buried keep it there amen cuz I'm G tell you something I've done it the best times I the the person I've he's my psychiatrist and I could tell him about my hurt and he's the only one that I have been able to tell him everything and then get off my knees with a piece at heart amen and a peace at mind Hallelujah I'm telling you that's the way it works and you got to understand that like we said he'll be to you whatever you let him be that's true that is the truth right [Laughter] brother yes sir you know I just wonder you know how we treat people is a lot of yes Amen brother sister different when here praising God if they fall there right did y'all hear him can you can you stand up and repeat that pardon can you stand and repeat that and face them oh all what thinking our relation Brothers ands onily and that's true that's true because I've had people say well when I was at church you didn't care to talk to me right so they want to know why you want to talk to me now because they thinking you just want to talk gossip I I mean they don't trust you because when I was there you didn't help me you didn't talk to me you didn't see me you didn't love me then so what make me what why would you think I I'm going to believe that you love me now see so that that is exactly how it works you know and that's why it's so important that listen you can't I I always say this in order to have friends you got to show yourself friendly amen and you got to you got to reach out to people and some people because of their hurts and past experiences they're not so open to you but you don't stop there you got to keep moving and keep doing it so they can see that you have a personal interest and it's not something that you want from them to gain something but because you care you'll be surprised with a little card sister so and so I was thinking about you when I was in The Hobby and I got you this card or brother and you'd be surprised well I've noticed that I don't see many people talking with you but I want you to know that I care just things like that that's family now we'll do it to each other at times like you know different holidays or I'm thinking of you that kind of a thing but I think when it comes to the church family we need to do more of it amen more of it now let me move on listen in the fifth chapter fifth verse it says that's really good brother Rich that's really really good on a daily basis we need to learn how to reach out to one another servants be obedient to them that are your Masters according to the father flesh now I want to use this word servant because we know in America and a lot of places they use that word as a slave but you see in the Old Testament it's the kind of slave many of the colonizers used they went and they stole people that was evil that was wrong now when it comes to the Hebrew servant or slave is because they owed a debt and so because they owed a debt that was the way they had to pay it and then at the sound of the Jubilee they were free to go y'all understand me but when it comes to the old when it comes to the Old Testament Look up the word if you want to go look it up called men Steelers stealing a man that's how it says that's evil that's wrong right this is not the kind of servant he's talking about this is not the kind of slave he's talking about he's talking about a servant who owes a debt know he owes the debt and he needs to pay for it servant be obedient to them that are of your Masters but that scripture was twisted to to how could I say it to to to to fortify their narrative but that's not what it was supposed to be maybe one day I I'll do a little subject on that but that's that's the way it was it wasn't talking about the kind of slave that was stolen talking about the slave that owe the debt and throughout the New Testament you'll find that in the gospel those who owed debt and had to pay right not not about men Stealers people who stole men made them slaves that's a different story altogether God really frowned on that servants be obedient to them that are your Masters according to the flesh with fear and trembling singleness of your heart as unto Christ not with I service y'all know what I service is when somebody tell you something I can't you can't see your smile and then you roll your [Laughter] eyes or you give them that look you know your eyes talk that's our service you can even say tell somebody who you think you talking to [Laughter] that's that's all wrong not with our service as men Pleasers but as the servant of Christ doing the will of God from the heart don't don't don't don't uh get frustrated when when it let's put it this way even in your job when your when he's your Master you're a servant on the job your boss man is your master and you supposed to serve him as you would unto Christ yeah why he going to ask me to take out the trash ain't nobody else doing nothing look at them but he going to come ask me well God anointed him to ask you you're the one that needs character see what I'm saying he's building you to the character is building you and so you got to say okay because listen when you know God is giving you a job you got to do it as unto the Lord amen not to the man that's over you or the woman that's over you as unto the Lord right with Good Will doing Service as to the Lord and not to men knowing that whatsoever good thing any man doeth the same shall he receive of the Lord whether it be Bond or free and you can take that all the way down through the Old Testament through the Hebrew children everybody that obeyed even even they were men Stealers but even when they were in bondage to Babylon those Hebrew boys Daniel and all they served their masters as unto the Lord amen right but their masters weren't beating him and doing all that kind of stuff y'all understand me it's it's a totally different uh mindset that went on in our world today all is of the devil amen there's nobody to blame all is of the devil and the devil had to do whatever he had to do to bring this Kingdom to where he wants it to be but now you are the Bride of Jesus Christ Hallelujah and you and I must learn how to be obedient to God Amen not to men amen Lord I'm going to do because you want me you know once you build that then all it becomes automatic right it becomes automatic knowing you know that God is God is going to reward you anyway and ye Masters do the same thing unto them for bearing threatenings excuse me and ye Master do the same thing unto them for bearing threatenings knowing that your master also in heaven neither is their respective person with him right so understand even if you a boss you got to also be a kind of boss as God would be you can't just you know just have your own Constitution feeling like you can do whatever you want to do you got to everything we do children parents unto the Lord we must serve each other as unto the Lord amen we must work together as unto the Lord we must love each other as unto the Lord we must protect and this is what I love we must protect I remember when we we was a we were in the apostolic church and one of my sons was playing in the backyard and there's a little neighbor child out there he lik to run up and bite the kids when he ran and he he had his teeth into my my boy back or arm or whatever it was and and and gab was Gabriel I think it was was screaming the only way my wife could get that boy off was a smack him and then Daddy and Mama going to come out there I'm telling them myself I got more character now but back in that day they saw I wasn't afraid of them and we were getting ready it was going to be a real bad situation but my point is we were protecting ours and they knew we could get we could go deeper with this and have them arrested pretty much for letting that boy run and bite people cuz he was he was he was it was a common thing and they want to protect him and we weren't going to stand for that y'all understand me there are times that you have to stand for what you know it's right am and even though it is in a a way of a conflict you're going to have to to stand and not cow down God is always with you now as long as you're right amen finally my brother do what be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might right here what he says first John you don't have to go there I'm almost done 1 John 10-12 in this the children of God are manifest and the children of the devil whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God neither he that loveth not his brother for in this for this is the message that you heard from the beginning that we should love one another it goes all the way back because if we love one another we respect one another if we love one another we will honor one another if we love one another we would protect one another if we love one another we'll fellowship with one another amen and you know what I'm saying there's nothing like family fellowship and even so when we have a church family fellowship that's good too because then you get a chance to meet or talk to people that you normally wouldn't talk to now I know some people have clicks but you should break that your love should go beyond clicks you understand me your love don't don't oh they in a click no go over there and become part of the click y'all know what I'm saying let them understand I'm your brother I'm your sister too easier said than done but your love for people because you know people are in bondage when they in clicks they're in bondage when they feel like their little group is better than another group that's wrong absolutely wrong dividing vision is of the devil God is calling everybody to Unity and you have to fight to keep it you love the Lord now listen I kind of if there be any questions any questions I thought what brother brother uh rich said was brilliant was wonderful what we do on a regular basis will also reflect down the road when someone else is in fall short Fall Away whatever the case may be and as a pastor I I don't know a lot of stuff but church people know everything and I think by the grace of God y'all should work in the capacity of loving one another and bringing people back to Christ instead of letting them float out the door find out what the issues are what the problem is and if those things can be resolved there your flesh they're your blood they're your people they're your family and you have to remember their family and not people that comes to the church am I making sense let's stand we'll finish up on this next week Lord's will uh putting on the whole arm of God that's a big subject but um you know I just say by the grace of God I've learned so much and I've seen a lot and you know I look at people and the reason why children are the way they are now is because they didn't get the proper teaching and the proper discipline and our schools our government our science has made them such because they get our kids more time than we they have more time with our children in school than we have so they can indoctrinate them into all kinds of stuff that we know is wrong and you know every cartoon you watch ain't good that's right I remember when the rug rats what they guess what the rug rats those bad kids they look like a nightmare they did but everybody was crazy about it but they didn't realize they would teach those things were teaching their children how to be bad yeah cuz you know we imitate everything thing everything Hollywood brings out people do it no matter how vile it may be they'll do it and so everything you got to watch with your children watch you can't just let them be to themselves if you're going to really nurture them that means you got to watch and pray and do whatever you can do to keep them in the straight in their way because if you don't they going to come up just like the worldly kids disobeying you and that's going to put you in a position cuz now you're going to have to find out a way to reach them don't give the world your children cuz once you give it to them give them to the world it's hard to get them back let's pray father God we thank you for your grace and your mercy we thank you for being so good to us Lord we ask oh God that you would have mercy upon us give us what we stand in need of cleanse us Lord God from all of our uh unbelief all of our Darkness anything in US Lord that isn't pleasing Lord we're pressing toward the mark of a high calling we're we're moving in that space of divine love we want it father we want it to fill us completely from head to toe every fiber of our being Let Your Love radiate from us Lord give us the grace and in this day have mercy upon us and give us the grace and the mercy to escape the raft that is to come place in our hearts oh God that Spirit of crying and sighing for the Abomination done in the city be merciful to us now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e
