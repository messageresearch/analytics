[24:34] you this afternoon Lord God for the
[24:37] soldiers the pillars of truth in this
[24:40] church thank you for the soldiers of God
[24:43] who held up the blood-stained banner
[24:45] Lord not worrying about popularity but
[24:48] keeping a place where the word could go
[24:51] forth unhindered Lord we thank you this
[24:54] evening bless us O Lord as we oh God
[24:57] break forth your words speak to us O God
[25:00] from the realms of heaven and bless us O
[25:03] God and just give us what we stand in
[25:06] need of we'll be careful to give you no
[25:08] glory and all the praise in Jesus name
[25:12] that the church say man amen god bless
[25:16] you amen so good to be back amen and we
[25:19] just want to amen get in the word just a
[25:21] little bit more amen are you still
[25:23] hungry
[25:24] amen do you believe that God can speak
[25:26] to us just a little more from the words
[25:29] of eternity amen and so we want to look
[25:32] in first Corinthians 15 amen if you
[25:35] would just move there for a moment first
[25:38] Corinthians 15 there are three verses I
[25:43] want to read there and then we'll read
[25:44] from Genesis chapter one amen but first
[25:48] Corinthians 15 and there I want to read
[25:55] three verses out of first Corinthians 15
[25:57] and then we read Genesis 1:26 amen
[26:02] so gymnast first Princeton's 15 verse 47
[26:08] through 49 is what I want to read it
[26:11] says the first man is of the earth
[26:14] earthly the second man is the Lord from
[26:18] heaven as is the earthy such are they
[26:23] also that are earthy and as is the
[26:26] heavenly such are they also that are
[26:30] heavenly
[26:31] what is our promise as we and as we have
[26:37] borne the image of the earthly
[26:40] we shall also bear the image of the
[26:45] heavenly do you believe that hallelujah
[26:48] amen one we can testify of and so the
[26:52] second one you've testified of amen
[26:54] and it shall be even as you have
[26:57] testified Genesis chapter 1 and I'm just
[27:01] gonna read three verses there twenty-six
[27:05] three verses 26 through 28 and it reason
[27:09] God said let us make man in our image
[27:10] after our likeness and let them have
[27:14] dominion over the fish of the sea over
[27:16] the fowl of the air and over the cattle
[27:19] and over all the earth and over every
[27:22] creeping thing that creepeth upon the
[27:24] earth so God created man in his own
[27:27] image in the image of God created he him
[27:31] male and female created he them and God
[27:38] blessed them and God said unto them be
[27:42] fruitful and multiply and replenish the
[27:45] earth and subdue it and have dominion
[27:51] over the fish of the sea oh the fowl of
[27:56] the air and over some all right I just
[28:03] want make sure you reading and over
[28:06] every living thing that moveth upon the
[28:10] earth may the Lord bless his reading of
[28:13] the word a man you may be seated
[28:15] amen amen so so not this evening I'm
[28:21] just want to share a few words here now
[28:24] amen I want to last through the last
[28:27] savory moments of this amen
[28:30] so be kind of just a little teaching
[28:32] maybe like a little Sunday School lesson
[28:34] just some things we already know amen
[28:36] but we'll just do some checks and
[28:37] balances that's okay amen amen and so I
[28:41] want to talk about rebuilding the
[28:43] Christian image that's my message this
[28:47] afternoon is rebuilding the Christian
[28:50] image amen
[28:54] and so in looking at this you know there
[28:58] was a term I think I'm just thinking as
[29:02] far as I know he and research Andre
[29:04] Agassi I guess is the one that coined
[29:07] the term image is everything and so
[29:10] that's how we want to look at the text
[29:15] of this message that image is everything
[29:18] and we know God Amen uses types and
[29:23] shadows and so many times when you can't
[29:27] see the real you need to take a look
[29:30] closer at the shadow and sometimes you
[29:32] you know you just need them both there
[29:34] amen and so that's what we want to look
[29:38] at there that God wants us to see his
[29:43] image Amen now a mental picture of
[29:49] something Amen that may not be present
[29:52] sometimes and so you can't make it out
[29:55] and so but God will put a shadow there
[29:57] sometime so you can kind of get some
[29:59] idea what it might look like amen so if
[30:02] I could say it like this it verse 26 it
[30:08] would be like God saying I want to show
[30:10] you what a man and a woman should look
[30:13] like when they come on earth amen now
[30:18] he's not weak amen but he's powerful
[30:22] amen
[30:24] so the tension here is there's a big
[30:27] difference in a shadow and the real
[30:29] thing in the natural the shadow isn't
[30:32] the real thing because it's getting its
[30:35] shape from the real thing amen
[30:40] but in the spiritual amen it goes just
[30:43] in Reverse the real thing is getting
[30:45] this shape from the shadow in the
[30:49] spiritual God uses shadows to tell what
[30:53] the real thing will look like now we
[30:56] know no man have ever seen God there's
[30:58] the logos there amen but before the
[31:01] logos there was Elohim so you couldn't
[31:04] see him you can't see it don't need and
[31:06] try a
[31:08] in but when God amen ello him amen when
[31:11] he spoke that word there had to be
[31:14] something that could cover it and then
[31:15] you get some idea Amen of what God
[31:18] wanted but still then as a low cost is
[31:21] just a fire maybe just a liquify and
[31:24] maybe something there but there's
[31:26] something on the inside of that fire so
[31:30] it's still God all along amen but he's
[31:33] blowing that thought into a fire and
[31:39] then all of a sudden that fire he blew
[31:42] that likho fire down into a baby now
[31:48] that just confuses everyone that Elohim
[31:52] God a man that became logos at this
[31:55] liquefier and course the people wouldn't
[31:57] they wouldn't go with that
[31:59] it wasn't satisfied so God blew that
[32:02] liquify into a little baby and it's sure
[32:07] that these group of people that lost
[32:09] their mind because they went to worship
[32:12] the king at the birth they didn't wait
[32:15] for the King to be the key they knew it
[32:18] was the king all along and they went to
[32:20] worship Him in that amazing thing so see
[32:23] you need the image you need the shadows
[32:26] you need the types because the real
[32:28] thing when it comes it can be so simple
[32:30] you remember what the pastor said
[32:32] Wednesday night god help us to have
[32:34] simple mind because God is so great and
[32:39] so powerful he has to do it that way
[32:41] because we are really simply we're not
[32:43] intellectual a man I got a big word in
[32:47] here and I had to write it in a way that
[32:52] I maybe be able to spell now I probably
[32:54] still mess it up when I get to Amy but
[32:57] we're simple-minded and God is simple
[33:01] amen
[33:03] all right and so that's what God does
[33:05] jesus said in Saint John 531 if I bear
[33:07] witness of myself my witness is not true
[33:11] so even standing there looking at Jesus
[33:13] said don't look at me in that something
[33:16] oh my I want to move from that there is
[33:18] another that bears witness of me
[33:21] and I know that the witness would she
[33:24] witness of me is true you said John he
[33:28] bad witness to the truth so they could
[33:29] receive John he said but I received not
[33:31] the testimony from man this st. John
[33:33] five and 34 but these things I say that
[33:36] you might be saved he was a burning and
[33:39] shining light and you were willing for a
[33:41] season to rejoice in his light but I
[33:44] have greater witness than that of John
[33:46] for the works which the father has given
[33:49] me to finish the same works that I do
[33:52] bear witness of me now he's moving it
[33:54] from John he's moving it from himself
[33:56] and now he's pushed it all into works
[33:58] but it's God I'm alone it's still
[34:01] guarding and lo Goss is still God to
[34:03] Pillar fire still God and a baby now God
[34:05] is talking to them as a man and telling
[34:08] them there's John that's God's also
[34:10] that's my witness but John testified
[34:12] there's one coming that's greater than I
[34:15] oh my god aren't you glad you can still
[34:21] see him hey man so he says here Amen now
[34:25] watch the image coming on down have
[34:27] greater witness than that of John for
[34:29] the works a me and the father gave me
[34:31] then he moves on verse 37 the father
[34:34] himself which has sent me has borne
[34:38] witness of me and his quoted as saying
[34:42] you have neither heard his voice at any
[34:45] time nor seen his shape in that a
[34:49] mind-boggling thing Amen now now this
[34:52] look at this
[34:52] Jesus was projecting his father's voice
[34:56] and his shape but they couldn't possibly
[35:00] accept both of those at the same time
[35:03] now we know that's the truth that's what
[35:05] the problem you know is well where are
[35:07] you from but isn't it a comp in the Sun
[35:10] oh I mean we see people want to say that
[35:13] when God comes they want to I know his
[35:15] family you know how to you know in that
[35:19] this boy raised right among us I mean
[35:22] you know and and we know all the things
[35:24] they had to say about that birth and you
[35:27] know people don't say anything but they
[35:29] still haven't any mind you know Mary we
[35:32] don't know all that birth matter maybe
[35:35] supernatural you know how God does God
[35:37] is such an author he's such a great
[35:40] story t now you just think back when
[35:42] Mayer had this powerful testimony of
[35:44] that God was a he manuals gonna be born
[35:48] through her she hadn't been with
[35:49] Josephine we all kind of you know you
[35:52] know how people are they say oh yeah I
[35:53] believe it and they kind of don't
[35:55] believe it
[35:56] and then God makes the story more
[35:58] dramatic a man instead of Mary staying
[36:00] in town their God allowed marriage to
[36:03] leave town and go over to Lisbon house
[36:06] don't you know that made it more
[36:07] mysterious but it was still God right
[36:10] alone it made people think oh my
[36:13] goodness now here she goes over there to
[36:15] Lisbon house and they're over there out
[36:17] of town and Joseph over here in town
[36:19] looks like she should have stayed right
[36:21] there but you can't make people believe
[36:23] the word God have to make them believe
[36:26] it but that made it more unbelievable
[36:29] she's over there in another town and
[36:32] then not only she comes back pregnant
[36:34] Elizabeth's pregnant Liz was too old to
[36:37] be praying but she's pregnant all the
[36:39] same cuz God said she would have a son
[36:41] oh my god you just have to believe amen
[36:49] so here's Jesus saying here amen you've
[36:51] never seen his voice not seen the shape
[36:53] but how amazing this scene was that we
[36:57] had 100% of the shadow there and 100% of
[37:03] the real there at the same time oh how
[37:08] beautiful that was 100% of the shadow
[37:11] and 100% of the real thing 100% of
[37:15] Elohim 100% of logos and 100% human oh
[37:24] my god can you see the image do you see
[37:28] that that doesn't throw you off does it
[37:31] oh my amen amen see you know how it is
[37:34] when they you know they make the mirror
[37:36] and they make those you know we got to
[37:38] keep moving into this and believing it
[37:41] until we can see 100% his reflection
[37:46] through us
[37:47] Oh
[37:51] do you love him a man a man all right
[37:54] sold in now see uh uh the father's image
[38:01] is there and the Sun image is there all
[38:05] at the same time what a new beginning
[38:09] and that's why they say what manner of
[38:11] man what what kind of man is this I mean
[38:14] what not I mean even the season The Wiz
[38:17] what kind of man and that's what people
[38:22] ought to be saying what kind of person
[38:24] is this all these winds and storms and
[38:27] tornadoes can come in this city you can
[38:29] take a picture of the storm coming to
[38:31] the city but somewhere there's 100% God
[38:35] and 100% man that speaks to the storm
[38:39] and says go back and the storm turns and
[38:43] go back how many believe that God is
[38:46] still the same you can still do the same
[38:49] thing
[38:49] amen don't you worry God will have
[38:51] someone that believed that amen
[38:54] all right and so now let's move a little
[38:56] further so that's the challenge and
[38:58] that's what we're presenting you are in
[38:59] Christ image don't worry about it you
[39:03] know I you know for 27 years I've I've
[39:06] never believed in being a preacher that
[39:08] takes something from people I always
[39:11] believed in giving them something and I
[39:14] don't want you I don't I don't want to
[39:17] cuz you know if if you can't take it
[39:20] from people anyway if people don't want
[39:23] you to get it they're not they're not
[39:25] giving you trying to take something from
[39:27] people if they want to hold on to that
[39:29] spirit they'll hold right to it
[39:31] how many know what I'm talking about yes
[39:34] they have to want to get rid of it amen
[39:37] and so I love you know our brother amen
[39:40] brother Keith I was talking about and I
[39:42] couldn't remember whether it was a lamp
[39:44] or vacuum cleaner
[39:45] amen amen that we talked about you know
[39:47] you have a good product you know you got
[39:49] a good product you know you're trying to
[39:51] sell it and you tell their customer why
[39:55] don't you just take this and take it off
[39:57] see if it's a good product give it to
[39:59] him let them
[40:00] take it on in the house and we were
[40:02] talking about you know that they're
[40:04] there you know they make maybe it's a
[40:05] lamp you're trying to sell them a lap
[40:06] they got the lamp it's in the lamp in
[40:09] the house and you know he can cut a
[40:10] regular light on but the salesman said
[40:12] no this lamp shines a little brighter
[40:15] and your natives flip it on they say
[40:17] well honey tonight we're gonna use this
[40:19] lamp see just get it in the house do you
[40:23] follow me just get to get the lamp in
[40:25] that give it to him don't say well my
[40:27] light is better than yours and then cut
[40:30] all your lights off and then I'll know
[40:32] don't do that just give them your light
[40:34] let them let it be in the house with
[40:36] them and they're sitting in the house
[40:37] hmm well honey I think let's cut this
[40:40] light on and before you know it
[40:41] cut that light on well gracious it is a
[40:44] little brighter and an old husband say
[40:49] no oh I'll put these lights in here cut
[40:51] this light on next night to sitting at
[40:55] dinner no the wife says honey let's cut
[40:57] this light on and before you know it
[40:59] they flipping it and fine then the
[41:02] husband say you know what and light is
[41:04] brighter that's how you do it hey man
[41:08] just that simple
[41:09] amen and so I don't believe in taking
[41:12] things from people I want to give them
[41:14] something tonight I want you to
[41:16] recognize that you've got a whole lot
[41:18] more than the devil is trying to tell
[41:20] you that you don't have all that God has
[41:24] done for us
[41:25] amen your fingernail could cast out a
[41:29] devil how many know the Bible says Jesus
[41:33] cast he could cast the devil out with
[41:35] his finger no not all this oh wrestling
[41:40] you know no just cast him out how many
[41:43] believe that Amy you do have that power
[41:46] you do have it all right so let's move
[41:48] so I want to leave with you tonight this
[41:51] evening that you have more than you
[41:54] using you just have to see the
[41:56] reflection amen you know the story you
[42:00] know in the mirror well you move out of
[42:03] the mirror and you stand in the mirror
[42:04] well I think oh that's me yeah and
[42:08] people still do that you know they come
[42:10] to church oh he was talking about so and
[42:12] so and so amen they love to say it was
[42:15] about so and so and so and they get out
[42:18] of the side of the mirror they forgot
[42:20] know that reflection was for you oh my
[42:27] amen amen I don't know about you but I
[42:30] justify a lot that's me how many can say
[42:33] that's me Amen when I look a man this is
[42:36] not talking about somebody else no
[42:37] that's how I look well tell me all you
[42:42] can't live right nobody can live right
[42:44] but don't know tell me my father said I
[42:47] can be perfect well I'm climbing on up
[42:49] in there then well it won't be but a few
[42:54] well I'll tell you what if it won't be
[42:56] but a few then I'm FTW I'm gonna be
[43:01] there
[43:02] hallelujah yes I will all right now so
[43:05] let's move a little further here so now
[43:07] I just want to use this term here I told
[43:09] you this big word I might have to get
[43:11] three men to help me say it but you know
[43:15] the challenge that we're presenting it
[43:16] with is a men that sometimes people
[43:20] don't know their origin they don't know
[43:23] where they come from and you can't
[43:25] hardly get nowhere if you don't know
[43:27] where you come from you don't know how
[43:29] to act when you don't know who your
[43:30] father is you act different you act like
[43:34] everybody else you you don't want to be
[43:37] acting like other people because they
[43:39] fathers could be slaves amen
[43:43] I told my son I 20 my son is 21 they
[43:48] just got married and I told him I said
[43:50] son don't walk out of here and forget
[43:52] who you are
[43:53] you will never be nobody else but who
[43:57] God made you you are the word amen
[44:02] so but they got this thing called uh
[44:05] it's the acronym is DNA so we all know
[44:09] what DNA is amen uh-uh
[44:13] deoxyribonucleic acid I told you I've
[44:19] just spoken to him didn't I I just might
[44:22] as well just spoke that is another li
[44:23] but it's dioxyde I bow nuclei acid what
[44:26] anyway is DNA
[44:27] and so they got this term a DNA where
[44:30] they can trace your origin all the way
[44:34] back and find out who you are a man with
[44:40] these tests a man that the studies are
[44:44] showing that there's about 99% accuracy
[44:47] then they can trace something get a
[44:50] little piece of your hair a little skin
[44:51] a little hair a little your blood sample
[44:54] a mint and they can trace you back and
[44:56] find out where you came from and I like
[45:00] that and I think tonight just as we just
[45:03] finish up a man I think we need to see
[45:06] our origin would you like that would you
[45:08] like to know you got to pay for the
[45:10] other one but this one is free amen amen
[45:13] all right Amen just a little test here
[45:16] the Word of God often refers to itself
[45:18] as a seat how many know the Bible calls
[45:20] itself a seed amen on that word see
[45:23] actually in a Greek is sperma which is
[45:28] the same word and it's gold type of keys
[45:30] here but it's the same word for sperm
[45:32] but in that sperm is everything about
[45:36] your daddy everything amen and so we
[45:42] need to check the seed because in that
[45:46] seed is the genetic makeup everything
[45:50] you're gonna do all of your you know
[45:52] your own things that you're gonna do
[45:54] everything that that you're walking into
[45:56] is gonna be based on the seed now you
[45:58] can't get blood from a turnip you can't
[46:00] get apples from oranges how many know
[46:03] what I'm talking about if it's an orange
[46:04] see all when it popped up is gonna be
[46:06] orange don't be surprised when you see
[46:09] it Amen it's gonna be it can't be great
[46:13] from you can get great from raisins but
[46:16] you can't get a great from corn seed
[46:20] y'all know what I'm saying all right and
[46:22] so that's what we're looking at here we
[46:23] wanna look a look closer here amen
[46:26] conception cannot take place without
[46:28] first planting a seed and new beginnings
[46:31] a man must be planted with the right
[46:33] seed if you don't you gonna come up with
[46:35] the same thing amen
[46:38] oh that's so important right there
[46:40] Genesis 111 is a very important here now
[46:43] Genesis uljin take notes and this will
[46:45] be on the tape y'all go back to study
[46:47] Genesis 1 and 11 says God says ever
[46:50] cease to bring forth of its kind whose
[46:53] seed is in itself
[46:55] all right so kids it's good test for you
[46:57] what what come first chicken on a very
[47:06] good a chicken that's good that's real
[47:09] good that's a powerful revelation
[47:11] brother I see some people still puzzling
[47:15] we've heard that song what kumaris
[47:17] chicken or the egg we stood on some
[47:19] people but let's see what God did he
[47:22] spoke it and there's a little chicken
[47:25] going around but in that chicken he put
[47:27] the seed in the chicken so the chicken
[47:29] could hatch another chicken hallelujah
[47:33] whose seed is in himself God said let
[47:36] there be a tree and he put the life of
[47:38] the tree in the tree God said let there
[47:41] be a he made a Fish Little Fish front
[47:44] floating around but he put the life in
[47:47] the fish you can't get away from God's
[47:51] creation and God saw all these things
[47:53] that was good
[47:54] amen and then he spoke man whose seed is
[48:00] where in itself how many you see that
[48:05] all right st. John 1 in 12 but as many
[48:08] as received him to them gave he power to
[48:12] become the sons of God even to them that
[48:15] believe on his name not seen in that a
[48:17] beautiful thing now let's watch watch
[48:18] the scripture your God what he's did see
[48:20] look you're not trying to become
[48:23] something you know say well oh Lord I
[48:25] sure wish I could be a Christian oh if
[48:29] you can receive Jesus Christ as your
[48:32] Savior he gives you the power to become
[48:36] what you originally were when he spoke
[48:40] it in the beginning oh that's so
[48:42] powerful I'm not trying to be a
[48:45] Christian I have accepted the call that
[48:50] I am a Christian I'm not a sinner say by
[48:53] God you
[48:54] people get saved in all this God done
[48:56] for us and people still want to be
[48:58] sinners saved well come on now what one
[49:03] is gonna be black and white you gonna be
[49:06] both at the same time you won't be a
[49:08] zebra no be one of the other when you
[49:11] were a sinner you are a sinner and when
[49:15] you get saved you're not a sinner sinner
[49:18] sin Saints make mistakes but they didn't
[49:24] intend to do it listen David was not an
[49:27] adulterer he committed adultery the
[49:29] scriptures don't show him going around
[49:31] with woman after woman after woman how
[49:35] many know what I'm talking about seed is
[49:39] inside amen if you continue to say yes
[49:42] you need to be adulterer well brother I
[49:44] can't get over well that's the message
[49:45] from this mornin you need a breakthrough
[49:48] oh that devil is so powerful and Jesus
[49:52] is more powerful how many know what I'm
[49:55] talking about
[49:56] if we don't preach this way people a
[49:58] stay in the same condition but you can
[50:00] come out of that thing the Bible in the
[50:03] book of Exodus Exodus at them as they
[50:06] were leaving Exodus the last couple of
[50:09] verses in there Moses led on said their
[50:12] enemies that you see now you will see
[50:15] them no more hallelujah
[50:18] it doesn't mean you won't have no
[50:19] battles down the road but at least you
[50:21] all have those how many know what I'm
[50:23] talking about I'm not saying you won't
[50:24] fight nothing else but at least you
[50:26] ought to stop fighting what you've been
[50:28] fighting year after year after year
[50:29] getting them all in that plane and come
[50:33] on out people want you to explain it but
[50:35] you can't explain it
[50:38] that's what you know that's what you
[50:41] mess up y'all know the story people what
[50:44] can you explain how to give word see
[50:46] people want you to don't you know
[50:48] explain it won't do you a bit of good if
[50:50] you hadn't got faith and a sinner off
[50:53] the street won't care how I work they
[50:55] just all they know all I can tell you I
[50:57] was blind and none of y'all did anything
[51:00] for me but this man laid his hand on me
[51:03] and I can't see he didn't explain it he
[51:06] believed it hallelujah oh my goodness
[51:12] it's just all right y'all right Amen all
[51:16] right so now all right that's the new
[51:17] beginning it's the citing time for you
[51:19] but just in case you're doubting and I
[51:21] don't know if y'all but huh I'm just
[51:23] gonna share this Amen I want to mention
[51:25] some tests I won't take some hair
[51:27] samples some skin samples and amen if
[51:29] that's that everybody ready don't leave
[51:31] the building don't leave any men some
[51:35] hair samples some skin samples some
[51:37] folks a men are saved as long as you
[51:39] don't touch the hair on their skin some
[51:42] people save as long as you don't parking
[51:44] apart or you don't say Nisan they don't
[51:47] like Peter saying this on the pastor
[51:49] love it when I sing it and some people
[51:50] are saved until you rub them the wrong
[51:53] way and all of a sudden salvation go out
[51:55] the door I mean you know what I'm
[51:57] talking about that's not from the
[51:59] original origin amen
[52:01] all right amen so we're gonna check and
[52:04] see where who you've been with because
[52:06] you know you can be with two real close
[52:08] together people can be religious and be
[52:13] with the devil how many no but if you
[52:17] ever get close to God at all if you ever
[52:21] have an experience it is impossible to
[52:25] come out and be in the same how many no
[52:28] that's the truth yes I like how Jesus
[52:33] said he didn't say go into Jerusalem and
[52:35] stay there for about three days and then
[52:37] you received the Holy Ghost
[52:38] did he say that no he said go in
[52:40] Jerusalem and wait on what until how
[52:44] long so well it's been three hours no
[52:48] God said wait until well I think I got
[52:50] it now no I don't think you have it now
[52:53] cuz trials can come and shake you when
[52:57] you find out oh I didn't have what I
[52:59] thought we'll see you don't understand
[53:01] until everybody must have their own
[53:05] revelation of what until me that when
[53:09] you get up and is settled
[53:12] the Word of God is a man
[53:15] I'm convinced that it's right
[53:19] yes the DNA now you need to know you
[53:21] need to know your origin eat know where
[53:23] you came from so you can get back there
[53:25] we need to know amen
[53:26] all right all right so let us make man
[53:29] in His image in other words God is
[53:31] saying when I'm finished he's gonna look
[53:33] like me that's right when God finish
[53:36] they don't we won't listen we're not
[53:38] going to heaven or barely make it no
[53:41] we're gonna be marching amen how about
[53:46] you I'm gonna beat you no I say this
[53:50] just a minute you see I got a big mouth
[53:52] y'all forgive me
[53:54] amen but I just can't help it it's
[53:56] something down there's bigger than me
[53:58] inside my soul but you know I wanted to
[54:01] go to the Marine Corps thank God well I
[54:03] guess I didn't make it there God had
[54:07] other plans for me but you know I was
[54:09] training to go to the Marine Corps and
[54:11] had been to Parris Island three four
[54:13] times or two three times and the
[54:16] senior-most Singh's decide hey I'm
[54:18] getting out on clearly get cool you know
[54:19] y'all not you know young people get when
[54:21] they get senior they get cool on a man
[54:24] but I was good and say Amen then at that
[54:27] time and that last year I decided I'm
[54:29] going anyway this is 40 and I didn't
[54:31] happen it's a well gesture you don't
[54:32] have to go but I thought no I want to go
[54:34] and I got that any thought and they're
[54:36] gonna got that big mouth so you know
[54:38] they gave me the position of God on I
[54:41] could carry the flag amen and said hood
[54:44] dude and I just shouted out and I think
[54:47] God God gave me a position in his army
[54:49] then I can hold the flag hut - amen
[54:53] stop your crying stop talking about you
[54:56] can't make it a man is only a few hours
[54:58] in a day you don't you not up all day -
[55:00] Devils not fighting you all day the
[55:02] devil didn't fight Jesus all day he
[55:04] fought him for a season and if you whip
[55:07] him good he'll leave you alone a little
[55:09] while you get a little rest and shape up
[55:13] you come back you kind of oh I better
[55:18] watch I'm Ben amen
[55:20] and then we'll tell you why don't you

[55:34] make sure amen that God God wants he
[55:38] said I'm gonna make man in my image and
[55:40] my likeness not only will have his shape
[55:44] I'll act like him how many want a hack
[55:46] like a man of course you know we're not
[55:51] gonna be a little cloud floating around
[55:53] now amen we'll have the other shade yet
[55:57] at low cost took on a human shape it was
[55:59] still logos in it it was still a pillar
[56:02] of fire but it took all human shape so
[56:04] you can't break the scripture I mean it
[56:07] know what I'm talking about now same God
[56:08] same Elohim same logo same people fire
[56:11] but it they will all feel not down in
[56:15] the toll they will feel that same logos
[56:19] that not all not on your hand no in your
[56:22] body
[56:27] how many thank God for that
[56:29] oh that's beautiful amen come on clap

[1:06:51] off our skin amen amen
[1:06:53] in our own image and in our likeness
[1:06:55] that's right God was a man and said
[1:06:57] another way let me show you how he would
[1:06:59] look when he would come God placed
[1:07:01] himself in a gene and you already have
[1:07:05] the father's spiritual DNA Amen God says
[1:07:10] let me show you how he will act when he
[1:07:13] comes God says he got so God gave man a
[1:07:16] shape
[1:07:17] he gave him character and he shows you
[1:07:20] how he'll look and he also showed you
[1:07:22] how God would act when he comes inside
[1:07:25] the form of human flesh don't say that
[1:07:28] was Jesus doing that no that was me that
[1:07:32] was God in man doing it that was God
[1:07:34] showing any of what you look like how
[1:07:37] many believe that all right let's move a
[1:07:39] little closer closer here and then we'll
[1:07:41] stop amen understand your DNA makeup it
[1:07:44] will help you when your child leaves the
[1:07:46] house you know it's in the genes
[1:07:51] and after the party all the money spent
[1:07:57] in it cuz you know it's a part as long
[1:08:00] as you got money all your friends will
[1:08:03] stay when you have the party amen but
[1:08:07] soon as the money gone and the last
[1:08:08] little ball of wine we got to sip it
[1:08:10] small cuz that's all gone and I came
[1:08:12] back no more you know people big turn
[1:08:14] when he can buy it but when they came by
[1:08:16] they not that be and God will allow you
[1:08:19] just like the prodigal son to have spit
[1:08:22] all check the scripture he ran out got
[1:08:28] down to almost eaten hog slaw yes
[1:08:35] can't make it in this world bias if you
[1:08:37] can't just ignore what God wants to do
[1:08:39] with you and do what you want to do God
[1:08:41] will call you how many believe that you
[1:08:45] spit all but you know at the internet
[1:08:49] that prodigal son the Bible says he came
[1:08:51] to himself you know I could at least go
[1:08:54] home to my father what was that that was
[1:08:57] that gene on the inside that was that
[1:09:00] genetic makeup that before he a man went
[1:09:03] out there he was already a sir and the
[1:09:08] deep call to the deep and it pulled it
[1:09:11] back yes
[1:09:15] traced it back it was there all along
[1:09:18] yes DNA is the carrier of our genetic
[1:09:21] makeup amen now let me go here just a
[1:09:24] little let me lighten up a minute and we
[1:09:25] can turn a corner here and we can get
[1:09:27] out of here now see now and we y'all
[1:09:29] notice I hope it ain't on nurses in yet
[1:09:32] well oh I'm gonna try you can fix this
[1:09:36] for me in Amen at conception we know it
[1:09:39] takes a father and a mother right to
[1:09:41] have a child
[1:09:41] amen amen take your father in a mother
[1:09:46] yeah take both you need a carrier and
[1:09:48] you need somebody who got life amen
[1:09:51] we each have 23 pairs of chromosomes of
[1:09:55] each pair one received from the father
[1:09:57] and one received from the mother and
[1:09:59] these 23 pairs of chromosomes are known
[1:10:01] as the DNA all right so these 23
[1:10:05] chromosome is known as the sex
[1:10:06] chromosomes and with these other ones
[1:10:08] one is inherited from the father and one
[1:10:10] comes from the mother and just real
[1:10:12] shortly one of those chromosomes come
[1:10:14] from the mother that's an X the other
[1:10:17] chromosome comes from the father that's
[1:10:19] a Y now the mother just have all X's I
[1:10:22] think that's a good thing
[1:10:26] amen
[1:10:28] well got a lot of X's but the father has
[1:10:31] in him he has X's and Y's so the mother
[1:10:36] have all these X's in a Amy and I think
[1:10:38] God gave that to us so she can tell this
[1:10:40] man Hicks
[1:10:44] that's right
[1:10:45] she get to the next one X I'm an older
[1:10:48] woman at the well she had six exes she
[1:10:53] had five of them you know she tried to
[1:10:54] hold one of them exes back
[1:10:57] you got five exits dad you know you know
[1:11:00] she wanted a drink we all know that amen
[1:11:02] but sometimes God before you give your
[1:11:04] drain you won't you give it at last X
[1:11:06] well you know you got one at home and no
[1:11:09] he's not your he found that other eggs
[1:11:12] so there was six of them amen
[1:11:16] God give gate and then with God see now
[1:11:21] if you let God let God cross out all
[1:11:23] them things that are not supposed to be
[1:11:26] yours and God a man will give you the
[1:11:28] right one she met Jesus she never met a
[1:11:32] man like that yes all right so a man she
[1:11:38] get a man God gave him them amen and you
[1:11:41] know I'm gonna paraphrase this like this
[1:11:44] say now you give an X you know and he
[1:11:49] say well well you giving me an X you
[1:11:52] tell that person you go see Jesus and
[1:11:54] he'll tell you why y'all didn't catch
[1:11:57] that
[1:11:59] yeah the father has the Y's amen
[1:12:03] yes see it's all right so God gave Amen
[1:12:07] men or why job said why was I born some
[1:12:12] people live in this world don't know why
[1:12:13] they born they don't know why they hear
[1:12:15] they think all I'm here for is eating
[1:12:17] and drinking having a good time
[1:12:19] people just want to have a good time it
[1:12:21] won't plenty money as I said in the text
[1:12:23] early this morning people want God to
[1:12:25] give them everything they're not even
[1:12:26] concerned about what God wants
[1:12:29] oh god I want to raise I want more I
[1:12:35] want I want I want but God wants
[1:12:37] something yes
[1:12:42] all right so Amen these X's and these
[1:12:44] wise they come there amen
[1:12:45] it's hard to find Amen a good
[1:12:47] old-fashioned god-fearing mother's these
[1:12:49] days that would take her child and raise
[1:12:51] her right and correct her and give us
[1:12:53] standards it may be a proper woman bill
[1:12:56] up her self-esteem teacher amen
[1:12:58] the women need to teach the other women
[1:13:00] how to use the X that's Scripture that's
[1:13:08] right if he keeps a little hole teach
[1:13:09] them how to be a woman you're not a man
[1:13:12] you're not tough amen
[1:13:15] oh let me get off at every move alright
[1:13:17] now we're gonna move here just a minute
[1:13:19] all right so we watch a man searching
[1:13:20] amen we have to know who our Father is
[1:13:23] we have to know now let's look here
[1:13:25] because we want a Hebrew seventy one

[1:13:29] with milk hesitate real quickly now just
[1:13:32] don't let the stumble you but I just
[1:13:34] want to show you in Hebrews 71 this by
[1:13:36] the Bible says this had come this man
[1:13:39] that didn't have a father now what we're
[1:13:41] gonna do
[1:13:41] oh my goodness he has no y chromosomes
[1:13:45] he has no X chromosome because he didn't
[1:13:47] have a mother and it didn't have a
[1:13:49] father how many know that's in Hebrews
[1:13:51] 71 that's right it also says he was
[1:13:54] without descent so he did dision oh
[1:13:58] Jesus
[1:13:59] how many just old y'all don't leave me
[1:14:02] now don't don't turn out we didn't
[1:14:03] dismiss yet I'm just reading going to
[1:14:05] humming - no that's in the Bible this
[1:14:08] man didn't have a father he didn't have
[1:14:10] a mother Amy and he didn't DC in oh my
[1:14:14] goodness oh god my brain is breaking
[1:14:18] amen so this man had no origin you don't
[1:14:21] be like way you came from C but you
[1:14:23] couldn't ask this man that you couldn't
[1:14:25] add some where'd he come from
[1:14:27] praise the Lord he had no origin he had
[1:14:31] no background you know people like to
[1:14:32] check your background this man didn't
[1:14:34] have a background you couldn't check who
[1:14:36] his father was who his mother laws where
[1:14:38] he descended from all mines omaha amen
[1:14:41] amen
[1:14:42] in terms of a family or nationality hat
[1:14:44] you couldn't run a background check on
[1:14:46] him he had no beginning of days so he
[1:14:49] never was a baby oh my goodness
[1:14:52] and he did not grow ups cuz he didn't
[1:14:56] have an end of life he didn't age he
[1:14:58] didn't get all he's still the same age
[1:15:00] right now this man I'm talking about huh

[1:15:03] but you should say Amen when they get
[1:15:05] hard I have to say it I'm a preacher but
[1:15:07] I things are so unbelievable I have to
[1:15:09] preach them in and say it to myself and
[1:15:11] I know
[1:15:12] and then the devil said what don't you
[1:15:13] preach that but it's in the Bible how
[1:15:16] many know what I'm talking about yes

[1:15:32] shout trying to hold myself oh but I'm
[1:15:38] so glad that I believe that aren't you
