[41:03] have thine own way this morning
[41:07] i'm not the speaker but you are lord
[41:10] and i pray father that you give me the
[41:12] grace
[41:13] to move completely out of your way
[41:16] in your name jesus christ we pray
[41:20] amen
[41:21] [Music]
[41:24] now as we stand
[41:26] [Music]
[41:30] i'd like for you to turn with us
[41:34] to second corinthians
[41:36] the fifth chapter
[41:39] we're going to be reading uh the first
[41:42] to the eighth verses of this particular
[41:44] chapter
[41:48] then we'll go to first corinthians 13.
[42:18] second corinthians the fifth chapter
[42:20] they're going to
[42:21] sanc
[42:23] we'll start reading from the first verse
[42:28] for we know that if
[42:30] our earthly tabernacle
[42:34] were dissolved we have a building of god
[42:37] and house not made with hands
[42:40] eternal
[42:41] in the heavens
[42:54] earnestly desiring to be clothed upon
[42:58] with our house which is from heaven
[43:10] amen
[43:14] if so be that being clothed we shall not
[43:18] be found
[43:19] naked
[43:21] [Music]
[43:23] in
[43:23] your
[43:26] for we that are in this tabernacle to
[43:28] groan
[43:30] being burdened not
[43:31] for that we would be unclothed but
[43:34] clothed upon that mortality might be
[43:37] swallowed up of life
[43:53] thing is god
[43:55] who also have given unto us
[43:58] the earnest of the spirit is aforeme
[44:05] therefore
[44:06] we are always confident
[44:09] knowing that while we are at home in the
[44:13] body we are absent from the lord
[44:18] confidence
[44:30] we are confident i say
[44:33] and willingly rather to be given
[44:37] rather to be absent excuse me from the
[44:39] body and to be present with the lord
[44:46] [Music]
[44:48] first corinthians now 13th chapter
[44:52] as i said once earlier glad to see
[44:54] everybody here in the house of the lord
[44:58] this is definitely the place you ought
[44:59] to be
[45:02] amen first corinthians 13 and 3.
[45:06] and though i bestow all my goods to feed
[45:09] the poor
[45:11] and though i give my body to be burned
[45:14] and have not charity it profiteth
[45:29] the same chapter let's drop down to the
[45:31] ninth verse and then i'll let you be
[45:33] seated
[45:36] for we know in part and we prophesy in
[45:40] part
[45:44] but when that which is perfect is come
[45:47] then that which is in part shall be done
[45:50] away
[45:55] when i was a child i spaked as a child
[45:58] i understood as a child i thought as a
[46:01] child but when i became a man
[46:04] i put away childish things
[46:07] [Music]
[46:26] we pray lord god this morning
[46:29] in your lovely name
[46:31] let your perfect will be done this
[46:34] morning
[46:36] only you can break the bread of life
[46:39] but we stand as a witness
[46:42] but what you can do the scripture
[46:43] profound sir lord stephanie wrong have
[46:46] thine own way scripture in your loving
[46:48] name jesus christ
[46:50] we pray amen amen you may be seated
[46:59] i know many of you have
[47:01] been kind of listening to
[47:04] uh
[47:06] the change in the ministry if you want
[47:07] to say it like that
[47:19] but i try to use as many quotes by
[47:21] brother branham as i possibly can
[47:27] to give us vision of what what god is
[47:29] requiring for us
[47:35] we do not want to be stuck in a church
[47:38] age
[47:41] that is not the proper place where we
[47:43] should be see
[47:46] this message has been ordained
[47:50] to unite us with the headstone
[47:54] who is jesus christ himself jesus to
[47:57] remember
[47:58] we know that in the pentecostal age
[48:02] there were great many things that
[48:04] happened
[48:15] they did not have what
[48:18] it takes in navi basically for uh to
[48:21] make a rapture or alone
[48:24] don't get me wrong now on the move those
[48:26] two pentecostals
[48:29] we'll make a rapture
[48:32] but we know what they did wrong
[48:35] they organized around the truth
[48:39] and they began to
[48:41] uh
[48:42] incorporate
[48:43] their own creeds and dogmas
[49:01] the initial evidence of the holy ghost
[49:07] was speaking in tongues
[49:09] and when they did that
[49:12] they died is it
[49:27] [Music]
[49:42] that
[49:55] like we
[49:56] have arrived comes in something
[50:00] but until
[50:01] men you and i come
[50:04] into the statue of a perfect man
[50:07] you have not arrived
[50:14] and the vision in which god is given to
[50:17] us
[50:18] is that we must come into the very image
[50:21] second
[50:22] likeness of god
[50:24] hallelujah
[50:38] oftentimes
[50:41] we think that when we come into
[50:43] perfection
[50:46] we we've got to be so great do they want
[50:48] to go until we move in mountains
[50:52] into the eyes
[52:02] but
[52:03] [Music]
[52:11] [Music]
[52:16] you may
[52:31] make a skeleton of a man turn back to
[52:33] life again
[52:37] you may never see him
[52:40] standing yonder in three or four
[52:42] rainbows

[54:07] that brother would be the forerunner
[54:47] what i was hesitating about

[55:07] there came that light coming down
[55:11] people began fainting
[55:14] and a voice came that shook all around
[55:17] that place
[55:31] [Music]
[55:32] will be the forerunner
[55:59] you see the messaging itself
[56:02] it's a revelation
[56:04] hallelujah and only the elected son
[56:09] that is those who are chosen
[56:12] to make a rapture
[56:14] will understand
[56:24] christ

[56:28] between the
[56:40] not only is she the elected lady of

[58:17] and you and i must come to an uh image
[58:34] in the mirror
[58:45] man
[59:03] i just couldn't do it
[59:05] i came to the message
[59:07] i tried to act like the message people
[59:09] she said
[59:11] [Music]
[59:12] back in my day
[59:14] you were only allowed to sing hymns
[59:30] y'all understand what i'm saying
[59:33] every
[59:34] every age
[59:37] produces something
[59:40] it just doesn't take from the age before
[59:44] but it always
[59:52] and and because i couldn't fall in line
[59:56] it comes
[59:57] with what people wanted you need
[1:00:12] don't unsystem
[1:00:15] you understand what i'm saying
[1:00:17] because brother branham said it like
[1:00:19] this
[1:00:20] when somebody tried to draw you out
[1:00:23] you make a big circle on there and draw
[1:00:25] them back in and
[1:00:36] many people are married to the system of
[1:00:38] the message
[1:00:40] and have not received christ in their
[1:00:42] lives
[1:00:46] you can walk the message
[1:00:48] you can talk the message
[1:00:50] and you can fake the life of the message
[1:00:53] you heard what i'm saying
[1:01:00] [Applause]
[1:01:07] what
[1:01:11] hello
[1:01:12] because what's supposed to be in you
[1:01:14] suppose it's christ in you
[1:01:17] the hope of glory
[1:01:19] i don't mean no harm
[1:01:21] but god does not have a roommate
[1:01:25] the
[1:01:26] roommate
[1:01:28] in other words my heart is not a duplex
[1:01:33] duplex there's only one that sits on the
[1:01:35] throne
[1:01:45] [Music]
[1:01:50] that you have met
[1:01:51] the criteria
[1:01:54] of the message for this hour
[1:01:57] every age shock and fulfill the word of
[1:02:01] god
[1:02:10] [Applause]
[1:02:18] he fulfilled it
[1:02:36] [Music]
[1:02:47] this day
[1:02:48] hallelujah but it's not about william
[1:02:51] branham anymore
[1:02:53] i thank god for my prophet
[1:02:55] don't get me wrong
[1:02:57] i'm not ashamed of him
[1:02:59] i thank god for the work he did
[1:03:02] but right now
[1:03:03] the move is on for the bride
[1:03:06] and they cannot be completed without us
[1:03:11] the prophet of god is depending on us
[1:03:14] he's depending
[1:03:26] but most of all we can't let the lord
[1:03:28] jesus down
[1:03:39] who going to tell those who are in the
[1:03:41] pentecostal realm
[1:03:57] the bible says
[1:03:59] that they are in a cage
[1:04:03] not just them all of this all of the
[1:04:04] systems
[1:04:08] and the bible says that what dwells in
[1:04:09] them is every unclean
[1:04:24] super sign
[1:04:27] he is the last sign
[1:04:31] and remember
[1:04:32] the super sign in abraham's time was
[1:04:35] what
[1:04:38] manifested himself in the flesh those
[1:04:40] could use them and facilities and so
[1:04:41] showed his great manifestations
[1:04:44] of knowing what sarah was saying in the
[1:04:46] tent
[1:04:50] the last sign
[1:04:51] that israel got before her rejection
[1:04:56] and called jesus
[1:04:58] was when jesus could perceive their
[1:05:01] thoughts
[1:05:05] that was in their heart
[1:05:08] huh
[1:05:10] israel before their rejection
[1:05:13] did you hear that
[1:05:14] so what i'm saying the church ages
[1:05:16] before the the laodicea before her
[1:05:19] rejections
[1:05:29] hiding behind the flesh of william
[1:05:31] branham
[1:05:32] oh come on somebody it's true anyhow i
[1:05:35] didn't call him god i said god
[1:05:37] was hiding behind the flesh
[1:05:40] it was god immorphy
[1:05:44] changing his mind
[1:05:48] now we can say amen about him
[1:05:51] but what about us
[1:05:54] you got to understand
[1:05:56] it doesn't stop there
[1:05:58] rebecca is still rebecca
[1:06:01] hallelujah
[1:06:08] and when jesus
[1:06:10] could perceive the thoughts that was in
[1:06:12] their heart
[1:06:15] jesus said
[1:06:16] that this generation
[1:06:18] will receive the same thing
[1:06:22] that's that's the last
[1:06:24] what is it
[1:06:25] you know brother said it like this
[1:06:27] he says god is a just god
[1:06:57] [Music]
[1:06:59] oh yes
[1:07:01] by god's grace i got subdrew
[1:07:05] let's move on
[1:07:09] is that who was it
[1:07:12] that's exactly right
[1:07:15] because it was a mechanic in the flesh
[1:07:19] jesus christ jesus christ became mecca
[1:07:25] hello
[1:07:26] have you noticed
[1:07:28] that even his name changed me
[1:07:37] it's a reason why brother braden said i
[1:07:38] no longer call you church well
[1:07:53] that means the character has changed
[1:07:59] the changing of the character
[1:08:02] gives you the changing of your name
[1:08:06] hallelujah
[1:08:08] yes jesus said that this generation
[1:08:11] jesus would receive the same thing
[1:08:14] what's the father remember that who's
[1:08:15] the last silly what is it
[1:08:17] that was god with abraham did you ever
[1:08:19] that was god in christ it's the dream
[1:08:22] god with abraham god in christ
[1:08:25] emmanuel
[1:08:27] and today is god in his church
[1:08:30] the super sign that god still lives
[1:08:33] do you believe it
[1:08:34] don't you never get away from it stay
[1:08:38] with it
[1:08:39] it's the closing of the hour
[1:08:42] it's the closing hour of world history
[1:08:50] we
[1:09:18] only
[1:09:33] hear him i'm reading a lot
[1:09:38] but the prophet says
[1:09:40] god
[1:09:42] put people on earth
[1:09:45] man to control the earth
[1:09:49] the bible said
[1:09:50] that a man is a god anomaly
[1:09:54] did you know that
[1:09:55] he sure is
[1:09:57] jesus said
[1:09:58] it is not written in is it not written
[1:10:00] in your laws
[1:10:04] to visit the jews and if they're in
[1:10:05] their gods

[1:22:53] see them fall we'll see them stumble and

[1:27:04] present time
[1:27:05] are not worthy to be compared with the
[1:27:07] glory which shall be revealed in us
[1:27:15] for the earnest expectation of the
[1:27:17] creature
[1:27:18] waited for the manifestations of the
[1:27:20] sons of god
[1:27:24] for the creature was made subject to
[1:27:27] vanity not willingly
[1:27:29] but by reason of him who have subjected
[1:27:32] the same in hope
[1:27:40] because the creature itself
[1:27:42] also shall be delivered from the bondage
[1:27:44] of corruption in the glory's liberty of
[1:27:46] the children of god
[1:27:54] naturally
[1:27:57] naturally
[1:28:20] hallelujah god brought a
[1:28:24] deliverance amen amen
[1:29:06] is that all right
[1:29:19] some of y'all thinking oh ain't no way i

[1:30:03] i've never
[1:30:18] me
[1:30:20] i've been in bondage
[1:30:24] to some things
[1:30:26] and it doesn't matter what you've been
[1:30:28] in bondage to propose

[1:35:26] [Music]
[1:35:27] you didn't do it
[1:35:29] god did it

[1:35:34] a horse and be a cow

[1:35:42] if you're offspring of a horse it makes
[1:35:44] you a horse
[1:35:45] if your offspring of a cow it makes you
[1:35:48] a cow
[1:35:49] give you the offspring of god
[1:35:51] it makes you god
[1:35:55] don't tell me that ain't true
[1:35:57] that's the problem with a lot of y'all
[1:35:58] y'all still want to be boss
[1:36:01] you want to be boss
[1:36:05] boss b-o-s-s the boss yeah
[1:36:09] that shows that you want to be a god
[1:36:12] you want to rule
[1:36:14] there's something in you
[1:36:19] what what about a dog
[1:36:21] you make that dog
[1:36:27] [Music]
[1:36:30] right and if he doesn't do what you want
[1:36:32] him
[1:36:34] you beat him in the shade
[1:36:51] he wants the nature in you
[1:36:54] to change you
[1:36:55] from glory to glory there's no way i can
[1:36:57] remember i can do all of this
[1:36:59] i always overdo it but by god's grace
[1:37:13] did you know he said that that
[1:37:16] melchizedek was jesus christ
[1:37:46] he
[1:38:01] in what god is trying to do for you
[1:38:04] and do not think in the past all the
[1:38:07] trials come to you
[1:38:10] because of evil
[1:38:14] jesus was trying to teach his disciples
[1:38:16] jesus he don't see he had already given
[1:38:18] them the power over over the over the
[1:38:20] sick and the win
[1:38:23] on a boat
[1:38:25] he's on the boat
[1:38:28] and the storm starts
[1:38:33] the oars broke the
[1:38:35] feel
[1:38:36] everything started breaking you know
[1:38:39] water start coming into the ship
[1:38:53] that we perish
[1:39:09] and we look to heaven like he's sitting
[1:39:13] when he's in you
[1:39:20] and you know what he rebuked them
[1:39:22] he said oh ye of little faith
[1:39:46] what greater can come after the message
[1:39:50] only the manifestation of it
[1:40:06] uh this message wants to strike you the
[1:40:09] right way
[1:40:11] supposed to bring forth the word of god
[1:40:13] in you
[1:40:15] this is another this is not an assembly
[1:40:18] assembly
[1:40:19] everybody come together like some kind
[1:40:22] of lodge that's not it
[1:40:25] the word of god
[1:40:27] preached
[1:40:28] to you
[1:40:30] under the kind of glory
[1:40:33] it's the word that's supposed to be
[1:40:34] changing
[1:41:02] me
[1:41:06] you gotta understand that god has made
[1:41:08] you more than a beast
[1:41:12] we have the ability to create
[1:41:15] a capacity to create
[1:41:19] we know that and even in the natural
[1:41:20] even in the fallen estate
[1:41:26] we build houses we build cars
[1:41:29] you know all of those things we allow
[1:41:30] ourselves to do
[1:41:32] remember
[1:41:33] and you know then when god said you can
[1:41:35] do it supernaturally
[1:41:37] [Music]
[1:41:38] we question the ability that he's
[1:41:40] already placed in us
[1:42:24] all of these things really is
[1:42:26] already in the tree
[1:42:29] it's in the seed
[1:42:31] the ability of jesus christ is in the
[1:42:33] sea
[1:42:34] and all it needs to do is be anointed
[1:42:38] and it needs people to believe what's
[1:42:40] really in them
[1:42:43] now i said that and i'ma close
[1:42:52] anyway let me um
[1:42:58] let me read this one
[1:43:00] messiah let me see
[1:43:02] no
[1:43:03] now on the outside gate of a man
[1:43:48] where god can enter into him
[1:44:05] something
[1:44:06] i can't thank you
[1:44:07] it has to be self-will
[1:44:11] hallelujah whether you will to or not
[1:44:16] to you
[1:44:31] put him right
[1:44:33] back in line like adam and eve
[1:44:38] more agency again
[1:44:43] you can choose right or wrong
[1:44:46] either
[1:44:59] then the spirit makes the soul
[1:45:02] and then the soul dwells in the body
[1:45:06] now when a man is converted
[1:45:09] just like that little white button
[1:45:12] starts in the heart
[1:45:28] let me read on he can let that spirit
[1:45:30] grow
[1:45:33] and take out all the root of bitterness
[1:45:37] god wade through him again
[1:45:42] he can become back in the same condition
[1:45:46] that he was when he was in the garden of
[1:45:48] eden
[1:45:52] jesus said
[1:45:53] mark 11 20 11 11 24 mark verily verily i
[1:45:58] say unto you
[1:46:00] if you say to this mountain
[1:46:04] and don't doubt in your heart
[1:46:08] what you have said
[1:46:10] will come to
[1:46:38] same message now we're made up of light
[1:46:42] meters
[1:46:46] inside of us
[1:46:50] now that cosmic light
[1:46:52] is a light that they can take an x-ray
[1:46:55] with it's a truly computer exactly x-ray
[1:46:58] the x-ray doesn't come from the x-ray
[1:47:01] light the x-ray the viewing part of
[1:47:03] x-ray it comes from your own light
[1:47:20] god
[1:47:37] [Music]
[1:47:48] layout this year this is the influence
[1:47:51] of lay of the sea is everywhere
[1:47:55] will you allow it to control you it's
[1:47:56] good
[1:47:58] or will you press out of that darkness
[1:48:02] into this marvelous
[1:48:30] maybe i'm by myself i don't know
[1:48:33] i am so tired
[1:48:37] of
[1:48:39] powerless
[1:48:41] powerlessness
[1:48:43] message people the
[1:48:49] [Music]
[1:48:59] when they had the real thing
[1:49:02] no devil could stand before them
[1:49:05] we claim to be greater
[1:49:07] [Music]
[1:49:09] we're greater in knowledge
[1:49:11] but what about the power
[1:49:25] but we need to surrender to the world
[1:49:28] [Music]
[1:49:30] we're so cared about our own lives
[1:49:34] disciples
[1:49:36] cared nothing about their lives
[1:49:39] brother tells us about those
[1:49:54] just to get
[1:50:08] the weather
[1:50:17] you know what i'm saying
[1:50:19] how do we think
[1:50:22] that the devil is going to move out of
[1:50:23] our way
[1:50:25] when he can see the hypocrisy
[1:50:31] i don't know about you
[1:50:33] i believe this message with all my heart
[1:50:38] i do
[1:50:41] i do
[1:50:44] and i'm going to allow god
[1:50:47] to reach that goal in me
[1:51:01] here is one what is
[1:51:06] now you got to determine
[1:51:09] what you're going to do with your life
[1:51:20] [Applause]
[1:51:23] i kept you pretty long my apology
[1:51:28] i i i know i know the mind of a man is
[1:51:31] not he can't
[1:51:37] [Music]
[1:51:41] but i just know
[1:51:43] i i see something that
[1:51:45] mr secretary i got to keep striving for
[1:51:48] i got to keep pressing i got to keep
[1:51:50] moving
[1:51:53] here the united states and russia
[1:51:58] you know talking about war you know
[1:52:01] and you know russia said that america's
[1:52:03] already declared war now
[1:52:06] no bombs are falling
[1:52:08] yet
[1:52:10] and brother branham said before one bomb
[1:52:12] dropped
[1:52:20] you know all of the stuff that we're
[1:52:22] dying for and when i say dying
[1:52:26] because when you put
[1:52:27] things before god it's
[1:52:55] he has to be number one anymore huh
[1:53:00] he has to be number one
[1:53:02] you put him first
[1:53:03] he'll give you whatever you want
[1:53:06] because he knows you're gonna put god in
[1:53:08] it
[1:53:10] people of god let's not be distracted
[1:53:13] if you don't know how to pray ask god to
[1:53:15] teach you how
[1:53:17] this is a praying time
[1:53:19] i pray every day all day
[1:53:21] i mean
[1:53:22] i'm always praying because i see so many
[1:53:25] things in me that's lacking
[1:53:27] little demons all the little things that
[1:53:29] spoil the vine
[1:53:30] i see that what's wrong i'm like lord
[1:53:32] let this cosmic light just say no let's
[1:53:34] consider
[1:53:36] let it disappear
[1:53:49] [Music]
[1:53:52] and i trust
[1:54:32] that you would change their mind their
[1:54:33] way of thinking
[1:54:47] father help us now
[1:55:02] when it's time to do it
[1:55:04] we ask these things in their names jesus
[1:55:06] christ we pray
[1:55:08] feel every heart here this morning
[1:55:11] let this message not be forgotten
[1:55:14] but i trust somehow that you'll grow
[1:55:16] yourself in it
[1:55:24] amen amen
[1:55:26] one more thing brother branham talked
[1:55:28] about
[1:55:35] how they were once part of the church
[1:55:37] they knew scripture come on is it
[1:55:40] good
[1:55:41] look how the church treated them
[1:55:53] [Music]
[1:56:00] you just ask her what you want and
[1:56:01] that's the most simple one but he knew
[1:56:03] this is what she wanted
[1:56:05] and then he says your sin be forgiven
[1:56:09] and it set her free
[1:56:11] because sometimes we've do we've done
[1:56:13] things in our lives
[1:56:16] we feel like we've crossed the line
[1:56:19] we have that
[1:56:20] thing in our mind like we can't be
[1:56:21] forgiven
[1:56:25] from the devil
[1:56:39] to be forgiven
[1:56:53] as long as you've forgiven everybody
[1:56:54] who's offended you
[1:56:57] god will make it right
[1:57:01] so let's pray one more time
[1:57:03] this is
[1:57:04] not a traditional thing but let's praise
[1:57:06] god
[1:57:08] father
[1:57:09] [Music]
[1:57:20] has ensnared my brothers and sisters
[1:57:32] your mercy and grace
[1:57:34] and do it to all generations
[1:57:36] i pray that you'll touch their hearts
[1:57:38] right now
[1:57:40] and let them know all they need to do is
[1:57:42] surrender to you
[1:57:43] and to ask you for your forgiveness
[1:57:46] and father you would erase their sins
[1:57:48] and their actions
[1:57:49] as though they've never sinned in the
[1:57:51] first place
[1:57:52] jesus my lord
[1:57:54] there are no accusers here
[1:57:57] we can't point our fingers at anybody
[1:58:00] because we all have come short of the
[1:58:02] glory of god
[1:58:03] and lord we need your grace and mercy
[1:58:06] just like any sinner there is on the
[1:58:08] streets just come shakopee be kind and
[1:58:11] generous this morning
