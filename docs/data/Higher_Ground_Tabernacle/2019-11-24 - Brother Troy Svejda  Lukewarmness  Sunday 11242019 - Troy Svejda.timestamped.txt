[31:21] mind that that song ought to be sung
[31:22] with a heart of faith amen because if
[31:26] we're gonna ask the Lord to draw me near
[31:28] there's got to be a faith behind that
[31:31] request a man so that if you ask the
[31:34] Lord to draw you nearer there's gotta be
[31:36] a faith there to know that you're going
[31:38] to be drawn here Amen there's gotta be
[31:41] something inside of you that says that
[31:43] because this came out of the mouth of a
[31:45] son or a daughter of God it's got to
[31:48] come to pass it's got to happen it's
[31:50] gonna it's gonna come on right down
[31:52] right on right on right on down the road

[32:00] amen he put out his needs put out his
[32:03] the desire of his heart that he be drawn
[32:05] closer to the side of the Lord amen and
[32:09] then what God brings the response is
[32:11] sure enough signal on Sunday yeah be a
[32:14] full expectation to come Monday morning
[32:17] you're just gonna be drawn that much
[32:19] closer to the floor
[32:20] otherwise why did we sing the song in
[32:22] the first place amen every time we sing
[32:25] that song I have our lips we've got to
[32:27] have that expectation that's going to
[32:28] come to pass it's gonna happen
[32:30] hey man why because the bride requests
[32:32] the bride put out the request and now
[32:36] it's gonna come to pass Amen that says I
[32:39] just I love that about that song maybe a
[32:42] let's just says we stand we're gonna
[32:44] open in our Bibles to Revelation chapter
[32:45] 3 it's good to see everybody here in the
[32:49] house of the Lord this morning
[32:53] hey man God was a good God isn't he a
[32:57] man will read revelations chapter 3
[33:08] start with the fifteenth verse speaking
[33:14] to the Laodicean church and it says I
[33:22] know thy works that thou art neither
[33:28] cold nor hot I would that that were cold
[33:31] or hot so then because thou art lukewarm
[33:34] and neither cold nor hot I will spew
[33:40] thee out of my mouth
[33:42] amen let's just stop right there will
[33:44] bow our heads and word of Prayer
[33:46] Heavenly Father we just want to thank
[33:48] you Lord for your word
[33:50] it's eternal and true father Lord we
[33:53] give ourselves over to you this morning
[33:56] father we lay open our hearts to you
[33:58] father we put our lives upon the altar
[34:00] this morning Lord or we give ourselves
[34:03] to you this service Lord is for us
[34:06] father for you and for us Lord to join
[34:08] closer together as we open up the door
[34:11] and open up our hearts for you to come
[34:13] in father
[34:13] have thine own way this morning Lord
[34:15] speak to us however you will Lord we'd
[34:18] give ourselves to thee and we thank you
[34:21] for Lord work or an expectation to hear
[34:24] from your word because of your promise
[34:26] that you gave unto us and then we hold
[34:29] that promise and we say it's yes send a
[34:31] man to it and the name of Jesus Christ
[34:33] we thank you lord
[34:34] for all things and when your name we
[34:37] pray amen amen god bless you be seated I
[34:42] preached a message this morning called
[34:45] lukewarmness Amen lukewarmness as it's
[34:53] just a subject that has been on my mind
[34:56] and as I was reading about it thinking
[35:00] about it praying about it
[35:02] that word lukewarm is the only place and
[35:06] all the scriptures that shows up there
[35:12] was right there where he's prophesying
[35:13] about our age
[35:16] that's amazing thing that here when he
[35:19] they go to prophesy about our age he has
[35:22] to come up with a new word that's not
[35:27] necessarily a new word or a new topic or
[35:30] a new subject but the word lukewarm was
[35:32] not just doesn't just mean room
[35:34] temperature
[35:35] you know because many things are room
[35:39] temperature but they're supposed to be
[35:42] room temperature you know we we come
[35:45] into this room here we don't expect it
[35:46] to be hot or cold in the sanctuary here
[35:48] but we expect it to be room for
[35:51] temperature right right in just of that
[35:54] comfort level not too hot not too cold
[35:56] and some of us you know we feel their
[35:59] Commission kick on you might think my
[36:01] I'm starting to get a little cold or if
[36:03] it gets a little stuffy in here like my
[36:05] I wish it would kick on I'm getting a
[36:06] little hot amen but when it gets to be
[36:08] just right you say it's room temperature
[36:10] you know seventy-two degrees or whatever
[36:13] your comfort level is amen and maybe for
[36:17] those that are up north might be a
[36:19] little bit different temperature range
[36:20] and those from from the southern
[36:22] climates but but it's all right around
[36:25] in that human comfort range amen and you
[36:28] know but but the word lukewarmness
[36:30] doesn't have to do with the word room
[36:33] temperature even though they really kind
[36:35] mean similar things because the word
[36:37] lukewarm has to do a something that used
[36:40] to be hot it's something that is
[36:43] supposed to be hot but somehow over the
[36:47] process of time
[36:48] something has happened to allow it to go
[36:51] from hot to begin to cool Amen it's not
[36:54] supposed to be in that condition
[36:56] Amen because this you know like this
[36:58] room here it's supposed to be room
[37:00] temperature in here we have systems in
[37:02] place to control the temperature in this
[37:04] room so that so that if it gets too cold
[37:06] in here we can heat it up if it gets too
[37:09] hot in here we can cool it back down but
[37:11] but with the word lukewarm it doesn't
[37:13] have to do with room temperature it's
[37:15] something that is supposed to be hot
[37:18] that has now begun cool off a man as the
[37:23] what the word of this age the he could
[37:26] the the best word that God could think
[37:28] of to describe this age is he we really
[37:31] thought how do I want the prophecy of
[37:33] this age to go out and he spoke out that
[37:36] word thou art lukewarm that is the
[37:41] description of the Laodicean age that we
[37:43] were living in is that the church has
[37:45] become lukewarm she should be hot she
[37:50] should be on fire for the Lord God has
[37:53] now shown so much his expression has
[37:57] gone so far he has shown so much of his
[38:00] marvelous works so much of his marvelous
[38:03] grace so much of his love towards the
[38:05] towards the children of men God so loved
[38:08] the world that He gave His only begotten
[38:13] Son to die for her to cherish her to
[38:15] love the bride and to and to draw her
[38:18] run to his precious site but in the
[38:21] midst of all that you know the church
[38:24] begins to cool off and becomes lukewarm
[38:28] he says of every age of all the ages
[38:35] they prophesied every 7th age he says I
[38:37] know thy works every single age he makes
[38:42] that statement from the Ephesian age to
[38:44] the Laodicean age he says I know thy
[38:48] works and let me tell you right now that
[38:51] this morning God knows your works Amen
[38:54] God used that to tell the temperature of
[38:57] each age a mega s we're not saved by
[39:00] works but
[39:01] when God looks at the works that you are
[39:04] doing the things you are doing with all
[39:06] your might with all your willpower with
[39:09] all your perseverance what you're doing
[39:11] with all your zeal those are your works
[39:13] the actions that you take and you can
[39:15] use that he can see the temperature of
[39:18] the age and every age he says I know thy
[39:21] works I know what you've done with the
[39:24] spirit that has been given to you I know
[39:26] what you've done with the trials that
[39:28] come by your way I know what you have
[39:30] done with with the circumstances of the
[39:33] age that you're living it and he gets to
[39:34] the Laodicean age he says I know thy
[39:37] works and that you are lukewarm I know
[39:42] thy works that thou art neither cold nor
[39:45] hot and I wish you would be just one or
[39:48] the other a man he says but because thou
[39:51] art neither lukewarm there with our
[39:54] lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I am
[39:56] going to spew thee out of my mouth
[39:58] and he goes on to describe he says you
[40:01] have allowed the things of this world to
[40:04] come in the forefront of your mind and
[40:07] those things have cooled you off towards
[40:09] the gospel the the things of this world
[40:12] the entertainment of this world the easy
[40:15] living the the computer games and the
[40:18] the movies and the enjoyments of life
[40:23] and the fine things the vacations and
[40:25] the easy living and all those things the
[40:27] the jobs that we do are trying to earn
[40:29] more money and more money and more
[40:30] things instead of being as Paul told
[40:34] Timothy charged those that are rich in
[40:37] the things of this world that they
[40:39] become rich and good works and rich
[40:41] towards God amen
[40:43] they know why so if those things don't
[40:45] become a blinder towards you that you
[40:47] would cool off towards the gospel amen
[40:52] and really we as Americans have become
[40:55] rich in these things of the world
[40:56] amen it's a this is a quite a country to
[40:59] be lukewarm in amen it's very easy to be
[41:03] lukewarm in this country
[41:04] Amen it's easy to to to to relax and
[41:08] enjoy the works of your own hands and
[41:10] just forget all about the gospel and to
[41:13] just cool off and
[41:15] and forget the one as the founding
[41:19] fathers called it Providence I came up
[41:23] with this word of God called Providence
[41:25] and that's how they describe God because
[41:27] God had provided every need for them in
[41:30] this country
[41:31] amen is from sea to shining sea the the
[41:34] land was taking care of the people and
[41:36] they and they began to call God by the
[41:39] name Providence amen because God was
[41:42] providing for their needs amen and they
[41:44] and they instituted a a holiday in this
[41:47] country called Thanksgiving a man so
[41:50] that we can give Thanksgiving to the one
[41:52] that has given us and supplied all of
[41:54] our needs
[41:55] amen but as God said about the children
[41:58] is really says that when they got fat
[42:00] amen that's when they began to kick out
[42:03] against God that's when they begin to
[42:06] forget about their God that when what
[42:08] Israel began to become fat that's when
[42:11] they kick against their very maker amen
[42:14] but you know every Christian has a
[42:16] responsibility and even some more so in
[42:19] this age has a divine responsibility to
[42:23] fight against lukewarmness
[42:27] amen every believer every believer has a
[42:31] responsibility a great solemn
[42:34] responsibility in their own heart to
[42:36] fight against the evils of this age amen
[42:41] because let me tell you God is looking
[42:43] at your works Amen God is looking at
[42:46] what you do with your time what you do
[42:49] with your hands what you do with your
[42:51] mind
[42:51] Amen what you do with your thinking God
[42:54] is examining your works to see what man
[42:57] or a person you will be will you be hot
[42:59] or will you be cold or are you just
[43:02] going to let the lukewarmness of the age
[43:03] drift you away from Christ amen you know
[43:10] and every relationship has that
[43:15] potential of becoming lukewarm every
[43:19] relationship well there be a marriage
[43:22] relationship or a relationship at work
[43:25] you know or of just life in general
[43:29] your zeal towards life Amen that let
[43:32] potential for lukewarmness is always
[43:35] there I think about the a work
[43:38] relationship you know they they talk
[43:40] about how man he gets hired for a job or
[43:43] a woman gets hired for a job and they go
[43:45] into the workplace with a zeal you know
[43:47] and they're the new person in on the
[43:49] block you know and they and they go in
[43:51] there and they and they begin to they
[43:53] work hard but you know after five years
[43:56] six years seven years you know they talk
[43:58] about the seven year stretch of when you
[44:01] you hit that stretch that that employee
[44:04] has a responsibility to not just rest on
[44:09] his laurels as they say in the English
[44:11] language or not just take it easy I'll
[44:13] I've made it this far I remember when I
[44:17] got I got my the job I'm currently in
[44:20] that I I came in with law zeal and I I
[44:23] was wanting to learn all the ropes and I
[44:26] wanted to find out how everything worked
[44:29] I wanted to know exactly I wanted to
[44:31] know 200 percent of what I needed to
[44:33] know Yona I was opening all the books
[44:36] and I was reading through all the
[44:38] manuals and I was studying all the
[44:40] buildings I was responsible for and a
[44:43] man looked over me he says what are you
[44:44] doing you already got the job he said
[44:52] you've already arrived you've already
[44:53] made it you've already got the job why
[44:55] are you even trying to do any better or
[44:58] trying to be hard you're already getting
[44:59] the paycheck why would you strive for
[45:02] anything else oh it's just my nature I'm
[45:05] not here to be lukewarm I didn't come to
[45:08] this there has to be a little more you
[45:10] know I didn't come to my job to be a
[45:12] lukewarm worker I didn't come to rest
[45:15] that I didn't come to my marriage to be
[45:16] a lukewarm husband I didn't come to my
[45:19] God to be a lukewarm Christian that's
[45:21] not that's not who I am that's just not
[45:23] the person that I'm gonna be a man
[45:25] because there's something inside of me
[45:27] there is resolved to not allow myself to
[45:30] be in that condition and every single
[45:32] one of us has a responsibility on the
[45:34] inside of themselves in every
[45:36] relationship to do unto others as Christ
[45:39] would do unto you amen
[45:42] when it comes to your marriage when it
[45:43] comes to your job when it comes to your
[45:45] place here on the earth and when it
[45:47] comes to Christ himself to fight against
[45:51] that lukewarm us amen to where you think
[45:55] well I'm just going to relax and I'm not
[45:57] going to strive for this anymore oh we
[46:00] can always strive to do better be better
[46:02] amen to be what Christ has called us to
[46:05] be because the spirit of this age is
[46:10] worth fighting against amen the spirit
[46:14] of this age not just in the Christian
[46:17] life but in all things you're the
[46:18] Christian life should be in all areas of
[46:20] your life amen amen to him to fight
[46:23] against that in all areas of your life
[46:26] amen
[46:27] it ought to be that way that it's worth
[46:31] fighting against amen so when when it
[46:37] comes to the marriage relationship you
[46:39] know the you have the honeymoon and then
[46:42] you go on down here two years you have
[46:44] the children come into place then that
[46:47] that that husband that wife have a
[46:49] responsibility to each other to keep
[46:53] that spirit of lukewarmness away from
[46:56] them
[46:56] amen they have a responsibility of each
[46:59] other to keep the fire on the altar as
[47:02] they say Amen why because we know it the
[47:06] spirit of this age Satan goes as a
[47:08] roaring lion seeking whom he may devour
[47:10] and the spirit of this age is to roll
[47:14] you asleep into lukewarm in every area
[47:19] of your life to lull you to sleep and
[47:22] were lukewarm as' but there is going to
[47:25] be a people that will reject that it's
[47:29] been prophesied that there will be a
[47:31] people on this earth called the bride of
[47:33] the Lord Jesus Christ amen and they will
[47:36] have within themselves the burning fire
[47:39] of the Holy Ghost amen it's that same
[47:42] fire that has been spoken of all the way
[47:46] from the pillar of fire upon the
[47:49] Tabernacle in the wilderness to a pillar
[47:51] of fire of our day amen as it's gone
[47:54] through every age
[47:55] pillar of fire is still here and it's
[47:58] still burning in the hearts of many men
[48:01] you know if you go to a restaurant and
[48:03] they and they bring you out a plate and
[48:05] it's you could tell it's been sitting
[48:08] around for a while since they cooked it
[48:09] and it's something that's supposed to be
[48:11] hot and now they bring it to you and
[48:13] it's already cooled off you wouldn't
[48:15] accept it
[48:16] amen you'd say I didn't come here for
[48:19] lukewarm food I came for food fresh from
[48:22] the oven a man neither is God going to
[48:25] accept lukewarmness from any one of us
[48:28] Amen God is not going to accept a
[48:32] lukewarm offering from any one of us
[48:34] Amen the fire has to be on the altar
[48:38] Amen when when a when a when a young
[48:42] Levite in the Old Testament was growing
[48:45] up to be a to become a priest as his
[48:49] father was a priest his grandfather was
[48:51] a priest as great-grandfather was a
[48:53] priest and they he he was growing up in
[48:55] the and me and the his father would
[48:58] teach him all the ways of the priesthood
[49:01] amen he said and he would then try to
[49:04] impress upon this young man the
[49:06] responsibility of being a priest and
[49:08] that responsibility was is that the
[49:11] people have to be able to come up to the
[49:14] door of the tabernacle with their
[49:16] sacrifice to have their sins taken care
[49:19] of
[49:19] amen and God has placed our
[49:21] responsibility on the priest to make
[49:23] sure that that is always possible a
[49:25] meant that there was always a fire upon
[49:27] the altar Amen that the tools of the
[49:30] sacrifices are always there Amen that
[49:32] there's always wood stacked up there
[49:34] amen there's got to be things taken care
[49:37] of if the the wood pile is dwindling
[49:39] down then the priest needs to go take
[49:41] care of that why because there's got to
[49:44] be fire on the altar so that so that the
[49:46] children of Israel could have their sins
[49:48] taken care of a man so is it true with
[49:51] the Christian there's got to be a fire
[49:53] upon the altar there's gobby wood and
[49:55] material burning material there so that
[49:58] when the Holy Ghost comes by he has
[50:00] something to light the fire of your
[50:01] heart a man and that comes by the
[50:04] reading of the gospel through the
[50:06] praising of the Lord through the washing
[50:08] of the water of the word
[50:09] amen it comes to reading your Bible it
[50:11] comes through worshiping the Lord your
[50:13] God a man I'm bringing to your
[50:15] remembrance the things that God has done
[50:17] for you
[50:17] it comes from rejecting lukewarmness
[50:22] Amen it comes from rejecting the spirit
[50:24] of this age which is lukewarm 'us amen
[50:29] that's how you keep the fire and altar
[50:31] trust me the Lord knows your works just
[50:36] as much as the Lord knows that high
[50:38] priests will that priests young priests
[50:40] work when he goes out to get the work he
[50:42] goes out to get the firewood
[50:43] he knew that priests works hey man there
[50:47] are stories the Old Testament times when
[50:49] the fire went out on the altar amen it
[50:51] wasn't supposed to be that way
[50:53] amen but the fire is supposed to always
[50:55] be on the altar so the people could have
[50:57] a place where they could come for
[50:59] healing so people have a place where
[51:02] they can come for deliverance so the
[51:04] people have a place like come and have
[51:06] their sins
[51:07] hey man jesus said whosoever sins you
[51:11] remit it will be remitted whosoever sins
[51:13] you retain to them everything the the
[51:16] Bride of Christ is the repository of the
[51:19] Holy Ghost upon the earth amen amen when
[51:23] when Solomon dedicated the temple he
[51:25] said Lord God I pray that if anybody
[51:28] come to this temple even if he'd be a
[51:31] stranger to the Land of Israel but if he
[51:33] comes to this temple and has respect to
[51:36] your sacrifice and respect to you I pray
[51:38] that you Lord even though he'd be a
[51:40] stranger that you Lord would hear from
[51:42] heaven and answer his prayer and thus in
[51:48] that temple of God is still here today
[51:50] the temple of solvent
[51:52] we are dedicated when we are baptized in
[51:55] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen
[51:57] we were dedicated the things of the past
[51:59] are behind us and Christ is ahead of us
[52:02] and when we dedicate ourselves under
[52:04] Christ we become a candidate to be the
[52:08] repository for the baptism of the holy
[52:10] ghost where the fire is supposed to be
[52:13] amen let me tell you every baptized
[52:15] Christian has a duty to be filled with
[52:18] the Holy Ghost so that the people this
[52:20] world have a place to come get their
[52:22] sins
[52:22] taking care of that they have a place
[52:24] where they can come meet the Holy Spirit
[52:26] where they have a place where there you
[52:27] can be healed though I can be delivered
[52:29] as the Lord Jesus Christ so that the
[52:31] Spirit of the Lord God is upon me
[52:33] because he has anointed me to bind up
[52:35] the brokenhearted to set the captives
[52:37] free the priest delivers to those that
[52:39] are lost and the Spirit of the Lord God
[52:41] is the one that is upon me and has
[52:43] anointed me to be this as soul as the
[52:45] spirit of living God now come to anoint
[52:47] you to be the same thing and let me tell
[52:50] you that God knows your works God knows
[52:54] your works
[52:55] hey man Jesus Christ came he was
[52:57] faithful to the anointing that was given
[53:00] to him amen but now the anointing is for
[53:03] you he said I know thy works amen and
[53:10] every single one of us God is watching
[53:11] those works you're not saved by that I
[53:14] works but let me tell you it's a great
[53:15] thermostat hey man there's a thermostat
[53:19] it's set for a certain temperature Amen
[53:23] what Sunday or a Friday night when I got
[53:26] home from work I walked into the house
[53:29] and it felt kind of cold in the house I
[53:31] was like it's doesn't feel right in here
[53:35] something's wrong in here is colder than
[53:37] it should be I went to the thermostat
[53:40] and someone had turned it all the way up
[53:41] to 75 degrees but the little reader says
[53:47] there's only 67 now let me tell you a
[53:50] proper thermostat there's two numbers on
[53:52] there there's the number that it should
[53:55] be and the number that it actually is
[53:59] those are the two numbers and let me
[54:02] tell you if your furnace is operating
[54:04] properly or your air-conditioner is
[54:06] operating properly those two numbers are
[54:08] supposed to match why because the number
[54:11] that your house is supposed to be the
[54:13] temperature is supposed to be at and
[54:15] then the thermostat says yes it is
[54:17] actually it the temperature is supposed
[54:18] to be and when those two numbers were or
[54:20] match then the equipment is working
[54:23] properly amen but I if I go up to that
[54:27] and it says 75 degrees is what's
[54:29] supposed to be but it says it's only 67
[54:33] in here well that's an 8
[54:36] degree difference I don't care how that
[54:40] thermostat has program there is nothing
[54:42] in that programming that's going to
[54:43] allow for an eighth degree difference
[54:46] Amen it's the same thing with this Bible
[54:48] there is nothing in this programming
[54:50] that will allow for that big of a
[54:53] difference amen let me tell you God
[54:56] knows your works amen he knows what his
[54:59] Holy Spirit is capable of because the
[55:01] Holy Spirit is the set point amen let me
[55:04] tell you the Holy Spirit is the number
[55:07] on the right Amen it's the number on the
[55:09] right Amen the number on the left is
[55:12] your works the things that you're doing
[55:14] here on the earth and he knows what
[55:15] you're doing
[55:16] amen because the equipment has to be
[55:19] capable to make those numbers match amen
[55:23] so I looked there was an eighth degree
[55:24] difference between those two numbers
[55:27] something was wrong the thermostat was
[55:31] telling my first in the basement you
[55:34] need to heat this house up you need to
[55:37] turn the fire on you need to turn the
[55:41] fire on and I went down there and there
[55:44] was no fire I took the covers off I
[55:47] could see where the little burners are
[55:50] where the fire is supposed to come out
[55:52] it's cold there's no fire in the tubes
[55:55] oh well there's the problem it's not
[55:59] running and you know what and I took a
[56:02] look and there's a little circuit board
[56:03] in there and it's flashing this flashing
[56:05] this flashing a little warning code in
[56:07] there and I I looked at it and all these
[56:10] these little numbers are on the circuit
[56:12] board and I like well I'll bet I can
[56:14] find out what those numbers meet and so
[56:16] I went I asked mr. Google what are these
[56:19] numbers mean and mr. Google told me what
[56:23] those numbers meant I saw I start taking
[56:26] a few things apart tonight and I cleaned
[56:28] some things up and I and I put things
[56:30] back the way they were and all of a
[56:31] sudden I hear this clicking and I start
[56:36] smelling some gas I hear this little
[56:38] torpedo-like engine clicking off as the
[56:40] gas starts coming out of the tubes and
[56:41] also I see a burst of flames and takes
[56:44] off work there was fire in the tubes and
[56:48] the house began to warm up
[56:51] about two hours later I walked by the
[56:53] thermostat and those two numbers were
[56:55] right on target the one match the other
[56:58] there is fire in the furnace again let
[57:02] me tell you if God knows your works the
[57:07] setpoint for your life is the Holy Ghost
[57:14] and we know what the Holy Ghost can do
[57:17] the Holy Ghost has come to this world to
[57:20] change things amen the Holy Ghost has
[57:24] anointed me to preach the gospel to the
[57:27] meat to open the prison to them that are
[57:30] bound amen to release those that are
[57:33] captive amen to that's what the lame
[57:35] might walk so the blind can see amen so
[57:39] though this is the poor that might
[57:40] receive Christ amen so those that are
[57:44] wounded they can bind up their wounds
[57:46] amen so I can be my brother's keeper the
[57:50] Spirit of Lord God is anointing me for
[57:52] this amen and I know I can look at my
[57:56] own self and look at my works do the
[57:58] works that I am doing in my life do they
[58:02] match the capabilities of the Holy Ghost
[58:06] because let me tell you God knows your
[58:08] works God knows your works
[58:12] he is looking the the angel is searching
[58:15] the camp he's looking at the bride
[58:19] because it's been prophesied that in the
[58:21] last days there will be a bride for the
[58:24] Lord Jesus Christ she will be without
[58:26] spot and she'll be without wrinkle
[58:29] amen she'll have oil in her lamp and
[58:32] should be shiny light all the way to the
[58:34] wedding amen that's her duty is to shine
[58:38] light all the way to the wedding
[58:39] according to Matthew 25 amen she has a
[58:42] responsibility to bear that light all
[58:44] the way to the way amen and let me tell
[58:46] you I've come to be about my father's
[58:48] business amen and and so of you amen
[58:53] amen I know thy works and I could see
[58:57] the temperature of your soul amen
[59:01] let me tell you if your works are dead
[59:04] I am not telling you to go out and work
[59:07] more you leave that for the
[59:13] denomination's a mint I am NOT if your
[59:17] works are dead I am not telling you to
[59:20] go out and do more work I am telling you
[59:23] to go meet the Holy Spirit of living God
[59:27] and spend some time face to face with
[59:31] him amen fall in love with Christ
[59:34] because that is your responsibility your
[59:36] responsibility is not to the world your
[59:39] responsibility is to Christ amen Christ
[59:43] will take care of the rest
[59:45] Amen your responsibility is to not be
[59:48] lukewarm towards the world but your
[59:51] responsibility is to watch your
[59:52] lukewarmness towards your husband
[59:54] towards your maker towards the Lord
[59:56] Jesus Christ amen
[59:59] that's your responsibility that's the
[1:00:01] responsibility of every true Christian
[1:00:03] amen - watch that temperature of her
[1:00:06] soul amen
[1:00:14] angel said I bring you tidings of great
[1:00:18] joy when Jesus Christ was coming on the
[1:00:22] earth is that what you told Mary is that
[1:00:25] what they told the the shepherds I bring
[1:00:29] you tidings of great joy I'm bringing
[1:00:32] you a message of great joy peace on
[1:00:36] earth goodwill towards men the heart of
[1:00:41] God is being open towards mankind what a
[1:00:46] promise
[1:00:47] amen amen
[1:00:50] David said he is the glory and the
[1:00:53] lifter up of my head but you don't have
[1:00:57] to be bowed down he is the glory and the
[1:01:00] lifter of your head a man you know I
[1:01:04] bring you tidings of great joy what
[1:01:07] causes joy in a relationship you know
[1:01:12] what really what causes joy in a
[1:01:14] relationship you know because you take a
[1:01:17] husband and wife and when they are
[1:01:20] sweethearts and they couldn't wait to
[1:01:23] get together they couldn't wait to spend
[1:01:26] time one with the other
[1:01:28] but you know when lukewarmness sets in
[1:01:33] all of a sudden that desire begins to
[1:01:38] drift apart really no longer have a
[1:01:41] desire to be one with the other you know
[1:01:44] there's still the same people but now a
[1:01:46] sudden there's a division there a
[1:01:48] separation there where they no longer
[1:01:49] care whether they spend time with each
[1:01:52] other or not there's no more joy in the
[1:01:55] relationship they men you know and
[1:01:58] really in all things in life you know
[1:02:01] you can get satisfaction out of doing
[1:02:04] things for yourself but really joy comes
[1:02:07] when someone does something for you that
[1:02:11] you couldn't do yourself and you can get
[1:02:14] you can be by yourself and get great
[1:02:16] satisfaction but joy really comes from
[1:02:21] something else that someone has done for
[1:02:23] you they may have some ability that God
[1:02:26] has given you or something that you are
[1:02:28] thankful for amen amen so is it true
[1:02:34] with with Christ and the bride you know
[1:02:36] that relationship there's got to be joy
[1:02:38] in that relationship you can't lose
[1:02:40] sight of the things that God has done
[1:02:42] for you
[1:02:43] a man win because let me tell you if you
[1:02:46] lose sight of the guy you have to bring
[1:02:48] up to her year remember it's constantly

[1:04:02] capable of I know that his mercy and
[1:04:04] Grace has shined upon me I know that his
[1:04:07] hand has been on me in my entire life I
[1:04:10] know that he has guided me every day of
[1:04:12] my life through thick and thin amen and
[1:04:15] maybe my own things in my life haven't
[1:04:17] always been easy but I know in whom I
[1:04:19] have believed in and I know what he is
[1:04:22] capable of amen I've committed things up
[1:04:25] into his hands
[1:04:26] amen I know that he has answered my
[1:04:29] prayers and that brings me joy
[1:04:32] amen that gives me a perseverance to
[1:04:35] keep the fire on upon the altar a man
[1:04:38] because I know in the future that more
[1:04:40] things are going to come down life's
[1:04:41] play
[1:04:42] you know more things are going to come
[1:04:45] down in your life's journey some good
[1:04:50] some bad but no matter what he is the
[1:04:53] glory in the lifter of my head a man he
[1:04:57] has brought me tidings of great joy
[1:04:58] that's not a cliche to me a mint a man
[1:05:04] yoen God wanted to have a capital city
[1:05:07] upon the earth he chose Jerusalem called
[1:05:10] it the city of peace and that's quite a
[1:05:13] name for God's capital he could have
[1:05:15] called it the city of power or the city
[1:05:18] of the burning fire or the city of the
[1:05:21] sacrifice for the city of the Lamb all
[1:05:23] those things we decide to call it the
[1:05:25] city of peace amen that's the God that's
[1:05:28] the the end result of of God's presence
[1:05:33] in the land was they bring a great peace
[1:05:36] in the city by not just talking about he
[1:05:41] didn't just name it after the process he
[1:05:43] named it after the end result that
[1:05:45] there'd be a great peace upon the land
[1:05:47] amen and you are that City Amen you are
[1:05:51] the New Jerusalem that has been builded
[1:05:54] as a place for the the presence of the
[1:05:58] Living God to dwell a man it's a city of
[1:06:01] peace by God says I know thy works amen
[1:06:10] and he's searching out the heart of
[1:06:12] every single one of us
[1:06:19] so I love about the story of Adam and
[1:06:22] Eve is God you know he he created Adam
[1:06:26] and and they decide he wanted Adam to be
[1:06:29] the one to name all the animals and so
[1:06:32] he gives Adam a promise he says I want
[1:06:35] you at him to multiply and replenish the
[1:06:41] earth or the Adam was all alone didn't
[1:06:46] Adam come or then God comes he starts
[1:06:48] bringing all of the animals across Adams
[1:06:51] field of view and as he miss her mister
[1:06:56] mister missus monkey walks by and Adam
[1:07:00] named zoomin and then mister missus
[1:07:02] elephant walked by and Adam gives him
[1:07:04] their name and then all the animals
[1:07:06] walked by and Adam begins realize I am
[1:07:09] alone it says and amongst all the
[1:07:12] animals that was not found to help me
[1:07:14] for Adam amen and so and so I'm after a
[1:07:18] they finish all that than God he still
[1:07:21] has to fulfill the promise that he gave
[1:07:23] to Adam to multiply replace here so he
[1:07:26] puts Adam to sleep amen and pulls out of
[1:07:29] Adam's side a rib amen and irony and you
[1:07:35] know he pulls out of Adam everything
[1:07:38] that Eve was Adam wasn't you know and
[1:07:42] but before that everything everything
[1:07:44] was in one a man but God came and he
[1:07:47] pulled out of Adam half of the human
[1:07:51] race God pulled out of Adam half of the
[1:07:59] human race and when he and when Adam
[1:08:04] first set eyes upon this woman
[1:08:08] he says this is flesh of my flesh this
[1:08:12] is bone of my bone she came out of me
[1:08:15] and the Bible says that down all
[1:08:18] throughout history a woman will leave
[1:08:21] her mother and father and she will cling
[1:08:24] to her husband and the two that were
[1:08:27] separated will come back to each other
[1:08:30] and cling the one
[1:08:32] to the other and that's where God
[1:08:34] instituted marriage where the two that
[1:08:37] were the remember when God created Adam
[1:08:40] he created a male and female together
[1:08:42] and one but then God took out of Adam
[1:08:45] everything that was feminine and put it
[1:08:48] in a separate body and then drove them
[1:08:51] right back together to cling back the
[1:08:53] one to the other
[1:08:57] so when cried God did that as a type to
[1:09:01] show you Christ and the bride so when
[1:09:03] Christ was upon the cross he put that
[1:09:06] spear into his side
[1:09:08] out of his side flowed blood and water
[1:09:11] and then Jesus said into thy hands Lord
[1:09:13] I commit my spirit the three things that
[1:09:16] came out of Christ upon the cross blood
[1:09:18] water and spirit so he could take a
[1:09:21] bride that was pulled out Christ upon
[1:09:24] the cross through the blood that you are
[1:09:26] forgiven of your sins you're washed by
[1:09:29] the water of the word you're baptized
[1:09:30] into his name through the water amen and
[1:09:33] then you only what he gives you and
[1:09:35] refills you with the Spirit of the
[1:09:37] Living God what's he doing he is
[1:09:39] bringing you back to himself he pulled
[1:09:42] you out of him he you're in the thought
[1:09:45] of his mind he pulled you out of him and
[1:09:47] you I was thinking about that a while
[1:09:49] back as someone was asking me about my
[1:09:52] Christian walk and what I believed in
[1:09:54] Christ and how what doctrines I believed
[1:09:58] in and I says you know really my
[1:10:00] greatest desire is to be whatever Jesus
[1:10:02] Christ had in his mind when he was dying
[1:10:05] on upon that cross that's what I want to
[1:10:07] be and I will not rest until I can be
[1:10:10] that a man whatever it was that Jesus
[1:10:13] Christ added in his mind when he was
[1:10:15] dying on that cross that's why I want to
[1:10:18] be amen because I believe it's possible
[1:10:23] amen
[1:10:25] we are being drawn back to the side of
[1:10:28] Christ and as our brothers sung the song
[1:10:32] before I got a got up here as we'd come
[1:10:34] right back to his side amen draw me near
[1:10:39] near to thy side
[1:10:48] joy paves that pathway to keep
[1:10:52] lukewarmness out of your relationship
[1:10:56] amen well you know North eNOS prophesied
[1:11:02] of our age was that there would be a
[1:11:05] lack of oil would you read Matthew 25 it
[1:11:12] was prophesied that there are be many
[1:11:14] that would be called there would be many
[1:11:18] that were called to be servants of
[1:11:20] Christ there were many they were called
[1:11:23] to be a part of Christ but they are
[1:11:26] given a very specific duty that they
[1:11:28] were get all of these 10 virgins they
[1:11:31] were called to be ministers at the
[1:11:33] wedding
[1:11:33] amen to minister to do to to do servants
[1:11:37] at the wedding and when they you know
[1:11:39] when they were given these lamps they
[1:11:41] were given a duty to shine light all the
[1:11:43] way to the wedding and then partake of
[1:11:45] the ceremonies amen amen all Tim
[1:11:49] received a lamp and all ten of them had
[1:11:52] a little bit of oil with their lamp but
[1:11:54] there was five of them there were wiser
[1:11:56] than the rest and they thought that you
[1:11:59] know it's possible that we could run out
[1:12:01] of oil so in the case that that does
[1:12:04] happen I have to have another source to
[1:12:07] draw from so that no matter what happens
[1:12:10] if I start to run low on oil
[1:12:12] I can refill my vessel and I can shine
[1:12:16] light all the night long but there were
[1:12:18] five there were more foolish that didn't
[1:12:20] have the forethought to wonder what
[1:12:22] would happen and they didn't they didn't
[1:12:24] have the forethought to make sure that
[1:12:25] their duties could be met every hour of
[1:12:28] the watch every hour of the night and
[1:12:31] they even though that oil in their lamp
[1:12:34] they didn't bring extra in case they ran
[1:12:37] out amen
[1:12:40] and so as the parable goes in Matthew 25
[1:12:44] says they all fell asleep that all of a
[1:12:46] sudden of shot went out a voice cried
[1:12:49] out that the bridegroom was coming a man
[1:12:53] at the end of the age at the end of the
[1:12:55] time the bridegroom was coming to bring
[1:12:58] him out call him out to the wedding and
[1:13:00] so they
[1:13:02] goes up and they began to prepare their
[1:13:04] lamps so that they could do what they
[1:13:05] were called to do in the age that they
[1:13:08] were at living it amen but as five of
[1:13:12] them that all their lamps had gone out
[1:13:14] and five of them said well all just my
[1:13:18] vessels getting a little low here I can
[1:13:21] just I have a source that I can draw
[1:13:23] from it's always by my side I can always
[1:13:26] reach out and and just pull from that
[1:13:29] source and I can refill my vessel amen
[1:13:32] the flows that were foolish they begin
[1:13:34] to realize their lamps were gone out and
[1:13:37] they had nowhere to go
[1:13:40] here the bridegroom is coming it's time
[1:13:44] for him to do exactly what they are
[1:13:46] called to do but because they were
[1:13:48] dilatory they were lukewarm their mind
[1:13:52] wasn't upon making sure that there could
[1:13:56] be fire upon the lamp like that high
[1:13:58] priests or that priest young priest
[1:13:59] making sure there's firewood at the
[1:14:01] office and the fire went out they were
[1:14:05] called foolish because they didn't know
[1:14:08] where their second source was you know
[1:14:11] all of us has a little bit of
[1:14:12] religiosity about them a little bit of a
[1:14:16] little bit of something that brings us
[1:14:19] to church here every Sunday every
[1:14:20] Wednesday something that makes us want
[1:14:22] to follow Christ a little bit but
[1:14:25] there's got to be that connection that
[1:14:27] source that if you're if you begin to
[1:14:30] get a little lukewarm and your walk
[1:14:32] towards Christ you have to have a place
[1:14:34] that you can go to refill your lamp to
[1:14:39] have a refilling of the Holy Ghost amen
[1:14:41] it ought to be a well beaten path so
[1:14:46] that anytime just like in a marriage
[1:14:47] just like it's your work just like
[1:14:49] anywhere that when you begin to fill
[1:14:51] yourself cooling off and your mission
[1:14:54] cooling off and the thing that you want
[1:14:56] cooling off in the and your in your your
[1:15:00] main goals in life that you can run back
[1:15:05] and refill your desire again in
[1:15:09] Christianity that's by being a refill
[1:15:12] with the Holy Ghost amen you know where
[1:15:15] the altar
[1:15:16] it's a well beaten path for you you know
[1:15:19] who your source is and this is the Holy
[1:15:21] Spirit he can restore the joy of your
[1:15:24] salvation amen God can restore if you've
[1:15:30] gotten lukewarm in your Christian walk
[1:15:32] God can restore the joy of your
[1:15:35] salvation and bring back to your
[1:15:37] remembrance why you got married to
[1:15:40] Christ in the first place amen
[1:15:44] why you got married to Christ in the
[1:15:46] first place and you know when I when I
[1:15:49] go to a church various churches to
[1:15:51] preach I always have in mind that there
[1:15:53] are those that are going to that church
[1:15:55] that the only reason they're there is
[1:15:57] because they grew up there
[1:15:59] there's gut there's never been that
[1:16:02] first fire Amen there's never been that
[1:16:06] original fire so they don't actually
[1:16:08] know it's just a religion to them and
[1:16:11] the world is filled with churches on
[1:16:13] every corner they're filled with people
[1:16:15] they're only going to church because
[1:16:17] their mother's told them they should
[1:16:18] come to church their father's told them
[1:16:20] they should come to church or they're
[1:16:22] just afraid of Hell or they're just
[1:16:23] afraid of this but that first fire has
[1:16:26] never been lit upon the altar they don't
[1:16:29] have the joy of their salvation amen let
[1:16:32] me tell you it's never been revealed to
[1:16:34] them what Christ has done for them amen
[1:16:38] and it's the ministers duty to bring
[1:16:40] that revelation it's the minister's duty
[1:16:43] to open up the channel for that relevant
[1:16:45] revelation to come amen but the
[1:16:48] atmosphere might be just right
[1:16:51] amen why so when Christ comes when the
[1:16:54] bridegroom cometh there's fire upon the
[1:16:58] altar there's a place for people who
[1:17:01] come have their sins taken care of
[1:17:03] amen now Isaiah 60:1 I want to read that
[1:17:07] this is what Jesus quoted from this
[1:17:09] scroll when he was in the temple from
[1:17:11] the Old Testament scroll when Jesus set
[1:17:13] up he said reading from the scroll he
[1:17:17] said the Spirit of the Lord God is upon
[1:17:19] me because the LORD hath anointed me to
[1:17:22] preach good tidings under the meat he
[1:17:25] has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted
[1:17:27] to proclaim Liberty to the captives
[1:17:30] and the opening of the prison to them
[1:17:32] that are bound to proclaim the
[1:17:35] acceptable year of the Lord amen
[1:17:40] also in verse 3 it says to appoint unto
[1:17:43] them that mourn in Zion to give unto
[1:17:46] them beauty for Ashes he ever been
[1:17:49] burned in this life Christ has come to
[1:17:52] give beauty for Ashes amen the oil of
[1:17:56] joy for mourning the Bible says those
[1:17:59] that are crying God will answer their
[1:18:02] cry Amen those that mourn shall be
[1:18:04] healed amen the garment of praise to
[1:18:08] replace or for the spirit of heaviness
[1:18:12] so if you have a spirit of heaviness
[1:18:14] about you
[1:18:15] God has a garment of praise to give you
[1:18:17] a man-bag comes through restoring joy
[1:18:21] bringing back the joy that you once had
[1:18:24] or maybe you never did have amen amen so
[1:18:28] that when Christ comes you're not one of
[1:18:31] those it's called lukewarm upon the
[1:18:33] earth
[1:18:46] you know a lack of oil you think about a
[1:18:48] car you're a cart you can not change
[1:18:52] your oil for a long time you can get by
[1:18:54] for a while but you know if your your
[1:18:56] engine all sudden will get to the point
[1:18:58] where running one degree hotter used to
[1:19:01] two degrees hotter five degrees hotter
[1:19:05] the bearings are starting to heat up and
[1:19:08] all of a sudden those bearings that are
[1:19:11] have a maximum temperature that they're
[1:19:13] supposed to operate it and a few and the
[1:19:16] engine has an oil pump that keeps
[1:19:18] pumping oil through the engine and it
[1:19:20] keeps this flow of oil going through
[1:19:22] those bearings so if the bearings always
[1:19:25] have fresh oil fresh oil fresh oil but
[1:19:28] as your oil begins to get old it doesn't
[1:19:32] take away the heat it doesn't lubricate
[1:19:34] as much and the bearings begin to heat
[1:19:36] up a little bit more a little bit more a
[1:19:37] little bit more they're all sudden they
[1:19:39] begin to cross that threshold the
[1:19:41] engineers that said this bearing will
[1:19:44] operate properly until it gets to this
[1:19:45] temperature and then the steel begins to
[1:19:48] degrade and awesome they don't work
[1:19:50] anymore and it gets to a point it's the
[1:19:52] point of no return amen the bearings are
[1:19:56] overheating the engine will never be the
[1:19:59] same again
[1:20:00] amen and so when the Christian begins to
[1:20:04] run out of oil she has a duty to get
[1:20:07] that constant refreshment of the oil of
[1:20:09] the Holy Ghost amen if you're lose your
[1:20:12] temper if you're getting hot all the
[1:20:14] time you have a responsibility to run
[1:20:17] back to the altar if you lose if you
[1:20:19] realize your gain lukewarm if you lose
[1:20:21] your joy you have a responsibility to
[1:20:23] come back to Christ to the restoring joy
[1:20:27] a man just here in closing let's turn
[1:20:30] over to first Peter chapter 4
[1:20:59] we'll read the first verse here in first
[1:21:04] Peter for Peter talking about the
[1:21:07] Christian life
[1:21:09] he says for as much then as Christ has
[1:21:14] suffered for us in the flesh arm
[1:21:18] yourselves likewise with the same mind
[1:21:22] for he that has suffered in the flesh as
[1:21:25] ceased from sin amen we all have the
[1:21:28] same mind to suffer the things of life
[1:21:31] just like Christ said why because of the
[1:21:33] joy that is set before us let's go down
[1:21:36] to the the eighth thing the eighth verse
[1:21:41] it says and above all things have
[1:21:45] fervent charity among yourselves for
[1:21:48] charity shall cover the multitude of
[1:21:51] sins by fervent charity amongst
[1:21:55] yourselves
[1:21:57] why would you have that because of the
[1:22:00] potential for lukewarmness in the church
[1:22:02] hey man when when the oil begins to
[1:22:05] leave the church and all sudden the
[1:22:07] members of the church start bumping in
[1:22:09] one to the other one person says this to
[1:22:12] so-and-so and so-and-so says this to
[1:22:14] so-and-so people begin to get offended
[1:22:16] why because they're Luke lukewarmness
[1:22:19] assailing in the church things are
[1:22:21] cooling off the engines are overheating
[1:22:23] and men can no longer be what they're
[1:22:26] called to be but what if you have
[1:22:28] fervent charity one for the other then
[1:22:31] that love will be like the oil it'll
[1:22:33] cover a multitude of sins then when your
[1:22:36] brother bumps into you your steps on
[1:22:37] your toes then you can have loved one
[1:22:40] for the other well brother so-and-so he
[1:22:42] didn't mean that he's just going through
[1:22:44] a hard time or he just has mendler from
[1:22:46] such-and-such yet
[1:22:47] amen then you have room you make room
[1:22:50] for one another and for each other's
[1:22:52] mistakes Amen why because you yourself
[1:22:55] have rejected lukewarmness and you have
[1:22:58] oil within yourselves so that you don't
[1:23:01] respond when someone else is not
[1:23:03] responding properly
[1:23:05] amen amen when the Holy Ghost first came
[1:23:09] upon the Gentiles that came upon a man
[1:23:12] that was cost
[1:23:14] certainly praying and seeking the face
[1:23:15] of the law always Cornelius in Acts
[1:23:18] chapter 10 was the man when the Gentile
[1:23:21] of the holy ghost was first poured out
[1:23:23] on the Gentiles it was God had a choice
[1:23:26] of who he could pour out his Spirit upon
[1:23:29] the Gentiles first God had a decision to
[1:23:33] make where should I pour out my Holy
[1:23:35] Ghost upon the Gentiles and he looked
[1:23:37] upon all the Gentiles and he found
[1:23:40] Cornelius say hey God had a choice he
[1:23:46] chose Cornelius God has a choice today
[1:23:50] who to refill with the Holy Ghost God
[1:23:53] has a choice today of who should be the
[1:23:56] burning fire in our city the the the the
[1:24:00] altar where people can come and have
[1:24:03] their sins taken care of the altar where
[1:24:05] the fire is already burning the priest
[1:24:07] has already woken up early he's got the
[1:24:10] the wood stack already going he's got
[1:24:13] the fire upon the altar and everybody
[1:24:16] can come to the where the Lamb sacrifice
[1:24:18] is have their sins taken care of I don't
[1:24:20] care if they're a Hindu I don't care if
[1:24:22] they're a Muslim I don't care if they're
[1:24:24] a homosexual I don't care who they are
[1:24:25] they there's a place in this city that
[1:24:28] they can come and have their sins taken
[1:24:30] care of because there's a people who
[1:24:32] have a fire upon the altar Amen God has
[1:24:36] a choice of who he can bring the hurt
[1:24:39] and the lost - God has a choice of who
[1:24:42] he can bring those that need salvation -
[1:24:45] a man who who in the city God look upon
[1:24:49] the city and there are those that are
[1:24:51] wounded those that are crying out to God
[1:24:53] oh lord save me O Lord deliver me but
[1:24:56] there's gotta be someone that he God has
[1:24:58] already prepared who can stand up and
[1:25:01] say the Spirit of the Lord God is upon
[1:25:02] me because he has anointed me to bind up
[1:25:05] the brokenhearted there though anointed
[1:25:07] me to set loose those there in captivity
[1:25:09] and anointed to pour in the salva pond
[1:25:13] the wounds amen to show Christ to the
[1:25:16] world amen but it can't be those that
[1:25:19] are lukewarm they'll never show that
[1:25:21] Amen why because they can't show
[1:25:23] anything they're too worried about their
[1:25:26] own
[1:25:26] to help anybody else because their own
[1:25:30] life as a mess because they've drifted
[1:25:33] away from the love the fire of the
[1:25:36] gospel so how can they ever help someone
[1:25:39] else when they haven't even helped
[1:25:41] themselves yet that's not supposed to be
[1:25:43] with the Bride of Christ she is here to
[1:25:47] partner with Christ to be that spouse
[1:25:51] don't you love it when you and your
[1:25:52] spouse do something together you have a
[1:25:55] chore or something to do that are on the
[1:25:57] house and you do it together amen are
[1:25:59] you going you you witness together amen
[1:26:02] isn't that the greatest joy in the world
[1:26:04] when you get to do something like that
[1:26:06] together amen amen
[1:26:12] so is the splits supposed to be with
[1:26:14] Christ and his bride to minister to the
[1:26:17] city together amen but if the
[1:26:20] lukewarmness is there then the two don't
[1:26:22] connect the husband and the bride don't
[1:26:25] connect because you've become lukewarm
[1:26:28] amen and how can you work together you
[1:26:31] would rather be apart we in that
[1:26:34] situation ma because that's what happens
[1:26:37] when lukewarmness sets in the
[1:26:39] relationship you would rather be
[1:26:41] somewhere else than in each other's
[1:26:43] presents why but let the fire come back
[1:26:47] to the altar just once I let it restore
[1:26:50] the joy of your salvation then all of a
[1:26:53] sudden you love being together again
[1:26:54] then you can go out and be about your
[1:26:57] father's business and then you can stand
[1:26:59] up and be that ambassador of Christ in
[1:27:01] the city amen amen
[1:27:05] let's just stand
[1:27:11] amen we have a responsibility and an age
[1:27:16] that was prophesied to be lukewarm we
[1:27:20] have a responsibility to be the one that
[1:27:23] has overcome that Christ said I give up
[1:27:26] to the overcomer though to sit with me
[1:27:28] in my throne and the two shall be one
[1:27:32] Paul said don't you know the Saints
[1:27:34] shall judge the earth amen
[1:27:37] what because she will be with him about
[1:27:39] his business even over in the judgement
[1:27:42] they'll be sitting together upon the
[1:27:44] throne but that's just Bauer has a word
[1:27:49] for heavenly father when hot things
[1:27:53] become cold
[1:27:55] we call it lukewarm Lord and when in a
[1:27:59] church that is supposed to be the
[1:28:01] repository of the Holy Ghost in the city
[1:28:03] is becomes too worried about their own
[1:28:06] selves they can no longer take care of
[1:28:08] the other person's needs you say Lord I
[1:28:12] know your works I've examined the
[1:28:15] temperature I know that the setpoint is
[1:28:17] the Holy Ghost but the bride is not
[1:28:21] operating at temperature the temperature
[1:28:25] in the house of God is supposed to be on
[1:28:28] fire for Christ to fill that radiant
[1:28:32] warmth from the fire of the altar but if
[1:28:37] the heart has grown cold how can the
[1:28:40] city feel the warmth Lord you said I'll
[1:28:45] set a seal a mark upon those that sigh
[1:28:49] and cry for the abominations that are
[1:28:51] done in the city there's got to be
[1:28:54] someone that has the answer there's got
[1:28:56] to be someone that is not worried about
[1:28:58] bringing this doctrine or or that

[1:29:23] be on fire
