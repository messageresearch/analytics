[26:47] from the third chapter
[26:49] of philippians we'll read the 14 through
[26:52] the 16th verses
[27:04] and it reads i press toward the mark for
[27:07] the prize of the high calling of god in
[27:10] christ jesus
[27:12] let us therefore as many as be perfect
[27:15] be thus minded
[27:17] and if it any thing ye be otherwise
[27:20] minded god shall reveal it even this
[27:23] unto you
[27:25] nevertheless where unto whereto we have
[27:29] already obtained
[27:31] let us walk by the same rule and let us
[27:34] mine the same things
[27:36] i'm going to read the same scripture
[27:38] philippians 3 14 through 16 by another
[27:41] version i want you to listen closely
[27:44] i will pursue as my goal the prize
[27:47] promised by god's heavenly call in
[27:50] christ jesus
[27:51] therefore let us us who
[27:54] are mature think this way
[27:57] and if you think differently about
[27:59] anything
[28:00] god will reveal this also to you
[28:04] in any case
[28:05] we should live up to whatever truth
[28:08] we have obtained
[28:13] i love that 16th verse
[28:16] in any case
[28:18] we should live up to whatever truth
[28:21] we have attained
[28:23] let us pray
[28:26] our gracious father god we thank you for
[28:28] your grace and your mercy
[28:30] lord we did not come here lord to be a
[28:33] pleaser of men
[28:35] but father god we've come oh god to hear
[28:38] from you and that we may speak
[28:40] whatever you would have us to speak
[28:43] forgive us for anything we may say
[28:47] oh lord that is not according to your
[28:49] will
[28:50] but i pray that you would give us grace
[28:52] to move completely out of your way
[28:54] that you would have full utterance here
[28:56] tonight we thank you lord jesus for your
[28:59] amazing grace
[29:01] because no man in himself is worthy to
[29:04] stand at this holy and sacred place
[29:07] but by your grace god and by your mercy
[29:10] you have a need to be here tonight
[29:12] and so therefore lord god we want to
[29:14] give our best our all our all to you
[29:19] and so therefore lord jesus have full
[29:21] course
[29:22] bless your people according to your
[29:24] divine will
[29:25] in your lovely name jesus christ we pray
[29:28] amen
[29:29] you may be seated
[29:35] i'm sure that everybody here tonight
[29:37] understand investing
[29:40] because we all do it one way or another
[29:42] on a low level or a great level
[29:45] but when we invest we always put
[29:47] something in to get something more out
[29:49] of it
[29:50] that's why we teach our children how to
[29:53] read how to write how to do math and all
[29:55] these things because we invest in them
[29:57] we invest education and you can
[29:59] sometimes invest money and other things
[30:01] that you may invest but the purpose of
[30:03] investing is to uh gain to earn more
[30:08] than what you've previously had or
[30:10] started out with
[30:13] we know some
[30:15] great men of god
[30:17] i would say one in particular
[30:19] every time i think about job i think
[30:21] about how he was a great investor
[30:24] the bible doesn't tell us all that he
[30:26] did to gain the wealth and the riches
[30:27] that he had but one of the things that
[30:29] we do know is that he feared god
[30:32] he did what amen the psalmist say you
[30:34] know this is the beginning of wisdom to
[30:36] fear god and keep his commandment
[30:38] and so job was a fear of god he was a
[30:41] man of integrity and he invested his
[30:43] entire life into god so much so that all
[30:46] the villagers all the people around his
[30:48] area understood him as to be a holy man
[30:52] we know the tragedy the things that
[30:54] happened to job job had to be tested
[30:57] like we all do
[30:59] we will be tested
[31:01] what you love the most most of who you
[31:03] love the most
[31:04] and i think job was tested perhaps
[31:07] greater in a way greater than any man
[31:09] that i know outside of jesus christ
[31:11] himself
[31:12] but because he did righteous before god
[31:15] god prospered that man and that man
[31:17] always kept god as his focus
[31:20] he never looked at his wealth
[31:22] in so much so that when god took it from
[31:25] him he said the lord giveth and the lord
[31:27] taketh away blessed be the name of the
[31:29] lord now job was not a man just
[31:33] speaking words but he meant those things
[31:35] from his heart
[31:37] there was another great man that was
[31:39] great in this world and it was the rich
[31:41] young ruler it doesn't tell us how
[31:43] wealth how wealthy he was but the bible
[31:45] said he was very rich he really got rich
[31:48] and he as as and and when when he went
[31:50] down uh when jesus went down
[31:53] the the list of things that
[31:56] a righteous man should do uh this rich
[31:59] young ruler says lord i have done all
[32:01] these things for my youth
[32:03] so so you understand if you do the will
[32:05] of god you will prosper
[32:08] doing the will of god whether you be a
[32:10] sinner or saint if you do the will of
[32:12] god you will prosper
[32:17] and god will teach you
[32:19] how to invest
[32:21] you all know that right
[32:23] he taught jacob how to do it
[32:26] and jacob followed the leading of the
[32:29] lord and he became a wealthy man
[32:32] so when you find the will of god and you
[32:34] walk in the will of god god will prosper
[32:38] you
[32:41] but we understand that these things on
[32:43] earth are great but we also know that
[32:44] they're about to perish
[32:47] you and i know that uh the world has
[32:49] gotten
[32:50] [Music]
[32:52] i would say
[32:54] almost 10 times worse than it was since
[32:57] 9 11.
[32:59] uh according to when if you judge
[33:01] america and what she looked like and
[33:04] before 9 11 she almost looked like a
[33:07] christian nation
[33:09] but now um we know she looks like
[33:11] nothing of the sort she has gone beyond
[33:16] uh deliverance
[33:18] this country will never come back and i
[33:20] know everybody's hoping that it will
[33:23] satan has a real trick up his sleeve
[33:28] but one thing i wanted to bring
[33:29] everybody attentions to is that in
[33:32] in this massive
[33:34] time of chaos
[33:37] we must understand why we're here
[33:41] uh god is ordained us
[33:44] amen to to be a light
[33:47] in this dark generation
[33:50] just the other day i was at the atm at
[33:53] my bank and i was uh uh withdrawing uh
[33:58] checking my balance is what i was doing
[34:00] and uh
[34:02] didn't realize there was another man
[34:03] behind me but i know he couldn't have
[34:05] been there long
[34:06] so when i got everything out and
[34:09] took my car started driving my car he
[34:11] bumped his horn and i thought maybe i
[34:13] left something in the machine or
[34:14] something so i got out of the car and he
[34:16] literally cursed me out
[34:20] and the more he cursed me the thing that
[34:22] came out of my mouth
[34:24] was wonderful i kept saying well god
[34:27] bless you
[34:28] god bless you
[34:30] god bless you
[34:32] and then i said sir i could not go i
[34:35] couldn't go no faster than the machine
[34:38] would allow me to
[34:40] well
[34:41] i was surprised
[34:44] and after i drove around the building a
[34:48] scripture came to my mind bless those
[34:50] that curse you
[34:52] i wasn't thinking that
[34:55] but the god in me that wrote it
[34:57] was the god who spoke out god bless you
[35:01] and when i went beyond the building i
[35:03] began to pray
[35:06] for the man and says lord
[35:08] he more than likely have had
[35:10] a rough day
[35:13] be merciful to
[35:14] him you see we are
[35:17] lady grace
[35:20] we're the ones who if there's going to
[35:21] be any grace
[35:23] god has ordained us to give grace and
[35:26] grace is unmerited
[35:29] it's not something you you earn it's
[35:32] something people give you because they
[35:34] desire to give you god gave us grace
[35:36] because he desired to give us grace
[35:39] there's nothing we did and have done oh
[35:42] god could do to earn his grace
[35:45] nor his mercy
[35:48] my subject tonight is failing to invest
[35:52] we have a powerful message
[35:55] and i'm not talking about my message i'm
[35:57] talking about the message of malachi 4.
[36:01] god sent us a prophet with a powerful
[36:04] message
[36:06] but instead of being concerned about the
[36:08] message
[36:10] we're more concerned about ourselves
[36:14] and we fail to see that we're in a time
[36:17] when the world is getting ready to fall
[36:21] even noah preach it's going to rain it's
[36:23] going to rain it's going to rain and the
[36:25] scientist says but there's no water up
[36:27] there
[36:29] they couldn't see what god could see
[36:33] because everything is dimensional
[36:36] and i'm telling you now that the fire is
[36:38] about to fall
[36:41] hello
[36:42] the fire is going to fall
[36:45] amen
[36:47] and you and i must be aware that we do
[36:49] not know the time
[36:51] that is going to fall
[36:55] but it behooves us
[36:58] to make ready
[37:00] and to make sure
[37:02] that the treasure that we're building
[37:05] is building in heaven
[37:07] is that right
[37:08] that's what the bible says sexual
[37:10] affection on things above
[37:13] now that doesn't mean you can't become
[37:15] great in this world but i'm trying to
[37:17] tell you if you do it's going to be
[37:19] short-lived
[37:22] amen
[37:23] and you and i you said well brother
[37:24] because you don't know the day and hour
[37:26] but the messenger told us no we don't
[37:29] know the hour nor do we know the day but
[37:31] one thing for certain god gave us the
[37:34] season and this is the season
[37:39] that god is getting ready to sin the
[37:41] fire
[37:43] watch the political realm
[37:46] everybody's poking the bear
[37:48] right is that right you got china over
[37:51] here you got you got russia over there
[37:53] and everybody's forgetting about the
[37:55] purple curtain
[37:57] and they fail to see it's the purple
[37:59] curtain
[38:00] it's the wizard behind behind the
[38:03] the curtain the man behind the curtain
[38:06] he's the one that's operating everything
[38:10] nobody sees him nobody knows he's a he's
[38:14] been i know it because years ago i saw
[38:16] it in the paper i saw it on the news he
[38:20] called everybody together all of his
[38:22] businessmen and everybody together and
[38:24] they met there in rome and since then
[38:27] the world has been falling apart
[38:31] they wonder why certain people can't be
[38:33] touched
[38:34] it's because they've been ordained
[38:37] y'all understand what i'm saying
[38:39] god ordained the good and the evil
[38:42] and what they fail to see is that this
[38:44] is judgment
[38:46] people say oh yeah it's going to get
[38:47] better no no no no no evil seducers
[38:51] shall wax worse and worse and what we're
[38:54] seeing is a group of people that really
[38:56] think they're doing righteously when
[38:58] they're doing evil amen that's true
[39:02] amen you said that's not possible ask
[39:05] judas
[39:06] ask judas judas thought he was doing
[39:08] good
[39:10] when he was doing evil
[39:14] see you and i must understand that we're
[39:16] living in the parable of matthew 25
[39:19] where there were five wise and five
[39:21] foolish
[39:24] foolish virgins they they did whatever
[39:26] they were dilatory they they just did
[39:28] whatever they wanted to do they did not
[39:30] take the calling seriously
[39:33] until
[39:35] it was too late
[39:39] like brother adam said in the days of
[39:41] noah
[39:43] before one drop of rain fell noah was in
[39:46] the ark
[39:48] and he says once the rain began to fall
[39:50] it's too late
[39:52] and see that's what people don't
[39:53] understand they don't understand once
[39:55] the council of churches begin to move
[39:58] amen it's too late
[40:02] yes sir
[40:04] it's too late
[40:06] and we fail to see that even then the
[40:09] door is shut
[40:12] cry all you want to moan all you want to
[40:15] that's all you want to but this is your
[40:17] time to invest
[40:22] hallelujah
[40:25] he talked about it there in matthew 25
[40:27] but listen what he says in matthew 25
[40:29] 14-30 just bear with me for a moment
[40:36] for the kingdom of heaven is as a man
[40:38] traveling into a far country
[40:41] who called his own servants
[40:44] and delivered unto them his goods
[40:48] and unto one he gave five talents
[40:51] to another two
[40:52] to another one
[40:54] to every man according to his ser
[40:57] several ability
[40:58] and straightway took his journey
[41:02] then he that had received five talents
[41:06] went and traded with the same and made
[41:09] them
[41:10] other five talents
[41:12] and likewise he that had received two he
[41:16] also gained other two
[41:18] listen this is where i'm going
[41:21] but he that had received one
[41:25] went
[41:25] and digged in the earth and hid his
[41:29] lord's money
[41:36] come by the truth
[41:40] with no money
[41:43] and what people fail to see is what
[41:45] we've been doing around this message
[41:49] brother branham said you know we're not
[41:51] parakeets
[41:54] and he said we all you know what
[41:55] paragraphs do repeat just say without
[41:58] revelation just say what he said but
[42:02] even the message
[42:04] has a revelation behind it
[42:07] and you can not receive the revelation
[42:11] of the messages that william branham
[42:13] preached when you're carnal minded
[42:16] you can't read it like a book or
[42:18] newspaper or anything like that you have
[42:21] to have the revelation
[42:24] god has revealed to you what brother
[42:27] branham he said why do you think so many
[42:29] people have fallen away
[42:32] amen because they studied it in their
[42:34] minds
[42:35] they thought they could know god in
[42:37] their minds
[42:38] but the revelation i'm talking about can
[42:40] only strike the heart
[42:43] and that revelation when it strikes your
[42:45] heart it changes you
[42:49] hallelujah
[42:51] not in a bad way but in a good way
[42:54] you become more like him
[42:58] hallelujah
[43:00] right
[43:01] oh but he that had received one went
[43:05] and dig the earth and hid his lord's
[43:08] money and that's what people are doing
[43:10] that's what we've done instead of
[43:12] investing it out in the communities
[43:14] investing out everywhere you can invest
[43:16] it you know we did it we just kept it to
[43:18] ourselves
[43:20] we were afraid
[43:22] we were afraid we weren't even afraid if
[43:24] god would give us some revelation of the
[43:27] message we would be afraid of it
[43:29] why
[43:30] when brother branham said that the seven
[43:32] seals was like five rockets that went up
[43:34] in the air and out of those five rockets
[43:37] it exploded and five more came out of it
[43:40] what was he saying that the message that
[43:42] i have laid out on tapes and books are
[43:45] pr is progressive it'll constantly
[43:47] unfold unfold as it goes up
[43:51] but we're so afraid
[43:55] so we bury it
[43:58] and after a long time the lord of those
[44:01] servants cometh and reckon with them
[44:04] and so he that has received five talents
[44:07] came and brought other five talents
[44:09] saying lord
[44:11] thou delivered unto me five talents
[44:13] behold i have gained besides them five
[44:15] talents more
[44:17] now listen what he says in the 21st
[44:20] verse he said his laws said unto him why
[44:23] would he say this now because it's got
[44:25] to be the end time he's working with the
[44:27] rapture he's working with god seeing
[44:29] your position just prior to the rapture
[44:32] the changing of the body he says well
[44:35] done thou good and faithful servant
[44:39] thou hast been faithful over a few
[44:41] things i will make thee ruler over many
[44:44] things enter thou into the joys of the
[44:47] lord
[44:50] huh you understand what i'm saying
[44:53] this is something god is doing
[44:55] now
[44:56] it is what we're supposed to be doing
[44:59] now
[45:00] and i think to myself one thing about
[45:02] the pentecostals they entered into the
[45:04] pentecostal anointing they got speaking
[45:07] in tongues they got shouting they got
[45:09] dancing they got all of those gifts that
[45:11] came with it because they entered into
[45:13] the anointing of their age
[45:16] what about this age
[45:19] the anointing of this age is to produce
[45:22] sons and daughters of god
[45:24] bone of his bone flesh of his flesh
[45:27] hallelujah walk like him talk like him
[45:29] act like and pray like him sing like him
[45:32] everything he did you and i are supposed
[45:34] to be doing now
[45:37] and the only way we can achieve that is
[45:40] to lay in the presence of the son
[45:43] brother said when he before went off the
[45:45] scene he said we're here
[45:47] basically he said the eagles are here
[45:49] the weed is here but it's just green
[45:53] and it needs to lay in the presence of
[45:55] the sun to be ripened that don't mean
[45:58] lay in the presence of the sun when you
[45:59] come to church
[46:01] that's every day
[46:04] you should lay in that word lay in there
[46:07] if you don't need understanding you
[46:09] ought to ask god for the understanding
[46:12] lord show me in this message what you're
[46:14] trying to get me to see and understand
[46:21] that's why we don't see the joy
[46:23] there's no joy
[46:29] everybody expect the preachers to have
[46:31] all the joy
[46:34] no
[46:36] you are the joy ought to be hitting me
[46:37] from the pulpit here
[46:42] where is the joy yes we do go through
[46:45] trials
[46:47] hallelujah but even as the psalmist said
[46:50] weeping may endure for a night but joy
[46:52] comes in the morning this sadness and
[46:55] everything it's just a temporal thing
[46:57] it's something we all go through at
[46:59] times but when you
[47:01] wake up and
[47:02] and pinch yourself
[47:04] the joy this is what you're gonna
[47:06] understand when satan can get you sad
[47:09] and he can see you singing the blues he
[47:11] just stole your strength
[47:13] for the joy of the lord is your strength
[47:19] he also then received two talents came
[47:22] and said lord thou delivereth unto me
[47:24] remember i'm telling you this now
[47:27] here it is these five wives and four or
[47:29] five foolish amen they went in and five
[47:32] wives went into the door there was only
[47:35] one door and that door is jesus christ
[47:38] he's the sheep shepherd of the sheepfold
[47:40] y'all understand me you got to go into
[47:43] him and he must come into you
[47:46] this is a this is a time of an invisible
[47:48] union
[47:49] but listen you can't tell me oh i jesus
[47:52] christ is my lord jesus christ is my
[47:54] husband jesus christ and i said where is
[47:56] he and there is nothing no proof in your
[47:58] life
[48:00] just a church member
[48:02] then how can i believe that he's
[48:04] connected to you if i don't see the size
[48:07] and he said these signs shall follow
[48:09] them that believe in my name they should
[48:11] cast out devils y'all know what i'm
[48:13] saying there's got to be vindication in
[48:16] this bride
[48:17] hallelujah and you should never stop
[48:20] until god approves you and say now here
[48:23] you are
[48:26] we've got to keep moving
[48:29] this thing is you know i know brother
[48:31] said in the last days we'll be slugging
[48:32] along but i'm telling you slug
[48:36] at least look
[48:37] you know
[48:38] if you're going to move slow move but
[48:40] move forward
[48:42] don't stand still
[48:45] listen what the problem is we're looking
[48:47] at too many things
[48:49] you know that's what happened to peter
[48:50] says lord if the
[48:52] you bid me come walking on the water
[48:54] y'all understand he is walking uh his
[48:56] circumstances
[48:58] they are under his feet
[49:00] he's lord of his circumstances
[49:03] hallelujah but the moment he took his
[49:05] eyes off jesus he began to sink
[49:08] and as you've heard before jesus wasn't
[49:11] a million miles away nor was he five
[49:13] feet away he was right there in armed
[49:15] distance
[49:17] because when jesus when peter says lord
[49:19] save me jesus reached out and pulled him
[49:21] up
[49:24] a lot of times we give up right at the
[49:26] time when he we almost
[49:28] there almost there
[49:32] hallelujah
[49:35] hallelujah
[49:36] his lord said unto him well done good
[49:39] and faithful servant
[49:40] thou has been faithful over a few things
[49:43] and i will make the ruler over many
[49:45] things
[49:46] enter thou into the joys of thy lord and
[49:49] you know what the lord just showed me
[49:51] you know many times we don't like to be
[49:52] rejected and we don't tell people about
[49:54] the truth because we're afraid to be
[49:56] rejected hello if they did it in the
[49:58] green tree they're going to do it in the
[50:00] dry
[50:01] this message is not going to be received
[50:03] by the majority of the people
[50:05] we need to grow up
[50:07] and be mature
[50:09] hallelujah you got something good like i
[50:12] said down in iowa city all of a sudden
[50:14] you come out of your front your in uh
[50:16] your your house and in the front yard
[50:18] you got your and i said i don't do pink
[50:21] well you know
[50:23] but there's a big pink cadillac out in
[50:25] front of my car in my house and the man
[50:27] says this is yours
[50:31] guess what
[50:32] all of a sudden my my my uh thoughts
[50:35] about pink has changed
[50:39] i might paint it over later
[50:42] but that's my pink car you understand me
[50:45] and guess what for the moment i'm gonna
[50:47] ride around in it
[50:49] i'm gonna go to everybody's house and
[50:51] look what i've got
[50:53] free
[50:55] and the gospel is greater than a pink
[50:57] cadillac
[50:59] amen
[51:03] but see we lost that
[51:05] that ability to
[51:07] tell people about calvary
[51:09] because we want to talk about so many
[51:10] great mysteries people need to know what
[51:14] the cost
[51:15] what it cost them they need to know
[51:18] about jesus christ
[51:20] they need to know about the love of god
[51:22] y'all understand me if you can hook them
[51:24] with the hook them with that that bait
[51:27] hallelujah you can hook them you can
[51:30] roll them into the mysteries but they
[51:32] need to know that jesus christ is still
[51:34] alive
[51:37] they don't know it when we these deep
[51:39] things are all brother brooks listen let
[51:41] me tell you something
[51:43] even when it comes to baby eagles they
[51:45] don't get the whole piece of beef
[51:48] it's cut up
[51:51] however you want to say it
[51:53] right
[51:54] we are meat eaters
[51:55] but most of the time when i say these
[51:57] things i'm not talking about people who
[51:59] have been christians for a long time
[52:01] denominational i'm not talking about i'm
[52:03] to my sinners
[52:05] i'm telling my sinners who don't even
[52:06] know nothing about jesus christ
[52:09] that's what i'm talking about and
[52:11] sometimes you got to preach that to the
[52:12] people in this church amen because they
[52:14] don't know the grace of god still yet
[52:17] people still working by law and systems
[52:19] and stuff like that that's why they're
[52:20] so sad you come in here and you bring
[52:22] the blues in here
[52:25] it's the truth
[52:26] where's the joy
[52:28] nobody's investing
[52:30] i've told people i said we need a sunday
[52:32] school teacher where is it
[52:34] for years i've been crying out for the
[52:36] kids but they don't want to invest in
[52:38] the children everybody's too selfish
[52:43] and the children is what needs to be
[52:45] taught
[52:49] we need some adolescents to teach us
[52:53] some young people teaching they're going
[52:55] wild because nobody's taking the time to
[52:58] teach them oh he's got to be the pastor
[53:00] john pastor can't do everything folks
[53:02] need to invest you got time you got
[53:06] knowledge you got what it takes you
[53:08] ought to stop thinking about yourselves
[53:11] and thinking about investing
[53:17] paul called timothy his own son
[53:20] because he invested in him
[53:24] and what a mighty man of god timothy
[53:26] became
[53:32] enter into the joy of the lord
[53:35] 24 he then he which had received the one

[53:47] gathering where thou has not strawed and
[53:49] i was what afraid
[53:53] and went and hid that talent in the
[53:55] earth brother brenham said if you don't
[53:58] know nothing but how the candle got lit

[54:13] and went and hid my talent in the earth

[54:22] his lord answered and said unto him thou
[54:24] wicked and slawful servant
[54:27] thou knew that i reap where i shall not
[54:29] and gather where i have not strong
[54:32] he said you wicked

[56:15] preparing for his coming
[56:18] hallelujah the time jesus comes every i
[56:21] won't see him this time
[56:24] but there's a time when he does come
[56:26] every i will see him
[56:29] but the bride of jesus christ she's
[56:31] moving and and she's being transformed
[56:34] and translated right now she's moving
[56:38] from this third dimension moving from
[56:40] the fourth and the fifth all the way up
[56:42] to the sixth because that's where she's
[56:44] getting her inspiration from amen is
[56:46] that right
[56:47] because when you've heard this message
[56:49] you've heard from your theophany amen
[56:54] hallelujah
[56:56] i feel like praising him
[56:59] it's you know it's going to be hard you
[57:02] and i we're in the worst age ever
[57:05] but the most glorious age brother said
[57:07] if he had a choice of picking the age
[57:10] that he would he would rather be in he
[57:12] said it would be this age
[57:15] hallelujah why because we are going to
[57:18] see the pride of jesus christ coming to
[57:20] full manifestation
[57:22] of him
[57:24] she becomes him or he becomes her
[57:26] however you want to put it
[57:28] but don't tell me it ain't happening i'm
[57:30] a witness isn't happening
[57:32] because he's changing me
[57:39] he said cast ye the unprofitable servant
[57:42] into outer darkness what happened he
[57:45] missed the rapture
[57:48] there shall be weeping
[57:50] and dashing of teeth
[57:55] listen
[57:56] we can't even get people to clean the
[57:57] church
[58:01] nobody want to do anything free
[58:04] and god has done all the things that he
[58:05] could do for the sp these people
[58:08] right
[58:14] that's the truth
[58:16] everybody don't mind dirtying it up but
[58:17] nobody want to clean it
[58:20] i wish i had the whole church here to
[58:21] say that too
[58:23] maybe i'll say it again sunday
[58:26] you know the point is people of god
[58:29] you know what this is we know this is
[58:31] the lord's house but this is the
[58:33] temporal lord's house too
[58:41] i would look forward to somebody's
[58:43] coming in here and say you know what
[58:44] brother looks i i was like brother
[58:46] marshall bless his heart it's hard but
[58:48] anyway our um
[58:51] oh god yeah uh he would he would come
[58:55] and you know bring flowers even though
[58:57] the flowers would die he'd bring more
[58:59] flowers every time
[59:00] he kind of like the same way i am i
[59:03] can't do flowers
[59:07] and there's some people that can do
[59:08] flowers and they just bloom like crazy
[59:10] you know but uh then he brought in some
[59:13] plastic ones
[59:14] we have to worry about them dying on you
[59:16] right but nevertheless he was doing his
[59:19] best
[59:21] and god will reward him for that
[59:27] you know most of the people in this
[59:28] message have been a bit you know
[59:30] you don't have to become an organization
[59:32] to invest
[59:34] no
[59:35] no no i'll show you another little
[59:37] investor
[59:38] a fellow who had just a few fish and
[59:40] loaves of bread
[59:43] that's all he had
[59:45] and god took that little bit of
[59:47] substance and multiplied it guess what
[59:50] he made history not just here on earth
[59:53] but in heaven do
[59:54] everybody knows about him and god didn't
[59:57] even give him a name
[59:59] you know why
[1:00:00] i believe because all of us can invest
[1:00:02] like that
[1:00:07] and because they don't know what it is
[1:00:09] to get into the spirit of the message
[1:00:10] they don't
[1:00:12] people don't know what it is they don't
[1:00:14] know how to get into the spirit of the
[1:00:15] message
[1:00:20] you know
[1:00:21] and the true truth of the matter is you
[1:00:24] don't there is no way you can know that
[1:00:26] other that god reveals it to you
[1:00:28] but he can't reveal it to a person
[1:00:30] that's just counter-minded
[1:00:32] you know like you've heard me say the
[1:00:34] bible said put on the whole arm of god
[1:00:36] we we need to put on hold of our god the
[1:00:38] bible said we ought to you know cleanse
[1:00:40] ourselves daily and all these things if
[1:00:43] you don't do all those things you'll
[1:00:44] never be spiritual
[1:00:47] let me say it like this there is a flood
[1:00:49] and you've heard me say it again there's
[1:00:51] a flood of demonic forces that are now
[1:00:54] just not hitting america but hitting the
[1:00:56] entire world
[1:00:59] and god is angry
[1:01:01] you say he's not yes he is
[1:01:04] god is angry with this world
[1:01:07] his eyes are flaming fire right now
[1:01:12] listen people of god
[1:01:14] when you see how perverted this world
[1:01:16] has come and and and you know and trying
[1:01:18] to undo what god has already done
[1:01:22] let's get real every nation that did
[1:01:25] what we're doing
[1:01:27] they ended up in disaster
[1:01:29] it ended up in disaster
[1:01:31] look throughout history i tell you what
[1:01:33] i don't have time to go through it but
[1:01:35] you can go way back and every nation
[1:01:39] every tribe every country that perverted
[1:01:42] and especially when they knew better
[1:01:46] god destroyed them
[1:01:48] he didn't even spare israel
[1:01:58] look at it this way
[1:02:00] all too many people read the bible
[1:02:03] where it says in acts 2 38 repent
[1:02:06] and be baptized every one of you in the
[1:02:08] name of jesus christ for the remission
[1:02:10] of sins and ye shall receive the gift of
[1:02:13] the holy ghost
[1:02:14] and just pass right on
[1:02:17] they don't see it
[1:02:19] if they saw it by getting in the spirit
[1:02:22] they will know that if they want to
[1:02:24] receive the holy spirit they need to
[1:02:27] repent and be baptized in the name of
[1:02:30] the lord jesus and then god would be
[1:02:33] duty-bound to fulfill
[1:02:36] his word
[1:02:38] by filling them with the holy ghost
[1:02:41] they never get in his spirit or it would
[1:02:44] happen to them exactly as a word say
[1:02:47] pray to god for revelation by his spirit
[1:02:50] that is the first step get in the spirit
[1:02:54] like me just you
[1:02:57] use another let me just use another
[1:02:59] illustration
[1:03:00] suppose you need healing
[1:03:02] what does the word say well
[1:03:05] we have read it it countless times but
[1:03:08] did not get in the spirit when reading
[1:03:10] it
[1:03:12] did we ask god for the spirit to teach
[1:03:15] us the real truth of it
[1:03:17] if we did we would call the elders
[1:03:20] confess our sins be anointed and pray
[1:03:23] for and that will be that
[1:03:26] it might not come immediately but in his
[1:03:30] spirit it is all over
[1:03:33] there is no other court of appeal
[1:03:36] god will fulfill his word or we need to
[1:03:39] get in the spirit
[1:03:41] and then things will be done don't go
[1:03:44] through the act first get in the spirit
[1:03:47] and then go through the acts and watch
[1:03:49] what god will do
[1:03:52] hallelujah see that's why the devil
[1:03:54] defeats us we won't get in the spirit
[1:03:58] we're coming here like catholics and
[1:03:59] methodists and things like that
[1:04:02] hallelujah stiff like stiffs
[1:04:07] hallelujah
[1:04:09] you got to get in the spirit
[1:04:15] people say well i ain't that emotional
[1:04:17] well let me give you a little bit of
[1:04:18] this
[1:04:19] this heavenly
[1:04:22] you get some of this heavenly wine
[1:04:23] you'll be like the jews jumping out the
[1:04:26] windows
[1:04:31] see into praying for the revelation of
[1:04:33] the message that would transform you
[1:04:36] from the inside out
[1:04:38] change in the mind change in the soul
[1:04:41] and let me tell you something you'll
[1:04:43] never grow with bitterness or hatred in
[1:04:45] your heart you'll never you the devil
[1:04:48] stops you right there
[1:04:52] hallelujah

[1:08:28] before the foundation of the world his
[1:08:30] seed is not a habit or it it in

[1:09:28] when i went to college when i went to
[1:09:29] school amen guess what jesus is on my
[1:09:32] mind

[1:09:36] i wasn't ashamed
[1:09:39] amen
[1:09:43] like i told you i got so filled with the
[1:09:44] holy ghost one time just on my test when
[1:09:47] god my mind went blank and god gave me
[1:09:50] gave me uh
[1:09:51] he brought it back to my remembrance and
[1:09:53] before i knew it i was speaking in
[1:09:54] tongues in class
[1:09:56] i didn't care
[1:09:58] i remember coming home and i was so
[1:10:00] excited but you had to step up to my
[1:10:02] porch
[1:10:03] right before i could get there the holy
[1:10:05] ghost hit me and i was out there
[1:10:08] i didn't care
[1:10:10] my neighbor my neighbor saw me he said
[1:10:12] boy i know you don't change
[1:10:15] but it wasn't me
[1:10:17] it was the joy of the lord
[1:10:22] we should never be ashamed of god no
[1:10:23] matter where we go
[1:10:26] don't be afraid to talk about jesus in
[1:10:28] public because they're not afraid to
[1:10:29] talk about their devils
[1:10:32] you ain't nothing but a holy roller
[1:10:34] hallelujah thank you thanks a lot when
[1:10:36] they call you one of those things
[1:10:40] let me go because i'm i'm having too
[1:10:42] much fun it's i'm serious when i have
[1:10:46] god is good to me
[1:10:49] see it's a carrier not talking about
[1:10:51] talking about the pentecostal world
[1:10:54] it had to be
[1:10:56] but when they went but when that wheat
[1:10:58] begins to grow
[1:11:00] like the church first was a carrier to
[1:11:02] jesus this is what i was trying to tell
[1:11:04] the people when the prophet of god went
[1:11:06] off the scene everybody said we got it
[1:11:07] we got it we got it but that's not what
[1:11:09] he said he said we were already green
[1:11:13] we were green
[1:11:15] you know that's what that's why we
[1:11:16] fought each other we weren't mature
[1:11:19] that's why we had our differences our
[1:11:21] denominational issues
[1:11:24] right green
[1:11:25] fought like children but now it's time
[1:11:28] to grow up
[1:11:30] it's time to be perfect
[1:11:32] mature
[1:11:34] right the time of maturity is here we
[1:11:37] have laid in listen you don't listen to
[1:11:39] the message every day and i know
[1:11:41] sometimes i
[1:11:42] i feel my grandkids sometimes because
[1:11:44] they wake up with brother brown on their
[1:11:46] own they they go to bed with brother
[1:11:48] brown every time daddy grandpa and
[1:11:50] you know i know i don't care i don't
[1:11:52] think about it sometime i do and i think
[1:11:54] well
[1:11:55] you somehow you're going to have to get
[1:11:56] it
[1:11:57] but the point is i don't care what you
[1:11:59] think about me i know i'm feeding my
[1:12:02] soul
[1:12:03] that's all i know and i know at what
[1:12:05] point in time he's going to manifest
[1:12:07] what's going in
[1:12:10] it's going in there and it's not going
[1:12:12] in there for nothing it's a purpose
[1:12:15] why do i hunger and thirst every day for
[1:12:18] more of him more of him more of him it's
[1:12:20] because there's a hunger there's a life
[1:12:22] in me that's calling for it hallelujah
[1:12:25] and one of these old days
[1:12:28] amen it's going to manifest itself
[1:12:31] i won't have to do nothing
[1:12:34] it will come forth hallelujah that's
[1:12:37] what you got to understand people
[1:12:39] if life is in there it's pulling for the
[1:12:42] word
[1:12:44] that's what it feeds on it feeds on the
[1:12:47] word
[1:12:50] hallelujah let me move on now but when
[1:12:53] he began to tell the truth
[1:12:56] let me let me go back but when the wheat
[1:12:58] began to grow like the church first was
[1:13:01] a carrier to jesus but when he began to
[1:13:03] tell them that the truth of god they
[1:13:06] separated from him now what's happening
[1:13:09] no cooperation why it has to be that way
[1:13:14] so that the wheat itself can lay before
[1:13:17] the sun he's at the s-u-n and and so
[1:13:21] the spiritual wheat
[1:13:23] can lay before the s-o-n
[1:13:25] to be turned to a golden grain of the
[1:13:28] word see made word god made flesh
[1:13:33] vindicated
[1:13:35] he that believeth on me the works that i
[1:13:37] do shall he also the church that that
[1:13:40] that that believes on me
[1:13:42] the works that i'll do shall we do also
[1:13:43] the church that lives by the word
[1:13:46] rightly not through organization but in
[1:13:48] in the presence of the word the sun it
[1:13:51] becomes what a very a very same word
[1:13:54] that went down on the day of pentecost
[1:13:57] now doesn't malachi 4 teach us that
[1:14:00] before the great and terrible day of the
[1:14:02] lord shall come that that which will
[1:14:05] will take place
[1:14:06] how many knows that he will restore the
[1:14:09] hearts of the children to the father is
[1:14:11] that right and the faith of the original
[1:14:13] pentecostal fathers and in that day luke
[1:14:16] 17 30 i believe that believe it is jesus
[1:14:19] said when the son of man is being
[1:14:21] revealed not men the son of man not an
[1:14:25] organization the son of man the word
[1:14:28] living itself again among the people see
[1:14:31] the word itself made flesh in you
[1:14:34] you are a reflection of his this hour
[1:14:37] the the message reflection of it see you
[1:14:41] live again
[1:14:42] live the life that was in jesus christ
[1:14:45] you're in the presence of the son
[1:14:48] see what i'm saying you can put it
[1:14:50] anywhere you want to but he brought it
[1:14:52] back down to us
[1:14:58] hallelujah
[1:15:00] 8 35 give me 10 more minutes and i'll
[1:15:02] let you go
[1:15:04] you know i talk about think about
[1:15:06] investing and and you know
[1:15:09] i used to have this thing and i didn't
[1:15:10] understand what god was doing but
[1:15:12] when i was a christian you know when i
[1:15:13] got an early young christian i used to
[1:15:15] get jealous of the old testament things
[1:15:17] god said how they did all of this what i
[1:15:19] mean how god you know they're supposed
[1:15:20] to be new and hear these great men of
[1:15:23] god but i didn't know what god was doing
[1:15:24] i was ignorant of what he was doing
[1:15:27] but one of my one of my my uh favorite
[1:15:29] characters were was david
[1:15:32] he was a boy
[1:15:34] but he had the faith of a man
[1:15:36] and david amen used his experience
[1:15:41] and invested those experiences you see
[1:15:44] that's what make a great football player
[1:15:46] that what that's what makes a great uh
[1:15:48] uh a golfer whatever sport you might
[1:15:51] play you know your failures become
[1:15:53] stepping stones they become experiences
[1:15:56] and then you you begin to invest those
[1:15:59] those and reflect back and you you begin
[1:16:01] to invest your failures
[1:16:03] into in ways that the affairs have
[1:16:06] become victories
[1:16:08] hallelujah now david didn't i mean david
[1:16:11] didn't have a failure but the point is
[1:16:13] he used his his lion experience it meant
[1:16:17] to conquer the bear and he used his bare
[1:16:19] experience to conquer goliath it just
[1:16:22] kept mounting up and his his faith in
[1:16:25] god began to increase in such a way it
[1:16:28] meant that he wasn't afraid
[1:16:31] he had no fear
[1:16:33] that's where god wants us
[1:16:37] brother said where are all the little
[1:16:39] davids where are the little davids
[1:16:41] he wants us to be a army
[1:16:44] a people with no fear
[1:16:46] that's what god is raising up
[1:16:49] huh amen
[1:16:51] oh people of god
[1:16:54] you say oh we gonna be a mighty army
[1:16:56] yeah it's gonna be on this earth
[1:16:58] before you go
[1:17:00] there you got to conquer here
[1:17:03] before you go there
[1:17:06] i'm almost done
[1:17:08] hallelujah i love i love i love
[1:17:12] this is what i want to say to people you
[1:17:14] know when we talk like this
[1:17:16] you know sometimes people think you got
[1:17:18] to be a great warrior but let me say it
[1:17:19] like this you may not god may never use
[1:17:22] you to to do one miracle
[1:17:26] but he expects you to live the life
[1:17:30] that is your great the greatest of all
[1:17:32] victory
[1:17:33] christ in you
[1:17:35] so don't don't let the devil think you
[1:17:37] got to go out here and do all this no no
[1:17:39] days that are led by the spirit i want
[1:17:41] to bring a balance to this
[1:17:43] you led to do the things you do it's not
[1:17:45] your own mind i got to do this no it's
[1:17:48] god leading you to do it
[1:17:50] and oftentimes when god is leading you
[1:17:53] you don't even know he's leading you
[1:17:55] but you're in the spirit of it
[1:17:59] hallelujah
[1:18:01] the bible says all the prophets speaking
[1:18:04] of the coming of the lord of john the
[1:18:06] baptist they said every mountain and i
[1:18:08] this is why i want to tell you something
[1:18:10] this is what i want to emphasize because
[1:18:12] without revelation you would think that
[1:18:16] the coming of john the baptist would
[1:18:17] have come with a great earthquake
[1:18:21] what would say it just like the prophet
[1:18:22] said
[1:18:23] well that's what the people did and
[1:18:25] guess what they missed him
[1:18:30] upon this rock i'll build my church
[1:18:33] it has to come by revelation
[1:18:37] he'll say it
[1:18:38] but he hides himself behind the very
[1:18:41] words and then reveals it to the people
[1:18:44] his people in such a different manner
[1:18:48] john the baptist had had followers
[1:18:51] and he they knew he was somebody
[1:18:54] just to show you how they even had the
[1:18:56] resurrection wrong
[1:18:59] they said you know uh uh who do men say
[1:19:02] i the son of man am you know some say
[1:19:04] that yeah daughter lies something
[1:19:06] jeremiah one of the prophets see they
[1:19:08] had the they thought
[1:19:10] they took the they took resurrection as
[1:19:13] almost like it was reincarnation
[1:19:17] you hear me
[1:19:19] yeah they did that's what you know they
[1:19:21] had it mixed up
[1:19:23] just like they had the coming of the
[1:19:24] lord mixed up
[1:19:26] like brother said they thought he was
[1:19:28] going to come down with the lightning
[1:19:29] bolt the big o you know they just
[1:19:32] thought the coming of the law was going
[1:19:33] to be different and here he comes when
[1:19:35] the scripture already said riding on the
[1:19:38] on the on the coat of uh the back of a
[1:19:41] following ass y'all know what i'm saying
[1:19:43] coming in on a donkey
[1:19:47] and they thought he was coming in on a
[1:19:48] stallion
[1:19:52] but look every mountain will be brought
[1:19:53] down every low
[1:19:55] place will be brought up
[1:19:57] all the rough places will be made clear
[1:19:59] and what did them people think oh angels
[1:20:02] will come down and they'll beat the
[1:20:03] drums and the bands and what a time we
[1:20:06] have out there but what was it a little
[1:20:09] old fuzzy face prophet come out of the
[1:20:12] wilderness with his beard sticking out
[1:20:14] like one of these these fuzzy words
[1:20:17] brother branham know he can say it
[1:20:21] a big piece of sheep
[1:20:23] wrapped around him and leather girdles
[1:20:26] about half dressed preaching repent for
[1:20:29] the kingdom of heaven is at hand not
[1:20:31] even with shoes on standing barefooted
[1:20:35] mud squishing up between his toes on the
[1:20:37] muddy bank of jordan and that was what
[1:20:40] the
[1:20:40] bible called great
[1:20:43] amen
[1:20:44] what they were looking for
[1:20:53] hmm
[1:20:55] see
[1:20:56] what people don't is it always have to
[1:20:58] be this way
[1:21:04] god joined scripture together that only
[1:21:06] took a profit to break it
[1:21:08] break them in part you understand what
[1:21:09] i'm saying
[1:21:11] we thought we would thought john the
[1:21:13] baptist
[1:21:15] was
[1:21:16] the only the founding elijah
[1:21:18] we didn't know that elijah was coming
[1:21:20] again you know to the gentiles
[1:21:22] it took a profit
[1:21:24] to pull that out of the scripture
[1:21:26] y'all understand what i'm saying and
[1:21:28] that revelation didn't just just become
[1:21:30] a revelation it came a manifestation it
[1:21:33] was vindicated that what was what was
[1:21:35] preached and taught
[1:21:37] was true
[1:21:41] we say we must say it exactly like he
[1:21:43] said it
[1:21:44] i'm listen
[1:21:46] before you can get a revelation you've
[1:21:48] got to say it just like he said it i'm
[1:21:50] not saying it don't say it like he said
[1:21:52] it i'm saying there's a revelation
[1:21:54] behind everything he says
[1:21:57] that's all i'm saying
[1:21:58] i'm not telling you to twist nothing i'm
[1:22:00] saying you got to understand amen if you
[1:22:03] don't take it face value you won't get
[1:22:06] it no other way
[1:22:08] right
[1:22:12] yo you okay give me another one
[1:22:14] i think it's uh genesis the third
[1:22:16] chapter 17 18 verse 16. we'll talk about
[1:22:19] the serpent shall bruise his head and
[1:22:21] you know
[1:22:22] heal and you know and if when when did
[1:22:25] that happen
[1:22:27] huh
[1:22:28] you would have thought a serpent you
[1:22:29] know what i mean you would have thought
[1:22:31] but it took god
[1:22:34] to reveal that that was calvary
[1:22:38] see
[1:22:40] upon this rock i'll build my church and
[1:22:44] every revelation you get must come back
[1:22:47] to the euro theorem
[1:22:49] every one of them
[1:22:51] now i'm gonna let you go i'm gonna let
[1:22:53] you go
[1:22:54] brother i'm saying the the bible to be
[1:22:57] the bible is to be revealed by
[1:22:59] inspiration that's the only thing the
[1:23:02] revelation
[1:23:03] jesus told peter upon this rock this
[1:23:05] rock of revelation reveals who he is
[1:23:09] blessed are thou simon son of jonah's
[1:23:12] flesh and blood has not revealed this to
[1:23:15] you and i'm gonna say it like this and
[1:23:16] i'm just gonna close this because i got
[1:23:18] too much always but anyway
[1:23:23] that's why people struggle
[1:23:26] with who brother branham was
[1:23:30] they can't see
[1:23:32] they can't they see the man false they
[1:23:34] see his human
[1:23:36] humanity
[1:23:38] and they can't see
[1:23:42] they can't see that there were times
[1:23:45] that this man ministry
[1:23:47] almost typed and almost was the
[1:23:49] fulfilling of almost every great prophet
[1:23:52] in the bible
[1:23:54] and most of all they couldn't see it
[1:23:56] when jesus christ was standing in that
[1:23:59] human flesh
[1:24:01] not a second person the person
[1:24:04] god himself
[1:24:06] they couldn't see that they still don't
[1:24:08] even people around the message they
[1:24:09] still don't see because they don't
[1:24:11] understand what a true prophet is
[1:24:16] a true prophet has no seed of his own
[1:24:19] the only seed he carries is the it's the
[1:24:21] god seed and that's what he brings
[1:24:26] and people are still struggling
[1:24:28] and they couldn't understand when
[1:24:30] brother brown said no i am not he
[1:24:33] that's the same thing john said
[1:24:36] but did not john have the holy ghost
[1:24:40] y'all hear what i'm saying
[1:24:42] the problem of god this is what gets me
[1:24:44] he never ever tried to get glory for
[1:24:47] himself
[1:24:49] he always pointed to jesus christ
[1:24:52] and the things we've done with
[1:24:56] him he quit
[1:24:59] preaching
[1:25:01] because of what people did with him
[1:25:04] and tried to give the credit i called i
[1:25:07] better not say this but i called a
[1:25:08] well-known place not long ago maybe a
[1:25:10] year ago and i was talking with the
[1:25:12] people because they i know them and
[1:25:15] you know what they said
[1:25:18] yeah the lord uh
[1:25:20] how she said it
[1:25:25] brother branham did this
[1:25:27] but he want us to give the credit to
[1:25:29] jesus
[1:25:33] hello did y'all hear what i just said
[1:25:36] brother branham did this but he want us
[1:25:38] to say jesus did it is that cr
[1:25:42] what's wrong with people
[1:25:45] when brother said jesus himself never
[1:25:47] healed one person
[1:25:52] god himself
[1:25:56] i can't do nothing except the father
[1:25:58] show me
[1:26:00] i'm closing
[1:26:03] but you see what it is people don't when
[1:26:05] you when you can't see your position
[1:26:08] where you are now you keep looking back
[1:26:10] and trying to get the prophet he the
[1:26:13] prophet has done what he's supposed to
[1:26:14] do
[1:26:16] now it's on you
[1:26:18] and listen people god is gonna say what
[1:26:19] did brother branham do
[1:26:21] what did you do
[1:26:24] what did you do with what he left
[1:26:27] how did you invest
[1:26:30] what did you come what did you get out
[1:26:31] did you get more of you understand what
[1:26:33] i'm saying what did you do
[1:26:37] did you you know i don't i reap where i
[1:26:39] haven't sown
[1:26:41] you know my point is i got some friends
[1:26:43] of mine who has not even come to this
[1:26:45] word some of them come to church has
[1:26:47] come to church have me but every time i
[1:26:49] get a chance
[1:26:51] i sow a seed
[1:26:54] i do it
[1:26:55] whether you they like it or not
[1:26:57] because i know if there is anything in
[1:27:00] them it's going to spring up someday
[1:27:03] you love the lord
[1:27:04] don't be afraid about you know you know

[1:27:08] ain't just nothing nothing but a little
[1:27:09] nugget did you know

[1:27:16] man i sure wish i could love the lord
[1:27:18] like you do
[1:27:20] now that was a compliment
[1:27:22] that was really a compliment
[1:27:24] because i do love the lord and i wish he
[1:27:26] could love the lord like i do
[1:27:28] or even more so but my point is he saw
[1:27:32] something in me
[1:27:34] and i don't know what that is and what
[1:27:36] other than jesus christ
[1:27:39] that stan
[1:27:41] i'm not boasting on me i'm boasting on
[1:27:43] jesus christ people

[1:27:47] well of water springing up into eternal
[1:27:49] life if you got so much jesus in you
