[0:00] on the man that could that could
[0:02] literally what save her
[0:06] rid her over demons that's what's proud
[0:09] with us we've got some no praise demons
[0:12] yes sir come to church and you don't
[0:15] want to praise God that's a demon
[0:18] say what you want to say
[0:23] that demon gonna make give you every
[0:25] reason why he don't want you to shout
[0:27] and show joy and show love see if you
[0:30] don't praise him if you don't get into
[0:31] his atmosphere you can't love nobody
[0:35] you can't love nobody
[0:37] not even yourself
[0:42] Hallelujah and I'm not going to be here
[0:44] long
[0:45] but this is just a portion of the
[0:46] message I've been trying to bring us you
[0:49] know we've been giving everybody credit
[0:50] you know
[0:52] huh
[0:53] well Paul says listen everything I ever
[0:56] had I counted done but in this age we
[0:58] said oh Paul was such a great man that's
[1:01] not the way Paul felt about himself
[1:05] Hallelujah and a real Christian we don't
[1:08] feel prideful we don't think we're so
[1:11] much better than somebody else
[1:14] hallelujah we're in such a state of
[1:16] Thanksgiving
[1:18] humility
[1:20] clothed you know with same faceness
[1:24] in that sense
[1:27] uh
[1:31] I wonder how you would have taken John
[1:32] if you lived in his day
[1:36] John and a little like a maniac
[1:40] half dressed
[1:42] leather clothes
[1:45] skin
[1:48] wooly hair
[1:50] but I've never seen a comb
[1:52] never knew what a toothbrush was
[1:55] standing out there
[1:57] popping locals in his mouth like popcorn
[2:00] or peanuts you would have thought the
[2:02] man was crazy and every time he opened
[2:04] his mouth he was criticizing your church
[2:07] [Laughter]
[2:11] and people in the message well we're so
[2:14] this we're so that you we we Way Beyond
[2:16] that no you're not
[2:18] that's the truth that's that's the
[2:20] deception
[2:22] that people think that they're far
[2:24] beyond Pentecost and never been to
[2:27] Pentecost
[2:28] but I wonder how far you are from the
[2:31] left or to the right
[2:33] right because you've never been you
[2:35] don't even know the joys of the Lord
[2:37] without the Holy Ghost you don't know
[2:39] what the joy of the Lord is
[2:44] oh Anybody Can Dance
[2:47] anybody can shout the music and make you
[2:50] do that ask a little baby
[2:54] oh you ain't got to have nothing but
[2:56] emotions for that you beat the right
[2:58] beat that baby gonna move sometimes you
[3:00] got to say huh baby no no no that's the
[3:02] wrong move wrong move
[3:04] y'all know it's true so that that has
[3:08] nothing to do with the Holy Spirit
[3:09] that's just emotions
[3:11] but when it comes to having the lamb
[3:14] listen they had to not only kill the
[3:17] lamb they had the Rosa lamb and they had
[3:19] to eat the lamb and the Bible said they
[3:21] had to eat it in haste you say brother
[3:24] when the last time you you read a
[3:27] message or listened to a message
[3:33] oh well I can't tell you
[3:37] see see this is this is something's
[3:39] wrong with this anointing
[3:41] uh these people have on them and they
[3:44] claim to be bride something's wrong
[3:47] Hallelujah brother Branham didn't claim
[3:49] to be Malachi 4 he was and he proved it
[3:52] by the anointing
[3:54] right it was it was absolutely the
[3:57] anointing of that hour that
[3:59] distinguished him from everybody else I
[4:01] heard somebody say today oh I believe
[4:03] he's a false prophet I said um
[4:06] shame but she was ordained for that
[4:10] you was ordained to believe he's a false
[4:12] prophet I was ordained to believe that
[4:13] he is the real one a true one right am I
[4:17] ashamed of him absolutely not
[4:20] Hallelujah because the word in which God
[4:23] used and brought through him is the
[4:26] reason why I stand today
[4:28] I would be nothing without this message
[4:32] that's the truth
[4:34] Hallelujah
[4:36] have mercy have mercy have mercy listen
[4:39] and I'm moving on Behold the Lamb so I'm
[4:42] gonna show you something the
[4:44] denominations of people they think
[4:46] they're under the blood
[4:47] they don't even know who the lamb is
[4:51] they think they
[4:53] because when you think the lamb is is a
[4:56] trinity a second person in the Trinity
[4:58] it makes me know you don't know what
[5:00] you're talking about
[5:02] brother I'm already in trouble because I
[5:05] believe what I believe
[5:06] Hallelujah and the only one in this day
[5:10] that was able to point out the lamb Was
[5:13] Elijah
[5:15] amen right look at Paul John's day you
[5:18] had Pharisees Sadducees they were
[5:20] calling him the devil like they're doing
[5:22] now
[5:24] Hallelujah but John the Baptist let me
[5:27] read this thing
[5:28] the next day John seeth Jesus
[5:32] Saint John 1 29-34 coming unto him and
[5:36] he said Behold the Lamb of God which
[5:40] taketh the way the sins of the world
[5:44] you know what that word means behold
[5:47] don't miss this
[5:55] preaching don't miss this I'm pointing
[5:59] you to the man who's greater than I am
[6:01] the man who I wasn't even the worthy to
[6:04] lose the latches of his shoes I'm trying
[6:06] to tell you this man is my savior
[6:11] amen
[6:13] amen
[6:18] a man becomes a lamb
[6:20] you know that's something else
[6:23] because a man it's a fallen man there's
[6:26] no way you can become a lamb until you
[6:27] have a nature change
[6:30] but he was born the lamb born in a
[6:32] manger
[6:34] Hallelujah
[6:42] [Music]
[6:45] lamb whom I said John said after me
[6:48] cometh a man which he preferred before
[6:50] me but he was before me hello
[6:53] now if this
[6:58] judges said that what about our Elijah
[7:01] Elijah says there's one coming after me
[7:06] and who is that that but Jesus Christ
[7:09] himself
[7:10] it was Jesus Christ who John pointed to
[7:13] and guess what even John's disciples did
[7:16] not recognize what Jesus what John was
[7:19] pointing to
[7:20] many of them still follow John but then
[7:23] there were two that packed their bags
[7:26] and said Jesus cannot follow you
[7:28] oh yeah I'm one of them I'll follow the
[7:32] Lamb of God
[7:33] [Music]
[7:34] Hallelujah is that right
[7:36] brother random preached on it
[7:39] talks about the lamb
[7:42] how that lamb must continue to keep that
[7:44] Lamb's nature
[7:46] hey
[7:47] is that right you got to keep that lamb
[7:50] nature you can't be switching from a
[7:52] lamb to a wolf
[7:54] Hallelujah he said the Holy Ghost leaves
[7:57] you goes off on a branch and waits till
[8:01] you confess and make right before it can
[8:03] come down in a bowl with you again
[8:05] Hallelujah abide with me we say Lord
[8:08] because the Bible said if you abide in
[8:11] him in his word abide in you Hallelujah
[8:14] you can ask whatsoever you will
[8:17] John Bell record saying I saw the Spirit
[8:20] descending from heaven like a dog and it
[8:23] Abode upon him
[8:26] love
[8:28] and here God did the same thing in this
[8:31] day
[8:32] and people feel saying it's a fake
[8:37] oh so many people got a lot to be to
[8:40] answer for
[8:41] and I'm glad I'm not I trust that I'm
[8:43] not one of them
[8:45] this lamb and I like I said it's not
[8:47] going to be long because you got to
[8:48] understand when the lamb took the book
[8:51] that was powerful
[8:54] hey
[8:56] hey you tell my God in morphing
[8:58] he unveiled himself the whole time that
[9:02] lamb represented him but now this lamb
[9:05] is a man
[9:06] Made In His Image and likeness the
[9:09] fullness of the godhead bodily dwelt in
[9:12] him
[9:13] they thought because he was humble he
[9:15] was weak
[9:21] they thought because he didn't fight
[9:22] back he was a loser
[9:25] they didn't understand
[9:27] the lamb had orders
[9:31] according to the scripture he couldn't
[9:32] open his mouth
[9:34] he had to go to his shears dumb
[9:37] he had to go before them amen without
[9:40] defending himself
[9:43] like the port said he could have called
[9:45] Ten Thousand Angels
[9:48] they said the Angels amen was all in the
[9:51] trees all he had to do was move one
[9:52] finger and they would have tore it up
[9:55] but he knew there was a there was a
[9:58] greater uh uh I could say he had a
[10:01] vision in his mind there was someone
[10:04] that he was dying for
[10:06] and that someone was you
[10:10] Hallelujah and you gotta understand
[10:13] amen he paid the price for you
[10:16] Hallelujah is that right that means if
[10:20] he paid my price he paid your price we
[10:23] are free
[10:25] you don't have to have to worry about
[10:26] hell he went to hell for you
[10:32] the devil had us all day worried about
[10:35] our salvation
[10:36] if you're in Christ you can't be on in
[10:39] Christ
[10:42] it can be not not in Christ if you in
[10:45] Christ
[10:46] Christ is in you
[10:48] Hallelujah
[10:50] is that right
[10:52] Hallelujah I love this saying in in the
[10:55] Book of Revelation amen it says uh uh
[10:58] and one of the elders said unto me weep
[11:01] not Behold The Lion of the tribe of
[11:04] Judah the root of David had prepared to
[11:06] open the book and to loose the seals
[11:08] there are see that's a revelation to me
[11:10] a powerful Revelation because the Bible
[11:14] previous to to that said John found
[11:16] there was no one no one he couldn't find
[11:18] no one and he was sad about now John
[11:21] knew he wasn't worthy Hallelujah now
[11:24] John laid up in Jesus's bosom and all of
[11:26] that but he knew he wasn't Worthy
[11:28] right he knew it wasn't Worthy
[11:35] any Christian if you're really a
[11:37] Christian you know the only way in your
[11:40] soul you know the only way you'll make
[11:42] Heaven is by the grace of God
[11:46] Hallelujah
[11:48] is that right and the Bible said Jesus
[11:51] Christ was full of grace and truth
[11:55] the devil don't want you to know the
[11:56] truth
[11:57] he don't want you to know that you're
[11:59] free indeed
[12:01] he don't want you to know that you don't
[12:03] have to worry about it because if you
[12:06] are in Christ it's already been settled
[12:09] you've been Justified as though you've
[12:12] never sinned in the first place
[12:15] Hallelujah I know I'm sitting everywhere
[12:17] that's okay
[12:18] it's good to me anyway
[12:22] some things don't need to be said that's
[12:24] for sure but you know about the grace of
[12:26] God we we look at uh how God
[12:30] put it all in the book
[12:34] all in there
[12:36] and John says Lord
[12:41] the elders Still the Lamb as it had been
[12:44] slain
[12:46] having seven horns and seven eyes which
[12:49] are the seven spirits of God sent forth
[12:52] into all the Earth
[12:54] and he came and took the book see you
[12:58] know and you know brother Brandon talks
[12:59] about it the difference between the book
[13:01] of life and the book the Lamb's Book of
[13:04] Life and the Book of Life amen is when
[13:07] you were born
[13:08] this world this whole thing that you you
[13:11] you you had to travel through that's the
[13:13] Book of Life all of your Deeds are in
[13:16] that book
[13:18] but when you come to Christ
[13:20] and God transfer your name from the just
[13:24] the book of life into the Lamb's Book of
[13:26] Life
[13:27] you see the lamb is the savior
[13:31] the lamb was the king of Israel
[13:37] Hallelujah
[13:39] glory to God
[13:42] why not an eagle
[13:44] he was an eagle
[13:46] but you've never seen a sacrificial
[13:48] eagle
[13:52] it had to be the nature
[13:54] that God chose
[13:56] the lamb
[13:57] doesn't it make you want to be a lamb
[14:00] don't you want to be identified oh I'm a
[14:03] lion I'm an eagle but nobody want to be
[14:05] a lamb
[14:08] but in order to make Heaven you got to
[14:10] have the Lambs of nature
[14:12] which is Christ himself
[14:16] and he came and took the book out oh
[14:18] don't be talking about me and hey I
[14:20] ain't letting nobody walk all over me
[14:21] well Jesus did it
[14:25] that nature calls him to hush his mouth
[14:29] you don't have to always say something
[14:31] back
[14:32] we all have trouble with that don't we
[14:36] but I'm learning
[14:39] like that song say God ain't through
[14:42] with me yet
[14:43] he's still working on me
[14:46] to make me what I ought to be is that
[14:48] right he's still working on all of us
[14:51] but one thing I do know I got him
[14:56] he's on the inside and everything that's
[15:00] happening in me is Christ in me moving
[15:03] me from glory to glory to glory
[15:07] Hallelujah and one day he's going to be
[15:11] completely finished with this product
[15:18] those Elders fell down and this is what
[15:20] I'm talking about how on Earth you can
[15:22] be really happy about you know I've got
[15:24] a I've got a young man that's not oh I
[15:26] won't say young boy he's younger than me
[15:28] uh but anyhow fired up from God and
[15:32] don't even know nothing about this
[15:33] message
[15:35] hmm
[15:37] but whatever fire he's got he has he's
[15:40] not ashamed wherever I whenever I see
[15:43] him and wherever I see him he's talking
[15:46] about the Lord and I mean loud
[15:48] and sometimes he's telling you about
[15:50] Jesus and you can't even get a word in
[15:53] I like conversations like that
[16:01] but you can't get people around this
[16:02] message to talk about Jesus long enough
[16:05] glory to God
[16:07] I shouldn't be talking about y'all like
[16:09] that
[16:13] um y'all forgive me
[16:15] you know I'm not talking about y'all but
[16:18] you know what I'm what I'm trying to say
[16:20] people of God
[16:22] we need more of him
[16:25] more of him
[16:27] and you know what I I it's true I need
[16:30] to start get uh encouraging you most of
[16:33] all I think sometimes
[16:34] not uh willfully or not willfully
[16:37] knowing a talk down which I don't mean
[16:39] to uh because I need his grace too
[16:43] and I don't want any of you to think I'm
[16:45] preaching like I'm better than somebody
[16:47] else in here because I'm not
[16:49] and it takes the same blood of Jesus
[16:51] Christ to cleanse me every day
[16:54] and so when I say things and you know
[16:57] just don't take it so personally most of
[16:59] the time I'm trying to get somebody's
[17:01] attention
[17:02] maybe somebody on the line or something
[17:04] like that because it is later than what
[17:07] we think
[17:08] coming can I can I say this and I'm not
[17:10] going to be too much longer
[17:12] but pre-adventure we live to see the
[17:16] persecution
[17:18] you know the bride won't go through that
[17:20] kind of a persecution but we're going to
[17:22] feel the pressure
[17:24] and God is going to bring us to a place
[17:26] where we have to make a decision
[17:29] now we will see the day I believe from
[17:32] my understanding where you won't be able
[17:34] to buy nor sale
[17:36] and it looks like that time is
[17:38] approaching just like our brother say
[17:41] you know there's a word that we have
[17:43] that we must amen understand we must
[17:46] believe his report
[17:48] and you must know
[17:50] the worth
[17:52] of your salvation
[17:54] y'all understand me
[17:56] what would a man
[17:58] gain
[18:00] if he gains the whole world
[18:03] and loses soul
[18:05] if you read the fox this book of martyr
[18:08] you'll find out there were some
[18:09] Christians that really recanted
[18:13] right at the end when they were just
[18:15] about
[18:16] finished
[18:17] they didn't want to they didn't want to
[18:19] go to the fire
[18:21] but then there was a witness somebody on
[18:24] who hadn't even declared to be a
[18:26] Christian
[18:27] saw them repent
[18:29] and basically said you fool
[18:33] you would trade
[18:35] a few moments of this life
[18:39] for eternal life
[18:42] and that person who said that stood up
[18:44] and says I'm a Christian
[18:46] and he took the flames
[18:49] y'all understand what I'm saying you got
[18:52] to know what Calvary is worth if you
[18:56] don't know the depths of the mysteries
[18:57] of God
[18:59] you need to know how you were saved
[19:02] who brought salvation to you and who
[19:06] that is living in you
[19:08] you understand what I'm saying and
[19:10] nothing in this world
[19:13] should ever stop you
[19:16] from worshiping the lamb
[19:19] Hallelujah that's what churches have
[19:21] done they've stopped the people
[19:23] because it's the church that saves them
[19:25] now oh I go to this church always Bishop
[19:28] so and so always Elder so and so oh it's
[19:30] not
[19:31] it's not Isaiah Brooks it's Jesus Christ
[19:36] always will be Jesus Christ I'm just an
[19:40] instrument
[19:41] being used by God I can't save nobody
[19:45] and the word I preach is not my own I'm
[19:49] just resounding
[19:51] what has already been preached
[19:54] it's Jesus Christ the Lamb of God
[19:59] don't care about how many people in your
[20:01] church
[20:02] people said we got a big church we got
[20:03] over so and so on so and so and so well
[20:06] I want you to know some Catholic Church
[20:08] got more than that
[20:11] huh my wife would tell you we used to
[20:14] travel down in Ohio
[20:17] am
[20:19] assed Mass
[20:22] and you'll find a parking lot full
[20:25] A.M
[20:26] try that here
[20:29] try it anywhere that's not been 40 years
[20:33] ago
[20:35] but you see when you really believe in
[20:37] something
[20:38] it shows
[20:41] say what you want to say
[20:44] but when you really believe in something
[20:46] it shows
[20:49] I'm almost done
[20:59] the Bible says
[21:02] in Revelation 13 and 8 I'm gonna close
[21:04] on this
[21:06] because I want you to understand that
[21:07] people said well this ain't deep enough
[21:09] yes it is
[21:11] yes it is you'll be surprised at the
[21:13] number of people that don't know nothing
[21:14] about Calvary and what Christ was all
[21:16] about and why it had to be a lamb and
[21:19] you know
[21:20] um those kind of things we're so
[21:23] interested in in conduct and Order
[21:29] okay lamb this is the way you supposed
[21:31] to act
[21:33] follow the one two three four
[21:36] you've never seen
[21:38] a sheep
[21:39] teaching a lamb
[21:42] how to act
[21:46] that lamb knows how to act
[21:49] why it was born a lamb
[21:54] and when your your laws become the
[21:57] things that rules you and make you act
[22:00] the way you act that ain't it they're
[22:02] going to be so many people that did
[22:04] everything just right but never was born
[22:07] again you say that in Scripture it is
[22:09] scripture
[22:10] the Rich Young Ruler did everything
[22:13] right
[22:15] and he still was lost
[22:18] he was just religiously perfect
[22:21] just like Paul
[22:22] religiously perfect and Paul to be
[22:25] humbled
[22:26] so that he could see he was a sinner and
[22:29] Paul said I have the Revelation now I
[22:31] was more wretched than any and I'm gonna
[22:34] tell you something there's nothing worse
[22:36] than a religious spirit
[22:38] because it deceives the hearts of the
[22:41] people you've got to be born again and I
[22:44] don't care brother Adam said it like
[22:46] this I think in the East is here every
[22:47] on our future home whichever it is he
[22:49] said every birth is missing
[22:54] y'all want these old Methodist salvation
[22:58] and Baptist salvation and
[23:01] Catholic salvation and whatever they're
[23:03] more out there but when it comes to the
[23:05] real Pentecostal salvation you don't
[23:07] have time for it okay
[23:13] One Day You're Gonna wish you had time
[23:15] for it
[23:16] and that's what the devil does he keep
[23:18] us so busy so busy we don't even know
[23:20] that we you know people don't love
[23:23] prayer no more
[23:26] I get frustrated now when I can't Pray
[23:28] when I want to
[23:32] God help me I'm almost done give me just
[23:37] Revelations 12.
[23:39] let me let me finish this 13 one first
[23:41] please 13-8 and all that dwell upon the
[23:45] Earth shall worship Him whose names are
[23:47] not written in the Book of Life of the
[23:49] Lamb huh
[23:51] didn't say the book of life it said The
[23:53] Book of Life of the Lamb why the lamb
[23:55] must give you life
[23:58] he's the one that chooses you
[24:01] he's the one that gives you the Holy
[24:03] Ghost he's the one that gives you his
[24:05] life he's the one that gives you his
[24:07] nature
[24:09] slain from the founders of the world
[24:12] even those who are left behind because
[24:14] they fail to go all the way
[24:17] and how much we we're screaming I'm
[24:19] telling you people
[24:21] there is something pulling me there is
[24:23] something pushing me how they want to
[24:25] say it every day do I falter every day
[24:29] yes
[24:30] but I could feel the pool
[24:33] for a higher plane
[24:36] I know something's moving in my soul I
[24:39] know something has connected with me I'm
[24:42] not wondering about it I know that and I
[24:45] know I'm on a journey and I'm willing I
[24:47] told the Lord no matter what it takes
[24:49] what I must go through I don't care
[24:52] about the suffering part as long as I
[24:55] know you with me
[24:57] I don't care about the fire
[24:59] as long as you're in the fire with me
[25:01] I just need to know that you're there
[25:04] that's all I need
[25:06] don't ever leave me don't ever forsake
[25:08] me
[25:09] see
[25:10] listen
[25:12] even those who were left behind they
[25:15] overcame now I know when it comes uh uh
[25:18] uh uh to Revelation 12 you know
[25:21] everybody said well this is the bride
[25:22] because I've used it so many times but I
[25:24] want you to read that scripture all the
[25:25] way and find out who those were who
[25:27] overcame by the blood of the lamb and by
[25:30] the word of their testimony and they
[25:32] love not their lives unto death
[25:34] who were those people we use that as the
[25:37] bride but the bride is already gone
[25:40] she leaves in the third chapter
[25:42] and you got to realize amen we sing that
[25:45] song which is okay
[25:47] but our testimony is already sure
[25:50] we're not being we're not going to be
[25:52] purged we're we're being purged now
[25:55] we're being cleansed now we don't have
[25:58] to go through the listen how it talks
[26:00] about it where the Jews are going
[26:02] through that tribulation and so it's a
[26:03] foolish virgin going them back to
[26:05] Calvary
[26:08] people today think we don't need Calvary
[26:10] I need Calvary
[26:13] I need the cross I always will need the
[26:16] cross you said what do you mean because
[26:18] brother Branham saw the bride marching
[26:20] to the tune Onward Christian Soldier
[26:23] marching as to all with the cross of
[26:26] Jesus going on before
[26:29] my cross the cross right his cross and
[26:32] they overcame by the blood of the Lamb
[26:34] uh by the word of their testimony and
[26:37] they love not their lives unto the death
[26:41] huh
[26:43] that's foolish
[26:46] but they overcame
[26:48] how did they overcome
[26:49] they were sanctified
[26:51] they had enough God in them
[26:54] to bring him through the tribulation and
[26:56] to know who God was see we we fail to
[27:00] see that you can be so Sanctified and do
[27:02] everything right but you got to have the
[27:04] Holy Spirit
[27:05] you got to go all the way to perfection
[27:07] in this day like brother man said the
[27:10] Pentecost today that message will not
[27:12] work
[27:13] it won't work
[27:15] it's not that it wasn't good for them
[27:17] but you got to go on to Perfection Paul
[27:20] said it brother random said it the Bible
[27:23] says it we got to move on
[27:26] and how how it's going to happen this is
[27:29] a new message that comes to change up
[27:32] into the image and likeness of God this
[27:35] is the age that has a revelation of
[27:38] God's divine nature
[27:40] Hallelujah this is the this is the age
[27:43] that we're living in where God will take
[27:45] a people and perfect him and translate
[27:48] them
[27:49] right change them from one dimension to
[27:52] another like he did Enoch
[27:54] this is the day and it's all because
[27:58] God made a way of Escape through the
[28:01] blood of the Lamb less than
[28:15] II Peter 3 14-15 says wherefore beloved
[28:19] seeing that you love that you look for
[28:22] such things be diligent that you may be
[28:25] found of him in peace without spot and
[28:28] blameless an account that the
[28:30] long-suffering of Our Lord is salvation
[28:33] thank God even as our beloved brother
[28:37] Paul also according to the wisdom given
[28:40] unto him have written unto you
[28:46] Hallelujah one more scripture First
[28:48] Peter 1 18 and 19. for as much as you
[28:51] know that you were not redeemed with
[28:53] corruptable things as silver and gold
[28:56] from your vain conversation received by
[28:59] what traditions from your father but
[29:02] with the precious blood of Christ as of
[29:05] a lamb without blemish and without spot
[29:09] that's the only way we'll ever be free
[29:11] is that we we are accepted into beloved
[29:17] thank you
[29:20] accepted by him foreign
[29:25] and we know about God's grace in this
[29:27] day
[29:28] that the bride becomes everything he is
