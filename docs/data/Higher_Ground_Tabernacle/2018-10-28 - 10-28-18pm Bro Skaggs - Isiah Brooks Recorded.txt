thankful for the songs that were son that was I think how the brothers sing let's walk in the light follow the light and where does that like lead a beautiful heaven thank you I was very fine and I I noticed that the light it led the pink jacket dress there lady I'm sorry I don't know your name I'd say it I'd probably say it wrong but the presence of the Lord was very close to you and we are thankful that God is mindful of us of all of us and so we are blessed to know Jesus Christ today we are how many went home and and made good on your promise that you're going to start to do better about fellowshipping with each other and encouraging each other helping each other you know Jesus there's an old song that we sang Jesus walked along the shore one day heavy Curtin's love for others on him lay what was he doing he was looking for a friend he was looking for 12 men who would gladly follow all the way if Jesus God Himself needed a friend we do - we do - and everybody knows it's hard to be a friend with somebody who don't understand what you're going through you know if you if you are a person who don't drink alcohol with beer and whisky and things and you try to fellowship with somebody who does there ain't much fellowship because what he loves and what you love is two different things and so you want to talk about something you love and he wants to talk about something he loves next thing he knows like you don't like to drink oh well what are we doing together you ain't got nothing in common and so it's much easier to reach out to each other and on it's hard sometimes when we say brother would you pray for me sister would you pray for me I'm going through something the reason is is because we all want to be strong you know but that's not when God is glorified what did God tell Paul he said when you are weak then I am made strong my strength is perfected in your weakness what did Paul say therefore I will glory in my infirmities now that's against Christian principles isn't it it isn't but it is here because we want to be we don't want to need help we want everybody need help from me but that's not what Jesus did Jesus I will glorify glory in my infirmities in you so thank God for His mercy we want to thank you sisters for the song that was very fine brother very fine for the music god bless you sir thank you we want to look at something here tonight just a very few of us here well we want to look at something in the book of first Corinthians chapter 3 and verse I won't in Romans well I I got up getting the right book first Corinthians chapter 3 and we're going to read 21 22 and 23 therefore let no man glory in men for all things are yours whether Paul or Apollo's or Cephas and Cephas is Peter or the world or life or death or things present or things to come all are yours and here Christ's and Christ is God's may the Lord bless the reading of his word you can be seated all are yours do you believe that all now that says whether Paul now who was Paul Paul was the first church age messenger those people did not belong to Paul Paul belong to them now that's the scripture or Apollo's now who was a policy a policy was a great missionary that went with Paul the scripture talks about some of the things that happened under him great mighty miracles talks about how that man even call him God but he belonged to those people or Cephas now who is Cephas Cephas is Peter the disciple of Jesus Christ the disciple of Jesus Christ he was the one that all the other disciples looked up to and said well he's kind of our leader after Jesus or the world all things in the world are yours is the scripture true now what's in the world what's in the world air light time dust structures buildings nature they all are yours or life what's in life everything everything I don't care what is in life it belongs to you or death their brother and I was talking about his wife passing away all that belongs to you all is yours Oh or things present what's present in your life today whatever it is it's not something that controls you it belongs to you therefore you control it how many read that with me how many read that scripture with me so I'm not making this up Emma this is God Himself speaking through the first church age messenger who set the example for all afterwards he's saying to you that you have it all whether it be a preacher a messenger an apostle or life or things in the world or death or things present or things to come I think I woke somebody up so what is to come it doesn't matter what's in it it belongs to you it belongs to you that's by the Word of God now does it belong to anybody who can read these words that's right it doesn't belong to anybody who can just read it belongs to a certain kind of people so do you believe that do you really believe that in life there's joy their sadness their sorrow their sickness there's pain their suffering there's overcoming there's redemption there's grace there's mercy all of that is yours all of it not just redemption not just grace not just mercy judgment casting away binding causing sickness sickness belongs to you why do we act like we belong to it why do we act like suffering is our master why do we act like joy has to come only when things are joyful if it belongs to us why do we wait why don't we take it the way we're supposed to take it no let's take a young lady and the reason I always pick a young lady is because we are supposed to be the bride of Jesus Christ and so if I pick a young man that young man would always represent Jesus Christ we're not Jesus Christ we're the body of Jesus Christ that's on the earth today but as far as being Jesus Christ we're not we're the bride that belongs to Jesus Christ therefore I always choose a young lady and the young lady that I have chosen to use as an example today is a lady that I don't think anybody has ever preached on and she was the daughter of a high priest of a false God ha ha how does that represent the bride because this daughter of the high priest of a false God became the wife of Joseph in the days back in Genesis now this lady will turn with to Genesis chapter 41 and we're going to take her life for just a little bit and all we can go on is the scripture I've never read any history books on this girl I've never read where anybody's ever done a documentary on her or even on her family or her father or the high priest of that particular time so all we can go off of is what the scripture says Genesis chapter 41 and we're going to read verse 45 and pharaoh called Joseph's name zaphenath-paneah I hope I said that right that's a big name and he gave him to wife asana --the the daughter of pot of Farah priest of on and Joseph went out over all the land of Egypt and what I want you to notice here is that this young lady I don't know how she was Joseph was thirty at this time he was thirty years old the Bible says so for you young girls are sitting back here he was an old man or some of the older young girls he wasn't old when you're 25 and single thirty is not very old but for you guys he would be an old man at that age at thirty years old and no doubt that there had been rumors and there had been gossip and there had been great things that were spoken of this young man Joseph who was a prisoner but yet he had come through from the great prison of death up to where he was at the very right hand of Pharaoh he was not a nobody he was eight somebody no doubt if they had the magazines in those days his picture was on every magazine as you walked out the grocery store and you look at the magazine every one of them had Joseph's face on and no doubt every young girl in that neck of the woods was dreaming of Mary and Joseph because Joseph had never been married and he was one hot man and they was looking and dreaming and talking and talent everybody yeah he's gonna pick me I know because he looked at me the other day that's what I've heard before whether is true or not ain't never had a guy look at me so I don't want a guy to look at me and so these young ladies were all dreaming of Joseph that they would become his wife now Joseph didn't have a choice of who his wife was and neither did his wife have a choice in the matter because the greatest king in the land didn't ask him who would you like to marry the greatest king in the land didn't come to this that's enough and say hey would you like to marry Joseph he said I have pronounced it and it is law Joseph shall marry this woman there was no choice in the matter but this woman this girl has enough I I think I'm saying that right she grew up in a religious home and she knew what it was to be a servant to a god because her father was the high priest and so therefore what he done at the temple had to be carried on into his home and she knew that what he said was as if it came from God himself because that's who she worshiped she worshipped the God that her father told her to worship and so she knowing this knew that her life was bound to that God but then the King came along with his great decree and he says to her and to Joseph you too shall become one and they became one but now while she this girl was in her father's household she was subject to every law that he laid down she was subject to it but when she married Joseph and became one with Joseph she was no longer bound under any of those laws what was she then let's read the very last sentence of verse 45 and Joseph went out over all the land of Egypt now what belonged to Asuna oh now she didn't have it all at one time but because she had a union with Joseph all that belonged to him belong to her so everything and the scripture says and he went out over all the land of Egypt what did the Great King say the Great King said there is none higher than Joseph except myself the Great King everything belonged to Joseph everything all the wheat the read the scriptures the scripture says all the land all the water everything belong to Joseph every man belong to Joseph every woman belong to Joseph everything belonged to him why because God had raised him into that place and it belonged to nobody else except his wife that was it every girl that dreamed of becoming his life dreamed of owning all that stuff as well but there was only one who owned it that was asking that that was the one who had become one with Joseph now read on further the scripture says that it became the law in the land that when the trumpet blowed every knee would bow to Joseph that's the word of God but what did a senesce do when the trumpet blowed she didn't bother me she was setting beside of him they were not only bowing the knee to him but they were bound to me to her also because she was part of him so everything that Joseph owned belonged to her after she had had a union with him now as long as she was still this daughter of the high priest it didn't belong to her but when she left all of that and became one with Joseph then it all belonged to her Derrick no doubt in the tally little story now I'm making this little story up to go with this as we're talking this one day Joseph had gone out in the caravan and he had done some business and as he was coming back the great trumpets were blown and everybody would stop and bow the knee and as he was climbing up the stairs to his great mansion his wife was in the house and the trumpets were blowing and all the servants in the house we're bowing their knees and he walked through the door and I said that says Joseph come here I want you to move this picture over to here well all the servants were bowing down why wasn't she bowing down that was the law she was above the law because the law pertained to her by becoming one with Joseph now all of these things that we just read all are yours only applies to you if you've become one with Jesus Christ why because he's the one who created them all he owns every one of them he didn't only make the physical things he made not only the the rocks and the hills and the waters and the rivers and the trees and the animals but he made powers described to me how you would make something called honor how would you make that I have no clue what is honor it's when somebody does something great and they get honored for it well how do you make that how do you make honor I don't know but he made it how do you make a government that has control over people I don't know but he made it how do you make high a principality I don't know but he made it so it belongs to him and if I can somehow leave being the son or the daughter of a religion and become one with Jesus Christ then all of that belongs to me as well but unless I do that it doesn't belong to me it still belongs to him because he's that he's the rightful owner of it now let's go just a step farther let's go to the book of Revelation and we're going to begin at verse or a chapter five I believe it is yes Revelation chapter 5 and I said verse 1 and I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with seven seals now that book we know what that book was because God took that very book in this day and brought it to us it was the book of redemption and what the book of redemption was if I could take this book and make it in a way like that this being the book had seven seals or seven bands around that book was the people or the ones who were the rightful heirs to all that God Christ had created so this book was very important because it told if you if all these things belong to you if your names in here it belongs to you if your name's not in here I don't care how much you believe this is right it don't belong to you and so this book is very important now through the ages there has literally been millions millions billions of people who claim that their name is on this book but the book is closed so there's no way to know if your name is on this book anybody can claim it anybody can say it's there but until God takes these seven bands off of this book opens it up and finds your name you don't know you can guess you can hope you can have faith but once God opens that book and sees your name on there then God is obligated to do something to you not if you find your name on there we'll show you that let's read revelations 10 now let's go back to five before we go there I want to read here it says verse two and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof and no man in heaven nor in earth neither under the earth was able to open the book neither to look on the book no man now that was you that was me that was you that was every person that's in here you was looked at at this time God brought your name up before him and said is she worthy to open the book is he worthy to open the book is he worthy is he is she is he is she is he every person on the earth every person who had ever been on the earth and every person who ever would be on the earth came before God and God looked him and said are you worthy and the answer was no not only to loosen and to open it but you couldn't even look at it you was before God and you were found unworthy so was every person in this building including myself including John now now let's turn to revelation 10 let's read verse 1 let's read verse 2 rather than 1 and he had in his hand a little book open now what happened was from the time where we read that there was a book that was sealed no man could look at it no man could even open it or even look at it that there came and laying forth who was worthy and he took it and he opened it up not here on earth in heaven and he began to look and whose names was on there and he said hey there's some of them people's names they're still on the earth all the other names are here in heaven but there's some still on earth I gotta go down there and take this to them not the ones in heaven it didn't do them any good because they were already dead they needed somebody to bring them back to life and so Jesus begins to look in the book and he says oh I see your name I see your name oh I gotta go to earth so he leaves heaven and he comes to the earth come in come in sit down somewhere you look familiar and so he leaves heaven with this book and this book is open now let's read revelations 10 - and he had in his hand a little book open and he said his right foot upon the sea and his left foot upon the earth now let's drop down to verse 8 we know what that other one was I was concerning a prophet that was to come in the land and he came a verse 8 says and the voice which I heard from heaven spake unto me now each person stop right there and where it says me you put your name there just like that little sailor boy told that old dying captain the old dying captain out on the sea he said I'm dying that was a little Christian boy he said you don't have to die captain he said how can I stop from dying he said because the scripture says he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquity and the chastisement of our peace was upon him and by His stripes ye were healed he said how can I make that real to me he said put your name where it says ye and so the old captain said by his choice captain John was healed and he jumped up out of bed and he didn't have to die now tonight can you put your name where he says and that voice spake unto who exactly who ever yours whoever you're looking at did he speak to you why if you weren't even worthy to look at that book just a little bit ago why would God that voice speak and say to you to you to you to you to you you go take the little book we can stop and say but I'm not worthy he said I know it but the one who was worthy took your place and so he would begin to say unto who me who did he begin to talk to who did he begin to talk to you he began to talk to you because when it says me when I read that that says me you've got to see you in the scripture spoke unto me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which stands upon the scene upon the earth and who verse 9 and it says and what's the next word is that you is that you it's written but we've got to know it's written for us just like that ass enough knew that when she married Joseph everything and Egypt belong to her she had to know that if not Judah said Hojo's near um-um you think of us all right if I go down and buy us some fish for dinner she was his wife it was her job to prepare the dinner and so she didn't have to ask she says go get some fish because those fish belong to her by her union with Joseph now because verse 9 and it says and I went unto the angel and asked him is that what your scripture says what does it say and I said unto Him don't that sound a little biggity told that sound a little bit like ha you think you're something don't you know and I went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book he didn't ask for it he said give me the little book and he said unto me who did he say it to again me take it take it are you unworthy not anymore why because you had a union with Jesus Christ what does the scripture says it says he who knew no sin became sin that you might become the righteousness of God through him not through me not through my church not through this message but through Jesus Christ that's the only place we can stand today you will never stand anywhere else I don't care how much in this message you believe the message is true but if you come to this message without coming to Christ first you were born in adultery and you can never stand to that angel and say give me the little book you will be struck with death because you have no right to that book but when he looks on that book and he sees your name then he's obligated to come to you with the book you're not obligated to go to him until that voice says to you go take the little book but once that voice what is that voice it's the voice of God and the voice of God would never tell you to do something that was contrary to the Word of God and so when that voice of God begins to speak to you and says you go take the little book and you take it remember you can't take it unless you've already been one with Jesus Christ once you've become one with Jesus Christ he comes and gives all to you all but did we read in first Corinthians all are yours whether it be a minister whether it be a messenger to the church eight let's read it again first Corinthians chapter three god bless you all come in come in I'm sorry I'm gonna have to start over I think well words we're going right back to the very first scripture anyway so we'll just kind of well kind of start over you wanted to hear it again anyway didn't you brother god bless you all it's very very fine every one of you here god bless you is very much we had a very wonderful singing a brother sang a song walk in the light oh we got a walk in the light where does that like lead what these two little sisters saying how beautiful heaven must be but if we walk in that light that's where it leads but we started our service sermon with this scripture first Corinthians do we need an interpreter no interpreter okay if we need one we got one right here if we if you think it would be better we'll bring him up it's okay okay I'm sorry I would need an interpreter i I you guys speak good English and good friends I don't even speak good English it's a no but first Corinthians chapter three and verse 21 if you have your Bibles with you if you need your Bibles if you need a Bible I'm sure there's some around somewhere does anybody need a Bible you need a Bible you got their phones oh that's very good I you know there's a great debate in the message of whether you should be allowed to carry a phone with the Bible on it I said really and you know into church because some feel you need to have a Bible and I you know that's fine but if you don't have the spirit this is not going to do you any good you got to have the Spirit of God before you can understand this anyway whether it comes on this form or on the phone like the phone important part the Spirit of God so we began to read in 1st Corinthians chapter 3 verse 21 I will try to slow down a little bit I see them interpreting some so I'll slow down a little bit I get very excited I I'm sorry 1st Corinthians chapter 3 verse 21 therefore let no man glory in men for all things are yours all things are yours now let's read verse 22 whether Paul who was Paul he's a first Church age of messenger whether Paul or Apollo's now who was Apollo's he was a missionary an apostle and what did God say he set first in the church apostles isn't that what the scripture says and God set first in the church apostles then prophets so here we have a church age messenger and an apostle which was set first in the church and then it says or Cephas which is Peter who is that great apostle that we all look to that followed Jesus Christ they all belong to you the messenger the Apostles these great men don't glory in them they belong to you or the world what's in the world everything the air is in the world the storms the clouds the earth the nature the the the elements steal rocks animals whatever's in the world is all yours that's the scripture or life what's in life everything it's all yours or death it's all yours you remember brother branham said death is your servant death is your servant you cannot death cannot come and take you until you let it death is your servant or things present whatever's in your life right now belongs to you if it's troubles if it's joy if it's heartaches if it's if it's good things if it's bad things if it's wonderful things if it's hatred if it's bitterness if it's jealousy if it's trouble with your wife if it's trouble with your husband if it's trouble with your mama and your Papa you've dirt whatever it belongs to you that's not my words that's his words or things to come that covers everything it doesn't matter what it is it is yours every ministry belongs to you every ministry we've got it turned around today that we belong to the ministry how no what did Jesus Christ say he said it shall not be so among you for in the Gentiles the preacher becomes a big guy but it shall not be so among you let the little guy let him who thinks he's greatest become the smallest why because all things belong to you under one circumstance if you become one with Jesus Christ that's it I took the scripture in Genesis will turn to it again Genesis chapter 41 I thank God that he let these men come in a little bit late thank you God God needed to hear it again it's so I I a very grateful for that sometimes it seems like things are way off and God's like I got it don't worry about there was a young lady we read it Genesis chapter 41 and verse 45 and pharaoh called Joseph's name Zephaniah and he gave him to wife a Sanath of the daughter of pada farah the priest of on and Joseph went out over all the land of Egypt you need to read it ok and so this lady was just a common girl just a common girl no great fancy things about her except her dad was a real big preacher that's what the scripture says was a priest in arm and so she didn't have a choice who she was going to marry Joseph didn't have a choice who she was going to marry the Great King brought them together as one and what does the scripture say happens when Joseph did that he went out over all the land of Egypt everything in Egypt belonged to Joseph but when this girl a senesce married Joseph it all belonged to her why because he was a good girl because he was a bad girl no because the King chose her to become the wife of Joseph now in order for her to become the wife of Joseph become one with him what did she have to do she had to leave her church her daddy was the priest of this church in order for her to become one with Joseph and all of Egypt to be gone to her she had to leave her religion what if her religion was the message ever become one with Jesus Christ and you believe this message you're in adultery because this message was only sent to the bride of Jesus Christ and if you are saying I am the bride of Jesus Christ but I've never become one with Jesus Christ you saying this message belongs to you that makes you a liar because you have to be one with Jesus Christ you have to leave your religion I don't care if it is a message religion you cannot be in that church and belong to Jesus Christ why because Jesus Christ is not in a church he's in his word and in order for us to be one with him we have to leave that just like this girl did her daddy was the high priest her daddy was the great preacher but she had to leave that to become one with him and when she became one with him all that was in Egypt belonged to her what does the scripture say he who knew no sin became sin that we might become the righteousness of God by him when we join with him one with him not when we just believe on him not when we just say well I believe God sent a prophet now when we say oh I believe everything that's in that message but when God Himself comes down and lives in that body and lives in each one then you become the message to the world where's the Prophet now he's not here now when the Prophet was here on the earth there was no doctrine of Malachi four five and six what was it if you wanted to see Malachi four or five and six you went and watched the Prophet it wasn't a doctrine it was living it came out and what and called you out it came out and told you what was going on it told you there was no doctrine involved with it no people believed it all right but it was not a doctrine it was a life that was when that word came off of that Bible and stood in flesh and discerned the thoughts and intents of the heart so if God had to do that in that man what does he got to do in you and unless you leave your doctrines and your principles of what you call church and join Jesus Christ he cannot do it he cannot live in you if all we have his church if all we have is our church set in the right order if all we have is well we sing a few songs and we do this but unless God can come and live in this body the same way he lived in that body it's all in vain let's go back revelations chapter 10 how how how can Christ come and live in you how did Joseph manifest and bring forth life through his wife by becoming one himself spoke in a message called the token he said that great judgment angel is here in the land today the same one that was in the days of Moses and he said he's looking and there's something that he's requiring and he said he is not requiring you to believe the message he said if that's all you've got is believing the message it's not enough the death angel will strike what is the death angel looking for he's looking for the literal life of Jesus Christ in flesh bodies he's not looking for good people he's not looking for bad people he's not looking for church order he's not looking for message books he's not looking for Bibles he's not looking for message tapes I'm sorry I'm going too fast okay what's he looking for he's looking for God himself in you and if he does not find that out comes the great sword and strikes it dead Revelations Tim how is the little girl with her teeth oh why don't you tell it it's a good time to tell it wonderful that's right amen amen that's God that's God all things are yours that was steel or metal of some kind in her in her mouth but it belonged to me it belonged to sister Brooks it belonged to that little girl why not because we believe the message we should believe the message don't I please don't take me wrong and what I'm saying but believing the message does not make all things belong to you that metal wire in her mouth belonged to us because of our union with Jesus Christ amen revelations 10 verse 8 and the voice which I heard from heaven spake unto what some next words me who is me whoever's reading it so when it says me and you're reading it who's he talking to you he's talking to you what his sister Brooks reading it who's he talking to he's talking to me whoever's reading when he's talking to this lady this lady he's talking to you isn't he why because this book is a love letter from God to who that's right is that a love letter to this church no then why do we gather at church because we want to draw strength we want to be able to look at our brother and say brother are you fighting a battle and help him sister likes it what if she had to come to church today what if she hadn't said well he's hurting too bad let's stay home you know what gets me it used to be that when God lived in a man called William Branham the sick people came to church but what happens now the sick people stay home what's wrong I thought God was the same yesterday today and forever we was in Ohio and they closed the whole church down because the people were sick what they can't be serving the same God I'm serving because my god he owes I'm sorry I don't mean to disrespect those people I don't mean that but why don't we come with the same thing they had been in the days of Peter and the Apostles what they do they said come on buddy you're sick you're gone look but I don't feel like it will carry you we can't get in we'll dig a hole in the rough but what do we do today oh I better stay home I'm sick friends if all you have is coming to church you need something more first eight revelations ten and the voice which I have which I heard from heaven spake unto me again I like that little part again because that means he had already been in contact with God this wasn't his first time and thereby when God opened that book loosed him seven seals and God began to look on that book and he began to read somebody's name he said oh I see a name here that's still on the earth I got to go to the earth and give this book to them because this belongs to them and so God recognized your name on this book before you did and God came to you and said hey your name is on here take it it's yours and everything that's in it belongs to you it don't belong to God anymore it belongs to you because he paid the price for you and God says I see your name if God sees your name on his book of Redemption and he gives you the book and then you make a claim God ain't gonna set back and say well I hope it works no God's gonna say come here all you angels come here are you terrible's come on we got some work to do this ain't the seventh day got ain't good working oh no God still working and so when you make a claim based on the Word of God and stand there and say god I see my name in this book you gave this title to me and because you gave that to me I make a claim about my brother who stood out there and look like his blaspheme what does God say what is your judgment upon your brother what does the scripture say either accusing or excusing one another that's you are you accusing your brethren or are you excusing your brethren so God says to you what do you decide about your brother it's up to you and he waits for your decision now look when you make your decision on what's going to happen you've made a decision on your children and God says to Satan Satan I want you to prove to her that she's right Satan don't come to do Satan's will Satan can only do God's will in this circumstance because God has revealed to you what will happen with your children and therefore you speak thus saith the Lord then God says I want her to be completely strong and steadfast so therefore because all is hurt Satan is hers also I command you Satan to go help her and strengthen her so what does Satan do he cast every storm he can against her he cast every doubt that he can against her why because God is making her style oh we look at it so wrong we look at and say oh god please take this away God says I'm just helping you how bad did it look on him three Hebrew children he looked pretty bad let me ask you something when them three Hebrew children were bound and their guards were pushing them to the fire and the fire killed their guards why did they keep walking would you would you stop and say hey I don't have to go in there they're dead no they kept walking they walked right in their guards wasn't the one doing it their God was the one that was doing it they were just following him did they find their God when their guards died nope did they find their God when the King made the great decree nope did they find their God when they said whether he keeps us or not we don't care no they didn't find their God then but they found him at the absolute worst time that there was and so will you you won't find him when the ways are easy we don't look for him when things are going so good did we pray very much what did David say he said I follow the Lord then I get cold and I fall away and God picks me up again and I serve him awhile then I get cold and I fall again and he picks me up and I serve God a while then I get cold and I fall again and he picks me up again we're the same way but all belongs to you all belongs to you let me say again not because you believe the message that does not bring all to you what brings all to you is your union with Jesus Christ now let's read again 1st Corinthians chapter 3 21 therefore let no man glory in men for all things are yours whether Paul first church age messenger now let me say this or brother branham the seventh church age messenger it belongs to you or a palace who's a missionary who's an apostle I am you have to know your calling in God or you ain't gonna be much good when we were little kids you know we try and run around we all as we were little kids and we heard how brother branham spoke them squirrels into existence we'd run out in the words that there be a squirrel why we was trying to be like him we wanted to be like him we didn't know what we was but that was our hero we wanted to be like he did so surely God would hear us but he did but once we grew up we had to know our calling you have to be able to go through this and say that scripture is mine that's good two stalks of meat you find another scoot all that scripture talks of me it don't matter if you're called to the ministry or not you've got to know where your place is in the Word of God I lost my place 1st Corinthians 3 whether it be Paul the messenger or a palace a great apostle or Cephas a great apostle said don't glory in men or the world whatever if it's in the world now this has been open and it's in the world today and if you have been in that union with Jesus Christ it belongs to you if all you have done is believed that this is opened come to Jesus Christ come to him and let him let him give this book to you he's the original owner I I can't give it to you brother Branham couldn't give it to you each man had to go for themselves now why did brother Branham say he said no group is getting their own revelation and no individual is getting a private revelation they are all getting a revelation that has already been given by way of the messenger it isn't the messenger that's given you the revelation it's God that's giving you the revelation that he gave to the messenger you can't say well I believe the messenger that's not a union with Jesus Christ you've got to come to Jesus Christ that's why we've got so much failings going on in the message churches that's why we've got so much division in the message churches is because it's nothing but a message we've taken Christ out of it and made our own message what does the scripture say if I be lifted up from the earth I will draw all men to me not if the message be lifted up from the earth friends I listen to a message about a month ago preached by a great message preacher and this message preacher said these words he said if you believe that our profession I didn't want appreciation 1 so I had to look it up it means one who stands in your place one who takes your sins this man message preacher he said if you believe that our perpetuation is Jesus Christ of two thousand years ago you are sadly mistaken and he went on to say this message is our profession my friends that's a lie there's only one propitiation that's that bleeding bloody lamb the one who came and tucked the book and opened the seals now friends this wasn't preached a couple years ago this was preached by a man who walked with William Branham he's one of the greatest message preachers there is in the world his known world around his messages go world around and it was preached in 1988 and he hasn't changed it since but yet he has called the greatest leader in the message can you see why Jesus Christ is not in the message churches because they've rejected him as our propitiated and replaced it with something else who cannot replace Jesus Christ if you replace Jesus Christ whatever you replace him with makes you Antichrist Jesus Christ our union with him makes you possessor of all things no you say is there a way to know if you've been in this union with Jesus Christ that's a good question because anybody can make that claim or the random said what the Spirit says the Prophet says and what the Spirit says through the Prophet the bride will be saying the same thing and he said what they will be saying is this come out of her my people if all were saying is come to a message church we're not saying what the Prophet said I listen to the quote this morning brother Branham said he was preaching the message called God God's chosen place of worship and he said friends I am responsible for a message and he said that message is this come out of this mess and if I'm telling you to come out I have to take you somewhere this is still what he said and he said where am I going to take you he said well I take you to the Branham Tabernacle he said it's just as bad as any of them that was his chart he said where can I take you Jesus Christ we've taken the phrase where he said this message is Christ and we've made it Antichrist Jesus Christ came back with the open book that's the message but we've made a bunch of doctrines and creeds and laws and said that's Christ that isn't Christ it's the bleeding bloody land where do you stand where do I stand in the days in the Garden of Eden brother Brahim said we're back in that day again the same temptation that tempted Eve is in the land today the same temptation what was that temptation when Satan gave Eve knowledge of God's Word the same temptation today the temptation today Satan will give you knowledge of this message but you have to give him something you have to reject the Holy Ghost and once you reject the Holy Ghost what do you get the mark of the beast but you get knowledge of this message God's not looking for knowledge of this message God's looking for his life in you in you and me he's not looking for a church he's not looking for a group he's looking for his bride and his bride there was many beautiful girls in the days of Joseph but the great king made a decree and said that one might be pretty over there that one might be pretty over there but this is the one that's Mary and Joseph and a little lady it was probably a couple of times he thought I don't want this uh that's a lot of responsibility but you know what it wasn't because all the responsibility that she thought she had was on him it was nothing on her there was not one person in the whole land of Egypt that could come up to her and say listen lady you're gonna answer for that not one person could do that not one not even the great king because he didn't have rule over her she belonged to him she belonged to Joseph if he wanted her to ask for something he had to go to Joseph and Joseph would say honey come here come here baby let's talk how many times has Jesus Christ done that to you when we deserved a good thump we deserved a good beating and we knew it we hang our head oh I'm so sorry what would he do come down there with his little nail-scarred hand but around her shoulders it draws close and say your forgive her and not make it worse than if he punished us you know has that ever happened to you I think it'll happen again but let me say to you today as we stand to our feet if you have never had that voice from heaven speak directly to you and say you go take that book I'm not talking about a good feeling I'm not talking about thinking well it probably belongs to me or standing up in emotion but when the mighty God comes to you and says this is yours not the preacher but God if you've never had that it's because you've never had a union with Jesus Christ and you can have that God will not call God will not take this book to someone who is not part of Christ he can't but if God is calling in your heart right now right now some thing that's just like that's almost you're afraid to breathe because you know something's here and like baby was talking to me what is this what is this it's God calling for you it's God saying I want you to be part of me I want you to have this union it isn't you reaching out to God it's God reaching out to you as we bow our heads if you are in that little voice in your heart that God wants you would you accept would you just slip your hand up to him and say god I feel your call and me oh Jesus once again your mercy has come we look we see that great mercy seat were you laid for those two thousand years is empty and there's no mercy to look upon up there anymore but down here where you are act the mercy is many times greater than it was and God there was hands that was raised to you tonight hands that answered the call that you gave to each heart they raised that hand to you like that little ice on earth raised to Joseph that's a Joseph though my father was a great priest and well honored I follow you your ways are my ways I no longer follow in my desires but I follow in yours oh God thank you that your mercy is so great and I ask you O God to vindicate to each one that raised their hand Lord come to them in that way bring this open book to them Lord that God they can realize that all belongs to them that there is nothing whether it be in principalities or messengers or preachers or worlds or lives or deaths or things present or things to come that it all belongs to us Thank You O God for that great mercy and the name of Jesus Christ Amy there is a fountain filled with blood drawn from Emmanuel's veins and sinners plunged beneath that flood lose all their guilty State you who raised your hand a few moments ago you still belong to that religion to that church but because you see God I accept you I accept that bloody lamb then not only was slain back there but slain before the foundation of the world and he came forth in time and he took that book the same land that same lamp came to the earth in a spirit form and he came to you tonight and he changed because I preached the message no because he came I could preach from now for the rest of my days it wouldn't change nothing but if he comes one tiny bit it changes everything and to you was had that union with Jesus Christ you who've been discouraged and down and we God is asking you tonight in your weakness because it's in your weakness that he has made strong he's asking you tonight what would you have me to do it's got a servant has got a man that he can be commanded no but he is a husband and it's his desire to know what your desire is and if you can stand upon this principle the Word of God and stand there steadfast what you say will be all things are yours what was the prophet brought for in this day to restore the faith that is it yours does it feel like it's yours no that's not faith faith isn't based on feelings faith isn't based on this faith isn't based on this faith is based on love and forgiveness so that they can reach out in this word anything that's in here and say God I have need of this I desire this and God says yes and then it will be I told brother Isaac before the service I'm sure some of you have heard this testimony I hate to keep making you stand but it somehow feel led to do this there was a lady back in the six 1960s her and her husband had gone to California to meet with brother Branham in a meeting and when they got there to California they met several others that had come for that purpose not to hearing preach but to simply have their needs met by God and they all discussed their situations so each of them knew the other ones situations and in the meeting brother Branham called every one of them and told every one of them their situation and when he called this woman's husband told her exactly his situation he said and your wife who is barren shall have a son about this time next year they left the man was healed all the other ones were healed when they got home the woman went to the radio station and she got on live radio and declared william branham a false prophet even though she was pregnant hadn't been pregnant before she put it in the newspapers that william branham was leading people against christ and she convinced her neighbors to turn against william branham she had the baby and she still was telling people that william branham was a false prophet it's pretty serious the baby grew up to about eight months old and it got sick its boughs twisted inside the father called brother Branham told him the situation told him everything didn't tell him about his wife told him that he had been called out that his wife would have a baby and she had the baby but the baby was dying and brother Branham said to the man sir can I speak to your wife and he gave the phone to his wife and immediately his wife started to cry and she said brother Branham I've blaspheme he said all sister you've not blaspheme he said yes I have she said you don't know what I've done she said I've went on the radio I went in the newspaper I've convinced churches I've convinced people you're a false prophet he said old sister you haven't blaspheme see some but I have he said you take that dishrag you're holding in your hand and you go put it on that baby and let's see if you've blaspheme she took the dishrag and she walked to the baby put the his rag on the baby and immediately the boughs unwound and I had a bowel movement did she blaspheme she probably did but it was the mercy of God through that prophet that took that blaspheming away will God do the same for you are you greater than the Prophet yes because he belongs to you you are the bride of Jesus Christ he was the messenger from Jesus Christ to you not trying to put him down but putting you where you belong as far as messengers there was no greater but as far as the Bride of Christ there is no greater either you belong to Jesus Christ what is your judgment what do you say about the one who sins against you do you condemn him or do you say God please don't hold it to their charge yes they deserve punishment they deserve to go to hell but so did I and you forgave me God will you forgive them also the great prophet Moses stood before God one day and there was a people that God had already cursed and he told Moses he said come here I'm gonna kill them all they're dead Moses said to God God take my name off of your book and leave theirs on would you do that would you do that to your hurt to a person that God has already cursed and stricken away from him and yet Moses because Christ was in his heart he said God you take my name off of the book he knew what that meant he knew if his name was taken off that book it was over can you do the same was Christ in Moses isn't the same Christ in you if it was Christ in Moses under the blood of bulls and goats and now it's literally Christ the life in you what will it do today let me say well you from this day forward every person that's here will you from this day forward instead of revealing your brother or your sister will you lift them up and hold them up in prayer and if they have done wrong will you throw yourself in their place and say God punish me instead could you do that without Christ no we can't but I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me will you do that will you raise your hand and say god I raised my hand please help me hold God from this day forth I can let the love of God shine so forth in me that when I see a brother I see his sister stumble and fall that old God I will raise them up and help them back on the path Lord that old God I can reach down to the lowest pits they pull them up on the straight and narrow trail again Lord Oh God strike out of our hearts any bitterness any anger jealousy Lord and old God may that true love of God come forth into each of our hearts Lord God we will no longer say I'm a church I'm part of a church and I'm part of Christ and make her stand in that great king let's sing that song Amazing Grace how sweet the sound army zing grace how sweet I'd say me I was lost but now I'm found was blind but now I see Joe's grace that taught my heart to fear and grace my fears read [Applause] our ranchers need that grace appear the hour I first hear is something changing here you can't change that only God can change that remember sister Ruby them years ago when you'd pray and that didn't matter how tired you was that did it something came on didn't it's that same on he never left us some of our young people raised their hand because God was dealing with them brother Branham said Satan three times in history targeted young people once in the days of Moses he killed children two years down once in the days of Jesus he killed children two years down and he said and now today he started targeting young people that's you that's these young people here that's his young man here Satan is targeting them especially them why because they're the next generation so if you find time to pray pray for these young people Satan will hit him with everything he's got everything do you love the Lord hate me does anybody need prayer for anything I'm glad brother Troy mated today with service there in Iowa City is that the family is alright and had problems wonderful wonderful I do have one request I would like to make known brother a friend of mine he was a Spanish man from Mexico and he when he came to the Lord he had a knife that he was going to kill me with and the Lord the Lord saved me and saved him to you and so I thank the Lord for that but tomorrow at one o'clock he's to go to court to see if they will ship make him go back to Mexico or be able to stay here and so keep him in your prayers it's a very rough man a very rough man and but now he's a child of God and so we if you remember his name is Ezekiel I don't know what it is in Spanish Chucky or something like that but if you could remember to please pray for him he's he said he doesn't if they send him back to Mexico that would be fine but if they send him back he has to go back to the very place where he was the drug King in that area and so he don't want to go back to that but maybe God wants him to go back to that I don't know but I told him I said brother Ezekiel if God wants you there that's the best place you can be so keep in your prayers not that God keeps him from there but that God puts him where God wants him to be maybe one of us who was never caught up in those drugs and those kinds of things and murders and we might not be able to testify to those kinds of people but he can because he's changed God came and changed him so even though it looks dark to him it's the best place he can be if that's where God wants him so let's pray that God's will be done for further Ezekiel sister Sarah rather Isaac's sister has fallen away from the Lord but God is calling her back let's keep her in prayer and each other each other let's keep each other in prayer may God bless each one of you I count each one a very dear friend brother and sister in Christ each one I may not know each one but I know him and you know him and he knows you and he knows me I count each of you as a dear I see the brother back there with the great testimony of his heart only being 1/4 of his heart working and God still using him that's wonderful 75 years old god bless you brother the brother in the back god bless you sir thank you for your stand that you've made over the years for this brother here losing his wife yes still standing so strongly each one has a great testimony and I wish I knew each one that I could tell I don't but God does God does I will say this the greatest testimony that could ever be told happened here tonight but these young ladies raised in their hand to Jesus Christ with these people saying god I've had a religion I've had a church but I haven't had you that's the greatest testimony there is that's the greatest why because even if God heals us if time goes on they'll come a time we have to die but if we've been one with Christ we'll never die I'm sorry to keep you so low brother Isaac come up I I get long-winded and I'm sorry so god bless every one of you very much in May nudes rings and sinners
