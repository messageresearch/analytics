TRANSCRIPT
========================================
so i am going with the faith that i will overcome and in the winding and goliath goes down amen you have you have the prophets of old amen uh elijah even when he was facing joseph l amen he was facing all those it meant persecutions and people wanted to kill him amen he had god to protect him amen you have you have moses amen when when you've been facing pharaoh and then pharaoh was against him and wanted to kill him amen he went to god he looked upon god and god said that why do you cry speak the word amen and he spoke the word and the reds he was divided amen you have daniel we met when everybody told him not to pray and and and everybody that you met there sent him to the dead of lions amen but daniel didn't fear because he believed in god and he went and started praying and he have the three people's children even when the fiery furnace was before them and the king told them to to worship that that's their true amen they're still there even with the faith that god would deliver us yes amended still there believing that our prayer has been heard amen and god would deliver that amen even though we died but we will not even one time worship this this god even we not even want to worship this statue because we we we pledge our alliance amen to the lamb of god amen because we worship only one god which is the god which is the god of moses amen we worship only one god which is the god of abraham which is the god of isaac and the god of jacob so there is no other god that we can worship amen they believed in that god amen they put the entire faith in that god amen and that god came to their rescue and then he was the fourth man in the fire amen whatever situation that you find yourself into amen whatever things that you want to take to god i mean it doesn't matter how small it is i mean it doesn't matter how big that thing is even when you just go to him and express yourself to him amen god likes it when we come to him and we have that conversation amen you go to god and you say lord i know that you know my heart amen lord i know that amen the bible says that before i even open my mouth you already know what i want to ask but lord nevertheless i just want to open my mouth and expand the situation to you amen and god will hear your prayer amen because he gave this word amen this word about the prophet says that this word has been time tested amen this word this bible went through any kind of test amen but but if it came out it came out to be victorious amen because the word of god never fails amen when god gives his word amen that word will not fail amen in that word whenever the son of god would take this word amen and believe in it and he will have the same result amen amen it's not it's not a time it's not a time for the church to be sad amen it's not a time for you to be sad and to start complaining and to start amen amen and going back and forth and asking yourself why why am i going through this and why why you know why god is not coming to my rescue and why this and that amen you have to be happy amen because god you know that there is a god who hears your prayers amen you may he might not come when you want it it might he might not come when you expect him but he'll always be there amen because sometimes our timing and god's timing amen doesn't go always the same place amen the god doesn't amen that doesn't really i mean sometimes you need god the most in one time and god doesn't show up that doesn't mean that he will not show up that means that amen that's not his time amen sometimes our time is not god's time amen we just have to keep the faith and keep believing amen that god will always show up amen those three hebrews children could have been crying that hey god we we we are about to go to that fire he meant god that the door is already open and the the the king they say that to hit that fire seven times god where when are you gonna show up amen they could have been saying those things amen but god was waiting amen until they go in that fire and then he will show up even god could have showed up god could have killed the king or killed everybody and and turned that fire off but god wanted to express his power amen because god sometimes wants to show up and to tell the people that he's a powerful god amen that's what he did in egypt egypt amen he could have just take the children of israel and bring them to the promised land even but he had to show pharaoh that he is a god and he is a one and true god amen that's why they had to go all through all these things amen a real believer the prophet says that a real believer when god says anything he takes it and acts upon it even he doesn't fast about it doesn't ask questions he says that you don't know how you'll get up without you out of that chair and get a word from there tonight see you don't know how you're going to do this and how you and how these other diseases are going to be healed but at that word lord i'm going to lay down the net and thy word lord i'm going to rise up from here i don't know how i'm going to do it but at the word lord that's it take god at his word and god's spoken word will materialize and produce just exactly what he says it will listen the right manner the right mental attitude towards god's divine towards any divine promises of god will bring it to pass you don't care it i don't care what it is if you plant or if you want if you want to call if you want corn you plant corn water corn leave corn alone it will produce corn is that right we will produce wheat the promise of salvation will produce a christian the promise of the holy ghost will bring it to you the promise of divine healing will make you well any divine promise of god and the bible say that in the bible say that the word of god is a seed is that right amen the word of god is a seed amen you just take that seed and and you plant it in your heart amen you let it there let it sit there and then you just keep on watering that seed with the word of god and with the songs and if we can just keep it under a good atmosphere amen and one day you will raise them and one day you will wake up and then you will see fruit in that tree amen and then you will be able to eat from those fruit be from that tree amen the word of god is a seed amen this bible he meant his is full of seeds amen amen the the promises of god amen every situation that you can possibly think of amen it's been it's been written somewhere in this bible it meant someone where someone went through all those things amen someone went through the same experience amen you just take that seed they meant watery baby you just take that seed plant it in your heart and let the word of god and the the you know those songs and water the seed every day day and night amen it's like david says it's like a tree planted by the water side amen that tree will never withered amen that tree will always produce fruit amen in every season amen that tree will always have fruit amen it won't be like the tree that jesus cursed even when he needed the fruit amen but but he couldn't find any fruit it meant by that tree when it's planted by the word amen when it is planted in the word of god amen who will always have fruit amen amen every time night and day amen winter or summer or spring or fall amen that that tree that tree will always have fruit amen you will always have fire that holy ghost will keep on burning amen it doesn't matter if amen what the situation is or what you know it doesn't matter the atmosphere or where you are amen that holy spirit will keep on burning amen because it's planted by this planet in the word of god amen abraham if you ask if you went to abraham and you asked abraham abraham how are you going to have the son amen i'm pretty sure abraham will tell you i don't know but i believe god said it so i'm not even going to ask questions i believe in the god and that settles it even you can go and ask gideon gideon how are you going to win this war amen how are you going to win this battle luka you have less soldiers than than the enemies eman gideon will tell you i don't know but god promised me the victory so i'm going with that promise i'm going with that word and i'm going with that faith and i know that i'll be victorious amen you can't go to moses you say moses how are you gonna get those children out of egypt amen only with the stick you don't even have an error or something stronger to fight this body you only have a stick and look yourself you're old and and you can't even speak correctly man you can't even say two words amen but moses will tell you they said i don't know even god when god told me when god recruited me he didn't ask me for all those in my resume amen he only told me to trust him only to have faith in him and he will use me so i gave him my faith in and i believe that god will use me amen you ask david david how are you going to face this goliath david will say i don't know but i know one thing i mean when i came across a lion it meant that i wasn't able to kill but by god's grace i killed that lion amen and i believe it's the same god who will help me kill this goliath and when you ask lazarus legends how are you going to get out of that tomb amen amen look you you you you starting running and everybody is crying and people even started forgetting about your name leslie will say i don't know but i know that there's a promise of resurrection i know that god amen is the resurrection amen amen your situation and someone can ask you about how are you gonna find the solution to this amen you don't have to know amen god amen you don't have to know the why you don't have to know the how amen but you will certainly be able to tell someone where that thing happened and and when that thing happened amen because it's an experience and when you tell him about being someone asked you about how were you how were you saved and why were you saved i'll tell you that i know i don't know why and how i will say save no i don't know i don't know why god saved me even but i certainly know when god saved me and and and where he saved me amen if you ask me why the only reason that i came i can come up with this because he loved me amen there is nothing that i did that made that that made my salvation amen correct or something even it's because of his love out of his love i don't know i don't have any other answers amen but i can't exactly tell you i can point you to the place where i will say oh where i received the holy spirit i can't point you to the time even where i was filled with the holy spirit amen these are the testimonies amen if you ask those people from the bible amen they will tell you exactly they will tell you these things amen they just had faith in god amen they just believed in the word imam that god gave them even they just believed in those promises amen and they were saved and they were you know and god gave them the victory amen the problem is that we are too afraid of our goliath amen the problem is that we are too afraid to move that mountain that is before us amen the problem is that we don't believe in god's word in a hundred percent we always have doubt amen we ask ourselves questions it uh uh is this going really to happen is this word or this problems really applies to me or maybe the bible was talking about someone different than me or someone else amen here the prophet says that and there he was standing there busting himself bragging it seems like the us is down you see don't have no blood shed let not have any bloodshed let someone let's let some men come and fight me and then if i win then you all just serve me if you win then we will serve you then we will serve you when the devil thinks he's got the ozzy on you see that's when he likes to make his brag but he met the wrong man he met the littlest man in the country amen little still children roddy looking fella he said do you mean to tell me that the army of the living god will stand there and let that uncircumcised philistine defy the army of the living god why he was shocked he was shocked at it why he was a believer the others were make believers see he was a genuine believer he said if you are afraid i'll go fight him see what a challenge for a little guy like that and so he was a believer and he done just exactly what he knew that god will do even if the devil has those odds on you i mean he likes to brag himself it may be maybe he will make the pain become you know uh but maybe that it will make it so painful that you you can't bear amen he will start bringing this thought in your mind that here this is that's it i have to start writing my you know my last you know uh testament and saying the goodbyes and all these things amen but god the prophet says the body takes a believer amen to stand there and tell him to stop and then it takes a believer amen to stand there and and take the challenge and go challenge him amen and if you have the word of god and if god is on your side him like the bible says the greater is he that is in me than he that is the world amen if you have that bible if you have that god inside of you in that there is no challenge that god cannot overcome amen there is no situation amen that god cannot overcome amen everything is possible even god will god will make you a victorious amen god will make you god will give you the victory amen as david would tell you amen all his brothers older brothers amen they were experienced in battles and man you have soul iman has been he's been fighting for almost since his entire life amen he was the tallest person in the country man he was the closest one to to go fight against goliath amen but he was there scared amen but david was a believer even david knew the god that he was serving him and david knew the god that he was praying to even david knew that we met every time he prays him and his prayers amen are already heard amen so he went up there to face that goliath and he come up there and he coming and he came back with the victory amen it's time amen the bible the prophet says again that faith is by hearing the word the word of promise if you don't have a promise then you venture out upon your own faith but if you can't take a promise of god that's god's promise to you the woman that touched his garment had no promise of death but her faith without a promise got her healing now if she could get her healing by her faith without the promise in what she was doing how much more are we to get our in our healing by faith in the promise that god is manifesting and vindicated before us and has brought it to us by his word come around and confirm his word amen if that woman without the promise in the bible amen could go there amen facing this facing this this challenge of being mocked in and and and the crowd had to go through that crowd amen but but she had that faith that if i only touched the hem of his garment i know that i'll be here amen without the promise she went out there and she touched the ham of god's jesus her garment and she was healed so what about if you have a promise in the if you have a promise amen you can take that promise and go to god and say that lord you give this promise i i didn't give this promise i didn't write it on the bible i mean by lord that you give this promise so i'm coming with this promise amen i'm coming it's like peter peter says that lord at your word lord i'm gonna cast the nest and now when i will have fishes amen amen because you said so lord that's why i'm going to go and that's what i'm going to do amen if you can go to god and say lord because you said this because the bible says this because the bible says that while you're by your scraps we've been healed amen because the bible says that at the cross you say that everything is fulfilled amen because the bible says that come unto me you are weery and tired i will give you rest amen because the bible says that if you're thirsty come drink for free from the the fountain of life amen because the bible says then amen if your scenes are red like scarlet amen if they're if they're read the crimson amen come to me i will make it wider than snow it may be lo because you said so lord that's why i'm coming to you lord with the same promise lord and i'm hoping and i believe that you will give me the same result amen and god will give you that result amen because he gave this word amen he gave his own word and before giving that word the prophet says that amen that word has to go through tests amen to make sure that every time that a child of god will come and apply the same word and use that same word amen the same word will still have those results i mean just let off the pressure and let jesus act amen because warring doesn't help amen roaring worrying doesn't change the situation amen the matter of fact it makes it makes it it makes it worse amen you will bring on you and men diseases heart disease and and all those things high blood pressure and and stuff like that it meant worrying doesn't help at all amen you can be complaining and worrying about the same thing days after days it meant you will have no situation amen but instead of you putting all those worries by you can have faith in god amen you can have faith amen god will set you free i mean you can have faith god god will give you the victory amen you can have faith amen you can believe in god and you will see the result amen just let off the pressure amen and let jesus act amen just let off that pressure and then in closing i'll read the prophet again it says that in in in providing his word approving his word uh paragraph 115 the prophet says that and as long as you are in the line of duty keeping god's word doing just what he told you to do marching by the orders of god you've got the right to say to that mountain be moved god keeps his word if you said to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart but believe that that would have been believed that that watch and belief that what you said will come to pass you can have that what you have said jesus said that and jesus said that in saint mark chapter 11 verse 22 he says that that that's the truth i know that's the truth it's god's word and that proves that it is the truth we're just afraid sometimes we get to a place where we're afraid he won't keep his we won't keep that word he will keep that word he said he will do it now we find when i we find this true because you proved it amen it's it's normal together to be afraid amen as a as a human being a man you have all these five senses amen in your body and and telling you otherwise but the prophet says that if you read this message a super sentence amen the prophet says that if you can only let that sixth sense amen lead your five senses amen you will have result in every prayers that you pray amen because these five sentences sometimes they act against the sixth amen you pray and you've been to church and and you you heard the word of god and and and god talking to you with your situation amen and you believe it even but this five those five senses i mean sometimes they prove that they tell you otherwise amen you've been prayed for you were you were sick and they did they pray for you but you go home and you become again sick and and and so painful amen just ignore the fire ignore those senses amen by let the sixth sense in action even let it take place amen let it take control amen and you will have the answer of all your prayers and you will have the answer of all your prayers amen because god said so amen if someone asks you why you believe it you say i don't know but i believe it because god said so because he said so that's why i'm believing it and i know that he will give me the answer jesus said that that is so or so and if you just take you should just take it in your heart and don't dig and don't dig it up every day to see how it's getting along just sink it in your heart and and settle it that's all walk right on god will take care of the rest he's obligated to his word do you know that everything that you see tonight is is god's word materialized do you know that your body is god's word materialized do you know that them beings there is god's word materialized do you know that the conquering is god's words god spoken word materialized you know this whole earth he's god's his god spoke and said let there be and he believed his own word and the earth come into existence if it didn't where did it come from well you say it come off the sun well who spoke the sun into existence see everything is god's word the world were framed by the word of god the bible said so god just spoke it and he believed his own word and that's what it was amen everything that you have this pulpit amen it's god's way materialized amen the clothes that you're wearing amen is god's word materialized amen because one day god spoke the word and he believed in his own word amen and then you have the result amen and today this is the spoken word of god amen this is the word that god spoke amen you have the message amen is the spoken word of god amen if you believe in it even you will see the result amen you take a promise and to say that god this is your word it's not my word and god will always believe in his word even god will never doubt this word not even one time amen he said in genesis chapter 1 amen let there be light amen and there was light amen let there be a animals and and stuff and and they were there amen he didn't god didn't care how long those things took he meant to come to a man to come to place and when he believed in his word amen and received the result amen we're touching the result in that we are even the weakness of it it meant ourselves we are the result of that spoken word amen if you can just take that word amen one of the promise just one of that promise in the bible even you don't have to remember the entire bible or all the quotes and man you just take one that applies to your life amen go to god with it and say lord this is what you said amen lord this is what the bible says amen and if you believe in it amen god will certainly give you whatever you need and then let's the song leader can come and the musician amen you just believe in the word of god amen believe in that promise amen your prayer he's heard amen vicarious man and his wife and they've been praying for a long time but god showed up amen the angel came with the good news not to fear amen because your prayer is hurt i mean certainly we have prayers that we've been asking god and praying to god for a long time now amen there is a good news that not to fear because your prayer is heard amen god heard your prayer amen and the answer is on the way amen you just start acting like you have the answer amen it's like abraham god when god told him that abraham you go you have a son remember the prophet said that the next day abraham went to the market and started buying socks and and and making radium and making a place for that sun amen buying toys and all of that amen but he had to wait for to even though he had to wait for 25 years and man he didn't care about that man he was keep on buying him and after 20 years he went to the market and he sees this beautiful toy man he went and he got it even when my son will come he will have to play with it amen he was preparing amen for that place i mean it's like mary she heard the word of god she went to the church and she heard how how a virgin would conceive and and how god will will cover her with the holy spirit amen she went back home and she stopped thinking about that word amen and then after that the angel showed up and tell her that she was the one amen you just take the word of god and you start thinking about that amen you stop thinking about that that will create an atmosphere man that will bring the angel down amen and then you will have your result amen amen daniel began with he started praying amen the angel came and told her daniel when you start when you open your mouth and man the end the answer was already on the way amen god because god hears us every time we pray amen it doesn't matter where it doesn't matter when it doesn't matter how even as long as you praying by faith him and every time you open your mouth amen god hears you amen even though you don't even have the word to explain exactly what you're feeling even god hears your heart amen you just come to him and say lord hear my hearing hear my heart lord lord i can't i have no words to explain it lord i have no words to to describe my situation but lord you know me lord lord see my heart lord and i believe and i tell you that god sees our heart and god knows exactly what we're going through amen and god will come to your rescue amen god bless you [Music] what a friend we have in jesus [Music]
