lot of times with me and my family we thank God for him being with us he'll be ministering in front on Friday 8:00 in Iowa City and Sunday here by God's grace God is so good to us in the blood of

good to us as we stand thank God for the song service appreciate our brother Frank stepping in for us sometimes things do happen you always need someone as a backup second Corinthians please as we stand at the reading of the word the last week we dealt with the creation of God in you and we're just kind of stemming from that it's kind of working with that still I thought I had ended that thought pretty much I have but you know when it comes to God no man no man or God salvation no man will be able to boast it's all God's doing yeah didn't come to God God came to us and every time I think about this book how fantastic it is and how wonderful this book is it's inexhaustible and this is just the book of redemption it's not talking about after it what's going to happen after redemption is over see we don't have a book for that oh my god but I can hardly wait a man to see what it's all about if redemption was this good can you imagine what its gonna be afterwards every time when I read that quote with the Prophet God says oh that man says do you really think that everybody's gonna live here on earth he says no God didn't say that we'll be here a man will be said but think about all of these worlds these moons and he's sick every man can tent cities if you all of us got tent cities and they'd be as big as Jerusalem who won't fit they gotta have other places amen but you know I love the Lord because Sciences are trying to figure out how wide and vastest thing is and you know and I know it's still going on there's still explosions happening they still stars moving right it will never stop until God says stop so we thank God for His grace and His mercy like I said I'm glad to have our brother - but I actually thought it was coming last week but I lost my phone so I lost all my data but this week is perfect we appreciate him second Corinthians first chapter how many of us believe that God is creating himself in us now I believe that with all my heart I don't know exactly how he's doing it but he's doing it amen 1st Corinthians 1:22 22 for all the promises of God in him are yay and in him a man unto the glory of God by us now he which establishes us with you in Christ and have anointed us in is God who have also sealed us and given us the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts I was talking with a young man the other day and he takes me he says he's a young brother in Christ he says what this is Abba Father means what I said is it's just our father when he when he when he was telling his disciples when they asked him how to pray and he says Abba Father he said our Father you're part of the family not just my father Oh Lord bless me according to the Father G of Jesus you know no we are all in the family amen my subject tonight just with this scripture along will be no broken promises God never breaks a promise let us bow father God we come before you and we thank you for your grace and your mercy we thank you for being so good to us and Lord without us without you Lord we are nothing but as we think about your vastness we can't even comprehend how great you are you are self above all Lord and there is no God like you and father God we thank you for being part of you O God and we thank you Lord for all of your creation everything that you have done for us we thank you bless this service here tonight and father would be careful to give you the praise the glory and the honor in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated pre adventure we may not be long it all depends on what God wants to do one of the things that I love about God is that he always keeps his appointment and he is oh there be not one person that will be able to say well God I came to church but you wasn't there not if the word is being preached not if there are two or three because Jesus says were two or three are gathered in my name I am there and the only time we come to church and at least in this church and don't see God is because you're not looking for him but I've never had a time in this fellowship where God didn't show up it all depends on what you're looking for if you keep your mind in such a simple place you will always see God our precious brother was and I would at a restaurant today and who basil and they gave you know those little cookies I don't using this with that stuff but we were just talking about God and what God is doing you know in his life and he was just talking and something just moved me to open up that cookie it was so perfect such an answer to and vindication to what God is doing in his life I read it I said here brother keep that because God see if you if you if you're not looking if you're not spiritual you'll miss it and God just came right on the scene it just and it brought an atmosphere it wasn't just opening up a cookie it literally brought in all an atmosphere and it's amazing how we who are chosen elected by God can see him I see God every day every day I see him now in in thoughts you know a lot of times we we always recognize the thoughts of the devil but we never praise God for his thoughts it is his thoughts who tells you don't listen to that reject that but we always tell all the devil is fighting why we need to change that to the place where we could say God is gaining victory every day because like I said the mind is where the battleground is and in order for us to achieve perfection we must subdue every enemy and you know as I said the enemy comes in three categories he comes by the lust of the flesh the lust of the eye and the pride of life and even John said if we overcome these things hmm when you overcome you get the reward now you saw what brothers what am I trying to say see when you really love God I said this last week when do you come to see that God is real see we pass from hope hope is something that you're hoping for you don't think you it's not certain it will happen faith is certainty see and I don't hope that I'm saying I know that I'm saying ha because the faith that I have has become sight and when we think about God who is our Creator and Isaiah says in Isaiah 54 not only these are our Creator but he's our husband and think about it just the thought that I believe that uh brother John someone spoke this to me the other day because I was dealing with husband and wives and he said think about it as a bride of Jesus Christ we love to say we're the Bride of Christ but we don't realize what Jesus or God did for his bride his bride Jesus laid down his life for his bride and every husband should have the same anointing about his bride right if that man would have that kind of anointing about his wife it would change everything that if God put him together now but God put together but for the norm you and I must understand him in the love of God that is shared abroad in our hearts he's supposed to reflect him even in that situation oh come on somebody see that's how they do to get caught we get choir they get quiet but it's true if we're gonna be like him we must be like him in every aspect I'm allowed to do that one scripture love your wife as Christ loved the church I'm still working on it and I'm being honest right because every time you think you got a handle on it the love of God unfolds itself even more is that right thank God he didn't say to love your wives as Abraham loved his wife let's put it like this as Abram not Abraham so you know because here this man loved himself more than he loved God and when we get married I don't know where I'm going where I'm going here because promises are made and when God marry you promises are made is that right and God has never broken a promise to his wife ever now we're human and we have flashing we have we're gonna have failures but when we fail in our promises we need to renew our problem if those promises can be renewed y'all understand what I'm saying now Jesus never he he will never God will not either even through the prophet Samuel Samuel told Saul he said don't do nothing I'll be back when I get back we can offer up to the Lord what needs to be offered but Saul couldn't wait somehow he just did not believe he couldn't take a grass samia's promise by faith that's what happens to us when we cannot we see the word we've heard the word we know the word and yet we have a problem waiting because God said they that wait upon the Lord they will renew their strength and the Bible says in your patience possess ye or so-and-so got in trouble because he did not wait he must have forgotten that samuel was the voice of God for that day and if God has spoken through Samuel he should have recognized that was God and not the man and he couldn't wait and he got out of position and he offered up a sacrifice and he was not a priest hallelujah see that's what people don't understand even when it comes to women preachers women preachers they were God call me God told me yes no doubt he did because you kept traveling him right you didn't want to accept truth so God will give you a lie he'll let is that right he told Balaam not to go down there and curse the children of Israel but Balaam was discharged to curse the children of Israel and God tried to prevent it from happening but he was so money stricken he had to go do it so God allow him to find a way to curse Israel because every time you see you got to understand this bride of Jesus Christ can never be cursed and we need to walk in the atmosphere a blessed not cursed blessed and when we walk in that atmosphere blessed amen it literally like the scripture says it literally builds a wall of fire about you no danger no harm nothing can touch you is that right that's what the prophet god said he says seeing the Satan can't get into you he said you gotta walk out to him for him to get victory over you who my god think about it Amen that these promises that God is made to us it will shall happen there's nothing above around the earth can ever stop a promise of God but the problem is we need to learn how to wait no promise can ever be broken God is so particular about his promises he told her Simon I'm coming to your house and did you know Jesus knew he was gonna be made fun of but he told Simon I'm coming and he goes to Simon's house Simon's a Pharisee right so he tells all of his buddies all of his buddies is all my we go have some fun now with that Nazarene we're gonna go and we're gonna make fun we're gonna have wheel and do what we're gonna do is that right so what did they do here when Jesus come they didn't wash his feet Simon didn't didn't give him a kiss like we do we come right at church we don't wash his feet we don't give him a kiss we sit there like a bump on the log hallelujah but when you come in the church you need to fall down somewhere in your spirit on your need however you the reverence of God should be in this place come amen kissing him listen if you come in here with praise and worship that's like kissing Jesus when you come in here with worship and brave guess what you the one that's rewarded search the scriptures every time his real worship God and praise God even in sacrifice they were the one that left with the blessing here was this woman him in an adulterous woman you know I like it that woman like the woman of America America's head even has so many husbands but anyway she comes and she's began to wash his feet and everybody is looking at her she's the spectacle of the service she's the one jumping she's the one shouting she's the one that's praising God hallelujah she's the one that's weeping she everybody have their own way of worship so I'm saying jumping running whatever you're where worship is you supposed to give that to him and so as he began to wash his feet she covered his body she's not in him right but this is the part when she got down to his dirty feet she began to take that hand and wash it he didn't make her no promise matter of fact she was the outcasts of Israel she's the scum of the earth but one thing she had that those Pharisees did not have and that was representation in their eyes he was a she was a prostitute but in his eyes she was the daughter of Zion hallelujah that's the same with us no matter what the world look at you and they can say whatever they want to say but you and I have representation in the eyes of God with sons and daughters of God being formed is shaped into his image he doesn't break his promises if he told you he's gonna give you the whole ego don't you fret he's gonna give you the whole ego he said if you repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ you will and she'll receive the Holy Ghost but listen the equation has to be right the word repentance you must repent now if you repent I give you the Holy Ghost he didn't save your baptized he said repent then baptize y'all hear me that's why you see well you said well repent from everything I was telling somebody the other day I said you know how we've labored so many times Lord I want the Holy Ghost and failing to see the labor that you laboring is not the right laboring is laboring to yield hmm laboring to surrender all of your thoughts all of your desires all of your will to God everything right because that's how it is in labor even when they teach to women the whole thing about producing a baby is you're learning how to yield don't fight it yield to it right and that is what God is telling us we need to learn how to yield to God in order to get from God what we won't because God will not marry a independent woman with her own thoughts and/or our own ideas he don't want that he wants someone who's gonna be submissive you like that God he keeps his promises all of his promises like yay hallelujah everything in him hallelujah you know it's like this when you ask anything of God the Bible said that's what Jesus said and believe that you shall receive it why are you asking those things of God that's in him and everything is in him any good design in it righteous desire everything that's in him is yay cuz he know you're gonna only ask according to his will is that Alright farming us and shaking us in other words let me say like this Jesus says I do nothing except the father show me he was so yielded to even when his best friend Lazarus needed him he wouldn't go hmm protectors supposin Lazarus was in in in the hospital and he's sending messages Jesus come see me now you have to read the little history behind that Lazarus and his sisters were orphans and and and they basically Lazarus was a place that Jesus could go like brother never was a place that brother Branham could go and rest and kick his legs up amen and so that's how it was amen with with Lazarus and Jesus so they were buddies and and you know it's amazing you know how you know uh uh they needed him and he didn't show up huh you know what it's the truth the prophet of God said she could have said well wait a minute we were there for you we cook for you we served you when you had your little ministers meeting I was there we were there see but no no no no she was him there was a part of him that no matter what she could never get angry with the word and if we were not here he said I got mad at God I'm not you did make you a her back up amen only a foolish man speaks like that huh is that right it's like a net or a tie and on the foe waving his fists at you and you're like you won't even feel the prick you know what I'm saying it doesn't make sense but a truth child of God as far as I understand in my revelation do not get there's no place in your heart to be angry with God but if you got the Spirit of God you become a lamb hallelujah no matter where he takes you where he leaves me I will follow right that's the way a real believer is I must go through the shadows of death but I fear no evil right because I Know Who I am and when you come to know who you are and know that everything you really asked for God is gonna give it to you now he's not gonna give you anything that's going to harm you is that right unless keep asking when he says no it's the truth you know it's not going your children we don't do this now but when we went in the world you know they want to go on and their mama said well go ahead along with your bad self cuz she know what you're gonna get she knows that she even tried to keep you out of trouble but you want to go at all you go ahead on right that's what happens a man God says okay so woman says I'm a preacher I'm a preacher you say but go ahead oh you're the one that's gonna be condemned at the end of the day is that right I believe the prophet of God spoke the Word of God and when he said I condemn all women preachers he was that a man a man can't do that only God can do that oh you love the Lord hey Colossians says one to the Father which have made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints in light who have delivered us from the power of darkness and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear son in whom we have redemption through his blood even the forgiveness of sin who is the image of the invisible God the firstborn of every creature I think I was talking I don't want to say too much because I don't know what brother Jasper's gonna wanna minister but you know you've heard me say this in the beginning was worried the Word was with God and the Word was God right and it talks about Jesus John was not the light but Jesus was the light of men and he was the first real man at the Adam everything the adder was a perversion we never saw the real thing again into Jesus so what is God doing now because we came into the image of the Fallen we must come into the image other new one so God as I said here before you cannot have a good and evil tree and go to heaven or make a rapture you understand me you as Jesus said you got to make the tree good or you got to make it evil you can't have a mixed tree in this hour you've got to make the tree good or you got to make the tree evil what is he talking about you can't make the tree evil or good unless the good is in you and who is the good God is good god is the only one that can make the tree good he's the only one that could change the nature of you and me you can't change it you can practice all you want but practicing holiness or righteousness will not produce holiness and righteousness you know what practicing holiness and righteousness does it produces filth the Bible says our righteousness is as filthy rags but the righteousness of God is what God is looking for hallelujah and realize by God's grace he meant that everything God promised us is yay to you so you never asked God for holiness and God don't give it well I didn't get it well you didn't have the faith to believe but if you have the same to believe that God can drop holiness into your heart you will become holy what is holiness that's God the real seal of God is holiness you understand me the Holy Ghost is holy be holy as your father which is in heaven is holy and you can't be holy let's the holy God comes down see what is it if Christ was had the preeminence God wants us to have the preeminence that right remember I read that scripture in Genesis last week how he told Adam have preeminence subdue subdue this everything around you is that right that's the only way that you and I would learn how to subdue and have preeminence it's not by force it's by Authority the authority of God's divine nature will cause every demon to bow in that nature is the name Jesus Christ hallelujah y'all understand me so when that nature is in you you are the living walking talking name of Jesus Christ that's what we are he said I named Oh heaven in earth I named him after me that's why he said whatsoever you do do it all in the name of Jesus see you and I amen this is who I'm afraid of the devil but in reality the devil is afraid of you he's scared of what you possess him that's why he fights your mind so much because he does he just don't want to see you have faith he doesn't want you to about you he doesn't want you to have these roaches in you Rob because he realized when it's all over you can never fall a comes short again hallelujah you are complete that's why you've got a girdle of days a girdle up the lungs of your mind wrapped up singing of hallelujah protected a man with the Word of God you a new creature in Christ not some patched over well I used to forget what you used to do that's what God commanded of Israel the Bible said had they remembered what they were in Egypt they would have returned you got forget what you used to be not God watch that sing away because if the devil can get you to remember he will cause you to return remember win right that's the trick of the devil to get you to think about the way you used to be and what you did and all the pledges are eating the leeks and the whatever they had out there garlic yeah great too many people in here like garlic y'all know what I'm saying any man you believe that he is the Alpha and the Omega oh I want you to not meditate on this think about what I just said the Bible says according to Revelation 1:8 I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and the ending said the Lord which is which was and which is to come the Almighty then Jesus come in the book of Revelation says for all of them who overcome right I will cause them to sit in my throne even as I've said in my father's store right and understand like I said when Adam and Eve was one Adam one body one spirit one soul when they were just one their names were Adam and Adam yes as just the single image had dominion hallelujah and now God amen is bringing us back to a singleness of oneness where we would have this Dominion as I said last week not over just earth but heaven and earth hallelujah see God took us a higher level higher Adam was ugly but this Adam is a quickening spirit hallelujah and God made us Lord of Heaven and Earth is that right mr. truth why would he tell Peter him and rebuked him when the straw was raging and they cowering down at the demons in the storm oh Jesus care about not that we perish get up Jesus get up he gets up undisturbed faith watering the boat sails broken gets up push his foot on the ham and says peace be still he didn't say no more Oh devil get out I see you he said peace be still Wow he knew that the devil recognized who he was I don't care what storm it is what animal is what person it is when the Holy Ghost help read me imminence in your life those Devils recognizes you every time it is what it is we're coming and the devil don't like it he sees us maturing he sees that we're now beginning to see his tactic clearer now than ever and now we know that the battle is here we must first lose it here before he can afflict us oh I got this oh I got that uh uh you know W trying to give me that you're liar you a liar you're a liar you're a liar you've given me the symptoms of it but you are liar and those are symptoms we there doesn't mean that I've got it ooh hey says revelation 3:18 says counsel I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire love that cuz God done called me gold he call you gold what do you say you're gonna be tried in the fire but I've already identified you deity hallelujah you go not silver your gold tried in the fire that thou made me rich and white raiment that thou made be cold and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve that thou may see a lot of time we can't see because our eyes are stuck together some of y'all may have never experienced but in my days when we were very poor we lived in a shotgun house I mean when the wind blow you know our our house would sound like an instrument [Music] [Laughter] blank as you try to cover up with but every night again you forget to keep your head under cover and then you wake up and your eyes matted together what a frightening experience my first time I had that experience it was frightening and I'm trying to open my eyes on you because it's so mad educate open them and you know those hairs I stuck together right you trying any hurt try to get them open and your mom get that grease and rub it in there and that don't feel too good either right but eventually they come open why what was the cold called by the cost what was the cause cold got in your eye that's why the church services are pumps to be on high on fire holiday that don't mean we gotta leave jumping and shouting and all that but it's supposed to be such a fire did everybody leave out of this place charged that's the kind of fire god it's like a batter you come in here to get that batter you get it out charged up again hallelujah mmm is that all right listen you listen Jesus y'all believe God he in the person of Jesus Christ he says listen he told the church the Angel of the Church of me write these things says he what even the Soviet the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God in other words he says not only did I beat him as a son but I have seen his faithfulness huh who got Jesus out of the ground God did I will not let his soul see corruption his soul seeing that's what people understand they can't put God together let me tell you some it is a revelation I can't explain all I know is a revelation and if he says his soul neither will I love my son or his soul to see correct his body to see corruption and then understand it took the Holy Spirit to get that soul up out of the ground you said that can't be right Jesus said I can't do nothing except the father show me and understand the father was Elohim Amen hallelujah that brother Ellen said amen Ellingham had a thought all of a sudden Amen Here Come a a pillar of fire he condescended to something that could be seen the pillar of fire wasn't him he was clothed by it he spoke out of it and then things began to materialize is that right odors flesh is not God but it clothed God that's what the Bible I want to be close upon I don't want to be found naked hallelujah and the only way that you cannot be found naked you got to have the same glory that the first Adam had and the second Adam because the fries Adam was naked and didn't know it he was innocent but that glory that's the kinda that light covered them hallelujah that's why I tell people this is not you know it's this one that I see you see and I want you to understand I don't know where the decimal you remember when we was down in Aiken and they had the cloud and that cloud came off that picture with those lambs and things yeah supernaturally he allowed it to be photographed you understand me so what I'm trying to say is what people call crazy they say is insane when Noor was insane no saw some didn't see nor was a prophet you know God gave no a vision nor saw rain and it wasn't not even in the Webster dictionary yet and his words were speaking in tongues it's gonna rain what you mean is gonna rain God gonna sit in water from heaven I know you crazy boy ain't no water down here like that he's gonna slap the whole world what to talk about oh he knows these three rivers that run through this place but you see God keeps his promise and it doesn't matter whether you believe it or not because you believe it don't believe it does not break God's promises the whole world to disbelieve what God's promised but God won't leave at least one he said because I've never left myself without a witness hallelujah there'll be one crazy person that's gonna believe God's Word and that's gonna benefit from it hallelujah because he know that God cannot break his word whatever promise you yeah I had God just talked to you you know just say I'm gonna do this for you know if God said I'm gonna save your wife you know he said he Oh same it doesn't matter what she see my she might she might take a dress up two more inches wear heels seven eight inches tall and that's what the devil to do when God makes you a promise he makes the person become look like they're getting worse you don't say oh they're getting worse never they don't get worse they get better hallelujah and when you see them carrying on amen then it looks like it's worse that means salvation is at the door hallelujah if you believe it you will receive it you gotta be the standard now you can't be cutting up and acting up and everything else and expect her to want what you got you got to be the standard right Amen you gotta be the one that system almost Jesus bear the cross alone and all the world go free no there's a cross for everyone and there's a cross me that's who you are take up your cross and follow me right so listen he says he's faithful and he's a true witness hallelujah remember Mary she want to hug him touch him she said no not right now I got to go up yonder is that right so Jesus are having a Sinden is that right I haven't ascended unto my father yet so he went to heaven put the blood on her own owner on the altar I don't know what kind of service they had then brother you know everything was tearing it up hey when that lamb came up there with that blood hardly knew Abraham and all of them right think about it think about it and we are always saying when the saints go marching in folks hallelujah I'm marching in and the only thing that's gonna keep me from jumping this is the we say smart I'm a March but if he doesn't specify it if he doesn't specify what I need to do oh no telling what I'm gonna do right in it so you and I must realized by God's grace he meant that God a man is dealing with us into a place where we can fully trust if Eve had only fully trusted God fully trusted means there is no room for doubt or persuasion there's opposite from what he's told you y'all hear what I'm saying see now you say oh he says listen in Revelation 21 5 through 7 he says and he that sat upon the throne said behold I make all things new you got to start with us first he must start with us because we're the ones that messed it up and once we get in our position then God can put everything else in right but the head of the creation must be in his position first as long as Adam was in position the creation stayed in that place when Adam fell the creation fail hallelujah and as we rise the creation is shouting hallelujah go to God I'm going back to what I used to be see the creation is groaning that's what he said the all of creation is groaning and waiting for the manifestation of who the sons of God that's why the devil is really battling us because he knows who you are even if you don't know he knows you not he is well every Son of God the devil tried to kill him every see every royal seed had a rough time in this world hmm Oh somebody helped me Jesus you love the Lord oh and he said unto me it is done I am Alpha and Omega the beginning to tell you that he said do you understand what God when he says it's done it means it's done hallelujah though we don't see it yet in his mind out of his mouth he said it's done I'm about to preach on that one it is done I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end I would give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the waters of life freely oh I got about freely and he then overcome shall inherit all fittings I think I'll just go and take a little trip to Venus hmm wherever I want to go everything is his is my he loved the Lord and that would be his God and he shall be my son who second Corinthians 5:17 said it therefore if any man be in Christ he is a new creature old things are passed away behold all ALL things ah become and understand that is a process but God wants everything he wants all of our past life ripped away from us it's true we've got to come to a place where we got to stop thinking about what we used to be hello you have you've heard this said before it's just like with with Rahab when God destroyed a Jericho he got rid of all of her witnesses not one was left who could say I remember when you used to and the ones that were saying wasn't gonna talk about it anyway cuz with out heard they wouldn't have been saying that would have had the imprint of rehab in Jericho was destroyed that right that's why God destroyed the whole of Egypt because you know those slaves weren't living right y'all thought they were living right if they were living right why in the wilderness they didn't live right all they did was moved from one place to another and like they said they came out of Egypt but Egypt never came out of there so a lot of the stuff they were doing Moses didn't know about it but now Moses and not in control God is and let me tell you something you know and I know if there's ever pressure in your life and you got something in your life that needs to be out and it's still in certain pressures are gonna come and you're gonna see that thing it's gonna stick his head up that's why you got to be sanctified that's why you got a yield to God and let God cleanse you up get all the darkness out of your life because Satan can see things he can hear voices you know don't you know darkness has a voice you said what do you mean because it's a demon and demons have demon have voices that right well what about the prophets meetings remember when a cancer or whatever was being cast out the one called to the other and they united in forces trying to stop the word from casting them out there were times it's oh you you got um two burger losses I just use that God just healed you oh you had it to God just heal you what was it he saw darkness leave going to God see that's what the word comes to do the world constant it everybody listen it's the truth you and I will we come to church I don't care what devil what demon amen that's got a hold of you if you submit to the word God would drive that demon out just by the preaching of the word no hand laying your hands that ain't necessary it is the word they were healed by the word they were delivered by the word they received the Holy Ghost by the word the preaching of the word like us at standing here don't you see him a lot there's an angel here by every preacher our angel stands there and ministers to him and he ministers to you ministering spirits flames of fire hallelujah I'm almost dying ain't God good to us we have come to take me wherever we work wherever we live the devil is gonna try to press you down like you ain't nobody oh you're a Christian I'm gonna press you down no no no no no you can't do that cuz really I'm your boss they don't you don't know it but I'm yours that think about it every time in Egypt and you and all all of us has been blessed with their blessing of Joseph Joseph is another type of Jesus so we've been blessed that wherever we go that our fee is we don't próxima and when the devil try to make it look like you're not proximate you give it all I don't know what's going on don't look like well you just do you do you full of doubt you full of unbelief you just created an atmosphere right you just create a wall but when you take that devil and you start speaking to him like you like David had to speak to Goliath oh you said this is what's going to happen but I'm telling you what's gonna happen but you can only do that when you pray it up you ain't God and it does not a carnal battle this is a spiritual battle we don't wrestle against flesh and blood but when you see that the spirit of the devil is trying to hold you down and pin you down you've got to realize he whom the Sun sets free is free indeed and where the Spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty I know I live in this world I live free and never under bondage well he promised it even if the weather kick against you how many times we prayed even now near in South Carolina it was hot and and he says Lord I got witness now I got witnesses that God stopped that storm I had a brother in the car with me and I started talking to that storm and it was raining hard and I cut my wipers off about it about no no more than a few seconds as I cut my wife was off the rain stopped I didn't say nothing cuz he saw me and heard me talk to the to the Lord somebody has been praying - I'm not taking all the glory at all I'm not taking any I'm just saying when you start talking to the law said Lord you know we want to have these services I said no but if you ain't bringing this rain to cool it off thank you Jesus from that first date all the way to the end God let it rain and even brought a cool breeze underneath that tent and as soon as the tent meeting was over the temperatures went up I'm not saying it wasn't still hot but it wasn't so hot that we couldn't bear it you know understand me God brought his own air conditioning but if you don't use your father that's your father and if you asking anything according to his will he said he will give it to you was I out of the word no because Joshua said son stand still yes understands fearly command the Sun stand still not for himself he wanted to win the battle and all the glory was going to go to God that's what the hosted the whole story about stop the storm not for me but that God may be glorified it's all empty Oh intent is right God will always answer I'm almost doing he gonna keep his promises I think it was the other day I said Lord you make these promises and you know I'm gonna believe them right you know I'm gonna believe him how can you not believe the promise of God when you you're part of him you can't help it you know and I will hold to every one of the promises that's why the Bob said great is the Lord and greatly to be praised and his greatness is unsearchable is that right and I'ma read this one quote and then we're gonna close I didn't plan to stay long but I wanted you to see that even how can I say it if we learn after after God if you if you have a promise in the word supposing the scriptures there and you you take that scripture and you're laid before the Lord say but lord I believe this this is what I meet and this is what I need this what a neat and this is a scripture that I'm gonna hold on to you need to hold on to it hmm and you know what you do like the arrow of deliverance you can't strike it three times you keep whacking it till it come back on the pass mmm yeah I got I got relatives now I'm still whacking I do cousins in Ajo I'm still whacking because I want to see them in this come to the truth of this way okay we are the bride of Jesus Christ if there is a mediator its Christ in us and in you and I are the bride we're the priest I make you kings and priests therefore we handle the blood hmm remember this I like the way he says it Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts but the book of Revelation shows how that the Antichrist spirit would come into the church and defile it making it lukewarm whoa that's the first thing he defiles it by making it lukewarm phorbol and powerless hmm like I said we got Catholics in the message we got Methodists in the message we got Baptists in the message we got pillar consoles in the message we got a little bit of everybody in the message and God don't dad God won't word he don't you don't bring your traditions and your whatever into the wood I think the way we used to do it and I'm not accustomed to you you know worshipping like that you still need to be born again hmm cuz when you born again they experienced their hand on the day of Pentecost supposed to show up in you somewhere I'm closing everybody want to have their own little section in the message right they hit though they hit the Pentecostals the worse cuz they don't want that scream and holler and I like it but we have come to know they're screaming and holiday near that ain't life that could be a form of a garland S or whatever but that's not life this message bring life then when like calm that will follow some of that but if a million never jog I jump a run and he's got Jesus that's enough right like you've heard me say it is never the blood plus huh it's never the blood plus it's only the blood and that blood we know is the life is that right it is the Holy Spirit let me finish this thing ah but the book of Revelation shows how that Antichrist spirit would come into the church and defile it making it look for former and powerless it exposes Satan revealing its works there's so many people who do not approve of the church age book they are so messed up I knew people who the Browns is who were there when the angel of the Lord came and wrote it on the wall and if the prophet of God amen listen look at Luke Luke would be an example of his riding-whip to me would be an example of what the church age book would been you know an intelligent man by lavell wrote the book but he basically copied what brother I'm saying yeah that's leave a book but that ain't what the Prophet said and if it was wrong he would have told us and people they don't want to have it you know that's what you know I cuz in there it's made plain you see the devil II I see the devil and the thing about it is when you understand the two spirits in the framework of this bride you know what to do then you understand you you understand that what you live is what will be resented of the others they can't stand you living it hmm they can't stand seeing the sacrifice in you ah they want this religion right form and powerless oh I can hardly stand it is that right Expo listen that's what he does and what people don't understand is this is where the joy of the Lord is our strength you let the devil take your joy you have no strength huh the joy of the Lord I'm not talking about just joy the joy of the Lord exposure saving reveals his works attempted destruction of God's people and the spreading of God's Word right down to the time he is cast into the lake of fire he fights that he cannot stand it he knows that if the people he had a true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for that she can do the greater works she will be an invincible army and if they get a true revelation of the two spirits within the framework of the Christian Church and by God's Spirit discern and withstand that's what I'm talking will span the Antichrist spirit that's what John told us right John John Scaggs how it is a system it was so clear how the system causes people to believe the message but they never get to Christ what's the difference if you draw on another church and you believed about the Baptist right or the Methodist right or whatever a Catholic right and you believe that and you you think because you believe that right you going to heaven you're lost like I said even now you know I tell the people that say well why well you know Oh girlfriend of mine you know she thought I was crazy when I first got saved I was I was preaching against the Catholic Church the system of it I didn't I didn't realize the system I was in was just just a second no doubt I'm preaching hard against your brother Antichrist and all that didn't know I was in an antichrist system to a man then I married some years ago she's all she said hard now I understand what you and vivvy was telling me about he says she said I'm Pentecostal now but she said i'ma tell you the truth I will always be Catholic and like mm you you might a shout it you may have spoke in tongues you may have ran out she's a preacher hallelujah you understand me all of that for what and she talks to me she said you still live that way see y'all in bondage you and Bonnie you still in bondage don't let me go to the heart Amen I'm almost done listen and she will be an invisible army if they get a true revelation the true spirit within the framework of the Christian Church and by God's Spirit discern and withstand the Antichrist spirit Satan will be powerless before her he will be as definitely draught today as when Christ was stood his every effort to gain power over him in the desert yes Satan hates revelation but we love it with the true revelation in our lives the gates of Hell cannot prevail against us but we will prevail over them so I'm saying this in closing you and I we have the greatest word ever out of all the ages this day is greater than the days of Noah greater than the days of Moses greater than the Israel days of Elijah right because this messenger that God sent us he was a covenant angel as well hallelujah he did things that Paul couldn't do even though they preached the same word but brother Branham I put it this way God he got that for town and he went like this now do you think it stopped with him no sir he passed it on he said the move is on the bride see see now God's focusing his eyes on you and me what we're gonna do with this we gonna believe we're winners and we're gonna believe that we're more than victorious hallelujah a wiggle didn't I listen I I can't change what the system I came out of but I didn't I I deny it if anybody asked me do you think I'm gonna be alright in that system no I wasn't alright I just didn't know it right but now we know the truth that we are united in Christ right there is not a system I'm not even a part of the message system because the devil has Foreman he's form a system I'm a part of the word and the word is free and don't you understand in order to see Jesus you got to go beyond the camp you can't well they do it like this over here and they do it like this over I don't care what they do how they do it you better know that you doing everything according to the word reveal you love the Lord see they say we ain't no organization but they show handle it like one everybody trying to tell what did sure different churches what to do and how they do it and they look at me like I'm an outcast you know an oddball I have my outcast I am I oddball and I don't want to be a part of no man system hello I don't I don't make no difference how they do it all over this place and this thing like I heard somebody when I was in Brazil you may stand a brother a brother a pastor and you know he lied in the pulpit first of all he said he was a deacon in brother twin brother maryland's for brother Branham at Branham Cavanaugh he didn't even come into the message a minutes in 1967 and then he told the people he said listen he said Berlin left Brenham Tabernacle as an example for the people to follow lie how can he lead the Branham Tabernacle when he says no matter what Bradham Tabernacle becomes don't you be a part of it that's a quote and how can he take that that's Antichrist because how can you make a church an example when the word and I called him on it but brother I don't remember I said well it's on tape it's on tape I said I really was disappointed cuz you lied in that pulpit and he said other things that I don't necessarily need to say it but my point is it's a prominent Minister and it was over 5,000 people over there in Brazil and he did all he says holders but he's a brother book to you you want to sing I said well if they won't be saying I don't care well let me go over here and see can I get three in minutes over here he there's a spirit now he want to persuade the pastor to let me sing and I don't care whether I I don't want to sing cuz the pastor want me to see isn't this is God thing you know you don't do that well he did but my thing is and you know I see so much that's not right even among the leaders and I'm gonna tell you something I'm not even asking you to put your trust in me because the Bible said put no trust in the arm of the flesh of man I'm a man yet I'm I'm a redeemed man you understand me and we do flaws and we have errors but as rows you stay with the word you gonna be alright you love the Lord let's just bow to where the prayer father I thank you for the being who you are I can trust this it's be tried and tried and tried in the fire again again and again Lord this word was able to keep every soul whose name was written in the Lamb's Book of Life throughout all ages it's been faithful and Satan has tried to destroy but now you've hidden that word in a place he can't touch and that is in the hearts of men father as we come before your Lord with such a simple message I pray father that you bless hallelujah continue to bless the people this is a special group of people Lord that you have gathered together here in Des Moines and I know that Lord we all love you Father we all desire or God to see perfection in us and father we realize Lord that we cannot perfect ourselves we depend upon you Jesus all of the promises that you have given unto us O God is yay-yay never name father I believe with all my heart that I can truly depend upon you you have been so faithful even in times when I was not you've been there for me you have kept all your appointments and time of Prayer in time of need you've never broken a promise and I know you never will father bless your people we are needed people Lord our desire to be just like you in your very image and your likeness help build us Lord into your own image to your glory we pray in Jesus Christ's name to God be the glory God be
