different ways to him things different things happen so that's why we're late but we deal calling Tober the toy will be here a little late we appreciate your waiting on us amen you love the Lord amen as we stand let us turn to st. John after getting out of so we got out of service early we had to dedicate her sister's house then we had to go pray for a brother in his sister and then when we got back John went with us John Oakland he had a wonderful time so we had to drop him back at the house amen to get his car so that's the report [Music] st. John one please I'm gonna have to preach this from the heart cuz my iPad went out on me never have I had it do that in the beginning I looked at like what no just a red line in the battery so by God's grace starting the first verse st. John first chapter in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was the light of men and the light shine it in darkness and the darkness comprehended it not st. John 10:30 I and my father I won then the Jews took up stones again to stone him and jesus answered then many good works have I showed you from My Father for which of those works do you stone me the Jews answered him saying for a good work we stone thee not but for blasphemy and because Dow because that thou being a man makest thyself God let us pray Heavenly Father we so thank you for your grace and your mercy we thank you for being so good to us Lord we need your guidance we need your anointing and father we just pray that you would speak to your people what you would have them to speak Lord we thank you right now have thine own way in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated I like to entitle this message this book called the Bible when we think about what the devil is done and what he's trying to do throughout the ages we realized that the devil has tried to always stamp this out he has tried to render his own thoughts he's tried to add to it and he's tried to take away from it but God even stated in his word the grass may withers but the flower and the flowers fade away but the word of the Lord shall stand this Bible that we read is not just any book it is God in expression by word now we realize a man that God is so vast in his intelligence in its presence in his being he he does things that you and I can't even comprehend my fact the Bible says who knows the mind of God is there anybody that can instruct him because you see God Himself is the only potentate he is the only rule up he's the only authority and there are no one there is no one a man that can compare or compete with him when we think about this book called the Bible the about the people the intellectuals they they they want to reason with it but in this Bible contains such great mysteries that you and I would have never known about had not God mercy decided to unfold them to us you and I realized by God's grace amen that God as I said last week will exist it he listed he didn't exist by breathing because if he had to breathe he could die because perhaps he would run out of air hallelujah and then if there was air before God that means the air was God so we know that before there ever was anything God created it you and I in our minds we can't even comprehend it but the Bible tells us so you know what I dollar beer we have In God We Trust and the more we trust him dollar bill the less it becomes the worth of it seemed to dwell know him to disappear but one thing we really know that in this book we can trust why because the Bible tells us that in the beginning was the word the Word was with God in the Word was God this word is God but think about it at the same token you could burn and destroy this book but you could never burn and destroy God because the Bible tells us that God is a spirit hallelujah and the Bible tells us that no man have seen God at all at any time except the Sun hallelujah and you said well what do you mean brother Brooks let me say it like this God is such a spirit he is son he is so vast in his being I often think how can this great God come down in such a humble way he's always tried to make us know him and in this book in his mind he found a way hallelujah and in this way he lived that I could make my creation know me is that right - God always wanted to be known hallelujah and he always wanted his word to have preeminence over all of his creation is that right because remember Adam was uh an amateur god he was the one that God placed on this earth in this place called Eden and the Bible tells us that God told Adam this is yours and I want you to subdue if there be anything that get out of order you put it back in order is he God knew that the serpent would be in the garden so God told him listen I want you to be in policeman of this place I want you to be the supreme authority over this place and if anything get out of order you put it back in line says listen I've given you the power to speak I'm giving you the power of intelligence I've given you the power the same power I have I've given it unto you you are God I am God of heaven and you are God of the earth what's in this book hallelujah in this book it tells where we came from and where we're going hallelujah and that's one of the things that never don't want us to know he don't want us to know our origin he doesn't want us to know where we're going after we leave here why because he carried the keys he was carried the keys hallelujah there was a time to devil could tell if I'm in just by way of death hallelujah but after Jesus came that's what's in the book every answer to the devil's questions is in this book hallelujah we realize he meant God greatest mystery wasn't Adam it may have been to the Angels they may have been shocked when God formed Adam but remember the prophet of God said Adam first was formed spiritual man and he was out of in the spirit leaving me animals like the Holy Ghost means us but God amen wanted to have fellowship with his creation he never wanted to be an invisible God he wanted to be visible and God knew that the only way that he could ever make the animals know Adam and she adamant asked Adam he had a big atom man hallelujah but your illumina he was first created in the image of God which was spirit hallelujah and then God came and formed Adam out of dusty earth hallelujah like I was telling everybody now I said you know people think that when God a man for man he just bent over and began to form him out of the dust but no show hallelujah when God saw a man a man he's dead Adams good man hallelujah amen and there God began to form the man hallelujah he was a tree and the tree don't go down he grows up hallelujah he said well what do you mean out of your tree tree now don't you know that in this book tells us that we are trees hallelujah now Israel is the fig tree right and you hear about Lebanon this tree in that tree hallelujah in the garden there was a tree of knowledge good and even we knew who know who that is that was Satan but man in the in the garden there was another tree and that tree colony was an odd other that tree of life hallelujah now if there was a tree of life there had to be another one somewhere hallelujah because remember before Eve seeing she was a tree of life because Adam was a tree of life Alleluia and because of sin she the woman became the tree of death you said what do you mean because by by the woman every man died hallelujah oh come on somebody but this is the part I'm saying like I said the other day that little tree that tree of life had to produce his own kind hallelujah so there had to be another tree and we had a prophet coming in our day because we never knew that there was a bride tree hallelujah we never knew that there was another another tree somewhere that had the coming to him us to state in order to produce her children hallelujah it's in the book that's what's in the book the mystery of the Gentiles the place they play of the part they play in this great drama hallelujah you see it is a drama you know Luda is God acting himself out hallelujah what do you do oh I said to myself amen in this book called the Bible shows us that in our bloodline which is 100% victorious hallelujah we are conquerors and Paul said we're more than conquerors in this book called the Bible that's why the devil don't want us to read this but David said I'm gonna meditate on him both day and night hallelujah because when we meditate on God you begin to collect God's talks hallelujah you begin you you move out of this ramp into another Ram hallelujah and you began to see and hear what God wants you to hear on earth hallelujah is that right that's why David I love it I tell you what David well think about David he understood who his God was hallelujah when David was in a pit he said Lord deliver me from this horrible pit when David had enemies he said Lord deliver me from my enemies amen David knew where to turn - the answer to your problems is in this book hallelujah you don't have to turn to a man you turned to the man that's higher than the man hallelujah and that's Christ Jesus it's in the milk hallelujah like I said they say In God We Trust in god we trust' hallelujah man all glory to God you say well brother Brooks I'm gonna tell you something I am a warrior I was born a warrior hallelujah what do you mean sometime and just take god to push you push you in a corner so that you can come out fighting hallelujah think about sham God sham God Amen was just a little fellow who was tired of the Philistines coming and just stealing stealing all of their crops and all that kind of stuff kind of like a Gideon you know remember the Bible says that sham God took an ox gore y'all know the odds glorious it's just a stick wood upon it into it hallelujah so when that onto that cow whatever one movie just punch him a little bit with him he's no mean it kind of moving move a little right Amen but this same God Amen took her ox gored y'all believe it do you really believe him in what we call a paradox that's what I am I am a paradox how God can take a sinner like me and make me a saint oh it's unexplainable but it's true hallelujah how God can take a ranch at heart like mine and aegeon in a moment i'm hallelujah scientist can't explain it but is true hallelujah that's what's in the book this book called the Bible it's the greatest book ever written hallelujah tells the greatest love stories ever written hallelujah oh come on y'all know it Romeo and Juliet somebody been reading their Bibles hallelujah I don't care what the fairytale is the foundation of all love stories is in this book hallelujah and the greatest love story ever is with E Adam Towey I don't want to live in Paradise without you hallelujah Donna Regan sings a song like that I don't want to live in Paradise without you hallelujah even though I've got all of this I got trees that beautiful birds I got everything and you messed up you sin but I don't want to live in Paradise without you hallelujah and you gotta realize him and that's exactly what Jesus did help him gave everything up because he didn't want to live alone he did not want to live in Paradise without his wife hallelujah and though Jesus was king of kings and Lord of lords he owned everything he still came insane on Calvary I don't want to live in paradise without you heaven will never be heaven if you're not there that's my god think about it a paradox how god that's what I'm saying we talk about paradox you think about how God said amen to turtle.turtle Moses Amen why are you crying I want you to speak to me hallelujah here it was a paradise see that's what I'm saying because once you see who you are you stop looking at the natural and look into the spiritual that's what meditating on God will do for you attention from this human element and bring you into heavenly places in Christ Jesus and once you see who you are everybody gets what you began to think differently hallelujah o Moses don't be calling down it's not time to be coddled it's time to cross over hallelujah all you've got to do is speak the word hallelujah hallelujah and guess what Moses and I has this we've got the same DNA hallelujah oh man so if Moses in his DNA is his makeup he had the power and the strength amen to connect with the Heavenly Father and bring forth the division through the Red Sea I often wonder I often wonder when Moses said stuck out his rods I don't know how to fish knew but they had to back it up whatever was crossing between that dividing line they had to spend steal holiday no doubt in my mind amen as those children of Israel was crossing the sea they probably seen little fishies in all kinds of stuff honey standing behind that wall amen it was a paradox hallelujah but God did it hallelujah and how did he do it through a man mallalieu yo that the prophet of God said it wasn't a mystery of God wasn't that God was making man was making himself from a God but it was God making himself a man hallelujah and in the beginning we know though that the word became flesh hallelujah little bee Indians that the flesh is becoming word the devil understand Amen that he knows this book is not only telling our past present but our future hallelujah Jesus caught the same yesterday today and forever his bride to see yesterday today and forever why because she and him they are one when Jesus said that hi my father won Amen it was true hallelujah he did everything the father told him to do come on salat it he said now listen I have done all these works and you still want to stone me they said no no no no we don't want to stone you because you can work we know you've done good things but now you just crossed the line boy you just told us that you and God was evil if you was ever asked that question what you gonna say hallelujah that's what God said you Christ said you have you are joint heirs with Christ hallelujah it ain't just just in his inheritance you know he got it's all he is that's what makes us joint heirs with Christ it's in the book but you said brother books how can I be in the book you in there hallelujah you're in there amen I don't care of you a whoremonger whatever you in there come on you said all brothers I'm not yes you are every time I hear the story about Rahab I said Lord that's me I'm in the book but look what happened to rehab oh yes sir at the end of the day when God finished Rahab was she what was she she was a queen a princess hallelujah y'all understand me oh you should old brother Bush what about what about the well you know whenever I hear that but that woman in the book she's in there I'm in there hallelujah so I can so you can understand when God said let there be light I was there oh you understand me before there was ever moon in the sky I was there hallelujah did not the Bible said wisdom was there hallelujah then who otherwise virgins hallelujah embodied wisdom honey oh my god you saw old brother what are you trying to tell me listen I may not remember I don't have to remember because the just shall live by his faith my faith declare I was there hallelujah and because I was there I am here because I am here I am there hallelujah the Bible said we're sitting in heavenly places in Christ Jesus not tomorrow right now you know brother Bram said we were sealed before the foundation of the world I had that in my nose he said before he said not only what we see him but we were sealed with the seal of promise feel a promise before I was born brother Travis I had a seal of promise that not only God was gonna save me but he was gonna bring me up when he he was the monstrous that's that's real that's real that's real it's real it's real hallelujah if you can just stand with your mouth and believe it it's real hallelujah no matter how little mistakes I make the bomb said blessed is the man that need they must be a people that God has on earth no matter how many problems things they make God will never charge you with sin the devil don't like it but he can't stop it the domino Lockette hallelujah but he can't stop it why because the Word of God has been sent out of the mouth of God cannot come back to him boy he's in the book hallelujah is in the book and I don't have to be afraid of dying hallelujah why cuz in the book he said if that same spirit being used that was also in Christ Jesus as it quicken his mortal body it's going to quicken yours hallelujah I don't have to worry about it glory to God hey man y'all remember the story when Elijah had been lights up people have been buried been dance for sold many long and they threw this dead body hey men down on the larger bones and all of a sudden a dead man came back to life hallelujah you see what I'm saying he said I'll never leave you nor will I forsake you hallelujah that means any part of you gotta be there hallelujah so when I go down and the Lord tarry and they close that coffin in my face don't you be a worry about me cuz I am NOT lonely hallelujah I'll never be lonely hallelujah why because he's with me and always will be it's in the book hallelujah you show oh am I gonna make the rapture you'd already made it hallelujah we to a lord I don't have that seal yet but God said you were sealed so before he could even make the rapture he's got to seal you first yes sir you said well what do you mean like God said to his disciples where is Peter where is he I know he's denied me three times but I gave Peter the key and nobody else can have him girl and God is in the book nobody can take my seat nobody can take my brains nobody can take your seat nobody can take your place hallelujah you say wait a minute brother how can that be all I know it's a little lady come up to Jesus and she says I want to say something Lord say can can can can my two sons one of them sit on the right hand and one sit on the left and you say it's not mine to give you see because that has already been predestined no she's already occupied hallelujah somebody else's names are on there I can't give you something that I that doesn't belong to you hallelujah is a book and In God We Trust you mean to tell me I can be healed I am healed ain't know if I can be I am healed because if I would tells me two thousand years ago he died for my shares and the Bible said with this strike I am here what about my liquidy i/o he's forgiven me of my iniquity and what is iniquity when you know to do good and you don't do it when you willfully sin I'm covered by the blood hallelujah is in the book I believe it and in God We Trust y'all hear me I have nothing else to do but trust this book the hidden things that ever just didn't well you know we would call Gentile dogs one time hallelujah but it was damn dogs that God loved hallelujah he took a gentile dog and made him a king in priests hey it's a paradox you can't explain it but it's true in it how hallelujah why how in the world Amen that you can be who you are because he was always in the book hallelujah Amen is that right oh we can't get away from it you cannot get away from it that's why brother Bama told me he said even if a man down drunkard he's got the Holy Ghost he say because God would never give it to you and didn't take it from you cuz that seal is a seal to the day of your Redemption hallelujah and it cannot be broken lower the God ain't God good to us hallelujah I said that because people think because you got the Holy Ghost you not tempted and you don't fall and you don't have shortcoming that's a lie from the devil hallelujah the only time we will work all completely perfect is when this body have changed from water to the immortality and then we'll see how fooling completed option hallelujah oh but it does not give you excuse to sin so we can send that shall we send that grace made about God forbid we do with the best we can by his power and by his life hallelujah some of us are weak some of us are strong some of us a feeble some of us got all kinds of conditions but only inside of the heart Oh God is in there hallelujah I love it I love it I love it who is in the book and in god we trust' [Applause] don't you realize Amen what God is doing and what God has done hallelujah we say what do you see them brother listen the Bible says that in whom are here all treasures of wisdom and let me just read it listen uh I'm gonna say it let me see where I want us to hide for I would that you know what great conflict I have for you I'm from them at Laodicea and for as many as have not sent seeing my face in the flesh you know every time I read that I think about our day now there was a layer to see you back then but I always think about our day that Paul is literally writing this this thing to us that their hearts might be comforted being knit together in love and unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding to the acknowledged of the mystery of God and of the Father and of Christ no other age could have seen that hallelujah it is this age that God has given us this understanding hallelujah he may have wrote it but we got the revelation of it certain things could not be understood but they had to believe it in how when when Isaiah said behold a virgin cooks care will conceive he didn't understand it but he believed it because he realized he was not the one that spoke it it was God speaking through him oh come on somebody if God said he's gonna have a perfect Church his church is perfect you see what brother books I'm perfect not over yourself no man is like there is no man that's holy uh-huh what holy man if the Pharisees the Bible said our righteousness must exceed the righteous of the Pharisees how are we gonna make it there was nobody who practice and live like those people did hallelujah they jot every that they got every tired and crossed every T come on somebody they were so sanctified amen they stole everything that looked dirty remember the man that was from Jericho that the Samaritan when they saw him they walked all the way on the other side of the street hallelujah but the brother said our righteousness must succeed that when I was in the Apostolic Church because that's the way we will we worked our salvation we had to do this and do that and do this and do that and I didn't understand them like Lord ain't no way I could've helped do them Pharisee but then when I realize what righteousness he was talking about earlier the Bible said he became sick that I might become the righteousness of God ha ha that's the only way we could ever supersede him is that we put all the righteousness of God with you so Holy Ghost hallelujah it's in the ball with the devil trying to make you give up don't give up I know sometimes we want to quit you know like Samson Samson the lusts of the flesh never they had him so hard and so bad a man he just went on crazy because of Delilah at the end of the day like Delilah had an appetizer hallelujah that was a wake-up call now he sees his condition but sometimes God has allowed things to happen to you to see your control you can see your condition and then when you do see your condition you don't get mad at God you described Oh Lord once more that's what you got have mercy on me Lord once more is in the book did God come on the scene when he cried out if you cry out to God God or come on the scene whoa but you can't be shame about it you got to cry out that's why I love this Bible because when the unknown and fell all those people in the New and Old Testament went blind Bartimaeus heard that Jesus was coming by the Holy Ghost had not even put being poured out yet huh is that right you know those few say shut up or blind whatever you know I would usually do if the food word but not but you know that's what they say huh and he didn't care he cried them all the old me and do you think that Jesus heard him in all that noise he didn't hear that a man but up there the God of heaven heard him and all of a sudden he was another man who stopped the Sun [Laughter] Joshua stopped the Sun and so did blind Bartimaeus hallelujah but by the man stop the soe in hallelujah oh my and he turned around and said what would you have them me Oh see that's what I'm saying when you get into that place you don't care who you are I don't owe the Lord so many time when you ready to refill me I don't care if it's in a grocery store they don't think I'm crazy anyhow do whatever you need to do but just don't let my pride get in the way hallelujah if I feel you're nodding and you want me to do so I don't care what just don't let my pride get away hallelujah that's what happened I think was that my screw that time there we didn't know nothing about homelessness but they said that girl had a fit in the hall it wasn't even have no fear she got the holy God filled with the Holy Ghost while she was going down the hallway taking on the Lord and the rumor went out she had a fear later when I found out what happened hallelujah I don't care where he wants to do it do it at all y'all know why I'm crying out like this because we got to trust this we got to trust a word with every every every part of our hearts because you see this earthquake I mean these things happening in in Hawaii and everybody's looking back like it's just just another thing but don't you know where her why he is Hawaii is out there with the Ring of Fire and now 383 one volcano has turned into three outlets and it's spilling out lava not a little bit either I understand me and if there's this lava coming what am I trying to say there's got to be pressure somewhere pressure somewhere because this pressure is causing this volcano to let the pressure off hallelujah and look at Washington state is already locked and rarely people so we got listen we got this thing sickness the stage being set for California to fall we've got these countries now uniting a man and you got Israel who celebrating the 70th year ooh and then you got you got this this Prince I said lord I don't seen this kind of wind before I said lover look at this thing I said he opposes you told Moses go marry Zipporah right I said then Solomon wears running chasing after warmer somebody God showed us something getting ready to happen even happening in the doctor's gotta happen in the spiritual and nobody can't understand why our prince royal blood would marry an American Oh somebody help me something's going on people and you and I better be aware these natural things that's what brother Brown said everything that types of spiritual something's going on and you better be ready because we getting ready to take off here in just a little bit I believe it with all my heart oh yeah mm-hmm that's so sweet to me she he hid those treasures he hid those things amen and we didn't even see them but they were in the book hallelujah let me tell you something just like I said this morning I said let me tell you another said this before these scientists think they got something they run up to the pyramid said who made it we know who made it they said how it was made we know how it was made and don't you know that pyramid actually types out Christ the Illuminati done did crazy things to that just like they've done it to her to the rainbow but there's a truth behind it all hallelujah and that pyramid stood there even when the world was being tossed to and fro by the flood hallelujah that pyramid stood right there throw her to God hallelujah it show that the broad may have to go through trials and tribulation but she'll hold her place she'll hold her ground hallelujah hallelujah is that right and they said just it then that Great Pyramids there's seven steps to the King's Chamber Oh seven steps to the king and makes it looking peaceful look where we are hallelujah we're right you know brother I said we're already married hallelujah oh my god you said oh brother what are you trying to say what I'm trying to say is just a moment's time from our honeymoon we've been a griffon to take a honeymoon folks hallelujah come on somebody why because this is the end of it all this is what amazes me they go measuring all these things and trying to figure out you can't figure out God the answers in the book huh amen you know for years they denied noah's ark until they found it on mount Eric you know no one drug that thing up there [Laughter] see but you see they won't acknowledge God said so dinelli finding pyramids all under the ocean and everything else oh I got the answer it's in the book these people were ingenious people hallelujah the world as we know it is not the way it used to be the world Amen used to be one mass one land now the scientists call it continental drift but the Bible says in the day when the continents divided it's in the book hallelujah who divided them God did hallelujah are used to understand I didn't have no boats and all of this stuff how do these people get here and how these people because when it does the contantly divided the people are stuck like child they couldn't do nothing but stay where they were Miriah what was God doing forming Nations he was forming nations hallelujah because in his mind he knew that he was gonna choose a nation that nation was going to be Israel and he had to have enemies hallelujah somebody said well America is not in the book yes she is revelation the third thing she was always there hallelujah chuckles a prophet to tell us who she was how it became why you see the way she is hallelujah but as long as we bless Israel no matter how bad we are God will have mercy on us but the very day we turned from her the bomb will drop is that right because every time we do evil to Israel God comes right back and do the same to us we made Israel give up certain lands with their burial sites and everything else and God calls that hurricane to come in here what was hard Katrina or whatever it was whatever was the name of us and they'll tell you in Louisiana they had coffins floating down the river more than one could we up made them uproot them they're dead and God came in uprooted ours feel like shouting it's in the book you tired of that devil huh you and I must understand that devil gotta end he knows it but we don't have an ear is in the book the devil will be destroyed one of these old days that same old guy a man like me in a brother say are you the one I'll be right there with you brother Marshall are you the one you the one they called me all that trouble can y'all matter that I don't know who that one angel is that throws them too late maybe it's Jesus I don't know who it is I don't know who it is but can you imagine the great honor that is for that angel to take the devil and throw him in the lake of fire you think it's gonna be weeping and wailing it might be weeping and wailing but it'll be for chalky for joy you said but it ain't in the book yes it is even in the book of Esther Esther it's a powerful book Esther Esther Esther exactly tells us where we are today because if you read after you find out that God is not mentioned in that book it's a age of progress for me we're men a glorifying themselves hallelujah now Israel isn't it which is tied to the bride but she's got no play really other than she's got the Queen you know think about this now it's a paradox that God would take this little woman uh I can adesso it mean that God would take adesso and not only change her from that name of bring her back up to what we call Esther which is a style y'all heard that the other night but look at this God is showing you that there's a transformation that will take place and a change of position from a proper to a queen hallelujah shows us that and not only that it shows us our part that we will be the cause of Satan's defeat because Haman represented Satan and all of Satan's children hallelujah was destroyed and who did it Esther Esther say listen King we don't got rid of Haman but it ain't done yet as long as we leave it leave his offspring living hallelujah we gonna always have trouble I think we need to kill them too hallelujah and the Bible said all none of the evildoer do is with prosper the seed of the evildoer will be destroyed and we'll have our hand in it but because we judge Haman we judge the devil did Esther judge the devil hallelujah and winning told God who was the king this guy ain't no friend he's he's he's conniving behind your back he's plotting he's doing this he's doing that he just plan it out because he want to destroy the raw your seed that's what it's all about is in the book oh god we trust' hallelujah God said he's gonna have a church without spot wrinkle or blemish I was wondering I says now I understand a spot and a wrinkle is when you're sitting down on God see when you sit down you get wrinkles you're not doing that you just sit but this church ain't got gonna be like that she won't just be sitting down relaxing and resting she's about her father's business y'all hear me no spot wrinkle or blemish hallelujah closed out on this Scripture Hebrews 10:14 for by one offering he had perfected forever them that are sanctified it's a paradox so it's really hard to get this mind to really digest that I'm not asking you this I'm saying take it a minute that's right all you have to say amen so be it law letter B according to thy word hallelujah that's what we're doing he's your brother that's the scripture the Lord saved me when he saved me he took me to Psalms 32 amen blessed is the man whom God will not impute sin you know cuz many times now I'm telling you I know he's proven himself God has never dealt with me according to my iniquity ever ever and I always forget he told me that and then I heard brother brother said that's the bride I say whoo but there's a brother in in South America he gets so excited he say is that good you got to give a sorry sound oh my and when you think about how good God is to us all we got to do is patiently wait patience is a virtue of God and that's what he tries to teach his children to wait listen people if you don't wait what you're gonna turn to even if you go back you still gotta wait if you decide I'm not serving God no more what are you doing wasting time because you can't do it God has to do it but those who wait upon the Lord it's in the book if you wait upon the Lord the Bible said he will renew your strength so it's good to wait hallelujah your arm may be broken but i'ma wait on the dark man your leg may be broken but i'ma wait on the doctor you understand me ain't gonna try to fix it myself because I don't know how to I am gonna wait to the physician get here to do it so if my heart is broken I'm gonna wait because promised to give me a new high if my mind is corrupt if my mind has no peace the Bible said I will grant you perfect peace those whose mind is stayed on me so when I have in trouble in my mind it's messing with me I'm gonna turn to one scripture there's many I could turn to but there is one scripture that always stands out in my mind Psalms 23 let us read it over there God Dave is telling you something here beautiful people alien he's telling you something the Lord is my shepherd let's see that all together the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want he maketh me to lie down in green pastures he leadeth me beside the still waters he restoreth my soul he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me now prepares the table before me in the presence of my enemy now I've known it's my head with oil my cup runneth over surely goodness and mercy shall all the days of my life and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever what comforts me huh what comforts me thy rod and thy staff this is where we supposed to gain our conference when we go any other place to be comforted you will not receive the conference you're looking for this is the encouragement this is the conference you must find scripture to comfort you it's in there he wrote it especially for you every moment of distress or whatever you go through you say God just showed me where to turn give me a word to encourage me I guarantee you gotta do just that and when you read it don't get shocked like oh he's talking to me yeah he's talking to you know In God We Trust in closing brother Branham says you ought to read a chapter every morning every night that's your relationship and he said when you read it he said you read it like God is talking to you now don't go somewhere amen in the Bible where they got all this genealogy and say love because that's history is history you need something that's going to work with you today hallelujah you know that was one of the reason why I didn't read the Bible for a long time because somehow the devil had me turn with all that gee lividity didn't understand that but every now and again uh and ah yeah didn't know didn't know we could just oh I can't understand I say that I can't understand cuz I was reading Amen 12th grade level and I hear I was not even kindergarten right so you look at these things and you said lord give me a word you do you really believe that he's your father do you believe that God is your headship with this book this word is your head chef so you go there and just Lord teach me I gave it to you if you follow the formula a chapter in the morning in our chapter at night and pray while you're doing it I guarantee you your love for the word will increase and your love for God will increase and you'll begin to see things change in your life you got to feed yourself and sometimes the devil discourage us because we try to read a whole book no read one chapter I don't care if it's like this in Psalms that's all you got to read read it and meditate on it and say Lord speak to me he'll do it here do it and maybe Amen maybe when you while you're doing it you know you don't feel nothing you don't have to but eventually it's like anything right you know you take a baby when you when you work with a baby you're taking that baby off of that off of that formula or that milk and giving the table food on you know what they got in the jar now that baby normally spit more out of the mouth than you didn't want you you put a spoonful in and they put they they spit about two or three two-thirds of the schools were back out now what you do you take that thing and rip around loves me get it get it get it and you keep pushing it in there till they learn how to grab the whole spoon that's how God is right he'll give you a scripture and sometimes you spit it more out than the end but that little bit still worked but he don't want you to just have a little bit here keep I love it I still love taking that spoon around it just looked like others like that amen feeding babies I like that but you know it's amazing by God's grace that's how he works he's patience with us and He loves us but he wants you to trust this and make this become like I was telling somebody tonight today and the closing I said yeah they tried to destroy this they don't hybrid it they done gave it every kind of version there is but the bride of Jesus Christ is the original version of the word God wrote his own word in our flesh on tables of flesh he said I put my laws in their heart whoo that's dad I know I have kept you I tried not call people's names out when people help me only because two things I don't want in experience it's all about God and not about individuals you love the Lord and like I try to tell my friends when me and brother Craig's talking I said well it's mine now or vice versa he said well it's mine now I said that's what the Bible said we supposed to do yeah our conversation is supposed to be around the word and when we give each other thoughts about what God has done it's no longer yours you just gave it to me God talking to God amen boom I feel good this work this evening Lord I so thank you for your grace I thank you for your mercy and everything you are doing for us you've been better to us than we've been to ourselves Lord has been a wonderful day in spite of all the distractions it's been a wonderful day thank you for everything thank you for my loved ones thank you for my trials my tribulations thank you for everything because I know father you are God and I trust you you will lead me in the path of righteousness not for my sake but for that name sake and I thank you Father I thank you for your leadership continue to lead us upward father never let us drift backwards or stand still but let us follow you even as I now walk with you help us that we will walk with you granted father in Jesus Christ's name we pray a mighty God oh what a mighty God [Music] I will I will I will be Creole in sports with [Music] [Music] it's holy and it's keeping me alive is he keeping me alive it's that Holy Ghost and Bob and it's keeping me alive oh Jesus is keeping me alive man god bless you Saint amen
