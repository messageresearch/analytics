[31:07] [Music]
[31:09] He preached for us some years ago but
[31:11] you know
[31:14] I remember his face immediately as I
[31:16] when I saw him
[31:19] amen but the name I couldn't put the
[31:21] name together
[31:23] we in the short period of time
[31:26] we Fellowship we've been having a good
[31:29] time

[31:52] you just don't know but he's got such a
[31:54] a nice spirit a good character
[32:01] I can hardly wait to hear him so I'm not
[32:04] going to stay up here alone
[32:09] let go and let God have his way
[32:14] we're glad to see our sister here

[32:22] praise God we know it to Memphis but
[32:25] we're glad to see it
[32:26] [Music]
[32:28] man he has a real work of God working
[32:31] for the Jews he was just sharing with me
[32:37] flabbergasted I was surprised
[32:41] such a humble man good time
[32:49] brother have you away
[32:51] in French
[33:00] yeah I think he does he he does well
[33:05] amen we appreciate you God bless you
[33:08] amen thank you
[33:13] thank you amen
[33:21] stand where you want my pastor God bless
[33:24] you
[33:25] yeah
[33:28] we're happy to see you tonight
[33:32] share the word
[33:36] I think Isaiah Brooks pastors and um
[33:41] a humble man a humble a man of God
[33:45] and we've been here years ago
[33:52] had me here without even know me when
[33:54] when I first came here
[33:57] when I came here first time I even
[34:00] stayed over
[34:02] the great man of God he had me in his
[34:05] house
[34:06] and he let me preach when I came here
[34:09] I think two or three
[34:12] and also in Iowa City on the other side
[34:16] so God will give us another opportunity
[34:19] to come here again
[34:23] now we'll open our Bibles the
[34:26] foreign
[34:42] [Music]
[34:45] says for this cause I bow my knees unto
[34:48] the father
[34:54] For Whom the whole family in Heaven and
[34:56] Earth is named
[35:02] that he would Grant you according to the
[35:04] riches of his glory
[35:08] fortified
[35:14] to be strengthened with Mighty by his
[35:17] Spirit now you see spirits is an
[35:19] uppercase here
[35:23] that means his spirits in the inner man
[35:30] that Christ May dwell in your hearts
[35:35] and he has to live in Your Heart by
[35:38] faith
[35:43] that he being rooted and grounded in law
[35:56] they may be able to comprehend with All
[35:59] Saints what is the bread the bread the
[36:01] bread the length the depth and height
[36:05] and to know the love of Christ
[36:15] and to know the love of Christ which
[36:17] passes knowledge that he may be filled
[36:20] with all fullness of God
[36:23] will pass to the corners of the love of
[36:26] God that passes all knowledge
[36:33] he's asking that we will be strengthened
[36:38] the problem now you see when a person
[36:41] has issues
[36:42] in his uh in in inside of him
[36:48] and this body falls let God is
[36:55] this body has guessed the influence from
[36:58] the internet
[37:01] when the inner man is
[37:05] weaker then the inner man also falls
[37:11] so for the uh
[37:14] so that the inferior man exists
[37:18] for the experiment to resist if
[37:30] and the only thing that can keep the man
[37:33] the exterior man alive
[37:36] is God in the man
[37:42] because God has a knowledge that passes
[37:45] all philosophies and science
[37:50] I want you all to pay attention to these
[37:53] scriptures
[37:56] because I'm going to talk about four
[37:58] measures of the love of God
[38:01] God has a love that has four measures
[38:07] it's a love that passes all
[38:09] understanding
[38:11] we're going to look at it together
[38:15] my name is brother William
[38:18] uh they
[38:22] em pastor and I had a pastor and Pastor
[38:26] that was Pastor Diego
[38:28] um
[38:30] and I I came from the church called
[38:34] shakina
[38:35] I was young all my life
[38:38] and I live the words
[38:44] they were still young
[38:46] it all came from the church called
[38:49] shakina foreign
[38:59] but when I was young I chose Pastor
[39:01] dyokai as my parents
[39:03] because I didn't want confused I don't
[39:05] like confusion
[39:08] so we're going to talk about the love of
[39:10] God
[39:12] because we always have to know where we
[39:14] come from
[39:16] we can't just come from anywhere like
[39:18] that so you have to know where you come
[39:21] from
[39:23] now we are
[39:27] we all have the president that Paul is
[39:28] telling us a very important thing
[39:31] wrote this chapter
[39:34] and I agree brother Eugene and his wife
[39:51] we're going to look at those foreign
[41:15] then water will be square
[41:18] outside
[41:43] [Music]
[41:47] even Paul says
[41:49] foreign
[42:14] [Music]
[42:36] [Music]
[42:36] [Applause]
[43:16] and what is perfect
[43:33] but the question is do you have the
[43:35] foreign
[43:54] [Applause]
[43:59] [Applause]
[44:16] [Applause]
[44:24] they were born on the same woman
[44:40] according to his will and
[45:15] [Applause]
[45:21] [Applause]
[45:40] then he says I accept whatever
[45:56] God for the first time
[45:59] God
[46:20] he resisted
[46:22] he rejected
[46:24] the will of God
[46:29] who is the Son of God
[46:32] and who was the son of the devil
[46:35] the son of a devil
[46:38] is one who disobeyed disobeys the word
[46:41] of God
[46:42] that's the one who resists the words
[46:46] and it's the one who's rebellious
[46:49] against the world
[46:50] [Applause]
[47:13] but they were serpents prayer
[47:47] give me jokes
[47:53] Satan's prayer was God give me joke
[47:58] and God says amen
[48:02] but I'm gonna give you a limit
[48:06] don't touch it
[48:09] don't touch his soul
[48:13] [Applause]
[48:26] now you see
[48:34] when God went to deliver the the
[48:39] maniac
[48:42] he told him Lord
[48:44] the the maniac told him
[48:47] those demons
[48:50] allow us to get into those into those
[48:53] those
[48:54] three the porks that belong to other
[48:57] people
[48:59] somebody else's business
[49:01] and God said amen is God sent Amen to
[49:05] that prayer
[49:07] and the demons
[49:10] and they got into those ports
[49:14] and Jesus they put Jesus out
[49:19] so the devil also prays
[49:22] [Music]
[49:24] one day he came before dying before
[49:28] Jesus died he said Lord
[49:31] give me Peter
[49:34] he talks too much to the devil
[49:37] the devil asked him
[49:41] I'm going to I'm I'm going to break him
[49:46] I'm gonna break him
[49:48] I don't know then then then the God said
[49:51] no now I'm not gonna give you Peter yeah
[49:53] man there are some things God says amen
[49:58] and there are some things some things
[49:59] God says no
[50:00] [Applause]
[50:02] I didn't know then he said no I'm not
[50:04] giving you Peter
[50:07] Peter is still a little child child
[50:13] because Peter was even saying everywhere
[50:16] you're gonna go I'm gonna go with you
[50:18] Jesus
[50:24] you
[50:28] can go you can go to me and until then
[50:31] we're not in there
[50:34] [Applause]
[50:36] and as they were going to death Jesus
[50:41] before getting into death
[50:44] he denied Jesus
[50:48] and he said I don't even know this
[50:51] person
[50:52] I've never seen this person
[50:56] lies
[51:03] as lies of Congolese
[51:06] I didn't see when they come here
[51:10] they say they all they always say oh
[51:12] they're following me over there they're
[51:14] telling lies they're pancakes
[51:21] pursuing me somewhere
[51:26] but that's Peter
[51:28] like
[51:29] this but when you receive the Holy Ghost
[51:31] s
[51:33] there's some things you can't do
[51:37] it
[51:39] that's why you always have to examine
[51:42] the will of God
[51:44] femininity brother
[51:50] the chief of all the demons is unbelief
[52:01] there are three things that happened
[52:03] with Eve
[52:05] for her to be an
[52:08] unbelievertis the deity came out of her
[52:15] her soul became dark
[52:18] lot the third thing
[52:22] demons came to dwell in her
[52:28] because she rejected God
[52:32] now tonight
[52:35] I'm gonna show you four measures
[52:42] it took her out of the plan of God
[52:47] but because God was a redeemer
[52:50] he came down
[52:53] in his perfect law
[52:57] to take Eve and forgive her
[53:02] to take Adam and forgive him
[53:08] we're gonna start with the first measure
[53:51] whosoever what
[53:56] what the Lord
[53:58] should not perish
[54:01] but have even Everlasting
[54:07] is for whosoever
[54:12] that is
[54:21] a large hands
[54:24] he has large arms to receive
[54:35] let's take an example of the thief on
[54:38] the cross
[54:41] he was forsaken by Society
[54:46] he was crucified by Society
[54:50] but when Jesus came only
[54:53] instead of looking at a criminal
[54:56] equipment
[54:59] the criminal is whosoever believes
[55:05] and he says Lord
[55:08] you did not sin
[55:10] you're not you're not he says I am
[55:14] guilty
[55:15] but he said Remember Me Lord and your
[55:19] kingdom and Jesus told us tonight
[55:25] right now
[55:27] you're gonna get up with me
[55:33] a thief who was never even baptized
[55:39] because this again in the Kingdom you
[55:41] have to be baptized
[55:44] but you look at the width of the love of
[55:46] God here
[55:48] a criminal who was not even baptized
[55:52] and put him into the kingdom
[55:56] he was able to forgive the criminal
[55:59] then he can also forgive you
[56:02] [Applause]
[56:14] is found in Jeremiah 31 verse 3.
[56:19] the Bible says
[56:23] I have loved thee with an everlasting
[56:26] love
[56:29] therefore with love and kindness of
[56:32] hydraulics
[56:34] I love you with an everlasting love
[56:39] the length of the love of God
[56:42] is an everlasting law
[56:46] God as an eternal ever
[56:48] left for you
[56:50] you know a man can forgive you
[56:53] and tomorrow he may not forgive you
[56:56] God forgives
[56:59] he forgives you forever
[57:03] he loves you forever
[57:06] he doesn't love you today and then
[57:09] tomorrow he doesn't love you anymore
[57:10] when he loves you
[57:12] he loves you forever
[57:16] no matter what people will do
[57:20] no matter what people will say
[57:22] when God loves you damn he loves you
[57:26] because
[57:34] he he makes you long you live longer
[57:37] he gives you his name he gives you his
[57:41] love and kindness
[57:43] that's why every time
[57:57] that has a lens
[58:03] that passes
[58:05] the brotherly law it passes
[58:09] it passes the flesh love
[58:14] it passes the love between a man and a
[58:17] woman
[58:18] it passes the love between the
[58:20] motherboard
[58:22] the love of God is a great love

[59:38] they did well to put her on the feet of
[59:41] Jesus
[59:42] God was blocked in it
[59:49] he says that whosoever who the person
[59:53] who has never sinned here I want that
[59:56] person to
[59:57] cast the first stone to this woman
[1:00:00] God
[1:00:36] [Applause]
[1:01:18] he was born
[1:01:20] through sex
[1:01:26] he was going through sex
[1:01:31] without Jesus Christ Abel was going to
[1:01:34] be lost
[1:01:36] that's why everyone was was going to be
[1:01:39] lost without the love of Jesus Christ
[1:01:42] but because they killed Abel
[1:01:45] his blood started crying out
[1:01:49] Vengeance his blood started crying out
[1:01:55] does the blood speak
[1:01:57] yes blood speaks

[1:03:18] married
[1:03:19] because God is with me brother stop
[1:03:25] with your faith

[1:03:43] tonight
[1:03:45] I'm going to present to you the best
[1:03:47] Paul says
[1:03:50] in Hebrews 24 12.
[1:03:53] he says Jesus Christ
[1:03:56] the mediator of the New Covenant it is
[1:04:05] that speaks better
[1:04:06] than the blood of Abel
[1:04:12] when they killed Jesus Christ
[1:04:17] length of his law
[1:04:18] his blood Cried Out father father
[1:04:26] forgive their sins
[1:04:30] they don't know what they're doing
[1:04:33] the blood that speaks better
[1:04:36] than the blood of Abel
[1:04:39] that's a Christian
[1:04:44] when you're a Christian
[1:04:47] you have the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:04:50] and when you have the blood of Jesus
[1:04:53] Christ
[1:04:54] it's a blood that speaks in your favor
[1:04:57] his face speaks in the Bible
[1:05:00] it's a blood that speaks of the enemy
[1:05:07] that's why Christ died
[1:05:12] that's what being a Christian is
[1:05:17] Jesus says I'm the way the truth in life
[1:05:22] it's not it's not the the those roads
[1:05:25] those those roads the highways when he
[1:05:28] says I'm the way
[1:05:30] it means I'm the moral
[1:05:33] [Applause]
[1:05:34] Revenge them on exam follow my example
[1:05:37] amen
[1:05:39] I'm the model I'm the example
[1:05:43] in the Statue of the perfect man
[1:05:46] this is what is love
[1:05:50] everyone says love is not just to give
[1:05:53] uh you're close to another brother
[1:05:58] love is not giving food to somebody
[1:06:02] says in the Statue of the perfect man
[1:06:05] he says
[1:06:23] it means that you are like God yeah
[1:06:29] before getting into a perfect laws
[1:06:34] you have to be like God first
[1:06:37] now as your nature is your behavior is
[1:06:42] your character
[1:06:44] the way you do things as a Christian
[1:06:47] is it God
[1:06:50] or is it the devil
[1:07:02] [Applause]
[1:07:06] because it's the brotherly love that has
[1:07:10] to get in
[1:07:12] without
[1:07:16] brotherly kindness
[1:07:19] without brotherly kindness
[1:07:24] you're just a Christian by name
[1:07:28] but you're not transformed
[1:07:31] but you have to be transformed
[1:07:35] and the message has to give you a form
[1:07:38] amen amen amen foreign
[1:07:41] [Music]
[1:07:46] you have to be like God
[1:07:52] now when you get to become like God
[1:07:57] then that's where you add the seventh
[1:07:59] virtue
[1:08:02] that's that's called a brotherly
[1:08:05] kindness
[1:08:08] that's Divine the the violet
[1:08:13] that is the purple color right
[1:08:19] brother Brown says what is love
[1:08:24] he says it's to forgive your brother
[1:08:29] it's to forgive your brother who sinned
[1:08:32] against you
[1:08:34] no matter what he's done to you
[1:08:40] you can't talk about Brotherly Love
[1:08:43] Without forgiveness
[1:08:53] only God can forgive
[1:08:57] because God Is Lost simple
[1:09:01] that's why he forgive the world
[1:09:04] that sinned against him
[1:09:08] that's the length of the love
[1:09:12] now let's talk about the length
[1:09:15] for example
[1:09:17] the kingdom of God that was Peter
[1:09:21] and Peter was a vulgar man
[1:09:25] he was a man from the lower class
[1:09:28] he was a a fisher of Saint Jerry Demonte
[1:09:34] fisherman and God if God asked him
[1:09:39] bring me 11 disciples so that with you
[1:09:42] your B12 disciples
[1:09:47] Peter war is gonna look for 11 people
[1:09:49] that who were like him
[1:09:52] because his surroundings
[1:09:56] a place where fishermen's were I live in
[1:09:59] here
[1:10:02] with people from his surroundings
[1:10:06] then he was going to bring 11 people who
[1:10:09] were like him then he can say with them
[1:10:12] we are 12.
[1:10:15] if he told Matthew I'm an M1 bring me
[1:10:21] Matthew was a was a um
[1:10:24] an accountant
[1:10:26] he was an intellectual
[1:10:29] then he was also going to look for
[1:10:32] people who were intellectuals like
[1:10:34] if he has Paul Paul
[1:10:36] was going to bring Pharisees like him
[1:10:39] but look at the love of God
[1:10:42] to the length of the love of God
[1:10:55] then
[1:10:58] we call each other brothers
[1:11:02] that's the love of God
[1:11:06] passes all understanding
[1:11:10] that can take you from from from
[1:11:16] David from a jungle
[1:11:22] that's what God made of you
[1:11:24] [Music]
[1:11:27] you are the queen Jesus
[1:11:31] I want to ask you tonight
[1:11:33] America you're an American yeah
[1:11:37] go tell Joe Biden you're going to eat
[1:11:40] with him tomorrow
[1:11:43] and then let's see if he's going to have
[1:11:46] you in his own
[1:11:47] America but you're just an American like
[1:11:50] and he won't receive you if you ask him
[1:12:02] is
[1:12:07] lower than the Throne of God
[1:12:11] God cast their Satan from Heaven
[1:12:17] because of the throne where you are
[1:12:19] going to be sitting
[1:12:24] what have you done to to to to to get a
[1:12:27] throne that's bigger than the sensation
[1:12:29] throne
[1:12:32] show me what have you done
[1:12:36] to sit on the throne
[1:12:41] there is no Throne without suffering
[1:12:44] you have to suffer terrain
[1:12:48] there is no Crown without suffering
[1:12:53] there's no crowd without suffering
[1:12:58] you have to suffer
[1:13:02] that's why Jesus let us suffer
[1:13:08] Rejoice every time they talk they talk
[1:13:11] they talk uh wrong about you
[1:13:20] don't get angry
[1:13:22] birds don't say oh I'm gonna call this
[1:13:26] guy

[1:13:46] you that's that's how you do it
[1:13:49] it's sincerity
[1:13:51] sincerely
[1:13:58] it's not a fake love
[1:14:01] it's hypocrisy at the end
[1:14:06] people will fail their tests
[1:14:09] when you study in universities I'm a
[1:14:14] physician I'm a physicist
[1:14:18] I'm a surgeon okay
[1:14:21] that means you have to pass
[1:14:24] in the test
[1:14:27] you can't fail in your test
[1:14:30] they can't give you a diploma
[1:14:34] of a doctor or a physician it does not
[1:14:38] exist
[1:14:44] [Applause]
[1:14:50] pay attention to those things
[1:14:54] you must have brotherly love
[1:14:58] yeah
[1:14:59] the third measure is the the height
[1:15:07] you have to get down
[1:15:11] [Laughter]
[1:15:13] Jesus Christ
[1:15:16] he washed the feets of his disciples
[1:15:19] he was God Philippians Philippians 5
[1:15:24] verse 2. hey you don't come full now
[1:15:27] having you
[1:15:29] the the feelings
[1:15:33] [Applause]
[1:15:57] he started washing the feets of his
[1:16:00] disciples
[1:16:01] when there is the the the
[1:16:13] your feet
[1:16:15] no
[1:16:18] way yes sir now you see that
[1:16:23] no today we we left even the cop
[1:16:27] s
[1:16:28] instead of having everybody drink
[1:16:32] now we start looking at diseases
[1:16:35] Paul didn't know those little cups that
[1:16:38] you get
[1:16:39] Jesus didn't know those little things
[1:16:52] [Applause]
[1:16:58] we have all those things
[1:17:02] he says
[1:17:06] he says that no one can no man can know
[1:17:08] God through his five senses
[1:17:12] because the five senses were given to us
[1:17:15] just to live here
[1:17:17] it has nothing to do with God
[1:17:21] how fun did you if you're a son of God
[1:17:24] from heaven and then you get down here
[1:17:28] you become a prosperous
[1:17:38] what you were in heaven a son of God
[1:18:14] she received the manifested word
[1:18:24] there was only life in the manifested
[1:18:27] word of God
[1:18:29] when the word is written
[1:18:30] [Applause]
[1:18:32] it's a promise
[1:18:39] let's say we're gonna build the Articles
[1:18:42] oh let's come in
[1:18:45] no one will get in heaven after going
[1:18:48] but it's written
[1:18:54] when it's being manifested that's what
[1:18:58] gives you life
[1:19:00] look at Jesus Christ he came and he
[1:19:03] arrived there
[1:19:04] the angel spoke to Mary
[1:19:08] and he taught he tells them the human
[1:19:11] name of God of God
[1:19:14] and he told her his name will be Jesus
[1:19:18] but in the Bible it was written Emmanuel
[1:19:23] Isaiah 7.
[1:19:33] with us is the word
[1:19:36] the word brother
[1:19:39] okay okay the word overall apparel let's
[1:19:43] open the word what's your name Jesus
[1:19:47] let's see who are we talking about here
[1:19:50] Emmanuel Emmanuel
[1:19:52] they said
[1:19:54] we're waiting for Emmanuel
[1:19:57] they rejected Jesus
[1:20:01] Emmanuel who was manifested
[1:20:11] you too you are in the Bible too Monday
[1:21:05] [Applause]
[1:21:11] [Applause]
[1:21:35] it's a great height
[1:21:38] if you only love those that love you
[1:21:39] good God
[1:21:41] came down
[1:21:43] if you want to get up you have to get
[1:21:46] down it's a great time
[1:21:50] then talk to me that said this no
[1:21:52] problem no problem just go go down again
[1:21:56] now
[1:21:58] you see there are some people
[1:22:00] okay
[1:22:02] that the devil will reject me
[1:22:18] I was never with you
[1:22:23] as the devil ever took someone and and
[1:22:26] take him somewhere
[1:22:29] we love you where did you see them
[1:22:35] now let's read how many how many times
[1:22:37] the devil will die
[1:22:42] because a lot of people blame the devil
[1:22:44] no it's you it's not the devil yeah
[1:22:52] James chapter 1 verse verse 12.
[1:22:57] I want to read this in English
[1:23:00] James 1 verse 12 to 15. blessed is the
[1:23:04] man that endureth temptation
[1:23:06] for when he's trying he shall receive
[1:23:09] the Crown of Life which the Lord has
[1:23:11] promised to them
[1:23:16] no we're here there are people that God
[1:23:20] there are the people that love God
[1:23:24] the see the crown
[1:23:26] it's for those that love God
[1:23:32] there are some some people naturally
[1:23:34] they just love God
[1:23:36] you come to church because you naturally
[1:23:40] the pastor is here because he loves God
[1:23:49] now there are some people that love God
[1:23:51] when they say sing they just sing
[1:23:56] amen yeah
[1:24:06] remember
[1:24:30] because you were a demon in heaven
[1:24:33] you've got the Bible that's gonna change
[1:24:36] at the end you're going to get back to
[1:24:38] the demon Stitch that you were
[1:24:44] crown
[1:24:47] s those that love God
[1:24:49] now some people love God
[1:24:52] some people instead of coming to church
[1:24:56] they're doing overtimes at work
[1:24:59] they're looking for dollar or for a
[1:25:02] dollar money dollars
[1:25:05] they leave their children alone
[1:25:10] dirty things on the internet
[1:25:13] and their father is looking for dollars
[1:25:16] for money they're looking for dollars
[1:25:21] you're going to miss it all
[1:25:24] you have to put God in the first place
[1:25:27] foreign
[1:27:20] wanted to see Joseph with it with his
[1:27:23] Bible
[1:27:25] at 56 God said you go
[1:27:28] it's the will of God
[1:27:32] we have to respect the will of God
[1:27:38] let no man say when he's tempted I am
[1:27:42] tempted of God for God cannot be tempted
[1:27:45] with evil neither tempted he any man
[1:27:50] the following verse verse 14 but every
[1:27:53] man is tempted when he's drawn away he's
[1:27:56] thrown away of his own lost
[1:28:00] and enticed
[1:28:03] now then the verse 15 then when lust has
[1:28:07] conceived all save is the pregnancy
[1:28:10] conceived is the pregnancy
[1:28:15] is when you get pregnant
[1:28:20] so when he conceives
[1:28:24] when you can see yeah perception comes
[1:28:27] afterwards
[1:28:30] but the thing that you did was before
[1:28:33] then when just
[1:28:36] um then when lost is conceived it brings
[1:28:38] forth sin and sin when it is finished
[1:28:41] bring forth death
[1:28:46] so sin is before death
[1:28:53] comes
[1:28:55] where unbelief is there
[1:28:58] when a man doesn't love me
[1:29:01] he has things that he's doing
[1:29:03] that he shows death in him
[1:29:08] God gives you a free will
[1:29:11] he doesn't tell you do this do this
[1:29:13] God's not a dictator you have to choose
[1:29:17] to either do the will of God or to do
[1:29:21] your own will but at the end
[1:29:24] there's a door together
[1:29:27] and the door has died
[1:29:31] of the love of God it's the stature of
[1:29:35] the perfect man
[1:29:39] we're going to finish with the last
[1:29:41] measure
[1:29:45] we have the height
[1:29:47] we have the the death
[1:29:51] of God with his love
[1:29:55] came down very low
[1:29:58] in the inferior Zone
[1:30:01] he found demons
[1:30:07] He Walked on death
[1:30:10] on the ways of death
[1:30:13] to save you
[1:30:16] Allah
[1:30:22] and the death where Adam and all those
[1:30:25] people were locked up
[1:30:28] and God went down there
[1:30:33] he gave a kick to the door
[1:30:36] you don't ask permission to say to him
[1:30:54] okay let's buy
[1:30:56] it
[1:30:57] he says broke that's fine
[1:31:00] we're fighting a defeated anime
[1:31:05] that's why Jesus says you're more than a
[1:31:08] Congo an overcomer
[1:31:10] and the grace of God the Lord
[1:31:15] has arrived even where people that
[1:31:18] sinned the times of Sodom work
[1:31:21] he did not forgive them
[1:31:27] for rejecting the words in the times
[1:31:56] let's not do things as we do it in
[1:31:58] families
[1:32:01] I want to show you the family of Jacob
[1:32:05] look at um
[1:32:09] of the Bible
[1:32:14] he couldn't walk
[1:32:18] but he had in him
[1:32:27] she may hand in him
[1:32:32] Esther chapter 2 verse 5. diminutive
[1:32:38] we're going to finish in 10 in 10
[1:32:40] minutes Esther chapter 2 verse 5.
[1:32:43] you want me to read wait now in in
[1:32:46] shushan the place there was uh them
[1:32:49] there was a certain Jew whose name was
[1:32:51] Mordecai the son of jair the son of
[1:32:53] shimei the son of Kish and a benjamite
[1:32:56] okay
[1:32:57] now you saw his tribe right there
[1:33:01] now this man shimi
[1:33:05] was a man who couldn't walk
[1:33:11] they're talking about him in the book of
[1:33:13] second Samuel
[1:33:16] look at the Scandal that you did today
[1:33:20] David was of the tribe of Judah yeah
[1:33:25] was of The Tribe of Benjamin
[1:33:28] this Smith this man right there
[1:33:32] is a great grandfather of Paul
[1:33:36] the first messenger
[1:33:39] he was as a travel
[1:33:42] benjamination so if you have issues with
[1:33:45] Jimmy
[1:33:46] then don't touch the bible
[1:33:51] because she is a great grandfather
[1:33:55] the Paul and Paul
[1:33:58] may not
[1:33:59] Jazzy now Jesus
[1:34:02] he is of the tribe of Judah
[1:34:07] a David and David is of the tribe of
[1:34:11] Jews
[1:34:13] but look at what this brother did to his
[1:34:16] other brother
[1:34:17] because one day
[1:34:20] they asked David
[1:34:23] a man had ten ten sheets
[1:34:27] as the Thousand Chiefs then he received
[1:34:30] visitors
[1:34:32] and the visitor only had one shot so we
[1:34:36] know that story
[1:34:39] so the man who had a thousand sheeps who
[1:34:42] only went to get that one sheep
[1:34:45] so they asked David what can we do to
[1:34:48] such person
[1:34:50] then David said caught his head out
[1:34:54] then Nathan said what
[1:34:58] he said chop his hand
[1:35:03] then Nathan said oh well
[1:35:05] he says say that one more time David
[1:35:09] says kill him
[1:35:12] then Nathan said that person is you
[1:35:16] Danny started crying oh
[1:35:22] God Psalm 51. because of that
[1:35:26] see on Netflix here if we aren't
[1:35:28] Christians
[1:35:30] we have to see that forgiveness
[1:35:33] you have to see forgiveness before you
[1:35:36] kill guys
[1:35:39] who are you today what are you doing
[1:35:43] what's killing today
[1:35:48] killing is not to get a swore and put it
[1:35:52] Killington
[1:35:53] is to destroy the influence of the
[1:35:57] pastor
[1:35:58] to destroy the influence of your brother
[1:36:01] you killed him
[1:36:04] don't kill
[1:36:06] let's Sunday the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:36:09] speaks better
[1:36:14] speaks in favor of your brother
[1:36:18] now because he said David God said David
[1:36:22] I'm going to cast you out
[1:36:25] even though you're gonna come back and
[1:36:29] your son will become
[1:36:30] now on his way
[1:36:32] while he was going through that's where
[1:36:36] he found this this man do you know that
[1:36:38] she made of the name of shimi is
[1:36:44] you found them in seconds
[1:36:47] verse 16 verse says chapter 16 verse
[1:36:57] Samuel 16 verse 5.
[1:37:01] and when King David came to
[1:37:03] bahubrim behold dance this came out a
[1:37:07] man of the family of the House of Soul
[1:37:09] whose name was shime
[1:37:11] well you see where she made it
[1:37:16] was was a great grandfather grandfather
[1:37:20] of the of Mordecai
[1:37:26] was the tutor of Esther
[1:37:32] now look at that image really well
[1:37:41] he was not formed well
[1:37:45] even though he was walking like this
[1:37:49] he had in him Mordecai
[1:38:00] is the tutor of Esther
[1:38:03] to get on this road you needed
[1:38:10] now look at the behavior of
[1:38:14] he started insulting
[1:38:17] with his tongue the King David now
[1:38:22] follow his words
[1:38:26] um the son of he came forth and cursed
[1:38:29] still as he came and he cast stones at
[1:38:32] David and all the Servants of King David
[1:38:34] and all the people and all the mighty
[1:38:36] men were on his right hand and on his
[1:38:38] left
[1:38:42] when he cursed come out come out thou
[1:38:45] bloody man and thou men of bilia
[1:38:48] the Lord has returned upon thee all the
[1:38:51] blood of the House of Soul and whose
[1:38:53] dead thou has reigned and the Lord has
[1:38:56] delivered the kingdom into the hand of
[1:38:58] Absalom lysine and behold Thou Art taken
[1:39:01] and thy Mischief because thou are a
[1:39:04] bloody man okay
[1:39:08] now this man insults him like that
[1:39:11] a king great king
[1:39:16] David is a type of Christ
[1:39:21] now look at the Servants of David
[1:39:24] his name was
[1:39:27] verse 9.
[1:39:29] he says this
[1:39:34] why this dead dog
[1:39:39] why should this dead dog curse my Lord
[1:39:41] the king
[1:39:44] allow me to cut his head off
[1:40:09] David forgets
[1:40:20] he had a victory over a couple minutes
[1:40:24] then God put David back on the throne
[1:40:29] got back got back on that oh on that
[1:40:34] they said David
[1:40:36] is going back to the throne
[1:40:39] that's it for you
[1:40:42] I did the good things
[1:40:45] he wanted to throw himself at the feet
[1:40:48] of David and David forgive him
[1:41:02] [Applause]
[1:41:10] to remove Esther from the Bible
[1:41:16] the tongue
[1:41:18] is the world of unbelief
[1:41:23] the the tongue is a fire
[1:41:26] that's why
[1:41:28] James chapter one says that's where
[1:41:32] we're going to finish
[1:41:33] I'm gonna close my things here
[1:41:36] let's all read together
[1:41:38] James chapter one
[1:41:43] James chapter 3.
[1:41:47] the star and the first verse my brethren
[1:41:51] be not many Masters knowing that we
[1:41:55] shall receive the greater condemnation
[1:41:56] for and many things we offend all okay
[1:42:01] If any man offend not in word the same
[1:42:05] is a perfect man
[1:42:14] it's a perfect man the tongue
[1:42:18] is
[1:42:19] what came in in in Pentecost
[1:42:24] the tongues of Fire
[1:42:32] the person became perfect
[1:42:38] it's the holy ghost that determines
[1:42:42] it's the tongue of fire that the
[1:42:44] difference
[1:42:45] that you have God in you
[1:42:48] because the tongue is a fire
[1:42:53] no second verse for in many things we
[1:42:57] offend If any man will fan not and were
[1:42:58] the same as a perfect man and Abel also
[1:43:01] to Bridle the whole body behold we put
[1:43:05] bits in the horse's mouth that they may
[1:43:08] obey us okay
[1:43:11] control the horse
[1:43:17] because the horse represents the power
[1:43:20] control they control his his the bride
[1:43:24] or his mouth
[1:43:25] they put something around us
[1:43:29] that's why God sealed our mouth with the
[1:43:32] Holy Ghost
[1:43:33] foreign
[1:44:03] to control your body
[1:44:05] you have to control your tongue we're
[1:44:09] gonna go forward
[1:44:12] behold
[1:44:14] um wait behold also the ships
[1:44:17] behold also the ships which though they
[1:44:20] be so great and are driven of fierce
[1:44:22] winds yet are they turned about with a
[1:44:25] very small helm
[1:44:27] with with whether so ever the governor
[1:44:30] lit listed even though the tongue is a
[1:44:34] little member and boasteth great things
[1:44:38] behold how great a matter a little fire
[1:44:41] Kinder Kinder ah
[1:44:45] tongue is a little fire
[1:44:47] every tongue here
[1:44:52] the tongue burned marriages
[1:44:56] the tongue burnt relationships
[1:45:01] it burnt churches
[1:45:04] the tongue divided Brothers
[1:45:08] but God put us together
[1:45:13] so we can all be together let Minister
[1:45:16] the ministry it's so that we can walk
[1:45:20] together
[1:45:26] don't divide a church

[1:46:08] little member and boasts this great
[1:46:09] thing behold how great of a matter a
[1:46:12] little fire kindled and the tongue is a
[1:46:14] fire a world of iniquity so as the
[1:46:18] tongue among our members that it
[1:46:21] defileth the whole body and set it on
[1:46:23] fire the course of Nature and it is set
[1:46:26] on fire of hell
[1:46:28] you see
[1:46:32] is an inflammation
[1:46:49] that's why God sent the fire of the Holy
[1:46:52] Ghost
[1:46:58] to burn inflammations
[1:47:03] so we can all be perfect
[1:47:07] so we don't talk evil of our brothers
[1:47:10] so we don't talk evil over our past
[1:47:13] so you don't talk evil
[1:47:18] only a brotherly love
[1:47:33] Isaiah Isaiah chapter 6.
[1:47:36] what happened
[1:47:37] that's my prayer for you and we're gonna
[1:47:41] finish right there
[1:47:43] Isaiah chapter six
[1:47:46] from verse one in the year that King
[1:47:49] ozia died
[1:47:52] I saw also the Lord sitting upon a
[1:47:54] throne high and lifted up and his train
[1:47:57] filled the temple above it stood the
[1:48:00] seraphines each one had six wings the
[1:48:03] twin he covered his face and with 20
[1:48:05] covered his feet and with Twain he did
[1:48:07] fly and one Cried unto another and said
[1:48:10] holy holy holy ah is the Lord of hosts
[1:48:37] let's continue
[1:48:39] the whole earth is full of his glory and
[1:48:42] the post of the door moved at the voice
[1:48:44] of him that cried and the house was
[1:48:46] filled with smoke then said I who was me
[1:48:49] for I am undone because I am a man of
[1:48:53] unclean lips and I dwell in the midst of
[1:48:55] people of unclean lips from on eyes have
[1:48:58] seen the king the Lord of hosts
[1:49:01] how he speaks
[1:49:03] same Prophet it's a prophet
[1:49:06] it's a great
[1:49:08] but he got himself down
[1:49:39] he took the good attitude
[1:49:41] [Applause]
[1:49:50] but it's Christ who lives for me in me
[1:49:54] and when he confessed no
[1:49:59] uh mine eyes then flew one of the
[1:50:01] seraphines unto me having a live coal in
[1:50:04] his hand which he had taken with the
[1:50:07] tongues from off the altar oh
[1:50:23] a dog
[1:50:26] a man can dominance
[1:50:32] he can tame a lion or or or an elephant
[1:50:37] but the Bible says no man can tame his
[1:50:40] own tongue
[1:50:42] control now this is the only thing that
[1:50:45] controls that tames the tongues
[1:50:48] it's the call of Fire
[1:51:20] what the
[1:51:22] you have to humble yourself
[1:51:26] you have to accept correction
[1:51:30] that's how you're going to become great
[1:51:32] man
[1:51:33] when you will accept correction
[1:51:37] you can be correcting yourself
[1:51:44] it's the pastor who has the great
[1:51:46] knowledge
[1:51:48] when you have more knowledge than him
[1:51:50] can you go make your own church
[1:51:53] that's what you did but don't be
[1:51:56] disturbing
[1:51:59] don't say oh look here
[1:52:01] there is no Divine Spirit here there is
[1:52:05] no power touch no you don't have a
[1:52:07] vision
