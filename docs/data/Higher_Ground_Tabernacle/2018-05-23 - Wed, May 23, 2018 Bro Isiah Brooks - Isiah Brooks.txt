John the first chapter but also read from Genesis 1 st. John the first chapter we read one through five and then Genesis 1:1 glad to see everybody out here tonight so many people they don't know how to worship God they ashamed sometime because we've been taught that the devil can have all the fun when it's worship time you go some of these games they pick up each other and throw each other in there but when it comes to God you're supposed to sit quiet that's nonsense the Bible says let everything that hath breath praise the Lord Amen God loves a joyful noise you know what you know like I always tell you if the Lord should take me and I go home don't come near singing near my god too deep ain't near him I'm in here so you know when y'all come to my funeral if you do bring all your instruments and I want y'all to praise and worship God if you don't do it I might get up [Laughter] hallelujah don't be moaning over me because I'm gonna be having a good time if y'all if you don't general st. John one began at beginning in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was the light of men and the light shine earth and darkness and the darkness comprehended it not that's a good thought light shining in darkness and the darkness comprehended it not Genesis 1 was just going to read that first verse Genesis 1 in the beginning God created the heavens they heaven and the earth let us pray our Heavenly Father we thank you for your grace and your mercy we thank you for being so good to us you have been better to us Lord than we've been to ourselves and we love you Lord Jesus with all our hearts Lord we're not perfect within ourselves but because of your amazing grace you have made us perfect thank you father God we just pray Lord that you bless each and every heart tonight may we all go out of this place feeling closer to you than we did when we first come in bless us now in your lovely name Jesus Christ we pray amen you may be seated I want I want to say tonight that you know we look at this Bible like I said last service when we talk about this Bible this Bible have been they've tried to destroy this Bible for thousands of years now amen and and you know no matter how they tried to kill it or they can't but the Bible said in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God it is God now it is God letter form now you can burn this Bible but could and destroy it but you can never destroy God because the Bible tells us that God is a spirit hallelujah so you can understand what I'm saying before there ever was anything there was God we call him by God's grace elohim LOLOL him he is the self-existing one you understand me so what do you mean what I'm trying to say is that very air that you're breathing God created it but God doesn't need air to breathe because if God needed the air to breathe then the air becomes God because the air becomes greater than God you see so God Amen is a spirit God doesn't need food hallelujah to survive he existed and none of us knows how it all happened we can't even comprehend it in our minds because we have always known beginnings and endings is that right first and last but God was here when nothing else was here matter of fact he created nothing a man because when God was everywhere he was a spirit of attributes right he was a spirit he's an intelligent being the most intelligent ever there's no one else that is greater than he matter of fact in the book of Isaiah said if there be another god he says I don't know him he taught Israel Israel know that the LORD thy God he is one there's only one God and you know we thought we know that theologians have cut him up in all kinds of pieces and everything else but let me say it like this who will you believe the Bible or the man the Bible said know ye know ye this Israel the Lord thy God is one amen so there's something you said what do you mean like I was telling you we have come in a time where and this is an intellectual age everybody is smart you know except me you know but everybody is smart everybody you know your education is rapid and you're really stupid if you don't go to school that's what they say but I find out that the people that didn't go to school was the ones that were closest to God hallelujah no I know is that it doesn't give an account of Noah ever going to going to school but he was smart enough to build an hour hallelujah why because he was in tune with the Creator right and you and I every one of us have been made in the image and likeness of God and in our minds we are creators you take a child you don't have to tell him how to try to create little things little dirt heels and all that he's always there trying to fashion something according to what he's seeing in his mind why he's born like that he's in that image right out of all the animals we are that most intelligent ones why because we're more than just an animal and not Eve fallen Adam fell we wouldn't be part animal in part God but because of their fall we became more like the animal because of them we died because of what they did but you see we have seen by God me so what what do you mean brother understand there's a purpose and what is a purpose a person a purpose is the reason for which something exists you think God just created all this like some people think he created all of this and just left it alone let's see how it grows no he had a purpose God is a God of order right he could have just brought everything together like something painters and artists now they don't care how they do it they just did this name whatever goes on there you find this critic comes out that it's so glorious it's a mess but it shows the intelligence of a man you know everything that's disarrayed and disordered orderly I think it's beautiful but you find out that when we when we look at this book every answer to your questions are right here in this book Amen God tells us why he made man he didn't have - but he did he had animals he had he had seraphim's he had cherubims he had he was God before we came into existence now we were always with him is that right she in reality it doesn't matter nothing is completely annihilated everything when it's done away with go back to what it used to be before it became a substance so you and I know that you never ever completely annihilate your consciousness and everything else may be broke down into whatever it was before it came to being but you know you and I go back why are you saying all these things brother books because God is God and he can't lose nothing everything God had in the beginning of it from the beginning however you want to say it will always be God's it goes back to where it came from now we look at this thing is or why Genesis brother Bruce because there in Genesis 1:27 we find that God said let us make man in our image Genesis 1:27 and people don't understand that they said well well what is he doing in Genesis 2 21 and 22 the Bible said you know because you and I must understand God is a spirit so first of all God created the first Adam spirit is that right sure he did you could even in the word if it ain't the words you don't have very minute you know and people don't understand how that God comes along and I was saying like this when it comes to preaching I had to do it the way God gives it to me I'm not a parent and you come along and you find out the people we find out that here God comes along and he creates a man and now you can't even see him because he is spirit hallelujah he's Adam and we find out to a man that Adam basically led the animals just like the Holy Ghost leads you you ever seen him yet the Holy Ghost but you know him you know his feelings you know his presence when he's there is that right but then God was what was he doing here the purpose he's a he's easy all like Tahiti Elohim he's God and think about it God condescending into his creation just for fellowship he was a self existing one but in him was all attributes Oh every tree that ever lived was in God hallelujah everything everything was in him and by God's creation what did he do he brought it out y'all believe that and you said what do you what do you what are you getting here answers in the book where am I she laid purpose for your birth into this dimension is that you would become a son of God and worship Him it doesn't matter how great your achievements on this world if you don't become a Christian knowing the Lord Jesus you have missed the purpose for which you were born million people miss it they think Oh God meant me to ride to the moon well you go to the moon what you're gonna find there and you know the things that gets me is all all the solutions to our problems are right there and Solomon Solomon said listen I tried everything and everything I have found vanity he said here's the conclusion of the matter fear God and keep his Commandments hallelujah why are you saying that because you're gonna die in this body you're going to die and where are you going here's where you did you're done don't you believe that I was in a world called my mama for nine months hallelujah I knew nothing about this world now where I was before that I was in my daddy's lords hallelujah my daddy transferred me into my mama hallelujah she had the barren ground and all of a sudden I began to grow arms legs ears and all these things in this wound I grew eyes and nose and the mouth and all these things I didn't need none of that not in my room in my mom's whoo-ha she said me she walked and so for me she did everything for me all I did was relaxed and have a good time get a few kicks every now and then you know hey man turn turn a little somersault every now and again y'all know but nevertheless I was in my own world and it was comfortable hallelujah but nature has a way of pushing you into something cuz you know and being living beings we're lazy we can be lazy and sometimes you know it is true you know you find no winners or win witness baby coming witness baby coming you know some babies are right at nine months and some babies are gonna hold on to ten and you find out by the God's grace God has to help one thing I love about babies normal babies are born in a prayer position they come down they come out looking at the dust from which they came as a testimony of God right you have the blood you have the water you have the spirit you have justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost hallelujah you say oh I got a baby you don't have a baby until that baby breathes on his own and you don't have a true son of God until he breathes about breeze the breath of life in here now let me go on the CDs and I'm off a little bit so you understand that what God did he created him spiritual and then he formed him out of the dust of the ground right to creation of one man that's why we're body soul and spirit hallelujah but I said all of that to say because of sin you and I in art we let me ask you a question how did you get here the normal way of getting into this world is by birth you're born into this world you didn't come by a fire and salsa or do you know any kind of being you came by birth right in order to get into the kingdom of God you come by birth see it ain't nothing you can do about it it's God quickening the seed in you and that she brings forth his life she the purpose was this is the this is the mystery of Genesis because when God created Adam and Eve he created Adam right and nobody knew nothing about II like I said yesterday the last time I preached the mystery of Adam was easy hallelujah and the mystery of God was that he had a feminine part the Bible calls him el shadi I which is breasted one hallelujah male and female now that's a little bit of that's a little bit of something there but my point is you know if you take the natural and look at the spiritual every living creature had male female male female male female right every man took a wife every man took a wife and that's what God said be fruitful and multiply how Adam by himself was gonna do it hallelujah now you and I know by God's grace that II came out of Adam because she was there all the time hallelujah and he did not take up some other kind of dirt the Bible said he took a part of her real and formed her a feminine body right but she hadn't was Adam look at Genesis 5:1 the Bible's the generation of Adam the Bible said that when God made Adam he made them male and female and called their t-80 our name Adam so both had the same name that's the valuable see the answer is in the book and the problem was is that Adam and Eve was separated and he did some things she shouldn't have done hallelujah and what did she do with that she brought forth two kinds of people all right y'all know the story of Cain and Abel and Cain and Abel a man came from the same room but there were two seeds two different seeds one was a murderer and the other one was after after Adam it's in there but I'm not gonna dwell on that my point is there was a purpose what was the purpose what was the purpose let's go back let's go back before we knew anything before Adam and Eve was planted we find out that there was a war in heaven y'all remember that there's a war in heaven and Lucifer rebelled against God Ezekiel I believe it says you have said in your heart is that easy good yeah you're my one of the two you said in your heart and there you have said in your heart I will excel excel above the throne of God our cause the stars of God to worship me did he do it oh come on the whole plan was to absolutely cause the true sons of God to worship Him but he couldn't do it not in the original so he had to slip in something that could produce another kind of seed in the image and likeness of God but totally not God y'all hit me so that he could find somebody to worship Him and that's what we're living in today people we're living in a world where you got two kinds of people you got a people that will be of God and other people that will be of the devil that's it and you said well what do you mean you know that's that's why the Bible said that in the book of Genesis there was a God there was a tree of the knowledge of good and evil and there was a tree of life so two trees was in there with had two purposes different purposes right the tree of life can only give you life the tree of knowledge of good and evil is giving us what we got today you say well what do you have brother Brooks I've got an automobile that's good and evil some of us got guns that is good and evil some of us know doctors that are good and evil see there's nothing that you cannot do good or evil because we're subject to it because of the fall we're subject to it right and so many people ask the question they said well what did God mean when he says we let us it's in the Bible is in this book so we come along and we find ourselves in our 20:18 who is not Lord look at all of the stuff that's going on in the world is it not in here it was prophesied that this was going to be this way how many y'all believe in prophecy see the truth of the matter is it is and my thing is it doesn't matter it's like when Noah said it's gonna rain for 120 years it's gonna rain see it doesn't matter whether you believe it or not if God said it it's gonna happen hallelujah when the Angels went down to Sodom and said hey it's going to rain fire brimstone we've never seen such a thing before I've got my summer house I got my winter house I got everything I need hallelujah but the scientists said we've not seen them like that but they had never seen rain before either but a rain I always task people this I said well let me ask you something get more didn't know a drag that our couple on Mount Everest how did that all get up on Mount Everest it's a witness it's a true fact that they have discovered the Ark of God Moses knows Noah's Ark amount ever Eric how did it get up there the flood in almost every nation no matter how primitive it's been they have an account of the flood even the American Indians had account of the flood you know but God don't need a witnesses such I heard somebody say well you know you know give me you got to give me proof but the truth of the matter is you ever thought about this how Moses wrote almost all of the Old Testament how did Moses write Genesis what do you then y'all understand me well he was a prophet and the Bible said that the word of the Lord comes to what a prophet God says in Amos 3:7 I will do nothing except I show it to my prophets first so he's a warning he's a neck he's an alarm he's a he's and you know it's just what people don't understand we are at a time right now this world is getting ready to crumble hello let me let me use an illustration and then I'll move on move on what am I trying to say you have a purpose here every one of us that's been born we have a purpose not only just to be a Christian but to to do what God has purpose in our hearts to do it is his mind for us to do right now you show a brother like you don't have to be a great man you know I think about that little feller that gave them a few fish and loaves of bread y'all for me with that story gave the fish and loaves of bread and that's all he had to do hallelujah and I think about Amen that woman a man who had only there's two pence amen and she put it in the service that's all she had to do she was created just for that nothing more nothing less and no one else could have done her job hallelujah we're serving a living God if we could get just like I was telling somebody the other day and I I'll put some scripture in just a minute I was saying to people other guys said the hardest thing for us Christians to do is to get people to believe that there is a God and Jesus Christ is the one they ought to be serving why because you got two kinds of people have you ever met people that's so evil and they don't even care they don't feel a remorse they can do whatever they want to do and say whatever they want to say and never regret nothing don't ever apologize nothing like that that's something dark they're right and it doesn't always have to be that kind of a person it could be a real religious person but you see when God is in a man's heart he acts like God oh I'm so glad I got a few aliens in here we are call is your Brotherhood isn't just that crazy are you crazy let me say it like this everything I'm saying I could prove by the scripture if you believe the scripture I can show you my point is this we have not been called to be a Baptist Methodist Presbyterian message helicopter we've been called to do none of that we have been called to be sons and daughters of God and every organization got somebody there representing God and you don't have to believe it but it's true that's why the Bible said come out of her my people hallelujah there they must be in there in order to come out huh because God did not want us trusting in an organization he don't want us trusting a man in a man-made system he wants us to trust in him is that right David said Lord I put my trust in you we're not against our people or anything like that but it is systems that keeps us apart is that right if I was headed when a house is divided it cannot stand and Christians everywhere won't stand because they got a little difference that's nonsense I got eight children and they all different but they're mine if that makes it and you see these things you said all problems what are you saying she in order for us to see the move of God like he's hallelujah like he said he was gonna do in this last day we must shed all this nonsense and get right back to the Word of God hallelujah the revelation of Jesus Christ he said the holy man is Christ the Holy Spirit is in us how dare the how Arkadiy clear that the laity has no word to say each one has something to say each one has a work each one has a ministry everybody in here has a ministry in a work it ain't all about the pastor hallelujah is that right it's not just about me it's about all of us and we all play a part this is what I love about communion you know I'm jumping here but communion means a lot to me because communion take one bread and he breaks it all up and gives it to each individual right and the scriptures say don't leave none you got to eat it all but let's put it let's rewind this thing if we take those fragments of bread and we put them ball back together what do you call that unity because we're made out of the same system substance we made out of the same bread we just got pieces that's what he tried to teach his disciples I am the bread but when I'm broken on Calvary I'm gonna give you a piece of me you're a piece of me your piece of me and understand it's the same bread than all of your eating and so therefore you should be united in the spirit but we so religious we take it like some sacrament or something like that and we we missed the whole reverence of it we missed the whole revelation of it this is why Christians are not supposed to take it unworthily because we must respect one another hallelujah he's my brother I don't know about that brother he you know he's got problems who doesn't have problems you raise your hand and you know what i'ma call you know what you lie if you see you not having troubles is this okay what Jesus Christ is the only potentate you say how did it Jesus Christ why is it not God the Father or God the Son of God the Holy Ghost because you got to understand the Bible said the fullness of God the fullness of God dwelt in Jesus right and if you understand that if there's a minor revelation I'm not here to try to give you no revelation but I'm trying to tell you if G if God put himself into this body then what do I become to you right and that's what God did God put himself in Jesus right and in John 10:30 he says I and the father are one you don't have to break it down just believe it hallelujah the Bible says neither salvation in any other that's that's that's the book of Acts neither is there salvation in any other but there is no other name given among men whereby we must be saved and it doesn't matter what the theologians say it doesn't matter I don't care how many degrees as people say oh I don't think Christianity is the only way it is there's only one door there was only one door - they are is that right and Jesus said amen even to the Pharisees of his day he said except you believe that I am he you should likewise die in your sins the problem is is finding real Christians because everybody that say they are Christians are not reflecting Christianity chief this Bible is soul is full from Genesis to Revelation fusion or when we get in the book of Revelation hello you are in the book of Revelation you're right at the place - we're up in the burn happen but it will it's going to happen people you know they look at that that volcano over there in Hawaii and nobody I'm telling you something getting ready to happen that's all I can take and I don't know maybe God blocked me from going up there's my watch interstate I don't know for a reason but I'm gonna tell you something something feeling ready to happen now think about this for years we've seen underground creatures running swimming not running with Swift away from danger right and then when they catch them some of them are boiled already cooked as if they've ran through a fire under water hundreds of birds falling thousands of fish dying all kinds of stuff happening now and people don't even think one thing about it and the Bible speaks of all of that and what is it the earth is groaning there's getting ready to come a birth right see because you got to understand everything is about birthing right now you said what do you mean this world would go through he's going through a justification it went through his water baptism amen by the way of Noah it went through the blood which was st. vacation when Jesus Christ died and his blood fell on the earth is sanctified it you see what I'm trying to say men don't go to hell because of their evil doings men go to hell because they refuse to accept Jesus Christ as they Savior you were born a sinner hallelujah you can't crucify the pea because he's appearing he was Vaughn appearing and in order to change the pin you got to change his nature that's what the Holy Ghost in the Holy Ghost is God coming in you giving you a change of nature is this okay I I got I'm alone when the preacher so I'm trying to hurry right we got guests and I want them to come back you know you look at people don't judge me we look at people and we must understand that God is God and when you know you called by God it doesn't matter what people think right so you look at these things and you say all brother Brooks you know what is wrong with these people people think they got the Holy Ghost when they don't have it and all how can you know the Holy Ghost because the Holy Ghost know his word the Holy Ghost says Amen you know what Amen it means so be it let God's will be done right you love the Lord we look at this thing and we we say Oh what is your purpose your purpose can be one that stands with God or one that stands against God you got Christ and you got Antichrist those are only two Spears in the world one that's stand with Christ and the other one that stands against it right the one who says oh this Bible don't mean that oh you don't have to do this because that don't mean that if I say go up close that door right and I never change it I say go close the door now if you repeat - when I say go close the door but you didn't do what I said dude you got to move and go close the door right but it's still gonna be the same the instructions have never changed that's how it is with God the instructions never changes and no matter how much you repeat what he says like I was telling somebody the other day don't you know you as a Christian you can become a false witness hello you said well how is that brother Brooks remember before Jesus had false accusers and they said he said that he would destroy this temple in three days and raise it up in three days that's what they said that was his false accusers did Jesus say that yes he said it he said see this temple in three days I can I can I can destroy it and raise it up but he wasn't talking about that temple he was talking about this temple hallelujah and listen they said you know what they killed Jesus they killed Jesus cuz he let them kill him he said I laid down my life who did he lay it down for you and me we were sinners like the first Adam got us in trouble the second Adam had to get us out and that was Jesus Christ himself hallelujah one world religion is of the devil the Bible is all in the only things right I know people say whether Quran is a crown name right this is right the Bible says heaven and earth to be clear of his glory right you know you got to understand people I was telling somebody the other day I think I was here I said you know when you feed the baby I love feeding babies you got that little spoon little cute little thing and you got that little food on that mouth and it trying to feed their baby you put that and the baby always spit more than half of the food back out all right you're trying to put it in their mouth I love it cuz you pushing it in you got to get a little faster than he is and then finally you get them all all that food in and your wife is mountain you feel like you've accomplished something at least they got a good spoonful I had enough of them so I know what I'm talking about don't you know that's how God does try to feed a baby a snake you're killing hmm people don't understand when my day you know they got these food processors and everything else you know in my day you know what the food processors was your mom and your daddy y'all don't know that do you they took that food and chewed it up and then gave it to you yes we didn't have that that that what they got that baby job food and stuff like that and just was your dad job that was junk food not JA and you think that baby can't it was just glad it was getting food right that's why I love that ego the Lord liking himself as a eagle and an eagle will feed beat to beak right oh I love that I love that I love that amen amen you love God we don't know but the whole how many of y'all looking for a change in your life everybody's groaning that's why you hear it sure you there's something that tells you this is not what I'm supposed to be now how many turn you have felt you know even when you've done row is this is not really what I wanna do see that's God in you everybody don't feel that that's God in you that's a representation of God in you that God gave you before the foundation of the world and God don't keep pulling on you and keep pulling on you until he gets you don't be like me I fought I ran from God but by the time hearing by the time he finished I was like yes yeah he spanked you out the Wow y'all don't believe that parents do yeah you know okay Johnny don't don't get go too far from me you keep going and eat and they grab you and it's all over you know it but it's out of love is out a correction let me hurry up here it's a paradox like we said the other day it's a paradox it's something that's true that you can't explain you said what do you mean Jonah was swallowed by a whale and was in that belly of the whale about three days or so how many I'll believe that come on folks somebody says well that whale belly that whale throat is so small the Bible said God prepared a fish so what that will I was elected and selected hallelujah huh and he made that well if not big enough to swallow Jonah you know I tell people I said how many I believe that the arm when Moses Amen a drought that all that Pharaoh I mean all drowned in the Red Sea how many I'll believe that a lot of people said that nonsense where they found evidence chariots and everything else at the bottom how did they get there I've heard theologian said you know he he he led them on this out of there where the Reeves or about how powerful guardian to drown a whole army and Reed's because it's real because you can't explain it don't mean it's real hallelujah well how many of y'all know y'all got a heart have you ever seen it but the doctors say you got one what about your kidney you ain't never seen your kidney oh you're long what you say you got woman well how do you know it because of the functions hallelujah you saw how visit how do you know is a God I know it's one because there are times I wanted to wake up and I couldn't wake up hallelujah and when you see a man who's been delivered from strokes and cancer and all that kind of stuff there's got to be a god somewhere the darkness couldn't do it the medicine didn't do it God did it hallelujah come through a broken home like I did right with trouble everywhere all kinds of stuff going on and yet I'm in my right mind hallelujah oh you got to understand how the Louie that's nobody but Jesus I thought for years that I had to change myself you know you you look at people and you think well I gotta quit this and I gotta quit this and I gotta quit this and I gotta quit this and you know right I tried all that quitting and I couldn't been do it hmm I was one of those Hollywood swingers only I was in South Carolina haha yeah but you see I couldn't stop God had to quit God had to come and take it out of me hallelujah see I couldn't do it and I didn't understand it my mom tried to tell me all about it but I didn't understand that cuz I saw her leave such a righteous and holy life I thought my girl was doing it but she didn't she didn't have to do it she's like this if you an alcoholic you know what God does when he heals you and delivers you he takes the taste out of it he literally take your desire away from you there's no more temptation after God delivers you hallelujah is that okay now you say what brother what are you where you going with this I'm trying to get everybody here to see that your your purpose got to be fulfilled you will not leave out of here without fulfilling God's purpose can I explain this to you Isaiah says a virgin shall conceive everybody thought he was crazy you know they did this prophet is crazy and that's what God would do he'll cause a Christian to look crazy in the eyes of men while you do what you do you got an old friend of mine she says you just feel in bondage you don't do nothing I said I'm not in bondage I'm free I don't do things because I don't want to do things there ain't nobody here have I ever tried to make y'all do anything do I have a law rule over you absolutely not the rule over you is the Holy Spirit and you know people think well you you ain't bondage you can't do this and you can't do that let me say it like this now when I was a pig I love slop I couldn't help it I just love slop when I had a pig nature right but when God changed that pig nature to a dub nature I had I did not want anything to do with slop is that right even when I'm going down down 80 and I smell those pigs it makes me sick but there is a time I just love the smell of peace y'all understand me what I'm saying is it's the nature change that God brings in you you do not do it but if you allow God you said O Lord I really want to change I really want you into my heart I really want to see what I see in this I could tell you things I've seen God create things and I know I'm not the only one hallelujah I've had God tell me listen you've been praying and you said you won't I'm gonna send you some money huh huh and I'm not talking about income tax either right and he did people look at me crazy he's my father it's a paradox I asked God for $50,000 one time he gave it to me and I didn't steal it you understand me now I'm trying to tell you when you can have a relationship with God so well it meant he'd be just like your mom and your daddy like I tell you here he's your Lord and he'll Savior but how many of you know him as a friend and the Bible said a friends takes closer than a brother I know him as a friend my mom wasn't just a mother she was a friend so let me hurry I'm almost done I just cut it short can I read this one sounds 139 7 224 where the shall I go from die spirit a whether shall I flee from that presence anybody knows if I could if our sin up in the heaven thou art there if I made my bed in hell behold thou art there if I take two wings of two wings of the morning and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea even there shall I hand lead me in thy right hand shall hold me you know how people say well I'm I'm gonna be a monk I'm gonna go out there in the wilderness I'm gonna build me something out there and I'm gonna live amen and ain't nothin gonna bother me that's nonsense you gonna bother you if you can leave you somewhere you'll be okay but you gonna bother you because the problem is not people as you and making sense even there shall thy hand leave me in thy right hand shall not hope shall hold me if I say sure the darkness shall cover me even the night shall be light about me yeah the darkness heart is not dying from me from thee but the right the night shyness as the day the darkness and the light are both alight to thee and I'm you know look my point is there's no way from the hide from God you came hi and how many y'all can actually say like I can say God chased me when I didn't even want to serve God he chased me hmm he found me and I'm glad he did my life was so miserable I'm a close on this thought my life was so miserable I had a gun to my head I tried to pull it it wouldn't go off I shift hands and I tried to pull it and it wouldn't go off that's how miserable I was when I was a sinner I knew I couldn't change myself I hated myself I wanted to get rid of myself matter of fact when the gun didn't go off I just I just cried and screamed regard us as God I said you won't let me kill kill myself save me I'll do something I said the right words one thing I know about him I know about the Lord is that the Lord his faithful people don't understand what my joy come from but my joy comes from him I have no other joy outside of Jesus Christ and I know one thing for certain I try to help people I'd say listen everyone a friend of mine we were there at the restaurant the other day and I was trying to talk to this lady and she was just ignoring me and I was just talking to this lady and I didn't get no attitude you know because you don't know what people going through you know you don't know where they come from what they going through you just you don't know but I'm commissioned to start to share the love of God wherever I go and I enjoy doing it I don't care if a person don't like me I gotta love them and all of us let's do that you know right so let me let me let me stop I y'all know what I'm doing do y'all understand we're looking at time that if if God don't intervene in not just people here everywhere there's there's a there's a there's a great thing moving in our country and and people don't even see it you know the same kind of spirit Amen the Jews and the Germans had to deal with we got that same spirit here this is all oh he's dead no spirits don't die people may die but spirits do not die and right now the whole world is under the spirit of destruction because God said it would be so hallelujah I read somebody sent me something the other nation but nobody knows where the pyramid come from it they say they know he said they're wrong I'm like ya know somebody knows cuz you don't know that don't mean somebody else don't know because everybody in people ain't put it all in the paper there's where it comes from what good will it do for you to know where it come from I can tell you where it come from God and God gave whoever the intelligence to do it now you know people wanna make it spooky oh these aliens came from another planet y'all get up ya see people that's what Hollywood did to us Hollywood made us believe such stuff is that look at Egypt the way they believed in all kinds of gosselin right now you have to dig about a two mile journey down in the dust affine where Pharaoh said great card of Egypt you see what I'm saying people are wake up it meant that it's the devil that makes a lie this Bible is right everything the Bible has prophesied has come to pass and the things that has not come to pass is on its way there will be a people that will take a rapture well the rap chain in the Bible that were they in about well if you don't see it it's called translation it's in the Bible what we'll see that's how crazy it was in those day here it was in a scientific age this man Noah building a boat on the rock only on the mountain Santa's gonna reign and he was a spectacle Christians become spectacles why because we believe this we went we don't take the modern virgin why because the Bible said if you add and take away from right and that new eat that new revised versions got eat got whole scripture how out of it God don't do that it is the working of the devil your soul order me let me tell you something if this King James birth version brought back the pronto revival with King James and Luther and wish me and all of the pillar all those people the same King James Version don't you know a recipe it really remains the same produces the same out works it's when we change the recipe am I making sense I a thirst for solo I thirst for people i hunger anything because I know the way I used to be and the way I am now I know my purpose I had the devil come to me straight offer me money and fame I told him no even in the Christian Church he come to me I can give you this did I says no and one thing I said to him I said if I can keep my standard if I can keep this then I'll do what you want but you see he know I can't keep this and do what he want me to do oooh and you should hold Brotherhood say you sick maybe I am but I'll tell you one thing there's a purpose for every one of us you're coming here you're being here we're glad you here but my point is this you see what as long as I stand up like I said the other night I'm trying to close folks as long as I stand up you know I don't get wrinkles but once I sit down I can get wrinkles and the longer you sit down you're strong with the wrinkles become right and God says my bride will be but without spot wrinkle or blemish right you cannot sit down on God in this day and expect to see a rapture in closing everybody to think all Christians going in the rapture and they're not the Bible says fire were wise and fire was foolish there are foolish four versions they are virgins because and they called virgins because they are Christians they will have to go through the Great Tribulation because they didn't get not get enough oil in their lamp and all mean that all means not only just power but it means virtue after your virtue knowledge temperance patience all of these things must go up they then become a stat a perfect statue of Christ before this world in before this nation is the storm whew knighted States it's not in the Bible yes they are revelations 13 that's where she is the little lamb came up like that became a dragon and all of us know that we're talking like dragon we're ruling everybody now we used to be a Christian nation we're no longer a Christian nation we're all in this book every one of our lives are in that book you are either a vessel of Honor or vessel of dishonor but I'll say this by God's grace God always give the man a chance there not be one person lost or inhale that can say God you didn't tell me a God you didn't warn me he warns and tells everybody and you know so everything is in our hands I know it's just I tried to put a lot of little thoughts in your mind in this message I can't hit everything but I tried to show you by God's grace that you are here for a purpose this book is the answer I'm telling you everything that you need to know about yourself and everybody else is in the air why some Christians act the way they do isn't here why Christians some are real Christians and some are not it's in here mm-hmm right you know oh if you got a bad preacher he's in here if he got a good one he's in here and that's why people get thrown off with Christianity say well if that's death that's being a Christian that that's the way Christians I I don't want to be that but I didn't a real Christian that's not a real Christian can y'all can anybody tell how many of y'all know the difference between a lamb and a goat they don't both got look look like they got wool or something going on right but there's a major difference between goat and a lamb that's the difference between Christians some are goats in summer lambs is that bad to say but it's true what does brother Brooks here for what am I here for why do I preach about the Holy Ghost why do I preach about being a born again why do I try to tell everybody sell your soul out to Jesus Christ that sounds bad right but my point is if you don't sell it out to Jesus you can only sell it out to something why because we have been created to worship if you don't worship God you're gonna worship devil if you don't want you to devil you're gonna worship yourself or if you don't worship something yourself you're gonna worship your boyfriend or your girlfriend you gonna worship something because you can't help it you've been designed that way and so I look at everybody and I say to you today this world is falling apart find your purpose find out what God wants you to do I can't tell but God can tell you but he can't use you until you reach surrender your life to Him we go everywhere I've been into every church there is I was raised a Baptist from Baptist I went to the Catholic from the Catholic I went to the Methodist from the method as I went to the Pentecostal and I'm like Lord where are you and cos it I'm in my word that's where I'm at I found God in his word my wife will tell you I saw I've seen things that anyway I'm almost afraid to say because sometimes people think I'm out of my mind or trying to boast I'm not trying to boast if I'm boasting it's boasting on the Lord Jesus how can you make men know he's real in a world of unbelief that's tan when we see the coming of the Lord how many I really believe that our nation is gonna continue to stand the way of standing not according to this 5:11 we've been saved for a long time God has kept this nation in spite of her turning her back on him this nation has turned their back on God and you know we see how God has been rejected out of out of schools out of the political realm out of families I mean you go to you go and you can say to people you know God is so good to me and they won't have a problem with that but when you say oh the Lord Jesus it's been good to me they have problem with that I've seen Christians you know who talked they've talking to me and then then all of a sudden somebody come near and and all of a sudden II get quiet what is that that's shame why are you shaking what made you turn your volume down you don't want nobody to know you're Christian and you're talking about Jesus you don't turn your volume down of anything you turn it up right you know we've got a lot to learn and I say these things I talk kind of like as a family tonight because I really want you all to see by God's grace there is a purpose it's in this book did Jesus find his purpose where did he find it the Bible said in the scripture he found himself in the scripture and that's exactly what you're gonna find yourself in order for you to know who you are and what you come to do now you might just be a janitor but be a Christian janitor right you might be and don't keep a beard Christian doorkeeper whatever but the purpose in here if you just been designed or God has placed in your mind I tell you the truth you know being a preacher's hard being a pastor is harder right we raised eight children and then you got a church who's who you're trying to get them to see this not an organization this is not a denomination we are now called the body of Christ and every one of us has a function thank you for the amen brother you know it's just it's just a reality that you and I must know that you did not come here to occupy a seat you didn't come here amen to stare in my face that's not why God sent you here we have come in this place to represent Christ as a body and to let God people all the world everywhere know that he's real to declare that Jesus Christ is alive and well amen amen let us pray father God we come before your Lord as humbly as we know how and you thank you for your grace we thank you for your mercy in your love father without you we're nothing we we believe in you we trust in you we have nothing of our own everything that we have you gave it to us we just don't borrow time as they say but Lord while we journey we want to make every moment count we give our heart our minds and our souls to you lord we know father God that you look beyond our folks and you're always seeing our needs you're the high priest that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities a lot could be said tonight Lord but I trust that these little nuggets that you've led me to say Oh God will benefit in the long run down the road Lord I trust that people began to see it's not a group it's about a vigilant near Savior help us dear Jesus to push and to move forward calls us to look more to you we are needy people and we need you every hour of the day lord I know what some are thinking tonight but it's okay Lord we are here to please you so let your will be done father bless us keep us in God is Lord in Jesus Christ's name we pray there are I mean not new here are some places there are and not go but this with my god is real I can feel him in my soul yes God he's willing my soul my God is real boy he made me whole he loved me it's better thank you God my god is real so I can feel him in my soul some folks may down some folks may spawn all can desert and leave me alone but as for me I'm gonna take God's part my god is real him in my heart oh he's real in my soul my God is real for he and wash and made me hold me it's better than you gold my god is real I can feel him in my soul let me see now yes God is real he's real in my soul my god yeve is just like you gold my God is real oh I can feel him in my soul I can't [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] can you feel them in your soul a many love the Lord I hope hearts are satisfied if I said anything it's questionable to you all anyone you're more than welcome to ask I'll be glad to talk tell you I don't know I find out I'm not saying I know everything but I do know where I could find the answers we thank God for what God has done in this day because had not God done what he did we wouldn't know what we know and then we're just echoes of Elijah and we thank God for that we appreciate whatever what God is doing we pray that everybody was blessed ah we have our guest and I trusted I was plain enough if I wasn't and you can always ask and I can always show you in the scripture because I believe this is the absolute is it a urine 'la theorem of every prophet right if this doesn't ring out it's not true that's have a word of Prayer would be dismissed father God we come before you we thank you for your grace we thank you for your mercy Lord we thank you for being so good to us you have been better to us than we have been to ourselves father this book is a book of mysteries is the paradox a man that throughout all the ages this book is still able to survive and in this last day you are now writing your word on the hearts of men we have become living epistles written and read of all men help us now dear Jesus that we were able to ever lift you up you're the source of our strength you are helped in our present time in a time of need you are our source of life and as we travel our God to our different destinies our journeys we pray father God that you would just be merciful or keep us safe but without any hurt harm or danger coming to us and we'll be careful to give you the praise the glory and honor and Jesus Christ name we pray amen we're dismissed him [Music] [Music]
