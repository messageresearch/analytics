[47:20] the holy spirit of promise that
[47:35] of our salvation of our inheritance
[47:39] until the redemption of the purchased
[47:40] possession unto the praise
[47:43] of his glory
[47:50] jesus amen now the word use is here for
[47:53] earnest
[47:56] a greek word that simply means a down
[47:59] payment or a pledge
[48:03] now let's turn to second corinthians
[48:05] chapter one
[48:08] verse 21.
[48:10] i'll see you in the 1 21.

[48:40] saluting
[48:42] christ
[48:44] who have also sealed us
[48:50] and given the earnest
[48:52] of the spirit in our hearts
[48:57] now the word that paul uses here for
[49:00] earnest paul
[49:02] uh same english word
[49:06] earnest and earnest um
[49:09] but the first one means
[49:12] a down payment or a pledge
[49:26] with the necessary powers for its
[49:29] administration
[49:31] necessary
[49:33] amen let's pray together for the word
[49:36] lord jesus
[49:37] we stand here in the need of prayer
[49:41] god we need you now more than we've ever
[49:43] needed you lord
[49:46] forgive us oh god our father
[49:49] any of the old sins and things that we
[49:51] might have done
[49:54] the wrongs that may stand before us
[50:01] we might either make them right or be
[50:03] cleansed of them all together
[50:07] and sanctify the lips that speak tonight
[50:24] the prophets have spoken
[50:27] and received from thy words
[50:32] the true anointing
[50:35] will bring us into the revelation
[50:50] in the name of jesus christ
[50:52] amen and amen amen amen and the church
[50:55] said
[50:56] amen and praise the lord you may be
[50:58] truthful
[50:59] amen do you love the lord again
[51:02] amen we should have said that a little
[51:04] bit louder do you love the lord
[51:20] i like how brother brooks had prayed
[51:22] over the musicians
[51:26] i liked something he said a moment ago
[51:28] not even an angel in heaven
[51:32] but it's all about jesus
[51:46] that my friends is the purpose of the
[51:48] message
[52:00] the purpose of translation
[52:16] that is
[52:34] [Music]
[52:44] he lives inside of my heart
[52:46] and i want to tell you something
[52:49] what i want to speak tonight
[52:52] just a little bit
[52:55] i think we're living in a time
[53:26] and if you think about this
[53:28] the prophet went off the scene in 1965
[53:34] he died in his 50s
[53:37] and right now
[53:39] the message has lived longer than
[53:41] brother branham lived on this earth
[53:46] we know that at the last day
[53:50] there will be an acceleration of growth
[54:06] seemingly nothing will be happening
[54:36] didn't come
[54:50] came
[55:04] everything
[55:16] the creation of what it was
[56:01] on in the coming days
[56:04] if god created me
[56:07] to be an overcomer
[56:10] then the things that i'll have to
[56:12] overcome
[56:42] many of these
[57:24] today you died
[57:38] that was laying in the original seed god
[57:40] almighty
[57:44] flesh throughout him
[57:47] remember he could not be a savior
[57:51] until something was lost
[58:12] [Music]
[58:21] to the negative side
[58:24] negative that's why everything in your
[58:27] life
[58:29] that comes in the negative side
[58:33] it was designed by the creator
[58:37] of purpose
[58:39] it was part of your equipment
[58:43] i want you to think
[58:46] six thousand years has come similar
[59:02] humanity
[59:05] it has fallen down through all the races
[59:10] all of the generations
[59:12] colors and creeds
[59:16] from
[1:00:11] foreign
[1:00:13] [Music]
[1:00:18] that's why they'll shake your hand when
[1:00:20] this is over with well
[1:00:22] you come out of ladies
[1:00:25] what a great thing it'll be obviously
[1:00:54] even the battery
[1:00:56] is designed with a positive header
[1:00:58] negative
[1:01:02] we was coming over the hill over here
[1:01:06] sam pulled up in front of this fine bmw
[1:01:22] i know
[1:01:33] i don't care what it looks like on the
[1:01:35] outside
[1:01:50] i want you to think
[1:02:03] he had to create something
[1:03:29] exactly
[1:03:31] everything hiding in god
[1:03:34] listen to me now
[1:03:37] he did not make the devil equal in
[1:03:39] creation
[1:03:42] but
[1:04:05] [Music]
[1:04:11] is a perfect balance
[1:04:13] [Music]
[1:04:14] balance you know what a scale looks like
[1:04:19] the balance you put some uh nuggets or
[1:04:21] gold or something in one side
[1:04:37] well the prophet said the devil on the
[1:04:39] prophet
[1:04:41] balance of god so to speak eating
[1:04:43] balance
[1:04:46] all right now listen
[1:04:48] god deposited the devil the negative
[1:04:52] now let's come to you romans chapter 7.
[1:04:56] paul said i found the law
[1:04:59] and that law was within me
[1:05:05] evil is
[1:05:19] so the evil that was built into you
[1:05:23] it's a perfect balance
[1:05:25] perfection of the good that is placed in
[1:05:27] you as well
[1:05:30] was designed
[1:05:33] to express how you who
[1:05:42] [Music]
[1:05:44] hey man am i preaching that fast are you
[1:05:45] translating that slow which one amen
[1:05:48] hallelujah and hallelujah
[1:05:50] amen now if i get too quick on you just
[1:05:52] just just put put your hand on me and
[1:05:54] slow down but listen pentecost happening
[1:05:56] amen amen it's happened and i don't know
[1:05:59] how to pull it back hallelujah amen now
[1:06:02] now here's what i want to show you
[1:06:06] the word earnest money here means
[1:06:09] a down payment
[1:06:12] you're baptism of the holy ghost
[1:06:15] paul said after you trusted me
[1:06:20] and after you heard the word of truth
[1:06:24] after you believe
[1:06:27] you were then sealed with the holy
[1:06:28] spirit of promise
[1:06:44] yes i believe
[1:07:07] but god does not believe your testimony
[1:07:12] until he
[1:07:25] it's not when you receive the holy ghost
[1:07:30] that is when the holy ghost
[1:07:35] amen not when i receive it
[1:07:38] and he receives me
[1:07:48] [Music]
[1:07:53] oh glory to god i believe the messenger
[1:07:56] they don't a bit more believe this
[1:07:58] message not in the world
[1:08:00] [Music]
[1:08:02] do you know how we know
[1:08:04] because if they truly believed it
[1:08:07] god would confirm that you confirm
[1:08:10] he would confirm their faith
[1:08:12] i've given them the holy ghost
[1:08:15] oh people can say all kinds of things
[1:08:18] people believe in the easter bunny this
[1:08:20] is not quite uh the easter bunny but
[1:08:35] your cookies and your milk and wait up
[1:08:49] declares that jesus
[1:09:34] if i said to my brother i'm going to
[1:09:35] give you 50 after church
[1:09:39] i shake his hand he said god bless you
[1:09:41] thank you for that
[1:09:44] i'm pleasing myself to my brother
[1:10:00] i am pledging to you
[1:10:05] you are my child
[1:10:07] you are my son
[1:10:09] you are my daughter is that my feelings
[1:10:11] and i will be responsible for you
[1:10:14] responsible
[1:10:28] and he took that veil and laid it across
[1:10:30] his shoulders
[1:10:36] oh
[1:10:37] that you are oh
[1:10:39] it's now my responsibility
[1:11:51] all the things that are in store for you
[1:11:53] and i do this
[1:11:56] only we could grab a hold of it
[1:12:00] notice the words paul uses here
[1:12:04] and whom also you trusted uh
[1:12:33] the one thing you'll find about people
[1:12:37] all of them are wanting to do some kind
[1:12:38] of creative work
[1:12:42] praise the dead
[1:12:45] i wish they'd just learned to raise
[1:12:46] their hands in church
[1:12:48] just
[1:13:09] [Music]
[1:13:16] miracles
[1:13:30] they'll trust
[1:13:42] when they're on the mountain
[1:13:58] for
[1:13:59] [Music]
[1:14:04] yes jesus loves me this high now
[1:14:07] remember
[1:14:08] now listen in the book of corinthians
[1:14:10] there they don't live
[1:14:12] now paul is not going to say something
[1:14:14] different
[1:14:17] but now he's walking to another side of
[1:14:19] the mountain
[1:14:22] and paul is looking at a different side
[1:14:25] of the mountain now regardless
[1:14:40] and it tells us that the earnest
[1:14:44] is the anointing
[1:14:46] now here's where it's going to get a
[1:14:48] little sticky for us
[1:14:50] i believe that people have misunderstood
[1:14:53] what is the true anointing
[1:15:10] you can feel the anointing
[1:15:12] feel the holy ghost
[1:15:14] you can feel the power of god moving in
[1:15:15] your life
[1:15:17] but that's only the rain
[1:15:20] and that rain falls on the just in the
[1:15:22] unjust
[1:15:36] the rain will
[1:15:50] of what you really are this proof of
[1:15:52] that exactly comes from the seed life
[1:15:55] yeah
[1:15:57] by the holy ghost
[1:16:01] i run into people around the country
[1:16:04] their idea
[1:16:20] i believe in a lot of these things that
[1:16:22] we see
[1:16:25] but not only here but around the world
[1:16:27] never where this may go
[1:16:30] i want to make this remark
[1:16:46] is
[1:17:25] [Music]
[1:17:30] the anointing is what gave me the
[1:17:32] ability
[1:17:34] to capacity to live right in a world
[1:17:37] that refuses to live godly the vivoc
[1:18:09] oh hallelujah hallelujah
[1:18:12] and as it drinks more than his portion
[1:18:17] it begins to press out
[1:18:21] david said i'm like a tree
[1:18:59] [Music]
[1:19:20] is
[1:19:34] jesus was
[1:20:02] [Music]
[1:20:15] it was about the design of what the seed
[1:20:18] was in the beginning
[1:20:23] if it was a tear since
[1:20:26] no matter how much water it took
[1:20:28] everything
[1:20:35] [Applause]
[1:20:44] the more conventions
[1:20:56] she is the true seed of god
[1:21:11] the rain only brings you to the maturity
[1:21:23] in other words the foolish virgin can
[1:21:25] sit right here
[1:21:40] i don't believe that
[1:21:42] well that's all right you believe what
[1:21:44] you want to do
[1:21:46] but i believe there's a group sitting in
[1:21:47] the message
[1:21:50] foolish virgin type people
[1:21:54] come
[1:21:54] on
[1:22:01] well if i can't make it as bright i'll
[1:22:03] just be foolish version
[1:22:07] i'm sorry but you don't even qualify
[1:22:15] you just told me you didn't believe in
[1:22:16] the holy ghost
[1:22:18] the foolish virgin could you be that
[1:22:20] when they cry for it day and night
[1:22:32] the rain will bring you to that place
[1:22:35] [Music]
[1:23:02] they'll even hint that this is the
[1:23:03] bride's revival
[1:23:17] but brother the bride's revival
[1:23:21] and the true anointing
[1:23:23] is nothing more and nothing less than a
[1:23:26] relationship with jesus christ
[1:23:32] i don't need a certain man to lay his
[1:23:34] hands on me to get it
[1:23:35] done
[1:23:38] convention preacher to get me there
[1:23:46] we run from
[1:24:23] my head watch out i get too happy shake
[1:24:25] my head amen and all of that holy ghost
[1:24:28] just starts pouring out
[1:24:31] amen i learned a long time ago shake the
[1:24:33] ketchup bottle you want to get something
[1:24:34] out of it amen
[1:24:37] amen
[1:24:38] and hallelujah
[1:24:40] amen
[1:24:42] the holy ghost is an anointing
[1:24:48] that holds you when you don't feel holy
[1:24:50] ghost
[1:24:50] [Music]
[1:24:52] when there's nothing to be joyous
[1:24:55] yeah
[1:25:11] amen amen
[1:25:13] it was the thing that equipped jesus
[1:25:17] with the necessary powers
[1:25:21] for his administration
[1:25:24] in other words it was a down payment
[1:25:28] god gave to us
[1:25:31] what we needed to get us out of here
[1:25:35] that's why hungry little seeds of god
[1:25:37] are always crying for more well
[1:25:41] you listen to me
[1:25:44] you are only going to get what god what
[1:25:46] you need to get you out of here
[1:26:05] [Music]
[1:26:16] i may not understand all of the
[1:26:18] mysteries of god
[1:26:33] get me out of here
[1:26:45] in other words if you had a water bottle
[1:26:47] up here for example
[1:26:56] when we say that we mean the water come
[1:26:58] from the bottle into something else
[1:27:17] we know that it was not just a down
[1:27:19] payment for him
[1:27:22] because he received the full inheritance
[1:27:30] with
[1:27:45] because he has anointed me
[1:27:49] to preach the gospel to the poor
[1:27:53] you see that's one of the problems some
[1:27:55] of the problems some of our big message
[1:27:56] preachers have got today
[1:28:26] easy
[1:28:28] the spirit of god was on him
[1:28:34] yes the spirit was on him
[1:28:37] but it wasn't the spirit that fell on
[1:28:39] him that kept him right
[1:29:06] the equipping and the furnishings
[1:29:22] could have saw where peter cut that ear
[1:29:24] off
[1:29:27] crucified him next to jesus
[1:29:30] but when jesus put that ear back on
[1:29:37] amen that's what him said when i forgive
[1:29:38] you of your sins
[1:29:41] i forgive you as though you never died
[1:29:43] in the first place
[1:29:46] not even a scar left over
[1:29:49] right the anointing
[1:29:51] now jesus uses our apartment luke uses a
[1:29:54] word here
[1:29:56] the word
[1:29:58] in the greek the
[1:30:00] okay
[1:30:01] and this particular word
[1:30:04] is where the true anointing
[1:30:09] falls upon a person
[1:30:12] it is the same word that paul uses for
[1:30:15] earnest
[1:30:31] god gave him all the equipment he needed
[1:30:37] to listen to the job that he had to do
[1:30:40] while he was here
[1:30:44] you're sitting here thinking to yourself
[1:31:04] hey man she's always going to be short
[1:31:08] you know her and i have never seen eye
[1:31:10] to eye
[1:31:11] [Laughter]
[1:31:13] hallelujah i'm tall and she ate
[1:31:16] once again amen but in every part of our
[1:31:19] mind
[1:31:22] we think we'll never achieve what we're
[1:31:24] supposed to do
[1:31:27] i've got one question for
[1:31:51] the prophet said it this way
[1:31:54] i am called to preach
[1:32:22] it's the same as moses was
[1:32:34] but the prophet said he hadn't activated
[1:32:37] that faith
[1:33:01] [Music]
[1:33:18] god put that seed of life in this flesh
[1:33:20] right here
[1:33:30] my genetics were not designed to have
[1:33:32] that seed life inside my bloodstream
[1:34:04] but it needed to be activated
[1:34:07] the potentials for what i would be was
[1:34:09] already there
[1:34:12] to be activated
[1:34:14] and that might be the reason some people
[1:34:16] have never come to that place just yet
[1:34:27] it activates that part of you
[1:34:30] actively
[1:34:41] and the anointing is not just something
[1:34:43] i feel
[1:34:58] the resurrection
[1:35:12] they didn't have equipment they had no
[1:35:14] true anointing
[1:35:17] a little witch run around these men are
[1:35:18] men of god these men are men of god
[1:35:21] paul said i rebuke you satan
[1:35:27] this little lady ran around saying these
[1:35:29] men are men of god these men are men of
[1:35:31] god
[1:35:34] she wasn't lying
[1:35:37] she wasn't telling a false
[1:35:40] but she had no
[1:35:53] oh that's a spiritual brother over there
[1:36:02] that's why some people can sit in the
[1:36:03] very same service and shout the glory of
[1:36:05] god
[1:36:21] no equipment on the inside listen
[1:36:23] another scripture
[1:36:25] in saint john chapter 2 verse 19.
[1:36:30] jesus said destroy this temple
[1:36:34] in three days i will raise it up again
[1:36:50] i don't believe that
[1:36:53] but look at the way that he said in the
[1:36:55] uh in his uh
[1:36:57] uh uh his face-to-face confrontation
[1:36:59] with what was it was it martha i think
[1:37:01] maybe when he come to lazarus tomb is
[1:37:03] martha wasn't it
[1:37:18] didn't even
[1:37:32] maybe the situation
[1:37:44] because some people's heads are so hard
[1:38:54] look around me how bad everything is
[1:39:09] to activate that word
[1:39:13] that even though that cold lifeless form
[1:39:15] was laying in the ground the mcc laying
[1:39:17] in the grave
[1:39:21] equipment to call it back up
