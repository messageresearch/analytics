15th chapter and we're going to read the 50 uh 5th verse here Paul is talking he says oh death where is thy sting oh grave where is thy Victory The Sting of death is sin and the strength of sin is the law but thanks be to God which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ now I love that because he gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ 58th verse therefore my beloved Brethren be ye steadfast unmovable always abounding in the work of the Lord amen for as much as ye know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord I'm going to read that again therefore my beloved Brethren be ye steadfast unmovable always abounding in the work of the Lord amen for as much as you know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord let us have a word of prayer gracious Heavenly Father God God we come before you Lord as humbly as we know how we thank you for your Amazing Grace we thank you for your cleansing power Lord and father I pray this morning that you have free course here Lord cleanse us from everything thought deed action word Lord whatever we may have said or done that is not been pleasing in our sight let your Holy Spirit wash and cleanse us this morning let the water of the word Lord wash us clean oh God be merciful to your people here this morning let your anointing rain down on us father let your shikina glory come down once again and we'll be careful to give you the praise the glory and the honor Lord in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated we like to entitle uh this message and this is what I believe the Lord has placed to my heart because he said when we see that day approaching we ought to not only come together the more but we ought to encourage one another am amen so I trust this morning the message will be one that will encourage you uh but I will try my best to get completely out of his way so that he will speak to you this morning now we living in the last days and I want to entitle this message The Immortal Caesar The Immortal season if that would be a a a subtopic things that are to be we are living in a Time by the grace of God that God encourages us to be sober amen 1 Peter 58 says be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil as a roaring lion walketh about seeking whom he may div now we want you to understand what soberness is about it means to be calm is that all right and collective in spirit you're not full of anxieties and you're not allowing Satan to stir you up so much till you are drunken amen but it's to be sober that means to be aware of your surroundings also to Be watchful to know what's uh before you what's present with you and what's behind you amen is that right now the Bible says forgetting those things that are behind so if you are forgetting the things that you did yesterday especially all of the wrong things amen you will be kept in a sober state but if you allowing what yesterday brought to you to remain in your spirit you're not sober amen amen you're allowing Satan to make you drunk right with the cares and the things of this world Amen now I want you to realize amen here by the grace of God uh St John 5:24 says verily verily I say unto you he that heareth my word and believeth right let's turn to that scripture quickly St John I told you to turn and we never did read it but let's let's go there now St John 5 and 24 verily verily I say unto you he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and shall come not come into condemnation now how many of y'all believe that amen but is passed from Death unto life in other words you cannot die anymore amen you're already dead and it's now Christ that lives in you the thing that I like about First Corinthians and when Paul is talking he's basically laughing in the face of death because Paul realized that he cannot die Paul understand amen that he has he's died to himself and he's now living amen unto God Paul which I love made a statement he said it's not I that live but Christ that lives in me now we're living in a wonderful time even though it's a hard time amen is it a time where Satan amen knows he has a short time and so therefore he's doing everything he can do to discourage you am I by myself now we want you to understand that when you were born you were born a weak man you were born of failure according to the scriptures uh uh 1 Corinthians 15:43 it says Paul is uh reading he said it is sown in dishonor it is raised in glory huj it is sown in weakness it is raised in power Hallelujah so I don't know about you I I was talking amen with brother Randy last night and that's my expected End Amen that when it's all over I'll Stand even as he stands now I want you to want you to realize amen uh according to things that are to be amen we realize amen there's one thing that Jesus asked the father is that all right amen he said amen he goes on to say Jesus only has one thing in his prayer to the father and you know what that was one thing after all of his sacrifice that he did here on Earth the light that he lived the path that he walked he asked one thing that's where I am they may be also he asked for our fellowship now I don't know about you but if he wants my fellowship I want to give it to him amen he said if you abide in me and my word abide you you could ask whatsoever you will and it shall be given so if he died and he desire our fellowship so much CU remember I told you amen when When sin came into effect it did not destroy the relationship it broke the fellowship with God because a true son has always been a true son and always will be amen a true son Hallelujah now you and I when we were Sinners we had the the the appearance of of of of of the of the tear is that right we look like a cerer come on somebody but on the inside of the inside amen was a wheat germ of God hallelujah and it took the anointing of God Amen to strike that seed and bring us to life amen now it just didn't bring us to life but the Bible tells us amen according to acts 1 and8 but ye shall receive power after the Holy Ghost has come upon you and ye shall be Witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem in all of Judea and in Samaria and unto the utmost parts of the earth amen amen so we we realize by the grace of God Amen that we're approaching a season of immortality amen amen that's why Satan is so angry now he realize amen because see Satan is a Believer even if you don't believe hallelujah amen even the demons believe even if you don't believe is that right amen the weakest sinner amen we the we excuse me the weakest Saint make a demon or demons tremble amen come on somebody amen amen hallelujah so we realiz Amen in the sign of his coming it says in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God Amen and the Word was made flesh dwelt Among Us right here Among Us the word of God the spoken seed from the very Garden of Eden when every seed shall bring forth of its kind somebody ought to shout here this morning if you believe that you're a true seed of God the Bible has already ready declared you're going to bring forth of your kind hallelujah it's not dependent upon what you say what you think or how you feel is what God has declared in his word hallelujah that's right when Eve got perverted and listened to the LIE of the devil and took a wrong seed in the womb of her soul to believe one word Twisted you don't want to twist any word of God see just what the Bible says the Bible says no prophecy of any private interpretation why the prophet was given given by the prophets excuse me the prophecy was given by the prophets and the word of the Lord came to the prophets they interpret it just the way it was so there's no argument with it then in Revelation 21 we find out amen uh uh 22 I believe he says what or whosoever shall take away or add to the Prophecies of this book so it is absolutely God's word and the world will be Jud J by this word am so we don't want to twist it we don't want to make it say anything more or anything less just say it just the way it is and believe it like that he said I found out that it'll produce just exactly because every seed shall bring forth of its kind I believe it all of my heart it is not the seed that determines the time of the period of germination amen amen hallelujah that seed can lay there a long while before the Son of God strikes it amen but when the sun strike the seed it has to bring forth of its kind Hallelujah a watermelon will never bring forth a orange or tamarine if it's a watermelon seed it'll bring forth watermelon amen GL amen hallelujah don't be discouraged second Peter 3 and three let us begin reading there knowing this first that there shall come in the last days scoffers walking after their own lust and saying there where is the promise of his coming for since the fathers fell asleep all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation for this they willingly are ignorant of that by the word of God the heavens were of old and the Earth standing out of the water and in the water whereby the world that then was being overflowed with water perished hello anybody know what he's talking about Hallelujah talking about the time when Noah preached 120 years come on somebody amen even scientists they have discovered all over the world there's proof there was a flood and even if they couldn't find no no proof the Bible said it wasall Hallelujah come on somebody it's nothing but the truth scientists want to say we come from some caveman or something like that and you know what they know they know that the technology and Egypt and all of these places they have found and not Technologies these are H great monuments of the Spinx and the pyramids and you know that are found in almost every portion of the world and they want to say the caveman built it what they don't want to recognize is that the intelligence of those people were far more advanced than what we we we have today but if they would look close enough they would realize it was something they must have done that caused a cataclysmic problem did I say that right amen they will realize amen man has always caused destruction God don't have to destroy the world man is destroying it by his own scientific reasonings hello somebody you love the Lord am amen listen but the heaven of Earth the heavens and the Earth which are now by the same word are kept in store reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and predition of ungodly men but beloved be not ignorant of this one thing that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day this is my the part I like the Lord is not slack concerning his promises as some men count slackness but is longsuffering to usw not willing that any should perish but that all should come unto repentance amen huh amen God holds back his wrath only because he love us matter of fact the Rapture is overdue Hallelujah come on somebody and whether you realize it or not the Rapture is already on oh my God God already he's already building a people he's already chosen a people he's already building him into the pure true stature of a perfect man is that right Hallelujah all I can tell you to do is get on board amen hallelujah hallelujah Hebrews 10:25 please the Bible tells us according to Hebrews 10:25 see when you see this day approaching he says stay at home and watch television sir uhuh stay at home no go over to the to some restaurant and enjoy a big state no Hebrews 10:25 not forsaking the the assembling of ourselves together as the manner of some is so Paul is saying they were having problems then but exalting one another oh Lord when the devil is trying to tell you that you're not we're here to say that you are amen exalting one another amen So Much More Much the more as ye see the day approaching and see that's the problem there are so many people that are not seeing the day approaching amen hallelujah they're not seeing the coming of the Lord how much longer do you think this world can last well let me put it this way America is on her way down what you going to do when she falls hallu whether you like it or not it's going to happen because it was prophesied but oh brother it can't happen because I've got to get married and I got to get my Master's and doctor's degree and I've got I'm sure in Sodom they were doing the same thing I'm sure in Noah's day they were thinking the same thing Hallelujah God don't care nothing about your future the only thing God cares about is your salvation amen hello somebody you got to get real with this thing there were people over there in the phili phes who have who had future HH uh things that they thought they were going to do the next day goals and achievements and many of them are dead right now am because they could not understand the storm that was coming their way I've cried I've prayed and I you know Lord wherever the saints of God are Lord I pray that you shelter them keep them amen from all of diseases and all of the harm and all of the things that coming by you know you know because I believe God protects the righteous God could not even destroy Sodom amen until God had got the righteous out of there come on somebody he could not even destroy Egypt amen until he got every one of them out of there oh come on somebody you say well he he yes yes yes yes when you see that day approach in amen scientists come on they they coming about and they're telling us uh you know well uh it's not global warming and some say well it is global warming and some saying you know it's it's just it's the satellites they got in their air I can tell you this it's sin that's the reason why everything is falling apart because men don't want to repent they don't want the oldtime gospel they don't want it want uh the the preacher to get into their lives or into their business they just want a preacher to tell them you going to prosper you going to prosper and I'm going tell you something that has been one of the greatest deceptions of this age prosperity it's the thing that has killed the church come on somebody when they were pour and didn't have a change of clothes they knew who their God was Hallelujah but easy living has caused them to forget God just like Israel forgot God and if God spank Israel God will spank America amen now I want you to understand this in the days of Sodom you got to understand and I'm going to go there because I want you to understand how far up the road we are before God could send Malachi 4 the day of Sodom had to come hello so that's in 1963 way before then but 1963 and and all of that and you know in 1956 57 is when America rejected the gospel they chose their organizations and their denomination over the truth come on somebody so if Sodom was back then where is it now it has multiplied seven times worse if the furnace of our day would be heated seven times harder then everything must be Sevenfold yeah Hallelujah Noah's day is Sevenfold lot's day is Sevenfold Egypt's day is Sevenfold we are now living in a Sevenfold age hallelujah hallelujah but God made a bride that was Sevenfold he gave her virtue he gave her knowledge he gave her wisdom he gave her long suffing he's bringing her all the way up and guess what she break through the seventh and embrace the eighth which is the Capstone of God the fill of fire the Holy Ghost she is a Overcomer hallelujah thank you Lord hallelujah why should I worry I've already passed from Death un life amen come on somebody you can't be dead and living too you got to be dead or alive hallelujah amen the only person that can be that way the Bible said If a woman liveth in pleasure she's already dead come on somebody now let me read on testimony of a true witness and the day that we give us a great testimony as a witness of God of creation because that when we are in the season of mortal life raising our children marrying and bringing forth families that is a life or the season of mortal life but when we have been born of above the body returns to the dust from when where it come and the spirit goes down to where it comes from or goes up rather to where it comes from to The God Who gave it and they will come there will come another season hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah you say are you insane maybe I am but Paul is over there under the in the sixth Dimension rest he said there's coming another season Hallelujah there's coming another season I won't stay here hallelujah but that season is approaching pretty fast now and one day this this this this theophany is going to put on a glorified body and our fellowship with my brothers and sisters on the earth now we're we're looking because I'm going to tell you something if you are sealed with the Holy Ghost you already in Mar amen hallelujah you see what brother Brooks you going to die no I cannot die my body might die but not the man on the inside Hallelujah my body might get old it might get crippled but the man inside is a perfect man Hallelujah it can't go old it can't die it'll live forever that's what the word if you believe the word that's what he says hallelujah and that season that will come will be IM be the immortal season and when the Son of God Rises with healing in his wings it'll be totally impossible to hold those body in the ground any longer Hallelujah glory to God Amen it'll be impossible to hold those Hallelujah there come a sweep brother amen there come a sweep and I don't care if you're liing like this amen come a sweep and God will stand you up like a straight man hallelujah amen you'll find the wrinkles disappearing the Bal is gone the the the everything when when God said mortality will be swallowed up by immortality you know what that means that means if somebody burnt you at the Stak and all that that is there is but a few ashes of You When God says come forth I don't care if the North Wind the East Wind South Wind and the West Winds have blown positive your ashes all over the Earth you know what Brother Rich those ashes got to come back together hallelujah oh my God there's not going to be another you it'll be the same you made in the same image amen but in a glorified way Hallelujah you might have been swallowed up by a great fish in the Earth Hallelujah and he may have deposited job remains to the bottom of the ocean but when God say come Hallelujah the oer going to have to give it up Hallelujah it might be mixed in with the mud Hallelujah and all of the seashells Hallelujah but the it has to give it up it's got to give it up hallelujah oh glory to God thank you Lord you know what they tell me that they found the tomb of Joseph I'm so curious how they know it because I'm going tell you something they didn't find his body they must have found inscriptions because when Jesus got up Joseph got up Hallelujah that is that right right when Jesus got up Joseph got up what do you mean the Bible said that when Jesus got up all the graves were open amen and the saints of God walked around the city hallelujah amen so they put on their bodies Hallelujah if they found his tomb it was empty Hallelujah just like when they found Jesus tomb it was empty all of the Old Testament Saints got up Hallelujah glory to God talking about a season in motality that's where the devil trying to keep you from he trying to keep you from that season of IM immortality but let me put it this way he can't stop it Hallelujah come on come on somebody you know when we was in high school we used to say that we can't lose with the stuff we use and that's how it is amen with with this word hallelujah you can't lose because of the St you come on somebody that you're using why do we use it with Standing on the Promises of God yes we are hallelujah amen thank you Lord goes on and this is the wrong season now this is the Mortal season but Immortal season is coming when the immortal one comes he will bring with him the immortal spirits that has returned turn to him from the earth and they shall come forth again in the resurrection for the great Millennium and shall shine in his glory everything on Earth shall give a testimony the sun rising in the East to show the beginning of Life it goes over and sets in the evening of oh come on somebody of the morning the birds wake and sing and they're happy we feel fresh the evening we're we're tired when the sun sets it gives Tes Tony that there is a life and a death a day was born a day is gone a tree lives the leaves drops off God preserves in the roots of the tree woo I'm so glad that he's a root and offspring of David and the life is preserved in The Roots Hallelujah it ain't in me it's in the root is in Jesus Christ himself Hallelujah G to God hallelujah oh my God Amen sometime brother we feel a little dry like it is now the winter time I watch my trees I watch them you know amen some of y'all might not know I got a new tree in my yard and didn't look like it was going to make it cuz the heat was so high but I went over to that tree and I prayed amen I said You shall live and not die Hallelujah let me tell you my tree bloomed in the season it wasn't Theos blew Hallelujah glory to God amen amen it blew not just one time it looked like it did about two or three times I thought to that tree I said come on now the Willer coming you got to go down into your roots I said you can't live and then die I said you got to go into your R I prayed over the tree I said Lord let this tree know it's time to go down not to show off Hal hu the next day I looked at the the blossoms and all had done dropped off the tree and the leaves gone and then I saw my other tree my wife will tell you it must have caught a hold to the blessing I was giv that other tree yes it was flaming it was so beautiful it was so big it never been that big Hallelujah but it must have C the anointing Hal and I said to that tree I said come on now you're looking good but I talk to it like a natural man you know I know if you heard me you think I'm crazy but I know who I am Hallelujah I talk to that tree and I said oh now you got you know it's about time for you to go down to the root right amen a big a storm came and I looked I'm like where in the world all these leaves come from I looked up and there was my treat un shed as Le I said that's it hallelujah amen and so is it amen with a True Believer maybe it's a winter time or a fall time for you and you can't praise him like you used to or like you ought to or like you want to but understand the sap ain't gone it's down in the root it's down in the root and there's coming another spring Hallelujah and I'm looking for that Resurrection Hallelujah I'm looking for that Resurrection Hallelujah is that all right oh Glory the sun is rising in East amen now think about it a tree lives the tree drops off God preserves his roots roots of the tree where life where this life originated where it started at down in the root oh my that went forth and made the leaves for shade come back again to where it comes from only to rest to at another season life in the Little Flower that drops out of the seed returns to somewhere that we know not where but all the pup right goes out of the seed think about it and the seed's not seed rots in the ground but yet there's a life in there that's hid from for a resurrection again come on you can dis dissect any seed you like and you'll never find the life come on somebody amen everything that speaks give testimony now I had the privilege of traveling very much around the world and I've heard different religions I've heard different views I've heard the muhammadans and the Buddhas and The Sheiks and the James and all many hundreds of different views of religion God's goddesses and all those things let me tell you something I don't care what Billy Graham says I don't care what or Robert says I don't care what t t TD TD Jake says and all of these what's the other smiling fell Joel oin let me tell you something none of them are my gods Jesus said there's only one way I could care less what any other op man's opinion is is if it's he says it's only one way there's only one way hello somebody yeah Billy gra even said that Jesus Christ wasn't the only way seeing it heard it on my with my seeing it with my own eyes heard it with my own ears that's right but let me tell you something it doesn't matter he he has his mission Hallelujah come on somebody he did what he's supposed to do now we're here to do what we supposed to do amen hallelujah hallelujah because you got to realize amen when this this season now the focus was on Isaac amen hallelujah it wasn't on ishmail it was on Isaac Abraham's seed come on somebody God now bringing us to a one place and let me tell you something in order for Abraham to show his faithfulness to God he had to die to every desire every ambition everything that he thought was important to him because remember Isaac was uh his extension Isaac was the extension of Abraham's life amen Isaac was Abraham's SE come on y'all understand me it was his extension of his life if he had cut that extension off then when Abraham would die that means Abraham would be forgotten about see that's what the devil thought when he killed Jesus amen when he took Jesus to the Grave he didn't have a mother he did I mean excuse me he didn't have a wife he didn't have children Hallelujah he didn't get married so the devil thought if I could cut him off amen he won't produce his own kind yes he will but what he didn't understand Jesus wasn't a natural man he was a spiritual man the Bible said he was a quickening spirit amen and if he was going to have children they had to be Quicken children amen the word of God according to Isaiah said who shall declare his generation come on somebody I don't want to go there but it's true anyhow God by his spiritual birth amen brought in 120 children one time amen hallah amen hallelujah 120 baptized with the Holy Ghost Born Again Christians Hallelujah one time and then all of a sudden 5,000 3,000 come on somebody Hallelujah yall y'all understand what I'm saying God was birthing his own seed in a way the devil didn't know he was going to do woo now we hereen and the Bible said if that seed remains in you you cannot sin amenu Lord hallelujah hallelujah I'm covered brother amen I'm covered hallelujah hallelujah God got everything covered for me I might as well enjoy my salvation amen life in this little flower that drops out of the seed returns to somewhere that we know not where right but all the pup might go out of the seed and the seed not rod in the ground but yet there's a life in there that's hid from a resurrection a resurrected again everything speak gives testimony that's right you can put me under MRI you can cut me open and try to find the Holy Ghost you ain't going to find him but he's there amen hallelujah this old these natural machines can't pick him up Hallelujah but I can pick him up Hallelujah cuz the Bible said in that day you'll know I'm in the father the father's in me and I am in you amen hallelujah you know even scientists say you cannot literally hear the voice of Jesus they got instruments because you see your words don't don't stop I know y'all wish some of them would but they don't the only thing that will ever make it stop will be the blood of Jesus Christ Hallelujah the blood of Jesus Christ is the only thing can wipe away the words you've spoken or the words you've thought Hallelujah every word that's spoken and thought that you haven't confessed for and gotten rid of is still Co moving toward the Throne of God oh Lord and you'll be judged by every word at the white Throne judgment come on somebody Hallelujah but when you a saint of God when you baptized in his name Hallelujah when you've been buried with him come on somebody and you rise to walk in the newness of life that old life is washed away come on somebody and then God comes along and gives you the Holy Ghost knowing that there are times you are still grieving Hallelujah but he justified the true saints of God as though you've never sinned in the first place oh y'all don't have to shout I'm shouting anyhow amen hallelujah but when you look at this thing you and I must realize we are now approaching and that's what's so a frightening because there's so many Christians who are not aware of the coming of the Lord come on they're not even aware that America is getting ready to fold up not just America the whole world they don't even realize amen we're at the end time they don't know the last sign that God going to give this generation has come and gone H and we got people amen and don't get me wrong if you got a a garden to build a plant plant your garden but in the while you doing it do it in the name of Jesus you got to go to school go to school but do it in the name of Jesus he said whatever you do in word or deed do it all in the name of Jesus Amen keep yourself covered hallelujah amen because he would that you prosper even as your soul Prosper but don't you prosper and leave your soul behind neglecting yourself ation that's when you get in trouble you love the Lord amen now listen let me move on see because Matthew 25:13 and I'm not going to be long this morning says watch where therefore I'm talking about a moral season and I'm not done with it yet he says listen uh watch ye therefore for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the son

God hallelujah the evidence is there oh come on somebody now let's look on let's move on you and I we must understand by the grace of God let let me just jump to this so so we can we can close up for this morning now we're talking about Immortal season and we're talking about the Supernatural and I was thinking about this yesterday and I thought isn't it funny that even in the world today everything is super they got some kind of super hero you know you know and I I've noticed how they bringing back all the old comic book Heroes super this and super that what is Satan trying to do he's trying to make Mortal men super right but what he does and you got to understand every one of those supers had an experience some sort right y'all y'all know what I'm saying even in the days of papey he had a super experience with spish something changed him something transformed him It Ain't Nothing But The Devil in a perverted LIE there's only one transformation and that is done by the Holy Ghost he's getting his lines and his lyrics from somewhere come on somebody right from the word of God he's just perverting it amen and if you going to be a Superman or Superwoman or super daughter or a super son you got to have the super on the inside and that super is Jesus Christ himself Luke 10:22 said all things are delivered to me of my father father and no man knoweth who the son is but the father and who the father is but the son and he to whom the son will reveal him huh you think God won't do it he'll do it he's done it that's right he comes right into the uh audience of the Pharisees and the Sadducees and they call him beah say you a devil they said aren't you the one that was born of fornication huh saying that Mary was not faithful to Joseph hello somebody amen and then you get a woman at the well he can just talk to her for a few minutes amen and tell her about her lifestyle and what she went through and and and then she goes on to say Amen that uh uh uh uh we know that when the Messiah should come he going to tell us these things and he comes right straight up straight straight that's how he does to a True Believer am when you catch a hold of this message he don't fool around with it he comes with it and shows you I am he Hallelujah is that right she ran to the city and says come see a man that told me about all these my all my life amen and everybody else was call him a devil Hallelujah Lord they come to Jesus them Pharisees and say now you tell us plainly who you are who are you J said basically I've told you already but you're not listening you're not hearing what I'm trying to tell you in Jesus I love this part I'm going close I'm trying to anyway he says uh uh tell me John see you can't even get to Jesus until you answer the question about John Hallelujah so was it in that day so is it in this day you can't even get to Jesus until you answer the question about amen hallelujah hallelujah he said I tell you tell me who was John who was he they got in a communal little group said now but if we tell him that he was joh he was he was the Elijah you know the one to come he going to say Well then why didn't you follow his ministry said but if we tell him that he's not then he people going to Stone [Laughter] us amen then they said I tell you what the best way out of this question is to go back and tell them amen we have no idea right we do not know and they said well Lord we cannot tell and then Jesus said you see they lied to him they lied in the face of the word they knew the answer and they lie and he comes and said well neither can I tell you amen Hallelujah if you can't tell me he who Elijah is I can't tell you who I am oh that was fresh from the throne I love that amen because you and I must recognize amen the way up is the way down amen now he's revealing things and he to whom the son will reveal him is where I'm going to pick up because I want you to understand Jesus said to his disciples you know all things am you know all things you know all things because if God is in you amen you know all things you know all things and and what people must understand because when this thing folds up the world in itself I don't care how many years we got left it's going to happen you know sometime it look like it's going to happen now then God put on the pause and then it happens again then God put it on the pause and one of days these paes going to stop but one thing for certain I don't care if you ever forever wrong at your your your your thoughts and desires as long as you looking he said I will appear to those who are who love my appearing I'll show myself to them those who love my appearing that's that's who I show myself to you love the Lord amen amen let's stand if you truly know him see if you truly know him it's only because he's revealed himself to you your education did not reveal Jesus he revealed himself there were great educated men who came to Jesus and never could see him understand even the Rich Young Ruler knew he was God because Jesus said now there's only one good and that's God right so to even the rich Young Ruler understood he was God on Earth but he would not submit see he wouldn't humble himself amen because he failed to see that one day I'm going to die and that's what most people fail to see you going to die anybody in here know that you're not if the Lord T I know I know we talking about I'm talking about naturally if the Lord terries the only ones who will not die is that you've been ordained to take a translation but even that is by faith is that right so my point is this if the Lord doesn't come and reveal himself in that manner to you you going to go to the grave no ANS ifs a but about it I was telling my wife yesterday I said when I die folks if the Lord car and I die don't you spend all this money on no grave site and all of this casket and stuff find me the cheapest thing Buri me cuz that ain't me anyhow my real you going to come up that one of these old days don't spend all that money or whatever you call cly stuff I don't I don't want to be buried in some mud or nothing I want to be B buried somewhere where you can come see me at sometime or have memories if you want to do that but don't spend a whole lot of money no no no take that money and use it for the living amen oh I've seen people they spend all this money for the dead and then after they unburied the person they wish they had it Hallelujah I got insurance it's not for me to be buried Amen in some luxurious way how I'm going to know it anyhow ain't no experiences I'm going to have not there I'm up there shouting and H Gloria Hallelujah time y'all hear what I'm saying that's all I'm saying but you know I I look at people and I think why do they do that amen you know when they in the old days they just had a little tomb or something they wrapped them up and whatever you know that was it so my my point is don't cremate me I don't care how bad this body being it still holds my resurrection you love the Lord amen I ain't scared of no worms I won't be there anyhow y'all understand what I'm saying amen my point my my thing is people we're in a season now you got to look at yourself because it's way how it's how you think your your it's how you think as a man thinketh in his heart so is he so it's your thoughts that will will keep Satan from you amen your thoughts about who you are amen your thoughts about your relationship with God and who you are will cause Satan to be limited in your life amen but if you can't like I said if you can't forget your past and I was encouraged with this the other day amen if you can't forget you know what you've done oh Lord you still trying to rake it back up and and and God done already said you're dead and I have yet gone to a a funeral and you know the man was bad you know the man or the woman was bad and they'll never tell you how bad of a drug addict he was they'll never tell you how you know he was a womanized or or whatever he was doing they'll never tell you everybody want to put even the children of of the devil in heaven they say all good things hello you'll never find it I don't care if you don't kill 10 10 people you'll never see that on the obituary hello somebody that's what God did with us in Hebrew Hallelujah God never wrote all the bad things about Abraham huh amen amen you know
