TRANSCRIPT
========================================
what I'm saying how are you going to get out of the Grave if you don't believe God is able to bring you out no matter how many years the Bible said those Old Testament Saints died in faith they knew they were going to get up they knew there was going to be a resurrection how did they know by Revelation Joseph said don't leave my bones here Amen in Egypt take me there in the promised land because that's where the word is going that's where the resurrection is coming for you understand me as long as you in the promised land which is the word of this hour you will have and see a resurrection Hallelujah glory to God he said it's written stay right with the word right see we understand and I'm trying to hurry God and Sunday Times the Bible said many times in many ways spoke to the spoke the word through the prophets this is why Brethren was trying to get people to see who was really on the scene if you follow the message you'll understand what he was doing he was literally trying to get the people to see this is Elohim this is this is where the Bible said that he spoke to us through and by his son this is the age all the other age he preached and spoke by Prophet but here the prophet of all prophets which was Jesus Christ himself spoke to us see this message is not William Brando's message it's literally Jesus Christ's message and in William Brandon's message is the message of Jesus Christ and you understand what I'm saying it's literally The Living Word of God coming to a filthy generation as we are a place where you think it would be hopeless Amen to resurrect or to call a bride out of the most wicked age ever but that's the way God loves to do it he loved hopeless situations he's the one that could pull bring uh bring light out of Darkness yes if you can see what the man God have mercy that's what Paul was trying to say too Paul says listen I want to know him in the power of his resurrection now I want to know him in his suffering and in the power of his resurrection Paul says listen Jesus I didn't die for you he said I didn't die for you it was Jesus Christ who died for you see what I'm trying to say the gospel even the way I'm preaching must increase you understand me because it's got to be more than lecturing it's got to be more than me preaching it's got to be power and demonstration and what you must need to know brother Brooks we're pressing we're moving forward we believe in the word I can't make it happen but I'm believing by God's grace those things will happen it has to happen as long as I stay with the word God will vindicate his word not me he'll vindicate his word Hallelujah this is yet the characteristics of God today he not and listen this is why what what good is it going to do to you if I'm preaching faith and you don't believe what I'm preaching nothing can be done Jesus couldn't even do it he went into Capernaum and he couldn't do no Miracles because they had no faith if you don't have faith in what I'm preaching then nothing going to happen but for those who can have faith in this word that I'm preaching if I'm doing something wrong if I'm preaching wrong you're obligated to show me you understand me but if I'm preaching right take it believe it and you'll see God work a miracle in your life you'll begin to see changes in your life why do you say that brother verse because I'm seeing changes in my life Hallelujah see this is yet the characteristics of God today he not only speaks through a prophet but but the world but he wrote the word under inspiration come with the prophet today because of Technology it is a recorded in books and takes y'all understand me they had sheepskin and from sheepskin it was put onto paper and now it's put onto magnetic tapes but God is wonderful because he does it in such a simple way and he does it in a way to confuse and blind the unbeliever Hallelujah but like I said the other day so that we can understand those before us had brother Branham they had a prophet they could I mean a physical man they could eat with him they could hunt with him they could they could sit down and you know laugh with him but we don't have that but the greatest thing that we do have is The Voice because it is the voice of God y'all understand what I'm saying it the glory of the prophets was greater but the glory of Jesus Christ is greater amen I'm gonna say that again because I could feel it almost like on the line somebody out there let me tell you something what brother Branham did was great what God did through him was great but he saved the best for last night and that's the Bride of Jesus Christ listen to those tapes after 63 you'll hear him say things to the Bride of Jesus Christ he never said to laodicea trying to get her to see her position and our position must come back to the original position that Ephesus had amen is that right in the preview of the Bride the first church came by was Ephesus she came through walking to the tune of the word and when the prophet thought that all was lost Miss America in her rock and roll rocking rock himself okay here she comes marching to the tune of Onward Christian Soldier marching to the word to the beat of the word he said she was just like the the first bride that came around she's the only one that gets a second preview all the other churches had one chance the Bride Comes Along why because Jesus Christ is Alpha and he's Omega Hallelujah see the identification of a man see he's speaking through a man that was called to be a prophet now the Bible says that God is hundred times diverse man has spoke to the fathers through the prophet we also read over in second Peter that the whole word of God was wrote by them man of all moved by the Holy Ghost wrote the Bible they were prophets the word come to them and they wrote it wrote it down under inspiration first they were identified prophets then they wrote the word of inspiration and they had the interpretation of divine revelation because it was God in the man don't you know God know his word now that's the way he shows himself in his characteristics of identification their Visions being Vindicated in God characteristics in them making himself known to the people that's what he was doing in brother Byron of making himself known through the in the people through the people you love the Lord God cannot change his characteristics people say well why Prophet because he that's the way he decided to come he was more than just a prophet and he was trying to tell everybody that the inspiration that was behind him was was was Elohim now you don't have to believe that but that's what he said he said because Elohim came to Abraham he said if you go down in Genesis it says where God created he said that's Elohim right and so he's telling us amen God Has Come how many of y'all remember brother random said that Jesus Christ created his own bride that's that's a quote Jesus Christ created his own brother so let me ask you when and where did he do it huh oh no yeah yeah that's true too it was before but I'm talking about now never in the history of the church outside of Ephesus where God unveils himself by the way of his divine nature Amendment right that's right now he's creating his bride right now here on Earth like he did out his bride but he could only listen this is what you're going to understand he's creating a spiritual man a man either not only his image but his likeness right and and you know the thing about it is we we fail to see the importance of adding to your virtue knowledge and Temperance Faith you know adding we we fail to see what he's doing he's building he's making a bride and it is an invisible Union it's it's God bringing it up to Divine love because in order to be equally yoked you must have Divine love because he is divine love this is why the scripture says those that have gone on they cannot be completed without us we are the Capstone Ministry we are God's Finishing Touch this is why he put us in such opposition because he's expecting perfection and he knows that the only way that you can produce Perfection is that Perfection is living in you you must be born again now his characteristics never change God cannot change his character can and no more than a lamb can change his character or any other thing can change his his character because as long as it is it is original it's original and if you change anything then you change it from its original that's why the spoken word is the Original Seed it has to come by way of preaching and people won't come the Bible says the day that you see uh the Lord approaching you ought to come together the more why God creating he's judging this is the house of God he's he's bringing forth little of my SP I've been there I've seen you know in in meetings I'm preaching I'm preaching under the inspiration of the word and God filled people in with the Holy Ghost I didn't have to touch them I didn't have to lay hands on them but because they believed the word that God filled them with the Holy Ghost and they never backslid you understand me praise God it didn't come by me the birth came by the word is that the right way absolutely Peter preached on the day of Pentecost and the power of God came down Hallelujah when they preached in cornelia's house the power of God came down gave them the Holy Ghost right there because they believed what they heard and they received what they heard and God came down and Vindicated it that's the original way I cannot change he Remains the Same we know that the Bible said Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever you listen to brother Brown oh my God if you listen to the voice of God coming through that man at the end of his ministry he was trying to tell the people I don't need to lay hands if I could get you to believe what I'm preaching it'll happen to you right now everything you're healing you if you you can walk if you're blind you can see he was just telling them it's him here God if you can see God move me out of the way see God he's here if you can believe that God is here he's basically saying you can have whatever you ask for I heard the prophet say something the other day he said God will continue to help you believe that's the essence of what he said he had tried this and if you don't believe he'll try something else to make you believe and you know that's the truth right because even in the even in the prayer line he's literally talking to these people and brother Ben said oh you be careful you're going to miss it you're going to miss it he said let me do something to help you sister so and so who was that that was God helping the people to believe God help us Jesus see that's how I'm building my Foundation is is built on this message this word I mean you know I have nothing else to hold on to and really I'm not holding to it he's holding to me you know I was telling the Lord I says Lord I don't even see I really don't see what he you know why because you know I can see where I've been so faulty throughout my life and you know in times you thought I could see I thought I was a Christian in reality I was not if you be honest with you didn't live white one you didn't pray like one you didn't read and study your Bible like one so you had a false what that's right false belief false testimony false communion but God is merciful oh Jesus now his characteristics never fails is always is the same is that right it never fails I'm almost done but listen First Corinthians 14 through 6 through 9. and it says now brethren if I come unto you speaking with tongues what shall I profit you accept I shall speak to you either by Revelation or by knowledge or by prophesying or by Doctrine let me say it like this when the truth is revealed to any of you and you reject it you die right there you don't even know it because when the Pentecostals rejected by the Venom they died they didn't understand it wasn't a man they were rejecting right let the Lord told Samuel the people now are not rejecting you they're rejecting me and they rejected the Lord and they put him out the church and look at them now oh my God and you tell me that he wasn't a prophet and he told us everything and how bad it was going to get my Lord have mercy if I come unto you speak with tongues and what shall I profit you except I shall speak to you either by Revelation or by knowledge or by prophesying or by Doctrine in even then without life-giving sound whether pipe or harp except they give a distinction in the sound how shall it be known what is piped or harped for if the trumpet give an uncertain sound who shall prepare himself to the battle why did Paul use the word trumpet and battle because it refers to us trumpet whenever a trumpet is sounded it denotes War is that right and brother Branham said the seals to the to the Bride of Jesus Christ is the trumpets to the Jews right and you know that when brother random was on the scene he blew a trumpet he calls Havoc in the church world they literally hated him and some people rejoice when he died because they did not see that they have been rejected by God and they sit in darkness now to this day that generation not only and curse themselves but they cursed their children like akan did for if the trumpet gives an uncertain child this is what I'm saying the word doesn't give an uncertain sound the message doesn't give an uncertain sound now we can misinterpret it when it really needs no interpretation it's it's playing it's clear but oftentimes we put our little something in there but that's when you become error it becomes error and God corrects the error Hallelujah is that right listen brother Adam preached a lot of things and guess what happened people would misconstrue they'd change it and make him say things they didn't even say but he said truth but God you know we can't help it when people twisted right so likewise you accept ye utter by tongue words easy to be understood how shall it be known what is spoken for we shall speak into the air thank God for interpreting us right I don't speak French but when French is spoken I hardly understand anything but when there's an interpreter I can understand French if that makes sense but see God says listen I'm going to be playing straight I'm gonna tell you exactly how it is and it's up to you the whole truth the wisdom of this whole message is to keep God's word fear God and keep his Commandments that's wisdom now I'm almost done Psalms 119 1 3 1 103 to 106. how sweet are thy words unto my taste yay sweeter than honey to my mouth through thy precepts I get understanding therefore I hate every false way do y'all understand why he's saying that because every false way leads me into destruction amen even to the point when people tried to make brother Branham God he says Oh my he went off the field because of it and he said you make me an antichrist and we still have people in this message that truly makes brother Barnum an antichrist sad do you really think they're going to heaven with that it ain't happening that's a new gospel that's a different gospel Paul said it's another Jesus I'll get on trouble that's okay that word is a lamp unto my feet and a light into my pathway I have Swan listen Thy word what direction are you going in my point is what are you becoming what's happening where is the changes in you there must be changes being made in you growing up into Christ maturing into Christ not allowing yourself to fall into arguments and strife and bitterness and all these natural things that the flesh bring upon us we must break beyond that so much so that we'll love even our enemies Hallelujah we haven't even gotten to the place where we love each other we need to love our each other and then love our enemies as well I have sworn and I will perform it that I will keep the righteous judgment thy righteous judgment Hallelujah one more and I'm Gonna Let You Go proverbs 4 3 and 7 and I hope you're getting what I'm saying I can't preach what I really see in one night or one service but I'll tell you this people when you take your eyes off of Jesus you're going to do just like Peter you're going to sink you got to keep your eyes the Bible says when when brother Adam said he saw the preview of the church he said he saw them marching to the tune of onward trees I love that song because it says Onward Christian Soldier marching as to war with the cross of Jesus going on before that was what was leading the Bride of Jesus Christ that was what was in the in the Forefront of her it was absolutely Calvary she kept her kept her eyes on what Calvary did for her that's what kept her in line for I was my Father's son tender and only beloved in the sight of my mother he taught me also and said unto me let thine heart retain my words keep my Commandments and live get wisdom get understanding forget it not neither decline from the words of my mouth um God's mouth or God's mouthpiece was William Branham and he literally laid out and dressed the bride by the word otherwise he'd still be here but he laid in record everything she needed to know and he know by God's grace she will find it and she will know what to do with the word right she knows she's different she's a speckle bird covered by the blood of Jesus she knows what to do with it and she knows this is her preparation to meet the Lord I'm not prepared to do nothing else I don't care to be a president or Governor I'm preparing to meet the Lord Hallelujah oh Jesus that's truth forsake or not she shall preserve thee love her and she shall keep thee wisdom is the principal thing therefore get wisdom and with all that getting get understanding in closing I'm just going to say it like that God is God and we are so privileged it's not half of my message but we are so so privileged to know that the Living God is living now and he's building us inwardly inwardly he's building us into the perfect statue of Christ will Crown us with his divine nature Divine love and when those things take place which they are taking place and only God knows when everything is finished then we'll make a translation but God is waiting on us I mean the dead in Christ can't even get up yet until God is complete as his masterpiece amen so he finishes the touch with the squeeze your final tests is the oncoming squeeze your character must be his when he was under the squeeze the Bible said he rail not he didn't speak in vain the Bible said he opened not his mouth he didn't even you know defend himself he just stood like a lamb being sheared and at the end of his journey he said father forgive them for they know not what they do no bitterness no hatred no Envy no strife he projected his character as the Lamb of God you love the Lord let's stand we'll pray father God we so thank you Lord help us now keep us Lord and guide us Lord we all make mistakes at times and some we all need correcting at times and and father we just want to be able to accept correction uh no matter where it come from or who it comes from we pray father God that you would help us Lord to continue to focus on you to see you Jesus because you are our Lord and you're our savior we thank you Father God for the prophet of God we honor him in high esteem we respect all that he has done because without him we wouldn't be here Lord and we thank you Father for allowing a man to go through such suffering as he did to bring this message but even as he said in that message on the wings of a snow white dove he said the message made it home I am grateful hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] Hallelujah oh Jesus Hallelujah
