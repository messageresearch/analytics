[52:56] of the grace of god given unto me by the
[52:59] effectual working of his power
[53:02] unto me who am less than the least of
[53:06] all saints is this grace given that i
[53:09] should preach
[53:10] among the gentiles the unsearchable
[53:12] riches of christ
[53:14] and to make all men see what is the
[53:17] fellowship of the mystery
[53:18] which from the beginning of the world
[53:21] have been hid
[53:22] in god who created all things
[53:25] by jesus christ to the intent that
[53:28] now unto the principalities and powers
[53:31] in heavenly places
[53:32] might be known by the church the
[53:35] manifold wisdom
[53:36] of god i want you to understand where
[53:38] this church is located
[53:40] it's located in heavenly places
[53:42] according to the eternal purpose
[53:44] which the purpose which he purposed in
[53:47] christ jesus our lord
[53:49] in whom we have boldness and excess with
[53:52] confidence by
[53:53] faith of him wherefore i desire
[53:56] that you faint not at my tribulation for
[53:59] you
[54:00] which is your glory for this cause i bow
[54:03] my knees unto the father of our lord
[54:06] jesus christ
[54:07] of whom the whole family in heaven and
[54:11] earth is named ephesians 1
[54:17] and 3 blessed be the god and father
[54:21] of our lord jesus christ who have
[54:24] blessed
[54:24] us with all spiritual blessings here we
[54:27] go
[54:28] in heavenly places in christ not on
[54:31] earth
[54:32] in heavenly places in christ according
[54:35] as he has chosen
[54:36] us in him before the foundation of the
[54:39] world
[54:40] that we should be holy and without blame
[54:43] before him in love having predestinated
[54:47] us
[54:48] unto the adoption of the children by
[54:50] jesus christ to himself
[54:52] according to the good pleasure of his
[54:54] will to the praise
[54:57] of the glory of his grace wherein he
[55:00] have
[55:00] made us accepted in the beloved
[55:05] amen well let's just stop right there
[55:07] i've got a few others but
[55:09] uh we're still working with the higher
[55:10] thinking
[55:12] and uh standing in heaven is what we're
[55:15] kind of working with higher thinking and
[55:17] then standing in heaven
[55:20] you know uh uh
[55:24] we know that god amen is doing a great
[55:26] thing and
[55:27] and i'm so glad to be part of that uh uh
[55:32] as you can look around you can see that
[55:34] uh
[55:35] the closer the day come the fewer the
[55:38] numbers
[55:39] uh but don't let that ever discourage
[55:41] you
[55:42] because that's the way it's supposed to
[55:44] be amen so
[55:46] let us pray father god we thank you for
[55:48] your grace we thank you for your mercy
[55:50] we thank you for
[55:51] being so good to us we thank you for
[55:54] everything lord we
[55:56] know that you you are here and we
[55:59] we're grateful for that we understand
[56:02] lord jesus where
[56:04] you desire to have us to be and it's our
[56:06] desire to be there
[56:07] father we just pray that you keep our
[56:09] hearts and our minds
[56:11] elevated in the in a place where we
[56:14] won't be forgetful like james say
[56:16] looking in the mirror and then walking
[56:17] away
[56:18] forgetting what kind of man we ought to
[56:20] be we just trust
[56:22] oh god and we place everything in your
[56:24] hands
[56:25] we pray that you would just use us this
[56:27] evening for your glory
[56:28] and we'll be careful to give you the
[56:30] praise glory and honor in jesus christ's
[56:32] name we pray
[56:33] amen you may be seated
[56:36] amen so we we dealt with this morning
[56:40] uh a few things that you know excited me
[56:44] because i realized that man you know we
[56:45] talk about letting the mind of christ be
[56:48] in you
[56:48] it is something that most people can't
[56:50] comprehend
[56:52] especially the part where it says that
[56:55] uh
[56:55] he thought it not eat robbery to be
[56:58] equal with god
[57:00] and to be honest with you as a young
[57:01] christian that used to stumble me
[57:04] because
[57:05] first of all it uh god had to be defined
[57:08] you know a lot of times people think
[57:10] they know what god is or who god is
[57:14] and oftentimes they see god almost like
[57:17] a statue
[57:18] you know almost like some kind of thing
[57:21] you come to worship but it has no life
[57:24] in it
[57:24] you know um but god amen is very
[57:28] difficult to define him
[57:30] because his ways are past finding out i
[57:32] mean there is no way that you could ever
[57:34] put god in a box
[57:36] you know this is why god even in the
[57:38] early part of the scripture he never
[57:40] gave himself a name
[57:42] and then when he gave his name to moses
[57:45] he said i am that i am you see because
[57:48] god always will you know reflects
[57:52] himself in so many ways
[57:54] we know god even in the sense of a
[57:57] husband and a wife
[57:59] right because we know that when god
[58:01] created adam and eve in his image
[58:04] they were male and female but understand
[58:07] in those
[58:08] attributes there's still perhaps
[58:10] trillions of things that
[58:12] we have never seen uh or and and
[58:15] wouldn't understand it if he would show
[58:17] us
[58:17] but god tries to break himself down and
[58:19] put come down into a lower
[58:22] lower state to a place where we can
[58:24] comprehend and understand
[58:27] right and and understand that even in
[58:29] our intellect we think that we can
[58:31] understand him
[58:32] but that's not the way god is understood
[58:35] he's understood
[58:37] by revelation and upon this rock i'll
[58:40] build my church and the gates of hell
[58:42] shall not prevail against it
[58:43] so we understand by god's grace how do
[58:46] you get the mind of god what is the mind
[58:48] of god
[58:49] and when you see the mind of god you
[58:50] must understand you're working with god
[58:53] right it's not like god got a little
[58:55] section in his spirit where there's a
[58:57] mind
[58:58] god in himself is his mind you know he's
[59:01] his very thought he's
[59:02] he's everything you know and uh because
[59:05] we first of all must understand that god
[59:06] is a spirit
[59:08] and this is why oftentimes people
[59:10] misunderstand god they don't understand
[59:12] him they think
[59:13] you know he's more like a man you know
[59:15] some people picture him
[59:16] as an old grandpa you know sitting on a
[59:18] big throne and
[59:19] he's ruling everything and then you got
[59:21] jesus and mary and
[59:22] whoever else but they have the wrong
[59:25] picture
[59:26] you know brother branham tried to
[59:27] describe him to us you know a fountain
[59:30] of love a fountain of peace a fountain
[59:33] and then when you when you think about a
[59:34] fountain you think about where did the
[59:36] fountain come from
[59:37] but he is called what we call the
[59:40] self-existing one
[59:42] and the bible tells us he's all and in
[59:45] all there's no way to hide from him
[59:47] regardless to who you think you are
[59:49] whether you be sinner or saint
[59:51] we all will meet him one day now god is
[59:54] such a powerful god he
[59:56] he knows he could be he is so great he
[59:58] can humble himself
[59:59] and he hides himself in such a simple
[1:00:01] way that
[1:00:02] you know the the smart man seemed to
[1:00:05] miss him
[1:00:06] uh but one thing we know that god has
[1:00:09] already declared himself
[1:00:10] even in his nature you know we see birds
[1:00:13] and we
[1:00:14] see and you think to yourself this thing
[1:00:17] god you know it's and god is just
[1:00:20] we call him god because before he was
[1:00:23] god he was
[1:00:23] self-existing one and god means to
[1:00:25] worship
[1:00:27] but then there's a lot of people don't
[1:00:28] even know what they're worshiping
[1:00:30] and but we we we know
[1:00:34] we know that god is a spirit and this is
[1:00:36] why we need the holy ghost
[1:00:39] because the holy ghost will lead us and
[1:00:40] guide us into all
[1:00:42] truth right and the holy ghost will tell
[1:00:45] us
[1:00:45] everything of the father everything that
[1:00:47] the father wants us to know of him
[1:00:49] the holy ghost will reveal it to us
[1:00:52] isn't that amazing
[1:00:53] that god can reveal these things to us
[1:00:55] and then the thing that he revealed to
[1:00:56] us we can't tell somebody else because
[1:00:58] they wouldn't understand what you're
[1:00:59] talking about
[1:01:01] but it's a personal thing it's something
[1:01:03] that god amen has
[1:01:05] has done now the thing that i'm looking
[1:01:07] for and the thing that i'm so
[1:01:09] excited about tonight is that the very
[1:01:12] fact
[1:01:13] that god purposed me and you
[1:01:16] to have his mind
[1:01:19] to have his whole being because brother
[1:01:23] branham didn't know how to say it
[1:01:24] no better than this he said all that was
[1:01:26] in god
[1:01:27] he poured it into christ and all that
[1:01:29] was in christ
[1:01:31] he poured it into his church now paul
[1:01:33] had a different way of
[1:01:35] saying things but paul basically tried
[1:01:38] to tell us
[1:01:39] that we were the very offspring of god
[1:01:44] right i mean we understand that
[1:01:46] according to
[1:01:47] access he's he's not like these animals
[1:01:50] and things that people
[1:01:51] try to fix put in their minds this fee
[1:01:54] these fictitious things but he is
[1:01:59] we are the very offspring of god
[1:02:03] and so if we can understand who we are
[1:02:06] and what we are composed of
[1:02:08] now we know by god's grace and i'ma get
[1:02:10] to the message in just a moment
[1:02:12] but we know by god's grace that we're
[1:02:14] made in the image and likeness of god
[1:02:16] now a lot of time people on this don't
[1:02:18] understand what the image and likeness
[1:02:20] of god is
[1:02:21] but but uh you know we know that when it
[1:02:24] comes to the image and likeness of god
[1:02:26] he's not just talking about your outer
[1:02:27] shell
[1:02:28] right he's talking about the inward
[1:02:31] composition
[1:02:32] right that soul in that spirit because
[1:02:35] nobody's ever seen their soul and
[1:02:36] nobody's ever seen their spirit
[1:02:38] but but yet and still we are in a house
[1:02:41] we
[1:02:42] we hide and nobody has ever seen
[1:02:45] us really right but but we're there
[1:02:48] we have this housing that that supports
[1:02:51] us
[1:02:51] until our time is up on this earth
[1:02:54] but jesus said to his disciples when you
[1:02:58] see me
[1:02:59] you see the father so he was very
[1:03:02] descriptive because
[1:03:03] they had seen god they have seen jesus
[1:03:05] do a lot of things but
[1:03:07] he wasn't saying okay that that when you
[1:03:09] see me
[1:03:10] god has these brown eyes and brown hair
[1:03:12] and this
[1:03:13] no he was working with the
[1:03:16] quality of character that they had
[1:03:19] witnessed
[1:03:20] in the time they were fellowshipping
[1:03:23] with him
[1:03:24] uh the supernatural because remember
[1:03:28] jesus says
[1:03:29] i can't do nothing except the father
[1:03:32] show me now
[1:03:36] we're standing in heavenly places
[1:03:39] we are in a place amen that we
[1:03:42] god is calling us to move
[1:03:46] into what we know as the supernatural
[1:03:49] and i explain that amen it's it's it's
[1:03:52] another dimension
[1:03:54] that we are we have been you see because
[1:03:56] when you're born you're born into this
[1:03:58] dimension
[1:03:59] this dimension has gravitational pulls
[1:04:02] it holds you
[1:04:03] here but in that dimension
[1:04:06] there are no gravitational pulls you can
[1:04:09] travel
[1:04:10] from here to there without power
[1:04:13] boosters
[1:04:14] right you don't need a rocket ship you
[1:04:17] just
[1:04:17] move by the power of the anointing
[1:04:21] from one place to another you say well
[1:04:23] how can that be scriptural
[1:04:25] the bible said it was philip that god
[1:04:27] translated him
[1:04:29] from one place to another he didn't need
[1:04:32] no earthly equipment
[1:04:34] it was god who translated him but what
[1:04:37] about
[1:04:38] enoch enoch still lives he never died
[1:04:41] as far as we know of but the bible said
[1:04:44] he was translated
[1:04:45] and he was found not now i don't know
[1:04:48] about you but
[1:04:50] i know i came from god you must know
[1:04:54] you came from god and if you came from
[1:04:56] god you go
[1:04:57] back to god there is no other way you're
[1:05:00] either of god or you're of the devil
[1:05:02] amen
[1:05:03] we must think if we are the offspring of
[1:05:07] god
[1:05:09] and according to the book of acts
[1:05:12] it says even your poets say it
[1:05:15] that we are the offspring of god now
[1:05:19] as far as i understand whoever this poet
[1:05:21] was
[1:05:22] amen wasn't even a christian but he had
[1:05:25] the revelation
[1:05:26] that we were the descendants or the
[1:05:29] offspring of god
[1:05:31] now when you say that you must
[1:05:33] understand what you're saying because
[1:05:35] some people would think you blaspheming
[1:05:38] you know because
[1:05:38] remember lucifer wanted to be as god
[1:05:42] he wanted a been a higher level of uh
[1:05:46] order than what god had put him in now i
[1:05:49] want to say like this when god created
[1:05:51] adam and eve that both name were adam
[1:05:54] they were on an equal basis
[1:05:56] but the woman has always been subject to
[1:05:58] the man
[1:06:00] a lot of times people think the woman
[1:06:01] was subject only
[1:06:03] after the fall but remember amen
[1:06:07] adam represented god he was the male
[1:06:09] part of god
[1:06:11] and eve or adam's second was he was the
[1:06:14] female part of god which represents the
[1:06:17] bride
[1:06:18] god will always be god we're attribute
[1:06:22] of
[1:06:22] him you understand me he was the
[1:06:24] original
[1:06:25] and we if you want to put it in it's uh
[1:06:28] how do you say the byproduct
[1:06:30] of who he is what he is
[1:06:33] amen we we want as you can say
[1:06:36] we were part of elohim but we're not
[1:06:39] elohim
[1:06:40] if that makes sense right we are part of
[1:06:44] him
[1:06:44] but without him we're nothing
[1:06:49] and i don't know how to explain that no
[1:06:50] better than that
[1:06:52] so that you can understand the functions
[1:06:56] of what god is trying to do the front of
[1:06:58] the first thing that god wanted
[1:07:00] to do was make a family he was father
[1:07:03] right he tutored he worked with uh adam
[1:07:06] and everything else
[1:07:07] and the the next uh episode of adam and
[1:07:11] eve was to produce
[1:07:12] children of their kind which would have
[1:07:16] made god
[1:07:16] have would have placed god in a place
[1:07:19] where he had
[1:07:20] a family well that was interrupted
[1:07:24] that was interrupted now paul is trying
[1:07:26] to tell us that the whole
[1:07:28] family of god is named after him
[1:07:31] so now god has a family but you must
[1:07:34] understand
[1:07:35] that the family that god has was
[1:07:38] produced by the second adam
[1:07:40] amen hallelujah who is jesus christ
[1:07:43] himself
[1:07:44] which is he said a quickening spirit
[1:07:48] and this is why we need the holy ghost
[1:07:51] the holy ghost is that quickening spirit
[1:07:54] amen that brings us into the family of
[1:07:56] god
[1:07:59] listen paul says listen he says listen i
[1:08:01] i i want you to understand
[1:08:04] that what i have has been given to me by
[1:08:06] the grace of god
[1:08:07] in other words i didn't earn it but god
[1:08:09] has made me a spokesman
[1:08:11] for him and i'm here to tell you
[1:08:14] gentiles
[1:08:15] you don't understand maybe in
[1:08:18] in the future you understand the riches
[1:08:21] amen the god has given and the grace
[1:08:23] that god has given to us now think about
[1:08:26] it
[1:08:26] amen god chose the jews but he married
[1:08:30] a man a gentile hallelujah
[1:08:33] and the gentiles were considered dogs
[1:08:37] amen but god took the least of all kinds
[1:08:40] of people
[1:08:41] and raised them up and put them in
[1:08:44] heavenly places in christ jesus
[1:08:46] this is not something that we're just
[1:08:48] going on in our head
[1:08:50] it must settle in your heart right
[1:08:54] but the more revelation you have the
[1:08:56] greater
[1:08:57] the revelation you have the humbler you
[1:08:59] become
[1:09:01] right true revelation do not exalt you
[1:09:04] hallelujah it humbles you because you
[1:09:08] realize
[1:09:08] amen without the grace of god
[1:09:12] i would have nothing listen paul said
[1:09:15] it this message i'm trying to bring to
[1:09:18] you and brother said
[1:09:19] he preached exactly what paul preached
[1:09:21] right
[1:09:22] he said is to make all men see what
[1:09:25] is the fellowship of the mystery which
[1:09:28] whom
[1:09:28] from the beginning of the world have
[1:09:30] been heared in god
[1:09:32] who created all things by jesus christ
[1:09:35] now the fall came right and we have all
[1:09:39] through
[1:09:39] ages looked at god as though he's this
[1:09:43] mean guy who's forcing everybody to
[1:09:46] worship him and if you don't worship him
[1:09:49] he's going to
[1:09:50] destroy you by sending your soul to hell
[1:09:54] and you know many people think that
[1:09:56] because my
[1:09:57] my relative amen said to me why should i
[1:10:00] worship a god who's trying to force me
[1:10:03] to worship him
[1:10:05] and you know people say that out of
[1:10:07] ignorance because they don't know who
[1:10:09] god
[1:10:09] is they don't know what god is
[1:10:12] satan himself has has blinded the people
[1:10:16] i mean literally it is his working that
[1:10:19] is evil
[1:10:20] but they he makes the people think that
[1:10:22] it's the working of god
[1:10:23] well if he was god why does he let this
[1:10:26] happen
[1:10:27] well no no no he doesn't let it happen
[1:10:30] you choose for it to happen he has given
[1:10:33] you
[1:10:33] the right to say yay or nay
[1:10:37] right and and so had it not been for sin
[1:10:41] none of this would be happening right
[1:10:44] and adam and eve chose the way they went
[1:10:46] well if he knew it was going to happen
[1:10:47] well
[1:10:48] that's a long story but the whole point
[1:10:50] is
[1:10:51] god's word a promise cannot come back
[1:10:55] void right now we look at this thing and
[1:10:59] we say okay brother brooks
[1:11:00] what are you saying what he said
[1:11:02] according he had an
[1:11:04] eternal purpose
[1:11:07] now you know what that word means
[1:11:09] eternal
[1:11:11] that means it had no beginning no ending
[1:11:14] this has always been with god
[1:11:16] his purpose has always been with god and
[1:11:19] what it is to for a man to live without
[1:11:21] a purpose
[1:11:22] every man has a purpose hallelujah and
[1:11:25] god
[1:11:26] had a purpose and his purpose was to
[1:11:28] create and
[1:11:29] and become a god and be worshipped and
[1:11:32] have a family and
[1:11:33] you know we can't even we can't even
[1:11:36] imagine the unfolding
[1:11:40] of god in the years to come now we call
[1:11:43] it years but we don't know what
[1:11:45] eternality in eternal life brings but we
[1:11:48] have no idea
[1:11:50] and yet i i like myself
[1:11:54] even in this stage almost like in the
[1:11:56] seed form
[1:11:57] you know of of eternity what's really
[1:12:00] going to come through
[1:12:01] all of this you know but we
[1:12:04] know that the adversary and i'm gonna go
[1:12:08] here now a little bit
[1:12:09] we know that the adversary that we're
[1:12:12] working with
[1:12:13] is just temporal he's not eternal
[1:12:19] but god is using this adversary
[1:12:22] to produce you
[1:12:27] the god that he wants to see come out of
[1:12:30] you
[1:12:30] or to be reflected from you he uses the
[1:12:34] darkness
[1:12:36] to glorify the light now
[1:12:41] the bible said whom the whole family in
[1:12:43] heaven and earth is named and i'm
[1:12:45] thinking now
[1:12:46] because we talk about names i told you
[1:12:48] that
[1:12:49] god told moses i am that i am
[1:12:54] and and and that just gets to me because
[1:12:56] i think now
[1:12:59] he moves yet his character stays the
[1:13:02] same
[1:13:04] but there are so many things about him
[1:13:07] to really this
[1:13:08] time is what we we would say gave him a
[1:13:11] name
[1:13:13] and when i say that i mean as he changed
[1:13:16] from
[1:13:16] his glory to glory to manifest himself
[1:13:20] to us
[1:13:21] to make us understand who he is
[1:13:25] then names were given and we know by
[1:13:28] god's grace that uh
[1:13:30] when the angel came and um
[1:13:33] gave jesus his name of course that was
[1:13:36] important
[1:13:37] that was really the first
[1:13:40] of of god's name of salvation
[1:13:44] which means jehovah is salvation and
[1:13:47] still yet nobody knows what jehovah
[1:13:49] means
[1:13:52] you understand what i'm saying but we
[1:13:55] know by god's grace that
[1:13:56] this name was given because here god
[1:13:59] wanted you you and i to know him
[1:14:02] not just by character but by name
[1:14:04] because
[1:14:05] because when we say jesus christ we have
[1:14:08] no idea what we're saying amen
[1:14:11] we know it's his name but what's all in
[1:14:14] that name
[1:14:15] he's placed it there he's he's jehovah
[1:14:18] jiren jehovah shalom jehovah tiscanu
[1:14:21] jehovah
[1:14:22] i mean you know he's basically saying in
[1:14:25] my name
[1:14:26] i'll be to you whatever you want me to
[1:14:30] be
[1:14:31] or whatever you need me to be
[1:14:34] now i'm saying these things for a
[1:14:35] purpose because if you can understand
[1:14:38] him
[1:14:38] then you'll understand what that is in
[1:14:41] you we call
[1:14:43] the mind of jesus christ
[1:14:46] see it unfolds into to a place where you
[1:14:49] have to hold your head because you can't
[1:14:51] you can't grasp the the the the
[1:14:55] how can i say it the omnip
[1:14:58] the omnipotence of it how great it is
[1:15:02] the powerful name of jesus christ is now
[1:15:05] you it's in you it's your mind
[1:15:08] and that's why the scripture says is
[1:15:11] there anything too
[1:15:12] hard for god absolutely he's god
[1:15:17] what and i'm saying he's in you amen
[1:15:22] that's why the word of god says greater
[1:15:24] is he that is in you that is
[1:15:26] than he that is in the world then when
[1:15:28] you can see that
[1:15:30] all things become possible
[1:15:34] we talk about staying in that
[1:15:37] heavenly places not on earth though we
[1:15:41] be on earth we stand in heaven
[1:15:43] right right so we understand by god's
[1:15:47] grace paul says i
[1:15:48] i cease not to give thanks for you
[1:15:50] making mention of you in my
[1:15:52] prayer that the god of our lord jesus
[1:15:53] christ the father of glory
[1:15:55] may give unto you the spirit of wisdom
[1:15:59] what is wisdom solomon said i've tried
[1:16:02] everything
[1:16:03] he said i can't come to the conclusion
[1:16:06] fear god
[1:16:07] amen and keep his commandment now this
[1:16:10] fear god doesn't mean like oh i'm scared
[1:16:12] of him
[1:16:12] but it's to reverence him to reverence
[1:16:15] god
[1:16:16] and keep his commandments and i'm coming
[1:16:18] to that in just a moment because i want
[1:16:20] you to understand by god's grace
[1:16:23] this what we we so need
[1:16:26] is the answer to every problem
[1:16:30] amen what is that brother brooks
[1:16:33] divine love because that's who god
[1:16:37] is it conquers everything
[1:16:40] it answers everything it it is god
[1:16:45] and divine love is not something you can
[1:16:47] give yourself
[1:16:48] it's nothing that you can practice it is
[1:16:52] a gift of god
[1:16:53] it's when god chooses you right like
[1:16:56] brother
[1:16:57] said it's not you choosing god it's god
[1:16:59] choosing you
[1:17:01] he chose you you didn't choose him
[1:17:06] oh i found jesus you didn't find him he
[1:17:09] found you
[1:17:10] he never was lost and so when we can
[1:17:13] find
[1:17:14] and understand that this thing has
[1:17:17] always been about love and grace
[1:17:20] it does something to you it puts you on
[1:17:23] a higher level
[1:17:24] of understanding when you read the
[1:17:27] scriptures you understand
[1:17:28] really what he's doing you know we see
[1:17:31] when he says
[1:17:32] go in there and kill everything you know
[1:17:34] they used to get mean what you mean kill
[1:17:36] babies children
[1:17:37] and but we understand now by the word of
[1:17:39] god that what he was talking about
[1:17:41] killing
[1:17:42] was not of his
[1:17:46] you ask a person well most normal people
[1:17:48] are afraid of snakes
[1:17:49] and you ask a person if you saw a snake
[1:17:51] would you kill him
[1:17:52] yes let's go on so i just want you to
[1:17:56] understand by god's grace god knows
[1:17:59] those that are snakes
[1:18:02] right now the bible says and what is the
[1:18:05] exceeding he wants
[1:18:06] our eyes of understanding to be
[1:18:09] enlightened that means revelate it
[1:18:14] can i say this you cannot die
[1:18:20] amen you know and most people are afraid
[1:18:23] of sicknesses because
[1:18:25] they're afraid to die but if you can get
[1:18:28] rid of the fear of death
[1:18:29] you can conquer the sickness hallelujah
[1:18:33] and you gotta understand enlightened
[1:18:36] that means
[1:18:37] i'm not just a man but i'm a god man
[1:18:42] made in the image and likeness of god
[1:18:45] and everything that he is i am
[1:18:49] in this world that's what it says as he
[1:18:51] is so are we
[1:18:52] in this world what do you mean as he is
[1:18:56] we can't even comprehend as he is
[1:19:00] he's unlimited basically let's say like
[1:19:03] that
[1:19:04] god is unlimited in his power in his
[1:19:06] strength and listen people
[1:19:09] there there is no competition
[1:19:12] satan can't compete with god there is no
[1:19:15] competition
[1:19:16] and this is why god had to put us here
[1:19:19] in such a way that
[1:19:22] through this battle satan could have
[1:19:24] something to battle
[1:19:26] could you imagine an angel
[1:19:29] called lucifer trying to defeat god who
[1:19:32] created him
[1:19:33] and god had to condescend down to an
[1:19:36] earthly
[1:19:37] way of living in order to battle
[1:19:40] what we call lucifer who's supposed to
[1:19:43] be the great one
[1:19:45] and then and then even in that
[1:19:48] he conquered the devil conquer death
[1:19:51] hell
[1:19:52] and the grave i'm saying all these
[1:19:55] things because we're getting ready to
[1:19:57] embrace the greatest darkness
[1:20:00] that has ever hit the earth and you must
[1:20:03] know
[1:20:04] who you are you got to know it
[1:20:08] it can't be something oh i think i'm
[1:20:10] saying no you got to go beyond
[1:20:12] i think i'm saved you got to understand
[1:20:14] the person that's in you
[1:20:16] and you've got to understand that now
[1:20:18] that i'm in the spirit of god
[1:20:20] i am as god is not that i did it i
[1:20:23] didn't do it he did it
[1:20:25] amen he made me who i am
[1:20:28] and i want to honor him with what he's
[1:20:30] made me
[1:20:31] and this is where god is looking for his
[1:20:34] bride
[1:20:35] eve dishonored her husband hallelujah
[1:20:38] but this one
[1:20:39] will not dishonor her husband she will
[1:20:41] honor him in every word
[1:20:45] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:20:50] hallelujah look what the bible says and
[1:20:53] say he says
[1:20:54] listen and what is the exceeding
[1:20:57] greatness of his power to us
[1:21:00] what who believe according to the
[1:21:03] working
[1:21:03] of his mighty power
[1:21:07] you can't even believe without his
[1:21:09] mighty power
[1:21:10] which he wrought in christ when he
[1:21:13] raised him from the dead and set him at
[1:21:14] his own
[1:21:15] right hand in heavenly places now i know
[1:21:18] everybody think that
[1:21:20] jesus christ is sitting right here you
[1:21:21] know on the right hand but we must
[1:21:23] understand
[1:21:25] jesus christ is the temple of god
[1:21:29] amen amen right
[1:21:32] and the father who we call the spirit
[1:21:38] is the spirit
[1:21:42] so we must work with the dimensions we
[1:21:45] work with dimensions where god amen
[1:21:48] dimension where he dwells
[1:21:51] hallelujah and that setting on the right
[1:21:54] hand means that
[1:21:55] he is the authority and power of god
[1:21:59] what we call the logos what we call amen
[1:22:02] the people of fire
[1:22:03] is the authority and power of god
[1:22:07] that's who he is because he is god
[1:22:10] hallelujah
[1:22:15] far above all principalities and power
[1:22:17] might and dominion
[1:22:18] every name that is named not only in
[1:22:20] this world
[1:22:21] but also in that which is to come now
[1:22:23] what let me read this again
[1:22:25] which he wrought in christ when he
[1:22:26] raised him from the dead and set him at
[1:22:28] his own right hand
[1:22:30] in heavenly places far above
[1:22:32] principalities y'all understand me
[1:22:36] and power and might and dominion and
[1:22:39] every name that is named not only in
[1:22:42] this world
[1:22:43] but also in that which is to come it
[1:22:46] don't stop
[1:22:48] it doesn't stop you know it's not like
[1:22:51] god
[1:22:51] creates something here and it's over no
[1:22:54] what he's creating here now goes beyond
[1:22:58] this dimension
[1:22:59] into the next it doesn't stop
[1:23:05] god doesn't produce perfection and then
[1:23:07] set it on the shelf
[1:23:09] there's more work to be done
[1:23:12] but the beauty of it is that we'll it'll
[1:23:14] be absence of satan in his people
[1:23:18] there be no evil there there'll be no
[1:23:20] darkness there there be
[1:23:21] nothing to hinder can you imagine
[1:23:25] amen hallelujah
[1:23:28] and people would say you know i heard
[1:23:32] this
[1:23:33] young man say somebody was witness to
[1:23:35] him says
[1:23:36] wouldn't you like eternal life he's oh
[1:23:38] no
[1:23:39] he said to live eternally would be
[1:23:40] boring
[1:23:43] well he doesn't have to worry about it
[1:23:45] to live in hell will never be boring
[1:23:49] it'll be such a way that he wish he had
[1:23:52] had answered correctly to
[1:23:56] that question yes i want eternal life
[1:24:01] what it is about jesus that nobody wants
[1:24:04] him
[1:24:06] and it so amazes me here it is the god
[1:24:08] who created you
[1:24:09] and you don't want to meet him you say
[1:24:12] he's dead and yet he's alive
[1:24:14] in your own intellect you just don't
[1:24:16] want to receive remember
[1:24:17] the bible said they did not want to
[1:24:19] contain god in their knowledge
[1:24:21] and because they didn't want to hold him
[1:24:23] there he gave them a strong delusion
[1:24:25] that they would be a
[1:24:27] leave a lie and be condemned by it so
[1:24:29] they're
[1:24:30] god don't put them in hell you did that
[1:24:33] you
[1:24:34] you chose to go to hell by refusing to
[1:24:36] acknowledge that he is god
[1:24:39] but look at this but god who is rich in
[1:24:42] mercy
[1:24:44] for his great love wherewith he loved us
[1:24:47] i'm coming to the love i'm coming
[1:24:49] you see let me tell you something
[1:24:51] prophecy in itself
[1:24:54] is the love of god amen
[1:24:57] prophecy of himself when god prophesies
[1:24:59] something
[1:25:00] and tells you what is going to happen in
[1:25:02] the future
[1:25:03] that is his love and his way of warning
[1:25:06] us to stay away from his judgments
[1:25:10] right he even tells us you know if you
[1:25:13] stay in that system
[1:25:15] out there you're going to receive of her
[1:25:18] plagues
[1:25:19] come out of her my people that you be
[1:25:21] not partakers of her plagues
[1:25:24] and what are we dealing with now plagues
[1:25:28] hallelujah let's move on even when we
[1:25:32] were dead and sins have quickened us
[1:25:34] together with christ
[1:25:36] listen this is what i want everybody to
[1:25:38] hear and see
[1:25:39] because now i understand
[1:25:43] by grace are you saved
[1:25:45] [Laughter]
[1:25:47] you know that's a powerful revelation
[1:25:51] because it can't be law and grace at the
[1:25:53] same time by grace
[1:25:55] are you saved
[1:25:58] and have raised us up together and made
[1:26:02] us
[1:26:02] sit together in heavenly places in
[1:26:06] christ jesus the atmosphere
[1:26:09] the anointing the person we're setting
[1:26:13] in him he's in us and we are in him
[1:26:19] that in the ages to come he might show
[1:26:21] the exceedingly riches
[1:26:23] of his grace in his kindness toward us
[1:26:26] through
[1:26:26] christ jesus he's not angry
[1:26:31] he's not upset
[1:26:34] at his seed and at his children
[1:26:38] he's not just ready to throw you in hell
[1:26:40] every time you make a mistake
[1:26:42] that's what the blood of jesus is all
[1:26:44] about
[1:26:45] that's what grace is all about when they
[1:26:48] whipped him
[1:26:49] all night long i said like that i don't
[1:26:51] know how long they whipped him but when
[1:26:53] they
[1:26:53] whipped him and beat him to a pump
[1:26:55] almost
[1:26:57] it was for you it was for me
[1:27:00] he received your stripes and by his
[1:27:04] stripes we are healed
[1:27:07] you understand me that's what it's all
[1:27:09] about
[1:27:10] this message like i said denomination
[1:27:13] and organizations perverted it
[1:27:15] they they wanted to keep the people in
[1:27:17] control so they took the word of god and
[1:27:19] used the word of god as
[1:27:21] to bring laws do's and don'ts and paul
[1:27:24] says no no
[1:27:25] no touch not taste not handling that
[1:27:26] we're beyond that
[1:27:28] see what i'm saying because even the
[1:27:30] jews couldn't keep the law
[1:27:32] right and so we we look at this and now
[1:27:35] you say well what do you mean
[1:27:36] we got to understand that the holy ghost
[1:27:39] is given to you so you can love him
[1:27:41] god is not a slave master
[1:27:45] he's not one that's trying to make you
[1:27:47] serve him
[1:27:48] or make you love him it mean it must be
[1:27:51] something you are willing to do
[1:27:54] because if you willingly love him you
[1:27:57] will keep his commandments
[1:28:00] amen hallelujah is that the truth
[1:28:03] that's exactly right it's never been
[1:28:05] what we thought it was
[1:28:07] because i told you earlier this morning
[1:28:09] there's a difference between conforming
[1:28:12] and transforming you know to conform
[1:28:16] your way
[1:28:17] of life is to just really pattern it
[1:28:20] imitate it
[1:28:21] but transform means that the life is
[1:28:23] there to change you
[1:28:25] and this is what god wants he wants a
[1:28:27] changed life
[1:28:28] he wants his life in you that's what i'm
[1:28:30] saying nobody will be without excuse
[1:28:33] because he's willing to give you the
[1:28:35] holy ghost
[1:28:36] more than you desire to have it he's
[1:28:38] willing to give you the holy ghost
[1:28:40] but what keeps the people from getting
[1:28:42] the holy ghost is their approach
[1:28:46] you can't come to god offering in
[1:28:48] anything or promising him
[1:28:49] anything because whatever you give him
[1:28:52] is something he gave you
[1:28:54] the thing that god wants is your heart
[1:28:56] and he wants you to surrender that
[1:28:59] amen amen and once you surrender your
[1:29:02] heart
[1:29:02] god comes in it ain't hard it's not
[1:29:05] complicated
[1:29:06] it's surrendering to god says lord just
[1:29:09] as i
[1:29:10] am like i said this morning i don't have
[1:29:12] nothing to give you
[1:29:15] my life has been a wreck but if you can
[1:29:18] you can accept my heart if you can
[1:29:20] accept this wreck and you can change
[1:29:22] this wreck this is what i want to do
[1:29:24] change me oh god and god that's all he
[1:29:27] wants to hear that's what he wants to
[1:29:29] hear
[1:29:29] he wants to hear that kind of a prayer
[1:29:32] and when you give god i
[1:29:33] promise you there's no way you can pray
[1:29:35] that to god and god stand back and says
[1:29:37] i need a little bit more from you
[1:29:39] no it never has been works
[1:29:42] it has always been grace and to come
[1:29:45] that far in god
[1:29:46] is because god has been pulling on you
[1:29:49] amen is that right
[1:29:52] he have raised us up together and made
[1:29:55] us sit together in heavenly places in
[1:29:57] christ jesus what are you saying
[1:29:58] when i give my heart to god immediately
[1:30:02] i am in christ
[1:30:04] immediately i'm setting in christ
[1:30:08] in heavenly places for by grace you are
[1:30:11] saying
[1:30:11] through faith that none of yourself it
[1:30:14] is what
[1:30:15] the gift of god not a works
[1:30:18] lest any man should boast and this is
[1:30:20] why some people take it
[1:30:22] to the calvinistic way i guess i'm saved
[1:30:24] by grace so i can just do what i want to
[1:30:27] no there's a balance to it right
[1:30:30] and the balance is because i am saved i
[1:30:33] want to do all
[1:30:34] i can do to love him and to live right
[1:30:37] and do whatever he wants to do whatever
[1:30:38] his word requires
[1:30:39] this is what i want and understand this
[1:30:41] this is the part i like
[1:30:45] when jesus steps in to you
[1:30:48] in his fullness he literally
[1:30:51] lives through you
[1:30:55] there is no my i can take this jacket
[1:30:57] off and lay it right there
[1:30:59] and it will stay there but when i take
[1:31:03] this jacket and i put it on i become the
[1:31:05] life of the jacket
[1:31:07] and wherever i go the jacket goes with
[1:31:09] me
[1:31:10] whatever i do as long as i got the
[1:31:12] jacket on
[1:31:14] it goes with me you understand this is
[1:31:16] how the holy ghost wants to
[1:31:18] operate in us he wants us to become
[1:31:20] justice jacket
[1:31:22] amen so he can walk through us talk to
[1:31:24] us and live through us
[1:31:25] don't you want that amen if if it makes
[1:31:28] me a fanatic so
[1:31:30] be it but let god the fullness of god
[1:31:34] live through us this is what he's
[1:31:35] working with now i'm coming to something
[1:31:39] i said uh we talk about love
[1:31:42] because see the bible said we are his
[1:31:44] workmanship
[1:31:46] created in christ jesus unto good works
[1:31:49] so understand he's working on us
[1:31:54] i wish you know many times i wish it was
[1:31:57] zip
[1:31:59] it would all happen at one time but
[1:32:01] you'll miss the most important parts
[1:32:03] of god if it happened that way you can't
[1:32:06] appreciate summer until you go through
[1:32:08] winter
[1:32:09] you know all those sim all those seasons
[1:32:11] must come
[1:32:12] in order for you to appreciate the whole
[1:32:14] year right
[1:32:18] so that's how it is with god he has the
[1:32:20] seasons in our lives
[1:32:21] so he can reflect himself in some way
[1:32:25] right we might look at all them and we
[1:32:26] said my goodness you know the all the
[1:32:28] leaves are falling and
[1:32:30] the leaves but autumn they tell me it's
[1:32:32] the most beautiful season
[1:32:34] of them all it is the more remote the
[1:32:37] most realistic
[1:32:38] of all seasons because they say in the
[1:32:42] summertime you got all this green
[1:32:44] in there but that though the green is
[1:32:47] not the real color of the trees
[1:32:50] it's only when they're dying and
[1:32:52] remember brother branham says
[1:32:54] which is more beautiful the green tree
[1:32:57] or when it's dying
[1:32:59] and the colors and the shades it turns
[1:33:01] it becomes the glory of that tree
[1:33:04] and so that's how it is with the
[1:33:05] christian right
[1:33:07] it's when the christian is dying is when
[1:33:09] you see the beauty and the glory
[1:33:11] of what he really or she really is
[1:33:14] and god through these seasons shows us
[1:33:16] all these things
[1:33:17] the thing that i love about this
[1:33:20] is that we were in the tree
[1:33:24] of life from the foundation
[1:33:27] of the world where we're in him
[1:33:30] like we were in adam we were also in the
[1:33:33] tree of life remember
[1:33:37] there must be a male and a female
[1:33:39] american
[1:33:42] the power of love brother banham said it
[1:33:44] like this in the
[1:33:45] bombing gilead he says notice what he
[1:33:48] told me
[1:33:49] i've always believed and always believed
[1:33:52] that the power of love exceeds speaking
[1:33:56] in tongues
[1:33:56] it exceeds shouting it exceeds
[1:33:59] everything that i know of
[1:34:01] it has always been my
[1:34:04] theme always
[1:34:07] because this agape love he's speaking of
[1:34:11] is the holy ghost
[1:34:14] hallelujah so what are you saying now
[1:34:16] i'm coming down to to this portion of
[1:34:18] clothes but
[1:34:20] you know large will and wednesday we'll
[1:34:22] pick it up
[1:34:23] we're coming to the breaking of the day
[1:34:27] y'all know what i mean by that i'm not
[1:34:29] at the end of it i'm just saying i'm
[1:34:31] switching over
[1:34:32] so you can understand that love conquers
[1:34:35] all this battle that we're getting ready
[1:34:38] to embrace
[1:34:39] will only be conquered by way of love
[1:34:43] right so if you can't love your brother
[1:34:46] how are you going to love your enemy
[1:34:48] and we're not talking about filial love
[1:34:50] fill your love will fail you
[1:34:52] it's jealous it it just you can't it's
[1:34:54] unpredictable
[1:34:56] but god paid love is the only
[1:35:00] thing that can't be defeated
[1:35:05] tongues will cease prophecy will cease
[1:35:09] all will cease but the word of the lord
[1:35:12] shall stand
[1:35:14] and that word of the lord is love divine
[1:35:17] love he said watch now scripture isaiah
[1:35:20] was when he said
[1:35:22] watchman what of the night
[1:35:26] he said the watchman the morning cometh
[1:35:28] and the night also
[1:35:29] what morning comes but the night comes
[1:35:33] before the morning
[1:35:34] what was it anyone knows that just
[1:35:37] before the break of day
[1:35:40] just at the hours of the approaching of
[1:35:42] the day
[1:35:43] it turns darker than it
[1:35:46] ever was
[1:35:51] what we're seeing now is the gathering
[1:35:54] of the darkness
[1:35:56] and it's going to get darker but
[1:35:59] understand
[1:36:01] just as it gets is darkest
[1:36:05] that's when the light breaks he said oh
[1:36:08] my friend
[1:36:09] listen to thus said the lord listen he
[1:36:11] said listen to
[1:36:13] thus saith the lord so it can't fail
[1:36:16] if you consider me to be his servant
[1:36:18] it's just before the break of day
[1:36:21] that's why this horrible gloom
[1:36:25] is over the earth it's just before the
[1:36:28] coming of the lord jesus
[1:36:30] there's no more hope left it's nothing
[1:36:34] but but it's coming nations are against
[1:36:37] nations they have food uh food through
[1:36:40] god's
[1:36:41] laboratory till they got the power to
[1:36:43] blow one another
[1:36:44] into atomic ashes and they are wicked
[1:36:48] hello he said and they are wicked
[1:36:52] and they are unreligious and they are
[1:36:55] unchrist-like and the only motive they
[1:36:59] have
[1:36:59] an objective is to destroy
[1:37:04] they've been ordained to destroy
[1:37:08] and they are inspired by this
[1:37:11] destroying angel that was sent from
[1:37:14] heaven to inspire
[1:37:16] these men so how are you going gonna
[1:37:19] stop it
[1:37:21] can't be stopped that's why they're
[1:37:23] doing what they're doing you say
[1:37:24] it seem like they're crazy why are they
[1:37:26] doing this because they've been ordained
[1:37:29] to destroy
[1:37:31] let me say in the name of the lord jesus
[1:37:34] the holy spirit is sent as a watchman on
[1:37:38] the tower
[1:37:39] and as the people cry what of the night
[1:37:42] are you weary in this life are you weary
[1:37:45] of sin
[1:37:46] are you weary of funeral processions and
[1:37:49] sickness
[1:37:49] and ungodliness on every hand has the
[1:37:52] night been so
[1:37:53] been long and weary what of the night
[1:37:56] watchman
[1:37:57] he said the morning's coming
[1:38:00] see the comfort he says and the night is
[1:38:04] also coming what is the night
[1:38:07] look how in perfect harmony with the
[1:38:09] scripture
[1:38:10] as there was in the regular course of
[1:38:13] nature
[1:38:14] always that the approaching of the sun
[1:38:17] congeals the darkness together and makes
[1:38:20] it dark
[1:38:21] you understand me it is the approaching
[1:38:24] of the sun
[1:38:25] we're not talking about the s you in
[1:38:27] right now we're talking about the s-o-n
[1:38:30] it is approaching of the sun and because
[1:38:33] these dark spirits know that something
[1:38:35] is happening
[1:38:36] they're bringing themselves together and
[1:38:38] what they come to do crucify the lord
[1:38:41] and his christ
[1:38:43] everybody that truly believed in god
[1:38:46] this is what satan is this is a warfare
[1:38:48] folks
[1:38:51] watch that thing gonna turn people don't
[1:38:54] don't know that but christians will be
[1:38:56] persecuted
[1:38:57] in this country in the regular course of
[1:39:00] nature
[1:39:01] always the approaching of the sun
[1:39:03] congealed the darkness together and
[1:39:05] makes it dark
[1:39:06] it's darker before day
[1:39:09] than any other time in the night why
[1:39:12] it's the approaching light
[1:39:14] that making it's dark and it's the
[1:39:17] approaching of the lord jesus
[1:39:19] now that's bringing this gloom upon the
[1:39:22] earth
[1:39:23] amen and who can say there ain't gloom
[1:39:25] it's gloom everywhere
[1:39:27] amen it is approaching of this gloom
[1:39:30] right
[1:39:31] uh it's approaching of the lord jesus
[1:39:33] now that's bringing this gloom upon the
[1:39:35] earth
[1:39:36] did not he say when these things began
[1:39:39] to come to pass
[1:39:40] lift up your head for your redemption
[1:39:43] draw with night
[1:39:45] that's what i'm talking about love is
[1:39:47] love stretched
[1:39:48] his hand through time to this
[1:39:51] 2020 to tell me that when you see the
[1:39:55] gloom
[1:39:56] when you see the world in this condition
[1:39:58] i'm here
[1:39:59] i'm on my way light the light is about
[1:40:03] to break hallelujah
[1:40:04] the rapture is at hand this is not no
[1:40:07] hope so
[1:40:08] this is a no soul this is a dust said
[1:40:10] the lord
[1:40:11] it cannot fail amen
[1:40:14] think about it when john the baptist
[1:40:17] came
[1:40:19] god said he laid the axe to the root of
[1:40:21] the tree
[1:40:22] why because it was a time
[1:40:25] that the tree was supposed to bring
[1:40:27] forth fruit
[1:40:28] and all i could think about is this time
[1:40:31] is the bride really bringing forth fruit
[1:40:34] you understand me those who are called
[1:40:35] bride where is the fruit of
[1:40:38] of of of right and so you got to
[1:40:42] understand i heard him say
[1:40:43] you know this is wintering time now the
[1:40:45] prophet said this is wintering time the
[1:40:47] harvest basically over
[1:40:48] you know everything is being selected
[1:40:50] and now it's being separated
[1:40:53] and the winds of of destruction the
[1:40:55] winds of of differences are now blowing
[1:40:58] this chaff away and
[1:41:01] all he's going to have left is seed this
[1:41:04] is what god is now doing
[1:41:05] he's literally getting the seed people
[1:41:08] don't even know
[1:41:09] they can sit in church and be dead
[1:41:16] here is in my father glorified see this
[1:41:19] is so important
[1:41:20] it's one of those things that we
[1:41:21] overlook all the time he says here is my
[1:41:24] father glorified
[1:41:26] that ye bear much fruit so shall ye be
[1:41:30] my disciples as the father have loved me
[1:41:33] so have i loved you continue in my love
[1:41:38] if i keep if you keep my commandments
[1:41:41] you shall abide in my love even as i
[1:41:43] have kept my father's commandments
[1:41:46] and abide in his love you know what
[1:41:48] about me it means to live there
[1:41:50] that's your residence amen these things
[1:41:53] i've spoken unto you that
[1:41:55] my joy might remain in you and that your
[1:41:58] joy
[1:41:59] might be full right his joy
[1:42:02] might remain in us and that joy
[1:42:06] might be full i want it to be full
[1:42:09] yes i heard somebody say let it run over
[1:42:13] let the cup run over amen this is my
[1:42:16] commandment that you love one another
[1:42:18] as i've loved you we miss it
[1:42:23] we read it and we take an intellectual
[1:42:25] concept of it
[1:42:27] and then we take this little perverted
[1:42:29] love we think
[1:42:30] is love and we try to give it to each
[1:42:32] other and it doesn't work
[1:42:34] it's beyond that the love he's talking
[1:42:37] about can only be found in the holy
[1:42:38] ghost
[1:42:40] it's beyond that this love amen is is
[1:42:42] not puffed up it it
[1:42:44] it's not looking for rewards it's not
[1:42:46] looking to be recognized other than it
[1:42:48] is love
[1:42:51] greater love have no man than this than
[1:42:54] a le
[1:42:55] a man would lay down his life for his
[1:42:57] friend and ye
[1:42:58] are my friends if you do whatsoever i
[1:43:01] command you
[1:43:03] henceforth i call you not servant for
[1:43:05] the servant knoweth not
[1:43:06] what his law doeth but i have called you
[1:43:09] friend
[1:43:10] for all things that i've heard of my
[1:43:12] father i have made known unto you
[1:43:14] now we are the only generation that i
[1:43:18] know of that have received everything
[1:43:22] from the father and when those seals
[1:43:26] were open that means if we can hear that
[1:43:28] he's no longer calling us servants but
[1:43:30] we are friends
[1:43:32] god is our friend right listen what he
[1:43:35] goes on to say
[1:43:37] hallelujah he says i have made you unto
[1:43:40] you
[1:43:41] ye have not chosen me but i have chosen
[1:43:44] you
[1:43:45] and ordained you that ye should go
[1:43:48] and bring forth fruit and that your
[1:43:51] fruit shall remain
[1:43:53] that whatsoever ye ask of the father in
[1:43:56] my name
[1:43:56] he may give it you these things i've
[1:43:59] commanded you that ye love one another
[1:44:02] you understand me he he literally
[1:44:05] places so much emphasis on us loving one
[1:44:08] another as he's loved us
[1:44:10] now it seemed to be in the natural if
[1:44:14] you think with the carnal mind
[1:44:16] how can that be god has forgiven me
[1:44:20] i don't know how many times i've seen
[1:44:23] how many times i've made a mistake there
[1:44:25] there is it's
[1:44:26] innumerable and he's never had an
[1:44:29] attitude
[1:44:31] he you understand me he's never
[1:44:34] but in the natural we might have one at
[1:44:36] times
[1:44:38] but that ain't the kind of love he
[1:44:39] talking about he talked about love that
[1:44:41] supersedes that
[1:44:42] he's talking about the kind of love that
[1:44:43] you are dead to you're dead to yourself
[1:44:46] you understand i'm i'm i'm thinking
[1:44:48] higher now i'm thinking higher
[1:44:50] what i'm saying is what god has given us
[1:44:53] god has given us grace
[1:44:54] to live on the level that we've lived on
[1:44:56] now it's time to go higher
[1:44:58] it's higher in our thinking loving more
[1:45:02] there's no limit to our love no
[1:45:04] restraint to it
[1:45:06] you understand me see it
[1:45:10] that's what that song oh the love of god
[1:45:13] how rich
[1:45:13] how pure you know people don't come to
[1:45:16] church because they
[1:45:18] don't love god like they think they do
[1:45:23] they don't you got people right now who
[1:45:26] should be here
[1:45:28] out there fellowshipping around chicken
[1:45:32] or fish that's true
[1:45:35] but they love god no way
[1:45:39] no way your love is not sufficient
[1:45:42] we're working with agape love brother
[1:45:44] brahma said
[1:45:45] a true believer if they really got the
[1:45:48] holy ghost
[1:45:49] they can't hardly wait till those doors
[1:45:51] are open
[1:45:53] you know what and he said not only that
[1:45:55] they love each other so much too
[1:45:57] it almost bring them tear to tears to
[1:45:59] separate
[1:46:00] from one another i haven't seen that in
[1:46:03] years
[1:46:04] i've seen it where people just crying
[1:46:07] because
[1:46:08] the meeting is over and they don't want
[1:46:10] to go back to their separate
[1:46:12] homes but you got to understand what
[1:46:16] what this preparation for this is a
[1:46:18] preparation for the city to come
[1:46:20] amen i'm in the city
[1:46:24] are you in the city i'm a stone in the
[1:46:26] city
[1:46:27] and i'm in the city oh somebody help me
[1:46:30] here amen and i showed you that this
[1:46:34] love is so great
[1:46:35] that he just didn't engage himself to us
[1:46:38] but he says listen i'm going away to
[1:46:41] prepare a place for you
[1:46:43] that where i am there you may be also
[1:46:46] right he said and in my father's house
[1:46:48] there are many mentions you'll never
[1:46:50] have to worry about being lonely
[1:46:52] hallelujah you'll never have to worry
[1:46:54] about having fellowship
[1:46:56] hallelujah because there's a many
[1:46:57] mentions there
[1:46:59] and if it wasn't so i would not have
[1:47:00] told you now
[1:47:02] understand god does not make promises
[1:47:06] and not keep them amen
[1:47:10] i told you about how this morning we
[1:47:12] look at things in ways that we shouldn't
[1:47:14] look at them
[1:47:15] uh but uh you gotta understand that when
[1:47:18] you're thinking higher
[1:47:20] and you you do anything to achieve
[1:47:23] what god wants you to achieve
[1:47:26] and um you you think about uh
[1:47:30] tamar you know she she wasn't
[1:47:35] she may have been one rejected
[1:47:38] her husband died her brother-in-law's
[1:47:41] who should have married her
[1:47:43] rejected her i mean and then her
[1:47:46] father-in-law rejected her too
[1:47:48] but she knew there was something on the
[1:47:50] inside of her
[1:47:51] that made her know that she was supposed
[1:47:54] to be a part of this
[1:47:56] regardless who she was she wasn't even a
[1:47:59] jew
[1:48:01] but she knew and she went after the
[1:48:04] thing that meant the most to her
[1:48:07] i must get that seed she understood the
[1:48:10] law
[1:48:11] better than judah
[1:48:16] and guess what people like you've heard
[1:48:18] me say before
[1:48:19] she disguised herself like a prostitute
[1:48:26] she covered her face and he just assumed
[1:48:28] she was a prostitute
[1:48:30] and she went on to do what she did and
[1:48:33] guess what
[1:48:34] how many times men and women come
[1:48:36] together and don't conceive
[1:48:39] but this time god was in it
[1:48:42] and she conceived
[1:48:45] and she was willing to take the approach
[1:48:48] you know what it was like in israel
[1:48:50] if you was caught as an unfaithful woman
[1:48:52] or a holland
[1:48:53] and then they would stone you and she
[1:48:56] says okay
[1:48:57] let the man who wants to stone me
[1:49:00] identify these items
[1:49:03] she if she had only gotten the lamb when
[1:49:05] she had already the grace of god with
[1:49:06] her
[1:49:07] the lamb would have been eaten up
[1:49:09] whatever but no give me your sickness
[1:49:11] give me your staff in other words give
[1:49:13] me your the things that represent your
[1:49:15] character
[1:49:16] give it to me and when judah saw that he
[1:49:20] was just
[1:49:20] overwhelmed you are a more righteous
[1:49:24] woman
[1:49:25] than i am a righteous man you understand
[1:49:28] what i'm saying
[1:49:28] what am i trying to say the bride in
[1:49:32] this hour
[1:49:33] will do whatever it takes
[1:49:37] to get impregnated
[1:49:41] with the promise she do whatever it
[1:49:44] takes
[1:49:46] for that seed to be made manifested in
[1:49:48] her
[1:49:49] she doesn't care about what other people
[1:49:51] thinks she understand that if she had to
[1:49:53] go to the judgment
[1:49:54] it will not stand you see what i'm
[1:49:56] saying
[1:49:57] because she understand that the seed she
[1:50:00] got
[1:50:01] was from the man himself all right
[1:50:04] so you say well what do you mean so god
[1:50:07] gives you a view
[1:50:09] of this listen
[1:50:12] for a man to be lost it is something
[1:50:15] that he
[1:50:16] like brother said he he he chases after
[1:50:19] god warns us all the time
[1:50:22] right he yeah but we have to keep
[1:50:25] rejecting him keep rejecting
[1:50:26] there'll be nobody i don't care who they
[1:50:29] are would be able to say god you didn't
[1:50:31] give me a fair
[1:50:32] chance god is not like that especially
[1:50:35] in america
[1:50:38] yeah so you got to understand there'll
[1:50:40] be no excuses in that day
[1:50:42] so i'm coming on to to where i want to
[1:50:44] go
[1:50:47] second kings and i'm a close on that
[1:50:51] second kings 2 11 15.
[1:50:54] i'm jumping but i'll close on this
[1:50:58] i think i i came here the last service
[1:51:00] but i want to leave
[1:51:01] back on this leave uh out on this excuse
[1:51:05] me
[1:51:10] this message is so great
[1:51:14] and the more i see the love of god
[1:51:18] and how he's reached out to me
[1:51:22] i can't even i can't even
[1:51:26] i don't know how there are no words to
[1:51:29] worship him right now
[1:51:30] hallelujah seemed like it's just not
[1:51:32] good enough
[1:51:34] but because
[1:51:38] realistically i know i deserve hell
[1:51:44] realistically i look back my on my
[1:51:48] christian walk and i'm ashamed
[1:51:55] so many things left out so many things
[1:51:58] could have been done
[1:52:00] but you know there was too much me
[1:52:04] my works and my desires and all of that
[1:52:07] you know you can do things and you can
[1:52:10] be anointed
[1:52:12] and it's still not the will of god
[1:52:15] david took that arc and he put it on on
[1:52:18] a cart
[1:52:18] with all that anointing with all that of
[1:52:20] pentecostal parading he went on
[1:52:23] and he was out of the will of god that's
[1:52:24] the scary part
[1:52:28] that's why the bible says acknowledge
[1:52:30] the lord in all your ways and he shall
[1:52:31] direct your path
[1:52:33] we you know we must begin to live like
[1:52:36] we have no head other than jesus christ
[1:52:40] how can you love god and not love his
[1:52:42] word but in his second king second
[1:52:44] chapter
[1:52:46] and it came to pass as they still went
[1:52:49] on
[1:52:50] and talked that behold there appeared
[1:52:54] a chariot of fire and horses of fire
[1:52:58] and parted them both asunder and elijah
[1:53:01] went up
[1:53:02] by a whirlwind now you heard me say this
[1:53:05] the other night
[1:53:06] the other day i think you did i believe
[1:53:08] i spoke this out to you
[1:53:10] and we liking this as the rapture he was
[1:53:12] caught up
[1:53:14] but watch how the scripture is being
[1:53:18] read
[1:53:19] there appeared a chariot of fire
[1:53:24] and horses of fire
[1:53:28] and parted them both asunder
[1:53:32] and elijah went up by a whirlwind into
[1:53:35] heaven
[1:53:37] it didn't say that elijah went up to in
[1:53:39] into heaven on a chariot
[1:53:41] nor was he riding a horse
[1:53:45] it doesn't say he got on the chariot he
[1:53:47] doesn't he didn't say that
[1:53:49] but whatev but one thing it did say
[1:53:52] is that the horses at the chariot
[1:53:57] open up something
[1:54:00] parted it produced a portal
[1:54:04] and a whirlwind
[1:54:08] elijah up
[1:54:11] i'ma say it again because
[1:54:15] regardless of what it looked like it was
[1:54:16] the pill of fire
[1:54:18] the pill of fire did what it parted
[1:54:22] the red sea it parted
[1:54:26] the jordan it parted
[1:54:30] the heavens and a whirlwind took him up
[1:54:35] now i'm saying this because
[1:54:41] he told elisha if you see me go away
[1:54:46] i'm gonna give you a double portion now
[1:54:48] you know why i'm saying it like this
[1:54:50] because oftentimes we see something that
[1:54:52] is so spiritual looking
[1:54:54] we accept it without examining it to
[1:54:56] make sure it is the word
[1:54:59] right i mean how many of us saw the
[1:55:02] picture of jesus when we were little
[1:55:04] and it wasn't him but if somebody would
[1:55:07] have asked us
[1:55:08] who is that we'll say oh that's jesus
[1:55:12] it wasn't him it was somebody
[1:55:15] forming or taking a picture and acting
[1:55:18] like he was
[1:55:20] and we don't even know whether the man
[1:55:21] who took the picture
[1:55:23] acting like jesus was a christian or not
[1:55:26] but you understand what i'm saying
[1:55:28] instead of examining
[1:55:29] examinating things we take it as people
[1:55:32] picture it
[1:55:34] and we run with it so but now what we
[1:55:38] need to do is to take the scripture and
[1:55:39] says
[1:55:40] okay there was a portal there was a
[1:55:42] doorway
[1:55:44] there's a way god made for us to dem
[1:55:48] dimension to open up and go into
[1:55:51] wherever elijah went
[1:55:55] and understand the same elijah is still
[1:55:58] living
[1:56:00] right because you got to understand that
[1:56:03] when they were on the mount
[1:56:04] transfiguration
[1:56:05] something happened it was a dimensional
[1:56:07] thing
[1:56:09] it's like you watching a tv that
[1:56:11] television set is reflecting a different
[1:56:13] dimension even though you won't decide
[1:56:16] and so what they saw you gotta you gotta
[1:56:19] it said
[1:56:20] it was the appearance it doesn't mean
[1:56:21] that it was actually is
[1:56:23] but whatever it is we know that god
[1:56:26] parted something and opened it up
[1:56:29] and elijah went up into heaven
[1:56:32] so we got to understand that when god
[1:56:34] begins to do something let me tell you
[1:56:35] something
[1:56:36] brother told us something that the world
[1:56:38] laughs at
[1:56:41] he said those same lights those same
[1:56:42] ufos
[1:56:44] he said they are investigating angels
[1:56:47] and he says one day they will pick you
[1:56:50] up
[1:56:53] huh you tell that to somebody where do
[1:56:55] you find that in the scripture
[1:57:00] but what they don't understand is that
[1:57:02] the word of god is taking us higher
[1:57:06] it's beginning to make us see that
[1:57:08] there's life
[1:57:10] beyond this life and our life is
[1:57:13] in that life we're supposed to reflect
[1:57:16] what's on the other side here that's
[1:57:19] what jesus did he said
[1:57:20] the son of man he's standing right here
[1:57:22] but he's still in heaven
[1:57:24] come on dimensions
[1:57:30] they know it's real and he said elijah
[1:57:33] saw it
[1:57:34] and he cried my father my father
[1:57:37] the chariot of israel and the horsemans
[1:57:40] thereof
[1:57:41] and he saw him no more and he took
[1:57:45] hold of his own clothes and rent them
[1:57:48] into pieces
[1:57:50] now remember the first time that elijah
[1:57:52] gave elijah
[1:57:53] amen the garment elijah elisha gave him
[1:57:56] the garment back
[1:57:59] because in reality the garment was too
[1:58:01] big for him to fit
[1:58:05] now watch this he says so you can
[1:58:07] understand
[1:58:09] my father my father the charity of
[1:58:11] israel
[1:58:12] and the horsemen thereof he saw him
[1:58:15] no more and he took hold of his own
[1:58:19] clothes and rent them into two pieces
[1:58:23] something was torn something was rent
[1:58:27] something was opened so that elijah
[1:58:31] could go
[1:58:31] up right now if if
[1:58:34] if uh none of us have seen horsemen
[1:58:37] horsemen fired
[1:58:38] horsemen or fired chariots and and in
[1:58:43] in heaven there could be wherever they
[1:58:46] came from they were there
[1:58:48] right they came here it doesn't say
[1:58:51] elijah god on it it may have
[1:58:53] but it doesn't say that that's what i'm
[1:58:55] trying to say
[1:58:56] what i'm trying to say is that's not so
[1:58:58] much as important as
[1:59:00] the parting the opening
[1:59:03] the separation and here elijah elisha
[1:59:07] rinses clothes what was it now he
[1:59:10] understood
[1:59:11] now it's time for i saw you go
[1:59:14] i saw this rapture because this is what
[1:59:17] the message brings to us
[1:59:18] is the rapture of elijah and it brings
[1:59:22] us amen to a place to show us
[1:59:23] that we will be raptured you know what
[1:59:26] you're saying
[1:59:27] you know you had elijah and you had
[1:59:29] moses
[1:59:30] moses represented old testament saints
[1:59:32] elijah represented the new testament
[1:59:34] saints
[1:59:35] and we're going to be raptured
[1:59:38] but how a portal
[1:59:43] a mystery okay let me let me get you
[1:59:46] something here just a minute just a
[1:59:47] minute
[1:59:49] brother branham says in christ is
[1:59:51] revealed in his own word
[1:59:53] you're going to find out one of these
[1:59:56] days
[1:59:57] that when you go to heaven you don't fly
[2:00:00] off somewhere else
[2:00:04] you don't fly off somewhere else you're
[2:00:06] still
[2:00:07] right here too just in another dimension
[2:00:12] faster than this
[2:00:16] right through this room is coming colors
[2:00:18] every color shirt dress whatever you
[2:00:20] go got on is eternal laying right on
[2:00:24] records
[2:00:24] going around and around the world every
[2:00:28] time you bat your eye
[2:00:29] is right on record watch television will
[2:00:32] prove
[2:00:32] that see
[2:00:36] we think we're going to go billions of
[2:00:38] years away but he says no
[2:00:40] it's just a dimension away
[2:00:44] where did he go when he was caught paul
[2:00:46] said i don't know where i was
[2:00:48] what heaven i was in he said i can't
[2:00:51] tell you whether i was in the body or
[2:00:52] out of the body
[2:00:53] then brother branham comes and says i
[2:00:55] was laying on my bed
[2:00:57] thinking what i'm going to do i haven't
[2:01:00] done nothing for the lord every time i
[2:01:01] hear him say that i'm like
[2:01:03] god you take a microscope to find
[2:01:06] whatever i've done for you
[2:01:08] but then he said justin he stopped
[2:01:10] feeling a little funny and the next
[2:01:12] thing he know he was
[2:01:13] looking down at his face at himself
[2:01:17] and all of a sudden he see millions of
[2:01:19] these people running to him
[2:01:20] he was just right right above like
[2:01:24] rooftop
[2:01:26] but in another dimension in another
[2:01:28] world
[2:01:32] you see but a portal
[2:01:35] of some sort was open to him let me tell
[2:01:38] you something
[2:01:39] even in the seventh seal when those
[2:01:42] seven angels came
[2:01:43] and picked him up he did not go there in
[2:01:46] the flesh
[2:01:49] i don't know how god did it but he said
[2:01:51] those angels picked him up
[2:01:53] there was no air to breathe he would
[2:01:55] have froze to death
[2:01:58] it was space the cloud was
[2:02:01] higher than moisture could even exist in
[2:02:05] but he was caught up he said he was and
[2:02:08] i believe it
[2:02:09] i don't understand all of these
[2:02:11] dimensional things but i do know
[2:02:14] that we're now sitting in heavenly
[2:02:16] places
[2:02:17] in christ jesus hallelujah
[2:02:20] you love the lord i'm just going to stop
[2:02:23] here
[2:02:24] i'll continue i'm not done
[2:02:27] because i i just kind of
[2:02:30] if paul is trying to get us to see who
[2:02:33] we really are
[2:02:34] in ephesians he's telling us and we've
[2:02:36] been ordained
[2:02:38] and then he tells us you know not only
[2:02:40] have we been ordained but
[2:02:41] we've been ordained to adoption do you
[2:02:43] know what that means
[2:02:44] that means that it cannot fail it ain't
[2:02:47] based upon you
[2:02:48] is it based upon him he's done it for us
[2:02:52] he will do it it cannot it cannot be
[2:02:56] on how good you are no
[2:02:59] he gave us something that we perhaps
[2:03:02] forget sometime
[2:03:03] we became his sin he became our sin that
[2:03:06] we might become his righteousness
[2:03:08] that's why god works with us not
[2:03:11] according to our righteousness
[2:03:13] is according to his thank god for it
[2:03:17] i miss the mark all the time i'm forever
[2:03:20] asking god to forgive me
[2:03:21] i'm forever asking god for his mercy i'm
[2:03:24] forever asking god for his grace
[2:03:26] it is my will to be perfect in his sight
[2:03:29] but without him
[2:03:31] it's impossible i know that and it's the
[2:03:34] grace of god that
[2:03:35] that he has promised to give it to me
[2:03:38] and you
[2:03:39] he that begun the good work in you is
[2:03:41] faithful to complete it
[2:03:43] and i say yes lord
[2:03:46] let's stand we're standing
[2:03:50] in such a place right now that the world
[2:03:53] is moving on
[2:03:54] and they have they've got no idea what's
[2:03:56] coming
[2:03:57] but god always have a watchman he's got
[2:04:00] somebody there to warn us and make us
[2:04:02] see what's going on
[2:04:04] the world is shaking people are anxious
[2:04:09] china india america you name it
[2:04:13] everybody is talking about war everybody
[2:04:15] now is talking
[2:04:17] threats to one another and brother adam
[2:04:20] say they crazy
[2:04:26] yeah they're evil i mean you know
[2:04:28] they're evil
[2:04:30] you know evil man has no conscience of
[2:04:33] evil
[2:04:35] it is what he is so he he
[2:04:38] he can't feel bad about what doing wrong
[2:04:41] he just didn't know i feel sorry no he
[2:04:44] has
[2:04:45] no conscience of feeling sorrow sorry
[2:04:48] i mean you look at people you know you
[2:04:50] got these what they call it serial
[2:04:51] killers and everything
[2:04:52] you know they don't go and they cry
[2:04:54] about what they just did no they go look
[2:04:56] for the next victim victim
[2:04:58] see whatever what else they can do to to
[2:05:01] to to satisfy that wickedness in them
[2:05:04] and that's what we're working with now
[2:05:06] it's like lucifer
[2:05:07] and his children loose photo
[2:05:10] you ever seen him repent you ever say
[2:05:13] see him
[2:05:13] in the scripture anywhere where he says
[2:05:15] i'm sorry i did this
[2:05:17] no even when god takes him
[2:05:20] and throws him have him thrown you know
[2:05:23] in the lake of fire
[2:05:24] you you'll never hear him cry for mercy
[2:05:28] this is a natural thing for man to cry
[2:05:30] for mercy
[2:05:32] but he is so cold and evil there is
[2:05:34] nothing to cry out for
[2:05:37] you know i just want you to understand
[2:05:39] his children are the same
[2:05:42] father we so thank you for this time
