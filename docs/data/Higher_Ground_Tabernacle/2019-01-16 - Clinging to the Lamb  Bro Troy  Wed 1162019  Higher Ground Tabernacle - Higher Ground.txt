curtains I'm relying on that on that promise that he gave us so where two or three are gathered that promise means a lot to me because I know that it's true where two or three are gathered in my name I'll be right there in the mist amen and I just I just want to thank them for coming into this place amen as we stand let's just turn in our Bibles to Genesis chapter 2 just praying that the Lord will reveal this message perfectly tonight amen I believe he will he will amen Genesis chapter 2 we'll read the 16th and the 17th verse it says and the Lord God commanded the man saying of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil thou shalt not eat of it for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die amen now let's just bow our heads in a word of Prayer Heavenly Father we just want to thank you Lord for your scriptures are right and true Lord we thank you for every every little bit of it father lord night I just want to thank you Lord for how perfect you wrote it amen and not just how perfect you wrote it but for your Holy Spirit that comes and reveals it Lord and Laura as we read as I spoke here right before I spread the scriptures Lord you promised Lord that you would be here in the room and Laura I want to say this since you're here while you are here that you would break the bread of life to us just like you did there on the road to emmaus father that you would break the word to us once more father and reveal your word to us Lord though we may not be worthy Lord we believe that we are called and we've been made worthy by your blood father so underneath the blood of that shed landlord we're crying out to you for more of your word revealed to us father for by the revealed word we live and move Lord and have our being Lord in your presence and we just thank you for we know that you'll do it because you promised it and the name of Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen god bless you can be seated amen that's those two verses I read are pretty strong word amen he said that every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil thou shalt not eat of it for in the day that thou eatest thereof it thou shalt surely die and I just wanted to say that for every single one of us that has ever felt a pain that has ever grown older has ever gotten sick that that is the evidence in our natural body that that scripture is against us amen that scripture is against our natural bodies amen we know that that according to that scripture all of us in Adam we've all died according to the scripture in Adam because of the the sin there back at the beginning that all of us you know as we're young children we growing up growing up growing up but as we past that time of the strength of life of age 21 or so that we all constantly get older and older and older we get sick death comes by our household we see and we begin to realize that we go the way of all men it's a strong Scripture amen it shows that we have to find another promise amen because the one promise right there says that it's we're gonna die amen the promise right there says that this body of ours must die this body that is being cursed with a curse must surely die must it must come to pass that as the Bible says ashes to ashes and dust to dust from the dust that you were brought up from the dust that you will go back to amen is euros of your children you rejoice and the hope of life and everything but as you get older and older and you begin to realize that that one of these days this flesh of yours is gonna go right back to the dust from where it's it comes amen so but because of that there has to be another promise a man there's got to be another another promise that we can look to a man because as we look in our own bodies and our own flesh we know what the Bible says and then we look at it the sicknesses and the and the shortcomings in our own flesh amen how many times we stumble how many times we fall how many times they do things contrary to the word we must find somewhere in this scripture another word another promise that we can look to is our only hope our only hope in this life is that someway somehow that there's something else in this book amen that we can cling to that we can look to the we can hope to there would help us to get a around this scripture that would say that we must die there's got to be a hope in here somewhere Amen that says a week where we can get around because we know we know what that this body is going to drag us right down to the same place that our fathers went that our grandfathers went that our great-grandfather's and our great-grandfather's and all the way before us we're dragged down to the dirt and then there's now a tombstone over where their body lays testifying that they were once alive but now they're dead and their body is turning back to the dust amen so but be so this word says here that everybody that has done something contrary to the Word of God that their body must die my guess if anybody here has ever told a lie if anybody here has ever told a lie they got it done hey man if anybody has ever said something that wasn't true they got to die my if you have ever taken something that wasn't rightfully yours you've got to die oh my how many things have we done in this life that we don't even really have a remembrance that we don't amen and those things that we constantly do that are contrary to what the Word of God says now let's go back to Genesis chapter one here I said you know Genesis 1:1 it's familiar to all of us it says in the beginning God created the heavens and the earth and the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters and God said I think about and God said God put his word in the earth God was placing his word and the earth you know in verse five it says ain't God called verse 6 it says and God said you know verse eight and God called 9 and God said 10 and God called 11 ain't God said amen verse 14 and God said amen and God constantly constantly verse 20 and God said amen and constantly verse 24 and God said God is just speaking his word over the earth speaking his word over the earth speaking his word over the earth constantly constantly filling now this now if you know we you know this earth right now right now the men on this earth they want to go to Mars amen but I can tell you that when you go to Mars there's been a little bit of word spoken over that because it's there but hasn't nearly had as much word as what the earth here has had amen because let me tell you when I look around Mars from all what the wrote the pictures that the Rovers have sent back on Mars there is not near there is no life that I can see there amen but for some reason God has favoured this earth here by filling it with the Word of God amen God spoke to the waters told him to bring forth the fish a man God spoke to the dirt and told to bring forth the plants a man he spoke to the air and had I had all the the birds appearing in the air and everywhere you look this earth is filled with life that has in it the DNA that God spoke in the beginning amen but but that very life that created everything on this earth we found out that somehow in this natural body of ours there's some piece of death in there that is contrary to the Word of God that was spoken the very thing that has set this earth in motion amen as my daughter was talking to me over lunch today she was talking about the earth and I says oh well as the earth spinning or is it still she says it's spinning I was like well who's funny and she said God did a mint well where did all this come from they say that this earth that everything is if you if you take retrace the steps back that everything came from one dense mass that somehow exploded billions of years ago and they're still moving and spinning and a little bit spinning off here and there and that everything is still moving from that one explosion where and God said Amen that big explosion where God said amen it created an explosion and everything is still moving by the power of that word but yet that we find out that in our own natural bodies there is something that is contrary to that word and because of that our bodies are getting sick getting old and dying amen every time we lie every time we cheat every time we steal every time we do thing something that we know and our and ourselves is wrong we know its death inside of us is speaking Amen something is breaking the Word of God amen but you know there is going to come in time to where everything that is contrary to the Word of God must be judged amen there is going to come a moment in time to where just like it was in the beginning there was a moment in time where God's Word was broken and from that time on everything has gone downhill downhill downhill why because God's Word is broken and you know that word is still broken to this day I meant there there is the testimony that there is still a broken word that word is still broke amen that word is still broke and what did God do he took that word now that word is life amen God's word is life God's Word is what put life here on the earth amen and so what did God do he had that word in the garden called the Tree of Life amen now let's turn over to Jesus three just as 3 verse 22 and the Lord God said Behold the man is become as one of us to know good and evil and now lest he put forth his hand and take also of the tree of life and eat and live forever therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the Garden of Eden to till the ground from whence he was taken and so he drove out man any place at the east of the Garden of Eden cherubims and a flaming sword which turned every way to keep the way of the Tree of Life so God at that point in time sealed off the way to the Tree of Life it was sealed a man no man know had know how hard he tries no matter how much he wants to live longer no matter how much he wants to live better no matter what he tries to do man could not get back to that tree of life amen there's a barrier there it's sealed away man cannot live forever amen why because once man broke that word that word was broken and inside of his body there's that testimony there that he broke the Word of God amen but you know this the the interesting thing about the creation of God is is you know when we look to the sacrificial lamb you know people always think back to Moses always thinking back to Moses or you think about the sacrificial lamb but the sacrificial lamb has really been since before the foundation of the world God has always had but even before and God created the heavens and the earth God has always had a sacrificial lamb there and the Bible says that the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world amen so before God create anything on this earth he always had a testimony that there would be something there that the these Lambs that were humbly bleeding out in the wilderness there were there were meekly being herded here from there to there here to there and everywhere that there was something about those Lambs they were just really special unto God Amen that God has something in his mind before the foundation of the world that he would create a way back to the tree of life amen now let's turn over to Exodus chapter 19 I remember here in Exodus chapter 19 this is where God has led them out of the let him out of Egypt he's delivered them he set them free he's he's delivered them and what he deliver him underneath he delivers them underneath a shed the blood of a shed land amen he delivered them underneath a Passover lamb when when God drove them out of the Garden of Eden how did he drive them out he'd read drove them out underneath the skins of a shed lamb amen with the bloody skins of a lamb they were left the garden covered in the skins of lamb God always has wanted to protect his people from judgment amen judgment came to this earth why because the word was broken via God want to keep his people safe from the judgment of God amen because judgments coming amen what is going to have what does judgment going to do judgment just like at one point in time God's Word was broken and everything has gone scattered out and fallen from that word that was broken and is just going into chaos chaos chaos chaos bringing chaos into every family every home every nation every tribe amen the entire plant plant is now covered in chaos because the broken word of god but God at one moment in time is going to bring everything back and restore back with a rod of iron amen and it's going to be called the judgment amen now that is going to be a very violent time amen why because when you because everything is so contrary to the Word of God that everything is going to be brought back to and got brought back into conformance to the Word of God at a moment in time amen and if you are there at that judgment seat and you are contrary to that word then at that moment in time you will be judged Amen you if you are judged contrary to that word let me tell you what you're going to burn Amen you will be you'll go to hell Amen and there will be a flaming fire you'll go there to that hell to be to be judge to be torment and why because you are contrary to the Word of God that's what the judgement is when you sit before that judgment throne without mercy without grace what is it and all of a sudden everything that is inside of you that's contrary to what the Word of God says we'll all sudden be highlighted it'll be shown it'll be visible why because this is the judgment we're bringing everything back into accordance of the Word of God some will find themselves on the inside some will find themselves on the outside why because everything is going back it's a dividing line amen everything will be judged weighed in the balance we'll find out are you with the what the word says or are you contrary to what the word says amen Exodus chapter 19 God was coming down to visit the people on Mount Sinai and to make a covenant with them to reserve the people to himself amen and and what'd he do God let's read verse 16 and it came to pass on the third day in the morning that there were thunders and lightnings and a thick cloud upon the mountain and the voice of a trumpet exceeding loud so that all the people that was in the camp trembled and Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet with God and they stood in another part of the mountain and the mountain I was all together on a smoke because the Lord descended upon it in a fire and the smoke thereof ascended and as the smoke of a furnace and there the whole mount quaked greatly a man what is happening here judgments coming down amen God is bringing forth his law that law how many people have been slain by that law how many people have found themselves on the wrong side of that law a man they had as bribe and said they had a choice between law and grace say men and what they do they chose the law here is the law coming down in judgment it's speaking it's speaking and what's it doing is saying thou shalt not thou shalt not do this now should not do this and let me tell you what they had already said we will do everything you say they're already spoken to Moses and said we will do every single thing that you say for us to do and right away they begin breaking the law of God breaking the law of God breaking the law of God and what was their only hope was the blood of a shed lamb they only one hope because as soon as God brought the law as God as soon as God started writing in tablets of stone when Moses went to take those tablets down to the people he found what he find him doing breaking the very law that he was bringing to them look Amen right there at the very moment the bearer at the very time God was writing in that tablet of stone whether the laws that he wanted them to perform there right there down there with with with Aaron breaking the law of God while God is writing the law I'm worshipping the idols of the earn me a mint how can they live how can they how can they live but God reached back to something from before the foundation of the world to a older covenant amen to an over and older covenant that's something that a covenant before the time of the law back to the shed lamb before the foundation of the world and he brought that forward in time and gave them what the priests gave them what the lamb let's go forward now to a couple chapters XS 29 excess 29 verse 38 it says now this is that which thou shalt offer upon the altar to lambs of the first year day by day continuing amen so what Laura's telling him here every day I want you to offer me two lanes I want you to offer me a lamb in the morning I want you to law firm your lamb in the evening every day for as long as you're here on the earth I want you to be offering up a slain lamb a man what are you doing what are they doing every single day what what are they doing well they're breaking the law every day but every day they're reaching back to is an older covenant they're reaching back to the before the foundation of the world they're reaching back and pointing to a slain lamb and they're bringing it forward to their time and they're saying Lord we are testifying Lord even though we stand here even though we be guilty in our flesh even though we be contrary to the word Lord we are sacrificing this lamb sacrificing this lamb sacrificing this lamb verse 39 says the one lamb now shall offer in the morning the other lamb now shall offer at the evening let's go down to verse 42 it says and this shall be a continual burnt offering throughout your generations at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the Lord where I will meet you to speak there unto you God wants to meet with his people amen now he didn't say I'm gonna go I want you to go and take the tablets of stone out of the Ark of the Covenant he didn't say I want you to go grab those tablets and bring them to the door and I want to meet you right there with the tablets why because they will be in contrary to what the tablets said but he says no leave the tablets of stone there in the Ark of the Covenant leave them there why won't you take the blood I take a lamb slowly and bring that to the door of the tabernacle I will meet you right there amen continually day by day verse 42 of the last part that says where I will meet you to speak there unto you and verse 43 says and there I will meet the children of Israel and the tabernacle shall be sanctified by my glory the presence of a slain lamb at the door of the tabernacle would bring the presence of the almighty got on the scene the presence of that slain lamb would bring the presence of Jehovah and that slain lamb would sanctify them and that prayer the well the lame would bring the presence and says the presence would sanctify them think about that God came to sanctify his people what what does it mean for them to be sanctified I am here I'm here to cleanse you I am here to wash you and I'm here to take away everything that is contrary to the Word of God amen so that you could live here on the earth and be a peculiar people set aside for me that somewhere in this earth even though the people over here in this nation are being judged over here in this nation everywhere the whole earth is filled of people they're living contrary to what my words said in the beginning but you here are washed but you here are sanctified you have reached back to an older covenant back before the fall amen back before Adam and Eve sinned you reached clear back before the foundation of the world you grab that slain lamb before the foundation world you brought it forward and right there is where I'm gonna meet you amen amen verse 43 and there I will meet with the children of Israel and the tabernacle shall be sanctified by my glory and I will sank sanctify the tabernacle of the congregation and the altar I'll sanctify also both Aaron and his sons to miss or to me in the priests office and I'll dwell among the children of Israel I'll be their God and they shall know that I am Jehovah their God and that brought them forth out of the land of Egypt that I may dwell among them I am the Lord their God amen God wants to return back what is it it's the tree of life that is that it is hidden behind those cherubims hidden behind that flaming sword but that tree of life is trying to visit his people again at the door of the tabernacle now they were sealed away from that tree of life back there in the beginning but now that tree of life has reappeared again and it's stay at the door of the tabernacle and say I will sanctify you here I will wash you here amen I will wash you here why so that you can come back then you might have an opportunity to come back to the Tree of Life so that they won't be judged amen let me tell you Saints what we don't want to stand at the white throne judgment amen we don't want to have to go up to heaven with our sins with us amen someway somehow we have to find this slain lamb and sacrifice a man somehow we have to find this sacrificial lamb amen because this is continually throughout art your generation is continually continually continually someway somehow why because if you ever could once find that slain lamb it will bring the presence of the Lord to your tabernacle and you will be sanctified by his presence you will be washed you will be cleansed you will be you will be set like you are in the Garden of Eden back before the fall again if some way somehow you could ever find yourself in the presence of that slain lamb then that all the curses of this word could be removed from you amen all the curses of this broken word every time that you lied every time that you stole something every time you took something that it wasn't yours everything that you've ever done that was contrary to what the words of this book said all those curses could be swept away from you in a moment it's been believed in and I if some way somehow you could reach back before the law and grab a hold of that slain lamp and bring it forward to your moment in time and say Lord I am trusting in the slain lamb behalf we go down to Jerusalem right now we can't find it we can't find the tabernacle we can't find the light where is this slain lamb at a mint and I'm just speaking simply a man I know you know where it's at a man let's just keep going here amen I want to read that one more time verse 42 and verse 43 this shall be a continual burnt offering throughout your generations at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the Lord where I will meet you to speak there unto thee and there I will meet with the children of Israel and the tabernacle shall be sanctified by my glory where'd he meet him right there at the door what would they do they bring their lamb up to the sacrifice and when they bring their sacrifice and bring their turtledoves and bring it all and what would they do was they're bringing their there heave offerings they're bringing their grains they're bringing their turtle doves they're bringing all they're bringing their sacrifice well they're uniting themselves with the sacrifice of the Lamb that was taking place amen what they brought their sacrifice and well their sacrifice is uniting with the Lamb that was slain every morning and every evening amen what are they doing they're joining their faith with the faith of the priest amen say men their sacrifice is being joined why because that's not they didn't just bring lambs they brought turtle doves they brought the grain they brought the heave offering they brought the peace offerings they brought the trespass offerings they brought all those things to the door of the tabernacle and what'd the priest do that priest was on the other side of the door and what's he doing he's slaying a lamb in the morning a lamb in the evening a lamb the next morning a lamb the next evening constantly slain lamb slain lamb he's reaching back before the foundation of the world amen bringing it forward to the door I mean bringing forward to the door and it was it and they're inside the inside the hoist of hoist there is laying the Word of God underneath the mercy seat amen and that word of God is laying there underneath the mercy see it speaks against them speak - against everything in their flesh that they did wrong it's saying you did this you did that you did this you did this wrong the God said to do this but you did this instead and that word is speaking against them that word would judge them but God put a lid on the on the Ark of the Covenant amen God put a lid on the Ark of the Covenant and he called that lid a mercy seat Amen God and what'd he do he took the cherubims the same cherubims that were guarding the weight of the Tree of Life now he places him on top of the Ark of the Covenant and he said what do they do they take the blood of that lamb and they sprinkle it seven times seven times towards the east seven times towards these what are they doing they're testifying throughout the seven church ages constantly everything that is named over seven amen the Bible says that seven is a covenant amen when you make a covenant with someone in the Old Testament the Bible says that you were seventeen yourself amen if that's what the that's what the root word of the of the Covenant meant was that you were seventeen yourself you were binding yourself anything a seven is complete its whole it's it's finished it's perfect amen and when you bound yourself what does God doing they would sprinkle on the mercy seat seven times the blood of the Lamb this is now complete mercy is finished mercy has been made complete you though you are contrary to the word set but because of the mercy of the land you'll have mercy throughout all your generations anybody that can reach back and tie themselves to the slain lamb will have mercy amen though the word says this if you can somehow join yourself to the slain lamb you will not have to face the judgment amen and so what would they do they would go and they get their turtle doves there you go and take their tithing amen they're going they would take the take the their wheat offering they take their peace offering they take their sacrifice and their their Tretton their trans their trespass offerings and all the offerings and they take them to the tabernacle door a man they take their lambs there and they sacrifice they'd offer it up they offer it up and they're testifying we believe in the slain lamb we believe in the priesthood we believe in this and we are desiring that the mercies would speak for us that the lamb let the lamb speak for us and they walk away justified by Jehovah a man where was God at all this time right there in verse 42 he says where I will meet you to speak there unto thee verse 14 says there shall be there this shall be a continual burnt offering throughout your generations at the door of the tabernacle raishin before the Lord where I will meet you to speak there unto you I mean I will meet you right there right there at the door I will beat you so as they are bringing their sacrifices as they see the priests God is meeting them right there amen and what are they doing they may not realize what they're doing but they're united themselves with the slain lamb before the foundation of the world they're reaching back to not just the Covenant of Moses not just the Covenant of Abraham now they're reaching way way awake not just back the Covenant of the cherubims that are blocking the way the Tree of Life but they're going way back to that which was at the beginning before the beginning the slain lamb before the foundation of the world and they're testifying that even though that words in the Ark of the cutting back way back to a previous covenant that God before the foundation of the world testified that all that would unite themselves with this slain lamb with the sacrifice of lamb would not be judged with the oncoming judgment amen and God's glory would meet them right there think about it there I will meet with the children of Israel and the tabernacle shall be sanctified by my glory and I'll sanctify the tabernacle of the congregation and the altar now where is the altar today and then it's right here at your heart the tabernacle where is it your body it's you it's your heart amen and there's an altar there is a place amen it's your hearts door amen it's theirs you know you can do all the thinking you want to with your mind but at some point you have to actually say to the word of God that is the truth what do you have to do you have to go back you have to agree with the word the same word that created the heavens and the earth you have to say Lord I agree with that word and then what do you do you bring your sacrifice what are you do you forsake the world and this things of the world when you forsake the world and the things of this world you take up the cross and you follow Jesus what are you doing you're going to the slain lamb you're going to the death and do a read of your very hearts door not just with the mine service but from your heart you're saying Lord though I have sinned though I have done wrong lord I am testifying Lord that I am forsaking the world and things of the world I'm trusting in you and what are you doing you're bringing your sacrifice of your own life God doesn't want you the lilies on the altar God doesn't want that he wants you upon the altar amen what are you doing as you bring yourself to the altar as you lay your life down and as you say Lord forgive me I lay down my life I lay down my thoughts my evil ways my wicked ways and I lay them down upon the altar you're bringing your sacrifice to the tenth door where the blood of the Lamb is and the blood of the Lamb will speak for you and here comes the presence of the Almighty God - what sanctify you - wash you to cleanse you they're all the things that you did wrong they were contrary every time you lied every time you spoke evil now the blood of the Lamb is speaking for you amen why is that such a good thing because one of these days that mercy seat will become a judgment seat amen God will not always strive with man I mean there is coming a day - where the blood of the Lamb will no longer be on the mercy seat amen the mercy seat will turn into a judgement seat the mercy seat will turn into a judgement seat and all then whether the work will be sealed the work will be done amen and let them they were righteous be righteous still let them they're filthy be filthy still amen let's just turn over to John chapter 17 now there has to be a dividing time amen there has to be a time where men and where there is a dividing time between those that will believe in the God in his word and those that will not you know there's always there's always going to be those that try to live in that gray area it's where they they they they they want to they kind of will agree with the word though they'll say yeah that is the truth but they never want to fully give in to the Word of God amen there will try to ride that fence right on down the line never really ever choosing one way or the other way as you know you've heard that that thing about the the man who every constantly sitting on the fence constantly sitting on the fence you know and every time he he knew he should repent of this new he should repent of that but he thought well maybe I can do this maybe I can do that and he's always sitting on the fence he comes on down to the to the very end of his life and he thinks well I'm doing all right at the very end of my life I can just jump off to the one side of the fence and I'll be ok a man he got the Lord on the one side he got the devil on the other side and there at the end of his life the devil says to him but I own the fence amen so the very thing that he was riding on the whole time he didn't realize he was on the devil's ground the whole time hey man we're not here to see how close we can get to the things that are wrong but how close we can get to the things that are right why we got to be sanctified by the presence of the Almighty God amen John chapter 17 we'll read verse 14 Jesus speaking and he says I have given them thy word and the world hath hated them now why why did the world hate them now it's not just the same way that people have the word and are being disobedient to the word but God when he actually gave the disciples his word he gave them the Holy Spirit power to also be obedient to the word Amen what them and the word became one I gave them thy word and what happened as Jesus preached them those three and a half years what they do they kept saying Lord I believe Lord I believe Lord yes that's nothing but the truth Lord I agree with what you're saying Lord and now we know that thou art the Christ the Son of the Living God and they kept agreeing with the word kept agreeing with the word and that word that was up on the on their minds dropped down into their heart and what them in the word were becoming one Christ came he was the word and he gave the word to them and they became one with the word verse 14 I have given them thy word and the world hath hated them because they are not of the world even as I am NOT of the world now every single one of them could say no I was born in this world I was born of my own natural parents amen but now here is this man Christ Jesus virgin birth born of the Holy Ghost and saying that just the same way that I am not of this world now these are not of this world they've been born again they've been born again they are not what they do they reach back by accepting Christ the Lamb they meant by accepting Christ the Lamb they reach back before the foundation of the world and tied themselves something to something that was beyond beyond the law of Moses beyond Abraham a man beyond beyond the flaming Chairman's amen they reach all the way back to the lamb slain before the foundation of the world amen now nothing can touch them what they believed in the slain lamb amen now the slain out of the lamb is now testifying that they are one with me and the same way that I came that I was born of God now they are to be born again of me verse 15 I pray not that thou should take them out of the world but that thou should keep them from the evil and they are not of the world even as I am NOT of the world what's he doing Jesus Christ was the Tree of Life amen he was that same tree of life that the cherubim that that flashes or was turning every which way that was blocked that was blocking the way of the Tree of Life what's he doing he's expanding Eden they meant God is expanding Eden and he's expanding it to now encompass those that would believe in him there there now can have a right to the Tree of Life but have a right to partake of the Tree of Life they're going back to what the tree left no longer cursed away from it but now they're returning back to the Tree of Life they've been given power to become sons and daughters of God amen now let's turn it over to revelations chapter 3 revelations chapter 3 verse 18 through 20 and it says I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich and white raiment that thou mayest be clothed that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve that thou may se as many as I love I rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore and repent behold I stand at the door and knock and If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come in to him and will sup with him and he with me to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and set am set down with my father in his room now what's he saying there that now here he's come back at the very end of the age and the Laodicean age he's come back to our day and what has he found even though that he has restored back the way of the Tree of Life people aren't living there amen though he is Rick he comes back to the church and he has to tell him you're not sanctified amen you're not sanctified you're not living according to my word you're not living underneath of the blood of the shed lamb and he's exposing them that they're living and sin he's exposing the church for what they're doing he's exposing them what is doing the same word that was spoken the same word that was broken in the beginning it is still now 2,000 years after Christ still being broken by the church why because they're breaking the Word of God amen there was there they're taking their denominational dogmas and creeds and using that as an excuse to not believe the Word of God so here Christ comes to receive his bride to take a bride for himself amen amen as he is as he had sprinkled the the blood of the mercy seat seven seven times every generation has to have that testimony that they've received the the blood of the Lamb a man and he comes to this they should be reaching back to the blood of the shed lamb but they're living contrary to the Word of God amen and when God sent His Word to the earth and the time of Jesus the Lamb and the word were the same amen if you you say well I I believe in the lamb but rejects the word well now you're there's something wrong here amen you have something wrong here amen will they say like the Catholic Church will say you know we had we rewrote the word you know they they have those commercials come back to the mother church we wrote that we wrote the Bible if you've heard those commercials on the radio for two thousand years we've been a guiding light we wrote the Bible and it's like oh my comeback to the mother church I was like no no thank you what are they doing they're living yet living contrary to the gospel by they sit as a queen amen saying I rain and none else besides me no one placed me here we wrote the Bible amen and yet the war that word that word is still broken that word still remains broken inside of their nomination amen why because they won't return back to the word so what does Christ do he stands here right at the end of the age and he's pleading with the church I'm standing at the outside of the door knocking trying if you come in we could be united together yeah I could we could be you could be sealed behind with the Tree of Life amen seal behind the cherubims now let's go on to the next chapter revelations five or revelation chapter 4 sorry now brother bran when he preached on revelations chapter 4 he said now look at at the revelations for one what's he saying mercy is now over amen the bride the bride is being called up to heaven amen he says after this I looked and behold a door was open in heaven and the first voice which I heard as whereas a trumpet talking with me which said come up hither I'll show thee things which must be Hereafter and immediately I was in the spirit and behold a throne was set in heaven and one set upon the throne amen one of these days in a moment and twinkly even and I the trumpet shall sound amen we will rejoice and one day in a moment in a twinkling of an eye we will be changed now why will we be changed we went to the tabernacle door with the blood with our sacrifice we sacrificed ourselves at the altar we lay down our life I want the priests to know cares a deck the high priest came Medus with the blood of his own sacrifice that even as much as you sacrificed your life and gave up yourself you you you sacrificed yourself for the Lamb I will come and I will meet you and I will you can't be counted with my sacrifice amen you pick up your cross and follow him you're joining yourself with the sacrifice of Calvary amen when you lay yourself down at the altar when you sacrifice yourself at the altar and you say Lord no longer do I live according my life but I live my life according to your word Amen Lord even as much as I know the eye my flesh as I have broken your work I've done contrary work but now Lord I am repenting of everything I've ever done that was contrary to your work and I'm laying myself down at the altar I'm pleading with the lamb there at the door Lord speak for me and was do Christ's milk his deck the high priest come with his own blood that He shed for us in Calvary and I said even though as you have spoken me on this earth as you have lived for the name of Lord Jesus Christ on this earth now I will speak for you amen you sacrificed your life for me I will sacrifice my life for you amen amen and you will be joined together and what is it doing because one of these days was it didn't we found the way to bypass the judgment amen we found an opportunity to have our sins judged right here right now amen that now in the day of mercy in the day of grace we said Lord forgive me amen even as they said back there in the Old Testament slay a lamb every morning slay a lamb every evening testifying Amen for your sins and they were the only people in the world that we're doing it amen the only people in the world that are doing even so the same thing today there is only one people in the world and that's the bride of the Lord Jesus Christ there is only one people in the world that's doing this and that's the bride of Lord Jesus Christ and was she doing daily continually going to that slain lamb Lord forgive me for the things that I've done Lord forgive me everything that the Spirit will point out and say oh you've done this wrong we've done that Lord forgive me for that Lord I'm sorry every day every morning and every evening constantly the slain lamb the slain lamb worried were we doing we are going in past past the flaming sorts amen you denying ourselves with the Tree of Life amen we've been given the right to the Tree of Life again why because we've been sanctified by his presence amen why this the presence of the Lamb we partook of the slain lamb when we repent of our sins Christ was faithful to forgive us of our sins amen and his presence came down into the tabernacle of our hearts and sanctified us he washed us he cleanse us and made us a fit place to live amen a fit place for him to live and dwelling he says in him we live and move and have our of his being amen and what's he doing he keeps me he just washes us he cleanses us and now we've been sealed behind with the Tree of Life amen the devil couldn't get to us if he wanted to we might still have our troubles in this flesh here amen but this flesh is not my testimony this flesh is not my testimony when this body gets sick you know what I do I go back to the word the very word that created the heavens and the earth I go back to that word because you know the curse says that I should get sick and dad died as we were at the beginning that day to you partake thereof you shall die but let me tell you I'm reaching back to an older promise than that I'm going back because it wasn't so from the beginning I'm going back to an older promise there was a lamb slain before the foundation of the world and I am clinging to that slain lamb so they even so the Bible says that day you eat thereof that day you shall die amen and no man has ever lived a thousand years on the earth they meant every man has every man in the Old Testament there I got to nine hundred and forty years old nine hundred and sixty years old eight hundred seventy years old no none could get to that thousand years why because the Bible said that day you shall eat thereof that day you should die no one ever lived out a full day a thousand years on the earth none of them ever did amen but God has a few a man that one of these days as when in a moment of the ticket and I will be changed and we will go to that place that he has prepared for us amen and as we inhabit that place that he'll begin to descend down upon the earth to a remodeled earth and we'll live out 1,000 years on the earth and when we hit that one thousandth year we'll have a ceremony amen why because we are we are testifying that when we pass the age of Adam when we passed the age of Enoch when we passed the age of Methuselah amen 969 years a man when we hit that 970 ahthe year on the earth 971 972 we've now passed Methuselah we've passed all of the everybody from the book of Genesis that ever lived up to be 960 unite with those low the oldest of them all 969 years amen and we hit that 970 tear we know Amen when we hit that thousand steer then God seals it off and he proves to the devil that this that not just that not just living not not thinking that the curse has that the curse has been broken we proved to the devil on that thousandth year that the devil has been broken and what is devil is loosed back to show his true colors everybody else everybody goes to the judgment and they are judged and the whole thing is sealed away we done proved to the devil the sacrifice worked Amen the curse has been reversed amen remember what did what did God tell Adam you show the earth shall bear thorns and thistles and by the sweat of your brow you shall live but then why did the second Adam do he came to the earth and he took the crown of thorns upon his head he wore he was crowned with the curse he took the curse away amen amen he took the curse away and when you join yourself to that slain lamb the curse has been removed from your life and his presence my witness bears witness of it amen you have become United with the slain lamb when David was standing there and he and in revelations chapter five he he sees you know revelations chapter four he looks there and he looks at the throne and he says in verse three he says and he that set was to look upon like his Jasper and sardine stone and there was a rainbow around about the throne in the sight like unto an animal he's seen all the glory of God round about the throne worse four and 20 seats and upon the seats I saw four and twenty elders sitting clothed in white raiment and they had on their head the heads crowns of gold and out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings and voices what is it his judgment verse six and before the throne there was a sea of glass like unto crystal in the midst of the throne amen you know brother branham he goes through this and revelations chapter 4 sir as I'm sure you've all listened to it amen was it showing that mercy is over the judgment is going out forth to the earth but was John watching as all this judgments going on was that John has been rescued they meant proving that the bride will also be rescued amen as he going on as to seeing this amen you get the revelations chapter 5 he's looking he says in verse 1 and I saw he still stairs that throne looking at all the judgments going now and he sees in the right hand of him that sitting on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with seven seals and what is gonna happen with this book who is worthy was he do and we come down to the verse 6 and I beheld and lo in the midst of the throne and in the four beasts and the myths of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain all those thousands of years of the testimonies of the Lamb and now here at the very end again we see the same Lamb reappearing again he is the Tree of Life from the beginning but now he has prevailed and he prevailed for you and John finds himself standing up in heaven the whole time earth is being judged he finds himself removed from the earth even as Jesus said Lord I pray they would not be of the world in the same way that I am not of the world so even so just as much as we've lived our life on this earth but because we testified her and joined ourselves with the slain lamb we are not of the heritage of our parents though these natural bodies might bear the testimony of the traits of our parents the little things that we do here and there amen but then we begin the more we submit ourselves under the Lord Jesus Christ we begin to see the traits of that lamb living itself out in our life and the more we submit to that lamb the more we see the traits of the Lamb and the less we see in the traits of ours father what is it doing this proving John 17 is true amen that we have now been joined unto Jesus Christ the Lamb of God and are allowing his traits to be shown in our lives and what and the traits of our fathers that lied our fathers that did this our fathers that did that amen amen now we've been it's we've been revealed unto us who our father really is a man we were not of our earthly parents but our Heavenly parent has been revealed and it's Jesus Christ the Son of the Living God amen we are united with him one with him and was it doing when judgment is fixing to break out on all the earth all Sun in a moment and quickly night we're removed from the earth before the judgment amen and Lord we do we go to meet the Lamb that died for us the Lamb that was slain for us and what does he do he redeems all of our names on the Lamb's Book of Life and he calls us one by one and says I loved you from before the foundation of the world I chose you I redeemed you I paid the price for you amen so that you wouldn't have to suffer the judgment payment and because it was in him one in a moment in a twinkling of an eye this body that we struggle with so much will disappear it'll be changed and won't look anything like it did before it'll be changed from our sinful nature to the gods like nature why because the whole time we lived here on this earth we testified that we were trying to live according to the law of the lamb not the law of our earthly parents and as we kept testify to that nature testified of that nature living according to the words of the lamb rejecting the the devil and he would flee from us amen a rejecting temptation and rejecting all those things say no I don't want that no I don't want that I'm gonna live according to the law glim I'm gonna live according to the law lamp every time we do something wrong Lord forgive me Lord wash me Laura cleanse me in your and we're reaching back before the foundation roller grabbing that slain lamb and lady they'd be our testimony and also now that lamb testifies for us and say you were not born of this world but you were born of the of the world to come amen born of the heavenlies why they testify and he speaks to us through the heavenly father they testified of me on the earth now I am here to testify of them amen amen and we bypassed the judgment amen amen you know the Bible says that the that the word will judge the earth he says that the lamb will judge the earth but then he says that don't you know that the Saints will judge the earth and how is it that we there was going to be a judgment but it says there's three different things that are gonna be doing the judging amen what what is it God the Bible says that we will sit with him in his throne amen and I don't know how exactly it will be but sometimes I just wonder you know I think I believe that when it comes to the time of the judgment that the bride will have overcome every sin on the earth amen that there will be a member of the bride they'll have been tempted and tried in every manner of sin all over the earth amen because the Bible says that that there is there's there is nothing no sin but what is common to me and all been tempted all have been tried amen but there will be a member of the bride they'll have gone through something and they'll overcome it by the blood of the lame by the word of their testimony amen so that when when the windows that would not receive the lamb come up to the judgment seat and they bring out their best excuse and they bring out their best excuse of why they couldn't live according to the Word of God why they couldn't do it and they say but lord I had this I could just couldn't live it because of this I just couldn't lay the path because of this that the lamb will look over to his bride that's sitting with him in his throne and you'll say you know you had that same temptation how did it was a few and she would look at her husband she'll look at the lamb and she'll say lord I just trusted in you I just trusted I know it was hard I struggle with it I didn't always I didn't always win the battle but lord I just kept trusty I just kept confessing the blood of the Lamb over it and saying Lord forgive me Lord wash me and Lord you came through you deliver me you sanctified me you washed me of it you cleansed me and the man standing there will have no excuse because they had the same opportunity to cling to the blood of the slain lamb amen amen and all the preaching that they ever heard will testify against them that they rejected the blood of the slain lamb amen they will have no excuse amen thanks be unto God that we get to sit with him and his throne will be granted unto us to be overcomers and to sit with him behold I give you a white stone amen hey man let's just stand a man constantly the lamb was slain in the morning and the evening a man and now what the land was being slain one time and he is always not just the moor anybody's there constantly making intercession for you based upon your profession amen amen Heavenly Father we just thank you Lord for your mercy Lord and your grace upon us Lord that the writing of the law that was so burning hot against us but Lord you provided a way by the slain lamb for us to bypass the judgment Lord and Lord we just want to thank you Lord for giving us an opportunity Lord to repent of our sins to bring our sacrifice to the tabernacle door to offer our selves upon the altar and say Lord forgive us if we've done anything wrong Lord let help us Lord to make it right Lord lord I pray you'd wash us by your blood or they your mercy your grace would overshadow us Lord as we come to the mercy seat where the blood of the Lamb is Lord Lord of the handwriting of the ordinances that were against this Lord that you have you have got for us a chance an opportunity to be sanctified to be washed to be cleanse and then you Lord allow us to in turn in by the blood of the Lamb to the Holy See Felice or the where we may ever dwell in your presence father Lauren I just thank you Lord for sanctifying for washing Lord may we may we never ever never leave out of your presence as you said Lord I'll be with you always even unto the end of the age Lord Lauren I pray father that we may always be found abiding in you for Lisa if you abide in me and your words about and my words bite and you you shall ask what you will and it should be done unto you lord I pray follow me your word always be found abiding in us Lord any men and though and the spirit and the blood that makes the word come to pass in our lives Lord as Mary said let it be unto us according to your word does that word drops down from the field of our mind Lord down into our heart Lord as we are sealed with the Holy Ghost and Lord we just want to thank you for it lord I pray you bless us people or if there be anything in their heart Lord that they struggle with or that they just can't seem to be that overcoming Saint Lord I pray Lord you'd show them the way and so they could stand on that last day according to Revelation is 12 and say Lord I overcame by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of my testimony that would be unto us Lord according to your word and Lord we just thank you Father for all things and we know that you always be the advocate for us and the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen god bless you saints and we have an advocate with the father amen and he's always pleading the case with us amen amen god bless you brother Frank if you'd come draw me near low I am Dino lower the voice and he told to me but I long to rise in the arms of
