you you [Music] are you you are so easy [Music] to cuz this message won't mean you don't have the love of God [Music] in hallelujah praise the Lord as we stand I just want to thank uh Iowa City for pressing your way up yeah maybe next year when the building is bigger we can come there I don't know how will do it amen and you know I'd like to invite other churches not just us but others by God's gra we're family good or bad rich or poor whichever way you go with it Isaiah 14 24 don't you just love this message it it never runs dry yeah it just keep unfolding Isaiah isai the Lord of host have sworn saying surely as I have thought so shall it come to pass and as I have purposed so shall it stand under all circumstances any circumstance circum God's will will be done genesis4 and God saw the light that it was good and God divided the light from The Dark One More scripture and I'll let you be seated isah beginning at the 16th verse 14 Isaiah they that see thee shall narrowly look upon thee and consider thee saying is this the man that made the Earth to tremble that did Shake kingdoms that made the world as a Wilderness and destroyed the cities thereof that open not the house of his prisoners all the kings of the Nations even all of them lie in glory everyone in his own house but thou are cast out of thy grave like an abominable branch and as a r arraignment of those that are slain thrust through with a sword that go down to the stones of the pit as a ccus trodden under feet thou shall not be joined with them in burial because thou has destroyed thy land and slain thy people the seed of the evilo shall never be reowned let us pray our Heavenly Father God we come before you know how Lord we thank you for our portion of Life health and strength you would give us Grace to move completely out of your way speak to your people tday we'll come into the new year Victory Lord knowing that is your grace that have kept us and knowing that you are The Keeper of the Soul bless us here tonight Hallelujah as we give you glory honor Lord give us Grace complely out of wayless of the Worden amen you may be seated I believe everybody here tonight believe that we're living in the last days and we all understand that the world is falling apart there's never been a generation like this one so much so that brother vam called it the god of uh Satan the God of this evil age but I want you to understand in all that you see and everything your natural SES declare to you all is a lie if it stands against the word you see God has a purpose and we are part of it I love that because whatever his purpose is for us it can never be changed you know I preached the last time I was here how that the elect it cannot be replaced if you are chosen by God to make a Rapture nothing can hinder that that that's God's purpose you wonder why it's so dark now God is a god of contrast the darker the atmosphere is the brighter the Christian is you know we we we we fail to see that the God grace of God is Sovereign is that right it is he is the supreme ruler whatever God has determined for you and I it's going to come to pass you know without God's grace we could never do his will his will is Sovereign God has a way of changing things to bring us to the place where we will stand in his will yall understand what I'm saying if his thoughts of you has already been determined and you really truly believe reation his thoughts were of you and his thoughts as the scripture says will give us an expected end listen what he says brother says and what does it take to make a Christian [Music] life7 he make you may you take me to record this this morning or record this this morning there isn't enough power hell can ever defeat the purpose of God God will do it anyhow see we all make mistakes but God is not looking at the mistakes he's actually looking at the commission hallelujah hallelujah you see none of us can add one cubit to our statue hallelujah hallelujah that's why the Bible says that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength Mount up with wings [Music] and not fu is that right I read the scripture Isaiah 14:24 it said the Lord of host have sworn saying surely as I have thought so shall it come to pass and as I have purposed so shall it stand my subject tonight is out from his thoughts Hallelujah we didn't know nothing about God's thoughts matter of fact we thought that uh God was something somewhere up here and down here somewhere but the Bible said that God is not far from you the Bible said that Hallelujah even in thy mouth Hallelujah But realize and recognize what God is doing as he did in Genesis one he separated the darkness from light Hallelujah when I was in a military school years ago one of the things they taught us when I came to that particular school they said I want you to understand here to get the cream of the cream of the crop we're going to keep sifting testing you to make it you're going to fail you understand me this is how God works many are called but few are chosen hallelujah hallelujah but one thing we don't have to fear we have the see see Gene of God on the inside that in itself ties to us to God it binds us to God with such a bind it cannot be broken hallelujah hallelujah look at all the Patriots of the Old Testament Mighty Men of God but they were very faulty Hallelujah the Bible said we all sin and we've all come short of the glory of God it doesn't matter we we looked at a man called Joseph and we we we look at all that he did and we wonder how did he do it not by power not by might but by my spirit said the Lord it was God's Sovereign Grace that he gave to Joseph to do his Sovereign will understand it is a supernatural power that intervene into our lives that makes us do the will of God that's why no man will be able to boast in the presence of the Lord HJ Hallelujah even when brother Bram said like this he said if you see me over there Hallelujah he said you might ask me how I make it he said I will tell you it's amazing gra hallelujah hallelujah we're getting ready to [Music] embrace and you must know the scripture says evil seducers get worse worse Hallelujah come on somebody you know and I know it doesn't matter what country you're living in politicians are corrupt and they're not going to get better because the scripture says they cannot oh y'all getting quiet on me I'm trying to bring something to you now we understand the purpose of God one of them anyway is to release Lucifer on Earth that was no mistake you understand me this had already been in the mind of God where the Battleground would be on earth Hallelujah and as I said there in Iowa City if you defeated him in the beginning you defeat him now you and I must understand that this will not be the first time Satan gets a weapon hallelujah hallelujah this message came to make you remember and recognize who you are Hallelujah Hallelujah if you can say it like this we are a chip off of the rock rock I said Rock and Upon This Rock he said I build my church The revelation of Jesus Christ let me tell you something it's not that in itself will not satisfy you can not see that Jesus Christ is in you because you are now the Revelation hallelujah hallelujah now the devil got children so does Jesus you understand me Hallelujah the Bible says according to Second Timothy 2 21:19 nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure having this seal the Lord knoweth them that are he and let everyone that nameth the name of Christ amen depart from iniquity so understand we're not dealing with two seeds of God one is of God one is of the devil one seed is of light and one seed is of the darkness Hallelujah can I say it like this I heard a brother said just not long ago even today he said we are now living in the age of hell I never thought of it like that all I thought about was the bride age but you're living in one or the other Hallelujah y'all better hear what I'm saying because even the prophet of God told us that hell was blending into Earth and what we are seeing with these weird looking people acting in such a devilish way we're now seeing demons that was was once in hell I believe it was the World War I talks about the lid was now taking off taken off of Hell other words demons can come and go when one time they were bound in the river Euphrates hallelujah hallelujah now God has showed us that the river of eup is now dried up Hallelujah as a sign as a witness to his word now dealing with thousands of devils hallelujah hallelujah and these are not amateurs Hallelujah you understand me where did these demons go they went to H California and they invaded the United statesj by way of Hollywood somebody and because of Hollywood now the world has now moved into a age of Hell Hallelujah they're fighting in hell come on somebody they're dying in hell oh come on somebody there's hatred in hell all the attributes is now influencing the church you say well wait a minute brother remember when the prophet of God saw the preview of the church hallelujah what was happening those who were once Maring to the tune of the word been influenced by hell and they adopted the way of worship that what they do in Hell come on some you say what it mean the very music The Very twist [Music] the way they acted they were naked and didn't even know it Hallelujah you said I don't believe that but we're living in the age of nakedness hallelujah hallelujah people are naked and don't even know it and for those who do know it they don't even care somebody realize you stand I'm tell you realize where you stand you're standing on the Lord's Side Hallelujah because right at the end when the prophet of God said is this all my message have produced sound in the distance with Christian solders with the cross of Jesus going on before I don't know about you I'm one of them oh yes oh yes we call it Insanity because everybody in hell is insane did you hear what I said we call it insanity cuz everybody in hell is insane y'all hear what I'm saying hallelujah when the seals were open something else took place Hallelujah remember God couldn't give John the Revelation he was on Earth God said come up here hallelujah you got to go up higher order to receive this message I want you to know we sit here in our seats we are now sitting in Heavenly plac Christ Jesus he said how do you know it because this message the voice says come up higher represented the bride now that the word is open we now experiencing Heavenly things hallelujah hallelujah when the denominational bride started walking somebody help me here but those who followed the message of Hallelujah glory to God they were predestined to do it Hallelujah you can't do it you can't even change yourself it takes this word to change you Hallelujah coming from the message Israel in the church 53 3 325 Hallelujah the devil y'all looking at me crazy but that's what technology does it's Hallelujah it says for the children being not yet born this is Esau and Jacob neither having done good or evil that the purpose of God according to the election so let me say this if you want to you know what's more powerful than receiving the Holy Ghost is your election to receive it you understand me without election you wouldn't be able to receive it hallelujah hallelujah he said I'm letting that soak a little long time Wake Up Now One es and Jacob either child was born but they even didn't know what was right or wrong that the election of God not of works but of him that call Hallelujah I ask you the question where were you before God called people oh my God I was living in a miserable life of sin you was like a pig in the in mud oh let me me let me not say you I was like a pig in the mud I enjoyed the mud let's be honest every one of us who were Sinners when we were Sinn being is it true it took the word of God to bring you to conviction and if you can be convicted if the word can convict you and you can say Lord It's Me standing in the Vol hallelujah hallelujah there's one thing about the serpent seed don't know nothing about true repentance about I'm sorry they don't how to truly repent come somebody now I want you to understand here we're getting ready to embrace a real battle Hallelujah did y'all know that brother random called it the squeeze he says coming and let me tell you something it's closer now than it's ever been we don't really know it is but we see it in the atmosphere right before the storm starts you see the clouds gathering I can see the clouds GA but I'm not worried neither is there fear hallelujah hallelujah because the Bible say no weapon formed against shallos right is this not Satan's Eden you living in Satan's Eden let's put it this way you're living in Satan's hell his Eden is hell that's what it is it is a a how can I say it a atmosphere of Darkness it is can I say it like this what brought the darkness reasoning Adam and Eve reason hallelujah hallelujah that's why the Bible says Le not to your own understanding Hallelujah the moment you reason the [Music] word the moment Darkness influences Hallelujah and as I said whosoever you yield your members to obey servant you are so I want you to understand you got Darkness and Light batt Hallelujah and never have we seen Darkness like this and the only way listen if you was in the darkness you wouldn't be able to see anything because you're in the light you can see through the darkness am I making sense this message is the light that makes us see evil come on somebody we know what's evil what's good we know what's right we know what's holy because of the word of God is still yet the light of the world Hallelujah and what we're now seeing all of the perversion and everything else we see we're like almost holding our mouths because we can't believe these things that we we see happening are the things that are happening in Hell hallelujah hallelujah we're just seeing the reflection of what's happening because Satan now can possess people so that you to make it be seen in Hell question who wants to go to hell when we're now living in the shadow of it or theing of it Mass murderers you understand me every perverted thing you can think of in now so you understand I'm not even talking about the burning fire I'm talking about another dimension that people go to that whatever you are on earth is what you are in hell you understand me so that you understand as they are now breaking down the laws around the world they're making the world lawlessness [Music] in Hell there are no laws you can kill and murder and cut off heads all you want time you you said well brother why are you saying it like this my mother who was a very spiritual woman before she came to realization the church she was then going to she went into a coma prior to her death she didn't know this message but she under that ageel when my mother was there she said Junior it is one of the worst places I ever been to my mother don't know nothing di she said it was another dimension if I'm saying this correctly she said there were murderers there she said there was a man cutting people's heads off and they wouldn't die just repeating over and over and Y understand what I'm saying she didn't know about brother Bram and that brother Bram had visited the region of the lost that's what he said there in the region of the Lost he said were beautiful women there he say it he he said it so what I'm trying to say is whatever you are here is what you are there you see what I'm saying with no laws we got laws that still hold Satan in his gra we're coming to a time where all the laws will be gone you can be free to do whatever you want see happening now now I'm just bringing something to you now you can't you can't be looking all sad like that's you I'm not preaching on you I'm preaching on demons right now the children of the dark hallelujah hallelujah you know no preacher can preach Me Out of Heaven y'all hear me no preacher right so let me go so you understand what we're now seeing is underworld there's a there's underworld Hallelujah and is moving at a rapid Pace Hallelujah but even as that world is moving the bride is moving understand where we're setting this message took us higher hallelujah hallelujah and it has given us a name that is above every name Hallelujah that at the name of Jesus KN shall bow wait a minute I want you to understand who you are receive the Holy Ghost receive Jesus and when you receive Jesus you receive his name Hallelujah and then we had a prophet who came on the scene to tell us how to use his name You' got to believe Jesus Christ is the same yday today and forever he's a God that changes [Music] Hallelujah as I was saying I don't worry because my DNA has been changed Hallelujah I'm no longer Isaiah and Clara son again and my DNA is now Supernatural hallelujah hallelujah and I want you to understand me I'm letting that DNA clear out every part of me they say this in the in the scientific world the Survivor is the fittest well I want you to know F Perfection he's the only one that I know that can take a dead thing and make it [Music] alive understand when the world but Jesus quickened me hallelujah oh many of us you've been raised up in the message and you you are Hallelujah you don't know how blessed you are God the whole world wants what you got hallelujah hallelujah Glory y'all understand me amen amen hallelujah amen hallelujah Jeremiah 29 listen I'm trying to get you somewhere you're going to need what I'm preaching you're going to need this I'm telling you I know this is the will of God for me to pre I want you to really play close attention to what I'm saying need this in this 2025 if you don't know who you are in Christ you still lost I'll say it again if you don't know who you are in Christ you still lost hallelujah hallelujah you're like that fellow who was in the Army had Amnesia and could remember where he was and who his name was maybe we can take you down a familiar path tonight that's what it was he was riding that train all familiar when the train stopped off the train start walking down that trail that's what the word of God is given you what the message is takes you to a familiar [Music] Trail recognize who you are Hallelujah brother Bram said that father knew he would return God knows you're going to return may not be what you want to be right now but the word is a lamp unto my feet is God who leads us hallelujah hallelujah he said for I know the thoughts that I think toward you say the Lord thoughts of Peace not of evil to give you an expected and those of you who would not haven't got serious with God yet got minutes to 12 amen then shall you call upon me and ye shall go and pray unto me and I will hearken unto you me you tried to get a hold of God you no God doesn't ignore your prayah

lead you there the Bible says repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins shall reive of the Holy Ghost I mean this is what we're here for soul to Christ and I I want to say this is not a put on it's a come on what happens when you're born again these bodies hold us back you know but not soon and very soon we're going to have a body that'll never get tired forward to that day when I won't have I won't ever get tired again amen amen we love the Lord we have promised a time of [Music] communion so we're going to change our order to that time for those of you who um don't feel led to do so that's fine who do ask in Auditorium for those of you who don't you can always be excused amen amen when it comes to communion it is a time of judgment or rather it's a time that we judge ourselves and when it comes down to being worthy we're only worthy because he makes us worthy but in this time is a time that we make make things right with God or sister because we never want to take communion unworthily you take it unworthily you are condemning yourself and I don't know what's in your life but God knows and so do you with that being said let us stand we're going to have a reading from First Corinthians we'll start with the 23rd verse here Paul says for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread go and when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had SED saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do e as often as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup ye do show the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for you would judge ourselves if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chasen of the Lord and uh uh me that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat t one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home that you come not together unto condemnation and the rest will I set in order when I come amen amen because there are so many we're going to have to you may be seated so what we're going to do with the bread we're going to pray and break the bread and then we'll pass the bread but then when it comes to the wine we'll form a line and our brother Isaac will direct you the way the way we will will do this down [Music] youus all [Music] the let's bow our
