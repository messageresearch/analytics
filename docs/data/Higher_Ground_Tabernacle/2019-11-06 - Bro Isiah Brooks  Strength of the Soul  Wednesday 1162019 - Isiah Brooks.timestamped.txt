[15:43] man take up your cross and follow Jesus
[15:46] amen as we stand we think I'll for His
[15:52] grace and His mercy appreciate the Lord
[15:55] Jesus Christ and all that he has done
[15:58] and is doing for us I very seldom
[16:07] divorce but I brought back some some
[16:12] scar I guess if you want to say it like
[16:14] that
[16:15] amen we appreciate the Lord Jesus for
[16:17] it's Grayson
[16:18] and I can show you by God's grace on how
[16:22] if you want to listen to those messages
[16:24] that were spoken during that time I give
[16:27] you the aptitude for the shelley's
[16:33] Church after after service God is good
[16:38] to us I know my brother Keith is
[16:41] travelling either that or he's just at
[16:45] home resting I know we've been traveling
[16:46] in today's weather has not been the best
[16:48] weather to travel probably from not his
[16:51] angle but if you would turn with us to
[16:55] acts the first chapter we'll go there
[17:01] then we'll go to Matthew 26 and then to
[17:07] Ezekiel 18 acts 1 and 8 I am truly a
[17:22] believer and I do believe with all my
[17:25] heart that we're living in the last days
[17:27] I do believe that God's it's God is
[17:31] trying to move us along if I could say
[17:35] it that way
[17:37] the battles are what they are I don't
[17:40] think it's going to get any easier but I
[17:43] know that each and every one of us are
[17:45] perhaps battling in our own special way
[17:52] everything is pattern and cut for your
[17:56] for you personally
[18:00] everybody have different trials and
[18:02] tests but let us read acts 1 and 8 it
[18:07] says but ye shall receive power after
[18:10] that the Holy Ghost has come upon you
[18:13] and ye shall be witnesses unto me both
[18:16] in Jerusalem in all Judea and in Samaria
[18:20] and unto the uttermost part of the earth
[18:26] Matthew 26 and 41
[18:35] it tells us to watch and pray that you
[18:41] enter not into temptation the spirit
[18:45] indeed is willing but the flesh is weak
[18:50] ezekiel 18:20
[18:52] then we'll let you be seated by God's
[18:55] grace ezekiel 18:20 it says the soul
[19:11] that sinneth it shall surely die
[19:21] we're just gonna take that portion of
[19:23] the scripture and let us pray it shall
[19:27] die dear Jesus we thank you for your
[19:30] grace and your mercy we thank you for
[19:33] being so good to us Lord we appreciate
[19:37] everything you do for us Lord we pray
[19:42] tonight that you would have recourse
[19:44] give us Grace and strength as we journey
[19:48] Lord in this way bless each and every
[19:52] soul here tonight we pray father God
[19:56] that your perfect will be done in our
[19:58] lives in Jesus Christ's name we pray
[20:01] amen
[20:02] you may be seated we like to entitle the
[20:09] message tonight strength of the soul and
[20:16] we know by God's grace that the man man
[20:19] in itself is composed of three
[20:22] components which is the Trinity which
[20:26] brings us to a perfect man because if
[20:33] you only had a body then then you would
[20:36] be dead and if you had no spirit you
[20:43] would be comatose
[20:48] in the soul is just there nowhere no way
[20:54] to express itself without a spirit or
[20:58] body but the Bible tells us that the
[21:02] soul that sinneth it shall die and we
[21:08] know by God's grace that the sin in
[21:11] itself is not drinking smoking lying
[21:15] thieving sin in itself is unbelief those
[21:22] things in which I named are the
[21:24] attributes of sin you still you lie you
[21:28] cheat because you don't believe now we
[21:33] realized the Bible tells us that we were
[21:37] born in sin that means we were conceived
[21:41] in unbelief Eve disbelieved God's Word
[21:45] and by so doing she brought forth what
[21:50] we see now we are a product of unbelief
[21:54] that's why when we see children you
[21:58] don't have to teach them to lie you
[22:01] don't teach them to steal you don't
[22:03] teach them to be jealous because of the
[22:06] sin nature that's within them the soul
[22:11] in itself may have an attribute of God
[22:14] in it but until that soul is converted
[22:18] that individual will bear the image of
[22:23] the children of Wrath we will always
[22:26] appear to be sinners until we are born
[22:30] again you and I must understand there's
[22:34] a man by the name of Nicodemus who was a
[22:36] Pharisee the Bible said he came to Jesus
[22:39] by night and he asked a question how can
[22:43] I inherit the kingdom of God and then
[22:47] Jesus told Nicodemus you must be born
[22:49] again and he began to break it down
[22:52] remember now this is a new doctrine
[22:54] Nicodemus being of the top schools like
[22:58] Harvard and Yale of his day
[23:00] had never heard this term born again and
[23:04] here was Jesus who didn't have an
[23:07] education telling this man you a thing
[23:10] or two that he didn't know uh because
[23:13] Nicodemus says well let me ask you a
[23:15] question
[23:16] how must I be born again must I enter my
[23:18] mother's womb again be born now that
[23:21] might sound like a silly question but I
[23:23] believe that all of us would have asked
[23:26] a question like that or something
[23:27] similar because we don't know no other
[23:30] way of coming into this world or being
[23:33] born we came from my mother
[23:35] and so Jesus said no Nicodemus that
[23:38] which is Flash's flesh and that which is
[23:41] Spirit is spirit we're talking about two
[23:42] levels of things we talked about two
[23:44] worlds or things we're talking about
[23:46] something that that that only the Spirit
[23:48] can reveal unto you but I say to you
[23:51] Marvel not you must be born again
[23:54] so we realize by God's grace amen that
[23:57] the soul in itself we we know that it
[24:01] came into this place amen
[24:04] our with an attribute of God in other
[24:07] words the Holy Spirit is the thing that
[24:10] either quickly quickens what's in your
[24:12] soul because if God is in your soul it
[24:16] were quick in God and if the devil is in
[24:19] your soul which is a serpent it will
[24:21] quicken the devil you say well what do
[24:23] you mean so that you understand the
[24:25] Bible said that that rain falls on the
[24:28] just and the unjust right the same rain
[24:32] waters corn and wheat is the same rating
[24:37] that waters the weeds and the tares and
[24:41] all have been created by God all right
[24:44] but it's what's in the soul the thing
[24:48] that's in the soul is the thing that
[24:50] determines what you'll be in the end is
[24:54] that right because a corn can't change
[24:57] itself from being a corn whatever seed
[25:00] is in it it is what it is or watermelon
[25:03] or whatever the seed is it is what it is
[25:06] so you and I must understand Amen this
[25:09] thing have been pre-planned
[25:13] however we want to say it but God knows
[25:15] that no matter how bad you looked or how
[25:20] bad you were before you was a Christian
[25:24] the Lord knew and knows them that is in
[25:28] other words he sowed the seed he was the
[25:31] planter he sowed the good seed and Satan
[25:35] sowed the bad seed and so people want to
[25:37] blame God but I'm gonna tell you God did
[25:40] not sow the bad seed even though he knew
[25:43] the outcome hallelujah
[25:47] is that Alright oh it's the truth now
[25:50] you and I must understand that the soul
[25:53] is that part of you that either has
[25:55] faith or doubt and of course brother
[25:58] Branham used it sometime interchangeably
[26:00] especially before after before 63 he
[26:03] worked with the spirit of it after 63 he
[26:06] worked with the soul and he showed us
[26:08] that the soul is the only thing that has
[26:12] one element in it is either faith or
[26:14] doubts right but the Spirit has five
[26:18] outlets and so does the flesh have out
[26:21] five outlets right there was a time a
[26:25] man said that he couldn't believe
[26:27] anything he couldn't feel smell taste
[26:29] see and hear right he can't believe it
[26:32] you know and he said don't it's tough to
[26:35] the properties that don't tell me
[26:36] nothing about faith because I don't want
[26:38] to hear about faith because if you can
[26:40] taste it
[26:40] I need to know how to taste it if you
[26:43] can if you know if I can see if you can
[26:45] see it then I need to let me see it but
[26:47] if God is real you say you've seen it
[26:49] you said you real let me see him as real
[26:52] as you are he said otherwise I don't
[26:54] believe it
[26:55] in other words if my five senses doesn't
[26:58] declare god to me I'm not gonna believe
[27:01] it
[27:01] right and the prophet of God says let me
[27:05] ask you something can you feel your mind
[27:10] he says no can you see your mind
[27:14] no can you taste your mind no he said
[27:21] well according you you don't have no
[27:23] mind
[27:27] right if I came feeling at the mind if I
[27:30] can't see how do you know it's real oh I
[27:32] know it's real see so therefore I know
[27:34] God is real right and he took a pin and
[27:38] he stuck to me with the P and they said
[27:42] ah he said the men wanted to fight him
[27:43] at that time he said he said I didn't
[27:48] feel that he said you didn't you not the
[27:53] one that got stuck he said that's the
[27:55] point
[27:56] you can't declare something that's not
[27:59] real unless you experience it whether
[28:02] you you see it the way I see it but you
[28:04] got to experience what I experienced and
[28:06] then you'll see that God is real right
[28:11] understand that the gates of the soul is
[28:14] the eyes are the eyes you and I must
[28:17] understand the Bible tells us that Eve
[28:21] she saw that the fruit was good and
[28:24] pleasant to the eyes right that's why
[28:28] the Bible tells us to watch and pray
[28:31] hallelujah because it is by the eyes you
[28:36] either receive into your soul
[28:39] what you're looking at right or you
[28:43] reject it right and the Bible tells us
[28:48] according to the Word of God says that
[28:50] we ought to pull down bring everything
[28:54] down put it under our feet
[28:57] whatever the strongholds put it on the
[28:59] Oh feet right any and everything that
[29:03] exalts itself above the Word of God is
[29:09] that Alright and let me go on to say so
[29:13] that you understand that reasoning is
[29:16] the enemy of the word hello it can't be
[29:21] right because that's what he did she
[29:25] reasoned the word what do you mean she
[29:27] processed it
[29:29] God never told you to do that God said
[29:31] have faith have faith in God have faith
[29:34] is all of our faith faith doesn't reason
[29:37] faith accepts it
[29:39] right hey faith is not you don't have to
[29:42] see it right because faith cause those
[29:44] things that be not as though they were
[29:46] it's whatever the Bible says it is
[29:49] that's exactly what it is right now you
[29:55] got to understand if you and I we the
[29:58] weak we if we fail if we shut down
[30:00] reasoning when it comes to the Word of
[30:03] God we would basically be perfect
[30:06] it is our reasoning our processing
[30:10] trying to process God and His Word
[30:13] that gets us in trouble hey that's the
[30:17] truth the devil said amen to Eve surely
[30:20] you will not die at that moment when she
[30:24] accept that surely you will not die she
[30:27] accepted the Serpent's reasoning oh yeah
[30:32] and some people say if it's not logical
[30:35] I can't believe it well you'll never
[30:39] believe it right because really what's
[30:42] logical about anything in this world so
[30:47] people try to reason God's Word and try
[30:50] to formulate some imagination that they
[30:53] they just dreamed of in other words they
[30:56] evolution they'd rather dream up some
[30:59] some lie then they believe that God said
[31:03] Let there be it's just the reasoning and
[31:06] they can never come up with the end or a
[31:09] conclusive of fact of when it comes to
[31:13] evolution because they think that we
[31:15] evolved then if we evolved then when
[31:19] when we stopped evolving because it got
[31:22] to be more to a man than what he is now
[31:24] and for the last six thousand years he
[31:28] seemed to be the same he looked the same
[31:31] walked the same smell the same he's the
[31:34] same right I mean he sure Oh what about
[31:38] our intelligence hello we're dumb
[31:41] compared to the ones in the days of the
[31:43] ant alluvion flood hallelujah
[31:46] they built pyramids they actually built
[31:50] the Sphinx and all of these things that
[31:53] they survived the flood what can man
[31:57] make that can actually survive such a
[32:01] flood we cannot even survive the kind of
[32:04] love brought on our level of disaster or
[32:09] less the whole world Alleluia
[32:12] so you understand reasoning is the thing
[32:16] that Satan's made you on right oh oh
[32:21] listen Mary and Martha did the same
[32:24] thing they said when Jesus said come if
[32:26] you want to see something I'm going to
[32:28] show you I'm the resurrection and the
[32:30] life
[32:30] and Mary Martha just for a moment times
[32:33] as Lord but he's been dead for days what
[32:37] that has to do with God when God says
[32:39] something that's exactly what he means
[32:42] hallelujah what a Peter with a reason
[32:45] long if that be you bid me come
[32:48] hallelujah but Peter did not huh it was
[32:55] only after he started walking he began
[32:58] to look around and reasoning struck him
[33:01] this is not possible it should not be
[33:04] and the moment he thought those things
[33:07] at the time he began to sink but he
[33:10] still had a vision of the word he cried
[33:13] as his lord save me see when it comes to
[33:17] the two saving you I don't reasoning
[33:19] only the Lord Jesus Christ and his word
[33:22] can save you and pull you up out of
[33:25] reasoning right so it's the truth think
[33:28] about Israel if Israel had only obeyed
[33:30] God's Word the Bible tells us Amen
[33:33] endure on Deuteronomy 10 12 through 17
[33:35] and now Israel what does the Lord thy
[33:38] God require of thee but to do what but
[33:41] to fear the Lord thy God to walk in all
[33:44] his ways and to love him and to serve
[33:47] the Lord thy God with all thy heart and
[33:51] with all thy soul Oh Oh y'all know what
[33:54] all mean it means all when you give all
[33:58] that means there's no room for nothing
[34:00] else right oh my to keep the
[34:04] commandments of the Lord in the statute
[34:06] which I can
[34:07] and this day for thy good behold the
[34:11] heaven and the heavens of heaven is the
[34:13] lords that God their earth also with all
[34:16] that they're in yes now what if what if
[34:22] Joshua would have tried to reason his
[34:26] position when he was in battle now I
[34:30] know I need some more sunlight and ain't
[34:32] no way this you know he didn't think
[34:34] about it
[34:35] he stood then says son stand still
[34:39] hallelujah how many times you've been
[34:41] almost in a wreck and and you don't even
[34:43] have the time to say Lord stop the car
[34:46] you just said Jesus right you don't even
[34:51] reason that you know God or the name of
[34:53] Jesus is powerful and it can stop the
[34:56] car God already knows the heart before
[34:59] you speak it hallelujah when you call on
[35:02] him on the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[35:03] he's always there to rescue you has
[35:07] nothing to do with the reasoning think
[35:10] about it I'm talking about Hebrew boys
[35:13] what was it they were so sold out to the
[35:15] Lord and it didn't reason they just know
[35:19] one thing I'm not going to bow to the
[35:21] image why because the Lord said know the
[35:24] LORD thy God is one they knew that
[35:27] Israel knew that worship the Lord thy
[35:29] God and him only they knew that and they
[35:32] didn't reason it listen it doesn't
[35:35] matter about the multitude if you
[35:37] understand history you find out the
[35:39] multitude was always wrong righteous
[35:43] people the right people always come in
[35:45] small numbers hallelujah it ain't a big
[35:49] thing it's a small thing is that right
[35:52] think about it right listen he says only
[35:56] the Lord had a delight excuse me he says
[35:59] behold the heavens in the heavens of
[36:00] heavens is the Lord thy God and earth
[36:04] also with all that therein is only the
[36:08] Lord had a delight in their fathers to
[36:10] love them and he closed chose their seed
[36:14] after them even you above all people as
[36:17] it is this day he said sure
[36:20] sighs therefore the foreskin of your
[36:23] heart and be no more stiffening what are
[36:25] you saying
[36:26] people on the game that's exactly what
[36:28] he's saying circumcise the foreskin of
[36:31] your heart because remember the four
[36:33] skins of the male that was circumcised
[36:37] was God in symbolic of God circumcised
[36:40] in your heart right in other words God
[36:44] was cutting off the Serpent's part come
[36:49] on somebody and so if you can see that
[36:52] you understand
[36:53] by God's grace that God is calling for a
[36:57] total surrender from all of us for the
[37:02] lords of God is God of gods and Lord of
[37:06] lords
[37:07] a great God a mighty and a terrible with
[37:10] regarded not person nor
[37:13] take certain ones you can't breathe you
[37:16] can't you can't bribe God hallelujah he
[37:20] can't be here God if you just do this
[37:24] I'll do that you should never make such
[37:25] a promise why because we are failures to
[37:30] begin with we make fake we make mistakes
[37:33] every day thank God for the blood of
[37:36] Jesus right like I said it is the blood
[37:40] of Jesus Christ that pulls us out of our
[37:42] reasoning that gets us out of the
[37:45] trouble our reasoning has gotten us into
[37:50] it's nothing but the truth for the Lord
[37:53] your God is God of gods
[37:55] now casting down like second Corinthians
[37:58] 10:5 I'm not going to be long tonight
[38:00] casting down imaginations and every high
[38:03] thing that exalts itself against the
[38:07] knowledge of God and bringing it into
[38:10] the captivity of every thought to what
[38:13] the obedience of Christ there you go see
[38:16] without the Holy Ghost you can't do this
[38:18] only Christ can pull every imagination
[38:22] every thought everything that exalts
[38:25] itself against the word you said or what
[38:27] do you mean when you have given your
[38:30] heart and life to the Lord Jesus Christ
[38:32] and the devil say you nothing
[38:34] hypocrite then it's your duty to remind
[38:38] the devil
[38:39] pull that thought back put it under your
[38:42] foot and says no sir I've been saved not
[38:48] only saying now but I was saved then
[38:51] right and the blood of Jesus Christ has
[38:54] cleansed me from all unrighteousness
[38:57] you've got to preach back to the devil
[38:59] because the devil brings reasoning and
[39:01] sometimes he builds a good case against
[39:04] you and the Bible has already said we
[39:08] have all sinned and come short of the
[39:10] glory of God
[39:11] our righteousness is out of ourselves
[39:14] hallelujah whoa somebody help me here
[39:18] our righteousness is of God he became
[39:21] our said and I've had plenty of it that
[39:25] we might become the righteousness of God
[39:26] he gave it to me I'm going to wear it
[39:33] reasoning like I said is the act or
[39:36] process of a person you know mean you
[39:38] you trying to figure it out there's a
[39:39] process for me in your mind like a
[39:41] mathematical equation right and then you
[39:46] come out two plus two is four right but
[39:51] what about God's Way God multiplies
[39:55] hallelujah he said well how does God
[39:57] multiply God multiply in such a way to
[40:01] every number he multiplied comes out to
[40:03] be one is that right the Bible says
[40:08] there was a number that no man could
[40:10] number that was in the bride and it was
[40:14] one bride so God's mathematic does not
[40:21] equals man's mathematics man's
[40:24] mathematic kids only get him somewhere
[40:27] maybe in this dimension maybe the fourth
[40:28] dimension right we know that demon power
[40:32] travels through fourth dimension so now
[40:34] they can actually do things in the
[40:36] fourth dimension and bring it into this
[40:38] dimension by technology right seeing
[40:43] things and seeing angles that you and I
[40:45] can't see but the computer is programmed
[40:48] way that it can take those things that
[40:50] you put out there and bring him into
[40:53] existence I think Troy just built up
[40:56] what was it that you built at your house
[41:00] huh a printer right but that printer had
[41:04] to be able to see something that we
[41:07] couldn't see with our natural eye
[41:09] another part of that drawing or whatever
[41:13] the case may be we can see it
[41:14] 3-dimensional but it had to go into
[41:16] another dimension to bring it here so
[41:19] that we can feel it and see it and you
[41:21] know what I'm saying
[41:22] so you and I understand by God's grace
[41:25] and then this word that we have is the
[41:28] only word how can I say it
[41:31] it translates your soul right so because
[41:36] once you are once you and I'm coming to
[41:38] something here once you have been
[41:39] baptized with the Holy Ghost
[41:41] sealed however you want to put it it
[41:43] literally translates your soul into
[41:47] another dimension and what God is trying
[41:51] to get us to do is work the works that
[41:54] he would work from that dimension you
[41:58] understand me in that dimension amen
[42:01] that's what Abraham did he was able to
[42:04] call those things that be not as though
[42:06] they were is that right remember when
[42:10] Abraham was up there to offer Isaac
[42:13] Isaac was the Lamb of God in this
[42:17] dimension but in the other dimension the
[42:21] Lord said I have prepared myself I love
[42:23] that in other words God Himself came as
[42:27] a sacrifice hallelujah and he took a ram
[42:31] from somewhere and brought it in visual
[42:34] and in this third dimension it was so
[42:38] real which it was real
[42:40] Abraham was able to sacrifice that ram
[42:44] unto the Lord will somebody help me you
[42:48] said what are you talking about Jesus
[42:50] though he was in this dimension
[42:53] hallelujah he knew that all power in
[42:56] heaven and earth was given unto him way
[42:59] before he was crucified
[43:01] hallelujah why because he was the Lord
[43:03] of glory oh my caboose about it he could
[43:07] reach into that other dimension because
[43:10] his faith and his soul says yes
[43:13] hallelujah when your faith in your soul
[43:16] says yes all things are possible is that
[43:20] right you say Oh Lord
[43:21] I believed I'm healed well if you
[43:23] believe you heal you I heal wait for the
[43:26] manifestation of it hallelujah look look
[43:30] Jesus went into that dimension I don't
[43:32] know how he did but I could hardly wait
[43:35] to see what that bread tastes like
[43:37] hallelujah but you know it had to be
[43:40] good the bread and fish had to be good
[43:42] he didn't he didn't come it didn't come
[43:44] up like dough it came up as hot bread
[43:48] and fish come on say the multitude Wow
[43:55] because he stopped understand it is our
[43:59] duty to stop thinking like men and start
[44:03] thinking like gods
[44:04] we are not regard but we are portion of
[44:07] him we are the offspring according to
[44:10] acts right we are the offsprings of God
[44:14] is there anything too hard for God
[44:17] hallelujah that's why he taught his
[44:20] Saints he taught his disciples
[44:22] whatsoever you ask in my name believing
[44:25] that you shall receive it it will be
[44:27] given unto you but the Bible tells us
[44:31] that in our patience possess ye are so
[44:35] right because faith and patience got to
[44:39] work if you ask for something you gotta
[44:41] wait only we don't know how long it took
[44:44] for this world to come into existence
[44:46] but it came and it had to come cuz God
[44:50] spoke it hallelujah so is it with the
[44:54] believer hallelujah is that right think
[44:57] about it Elisha under that anointing
[44:59] said it will not rain a drop of rain
[45:03] until I call for it
[45:08] what is it
[45:09] he recognized who he was and that's the
[45:13] thing that the bride of Jesus Christ
[45:14] need to come into recognizing who she
[45:17] really is
[45:18] is not my power is not by might but it's
[45:21] by my spirit saith the Lord
[45:23] you understand me you've got nothing to
[45:26] do with it
[45:26] it's the only thing you need to do is
[45:29] let your soul love the Lord with all
[45:32] your heart come on love it with all your
[45:36] heart with all your mind with all your
[45:38] strength
[45:39] hallelujah and your never doubting hmm
[45:47] is that right so you got to understand
[45:50] well brother saw in someone like I was
[45:52] saying this the other day sometimes we
[45:55] all gifted we all got different gifts
[45:56] some got more than the other and there's
[45:59] no reason why we should compare
[46:00] ourselves one with another that's
[46:02] foolishness right because you didn't
[46:04] give yourself that gift every good and
[46:06] perfect gift come from God right and
[46:09] understand when you're born again when
[46:11] you really see God everything leaves you
[46:14] accept the gifts in which God gave you
[46:16] that remains but all of your old self
[46:19] has to die in a rot right I'm coming to
[46:23] something here
[46:24] second Corinthians 10:12 says for we
[46:27] dare not make ourselves of the number or
[46:30] compare ourselves with some that commend
[46:33] themselves but they measuring themselves
[46:36] by themselves and comparing themselves
[46:39] among themselves are not wise it is not
[46:45] the will of God hallelujah i'ma show you
[46:48] that's why even the prophet of God said
[46:50] he didn't want to have nothing to do
[46:52] with that kind of a thing I got a quote
[46:54] for you coming Amen from the Palmer
[46:57] where I'm a locust in caterpillar he
[46:59] said I have nothing against the voice of
[47:01] healing but the trouble with the voice
[47:03] of healing here's what I got away from
[47:06] it here's what I got away from it he's
[47:09] saying this is why I got away from me it
[47:11] glorifies the man instead of Christ hmm
[47:16] Christ is what we want to get glory
[47:19] in other words we're not anything
[47:21] without it he's gotta be the all in all
[47:25] they need a prophet day and a king Dana
[47:28] priest hello
[47:29] the Bible tells us when the lamb took
[47:32] the book according the Book of
[47:33] Revelation right the fifth chapter I
[47:36] believe it is the Bible said are the 12
[47:39] 24 elders took the crown and they threw
[47:42] them down why because they realize
[47:44] everything that he they had accomplished
[47:47] was not by human effort but everything
[47:51] they accomplished is because of the
[47:53] grace of God and you got to understand
[47:56] if you get to heaven it ain't because
[47:58] you work so righteously it ain't because
[48:00] you thought he was just holy holy no
[48:03] shot it was because of the grace of God
[48:05] and the election of God is what takes us
[48:08] there
[48:09] hallelujah and if that be the case we
[48:12] are all in the same pot like they say
[48:15] part can't call kettle black
[48:17] right that's it we all in the same pot
[48:21] and if we're gone is that right the
[48:25] Bible said all sin I'll have seen is
[48:28] that right Revelation says there was no
[48:30] man upon the earth that was worthy
[48:33] worthy to loose the seal or to look down
[48:38] upon nobody was worthy there's only one
[48:42] where are they and that's Jesus Christ
[48:44] our Lord and the Bible said we are
[48:46] accepted in the beloved not by your
[48:51] watch not by your deeds even though we
[48:53] do ours we do Hardys is only because we
[48:56] want to show God our gratitude we're
[48:59] grateful that God has had mercy upon us
[49:03] hallelujah is that Alright so you
[49:07] understand he said they said he said in
[49:09] Christ is what we want to get glory this
[49:12] man got a tent and out this seat this
[49:15] one out see you know how people who I
[49:17] got so many over here and I got so many
[49:19] I got a bigger Church than you
[49:20] I got a greater following nonsense it
[49:24] makes us nothing right we're nothing but
[49:28] six foot of dust by the mercy of God he
[49:31] said if we got what we deserve
[49:33] we'll be we would be in hell every one
[49:38] of us trumpets in all hello amazing
[49:44] grace that's all his amazing grace you
[49:49] know I think God for every victory I
[49:51] have had in my life because I realized
[49:53] he gave me the victory thanks be to God
[49:55] who gives us the victory through our
[49:57] Lord and Savior Jesus Christ it ain't
[49:59] you wouldn't mean it's God in us Paul
[50:02] said is not either do the work right
[50:03] jesus said that is not I that do the
[50:06] work even Jesus who was the son of God
[50:08] where God was in the fullness of in his
[50:10] body he said is not me it ain't the
[50:12] flash man that's doing this work
[50:14] your flesh can't do nothing but fail you
[50:18] you know what you came to being on
[50:19] finish when you need flesh to run it a
[50:23] feint on you you see people get so
[50:28] scared they just drop
[50:29] I said that's how it is with a lion he
[50:31] ain't got to do nothing most of us will
[50:33] see your lion come with faint yeah oh
[50:38] stand still like in shock right he won't
[50:42] have to worry about his free meal it's
[50:44] just there don't even have to work for
[50:46] it at least the dumb animals got enough
[50:49] sense to run but we your flesh will fail
[50:55] you every time that right you're getting
[50:58] a you get enough food or good things
[51:00] you're getting this good thing of
[51:02] praying all of a sudden if you're not
[51:04] careful to check your flesh it's going
[51:05] to slow you down and eventually it's
[51:07] going to stop you that's just the way
[51:10] the flesh work right so your flesh will
[51:13] fail you that's why Jesus Jesus told
[51:16] Peter them when they went they come on
[51:18] come on over here now he no heat they
[51:20] had faith but they weren't perfect in
[51:22] their walk yet but he said come on
[51:24] follow me I need you three Peter James
[51:27] and John to pray for me pray with me
[51:28] took him to the Mount of Olives and they
[51:32] thought it was a sleep over something
[51:34] they fell asleep in a time of prayer
[51:38] when God needed him the most come on
[51:41] somebody faith hope and charity he took
[51:45] all three of him
[51:47] these deer fell asleep he said what are
[51:50] you telling me you can't even pray with
[51:52] me one hour but he understood Jesus
[51:56] understood and he says I know the Spirit
[52:00] is willing but the flesh is weak thank
[52:03] God for the amazing grace of God see
[52:05] reasoning you got a cast down reasoning
[52:08] cast down God don't want you two to have
[52:11] reasoning why because reasoning always
[52:15] tries to find a way out
[52:18] faith don't reason yo Joe say don't you
[52:23] slay me I'm going to trust you right he
[52:27] never faith this night reasoning ain't
[52:30] gonna gonna fake you know it's gonna
[52:32] mess you up if God said do it a certain
[52:35] way you must do it that way if God said
[52:38] don't do it don't do it cuz that's how
[52:44] so many souls lose the influence by
[52:49] reasoning you know what I mean
[52:51] lose the influence of the Holy Spirit
[52:53] and it's possible not that the Holy
[52:56] Spirit is gone but lose the influence
[52:59] because we reason God want to dance or
[53:02] you want to dance or shout or say Amen
[53:04] and and and the devil will have you by
[53:07] reasoning looking around to see who else
[53:09] is doing it right and when you do that
[53:13] all of a sudden God moves back a little
[53:15] bit every time you reason God away he
[53:20] fake reason without faith it's
[53:23] impossible to please God see the soul
[53:26] the soul is gonna either thirst for that
[53:28] which is good or that which is bad it
[53:31] craves it has to be fed and if it's not
[53:36] converted its gonna crave
[53:39] evil things if it's converted is gonna
[53:42] go crave heavenly things that's just it
[53:46] right you love the Lord he said if they
[53:55] arise according to the ruling
[53:56] Deuteronomy 13 one through five if they
[53:59] arise
[54:00] among you a prophet or dreamer or dreams
[54:05] and give it the assign or wonder and the
[54:09] sign or the one that come to pass where
[54:12] he spake unto thee saying let us go
[54:15] after other gods which has not which
[54:19] thou has not known and let us serve them
[54:22] that is he said if this prophet got a
[54:24] good girl right because remember Balaam
[54:27] was a real prophet but Balaam which was
[54:30] what directing them in the wrong way
[54:34] alright let's go over there the Moab
[54:36] let's join up with them amen let's have
[54:39] a big old banquet in the party right God
[54:42] says when they do that I don't care how
[54:43] weird a gift is you know the word
[54:46] worship the Lord thy God and him only
[54:50] hallelujah that's the thing you and I
[54:53] must be careful and we must understand I
[54:55] don't care how supernatural it appears
[54:57] to be if it doesn't match up with the
[55:00] word leave it alone
[55:02] stay with the word reasoning is what
[55:07] takes you away from God faith if you
[55:10] have faith in the world it'll take you
[55:12] to your destiny don't follow that thou
[55:17] should not hearken unto the words of
[55:18] that prophet or that dream dreamer of
[55:21] dreams for the Lord your God proven you
[55:24] to know whether you love the Lord your
[55:26] God with all your heart and with all
[55:28] your soul in other words God puts you in
[55:31] that position
[55:33] is that right oh come on somebody
[55:36] we're never kanessa built that image
[55:39] under Daniel Daniel had faith in God and
[55:44] Dan you knew the Word of God but look at
[55:48] all of the other Jews that were in
[55:50] Babylon right and then you knew that
[55:53] that man admired his person so much that
[55:57] he built that image unto unto heaven
[55:59] thinking he was building an image you
[56:01] know for like say doing God a service
[56:04] without his will right amen
[56:08] but Daniel held fast right and he was
[56:11] thrown into the Lions Den but what about
[56:13] all the other Jews
[56:14] you see it's just like religion well
[56:16] will bow down to it like the mark of the
[56:18] beast we're gonna we gonna submit
[56:20] ourselves and but we know in our hearts
[56:22] that we truly believe in one God God
[56:26] puts us to the test right now that we
[56:31] say what do you mean that's why the
[56:32] image that's why we look and we see the
[56:34] image of the prophet and so many people
[56:36] they go the wrong way with it there's
[56:38] only one God and his name is the Lord
[56:41] Jesus Christ and that's who we brought
[56:46] you thank God for everything God has
[56:48] done in our hour hello but we only give
[56:53] homage to the one who saves us
[56:55] oh come on somebody it's true anyhow see
[57:00] you must understand like I said your
[57:03] soul is gonna either crave good or evil
[57:06] but at the same time you must understand
[57:08] at one point in time your soul is gonna
[57:10] be extracted you going to die if the
[57:15] Lord tarry now some of us might take a
[57:16] rapture here but only normal you're
[57:20] gonna die aren't y'all happy when you
[57:30] say Paul says hey I desire to go when
[57:34] you really really save you get so tired
[57:36] of this world you don't know what I mean
[57:38] come on pop thought it was rough in his
[57:40] day hey if you can see what's happening
[57:42] now I don't know whether you live in it
[57:45] so you and I must understand Amen that
[57:48] yeah one of these days your soul is
[57:50] gonna be extracted and there is nothing
[57:53] to stand on your behalf other than your
[57:58] soul whatever there is what would be
[58:03] presented if your soul has been been
[58:06] born again and you got Christ in there
[58:09] then you're going upward if you know
[58:14] snakes like holes so therefore if you
[58:18] don't be born again that serpent is
[58:21] there you go down into that big hole
[58:23] alright we call it hell so my
[58:27] my point is is to know that you and I
[58:29] must understand that man does not live
[58:32] by bread alone but by every word that
[58:35] proceedeth out of the mouth of God
[58:39] hallelujah I'm almost done
[58:43] so you and I must know one thing that we
[58:48] must allow our souls to be wrapped up
[58:52] and tied up and tangled up into the love
[58:58] of God right and his love the pub said
[59:02] passes all understanding when you love
[59:06] God with all your that's the first
[59:08] commandment love the Lord thy God with
[59:11] all of your heart with all of your mind
[59:14] with all of your soul with all your
[59:15] strength right because let me tell you
[59:18] something a born-again soul has the
[59:21] strength of God and that's what we fail
[59:26] to see the the born-again soul has the
[59:31] strength of God he said according to
[59:34] axises after which the Holy Ghost has
[59:36] come upon you you shall receive power
[59:38] and that word translated from the Greek
[59:42] until until the English is Authority you
[59:46] shall receive power after which the Holy
[59:49] Ghost has come upon you you have the
[59:51] authority what authority the authority
[59:55] that God gives you at the time you
[59:58] become a son and daughter of God you can
[1:00:02] move mountains huh Jay atmospheres
[1:00:08] change situations hallelujah by being a
[1:00:13] son and oh but it must come by faith
[1:00:15] your strength lies in your faith in the
[1:00:22] word if the Bible says we can do all
[1:00:27] things through Christ that's exactly
[1:00:30] what it means we can do all things
[1:00:33] through Christ who strengthens us there
[1:00:37] Stan
[1:00:50] yeah it's like when David met Abigail
[1:00:54] and she says David you a man whose love
[1:00:58] is wrapped up in God called David had
[1:01:02] done so much made mistakes but nobody
[1:01:07] had a doubt on whether David loved God
[1:01:09] or not and even when God told David
[1:01:13] David because what you've done I'm gonna
[1:01:14] spank you I'm gonna make all your
[1:01:17] children turn against you you know what
[1:01:20] David said I rather fall into the hands
[1:01:23] of God in the hands of man why cuz we
[1:01:28] can be so merciful less we can be
[1:01:32] treacherous it's the truth you know for
[1:01:36] some reason when it comes to each other
[1:01:37] we forget that it's grace we get all
[1:01:41] righteous and holy and we think that we
[1:01:43] can stand there and judge someone else
[1:01:44] and none of us are worthy of judging the
[1:01:49] only judge is the word no man is the
[1:01:54] word we're all we at the end of the day
[1:01:56] we're gonna judge judge the world yeah
[1:01:58] it'll be by the word cuz Jesus Christ is
[1:02:00] the judge the Bible will judge you no
[1:02:04] man you love the Lord I love you
[1:02:12] and I live Bible
[1:02:17] you wish yes sir
