[44:03] tonight we pray in the name of jesus

[44:08] you can be seated
[44:11] amen this
[44:12] experience where jesus was
[44:16] entering into jerusalem
[44:21] was an experience they've been
[44:22] prophesied
[44:24] that was to happen ever since
[44:27] ever since uh
[44:29] adam and eve had lost the access to the
[44:31] garden of eden this moment has been in
[44:33] the wings waiting
[44:36] where jesus would have an opportunity to
[44:38] enter in
[44:40] the lord being praised having communion
[44:43] with the saints amen gathered together
[44:45] in one city but as he walks in he he
[44:48] goes into the city and
[44:50] being worshipped and being praised
[44:53] fulfilling prophecies
[44:55] amen he walks into that temple that was
[44:57] dedicated you know and
[45:00] dedicated to the name of jehovah and he
[45:02] walks into the temple and he
[45:04] says he looks around at all things
[45:08] he went through and he
[45:10] inspected the temple
[45:12] he looks around at all things and
[45:15] then as he
[45:17] go after he inspects all things he walks
[45:20] back out and goes all the way back to
[45:22] bethany
[45:23] and that's where he sleeps that night
[45:26] you know i i
[45:27] i don't know if any of you remember i
[45:29] preached a message quite a while back
[45:31] called making room for the word
[45:34] coming from the time when elijah was
[45:38] traveling to and fro about the service
[45:40] of the lord and that rich woman she she
[45:43] saw that he was constantly passing by
[45:45] her house and
[45:47] and she's she told her husband i
[45:49] perceive that that's a holy man of god
[45:51] that is going by her house all the time
[45:53] and she told her husband she says let's
[45:56] make a little room
[45:58] for this man let's make a little room on
[46:01] the side of our house so that when he's
[46:03] going by and he's weary on the journey
[46:05] that he might he might stop because he
[46:07] had been coming by and he would eat
[46:08] supper with him but then he would just
[46:10] take off again so he could get to where
[46:12] he could spend the night
[46:13] and they were and they thought that
[46:14] maybe if they prepared a place for him
[46:16] that he could stay a little bit longer
[46:19] amen as they they she talked to her
[46:22] husband he says yeah we can do that and
[46:23] they they dug down into their bank
[46:25] accounts they dug down into their
[46:26] resources they dug down into all that
[46:28] they had their laborers and all that and
[46:30] they they built a little room on the
[46:32] side of their house
[46:35] to make room for the word of god
[46:38] to make room for the holy one
[46:40] to make room for the one god's chosen
[46:43] amen as they made a little room for them
[46:46] they put a little bed and a table in
[46:48] there and a chair and this little lamp
[46:50] stand there and the next time the
[46:52] prophet came to eat with them that they
[46:54] are fellowshipping over the word and he
[46:56] began to get tired and he thought i must
[46:58] be getting on there you get to a certain
[46:59] place with my nightfall and they said
[47:01] why don't you just
[47:03] wait a little while
[47:05] why don't you just we got a little room
[47:08] prepared for you
[47:09] you don't have to be hasty you don't
[47:11] have to go any further you can stay
[47:13] right here and be at rest
[47:17] you know and when you
[47:20] read the story a little bit further you
[47:22] find out that those people were blessed
[47:24] by that
[47:25] amen they made room for the word of god
[47:28] in their lives
[47:30] as they made room for the word of god
[47:32] that the the prophet is the one that the
[47:34] word comes to
[47:36] as they made room for the prophet
[47:39] as the prophet was laying there in the
[47:40] bed that they had made for him
[47:43] then as he was laying there all of a
[47:45] sudden
[47:46] a vision came to him
[47:49] he called his servant he said go get
[47:51] that woman
[47:53] and he called her and
[47:55] said woman what do you need
[47:58] and she says
[47:59] we don't need anything we're
[48:01] we have plenty to eat
[48:03] nice house
[48:05] we have needed nothing
[48:07] we're well satisfied jehovah has
[48:09] provided
[48:11] amen
[48:13] and all of a sudden
[48:14] elijah's servant
[48:16] says but sir
[48:18] they don't have a child
[48:20] they don't have a son
[48:22] they've been crying out for a child and
[48:25] they've been waiting for the time that
[48:26] god would heal them
[48:29] and the prophet looked at the woman and
[48:32] found out that that was so
[48:34] and as the
[48:36] word was resting there
[48:38] as when the it was when the word began
[48:40] to be at rest
[48:42] now he had aten in that house many times
[48:46] now he had had many fine meals there
[48:49] he had many fine worship services
[48:52] but it wasn't until he actually made
[48:54] himself at home there
[48:56] it wasn't until the word is actually at
[48:58] resting there
[48:59] yo you can you can come to church a long
[49:01] time
[49:02] before you see the word of god acting in
[49:05] your life
[49:06] you can come to many fine worship
[49:08] services
[49:09] you can come to this place and raise
[49:11] your hands and praise god all you want
[49:13] you can break down the palm branches and
[49:15] wave them you can you can get the cult
[49:17] ready hey man you can put the blanket
[49:19] over the colt you can lead jesus into
[49:22] jerusalem you can worship him but when
[49:23] he gets into the temple and he looks
[49:25] around at all things like mark said
[49:31] says that when jesus he went into the
[49:33] temple after being worshipped after
[49:35] being praised after being they said
[49:37] glory hosanna to the highest god is
[49:40] entering into a city the holy one is
[49:42] entering into his city the messiah the
[49:44] king of kings the lord of lords is
[49:46] coming back to jerusalem the anointed
[49:48] one of the messiah is entering into
[49:51] jerusalem praise his holy name amen but
[49:53] when the holy one came into his temple
[49:55] and he begins to look around
[49:59] something about it just
[50:01] didn't make him feel very welcome there
[50:07] now in solomon's day
[50:10] when that holy one entered into the
[50:12] temple
[50:14] oh the
[50:15] cloud came down
[50:17] the fire came upon the altar
[50:19] the those the the singers couldn't sing
[50:22] anymore the instruments couldn't play
[50:24] anymore the the worshipers couldn't
[50:26] worship anymore oh they were stunned
[50:28] they were in awe at the mighty god that
[50:31] came down like this cloud that came and
[50:34] filled the room and all of a sudden god
[50:36] himself
[50:38] was in his temple amen
[50:40] what a revival
[50:42] we have seen jehovah this day
[50:44] jehovah has come and made his abode with
[50:46] us
[50:47] amen has set forth a generation of peace
[50:50] a generation of riches a generation of
[50:53] wealth a generation of a people that are
[50:55] living at ease worshiping their god amen
[50:58] as the time of solomon the son of david
[51:01] was on the throne and it was a time of
[51:03] peace but here comes the true son of
[51:05] david
[51:06] the true solomon
[51:08] the one that that was prophesying of but
[51:11] when he comes into the temple he isn't
[51:14] it just didn't have the same effect
[51:16] he didn't they they might have given him
[51:18] lip service but then a few other days
[51:21] after that they're ready to crucify him
[51:23] amen
[51:25] amen
[51:27] after all the worship and all the praise
[51:30] and all that thing he just
[51:31] you know i'm just not welcome here you
[51:33] know jesus won't stick around very long
[51:35] if he's not welcome
[51:37] amen anywhere his where his word is not
[51:39] welcome
[51:40] he's not welcome
[51:42] amen and when you allow things contrary
[51:45] to the word to continue in your life
[51:48] god's not welcome there
[51:49] amen
[51:50] we've got to be in a place where god is
[51:52] welcome in our life and if you're ever
[51:54] once going to call yourself god upon the
[51:56] scene amen you got to have a place where
[51:59] god is welcome you're not just paying
[52:00] lip service to him on a sunday or
[52:02] wednesday but you got to have a place in
[52:04] your life where he hasn't just come to
[52:06] dinner every once in a while hey maybe
[52:08] where the word has come to stay amen
[52:10] place has been prepared in your heart
[52:12] this is where the word is going to live
[52:14] this is where he's going to move and
[52:15] live and have his being amen
[52:18] rock of ages place for me lord let me
[52:21] hide myself in thee oh cleft of the rock
[52:24] place for me
[52:25] why was that cleft there
[52:28] why was that cleft there
[52:32] we weren't there anymore
[52:34] amen a bride had been taken out of his
[52:36] side and it left a little a little cleft
[52:38] there he said thomas thomas why are you
[52:41] doubting take your hand push it into my
[52:43] side
[52:46] why was that cliff there
[52:48] because there was a bride they've been
[52:49] taken out
[52:51] and mother shall leave her father
[52:54] or the daughter shall to leave her
[52:56] father and mother amen and there was to
[52:58] be separated amen but then they'll be
[53:00] joined right back together and so as we
[53:03] were crying out rock of ages cleft for
[53:05] me lord let me hide myself in thee
[53:09] you're making room for that word
[53:11] making room for that place a place where
[53:13] to where god is worshipped a place where
[53:16] god can be comforted a place where god
[53:18] can can be a rest as jesus said the the
[53:22] foxes of the earth they have dens amen
[53:24] the birds have nests amen but the son of
[53:27] man has no place to lay his head
[53:30] well i pray he has one now
[53:32] amen is he i pray that he has one now he
[53:35] went all over the place and and he
[53:37] he he he he never had anything that he
[53:40] actually owned that's right even though
[53:41] he never had a place there's no home
[53:43] that you can go to and say this is
[53:44] jesus's house
[53:47] left you're a
[53:49] poor man
[53:50] amen
[53:51] maybe a garment that someone had given
[53:53] him
[53:54] amen even that was taken from him
[53:56] amen
[53:58] but he owned something that he had to
[53:59] borrow a tune to be buried in they say
[54:02] amen
[54:03] but he owned it all
[54:05] the meek shall inherit the earth and you
[54:07] don't get any meeker than that that's
[54:08] right amen but he's
[54:11] left his
[54:12] father and came to this earth
[54:14] amen that's what the prophet saying when
[54:17] he said they'll leave their father and
[54:18] mother amen they're clean that's why
[54:20] that's why they had to look like that
[54:22] separation he left the father behind
[54:24] right amen
[54:27] to look like a separation that's where
[54:28] that trinity doctrine came in they
[54:30] didn't understand the separation but
[54:32] it's prophesying of a bride of christ
[54:35] there's prophesying of the day of bride
[54:37] will be revealed
[54:38] amen
[54:40] amen when there is no room the word just
[54:42] passes on
[54:44] but there's a chance that there's an
[54:45] opportunity for that word to remain
[54:47] amen if you can call jesus
[54:51] amen
[54:54] amen one of uh brother brahms messages
[54:57] that i i
[54:58] you know there's so many that i enjoy
[55:00] but there's
[55:02] one that i've just listened to over and
[55:04] over and over again
[55:06] and it's all the ones that are titled
[55:08] blind bartimates
[55:10] i don't know what it is about that mess
[55:12] those messages but i just i've always
[55:14] appreciated those
[55:16] amen i know i think it was last year or
[55:18] the year before sometime i went through
[55:20] and then in one chain i just listened to
[55:22] all 10 of them or however many it is all
[55:24] in a row hey man because i just wanted
[55:26] to grasp that story
[55:28] amen of
[55:31] a
[55:32] blind man that was begging
[55:34] amen that he
[55:36] he had no hope
[55:39] everything really had been taken from
[55:41] him
[55:41] here he is as a son of abraham
[55:44] living in the promised land where all of
[55:46] god's promises are supposed to be but he
[55:49] is destitute he's poor
[55:51] he's blind and he's begging
[55:54] amen
[55:55] but as everything has been taken from
[55:58] him and he's sitting there at jericho
[56:01] sitting on a rock that fell there by the
[56:04] power of god
[56:08] that when when when joseph or when
[56:11] joshua was was circling the city those
[56:14] seven days in a row and on the seventh
[56:16] day they circled seven times and when
[56:19] they said the circle in silence don't
[56:21] make one peep but they all sat at the
[56:23] loud make one shout oh
[56:28] and the walls
[56:30] they were so thick and so wide that they
[56:32] could run chariot races
[56:34] on the top of those walls
[56:37] all of a sudden they began to shake and
[56:38] they began to tremble and they began to
[56:40] fall down at the power of almighty god
[56:45] and here hundreds of years later
[56:48] there's a blind child of abraham
[56:51] sitting on one of those stones
[56:53] by the name of bartimaeus
[56:56] he's living in the promised land but
[56:57] he's not enjoying any of the promises
[57:02] he's the son of abraham but
[57:05] he's been told not to have the faith of
[57:06] abraham
[57:08] he's been trained and brought up to not
[57:10] believe in the things of abraham could
[57:12] happen to him that he could inherit the
[57:14] land like abraham was promised
[57:17] well that's a shame
[57:18] you know it's not you know god's people
[57:20] aren't supposed to be like that no sir
[57:22] hey man you can sit on some scripture
[57:24] for so long but you know there's got to
[57:26] become a day when those scriptures begin
[57:27] to come to pass in your life
[57:29] hey man you can sit in your in your
[57:32] chair all broken down and not seeing the
[57:34] promises for so long like bartimaeus was
[57:37] but there's got to come a time where the
[57:39] bride of christ begins to shake herself
[57:42] amen and wake up from those things and
[57:45] realize that the the day has come to
[57:47] inherit these promises
[57:49] amen not just to stare at some a message
[57:52] from a day gone by amen or to or to
[57:54] stare at this or to stare at that but to
[57:56] realize that this is the message
[57:59] that this is the day that this is the
[58:01] hour this is the time for the bride of
[58:03] christ amen
[58:05] to get good at inheriting the promises
[58:07] of god amen
[58:11] amen
[58:13] in my notes from long ago i got this

[59:43] to ascend up on high and he and he and
[59:47] as they're staring there he was obscured

[1:00:28] the positives
[1:00:30] we're living in a day in an hour where
[1:00:31] the bride of christ
[1:00:34] is to be revealed that she will trust in
[1:00:36] the word amen there is going to be one
[1:00:38] that made room for the word
[1:00:41] amen now there's going to be many that
[1:00:42] have temples that are named after some
[1:00:44] man

[1:00:47] is now at the temple jesus walked into a
[1:00:49] temple what was the name of that temple
[1:00:51] it was named herod's temple
[1:00:53] why was it named herod's temple
[1:00:56] well because
[1:00:57] he's the one that paid for it i guess i
[1:01:00] don't know
[1:01:01] amen
[1:01:02] but jesus walked into a temple that was
[1:01:04] called herod's temple
[1:01:07] and they were his disciples were all
[1:01:09] look at these beautiful stones and look
[1:01:11] at these great columns and he looked at
[1:01:13] me says i tell you the truth
[1:01:16] not one of these stones will be left
[1:01:18] upon another and let me tell you all of
[1:01:20] these denominational walls and these
[1:01:22] great systems and things that we look
[1:01:25] upon these last days not one of them is
[1:01:27] going to stand not one stone will be
[1:01:29] left upon another
[1:01:31] amen
[1:01:33] amen you know everyone paul said
[1:01:35] everyone has to be careful how they
[1:01:37] build
[1:01:39] the kingdom of god
[1:01:41] now everyone has been called to be uh to
[1:01:44] build upon those that have built before
[1:01:46] us
[1:01:47] amen amen paul was that wise master
[1:01:50] builder the bible says he laid a
[1:01:52] foundation
[1:01:53] amen a foundation of prophecy amen the
[1:01:56] foundation of the word to to bake a
[1:01:58] strong foundation in christ
[1:02:02] now he
[1:02:03] said to us
[1:02:05] every man has to build on this
[1:02:08] but some are going to build with
[1:02:10] wood some will build with straw some
[1:02:12] will build with these things but he says
[1:02:14] in the last days
[1:02:15] it will all be tried by fire
[1:02:18] amen and the fire will try every little
[1:02:20] bit of it to see what sword is amen and
[1:02:23] when that structure comes through the
[1:02:24] fire all that's gonna be left is the
[1:02:26] purified structure of god which is the
[1:02:29] bride of christ
[1:02:32] now if you've been busy building out
[1:02:34] straw and wood and things of this world
[1:02:36] let me tell you you might be saved but
[1:02:38] that's you just got to be it's by the
[1:02:41] skin of your teeth and we ain't called
[1:02:42] to be saved like that amen he's the
[1:02:44] bible paul says they will suffer loss
[1:02:48] but those that build with the word of
[1:02:50] god
[1:02:52] those that build by the spirit of god
[1:02:54] amen those that listen to the lord and
[1:02:56] listen to the spirit of god they say
[1:02:58] lord what shall i do this day lord what
[1:03:00] those that are led by the holy ghost
[1:03:03] they are the ones that are building the
[1:03:04] temple of god amen but those are just
[1:03:08] just living a lukewarm life upon this
[1:03:10] earth there is no promise that you're
[1:03:12] really going to have anything to be
[1:03:13] rewarded of when you get there yeah amen
[1:03:16] if you get there at all
[1:03:17] hey man it's a dangerous place to be
[1:03:19] well how do i get this reward brother
[1:03:21] how do we get this goal
[1:03:23] amen come on
[1:03:25] there's only one way saints yes sir
[1:03:28] just to be led by the holy ghost
[1:03:30] you gotta hear his voice
[1:03:33] now if you're not led by the holy ghost
[1:03:35] let me tell you you can never do
[1:03:37] anything for god
[1:03:40] you can't do it
[1:03:41] you can try you can do bible studies you
[1:03:45] can pass tracks in the street you can
[1:03:48] witness you can memorize scriptures you
[1:03:50] can preach the gospel you can study you
[1:03:52] can do all those things you can praise
[1:03:54] you can raise your hands you can do all
[1:03:56] those things but if you are not led by
[1:03:58] the spirit of god it's all for nothing
[1:04:00] and it will be burned up on that last
[1:04:01] day
[1:04:03] amen
[1:04:05] amen every man's work shall go through
[1:04:07] the fire amen if your work research
[1:04:10] if your work that you have done for the
[1:04:13] lord survives that fire survives that
[1:04:15] purging then you'll receive a reward
[1:04:17] amen amen otherwise you'll just go
[1:04:20] bankrupt
[1:04:21] amen
[1:04:23] amen but jesus he walked into the temple
[1:04:25] and he
[1:04:26] looked around you know what you know
[1:04:28] what he didn't see anything there
[1:04:31] that was what he was looking for
[1:04:34] isn't that a shame
[1:04:38] there was a temple that was up in the
[1:04:40] heavens
[1:04:41] because moses saw it
[1:04:43] and he came down and he made that
[1:04:45] tabernacle according to the pattern
[1:04:48] but there's no word about what
[1:04:50] inspiration herod had to rebuild that
[1:04:51] temple
[1:04:54] there's no word about whether that
[1:04:56] temple why that temple was worthy to be
[1:04:58] called the temple jehovah
[1:05:01] amen the babylonians had destroyed it
[1:05:03] they came back out of the babylonian
[1:05:04] captivity and they rebuilt something but
[1:05:06] there's no word that says exactly
[1:05:10] that the cloud ever came down that the
[1:05:12] pillar of the fire ever appeared
[1:05:15] amen
[1:05:18] jesus walked in and instead of saying
[1:05:20] this is a good place for me
[1:05:22] this is where i've longed to dwell
[1:05:25] instead he walks out and says not one
[1:05:26] stone to this will be left upon another
[1:05:30] amen
[1:05:32] and he went and he went down to bethany
[1:05:36] spent the night down there
[1:05:37] the word came and the word left
[1:05:40] you know there's one thing to bring
[1:05:41] jesus upon the scene but it's another
[1:05:43] thing to get him to stay
[1:05:45] amen it's one thing to bring jesus upon
[1:05:48] the scene in your worship service
[1:05:50] amen or if when you pray when you have a
[1:05:52] knee but it's another thing for
[1:05:54] to get him to stay day by day to walk in
[1:05:57] the spirit amen amen but let me tell you
[1:05:59] that's that's what we got to get to
[1:06:00] since
[1:06:01] amen if we're not there then we're in a
[1:06:03] dangerous place we're living in last
[1:06:05] days we ought to be living in the where
[1:06:06] we can testify and say i am living by
[1:06:09] the power of the holy ghost amen the
[1:06:12] trials of life are many but yes i'm
[1:06:14] laying upon the altar amen i'm following
[1:06:16] the leadership of the holy ghost amen i
[1:06:18] got a well-beaten path to the altar amen
[1:06:23] amen
[1:06:26] amen
[1:06:30] blind bartimaeus there he was
[1:06:32] sitting upon that rock and he was
[1:06:34] sitting there blind and he
[1:06:36] felt the warm sun
[1:06:39] as it went came out from behind the tree
[1:06:41] behind the rock wall wherever it was he
[1:06:44] felt the warmth of the sun hit him and
[1:06:46] he could remember back from the day when
[1:06:48] he could see
[1:06:49] back in the day when he could see when
[1:06:51] the sun would rise and the birds would
[1:06:53] sing you know in the in the the fields
[1:06:56] and the meadows and different things and
[1:06:57] he could remember on those days when his
[1:07:00] mother would tell him all those bible
[1:07:01] stories
[1:07:02] about how about how joshua had uh it
[1:07:06] marched around the city of jericho and
[1:07:08] and the walls came tumbling down and by
[1:07:11] the supernatural power of god but now he
[1:07:14] is the child of abraham is sitting on
[1:07:16] one of those stones that fell by the
[1:07:18] power of god and he's sitting there
[1:07:20] defeated
[1:07:22] wondering where did the power of god go
[1:07:26] where did it go he's like just a few
[1:07:29] just a few miles from here is where
[1:07:31] joshua was walking through the field one
[1:07:33] morning and he saw a man with a sword so
[1:07:36] he drew his own sword he said are you
[1:07:38] with us or are you for our enemy
[1:07:41] and the man says nay but i am the
[1:07:43] captain of the host of the lord
[1:07:46] amen and bartimaeus he's sitting there
[1:07:49] blind and defeated began to think
[1:07:52] oh lord jehovah
[1:07:54] if i had been there in joshua's day if i
[1:07:57] had been behind a bush or something
[1:07:59] wouldn't seen that transpire i would i
[1:08:01] would run up to the captain of the
[1:08:03] lord's host and said oh great captain of
[1:08:07] the hosts of the lord i pray that you
[1:08:09] would give me my sight back and i know
[1:08:12] that the lord would give me my sight
[1:08:13] back
[1:08:16] but those days are
[1:08:19] gone on
[1:08:20] no longer here so i just have to live
[1:08:24] with this burden of
[1:08:26] living underneath my privileges
[1:08:29] living underneath where i ought to be
[1:08:31] no longer overcoming but now i've been
[1:08:33] overcame
[1:08:35] it was a shame
[1:08:37] amen as he began to think about some
[1:08:39] other bible stories that his mother told
[1:08:41] him about how
[1:08:43] elijah and elisha had walked down that
[1:08:45] same road that he's sitting on
[1:08:47] he's sitting there begging by the side
[1:08:49] of the road and elijah and elisha had
[1:08:51] walked on that same road on their way to
[1:08:53] jordan
[1:08:56] to go
[1:08:57] pass smite the river jordan
[1:09:00] and uh watch the waters park so they
[1:09:02] could walk by on dry
[1:09:04] ground he started thinking
[1:09:07] those great prophets of lords
[1:09:10] elijah was going to be taken up into the
[1:09:12] heavens in a supernatural chariot of
[1:09:14] fire
[1:09:15] if i had seen them walking their arm and
[1:09:17] arm down to the river jordan i would
[1:09:20] have jumped up off this rock and i would
[1:09:22] have said lord or great great prophets
[1:09:24] are the most high god i would that you
[1:09:27] would give me my sight back
[1:09:31] but i think those days of gone on it
[1:09:34] seems like jehovah doesn't do those
[1:09:36] things anymore
[1:09:42] but as he was pondering those bible
[1:09:44] stories
[1:09:46] he began to hear a noise in the distance
[1:09:50] he began to hear a
[1:09:52] shouting of joy
[1:09:54] shouts of anger
[1:09:56] shouts of insults
[1:09:58] shouts of mocking
[1:10:00] all kinds of noises and he began to
[1:10:01] wonder what's going on
[1:10:03] and he and someone began to tell him to
[1:10:06] testify that god has written risen up a
[1:10:09] prophet like unto moses amen one that
[1:10:11] would fulfill all the prophecies of the
[1:10:13] old testament some of them where the
[1:10:15] where the the blind were seen the lame
[1:10:17] were walking the dead were rising or
[1:10:20] raising back to life again
[1:10:23] when he began to realize that he was
[1:10:25] living in bible days
[1:10:27] he began to realize that that the god of
[1:10:30] jehovah was now entered into a body of
[1:10:32] flesh and that body of flesh was walking
[1:10:35] right down his path
[1:10:39] he began to he jumped up to his feet and
[1:10:41] he
[1:10:42] heard it as it passed by and he was
[1:10:45] afraid that he was going to miss his
[1:10:46] chance so he began to cry and scream out
[1:10:49] and oh
[1:10:50] jesus the son of david have mercy upon
[1:10:53] me have mercy upon me
[1:10:55] and they began to cry out to him you
[1:10:56] know be quiet you're being too loud
[1:10:58] you're making too much noise
[1:11:00] and he began to cry louder and louder
[1:11:02] jesus that son of david have mercy upon
[1:11:04] me have mercy upon me
[1:11:06] his desperation took hold of him amen
[1:11:09] because he began to realize that the the
[1:11:11] god of elijah and elisha was walking by
[1:11:14] amen the god that the god that spoke to
[1:11:17] the walls of jericho was walking by
[1:11:20] god was visiting jericho again
[1:11:23] this time to heal a blind baker
[1:11:26] amen he was his brother braham gives
[1:11:29] that drama he was
[1:11:30] jesus was walking by jericho
[1:11:34] with the weight of the world sins upon
[1:11:36] his shoulder
[1:11:37] going down to the cross to be crucified
[1:11:40] but as he was passing by there was a
[1:11:42] little child of abraham
[1:11:45] that was sitting there blind and begging
[1:11:48] that faith began to rise up in that
[1:11:49] blind beggar's heart and when that faith
[1:11:52] reached a certain reach a certain pitch
[1:11:55] amen that when that faith all of a
[1:11:57] sudden raised up within within
[1:12:00] bartimaeus that he that something just
[1:12:02] meant to strengthen his legs
[1:12:04] something commanded his ankles stand up
[1:12:07] something told his knees you need to
[1:12:08] straighten out and move something spoke
[1:12:11] to his body says you need to get up
[1:12:13] something spoke to his vocal cords you
[1:12:15] need to cry out something said to him
[1:12:17] you need to shout you need to cry out
[1:12:19] you need to cry out to this one amen he
[1:12:22] heard the message of jesus christ the
[1:12:24] son of the living god is passing by this
[1:12:27] way amen
[1:12:29] he cried out cleft to the rock
[1:12:32] amen place for me lord let me hide
[1:12:35] myself in thee oh son of abraham son of
[1:12:39] david jesus have mercy upon me amen and
[1:12:42] he became another joshua
[1:12:46] amen
[1:12:47] right there where joshua had commanded
[1:12:49] the sun to stand still now another son
[1:12:52] of abraham
[1:12:53] is once again commanding the sun to
[1:12:55] stand still
[1:12:57] when the son of david stopped in his
[1:12:59] tracks
[1:13:00] at the set at the noise at the shout of
[1:13:02] a little bigger amen because faith had
[1:13:05] risen up in his heart
[1:13:07] hey man jesus he he walked into the he
[1:13:10] walked into the temple and he didn't
[1:13:12] find a whole lot those praise worthy
[1:13:13] going on there
[1:13:15] but when he looked into bartimaeus's
[1:13:17] heart
[1:13:18] he says that's my son
[1:13:21] amen and his story has been
[1:13:23] how many people were healed in those 10
[1:13:25] meetings that brother branham held by
[1:13:27] that title
[1:13:29] just think about that
[1:13:31] 10 15 messages that brother bran
[1:13:33] preached under the title blind
[1:13:34] bartimaeus
[1:13:36] each one has a prayer line after
[1:13:40] where supernatural things were done
[1:13:41] right here in our day amen
[1:13:44] where someone will be in the audience
[1:13:45] and he would say your name is is
[1:13:49] john smith
[1:13:51] and you're from kentucky
[1:13:53] and you're not here for yourself but
[1:13:55] you're you're here for your loved one
[1:13:58] and you're crying out for him but let me
[1:14:00] tell you you have a greater problem than
[1:14:02] robin a couple of me says you're not
[1:14:04] even a christian before you can salvate
[1:14:06] before you need a
[1:14:09] healing for your loved one you need to
[1:14:10] get saved
[1:14:13] amen yourself right there the person
[1:14:14] would give their heart to the lord
[1:14:16] praise god
[1:14:17] how in the world did he know they
[1:14:18] weren't a christian
[1:14:21] there's something there besides brother
[1:14:23] bran
[1:14:26] there was a visitation in our day amen
[1:14:29] amen god in our day has visited the
[1:14:32] people again amen
[1:14:34] amen he's come and he came to all the
[1:14:37] temples of this day
[1:14:38] amen
[1:14:39] he went to the baptist temple he went to
[1:14:41] the catholic temple he went to the
[1:14:43] pentecostal temple he went to every
[1:14:45] temple that had some name tacked to it
[1:14:49] he came
[1:14:51] he went
[1:14:52] and there he goes
[1:14:54] but there's got to be some children of
[1:14:56] abraham
[1:14:57] that began to hear the testimony of one
[1:15:00] that rose the dead amen amen where the
[1:15:02] sick were healed amen and every prayer
[1:15:05] me every prayer line that was there in
[1:15:06] brother branham's messages amen that
[1:15:08] happened in our day amen all those
[1:15:10] things there wasn't brother brown there
[1:15:12] was god that was showing himself to be
[1:15:14] alive and the same yesterday today and
[1:15:16] forever and it happened right here in
[1:15:18] our day he went to the temples and
[1:15:20] couldn't find room amen but there's got
[1:15:22] to be a bride that stands up and waves
[1:15:24] her hand jesus thou son of david have
[1:15:26] mercy upon me have mercy upon me she
[1:15:30] brings jesus upon the scene she stops
[1:15:32] the son of god in his tracks amen as he
[1:15:35] is being crucified the second time
[1:15:39] amen
[1:15:40] amen
[1:15:43] brother branham preaches that message
[1:15:45] where he says
[1:15:48] maybe as an indictment i don't recall
[1:15:49] but he reads those four words from that
[1:15:52] scripture or that four phrases from that
[1:15:54] scripture he says
[1:15:55] there they crucified him
[1:16:00] he says it was right there in the
[1:16:02] gospels and it says there at the end of
[1:16:04] one of the gospels how much one it is
[1:16:06] there's that one verse it has those four
[1:16:08] words
[1:16:09] it says there they crucified him
[1:16:14] brother brahm he breaks it down and he
[1:16:16] says
[1:16:18] there in the holiest city
[1:16:22] amen
[1:16:24] they
[1:16:25] god's holy people
[1:16:28] crucified
[1:16:30] the most painful and horrible death
[1:16:34] him
[1:16:35] the roast righteous and holy man to ever
[1:16:37] live their only hope for salvation
[1:16:40] there they crucified him
[1:16:45] but they might have judged him not
[1:16:46] worthy he came into their temples
[1:16:50] and then he walked by out again and now
[1:16:53] their temple was ruined two thousand
[1:16:54] years later they're still crying out for
[1:16:56] their temple oh they might have that
[1:16:58] little cornerstone that they made 20 30
[1:17:00] years ago thinking that they're going to
[1:17:02] build another temple there in jerusalem
[1:17:04] by the power of some man
[1:17:06] but let me tell you
[1:17:08] without the holy spirit it's not going
[1:17:09] to amount to anything
[1:17:11] they have all the prophecies going on
[1:17:13] over in jerusalem and all those things
[1:17:15] let me tell you and tell the holy spirit
[1:17:17] i know it's 144 000 over there until the
[1:17:20] elijah and moses show up on the scene
[1:17:23] down there it's not going to amount to a
[1:17:25] hill of beings
[1:17:27] they need the holy ghost
[1:17:29] amen when they get into the holy ghost
[1:17:31] until the bride gets the holy ghost

[1:17:35] right now and he's a stand up on her
[1:17:37] feet as she's been blind too long amen
[1:17:40] she's been sitting there begging and
[1:17:41] underneath the promises of god for too
[1:17:44] long amen for that time where she has to
[1:17:46] cry out to the one that's passing by
[1:17:49] jesus outside david have mercy upon me
[1:17:52] i'm living in the promised land but i'm
[1:17:54] not inheriting the promises o lord god
[1:17:56] have mercy upon me
[1:18:00] amen there's got to be one
[1:18:02] amen let's uh
[1:18:07] let's turn over to isaiah
[1:18:09] 42.
[1:18:16] in isaiah 42
[1:18:19] and the 42nd chapter and the 43rd
[1:18:21] chapter both it has a
[1:18:23] just a long chain of thought here
[1:18:27] and as god is introducing
[1:18:31] the messiah
[1:18:34] he's introducing that there's going to
[1:18:35] be a deliverer
[1:18:38] in isaiah 42 1 he says he starts out
[1:18:41] with this one word he says
[1:18:43] behold
[1:18:46] the word behold there means look
[1:18:50] i want you to look at something
[1:18:53] i want you to stop what you're doing i
[1:18:54] want you to look at this
[1:18:56] he's commanding the jews to stop right
[1:18:59] now look at this
[1:19:02] he says behold my servant
[1:19:04] whom i uphold
[1:19:06] my elect and whom my soul goliath i have
[1:19:08] put my spirit upon him he shall bring
[1:19:10] forth judgment to the gentiles he says
[1:19:13] he shall not cry nor lift up nor cause
[1:19:15] his voice to be heard in the street a
[1:19:17] bruise read he shall not break the
[1:19:19] smoking flacks he shall not quench he
[1:19:21] should bring forth judgment unto truth
[1:19:24] he shall not fail nor be discouraged
[1:19:26] until he has set judgment in the earth
[1:19:28] and the isles shall wait for his law
[1:19:31] amen
[1:19:33] verse six i the lord hath called thee in
[1:19:36] righteousness and will hold thy hand i
[1:19:39] will keep thee and give thee for a
[1:19:40] covenant to the people for a light for
[1:19:42] the gentiles
[1:19:43] you know there's got to be a light to
[1:19:44] come to the gentiles
[1:19:46] there's got to be something that will
[1:19:47] come to the to the seed of the slain and
[1:19:50] the gentiles dormant they're aiming to
[1:19:53] shine on and when that light shines on
[1:19:55] them it begins to warm up the soil
[1:19:59] as the soil begins to warm up and it's
[1:20:01] all sudden those blind bartimaeuses
[1:20:03] begin to hear the sound and the distance
[1:20:06] the sound of healing amen the sound of
[1:20:09] rejoicing the sound of god passing them
[1:20:11] by amen
[1:20:13] amen go down to uh
[1:20:17] verse 21
[1:20:19] or verse 18 it says hear ye deaf and
[1:20:22] look ye blind that you may see amen that
[1:20:25] was the problem is god's children they
[1:20:27] were blind and deaf i mean how could god
[1:20:29] reach them
[1:20:30] but god somehow had to heal the
[1:20:32] blindness and heal the the deafness
[1:20:34] first amen i mean he did that 2000 years
[1:20:37] ago in the natural hey now he's got to
[1:20:40] do it right now in the spiritual amen to
[1:20:42] get us to hear to get us to see
[1:20:45] amen
[1:20:48] verse 20 he says see many things thou
[1:20:51] observest not opening the ears be here

[1:20:54] verse 22
[1:20:56] but this is a people that is robbed and
[1:20:58] spoils
[1:21:00] they are all of them snared in holes
[1:21:01] they are hid in prison houses
[1:21:04] they are for a prey and
[1:21:06] none delivers
[1:21:08] therefore a spoil
[1:21:10] and none says restore
[1:21:15] you know there's got to be a people so
[1:21:17] there's like someone that cries out
[1:21:19] the store
[1:21:21] well that was the problem that he had
[1:21:22] right there is there's the people that
[1:21:24] are living there in bondage but there's
[1:21:26] there's no one crying out restored
[1:21:29] here's the promises of god but there's
[1:21:31] no one crying out for them
[1:21:33] there's gotta be someone that can bring
[1:21:35] jesus on the scene
[1:21:37] now brother branham was the wave sheath
[1:21:39] right
[1:21:40] amen he was the first one to come to
[1:21:42] maturity
[1:21:43] amen he is way before a generation amen
[1:21:46] what if people were restored under that
[1:21:48] waving
[1:21:49] but where's brother branham
[1:21:52] well he's been taken off the scene
[1:21:55] well he was the first one to come to
[1:21:56] maturity amen
[1:21:58] there's got to be more like that to come
[1:21:59] to maturity
[1:22:01] amen not to have that same ministry
[1:22:03] but to have that same faith
[1:22:05] to realize who they are he came to bring
[1:22:08] a bride for to tithe isaac amen they
[1:22:11] came to bring a bride to christ and she
[1:22:13] will be just like him amen
[1:22:16] amen
[1:22:19] amen
[1:22:20] there's all these names upon the lamb's
[1:22:22] book of life
[1:22:24] amen they've been laying there
[1:22:26] waiting to come to maturity
[1:22:29] amen but those names are not just names
[1:22:31] like you would think
[1:22:32] john or mary or martha
[1:22:35] but those names are characteristics
[1:22:39] amen characteristics of jehovah that are
[1:22:42] assigned to specific people
[1:22:44] every single person has a has a
[1:22:47] characteristic of jehovah a
[1:22:50] characteristic of their creator that's
[1:22:52] been assigned to them that they are here
[1:22:54] to manifest that characteristic they're
[1:22:56] here to show a forth amen there is a
[1:22:58] seed that has been given to them amen
[1:23:00] there's a theophany that is standing
[1:23:02] there that is there that is there to
[1:23:05] they're there to manifest what their
[1:23:06] theophany is speaking of amen
[1:23:11] but it doesn't come until the sun begins
[1:23:13] to shine on the soil and it begins to
[1:23:15] warm and the moisture of the uh you as
[1:23:18] you come to the church services and all
[1:23:21] of a sudden that faith begins to rise up
[1:23:23] in your heart just like a rising blind
[1:23:25] bartimaeus heart amen when that faith
[1:23:27] begins to realize that you're not just
[1:23:29] reading about the bible not just reading
[1:23:31] the bible every once in a while but
[1:23:32] you've now you're living in bible days
[1:23:35] and you yourself have become a bible
[1:23:37] character amen you now are now living in
[1:23:40] the pages of the bible
[1:23:44] and the characteristics of god are
[1:23:46] living inside of you
[1:23:48] amen
[1:23:51] jesus
[1:23:52] sent the disciples out two by two and
[1:23:54] they
[1:23:55] came back rejoicing and they said lord
[1:23:57] even the devils are subject to done to
[1:24:00] us according to your name and they're so
[1:24:02] excited about the power of god and jesus
[1:24:04] looked at him he said
[1:24:06] don't rejoice because devils are subject
[1:24:08] unto you
[1:24:09] he said nobody rejoice because your
[1:24:11] names are written upon the lamb's book
[1:24:12] of life in the heavens
[1:24:15] amen
[1:24:17] amen your god-given characteristics
[1:24:21] have to be manifested in this last day
[1:24:24] everything else will be burned up amen
[1:24:26] amen your job will be burned up your
[1:24:28] house will be burned up every single
[1:24:30] thing will be burned up and the only
[1:24:31] thing will be left will be the things
[1:24:33] that you have done through the power of
[1:24:35] the holy ghost amen
[1:24:38] amen the only things that will be left
[1:24:40] for you is the things that you did
[1:24:41] underneath the leadership
[1:24:44] of the holy ghost
[1:24:45] every single one of us must be led amen
[1:24:48] every single one of us must be led every
[1:24:51] single member of the bride of christ
[1:24:53] will be led by her husband
[1:24:59] and in the last days
[1:25:01] as the holy spirit begins to lift up off
[1:25:03] the earth
[1:25:05] those that
[1:25:07] live and serve in the temple of herod
[1:25:12] they might have had many fine worship
[1:25:13] services
[1:25:15] they might have enjoyed jesus walking
[1:25:17] into their temple every once in a while
[1:25:19] they might have enjoyed the presence of
[1:25:22] jesus in their midst
[1:25:24] but let me tell you he's gone off to
[1:25:25] bethany
[1:25:28] he came to the temple and he's left
[1:25:33] but in
[1:25:35] hebrews 13 12 i believe it is you know
[1:25:37] 13 8 is jesus is the same yesterday
[1:25:40] today and forever but i think it's in
[1:25:42] hebrews 13 12 where paul is continuing
[1:25:45] on he says you know those that are still
[1:25:48] down there
[1:25:50] 20 years after christ they're serving in
[1:25:52] the tabernacle they're they're still
[1:25:54] serving in the temple and they're still
[1:25:56] worshiping at that altar but you know
[1:25:58] what we have an altar
[1:26:01] that those priests have no right to come
[1:26:03] to you at this altar
[1:26:05] oh they might be they might be thinking
[1:26:07] that they're serving the alt at the
[1:26:08] altar the one true god but that altar
[1:26:11] has moved on jesus went on to bethany
[1:26:13] jesus has left the temple amen jesus
[1:26:16] ascended up on high and came back down
[1:26:18] on the day of pentecost and if you want
[1:26:20] to serve him nowadays you got to be
[1:26:21] filled with the holy ghost amen and
[1:26:23] that's the altar that we got to worship
[1:26:25] at that's the ultimate thing we ought to
[1:26:27] praise that amen that's the ultimate
[1:26:29] live and move and have our being amen
[1:26:31] there is an altar that remains for the
[1:26:33] bride of christ and those that serve
[1:26:35] denominations can't eat from this altar
[1:26:39] amen
[1:26:40] amen but if you have found the way to
[1:26:42] that hidden altar
[1:26:44] let me tell you there is a reward for
[1:26:46] you
[1:26:47] amen why because when you begin to eat
[1:26:49] the hidden manna
[1:26:52] serving at the hidden altar
[1:26:55] worshiping the god that hides in plain
[1:26:58] sight
[1:26:59] remember the the veil used to be at the
[1:27:01] temple
[1:27:04] but then after jesus died that veil rent
[1:27:08] where did the veil go
[1:27:10] it went to the hearts
[1:27:12] and
[1:27:13] in hebrews it says that that veil it
[1:27:16] remains on their hearts untaken away
[1:27:19] and if that veil would ever be taken
[1:27:21] away they would see they could turn and
[1:27:24] be saved and be changed from glory to
[1:27:26] glory amen be changed into the image of
[1:27:28] god
[1:27:30] that veil is not at
[1:27:32] the temple in jerusalem anymore now that
[1:27:34] veil is upon the hearts
[1:27:35] god was crucified in plain view there
[1:27:39] they crucified him he was crucified in
[1:27:42] this last days in plain view
[1:27:45] the second crucifixion of jesus christ
[1:27:47] he was crucified in plain view when they
[1:27:51] rejected the miracles and the signs and
[1:27:53] wonders amen
[1:27:56] and now that same veil remains on their
[1:27:58] heart when moses is preached when jesus
[1:28:01] has preached amen when the ministry
[1:28:03] underestimates ministry is preached
[1:28:06] that means for that holy ghost ministry
[1:28:08] the veils upon their heart untaken away
[1:28:10] hebrew says
[1:28:13] if it would ever be taken away then they
[1:28:15] would all suddenly begin to be changed
[1:28:17] from glory to glory
[1:28:19] because when that veil is removed all of
[1:28:21] a sudden
[1:28:23] your heart turns into a mirror and
[1:28:24] begins to reflect the lord jesus christ
[1:28:28] and you begin to be changed and
[1:28:30] then those old habits begin to roll away
[1:28:33] those old dirty habits begin rolling
[1:28:35] away those old things that you wish you
[1:28:37] could get rid of began rolling away as
[1:28:39] you began to stare face to face with the
[1:28:41] lord jesus christ oh you might have your
[1:28:44] trials you might have your hard times
[1:28:45] but they that wait upon the lord they're
[1:28:48] going to renew their strengths oh there
[1:28:50] will be many people that do this and
[1:28:51] many people do that but there's going to
[1:28:53] be a people that are waiting upon the
[1:28:55] lord amen
[1:28:57] those are the ones that are going to
[1:28:58] renew their strengths
[1:29:00] that's what happened to abraham he was
[1:29:02] waiting upon the lord he he sacrificed
[1:29:05] the birds in half he sacrificed the
[1:29:08] sheep in half and he divided everything
[1:29:10] in half and he just laid him there in
[1:29:12] two pieces and then he sat down on the
[1:29:13] rock
[1:29:14] and waited
[1:29:16] and waited
[1:29:17] and waited and the birds had come down
[1:29:20] and tried to eat the sacrifice he'd get
[1:29:21] up and shoo him away he'd see some flies
[1:29:24] over on another one he'd go shoo him
[1:29:26] away and he just waited and waited what
[1:29:28] are you doing there abraham what are you
[1:29:29] doing there oh just waiting
[1:29:32] hours and hours and hours went by
[1:29:34] because he knew that he had sacrificed
[1:29:36] to jehovah
[1:29:39] and he waded away and all of a sudden
[1:29:41] that darkness came upon him amen and it
[1:29:44] seemed like he was going to pass away it
[1:29:46] seemed like he was going to die and all
[1:29:48] of a sudden this burning lamp came down
[1:29:50] and passed through the sacrifice
[1:29:53] amen he was saved
[1:29:56] he was waiting upon the lord
[1:29:58] every single one of us goes through
[1:30:00] those dark hard times where all you can
[1:30:02] do is wait
[1:30:04] you've done every single thing you know
[1:30:06] how to do
[1:30:07] that's it
[1:30:08] amen
[1:30:10] and then you just have to wait for god
[1:30:12] to do the things that only god can do
[1:30:14] amen
[1:30:15] amen
[1:30:16] abraham in that scripture there he
[1:30:18] divided the sacrifices
[1:30:20] that's something god could do or
[1:30:22] something abraham could do
[1:30:24] he he could catch the birds
[1:30:27] he could catch the lamb he could slam he
[1:30:30] could kill him he could divide them in
[1:30:32] half
[1:30:33] he could lay them neatly there and
[1:30:36] separate it
[1:30:38] there was nothing else he could do
[1:30:41] he had to wait for god to come down and
[1:30:42] consume the sacrifice
[1:30:45] he waited he waited the enemy would come
[1:30:47] and try to take the sacrifice away the
[1:30:50] enemy would come again and the enemy
[1:30:51] would come again he just kept shooing
[1:30:53] the enemy away kept shoeing the enemy
[1:30:55] away kept shoeing the enemy away and all
[1:30:58] of a sudden when it seemed like he was
[1:30:59] going to pass away when the the horror
[1:31:02] of death came upon him the horror of
[1:31:04] darkness came upon the bible says then
[1:31:06] all of a sudden he saw this light coming
[1:31:08] from a distance
[1:31:10] and came down past between the pieces of
[1:31:12] the sacrifice
[1:31:13] and god did something for abraham
[1:31:16] that abraham couldn't do himself
[1:31:19] amen every member of the bride of christ
[1:31:21] will have that testimony amen that god
[1:31:23] has done something for me that i
[1:31:26] couldn't do for myself
[1:31:28] oh i i was baptized in the name of the
[1:31:30] lord jesus christ in the water that's
[1:31:32] something you can do i repented of my
[1:31:34] sins yes that's something you can do
[1:31:36] amen but you just got to hold that
[1:31:38] sacrifice there hold that sacrifice
[1:31:41] there and when the enemy comes and tries
[1:31:43] to bring this into your life just chew
[1:31:44] it away amen when the enemy brings this
[1:31:46] into your life just shoo it away just
[1:31:49] keep waiting there waiting there all of
[1:31:50] a sudden when you're when your flesh
[1:31:52] begins to rot when your flesh begins to
[1:31:55] die amen when you begin to perish to
[1:31:57] your own thoughts to your own ideas amen
[1:31:59] all of a sudden that fire comes down
[1:32:01] from heaven and passes through the
[1:32:03] sacrifice
[1:32:04] amen in the lamb of god
[1:32:06] makes way for you and the holy ghost
[1:32:08] fills you amen
[1:32:10] and god does something for you that you
[1:32:12] cannot do yourself
[1:32:14] amen then
[1:32:16] jesus is no longer just coming into the
[1:32:18] temple and leaving coming into the
[1:32:19] temple and leaving but now
[1:32:21] we've made room for the word
[1:32:24] jesus has come to stay i'll be with you
[1:32:26] even in you until the end of the age
[1:32:29] i'll never leave you nor forsake you
[1:32:31] just ask abundantly that your joy might
[1:32:33] be full wherever you bind on the earth
[1:32:35] all bind into the heavens and whatsoever
[1:32:37] you shall say it shall be done unto you
[1:32:40] amen i'll give you the half even unto
[1:32:42] the half of the kingdom
[1:32:44] amen all these promises shall be unto
[1:32:47] you according to the word of god when
[1:32:49] jesus the word comes into your place
[1:32:52] it's when the word was resting
[1:32:55] when the prophet came and went came and
[1:32:58] went came and went had supper ate for a
[1:33:00] while enjoyed the fellowship but
[1:33:03] when they made a bed for him
[1:33:05] when they made a room for him when they
[1:33:07] made a place he could come and stay
[1:33:09] and the word entered into that place and
[1:33:12] the word began to relax
[1:33:15] when the prophet began to relax
[1:33:18] when the word began to relax
[1:33:20] and when the word began to rest there
[1:33:23] and all of a sudden then the vision came
[1:33:26] what do you need
[1:33:28] what do you want
[1:33:29] what can i do for you amen
[1:33:34] isn't that what happened to esther she
[1:33:37] made the feast for the king and he says
[1:33:39] what do you want he's like she's like i
[1:33:41] want you to come to tomorrow's feast
[1:33:43] and he came to tomorrow's feast and he
[1:33:45] says esther what do you want and she
[1:33:47] said i want you to come to tomorrow's
[1:33:49] feast and so he comes to the third feast
[1:33:52] esther what do you all give it to you
[1:33:53] whatever it is to the half of the
[1:33:54] kingdom
[1:33:57] and so is the sow and the word begins to
[1:34:00] rest in our days what do you want
[1:34:02] ask abundantly that your joy might be
[1:34:05] full
[1:34:07] just in closing let's turn to uh
[1:34:10] proverbs 13 12.
[1:34:16] across the scriptures
[1:34:20] yesterday or this morning i believe it
[1:34:21] was
[1:34:33] proverbs 13 12.
[1:34:44] was to be a
[1:34:46] you know god's people have desires in
[1:34:48] their lives
[1:34:50] amen
[1:34:53] hebrews or proverbs 13 12 says
[1:34:57] hope deferred
[1:34:59] makes the heart sick
[1:35:02] but when does but when the desire cometh
[1:35:06] it is a tree of life
[1:35:09] i wish yes i want you to think about
[1:35:11] that
[1:35:12] you know when you hear of these bible
[1:35:14] stories
[1:35:16] you hear of
[1:35:18] a god that is ever present that comes
[1:35:20] upon the scene for his people
[1:35:22] you can have a great hope upon those
[1:35:24] things
[1:35:25] but that never comes to pass in your
[1:35:27] life that makes your heart sink
[1:35:30] amen
[1:35:31] but when the desires of your heart begin
[1:35:33] to be fulfilled
[1:35:37] when the prayers that you've laid upon
[1:35:38] the altar
[1:35:40] begin to be answered and god begins to
[1:35:43] do things for you that you could never
[1:35:45] do yourself amen and that is a tree of
[1:35:48] life unto you amen why is that tree of
[1:35:50] life unto you because that's god himself
[1:35:52] has come in that's when the word has now
[1:35:55] come into your heart amen it's not just
[1:35:57] sitting there like blind bartimaeus oh
[1:35:59] i've heard of all those promises
[1:36:01] i've heard of those promises of old but
[1:36:04] i guess they've just gone by you know
[1:36:06] he's making himself sick sitting on that
[1:36:08] rock every day sitting our rock that
[1:36:11] fell there by the power of god but
[1:36:14] never inheriting the promises
[1:36:16] it makes us the heart sick
[1:36:19] but one day when he began to cry out oh
[1:36:21] jesus son of david have mercy it was a
[1:36:24] tree of life
[1:36:25] had come to him
[1:36:27] amen the tree of life had come to him
[1:36:29] amen was it
[1:36:31] and then all those promises he began to
[1:36:34] be
[1:36:35] what he was what god saw of him before
[1:36:37] the foundation of the world
[1:36:39] and every single one of us has been
[1:36:41] called to be where do these desires come
[1:36:44] from that are in our hearts
[1:36:47] i think about a real true christian
[1:36:51] that's been saved and sanctified
[1:36:55] a real true honest sincere christian
[1:36:59] where do the desires in their hearts
[1:37:01] come from
[1:37:03] all right if it was a sinful desire they
[1:37:04] would just cry out against it
[1:37:07] but there remains those desires that
[1:37:10] that sometimes you don't even know they
[1:37:11] almost seem like a natural desire
[1:37:12] sometimes you know it might be just
[1:37:14] something simple
[1:37:16] but still if when there's a desire there
[1:37:18] don't just ignore those things
[1:37:21] i don't care what it is if i don't care
[1:37:23] if it's a job or
[1:37:26] or just wanting to serve the lord better
[1:37:30] whether there may be natural or
[1:37:31] supernatural because to the bride your
[1:37:33] life is supernatural
[1:37:36] when that desire is when those desires
[1:37:39] begin to be answered in your heart it
[1:37:41] becomes a tree of life to you why
[1:37:43] because that's when the tree of life has
[1:37:45] come to you and it brings you and does
[1:37:47] something for you in your life that you
[1:37:49] cannot do yourself then you can testify
[1:37:52] this is what god has done for me this is
[1:37:54] what god for does when he begins to
[1:37:56] grant you the desires of your heart
[1:37:58] amen don't just ignore the desires of
[1:38:00] your heart but rather take them to an
[1:38:02] altar
[1:38:03] because we have an altar that those that
[1:38:04] serve denominations have no right to
[1:38:07] amen take those desires to the altar and
[1:38:10] watch the tree of life come into your
[1:38:12] life lord and spring up a well
[1:38:14] into a river everlasting amen let's just
[1:38:17] stand
[1:38:19] bringing jesus on the scene
[1:38:23] one time jesus he saw a man of
[1:38:26] paul's had palsy had the
[1:38:28] shakes he looked at me said
[1:38:31] be of good cheer
[1:38:34] don't worry don't be afraid be a good
[1:38:36] cheer
[1:38:39] the man was
[1:38:42] saved
[1:38:43] healed
[1:38:45] delivered
[1:38:46] sins were forgiven
[1:38:49] another time
[1:38:53] the disciples were riding through a
[1:38:55] storm on a boat they began to get scared
[1:38:57] and they looked down the sea and they
[1:38:59] thought they saw a spirit
[1:39:02] and
[1:39:03] they cried out with fear and jesus
[1:39:06] walking on the water said
[1:39:07] be of good cheer
[1:39:10] amen you know when paul had heard these
[1:39:13] testimonies
[1:39:15] heard these stories perhaps
[1:39:19] maybe he hadn't i don't know
[1:39:23] but paul yeah he had he had heard these
[1:39:25] stories
[1:39:26] one day he was
[1:39:28] serving the lord and all of a sudden he
[1:39:30] was in a room and jesus came and stood
[1:39:32] by his side and said to him
[1:39:34] be of good cheer
[1:39:36] use that same phrase he heard his
[1:39:38] friends the disciples speaking of
[1:39:42] then later
[1:39:43] paul was in the same situation one day
[1:39:46] where he was on a boat crossing the sea
[1:39:49] and everybody thought they were afraid
[1:39:50] all the prisoners he was a prisoner
[1:39:52] and the prisoners and the the the the
[1:39:55] jail holders all thought the captain
[1:39:57] they all thought they were gonna sink
[1:39:58] and die all of a sudden
[1:40:00] paul stood up on his feet
[1:40:02] and he began to tell him he began to
[1:40:03] testify some words that he'd heard
[1:40:05] before because now that same jesus was
[1:40:07] inside of him and he said be of good
[1:40:10] cheer
[1:40:11] not one man will cherish will shall
[1:40:14] perish tonight
[1:40:17] amen and what gave paul the right to say
[1:40:20] those words
[1:40:22] to act like he was in the place of jesus
[1:40:25] christ
[1:40:26] to say the same things that jesus christ
[1:40:28] said
[1:40:30] to give life like jesus christ gave what
[1:40:33] what gave paul that authority
[1:40:36] jesus christ came inside of him
[1:40:38] that god was now on the inside of him
[1:40:41] that same jesus that was walking on the
[1:40:43] sea that told the disciples be of good
[1:40:45] cheer when they were afraid
[1:40:47] was now on the inside of paul speaking
[1:40:49] to that captain of the boat
[1:40:52] be of good cheer
[1:40:54] amen we've gone through our storms and
[1:40:56] christ has had told us don't be afraid
[1:40:58] be of good cheer but there's got to be a
[1:41:00] time where you're no longer just being
[1:41:02] afraid but now you're the one speaking
[1:41:04] peace you're the one saying peace to the
[1:41:06] storm you're the one saying be not
[1:41:08] afraid you're the one saying rise up be
[1:41:11] healed
[1:41:13] amen it's your turn
[1:41:16] to walk in the footsteps of jesus christ

[1:41:20] to bring jesus upon the scene
[1:41:22] because i want to tell you the truth
