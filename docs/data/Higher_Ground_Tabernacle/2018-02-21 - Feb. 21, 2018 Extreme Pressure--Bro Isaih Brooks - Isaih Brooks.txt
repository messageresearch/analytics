light shine sing it again Oh shine Oh shine why I need you too Lord shine who lay the lie Amen we appreciate the Lord we need our God to shine on us the purpose of him shining on us is not just for direction but that God may shine on us that that like me dispelled all the darkness we're going to ask that you turn with us to Luke 17 and 29 and then we'll go to Psalms 41 to agree I'm sure all of you are aware that milligram passed today I know he was a messenger 1 in this day amen to those who are of the foolish but thank god they're saved probably God said the only difference between those that will be saved under his ministry versus ours is that God had a pattern but they were made out of the same material it's got a way of cutting us in instead of cutting us out because God did cut some in and cut some out but the beautiful thing about it is that everybody is here to serve God's purpose I'm happy for Billy Graham many may think he's not there I don't know what people think it doesn't matter because everything that he had to do he did Samsom didn't do everything right but that Samson did everything right because God ordained Samson God allowed Samson to be blind to put Samson in a position to serve his purpose and that is to kill the rest of the Philistines as much as Samson I guess if he had a choice he would not have done what he did but who can stop and direct the mind of God God knew what Sam was going to do before Samson was even born I am happy because we know that his going away is significant to our going away hallelujah let's read the word saint-luc 1729 but the same day that lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of Man is revealed one more scripture Psalms 41 through three I trust everybody is happy tonight it is a dangerous time that we're living in it is a soul-searching time you and I must understand this different thing to be born again and another thing to be sealed the born-again experience means that you have accepted Lord Jesus Christ as your Savior sealed mean that you have been matured and God has approved you for a rapture there are a lot of people who are born again but won't make a rapture because they did not complete the seal understand the same Holy Ghost with same spirit that brought them to a sanctification it's the same spirit that can bring them to the baptism of the Holy Ghost as well as the sealing of the Holy Ghost some people teach it differently but as I started this message I realized there is a difference because the blood of Jesus Christ brought the foolish version up to a sanctification which is kind of like a holiness but it's not a complete holiness because the desire to sin is still in them but when God gives you the complete holiness the desire to sin is burnt away so we think God because nothing will be allowed in heaven with the sin nature or desire to sin Isaiah excuse me Psalms 41 two three I waited for the Lord and he inclined to me and heard my cry he brought me up also out of an horrible pit out of the miry clay and set my feet upon a rock and established my goings and he have put a new song in my mouth even praise unto our God many shall see it and fear and shall trust in the Lord let us pray dear Jesus as we stand before us lawyer before you you have seen me throughout the day you have heard my cry you've seen my prayers and my supplication and father I give this night to you we pray Lord tonight that you would bless the service may the word of God find good ground help us now in your name Jesus Christ we pray amen you may be seated one time one thing I do want want to emphasize tonight is that our adversary is real you know it's like you know you can't play with fire without eventually being burnt you and I must understand this is a critical moment in this moment in this time brings on pressure maybe perhaps we were not so zealous are not so sincere until today I don't know the kind of effect that brother Billy Graham's passing has had upon you but it has stirred me up and vindicate it to me what I've been feeling I've been trying to say to this church that the Lord is soon to come and I really believe that with all of my heart I don't know how to explain it but all I can say if the birds knew that the wall of India was going to fall because of an earthquake and they didn't have the Holy Ghost but they had a God looking out for them those of us who have the Holy Ghost of you can't feel that pool to be sincere and the more to be more consecrated and to make yourself ready then there's nothing I can do to help you and the only one that person that can help you is you you've got to get before God and cry out to him because that's what it's all about if you don't give all your heart to God it will show God is requiring us to give all of his heart all of your heart to him there are there is no room for no other idols no idols at all not even yourself there's no room for self worship and that's the truth the Bible said in this day men will become more lovers of pleasures than lovers of God men will love themselves more than they love God I like to entitle this message extreme pressure extreme means to go beyond the boundaries of being moderate you always have a balance maybe this is the balance but extreme means it went way beyond the balance you've heard people under pressure says I just feel like I'm about ready to go out of my mind which is something that you should never do because Satan might take you up on that one day but we say that because the pressure is so extreme and and we don't really know how to deal with that kind of a pressure it's different from all of the rest it means going to the utmost or a very great length in action habit or opinion it's something that sometimes seems absurd but never amen is something that you and I have been designed to handle it may have seen like it may be it may seem like the earlier church had a grade of faith than what we have because seem like they conquered Satan in such a great way many of them lost their lives but we're living in the greatest and the most evil age ever what they dealt with in Ephesus was on another level then what we're dealing with we we are literally dealing with the ant eluvian demons and Satan is doing everything that he can to keep you from making a rapture to be honest with you I'd rather be burned at the stake chopped up or something than to have to experience the great tribulation you and I have no idea it can't even come into your mind or you can't even comprehend what Satan has for those foolish virgins look what he did in the days of Jesus with Herod sent the his soldiers down to Bethlehem to kill all those children that was two years or three years in under up animal net babies they slaughtered right in in while they were in their mother's arms babies and do you think he's going to spare us the fact the matter is is that during that time you won't have no holy ghost feelings there will be no quickening to you there will be no shouting there will be no joy because at that time the mercy seat there is none the blood is off the altar and now you are alone you must become a martyr oh it sounds easy but it's not it won't be but for those who will overcome God will give them rogues at the end it will be extreme pressure it'll be something that you can't it's going to either be faith or no faith at all whatever you have you're gonna have to use it the thing I don't know how how does the foolish virgins make it other than to know that God is God and that the fault is their own pressure y'all know what pressure is a woman when she goes through childbearing for the first time I can't not imagine it because I'm sure she's had imagined in her mind how bad is going to be but it's beyond what she could imagine because she's never been there before understand that's what I'm saying even if you imagine what the Great Tribulation is going to be like it's going to be beyond what you imagined because so you saw that you understand all that belong to heaven will be in heaven except the Jews and God will be their God it Israel so when you when God has the Holy Spirit is lifted from the earth that means Satan is in full swing Satan is ruler he's going to rule earth like he ruled hell that's why the prophet of God said amen that hell and earth is blending and we can see the effects of it look what Hollywood is producing understand those inspiration comes from some where it's not just an imagination it is something that the devil is now impressing upon the people y'all think it's bad and I want to draw a grim picture because I want you to understand what you're trading in your trading hell for heaven you're trading heaven because you're not ready to give up your ways your trading heaven because you don't want to give up your traditions your trading heaven because you don't want to give up your lust your trading heaven ain't meant for foolishness and when it's said and done you're gonna realize you lost everything for nothing the Bible said what was gained ameno what would it profit a man to gain the whole world and lose his soul I'm going slow like this tonight we look at these things and I want to say you know we're in a time like this we need to be sure that the blood has been applied that we are sealed with the Holy Ghost and if we're not we need to get to work you say well how do we get to work down on your knees the blood veil when you're down on your knees the prophet of God was saying in what is the Holy Ghost would be a message I want you to listen to you the Holy Ghost what is the Holy Ghost 1959 1216 a powerful message and I really would love for you all to listen to it because it will tell you where you're standing in God the prophet of God said we're not entering into this just for a protracted meeting I'll say that tonight if I have a preacher sincere message it is tonight I want to enter into this and I want you and have you and have asked you to burn every Bridge behind you and make every sin right that we are coming into this with all our hearts and lies we must come here for the sole purpose of getting our souls ready for the coming of the Lord and for no other purpose and as I have spoken and said that maybe sometime I might teach or say something that may be contrary to what someone else but listen that's the way I believe it I believe it all of my heart amen in order to cgc this message it's the only things can really point you to Jesus John was the only one that can point you to Jesus the real Jesus and what people don't understand is election is one thing the reason why you came to this message because you was elected it doesn't mean that God wasn't dealing with you before you came to the message he dealt with you before you came to the message because she was elected to come to the message right what drew you to this and you cannot it you know we can't help the people bow down and worship the Prophet and all that that has to listen that has nothing to do with truth truth is true and as long as it can be explained in the Word of God you must accept it the beautiful thing about where we're standing today because we know that the property God identified Oral Roberts and Billy Graham as two angels he was the third one the other two amen they were ordained one for the Baptist area and went for the Pentecostal you know what I'm saying these angels were born and raised to call out those out of Sodom right in other words they were foolish but they were chosen to be foolish virgins that was election do you understand me if they were elected to be foolish virgins come on I know I'm not a foolish virgin but had a beard I'd rather be one then not one heaven is where I'm designed to go and we know it was right after the Angels left Sodom the fire fell the same day the Bible says when light went out the fire fell now a day can be a period of time like Jesus said when he was on the cross Amen 2.22 the thief he said this day you'll be with me in paradise hallelujah and understand that Jesus it wasn't exactly it was that day in period in time but Jesus it took three days before he rose and it was after three days that did that that that that that the thief was dead but Jesus was speaking when I get up out of the grave you getting going up to but so sure that day represented a period of time you understand me so when we look at this thing you and I must understand we have been ordained to make a rapture is that right Luke 17 20 29 says but the same day that the lot went out of Sodom it rained fire brimstone from the other and that's not what I'm going for where I'm going where I'm going but I'm starting off this way so that you can understand and then if you're not ready to meet God your time is this is where desperation should come in it's spooky kind of scary because you know what brother Graham said he said Abraham never was in Sodom and how are we going to get out of this mess there's only one thing that can resurrect you and that is the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost is a sign of circumcision when you receive the Holy Ghost it's not I approve of God is God who approves of you hallelujah is now all I've accepted the Lord no the Lord has accepted you it was a a critical thing among the Israelites when they would refuse circumcision and circumcision came only eighth day for every male child that was to move there's four skins and the expression is to remove or to release the Serpent's part in other words circumcision of the heart is to cleanse and to remove the serpent away from your heart in other words when you get the Holy Ghost you don't no longer think like a serpent and that means is Amen that every word of God is a man there is no but when it comes a men to a true born-again believer the know that those of us and i'ma tell you what the coke come from what is the Holy Ghost did you know Amen those who did not receive circumcision was not allowed to fellowship with those who were circumcised remember how the porter got so upset with Moses what was it extreme pressure hallelujah it was it was what Moses was supposed to do but she kept up with the days and she realized that her son was not circumcised and Moses was so busy he did not circumcise his own son so sapore are Zipporah she got that knives and she cut that foreskin up and threw it at him and said you're bloody husband yes she had a temper she was mad with him but she was literally saving her son had he not been circumcised on the eighth day amen he would have been excommunicated from the promises of God only eight day is what day this day this is the day amen of the great convocation this is the beginning of time we have left time and we are in eternity I don't know what you see when you received the Holy Ghost you're no longer a time being you become a being of eternity that's why the devil is trying to stop you from getting it he can't he made me can hinder but he can't because everybody that's predestinated to get the Holy Ghost is going to get it everybody you say Oh Lord you know I'm not sealed yet don't worry it ain't in your hands anyhow God will bring that sealing to you oh yeah if God got to put you on your bed and make you think about everything you ever done so that you could confess every sin on your bed before he take you he will do so and and he will fill you before you leave that's how faithful our God is because God said I've never lost one the circumcision Abraham was approved the Bible said abraham believed God and was counted unto him as righteousness that's justification but when God came about and circumcised Abraham that was mean that God approved of them now that that covenant is sealed don't you know I was in Abraham like Levi was in Abraham so as I and you must understand because he was circumcised I'm circumcised hallelujah you know it's amazing it meant so much because remember even when Stephen was being stoned he said you uncircumcised in the heart and ears you do always resist the Holy Ghost as your father did it so everybody that's in this message that resists the Holy Ghost they are not of our Father I don't understand because I know it's not something that you can work up but let me say it like this you need to pray until your faith can receive that you're the one is comfor see you gotta believe it is for you you can't doubt that that's why the Bible said come boldly before the throne of God you've got to believe that out of all the people in the world you have been ordained to receive the seal of the Holy Ghost that's the only way God can give it to you you have to have faith to believe that he is God and that he is a rewarder of those that diligently seek Him that's why the Prophet SAW said I don't care you come here I want you to shut in all night if it takes all night stay there till you get it he's not telling you to bed god he's trying to get you into an atmosphere where you can believe it's for you ah because most of us have seen we've done so many wrong things too sometimes we think there's not enough grace to cover us oh is that right but the man said a lot of people came up for prayer but they didn't get their healing because they felt unworthy he said but in the prostitute who come up because she knows she's unworthy and she'll be healed Christians didn't receive their healing because they felt unworthy of course you are but he made you worthy you and I must understand that when you're not circumcised you go to fellowship with people that are not circumcised you said what do you mean because birds of a feather flock together there is an attraction but those who got the Holy Ghost will fellowship with those with the Holy Ghost why because you've got something in common is that the truth the Bible said how can light and darkness mix together they can't do it they even know what it means to be in a horrible pit in about nowhere to be in harbour pit that means you have allowed the devil dirt and snare you and something and you can't get out of it and you want to get out of it God how could I get out of this situation I buy my ignorance have allowed Satan to ensnare me I'm trapped but God knows how to break the Fowler's snare he knows how to deliver you out of every temptation the Bible said merely are the affection of those who love him but God will deliver them out of all of them did y'all hear me many are the afflictions of the righteous but God will deliver you out all of them he's my deliverer David knew he said a horrible pit that means it was too deep too high and too wide for me to get out of it hallelujah but when you call upon the name of the Lord the Bible said that he will answer oh my III when I came to God I have I was in a lot of bondage it wouldn't have been wonderful of God if all of those change would have just dropped but they didn't all drop not at one time he did he let some arm drop just to let you know you've had an experience hallelujah but you're justified amen and that's a good feeling to be justified but you got to let the same Holy Ghost that justify you sanctify you hallelujah and when God began to sanctify you you say oh my god this feel really good now that I know that I don't have to do this and I don't have to do that and I don't have to do that and you know for that you didn't do it God don't need your help to be saying I sanctify you you know one moment with God can cleanse you like speaking span right but you got to get on your knees and seek the Lord for that cleansing is that one moment in the presence of God as I said Lord touch my lips and God did what he took the coal off the altar place it on his live sanctified amendment in a moment's time his worldly desires were gone being God broke him into a vision he saw those seraphim's crying holy holy holy y'all understand me Oh God you got a want to be clean though not just in your fresh in your mind in your spirit Lord sanctified me give me that new spirit a man but that's not the end of it you got another you got another experience coming hallelujah and then with that full baptism come amen you think oh my that feels good but it ain't it ain't over yet you still learning now you're in a position that God can teach you hallelujah is that right Abraham said come on and follow me Isaac I'm going to teach you a lesson what was that lesson you must become a tool of sacrifice in the hand of God in order to climb this mountain a what come on I don't remember the scripture where I just said Laura daddy where we going the only thing that Isaac asked was Lord where's the sacrifice and look what Abraham says he laid him on the wood because Abraham had made Isaac his sacrifice and it's Isaac willingly really gave himself to his father don't miss that part right it was a tight it was a type of God in Jesus is that right he he'd never mama and complained to his daddy even when he saw he was the one that he would diss daddy was going to sacrifice to God he never opened his mouth in Burma he went all the way up to the dramatic part of the night didn't ready to come down and Abraham God said Abraham Abraham standing that knife I have gotten myself a sacrifice you understand me but like a lamb Isaac win at the mountain with his daddy hallelujah and so of us if we're going to go up all the way up to through the completion of this thing you got to go like a lamb Lord Jesus whatever your will is I'll follow you it brings on an extreme pressure hallelujah you know it you know as you felt the pressure but he still wouldn't open his mouth why he trusted his dad do you trust you the Bible says trust the Lord with all your heart and lean not to your own understanding you gotta trust him a brother asked me a question today how I'm gonna get out of this I said well the only thing I know is you got to learn how to trust God because God I bring all kinds of stuff at you at one time and you don't know which way to swing the sword hallelujah but you got to understand that God's watching you oh the all-seeing eye is watching you I could J I'm taking it slow cuz I want you to get every little piece of what God is trying to say tonight you and I got a trust guard we know that the Lord is soon to come this is no time to fear it is time to have faith right faith will produce rejoicing faith will produce testimony fear would bring worry you understand me fear automatically bring worry faith brings victory you say well what do you mean the Bible said because of Abraham's faith he called those things that be not as though they were I'm talking about extreme pressure listen David was called by election he was elected call anointed and placed elected by God called from sheep herding to be the king an order to positionally plays you understand me and every individual that's in this bride is called by God anointed by God and placed by God it is not what you do it is what he is doing right how many are I know how often to say I know in my days we used to play with those toy soldiers I loved it and the Indians and all that and y'all don't heard this before but it was in your mind you deter who's gonna win sometimes the win Indians would win and sometime the Cowboys wouldn't it win it all depends what you were playing and in your mind what you wanted all right you take this anything he jump off the rock onto the the the cowboy y'all routes around whatever the case may be at the end time at the end the little toys didn't know what was gonna happen even if they had a mind they still didn't know what you had determined you determine the end I'm gonna say it like that again because right now you determine you say well how could I determine if I'm predestinated because you are predestinated according to your choice before it you made before the foundation of the world is this okay all these people don't expect that this road that we're working with I am excited I'm not excited that Billy Graham died but I'm excited that Billy Graham died if you understand what I'm saying because of what I feel I know now and look at what we're dealing with you got all these people talk about atomic bombs anybody in their right mind know that if you drop a hydrogen bomb there is no way to stop it how you gonna stop it pour some water on it it'll leak that water up like nothing your understanding we know that this world is going to burn because of man's technology hallelujah the prophet of God said that even in the days of entered the ant alluvion day it was the scientists that caused the explosion that tilted the world he said the intelligence of man always backfire always backfire you say what brother they weren't in tell her that they were cavemen you ought to be ashamed of yourself who built the pyramids right now in there right now they have the Arctic they're now exploring the Arctic because the ice is melting and now they're finally pyramids there and they found in palaces that Kings live dead no doubt they found in bodies too but they won't tell you that if they found the body of that mammoth it was a quick freeze when the world exploded and it tilted us back in the flood flipped like that it meant all everything that was there froze instantaneously but they gonna tell you hallelujah no what they only say we're all you know now we realize that we had some aliens from outer space and I'm telling you that's what they gonna say if they're not saying it already but we know the answer to their problem or equation we know what happened hallelujah and now we see science you know you after old God they working with this Collider they gonna they gonna cause up something to happen but I knew that it couldn't end that way because that's not the way the Bible says but my point is they just fidgety in the messing with science they in God's laboratory and it some some point is gonna flip back on them hallelujah somebody I guarantee you whoever dropped the bomb probably thought they done figured it out of my equation how they going to stop that that fire from burning and then gonna realize they've made a big mistake because when they drop a bomb like that they gonna be burnt too we living in the last days folks the angel the last angel disappeared to search your scripture when the angel disappeared the fire fell but we're so bad about it Locke didn't willfully come out the world he didn't fire he didn't with the Angels had to pull him out he didn't say oh I'm ready he was trying to find excuses just like his wife and that's what's wrong with a lot of Christians now they don't want to give up the world of things your time to tell them is getting ready to burn it's gonna happen just as sure as you feel you know yourself God's Word can never fail you bet it all didn't devastate you you got four time you don't have more time there does not be foolish this okay it's extreme pressure because remember the time when God was getting ready to destroy Egypt ahead instructed Moses make sure you put the blood on the doorpost in the left with those young kids you know they just listening to Daddy and mama says well it's gonna be safe we're gonna put the blood on the doorpost a little amen but when they start hearing the screams that was a different story when the Death Angel really came hallelujah those children says nothing are you sure are you sure next-door neighbor screaming are you sure you better be sure because you want to hear the noise we're getting ready to under growth of great pressure and without the Holy Ghost you're not gonna be able to stand that's why the foolish version will say give us off your oil and you know what I want to tell you every mother I told you about those prayer meetings remember I told you that you needed to pray and you wouldn't pray you go pray up hallelujah and what was so dis bad about it the Bible says they came to the door but the door was shut that's the scary part that you nearly had to alter crying and Boo asking God to give you the Holy Ghost that he won't even respond that's the scary part why because we were da Latorre hallelujah Amen we were procrastinators I got more time you don't have more time listen the death of this man has assured us in a way we was assured but we now the next move so what you're saying everybody just to the atomic age and everybody took my block bombing each other up and here's that old men over in Korea saying he got a big bomb and our president said well I got a big he can't help it he's ordained let me accept a toss-up y'all know what I'm talking about don't you know the Satan's eat what we expect you expect an angel in the president's or you expect that one president be a angel and and over here in Russia he's an angel no open your eyes I don't mean no harm they all like Nebuchadnezzar appointed and anointed to do the purpose and the will of God is that right you don't get up there in that position without training with the devil is that the word he told Jesus if you want to get higher I can give it to you all you got to do is bow to me listen what I'm saying it's not my power it's not by might but by my spirit saith the Lord and like I was telling a brother the other day I said you got to know who you are they called Jesus a devil he doesn't almighty called me a devil jesus knew who he was when somebody called you a devil Amen that ought to be bouncing off you because you realize you're to son and daughter of God nobody around here I can't put you in heaven nobody in here can put you in heaven this is between you and God the devil can put you in hell especially when you didn't come from there hell is not my whole y'all understand me we we've got to realize they meant tonight that this thing has been done by God it's not something you can do you cannot do this on your own you're not the Creator he's our Creator and if he created man in the beginning he must create man in the end he is the creator oh come on somebody you're not creating yourself he's creating you he's creating you who had nothing to do with it God created Adam you don't have nothing to do with it God is creating you oh you said well I got a good will to serve the Lord he gave you that none of us saw God God saw us he that begun a good work in you and faithful to complete it it ain't no time to hurry if the Bible said when you see that day approach and look up cuz your redemption draws nigh lift up your hands oh I don't know whether I'm gonna make no I've already made I'm just waiting for the change hallelujah and if I just had a close friend of mine died i I had planned to get there before he died but he had a few bad nights and I said to the Lord just was he yesterday he died out with it the day he died I was just praying I said all I loved him I said you know Lord I said if he's already ready I said just take him no don't let him suffer suffer buddy if he's not because he had backslidden but he had come back to Lord and I said but Lord if he's ready then just take him Lord see if he's not then hold until I get there so I can pray for you know 15 minutes John he was supposed to have six months to live ah boy huh yeah y'all don't understand I don't know whether you see it or not but God heard my prayer I don't like the devil tormenting God's people like that I don't know I know I can't understand it oh my when you know you're secured and the Bob said make your calling in action sure when you are secure and assured when God knocks on my door say brother Bruce are you ready you want to wait around for 15 minutes not even take me now oh my my daughter called me the other day we talked maybe the day I get dates mixed up and she said this young man died about 15 16 years old he died and the relatives are angry at God and McNair and I talked to hold her eyes I said none consider why the Lord put the righteous to sleep don't you know sometimes people die God takes them to keep them from the evil that is to come let me ask you a question if God would say hey you know you're gonna make a wrap or whatever the case may be but I'm gonna put you to sleep so you won't have to experience some of the pressure that's coming before the rapture hello y'all I don't understand why people we hold on to this devilish world and like we love tall men I don't like to be tormented I don't like these battles in my mind but what about all your children somebody left me here they did and you gonna leave somebody - you know we can't save nobody hmm this according to the scripture Psalm 4043 says we have heard with our ears Oh God our fathers have told us what works thou didst in their days in the times of old how thou didst drive out the heathen with our hand and planted them how dog did afflict the people and cast them out for they got they got not the land in possession by their own sword neither did their own arms save them but that right hand died armed and the light of that countenance because thou hath a favour unto death here is somebody don't you understand the only reason why you getting this good treatment is because God favors you you don't call it good treatment the Bible said blessed is the man that heareth the word of God blessed is the man that reads and hear the word of God blessed when the devil say I'm cursed no I cannot be cursed because He blessed me hallelujah somebody else perhaps could have been standing in my place but not so hallelujah could have been standing in your place but not soul who extreme pressure we got to learn how to handle it better absolutely David said the Lord is my light and my salvation whom shall I fear the Lord is the strength of my life of whom shall I be afraid when the wicked even my enemies and my foes came upon me to eat up my flesh they stumbled and fell now every time I see this I would think about when Jesus was giving it to the council and to say all of these soldiers and all they came to grab Jesus and when they got close to him they fell backwards I'm like Lord one of these old days hallelujah the same Jesus that made him fall backwards in his day would be the same either that'll make him fall backwards in our day I believe that we don't have to fear what's coming upon the earth hallelujah the one hosting cats shouldn't camp against me my heart should not fear the war should rise against me in this will I be confident one thing I've desired of the Lord that will I seek after one thing not so much all these other things hallelujah some of y'all y'all some of y'all who was single y'all might not understand it but I tell you what it's alright to be single because now you don't have to worry about a wife call up miss LA you understand me oh I'm walking by myself it's better cuz now you don't have to worry about some other I know that sound crew who but it's the truth you don't think it was an extreme pressure or not we're not constantly trying to keep his wife from looking back I don't know whether using the front aback but wherever he was I think she was in front of him cuz as a gentleman you put your wife first and he's probably trying to tell her don't look back honey or whatever you do don't look back and she stops said no honey don't do it and then she just glimpse how do you think he felt you know he felt bad because after it was all over the man got drunk trying to wash away his memory of his wife dying instantly and you guess she was thinking about her loved ones that she left behind ah y'all understand hey when I'm change I'm not looking nowhere but up it had to be hard on him extreme pressure wherever she was if she was in front of him it was almost in a way a good thing because he could see it happen if he was he was behind him can you express can you imagine it the extreme pressure he had to keep from looking back for his wife god have mercy but he knew what the angel said don't look was I brought you out of Sodom don't look back don't let that desire of what used to be overtake you why because that same desire will cause you to mr. rapture and you will experience a hot atmosphere you will become atomic father for in the time of trouble he oh one thing I've desired of the Lord that will I seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord and to enquire in his temple for in a time of trouble he should hide me in his pavilion in the secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide me he just set me upon a rock somebody sent me or YouTube thing about this man or this uh broadcaster from Israel you know what he said he was talking my Billy Graham's death he said he had just had a dream about Billy Graham and he said in his dream he saw Billy Graham died just before the rapture yeah Israeli yeah he was the Israeli folks now you said well how can this be cheap God is moving God is moving he said he and he said he had never I don't know when he said he heard it before he had heard but he I guess he did a little research and he saw where somebody was saying that this was significant to the rapture and he thought it was something interesting because he had had the dream [Music] we didn't have a dream we had a vision hallelujah and let me say it like this whether it happened tonight or tomorrow it's going to happen this is the day I don't know how long this time spent but listen I actually live with brother brother Tom Brown and system not lived but they were part of my congregation brother Tom Brown and bill doll y'all remember Bill Dowd brother Bevin talked about him a lot amen and and sister Marilyn and some of the other oldest Saints were around brother Branham told me this said that brother Branham told them this is not on record I'm not saying it's on record because it's not but he personally told them he told them that it would be one early Eastown one early Easter and and and this is the earliest that I know of and guess what day it falls on April 1st April Fool's Day I'm not saying it but what if it is how many of us are ready one body somebody said to me well you know how can that be because it's going to be 30 days before it is I said now listen 30 to 40 days dirt they get up they can get up on Easter right and you have 30 to 40 days to go before then right because Easter is the resurrection day hallelujah and think about it it is on the 1st of April I don't know I'm not saying it is and I'm not bringing a forecast but what I'm trying to show you that it's closer than what you think you know I'm not going predicted because the Bible said no man know that they know now but he didn't say we wouldn't know the week or the year so you better y'all better understand it's later than what we think and like I said even if it doesn't happen until whatever it is still being the same day because I can say that day is a time somebody said well don't you know we have a lot of things that happened the Prophet God said years ago God can make a rapture right now still be scripturally right I believe I'm translation saying you don't have to believe it if you don't want to I believe it in 1977 I didn't know nothing about this message absolutely nothing and it was the first time I saw UFOs I saw them you don't have to believe me but I did and I know that what I saw has been let's see you go into YouTube and you see these things moving that's what I saw you know what I was in an Apostolic Church outside the church jumping I couldn't help it something struck me and I was jumping and shouting and praising God and you know what I was saying Lord whatever you do don't let me miss the rapture I didn't know nothing about that kind of stuff and then shortly after that here come the message maybe I'm foolish but it's okay it's what I believe it's more than I believe I don't know how to explain it but I'm gonna share something I got to hurry up here [Music] now them talks about the tit vision how many all know that it's been a doctrine all kind of stuff but I told y'all just not long ago I said you know I had a dream did I tell the dream here i'ma tell it again it was more than a dream I don't know what they called it but a dream but I was in my house and I was in my bed and I was getting ready to go to sleep all of a sudden Satan star bombard in my mind with sexual thoughts trying to get me to receive it and I said oh god I said whatever you do if I'm gonna dream don't let me dream these words almost verbatim don't let me dream of evil things and I close my eyes people before I knew it all I know is I slayed down I closed my eyes and when I closed my eyes I saw two angels coming down from heaven both of these angels and I don't know where the other one went but once stayed with me and this angel began to talk to me now let me say this I would not risk my salvation to tell you a lie because what you're gonna do for me after I tell you this dream ain't nothing you're gonna do for me right and so I'm telling it as a dream because that's what it was I've had supernatural experiences many times but this dream he began to tell me how God much God loved me and dissin any other was a lot of things happening at that time I had an experience like this when I was in Lima I was caught up into a life you don't have to believe it I'm not trying to be anything I'm just telling you an experience you don't have to believe it but it happened and in that light when we were having that revival going on God spoke some powerful things to me I mean for days I was drunk in the spirit laughing and crying at the same time and thought I was going to explode because of the power of God well the same this ain't began to talk to me and everything else I'm gonna tell you it was so beautiful and I'm not I'm not going to fully describe it but I'll just say he was dressed in Eagles feathers I don't know how you would make a garment out of eagles feathers but that's what he was and he part of his garment that looked like lamb's wool all I know well I thought about while I was dreaming whatever that was I thought about Martin when the angel came down and and that angel tried to see who Martin worship me worship me so I said there's an angel I said you're not trying to deceive me oh you don't think you're gonna deceive me you're not trying to deceive me you know I said because I can only love the Lord Jesus Christ he didn't say anything so I got up I realized I was dreaming I guess because I got up and had to go to the restroom I'm home and I was dreaming so I came back from the restroom laid my head down and he was still there that's all I could tell you he was still there so I said to him I thought about perfection I thought three is perfection so let me tell him this again I say don't you know I can only love the Lord Jesus Christ I said it a second time don't you know emphatically a little you know I can only love the Lord Jesus Christ he smiled at me and he left but I had this feeling he's gonna return he's gonna return well I went to brother Yvonne's Church shortly after that hadn't mentioned nothing to him he's just started talking he said brother Brooks he said just a few weeks ago I had this brother from Russia or in the area Russia wasn't exactly Russia he said and and he preached he went to the back of the door and all of a sudden the angel showed up he said he said I was so terrified I was behind the pulpit there you know at the time of the altar call he said I was behind me I was so scared I crawled into the pulpit he said and while I crawled into the I can still see the angel behind me don't you know that man described the very angel I saw to a tee he said and then the brother the brother who preached saw the angel and the angel moved out of the pulpit went down and touched one sister there at the altar she received the Holy Ghost and then all of a sudden the powerful of God just fell in the place [Music] [Applause] I'm telling you my experience but let me tell you this last dream this last dream and I didn't understand it so I'm on how am i explaining it to you because I think I told you about this I'm telling you they're like a dream folks it's a dream in this dream I've never dreamt about brother branham the whole time I've been in this message I've never dreamed about it but this time I had a dream it was on a Saturday night and brother Branham was preaching all that was in this building we were in a building and everybody was dressed in white all of a sudden half of the people left and they rushed out of the building I didn't know what they were rushing out so I rushed it where'd it going I got in my car I tried to to catch up with him but while I was travelling there was a black convertible and I almost hit that car and I kind of turned and when I turned I looked and it was one of my sisters who had going on before but I'm a natural sister says he just smiled at me but that turn made me you turn like this and took me right back to where brother Branham was preaching so when I got there back there like they were waiting on me so when they when they wait when I saw them waiting on me they did this one number and they turn uniformly they just turned toward the west brother branham looked at me and he started freaking there will be a tent meeting there will be a tent meeting there will be a tip meeting well that confused me and then I woke up tent meeting now I'm gonna explain it to you so what happened was on January 31st I called brother Jesse Smith I said brother Jesse you don't have to send me a gift for my birthday I'll just messing with him I said ah but I would love to talk to you so Jesse called me and I started talking and I start telling him about my dream then I told him my dream he's a brother but when you had that dream so I had to think about it I said it was Saturday he's a brother he said I dreamed about brother branham - that same night he said I've never dreamed a trip about brother branham right and he said I said brother branham I said why we don't see all the miracles and the signs and the wonders that the acts Church was doing you know I've been faithful I've been fasting so he said went down the line just short saying what the works he had done you know what the Prophet said to him he said because you haven't given me all of your heart he said then I understood I needed to pray more that's why we're not seeing nothing we haven't given God all of our hearts now why would God have me call as man and we talk about the same thing so I said brother I said he said but brother Brooks he said don't you know brother Branham explained the tip meeting I said no he said he did it he said brother Randy saya showed me a quote where he explained what that was and he sent it to me so I'm gonna read it to you is that okay you know the Prophet God States people went into this tent and they came out on the other side home I'm gonna start with this one sister because it was a lone quote she said I just don't know she said I couldn't tell you what happened she said I have been paralyzed for 20 years and lookie I never was sick right he says now here's something notice close there's a difference between the angel of the Lord in that light because I heard something I'm moving as it does when it comes here at the platform at night kind of like oh and like afar whipping around licking blaze and it left me and it went right down over the top of that audience and went and stood over the top of that little building then settle down on top of it and then when it did this one that was standing by me behind me the same voice the angel voice he said I'll meet you in there and this is the turret pool but nobody wouldn't know nothing about it and I said well I don't understand why is there why that he said I will not it will not be a public show this time and I said I don't understand going into that closet like that and he said it's not written is it not written by our Lord when thou pray be not like the hypocrites who like to be heard before men but enter into the secret closet and pray to the Father who see it in secret and he who see it in secret shall reward thee openly it's perfectly to the scripture everything it is and I said I understand then it took me to this place and set me down in this room where I was at and then he told me that what to do for the third time now Christian's friends that that will that will when I leave this world that will still be in my bosom when I he said but you mark my word what's going to take place so in other words if you want to see the third pool that closet that that that that that rule is your closet as individuals it will not be an open show it will be you and your closet think about it if you in your closet and you've got high blood pressure or you got one leg and you don't met God in that closet and all of a sudden you try to get up and you got both of your legs see that's what he's working with that's what he's working with God himself that's why he said there's a difference between the light and that angel because it was the light that stood over the building when the purifier comes and visit you while you're praying that's what he's talking about that's why he said they're built three times he said to me and now I understood when he he told but he said brother that means prayer when he showed me that it just something lifted I said yes Lord I'm guilty I haven't been praying like I ought to whoo now I know what to look for this is not for everybody you ought to be so blessed that God visited me it ain't brother Brooks for God's telling you something I believe that with all my heart I wasn't gonna even say nothing about it until God instructed me put that in your message well because you gonna need this and I believe if we started really going in our prayer clouds and stop timing ourselves don't worry about an hour or two hours just get down to Jesus show up is that right because that's where the food defender says you give us up your all and we responded you go pray up listen we got God on our side I'm almost done we got God on our side and don't you know is it is the Lord Jesus Christ that makes intercession for our ignorance now we've been ignorant ignorant not long enough folks the Bible said God wants winked but in you know he's that that's what's helping us because God the Lord Jesus is saying Lord didn't mean to do it no let's just stay there English they don't understand what that's all about they don't know they don't understand how devastating that is to their real relationship or whatever the case may be he's the one pleading for us is that the right the Bible said when you don't know how to pray the Holy Ghost were making a sentence for you we've done a lot of things called ourselves right we've done a lot of ignorant stuff that could literally cause us our soul why do we still live because the blood prevails hallelujah I have been elected so you have been elected to be predestinated to be what the bride of Jesus Christ hallelujah who are you brother roots I am the bride of Jesus Christ I say it humbly but that's who I am you can't make the scripture you can't break the scripture you cannot break the scripture people everything that vision dream whatever it has to be scriptural and if it's not leave it alone I could only tell you about dream and like I said I didn't know what it meant but I do now I think I cut off some of that quote so if you want to hear let me see where where did I get it from what I just read it what is that what is a vision 1956 408 if you want to hear all of it listen to all of it let God give you what he means on that because he said it has to happen and so when he said there will be I mean I've been I don't understand that God had brother Jesse to have the other part of the dream and they both go to you same night listen on Joseph or die maker is dying husband the Lord of Hosts is his name and thy Redeemer the Holy One of Israel the god of the whole earth shall he be called what so I came from God I go back to God he is my husband in the beginning ours is feminine part at the end I'm his feminine part you said what do you mean listen revelations 21 9 3:11 says and there came unto me one of the seven angels which has seven vials full of seven last plagues and talked with me calm and Saint cut us totally saying come here the I will show you the bride the Lambs wife I'm not just a bride but I'm the Lambs wife oh come on somebody I'm both of them y'all know what I'm saying in this earthly place you know when the ladies are bribed we treated different until she become the wife but God says no she'll never betrayed t treated different she's my wife and my bride come on Oh y'all don't let me shout for you whoo oh oh you know I love the Lord because you know he's so good to us I've always wanted to know myself what that tip cuz it wasn't scripturally lining up I'm like the propagate add to it God can add to it I said it's gotta be somewhere there in the world it goes all the way back to Sarah I mean scuse me yeah is that right when Isaac got Rebecca where does he take her into his mother's 10 that's with a consecration kicker consummation was made in the prayer closet because you can't die God into this natural sexual thing you got to take him into the spiritual huh it was in the tent Oh Lord Mercy Mercy Mercy y'all understand me extreme you can't God cannot produce its goods without the pressure being there extreme pressure must come now it's when when I'm tried in the fire I shall come out like pure gold so we must be tried all of these things are working for your good is that right the Bombers had a just man should fall seven times in a day but it gets up don't think you're gonna walk in that fall sometimes we do fall but just as soon as we fall we get up is that right brother Alan said we we are we backslide every day anybody anybody know what I'm talking about huh Esther was under extreme pressure when she found out that Mordecai that Haman was going to kill the people how you thinking listen let me tell you something what how did Esther Odessa how did the decibel come Esther it was a lot of pressure a lot of pressure she had to come to a place Amen that she had to watch everything she did right what anointed her what made her want to be queen because maybe in the beginning I'm thinking took a change one thing I love about Elsa is that she never went for the worldliness of all the other women she kept her identity hallelujah she wasn't about all the foolishness of the world and all of the glamour of the world she kept herself clean and pure and as simple as she possibly could and listen she she was always interested in what the King likes no matter what the cause I want to know what God likes is that right and that chamber meant a mint that was her teacher guess what that's what the prophet of God is to us because he tells us all the things that God likes I know y'all don't heard this before but it's feel good to me hallelujah and at the time that she was supposed to show listen God rushed her into that place and you think once you get in the king's palace and everything is gonna be alright once I become adopted and all that everything's gonna be alright oh you got some more trouble coming more trouble she's in the king palace and into her her father my father loved her uncle said unto her don't you think you got to me because in the king's palace don't forget you still a Jew hallelujah if those people would have known what a Jew supposed to be like she would have been uncovered earlier on but God blinded them hmm oh my and you look at this thing and she said oh oh oh what must I do didn't the Lord show she said well I hadn't been summons if I if he don't summons me I'm gonna be killed because it's against the law if the Queen should coming for the King and she's not summons but she said I'm breaking this law today she was on the extreme pressure but guess what you understand when you're under such pressure you must be willing to become the sacrifice because she she was willing to become the sacrifice in order for her people to live did Jesus do that yeah he the opportunity to get married he had all those opportunities but Jesus and I sanctify myself that ye may be sanctified so don't tell me you can't be sanctified if you got no holy ghost if you got the Holy Ghost you can be sanctified because he synched if I do when he sanctified himself right it's the truth anyway she says listen go gather all together all the Jews that are present in the Shushan and fast ye for me and neither eat or drink three days night all day I also in my Mane's with fast likewise and so when I go unto the king which are not according to the law and if I perish I perish man I call a fast here don't you eat nothing for three days oh my goodness I wonder who can make it Oh Lord I shouldn't be laughing but the truth is those people believed in Esther hallelujah don't you understand she was like standing in the gap for her people it's like the bride of Jesus Christ standing in the midst of the golden candlesticks oh that's what he said Mordecai went his way and did according to all that Esther had commanded fresh ah you know and we understand by the message that it's going to be heated seven times hotter Shadrach Meshach and Abednego hallelujah we get ready repeat it man the pressure is coming from the government if you do not worship under this organization or denomination we are going to throw you into the fire hallelujah hey and the prophet of God brings out something he said they never got an answer from God even though they prayed yes there was no breakthrough hallelujah but they said nevertheless he's able to deliver us and if he doesn't deliver us I know well enough I'm not bowing to the devil I'm not bowing to your image because that image is the mark of the beast it has mongrelized the Word of God think about pressure here Jesus is saying they always come I'm almost done the highways come before the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of the sinner's rise and let us go what was he saying he that betrayeth me is at hand I asked you to pray with me for three hours see with prayer come here I thought that you pray with me three hours I can't it ain't him in a few hours and y'all sleeping on the job where is my help see he's speaking like a man now because the Holy Spirit is departed he said no sir why did the angel have to come back and strengthen him so though he's there in the garden pleading for you and me he sweated he prayed and prayed so vehemently till his sweat was like drops of blood follow you ah hallelujah the Bible said he said his face like a flint hallelujah and for the joy of this thing he saw what was it was going the outcome let me say brother eyes he saw you he saw me hallelujah he saw us and he knew he knew he had he not sacrifice himself for us he made the whole thing would have been of no value so he knew at the same time he says they always come that the Son of man should be glorified huh what in other words the time has come where they gonna see who I really am you will see Who I am one of these old days you gonna glorify me that sacrifice that that one who's who gave his life for you hallelujah the Bible said in that while we were yet sinners send us he died for us now if we soon as he died for us what about us who's trying to be Christians we don't love him enough we need to love God lord help us Jesus who Lord hallelujah like that scripture said a woman that when she is in travail have sorrow because her how has come hallelujah he wasn't leaping for joy but then he had joy on the inside that's true you could have joy and yet not so the joy is there and he had joy that's went like a river flowing on the inside he knew what is the what was his strength people you were he saw you he saw me he knew what he was going up that he'll about every time they were hearing he knew you tell me my God loved me my god he loved me so much it meant that he would go through that and then he go throw me away it is me the price is already paid don't let the devil make you feel like you're gonna be lost and ain't no no no no no no I'm so glad God that God we can't sway God with our feelings hey Lord and mercy and you know therefore have sorrow but I will see listen he says let me go it she remained it no more in English right she says as she is delivered of the child she remembereth no more than wish for joy that a man is born into the world I think that's you know once everything is done away with you know that's why he's got the nail-scarred hands and and everything so we can remember what he what he did for us otherwise we wouldn't remember but vision of what really took place what a trophy hallelujah Oh what was it was a Fanny Crosby what was her name that was her name to write her any crosby when they wanted her to sing right for rock and roll she wouldn't do it she said that then the man who's trying to get her to sell her birthright says hey what have you get there and you still blind she says I shall know him I shall know him by the fence all the nails she gave him a lickin didn't you oh gee we realized a man he says and ye should therefore have sorrow but I will see you again and your heart shall rejoice in your joy no man take it from you and in that day you should ask me nothing for verily I say unto you whosoever shall ask the Father in my name he would give it you hear the - have you asked nothing in my name ask and you receive that your joy may be all he wants out Jordan before I can't I can't finish this up but when you're under pressure understand amen we are we have treasures in earthen vessels that's right yeah and the excellency of the power may be of God and not of us hmm we are troubled on every side yet not distressed we are perplexed but not in despair persecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroyed always bearing in about in our body the dying of the Lord Jesus that the life of also of Jesus might be made manifest in in our body but we which live are always delivered unto death for Jesus say that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh I understand that that means we killed our desires that only Jesus can be seen I'm closing on this I got a lot more but I'm a close I'll pick it up later by God's grace Sunday ago but you look at this thing you said what brother what are you saying I'm gonna tell you this if you stay in the word and stay in this message it will produce for you the power of fruits are here is not in the water it's not in the earth is in the tree is in the seed everything that that's in the seed of God that's been given to us before the foundation in the world has the ability to produce every fruit of God that's in it and for those of us a man who cannot produce fruit you can't do it God does it mmm and if that if that scene is that it don't worry yo season coming I always tell people I say you might be here just to do one thing and that's it I love that I love that little boy who had those fishing loaves I love it coz he was ordained just to do that I love that old lady who went up there and gave them two pence cuz she was ordained just to do that right I love that less tan I sure appreciate you coming out I know where's the nice stuff for some of you all who are working don't think I don't appreciate it I really do I really like look at that look that's a good number in here I don't count numbers but you make me feel better when I see you I know the press I know as the press and and I appreciate it and I'm sure God see you God see you in this last day he still got people who love the word your honor when the devil telling you you ain't got nothing something drawing you here it ain't me yeah you understand me it ain't brother Troy it's the word and you know that is that shows there's a sign of life in you you can't love the word I have a desire if you come in and cheat feeding on the Word of God unless something inside of you is eating it your flesh can't eat the word your flesh hates it excuse me only a live soul can eat the word you understand me and your desire to live and do what God wants you to do you think that's yours that's the seed in you Paul said it's not all that live but Christ that lives in me he's at the good that I would that's Paul I can't do what I want to do huh he said every time I try I end up doing what I shouldn't be doing Paul sealed with the Holy Ghost angel are you understand me he still had to battle the flesh hey sometimes we think when we get the Holy Ghost power power Lord oh no they got good that's about a word of Prayer father we so thank you for your grace and your mercy you've been so good to us Lord I'm so excited I my heart my heart goes out for the Graham family losing such a great warrior I pray Lord that you bless him strengthen him the Lord the family at this time of the Reedman and all those that love this man I think I heard the number 315 million people I think he had preached to Lord I trust that they still remain I don't know but Lord I know you said if any man coming to me you will in no wise cast a mouse father I just pray that you bless that family during this time and all of his loved ones are ignored we appreciate your messenger and the message that you have given to us you have you've given us a leap and our faith in our strength and our joy we thank you right now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen it's going on justify the whole ego once again is calling all time we adjusted by bathey ah it's going home time no time and we're full of the Holy Ghost and the body pestering me oh one of these money won't be long you look for me and I'll be gone when I get there ever gonna see it shut there'll be nobody to put me up really give the heaven gonna tell the news how I got over how I got over I'm so glad that the bride is rapturing me it's going home time it's going it's going it's going hey one of these old days we're gonna see amen opposition in Christ because once you receive the seal of the Holy Ghost that's God positionally placing you sometimes we feel like oh well I got it I got it but you know you and I supposed to be experiencing God every day somewhere God should be in your life every day and if he's not then you ought to get concerned because he talks to me every day you love the Lord come brother cuz I don't run out of song but I feel like there's supposed to be another one's own [Music]
