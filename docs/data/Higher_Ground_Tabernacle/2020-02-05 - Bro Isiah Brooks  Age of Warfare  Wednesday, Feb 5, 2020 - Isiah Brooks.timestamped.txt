[21:59] [Music]
[22:04] I'm out of the rhythm god bless you good
[22:10] to be back home as we stand we're gonna
[22:14] get right on into the Word of God we're
[22:19] going to be coming from the scripture
[22:21] according to Isaiah the fortieth chapter
[22:23] I was there 41 and to house there 41 and
[22:39] 2 and then we'll go to 2nd Corinthians
[22:50] 10:3 through 2 through 6 41 and two of
[22:55] Isaiah confidently comfort ye my people
[22:59] says your God speak II comfortably to
[23:04] Jerusalem and cry unto her that her
[23:09] warfare is accomplished that her
[23:12] iniquity is pardoned for she have
[23:16] received of the Lord's hand double for
[23:20] all her sins let's go here to second
[23:26] Corinthians the tif chapter everybody
[23:33] love the Lord we're living in the last
[23:37] days and I guess I can't say that enough
[23:40] you should always try to remind yourself
[23:43] that this age that we're living in is
[23:47] the worst of all ages we may have a look
[23:53] at the age of Thyatira where the church
[23:59] was a dominating female we may think
[24:01] that during the time of Smyrna when many
[24:04] were being killed and slaughtered for
[24:07] the name of Jesus it may look like those
[24:10] ages were the worst of all but
[24:13] in reality this is the worst age of all
[24:16] and I think sometimes we forget we
[24:19] sometimes fail to see what we're working
[24:23] with
[24:24] or what is working against us
[24:27] Satan would love to see the Word of God
[24:30] come back void but the reason why it
[24:33] will not and cannot come back void
[24:36] because it is written that the words
[24:38] that proceeds out of the mouth of God
[24:40] cannot come back and shall not come back
[24:43] void it will accomplish its purpose 2nd
[24:49] Corinthians 2 Tim chapter beginning at
[24:51] the third verse but though we walk in
[24:56] the flesh we do not war after the flesh
[24:59] for the weapons of our warfare are not
[25:02] carnal but mighty through God to the
[25:06] pulling down of strongholds casting down
[25:09] imaginations and every high thing that
[25:13] exalts itself against the knowledge of
[25:16] God and bringing into captivity every
[25:18] thought to the obedience of Christ and
[25:22] having in a readiness of revenge all
[25:25] disobedience when your obedience is
[25:28] fulfilled
[25:30] let us pray Lord we thank you for your
[25:39] amazing grace we thank you for this time
[25:43] and opportunity that you have allowed us
[25:46] to come to worship to praise you to
[25:50] thank you for everything that you have
[25:53] done and will do for us Lord we pray
[25:57] tonight that you would have free course
[26:00] give us grace to move completely out of
[26:03] you a way that your will will be done
[26:07] thank you father for being who you are
[26:11] in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen
[26:27] we would like to just say that we are at
[26:36] a time where maybe I'm the one that's
[26:40] insane
[26:44] but I know there's a scripture says make
[26:47] your call and election sure have you
[26:53] ever thought about it that you won't get
[26:55] another chance this is the only chance
[26:58] you're going to get right now the blood
[27:02] of Jesus Christ protects us all that's
[27:05] why you see sinners who can do what they
[27:07] want to do because of the blood of Jesus
[27:11] that blood encompasses the world it
[27:15] protects us from the judgment of God but
[27:20] once a man died and he is found not
[27:25] under the blood his soul takes a journey
[27:30] in that journey is downward up to a
[27:36] place that he'll never get out of there
[27:40] is no judge there to pardon you there is
[27:44] no blood to cleanse you or to sanctify
[27:47] you
[27:48] however tree falls that's how it lay and
[27:53] this is what is always on my mind the
[27:59] very fact that this is it we can't die
[28:06] and then say God forgive me because now
[28:10] this is the time period that God has
[28:12] allotted unto us so that we can have and
[28:16] make provisions for the world to come
[28:19] there is as you have heard me speak
[28:22] before our upper world we call heaven
[28:26] and the underworld we call hell and
[28:30] men are going to those places each and
[28:34] every day while some are going up there
[28:40] are many that are going down and the
[28:44] Bible tells us that even hell has
[28:47] enlarged itself now you think about it
[28:51] hell has not was not prepared for the
[28:55] souls of men it was actually prepared
[28:58] for Satan and his angels but because of
[29:02] sin many have chosen that way over God's
[29:07] Way nobody goes to hell because of their
[29:12] failures because of first of all we're
[29:14] we're born phase and before we ever take
[29:18] a breath of life into this dimension
[29:21] we're already lost we come in here lost
[29:25] but thank God for the grace of God and
[29:29] the opportunity that God has allotted to
[29:32] every man you and I must understand that
[29:36] this is it this is your time and Satan
[29:42] is doing everything he can do to stop
[29:45] you from entering the kingdom of God
[29:52] even when Jesus was here he told us fear
[29:56] not little flock it is the father's good
[30:00] pleasure to give you the kingdom but
[30:04] understand since the fall mankind has
[30:08] been in a warfare before Adam and Eve
[30:13] sinned it was a blissful situation a
[30:17] place or time and a error that you and I
[30:22] can't even comprehend because since
[30:26] we've been born into this life we've all
[30:28] faced pain and danger and hurt and
[30:31] disappointments and and all of these
[30:34] things have been caused by the breaking
[30:36] of one word I would entitle this message
[30:41] and they're not going to be long but I
[30:43] like to
[30:45] make you know or reefa millyar eyes you
[30:48] with the fact that we're living in an
[30:51] age of warfare and warfare is when two
[30:56] opponents are two opposite comes
[30:58] together and they fight one comes out as
[31:02] a winner the other one comes out as a
[31:05] loser even when it when Cain and Abel
[31:10] was born you know how it happened you
[31:12] know the story good against evil most of
[31:16] our stories most of our movies most of
[31:21] our lifetime stories that we've ever
[31:27] heard has always been good versus evil
[31:29] now in that amazing because the Atheist
[31:33] says there is no such thing as God but
[31:38] everything we do in this life is a based
[31:44] upon this book if there is no God
[31:50] that would lay down laws that you and I
[31:54] could determine the discern what is good
[31:57] and what is evil
[31:58] if this Bible has no bearing if this
[32:02] Bible is not real and if this Bible is
[32:05] not God then what is good and what is
[32:09] evil because we're living in a time
[32:12] where many are calling right wrong and
[32:18] wrong right and it is only because those
[32:24] who are doing that they have no
[32:27] foundation
[32:29] they are the Liberals they are the ones
[32:32] who are denying the existence of God
[32:34] they're the ones who's trying to kill
[32:36] this but you can't kill the Bible
[32:41] because the Word of God is God and it is
[32:46] the thing that's going to judge every
[32:48] man not me not you but this every soul
[32:54] will be judged by the word
[32:57] we call Jesus Christ now you said what
[33:02] are you saying brother if this is your
[33:05] only chance to make heaven what are you
[33:10] doing about it
[33:11] and when God gave me this thought I was
[33:16] in Florida and I thought about the
[33:19] billions of people that are dying dying
[33:25] but they have morals
[33:28] Absalom may have never lied or never
[33:31] stolen or never killed anyone whatever
[33:35] and maybe they thought that in doing
[33:41] these things it would merit them heaven
[33:44] think about the millions of Christians
[33:51] who found themselves in a place that
[33:56] they could not even imagine they would
[33:58] go but you see what happened was God is
[34:04] faithful God will never lead you the
[34:09] wrong way the Bible even tells us search
[34:15] the Scriptures for in them you think you
[34:18] have eternal life you and I realized
[34:22] that there are those who might will to
[34:27] go to heaven might will to be the
[34:30] righteous but you see this is not a
[34:34] situation that God plans something as he
[34:40] go alone
[34:42] this was predetermined this was thought
[34:47] of before it was ever laid out this is
[34:51] something that God has already of for
[34:56] knew because he's God now God doesn't
[35:01] make us do evil evil is a choice it was
[35:09] a
[35:09] ice Amen that Adam and Eve made they had
[35:14] to decide whether I was spending with
[35:16] the word of stand against it and see
[35:19] that's what makes evil evil is when you
[35:22] stand against God and His Word because
[35:27] his word is right think about the
[35:31] millions generations of people who
[35:35] believed in Buddha Islam Allah forever I
[35:43] know this sounds strange but I want you
[35:48] to realize that there are billions of
[35:50] people who are lost because they never
[35:54] came to know Jesus Christ did you hear
[35:57] what I said I said they never came to
[36:01] know Jesus Christ see to even confess I
[36:07] am a Christian won't get you heaven
[36:11] hello whether you want to branch it or
[36:14] not to say all praise God I believe the
[36:18] message I believe God sent a prophet you
[36:21] see but that doesn't secure you the
[36:26] thing that secure you is that the fact
[36:29] whether or not you know him or not is
[36:32] that right because according to the
[36:35] scriptures even in the Christendom
[36:38] many will come in that day and said Lord
[36:41] have not we done mighty works in your
[36:43] name and he will say unto them depart
[36:47] from me you workers of iniquity I don't
[36:51] even know you
[36:53] many who may have gifts of healing gifts
[36:57] of prophecy gifts of all sorts of things
[37:01] have seen miracles at the miracle at the
[37:04] miracle but they fail to know him
[37:09] him who Jesus Christ see he's not a
[37:14] religion he's not the figment of
[37:17] somebody's imagination it is a reality
[37:25] it is a place that you and I have been
[37:28] called to and that is a glorious place
[37:33] and you know how to be so happy that God
[37:37] has called us out of the millions of
[37:41] people in the world because so many
[37:45] people have clothed themselves and
[37:48] religion and religion won't get you
[37:50] nowhere close to heaven in so much that
[37:56] Jesus said that the righteousness of
[37:58] this generation must supersede the
[38:01] righteousness of the Pharisees and if
[38:04] any of you are familiar with the
[38:05] Pharisees the Pharisees was a very
[38:08] astute group of people learn educated
[38:12] smart that could tell you amen put their
[38:16] fingers on a scroll with blindfolded and
[38:19] tell you exactly where the scripture was
[38:22] and what it was they knew it backwards
[38:25] and forwards oh when it came to to
[38:29] perfection they had the outward
[38:31] appearance looking just so perfect and
[38:35] even John the Baptist came along and
[38:38] says but I see you John the Baptist
[38:43] understood that there was not nothing
[38:46] righteous and holy about these people
[38:48] all we were but then they were
[38:50] hypocrites snakes he said you generation
[38:55] of vipers here when I'm saying tonight
[38:58] because you and I must realize it's you
[39:03] in God not me and you and God is you and
[39:08] God you must come to know Jesus Christ
[39:12] for yourself hello is a one-on-one
[39:17] situation we come together we come
[39:21] together as Christians because we have a
[39:25] common goal we have a common entity here
[39:28] we all believe that Jesus Christ is Lord
[39:32] but until that Jesus come into your
[39:36] heart
[39:37] you you don't know him a condo minded
[39:43] man the Bible said cannot even perceive
[39:45] those things that are spiritual that's
[39:49] why people get so thrown off they get
[39:52] thrown off but people call themselves
[39:54] Christians because they see them
[39:56] swearing and cursing and drinking and
[39:58] smoking in all of these things doing all
[40:03] these things one of the worst things you
[40:09] could have a person say to you well if
[40:12] that is being a Christian I don't have
[40:15] nothing to do with it what a testimony
[40:20] this is the age of warfare did you not
[40:25] know that even a baby fights to come
[40:30] into this world there's a battle going
[40:33] on in that womb that she or he must
[40:35] press through the veil a thing that's
[40:41] keeping it from the world to come a lot
[40:46] of pressure I don't know about the pain
[40:48] but I know one thing for certain when
[40:51] the baby comes out nowadays they don't
[40:53] wait for spanking
[40:55] they already screaming in Holland it is
[41:00] a it is a it is a a rough situation is
[41:03] horrible
[41:05] why is just such a little thing like
[41:07] that well I shouldn't have to come
[41:10] through such a horrible way in order to
[41:15] be born into this world all of that is
[41:19] because of sin you know but even so that
[41:23] baby has to fight that that gets here to
[41:27] remain alive what we don't see is all of
[41:31] the germs and all of the bacterias and
[41:34] all of the demonic forces that comes
[41:36] against a child if it wasn't for the
[41:41] immune system that God has set up the
[41:44] child would never make it
[41:46] you understand me what are you saying
[41:48] brother
[41:50] I'm saying even as a newborn babe in
[41:52] Christ if it wasn't for the immune
[41:55] system of the Holy Ghost we wouldn't
[41:58] make it you can't make it without the
[42:03] Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost it's not a
[42:06] jump in a shout or speaking in the
[42:09] tongues and running up and down the
[42:10] house all of that is good I love it all
[42:13] but at the end of the day is Christ
[42:16] living in you what is your ambition what
[42:21] is you what what is what are your
[42:23] thoughts during the day ah
[42:25] is it on God or or is it on the world or
[42:28] the things of the world because the
[42:30] Bible says if you love the things of the
[42:33] world the love of God is not even in you
[42:37] then the Bible can't lie and what is it
[42:41] if there is a love for the world we need
[42:43] to examine ourselves it is a battle
[42:47] people you just don't become a Christian
[42:51] overnight you may be able to profess it
[42:53] but when you become a Christian you're
[42:56] now in the battle field now you're no
[43:00] good for evil you've got to resist evil
[43:04] and clean to the good part there is no
[43:07] way you can do it without the help of
[43:10] the Lord none of us can defeat Satan of
[43:13] ourselves
[43:14] it takes God Himself hallelujah this is
[43:18] your only time you're not to get another
[43:21] chance and none of us know where death
[43:24] is you can't say well when I get older
[43:27] I'm going to serve the Lord today is the
[43:30] day of your salvation is this okay but
[43:35] we understand that there has been a
[43:38] battle thought and there has been a
[43:41] victory won and this was what Isaiah was
[43:45] saying to the children of Israel God has
[43:48] come to comfort you
[43:49] your warfare is over in other words I
[43:53] have seen all of your wickedness I've
[43:56] seen all of your evil deeds but I have
[43:59] comfort to you have come to comfort you
[44:01] and I'm gonna give you a double portion
[44:03] of goodness you see when Jesus Christ
[44:07] came he was our only way out of this
[44:10] horrible place you know every time I
[44:14] read the scripture and David says Lord
[44:16] you delivered me from a horrible pit I
[44:19] think about this place this place is a
[44:24] pit is a hole in the ground hallelujah
[44:28] no good thing it's in this place come on
[44:32] y'all y'all know I'm telling the truth
[44:34] now I'm gonna go ahead and hurry up
[44:37] because I want you to know that we're
[44:39] living in a time where everything is at
[44:41] war not just you nations against nations
[44:46] families against families friends
[44:49] against friends y'all understand me
[44:52] everybody's fighting everywhere nobody's
[44:57] exempt now we're living in a time
[45:00] whether the battles are so intense that
[45:02] if you didn't have this you would lose
[45:06] your mind literally if you didn't have
[45:10] something that you can go back to that
[45:12] could college you in a time that that's
[45:15] most needed
[45:16] you see cuz sometimes people fail you
[45:19] they can't be there when you need them
[45:22] to be there but God can God will never
[45:27] fail you he will always be there
[45:30] you see I look at this thing I said oh
[45:32] my god how many people even in this
[45:35] message resting on religion resting on
[45:41] the fact that they have eyes to see that
[45:44] God sent a prophet they believe it eyes
[45:49] and to see and to hear and deserve that
[45:53] God was in William Branham that don't
[45:57] mean nothing until you get the God that
[46:02] was in William Branham in you it profits
[46:06] you nothing is that right he said what
[46:10] do you what do you what are you saying
[46:11] listen the god that was in loza's was
[46:15] also in joshua
[46:18] that's why they had a new spirit that's
[46:20] why they had a different spirit because
[46:23] the same God that was in lawes's was in
[46:26] Joshua and Caleb and it played his way
[46:28] out when when when Moses went off the
[46:31] scene same God and we're making sense
[46:38] I'm putting putting you on the nervous
[46:41] place I want to put you in a nervous
[46:43] place sheep get nervous when the wolf is
[46:48] around but they have no defense outside
[46:51] of the Shepherd and we need the shepherd
[46:55] we need him in our defense we need him
[46:59] as for the one amen they will look over
[47:01] us and kill the enemy because we have no
[47:06] defense system outside of the blood of
[47:09] Jesus Christ what are we going to do
[47:12] y'all you think about the world is
[47:16] falling apart look at what's happening
[47:19] there in China do you really think that
[47:23] somehow this germ came from nowhere
[47:26] our prophet called it germ warfare and
[47:30] he said every body that do not have the
[47:36] Holy Ghost will be smitten by this germ
[47:41] warfare look how it's spreading
[47:46] you know people open your eyes China was
[47:49] just at war with itself revolution Amen
[47:54] people rising up against the government
[47:57] the government said we'll fix you
[48:01] y'all might think I'm crazy but this is
[48:04] the way I see it
[48:05] so they unleashed this virus he watched
[48:10] the politicians won't get sick those who
[48:14] are ruling the country they're not gonna
[48:16] get sick you're not gonna hear them
[48:18] dying and here America says oh let me
[48:23] find a vaccine they already got it but
[48:28] they make the people believe that they
[48:31] don't have it because you know what
[48:32] they're doing they're downsizing
[48:36] everybody is downsizing too many go read
[48:40] somewhere that's what's happening they
[48:42] downsizing do you think it's gonna
[48:46] spread here it's already here what
[48:49] America gonna do they're gonna downsize
[48:56] huh look at it something's happening
[48:59] the ocean is downsizing tons of whales
[49:04] tons of of seals and purposes all
[49:08] official dying what's going on this is
[49:12] the end time this is what's supposed to
[49:16] happen today is supposed to not only
[49:19] strike the land but also the sea and
[49:23] most of these things are being caused by
[49:25] who man we are the ones that's causing
[49:29] it and then they talk about that that
[49:32] the polar caps is melting why all of the
[49:36] pollution that's in the air it is a law
[49:39] of nature to clean it up we are causing
[49:44] these things look at us folks these are
[49:47] all Brotherhood's what are you saying
[49:49] look at us we we even in our country
[49:51] supposed to be that shouldn't be the
[49:53] most healthiest people in the world but
[49:55] we'll never be the healthiest because
[49:58] most of our food is hybrid when hybrid
[50:01] food is death ain't no life in it apples
[50:05] look like an apple but they're not
[50:07] tastes like an apple but it's not as
[50:09] long as it's hybrid there's no life in
[50:11] it it's not giving you anything but pulp
[50:14] bulk however you want to say it that's
[50:18] the reason why we have to take vitamins
[50:21] cuz what we need is not in the fruit
[50:24] it's not in the vegetables is in these
[50:28] capsules and then a lot of that died out
[50:31] before it gets to you now I'm trying to
[50:35] speak truth tonight you go fight for
[50:38] what you want are you gonna die in the
[50:40] battle you
[50:43] won't heaven you gotta fight forward you
[50:46] ain't gonna just be be given to you on a
[50:49] horse are batteries no you gotta fight
[50:54] for it
[50:56] you got to be determined you know how
[50:58] you fight you fight by yielding to the
[51:03] word you fight by surrendering to the
[51:08] word is that right what people don't
[51:10] understand amen Hitler conquered Germany
[51:14] before he conquered any other place and
[51:17] before God can conquer in your life
[51:19] he must conquer you first are you
[51:25] willing to fight only if he can't good
[51:27] until he conquers you huh you saw what
[51:31] do you mean look how great Samson was he
[51:34] gave God all of his gifts he was able to
[51:36] fight the Philistines and kill with a
[51:39] jawbone and pull up gates of Gaza and
[51:42] all kinds of great things but since then
[51:45] gave God his strength and that's what
[51:48] the church is given God strength God
[51:50] don't want your strength God wants your
[51:53] heart and the very day that Samson
[51:57] finally surrendered to God and gave God
[52:00] his heart that's when he became more
[52:03] than a conqueror and when you give God
[52:06] your heart I mean all Lord I give you a
[52:09] portion of a heart you won't go nowhere
[52:11] with that you got to give God your all
[52:14] and it's a fight guess what nothing no
[52:20] one wants to die a cat a dog a horse
[52:27] when death strikes they fight to live is
[52:32] that right and that's what we're doing
[52:35] with the Lord I want to die and shoes
[52:37] God come to kill you you fight him you
[52:40] fight to live this life why because we
[52:44] are afraid we are afraid of the unknown
[52:49] but that's what God wants you to do Cass
[52:52] I see
[52:53] the pub's have perfect love casts out
[52:55] fear
[52:57] you've got to surrender to God or you
[52:59] won't go there you understand me
[53:07] everybody's suffering now in one way or
[53:11] another family members children's mama
[53:17] daddy that that's the Bible you know the
[53:20] route said in the last days husband will
[53:23] be guests against wives children against
[53:26] their parents it's happening you're in
[53:30] the mix and it doesn't mean oh I'm in
[53:33] the message that gonna make a difference
[53:34] no those spirits are here and they're
[53:38] coming to knock on your door right but
[53:41] we must understand there is a world of
[53:44] defense no evil shall come not my
[53:48] dwelling place but if we feel that
[53:51] Scripture
[53:53] what do you mean fear it if we fear that
[53:55] we speak it is not going to come to pass
[53:57] it will not come to pass you've got to
[54:01] have faith in that scripture in order
[54:04] for it to work you love the Lord we
[54:10] don't watch the wrestle against flesh
[54:11] and blood and so when Jesus Christ
[54:14] conquered death hell and the grave she
[54:17] see God is a just God he's a merciful
[54:19] God garden is the throw us into this
[54:22] dimension and said just just just just
[54:24] que sera sera whatever will be will be
[54:26] no sod he had a plan I like the way
[54:30] Einstein say this he said that time is a
[54:36] space or that God gave us he didn't say
[54:41] God but that is given to us so that
[54:44] everything won't happen at the same time
[54:47] see without time time make things happen
[54:50] in intervals and pieces but eternity we
[54:55] don't know what's there God sees
[54:58] everything
[54:59] nothing really evolves with God it's
[55:01] only in time everything evolves
[55:06] but you see with God everything is
[55:08] that's why he says I am I am right and
[55:15] that's why he used the scripture Jesus
[55:17] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[55:19] forever and equate that and it comes
[55:21] back to I am so because there is no time
[55:24] where he is time is is what he allowed
[55:29] to be placed in this dimension so that
[55:32] we can learn of him hallelujah but think
[55:37] about it when we get on the other side
[55:39] we won't have to learn there be no
[55:43] colleges there not being a degrees there
[55:45] are any scarless Scholastic chap
[55:49] scholarships we will know all and we
[55:56] will be known even as we are known will
[55:59] be in what we call a word body which is
[56:02] that body that God gave us before we
[56:04] came here right we have a body Paul says
[56:08] we do Paul sent him this earthly
[56:11] tabernacle be dissolved I have a
[56:13] building which he was working with a
[56:15] body there is a body that when we leave
[56:19] this body we go into that body which is
[56:22] called a word body which God has made
[56:24] eternal everlasting however you want to
[56:28] put it but in this in this dimension let
[56:34] me make it simple it ain't deep anyway
[56:36] but you and I in the mind of God has
[56:41] already gone through this battle but
[56:46] what you mean brother rules because
[56:50] before the twenty-four elders you had 12
[56:56] that I already had past you had 12 and
[56:59] some of them were still living when John
[57:01] wrote the book on the Isle of Patmos and
[57:03] John saw the 24 elders sitting on
[57:07] twenty-four Thrones and John saw what
[57:12] Ezekiel saw he saw the twelve tribes of
[57:17] Israel the elders
[57:20] of that tribe setting on 12 Thrones so
[57:28] God had already full ran because he's
[57:32] not subject to time but he takes that in
[57:36] that's why he says I'm the Alpha and the
[57:38] Omega he takes the end and puts it in
[57:41] time so that we could read it and
[57:43] believe it and have faith that he that
[57:47] begun the good work in us its faithful
[57:50] to complete it you see John said I saw a
[57:54] number that no man can number now if God
[58:00] wanted to give every name he could have
[58:02] done it but there were never been books
[58:05] that would have been able to contain all
[58:08] of those names but he knew that once
[58:12] that word would go out that there would
[58:15] be somebody who would say I know that
[58:19] one of those in that number is me those
[58:22] who overcame by the blood of the Lamb
[58:26] and the word of their testimony you got
[58:29] to understand this is a battle and you
[58:32] and I we fought with him Micah even in
[58:36] the beginning when Lucifer was cast out
[58:40] we stood with Christ you don't remember
[58:43] it but God brought a book of remembrance
[58:48] and he knew that if I could get my seed
[58:51] those who who fought with me in the
[58:55] beginning they would be able to read
[58:57] this book and somehow everything would
[59:00] become familiar they would know that
[59:05] this is where I belong I don't know
[59:09] about everybody else but I know that I
[59:12] feel more at home being a Christian in a
[59:15] sinner something about this book it
[59:20] encouraged me it gives me strength see
[59:24] it somehow it makes a connection with
[59:29] the entire eternal God think about it
[59:33] what was it God knew that in the
[59:37] beginning when he first called Abraham
[59:38] he knew the mountain that he was gonna
[59:41] take Abraham - he knew the sacrifice he
[59:44] was gonna call Abraham the hare because
[59:46] in his mind his son would be sacrificed
[59:51] right
[59:52] and you said what do you mean what do
[59:54] you mean you see see God he he does
[59:57] things he said all of the scripture the
[59:59] Old Testament was given to us for what
[1:00:01] ammonition huh - a mana sure to correct
[1:00:04] us and and to keep us in line
[1:00:08] God didn't have to do that what makes it
[1:00:12] so that you like this word or love this
[1:00:15] word when others hate it explain that to
[1:00:18] me even though you cannot live it you
[1:00:23] still love it why this is a warfare and
[1:00:32] what I'm working with tonight is what
[1:00:34] your mind I'm working with your mind
[1:00:38] tonight because I want you to consider
[1:00:40] it meant what we've been doing for the
[1:00:43] last 24 hours or the last week or last
[1:00:46] month or the last year
[1:00:48] have we been preparing and have we set
[1:00:52] our goals and we see have we have we
[1:00:57] kept our eyes on Jesus what are we doing
[1:01:00] what are we doing understand you won't
[1:01:04] get a second chance
[1:01:05] this is not how could I say like this if
[1:01:09] there is a second chance this is it at
[1:01:13] the bit this is that right that's what
[1:01:16] Hebrews says Hebrew says oh if you come
[1:01:20] into the knowledge of the truth and you
[1:01:22] turn from it there remains no more
[1:01:26] sacrifice for sin for you it doesn't
[1:01:30] mean you became a real believer that's
[1:01:32] not even what they say it's saying that
[1:01:35] even if you came up to the borderline
[1:01:37] you saw God moved and you knew that was
[1:01:40] God moving and you turned around says
[1:01:42] I'm not I don't want that willfully
[1:01:45] walking away from it
[1:01:47] there's no coming back see that's Hebrew
[1:01:53] six but the greatest thing that is a
[1:01:56] curse to us we fear fear and fear is the
[1:02:05] opposite of faith like faith can move
[1:02:09] mountains faith and fear can put you at
[1:02:15] all
[1:02:16] oh-hoh it's just the opposite
[1:02:20] fear takes you to hell faith can take
[1:02:23] you to heaven hallelujah perilous times
[1:02:30] shall come
[1:02:32] means to be lovers of their own selves
[1:02:35] and covetous and boast and proud and
[1:02:37] blasphemous now let me tell you this
[1:02:40] Paul was not writing this to the world
[1:02:43] Paul wrote this to the church God
[1:02:48] brothers I've heard that before but let
[1:02:49] me ask you something lovers of
[1:02:55] themselves we all find ourselves
[1:02:58] sometime guilty we love ourselves more
[1:03:03] than we love God how do you know that
[1:03:06] because we do our will instead of his
[1:03:09] will hmm covetous Oh and and surely we
[1:03:22] none of us have that problem with
[1:03:23] boasting sometime do we do it priority
[1:03:29] for hallelujah disobedient to parents
[1:03:32] unthankful and y'all know that this is
[1:03:36] the right age you can't even get
[1:03:38] children to listen to their parents
[1:03:40] children rule their parents in the
[1:03:43] grocery store in the Bay on the street
[1:03:46] in the restaurants back in my day we
[1:03:49] brought the ruler so they would know who
[1:03:52] the ruler world and now they call that
[1:03:56] they call that that were they call that
[1:03:58] now where they abuse
[1:04:00] child abuse now what we going to do
[1:04:04] about a parent abuse because they abuses
[1:04:07] us oh it's the truth see in my day you
[1:04:12] can't say this now but my mom would say
[1:04:15] I brought you in and I'll definitely
[1:04:18] take you out and they meant it Hey
[1:04:25] no child would ever get up in a parent
[1:04:27] face yeah yeah not even a word back and
[1:04:34] my mother was a true Christian but she
[1:04:37] had a aim that wouldn't miss and if she
[1:04:42] couldn't reach you like this whatever
[1:04:45] she had next tour she now y'all call
[1:04:50] that abuse now but I tell you what it
[1:04:52] kept us out of jail huh it kept us out
[1:04:56] of jail it learned it made us know how
[1:04:59] to respect our elders somebody help me
[1:05:03] is the truth we have watered it down why
[1:05:07] because we allowed liberals we allowed
[1:05:09] people that that just don't believe the
[1:05:11] Bible at all to be in our politics and
[1:05:16] they changed our world
[1:05:17] come on summarize the truth but it had
[1:05:20] to happen this is the darkest of all age
[1:05:24] why am I talking like this because a
[1:05:27] many of us are being influenced by the
[1:05:29] darkness and don't even realize it the
[1:05:32] Bible said that God would have us hot or
[1:05:34] cold
[1:05:35] I mean if us is hot in here tonight huh
[1:05:39] he said lukewarm us feel you but we're
[1:05:42] not afraid to be spewed what is it what
[1:05:46] is it that we're not afraid to be spewed
[1:05:51] something wrong with the picture we are
[1:05:54] warfare in the same time Satan is
[1:05:57] cooling us little by little he's a he's
[1:06:00] a creeper
[1:06:01] he's a slithery he slowly moves by the
[1:06:08] time he wraps you around you don't even
[1:06:10] know your rap till you feel the squeeze
[1:06:12] and
[1:06:13] you feel the squeeze is too late to get
[1:06:14] free may God help us why are you
[1:06:20] preaching like this because I have a
[1:06:22] desire ain't meant to see perfection
[1:06:26] that doesn't mean but in everybody that
[1:06:30] say they believe this message because
[1:06:31] this message is the only word that can
[1:06:34] take you there it is the only entrance
[1:06:38] but if we neglect to walk in it
[1:06:43] Christians don't know they gotta have
[1:06:44] patience and faith and godliness and
[1:06:47] temperance a lot of them don't know that
[1:06:49] they say well you know I'm saved by
[1:06:51] grace you are but grace takes you up
[1:06:55] Jacob's Ladder you've got to climb it
[1:06:59] whether you like it or not if you're
[1:07:01] gonna make heaven you got to climb
[1:07:03] Jacob's Ladder if I could say it like
[1:07:06] that you got to go higher that's why
[1:07:09] Paul said leaving the principles of God
[1:07:11] the doctrine who I know I'm saying cuz
[1:07:14] I've been baptized many people who've
[1:07:16] been baptized aren't saved didn't make
[1:07:19] it to heaven all the praise God I
[1:07:21] shouted I danced I spoke in tongues
[1:07:24] Paul said that's nonsense you know
[1:07:27] better now you understand the election
[1:07:30] you understand the call hallelujah
[1:07:33] Devils can do all of that but I've
[1:07:36] called you to a higher calling you got
[1:07:39] to live like Christ walk like Christ
[1:07:42] talk like Christ everything must be him
[1:07:45] you must become like Paul said I don't
[1:07:49] only live but it's Christ in us and it
[1:07:55] is a journey it doesn't happen overnight
[1:07:59] a child doesn't grow from a baby to a
[1:08:02] grown up in one day it's a process a lot
[1:08:06] of Falls a lot of getting up
[1:08:10] hallelujah scraping the knees scraping
[1:08:12] the elbow however you want to look at it
[1:08:15] but that's the way it is you see what
[1:08:19] brother Brooks what are you saying
[1:08:20] I'm saying we see the time
[1:08:24] let's go say we not we don't have to
[1:08:26] tell you of the times this time won't
[1:08:28] take you this time and season won't take
[1:08:30] you like a thief in the night you can
[1:08:32] see it the word has been brought to you
[1:08:34] it's been brought to us think about it I
[1:08:38] can't stand the fact that there's so
[1:08:40] many people even among ourselves we're
[1:08:43] jumping with shouting we can quote the
[1:08:45] problem we can quote the word we can
[1:08:47] quote this that in the other we can tell
[1:08:48] you about whatever happen on sunset
[1:08:50] mountain it leaves nothing except Christ
[1:08:54] being you yeah Jesus got to live there
[1:08:58] you are the temple of God and if God in
[1:09:03] the temple who's in there
[1:09:05] somebody somebody's in the temple but
[1:09:11] this temple this body was made for God
[1:09:15] not for subscribe demons look what he
[1:09:21] says if the message the way to have
[1:09:24] fellowship the perfect God says that's
[1:09:29] the trouble with man tonight that's what
[1:09:32] the trouble with people tonight you're
[1:09:34] scared that's the biggest curse there is
[1:09:39] on the Full Gospel people or any other
[1:09:42] people it's because they are afraid God
[1:09:46] has made the provision but you're afraid
[1:09:49] to take his word for it if you wasn't
[1:09:52] afraid tonight why you wouldn't you
[1:09:55] would take your healing by faith and
[1:09:57] know that God promised it and the things
[1:10:00] would just go plum away from you afraid
[1:10:03] scared I've noticed it and that's the
[1:10:06] reason I'm such a believer in healing I
[1:10:09] know that if you can get away from that
[1:10:11] scare and get love in its place
[1:10:14] something's going to happen
[1:10:16] I talked with sister Karen who had a bad
[1:10:22] operation well the operation anyway had
[1:10:25] left her afflicted and in one of her
[1:10:28] hands she she can't even operate as of
[1:10:31] yet and she had to learn how to walk all
[1:10:34] over again and everything it took
[1:10:35] everybody by surprise
[1:10:38] but I talked with her today she called
[1:10:40] me to get sisters Angie's number and I
[1:10:43] just started talking to her and she said
[1:10:45] brother Brooks she said I know the way I
[1:10:49] look
[1:10:49] bothers some people she said but it
[1:10:53] doesn't bother me
[1:10:55] she says cuz I glorify God every every
[1:10:59] day all the day whenever I glory I
[1:11:01] praise God she said because I realized
[1:11:04] that this was given to me by God to
[1:11:07] perfect me how many people look at it
[1:11:12] like that we'll look I saw Lois me
[1:11:17] Paulsen Desert thorn in my flesh I
[1:11:19] sought the Lord thrice three times and
[1:11:22] the only answer I could get from God was
[1:11:24] my grace is sufficient he kept all from
[1:11:29] being puffed up because God hates pride
[1:11:34] about said pride comes before a fall
[1:11:37] that's how come Lucifer fell he was
[1:11:39] flawed pride you understand me I know
[1:11:45] that if you can get away from scared and
[1:11:48] get love in this place it's the truth
[1:11:50] don't you know you can conquer almost I
[1:11:52] mean let's put this way if you're not
[1:11:54] afraid of a sickness you can conquer it
[1:11:59] because Satan used fear and fear is
[1:12:02] torment and fear is a lack of faith and
[1:12:05] if he can get you to fear he's already
[1:12:08] conquered you period I walked the waters
[1:12:12] on faith the moment he feared he's
[1:12:15] saying see if fear that conquers you
[1:12:20] what are you afraid if you're truly a
[1:12:23] Christian you should never be afraid to
[1:12:25] die but Satan said if you don't get this
[1:12:28] done
[1:12:28] you gonna die and if you don't have this
[1:12:31] operation you're gonna die hello I'm
[1:12:34] gonna die after the operation - you're
[1:12:37] gonna die so what difference does it
[1:12:40] make whether I die before I after am I
[1:12:44] making sense
[1:12:46] Weehoo time but people say well I just
[1:12:49] don't want to die right now
[1:12:51] that's because you don't have a
[1:12:53] revelation of heaven you don't have a
[1:12:55] revelation of the other the world a calm
[1:12:58] hallelujah
[1:12:59] somehow Paul revelation was different
[1:13:02] from there Paul said I desire to go I
[1:13:04] want to go but he won't let me go
[1:13:07] because I still got work I must do for
[1:13:09] y'all so I might as well work propulse
[1:13:15] it I want to leave here
[1:13:17] but you talking about
[1:13:19] ooh mercy Lord see we get it all mixed
[1:13:23] up like like you heard the people say
[1:13:25] well you know you know everybody want to
[1:13:28] go to heaven but they don't want to die
[1:13:30] to get there hey but it's true is that
[1:13:37] right the only itay the truth you you
[1:13:43] know you see these people can't Holly
[1:13:47] make it and want to hold on no if real
[1:13:50] Christians no no no no Lord win-win here
[1:13:56] how long Lord this is y'all think you're
[1:14:07] gonna wake up in the morning with the
[1:14:08] old Lord sweeping through the city it's
[1:14:10] gonna be so peaceful today the birds are
[1:14:11] singing Hallelujah huh and you gotta
[1:14:17] understand to think about it I've been
[1:14:20] looking at those creatures on YouTube
[1:14:23] you know animals you know so far reason
[1:14:26] you know how they haven't where we're
[1:14:28] hunting animals hunting each other

[1:15:18] eaten alive yes and you know what the
[1:15:24] bad thing about it you hardly ever get
[1:15:26] any help the other animals look at you
[1:15:31] like you know all of them they know they
[1:15:42] can whip that lion but they just go but
[1:15:48] my party is that's a horrible way to die
[1:15:52] but all of that was caused because of
[1:15:57] all that right fear
[1:16:04] you see those those animals fighting for
[1:16:07] their lives
[1:16:08] there's only two dissing but at some
[1:16:12] point in time they know that that's
[1:16:16] that's the last day you know there's
[1:16:21] only two falco T's that governs a human
[1:16:24] and one of them is faith which brings
[1:16:27] result in the other one is fear which
[1:16:30] has no value in it all faith is of God
[1:16:33] faith is fear is of the devil fear makes
[1:16:38] you weary anybody weary
[1:16:41] you know used to worry and what you
[1:16:43] worried about that's not of God it's not
[1:16:48] of God even in the Bobbsey we don't
[1:16:51] understand about they don't even take no
[1:16:52] thought for tomorrow we just don't take
[1:16:55] a thought for tomorrow we go months
[1:16:57] ahead of us right
[1:17:00] don't even take no thought and we don't
[1:17:03] even think about we are weary and we're
[1:17:05] breaking the promises of God and faith
[1:17:08] is the only thing that's gonna move your
[1:17:11] situation and the devil got you worried
[1:17:13] and the sad thing about it is there are
[1:17:17] times you're worrying and you
[1:17:18] don't even know it why because somewhere
[1:17:22] your prayer life has been broken you
[1:17:25] stay in prayer consecrated to god you'll
[1:17:28] never worry let me move on
[1:17:32] you saw all brothers who say let me tell
[1:17:34] you even some of the greatest men of God
[1:17:36] has been placed in a place where they
[1:17:38] didn't know what to do
[1:17:39] worried when God has done so many great
[1:17:42] things is that right look at Moses a
[1:17:44] prophet of God he's crying out to the
[1:17:47] Lord Lord that mercy and God said why
[1:17:50] are you crying to me and often time
[1:17:52] that's what God is thinking why are you
[1:17:54] crying unto me speak it go forward
[1:17:58] believe that I'm with you I've given you
[1:18:01] the authority you say you got the Holy
[1:18:02] Ghost you say God is in you make your
[1:18:06] mountains move hey my wife and I've been
[1:18:13] praying about a situation I'm not ready
[1:18:14] to see any what it is yet but today I
[1:18:18] got a letter
[1:18:19] my wife was screaming I'm like Oh what
[1:18:23] hurts my ear she got a pitch she was so
[1:18:28] happy she probably my husband is
[1:18:35] estranged me cuz why she's getting happy
[1:18:40] I'm like I was in pain but nevertheless
[1:18:44] I felt what she was feeling but I had my
[1:18:47] Julie early but you know it was a thing
[1:18:51] that looked impossible it looked like it
[1:18:55] was going to be impossible and out of
[1:18:57] nowhere god fixed it so don't you ever
[1:19:04] think that the devil got you in a place
[1:19:05] where you can't get out the Bible says
[1:19:08] that the Lord will always make a way of
[1:19:10] escape that's what I used to cry our God
[1:19:13] there's gotta be a way there must be a
[1:19:16] way and I didn't have to do nothing God
[1:19:19] fixed it hallelujah my faith is of God
[1:19:25] fears of the devil fear makes you weary
[1:19:28] fear makes you wonder and if I was going
[1:19:31] to die in the more
[1:19:32] what good would it do me to get all
[1:19:34] stood up about it well if I was going to
[1:19:37] be electrocuted in the morning and my
[1:19:39] life had to end tomorrow morning what
[1:19:41] good would that do for me to worry about
[1:19:44] it
[1:19:45] worried what good will it do you to
[1:19:49] worry now what were we gonna do for you
[1:19:53] when you're dying now if you save and
[1:19:56] you're Christian there's no place to
[1:19:58] worry hmm how many y'all believe that so
[1:20:10] what we gonna get that I'm finna close
[1:20:12] here now because there's a place of
[1:20:14] hiding there's no hiding in this place
[1:20:17] there's no continuing City everything
[1:20:20] moves everything changes even since I've
[1:20:22] been in in Ankeny my wife and I have
[1:20:24] seen major changing I just learned
[1:20:26] they're building another elementary
[1:20:29] school up there and it's just growing
[1:20:32] and growing nothing stays the same I was
[1:20:36] telling my wife tower somebody the other
[1:20:38] day after Bob my little place would be
[1:20:40] looked at looked upon there's two ghetto
[1:20:44] cuz everybody else was getting so big
[1:20:46] and fancy that's the truth but there's a
[1:20:54] time when we we had a little
[1:20:57] something-something but now everything
[1:21:01] is changing that's the way it works
[1:21:05] nothing stays the same here hallelujah
[1:21:10] places where I used to live in South
[1:21:12] Carolina are no longer there from my
[1:21:16] childhood
[1:21:17] everything's gone all the way up to
[1:21:19] about duck even places where we used to
[1:21:21] live they're no longer there been
[1:21:23] bulldoze with over ten other projects as
[1:21:25] something else has been built upon
[1:21:28] you're not gonna stay the same and I'm
[1:21:32] gonna tell you how y'all looking at me I
[1:21:33] am old to some of y'all but give God
[1:21:36] give give time a chance you're coming
[1:21:42] you better enjoy
[1:21:44] youth like take photo Timothy don't let
[1:21:47] nobody despise you you see Paul knew
[1:21:49] what he was talking about age comes and
[1:21:53] pain come with age oh it's the truth and
[1:21:57] it's all because this is a place of
[1:22:00] death
[1:22:01] nothing about this place is life
[1:22:03] everything is death
[1:22:05] everything's died whatever lives die but
[1:22:10] there is a place where no place there's
[1:22:12] a place where you never die see there's
[1:22:15] always a positive and a negative
[1:22:18] hallelujah you know even the highest I
[1:22:22] knew about relativity I love that that
[1:22:25] you can be in two places at one time
[1:22:30] heaven and earth at the same time the
[1:22:33] Bible says it we're now sitting in
[1:22:35] heavenly places in Christ Jesus right
[1:22:39] now yet was sitting in this place we
[1:22:44] have representation hallelujah what do
[1:22:48] you mean just like that body was falling
[1:22:50] for you in the natural and all of a
[1:22:52] sudden the spirit came into it is that
[1:22:55] no I didn't yes it did because when your
[1:22:58] heart was beating it was because of the
[1:23:00] life that was in your mama hey she was
[1:23:07] the one that was supplying you with
[1:23:09] oxygen hmm but when that neighbor cord
[1:23:16] is cut you own your own that's why some
[1:23:21] babies just die some live but what we
[1:23:29] gonna do you got a fight you got a fight
[1:23:35] you got a fight you got a fight to come
[1:23:37] into this world and you got a fight to
[1:23:39] go out right Ostra truth there said even
[1:23:44] a little chicken got a fight to get out
[1:23:46] of the shell you can't even help it
[1:23:50] while this fighting is building his
[1:23:53] lungs and everything else up the heart
[1:23:55] is getting stronger
[1:23:57] so if you if used to break that shelf
[1:23:59] for that little chickadee it will die
[1:24:01] because it wouldn't have the strength to
[1:24:04] breathe God can't help you no more than
[1:24:08] he's already helped you but you gotta
[1:24:11] fight to live and you gotta live to die
[1:24:16] you understand what I'm saying amen
[1:24:19] because there is a place we call it the
[1:24:23] Holies of Holies
[1:24:24] we call it the Holies of Holies
[1:24:26] represents Christ the Bible said that
[1:24:28] city won't need a light because the lamb
[1:24:31] is the light the lamb is the temple
[1:24:34] hallelujah in order for you to get into
[1:24:37] that temple in all of you to get into
[1:24:40] that Christ in order to get into that
[1:24:42] party you must be born again
[1:24:44] by one spirit and I tell you the truth
[1:24:48] what gets me is because so many of us
[1:24:52] think we got it but what is your life
[1:24:57] display that Beethoven is in the inside
[1:25:02] of you it's going to play it will
[1:25:07] compose everything about you will become
[1:25:10] Beethoven and if Jesus Christ is on the
[1:25:13] inside everything about you will become
[1:25:16] Jesus Christ there is no way that you
[1:25:19] can stay and says well oh wait you I've
[1:25:23] been this way for five years you better
[1:25:26] find out why you don't wait for five
[1:25:27] years have you really had a true birth
[1:25:30] house have you got a real birth what's
[1:25:33] in you will manifest itself as it grows
[1:25:36] but if there's no real birth you're just
[1:25:39] imitating Christianity manufacturing it
[1:25:44] it's got to be a life in you to change
[1:25:47] you because you can't change yourself
[1:25:50] it's Christ being formed in you that
[1:25:54] makes the difference that's what brings
[1:25:56] you to heaven Christ must be in you to
[1:25:58] get there let me hurry up I'm almost
[1:26:02] done so we can say that this is holy and
[1:26:06] that is holy there's only one thing holy
[1:26:09] and that's Jesus Christ
[1:26:10] the son of the Living God who has been
[1:26:12] laid perfect and our requirement is to
[1:26:15] be perfect now how we're going to be the
[1:26:18] viet try it yourself I'd hate to try to
[1:26:21] get to heaven on the merits on the
[1:26:24] mayors of I was born five minutes ago
[1:26:27] and I'm going out of the world right now
[1:26:29] I'd be lost if I never had even thought
[1:26:32] in my life if I never spoke a bad word
[1:26:35] in my life if I never looked at anything
[1:26:37] evil ever thought anything evil or
[1:26:39] nothing how just as just as ranked and
[1:26:43] it's black as its money walls of Hell
[1:26:45] I'm a sinner I could come through life
[1:26:48] and stay locked up in a room like some
[1:26:51] of the Carmelites sisters or something
[1:26:53] and never see the world stay in there
[1:26:56] and pray all my life do good born a
[1:27:00] multi-millionaire and give to the poor
[1:27:02] everything I got and I'm still a sinner
[1:27:05] and we'll go to hell I might join the
[1:27:09] Lutheran Church Baptist Presbyterian you
[1:27:12] know when I'm old the cradle roll and
[1:27:15] live faithful to that church until a
[1:27:17] hundred years in my life it took and no
[1:27:22] man could point their finger at me and
[1:27:24] say he ever even had a as much as a bad
[1:27:27] thought I go to hell just as sure as I'm
[1:27:30] standing I'm a sinner that's correct
[1:27:35] I have nothing there's no way at all I
[1:27:38] could find any price to be paid God
[1:27:42] required death and I give my long life
[1:27:45] if I give my life then now can I repent
[1:27:48] because you see the dead has to has got
[1:27:51] to be paid first
[1:27:52] God was the only one who could lay his
[1:27:55] life down and take it up again
[1:27:58] so he could become sin and lay his life
[1:28:01] upon a life down and pick it up and call
[1:28:05] it justice and the debt is paid there
[1:28:09] you are you see you and I must
[1:28:11] understand and let me say like this
[1:28:13] that's why Christ is so important that's
[1:28:15] why Jesus Christ is are so important
[1:28:16] that's why having the Holy Ghost is so
[1:28:18] important now you've got to see changes
[1:28:21] in you not your own
[1:28:24] that's what Paul says it ain't about
[1:28:26] handle not taste not touch not that
[1:28:29] ain't here you got so many people who
[1:28:31] could practice being moral and
[1:28:34] practicing is not it there's got to be
[1:28:36] something that makes you hate doing evil
[1:28:40] coming from the inside out right it
[1:28:44] ain't you is him in you living through
[1:28:46] you step by step right taking you
[1:28:50] through this journey and as you walk
[1:28:52] this journey you're getting more mature
[1:28:54] things that once amuse you
[1:28:57] no longer amuse you things that once
[1:29:00] attracted you you know pretty women are
[1:29:02] handsome men look like junk to you now
[1:29:05] because of who they are versus who you
[1:29:09] are
[1:29:09] you understand me it's something that
[1:29:12] changes you you don't change it it
[1:29:14] changes you that's how you know you got
[1:29:16] something like that person that those
[1:29:21] Saint says yeah I'm not what I used to
[1:29:25] be it not what I want to be but thank
[1:29:27] God I'm not what I ought to be y'all
[1:29:29] know I go I always mess it up but anyhow
[1:29:32] I'm not the same person I used to be and
[1:29:36] I can see the changes I love the changes
[1:29:39] and as far as i concerned I'm concerned
[1:29:43] if they don't come quick enough but I
[1:29:47] thank God for what he's given me but God
[1:29:52] who is rich in mercy I'm closing with
[1:29:54] this for his great love wherewith he
[1:29:59] loved us even when we were dead and sin
[1:30:02] have quickened us together with Christ
[1:30:04] by grace ye are saved that's what you
[1:30:08] must know it is grace it you can't do it
[1:30:12] but he's the one that can and you have
[1:30:15] to say Lord I can't do it but I need you
[1:30:18] to do it for me that's when God makes
[1:30:21] the changes inside you understand me
[1:30:24] when you say Lord I can't do it but I
[1:30:26] want to do right that's how God has
[1:30:30] brought me a mighty long way you know
[1:30:32] how because I never like to win you know
[1:30:35] if I liked a certain sin
[1:30:38] I would tell it I like it that's why I
[1:30:40] keep doing it I hate it I hate it for
[1:30:44] the fact that that that that that you
[1:30:46] hate it I know it's wrong but I need to
[1:30:50] be delivered from it in order to please
[1:30:52] you lord help me deliver me from this
[1:30:56] that's how I've gotten my deliverance
[1:30:58] your hi don't go before God you know I
[1:31:00] just hate it Lord and you and then you
[1:31:03] say well if you hate it while you keep
[1:31:04] doing it ain't nobody gonna keep
[1:31:07] smashing my finger huh let me hear him
[1:31:12] put time with the hammer I guarantee you
[1:31:14] ain't gonna put it down there second
[1:31:15] time ah because of the pain you hate it
[1:31:19] now
[1:31:20] something wrong with you if you got a
[1:31:23] hammer and you cause me in that thing
[1:31:26] it makes no sense right so when there's
[1:31:30] something in your life whether it's
[1:31:32] temper lost and that that has so many
[1:31:38] layers to it uh no matter what it is you
[1:31:44] know what I've been struggling in and I
[1:31:45] say struggling I've been asking God to
[1:31:47] kill my will because I found out that
[1:31:51] that little will of mine creeps in and
[1:31:55] in it's so subtle I don't even know it's
[1:31:58] my will until it takes his position then
[1:32:03] I realize I've done something or said
[1:32:05] something that wasn't appropriate for
[1:32:07] Christians to say or do you understand
[1:32:10] me so your will can get in your way you
[1:32:17] say what do you mean somebody says hey
[1:32:19] bring me a cup of water are you thinking
[1:32:25] you know he ain't gonna hurt you to get
[1:32:32] a cup of water
[1:32:33] I think Mountain um one thing about my
[1:32:37] wife my wife is good but if I ask him
[1:32:40] for something she gonna do it yeah
[1:32:43] that's one thing for sure now I don't
[1:32:44] know what goes on in our head but you
[1:32:48] normally should get the victory
[1:32:50] she's never telling she never told me to
[1:32:52] get your old water in four to two years
[1:32:55] never she's never told me go fix your
[1:32:59] own food never know but but to say all
[1:33:04] of these things you know you think about
[1:33:07] all of the sacrifices and if we could
[1:33:10] just surrender you know the truth of the
[1:33:12] matter is when somebody asked you to do
[1:33:14] something you don't always have to feel
[1:33:16] like doing it at the moment but think
[1:33:19] about it and repair right because that's
[1:33:23] the scripture remember when the when the
[1:33:25] father said son go do this do this
[1:33:27] soldier do this he said oh I'll do it
[1:33:30] I'm gonna do it I'm gonna do it and he
[1:33:31] never went but the other one said
[1:33:33] services I'm not going to do it and then
[1:33:35] he repented and he went and did it
[1:33:38] and Jesus said which one of these did
[1:33:40] the will of the father the one who
[1:33:42] repented see so sometimes you got to
[1:33:45] push that man out of the way I said I'm
[1:33:47] gonna do it if you don't like it I'm
[1:33:49] gonna do it anyway to the glory of God
[1:33:51] right that's like the Nakhla in
[1:33:56] portunity I'm already Ameritrade close
[1:33:58] your friend knocking on your door at
[1:34:00] night and you he knows he can only he's
[1:34:02] the only one they go knock on your door
[1:34:03] at night and get an answer it's the
[1:34:06] truth especially when I was in the world
[1:34:08] a friend could come by two o'clock three
[1:34:11] o'clock in the morning and you'll get up
[1:34:19] and you get up all fresh like what you
[1:34:21] own anyway when it comes to the grace of
[1:34:26] God you and I must understand in order
[1:34:29] to set in heavenly places you can't be
[1:34:31] in hell you got to be in heaven
[1:34:36] you understand I'm closing on this
[1:34:38] because I won't you understand don't you
[1:34:40] everything don't you relax this is not
[1:34:42] the time to relax this is not the time
[1:34:44] there's a oh well case or without God is
[1:34:46] if he's gonna do it he's gonna do it
[1:34:48] well if it's election he'll do it if it
[1:34:50] if I'm justified he'll do it you
[1:34:52] understand me if it's election yeah I
[1:34:54] get there that's the wrong attitude
[1:34:57] you'll never get anywhere like that yes
[1:35:00] I'm elected and I want to see what the
[1:35:03] election is doing in this season and
[1:35:06] whatever they doing that's what I want
[1:35:08] to do give me the grace a nod meaning to
[1:35:11] be what you're doing in this day cuz the
[1:35:14] move is on the bride she's not dead
[1:35:18] whether we believe it or not they're
[1:35:20] miracles and things that are happening
[1:35:21] now but what's happening most of all is
[1:35:25] that God is shaping you up for a greater
[1:35:28] battle halle-loo that's why everything
[1:35:32] is topsy-turvy that's why things are
[1:35:34] knocking and knocking you and hitting
[1:35:36] you all kinds of places and everywhere
[1:35:38] because God is training you for the
[1:35:41] coming storm if you can't take it now
[1:35:45] what you going to take what you're going
[1:35:47] to do when they start boycotting and
[1:35:49] shutting the doors and you can't come to
[1:35:51] this place or somewhere else and you got
[1:35:54] to take the mark and you got to do this
[1:35:56] and you got to do it what you gonna do
[1:35:57] what you gonna do when when you're
[1:36:00] separated from your friend and you find
[1:36:02] out your friends are gonna betray you
[1:36:03] anyway what you gonna do it's happening
[1:36:08] on a low scale now what's going to
[1:36:10] happen when the real pressure come see
[1:36:13] i'ma tell you one thing the devil Emma
[1:36:15] clothes they're one thing the devil said
[1:36:17] to turn to God say you know I can tell
[1:36:21] you whether job is really a believer or
[1:36:23] not so you don't brag on him and you
[1:36:26] don't put a hedge around him you protect
[1:36:29] the job you gave him millions
[1:36:31] you gave him flocks and cattle and
[1:36:33] children and everything everything Joe
[1:36:35] asked for you gave him I'll tell you
[1:36:37] what I don't know how to get him I can
[1:36:39] get him just like I get every man let me
[1:36:41] touch his flesh and that devil just
[1:36:48] didn't touch how many all we ever had a
[1:36:51] boil you know what a boil who you don't
[1:36:56] ever want to know one you might don't
[1:36:58] you go look it up it's alright to see it
[1:37:00] from that angle but when you got a boil
[1:37:03] it's an infection that comes and it gets
[1:37:06] like a knot and it grows and as it grows
[1:37:10] the pain grows right a lot of times they
[1:37:13] have to surgically open it up and move
[1:37:15] it
[1:37:16] my wife will tell you
[1:37:17] I had three of them one time don't even
[1:37:20] know where it came from had one under my
[1:37:23] arm one on my side I forgot where the
[1:37:25] other one work went all the way out to
[1:37:28] UM Arizona looking for some herbs to
[1:37:31] kill it and this lady gave me some mud I
[1:37:34] put that mud on there I thought I was
[1:37:36] doing it was actually healing it but it
[1:37:41] was drawing it you know slowly anyway I
[1:37:44] took the mud off I couldn't take the
[1:37:46] pain and I was down there in in in in
[1:37:50] South Carolina preaching at brother
[1:37:51] Simmons and I'm in pain in his left side
[1:37:55] and while I was preaching haha Holy
[1:37:59] Ghost came and I'm telling you the Holy
[1:38:02] Ghost broke that thing Wow
[1:38:04] just messed my shirt up but that was the
[1:38:06] best feeling I ever had in my y'all yeah
[1:38:10] it was demons
[1:38:11] it was demon power you show what you
[1:38:12] taught my brother God is my witness I
[1:38:14] was in so much pain I would take a razor
[1:38:17] blade and slice it and by the time I
[1:38:19] finish slicing it that thing closed back
[1:38:21] up and nothing would come out Devils and
[1:38:28] the Bible said joke had boils from the
[1:38:31] top of his head you talking about pain
[1:38:35] you're talking about miserable and he
[1:38:39] never cursed God what we get an accident
[1:38:46] have little problems at all over health
[1:38:47] and we say why me Lord that's my brother
[1:38:50] let me say God sometimes feel like
[1:38:52] kicking us around I know it why not we
[1:38:58] spoiled we got it too good and then the
[1:39:02] least no trial come we almost feel like
[1:39:05] God has rejected us y'all love the Lord
[1:39:09] you gonna find that's what Paul said be
[1:39:13] a good soldier fight like a good soldier
[1:39:15] don't let your joy window keep your joy
[1:39:20] because that's where your strength is
[1:39:22] you took my old brother lose it you want
[1:39:25] to grow you want to grow
[1:39:26] don't you understand you ever heard of
[1:39:28] growing pain I'm trying to quit I'm
[1:39:30] talking to somebody
[1:39:32] because you gotta realize you're gonna
[1:39:34] suffer if I said if you suffer with me
[1:39:37] your rain just don't let your suffering
[1:39:41] be because I'm evil doing but when you
[1:39:43] suffer for the name of Jesus Christ God
[1:39:48] has a great reward with for you this is
[1:39:51] the age of warfare I know it's right
[1:39:53] the thought God gave me I know it's
[1:39:55] right the pleading that God has put in
[1:39:58] my spirit toward the Christians and
[1:40:00] myself is right you only get one chance
[1:40:04] you die without the blood of Jesus
[1:40:06] Christ there's no time no no but to
[1:40:09] rewind and Lord let me come again in
[1:40:12] some kind of you know reincarnation
[1:40:13] though ain't nothing like that this is
[1:40:16] it and I think we've taken things too
[1:40:20] lightly you know Harley praying Holly
[1:40:23] reading the studying you know those kind
[1:40:25] of things it's just foolishness when you
[1:40:27] know that that you're not getting a
[1:40:29] second chance it's like you know we you
[1:40:32] know coming to the end of the year you
[1:40:33] know and you doesn't been slothful
[1:40:35] throughout the year and you're in your
[1:40:36] high school and you know it's all of a
[1:40:39] sudden you you feel like you may want to
[1:40:41] make a eighty
[1:40:42] ego get no egg not have you been making
[1:40:47] C's and DS barely making it even if you
[1:40:51] made an a on the final exam when they
[1:40:53] ever get out hey you're not gonna get no
[1:40:56] egg you get an A if you maintain an a
[1:41:00] right let's not come down to the end of
[1:41:04] the road and you said what brother
[1:41:06] Brooks our God God help me I want to
[1:41:08] hear you say well done we're done about
[1:41:10] what brother Bose what what did you do
[1:41:12] well done about what what did you do to
[1:41:16] say we're children you know what I'm
[1:41:20] saying it's simple but it's true how can
[1:41:23] you want God to say well done when you
[1:41:24] ain't you didn't do nothing huh
[1:41:30] think about it what I'm trying to say to
[1:41:32] you tonight
[1:41:33] this little church we don't have many
[1:41:35] but if we could all individually get in
[1:41:37] our hearts and our mind that we're gonna
[1:41:40] please God and make him happy with us
[1:41:43] let God be
[1:41:45] number one and we could get that in our
[1:41:48] hearts and our mind we could we could
[1:41:50] tear the city apart because they'll see
[1:41:54] Jesus Christ real they're seeing through
[1:41:58] your lives they'll see a people
[1:42:01] committed you know and and I only used
[1:42:04] sister Karen because you know what she
[1:42:06] amazes me she go to the hospital they
[1:42:09] know God by the time she finished her
[1:42:12] doctors everybody knows Jesus they think
[1:42:15] she's crazy just the other day she was
[1:42:19] having problems in her house and the
[1:42:21] Lord told him prayer says you got moan
[1:42:23] told exactly where the mold was in her
[1:42:26] house they had this man come out he did
[1:42:29] all kinds of tests couldn't find nothing
[1:42:31] she said but Sir the place that God told
[1:42:34] me the mold was it's right over there
[1:42:36] he went over there and his machine went
[1:42:38] haywire right see that's how real God is
[1:42:45] is that right you think about who's out
[1:42:48] talking to somebody today I said think
[1:42:50] about this lady this this Aunt Jemima
[1:42:53] down there it was a Mississippi whoever
[1:42:55] but here she was praying I was talking
[1:42:59] to somebody that's it that's right
[1:43:00] her connection a Pentecostal woman was
[1:43:03] so connected with God she says Lord
[1:43:05] where's thy Elijah praying for her six
[1:43:09] thunders dying and God answered her
[1:43:12] prayer and sent Elijah that that's the
[1:43:15] kind of connections if it was then it
[1:43:18] could be now that's why I can't settle
[1:43:24] for religion religion drives me I can't
[1:43:27] do it I got to see the saying my mom was
[1:43:30] just a Pentecostal lady I'm closing I'm
[1:43:32] trying to anyway my momma couldn't read
[1:43:35] all right but when she said jr. the Lord
[1:43:38] said it happened just like that
[1:43:42] everything she ever told me has come to
[1:43:45] pass there was a time I didn't even know
[1:43:49] how she knew because back in the day I
[1:43:51] used to like to eat and my dad left us
[1:43:54] and left my mom with all those kids and
[1:43:56] all that
[1:43:58] and one day she must have saw it either
[1:44:01] my bed was making noise or my lips with
[1:44:04] white I don't know which it was but she
[1:44:06] said junior don't worry God is gonna
[1:44:09] send us food now this is you meet some
[1:44:13] of y'all may not understand this and
[1:44:14] never but I'm gonna tell you something
[1:44:16] just as sure as my mom said dad I opened
[1:44:19] up that back door getting ready to go
[1:44:21] out to play and there was several bags
[1:44:24] of food on the back porch and to this
[1:44:27] day we don't know who put it there
[1:44:29] but the Lord see those are the kind of
[1:44:33] things you say why God allowed that to
[1:44:35] happen just like he did with Elijah
[1:44:38] he allowed a raven to feed Elijah how
[1:44:42] many y'all would have been eat the hind
[1:44:44] a blackbird huh oh hey we all know what
[1:44:51] a race do you know what a raven is a
[1:44:55] raven II dad stop and cut use the words
[1:45:00] for her to bring your lunch
[1:45:05] tamo humility keeping a man humble and
[1:45:14] then on top of that God takes an old
[1:45:17] widow woman that's about ready to die
[1:45:20] perhaps more than likely skin and bone
[1:45:22] and tell Elijah you tell her fix mine
[1:45:27] first see some of us was we we say that
[1:45:31] that's not logical ain't nothin logical
[1:45:34] with God God don't use logic and as long
[1:45:39] as you use logic and processes in this
[1:45:41] world by logic you ain't gettin nowhere
[1:45:45] God took over man a man with a seventh
[1:45:48] grade education involved of greatest
[1:45:50] message you ever hit the earth and
[1:45:52] people looking at that don't make sense
[1:45:53] how can God use it don't God don't care
[1:45:56] about your opinion about things he did
[1:45:58] it took a prostitute
[1:46:08] into the city say come see a man shook
[1:46:11] the city I know them Pharisees but man
[1:46:16] y'all see what I'm saying those little
[1:46:19] things you said well what do you mean
[1:46:20] brother books that little small voice
[1:46:22] that talks if you listen if your bed
[1:46:30] everything you desire that's in the will
[1:46:33] of God he'll give it to you
[1:46:35] that's damn I fight on my knees that's
[1:46:38] where I fight I go to the man who fights
[1:46:43] for me and sometimes you just got to
[1:46:47] wait for the victory but the victory
[1:46:50] will always come sometime we'll move out
[1:46:53] move places or move there's life a god
[1:46:56] say stand here and you move like like
[1:46:58] the Prophet God did when told him that
[1:47:00] the Hat gotta be here and the old lady
[1:47:02] gotta be here and he moved before God he
[1:47:05] saw the vision he knew what God wanted
[1:47:07] but he moved before and God didn't let
[1:47:09] it happen until everything came back in
[1:47:11] order but when you move according to
[1:47:14] God's order you don't have to worry
[1:47:16] about nothing it's gonna all come
[1:47:21] this is war you can take your possession
[1:47:27] I believe we launder with Joshua's
[1:47:29] anointing Joshua's just another name for
[1:47:31] Jesus Jesus came and he possessed
[1:47:35] everything he even came and possessing
[1:47:38] death hell and the grave when you really
[1:47:42] want something the Bible said if you ask
[1:47:45] what's over you asking faith believing
[1:47:47] that you shall receive it he said you
[1:47:50] get it that's the way it is with God
[1:47:52] that's the way it is with believer we
[1:47:54] are not based our civilization is not
[1:47:57] based upon reasoning and and this modern
[1:48:00] day psychiatry no we are of a faith
[1:48:05] civilization and everything that we do
[1:48:09] should be based upon the faith and love
[1:48:11] of God when we work by faith we become
[1:48:16] victims
[1:48:16] Victor's like all say more than
[1:48:19] conquerors
[1:48:20] let us power by the God we come before
[1:48:24] you we thank you for your grace and your
[1:48:27] mercy help us dear Jesus it's always
[1:48:30] about
[1:48:31] [Music]
[1:48:32] we fight daily but we can't fight about
[1:48:36] with our own strength you've given us
[1:48:40] the Holy Spirit you've given us your
[1:48:41] word which is the greatest weapon tree
[1:48:44] that that you could have given us but
[1:48:47] give us Grace and wisdom to know how to
[1:48:50] use these things in battle you told us
