[33:27] as if a man should cast seed into the
[33:30] ground
[33:31] and should sleep and rise night and day
[33:35] and
[33:36] the seed should spring and grow up he
[33:38] knoweth not how
[33:40] for the earth bringeth forth fruit of
[33:42] herself first the blade
[33:45] then the ear and then the full corn in
[33:47] the ear

[35:23] path
[35:24] lord and lord and alight unto our feet
[35:26] father
[35:27] so we lay ourselves down before your
[35:29] word asking the lord to reveal it unto
[35:30] us
[35:31] right now in the name of jesus christ we
[35:33] pray
[35:34] amen amen we can be you can be seated
[35:39] i want to speak a message called the the
[35:42] seed of christ
[35:46] amen
[35:49] you know i was thinking about the the
[35:52] old testament
[35:54] and the jews and some of the
[35:57] remarkable signs and wonders that they
[36:00] had throughout all the history
[36:02] that you read in the old testament you
[36:05] know they have the powerful testimony
[36:07] about how
[36:08] abraham was called out and god started
[36:12] a new thing and and called abraham
[36:15] to start a nation really
[36:19] called abraham out of out of all the
[36:21] people of the earth he called abraham
[36:23] amen and said your seed will be like the
[36:25] stars of the heaven
[36:28] your your your offspring will be like
[36:30] the the
[36:31] the grains of the sand and on down
[36:34] throughout history
[36:35] as you watch that seed of abraham you
[36:38] know
[36:39] in isaac thy seed will be blessed
[36:42] and everything that god said about that
[36:44] that seed came to pass
[36:47] throughout all the ages every single
[36:49] prophecy
[36:50] that relayed to that seed came to pass
[36:54] whoever blesses you will be blessed
[36:56] whoever curses you will be cursed
[36:58] and on down throughout history those
[37:00] that blessed israel were blessed
[37:03] those that cursed israel were cursed if
[37:05] they gave the
[37:06] whoever they gave a cup of cold water to
[37:10] the children of israel were blessed
[37:13] moab would not let him go through their
[37:15] lands therefore the moabites were cursed
[37:17] and on down throughout history you see
[37:19] that same pattern over and over and over
[37:22] again of god blessing those
[37:25] that that that were a blessing to the
[37:27] seed of israel
[37:30] why because god was protecting something
[37:33] god had placed his place a
[37:36] seed there in abraham and he
[37:40] called it and called it out before and
[37:42] says as your seed goes forth
[37:44] you'll see signs and wonders you'll see
[37:47] you'll see miracles
[37:49] my angels will be surrounding that seed
[37:52] and
[37:52] constantly on down throughout history
[37:54] you see the
[37:55] profits rising up you see signs and
[37:58] wonders you see
[37:59] rivers being parted you see them going
[38:01] forth on dry ground
[38:03] and nothing could stop the seed of god
[38:05] on down through all history
[38:07] glory because god had something a vision
[38:11] inside of his mind
[38:12] where he had hidden his seed in the
[38:15] earth
[38:16] the earth had been cursed there in the
[38:18] end of the garden of eden
[38:20] the earth had been cursed there but
[38:22] right there in the midst of the curse
[38:24] god kept a blessing upon the earth god
[38:27] kept a blessing upon the earth
[38:29] even though he couldn't find the garden
[38:31] of eden anymore
[38:33] even though he couldn't find the the
[38:35] blessedness of a place where
[38:37] god had blessed the earth you couldn't
[38:38] find that blessed place you
[38:40] might find types of in goshen or types
[38:43] of it over here
[38:44] or a man that was blessed over there but
[38:47] but but
[38:48] nowhere could you find that that garden
[38:50] of eden anymore
[38:53] but as abraham was wandering around in
[38:55] the desert
[38:57] he says i have given you this entire
[38:59] land
[39:01] and i have given you this land as it
[39:03] will belong to you and your seed
[39:05] on down throughout all the generations
[39:08] you know and even though
[39:09] the the offspring after four generations
[39:13] left that land and went back to israel
[39:15] god never forgot that promise this land
[39:17] is your land
[39:19] 400 years went by but yet that promise
[39:22] of god
[39:23] that deed stayed there in the hands of
[39:25] jehovah
[39:26] waiting to give that deed back to the
[39:28] seed of abraham so that they could
[39:30] continue on in god's promises
[39:35] as the children of israel left egypt as
[39:37] they
[39:41] were getting ready to enter back into
[39:44] the promised land after those 40 years
[39:47] they were traveling through and you know
[39:50] after 40 years you know the
[39:55] a lot of things could go wrong you know
[39:59] though their shoes they didn't wear out
[40:02] they had a lot of blessings
[40:04] but you know a new generation was rising
[40:06] up
[40:07] and though they tried to faithfully
[40:09] teach them you know there's
[40:11] still losing that that memory of moses
[40:14] and
[40:15] uh the miracle of the red sea there and
[40:18] and some of those early blessings and
[40:20] and uh you know and you can just imagine
[40:23] how
[40:24] moses trying to run a tight ship but
[40:26] we're getting there towards the end as
[40:28] they're getting ready to cross over
[40:29] jordan
[40:32] and all of a sudden as they come back
[40:35] the
[40:35] land of moab there was a king that hired
[40:40] a prophet by the name of balaam
[40:43] and he said i want you to curse these
[40:45] people for me
[40:47] and this king balak he hired this
[40:50] prophet by the name of balaam
[40:55] i said i want you to go down there i
[40:57] want you to curse him
[41:00] and as baalik he first said he wouldn't
[41:02] go because he knew god wouldn't do it
[41:06] but then as he was convinced he decided
[41:09] to
[41:10] go ahead and go on anyhow even his
[41:13] donkey tried to tell him not to do it
[41:18] but he continued on
[41:22] and as he opened up his mouth
[41:26] he he was trying to he says well i'm
[41:29] only going to say what jehovah will say
[41:33] and i don't know what was going through
[41:34] balaam's mind
[41:40] but as he opened up his mouth the bible
[41:42] says that he
[41:43] blessed if you count the times he
[41:46] blessed israel four times in a row
[41:49] if you remember the story that he had to
[41:51] get a bala or balak would take him over
[41:53] to this mountaintop and say here i want
[41:56] i'll show you this part of israel i want
[41:57] you to curse
[41:59] and he'd open up his mouth and a
[42:01] blessing would come out
[42:04] and so the the king balak you take him
[42:06] up to this mountain show well i'll show
[42:08] you a different part of him over here
[42:10] and he'd open up his mouth and a
[42:11] blessing would come out amen
[42:14] i didn't take him up he took him to four
[42:15] different mountaintops
[42:18] and each time expect him to curse israel
[42:22] the last two times he he would have his
[42:24] eyes wide open also he'd go into a
[42:26] trance and he would
[42:27] see jehovah and all of a sudden he would
[42:30] bring out a prophecy
[42:37] why did god do that i want you to think
[42:41] about it
[42:41] the condition that israel was in this
[42:43] moment of time
[42:47] they had just been backslidden
[42:50] they had just been going against the
[42:52] laws that god had given them
[42:54] god sent snakes into their midst just a
[42:57] few
[42:58] days before this and it bits they're
[43:01] biting them inviting them you know and
[43:03] and they began crying out to jehovah and
[43:06] jehovah had him make that that brazen
[43:08] serpent and put it upon the pole
[43:11] and whoever looked at that brazen
[43:12] serpent would be saved
[43:15] whoever would refuse to look at it would
[43:17] be lost and they had to look up to that
[43:19] brazen servant
[43:21] that one hanging on that cross there
[43:26] in order to be saved and those that did
[43:29] they were
[43:30] those that refused were lost
[43:34] but that seed continued on in the midst
[43:37] of all that
[43:38] backsliding in the midst of all that
[43:41] the seed was continuing on continuing on
[43:45] i went balaam he went and looked at this
[43:48] backsliding people
[43:52] look to the people who are stiff-necked
[43:55] a people that couldn't follow the laws
[43:57] of god
[43:59] no matter how hard they tried they
[44:00] couldn't follow the laws of god when
[44:02] when bala when balaam looked upon them
[44:08] opened up his mouth
[44:14] and he said behold i have received a
[44:18] commandment to bless
[44:22] god has blessed them and i cannot
[44:24] reverse it
[44:25] balaam said that's right
[44:29] he said to balak god has blessed them
[44:33] i cannot reverse it
[44:39] if the israelites in that condition
[44:44] because of the seed that was dwelling
[44:45] inside of them
[44:47] could not have that blessing reversed
[44:51] it all gives us a little bit of a
[44:52] confidence saints
[44:54] yes balaam further on said
[45:00] jehovah has not beheld the iniquity in
[45:02] jacob
[45:05] neither has he seen perverseness in
[45:07] israel
[45:09] now when i go back i read through my
[45:11] bible
[45:13] and i read the book of exodus and i read
[45:16] the book of numbers
[45:18] i started thinking oh look at the
[45:19] perverseness oh look at all the iniquity
[45:23] but here comes a a a a hireling prophet
[45:27] this false prophet but he opens up his
[45:30] mouth all he can speak is the truth
[45:32] and he says i cannot god has blessed
[45:35] them
[45:36] no one can reverse it who can stop the
[45:39] blessing of god
[45:40] the seed of god is inside of them
[45:43] they're going where they they're going
[45:44] towards a promised land
[45:46] who can stop them
[45:50] he has not beheld their iniquity neither
[45:53] has he seen perverseness
[45:55] the lord jehovah his god is with him
[45:58] amen
[45:58] the shout out of a king is amongst them
[46:02] amen
[46:06] said these people israel they shall
[46:10] never dwell alone they shall
[46:11] dwell alone they should not be judged
[46:14] amongst the nations
[46:16] they shall stand by themselves
[46:19] when god goes to judge all the nations
[46:23] israel will stand by his side
[46:26] while the rest are judged
[46:30] the third time he went to curse them as
[46:33] balak took him up to another mountain
[46:38] he lifted up his eyes he saw israel
[46:40] abiding in their tents
[46:42] according to their tribes all in order
[46:44] and all of a sudden the spirit of
[46:45] jehovah came upon him
[46:52] as his eyes were open he fell into a
[46:54] trance
[46:57] as his face was looking at israel
[47:00] dwelling in this dry and dusty
[47:02] desert dust all over their tents
[47:08] constantly going astray here and there
[47:13] he says oh how beautiful are your tents
[47:18] as they were dwelling in the desert he
[47:20] said
[47:21] how beautiful are your tabernacles o
[47:23] israel
[47:25] as the gardens by the riverside
[47:28] as the trees that the lord hath planted
[47:30] as the cedar trees
[47:32] by the waters as his face is staring
[47:35] there
[47:35] looking at this dry and dusty desert
[47:38] this straggly people have been wondering
[47:40] for 40 years
[47:42] this false prophet looks out at him and
[47:44] he says all i can do is say what jehovah
[47:47] is seeing
[47:48] i can try i can't speak what my own eyes
[47:50] are seeing
[47:51] all i can speak through the eyes of
[47:53] jehovah and though they're drying in a
[47:55] dry and dusty land
[47:56] though they're dwelling in their sins i
[47:59] can't even see their perverseness
[48:01] i can't see their iniquities i can't see
[48:03] the dust on their tents
[48:04] oh how beautiful are your tents oh
[48:06] you're like trees in the desert
[48:08] you're like trees planted by the
[48:18] riverside
[48:20] and his their kingdom shall be exalted
[48:22] amongst the nations
[48:30] balaam said unto the messengers of balak
[48:32] where he said unto balak
[48:33] didn't i tell your messengers if you
[48:36] give me a house full of silver and gold
[48:39] i can't go beyond the commandment of the
[48:41] lord to do either good or bad of my own
[48:43] mind
[48:44] but what shall what what jehovah saith
[48:48] that will i speak
[48:52] and now and now as balaam is saying to
[48:55] baalik and now behold i am going up
[48:57] go unto my people
[49:00] come therefore and i will advertise thee
[49:03] what this people shall do unto thy
[49:05] people in the latter days
[49:09] and balaam's one last final time
[49:13] looks out across israel his eyes are
[49:17] open
[49:17] but he falls into a trance the spirit of
[49:19] the lord comes upon him
[49:23] he says i shall see him but not now i
[49:28] shall behold him but not nigh there
[49:29] shall come a star out of jacob
[49:32] and a scepter shall rise up out of
[49:34] israel
[49:35] and smite the nations the corners of
[49:38] moab
[49:39] and begin to describe all the nations
[49:43] that jacob shall destroy
[49:46] this prophet this hireling prophet was
[49:48] hired to curse
[49:51] the children of the most high god but
[49:54] there was a seed of
[49:56] abraham there was dwelling in the midst
[49:58] of them
[49:59] that no matter how much this prophet
[50:02] could not curse them
[50:03] all even if the houses of gold and
[50:06] silver were higher they were given to
[50:07] this prophet
[50:08] he couldn't go beyond as soon as he
[50:10] entered in to the
[50:11] presence of the lord as soon as the
[50:13] spirit of god came upon him and he
[50:15] opened his mouth all he could do is
[50:16] pronounce
[50:17] blessings why because as soon as he
[50:19] broke in
[50:21] to the the atmosphere
[50:24] of the heavenlies he could no longer
[50:26] speak
[50:27] what he saw of his own mind or what the
[50:30] the the
[50:31] influence of the silver of balak behind
[50:33] him but he could only speak out of the
[50:35] goodness of god towards his people the
[50:36] children of israel
[50:40] know the jews best days were not when
[50:43] they crossed the red sea
[50:46] it was not when they crossed the river
[50:48] jordan
[50:49] it was not when jerusalem
[50:55] when the temple was created under
[50:56] solomon
[50:58] their best days were when a messiah was
[51:00] given to them
[51:02] when god when a lamb was born in
[51:05] bethlehem
[51:06] the best days were when god gave them
[51:08] mercy
[51:10] to to to give them a messiah amen
[51:13] when the the promise that they've been
[51:15] looking for and looking for and looking
[51:17] for
[51:17] their best days were when christ
[51:21] came to them when the messiah came to
[51:23] them
[51:24] their very best days were it was when
[51:26] jesus christ
[51:28] after 30 years of wandering around came
[51:31] almost
[51:31] all started and started preaching the
[51:33] gospel to them
[51:35] healing their sick raising their dead
[51:39] preaching to them the mysteries of the
[51:41] gospel these were their best days and
[51:43] they didn't even see it they didn't even
[51:45] know it
[51:46] oh they danced on the riverside when
[51:48] they crossed the red sea
[51:49] they got out the tambourines and they
[51:51] sang and they danced
[51:52] but when christ came what did they do
[51:56] oh they rejoiced when when when solomon
[51:59] when solomon built the temple and
[52:02] the presence of god came down oh they
[52:05] all they were silenced was a wrong
[52:07] camp and they realized their god was
[52:09] amongst them
[52:10] but when jesus came
[52:14] who recognized it where were the crowds
[52:18] at the time of hezekiah's revival they
[52:21] all they all rent their clothing and
[52:23] then the whole
[52:24] nation repented in the times of josiah
[52:27] they repented and they had a revival
[52:29] but when jesus came
[52:34] where was this revival
[52:38] where was the honor that was due unto
[52:42] jesus christ
[52:44] the one that was comfortable
[52:52] jesus said if a man comes in his own
[52:54] name him you'll receive
[52:58] i come in my father's name and you
[53:00] receive me not
[53:04] let's turn over to john chapter 3.
[53:35] john 3 verse 14.
[53:39] we'll actually start with the 13th verse
[53:42] and no man hath ascended up to heaven
[53:46] but he that come down from heaven even
[53:48] the son of man which is in heaven
[53:51] as moses lifted up the serpent in the
[53:53] wilderness
[53:54] even so the son of man must be lifted up
[53:58] whosoever believeth in him should not
[54:00] perish but have eternal life
[54:04] for god so loved the world that he gave
[54:07] his only begotten son
[54:09] and whosoever believeth in him should
[54:12] not perish
[54:13] but have everlasting life for god sent
[54:16] not his son into the world to condemn
[54:18] the world
[54:19] but that the world through him might be
[54:22] saved
[54:24] verse 18 he that believeth on him is not
[54:28] condemned
[54:29] but he that believeth not is condemned
[54:32] already because he has not believed in
[54:33] the name of the only begotten son of god
[54:36] amen jesus christ was that only begotten
[54:40] son of god
[54:41] he was that seed that was promised amen
[54:44] he was that seed that god was protecting
[54:48] down throughout generation through
[54:49] generation through generation
[54:52] when when balaam rose up to curse
[54:55] he couldn't curse because that seed was
[54:57] traveling through the desert
[54:59] when when when when the uh when the when
[55:02] the seas
[55:03] parted and they marched across dry
[55:05] ground
[55:06] though that that water could not crash
[55:08] down upon them
[55:09] because that seed was marching through
[55:11] there god's seed was going to continue
[55:14] on through generation to generation
[55:17] and be revealed in the last days of the
[55:19] jews
[55:21] amen and now when that seed rose up
[55:27] he said i am the only begotten son of
[55:29] god
[55:31] let's turn to uh galatians 3
[55:44] galatians 3 verse 16.
[55:50] now to abraham and his seed were the
[55:53] promises made
[55:55] and he saith not anti-seeds as of many
[56:00] but as of one and to thy seed which
[56:03] is christ
[56:10] so who are the promises made to
[56:13] it's for christ
[56:16] what was that journey through all those
[56:19] 2000 years of the jews
[56:22] for christ christ to be revealed upon
[56:26] the earth
[56:27] amen that seed was to be revealed
[56:31] people say oh i i'm a son of god the
[56:34] bible says that jesus was the only
[56:36] begotten son of god
[56:38] you say oh i i've been saved let me tell
[56:41] you jesus was the only one that was
[56:42] saved
[56:45] if you want to be saved you got to get
[56:47] inside of christ
[56:49] let me tell you there is no shelter
[56:51] people act with so much pride inside
[56:53] their church
[56:54] inside their denomination inside their
[56:57] doctrine inside their dogma
[56:59] and they can hide in all kinds of things
[57:00] but let me tell you there's only one
[57:02] hiding place
[57:03] because there's only one man saved and
[57:05] that's inside the lord jesus christ amen
[57:09] all the jews they they they they had so
[57:11] much pride amongst their religion
[57:13] and about all all the things all the
[57:16] miracles the signs and the wonders
[57:18] throughout 2 000 years of their history
[57:20] but the whole journey was so that the
[57:22] seed might be revealed
[57:24] which was christ because the promises
[57:26] were made to christ
[57:27] the inheritor was christ the one that
[57:30] inherited all the promises was christ
[57:32] the the garden of eden was restored to
[57:35] jesus christ
[57:37] everything was to jesus christ but when
[57:39] jesus christ finally came they didn't
[57:42] recognize him
[57:42] oh they received moses they received
[57:45] hezekiah
[57:46] they received josiah they received all
[57:48] the kings
[57:49] they received the prophets but but now
[57:51] christ stands up and he's rejected
[57:54] by the entire nation
[57:58] oh they danced on the riverside when the
[58:01] red sea was
[58:04] but when he fed the four thousand they
[58:06] were only interested in the food
[58:15] jesus says you're only following me
[58:17] because i gave you the food
[58:19] remember the scripture
[58:23] he says don't labor for the meat that
[58:25] perishes
[58:26] but labor for the meat that brings to
[58:29] everlasting life
[58:32] jesus christ was the seed
[58:36] that was to come you know
[58:39] the jews best time
[58:43] most glorious time was when the seed of
[58:46] god
[58:46] was being revealed amen when jesus
[58:50] christ was revealed ayo and the jews
[58:54] have had this
[58:54] or the gentiles have had a similar
[58:56] testimony
[58:58] we've had our revivals we've had our
[59:01] miracles our signs and our wonders
[59:04] we've had so many things but now we have
[59:06] christ
[59:07] as the mystery of god revealed we had
[59:09] the revelation of jesus christ in this
[59:11] last days
[59:12] we've had god himself healing this
[59:16] coming down amongst his people healing
[59:19] the sick
[59:19] amen raising the dead they say oh no
[59:22] that was brother brown let me tell you
[59:24] that wasn't brother brandon brother ben
[59:25] was just a man
[59:26] on the stage but there was someone that
[59:29] was greater than that man in the room
[59:32] amen
[59:35] revelation of jesus christ
[59:41] if the jews could have received the day
[59:43] that they were living in
[59:48] but you know it's the people that are
[59:49] living in a dry and dusty time
[59:52] that when the spirit comes if they don't
[59:54] enter into the spirit of that time
[59:57] then they just live out there in the
[59:58] desert land it was a religious desert
[1:00:01] when jesus came
[1:00:02] amen and the only water
[1:00:05] was jesus christ
[1:00:10] christ was the only hope
[1:00:14] it's like in the time of ruth there was
[1:00:17] many women that were gleaning in the
[1:00:19] field
[1:00:21] but there was a woman named ruth that
[1:00:25] discovered a secret
[1:00:29] her mother-in-law told her a secret
[1:00:34] she said boaz
[1:00:37] is up on the threshing floor tonight
[1:00:41] if you go in there and you lay yourself
[1:00:44] at his feet
[1:00:46] and do exactly as i tell you to do
[1:00:50] and if you tell them spread your skirt
[1:00:52] over me
[1:01:00] then he will fulfill the promise upon
[1:01:02] you
[1:01:05] so ruth she listened to everything her
[1:01:07] mother-in-law told her to do
[1:01:10] she snuck into the threshing floor that
[1:01:12] night
[1:01:13] she waited till after everybody was
[1:01:15] tired and fallen asleep just like her
[1:01:17] mother-in-law told her to
[1:01:19] as she went and she laid down a boaz's
[1:01:22] feet
[1:01:24] where were all the other women they
[1:01:26] didn't know the secret
[1:01:31] they weren't listening to the message
[1:01:35] they didn't know the time and the hour
[1:01:36] that they were living in
[1:01:39] nighttime had come and they had fallen
[1:01:41] asleep but there was one woman in the
[1:01:42] land that knew the secret
[1:01:46] and so she went and she laid down at
[1:01:48] boaz's feet
[1:01:50] and when he woke up he was afraid he
[1:01:52] says who art thou and she says
[1:01:55] i am thy handmaiden i am thy servant
[1:02:00] i am the one i am i am your servant and
[1:02:02] none other
[1:02:04] i belong to no one else i belong to you
[1:02:07] i am thine and thine alone o lord
[1:02:14] and she said and then she said those
[1:02:16] words
[1:02:17] just spread your skirt over me
[1:02:20] oh if the bride of christ if the
[1:02:24] wise virgins right now amen could rise
[1:02:27] up out of their sleep and say the same
[1:02:29] thing
[1:02:29] lord spread your skirt over me lord fill
[1:02:33] me with your holy ghost
[1:02:34] lord it is night out but you know what
[1:02:36] we know the secret
[1:02:38] it's a dry and dusty time churches are
[1:02:41] dying all over the place
[1:02:42] people are dead in the pews spiritually
[1:02:45] dead in the pews
[1:02:46] but there is a wise bride of christ who
[1:02:48] can stand up and say lord
[1:02:50] spread your skirt over me lord
[1:02:54] fill me with your holy ghost lord
[1:02:57] let my lamp be trimmed lord
[1:03:01] don't let me die here lord
[1:03:04] i didn't come here this far just to die
[1:03:06] as a
[1:03:07] laodicean but i came to be the bride of
[1:03:10] christ
[1:03:14] time of esther
[1:03:18] she was a jew but she was living in
[1:03:19] another land
[1:03:22] and the jews were getting ready to be
[1:03:23] wiped out
[1:03:28] and her uncle mordecai
[1:03:31] said you have a secret you're a jew
[1:03:36] jehovah is behind you because of who you
[1:03:40] are
[1:03:41] because the seed of god is laying inside
[1:03:44] of you
[1:03:48] you are a child of abraham therefore you
[1:03:51] were born for such a time as this
[1:03:54] and that was the secret that was given
[1:03:56] unto her
[1:03:57] and so she knew it'd be certain death to
[1:04:00] go into the king but she
[1:04:01] but she knew it was her opportunity as a
[1:04:03] one chance to save the seed of god
[1:04:06] they were getting ready to be slain by
[1:04:08] the enemy
[1:04:09] and so she went into the the the throne
[1:04:12] of the king
[1:04:13] and and she knew that jehovah was behind
[1:04:15] her
[1:04:16] and she said if i perish let me perish
[1:04:19] but i'll stand up for jehovah
[1:04:20] she knew the secret oh there was many
[1:04:23] there's many women that had gone in
[1:04:25] before the king
[1:04:28] there were many virgins that had gone in
[1:04:30] before the king but there is one that
[1:04:32] had a secret
[1:04:33] she had the secret that mordecai had
[1:04:35] given unto her the message had been
[1:04:37] given
[1:04:37] to her amen and under the power of that
[1:04:40] secret she went into the throne room
[1:04:44] amen for such a time as this
[1:04:51] and the seed was saved
[1:04:55] there was a time when i think as our
[1:04:59] brother isaiah was preaching
[1:05:00] i think it was tamar
[1:05:03] she knew that the seed must carry on
[1:05:10] but all physical opportunities that she
[1:05:12] knew of
[1:05:15] would pass by she could not see the seed
[1:05:19] pass on according to the law
[1:05:21] that there was an inheritance that would
[1:05:24] fail
[1:05:25] there was an inheritance they would
[1:05:27] belong to that seed
[1:05:28] but that seed that was promised to or
[1:05:30] was not given to her
[1:05:34] she said i got to receive that seed
[1:05:37] somehow
[1:05:39] i got to receive that seed somehow
[1:05:43] somehow that seed has to continue on
[1:05:47] and so she went by a way that seemed
[1:05:50] like foolishness
[1:05:52] she went by a way that seemed like uh
[1:05:54] like wickedness
[1:05:56] she went by a way that seemed not even
[1:05:58] right to the man she dressed up like a
[1:06:00] prostitute
[1:06:02] and she went to her uh her expected
[1:06:04] father-in-law
[1:06:09] disguised and hidden why did she do that
[1:06:13] it was revealed unto her
[1:06:17] it was revealed something had revealed
[1:06:19] unto her
[1:06:20] to get that seed
[1:06:27] receive that seed or perish
[1:06:35] so her father-in-law said unto her what
[1:06:38] price
[1:06:40] for this act she said give me your
[1:06:44] signet
[1:06:45] and your staff and your bracelets
[1:06:49] then afterwards when she found that she
[1:06:51] was expecting was child
[1:06:52] months later she was getting ready to be
[1:06:55] stoned
[1:06:57] getting ready to be burned with fire
[1:07:00] and she went over to her tent and she
[1:07:03] had hidden under her bed a
[1:07:05] a signet and a staff
[1:07:08] and a few bracelets
[1:07:12] oh she went to judgment
[1:07:15] and she was getting ready to be judged
[1:07:17] by her father-in-law
[1:07:19] she said but before you stone me
[1:07:23] before you burn me with fire i have a
[1:07:25] question i want to ask you
[1:07:28] whose signant is this
[1:07:31] whose rings are these whose staff
[1:07:34] does this belong to
[1:07:39] when he looked upon her
[1:07:42] he said she's been more righteous than i
[1:07:46] for she has made sure the seed will
[1:07:49] continue on
[1:07:50] her eye was towards the promise her eye
[1:07:53] was towards that seed
[1:07:55] sharia is towards fulfilling the promise
[1:07:57] of abraham
[1:07:58] but to continue on the inheritance to
[1:08:01] make sure that inheritance didn't fall
[1:08:03] on the ground amen
[1:08:05] and there is an inheritance in our last
[1:08:07] day
[1:08:08] of a filling of the holy ghost of a
[1:08:11] bride of christ so would stand up
[1:08:14] that marched to zion singing onward
[1:08:16] christian soldier
[1:08:18] marching as to war
[1:08:22] whose sickness is this where did you get
[1:08:25] this holy spirit
[1:08:27] where did you get this life that was
[1:08:28] within you i went to the what
[1:08:30] the giver of life i went to the one
[1:08:34] i found out what the secret was i laid
[1:08:36] down at his feet

[1:08:41] give me your staff give me your
[1:08:44] bracelets
[1:08:49] there's got to be a bride
[1:08:54] there is only one seed that the promises
[1:08:57] were made to
[1:08:58] the lord jesus christ
[1:09:01] but there was a secret that was revealed
[1:09:04] on that last sunlight those last
[1:09:06] days of the jews that roman soldier put
[1:09:08] the seer
[1:09:09] side and the spear into the side of
[1:09:11] christ
[1:09:12] outflow of blood water and spirit and
[1:09:15] that there would be a
[1:09:17] bride to the second adam amen
[1:09:24] and even though time was put on pause
[1:09:27] for the jews
[1:09:29] there was a mystery that had to be
[1:09:32] revealed
[1:09:36] time of daniel been prophesied there's
[1:09:38] 70 weeks left
[1:09:42] but in the midst of the last last week
[1:09:46] something's going to happen amen
[1:09:49] and we've been on pause for these last
[1:09:51] 2000 years
[1:09:54] in the midst of the week we've been on
[1:09:57] pause
[1:09:58] as god put the entire jewish nation on
[1:10:02] pause
[1:10:03] they rejected their messiah but they did
[1:10:06] it so
[1:10:07] god could preserve life so that god
[1:10:10] could preserve a seed
[1:10:13] so god could preserve a bride and now
[1:10:16] that mystery is being revealed
[1:10:19] that there will be a bride of christ it
[1:10:22] was that mystery bride that was
[1:10:25] spoken of hid today all throughout down
[1:10:27] throughout all the old testament
[1:10:29] she was that bride of joseph it was that
[1:10:32] bride throughout on down the one that
[1:10:34] would inherit the seed
[1:10:36] there's got to be a bride of christ it
[1:10:39] was
[1:10:40] hinted at it was prophesied of it was
[1:10:42] spoken of
[1:10:44] on all down through the whole testament
[1:10:47] but as the jews were put on pause
[1:10:50] there's a now this 2000 year span of
[1:10:53] time where the jews wonder
[1:10:54] what happened to us
[1:10:58] why have we been in this condition but
[1:11:01] now as they
[1:11:02] begin to revive
[1:11:05] let me tell you the bride's la bet last
[1:11:08] time
[1:11:09] the best time just like the jews best
[1:11:11] time is right now
[1:11:13] amen so i don't see much happening
[1:11:18] you know you just got to open your eyes
[1:11:21] we're living in a day where the holy
[1:11:23] ghost has been revealed
[1:11:25] or the power of god has been revealed
[1:11:26] where the plan of christ has been
[1:11:28] revealed
[1:11:30] to where the the bride is to be standing
[1:11:32] up waiting
[1:11:34] but it's only to those that know the
[1:11:36] secret
[1:11:38] and the secret comes through a message
[1:11:40] that has been revealed to the bride of
[1:11:42] christ
[1:11:44] amen
[1:11:49] christ is the mystery of god revealed
[1:11:54] but the second adam had a second bride
[1:11:59] had her bride which was christ
[1:12:02] and the bride of christ she goes into
[1:12:05] the threshing floor
[1:12:08] she says lord just spread your skirt
[1:12:11] over me
[1:12:12] i haven't saw anybody else's household i
[1:12:15] haven't threshed in anybody else's
[1:12:17] fields
[1:12:18] i have i've laid aside all the things of
[1:12:21] this denomination or this doctrine over
[1:12:24] here
[1:12:24] i've lay aside the foolishness of my of
[1:12:27] these things over here lord i am looking
[1:12:29] to the promise
[1:12:30] which is the lord jesus christ there are
[1:12:33] who is receiving christ when he came
[1:12:35] 2000 years ago
[1:12:37] those that were called who is receiving
[1:12:39] christ right now
[1:12:40] those that were called amen amen
[1:12:43] amen
[1:12:48] amen the seed of god or the kingdom of
[1:12:52] heaven is like a seed that was put into
[1:12:54] the ground and
[1:12:55] man watch it day or night and and then
[1:12:58] it rises up first the year
[1:13:00] then the the stalk and then the corn in
[1:13:03] the air but then
[1:13:04] as soon as the seed is revealed
[1:13:08] then the harvest comes as soon as the
[1:13:11] shuck begins to
[1:13:12] pull away it ripens in the sun
[1:13:16] and as soon as it ripens the harvest has
[1:13:18] come
[1:13:20] jesus said in matthew 25 let them grow
[1:13:23] together until the end
[1:13:25] as the the the servant came and says
[1:13:28] there
[1:13:29] didn't you plant good seed in your field
[1:13:31] where do these terrorists come from
[1:13:33] and the master said let them grow
[1:13:35] together till the end
[1:13:37] but in the last days i'll send out the
[1:13:40] angels and they'll begin binding the
[1:13:42] tears
[1:13:43] and they'll bind them tighter and
[1:13:45] tighter and tighter and tighter
[1:13:47] and at the last days the bride will
[1:13:50] stand alone
[1:13:54] everybody else will be bound but the
[1:13:56] bride will stand alone
[1:13:58] there will be one over here there will
[1:14:00] be one over there
[1:14:01] the brother brandon says oh don't look
[1:14:03] for one big group no it'll be one over
[1:14:05] here what was he describing he's
[1:14:06] describing matthew 25

[1:14:12] a stock over there what what so what are
[1:14:14] these stocks doing
[1:14:17] the seat is ripening in the sun amen
[1:14:19] what are they doing they're listening to
[1:14:20] the secret
[1:14:21] they're being ripened they know they've
[1:14:23] heard the secret they're listening to
[1:14:25] what their mother-in-law that
[1:14:26] told them to do amen
[1:14:29] go put yourself at boaz's feet
[1:14:33] wait till he until he fulfills the
[1:14:36] inheritance upon you and our inheritance
[1:14:38] is the fullness of the holy ghost let me
[1:14:41] tell you god's people as i said a few
[1:14:43] weeks ago
[1:14:44] god's people are always crying out for a
[1:14:45] partial deliverance
[1:14:47] for a halfway deliverance for a 50
[1:14:50] deliverance
[1:14:50] but let me tell you god's not interested
[1:14:52] in any type of deliverance like that
[1:14:54] god is only interested in a full and
[1:14:56] complete deliverance
[1:14:57] god does not make halfway christians god
[1:15:00] does not make halfway preachers
[1:15:02] god does not make halfway husbands
[1:15:04] halfway wives
[1:15:05] halfway mothers god makes a complete and
[1:15:08] whole
[1:15:11] and when you're living in the day of the
[1:15:13] hour when all things come together
[1:15:15] all things dovetail all things come to
[1:15:18] their completion
[1:15:19] amen the satan is coming to his
[1:15:21] completion the denominations are coming
[1:15:23] to their
[1:15:24] completion their seeds are ripening amen
[1:15:27] and all the wickedness that has been
[1:15:28] sowed throughout all the generations
[1:15:31] are now coming we see them a ripening
[1:15:34] all around us
[1:15:35] amen as the seeds of wickedness are are
[1:15:38] being ripened all around us but so is a
[1:15:40] bride
[1:15:41] and we say oh what's going on it feels
[1:15:44] like i'm all alone but it's prophesied
[1:15:46] you'd be alone
[1:15:47] just lay yourself at your his feet they
[1:15:49] because they that wait upon the lord
[1:15:51] they're the ones that are going to renew
[1:15:52] their strengths
[1:15:55] amen why because that seed of christ
[1:15:59] continues on spread your skirt over me
[1:16:02] lord
[1:16:03] whose signet is this i have the life of
[1:16:06] christ inside of me
[1:16:08] amen because in the in the end that is
[1:16:11] the only thing that will save you
[1:16:14] is the life of the lord jesus christ
[1:16:17] amen oh there were many women in the
[1:16:20] land but those that received the life
[1:16:23] in every single one of these hidden
[1:16:25] patterns throughout all the old
[1:16:26] testament
[1:16:27] the promise was given to those that
[1:16:29] received the life
[1:16:33] amen they're the ones that were saved
[1:16:38] we have to have the life of christ the
[1:16:41] full character of christ
[1:16:43] must be developed on the inside of us
[1:16:45] why because we're the ones that know the
[1:16:47] secret
[1:16:48] we've we've found out what his secret is
[1:16:52] amen amen just like on the
[1:16:55] on the reverse side it's like delilah
[1:16:58] found out samson's secret
[1:17:00] amen by now that was just the negative
[1:17:03] but on the positive
[1:17:04] the bride of christ found the secret
[1:17:07] amen we are tied to him
[1:17:10] amen amen why because there is only one
[1:17:14] man
[1:17:14] saved that's christ
[1:17:18] amen he is the one that the promises
[1:17:20] were made to
[1:17:22] amen but if we are on the inside of him
[1:17:24] we shall be saved
[1:17:26] why as a bride is saved by your husband
[1:17:29] amen it's not by your
[1:17:31] theology it's not by your high thinking
[1:17:34] stop by how much you know it's not by uh
[1:17:38] how smart and how good you can look but
[1:17:40] further in this man's side or in this
[1:17:42] man's side it doesn't matter how
[1:17:44] much men say about you but are you
[1:17:46] revealing the life of christ
[1:17:48] is christ showing on the inside of you
[1:17:50] amen do you have the attributes of
[1:17:52] christ
[1:17:53] showing themselves without you outside
[1:17:55] of you amen
[1:17:56] why because when we are called to the
[1:17:58] day of the judgment
[1:18:00] only the bride will stand alone
[1:18:02] everybody else will go to the judgment
[1:18:03] but those who have the life of christ on
[1:18:05] the inside
[1:18:06] amen will be seated with him in his
[1:18:08] throne
[1:18:10] amen amen we have his secret
[1:18:15] amen and who can curse what god has
[1:18:17] blessed

[1:19:20] many they'll say it's by this dogma
[1:19:24] by that dogma
[1:19:27] many will say by speaking in tongues
[1:19:31] when you believe you receive
[1:19:36] or that the church has power to confirm
[1:19:38] the holy spirit upon you
[1:19:41] or when you take this holy eucharist you
[1:19:44] receive that life

[1:21:12] those that are alive and
[1:21:14] remain at the coming of the lord
[1:21:18] [Music]
[1:21:20] many people think they're alive but
[1:21:22] that's not the life that we're talking
[1:21:24] about
[1:21:25] there's only one life and that is all
[1:21:28] that we seek after lord
[1:21:30] we've laid everything else aside lord
[1:21:33] but those that are alive and remain at
[1:21:35] the coming of the lord
[1:21:37] they're the ones that received the
[1:21:40] secret
[1:21:43] [Music]
[1:21:51] we shall rise
[1:21:54] and renew our up
[1:22:01] [Music]
[1:22:08] amen
[1:22:10] a secret in the bible it's been hidden
[1:22:13] on
[1:22:13] down throughout all generations bride
[1:22:16] after bride after bride after bride
[1:22:19] those that were given secrets
[1:22:24] [Music]
[1:22:30] isaiah to come up finish out the service
[1:22:41] [Music]
[1:22:50] we truly thank god for the seed
[1:22:54] i am one that rests upon that
[1:22:58] it is the only thing that will take you
[1:23:00] from earth to glory
[1:23:02] the seed itself which is christ
[1:23:06] brother branham said that the foolish
[1:23:08] virgins was caught
[1:23:10] out of the same material
[1:23:13] one just didn't get the holy ghost
[1:23:17] predestination comes in two two forms
[1:23:19] maybe three
[1:23:21] you need a predestined to go to hell you
[1:23:24] say don't say that but it's true
[1:23:26] you're either predestined to be foolish
[1:23:27] versions or you're predestined to be
[1:23:29] bribed
[1:23:32] whichever way it is the rain comes the
[1:23:35] anointing comes
[1:23:36] it falls and it's going to make you
[1:23:39] whoever you
[1:23:40] are and uh you know i thank god for that
[1:23:44] because
[1:23:47] knowing your bride you must come to have
[1:23:49] a revelation of that
[1:23:51] it's not a hope so it's a no-so
[1:23:54] and when god has given that to you then
[1:23:56] you can understand what he's preaching
[1:23:58] about
[1:24:00] that that seed is going to bring forth
[1:24:02] because of the rain because the
[1:24:04] conditions
[1:24:05] the weather whether it be snow rain
[1:24:08] sleet
[1:24:08] ice sun each each condition you go
[1:24:12] through
[1:24:13] it's for your benefit it's going to
[1:24:16] bring you to your
[1:24:17] full potential whatever you are
[1:24:20] and i trust that everybody tonight have
[1:24:23] a understanding of who they are
[1:24:26] one thing i know one thing i know about
[1:24:28] the seed of god and i love this
[1:24:30] [Music]
[1:24:31] you know when it came to ruth when it
[1:24:33] came to tamar
[1:24:35] you know and others who just was not
[1:24:39] going to let
[1:24:40] circumstances keep them back
[1:24:44] they were able to plow through all
[1:24:46] circumstances
[1:24:49] to get the promise and that's just the
[1:24:52] way the true seat of god is
[1:24:54] yeah we're going to have obstacles we're
[1:24:56] going to have rivers to cross
[1:24:58] and bridges and mountains to climb and
[1:25:01] valleys to go through
[1:25:02] but there's a determination in the seed
[1:25:04] of god
[1:25:06] to come to perfection no matter
[1:25:09] what god put us in the worst
[1:25:13] age ever this is laodicea
[1:25:16] this is the most wicked age this is
[1:25:18] where satan
[1:25:19] amen is god of this age
[1:25:22] you have an adversary who's come to
[1:25:25] destroy
[1:25:26] kill steal and destroy i'm not trying to
[1:25:28] preach over him
[1:25:30] last time i didn't say nothing maybe i'm
[1:25:32] saying too much now
[1:25:34] but i just want to encourage him to keep
