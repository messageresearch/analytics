[17:09] enter into his gates with Thanksgiving
[17:11] let you into his courts with praise amen
[17:15] and will should see him fix it
[17:17] I look forward to that day Saints I wish
[17:21] singing that song I wish my voice could
[17:23] go a little bit higher Haven you know I
[17:28] couldn't shout if I wanted to my voice
[17:31] always just seems to hit that little
[17:34] ceiling there but I just thank God
[17:37] I'll get what I have to him that's for
[17:39] sure amen our God is good he's done all
[17:44] things well
[17:46] hey man let's just as we stand we'll get
[17:48] into the word of Lord this morning well
[17:52] I thank our musicians I so long we
[17:56] didn't have any musicians
[17:58] I think it's been 17 years now since
[18:03] this church was formed years decade
[18:07] probably a decade or more with no
[18:09] musicians and it just makes us
[18:12] appreciate the sound of music not just
[18:15] having the instruments here but have
[18:17] people that know how to use them it's
[18:20] just it's a blessing I I knew the day
[18:23] would arrive I knew the day would come
[18:24] we'd put the request upon the altar and
[18:27] I knew that God would aspire someone
[18:29] amen and he has done it
[18:31] Amen he's fulfilled it Amen so I was
[18:35] talking to brother Liz Paul last night
[18:38] and he said something that just kind of
[18:41] stirred something within me and about a
[18:45] year and a half ago I preached a message
[18:46] here called tithes and offerings and and
[18:48] I studied a sworn I was like you know I
[18:52] think we're just going to kind of
[18:53] revisit that message and even though I
[18:57] have entitled this tithes and offerings
[19:00] in reality it probably ought to be
[19:03] titled forsaking all amen because really
[19:07] that is what we're here to do I mean
[19:09] even though we might type it out by how
[19:11] we give our tithes and offerings to the
[19:13] Lord but in reality it's just a token
[19:15] it's a sign it's an emblem that we have
[19:19] lifted our hand unto Jehovah amen amen
[19:22] so let's just opening our Bibles to
[19:25] first Corinthians chapter 4 and I know
[19:31] in preaching I don't usually approach
[19:33] things the way it Farley by else would I
[19:35] always whenever I want to preach on a
[19:38] subject I always seem to take this wide
[19:41] circle around the subject before I come
[19:44] back to it that's just the way that I am
[19:46] so let's start our circle shall we
[19:51] we'll go to first Corinthians chapter 4
[19:54] will read the 6th to the 10th verse
[20:05] st. Paul writing they said and these
[20:13] things brethren I have in a figure
[20:16] transferred to myself and to Apollo's
[20:19] for your sakes that you might learn in
[20:22] us not to think of men above that which
[20:26] is written that no one of you be puffed
[20:28] up for one against another for who make
[20:33] us need to differ from another and what
[20:36] hast thou that thou does not receive now
[20:39] if thou did sieve it why does thou glory
[20:42] if thou has not received it and now you
[20:46] are full now you are rich you have
[20:48] reigned as kings without us and I would
[20:51] to God that you did reign that we might
[20:54] also reign with you for I think that God
[20:57] hath set forth us the Apostles last as
[21:00] it were appointed to death for we are
[21:02] made a spectacle
[21:03] under the world and to angels and to men
[21:06] we are fools for Christ's sake
[21:10] the year wise in Christ we are weak but
[21:14] you are strong you are honorable
[21:16] but we're despised amen now let's turn
[21:20] over to turn to Genesis chapter 12 what
[21:27] do you have that you did not first
[21:29] receive you know I think every single
[21:31] one of us if we have anything any
[21:34] revelation as many might say well I
[21:37] I wish brother soso could see it the way
[21:40] I see it or I wish so-and-so could see
[21:42] it the way I see it well if you see
[21:44] anything it's because God gave it to you
[21:46] amen revelations chattri Genesis chapter
[21:52] 12 verse 1 says now in the Lord had said
[21:57] unto Abram get thee out of thy country
[21:59] and from thy kindred and from thy
[22:03] father's house unto a land that I will
[22:06] show thee and I will make of thee a
[22:09] great nation and I will bless thee and
[22:12] make
[22:12] I name great and thou shalt be a
[22:14] blessing I'll bless them that bless thee
[22:17] and curse them that curse thee and in
[22:20] thee shall all the families of the earth
[22:22] be blessed
[22:24] a man let's just bow our heads and word
[22:27] of Prayer Heavenly Father I just pray
[22:30] Lord that as you called me to be a
[22:33] minister Lord you didn't call me to
[22:35] minister my word Lord but to your work
[22:37] so father we just ask that you would
[22:40] come and bring the anointing this
[22:41] morning father and that you would speak
[22:44] through me Lord and not that I would
[22:46] speak Lord but you would speak through
[22:48] your vessel Lord and that the people
[22:50] might hear from your word Lord and be
[22:53] blessed Lord for you of giving yourself
[22:55] as an inheritance to the people Lord and
[22:57] so as they speak as we speak your word
[23:00] this morning father may their hearts be
[23:03] opened and may you be received into
[23:05] their hearts Lord and the might the
[23:07] people might leave today knowing we have
[23:09] heard from God this morning we have been
[23:12] blessed and we thank you Lord we we we
[23:15] we like Abraham we've lifted up our
[23:17] hands unto you Lord and we knowing that
[23:19] you have called us Lord now let us
[23:21] receive the inheritance of the baptism
[23:24] of the holy ghost that token of our
[23:26] future body we pray Lord as we receive
[23:29] you Lord we receive all things and we
[23:31] thank you Father in the name of the Lord
[23:34] Jesus Christ we pray we dedicate this
[23:36] service into your hands Lord amen amen
[23:39] you can be seated
[23:46] it's good to see everyone you this
[23:48] morning you know I really believe in
[23:50] church services I just I believe in them
[23:54] I believe that God ordained them when
[23:57] Jesus gave us the promise he said
[23:59] wherever two or three are gathered
[24:02] together in my name I will come right
[24:05] there in the midst of them yone every
[24:08] time there is a visitation there is a
[24:11] purpose for that visitation Amen when
[24:14] Jesus visits his people he always does
[24:18] it for a very specific purpose Amen he
[24:21] gave us a promise that right here in a
[24:23] day called today he would visit his
[24:26] people a man wherever two or three are
[24:28] gathering in him I named I will come and
[24:31] I will visit you amen if he is going to
[24:34] come and visit us he's going to do it
[24:36] for a very specific purpose he's going
[24:38] to do it for a very specific reason so I
[24:40] think that even no matter what you had
[24:44] in your mind and you came into this door
[24:45] many people come to the house of God for
[24:48] specific purposes some people come out
[24:50] of traditions sake some people come
[24:53] because they feel that if they don't
[24:55] come people might talk against them some
[24:58] people come because just something to do
[25:00] but there are people that come into this
[25:02] place to meet God amen they come into
[25:05] this place because they have an opinion
[25:08] that they know it's been revealed unto
[25:10] them that if they come into this place
[25:12] that they will meet God now there are
[25:14] many of those say well I could stay home
[25:16] and meet God in my prayer closet and
[25:18] that is true I could stay home when I
[25:21] could pray and I believe that I can meet
[25:23] God well that is true amen but God has
[25:26] ordained that iron shall sharpen iron
[25:29] and that only happens when it makes
[25:31] contact amen and not only do we have to
[25:34] learn how to interact between God and
[25:36] man but we also have to in turn how to
[25:39] interact one with another amen and even
[25:43] beyond that God has placed in the church
[25:46] a ministry amen and that ministry it
[25:52] says in the book of Ephesians that
[25:54] ministry is for the perfecting of the
[25:56] Saints amen so there's something to do
[25:59] that ministry that would cause the
[26:02] Saints to come a little bit closer to
[26:04] call God to come a little bit better to
[26:06] become more perfected in Christ amen now
[26:10] let's go back over here let's go back to
[26:12] the beginning of what we were started
[26:13] preaching about talking about Abraham
[26:15] when Abraham was called he was called to
[26:21] leave his father behind to leave his
[26:25] father's house behind amen now when when
[26:29] Abraham was growing up in the land of ur
[26:32] he had a certain expectation that
[26:35] everything that his father owned will be
[26:38] transferred to him through what we call
[26:41] an inheritance Amen that has been
[26:44] throughout history that whenever the
[26:46] parents died that the children receive
[26:50] an inheritance from their from their
[26:52] parents from their father and their
[26:54] mother as their father and their mother
[26:56] spent all the days of their lives and as
[26:59] God blesses them gives them an increase
[27:02] that when they're when they when they
[27:04] when their parents pass away that all
[27:07] that they increased all that they
[27:08] amassed upon the earth on their life's
[27:11] journey now that that wealth that those
[27:14] inheritances passed to the children
[27:17] through the act of an inheritance amen
[27:21] and it's a blessing to the children that
[27:24] is stored up by the parents
[27:26] amen a now Abraham when he was growing
[27:29] up in the household of Terah Amen he had
[27:33] a right and expectation that he would
[27:36] receive an inheritance of his father
[27:38] amen and now but when God came and
[27:42] visited him he God gave him instructions
[27:46] I want you to leave all that behind I
[27:50] want you to reject your father's
[27:53] inheritance I want you to leave the
[27:56] comfort of your father's house I want
[27:58] you to leave all those things behind and
[28:01] I want you to go to a land that I will
[28:03] show you I have reserved a land for my
[28:08] namesake for the name of Jehovah and I
[28:11] am going to give you that as soon
[28:12] inherit
[28:13] but in order for you to receive this
[28:15] inheritance you have to leave your
[28:18] father's inheritance behind amen so so
[28:21] Abraham he he took God at His Word Amen
[28:27] he heard the word of God through the
[28:30] visitation of God and he was written in
[28:33] law and the inheritance of Jehovah was
[28:35] revealed to him and so he took God at
[28:39] His Word
[28:39] and he left the house of Terah behind he
[28:43] left his inheritance behind he left all
[28:45] of his rights behind he left everything
[28:48] behind and he went to the land that God
[28:51] had showed him
[28:53] amen amen as you know as someone was
[29:04] talking to me once about the baptism of
[29:07] the Holy Ghost and and the man was
[29:11] believed more along the lines of a
[29:13] Baptist and he said was talking about
[29:17] how when we who believe in the
[29:22] Pentecostal blessings preached the
[29:25] baptism of the Holy Ghost he says he
[29:28] said that you're saying that the blood
[29:30] of Christ is not enough and that you're
[29:33] you're saying that there's a second
[29:35] blessing that the blood of Christ didn't
[29:37] do it all and we have to go and go
[29:38] receive a second a second blessing and
[29:41] so and and when I was thinking about
[29:45] about what the man was saying to me and
[29:48] I was kind of praying in my heart Lord
[29:50] Lord how do I respond to this man you
[29:51] know because I loved it and I wanted to
[29:55] give him a right answer and so I was
[29:57] praying in my heart like Lord what do I
[29:59] say to this man you know and all sudden
[30:03] though I can't keep our mind Abraham and
[30:05] I thought in my heart well when was
[30:08] Abraham saved because really it came
[30:11] down to this man was asking well what is
[30:13] salvation he wanted to know what
[30:17] salvation was and I was like so I asked
[30:20] him I was like when was Abraham saved
[30:23] that's a great question because
[30:26] however Abraham was saved it's how I'm
[30:30] saved however Abraham saved that's the
[30:37] same way and you know first Abraham you
[30:42] know he had to be called God had to call
[30:46] him and and and when the call was made
[30:50] Abraham had to respond and Abraham he
[30:54] did respond and not only do you respond
[30:57] but he left his father's house behind
[30:59] and he first took everything amen now
[31:02] first there was the request there was
[31:05] the call but as he answered the call
[31:07] there began to be visitations
[31:10] visitations visitations and there was
[31:13] different types of visitations that
[31:15] Abraham received but let me tell you
[31:17] none of those that we can really call
[31:18] God he is Abraham was actually was
[31:21] called before the foundation of the
[31:22] world
[31:24] Amen how can you put a finger which
[31:27] visitation was it that saved Abraham how
[31:32] could you say that any of those
[31:33] visitations were salvation he was saved
[31:35] before the foundation of the world and
[31:37] God was what was revealing that to
[31:40] Abraham through each visitation that he
[31:43] showed unto him he meant
[31:52] and it is those visitations that cause
[31:55] Abraham to forsake all now let's just go
[32:00] over to Genesis chapter 14
[32:25] just 14 will read the 17th verse and it
[32:30] says now I don't know if you remember
[32:35] the story here but as Abraham had gone
[32:38] into the promised land and his he went
[32:42] with his cousin there or his nephew a
[32:45] lot and lot had gone down into Sodom and
[32:48] then lot ended up being taken captive
[32:52] amen and now when lot was taken captive
[32:56] there is something that rose up inside
[32:59] of Abraham where he had pity upon his
[33:04] nephew amen there was something that
[33:06] rose up inside and that pity was Christ
[33:09] it wasn't we would say it wasn't just a
[33:12] human pity but but but Abraham had
[33:15] received Christ as a possession as an
[33:17] inheritance amen and that inheritance
[33:20] was rising up on the inside of Abraham
[33:24] to where he had to go out and chase
[33:26] after his brother amen he was revealing
[33:29] Christ on the inside of himself they
[33:31] meant now
[33:34] Genesis chapter 14 verse 17 it says and
[33:36] the King saw it and went out to meet him
[33:39] after his return from the slaughter of
[33:41] chedorlaomer and of the Kings are with
[33:44] him in the valley Shiva which is in the
[33:46] Kings Dale and Melchizedek king of Salem
[33:49] brought forth bread and wine and he was
[33:52] the priest of the Most High God and He
[33:55] blessed him and said blessed be Abram of
[33:58] the Most High God possessor of heaven
[34:02] and earth now just a few years before
[34:06] this Abraham had been called Abram of
[34:10] Terah Abram was the son of Terah but now
[34:16] we come down to the process of time and
[34:18] how Abram was being called of the son of
[34:21] the Most High God he has now been
[34:23] transformed Burton being just as natural
[34:26] inheritance was Abram of Terah but now
[34:28] he's Abram of the Most High God
[34:30] possessor of heaven and earth something
[34:34] has happened something has changed and
[34:37] when Abraham was called now
[34:39] where abraham had to make a choice to
[34:41] forsake all let me tell you every single
[34:44] one of us heard that when we first get
[34:46] called we have to make that choice every
[34:49] single one of us has to make that choice
[34:51] to forsake oh you're never going to go
[34:54] anywhere on your Christian life's
[34:55] journey until you first come to a point
[34:58] in your life to where you accept Christ
[34:59] you say Lord where would I go what can I
[35:05] do
[35:06] Lord I I've seen enough
[35:08] i I've heard enough preaching I've seen
[35:13] I've seen you do enough I've seen enough
[35:16] upon life's journey and I lay myself
[35:18] down upon the altar and Lord I have made
[35:20] my choice
[35:21] you are my choice amen every single one
[35:24] of us has to come to that point amen
[35:30] but Abraham once he called he began to
[35:35] be changed and beginning to receive a
[35:37] new inheritance amen and he began to be
[35:40] changed he can begin to be changed amen
[35:43] now let's turn over to as I just used to
[35:47] give me a little bit patience here as we
[35:49] set this up let's go down to mark
[35:51] chapter 10 and let's read a little bit
[35:54] from the New Testament
[36:21] mark chapter 10 verse 17 we're familiar
[36:26] with the rich young ruler here and it
[36:28] says I win he was gone forth into the
[36:33] way there came one running and kneeled
[36:35] to him and asked good master what shall
[36:39] I do that I may inherit eternal life and
[36:43] Jesus said oh why call sow me good there
[36:46] is none good but but one that is God
[36:49] thou knowest the commandments do not
[36:52] commit murder do not commit adultery do
[36:54] not kill do not steal do not bear false
[36:56] witness defraud not honour thy father
[36:58] and my mother and he answer nice and
[37:01] don't master all these things I've
[37:04] observed from my youth then jesus
[37:06] beholding him loved him and said unto
[37:08] him one thing that thou lackest go thy
[37:13] way sell whatsoever thou hast give to
[37:17] the poor and thou shalt have treasure in
[37:19] heaven and then come take up the cross
[37:21] and follow me and he was sad at that
[37:25] saying and went away grief where he had
[37:27] great possessions one thing I love about
[37:31] the way Jesus ministered and the way
[37:35] Jesus still ministers is God is so able
[37:40] to reach into your heart and discern
[37:44] remember Jesus is a discerner of the
[37:46] thoughts and the intents of the heart
[37:48] amen now one thing like like at the
[37:50] Ministry of brother Branham as you watch
[37:53] their broth and the prayer lines that
[37:55] through that ministry he could reach
[37:58] down to the people's hearts and discern
[38:00] their hearts they meant now that thing
[38:02] now brother Branham is not here solace
[38:05] is on the scene but that was that was
[38:07] Christ through brother Branham amen now
[38:10] just because brother Branham was gone
[38:12] doesn't mean that that has left the
[38:14] earth that was here before brother
[38:16] Branham was here and now brother Anna's
[38:18] gone that's still here amen but that was
[38:20] a revealing of Christ again to the last
[38:24] days Church amen to show Christ again to
[38:28] this last age to bring the faith of the
[38:31] people back to what the Pentecostal
[38:33] fathers had in the
[38:35] amen what they had they had Christ amen
[38:39] now Jesus Christ was able to discern the
[38:43] heart of this man and this man had been
[38:46] trying to serve Christ he been trying to
[38:49] serve Jehovah he said I have followed
[38:51] all the laws I have done everything that
[38:54] the law is said to do but he said one
[38:56] thing that you lack you have not
[38:58] forsaken all he looked down to his
[39:05] hearts he said there's why would we be
[39:06] nice only lack one thing and to have
[39:10] that one thing that you lack identified
[39:12] to you all you have to do is follow this
[39:15] one thing and you will have eternal life
[39:18] you will have life that will never pass
[39:21] away amen you will enter into his gates
[39:24] with Thanksgiving you learnt into his
[39:26] courts with praise one of these days
[39:28] your feet will walk through those gates
[39:30] and you will enter in and you'll be the
[39:32] son or the daughter of God entering into
[39:34] his inheritance
[39:36] amen remember abraham lacked one thing
[39:39] he was in his father's house and he had
[39:42] to leave it all behind it was revealed
[39:45] unto him what he had to do amen and
[39:48] through that revelation he obeyed that
[39:51] revelation he entered into an
[39:53] inheritance he became the put the
[39:56] Abraham of the Most High God possessor
[39:58] of the heavens and the earth a man he
[40:02] used to be Abram of Terah and he had an
[40:05] expectation that you did inherit all
[40:07] that Terra had but now a few chapters
[40:10] down the road you find out how he is
[40:12] Abram of the Most High God possessor of
[40:15] the heavens and earth what an
[40:17] inheritance change he's grown up in the
[40:20] gospel Amen it's a change of an
[40:22] inheritance now this rich young ruler I
[40:25] don't know how he got rich I assumed
[40:27] that he inherited all that he had he was
[40:29] pretty young
[40:30] somehow upon his life he was given the
[40:34] fast track the fast path to success amen
[40:38] he been given a fast path to success
[40:42] something how he become very successful
[40:44] in life even given a lot something that
[40:47] a lot of people didn't have
[40:48] but here Jesus is discerning his heart
[40:51] and says you're still lacking the best
[40:53] things you have a natural inheritance on
[40:57] earth but I am trying to get over to you
[40:59] how to become a son or a daughter of God
[41:02] he was giving him a better inheritance
[41:05] but because he couldn't let this
[41:07] inheritance go
[41:08] he couldn't receive the inheritance over
[41:11] here now we in hindsight would look at
[41:14] this man's choice and think oh how
[41:16] foolish he wouldn't leave this
[41:19] inheritance behind to go receive this
[41:23] inheritance over here Jesus says go and
[41:27] sell all that you have now I want to ask
[41:29] you dodoo does all of us have to give up
[41:32] all of our natural possessions in order
[41:35] to become a Christian do we have to sell
[41:38] our house and give to the poor
[41:40] to become a Christian do we have to quit
[41:44] our job to become a Christian do we have
[41:47] to give everything up to become a
[41:48] Christian now now what now let's go down
[41:50] to there's another example in the
[41:52] Gospels another man called Zacharias
[41:54] let's let's cord him real quick it's in
[41:57] Luke chapter 19
[41:59] Zacchaeus went through a similar
[42:02] experience of the rich young ruler Luke
[42:10] 19 verse 8
[42:31] we remember the story of Zacchaeus Toey
[42:34] he was not fully a believer he was a
[42:39] rich man he wasn't so sure about this
[42:42] Jesus Christ but but there was his
[42:45] curiosity had been piqued his curiosity
[42:48] had been stirred up amen and he wanted
[42:51] to see this Jesus he'd heard so much
[42:54] about Jesus Christ he knew about Jesus
[42:57] Christ but he also knew all about what
[43:01] the scribe said about him he knew what
[43:03] the Pharisees said about him
[43:04] but he also knew what the crowd said
[43:06] about him and he just wasn't sure where
[43:09] to place this Jesus Christ in history
[43:12] where to place him in the kingdom of God
[43:14] what position does Jesus Christ have in
[43:17] the kingdom of God he did not know Amen
[43:21] and so he and he's like well I just want
[43:23] to see him I want to see him in action
[43:25] I've heard so much about him I just want
[43:27] to go say well that's a good thing to do
[43:29] amen come and see taste and see a man so
[43:34] he come down to verse 8 there he's up in
[43:38] the tree there and Jesus had looked up
[43:42] to him and says come down out of that
[43:44] tree for I must eat at your house at
[43:47] your supper at your house tonight and he
[43:49] came down he received him joyfully amen
[43:53] and Jesus and sitting there a table and
[43:56] in verse 8 Zacchaeus after he's talked
[43:59] with Jesus so much so long he catches a
[44:03] revelation of Jesus Christ
[44:05] and he stands up while he's at the meal
[44:07] and he says Lord behold the half of my
[44:11] goods I give to the poor if I've taken
[44:14] anything from any man my false
[44:16] accusation I'll restore it to him
[44:18] fourfold
[44:19] and Jesus said unto him this day
[44:21] salvation has come to this house for as
[44:24] much as he also is a son of Abraham for
[44:27] the Son of man has come to seek and save
[44:30] that which was lost
[44:34] now what took place at the supper at
[44:37] this meal is that
[44:39] sheis wasn't so sure about this Jesus
[44:42] being the messiah but after he had
[44:46] experienced him I don't know what all
[44:48] was said at that meal I have no idea
[44:50] what was taking place but he had seen
[44:53] enough he had seen enough and something
[44:57] so inspired Zacchaeus in Ulsan he stands
[45:00] up he says Lord the half that I have I
[45:05] give to the poor
[45:07] now the rich young ruler the Lord had
[45:10] told him if you give up everything
[45:15] you'll have eternal life but here's that
[45:19] Kia says I give up half and Jesus looks
[45:23] at it says eternal life has come to this
[45:25] house salvation has come to this house
[45:27] now it wasn't the act of how much they
[45:31] gave was the fact that they had forsaken
[45:34] all there was something in their in
[45:37] their own being in their soul they'll
[45:40] sudden made a switch that they came from
[45:42] being a doubter to being on the fence -
[45:47] all of a sudden they just said the
[45:49] revela it was a revelation came into
[45:51] their mind Allah aha
[45:53] I know that this Lord Jesus is the
[45:55] Christ I know that he is the Messiah I
[45:58] know that he is the son of the Living
[46:00] God and when that revelation struck
[46:03] their mind he stood up and it caused him
[46:06] to forsake all just like Abraham when
[46:11] when God appeared unto Abraham in Tara's
[46:14] house something that revelation struck
[46:17] him he says that's it I give up my
[46:20] inheritance I give it all up I give it
[46:23] up and I'm gonna follow Jehovah
[46:25] everywhere he goes I'm gonna do what
[46:28] Jehovah said to do Amen it was st. it
[46:30] was a kiss that Rev late when he was
[46:33] sitting at the meal alson that
[46:34] revelation struck his mind he said
[46:36] that's it I give it all up I am going to
[46:40] I'm gonna I'm gonna make a restoration
[46:42] for the things that I have done wrong I
[46:43] am gonna give to the poor I'm gonna make
[46:45] all my wrongs right and I'm gonna follow
[46:47] this Lord Jesus Christ
[46:49] it was the revelation made a change in
[46:52] his life when it was
[46:53] to reveal when Jesus Christ was revealed
[46:56] unto Him he changed his direction amen
[47:01] it was by the revelation of the Lord
[47:03] Jesus Christ it was by the revelation of
[47:05] Jehovah and that's how God has done it
[47:08] all throughout history the changing
[47:11] point in the people's lives came when
[47:13] Christ was revealed to them when Jehovah
[47:16] was revealed to them you can come to
[47:18] this church day-in day-out you can pay
[47:21] your tithes you can do all kinds of
[47:22] things but it will do you no good until
[47:24] Jesus Christ is revealed personally to
[47:27] you amen you yourself have to stand
[47:30] where between you and Christ alone it
[47:34] has to be you Christ revealing himself
[47:36] unto you now let's go back to win-win
[47:40] Joe when Abraham was safe they meant we
[47:43] were talking about that Abraham was say
[47:45] before the foundation of the world but
[47:47] that calling caused visitations cause
[47:51] visitations a man in God and Jehovah
[47:54] kept revealing himself into him he'd
[47:56] visit him and he revealed to him he'd
[47:58] visit to him and he'd revealed to him
[48:00] he'd visit him in he'd reveal a bit more
[48:02] to a man there kept coming revelations
[48:04] upon revelations upon revelations upon
[48:08] revelations and the same experience
[48:10] needs to come to you
[48:12] there must be revelations unto you you
[48:17] God has to be revealed to you Christ has
[48:20] to be revealed to you I mean as eyes
[48:23] tell us someone who works the other day
[48:24] I says you know the word religion scares
[48:26] me amen I just I don't understand I
[48:31] understand there's a lot of people in
[48:32] this world that are religious but but I
[48:35] have not been called so many times
[48:37] religion has to do with a doctrine you
[48:40] have to follow this set of rules here or
[48:43] this set of rules here this set of rules
[48:45] here and you take your pick of which
[48:48] particular set of doctrines you want to
[48:50] follow on and when you start following
[48:52] that said doctrines men will call you
[48:54] religious a man you can follow the
[48:57] Buddhist doctrines or the or the Hindu
[49:00] doctrines or you can follow the the
[49:02] Christian Lutheran doctrines or the or
[49:04] the Catholic doctrines or maybe there's
[49:07] you know if someone says you're
[49:08] religious it can mean a many things a
[49:10] man but God has not called me just to be
[49:13] religious God has called me to reality
[49:16] amen and I'm not here to just follow a
[49:19] set doctrines but I'm here to follow
[49:21] that which is real
[49:22] amen our reality that transcends all the
[49:26] foolishness of this world I I'm not here
[49:28] to follow one certains doctrines or one
[49:31] certains I want to follow that which is
[49:33] real amen there is a reality that
[49:36] transcends what mankind is thinking amen
[49:39] and it is a reality that it comes from
[49:42] the creator of the heavens on earth and
[49:44] that is what I have come to be amen I
[49:47] have come to this earth to be whatever
[49:49] it was that Jesus Christ had on his mind
[49:52] when he was dying upon that cross a man
[49:55] when Jesus was dying hung upon that
[49:57] cross the world didn't want him amen
[49:59] amen heaven put him down upon the earth
[50:02] the earth picked him up and put him back
[50:04] up in the heavens
[50:05] Amen they didn't want him but I have
[50:07] received him amen and whatever was that
[50:10] was in his mind that's what I am here on
[50:12] this earth to be a man and he has
[50:15] revealed himself to me and I have
[50:17] forsaken all I have forsaken all amen
[50:24] Abraham had a chance an opportunity to
[50:27] receive the inheritance of his father
[50:29] Terah but he forsook it and left it
[50:34] behind and that caused a visitation it
[50:40] caused a visitation amen
[50:46] now let's go back forward to Genesis
[50:48] again through these visitations each
[50:55] time a little bit more was revealed unto
[50:58] Abraham after Abraham had displayed
[51:11] Christ by going after his fallen brother
[51:15] it caused a visitation and that's when
[51:23] milk it he met Melchizedek the mayor of
[51:27] God's inheritance the mayor of God's
[51:29] land he was the mayor of Jerusalem the
[51:32] center of God's inheritance he meant and
[51:34] this milk his attack was God in the
[51:37] flesh amen and when he had received this
[51:42] visitation milk his neck declared the
[51:46] Abraham was no longer the son of Terah
[51:49] but he was Abram and Genesis 14 19 he
[51:53] said and he blessed him he said blessed
[51:55] be Abram not of Terah but of the Most
[51:58] High God possessor of heaven and earth
[52:01] so now a changes were made he's no
[52:04] longer a son and daughter of man but
[52:06] he's a son and daughter of God amen
[52:09] every single one of us has to come to
[52:12] that same revelation that you are no
[52:14] longer a son and daughter of mr. mrs.
[52:17] sweetie a man or a solder and daughter
[52:20] of mr. mrs. Wilgus a son or daughter mr.
[52:23] mrs. Curtis amen but you are now a son
[52:26] and a daughter of God amen you and
[52:29] because you are a son and daughter of
[52:31] God you have forsaken all inheritance of
[52:34] this world and receive the inheritance
[52:37] of up on high amen all things are yours
[52:42] you have inherited all spiritual
[52:45] blessings in Christ Jesus according to
[52:48] Ephesians 1 amen
[52:51] blessed be Abram of the Most High God
[52:53] possessor of heaven and earth and as
[52:57] soon as that happened the king of
[53:00] autumn came up to Abram and said I want
[53:03] to give you a reward for your acts upon
[53:07] the earth I want you to give our reward
[53:09] from Sodom amen and Abram in verse 21
[53:14] that's a three-day says and the king of
[53:17] Sodom said Abraham give me the persons
[53:20] and take the goods to thyself a maze
[53:24] trying to give them a reward inheritance
[53:27] because Abram had gone down and saved
[53:30] Sodom while he was saving his nephew
[53:32] amen and in verse 22 watch this he had
[53:36] an opportunity not just he had already
[53:39] forsaken the the inheritance of his
[53:42] father Terah but now here comes sought
[53:45] I'm trying to give him a new inheritance
[53:47] they meant and now he and he rejects
[53:50] that inheritance and he says and Abram
[53:52] said to the king of Sodom
[53:54] I have lifted up my hand unto the Lord
[53:57] unto Jehovah the Most High God possessor
[54:00] of heaven and earth that I will not take
[54:03] from a thread even to a shoe latchet and
[54:06] I will not take anything that is thine
[54:09] lest you should say I have made abram
[54:12] rich amen I will not take now look as
[54:18] after he'd already forsaken his father's
[54:20] inheritance
[54:21] now here comes Sodom trying to give him
[54:23] another inheritance another natural
[54:25] narrative it even so comes with us nor
[54:28] do we worry sate forsake the things of
[54:31] our parents but now all the world crowds
[54:33] around us of Hollywood and Sodom and
[54:36] Gomorrah and the joys and riches of this
[54:39] life tries to crowd around us and tries
[54:41] to make us another rich young ruler upon
[54:43] the earth
[54:44] Amen we have to forsake that we have to
[54:49] forsake all amen
[54:52] now like I said no no no in the it no
[54:55] why is it that that God told the rich
[54:58] young ruler you have to sell everything
[55:01] but Zacchaeus only had to sell half the
[55:07] answer was to get eternal life but God
[55:11] required the rich young ruler
[55:13] to get to sell everything but he was
[55:17] like but when Zacchaeus said I'm going
[55:20] to give half of what I have jesus says
[55:23] eternal life has come to this house why
[55:27] the difference because it wasn't about
[55:30] how much they gave it was about whether
[55:33] they had forsaken everything or not
[55:35] and when God perceived that Zacchaeus
[55:39] had forsaken all he had laid everything
[55:42] behind all sudden it clicked this man is
[55:45] a son of Abraham yeah and that's what
[55:50] Jesus said this day salvation has come
[55:53] to Zacchaeus house for he also is a son
[55:57] of Abraham but the rich young ruler was
[55:59] naturally a son of Abraham but when he
[56:02] wouldn't forsake all he was declaring I
[56:04] am NOT a son of Abraham even as even in
[56:09] John chapter 8 when Jesus was talking to
[56:12] the Pharisees they say we be not born of
[56:15] fornication well Abraham is our Father
[56:18] and Jesus said if you are of Abraham
[56:20] your father you would do the works of
[56:21] Abraham under they said we have one
[56:24] father even God he says if God was your
[56:27] father
[56:27] you would do with the works of Abraham
[56:29] or you do the works of God but now
[56:31] you're trying to kill me a man who has
[56:33] shown you the truth God didn't do this
[56:35] Abraham didn't do that and he says you
[56:37] are of your father the devil and they
[56:40] say oh no we can show our lineage we can
[56:42] show going all the way back he says but
[56:45] you're not doing the works therefore you
[56:47] are of your father the devil
[56:48] and so is it so with every single one of
[56:52] us God takes us to a testing point to
[56:55] see if we will forsake all or not amen
[57:00] and that's when the time comes he'll
[57:02] seal to you salvation has come to this
[57:05] house they are a son and daughter of the
[57:07] Lord Jesus Christ they are not just a
[57:10] born of of their natural parents but now
[57:13] they're a son and daughter of God amen
[57:15] as he said I think is in John chapter 1
[57:18] he says and now he came and he preached
[57:20] unto him and he gave them power to
[57:22] become sons and daughters of God
[57:26] amen now let's keep going here in
[57:29] Genesis 14 he said I have lifted up my
[57:32] hand unto the Lord the Most High God
[57:34] possessor of heaven and earth that will
[57:37] not take from you and after these things
[57:39] in John and 15 one says the Lord came
[57:43] unto Abram in a vision said fear not
[57:45] Abram I am thy shield and I exceeding
[57:48] great reward
[57:49] everything that God was now he had come
[57:53] he'd come full circle
[57:55] God was his reward but what happened it
[57:58] happened after the visitation of milk is
[58:01] a deck
[58:04] now who was milk is a deck milk his deck
[58:09] was the ministry of Jehovah to Abraham
[58:14] in the flesh
[58:15] amen he milk his addict was the mayor of
[58:20] Jerusalem in the midst of God's
[58:23] inheritance God had placed a man a body
[58:28] of flesh there that was that has the
[58:31] Bible said he had no beginning of days
[58:33] and no ending of life amen it was God in
[58:37] the flesh in Abraham's inheritance amen
[58:41] God had put his spirit in that body amen
[58:45] and he came and ministered unto Abraham
[58:48] and it says there that right after the
[58:51] ministry milk his neck that he gave a
[58:54] tithing of all let's read that in
[58:57] Genesis 14 18 and milk isn't a king of
[59:00] Salem brought forth bread and wine and
[59:03] he was the priest and the Most High God
[59:05] and He blessed him and said blessed be
[59:07] Abram of the Most High God possessor of
[59:10] heaven and earth and blessed be the Most
[59:12] High God which have delivered thine
[59:14] enemies into thy hand and he gave him
[59:18] tithes of all and at this point in the
[59:23] visitation at this this revelation is
[59:26] given to Abraham caused Abraham to pay
[59:29] his tithe to the minister God was
[59:33] ministering to - to Abraham and
[59:37] revealing to Abraham
[59:40] he was revealing to Abraham who he was
[59:45] and that when that revelation struck him
[59:47] it caused him to pay his tithing the
[59:51] revelation caused him to bring his tithe
[59:53] into that place and that is what began
[59:57] God's like I said we were appreciating
[1:00:01] tithes and offerings now that I'm
[1:00:03] finally here that was the beginning of
[1:00:09] tithing there upon the earth when the
[1:00:13] revelation were the place where the
[1:00:15] revelation was given forth amen now
[1:00:21] let's turn over to the Book of Numbers
[1:00:42] numbers chapter 18
[1:01:11] number is 18 verse or verse 20 now I
[1:01:21] remember where we are in this chapter
[1:01:27] just an overview God gave that land as
[1:01:31] an inheritance to Abraham Abraham lived
[1:01:36] in that land and gave it as an
[1:01:38] inheritance to his sons and to his son
[1:01:40] sons and his sons Sons Abraham's family
[1:01:44] in the time of Joseph was taken out of
[1:01:47] the inherit of the promised land for 400
[1:01:49] years and they were brought back into
[1:01:52] the land by Moses with a mighty hand and
[1:01:56] God is showing them this is how I want
[1:01:59] you to live in your promised land in the
[1:02:02] end your inheritance amen and so when
[1:02:05] they're coming back into the land he has
[1:02:09] to bring back the revelation this is
[1:02:12] your inheritance
[1:02:13] this land is your inheritance and I have
[1:02:16] given this land as an inheritance to the
[1:02:19] twelve sons of Jacob amen and to each of
[1:02:27] those families this land is given as an
[1:02:29] inheritance and had to go through the
[1:02:31] land he wrote in books and they said
[1:02:33] this portion of the land goes unto unto
[1:02:36] Judah this portion of the land would go
[1:02:40] into Benjamin
[1:02:41] Amen just all the sons were given their
[1:02:43] portion of land but when you come to
[1:02:46] numbers chapter 18 verse 20 and it says
[1:02:49] and the Lord spake unto Aaron thou shalt
[1:02:53] have no inheritance in their land
[1:02:56] neither shalt thou have any part among
[1:03:00] them I am thy part and ngayon heritance
[1:03:04] among the children of Israel now God has
[1:03:09] always taught the Jews that if they are
[1:03:13] not in the land of Israel that they have
[1:03:16] no part of Jehovah without them actually
[1:03:20] being in the Land of Israel that is
[1:03:23] their inheritance
[1:03:24] if they find themselves outside the land
[1:03:27] they don't even they are taught they
[1:03:29] don't even have eternal life unless they
[1:03:31] are a part of the land they have to be a
[1:03:34] part of that land that was the the
[1:03:36] teaching for generation to generation of
[1:03:39] generation
[1:03:40] amen they had to be a part of that land
[1:03:42] even as a Joseph made them swear their
[1:03:47] day in Egypt
[1:03:48] don't you bury me here in Egypt put my
[1:03:51] bones up because someday were going back
[1:03:53] to the inheritance bury me in the land
[1:03:56] bury me in the land amen and then when
[1:03:58] Jesus Christ died on the cross all of
[1:04:01] them received their inheritance when the
[1:04:04] when the earthquake shook the graves
[1:04:06] were open and there was a resurrection
[1:04:08] took place of the Old Testament Saints
[1:04:10] and they were seeing walking about the
[1:04:13] earth amen why cuz that was their
[1:04:17] inheritance it was given to him as an
[1:04:18] inheritance amen but all of them was
[1:04:21] given an inheritance a man there to
[1:04:23] enjoy that land but the sons of Aaron
[1:04:26] and the Levites were told right here you
[1:04:30] will have no inheritance in the land you
[1:04:35] know in some ways I could almost see
[1:04:36] that be disappointing you know when I
[1:04:40] was first going it like what do you mean
[1:04:42] oh we came here we came here to enjoy
[1:04:45] our joy the crops to to to do all these
[1:04:49] things to have a right to have a place
[1:04:51] where we can establish walls and
[1:04:53] boundaries and have a place upon the
[1:04:55] earth this is our house
[1:04:56] I'll pass this down on to my children my
[1:04:59] children's children and all these things
[1:05:00] but he says right there you shall have
[1:05:04] no inheritance you shall have no part
[1:05:07] among them he says I Jehovah am Naya
[1:05:11] part and nine inheritance and behold I
[1:05:17] have given the children of Levi all the
[1:05:20] tenth in Israel it's verse 21 for an
[1:05:23] inheritance he's talking about the
[1:05:25] tithing the tithing was the inheritance
[1:05:28] of the Levites for their service which
[1:05:31] they serve even in the service of the
[1:05:34] tabernacle of the congregation neither
[1:05:36] must the children of Israel henceforth
[1:05:38] Knight of the tabernacle the
[1:05:40] congregation let's say bear a sin and
[1:05:42] die but the Levites shall do the service
[1:05:45] of the tabernacle of the congregation
[1:05:47] and they shall bear the iniquity and
[1:05:49] shall be a statute forever throughout
[1:05:52] your generations among the children of
[1:05:56] Israel they shall have no inheritance
[1:05:59] but the tithes of the children of Israel
[1:06:02] and that which they offer as a heave
[1:06:05] offering unto the Lord I will give to
[1:06:08] the Levite to inherit therefore I have
[1:06:10] said unto them among the children of
[1:06:12] Israel they shall have no inheritance
[1:06:15] the Levites have to become fools for
[1:06:18] Christ a mint they have to forsake even
[1:06:22] their own inheritance among the the beat
[1:06:24] the people amen and become fools for
[1:06:27] Christ as we read there in current in
[1:06:29] Corinthians where Paul said we are weak
[1:06:32] but you are strong we are poor but you
[1:06:35] are a rich we are despised but you reign
[1:06:38] as kings we have become fools for Christ
[1:06:41] the offscouring of the earth they men
[1:06:43] while you reign as kings amen they have
[1:06:48] no inheritance but the ties were given
[1:06:51] to them by God as an inheritance the
[1:06:59] ties were not given by the people to the
[1:07:02] Levites no the ties were given but from
[1:07:06] God to the Levites as an inheritance it
[1:07:10] was just to pass through the hands of
[1:07:12] the people from the blessings that they
[1:07:15] received as an increase throughout the
[1:07:17] year so as they get as they were given
[1:07:20] an increase throughout the year of all
[1:07:22] their crops all everything that they did
[1:07:24] of their crops and of their of their
[1:07:27] hurts they would mark out a tenth of it
[1:07:30] and bring it to the Levites where the
[1:07:33] Word of God would come forth where the
[1:07:36] revelation would come forth and they
[1:07:38] would bring the tenth into the household
[1:07:40] Lord as a tithe God gave this to me and
[1:07:43] I have forsaken everything and as a
[1:07:46] token of that forsaking I bring my ties
[1:07:50] to the Levites
[1:07:52] showing that I am a son and daughter of
[1:07:54] Abraham now what was the job of the
[1:08:06] Levites God had a place in the middle of
[1:08:12] in the middle of their inheritance a
[1:08:16] place where they could go and if they
[1:08:20] had sinned if there was something wrong
[1:08:23] in their household whoever was they
[1:08:26] could bring they could bring the the
[1:08:29] sacrifice and they could pray to God and
[1:08:33] are then they say Lord and then Andy and
[1:08:35] the Levite would enter and with them
[1:08:37] with their sacrifice and in agreement
[1:08:39] with them amen and reveal Christ to them
[1:08:43] it was a point where Christ the
[1:08:45] sacrifice would be revealed to them amen
[1:08:49] let's turn over to the book of Ephesians
[1:08:56] chapter 4
[1:09:01] you all had someone asked me once
[1:09:10] it's a Christian brother I think he was
[1:09:14] a little discouraged it been a while
[1:09:18] since he had seen a move of God in his
[1:09:21] life and and he was just a little
[1:09:24] discouraged and he came to me and he
[1:09:29] said in the Old Testament if a man
[1:09:36] wanted to hear from God or if he had
[1:09:41] sinned something or he wanted healing or
[1:09:44] deliverance or anything he could just
[1:09:48] take a lamb from his flock and take it
[1:09:52] to the tabernacle door and the priest
[1:09:56] would meet him there
[1:09:58] and there in the midst of their
[1:10:00] sacrifice he could walk away and have a
[1:10:04] confidence that God has heard his prayer
[1:10:09] and the man asked me says is it just
[1:10:12] that easy in the New Testament I'll
[1:10:16] never forget that he wanted some type of
[1:10:21] assurance because in the Old Testament
[1:10:24] it was so tangible you had your lamb you
[1:10:31] had your grains you had your crops you
[1:10:32] could feel them you could touch them
[1:10:34] you could carry them bleeding you can
[1:10:37] lead them with the rope all the way to
[1:10:40] the tabernacle door you could watch them
[1:10:43] as they were sacrificed you could hear
[1:10:45] the cries of a dying as the lamb died
[1:10:47] for you in your place and he wanted a
[1:10:51] confidence is it just that easy in the
[1:10:55] New Testament and there's something
[1:10:57] about it that just cries out inside of
[1:10:59] me it's easier than that for Christ died
[1:11:05] one time for once he died one time one
[1:11:10] time he had turned into the heavens for
[1:11:11] you and he is still standing there
[1:11:14] waiting for you to cry out to him he
[1:11:17] says I am standing here waiting to make
[1:11:19] intercession for you based upon your
[1:11:21] confession amen
[1:11:27] but like Abraham it has to be revealed
[1:11:30] unto us so we can forsake all hey you
[1:11:38] know and we come into a house is the
[1:11:39] worship like this so we could gather
[1:11:44] together one place so we could hear the
[1:11:48] Word of God God has ordained a ministry
[1:11:52] and he has ordained a minute I'll take
[1:11:55] our brother Isaiah our brother Isaiah he
[1:11:59] is our pastor we chose him by revelation
[1:12:04] to be our pastor amen it was revealed
[1:12:07] unto us we had many men that came to
[1:12:10] this church that are interested in being
[1:12:12] pastors over this church but when we met
[1:12:14] brother Isaiah there was something that
[1:12:16] rose up inside us and said this is the
[1:12:19] man we want to be our pastor amen and
[1:12:22] and when he became our pastor we
[1:12:24] declared that we will that he is going
[1:12:27] to give himself over to the ministry of
[1:12:30] this body of believers
[1:12:31] amen every time we have a service he is
[1:12:34] going to get down on his knees in prayer
[1:12:36] he is gonna search the scriptures and he
[1:12:39] is going to search the mind of the Lord
[1:12:41] Jesus Christ for a message for the
[1:12:44] people amen we the people have said
[1:12:46] we're gonna come into this house we are
[1:12:48] going to repent of our sins a man we're
[1:12:52] gonna believe on the blood of the Lord
[1:12:54] Jesus Christ we're gonna keep our lives
[1:12:56] clean we're going to live our lives
[1:12:58] worthy of the gospel amen we're gonna
[1:13:01] keep our our households clean a worthy
[1:13:04] of the gospel and we're gonna come and
[1:13:05] gather into this place and we're gonna
[1:13:07] worship the Lord Jesus Christ and then
[1:13:10] we're gonna sit down and we're gonna
[1:13:12] listen as as brother Isaiah brings the
[1:13:14] Ministry of the gospel across the pulpit
[1:13:17] and what he says we're gonna believe
[1:13:19] amen
[1:13:19] we're gonna we're gonna we're gonna
[1:13:21] follow the vision that brother Isaiah
[1:13:24] has for this church amen because he is
[1:13:27] the pastor that guy's ordained for this
[1:13:29] church and with a vision that he has
[1:13:31] sort we're gonna line up with it and
[1:13:33] we're gonna go with him as we march
[1:13:36] towards heaven's door
[1:13:37] amen that's the ministry you know
[1:13:43] brother Isaiah went to college
[1:13:46] brother Isaiah was in the Air Force and
[1:13:51] he had a right to develop that career he
[1:13:57] had a natural right to develop that
[1:14:00] career as he went to college and
[1:14:03] whatever degree he would have gotten or
[1:14:05] as he went to the Air Force he had a
[1:14:08] right to to seek out that career to get
[1:14:12] that Weber pension he would have
[1:14:15] received or wherever a retirement plan
[1:14:18] he will receive from those careers or
[1:14:20] through the service in the military but
[1:14:23] there came a time where he the the Lord
[1:14:27] moved across his life amen in as Laura
[1:14:31] called him to enter into the ministry
[1:14:34] Amen I need oh he did he looked at his
[1:14:37] natural inheritance the things that he
[1:14:40] could have done with his life
[1:14:41] and he just wiped his hands of it Amen
[1:14:45] he wiped his hands of it he forsook
[1:14:47] everything he first took everything he
[1:14:50] says Lord I am going to enter into your
[1:14:52] ministry I am going to give my life over
[1:14:55] to ministering to the bride of the Lord
[1:14:57] Jesus Christ
[1:14:58] Amen I'm going to give up my life the
[1:15:01] natural inheritance that I could have
[1:15:03] had the natural riches that I could have
[1:15:05] gained I'm going to give all that up and
[1:15:07] I'm going to throw myself at the mercy
[1:15:09] of the church and I'm going to live my
[1:15:12] life at the mercy of Jehovah and of the
[1:15:15] tithing of the church amen and AEA he
[1:15:18] gave up his natural career to be a
[1:15:22] minister of the gospel to the bride of
[1:15:25] the Lord Jesus Christ what a blessing
[1:15:28] and we have been blessed by that
[1:15:31] ministry I know I have I'm not the man I
[1:15:35] was before brother Isaiah came along you
[1:15:38] know I think about it because you know
[1:15:39] me and brother Isaiah and the natural
[1:15:41] have almost nothing in common you know
[1:15:44] we are completely different on different
[1:15:47] ends of the spectrum you know in the
[1:15:50] natural
[1:15:51] but in Christ we have been so United
[1:15:54] together to become brothers and we have
[1:15:59] all things common in Christ amen and the
[1:16:02] things that I was lacking God has used
[1:16:05] brother Isaiah to fulfill the missing
[1:16:08] part of me Amen God has used our pastor
[1:16:12] to to bring me up higher amen amen and
[1:16:15] it's been in this church he's made me
[1:16:17] more than I could have been and myself
[1:16:19] who did it
[1:16:20] God did it but how did he do it through
[1:16:23] much through the local ministry through
[1:16:25] brother Isaiah there are times when I'm
[1:16:27] listening to brother Isaiah preach and
[1:16:30] I'm thinking am i the Holy Spirit is
[1:16:32] speaking directly to me and I no longer
[1:16:35] see brother Isaiah anymore but it's God
[1:16:38] speaking to me right through him I know
[1:16:40] it's the truth I've seen it in action
[1:16:42] I've had God speak directly to me
[1:16:45] there's been times where I'm watching
[1:16:47] but Isaiah preached I'm like oh my he's
[1:16:48] prophesy I don't even know if he knows
[1:16:51] it but right now he is a turning it
[1:16:53] around with a spirit and he's actually
[1:16:55] prophesying well what is it it's God
[1:17:00] gave it to us as a ministry brother
[1:17:03] Isaiah if we knew the hours that brother
[1:17:05] Isaiah spins in prayer the hours he
[1:17:08] spends reading his Bible the hours and
[1:17:10] hours he spends of listening to one or
[1:17:12] two messages every single day my he has
[1:17:16] dedicated his life to the ministry of
[1:17:19] the local Bride of Christ amen amen
[1:17:24] well god bless him for that amen but God
[1:17:27] has given our brother Isaiah the local
[1:17:31] ties as his inheritance amen now what is
[1:17:37] this ministry let's read there in
[1:17:40] Ephesians chapter 4 I had you turn there
[1:17:43] Ephesians chapter 4 says it's talking
[1:17:47] here in verse 8 is talking about Jesus
[1:17:49] Christ will read verse 8 and then we'll
[1:17:53] skip down to 11 it says wherefore he
[1:17:57] saith when he ascended up on high he led
[1:18:00] captivity captive
[1:18:04] I'm glad he did that are you glad he did
[1:18:08] that I needed that I was captive but my
[1:18:13] Messiah led captivity captive he took
[1:18:17] chains and put the chains in Chains amen
[1:18:20] he took the prison house and put the
[1:18:22] prison house in prison a man he led
[1:18:24] captivity captive and then what'd he do
[1:18:27] as he was ascending up on high he turned
[1:18:30] around he gave gifts unto men God placed
[1:18:37] His Holy Ghost in the midst of the earth
[1:18:39] not only did he give his portion of the
[1:18:42] Holy Spirit each one of us but he gave a
[1:18:45] special portion of his self to the
[1:18:47] ministry to bear the word of God amen
[1:18:53] and it says what are these gifts that he
[1:18:56] gave to men now the gift is unto you and
[1:19:04] he gave some apostles why'd he give
[1:19:07] apostles for you he gave some prophets
[1:19:12] some evangelists verse 11 and some
[1:19:15] pastors and teachers why well it's for
[1:19:18] you it's for the Bride of Christ
[1:19:22] these five offices are dedicated to the
[1:19:27] ministry to the bride of the Lord Jesus
[1:19:29] Christ
[1:19:31] for what purpose why verse 12 for the
[1:19:38] perfecting of the Saints for the work of
[1:19:41] the ministry for the edifying of the
[1:19:44] body of Christ we're supposed to have a
[1:19:49] strong ministry a blessed ministry a
[1:19:54] ministry that is dedicated to the gospel
[1:19:57] the to a ministry that is dedicated to
[1:20:01] the gospel into prayer and to the
[1:20:05] anointing until verse 13 until all of us
[1:20:13] until we all s
[1:20:16] patience of the ministry waiting until
[1:20:19] all wait until every single one not
[1:20:22] satisfied until every single one of us
[1:20:26] until we all come into the unity of the
[1:20:30] faith and the knowledge of the Son of
[1:20:33] God
[1:20:34] I don't into a perfect man unto the
[1:20:38] measure of the stature of the fullness
[1:20:40] of Christ unto the knowledge of the Son
[1:20:44] of God that means there has to be
[1:20:45] revelation Amen Christ has to be
[1:20:49] revealed to you through the ministry and
[1:20:51] that is our goal every time we stand
[1:20:54] behind this desk is that somehow through
[1:20:57] this ministry Christ might be revealed
[1:21:00] to you I am not satisfied until I feel
[1:21:03] like Christ has been revealed amen
[1:21:06] even I have people that I'm a witnessing
[1:21:08] to you right now amen and I am not
[1:21:11] satisfied until Christ is revealed that
[1:21:14] is what I state in my prayers whenever
[1:21:16] I'm ministering to someone Lord let let
[1:21:19] be revealed through me or let the
[1:21:21] revelation come through me Lord they got
[1:21:23] to see Christ amen because Christ is
[1:21:26] veiled to the unbelievers amen God is
[1:21:31] hiding behind a veil God has been hidden
[1:21:34] behind a veil and he cannot be seen
[1:21:38] remember the Greeks when they back in
[1:21:41] the time of Jesus they had all those
[1:21:43] different gods that they believed in but
[1:21:46] a few of those Greeks left Greece behind
[1:21:49] came to Jerusalem and they told the
[1:21:52] disciples we want to see Jesus we want
[1:21:56] to see this God that we've heard about
[1:21:58] this could become flesh but they
[1:22:00] couldn't see him because he was hidden
[1:22:02] behind the body of flesh they came they
[1:22:05] saw the body of Jesus Christ but they
[1:22:08] didn't actually see they couldn't see
[1:22:09] God they're trying to see God but it was
[1:22:11] veiled their eyes hid Christ from them
[1:22:15] but there's many people who saw Christ
[1:22:17] saying God was revealed to him amen the
[1:22:21] same thing has to happen to you you can
[1:22:24] come to this church day in day out day
[1:22:26] in day out you can hear the messages
[1:22:28] preached but if you never
[1:22:29] get behind the veil you'll never see
[1:22:32] Christ but there's gotta be something
[1:22:34] inside of you that you have to be like
[1:22:36] Abraham you have to say I'm leaving my
[1:22:39] inheritance behind
[1:22:41] I'm forsaking everything and I'm
[1:22:43] marching towards the revelation of
[1:22:45] Jehovah I'm marching towards the
[1:22:47] revelation of Jesus Christ and I'm not
[1:22:49] gonna be satisfied until Jesus Christ is
[1:22:52] revealed unto me amen
[1:22:54] the God gave the ministry that every
[1:22:58] time I come to church let me tell you I
[1:22:59] am expecting to have the the Christ or
[1:23:03] reveal to me through the pulpit I don't
[1:23:05] care if I like the minister or not you
[1:23:08] don't have to like the minister behind
[1:23:10] the desk you just have to draw Christ
[1:23:12] out of him amen why because here that's
[1:23:15] what you're here to do is draw Christ
[1:23:18] out of the minister he is there for you
[1:23:20] the minister is here to be broken for
[1:23:23] you we give our bodies as a sacrifice
[1:23:26] for you amen so that Christ might be
[1:23:28] minister to the people eat if it's not
[1:23:31] your style even it's not the way you
[1:23:33] like it you still have an opportunity to
[1:23:36] draw Christ from you I remember one time
[1:23:38] I was flying to Ohio to preach in Ohio
[1:23:42] and as I was waiting for my airplane I
[1:23:45] see coming up to my gate a Catholic
[1:23:48] priest and he was decked and everything
[1:23:53] you can expect a Catholic priest to wear
[1:23:55] he had this huge chain around his neck
[1:23:58] with this huge cross about this big and
[1:24:01] and he was just he had everything you
[1:24:04] can expect a Catholic priest to be he
[1:24:06] was Catholic to the core and I saw him I
[1:24:10] was like I'm sitting next to him I just
[1:24:14] know it I know I am sitting next to this
[1:24:19] man so I'm like Lord am I prepared to
[1:24:22] sit next to this man Lord if I was to
[1:24:26] open my mouth this man knows more than I
[1:24:30] could ever know what would you say to
[1:24:34] this man and so sure enough as I went
[1:24:40] down I sat in my seat and also I'm
[1:24:42] Washington's people come in and
[1:24:43] going down the aisle and sure enough my
[1:24:45] seats empty empty empty empty next to me
[1:24:48] and all sudden I see him come to the
[1:24:50] door and my seat next to me still empty
[1:24:51] he looks at his ticket he looks right
[1:24:53] above my head there at the little number
[1:24:55] above me and he comes up and he sits
[1:24:58] down right next to me and he gets out he
[1:25:03] reaches into his bag and he gets out
[1:25:05] this little book and he opens this book
[1:25:09] and he crosses himself and he opens up
[1:25:14] this book and it's a book that's written
[1:25:15] completely in Latin and he's reading in
[1:25:20] Latin line by line by line by line this
[1:25:24] man is a Catholic of Catholics and I'm
[1:25:29] praying I'm like Lord you've called me
[1:25:33] to be a minister of the gospel you've
[1:25:36] called me to you mister of the Lord
[1:25:38] Jesus Christ and I'm going to Ohio to
[1:25:41] preach your gospel but Lord if you have
[1:25:44] anything to miss or to this man I pray
[1:25:47] Lord that you would speak to me because
[1:25:48] this man is more intelligent than I can
[1:25:51] ever be and I just we started making
[1:25:56] small talk and I told him what I was
[1:25:58] intending to do in Ohio and we were both
[1:26:01] going to Ohio to preach both of us work
[1:26:04] I started talking about it and talking
[1:26:10] about different things he believed and I
[1:26:12] started talking about a little bit that
[1:26:15] I knew about a few Pope's that I knew
[1:26:17] and I had just been reading some of the
[1:26:19] history of the early popes and and so I
[1:26:22] knew someone from the 380 400 AD and it
[1:26:26] was coming in my mind and and the Lord
[1:26:29] was this actually was refreshing my
[1:26:30] memory and I was able to speak about
[1:26:32] things that normally I wouldn't be able
[1:26:33] to speak about and I was enjoying I was
[1:26:36] having a good time and any time I meet a
[1:26:40] minister of any denomination whether it
[1:26:44] be Catholic or Mormon or anywhere in
[1:26:47] between I have a right to draw Christ
[1:26:52] from that minister
[1:26:54] I believe that I have a right to draw
[1:26:59] Christ out of that Minister it's given
[1:27:01] to me
[1:27:02] any man that claims to be a minister I
[1:27:05] have a right to draw Christ from him and
[1:27:10] so I started drawing I started trying to
[1:27:14] draw you know I couldn't get anything
[1:27:15] out of them I tried and I tried and I
[1:27:20] could not get anything out of them and
[1:27:23] by the end when the plane landed he was
[1:27:26] getting angry with me and by the time I
[1:27:32] was diced we're just I just shared with
[1:27:35] him some of the scriptures and and he
[1:27:38] looked at me in the door opened and
[1:27:40] everybody took off their seatbelts and
[1:27:42] he looked at me and he smacked me on the
[1:27:45] leg and he said good luck with that
[1:27:46] and he walked off and I was like Lord I
[1:27:52] had a right to draw from this man
[1:27:56] because I had a right to draw from the
[1:27:58] ministry and let me tell you you have a
[1:28:01] right to draw from the ministry when you
[1:28:03] come into this church and you have a
[1:28:06] right and an expectation by the Lord
[1:28:09] Jesus Christ you have been endowed with
[1:28:11] certain rights to come into this church
[1:28:14] and to be perfected by the ministry amen
[1:28:17] everything that's written on that little
[1:28:19] parameter on the wall Amen you have a
[1:28:21] right to draw that you're not drawn just
[1:28:23] for me but your drawings from Christ
[1:28:26] through me amen it's Christ ministering
[1:28:30] to you it has nothing to do with me has
[1:28:32] nothing to do with my natural body amen
[1:28:35] but Christ is here to perfect you he
[1:28:37] wants you to be perfected and to be a
[1:28:40] perfect member of the Bride of the Lord
[1:28:42] Jesus Christ he wants you to have to add
[1:28:45] to your faith virtue he wants you to add
[1:28:47] your virtue knowledge temperance
[1:28:49] patience godliness brotherly kindness he
[1:28:51] wants you to believe in him so much
[1:28:54] until he is so real to you then he is
[1:28:57] more real to you than the chair that
[1:28:59] you're sitting on a man the chair that
[1:29:01] you're sitting on may not actually exist
[1:29:02] but God does and that's how I believe
[1:29:08] than God amen the job that I have the
[1:29:11] people I know may not actually exist
[1:29:12] this building may not actually be here
[1:29:15] but I know that God exists I know that
[1:29:18] God is true and when people say oh I'm
[1:29:21] sick about I know there's healing in the
[1:29:23] word I'm bound by Noah's deliverance in
[1:29:26] the word amen amen I I just I believe
[1:29:30] that way recently I was watching a video
[1:29:33] of a man playing the cello I really
[1:29:38] admired it a man because I would love to
[1:29:42] be able to play an instrument any but
[1:29:44] you know this body does not know how to
[1:29:46] play an instrument but you know I looked
[1:29:50] at that man I said that man's me because
[1:29:53] if I wanted to I could ask God to play
[1:29:56] and then when God anointed me I'd play
[1:29:59] it just as well so therefore that man
[1:30:03] might as well be me playing that
[1:30:04] instrument that man is me I believe it
[1:30:12] that way that's how my faith is like
[1:30:15] brother Branham preached a message
[1:30:17] called perfect faith he says you know I
[1:30:20] think I I see he said I have a
[1:30:23] pocketknife I may have left it at home
[1:30:28] or it may be in my pocket I'm not sure
[1:30:32] it could be sitting on my dresser but
[1:30:36] right now if I had need of it I could
[1:30:39] ask God and he would place it in my
[1:30:41] pocket even if I forgot and left it at
[1:30:43] home
[1:30:46] that's perfect faith because the Bible
[1:30:50] says whatsoever things you have need up
[1:30:52] asked for him and he shall give it to
[1:30:53] you that's how I believe now if God put
[1:30:58] that in the scriptures when you pray ask
[1:31:01] believing and he will give it to you
[1:31:04] well I believe in this gospel so much
[1:31:09] until I oh but I'm willing to become a
[1:31:11] fool in believing it because I am a fool
[1:31:15] for Christ and I just I believe in that
[1:31:18] the gospel is more real to me than this
[1:31:21] building
[1:31:21] we're sitting in I believe in God that
[1:31:25] much and we are called to have that
[1:31:27] faith and I am called to have faith in
[1:31:29] God's processes and to know that his
[1:31:31] promises are true therefore if God has a
[1:31:35] ministry to bring me to perfection for
[1:31:39] the perfecting of the saints till we all
[1:31:40] come in unity then I might as well be in
[1:31:43] unity then I might as well be perfected
[1:31:46] then I might as well have virtue I might
[1:31:49] as well have knowledge I might as well
[1:31:50] have all patience it's mine it belongs
[1:31:52] to me I'm filled with patience I'm
[1:31:55] filled with deliverance you say brother
[1:31:57] do you have it all I say I do because it
[1:32:00] exists and the Bible says all things are
[1:32:03] mine therefore I have it it's mine it
[1:32:08] belongs to me it's my inheritance I've
[1:32:10] entered into it
[1:32:11] I have forsaken my natural inheritance
[1:32:13] everything that I could have possibly
[1:32:15] gained for my parents I've left that
[1:32:17] behind all the weaknesses that my
[1:32:19] parents has handed down I've laid those
[1:32:21] down all the strengths that the genetics
[1:32:24] and my parents have given me I've laid
[1:32:26] those down and I've received the
[1:32:28] strengths of my own Heavenly parent aim
[1:32:30] I've received the strengths of Jehovah
[1:32:32] all things are mine amen amen so what I
[1:32:35] need to minister to someone and I think
[1:32:37] oh I don't know how to minister to this
[1:32:39] person I don't know how to minister to
[1:32:40] that person I say but Jesus does but
[1:32:44] jesus knows how to minister to him
[1:32:46] therefore I know how to minister to him
[1:32:48] because me and Jesus have become one
[1:32:50] we've been coming United amen
[1:32:53] I have forsaken all I be united with
[1:32:55] Christ it's been revealed to me that
[1:32:58] Christ and I are one that's why I can
[1:33:03] take communion because I know that
[1:33:06] Christ and I have become one it's been
[1:33:09] revealed to me has it been revealed to
[1:33:12] you has it been revealed to you right
[1:33:19] now if they if if Mercy Hospital called
[1:33:22] me and said we're short on surgeons we
[1:33:28] need you to report to surgery in two
[1:33:30] weeks to be our love our new surgeons
[1:33:39] you know I could do it
[1:33:43] they say brother you're taking a lot
[1:33:45] upon yourself I firmly believe that I
[1:33:51] could ask God and he gets supernaturally
[1:33:55] placed that inside of me that's how much
[1:33:59] I believe in God I believe that I know
[1:34:04] who I am
[1:34:05] I've been called to be a son or a
[1:34:07] daughter of God you know Moses may not
[1:34:11] have known how to be a deliverer but he
[1:34:13] was anointed to be a deliverer amen and
[1:34:17] so have you been anointed to be the
[1:34:19] Bride of Christ you say I may not know
[1:34:22] how to be patient I may not know how to
[1:34:23] do all these things but God has anointed
[1:34:26] you to be his bride God has anointed you
[1:34:29] to live in heavenly places in Christ
[1:34:31] Jesus he's anointed you to receive all
[1:34:34] things and he's giving you this ministry
[1:34:36] to stir up your faith until you believe
[1:34:39] they meant for the perfecting of your
[1:34:42] faith amen amen and he's given the tithe
[1:34:46] to the ministry as an inheritance amen
[1:34:55] amen we want a strong local church not a
[1:34:59] weak Church a strong Church let's turn
[1:35:03] her to Deuteronomy chapter 12 we're
[1:35:06] almost done
[1:35:31] I love this chapter this whole chapter
[1:35:34] is a beautiful chapter we're going to
[1:35:40] read quite a bit of this chapter over
[1:35:42] the next 10 or 15 minutes or so and then
[1:35:46] we'll draw down to a close it says in
[1:35:55] verse 1 these are the statutes and
[1:35:57] judgments which you shall observe to do
[1:36:00] in the land which the Lord God of thy
[1:36:02] father's giveth you to possess it all
[1:36:05] the days that you live upon the earth
[1:36:07] you shall utterly destroy all the places
[1:36:10] wherein the nations which ye shall
[1:36:12] possess serve their gods upon the high
[1:36:15] mountains upon the hills under every
[1:36:16] green tree and you shall overthrow their
[1:36:19] altars and break their pillars you shall
[1:36:21] burn their groves with fire and he hew
[1:36:24] down graven images of their gods and
[1:36:26] destroy the names of them out of that
[1:36:29] place god wide the land to be completely
[1:36:34] delivered and cleansed because he had
[1:36:37] chosen that land to give as an
[1:36:40] inheritance to the people and he wanted
[1:36:42] him to live in that land but he did not
[1:36:44] want them to live in that land polluted
[1:36:47] by the gods that lived in that land
[1:36:48] before him amen as much as Abraham was
[1:36:52] called to leave that behind and go into
[1:36:55] that land and Abraham rejected Sodom and
[1:36:59] let any way into that land amen
[1:37:01] so these so the children of Abraham had
[1:37:04] to do the exact same thing they had to
[1:37:07] forsake everything amen even the things
[1:37:11] that naturally lived in the land when
[1:37:12] they got there
[1:37:22] now let's read four through seven it
[1:37:26] says you shall not do so like nushot
[1:37:29] worship like that you should not do so
[1:37:31] unto Jehovah your God but under the
[1:37:35] place now see the inhabitants of that
[1:37:39] land worship God upon every hill and in
[1:37:42] the groves but God wanted them to go and
[1:37:45] worship in one place he says but unto
[1:37:49] the place which the Lord your God shall
[1:37:52] choose of all your tribes to put his
[1:37:54] name there even unto his habitation you
[1:37:58] shall socially seek and thither thou
[1:38:01] shalt come so you'll have to leave your
[1:38:06] house and go to his house I'm gonna read
[1:38:11] the last half of that again even unto
[1:38:13] his habitation there even show you seek
[1:38:16] and thither thou shalt come verse six
[1:38:18] and thither shall bring your burnt
[1:38:22] offerings and your sacrifices and your
[1:38:24] tithe and heave offerings of your hand
[1:38:27] and your vows and your freewill
[1:38:28] offerings and the first things of your
[1:38:30] herds and your flocks and there you
[1:38:33] shall eat before the Lord and you shall
[1:38:35] rejoice and all you put your hand unto
[1:38:37] and your households where in the Lord
[1:38:40] thy God shall that's blessed II so there
[1:38:45] was a place in the land where they had
[1:38:47] to leave their house behind and take
[1:38:50] their tithes and their offerings and go
[1:38:53] there and there they would worship the
[1:38:55] Lord rejoice in the Lord for all that
[1:38:58] God had done to them and there they'd
[1:38:59] offer their tithes and their offerings
[1:39:01] up in the Lord and they would do it with
[1:39:03] a thankful heart giving glory unto God
[1:39:05] for the things that God had done to them
[1:39:09] amen
[1:39:10] that was the pattern that God had
[1:39:12] instituted they meant let's go out to
[1:39:17] verse 10
[1:39:28] but when you go over Jordan and dwell on
[1:39:31] the land which the Lord your God has
[1:39:32] given you to inherit and when he giveth
[1:39:35] you rest from your enemies round about
[1:39:37] so it's you dwell safely
[1:39:40] he's telling there will come a time when
[1:39:42] you live comfortably in the land a mint
[1:39:44] verse 11 then there shall be a place
[1:39:49] which the Lord your God shall choose to
[1:39:53] cause his name to dwell there and a
[1:39:56] theater shall you bring all that I
[1:39:58] command you your burnt offerings and
[1:40:01] your sacrifices and your tithes and the
[1:40:04] heave offering of your hand and all your
[1:40:06] choice vows which you vow unto the Lord
[1:40:08] and he shall rejoice before the Lord
[1:40:11] your God you and your sons and your
[1:40:13] daughters and your men servants and your
[1:40:15] maidservants and the Levite that is
[1:40:17] within your gate for as much as he hath
[1:40:19] no inheritance or no part with you take
[1:40:23] heed to your snow as - stop right there
[1:40:25] I want you to leave your place behind
[1:40:28] and I want you to take your family your
[1:40:31] whole family gather them together with
[1:40:34] your tithes and offerings and go to this
[1:40:36] place and worship amen to the place
[1:40:40] where I have placed my name now when we
[1:40:43] talk about bringing your ties to the
[1:40:45] storehouse I'm not talking about this
[1:40:47] natural building I'm talking about a
[1:40:51] place where God has given you your
[1:40:53] ministry where wherever God has given
[1:40:57] you a portion of the fivefold ministry
[1:40:59] that's where you bring your tithes and
[1:41:02] your offerings - amen so you can have a
[1:41:05] ministry as as as the disciples said why
[1:41:09] should we leave the Word of God to wait
[1:41:11] tables see cumin fill the Holy Ghost to
[1:41:14] do so for we will give ourselves over
[1:41:16] we're going to forsake all and give
[1:41:18] ourselves over to the ministry to prayer
[1:41:20] and reading the Bible amen
[1:41:29] verse 13 says take heed be careful take
[1:41:36] heed to thyself that thou offer not thy
[1:41:39] burnt offering in every place at thou
[1:41:42] seest but only but in the place which
[1:41:47] the Lord shall choose and one of the
[1:41:50] tribes there thou shall offer like burnt
[1:41:53] offerings and there they shall do all
[1:41:56] that I command thee amen one specific
[1:42:01] place not talking about the building I'm
[1:42:04] talking about where God places the
[1:42:06] ministry amen
[1:42:11] where the where the people are gathered
[1:42:13] together
[1:42:13] Paul said forsake not the assembling
[1:42:15] together together all the more as you
[1:42:19] see the Day approaching amen bring it
[1:42:25] all into one place verse 17 he says thou
[1:42:32] mayst not eat within thy gates that's
[1:42:35] your house the tithe of thy corn or if I
[1:42:39] wine or the oil or the first things that
[1:42:41] I heard so tithe of thy flock nor of any
[1:42:44] of the vows that bow us nor of thy free
[1:42:47] will offerings or heave offering of thy
[1:42:49] hand but thou must eat them before the
[1:42:54] LORD thy God in the place which the LORD
[1:42:57] thy God shall choose thou and thy son
[1:43:00] and my daughter and my manservant and I
[1:43:03] made sir and the Levite does within thy
[1:43:05] gates and now shalt rejoice before the
[1:43:08] Lord thy God and all that thou puttest
[1:43:10] thy hand too and now shall take heed be
[1:43:14] careful to thyself verse 19 be careful
[1:43:20] take heed to thyself but thou forsake
[1:43:23] not the Levite as long as thou liveth
[1:43:27] upon the earth why was God so careful
[1:43:30] about that because the Levites were the
[1:43:33] ones that would handle the sacrifice
[1:43:35] that would manifest the sacrifice to the
[1:43:38] people amen and he and they were come
[1:43:42] manded not taking inheritance upon the
[1:43:44] amongst the people but to forsake
[1:43:47] everything and live their lives
[1:43:49] dedicated to the sacrifice and so is the
[1:43:54] New Testament church the ministry the
[1:43:56] fivefold ministry is to dedicate
[1:43:58] themselves to the ministry to the
[1:44:02] ministry of the sacrifice to the
[1:44:05] Ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ I mean
[1:44:07] so we can have a strong Ministry of
[1:44:09] people that are dedicated to bring the
[1:44:11] Ministry of Christ to the people amen
[1:44:14] and you shall not eat of your tithe or
[1:44:17] use your tithe to go over to McDonald's
[1:44:19] or to pay your phone bill or your
[1:44:21] internet bill but you bring it to the
[1:44:23] place where you worship and bring your
[1:44:26] ties there to the storehouse of the Lord
[1:44:30] amen he said be careful and how you do
[1:44:33] it Amen we want a strong local church
[1:44:37] where the ministry has the time and the
[1:44:41] effort amen to dedicate themselves to
[1:44:44] the ministry of the people those
[1:44:48] brothers I can testify you the brother
[1:44:50] Isaiah probably prays more than any man
[1:44:52] I know he has dedicated himself to the
[1:44:55] ministry amen he's decade himself to the
[1:45:00] ministry
[1:45:09] let's um I said stop there but let's
[1:45:12] turn one more let's remember to Malachi
[1:45:13] chapter 3
[1:45:32] we have to have a place where Christ is
[1:45:35] revealed I think about that too the
[1:45:37] other day we need a place in this town
[1:45:42] to bring the unbelievers to a mint we
[1:45:47] need a place to where we do art we all
[1:45:50] have our part in the ministry we all
[1:45:52] have our part to go out unto the hedges
[1:45:56] and the highways and the byways to
[1:45:58] preach Christ to the people to reveal
[1:46:00] Christ to the people but it comes to a
[1:46:04] time where they also have to come and
[1:46:06] worship God to have a place where would
[1:46:11] we bring them we have to have a place to
[1:46:14] bring them to come and worship with us
[1:46:17] amen and that place should it be a place
[1:46:20] there's worthy amen that's why we that's
[1:46:23] why we give honor to this place it seems
[1:46:25] so weird that such a supernatural play
[1:46:28] people will give honor to a natural
[1:46:30] building but yet this is the place that
[1:46:34] we want to be a clean place a place
[1:46:35] where people can can get away from the
[1:46:39] things of the world and meet God a place
[1:46:42] that is clean comfortable as all the
[1:46:46] things you know the instruments the
[1:46:48] bills are paid placed where there are no
[1:46:52] distractions amen
[1:46:55] so the so the atmosphere could be a
[1:46:58] place where people can be born again
[1:47:00] amen
[1:47:02] now in Malachi chapter 3 let's read from
[1:47:07] verse 8 there says will it's almost
[1:47:11] seems like a silly question
[1:47:12] now kai 3:8 but says will a man Rob God
[1:47:18] that doesn't even seem possible
[1:47:22] how can people steal from God
[1:47:28] it doesn't seem like it even be possible
[1:47:31] for a man to do that
[1:47:37] you have robbed me he says but you say
[1:47:41] wherein have we robbed thee
[1:47:44] he says entice and offerings he says you
[1:47:49] are cursed with a curse for you have
[1:47:51] robbed me even this whole nation
[1:47:53] he says bringing all the tithes into the
[1:47:56] storehouse that there might be meat in
[1:47:59] mine house and prove me now herewith
[1:48:01] saying Lord of Hosts if I will not open
[1:48:04] up to you the windows of heaven and pour
[1:48:06] you out a blessing that there shall not
[1:48:10] be room enough to receive it well I
[1:48:13] sound pretty good that the heavens would
[1:48:16] be open and he pour out a blessing and
[1:48:18] look at the next verse and after that he
[1:48:22] says I will rebuke the Devourer for your
[1:48:26] sakes now we believe in a ministry where
[1:48:31] Jesus Christ said the Spirit of the Lord
[1:48:33] God is upon me because he has anointed
[1:48:36] me to preach the gospel to the poor he
[1:48:38] has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted
[1:48:41] to preach deliverance to them that are
[1:48:43] bound healing Joe's that are captive
[1:48:45] delivers to them that are bruised
[1:48:47] bruised
[1:48:49] peace to those there - served amen
[1:48:51] we believe in that ministry amen but if
[1:48:55] we if but if we don't bring our tithes
[1:48:59] and the offerings God says he will not
[1:49:01] rebuke the Devourer for our sakes then
[1:49:04] how can we say that we believe in that
[1:49:06] type of a ministry where all things are
[1:49:09] possible when the devourer is circling
[1:49:11] our camps amen but he says even as
[1:49:15] Brandon said no church service is a true
[1:49:17] church service tolet I as an offering
[1:49:19] has been taken up a mint it's got to be
[1:49:23] it's part of the part of the true
[1:49:26] service is to where men and women they
[1:49:30] have dedicated themselves unto the Lord
[1:49:32] Jesus Christ
[1:49:33] they ain't sure into one place they've
[1:49:38] prepared themselves beforehand they've
[1:49:41] repented of their sins they come to
[1:49:43] church a little bit early and they quiet
[1:49:45] themselves in prayer and they say Lord
[1:49:48] if I've done anything wrong
[1:49:50] give me lore if I've done anything wrong
[1:49:52] wash me Lord I'm coming into the Circe
[1:49:56] now strengthen me Lord Lord when we when
[1:50:00] the worship service starts Lord I want
[1:50:02] to praise you with a clean heart I want
[1:50:05] to enter into your gates with
[1:50:06] Thanksgiving I want to enter into your
[1:50:08] courts with praise and I want to do it
[1:50:10] with clean hands and a clean heart
[1:50:12] amen and then when the minister gets up
[1:50:15] behind the pulpit Lord you are the God
[1:50:17] that is searching my heart right now as
[1:50:19] I pray and Lord as you are searching my
[1:50:21] heart if there is anything wrong inside
[1:50:24] of me lord I pray that you would use
[1:50:26] that minister to dive down into the
[1:50:29] gospel and bring it out a manta and to
[1:50:33] preach the gospel and reveal unto me
[1:50:35] that if there's some doing something
[1:50:37] wrong show me Lord that I might live a
[1:50:40] little bit more better a little more
[1:50:42] more perfectly upon life's way a man
[1:50:44] still I might be more and more perfect I
[1:50:46] might come to the perfection of saints
[1:50:48] amen
[1:50:49] a little bit closer to Christ and so I
[1:50:52] might become to the unity of the faith
[1:50:54] where all our faith is united together
[1:50:57] and we're all in one Accord believing
[1:51:00] that all things are possible that's a
[1:51:03] church service let me tell you brother
[1:51:07] Graham said that every true church
[1:51:10] should have a book of Acts written
[1:51:11] behind it if it's a true church it needs
[1:51:15] to be writing a book of Acts behind it I
[1:51:18] believe that I believe that bring me
[1:51:22] your testimonies tell me about the book
[1:51:25] of Acts behind your life tell me about
[1:51:27] how God is leading you day-in day-out
[1:51:29] tell me about how God is leading you to
[1:51:32] be a minister of the gospel tell me
[1:51:34] about how the Holy Spirit and you have
[1:51:35] joined together in partnership amen to
[1:51:38] bring deliverance to a lost and dying
[1:51:40] world to how you are now the comforter
[1:51:43] the comforter that God promised to the
[1:51:45] people Amen Jesus Christ said I came and
[1:51:48] I died for all people say Amen I came
[1:51:51] and I died for the entire world
[1:51:53] amen but the entire world don't know yet
[1:51:55] until you tell a man until you reveal to
[1:51:59] them Christ crucified amen and we ought
[1:52:02] to have a place to bring
[1:52:04] them so they can also come and be
[1:52:06] strengthened a man in that place is made
[1:52:08] strong through the ties and the
[1:52:10] offerings amen
[1:52:12] a ministry that doesn't have to worry
[1:52:14] about where it's gonna get his next meal
[1:52:16] from if it's gonna be able to make its
[1:52:18] house payment or not but a strong
[1:52:20] ministry that has dedicated itself to
[1:52:23] prayer and reading the gospel and the 19
[1:52:26] of this last day a man knows where the
[1:52:29] Holy Spirit wants to go day-in day-out
[1:52:31] he doesn't have to worry about this or
[1:52:33] worry about that but he's dedicated his
[1:52:35] life to the gospel sake and his natural
[1:52:39] needs are given to him as an inheritance
[1:52:41] and when you don't give the tithes and
[1:52:43] offerings you Rob God how is that
[1:52:48] possible because it's not you that gives
[1:52:51] your ties God already gave your tithing
[1:52:57] to the ministry and when you withhold it
[1:53:04] then you are robbing God why because God
[1:53:08] gave them an inheritance of the tithing
[1:53:12] and so the tithing is an inheritance
[1:53:17] from their father
[1:53:20] to the fivefold ministry and but it goes
[1:53:24] through your hands he blesses you upon
[1:53:27] your life's journey
[1:53:28] he gives the increase a man as he gives
[1:53:32] you your increase upon the earth and you
[1:53:34] mark the 10th of it oh that increase and
[1:53:37] you bring it to the house of the Lord in
[1:53:40] worship and praise and rejoicing with
[1:53:44] your children your children's children
[1:53:45] and your sons and your daughter's your
[1:53:47] husband your spouse and you say we're
[1:53:49] going to the house of the Lord today
[1:53:51] we're going to worship we're going to
[1:53:54] praise or going to give our tithes and
[1:53:56] our offerings unto the Lord and we're
[1:53:58] going to do it with our joyful heart and
[1:53:59] then we're going to hear from the
[1:54:01] ministry we're going to be perfected and
[1:54:03] we're going to be perfected in the
[1:54:05] Saints amen and we're going to join to
[1:54:07] ourselves together in the unity of the
[1:54:09] faith and we're going to walk out of the
[1:54:11] door a little bit closer to the Lord
[1:54:12] amen
[1:54:13] there's a church service for you a man I
[1:54:17] believe it's possible
[1:54:18] it's mine a church services mine it
[1:54:21] belongs to me as an inheritance and when
[1:54:23] I part those curtains I come in
[1:54:25] expectation because all those things are
[1:54:28] mine they belong to me
[1:54:30] I'm not going outside of this room
[1:54:32] without becoming a little bit closer to
[1:54:34] Christ amen I'm not leaving this room
[1:54:36] without becoming a little bit closer to
[1:54:38] Jesus Christ and I'm not leaving this
[1:54:40] room without a revelation of Jesus
[1:54:42] Christ because it's given to me as an
[1:54:44] inheritance amen amen but God said you
[1:54:49] are robbing God when you withhold your
[1:54:51] tithes and offerings because I already
[1:54:53] gave it to the ministry as an
[1:54:54] inheritance and when you hold it back
[1:54:58] then you were robbing God because it
[1:55:00] wasn't yours to begin with God gave it
[1:55:02] to you the hundred percent and he asked
[1:55:06] you to take the tenth of it
[1:55:07] and pass it right on down to the
[1:55:10] ministry amen
[1:55:13] so if God has given you a visitation
[1:55:18] like Abraham does if God has given you a
[1:55:23] visitation and revealed himself to you
[1:55:26] then you are given a church service to
[1:55:30] worship and praise Him with me that's
[1:55:33] part of the visitation Abraham was given
[1:55:36] a visitation he was visited there in
[1:55:40] Earth and told come out he was visited
[1:55:43] there in in in in the promised land
[1:55:46] saying I am giving you this whole land
[1:55:47] he's given a promise he was visited
[1:55:50] again by Melchizedek and said and said
[1:55:53] that I have given you you are now a son
[1:55:56] and daughter of God and you are now
[1:55:58] possessor of heavens and earth and
[1:56:00] Abraham responded to revelation by
[1:56:03] giving ties and so now we as sons and
[1:56:06] daughters of Abraham we are identified
[1:56:08] because we've been called out of the
[1:56:10] world
[1:56:10] we've forsaken everything we've gone
[1:56:13] into this gospel way amen we've been
[1:56:16] receiving visitation after visitation
[1:56:18] Christ in this last day has been
[1:56:20] revealed to us we know who he is we know
[1:56:23] what he stands for
[1:56:24] we know that all things are possible and
[1:56:27] we've responded and we've proven that we
[1:56:29] are sons and daughters of Abraham by
[1:56:31] coming into this
[1:56:32] Church and having a full church service
[1:56:33] and part of that is paying our tithes
[1:56:35] and offerings unto Jehovah paying our
[1:56:38] tithes and offerings to the Lord Jesus
[1:56:39] Christ
[1:56:40] we're testifying that we are sons and
[1:56:41] daughters of the Living God sons and
[1:56:44] daughters of Abraham and heirs according
[1:56:46] to the promise and we are possessors of
[1:56:49] all things amen and he is rebuking the
[1:56:53] Devourer for our sakes amen I believe
[1:56:56] that so if the Devourer is in your life
[1:57:00] right now if you look at your household
[1:57:02] and you see the works of the Devourer in
[1:57:05] your household
[1:57:06] he will rebuke it for you if you're
[1:57:11] being obedient to the Word of God amen
[1:57:14] so identify those areas in your
[1:57:17] household well with your maidservants
[1:57:20] with your man's service with your sons
[1:57:22] with your daughters or whoever it is
[1:57:24] identifies the areas of your household
[1:57:26] where the devourer is working and say
[1:57:30] let us go to the house of the Lord let
[1:57:33] us go to the place of God's deliverance
[1:57:34] let us play go to the place where God
[1:57:37] has chosen to place his name to place
[1:57:40] his ministry we're gonna go there we're
[1:57:42] gonna worship the Lord we're gonna
[1:57:43] praise his God we're gonna bring our
[1:57:45] tithes and our offerings we're gonna
[1:57:47] bring our sons and daughters we're gonna
[1:57:49] worship God and He will rebuke the
[1:57:51] Devourer for our sakes and we will be
[1:57:53] delivered and we will be saved
[1:57:56] amen and we will have a shirt or a house
[1:57:59] that has the peace of God that passes
[1:58:02] all understanding do you believe it's
[1:58:05] possible like I said it like the man
[1:58:08] with the cello that man might as well be
[1:58:10] me because it exists and it's possible
[1:58:13] and all things are mine therefore it
[1:58:15] might as well be me therefore it is me
[1:58:17] amen if there is a possibility of a
[1:58:20] household or the devourers are buked or
[1:58:23] the sicker may eat well amen and people
[1:58:25] are living in you at you as Christ Jesus
[1:58:27] then it might as well be my household
[1:58:30] because it's possible and it might as
[1:58:33] well be your household if you can enter
[1:58:34] into that same faith and claim those
[1:58:36] things as yours amen amen let's just
[1:58:40] close right there Amen let's just stand
[1:58:48] we've been given an inheritance and that
[1:58:52] inheritance is perfection that heritance
[1:58:56] is Christ that inheritance is God
[1:59:00] himself he isn't our inheritance a man
[1:59:04] coming to the house of the Lord let
[1:59:07] receive it lay all those things behind
[1:59:09] don't be like the rich young ruler but
[1:59:13] of a true and honest heart forsake all
[1:59:16] he has an inheritance for you to give
[1:59:20] you all things amen amen you can
[1:59:23] experience it amen amen brother if you'd
[1:59:27] come let's just bow our heads and word
[1:59:30] prayer
[1:59:35] Heavenly Father long message
[1:59:40] maybe I may have tired the people out a
[1:59:42] little bit
[1:59:44] forgive me Lord my dazing wrong the Lord
[1:59:49] you know my heart Lord and my desire
[1:59:52] father is that the people would hear
[1:59:55] from you that they would receive your
[2:00:00] revelation and so lower we give
[2:00:02] ourselves to you right now in the name
[2:00:04] of the Lord Jesus Christ Lord we
[2:00:07] dedicate our lives again once more unto
[2:00:09] you Lords we decide we don't want to be
[2:00:12] like the rich young ruler Lord who
[2:00:16] looked you in the face he looked you in
[2:00:21] the face but he just couldn't forsake
[2:00:23] all he didn't know that there was a
[2:00:25] blessing in it the Lord Zacchaeus was
[2:00:29] not like that Zacchaeus saw you looked
[2:00:33] at you in the face he caught that
[2:00:35] revelation if I leave my inheritance
[2:00:38] behind my natural heritage and I receive
[2:00:43] Christ
[2:00:45] I'll receive a blessing that yours
[2:00:47] itself cannot contain they said Lawrence
[2:00:50] I've done everything wrong I'll make it
[2:00:53] right if I've stolen anything I'll
[2:00:57] restore it four times over the half that
[2:00:59] I have I'll give to the poor whatever
[2:01:02] you want Lord everything I own is yours
[2:01:05] I give it to you I am yours and
[2:01:09] Zacchaeus placed himself upon the altar
[2:01:13] and so do we have to do we have to place
[2:01:16] ourselves upon the altar and force a
[2:01:20] carrot and come to the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:01:23] Here I am Lord I gave it my all to you I
[2:01:28] give up my own natural be my own
[2:01:31] unnatural thoughts the Lord I know that
