[18:36] course forgive us Lord of anything we
[18:39] may have said or done cleanse us from
[18:42] all unrighteousness Lord that you would
[18:44] have
[18:46] Supreme
[18:48] preeminence in our lives Lord in Jesus
[18:51] Christ's name we pray amen you may be
[18:56] seated amen I trust you come to have a
[18:59] great time in the Lord amen always know
[19:02] that when you come to the house of God
[19:05] uh you come to have a
[19:07] feast right it's not something where uh
[19:11] you know one thing about a a feast this
[19:13] one is that the table has already been
[19:17] spread amen and all you've got to do is
[19:19] come and Dy
[19:26] amen We Know by the grace of God that we
[19:29] are in a
[19:30] time uh where we must persevere amen I
[19:34] find out and I'm going to tell you
[19:36] something that you might be aware of and
[19:38] you may not be but there's a great
[19:40] cooling off Lord and I don't know
[19:44] whether it's a cooling or dying but I
[19:47] find out that among uh those of us who
[19:50] claim to be the message I think right
[19:53] now as I have gone from one Church to
[19:56] the other I have found amen that people
[20:00] seem to be losing their strength or or
[20:05] or their Joy oh Lord their worship uh
[20:08] you know and I just believe that if
[20:11] you're going to do something you ought
[20:13] to give it 100%
[20:16] amen ain't no use in just playing with
[20:20] God you might as well just do it hard
[20:24] wholeheartedly or or not at all amen I I
[20:27] just believe by the grace of God that
[20:30] people have confused what worship really
[20:34] is and and I find out that that's why
[20:37] they don't have no strength because the
[20:40] Bible said he inhabits the praise of his
[20:42] people amen and as I said before I left
[20:45] here amen that that when you come and
[20:48] you find that people don't have joy is
[20:50] because they haven't been in the
[20:51] presence of God Amen the Bible said in
[20:54] the presence of the Lord there is
[20:57] fullness of joy Jo amen Joy is not being
[21:01] happy no amen Joy is is something like
[21:05] Jesus described a
[21:08] well a well of water an aan well
[21:12] springing up amen it is something that
[21:15] can't be held down or held back y'all
[21:19] hear what I'm saying it is something
[21:21] that automatically comes up out of you
[21:24] without an effort amen
[21:29] amen now you might as well you want to
[21:32] put on your seat belts or you want to
[21:33] loose them however you want to do it but
[21:36] here we are today and I find out that if
[21:39] we don't have joy and that's not my
[21:42] subject tonight I'm working with joy
[21:45] because I find out amen that Christians
[21:48] are some of the most saddest people oh
[21:51] Lord in the world and it's it's not
[21:54] supposed to be that way amen it's only
[21:57] because you and I are not going to the
[22:00] god of
[22:02] Joy hello if we don't have peace at mind
[22:06] is because we did not go to get it amen
[22:10] because the Bible says if we keep our
[22:12] minds stead on him he will grant us
[22:15] perfect peace so we can't blame God for
[22:19] our situations amen now remember I said
[22:22] just a couple of messages ago your
[22:26] thoughts are the thing
[22:29] that brought you here in other words
[22:32] wherever you are in your life today is
[22:35] because of what you think of
[22:39] yourself come on somebody it doesn't
[22:42] matter what you think of
[22:45] yourself is what you are
[22:49] today if you are a failure because you
[22:52] have allowed your mind to convince you
[22:55] amen that you are a failure
[22:59] amen if you're going to be
[23:01] victorious you must take the thoughts of
[23:04] God Amen that's it it is what God thinks
[23:08] about you and not what you think about
[23:10] you
[23:12] amenl y'all hear what I'm saying if we
[23:15] would take the thoughts of God on what
[23:18] God thinks about us hallelujah and what
[23:21] he has declared by his word we who we
[23:24] are oh my we'll be the happiest people
[23:27] in the world
[23:29] but we have allowed Satan's
[23:32] gospel his poison in our
[23:36] minds
[23:37] Hallelujah his poison in our minds have
[23:41] caused us to be sad down depress you
[23:45] name it it is what you
[23:50] received remember your mind is a wound
[23:54] and you can allow your mind to receive
[23:56] positive seeds or negative negative
[23:58] seeds come on somebody hopefully this
[24:01] morning we will allow God to implant
[24:05] some perfect positive
[24:08] seeds in our
[24:10] minds I'm not just talking about in your
[24:13] head I'm talking about your heart's
[24:18] mind you've been chosen for this time am
[24:22] not to be defeated you have been chosen
[24:25] to be more than a conqueror now I don't
[24:28] I know about you I don't care how many
[24:30] mistakes I make what it looks like
[24:33] because God is not allowing me to get to
[24:36] heaven on my
[24:38] righteousness I am getting to heaven on
[24:41] the righteousness of God Jesus Christ
[24:44] and my life is
[24:45] [Applause]
[24:47] hid in him now it doesn't mean that
[24:52] we're going to go out and do whatever we
[24:53] want to do and expect to go to heaven
[24:56] but those Christians true Christians
[24:58] don't mean to make
[25:00] mistakes and immediately after they make
[25:03] them they make them
[25:05] right amen come on somebody turn with me
[25:08] to Psalms 143 and9 I I I don't want to
[25:11] take too much time this morning but I I
[25:14] want you to see by the grace of God uh
[25:16] uh what what the remedy is here we hear
[25:21] Jesus Christ is a double cure
[25:29] now I'm telling you something because
[25:31] the pressure that we are now
[25:33] experiencing will not get easier sir as
[25:37] we approach the coming of the Lord it is
[25:40] going to get greater amen y'all hear
[25:44] what I'm
[25:45] saying let me say it again so so I can
[25:47] get at least more amens because if the
[25:51] amen is in you you can amen the word if
[25:54] it's
[25:55] true the pressure in this time is not
[26:00] going to get lighter amen it is going to
[26:03] get greater
[26:06] amen now you the how can I say it the
[26:11] Bible says amen that you
[26:15] are the cream of the
[26:18] crop amen he in other words let me put
[26:21] it like he said it he saved the best for
[26:23] last
[26:24] amen if you were not able to penetrate a
[26:28] make it through this age God would have
[26:30] chosen you to be in some other
[26:33] age but because he knew you could handle
[26:36] this age he put you in this age Lord to
[26:41] be an overcomer
[26:43] amen oh come on somebody Psalms 143 and
[26:48] I'm glad to be in this age amen
[26:51] hallelujah I wouldn't have made it in
[26:53] the age amen with the knives and the
[26:55] swords
[27:01] yes I'm glad to be in this
[27:05] age Hallelujah come on somebody amen
[27:10] Psalms 143 and9 it says Deliver Me Oh
[27:14] Lord from my
[27:17] enemies I flee unto thee to hide me see
[27:23] I don't have no other Hiding Place from
[27:26] my enemies he's the only only one that I
[27:29] can go to and be hidden
[27:33] am Jesus Christ is the only one amen
[27:37] that I can run to hide me in the rock or
[27:42] in the Cliffs of the rock until the
[27:44] storm of Wrath be pass amen amen oh
[27:54] my is that all right now we look at this
[27:57] thing and what brother
[27:59] Brooks you know our shelter is in the he
[28:02] is our shelter in the time of storm but
[28:06] my subject this morning is something
[28:09] that you and I should know the Lord he
[28:13] is God
[28:16] Amen that's one thing that God is going
[28:18] to bring to you he is God I guarantee
[28:21] you everybody in hell can tell you that
[28:26] God is God Amen
[28:30] yes sir I don't care if they believed in
[28:32] Buddha I don't care if they believed in
[28:34] Allah hello I don't care if they
[28:36] believed in all these other things I can
[28:39] truly say to you everybody in
[28:43] hell knows that Jesus Christ is God
[28:47] Amen he made sure even in the anian day
[28:52] when he when he came down Jesus himself
[28:55] after the resurrection amen or during
[28:58] the during his death let put it this way
[29:00] I don't want to get ahead of myself the
[29:02] Bible said he descended into hell that's
[29:05] right and he preach to those souls in
[29:07] prison why because he wanted them to
[29:10] know he was God Amen
[29:14] Hallelujah he went down into the low
[29:16] region of hell and he said listen I'm
[29:19] the man you
[29:20] rejected amen it wasn't Noah you
[29:24] rejected I'm the one oh Lord hallelujah
[29:28] it wasn't Moses you rejected I'm the one
[29:32] amen see they were just my mouthpieces
[29:35] amen but I'm the one that preached to
[29:39] you by way of these vessels come on
[29:41] somebody and they knew without a Shadow
[29:45] of Doubt like I said everybody in hell
[29:47] you know knows Jesus Christ is God
[29:51] except a lot of
[29:57] believers hello so many Christians don't
[30:00] really know oh you believe it but I say
[30:04] no
[30:05] experience hello experience amen that he
[30:10] is God hallelujah if we could understand
[30:14] that he is God it'll make your whole
[30:17] world different amen it'll change you
[30:20] it'll transform you amen from what you
[30:23] are now to what his purpose is for you
[30:26] amen now that's the Point that's where
[30:28] we're going and my my theme if I was to
[30:31] have a theme would be breaking from
[30:34] under the
[30:38] pressure cuz all of us are under
[30:40] pressure somewhere somehow but you can't
[30:43] allow that pressure to remain amen it is
[30:47] there for you to break through
[30:51] amen and to be
[30:54] seen of who you really are amen coming
[30:58] from the message we have seen his star
[31:01] the prophet of God says darker it is the
[31:05] better the light
[31:07] shines sometimes just a small light
[31:10] where there's much light is not
[31:13] noticed but the darker it gets that
[31:17] small light was shine that much stronger
[31:21] am and remember that there's no Darkness
[31:25] can exist in the presence of light amen
[31:30] light is so much more powerful than
[31:33] Darkness let me put it hey if you can't
[31:36] get that something's wrong with you
[31:38] light is so much more powerful than
[31:43] Darkness it cannot stand in his presence
[31:46] amen amen hallelujah so if you are
[31:50] allowing the light of God to shine
[31:53] through you it makes you a conqueror of
[31:57] all all
[31:59] Darkness huh hallelujah oh come on
[32:04] somebody light is so much more powerful
[32:07] than Darkness until it cannot stand in
[32:10] his presence Darkness cannot stand when
[32:14] the Sun starts to shine because the sun
[32:17] is so much greater the sunlight that is
[32:21] just pressing the darkness out and it's
[32:25] no more and this Dark World some day is
[32:28] going to turn to all light amen when
[32:33] Jesus Christ the son of righteousness
[32:36] shall come again amen then we'll have no
[32:39] more Darkness amen until that time just
[32:43] as we look out at night time and see the

[33:01] is shining and the moon has nothing in
[33:04] between it the Sun and the Moon amen
[33:08] there's nothing between the moon is
[33:10] going to shine Amen in other words it
[33:13] would become
[33:15] visible and in the absence of the Sun
[33:17] the moon reflects the light of the Sun
[33:21] to the Earth giving it a lesser light
[33:24] that we can see how to get around by the
[33:28] Moonlight until the sun shine rises
[33:30] again amen now here what oh come on
[33:33] somebody you and I must recognize if
[33:37] that moon is our type we have a job to
[33:40] do

[1:11:20] prideful that we are so ashamed of him
[1:11:24] and and and and we don't even know
[1:11:27] it now that's blind when you are ashamed
[1:11:31] of God and you don't know it you say
[1:11:33] well what do you mean just a little
[1:11:34] simple test when God say jump you you
[1:11:37] look around before you
[1:11:39] jump or God said raise your hand and you
[1:11:42] look around to see who's looking first
[1:11:44] you're ashamed you want to make sure

[1:12:08] Satan to to do their minds and he grieve
[1:12:11] the Holy Ghost because perhaps the
