[50:39] you see each and every hand that's
[50:41] raised
[50:42] may you go and attend to each and every
[50:45] one oh God
[50:47] because that's what you do
[50:50] as we are opening your word Lord
[50:52] pray oh God that you give utterance unto
[50:55] it
[50:57] any man can open the word and read it on
[51:00] that meaning I said but it's only your
[51:03] spirit that gives life
[51:06] I pray oh God that you Quicken this word
[51:09] please
[51:12] speak through the speakers
[51:19] at the end of the service say God spoke
[51:23] to us and I found yourself Reasons I'm
[51:25] sure our hearts did burn within us
[51:29] in your Mighty son's name Jesus Christ
[51:34] hallelujah amen even just look at your
[51:37] neighbor and say are you grateful to be
[51:39] in the house of the Lord this morning
[51:44] I mean it's good to see each and
[51:46] everyone was able to make it a man
[51:49] whilst we are standing let us know
[51:51] our Bible to the Book of Leviticus
[51:57] Leviticus chapter 25 and verse 8.
[52:06] Leviticus chapter 25 and verse 8.
[52:12] the Bible says and thou shalt number
[52:14] seven sabbaths of years unto thee seven
[52:17] times seven years
[52:21] and the space of the seven sabbaths of
[52:23] years shall be unto thee forty and nine
[52:25] years
[52:42] then shout out cause the trumpet of the
[52:45] Jubilee to sound on the 10th day of the
[52:48] seventh month in the day of atonement
[52:50] shall you make the trumpet sound
[52:52] throughout all your land
[52:58] then verse 13 says in the year of this
[53:02] Jubilee you shall return every man unto
[53:05] his possession
[53:09] on position
[53:13] amen may the Lord
[53:20] in the scripture that we read
[53:22] God was giving a commandment to the
[53:25] children of Israel
[53:27] he was commanding Moses
[53:30] he says 50 years
[53:34] on the 10th day of the seventh month of
[53:37] the 50th year
[53:39] which was a day of atonement
[53:43] he said the high priest should go and
[53:45] sound the trumpets
[53:48] and throughout the land
[53:51] and when that trumpet is blown
[53:54] when the trumpet is
[53:57] every person has to go back to their
[54:00] position
[54:02] every person who was bound had to go
[54:04] free students
[54:06] because when the children of Israel
[54:09] crossed over from Egypt into the
[54:10] promises
[54:13] Joshua allocated them their possessions
[54:18] according to their tribes
[54:21] he gave each and every one of them their
[54:23] allocation
[54:26] but during the years
[54:29] some people would lose their possession
[54:33] some people people would lose their land
[54:37] because of a debt I caused during that
[54:40] when they failed to pay their debt they
[54:42] would become slaves
[54:45] so when you fail to pay your debt I
[54:47] don't come from paper for that you would
[54:49] become a slave exclav you work without
[54:52] getting paid
[54:54] or your land is taken
[54:58] but God had already made a way back
[55:04] made a provision for Grace
[55:17] you'll be able to claim back what was
[55:20] wrong
[55:24] in the 50th year you'll be able to go
[55:26] back
[55:27] and you would go free
[55:30] those chains that were binding you would
[55:32] bind you know
[55:34] foreign
[56:34] foreign
[56:53] [Music]
[57:00] [Music]
[57:34] tafami and you have to work for them in
[57:37] the field
[57:38] without getting paid
[57:41] and you don't have your freedom even if
[57:44] your children would suffer for your
[57:47] deaths
[57:49] and you would give it over to the person
[57:51] whom you owed a person
[57:54] amen amen but we thank God for he is
[57:58] amazing
[58:00] we thank God for making a way back
[58:05] hallelujah hallelujah because in the
[58:07] 50th years
[58:11] the high priest
[58:14] go around and blow a trumpet
[58:17] that was called a trumpet of Jubilee
[58:21] what the trumpet meant
[58:25] was you can go free
[58:28] what happened in the past 49 years
[58:32] it's being erased
[59:31] the prophet of God says
[59:34] the
[59:37] Lord
[59:38] he says many had many hundreds of years
[59:41] has passed
[59:43] but the same God that has sent the
[59:46] jubilees in them days is still the same
[59:48] God who sends jubilees today
[59:54] all the people that have been captured
[59:56] and was in captivity they come an
[59:58] acceptable year and when the trumpet
[1:00:01] sounded all the ones that were in
[1:00:03] captivity
[1:00:09] those that were in captivity didn't have
[1:00:12] to pay any price
[1:00:16] they could absolutely Go free
[1:00:20] if they were holding season you were in
[1:00:24] the fields
[1:00:30] you could drop that instruments
[1:00:34] because the Jubilee trumpet has sounded
[1:00:37] amen amen it doesn't matter what you are
[1:00:40] what's troubling you
[1:00:42] it doesn't matter what situation you're
[1:00:45] holding on situation when you hear that
[1:00:48] Trump is sounding Jubilee
[1:00:50] right there
[1:00:53] too it has no hold on you
[1:00:56] in return and Jubilee He says
[1:01:01] it says somehow other individuals lost
[1:01:04] their inheritance that was given to them
[1:01:05] by God
[1:01:11] and they came as Jubilee after 50 years
[1:01:16] every man that had lost his inheritance
[1:01:18] by some means to Tom Kevin
[1:01:21] if he was a Freeborn and the true
[1:01:24] blooded Israelite situative Remo and
[1:01:27] israelit no matter who held that
[1:01:29] possession
[1:01:31] they had to go back to him
[1:01:46] and now we know the Bible the natural
[1:01:49] Israel types as the spirit
[1:01:52] naturally Israel natural
[1:01:55] and Daughters of Abraham
[1:01:58] all the promises God gave to Abraham
[1:02:02] it's for his seat
[1:02:04] his natural seed Israel
[1:02:08] and his spiritual seed you and me it
[1:02:11] says
[1:02:14] so you gotta stand and say I'm a child
[1:02:17] of Abrams
[1:02:19] I'm standing on that promise
[1:02:22] so long I'm a child of Abraham
[1:02:25] I gotta go free
[1:02:28] so long I'm a child of Abraham
[1:02:31] those chains cannot hold me back
[1:02:34] hey man amen and it was pretty
[1:02:37] phenomenal that the trumpet of Jubilee
[1:02:39] city
[1:02:41] was sounded on the day of atonement
[1:02:46] back in the in the Old Testament
[1:02:49] the day of atonement was the tenth day
[1:02:51] of the seventh month
[1:02:55] and only the high priest could walk into
[1:02:58] the holy of holies
[1:03:02] once a year
[1:03:04] and he would walk in with the Basin of
[1:03:07] blood
[1:03:09] and he sprinkled the blood on the on the
[1:03:13] golden
[1:03:14] um on the on the gold instruments that
[1:03:16] are in the Holy songs
[1:03:21] this act of going in
[1:03:24] on the day of atonement
[1:03:30] was so that the sins of the children of
[1:03:32] Israel could be
[1:03:34] forgiveness
[1:03:36] everything that they had done
[1:03:38] the high priest was representing them to
[1:03:41] God
[1:03:44] so he would go in into the
[1:04:44] your sins are gone
[1:05:34] [Music]
[1:05:43] it's only his blood it's used
[1:06:01] [Music]
[1:06:11] and the high priest was given that
[1:06:13] mandate
[1:06:16] to appease God
[1:06:19] to appease God
[1:06:22] so that he would be reconciled back to
[1:06:25] his people
[1:06:27] will go to Luke chapter four
[1:06:30] verse 17 verses
[1:06:35] Jesus had gone to the synagogue
[1:06:39] and every time they went to the
[1:06:41] synagogue
[1:06:43] the priest would give the scroll to
[1:06:46] people to read
[1:06:50] and chapter 4 verse 17 says
[1:06:55] and there was delivered unto him the
[1:06:58] book of The Prophet is
[1:07:02] and when he had opened the book
[1:07:06] he found the place where it was written
[1:07:11] the spirit of the Lord is upon
[1:07:14] because he had anointed me to preach the
[1:07:17] gospel to the poor
[1:07:19] image
[1:07:23] he had sent me to heal the brokenhearted
[1:07:28] to preach Deliverance to the captives
[1:07:30] recovering
[1:08:33] this day
[1:08:56] he went to find the place that was
[1:08:59] talking about him
