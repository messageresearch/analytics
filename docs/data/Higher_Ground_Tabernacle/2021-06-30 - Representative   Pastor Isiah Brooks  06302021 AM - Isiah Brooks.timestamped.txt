[49:21] read that again and all things are of
[49:24] god
[49:24] who have reconciled us to himself by
[49:28] jesus christ
[49:29] and have given to us the ministry of
[49:32] reconciliation
[49:34] to with the god was in christ
[49:36] reconciling the world
[49:38] unto himself not imputing their
[49:40] trespasses
[49:42] unto them and have committed unto us
[49:46] the word of reconciliation that's
[49:49] powerful
[49:50] now then we are ambassadors for christ
[49:55] as though god did beseech you by us
[49:58] we pray you in christ stead be
[50:02] reconciled to god for he have made
[50:06] him to be sin for
[50:10] us hallelujah
[50:13] who knew no sin that he might be
[50:16] made the righteousness of god in him
[50:20] that we might be made
[50:23] the righteousness of god in him
[50:27] let's pray
[50:31] heavenly father we
[50:34] so thank you for your grace we thank you
[50:37] for your mercy
[50:39] hallelujah we thank you for being so
[50:42] good to us
[50:44] in spite of these times in these days
[50:47] lord where the battle is intense
[50:52] but father you said that you would keep
[50:55] us
[50:57] that you would shelter us and that you
[51:00] would present
[51:01] us faultless
[51:04] before the throne of god and lord we
[51:07] trust
[51:08] these words we are not able
[51:12] to produce a life of our own
[51:15] but let the life of christ live and
[51:18] reign in us
[51:19] and lord will be careful to give you the
[51:21] praise
[51:22] glory and honor in jesus christ's name
[51:25] we pray
[51:26] amen you may be seated i
[51:29] am just going to ask someone to get me
[51:33] some water i left mine back there
[51:38] we're dealing how can i say it
[51:42] i thought i'd just give a little message
[51:44] of grace tonight
[51:47] we've been talking about reaching a
[51:49] higher plane
[51:51] coming to a place where our minds are
[51:53] elevated
[51:55] in a level that god can do with us
[51:59] as he designed to do with us but you
[52:02] must understand that no matter how much
[52:04] bible you preach or how much bible you
[52:07] hear
[52:08] it must be mixed with faith amen
[52:14] the bible said he that cometh to god
[52:16] must believe that he is god
[52:18] and that he is a reward of those that
[52:20] diligently seek him
[52:22] god didn't bring christ to the earth to
[52:25] die for our sins and
[52:27] to raise from the dead just to have
[52:30] some type of drama in history
[52:34] but there was a purpose and we've been
[52:37] talking about that purpose and that is
[52:39] to produce its own kind
[52:41] to bring forth godly men amen
[52:45] men in the image and likeness of god
[52:48] even so much that jesus christ calls us
[52:51] brethren
[52:52] meaning that we've been born of the same
[52:54] mother and father
[52:56] who is jehovah himself i like
[53:00] to give you an understanding
[53:04] that our lives are not to be lives of
[53:07] chance something that is random
[53:11] but we must all begin to focus on why we
[53:15] are here
[53:17] uh i have i remember the time
[53:21] when uh i used to try to be a salesman
[53:26] i tried to be a salesman for amway
[53:29] i tried to be salesman for you know
[53:33] culligan waters and
[53:36] you name it vitamins and herbs and
[53:40] all that kind of stuff and all i could
[53:41] say is that they got a lot of money from
[53:44] me
[53:45] because i realized amen that i could
[53:47] never give them
[53:48] a hundred percent
[53:52] being that i was a christian i could not
[53:55] give them what
[53:56] i knew belonged to god
[54:00] see only christ is supposed to be first
[54:02] in your life
[54:04] everything else is secondary and i
[54:06] couldn't mix it
[54:07] because several times i would go to
[54:09] these meetings and they tried to
[54:11] mix christianity with color gun or mix
[54:13] christianity with amway and
[54:15] and i knew something was wrong with this
[54:17] because my god has never been that
[54:20] right he's a word
[54:23] but we but these people were so
[54:26] sold out to what they believe in matter
[54:29] of fact
[54:30] it in their services it was like a
[54:33] church
[54:33] service it was a religion that they had
[54:36] formed around this product
[54:39] and and so god showed me that but the
[54:42] thing that i like about it was that
[54:44] these people were sincere there was a
[54:45] many people who became
[54:47] multi-millionaires because they gave
[54:50] their all
[54:51] 24 7 to this particular product
[54:55] and i thought to myself you know just
[54:58] thinking
[54:59] they were representatives they were so
[55:01] sold on this product that it was very
[55:04] difficult for you
[55:05] to convince them that it was not worth
[55:08] the money
[55:10] because they could care less how much it
[55:11] cost they figured that this product is
[55:14] worth it
[55:14] and you need to buy it they were
[55:17] representatives
[55:19] they were salesmen and they were good at
[55:21] the diplomacy they were
[55:23] diplomats for it they were able to
[55:26] [Music]
[55:27] get in your spirit they were able to
[55:30] convince
[55:31] you that they were right that's how i
[55:34] got there
[55:36] they made me believe i was a salesman
[55:38] even when i wasn't one
[55:42] and my wife is she worried that's right
[55:44] the truth she knew i wasn't and she
[55:46] tried to tell me but i had to go through
[55:49] several products before i came to
[55:52] recognize
[55:53] i'm not a salesman but it's not like
[55:57] with christ
[55:59] because only christ knows what heaven is
[56:02] like
[56:05] and we are representatives
[56:08] i know that even you know liz paul
[56:10] didn't realize that
[56:11] god was using him tonight as a as a
[56:15] witness to the message
[56:17] in which i'm going to preach because in
[56:20] everything we
[56:22] do we're supposed to wreck uh represents
[56:24] what's going on in heaven
[56:26] father not my will but let thine be done
[56:30] and they're rejoicing over there they're
[56:33] singing they're praising god
[56:35] is that right and they ask jesus father
[56:39] teach us how to pray and he says let thy
[56:42] will be done in earth as it is in heaven
[56:45] amen and truly in this day we who are
[56:48] brides supposed to be the happiest
[56:50] people on the earth
[56:53] and the only reason we're not as happy
[56:55] as we should be
[56:56] is because somewhere we have allowed the
[56:59] word to drop
[57:01] under unbelief
[57:06] an ambassador he's an accredited
[57:09] diplomat not some kind of guy that's
[57:12] just
[57:12] out of school but he's sent by a country
[57:15] or
[57:16] he's an official he's an official uh
[57:19] individual that represents his country
[57:23] paul said we are all ambassadors
[57:27] that means we come from a different
[57:29] place we're going somewhere
[57:31] but while we're here we are on a mission
[57:35] amen hallelujah we're on a mission of
[57:38] reconciliation by the scriptures of
[57:42] god told us amen that christ
[57:45] reconciled the world unto himself
[57:48] and then he sent ambassadors
[57:52] see you can't be a witness unless you've
[57:55] been there
[57:56] you understand me and the only way you
[57:59] can really believe that you're there
[58:01] you've got to believe the word that's
[58:03] right
[58:04] is that right i always go back to when
[58:06] brother adam said
[58:07] i saw you over there that's my
[58:10] revelation
[58:11] i can't give it to nobody else but
[58:13] that's my revelation
[58:16] the saddest thing is we fail to see
[58:19] that we're free he whom the son is set
[58:23] free
[58:23] is free indeed we allow our conscience
[58:28] to condemn us in a daily basis
[58:31] when christ has already set you free
[58:33] because the bible said he whom the son
[58:35] is set free
[58:36] is free indeed there is now
[58:39] no condemnation to those who walk not
[58:42] after the flesh
[58:43] but after the spirit hallelujah
[58:47] now i just read you the scripture and
[58:49] the bible says
[58:50] and telling us amen to which god was in
[58:54] christ
[58:54] reconciling the world unto himself what
[58:58] not imputing their transpasses
[59:01] against unto them
[59:04] it didn't mean that we were not
[59:06] transparent but he said he will not
[59:09] impute that means charge you so every
[59:12] time the devil tries to put you down
[59:14] with a charge
[59:15] you tell him i am free by the blood of
[59:19] jesus christ
[59:20] i am free and you must realize by god's
[59:23] grace
[59:24] you are a representative this is the
[59:27] gospel that you and i supposed to preach
[59:29] to the world
[59:30] to tell them that jesus christ paid the
[59:32] price
[59:33] amen he paid it
[59:36] you owe nothing all the debt has been
[59:39] paid
[59:40] but you got to walk in this liberty
[59:43] hallelujah
[59:44] you must walk in this liberty
[59:50] never say you a hypocrite no i could
[59:52] never be oh yeah yeah
[59:54] i could never be a hypocrite
[59:58] you could never be a hypocrite why
[1:00:01] because you are accepted in the beloved
[1:00:06] and christ jesus is not a hypocrite he
[1:00:08] can never be a hypocrite
[1:00:10] and as long as you in him you can never
[1:00:13] be a hypocrite
[1:00:15] oh people of god is the lies from the
[1:00:18] devil
[1:00:19] that satan places on us and keep us from
[1:00:22] our freedom
[1:00:22] from our liberty and from witnessing to
[1:00:25] people
[1:00:26] to let them know the joys of the lord
[1:00:29] because the bible said the joys of the
[1:00:30] lord
[1:00:31] is your strength hallelujah he strips us
[1:00:35] by stripping us from our joy
[1:00:38] and your joy is taken away when you
[1:00:40] forget what christ
[1:00:42] has done for you amen
[1:00:46] hallelujah we're on a journey
[1:00:49] we're on our way to a new city
[1:00:54] when the saints go marching in
[1:00:57] hallelujah
[1:00:58] it's not that i want to be in that
[1:00:59] number he's already told me i'm in the
[1:01:02] number
[1:01:03] you are in the number
[1:01:06] hallelujah glory to god
[1:01:10] is that right we failed to tell people
[1:01:12] the good news of this message
[1:01:15] a lot of times people don't even
[1:01:16] understand that god has moved on
[1:01:18] and this is a great thing that you and i
[1:01:20] are experiencing that god can justify
[1:01:22] us as though we've never sinned in the
[1:01:24] first place
[1:01:26] now you've got to believe that right in
[1:01:27] order to make a rapture you've got to
[1:01:29] believe that
[1:01:30] you must believe every word that has
[1:01:33] been spoken
[1:01:34] hallelujah because this was not given to
[1:01:37] you
[1:01:38] by a man or from a man this came from
[1:01:41] god
[1:01:41] through a man hallelujah and only
[1:01:45] god knew what the unwritten word was
[1:01:49] nobody else's teaches this hallelujah
[1:01:53] nobody else just teaches this to
[1:01:56] understand that we have an
[1:01:57] unmerited favor and an unmerited love
[1:02:01] from god hallelujah we didn't know that
[1:02:05] an unconditional love it ain't what you
[1:02:08] do
[1:02:09] it's what he's done for you and a lot of
[1:02:12] times we fail to see
[1:02:14] oh i gotta work it i gotta work it you
[1:02:16] don't have to work it
[1:02:18] it will work you yes sir god changes you
[1:02:22] and as long as you're in the way you'll
[1:02:24] never be changed
[1:02:27] hallelujah glory to god
[1:02:30] hallelujah you'll never see a tree
[1:02:34] bragging on the apples look at all my
[1:02:37] apples
[1:02:38] i got more apples than you
[1:02:42] that tree has nothing to do with how
[1:02:45] many apples comes on that tree
[1:02:47] it is a predestinated elected thought of
[1:02:50] god
[1:02:51] that makes each apple tree bring forth
[1:02:53] its fruit
[1:02:55] and every apple tree has a number of
[1:02:58] fruit
[1:02:58] that it will bear and then it dies
[1:03:03] you understand me you say well oh
[1:03:05] brother brooks what do you mean
[1:03:07] you better thank god this is free you
[1:03:10] better thank god that you don't have to
[1:03:12] work it
[1:03:13] you better thank god amen that god has
[1:03:15] set you free
[1:03:17] amen you better thank him
[1:03:20] you know brother branham tried to tell
[1:03:21] us and every time he thought about god
[1:03:24] he started getting happy and running
[1:03:25] around trees and
[1:03:26] you know their show that he showed that
[1:03:28] you know he was standing i saw him
[1:03:30] standing up on a pulpit a podium

[1:03:36] tonight
[1:03:39] yeah i'm i'm telling it
[1:03:42] all the camera may not have seen it yeah
[1:03:43] that was him
[1:03:45] amen and it's a good thing it's a good
[1:03:48] thing don't ever let it die don't ever
[1:03:51] let it die don't worry about your
[1:03:52] neighbors and what they think about it
[1:03:55] it's between you and god he chose to
[1:03:58] dance with you

[1:04:02] in the flesh right now we want to dance
[1:04:04] with you

[1:04:25] just pop and pop
[1:04:27] that's where it used to be and jesus
[1:04:30] don't change
[1:04:32] we change we we're the ones that get all
[1:04:35] sophisticated and
[1:04:36] you know we're the ones that get in this
[1:04:38] mood that you know holiness is being
[1:04:40] steal
[1:04:42] no that ain't holiness that's dead
[1:04:46] starchiness is an offense to god did
[1:04:49] y'all know that
[1:04:50] being starchy is an offense to god amen
[1:04:55] read your message you'll find out
[1:04:59] representatives chosen
[1:05:04] to act on the behalf of another
[1:05:10] now god did not sent us here
[1:05:14] to blend in because light
[1:05:17] and darkness have no fellowship
[1:05:22] we're of two different worlds hallelujah
[1:05:26] and so therefore you say well lord i've
[1:05:28] been doing wrong so

[1:06:13] everything is an appointed time oh you
[1:06:16] say well what do you mean remember
[1:06:18] those two neighbors one had a guard
[1:06:21] on the neck and one had this thing with
[1:06:24] their stomach
[1:06:25] and they went through the prayer line
[1:06:26] with brother branham and and god told
[1:06:29] both of them no by calling by name told
[1:06:31] them where they would live y'all
[1:06:32] remember
[1:06:32] amen brother battle went hunting amen i
[1:06:35] think jack moore whoever it was
[1:06:36] amen and and uh and and the man let him
[1:06:40] you know uh use the land to hunt
[1:06:44] but he wanted to know who told
[1:06:47] or what told that man the name of those
[1:06:50] two women
[1:06:52] and what their ailments were he wanted
[1:06:55] to know and brother brown said just
[1:06:56] just wait right here and think about
[1:07:01] how come that water didn't come down
[1:07:03] that pole
[1:07:06] and and i'll tell you when i get back
[1:07:09] who told me told you
[1:07:12] yeah it's you amen
[1:07:16] what's his name would it be brandon
[1:07:20] yeah that's brown well that's me y'all
[1:07:22] understand me i'm paraphrasing
[1:07:24] but the point is he won and he brought
[1:07:27] an infidel to christ
[1:07:30] a man who did not even believe in god he
[1:07:33] didn't go into some
[1:07:34] deep theological stuff he took the very
[1:07:37] things of nature
[1:07:38] to convince the man that god is real
[1:07:42] sometimes we think we we think too oh
[1:07:44] this man got the doctor divinity
[1:07:46] who cares he knows greek
[1:07:50] i know english and i know god
[1:07:54] amen who cares about greed they all
[1:07:58] argued even in that time which greek
[1:08:00] word was right
[1:08:02] they're still doing it
[1:08:05] upon this rock i'll build my church and
[1:08:08] the gates of hell shall not prevail
[1:08:10] against him
[1:08:11] now i'm saying all of these things to
[1:08:13] you today because i'm going to tell you
[1:08:15] something it takes a strong faith
[1:08:18] to handle the word the hand of the sword
[1:08:21] it takes a strong faith
[1:08:23] when all around you got evidence that
[1:08:26] you are a failure
[1:08:29] and it takes strong faith to believe
[1:08:32] that you're more than a conqueror
[1:08:34] that's true you understand me and that
[1:08:38] word says
[1:08:39] you are more than a conqueror
[1:08:44] hallelujah and you got to understand
[1:08:47] if that be the case yes we're like under
[1:08:50] the seventh seal like
[1:08:51] gideon you know it talks about that you
[1:08:54] know here was gideon
[1:08:55] amen and he's among the midianites who
[1:08:58] call which is called strife and
[1:08:59] y'all know how that go and we realized
[1:09:02] by the grace of god
[1:09:04] and then god had to convince gideon that
[1:09:07] he was more than a conqueror
[1:09:09] that he was a mighty man available and
[1:09:12] let me tell you something
[1:09:13] we are here now yes sir amen
[1:09:17] hallelujah and it's all right
[1:09:20] to say lord give me a sign but you know
[1:09:23] in the message they said don't do that
[1:09:24] that's too pentecostal
[1:09:26] well gideon didn't care
[1:09:29] he had gotten a visualization from the
[1:09:31] angel and he still asks for a sign
[1:09:34] lord y'all understand me
[1:09:38] these intellectual folks makes me mad
[1:09:41] because you know what they do
[1:09:42] they do just like those midianites they
[1:09:45] bring strife between the believer
[1:09:47] what is and what is not and then they
[1:09:49] try to elevate themselves
[1:09:53] but if you ordained by god you have a
[1:09:55] right to ask your father
[1:09:57] amen help me lord i've been in this
[1:10:01] strife i've been among the message i've

[1:12:46] you're going to make mistakes but that's
[1:12:48] not what god is working on

[1:13:34] serve the devil who's afflicting you
[1:13:40] where are you going to go i've seen so
[1:13:41] many people getting trapped and now they
[1:13:43] don't even know how to get out of it
[1:13:45] saying so god let me tell you something
[1:13:47] don't let the devil fool you
[1:13:49] you get in the trap they know so it
[1:13:51] ain't easy getting out
[1:13:53] hallelujah oh yeah nothing but the truth
[1:13:58] god is good all the time
[1:14:03] is that right how many all believe this
[1:14:06] first corinthians 15 49 says
[1:14:08] and we have borne the image of the
[1:14:11] earthly
[1:14:12] we shall also bear the image of the
[1:14:14] heavenly how many all believe that
[1:14:15] i believe i believe that i received that
[1:14:20] hallelujah you know you get people and
[1:14:22] they just carry on and
[1:14:23] bless it be the god of william branham
[1:14:25] bless it be the god of william branham
[1:14:28] blessed be the god of isaiah brooks yes
[1:14:31] y'all understand me blessed be the god
[1:14:34] of isaiah brooks
[1:14:35] amen amen
[1:14:40] when moses went up on the mountain
[1:14:44] god said to him i'm the god of abraham
[1:14:48] isaac and jacob
[1:14:49] hallelujah amen but when god told
[1:14:53] moses said he'd already introduced
[1:14:56] himself
[1:14:57] i am the god of abraham and jacob
[1:15:01] right so so wait a minute i
[1:15:04] am the god of william branham is that
[1:15:06] right you can put his name there
[1:15:08] but then moses comes along and says lord
[1:15:11] who shall i
[1:15:12] say
[1:15:16] who should i say sent me
[1:15:19] and god didn't say tell him i'm the god
[1:15:22] of abraham
[1:15:23] i said no he said what i
[1:15:26] am hallelujah
[1:15:30] that's what you must understand you
[1:15:32] become
[1:15:33] god's i am amen he sends you
[1:15:37] you're the reconcile the world christ
[1:15:40] in you reconciling the world to himself
[1:15:44] you amen showing the world that there is
[1:15:47] another level of existence
[1:15:49] and that existence is in god in christ
[1:15:53] hallelujah i heard brother branham said
[1:15:55] i today i heard i was listening to him
[1:15:56] he said
[1:15:57] he said i feel so good i feel like i
[1:15:59] could jump to the seventh dimension
[1:16:02] i never heard him say that i'm like i'm
[1:16:04] coming too
[1:16:06] hallelujah that's right because that's
[1:16:09] where
[1:16:09] we belong if you overcome this world
[1:16:13] i will grant that you will set in my
[1:16:15] throne even as my father
[1:16:17] i've sat in my father's storm hallelujah
[1:16:21] you understand me that's a position
[1:16:24] amen
[1:16:28] hallelujah i believe that i believe that
[1:16:33] you love the lord hallelujah
[1:16:36] i hope i can find what i'm looking for
[1:16:38] here
[1:16:41] see that's god's purpose that's one of
[1:16:42] those scriptures out of oneness
[1:16:44] that's god's purpose and his purpose as
[1:16:47] father supreme
[1:16:48] was to be one with his family earthly
[1:16:51] family
[1:16:52] adam and eve right and
[1:16:55] the only way they could be one with the
[1:16:58] family or with god
[1:16:59] because god's nature was in them
[1:17:02] so that made them with god's nature in
[1:17:05] them see
[1:17:06] then with each of the others in god they
[1:17:09] become
[1:17:10] all one now let me stop there because
[1:17:12] sometimes when we think that we got
[1:17:14] god's nature in us
[1:17:16] we've got to be a superman
[1:17:19] raising the dead and healing the sick
[1:17:21] and the eyes of the blind open
[1:17:23] that ain't for everybody hallelujah
[1:17:27] amen remember you know one sister say
[1:17:30] brother branham
[1:17:30] says uh uh i said i pray and fast all
[1:17:34] the time and
[1:17:34] i i need teach me how to cast out devil
[1:17:37] he said that
[1:17:38] ain't your calling your calling is to
[1:17:41] fast and pray
[1:17:42] yes amen see everybody don't you you can
[1:17:45] can't you see the mess this would be if
[1:17:48] everybody had the ability to think you
[1:17:50] know to do things
[1:17:51] oh my goodness that's what jealousy and
[1:17:54] envy and strife and
[1:17:55] is that right look at the corinthians
[1:17:57] church on the least of all gifts
[1:18:01] when it came to tongues everybody wanted
[1:18:02] to speak in tongues and prophesy and all
[1:18:04] of the stuff
[1:18:05] hey you know paul says okay this is all
[1:18:07] right for you to desire that
[1:18:09] but you see that's not given to
[1:18:10] everybody that's right
[1:18:12] amen amen we must find our slot
[1:18:16] our position and be content with it
[1:18:19] because you know what the devil thinks
[1:18:21] he'll make you think you're not a
[1:18:22] christian because you're not laying on
[1:18:24] those hands on the sick and casting out
[1:18:26] devils and
[1:18:26] seeing miracles and you're the biggest
[1:18:29] miracle
[1:18:30] you're the greatest there is no greater
[1:18:33] miracle than to see a soul saved
[1:18:37] don't let the devil put those things in
[1:18:39] your mind
[1:18:41] like that because he's done it for me
[1:18:45] but you're the one who's testifying to
[1:18:47] all nature
[1:18:49] that god is real hallelujah
[1:18:52] you know you can meet a muslim and they
[1:18:55] can call you down and say well
[1:18:57] you know how can you prove god is real
[1:19:01] you know jesus didn't rise from the dead
[1:19:03] because that's what they think they
[1:19:04] think
[1:19:04] they said jesus took some kind of
[1:19:06] mandarin weed
[1:19:08] right and he went to sleep and i think
[1:19:10] it was like
[1:19:11] heartbeat one minute or
[1:19:14] an hour once some hour whatever the case
[1:19:16] may be right
[1:19:18] hallelujah but you failed to see amen
[1:19:21] they failed to see that he did raise
[1:19:23] from the dead
[1:19:24] have you ever thought about why the
[1:19:25] world hate the name jesus
[1:19:28] and i hate to say it message people do
[1:19:29] too
[1:19:31] they don't say they do but you know they
[1:19:32] stutter and then to talk about jesus
[1:19:36] and don't even realize the spirit that
[1:19:38] they're under
[1:19:39] hallelujah but there's only power
[1:19:42] in only one name and that name is the
[1:19:45] name of jesus christ
[1:19:47] well it's true hallelujah i was
[1:19:50] somewhere
[1:19:52] uh well here and the brother says well
[1:19:55] let me let me read a quote because i
[1:19:56] don't want nobody to get mad what
[1:19:59] that's nonsense preach the inspiration
[1:20:03] of god
[1:20:04] how you learn about it i used to worry
[1:20:06] too
[1:20:07] because there were people saying you
[1:20:08] ain't preaching the message until you
[1:20:10] give a
[1:20:10] quote hallelujah i don't quote because
[1:20:13] people want it
[1:20:15] i quote because i'm led to do it you
[1:20:17] understand me
[1:20:19] hallelujah exactly right he said
[1:20:23] now now understand what i'm working with
[1:20:26] all of my children have different gifts
[1:20:29] but yet they have the same blood
[1:20:32] all of them can't see
[1:20:36] you understand me now daddy can sing
[1:20:39] they say
[1:20:41] but everybody can't sing like daddy
[1:20:44] y'all understand what i'm saying but
[1:20:46] because they can't sing doesn't mean
[1:20:48] they're not
[1:20:48] myself my daughter or my son that's
[1:20:51] right
[1:20:51] hallelujah now think about it now this
[1:20:54] might sound a little
[1:20:55] i can do some baking i can do some cakes
[1:20:57] and things like that most of y'all know
[1:20:59] that and now they know it all over the
[1:21:00] world
[1:21:00] but nevertheless i have a daughter who
[1:21:04] outshines me
[1:21:06] she never went to school
[1:21:10] but she can do such hard work and and
[1:21:12] the cakes are delicious
[1:21:15] i didn't have to teach her that it came
[1:21:18] by way of the bloodline amen
[1:21:22] y'all understand and i'm trying to tell
[1:21:25] you something
[1:21:26] you know we get on ourselves because
[1:21:28] we're not always
[1:21:29] witnessing is not always talking that's
[1:21:32] right
[1:21:32] witnessing is living it the best
[1:21:36] witnessing you could do is to live a
[1:21:38] holy life
[1:21:39] in the face of sinners
[1:21:43] you'll make them thirsty if you are
[1:21:45] salty
[1:21:46] you understand me it ain't always i got
[1:21:49] to tell them
[1:21:50] you don't have to tell them and don't
[1:21:52] tell them
[1:21:53] until jesus moved you to tell him that's
[1:21:55] right amen
[1:21:58] why the bible said don't cast your
[1:22:00] pearls upon the swines
[1:22:03] there's a reason for it amen every child
[1:22:06] of god must be
[1:22:08] led by god
[1:22:11] hallelujah it's not because i feel like
[1:22:13] it it's because god is leading me
[1:22:19] you we look at the scripture and we see
[1:22:21] well brother books what are you trying
[1:22:23] to say
[1:22:24] if we're going to represent god we need
[1:22:26] to live it
[1:22:27] amen amen hallelujah
[1:22:30] how many of y'all believe you you
[1:22:32] bearing this earthly i said that
[1:22:34] but if god is saying there's another
[1:22:36] world and that you to be
[1:22:38] born into it y'all know why i'm talking
[1:22:40] about this
[1:22:41] we're talking about a rapture we're
[1:22:43] talking about a changing of the body
[1:22:46] but we must first understand that before
[1:22:48] the change of this natural body
[1:22:50] the changing of the inner man must
[1:22:52] change first
[1:22:54] god ain't going to put this wonderful
[1:22:57] new man
[1:22:58] and keep him in a dirty vessel
[1:23:00] hallelujah
[1:23:02] and god is not going to take his holy
[1:23:03] spirit and put it in a dirty vessel
[1:23:07] amen hallelujah is that all right you
[1:23:10] say
[1:23:10] well brother brooks i make mistakes we
[1:23:12] all make mistakes
[1:23:14] but i'm gonna tell you something before
[1:23:16] you got the holy ghost in your soul
[1:23:18] there was a fire cleansing you and
[1:23:21] brother
[1:23:22] said once that that seed is quickened
[1:23:24] the womb is shut
[1:23:26] but it does not stop the devil from
[1:23:29] anointing your spirit
[1:23:30] and your flesh
[1:23:35] oh i got the holy ghost you got it
[1:23:38] sure i believe that hallelujah well
[1:23:42] you know just like a lot of people
[1:23:43] thought well you know people couldn't
[1:23:44] get the corona if they had the holy
[1:23:46] ghost
[1:23:47] that's nonsense people die
[1:23:51] you mean to tell me that true saints of
[1:23:53] god can't
[1:23:54] die from cancer you're going to die from
[1:23:57] something
[1:23:57] and guess what that cancer that takes
[1:23:59] them out that's a demon
[1:24:04] that flesh ain't no good understanding
[1:24:07] it's your enemy
[1:24:08] am i making sense but we must see what
[1:24:11] i'm trying to get us to see
[1:24:13] is that we must break through a break
[1:24:16] from ourselves
[1:24:18] in order to tell somebody else about
[1:24:20] christ
[1:24:22] you can't witness a good witness
[1:24:26] if you don't have the joy of the lord
[1:24:27] yourself oh
[1:24:29] don't you know about that see what it is
[1:24:31] we have come to a place where the
[1:24:33] intellectual part of this message
[1:24:35] is not doing the doing its job you
[1:24:38] understand what i mean by that
[1:24:39] i'm not saying it's not good it's
[1:24:40] excellent it's powerful but without the
[1:24:42] holy ghost it can't live
[1:24:44] amen the holy ghost makes it live folks
[1:24:49] and you and i need that i don't care i
[1:24:51] don't care
[1:24:52] you need to stay with god until you
[1:24:54] convince that you got it
[1:25:02] and if you do have it guess what it's
[1:25:05] going to bring about changes
[1:25:10] changes in your life that you won't have
[1:25:11] nothing to do with
[1:25:13] glory hallelujah
[1:25:16] is that all right i had a friend tell me
[1:25:18] that and i know he did
[1:25:20] he loved peanut butter
[1:25:23] and then he got the corona and that
[1:25:26] corona changed his taste buds
[1:25:29] so much so that he can't hardly stand to
[1:25:31] smell peanut butter
[1:25:33] now if the demon can bring a change
[1:25:37] what about the holy ghost you understand
[1:25:39] what i'm trying to say
[1:25:41] give god the chance
[1:25:44] let go and let god this is going to end
[1:25:47] and it's going to end
[1:25:48] sooner than most of us think
[1:25:51] oh lord help us jesus talking about a
[1:25:53] new world i don't know about you
[1:25:55] everybody talking about a new world
[1:25:57] order i'm talking about a new world
[1:25:58] order too
[1:25:59] but it ain't going to be here hallelujah
[1:26:04] you love the lord you know the thing
[1:26:07] about it is i think
[1:26:09] we come to a place
[1:26:12] you and i must understand there is
[1:26:14] nobody good
[1:26:17] my good pastor oh my pastor
[1:26:20] i know y'all don't talk about me like
[1:26:22] that but still yeah
[1:26:25] i've heard people talk about their good
[1:26:26] pastors ain't nobody good
[1:26:28] he falls just like you false he gets up
[1:26:31] just like you gets
[1:26:32] up right and you and i must understand
[1:26:36] that christ must be real
[1:26:39] question and answer he says so christ
[1:26:44] in your heart that's real
[1:26:47] christ and the holy spirit christ
[1:26:51] means anointed one and the holy spirit
[1:26:54] is that anointing
[1:26:55] you are the one that's anointing
[1:26:58] anointed seed
[1:26:59] and it's christ and you anointing you
[1:27:02] but let me go to this
[1:27:06] to keep the anointing oil flowing
[1:27:09] you've got to have prayer
[1:27:13] you understand me prayer must be an
[1:27:16] important part
[1:27:17] and you can't tell me the devil don't
[1:27:19] fight you in prayer because he fights
[1:27:21] me hallelujah he
[1:27:24] always wants to cheat god
[1:27:28] and he teach god by way of prayer you
[1:27:30] understand me
[1:27:31] by you not praying
[1:27:38] so you and i must understand it doesn't
[1:27:39] matter if i can shout
[1:27:41] dance speak in tongues roll all over the
[1:27:43] floor all of that is good
[1:27:44] but brother said don't depend on that
[1:27:48] hallelujah he said the holy spirit is a
[1:27:51] being
[1:27:52] it's god god in you the person
[1:27:57] god that's lit your whole entire
[1:28:01] being and how many of us feel that way
[1:28:03] even if you don't feel that way now i'm
[1:28:05] sure at some point in time you did
[1:28:08] everything was lit up and you know what
[1:28:11] the problem god says
[1:28:13] the only thing that can stop that is
[1:28:15] when you got flues that are clogged
[1:28:18] inlets and outlets that you've allowed
[1:28:20] satan to clog up your
[1:28:22] your sensitive part that spirit part of
[1:28:25] you
[1:28:27] envy strife forgiveness whatever it may
[1:28:29] be
[1:28:30] right clogging you up and now you don't
[1:28:33] feel the presence of the lord the way
[1:28:34] you used to
[1:28:35] and i'm gonna tell you something folks
[1:28:37] the bible tells us to separate ourselves
[1:28:40] from
[1:28:40] all unbelief
[1:28:45] sometimes when you see people talking
[1:28:47] all that negative stuff you need to tell
[1:28:49] them
[1:28:49] because if you don't tell them that a
[1:28:51] negative atmosphere
[1:28:52] will affect you
[1:28:56] hallelujah you love god amen let's move
[1:29:00] on by god's grace
[1:29:02] i'm trying to find something jumping
[1:29:04] probably all over it
[1:29:06] i'm used to my ipad
[1:29:10] amen you love god amen let's
[1:29:13] uh let's go to uh
[1:29:16] one more scripture i i didn't plan to
[1:29:18] keep belong
[1:29:19] but i wanted to really encourage you
[1:29:21] because
[1:29:23] i needed it today if that makes sense
[1:29:27] i needed it today myself and through
[1:29:31] this message
[1:29:32] god encouraged me and he made me see
[1:29:36] that i didn't come here amen to be part
[1:29:38] of a lodge or club
[1:29:41] i came to represent heaven and if
[1:29:44] every day if any day passed by and i'm
[1:29:47] not representing heaven
[1:29:49] i'm failing my work i'm failing my job
[1:29:53] y'all understand me it doesn't matter
[1:29:55] anymore whether people like you
[1:29:56] that doesn't matter it's like oh you
[1:29:59] know and i used to go witnessing
[1:30:01] a lot more than i do now and when people
[1:30:03] see me they say oh here come the jws
[1:30:08] y'all know what jws are jehovah
[1:30:10] witnesses
[1:30:12] because they're the only ones that see
[1:30:15] you see out there
[1:30:16] and that's that's a call but at least
[1:30:19] they believe in what they believe
[1:30:21] enough to knock on people's doors
[1:30:24] and get the door slammed in their face
[1:30:27] right
[1:30:29] you got to give honor to them at least
[1:30:32] they believe in what they believe
[1:30:34] enough to get out there what about us
[1:30:38] you know in the message we try to make
[1:30:40] excuses well
[1:30:41] it's over when when you better think god
[1:30:45] is not
[1:30:47] it ain't over god's still saving souls
[1:30:52] is that right and brother brown said
[1:30:54] when that last one comes in it might be
[1:30:57] a book or tape
[1:30:59] y'all understand that that means amen he
[1:31:02] doesn't have to do nothing but have the
[1:31:04] faith in that word
[1:31:06] and brother said the rapture takes place
[1:31:08] that's what i was trying to bring out
[1:31:09] about enoch
[1:31:10] enoch had nothing to do but to walk with
[1:31:13] god
[1:31:13] that's all you have to do and you think
[1:31:15] that's easy
[1:31:17] not in this age every demon out of hell
[1:31:20] amen is fighting you on a daily basis to
[1:31:23] keep
[1:31:24] you from walking with god and that means
[1:31:27] staying within the word
[1:31:30] amen no lust of the eye no lust of the
[1:31:32] flesh
[1:31:33] no pride of life staying in that word
[1:31:36] with humility i was trying yeah he
[1:31:40] he you know and people don't know the
[1:31:42] importance of humility
[1:31:44] humility is wonderful but nobody wants
[1:31:47] to humble themselves to it
[1:31:49] but humility is wonderful amen that's
[1:31:51] what brother adam said
[1:31:52] he christ defeated satan with sweetness
[1:31:56] and meekness
[1:31:58] i can't get over that quote sweetness
[1:32:00] and meekness
[1:32:01] now you better do it now that's not
[1:32:04] christ
[1:32:07] it's amazing how we want to handle other
[1:32:08] people but when god when it comes to us
[1:32:10] we want
[1:32:11] people to handle us in a different way
[1:32:15] hallelujah they that are led by the
[1:32:17] spirit of god they are the sons of god
[1:32:20] turn with me to hebrew please
[1:32:24] hebrews 12. and i'll let that be i'm not
[1:32:27] going like i said i'm not going to be
[1:32:28] long this is a wednesday
[1:32:31] but i just wanted to give a word of
[1:32:32] encouragement
[1:32:34] something to set you free hallelujah
[1:32:38] because i know the devil and the devil
[1:32:41] is always accusing the saints of god
[1:32:44] always making you feel like i gotta work
[1:32:46] it out work it out work it out no
[1:32:48] he wants to work it out of you
[1:32:50] [Laughter]
[1:32:53] he wants to get it all out of you so
[1:32:55] that he can see some joyful faces right
[1:32:58] oh it's terrible it's terrible when
[1:33:01] everybody looks sad
[1:33:02] you know everybody happy amen
[1:33:09] god got it all in control
[1:33:16] before i forget that song i sang tonight
[1:33:18] would be a good one for you sister
[1:33:21] i ain't going to call your name but it
[1:33:22] would be a good song for you
[1:33:26] hallelujah yes the grace of god
[1:33:30] what i said second korean hebrews i'm
[1:33:32] sorry hebrews 12th
[1:33:34] captive look at this scripture wherefore
[1:33:37] beginning at the first verse
[1:33:38] wherefore seeing we also are compassed
[1:33:42] about
[1:33:43] with so great a cloud of witnesses
[1:33:47] let us lay aside every weight and the
[1:33:50] sin with that so easily beset us
[1:33:53] and let us run with patience the race
[1:33:56] that is set before us we've got
[1:34:00] people who have witnessed uh
[1:34:03] think about it we call ourselves
[1:34:05] abraham's seed and the bible said
[1:34:07] abraham looked for a city whose builder
[1:34:10] and maker was god
[1:34:12] his whole life was looking for that city
[1:34:16] now he was distracted but it did not
[1:34:20] stop him
[1:34:21] for coming to the place where the city
[1:34:23] was
[1:34:25] my face brother said the very place
[1:34:27] abraham's finally
[1:34:28] he finished ended his journey he said he
[1:34:31] did not even know
[1:34:32] but the city was standing above him a
[1:34:35] different dimension
[1:34:36] but it was there hallelujah he went
[1:34:40] through a lot of things
[1:34:41] but he got there and you and i we're
[1:34:44] looking for a city whose building
[1:34:46] and maker is god oh not one made out of
[1:34:49] brick and mortar
[1:34:51] but a celestial body a celestial city
[1:34:55] that god himself and god only can make
[1:35:00] witnesses like daniel i know he's real
[1:35:07] hallelujah i saw him come through when i
[1:35:10] was in the lion's den
[1:35:11] those are people who says i know he's
[1:35:13] real y'all understand what i'm saying
[1:35:16] uh other hebrew boys they can say it
[1:35:18] when i was in the fiery furnace i know
[1:35:20] he's real
[1:35:22] witnesses we've got people from genesis
[1:35:25] to revelation
[1:35:26] huh oh adam couldn't even say he told me
[1:35:29] i was going to die
[1:35:30] and and i did spiritually but the grace
[1:35:33] of god
[1:35:34] flew a lamb and set me free i know he's
[1:35:38] real
[1:35:39] see we've got too many people who know
[1:35:42] he's real
[1:35:43] to ever doubt that he's real
[1:35:46] right think about it people it is a
[1:35:49] real situation that we're working with
[1:35:52] and you know what god didn't leave us 2
[1:35:54] 000 years ago no sir he brought a
[1:35:57] malachi
[1:35:58] 4 a representative an ambassador
[1:36:01] from christ to show that the city was
[1:36:04] real
[1:36:05] not only did he show us the power of the
[1:36:07] city but he showed us the king of the
[1:36:09] city
[1:36:10] the man who sent him is now sending you
[1:36:14] to do the same works they'll do the same
[1:36:17] works that's what the bible says
[1:36:19] the same words amen the same things the
[1:36:23] same power
[1:36:24] the same everything but you know what
[1:36:28] we've had too many many nights around us
[1:36:32] people calling strife and you know
[1:36:35] we you know want to tell you something
[1:36:36] people that's why brother ram said it
[1:36:39] it's going to be such a few that make a
[1:36:41] rapture
[1:36:45] we we too we're too busy and i'm going
[1:36:48] to tell you something the
[1:36:49] media and all of the stuff makes us even
[1:36:52] more busier
[1:36:54] we got enough stuff but we want to learn
[1:36:55] what everybody else is doing
[1:36:58] right and it just causes problems
[1:37:01] within your own spirit it causes
[1:37:03] problems i'm not saying
[1:37:04] it's all evil no it's evil and it's good
[1:37:06] you can find some good out there
[1:37:09] but the point is when you see like even
[1:37:12] in this little church
[1:37:14] if there be any rumor of evil moving
[1:37:18] you need to stop it and don't let
[1:37:21] anybody move you should be because
[1:37:23] that's the spirit of the mennonites
[1:37:25] it's here to call strife and when strife
[1:37:29] is uh among us is that right
[1:37:32] the bible tells us amen when when when
[1:37:35] we war against us
[1:37:36] each other every evil work is present
[1:37:39] every evil work
[1:37:42] and so we must fight to keep the unity
[1:37:47] of the spirit in this church you
[1:37:50] understand me
[1:37:51] you gotta fight
[1:37:54] we should never allow anybody to speak
[1:37:57] evil of your pastor your deacon your
[1:38:00] trusty or the musicians
[1:38:01] nobody i don't care if they're a door
[1:38:04] keeper
[1:38:07] this is your house now there are things
[1:38:09] i can say to my wife
[1:38:10] that nobody else better not say and
[1:38:13] there are things she can say to me
[1:38:15] nobody else can say all right can you
[1:38:18] imagine somebody come up to wife let me
[1:38:19] let me tell you about your husband
[1:38:22] make sure you got it filmed
[1:38:26] you understand me because you and i must
[1:38:28] understand
[1:38:29] amen every man will protect his own
[1:38:32] and the bible says a wise woman
[1:38:35] buildeth her house this is a church this
[1:38:39] is a church
[1:38:40] likened unto a woman and you must
[1:38:43] understand
[1:38:44] it's your duty to make sure that this
[1:38:48] fellowship is built correctly amen
[1:38:51] it's your duty let's move on
[1:38:55] one more looking unto jesus right let me
[1:38:58] let me
[1:38:59] let me move back here wherefore go to
[1:39:01] the cloud of witnesses let us lay aside
[1:39:03] every weight
[1:39:03] and the sin which does so easily beside
[1:39:05] us and let us run with patience
[1:39:08] patience patience patience
[1:39:11] patience the race that is set before us
[1:39:15] i think we forget that word patience
[1:39:20] [Music]
[1:39:21] god do it for me
[1:39:24] and do it quickly show me
[1:39:28] anywhere he ever did anything quickly
[1:39:32] huh even with gideon god could have
[1:39:35] wiped out the many nights
[1:39:36] but god put gideon through all of that
[1:39:41] i want to say stuff but that ain't the
[1:39:42] right word all of those trials
[1:39:46] because he knew what it was going to
[1:39:47] take for gideon to really become a
[1:39:48] believer
[1:39:50] it took gideon for real to hear the
[1:39:53] enemy
[1:39:54] talk about how great god was his own god
[1:39:57] they're back in the enemy camp selling
[1:40:00] telling
[1:40:01] telling talking to each other about how
[1:40:03] great gideon god
[1:40:04] is now if the sinners know it
[1:40:09] it's about time for us to wake up
[1:40:13] looking unto jesus the author and
[1:40:15] finisher of our faith
[1:40:17] who for the joy that was set before him
[1:40:19] endured the cross
[1:40:21] despising the shame and is set down at
[1:40:24] the right hand
[1:40:25] of the throne of god when you think your
[1:40:29] suffering
[1:40:30] for consider him that endures such
[1:40:32] contradiction of sinners
[1:40:34] against himself lest ye be weary and
[1:40:37] thanked in your minds
[1:40:38] ye have not yet resisted unto blood
[1:40:42] striving against sin
[1:40:44] and ye have forgotten the exhortation
[1:40:46] which speaketh unto you as into
[1:40:48] children by sons my son despise
[1:40:53] not thou the chastity of the lord
[1:40:56] nor faint when thou are rebuked of him
[1:40:59] now and i'mma close on this because
[1:41:02] sometimes we think
[1:41:04] oh the devil is no no sometimes god is
[1:41:07] rebuking
[1:41:09] and we need to find out which it is
[1:41:13] when you know you've done wrong and
[1:41:15] something wrong goes around come around
[1:41:17] don't worry about it just say thank you
[1:41:20] jesus
[1:41:21] and hallelujah anyhow
[1:41:25] because it's all for your good
[1:41:27] everything's working for your good
[1:41:29] but a real son and daughter of god will
[1:41:30] never run away from him
[1:41:32] they run to him whenever they chase
[1:41:35] right even the bible says look look look
[1:41:38] look at they have
[1:41:39] they haven't been the worst king amen
[1:41:42] that israel ever had
[1:41:44] and i rebuked him and abe ahab repents
[1:41:47] before god
[1:41:49] look at him
[1:41:53] god is a real stubborn person when they
[1:41:55] don't want to repent
[1:41:57] but may god have us help us because god
[1:41:59] knows how to
[1:42:01] make that happen amen you love the lord
[1:42:04] i just want to give a word of
[1:42:06] encouragement i'm working on a
[1:42:08] a real good message for sunday and
[1:42:12] i trust the lord allow me to speak it if
[1:42:14] it's his will
[1:42:16] um i'm not going to tell you what it is
[1:42:17] but it i trust
[1:42:19] that we have a good service i mean
[1:42:22] i know this sunday will be a holiday
[1:42:25] and people are going to go off and do
[1:42:28] what they got to do and
[1:42:29] and um i'm not gonna charge them
[1:42:33] i'm not you know we've been locked up by
[1:42:35] kobe so long
[1:42:37] we all need a break sometimes but uh
[1:42:40] so anyway but i trust that they come
[1:42:43] i've got
[1:42:44] by god's grace some things that i've
[1:42:46] been working on and studying and
[1:42:48] trusting that the lord will bring it to
[1:42:50] a place where i can pull it all together
[1:42:52] it's not my thoughts they're his
[1:42:54] thoughts but i believe that it'll be a
[1:42:56] blessing to the bride of jesus christ
[1:42:59] and i i'm gonna keep working on this
[1:43:01] higher plane
[1:43:03] here the spirit of your mind
[1:43:06] right the spirit of your mind let this
[1:43:10] mind be in you we've got to come to
[1:43:13] because i'm going to tell you something
[1:43:14] if you don't allow god to bring you to
[1:43:17] this place
[1:43:18] satan is going to make havoc out of you
[1:43:22] hallelujah you ever seen a mice
[1:43:26] being caught by a uh a cat
[1:43:29] ever seen it and the cat will play with
[1:43:32] the mice slap
[1:43:33] him everywhere do whatever he wants
[1:43:35] until he's ready to eat him
[1:43:39] and that's the way the devil does if he
[1:43:41] catches you he gonna play with you and
[1:43:44] throw you up against the wall and do all
[1:43:45] kinds of stuff to you
[1:43:47] and then he will devour you
[1:43:50] if somebody don't come rescued that's
[1:43:53] what the devil does
[1:43:54] i've seen people who who come to christ
[1:43:57] god deliver them from drugs and
[1:43:59] alcohol they can all kinds of stuff and
[1:44:02] they forget
[1:44:04] where they came from
[1:44:10] all it takes is one
[1:44:13] pause is that right
[1:44:16] that's exactly what brother adam said
[1:44:19] said oh
[1:44:20] nell she paused for a moment
[1:44:24] thought about how it was in that old
[1:44:27] life to dance on that floor the next
[1:44:28] thing she knew she was in somebody's arm
[1:44:31] not realizing and i didn't read that
[1:44:34] quote but i wanted to read it
[1:44:35] there's influences from both sides
[1:44:37] either from heaven or hell
[1:44:39] and she did not understand that that
[1:44:41] influence was not of god
[1:44:43] until she got on the floor and you can't
[1:44:46] tell me that nell knew she had a demon
[1:44:48] i don't believe she did but she knew she
[1:44:51] needed to repent
[1:44:52] brother bill brother bill right
[1:44:55] it was when god when he began to pray is
[1:44:58] when nell realized it wasn't just her
[1:45:00] feelings
[1:45:01] there was an influence of a demon that
[1:45:03] had her go do that
[1:45:05] and he occupied her until brother
[1:45:07] branham cast the demon out
[1:45:11] you love the lord understand that every
[1:45:14] influence whether be of god or whether
[1:45:16] it be of the of the devil
[1:45:18] amen the purpose for the influence is to
[1:45:20] find a doorway into your spirit
[1:45:23] let's stand

[1:55:27] i don't want anybody to think that my
[1:55:28] wife is a mean woman or something
[1:55:31] i used her for an example but she's
[1:55:33] never had to defend me like that
[1:55:36] and i trust by god's grace we'll never
[1:55:38] have to do that you know sometimes we
[1:55:40] are we
[1:55:40] we can be sensitive to things and you
[1:55:43] know i
[1:55:43] try my best not to use anybody for an
[1:55:46] example because
[1:55:48] it kind of puts them on the spot so
[1:55:50] forgive me if i did wrong there
[1:55:52] but anyway let us pray i thank god for
[1:55:57] the services we thank god for all of you
[1:56:01] who did come out to the house of god
[1:56:04] i trust the word was a blessing to you
[1:56:07] i know that i needed encouragement
[1:56:09] myself today
[1:56:11] i go through trials just like everybody
[1:56:13] else
[1:56:14] you know but when god comes down
[1:56:17] and shows you exactly why you're having
[1:56:20] the troubles that you're having
[1:56:23] again you begin to understand you're not
[1:56:25] putting god first
[1:56:27] sometimes we think we are and then god
[1:56:29] has to show you
[1:56:30] you're not putting me first there's a
[1:56:33] will there that you're performing and
[1:56:35] it's not mine
[1:56:37] and this is what god revealed to me and
[1:56:39] he showed me by god's grace that
[1:56:41] i'm an ambassador not only just me but
[1:56:44] all of us are
[1:56:45] and each moment that we get the chance
[1:56:48] to
[1:56:49] tell somebody about our place we need to
[1:56:53] do so
[1:56:55] and show them that it's free of charge
[1:56:57] there's no
[1:56:58] fees of interest when you get in
[1:57:02] you approach the gate the price has
[1:57:04] already been paid
[1:57:06] and so i thank god for this amazing man
