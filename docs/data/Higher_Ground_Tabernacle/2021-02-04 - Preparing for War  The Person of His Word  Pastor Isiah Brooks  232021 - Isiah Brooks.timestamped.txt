[32:15] isaiah 54 and 17 which is a familiar
[32:18] scripture
[32:20] all of us should be familiar with it

[32:25] become familiar with it after tonight
[32:29] we love the lord appreciate all that
[32:31] he's doing

[33:07] we we thank god for who he is
[33:12] and perhaps tonight we gotta we'll
[33:14] realize what we're working with
[33:16] sometimes we think that when we work for
[33:19] god we're working with a little tool or
[33:21] something in our hands
[33:23] but it's greater than that god will
[33:26] never send
[33:27] someone who is not capable
[33:30] of coming back with the victory
[33:35] because he's a victorious god and if
[33:37] anybody gonna
[33:38] if he's gonna send anyone out there to
[33:41] do his bidding or to do his battle
[33:43] they will always come back victorious
[33:46] isaiah 54
[33:47] 17 no weapon

[33:52] prosper
[33:54] and every tongue that shall rise up
[33:56] against thee and judgment
[33:58] thou shalt condemn this

[34:08] heritage
[34:09] and their righteousness this the part i
[34:11] like

[34:35] verse
[34:37] in the beginning was the word and the
[34:39] word
[34:40] was with god and the word was god
[34:43] the same was in the beginning with god
[34:47] all things were made by him
[34:51] and without him was not anything made
[34:55] that was made let us pray

[35:03] your mercy
[35:04] we thank you for all that you do and has
[35:07] everything you've done for us
[35:09] lord the ending has not been
[35:14] seen as the
[35:17] scripture says that glory has not yet
[35:21] been revealed
[35:23] those things which you have prepared for
[35:25] us
[35:26] and i pray lord tonight that you would
[35:29] have thine own way
[35:31] bless each and every heart tonight those
[35:34] of us who are
[35:37] on the youtube i pray that god will have
[35:39] mercy and bless you
[35:41] we asked these things in your name jesus
[35:44] christ we pray
[35:45] amen you may be seated
[35:48] i know there was a few announcements
[35:51] made
[35:52] uh by god's grace and one of the
[35:55] announcements that i want to reiterate
[35:57] is the
[35:58] announcement uh dealing with the pastor
[36:00] and his son
[36:01] we'd like to invite those who are on the
[36:03] youtube um
[36:06] uh if you desire to give please do
[36:09] and we'll make sure that we give you a
[36:12] statement of
[36:13] of your receipts um
[36:17] by god's grace we will put the church's
[36:20] address
[36:21] down so if you would like to mail it to
[36:23] this particular place
[36:24] we would appreciate it and we have two
[36:26] weeks that we're working with
[36:28] in order to help our brother
[36:32] and their family and i want you to
[36:34] consider this because here it is a
[36:36] pastor y'all know how we work
[36:39] a pastor and his son died i learned
[36:42] today that his whole family
[36:44] his wife and all had coveted
[36:48] and two of them died
[36:52] which is the pastor and of course
[36:54] there's no one else in the church to run
[36:56] the church but the pastor
[36:58] he was the only one he leaves us
[37:01] a son and i believe another daughter
[37:05] but uh anyway we pray that you would uh
[37:08] god will touch your heart to give and we
[37:10] can assure you that every
[37:12] dime every penny that is given will be
[37:15] uh
[37:15] sent to them we appreciate that i don't
[37:18] normally do that
[37:19] i just feel moved because i'm a pastor
[37:24] and i know if something would happen to
[37:26] me and
[37:27] i don't know how that would be but i
[37:30] trust that
[37:31] god would open somebody else's heart to
[37:33] help us we're living in that day where
[37:35] we need to pull together
[37:37] and help each other anyhow you love the
[37:39] lord
[37:41] all right we're going to be coming from
[37:42] the scripture isaiah 54
[37:46] and we know by god's grace uh we're
[37:48] talking about
[37:49] war
[37:55] the thing is i think oftentimes we don't
[37:58] know what a real war is some of us have
[38:02] had little battles and fights in our
[38:04] minds
[38:05] but most of us have never been into like
[38:08] a real war
[38:09] of physical fighting where there's real
[38:12] killing and
[38:13] and dismemberment and things of that
[38:15] nature like world war one and world war
[38:17] ii
[38:19] and even those who came back from
[38:21] vietnam war
[38:22] many of them are psychologically
[38:25] disturbed
[38:26] because of the things that they saw and
[38:28] the things that they had witnessed
[38:31] it is something that will affect you uh
[38:34] for a long time except god have mercy
[38:39] when we talk about war we're talking
[38:41] about a conflict
[38:42] that's carried on by force of
[38:46] arms as between nations
[38:49] or between parties or within a nation
[38:53] uh warfare and it sounds like the united
[38:57] states when i read this description
[39:00] because there are warfares between
[39:03] things people are fighting and
[39:05] uh forces are or has armed themselves
[39:09] one against the other just a ball of
[39:12] confusion you asked me
[39:14] but we know that none of this existed
[39:18] in the beginning we know that the first
[39:21] battle ever that did take place
[39:25] uh was during the time of lucifer
[39:28] and lucifer wanted a greater kingdom
[39:31] than micah
[39:33] and lucifer means angel of light
[39:36] and michael means who is like god
[39:40] and there was a great battle going on
[39:45] because even lucifer is still doing the
[39:47] same thing
[39:49] uh now that he did in the beginning
[39:52] because the bible said he will disguise
[39:54] himself
[39:55] as an angel of light meaning that he'll
[39:58] come
[39:59] in the form of god meaning that he will
[40:02] deceive many by way by his way of lies
[40:06] and influence
[40:08] and if you understand uh uh what we're
[40:11] talking about
[40:12] you must understand that there is one
[40:14] tactic of the devil
[40:17] and that tactic will never change
[40:20] he he his tactic is that he
[40:24] calls his men to reason
[40:29] he he made adam and eve fall by way of
[40:33] reasoning and that would always be his
[40:36] way
[40:37] because there's nothing greater than the
[40:39] word
[40:40] that's right nothing greater and he
[40:42] can't go beyond that he can't go higher
[40:44] than that
[40:45] but one thing that lucifer does and can
[40:48] do
[40:49] is that he can pervert it by way of his
[40:52] reasoning
[40:54] i want to note something to you tonight
[40:58] faith cometh by hearing and hearing of
[41:00] the word of god
[41:02] and as he was the word in the beginning
[41:05] was the word
[41:06] that logos that went out of god
[41:10] and the word was made flesh and dwelt
[41:13] among us he was the word
[41:16] of god manifested on the earth
[41:21] my sub topic amen was the
[41:24] person of the word because i think that
[41:27] sometimes
[41:28] people think that this is all god
[41:32] well it is in letter form but the bible
[41:36] declares that he is a spirit
[41:39] and they that worship him must worship
[41:41] him in spirit and in truth
[41:44] and we know what his spirit is the
[41:46] spirit is the holy ghost the holy spirit
[41:48] and his truth is the word amen amen
[41:52] so we know that there is no weapon
[41:54] formed against those who are elected and
[41:56] chosen by god
[41:58] is that right but we need to know really
[42:01] who he
[42:02] is and the bible said he is the word
[42:05] but let's back it up a little bit
[42:07] because before he was the word
[42:10] amen he was what we call the logos the
[42:13] spirit of the word
[42:14] but before he was the logos he was
[42:17] elohim
[42:18] and understand he never changes his
[42:21] nature
[42:22] that's why the bible calls jesus christ
[42:25] the only
[42:26] potentate he really is the only power
[42:30] and everything else are you know of
[42:33] is faking it y'all understand me because
[42:36] even when jesus was raised from the dead
[42:38] the bible said all power in heaven and
[42:42] in earth was given unto him now to bring
[42:45] us to a place where we know
[42:47] what we've got on our side better yet
[42:50] say who we have
[42:51] on our side the bible says all things
[42:54] were made by him
[42:56] and without him was not anything made
[42:59] that was made now understand what i'm
[43:02] talking about
[43:03] this this elohim
[43:06] amen condescended into what we call
[43:09] the logos right because remember
[43:13] elohim means self-existing one
[43:16] he had no beginning of days nor ending
[43:19] he was just god it is a mystery that we
[43:22] cannot
[43:23] wrap our minds around because we're
[43:25] finite
[43:26] and he's infinite hallelujah he feels
[43:30] all space and time hallelujah
[43:34] amen he's creator of all space and time
[43:37] hallelujah amen so you and i must
[43:40] understand
[43:41] amen that he is amen
[43:45] the almighty god
[43:48] now even in the book of revelation
[43:51] it describes him after he had conquered
[43:55] death hell in the grave and the
[43:56] resurrection had taken place and
[43:58] now he's getting ready to set upon his
[44:00] throne we're going to crown
[44:02] him amen and in revelation 4 and 11 it
[44:06] says
[44:06] thou art worthy o lord to receive glory
[44:10] and honor and power for thou has created
[44:13] all things for thy pleasure
[44:17] they are and were created what are you
[44:20] talking about
[44:21] i'm saying everything that has been
[44:23] created
[44:24] god created it and it
[44:28] it's it was all for his pleasure
[44:32] god is a god of contrast amen he can't
[44:35] show that he's almighty
[44:37] until he's uh until you see something
[44:40] that is not mighty hallelujah he can't
[44:44] show that he's a healer until somebody
[44:46] is sick
[44:47] so you understand he created all of
[44:50] these things
[44:51] because there were attributes on the
[44:53] inside of him that he wanted
[44:55] to display but the part that i'm getting
[44:58] to is that
[44:58] he was a father and the only way you can
[45:01] be a father
[45:02] is that you have to have a family
[45:05] hallelujah
[45:06] and the only way that he could have a
[45:08] family is that he had to give birth to
[45:10] it
[45:11] he had to bring it forth hallelujah yes
[45:14] sir
[45:15] one way or the other is that right and
[45:18] so we
[45:18] see that satan like i said satan tactics
[45:23] is in this warfare is reasoning
[45:27] right and we know our enemy
[45:31] coming from the message putting on the
[45:33] whole arm of god
[45:35] he said maybe you didn't get it right
[45:38] the way i
[45:38] said it we know our enemy
[45:42] he says when anyone any spirit any
[45:45] person
[45:46] tries to disagree with god's word
[45:49] remember that's your enemy
[45:53] that's your enemy we know his old
[45:56] tactics
[45:58] that's the one he broke the human race
[46:00] down
[46:01] and that's the way he breaks them down
[46:03] yet today
[46:04] and that's the way he gets you away from
[46:06] god
[46:08] is to disbelieve his word and the only
[46:11] way that you can
[46:12] ever stay in fellowship with god and
[46:15] talk to him in the cool of the evening
[46:18] is stay
[46:19] fortified in the word on both sides
[46:23] right let the curtain of god word drop
[46:28] all around you and you'll be uh
[46:31] dropped right in the middle of it he
[46:34] said then
[46:35] you are fortified in other words amen
[46:39] we know that in a natural army
[46:43] when men before they go to battle they
[46:45] must train
[46:47] you know even in my mind we talk about
[46:50] training but
[46:51] but in reality when it comes to
[46:54] training god only trains us like a tutor
[46:57] or a child
[46:59] amen until we're formed into his
[47:01] complete image
[47:02] but when we come into the complete image
[47:04] of god there is no more
[47:06] training right
[47:09] because you got to understand by god's
[47:11] grace something takes place
[47:15] when it comes when you come to your
[47:17] maturity
[47:18] it's like the adoption it's no longer
[47:24] praying to god in that sense because
[47:27] god has given you the authority to speak
[47:31] the word
[47:32] so much say so much so he said
[47:34] whatsoever you
[47:35] say amen right he said if you say to
[47:39] this mountain
[47:40] be thou move that mountain must move
[47:43] now i'm going to tell you and show you
[47:45] what that's all about in just a moment
[47:47] because this is not about human flesh
[47:50] it's not mind over matter it's something
[47:54] greater than that we see it it's in the
[47:57] word
[47:58] but we must believe it not with the mind
[48:01] but with the heart see
[48:05] we know i i've been military and and
[48:08] i've had to go through basic training
[48:09] and we know how difficult it can be and
[48:12] you know the
[48:12] the the sergeant don't care how tired
[48:15] you get
[48:17] matter of fact if you complain about
[48:19] being tired he might tell you to do 50
[48:21] push-ups
[48:23] and normally when you get in trouble the
[48:26] whole
[48:27] crew gets in trouble so
[48:30] it is a thing that you learn that if i
[48:32] mess up
[48:34] in such a way everybody has to pay for
[48:37] it
[48:38] that's just like the body of christ
[48:40] right
[48:41] when a can messed up the whole camp had
[48:44] to pay for it
[48:46] right now he doesn't go before us
[48:49] as the prophet of god says in this last
[48:51] battle
[48:52] jesus christ does not go before us
[48:58] he goes in us
[49:02] why because ye are the housing if i
[49:04] could say like that
[49:05] the temple of god and the bible said
[49:08] christ
[49:09] in you you christ in you
[49:13] is the hope of glory this is why the
[49:15] scripture tells us
[49:17] to girdle up the loins of our mind that
[49:20] is that right not the mind here but the
[49:24] mind of the heart
[49:25] because it's in the heart man thinketh
[49:29] hallelujah you love the lord we're
[49:32] preparing for battle but
[49:33] how are we going to prepare brother
[49:35] brooks
[49:36] we've got an enemy coming at us
[49:40] there and there's no way we could defeat
[49:43] this enemy in the flesh
[49:46] is that right you say what are you
[49:48] saying remember
[49:50] peter had been with jesus for three
[49:52] years and a half
[49:55] and when jesus told peter you're going
[49:57] to deny me thrice
[50:00] before the crow peter says no
[50:03] sir i'll never do it
[50:07] but we know for a fact that before the
[50:09] throat
[50:10] crowed thrice and then peter denied
[50:13] jesus even swore about it
[50:18] hallelujah he was lacking something
[50:22] even though he was a believer he was a
[50:25] lacking courage
[50:27] hallelujah is that right he was afraid
[50:31] of the pressure
[50:32] the pressure got to him hallelujah when
[50:35] that lady says
[50:36] aren't you one of them he says no i'm
[50:39] not
[50:41] what was it he was but he did not have
[50:45] the power of courage
[50:47] y'all hear me now he denied christ amen
[50:50] amen but it was his spirit but he needed
[50:54] a change to take place see you can be
[50:56] justified
[50:58] you can be sanctified you can be
[51:00] anointed with the holy ghost we're not
[51:01] talking about anointing we're talking
[51:03] about filled with the holy ghost that
[51:04] makes the difference
[51:06] anybody can be anointed is that right i
[51:09] believe it was herod that prophesied
[51:11] that one should die for the other
[51:14] hallelujah see but we must understand
[51:17] that we're preparing
[51:19] there's a pro there's a there's
[51:20] something coming amen and understand
[51:22] this
[51:23] even even uh jacob knew he couldn't
[51:27] fight the battle that was coming
[51:29] jacob had the blessing
[51:32] the promise but there was still
[51:35] something
[51:36] lacking in jacob and that was a nature
[51:38] change
[51:40] hallelujah he saw he saw coming he knew
[51:43] he saw it was coming
[51:44] and the fear that that enveloped him
[51:49] made him do stupid stuff he sent his
[51:52] family he sent his wives he sent his
[51:54] children
[51:55] amen to meet the enemy hallelujah
[52:00] amen glory to god
[52:03] but he didn't have what it that hour was
[52:07] requiring
[52:08] or calling for but one thing he knew he
[52:11] knew he didn't have the goods
[52:14] hallelujah it is not enough to have the
[52:17] promise of this
[52:18] message it's not even enough amen to
[52:21] to have that blessing spoken over you
[52:23] which the preachers always do
[52:26] you got to know him for yourself
[52:30] hallelujah and jacob knew better
[52:34] he wrestled with the angel
[52:37] maybe it was an all-night prayer but he
[52:39] wouldn't let him go
[52:41] he said lord i'm not gonna let you go
[52:43] until you bless me
[52:45] i'm getting ready to fight esau and i
[52:48] know i need your authority and power
[52:51] backing me amen
[52:54] hallelujah the great and mighty
[52:58] conqueror 1957.
[53:00] he said then he came he came down
[53:02] because
[53:04] talking about god he was in the
[53:06] beginning
[53:07] i'm trying to give you something tonight
[53:09] and i hope you catch it i don't know the
[53:11] bible says it's not something deep it's
[53:12] just
[53:13] something simple that has always been
[53:15] with us
[53:16] he was the word he was the logos that
[53:19] went out of god
[53:21] and the logos in the beginning was the
[53:23] word and he became the word
[53:25] and then when he ascended up on that
[53:28] glorious day of easter
[53:30] he become not only the word but he
[53:33] become the high priest
[53:35] of his own word hello how can you lose
[53:40] if he's a high priest amen of his own
[53:44] word hallelujah
[53:47] oh what a glorious thing just think
[53:51] he's not only the word but he is the
[53:53] high priest of his own word how could he
[53:56] doubt it
[53:57] how could we talk to walk to him and not
[54:00] believe that we receive what he asked
[54:02] for
[54:03] he is the word and the intercessor of
[54:05] the word
[54:07] let me say it like this he's the high
[54:08] priest of his word how can he doubt his
[54:11] word
[54:12] he cannot hallelujah
[54:15] and that high priest will make sure that
[54:18] the word
[54:19] is made manifest hallelujah
[54:23] yes and that same flesh that was in the
[54:25] word
[54:26] received up into glory and now is a high
[54:29] priest
[54:30] making intercessions by himself to his
[54:33] word
[54:34] this is why we pray to jesus christ this
[54:37] is why we don't pray to buddha our lives
[54:39] something like father son and holy ghost
[54:41] only it is in
[54:43] by the name of jesus every knee shall
[54:45] bow
[54:46] every tongue shall confess at the name
[54:48] of jesus demons tremble
[54:51] this is who we pray to amen
[54:55] there is no other name that salvation
[54:58] can come through
[55:00] that's what it takes that's the matter
[55:03] that the church has got
[55:05] material excuse me that the church is
[55:07] god think about it what weapon
[55:11] what weapon i asked the question again
[55:14] what weapon formed against you can
[55:17] prosper
[55:18] there's never been one like it
[55:22] it was the word and when he comes
[55:25] he has bought he was born in a manger he
[55:28] come to see the weapon of love
[55:30] amen to conquer the world not with
[55:34] army bullets not with machine guns and
[55:37] tanks
[55:38] but he come into a different manner he
[55:41] come
[55:41] in the form of love he was
[55:45] god's love so you understand me
[55:48] if the alpha has become the omega amen
[55:52] the only way to conquer the devil in
[55:55] this hour
[55:57] is love not yours
[56:00] his love that's the only way
[56:04] that is why we've got such confusion
[56:06] going on
[56:07] fights in the battles and the family
[56:10] battles in the kingdom
[56:11] battles on the job battles everywhere
[56:13] amen and god says
[56:14] love them you must love you must learn
[56:18] to love your enemy you conquer by love
[56:21] amen is that right and the word
[56:26] god understand what i'm saying we've got
[56:28] to stop
[56:29] thinking that the word is separate from
[56:32] god
[56:33] amen the word is god
[56:37] if you can really see it you understand
[56:40] when you speak that word
[56:41] amen that's god you're bringing on the
[56:44] scene
[56:46] once it comes out it cannot come back
[56:48] void
[56:49] as long as that word is mixed with faith
[56:53] amen hallelujah and the word will defeat
[56:56] the devil
[56:57] anywhere anytime under any condition
[57:02] jesus proved it when he defeated satan
[57:06] not using his power but just on the word
[57:09] of the father
[57:10] it is written and he defeated him
[57:16] hallelujah you don't need no feelings
[57:19] you don't need no emotions the word is
[57:22] god
[57:23] speak the word and the word will defeat
[57:26] your enemy
[57:27] we don't have to be like the
[57:29] pentecostals oh i felt goosebumps oh
[57:31] i shouted or i speak with tongues none
[57:34] of that
[57:34] is needful when you speak in the word
[57:38] y'all understand me i didn't say do away
[57:40] with it
[57:41] i said but when the word is being spoken
[57:44] because you can manifest
[57:45] all those kinds of things and yet not
[57:48] have faith in what you just spoke
[57:52] you have to have faith in this thing
[57:54] hallelujah
[57:55] it is the only thing that pleases god
[57:59] i feel like shouting right now right
[58:02] psalm 61 beginning at the first verse
[58:05] amen hear my cry oh god attend unto my
[58:09] prayer
[58:10] from the end of the earth will i cry
[58:12] unto thee
[58:14] when my heart is overwhelmed lead me to
[58:17] the rock
[58:18] that is higher than i you know when i
[58:20] was in denominations
[58:22] i used to envision this big old rock
[58:25] that ain't what he's talking about lead
[58:27] me to that revelation
[58:30] that is higher than i is that right he
[58:32] told peter
[58:33] he said when peter said thou art the
[58:36] christ the son of the living god
[58:38] he said upon this rock i'll build my
[58:41] church
[58:42] what was he working with the revelation
[58:44] of who jesus
[58:45] is see he that coming to god must first
[58:48] believe that he is god
[58:50] and that he's a rewarder of them that
[58:52] diligence he came you got to believe
[58:54] he's god
[58:55] and you got to believe that this word is
[58:57] the absolute
[58:59] hallelujah from the end of the rap
[59:02] listen
[59:02] when the devil know you believe he
[59:05] leaves
[59:09] when he sees that you're not moving off
[59:11] that word
[59:12] the devil leaves why because there's a
[59:14] word
[59:15] if you resist the devil he'll flee from
[59:18] you
[59:19] and how do you resist him by speaking
[59:21] that word
[59:22] standing on that word even it's a matter
[59:24] of life and death
[59:25] that's what you must do
[59:29] hallelujah for how for thou has
[59:32] been a shelter for me and a strong tower
[59:36] from my enemy hallelujah when i need
[59:39] somewhere to hide
[59:40] i run to the rock hallelujah in times of
[59:43] tribulation
[59:44] i go to the rock hallelujah when there's
[59:48] no food on the table
[59:49] i go to the rock what is that rock my
[59:53] revelation
[59:54] and who is my revelation jesus christ is
[59:57] god
[59:59] hallelujah proverbs 18 10 says the name
[1:00:02] of the lord is a strong tower
[1:00:04] the righteous runneth into it and is
[1:00:07] what safe
[1:00:09] hallelujah no weapon formed against you
[1:00:12] can prosper
[1:00:13] what are you talking about brother
[1:00:14] brooks you'll see it's not
[1:00:16] long uh the future holds it
[1:00:19] y'all understand me amen because you
[1:00:22] watch this confusion turn
[1:00:24] toward the christian and you better know
[1:00:26] you got your goods
[1:00:30] you might think i'm crazy preaching like
[1:00:32] this but it's the truth anyhow
[1:00:34] amen you got to realize amen that
[1:00:35] anytime communism moved into a country
[1:00:38] the first they persecuted was the
[1:00:41] christians
[1:00:43] we don't have to worry about that though
[1:00:44] but i'm just saying
[1:00:46] listen in this army you can't practice
[1:00:51] it's not opening up a witchcraft book or
[1:00:54] something and you got a wand and
[1:00:56] trying to practice the voodoo you don't
[1:00:59] practice this
[1:01:01] not the power of god you cannot
[1:01:04] hallelujah it can't be given to you as
[1:01:07] the practice
[1:01:08] remember simeon said simon said uh to
[1:01:11] peter them
[1:01:12] can i buy this you can't even buy it
[1:01:17] hallelujah the only way that just this
[1:01:20] works for you you must be born into it
[1:01:24] hallelujah listen and even having faith
[1:01:27] doesn't make it all together just right
[1:01:30] because many people have faith
[1:01:34] to do exploits yet they don't know god
[1:01:38] nor do they love god because they come
[1:01:41] in the last day
[1:01:42] and they said father have not we done
[1:01:45] many miracles in your name and jesus
[1:01:49] says
[1:01:50] depart from me you worker of iniquity
[1:01:53] i don't even know you see there must
[1:01:56] come a
[1:01:56] union between you and divine
[1:02:00] love hallelujah and this is uniting
[1:02:03] signs in time
[1:02:04] everything is uniting so it is our
[1:02:07] evidence that god
[1:02:09] is uniting himself with his bride
[1:02:15] no practicing no mind over matter
[1:02:19] this is a kingdom with the king
[1:02:24] is that right and who is our king maybe
[1:02:27] the world don't know it yet
[1:02:29] but the bible tells us who our king is
[1:02:31] hallelujah
[1:02:33] he's the same king he always have been
[1:02:36] hallelujah he's the king of glory
[1:02:39] the king of honor the king of splendor
[1:02:43] he's the king of everything and everyone
[1:02:46] and everybody
[1:02:48] hallelujah when jesus was on the earth
[1:02:53] saint john 18 beginning at the 36th
[1:02:55] verse
[1:02:56] he was asked a question several
[1:02:58] questions
[1:02:59] uh by pilate
[1:03:02] and jesus answered pilate my kingdom is
[1:03:06] not of this world
[1:03:08] if my kingdom were of the world
[1:03:11] then would my servants fight
[1:03:14] that i should not be delivered to the
[1:03:17] jews
[1:03:18] but now is my kingdom not from his in
[1:03:21] other words it's coming
[1:03:22] but now it's not from hence amen
[1:03:26] pilate therefore said unto him art thou
[1:03:29] art king then and jesus answered thou
[1:03:32] saith that i am a king to this end was i
[1:03:36] born and for this cause
[1:03:37] came i unto the world that i should bear
[1:03:41] witness
[1:03:42] unto the what truth and everyone that
[1:03:46] is of the truth heareth my voice
[1:03:50] now he's made us king and priests
[1:03:54] hallelujah you can't be a king without a
[1:03:56] kingdom amen
[1:03:58] hallelujah and if he made us priests
[1:04:01] that means that he has given us a life
[1:04:03] amen that can handle the blood and the
[1:04:06] bride of jesus christ
[1:04:08] is the blood of jesus christ by the
[1:04:10] spirit
[1:04:12] hallelujah oh what are you saying
[1:04:14] brother books
[1:04:15] amen i don't have a second person in me
[1:04:17] i don't have a
[1:04:18] third person in me i've got the person
[1:04:22] that's where i'm going now let me ask
[1:04:25] you a question
[1:04:26] before i go any further if the almighty
[1:04:29] god who created heaven and earth
[1:04:31] lives in you then what does it make you
[1:04:35] i'll tell you what it makes you it makes
[1:04:37] you what he is
[1:04:39] and he's omnipotent all
[1:04:42] powerful god see we forget because
[1:04:45] sometimes we want to feel it
[1:04:47] amen my heart beats every day but i'm
[1:04:50] not listening to it and neither do i
[1:04:51] feel it
[1:04:53] but it beats and as long as it's beating
[1:04:56] i know
[1:04:56] it's alive hallelujah the moment it
[1:04:59] stopped beating it's the moment i
[1:05:01] stopped living
[1:05:03] that's the way it is and god is eternal
[1:05:06] he never stopped beating
[1:05:08] if you understand what i mean because he
[1:05:10] said if any man believe
[1:05:12] in me though he was dead yet shelley
[1:05:15] lives
[1:05:18] hebrews 12th chapter beginning at the
[1:05:20] first verse
[1:05:22] we're foreseeing we are also encompassed
[1:05:25] about with a greater cloud of witnesses
[1:05:27] we got some folks on our side
[1:05:29] let us lay aside every weight and sin
[1:05:32] which does so easily set
[1:05:34] us and let us run with patience the race
[1:05:37] that is set before what you know what
[1:05:38] he's saying let us lay aside
[1:05:40] all the reasoning all the stuff that
[1:05:43] satan has put in our minds to make us
[1:05:45] reason
[1:05:45] let us lay all of that along because
[1:05:47] understand when you reason
[1:05:49] that's when you fall into sin
[1:05:52] looking unto jesus the author and
[1:05:55] finisher of our faith did he do it
[1:05:57] he began it and he ended it hallelujah
[1:06:00] there was no man worthy to take the book
[1:06:02] he was the only one worthy hallelujah
[1:06:05] and he took the book
[1:06:06] yes hallelujah when he was on calvary
[1:06:11] he said it's finished hallelujah
[1:06:14] ah is that all right we
[1:06:18] know if had he not finished it we all
[1:06:20] would have been lost
[1:06:22] but because he finished it my brother is
[1:06:25] he your brother
[1:06:26] my brother finished it your brother

[1:07:22] adam gave us this house
[1:07:24] but the second adam gives us a house of
[1:07:26] a word
[1:07:27] we call it a theophany body
[1:07:31] looking unto jesus the authentic finish
[1:07:32] of our faith who for the joy that was
[1:07:34] set before him

[1:07:39] and is set down at the right hand of the
[1:07:42] throne of god

[1:07:53] you don't go into a battle amen not
[1:07:55] nowadays with a slingshot
[1:07:57] david did hallelujah
[1:08:00] samson had a jawbone of an ass
[1:08:04] but god gives us a greater weapon and
[1:08:07] that weapon is his word
[1:08:09] hallelujah if you can believe the
[1:08:11] slingshot
[1:08:12] a man killed the giant you know what the
[1:08:15] difference was
[1:08:16] david was anointed it wasn't just his
[1:08:20] effort to kill the giant
[1:08:21] but he had faith and when he had faith
[1:08:24] that anointing who was god
[1:08:26] and then aimed at rock and it hit the
[1:08:29] giant in the head
[1:08:31] so is it with with with the samson
[1:08:34] with the jawbone of an ass it wasn't the
[1:08:36] jawbone that killed the
[1:08:39] the philistines it was god's anointed
[1:08:42] jawbone
[1:08:43] yeah hallelujah it could not break
[1:08:47] it could not diminish it was stronger
[1:08:50] than all the
[1:08:51] armor of the philistines y'all hear what
[1:08:53] i'm saying
[1:08:54] why because it was anointed
[1:08:57] y'all understand me though you be human
[1:08:59] flesh
[1:09:01] when you are anointed you become
[1:09:04] invincible
[1:09:05] all power in heaven and earth is given
[1:09:08] unto you
[1:09:09] hallelujah nothing what are you talking
[1:09:11] about brother brooks
[1:09:12] remember hallelujah when they tried they
[1:09:16] meant to kill
[1:09:17] john and they put john on the outer
[1:09:19] baptism
[1:09:20] they boil a big old bottle of oil
[1:09:23] hallelujah
[1:09:24] they're going to kill him hallelujah but
[1:09:26] john
[1:09:27] be anointed by god he had a mission
[1:09:30] and that was the to write the book of
[1:09:32] revelation
[1:09:34] hallelujah nothing could kill john
[1:09:37] you understand me if that's too too too
[1:09:40] too uh uh too much for you let's go down
[1:09:43] to
[1:09:44] to the fiery furnace they believe god
[1:09:47] they walked into the furnace
[1:09:49] and was not even destroyed the bible
[1:09:52] said not even the fire were sins their
[1:09:54] clothes and there was no smell of it
[1:09:56] even there why there was an anointed
[1:09:58] what anointing
[1:10:00] it wasn't a second person it was god
[1:10:02] himself
[1:10:03] you don't believe that the bible says
[1:10:06] amen when they
[1:10:07] looked amen into the fiery furnace
[1:10:10] they saw one that looked like the son of
[1:10:13] god
[1:10:14] hallelujah what was it it wasn't that he
[1:10:17] he went before them but this time is
[1:10:20] different
[1:10:21] in the time of israel he was above them
[1:10:24] hallelujah yes sir he was with him in
[1:10:28] the old testament
[1:10:29] but this test this part he's not just
[1:10:31] with us above us or before us
[1:10:33] he's in us you are the housing of god
[1:10:36] that's why
[1:10:37] the devil don't want you to get the holy
[1:10:39] ghost
[1:10:41] that's why he don't want you to be
[1:10:42] sealed because once you sealed you are
[1:10:45] an invincible army
[1:10:46] you can never be defeated from that
[1:10:48] point on hallelujah you must be equipped
[1:10:52] hallelujah no listen no nation sends
[1:10:55] anyone to battle

[1:11:03] train and

[1:11:06] know but that ain't the way god
[1:11:08] does it hallelujah
[1:11:11] oh sham god had no training
[1:11:16] he had no training and some god is the
[1:11:19] type of the bride
[1:11:21] hallelujah all she sam god knew is that
[1:11:24] he had a promise and he took
[1:11:26] that thing that was setting before him
[1:11:28] the ox goat
[1:11:29] and he whooped those devils out he was
[1:11:33] tired tired of the devil coming in and
[1:11:36] stealing all of his food and everything
[1:11:38] else and
[1:11:38] leaving his family destitute
[1:11:42] hallelujah somehow we got to get tired
[1:11:44] of the devil
[1:11:45] whipping on us right taken away every
[1:11:48] time you think you got a little money he
[1:11:49] puts a hole in your pocket

[1:11:53] hallelujah fight the devil by the word
[1:11:56] the bible says to the to the believer
[1:11:59] god's will is that you prosper
[1:12:01] even as your soul prosper so you want to
[1:12:04] see yourself naturally prospering
[1:12:06] hallelujah let your soul prosper
[1:12:09] hallelujah your brother adam said it
[1:12:11] like this be equipped
[1:12:13] be ready because you wrestle not against
[1:12:16] flesh and blood
[1:12:18] but against satan god's enemy
[1:12:21] principalities and wickedness and evil
[1:12:24] spirits
[1:12:25] wickedness in high places and we're
[1:12:27] pressing toward the mark
[1:12:29] of the high calling and we're certainly
[1:12:32] in a battle now you hear what i'm saying
[1:12:34] at the same time that god is making us
[1:12:37] into that perfect man
[1:12:38] we are in an intense battle with the
[1:12:41] devil
[1:12:42] with principalities and wickedness and
[1:12:44] everything else
[1:12:45] oh and no nation amen would dare to sin
[1:12:50] a man on a battlefield untrained
[1:12:53] he might not only get himself killed but
[1:12:56] another group
[1:12:57] he doesn't know how to take a hold and
[1:12:59] so he must
[1:13:00] be prepared for it and the nations are
[1:13:03] wise to that
[1:13:04] they get their men ready hey what do you
[1:13:07] mean
[1:13:08] every nation has spies
[1:13:11] american got spies chinese china got
[1:13:14] spies
[1:13:15] iraq and every nation under heaven got
[1:13:17] spies
[1:13:18] and everybody got spies in each other's
[1:13:20] country
[1:13:21] why because they want to check out your
[1:13:23] weaponry
[1:13:25] they want to make sure that if they go
[1:13:27] to battle with you their weaponry will
[1:13:29] be better than yours
[1:13:30] it is a real it's a real deal that's why
[1:13:33] everybody is all in
[1:13:34] in in turmoil right now because
[1:13:37] somewhere
[1:13:38] they don't know who's got the most
[1:13:39] powerful weapon
[1:13:41] and so everybody's afraid to use what
[1:13:44] they got
[1:13:45] because they don't want to destroy the
[1:13:47] world hallelujah
[1:13:48] but god got spies too you call that
[1:13:51] angels
[1:13:53] the bible said amen the angels of the
[1:13:55] lord is in camp about those amen
[1:13:57] that fear him hallelujah listen not just
[1:14:00] angels the bible said these angels are a
[1:14:03] wall of fire
[1:14:05] amen oh glory to god is that all right
[1:14:08] so you and i understand him and we're
[1:14:10] preparing but the devil don't understand
[1:14:12] amen nothing can stop the word of god if
[1:14:16] god is ordained you to be bright
[1:14:18] nothing can stop you no matter what he
[1:14:20] puts before you
[1:14:23] amen you might not be where you want to
[1:14:25] be when you're getting there
[1:14:26] god's gonna make sure you're there
[1:14:28] hallelujah the dog cannot
[1:14:30] shut until you inside hallelujah
[1:14:34] glory to god and you know why
[1:14:38] listen we're putting on the whole armor
[1:14:43] you know many times i thought well i
[1:14:45] gotta have that helmet of faith and this
[1:14:48] and that
[1:14:48] and i'm not even understanding you know
[1:14:51] spiritually what he's talking about
[1:14:54] so you can understand the bible says put
[1:14:58] on christ in simplicity
[1:15:02] put on christ put on the whole arm of
[1:15:05] god
[1:15:06] put on christ
[1:15:09] you know why it's because the whole
[1:15:11] world is controlled by satan
[1:15:14] every kingdom in the world is ruled by
[1:15:16] satan we hate to think that
[1:15:19] but that's the scripture you know the
[1:15:21] enemy's taking our lord up
[1:15:24] into a high exceedingly mounting a sling
[1:15:27] high
[1:15:28] and showed him all the kingdoms of the
[1:15:29] world and said
[1:15:31] they are all mine i'm the rule of them
[1:15:35] i do with them whatever i want to and
[1:15:38] i'll give them to you
[1:15:40] now the devil couldn't offer god jesus
[1:15:42] christ something he didn't have
[1:15:44] but because of the fall adam forfeited
[1:15:48] his inheritance and now it be this is
[1:15:51] satan's eating you know
[1:15:52] and we wonder why everybody is so evil
[1:15:55] and doing so many evil things
[1:15:56] these are his children amen
[1:16:00] they're going to do whatever he wants
[1:16:02] them to do but i want him to know
[1:16:04] that the children of god is going to do
[1:16:06] everything
[1:16:08] god wants us to do amen watch the wisdom
[1:16:11] of the lord jesus
[1:16:13] staying with the word of god hallelujah
[1:16:15] he knew
[1:16:16] he'd fall air to them in the kingdom and
[1:16:20] in the kingdom that is to come in the
[1:16:22] millennium so he said
[1:16:23] get behind satan
[1:16:26] let me ask you a question should we come
[1:16:29] to a time
[1:16:30] when they say except you bow should we
[1:16:33] come to a time
[1:16:34] when they begin to take your house or
[1:16:36] take your car or take your bank account
[1:16:38] or take things away from you
[1:16:40] amen what you going to do cause let me
[1:16:43] tell you something
[1:16:45] naked you came into the world and nick
[1:16:48] is you're going to leave
[1:16:49] the only thing that you're going to take
[1:16:51] is your character
[1:16:53] and don't even dare think amen that
[1:16:56] god's picking on me and i'm the only one
[1:16:58] that's going through this list
[1:17:00] let's go back hallelujah
[1:17:03] let's go back to the dark ages let's go
[1:17:07] back when martyrdom was a common thing
[1:17:10] hallelujah let's go back people of god
[1:17:12] really
[1:17:13] i mean if you think about it we've got
[1:17:15] it easy
[1:17:24] yes sir yes sir now you see satan can do
[1:17:27] with them whatever he wishes to
[1:17:30] these nations were controlled by god
[1:17:33] we'd have no law he said if this nation
[1:17:36] was controlled by god we wouldn't have
[1:17:37] no war
[1:17:38] there would be no more conflict see
[1:17:41] but satan is the rule of every kingdom
[1:17:44] he rules the world
[1:17:46] but someday you see in this in the
[1:17:49] people
[1:17:50] every person is wanting one nation to
[1:17:52] control the world
[1:17:54] want one flag and they want to be the
[1:17:57] most powerful nation
[1:17:58] in the world is that true that's the
[1:18:00] truth
[1:18:01] and take everything under their control
[1:18:04] and make all the rest of the nation
[1:18:06] speak their language
[1:18:08] what is it it only shows that there
[1:18:11] is a such a place in other words there's
[1:18:15] a real to this negative
[1:18:16] there's a positive to this negative
[1:18:19] hallelujah there is a place where
[1:18:21] everybody speaks the same language
[1:18:23] there is a place where there's peace and
[1:18:25] no war no
[1:18:26] conflict there is a place but in this
[1:18:29] kingdom
[1:18:31] jesus christ is lord ephesians 6
[1:18:34] 10 through 17 finally my brother be
[1:18:37] strong in the lord and in the power of
[1:18:39] his might
[1:18:40] put on the whole arm of god that you may
[1:18:41] be able to stand against the wiles of
[1:18:43] the devil
[1:18:44] for we wrestle not against flesh and
[1:18:46] blood but against principality against
[1:18:48] powers against the rulers of darkness of
[1:18:50] this world
[1:18:51] against spiritual wickedness in high
[1:18:52] place wherefore
[1:18:54] taken you the whole arm of god that you
[1:18:56] may be able to withstand in the evil day

[1:19:08] breastplate of righteousness now you've
[1:19:09] got to understand
[1:19:11] this how can i say it

[1:19:18] something coming why would he say when
[1:19:20] you stand stand there for having your
[1:19:22] lawrence girl about with truth
[1:19:24] when you've done all to stand stand

[1:23:20] and michael and his angels against
[1:23:22] lucifer and they were kicked
[1:23:24] out of heaven and then the great army of
[1:23:26] the devil and all the imps

[1:23:30] was going to be a battle let me say this
[1:23:32] this is these are my words
[1:23:34] now if this be true then who are you

[1:23:41] members
[1:23:43] fallen angels those who once worshiped
[1:23:46] god
[1:23:47] but by lucifer's reasoning
[1:23:51] amen he reasoned god right out of their
[1:23:54] minds
[1:23:55] well how do you know because the bible
[1:23:58] said
[1:23:58] god gave them over to a reprobate
[1:24:02] mind those who did not want to
[1:24:05] contain god in their knowledge
[1:24:09] that's the way the angels were in the
[1:24:10] beginning that's the way they are today

[1:24:54] what you gonna say all you can say
[1:24:58] is that yes your record
[1:25:03] i i did that but there's another record
[1:25:07] that counts
[1:25:09] and that's god's record and the blood

[1:25:13] washed me clean
[1:25:16] and i stand before you a perfect
[1:25:20] man they're gonna say he's crazy he's

[1:25:48] i was told that there be i had some
[1:25:52] some things on martin luther king
[1:25:56] threatened him with that he didn't pay
[1:25:58] no attention to him
[1:26:01] y'all understand me
[1:26:04] people follow you you what are you
[1:26:07] talking about
[1:26:10] your phone your car

[1:26:21] credit card in
[1:26:22] they got all your information
[1:26:25] it's a system and the system got you
[1:26:29] paid
[1:26:31] but one thing they don't know is that
[1:26:34] you've been born again
[1:26:36] they don't understand you're not on this
[1:26:38] earth the only man who had a perfect
[1:26:40] record was jesus himself
[1:26:42] hallelujah the bible according to
[1:26:44] revelation 5 said there was no man
[1:26:46] worthy
[1:26:47] so if that be the truth i could never be
[1:26:51] worthy
[1:26:52] but he makes me worthy hallelujah y'all
[1:26:55] love the lord
[1:26:57] amen listen he goes on to say
[1:27:01] and when the devil got a record then you
[1:27:02] know uh uh
[1:27:04] we know we're fighting against and god
[1:27:06] knows there was going to be
[1:27:07] a battle i believe he knows from the
[1:27:10] very beginning everything that we
[1:27:12] would ever be if god is infinite
[1:27:16] he knows every flea that would be on the
[1:27:18] earth every night
[1:27:20] how many times he would bat his eye and
[1:27:22] how much
[1:27:23] taller they all make together he's
[1:27:26] infinite
[1:27:26] so the infinite gods going to choose for
[1:27:29] his army
[1:27:30] the best weapon that could be given
[1:27:34] and he cho he chose it and it was
[1:27:37] his word god gave his army the best
[1:27:40] equipment
[1:27:41] that could ever you they could ever use
[1:27:44] and you ever could use
[1:27:46] and it would never have to be changed
[1:27:49] and he never changed the sense
[1:27:51] you don't have to prove it it remains
[1:27:54] the same
[1:27:55] all the time it's god's word
[1:27:58] that he fortified his people with y'all
[1:28:01] understand what i'm going with
[1:28:02] amen and we keep saying well i've got to
[1:28:05] learn all of this
[1:28:07] get him amen hallelujah
[1:28:10] i may not know all of the book but i
[1:28:13] definitely know the author
[1:28:16] y'all understand me hallelujah
[1:28:19] no matter how many things satan ever
[1:28:21] gets how many things
[1:28:23] any good army ever gets or anything
[1:28:26] can never take the place of god's first
[1:28:28] choice
[1:28:29] his word he gave them his word his
[1:28:31] promise and he said
[1:28:33] stay with it and the best that could be
[1:28:36] done
[1:28:36] right now the enemy knows as long as the
[1:28:39] human race listen
[1:28:40] stays with the word he'll never be able
[1:28:43] to touch him
[1:28:44] amen now i'm beginning to feel religious
[1:28:48] right now
[1:28:48] he said as long as the human race stays
[1:28:51] with the word
[1:28:52] god fortifies his family on the earth
[1:28:55] his army
[1:28:56] in the fort of his word that is our
[1:28:59] fortress
[1:29:00] the name of the lord is a strong is a
[1:29:03] mighty tower
[1:29:04] the righteous run in it and are safe
[1:29:07] they're fortified the lord is the word

[1:29:17] word
[1:29:18] as long as the church stays in the word
[1:29:21] it's fortified
[1:29:22] there's nothing going to bother it
[1:29:25] now i could go on but there's a few more
[1:29:28] things i want to
[1:29:29] read by god's grace
[1:29:32] and i i said that that came up to that
[1:29:34] but i want to say this by god's grace
[1:29:40] because some of us might be concerned
[1:29:43] in the same message i was
[1:29:50] thinking about the lord when he gave me
[1:29:53] this message because he told me what to
[1:29:55] go listen to
[1:29:57] and this is what i found he says while
[1:30:00] we're thinking about communism
[1:30:02] let me give you a little word this is
[1:30:05] going
[1:30:06] to sound strange for a preacher but
[1:30:09] don't you
[1:30:09] never fear anything about communism
[1:30:13] it ain't nothing i want any minister or
[1:30:17] any scripture leader to ever show me in
[1:30:19] the bible
[1:30:20] where communism ruled the world we ain't
[1:30:23] got to worry about china
[1:30:25] china will never rule the world y'all
[1:30:28] hear what i'm saying
[1:30:30] amen but let me move on
[1:30:33] he said i want any minister right
[1:30:37] he said communism will
[1:30:40] in other words you'll never rule the
[1:30:41] world
[1:30:43] romanism is going to rule the world
[1:30:47] according to the bible he said you watch
[1:30:50] that
[1:30:51] don't you think about communism it's
[1:30:54] just
[1:30:54] a puppet in the hand of god to fulfill
[1:30:58] his will
[1:31:00] now i want you to understand because
[1:31:02] when these great companies got with the
[1:31:04] pope
[1:31:05] things changed and that's what that was
[1:31:10] being used by god to do what
[1:31:14] bring america to her knees you
[1:31:18] that's what's going to happen and i
[1:31:20] don't know how
[1:31:21] how long i'm going to stay safe but
[1:31:25] i ain't scared i want you to understand
[1:31:28] i understand who i am
[1:31:30] if i don't know nothing else i do know
[1:31:32] who i
[1:31:33] am amen it's just a puppet in the hands
[1:31:36] of god to
[1:31:37] fulfill his will exactly what he said he
[1:31:40] uses that
[1:31:41] but don't you never worry about
[1:31:43] communism
[1:31:45] it's romanism the bible says there are
[1:31:47] three curtains
[1:31:49] as i leave you this afternoon i leave
[1:31:51] this with you remember
[1:31:52] there's three curtains one of them is
[1:31:55] called the iron curtain
[1:31:56] y'all know who that is one of them is
[1:31:59] the bamboo curtain that was china so
[1:32:01] forth eastern
[1:32:02] and then there's a purple curtain don't
[1:32:04] fear the bamboo curtain
[1:32:06] why is the prophet of god saying that
[1:32:09] in this time he see what was coming up
[1:32:14] hallelujah he said but better be careful
[1:32:18] right he said but be careful of the
[1:32:21] purple one
[1:32:24] and miss purple stood up there
[1:32:30] she stood up there to let you know she's
[1:32:33] in control
[1:32:35] whoo i ain't talking about no woman
[1:32:38] i'm talking about the church
[1:32:42] hallelujah oh the antichrist
[1:32:46] shall be so close to deceive the very
[1:32:49] elected
[1:32:51] if it was possible you know why it's not
[1:32:54] possible
[1:32:55] because god sent us a prophet amen
[1:32:58] hallelujah
[1:32:59] and without a vision the people perish
[1:33:03] hallelujah you love the lord
[1:33:07] oh i'm just going to stop here there's
[1:33:09] other things that i have
[1:33:11] but i'll just leave it there well
[1:33:14] it's just one more quote you don't mind
[1:33:19] he was good with his sword
[1:33:23] talking about peter peter was good with
[1:33:25] his sword he
[1:33:26] he cut that fella y'all that's right
[1:33:29] he could do the creed just as good as

[1:33:36] he didn't have it there i go again
[1:33:39] coming right back down to it
[1:33:41] so he fell right there now why he only
[1:33:44] knowed one thing

[1:34:34] the full
[1:34:35] arm of god for his army that was himself
[1:34:38] among you yes a little while
[1:34:42] and the world seeth me no more yet ye
