[46:56] [Music]
[47:03] [Music]
[47:05] would you hide your servants today
[47:09] [Music]
[47:17] [Applause]
[47:32] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[47:36] amen
[47:38] i greet you in the name of the lord
[47:40] jesus christ
[47:43] i bring you greetings from our home
[47:45] church in alabama
[47:48] brother shelly in all of the
[47:50] congregation
[47:53] i am brother wesley greeley
[47:57] wesley
[47:58] my sweet wife sister joyce is with me
[48:02] and sister josie
[48:03] i'm so grateful that she is traveling
[48:05] with me this time
[48:10] if you have your bibles i would like to
[48:12] read from first kings chapter 19
[48:18] um
[48:25] i would like to wish your pastor a very
[48:27] happy birthday
[48:34] [Applause]
[48:35] it's my honor to be here preaching for
[48:37] him on this his birthday weekend
[48:44] first kings chapter 19. don't worship
[48:46] what
[48:51] i'll read verse 9 and then brother you
[48:54] can read it and he came thither
[48:56] unto a cave
[48:58] and lodged there
[49:00] and behold the word of the lord came to
[49:03] him and he said unto him
[49:06] what doest thou hear elijah elia
[49:14] eternally addressed
[49:19] may the lord add a blessing to the
[49:20] reading of his word you may have your
[49:28] seed let's give a little background here
[49:34] how elijah got to this particular place
[49:40] elijah was the prophet of the lord
[49:54] but he was still the prophet of the lord
[49:58] and it was during the during the reign
[50:01] of ahab
[50:05] the king at the time was ahab the ones
[50:08] who don't like the account and the bible
[50:10] said that as he come to reign
[50:15] that he did worse than all of the kings
[50:18] that were before him
[50:22] and as we look at the history of the
[50:24] kings
[50:26] sometimes we wonder how a man could get
[50:29] any worse than a previous one
[50:35] but the bible said he did more wickedly
[50:38] than all of the previous kings of israel
[50:44] now there was a lot of wickedness that
[50:46] had gone on before
[50:49] and there was a previous king by the
[50:51] name of jeroboam
[51:03] and he was afraid of losing his
[51:06] congregation to jerusalem
[51:10] jerusalem so he decided that he was
[51:12] going to create a place in the northern
[51:16] part of the country
[51:20] i believe it was in the city of dan
[51:24] and he set up a place for the people to
[51:27] worship
[51:30] now god's provided place of worship was
[51:33] in jerusalem
[51:49] and so he decided to set up an idol in
[51:52] the city of damn
[51:56] and it was not to worship the one true
[51:58] living god
[52:02] it became
[52:26] it didn't matter the hardships to get
[52:29] there
[52:45] place of worship was in jerusalem
[52:50] there was a man who was afraid of losing
[52:52] his congregation
[52:55] and so he set up idle worship
[53:22] of the one true god
[53:39] but they weren't under the blessing of
[53:41] almighty god
[53:42] [Music]
[53:45] and we will be in the same position my
[53:47] friend
[53:50] if we try to come up with a substitute
[54:04] that jezebel did not realize that elijah
[54:06] was her pastor
[54:22] and we come up with a substitute for the
[54:24] worship
[54:28] and we come up with a substitute for our
[54:30] pastor
[54:33] we will find ourselves under the same
[54:36] false
[54:50] and it begins
[55:04] and he did worse than all of those that
[55:06] were before him
[55:10] now we may think how could he do any
[55:12] worse than setting up idle worship
[55:18] but the bible
[55:32] jezebel was the daughter of a king
[55:38] and she was a baal worshiper also
[55:44] so now not only do we have a king who is
[55:46] a baal worshiper
[55:50] he has strengthened his alliance to that
[55:53] worship
[55:56] and not only that
[55:59] she was stronger willed than ahab
[56:05] and now ahab might have been the king
[56:09] the people may have looked at him as the
[56:11] authority
[56:14] but
[56:16] [Music]
[56:31] when we see this kind of a picture
[56:35] we become a little bit disconcerted
[56:41] we get uncomfortable
[57:10] in alignment
[57:13] because he has an end plan
[57:16] the one that started this process
[57:20] he knows the very end of all of it
[57:23] he could never understand all of
[57:34] and it is my job to get in lockstep with
[57:37] my creators
[57:52] and
[58:02] there is all kinds of atrocities that
[58:05] are going on
[58:20] what he set out to accomplish
[58:29] and and all of the baal worship is going
[58:32] on
[58:42] he says i want you to meet me with all
[58:46] of the prophets of baal
[58:56] [Music]
[59:18] so the land is getting pretty dry
[59:20] like lupine
[59:22] the shrubbery is drying up
[59:26] the
[59:27] sushi the grass is drying up
[59:32] the crops are not producing
[59:36] the people are no doubt getting hungry
[59:41] and they're trying to figure out where
[59:43] they're going to find their next bottle
[59:45] of water
[59:49] maybe when they put the jug down in the
[59:51] well they pull it up and it's dry
[1:00:22] and you're just longing for a good cold
[1:00:26] drink of water
[1:00:29] god knows how to get you in that tight
[1:00:32] place
[1:00:36] until that you reversal until you will
[1:00:39] respond to his cause
[1:00:54] you may
[1:01:11] and he knows how to make you so dry
[1:01:16] and you have nowhere else to turn
[1:01:21] and he finally has you in the right
[1:01:23] position
[1:01:28] so elijah had called for this drought
[1:01:33] and he said there will be no rain
[1:01:36] not even
[1:01:45] he says i want you to bring all of the
[1:01:47] prophets of baal
[1:01:50] i want you to bring
[1:01:53] [Music]
[1:02:03] this is gonna be a real meeting we're
[1:02:06] going to have
[1:02:08] all of them have to be there
[1:02:12] this is going to be a school of the
[1:02:14] prophets
[1:02:17] and elijah calls all of them up on top
[1:02:23] and he says make sure you bring your
[1:02:24] sacrifices
[1:02:29] when they get up on top of the mountain
[1:02:32] elijah
[1:02:35] [Music]
[1:02:46] we're gonna have a showdown once and for
[1:02:48] all
[1:02:50] spectacular and we're going to decide
[1:02:52] who is the real god
[1:02:57] so they set up their sacrifice
[1:03:00] and they began to dance around that
[1:03:03] sacrifice
[1:03:04] and i imagine
[1:03:06] early in the morning
[1:03:09] they're probably joining hands around
[1:03:11] this sacrifice
[1:03:14] they're dancing around
[1:03:28] he's having a little trouble
[1:03:33] and then he says maybe he's off in a far
[1:03:35] country somewhere
[1:03:39] you know elijah was just taunting them
[1:03:56] [Music]
[1:04:03] he was fixing to do something to show
[1:04:06] his power
[1:04:16] [Music]
[1:04:21] it comes toward the time of the evening
[1:04:23] sacrifices
[1:04:38] and i don't know whether elijah felt
[1:04:40] sorry for them or not
[1:04:44] i don't really
[1:04:45] i don't really think that he did
[1:04:48] because he kept poking at them
[1:04:53] he might have been saying well that
[1:04:54] didn't work why don't you try something
[1:04:56] else
[1:05:00] that didn't work why don't you try
[1:05:02] something else
[1:05:05] and see that's the way people
[1:05:19] you may go after women
[1:05:55] [Music]
[1:06:02] so
[1:06:13] but after a while elijah knew enough was
[1:06:16] enough
[1:06:18] i see
[1:06:19] and elijah got his sacrifice
[1:06:22] he said bill build the altar back up
[1:06:27] he should lay the bullock on top of that
[1:06:29] altar
[1:06:40] because this was a time of a
[1:06:45] it's a draft of a drought do this
[1:06:47] decision and i want to know where they
[1:06:49] got the water
[1:06:51] but elijah said fill up those pails with
[1:06:54] water
[1:06:56] now i don't know how far they had to go
[1:06:58] get their buckets of water
[1:07:03] but there was some water to pour over
[1:07:04] that sacrifice
[1:07:08] and it didn't satisfy elijah for them to
[1:07:10] just fill their buckets one time
[1:07:23] that didn't satisfy me said go do it
[1:07:25] again
[1:07:38] this was not just going to be some
[1:07:40] little something
[1:07:43] there god was about to show himself god
[1:07:50] when you get to the bottom of yourself
[1:07:54] god can show
[1:08:06] [Music]
[1:08:08] and he's got his sacrifice
[1:08:12] he's got a ditch
[1:08:13] [Music]
[1:08:16] he's poured water on top of it
[1:08:20] not only is the sacrifice went
[1:09:02] [Applause]
[1:09:04] sacrifices
[1:09:16] [Music]
[1:09:32] i beseech you therefore brethren
[1:09:37] present yourselves unto god
[1:09:41] a living sacrifice sacrifice be holy and
[1:09:45] acceptable unto god
[1:10:07] it's not unreasonable for god to ask you
[1:10:10] to be a living sacrifice
[1:10:28] when the
[1:10:37] [Music]
[1:10:42] the enemy
[1:11:09] here i am lord
[1:11:20] and he's got his sacrifice on the altar
[1:11:24] and now the wood's
[1:11:36] he's just going to let the people know
[1:11:38] who god is first of all
[1:11:41] and he stands before that sacrifice
[1:11:45] he lifts up his head
[1:11:47] and he said oh lord
[1:11:50] i thank you that you've heard me
[1:12:15] and it didn't matter that the sacrifice
[1:12:17] was wet you know
[1:12:18] it didn't matter that the wood was wet
[1:12:34] sacrifices
[1:12:42] [Applause]
[1:12:48] and i tell you what the fire of the holy
[1:12:50] ghost
[1:12:51] is if you allow the fire of the holy
[1:12:53] ghost to consume you oh food
[1:12:56] it will be burned so hard in you
[1:13:00] that all of those fleshly desires
[1:13:15] you may say preacher
[1:13:30] where have you been presenting yourself
[1:13:34] have you been presenting yourself up and
[1:13:36] dan
[1:13:39] are you coming to god's provided place
[1:13:42] of worship
[1:13:56] but we spend too much time in dance
[1:14:01] [Music]
[1:14:26] without the
[1:14:38] that god is not going to accept
[1:14:43] [Music]
[1:14:53] there are many people
[1:15:05] and they listen with an intellectual
[1:15:08] mind
[1:15:21] when we present ourselves
[1:15:25] as a living sacrifice
[1:15:29] and he will come and consume us
[1:15:35] this is not a once a week happening
[1:15:38] we have got to come to our lord daily
[1:15:43] lord burn out all of the uncleanness
[1:15:49] burn out all of the stuff that is
[1:15:52] hindering me
[1:15:56] but we get scared
[1:15:58] we get scared because we're afraid of
[1:16:01] losing friendships
[1:16:04] we're
[1:16:18] but at the end of the day what does it
[1:16:20] matter
[1:16:22] because i don't answer to my peers
[1:16:26] i have one that i answered
[1:16:31] and that is the one that called me
[1:16:34] my lord jesus christ
[1:16:38] so elijah is at this showdown
[1:16:42] the fire came down and consumed the
[1:16:44] sacrifices
[1:16:46] of sacrifice
[1:17:12] that it not only absorbed the sacrifice
[1:17:17] and it absorbed the wood
[1:17:20] and it absorbed the water
[1:17:24] but how did it absorb the stones
[1:17:28] absorbing
[1:17:41] there have been a lot of things that i
[1:17:42] have tried to present to god
[1:17:47] and there have been a lot of times
[1:17:50] that he has turned what i thought was
[1:17:52] important to me
[1:18:10] but he had a calling on my life that he
[1:18:12] wanted to carry out
[1:18:16] now you may say preacher that don't
[1:18:18] exactly fit
[1:18:21] it doesn't matter right this second yeah
[1:18:36] because sometimes we come to god
[1:18:46] um
[1:18:56] here is my gift to you lord
[1:19:01] but do you realize how hard you're
[1:19:03] making it on me
[1:19:21] god isn't looking for excuses
[1:19:24] god is looking for a sacrifice
[1:19:28] a sacrifice that is brought to him
[1:19:33] out of a grateful heart
[1:19:36] that he went to calvary on your behalf
[1:19:41] and he laid down his life
[1:19:45] that you could have eternal life
[1:19:48] he doesn't
[1:19:59] so all of the excuses that i present to
[1:20:02] him
[1:20:16] i
[1:20:21] but all of this sacrifice that elijah
[1:20:24] had presented to god
[1:20:28] is now ash it is
[1:20:41] and now ahab has watched all of this
[1:20:44] transpire
[1:20:48] transformation he saw his own prophets
[1:20:50] of baal dancing around their altar
[1:20:56] and no response from baal but the report
[1:21:04] you've got to remember elijah and ahab
[1:21:07] have already butted heads
[1:21:40] god comes down and consumes elijah's
[1:21:42] sacrifice
[1:21:45] and they all watched it happen
[1:21:49] every last one of them
[1:21:53] now there is no record in the scripture
[1:21:58] that one of those prophets of baal
[1:22:03] fell down on their knees and repented
[1:22:23] and i am sure that those four hundred
[1:22:25] and fifty prophets of baal jesus christ
[1:22:30] were not ignorant that there was a
[1:22:32] prophet of the living god in the
[1:22:34] language
[1:22:37] i imagine that when they gathered
[1:22:39] together
[1:22:42] at the school of the baal prophets
[1:22:46] that elijah's name was mentioned more
[1:22:49] than one time
[1:22:51] [Music]
[1:22:52] i have a feeling that elijah's name was
[1:22:56] batted from one side of the room to the
[1:22:58] other side
[1:23:04] and they probably talked about that
[1:23:06] crazy guy that lives in the wilderness
[1:23:12] but here they are on top of the mountain
[1:23:17] and they have just watched an incredible
[1:23:20] feat of the living god
[1:23:23] the
[1:23:25] spectacle
[1:23:26] in response to elijah god's prophet
[1:23:32] and not one of them bowed down and said
[1:23:35] he is god
[1:23:40] and elijah said you take every last one
[1:23:42] of them and you kill them don't let none
[1:23:44] of them escape
[1:24:06] you read further in the scripture
[1:24:10] i don't know where that elijah heard the
[1:24:13] sound
[1:24:23] elijah went apart from the rest of them
[1:24:28] with
[1:24:43] that elijah knew something was about to
[1:24:46] happen
[1:24:49] and he made a prophetic declaration
[1:24:53] but he had to go pray that declaration
[1:24:55] through
[1:25:05] [Music]
[1:25:09] he said i want you to go look and see
[1:25:11] what you see
[1:25:14] look toward the sea
[1:25:17] and tell me what's there
[1:25:21] the servant comes back and says i don't
[1:25:22] see a thing
[1:25:38] because
[1:25:44] [Music]
[1:25:50] continues to intercede
[1:25:54] and see that's the way it is among a
[1:25:55] congregation of people
[1:25:59] a preacher may stand here and tell you i
[1:26:01] believe god is going to do this this and
[1:26:03] this
[1:26:04] is
[1:26:20] what the preacher needs
[1:26:24] is some prayer warriors to sit down
[1:26:26] beside of him
[1:26:29] and put their head between their knees
[1:26:32] and begin to cry out with god
[1:26:48] see this isn't all the preacher's job to
[1:26:51] do
[1:26:52] he needs some intercessors to be
[1:26:54] possible
[1:26:56] say lord send the reigns
[1:26:58] on that
[1:26:59] lord
[1:27:26] well what's happening today because
[1:27:28] successors will do
[1:27:30] and all we can present
[1:27:33] is like the servant
[1:27:35] i don't see nothing
[1:27:38] all i see around me is trials
[1:27:42] i see
[1:27:43] that there are things that it looks like
[1:27:45] america's about to crash
[1:27:50] i see that people come to church
[1:27:54] and they don't care whether they're
[1:27:55] there or not
[1:27:56] [Music]
[1:28:09] i hear the sound of an abundance of rain
[1:29:09] the old testament doesn't record that
[1:29:13] but jesus told us in the new testament
[1:29:17] that it was a space of three and a half
[1:29:19] years
[1:29:21] that elijah prayed
[1:29:25] but it was his prophecy that shut up the
[1:29:27] heavens
[1:29:29] and it was his prophecy that brought the
[1:29:31] reign back
[1:29:33] and he prayed it through
[1:29:34] [Music]
[1:29:51] and there was a supernatural force that
[1:29:54] came on elijah the prophet
[1:29:58] and he began to run
[1:30:01] and the bible said that he got there
[1:30:03] ahead of ahab
[1:30:13] [Music]
[1:30:16] but it is not going to come to us
[1:30:20] [Music]
[1:30:26] [Applause]
[1:30:33] bless us if you can
[1:30:38] say this the job of the preacher
[1:30:41] this is a body ministry
[1:30:43] [Applause]
[1:30:45] we are to come into the house of the
[1:30:47] lord
[1:30:49] with expectations don't expect evil
[1:30:52] sorry brother brooks i'm gonna say it
[1:30:54] ahead of you
[1:30:56] there are a lot of people that come into
[1:30:58] the church
[1:31:00] with
[1:31:25] we need to come to the house of god
[1:31:39] and it's going to change our lives
[1:31:56] i don't care how low you feel like you
[1:31:59] have sunk
[1:32:02] if you will with a right heart
[1:32:07] come into the house of the lord
[1:32:24] i know that i have sinned against you
[1:32:27] this week
[1:32:29] and i have found myself in the muck of
[1:32:32] sin
[1:32:35] but lord
[1:32:37] i know my only help is
[1:32:51] when you come in the house of the lord
[1:32:59] and he wants to come and put his hand on
[1:33:01] top of your head
[1:33:03] and he wants to say son with your fee
[1:33:06] sir you've
[1:33:28] [Applause]
[1:33:29] i'm not going to the house of the lord
[1:33:32] just sit on my hands
[1:33:34] my
[1:33:45] and i know that baal worship is not what
[1:33:48] he's going to accept
[1:34:28] that'll make you want to say yes lord
[1:34:51] i know i'm the one that allowed myself
[1:34:54] to get in that hell
[1:34:56] but i come to you with a holy
[1:35:02] [Music]
[1:35:07] [Applause]
[1:35:09] the lord is not here to kick you this is
[1:35:12] the only place
[1:35:26] you gotta pull
[1:35:40] [Music]
[1:35:54] you say brother
[1:35:57] i find myself in fornication
[1:36:01] i find myself in adultery
[1:36:05] i find myself in pornography
[1:36:08] i
[1:36:20] but we can boil them all down to one
[1:36:27] [Music]
[1:36:39] my god is able to consume the sacrifice
[1:36:44] but you've got to present the sacrifice
[1:36:46] to him
[1:36:48] lord
[1:37:01] here i am
[1:37:03] [Music]
[1:37:17] he knows who you are
[1:37:25] you can go out of this house today
[1:37:29] and you can keep all of your excuses in
[1:37:31] your pockets
[1:37:47] because after god came down and consumed
[1:37:49] that sacrifice
[1:37:53] after the mighty prophet of god had his
[1:37:55] head between his knees and prayed for
[1:37:57] rain
[1:38:08] [Music]
[1:38:22] and gave jezebel the report of the
[1:38:24] revival meeting
[1:38:32] now elijah was
[1:38:34] under the mighty hand of god remember
[1:38:40] the fire came down and consumed the
[1:38:42] sacrifice
[1:38:45] and after elijah prayed for the rain
[1:38:50] there came a supernatural power on
[1:38:52] elijah that he ran ahead of ahab
[1:38:56] um
[1:39:08] something
[1:39:09] supernatural was upon
[1:39:21] there was the supernatural fire that
[1:39:23] consumed the sacrifice and the
[1:39:25] supernatural was upon him to run but the
[1:39:28] report of the revival the report of the
[1:39:31] supernatural got back to jezebel
[1:39:37] naturally
[1:39:51] when he got back to the
[1:40:04] i tell you the jezebel spirit has not
[1:40:07] died
[1:40:10] and it presents itself in all kinds of
[1:40:12] ways
[1:40:14] and i'm not here to define all of those
[1:40:16] ways today
[1:40:18] all i know is that
[1:40:20] that ahab
[1:40:33] he ran to the city under the
[1:40:35] supernatural
[1:40:37] but when ahab got back with the report
[1:40:41] and he gave the ahab did they he gave
[1:40:44] the report to jezebel
[1:40:47] jezebel
[1:40:49] had a report to send back to elijah
[1:40:57] you're going to be just like one of
[1:40:59] those prophets of baal
[1:41:02] at
[1:41:14] now we all have our mountaintop
[1:41:16] experiences
[1:41:17] [Music]
[1:41:19] are there any believers here today that
[1:41:22] you would testify i have had mountain
[1:41:24] topics
[1:41:28] but how many of you believers that have
[1:41:30] had mountain mountaintop experiences
[1:41:33] would say that you face the jezebel
[1:41:36] afterwards
[1:41:42] all elijah got was a jezebel report
[1:41:54] [Music]
[1:41:58] it didn't change his position
[1:42:00] in god
[1:42:03] he was still the prophet of god
[1:42:08] but jezebel sent word to him
[1:42:11] foreign
[1:42:22] it didn't matter that the supernatural
[1:42:23] had just happened
[1:42:39] he left his servant there
[1:42:42] and the bible said he checked another
[1:42:44] three days journey into the wilderness
[1:42:50] and he went and hid in a cave
[1:42:54] the mighty
[1:43:08] he comes down under a juniper tree
[1:43:13] juniper and he goes to sleep in italy
[1:43:17] he wakes up
[1:43:19] because angel tapped him on the shoulder
[1:43:22] um
[1:43:36] drank
[1:43:51] says you got to rise up and eat
[1:43:55] that angel food must have been something
[1:43:57] supernatural
[1:44:00] because in the strength of that
[1:44:03] he went in he went 40 days journey
[1:44:19] and the voice of the lord comes to him
[1:44:23] amen
[1:44:28] what are you doing here
[1:44:30] you see
[1:44:39] he has witnessed the supernatural even
[1:44:44] over and over
[1:44:46] again and now he is in this cave
[1:44:51] running from the jezebel spirit
[1:44:56] and god asks in this question
[1:45:00] what are you doing here
[1:45:04] and what did elijah did
[1:45:08] elijah starts offering his excuses as to
[1:45:11] why he's there
[1:45:27] [Music]
[1:45:29] and they're doing all kinds of things
[1:45:31] against your words
[1:45:34] and i'm the only one that's standing for
[1:45:37] any truth
[1:45:41] he goes back in the cave
[1:45:53] and there is a supernatural power that
[1:45:56] went
[1:46:09] there was a wind that went through
[1:46:35] see all of these things that precede the
[1:46:37] voice of the lord
[1:47:02] [Music]
[1:47:05] elijah hears the voice of god
[1:47:10] elijah
[1:47:13] what
[1:47:14] are you doing here
[1:47:17] you see
[1:47:21] they lied to you again
[1:47:24] lord senora i have been very jealous for
[1:47:28] your people
[1:47:31] i've been jealous for you lord
[1:47:35] and all of israel has forsaken you
[1:47:40] and they have forsaken your covenants
[1:47:44] and they've torn down your altars
[1:47:48] and they've erected altars under baal
[1:47:52] and i am the only one left
[1:47:56] and they're seeking to take me out
[1:48:03] god had to come along to elijah jude
[1:48:07] and remind him
[1:48:10] you are not
[1:48:12] the only one
[1:48:15] you see when you are in the valley of
[1:48:17] despair
[1:48:21] when you are in your hellhole
[1:48:26] and you feel like that nobody
[1:48:28] understands who you are
[1:48:44] perhaps you have laid at this altar and
[1:48:47] experienced the touch of god in your
[1:48:50] life
[1:48:54] and you had a mountaintop experience
[1:49:11] [Music]
[1:49:20] you went to try to find something that
[1:49:22] would satisfy you
[1:49:39] but we don't live our life on a
[1:49:42] mountaintop experience
[1:49:46] god gives you those mountaintop
[1:49:48] experiences because he knows that you're
[1:49:52] going to face some jezebel spirit
[1:50:04] so that you can face jezebel
[1:50:20] and he rents the mountain into
[1:50:24] he tears the mountain apart
[1:50:30] yeah he explodes the mountain
[1:50:32] and and and he he sends win
[1:50:36] and he
[1:50:49] and hear that still small voice of the
[1:50:51] lord
[1:50:54] you see the mind battle friends
[1:50:57] it rages all of the time
[1:51:02] and it seems like that our head is just
[1:51:05] going to explode
[1:51:09] but sometimes we just got to settle
[1:51:11] ourselves
[1:51:16] to hear the voice of the lord
[1:51:40] [Music]
[1:51:56] i gave you the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:51:59] [Music]
[1:52:01] i saved you out of a life of sin
[1:52:06] i am the same god who sent fire out of
[1:52:09] heaven
[1:52:11] i am the same god who put a supernatural
[1:52:14] energy inside of you
[1:52:19] so that you could run ahead of ahab into
[1:52:21] jerusalem
[1:52:25] what are you doing here
[1:52:28] have you forgotten who i am
[1:52:32] this is not your force anyhow
[1:52:36] this you're this is not by might
[1:52:40] it's not by power
[1:52:43] but it's by my spirit saith the lord of
[1:52:46] hosts
[1:52:47] what are you doing here
[1:52:51] why are you in this valley of despair
[1:52:53] today
[1:52:56] why are you in this condition
[1:53:00] have you forgotten what i have done
[1:53:03] previous to now
[1:53:04] [Music]
[1:53:06] i'm the same god that did this
[1:53:08] supernatural in you to start with
[1:53:23] well i want to tell you you sitting here
[1:53:25] is a supernatural happening
[1:53:30] it is above the natural
[1:53:33] natural you say well how do you figure
[1:53:37] i live in this region
[1:53:49] but you think about all of the millions
[1:53:51] of people
[1:54:04] you think about all of the people that
[1:54:06] billy graham ever will preach too
[1:54:12] and they made a decision
[1:54:15] yes i want christ
[1:54:18] but that's all they did
[1:54:20] but here you sit today
[1:54:22] [Music]
[1:54:24] by a supernatural happening
[1:54:29] god put you in the right family
[1:54:33] with the right upbringing
[1:54:48] he took you through the right struggles
[1:54:52] he put you in the right school
[1:54:56] with the right parents
[1:54:59] and the right teachers
[1:55:02] and somewhere along the way
[1:55:05] he brought you to another one of those
[1:55:08] junctions of time
[1:55:12] that you recognized your day and its
[1:55:15] visitation
[1:55:18] [Music]
[1:55:27] [Music]
[1:55:31] i am a sinner jesus
[1:55:34] i have fallen so short of your grace
[1:55:40] but i ask you to forgive me of all of my
[1:55:43] sins to demonstrate
[1:55:53] it was still a
[1:55:55] supernatural happening in your life
[1:56:14] and said what are you doing here
[1:56:19] don't you know that i'm still the god of
[1:56:22] the supernatural
[1:56:25] you're not the only one you're not the
[1:56:28] only one that has faced battles
[1:56:31] you're not the only one that has ever
[1:56:33] had a mind battle
[1:56:35] you're not the only one that has ever
[1:56:36] encountered the jezebel spirit
[1:57:22] he's still in the cave
[1:57:25] offering his excuses to the lord
[1:57:29] you may say preacher
[1:57:31] are you really sure that that's what was
[1:57:33] happening here
[1:57:37] i believe that that is what was
[1:57:38] happening
[1:57:41] because elijah was a prophet
[1:57:44] but he was a human
[1:57:47] and we do find it recorded in the
[1:57:49] scripture
[1:58:01] we can witness the same thing to the in
[1:58:03] the prophet of our day experiment
[1:58:08] he was not god
[1:58:11] he was a prophet
[1:58:13] he was a man
[1:58:15] he had the truth to give to the people
[1:58:30] i have found myself under the juniper
[1:58:32] tree
[1:58:33] [Music]
[1:58:45] some kind of a tormenting spirit had
[1:58:48] gotten after him
[1:58:51] and he needed a rest
[1:58:54] and there are times that we need arrest
[1:58:58] but i want to tell you young people
[1:59:00] and i want
[1:59:14] finds their
[1:59:27] and sometimes i have to pull
[1:59:49] sometimes what my
[1:59:51] wife has to say the first group
[1:59:59] i'm going to turn that right around
[2:00:00] because sometimes she has just the right
[2:00:02] words
[2:00:06] god gave her to me
[2:00:10] because sometimes
[2:00:12] i need to be kicked in the side of the
[2:00:14] head
[2:00:18] to remind me
[2:00:21] i've reserved unto myself seven thousand
[2:00:36] you're not the only one that has ever
[2:00:38] faced discouragement
[2:00:52] get
[2:01:03] so i struggle a long little longer
[2:01:35] i don't want something as natural as my
[2:01:37] wife to tell me something
[2:01:40] i want fire to come out of heaven again
[2:01:45] i want the supernatural to come upon me
[2:01:48] that i can
[2:01:58] and sometimes it's just a still small
[2:02:02] boy
[2:02:10] how did you get yourself in this place
[2:02:15] you think you're the only
[2:02:30] i am not so far removed from being a
[2:02:33] teenager and a young man
[2:02:37] that i don't understand some of the
[2:02:40] struggles
[2:02:43] i also
[2:02:44] realized that you all are facing
[2:02:48] something that i never faced
[2:02:56] because of this thing right here of
[2:02:58] course you said chosen
[2:03:00] [Music]
[2:03:08] that those things that are done in
[2:03:10] secret
[2:03:12] faith they're
[2:03:25] of the lord jesus christ
[2:03:30] you're not hiding a thing
[2:03:33] you are not hiding one thing from the
[2:03:35] living god
[2:03:37] but i know a savior
[2:03:43] [Applause]
[2:03:57] [Music]
[2:04:03] the holy spirit is here today
[2:04:07] saying to you who
[2:04:21] i have shown you the way before
[2:04:25] i am the one that called you
[2:04:27] supernaturally
[2:04:30] when you were dead in your sin and in
[2:04:33] your trespasses
[2:04:36] without
[2:05:04] you begin to weep in the presence of the
[2:05:07] lord
[2:05:07] [Music]
[2:05:09] say oh lord i'm a sinner
[2:05:12] but here you are again running from the
[2:05:14] presence of the lord
[2:05:18] the lord asks you the question again
[2:05:20] today
[2:05:22] what are you doing here
[2:05:31] now you've got to give the lord a
[2:05:32] response
[2:05:35] and i want you to think about your
[2:05:36] response as we come down to a close up
[2:05:41] and the musicians come to the instrument

[2:05:57] [Music]
[2:05:59] some higher than others
[2:06:02] [Music]
[2:06:12] whether you feel like that you're in the
[2:06:14] depths of despair
[2:06:21] [Music]
[2:06:28] if you're on a mountaintop experience
[2:06:32] the holy spirit is saying what are you
[2:06:34] doing here
[2:06:36] do you think you've arrived
[2:06:39] you don't think you have to press any
[2:06:41] further than this
[2:06:44] [Music]
[2:06:50] [Music]
[2:06:58] [Music]
[2:07:09] i want you to hear the still small voice
[2:07:11] of the holy spirit
[2:07:15] what are you doing
[2:07:17] [Music]

[2:07:23] about it
[2:07:25] [Music]
[2:07:31] i'm the only one left
[2:07:34] i don't have the power to fight against
[2:07:36] that jezebel spirit

[2:07:42] the holy spirit is here today
[2:07:45] to empower you like never before

[2:08:10] he asks you what are you doing here
[2:08:15] he's not asking you
[2:08:17] [Music]

[2:43:16] [Music]

[2:44:02] from without and from within

[2:44:05] against himself
[2:44:11] [Music]
[2:44:18] i am asking you that you will send forth
[2:44:21] a word from heaven
[2:44:22] [Music]
[2:44:24] that jezebel would be cast out of the
[2:44:26] wind
[2:44:29] [Music]
[2:44:42] [Music]
[2:44:45] that the angels would be there first
[2:44:47] to clean up all the mess
[2:44:50] these dogs would just pick up all the
[2:44:52] pieces there would not be one thing that
[2:44:54] would be able to be used to be once
[2:44:56] again launched against my brother
[2:44:59] beyonce
[2:45:00] [Music]
[2:45:26] refreshing from the presence
[2:45:28] [Music]
[2:45:53] oh
[2:45:55] [Music]
[2:46:05] [Music]
[2:46:30] you see once upon a time
[2:46:32] there was a battle
[2:46:34] [Music]
[2:46:35] and moses had given the instruction
[2:46:39] when he gave the instruction
[2:46:41] he stood up on a rock
[2:46:45] and he held his hands up
[2:46:47] as long as his hands were being held up
[2:46:50] the people were winning the battle
[2:46:53] but as his hands began to get heavy
[2:46:56] the battle
[2:46:58] was raging
[2:46:59] but moses's hands got heavy
[2:47:03] felt like he couldn't hold him up
[2:47:04] anymore but there were some men that got
[2:47:07] under his arms
[2:47:09] they realized that there was a man
[2:47:11] called of god
[2:47:13] and that he had a job to do
[2:47:15] and that his hands had to be held up in
[2:47:18] order for the victory to be won
[2:47:20] so they got under his arms
[2:47:23] they held his arms up
[2:47:26] and so as a prophetic symbol today
[2:47:29] these two men this weekend that have led
[2:47:32] the song service
[2:47:33] and helped to create the atmosphere for
[2:47:36] the word of god
[2:47:37] they're standing here beside of their
[2:47:39] pastor
[2:47:41] holding his arms up in a prophetic
[2:47:44] declaration
[2:47:45] lord i am here to support my brother
[2:47:49] because we are in a war
[2:47:52] and it is a war that we have got to win
[2:47:58] and if the man of god
[2:48:01] falls down
[2:48:02] [Music]
[2:48:04] the the the army
[2:48:07] is going to be defeated
[2:48:09] but if we hold up the arms
[2:48:12] of god's servant
[2:48:16] going to win this fight
[2:48:18] so now lord
[2:48:19] as these brothers stand on both sides
[2:48:22] of my brother isaiah brooks
[2:48:25] i declare over him
[2:48:29] word of the lord
[2:48:31] once again it is not my might
[2:48:34] it is not by power
[2:48:36] but it is by the spirit of the lord
[2:48:39] now lord i
[2:48:41] i am laying my hands on these
[2:48:43] [Music]
[2:48:55] that they would understand
[2:48:57] [Music]
[2:49:08] and not only as they stand behind
[2:49:18] holding up the arms of our brother
[2:49:21] god i pray for this
[2:49:25] may entire recognize their
[2:49:27] responsibilities
[2:49:29] [Music]
[2:49:46] i thank you that you're cutting off

[2:50:55] [Music]
[2:51:03] about the size of a fist but the hand
[2:51:06] keeps reaching through

[2:51:11] close the hole
[2:51:15] seal it
[2:51:16] name of up
[2:51:18] christ

[2:52:18] a believer
[2:52:20] somebody that claims to be a believer
[2:52:24] somehow they have an ability to have
[2:52:26] access
[2:52:30] [Music]
[2:52:40] and they can't even be identified that
[2:52:42] they're the troublemaker
[2:52:46] but the access is being cut off in the
[2:52:48] name of jesus christ
[2:52:51] the access is being cut off
[2:52:55] and we're calling for repentance in the
[2:52:57] name of jesus christ
