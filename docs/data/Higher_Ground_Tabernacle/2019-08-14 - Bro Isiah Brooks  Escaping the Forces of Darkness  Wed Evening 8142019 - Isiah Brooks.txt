Christ who is the author and finisher of our faith what a mighty God we serve he is mighty he is almighty dollar of message tonight and perhaps we'll be able to finish it on Sunday evening we will have Sunday evening service even though brother brother Jesse will have to leave after the morning service so anyway let's stand and return to the book of Revelation the book of Revelation please we're living at a crucial time and there's there's it's not no time no time absolutely no time to allow yourself to be distracting that we are at a time where choice must be made but you know what you can't make the right choice on this dog by his grace that's given you that choice revelations 10 and I hope I can express God thoughts tonight as the way he expressed it to me was a real blessing by God's grace and so we're trusting that you'll be blessed tonight revelation is 10 we're gonna read the ninth beginning at the ninth verse for me your scripture and I went into the angel and said unto him give me the little book and he said unto me take it and eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter and it shall be in my mouth sweet as honey and I took the little book out of the Angels hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I had eaten it my belly was bitter and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many people nations tongues and kings then God great you'll find out that neither even in the Book of Ezekiel God was Ezekiel was told to eat the book and you and I must understand him and there's something about eating the book but anyway let us pray father God we come before you Lord Jesus and we thank you for your amazing grace we thank you for being so good to us you have been better to us than we have been to ourselves there are no words to express our gratitude toward you and your amazing grace father God there is none like you none before you and none will be after you for you all in all we thank you Father for allowing us to be a part of your Redemption plan so therefore Lord God let your word be known tonight give us understanding and lighten our hearts and we'll be careful to give you the praise glory and honor in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated I know this might sound really strange but I like to entitle this message escaping the forces of darkness there's a reason why the angel told John to eat the book and not just part of it but he had to eat the whole book remember that God is the Alpha and the Omega he's the beginning and he is the ending John types out the bride of Jesus Christ I don't really know whether we believe or even understand how great of a people the bride is the bride of Jesus Christ were selected and chosen by God himself we know and understand that before time began we were with him and of course by God's grace we came in this day to be manifested to prove that we were with him God is a spirit and they that worship God must worship Him in spirit and in truth you and I can't remember being with him but but because we are here it is evident we came from somewhere and that somewhere is God because he made all things and according to John not not one thing was made that was made without him when we come and we talk about eating the book you must understand that this Bible is a great book and to know it all in my little mine I could say I don't but in his mind I do because Jesus told his disciples you know with all things to eat this book it means that you must be identified with God from cover to cover from jot tittle comma whatever everything God is in this book you must be identified with it if you were with him this is why john had to eat the whole book because he's the bride and he's he's a type of the bride and the bride must come to understand that there is no variableness in god there's no changing in him the bible says according to Hebrews 13 and 8 he's the same yesterday today and forever and one of the things that God told Israel he said I'm the LORD thy God and I changed not so eating this book you you find out that you must be identified with God in every aspect in the places where it seems like God was failing which we know that God never fails but we find that God and man in every aspect showed his glory in his power that's what we were created for he had angels they glorified him they worshiped him but God wanted something closer something that was Lord that could be more intimate because the angels were created to worship him but he wanted someone of his own kind that could love him and being that he's the only being of love he had to break a piece or two off of himself as the prophet of God said we are rotation off of God that's the only way you and I can love God he would love this fallen love is not what God requires God doesn't require filial love from us he require agape love and the only way that he could do that he himself had to make arrangements now the Bible tells us that before time began before the foundation of the world our names were placed in the Lamb's Book of Life because in the mind of God we always existed because he existed that part of God was us and we were in him God is a spirit God is male and his female hello but God is man y'all understand what I'm saying Amen God didn't create the feminine part of himself it existed when he existed and so therefore he was mother and father somebody help me here chief that's that's what we people don't understand that's why God made male and female a man and a beast because that was man was the highest image of God male and female and in God in Adam was Adam which was the feminine part she didn't receive her her name even till she had fallen but let me get to where we're going with this when I talk about escaping from the forces of darkness or the forces of evil God has always made it where it's been a choice but you see because he's omniscient he knows all things if he didn't know what was gonna take place he would not be God because he knows everything but in all in order to displaces his attributes with this Creator can create creatures can you imagine saying you're God and there's nothing to worship you because the word God means to worship and you gotta find out by God's grace Amen that God had all of these other things but they were attributes in him then he was a father he was a mother he was assisting he was a brother he was a healer he was a deliverer all of these things were in him so God in His brilliant life had to find a way to be known to fellowship and you and I don't fully understand him because if we could he wouldn't be God if we could say all God is this and God is that then he's not God because God can't be placed in a box he can't be confined he's all in all he's above all through all English all one thing I love about God is that God is a just God God will never do anything that he himself wouldn't do oh he wouldn't require us to do anything that he himself wouldn't do let me go on we're talking about forces of evil even when God created Lucifer God knew what he was going to do it wasn't surprised at all I didn't know it but even God said Amen - Lucifer listen I have seen even in your heart before you said anything I see that you have spoken evil this thing in you is not a good thing Lucifer because you have said in your heart that you're going to take what belongs to me in that right that's just the way things are I was describing this to a brother the other day and when I say the other day I think it was either this morning or yesterday but anyway I was telling him I said remember the parables of Jesus that there was a great master and he owned a lot of land and he said servant after servant after servant amen and these people who were actually over his property would kill these servants would run him away somehow they would bring these service to an the end and then one day the the owner of all the property sent his son and these men who were over his property says hey this one is different he is excuse me he is the son and so therefore let us kill him so we can inherit so we can gain his inheritance and Jesus was talking to the Pharisees he was talking to the people of that day showing to them that he had me who were over his property but instead of receiving the son they killed him is that right and that's the way it is now he's always those preachers who would kill the son and the influence of the Sun so that they can only his inheritance you have these megachurches and if Jesus was here he would couldn't do that the Bible says foxes have hole birds have nests but the Son of man has no place to lay his head and you see all presidents where you're gone would be just bare with me in just a moment because I think sometimes and I know I know there's a particular organization that don't even believe that Satan exists how can you worship God and not believe that Satan exists as well there's always a night just like there's always a day and we know that even in the beginning God separated the night from the day he did that for purpose because he's still separating darkness from light that's sacredness fear here and that's the reason all these things are happening he is still hearing all of his evil forces are still here where did these evil forces come from these evil forces came because Lucifer ran a rebellion in him heaven excuse me and this rebellion of heaven hallelujah is that right the Bible says according to Jude these were angels angels means ministers and these ministers left their first estate they followed Lucifer's campaign and we know them as demons demons because they left their first estate God changed them over and whether you want to believe it or not all of these little roaches and these pests that we call them dark things things of the dark is a reflection of demonic power hello somebody it is reflection of demonic power that's why we see these things we immediately stop them out because if you go to hell if you could visit him you would see demons in the image of these things people don't know how gross they are but I'm not gonna stay on that I just want to throw something out this is why Hollywood is bringing out all of these evil dark things and watch it because every one of these things as a reflection of some kind of creature on earth that they have magnified to bring to a human image but if you look in the in these little places where where you find you know these demons that look like you know the ground where they color the grandfather whatever but anyway they are because they're real and what Satan is doing now is he's blending this dude ah ha how could I said the mid dimensions are now blending hell and earth are blending oh if only the people knew the kind of things they are doing when they bring forth explosions they have no idea what they're breaking into and they are now it is man's functional everything that we're seeing is man's fault remember the lid was taken off of hell in wind World War one right and what was it atomic explosions bombs fighting and everything else and it shakes that rim where we cannot see it cracks it breaks open amen oh come on somebody what you think World War three is going to do and you and I don't see that it is man that is destroying everything it's the forces of evil it's like saying to notice that this is his kingdom but he can't do everything he wants to do until he gets the Christian out of the way once he gets the Christian out of the way he can have full course I do not want to be here may God have mercy on our souls that when the rapture take place we'll go with it because once the bride of Jesus Christ has left this earth it'll be total darkness and total evil right now we are the stars of God we are the very light of God and therefore without us this world would move right into chaos oh people of God don't you see that even in our political RAM how all of this thing is shaping up to do what bring a persecution on the bride of Jesus Christ it's becoming religious maybe y'all hadn't read the latest news but there's laws that are being put into place that is just wonderful because it's going to bring the squeeze it's going to bring a real desperation on the bride of Jesus Christ and it's what we need hallelujah let me finish with this that's why the scum and the ridiculous things that that's goals on the bread bloodshed the war the politics the sin the adultery all kinds of filter missus going goes on is because Satan is the ruler of this earth and this atmosphere is everywhere Satan is everywhere but the greatest thing that has ever happened to us is when God put light in your vessel hallelujah remember it was at midnight when the foolish and the wise virgins were called wasn't daytime it was in the night and that darkness amen is now growing how could I say it it's moving into such a place where the whole purpose is is to put the light but darkness has never been able to put the light out and do you think that God will allow his creation to conquer you absolutely not Satan will never be the way he could never be the winner but both the heavens and the earth now is contaminated with devils that can accuse us before God Jesus is there to intercede for us eat and why the accusers keep pointing a finger they did this they did this they did this the blood still covers he came to redeem that elect that he foresaw that's why it is so filthy today that's future home so you got to understand by God's grace amen that we are now in a warfare hello but you see the wall that we're fighting has already been won that's why you have to eat the whole book it is the whole book that shows you the victory has already been accomplished oh come on somebody a man that's coming a new world like you heard me say when God told the first Adam amen be fruitful and multiply replenish the earth he failed God he failed because the image of God never would never replenish the earth watch it because when God destroyed the earth in those days it was a world of serpents it was not God's seed that perished the only thing that was left you see God got Enoch out the way and the only thing that was left was what eight souls in it something even eight souls were saved hey come on somebody you got to understand it looked like the evil was conquering the good right because that's what devil's the devil his accomplishment was he said he said he said unto God I am going to rule this earth at one day I'm gonna be God and I'm gonna I'm going to beat over the stars of God he said I'm gonna do it and look we're now sitting in what we call Satan's either we wouldn't known it that God said God not sure there's a problem we didn't understand Amen that Satan was truly the ruler of this world he told Jesus that said if you bow down to me I'll give you everything hallelujah but Jesus knew that in this conflict he was gonna win he knew that one day everything was gonna be here he knew that one day darkness and evil and everything that comes with it will be done away with hallelujah is that Alright remember with God in Genesis 1 God for God he created the heavens and the earth and then the second verse says and the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the water see I love that because even though Satan whatever he did cause this world ain't there to be in a place of void darkness is that what's happening now because of his influence this world is void it's dark nobody knows what to identify themselves with a man except the bride of Jesus Christ but you must understand this darkness before the daybreak gets darker young it gets darkest before dawn why is it the darkness is riding against the light hallelujah but there is no darkness ever that can defeat the S you in or the som no matter how hail hell conjugate and how they gathered together to defeat us they cannot defeat us because within us is God hallelujah so you gotta understand God is right now separating the darkness from the light a man just like in the Genesis he separated the drive Allah Garland's from the water and the night from the day God is now he's alpha and he's Omega he's the beginning and he's the ending and right now God Amen just like when the earth was born God separated everything then he made Adam right he was first a spiritual man dust of the earth right but before he formed Adam out of the dust of the earth Adam existed Adam was a spiritual man Adam was in his theophany hallelujah and then God brought in amen that's what I try to tell people you know Adam was a tree so when God formed him out of the dust of the earth Adam stood up cuz Adam had not fallen Adam stood up cuz God built up from the earth all the way up formed him like that hallelujah loosed him from the Trump which we call toes hallelujah and Adam began to walk and talk when God breathed in him he became a living soul is that right and he was made out of the image of God but Adam had a head of a commandment Adam was to do I be fruitful and multiply and his children were to be born I brought forth into the earth by the spoken word hello now you got to understand this we were not to come forth like babies he was to speak Adam wasn't wasn't formed like a baby he was a man he came as a man and therefore when Adam said it is something we became animals and therefore we had to be born like animals and God said from this moment on woman you'll because you'll be smitten right in your womb you'll have this thing to remind you of what you did and sorrow you good you you're going to bring forth children you're going to bring for babies children like like animals but that wasn't the perfect way you said brothers you don't know what you're talking about yes I do and according to this message God is gonna replenish this us and he will not replenish this earth with babies that's why when we leave this earth we when we when we leave this Tabernacle poster if this earthly Tabernacle be dissolved he said I have a building I have one I have one who God made hallelujah and when we die we don't go to heaven like babies but we go to heaven like matured men and women already fallen is shaping to that our daughter you're not going to grow no more after that you are who you are and Satan tried to stop the Word of God but the Bible says God speaks arise it'll never come back boy God always had a place of safety God always had a place to hide his people hallelujah hey that's what the Word of God says he'll hide me Oh God hide me in the cleft of the rock and to the storm of life has passed hide me hallelujah kaboom the forces of evil continued here come no no produce he was supposed to be a righteous man but you see he was the only one left of his seed and then here come his boys and they crossbreed they greet with that dog as the daughters who have been caught y'all know then here come what they're spoiling again what you see was in what we call this body of death your body your natural body is a body of death is that right Paul says who's gonna deliver me from this body of death hello I don't care how you love it cutie little baby but that baby as soon as it's born is dying right and you and I must understand Amen as soon as we're born we're in the body of death and we are dying okay how much Holy Ghost you got you're still in the body of death because sin brought it hallelujah and this body could never reproduce because was me was serpent Oh somebody help me here right it's like Michelangelo right Michelangelo amen what he did he evoked roses and you can get a replica you can get a cheap representation of it but it's not the same see that's what sin did it gave us a cheap reference image of the man it was just a replica but it wasn't from the original hallelujah and God is looking for the original that's why God couldn't give you a self received from his own he had to give you the original seen his own seed somebody help me here so you got to understand that's why I you see Christians and a lot of them are just churchgoers Church Jonas cigarette smokers and drinkers him all of these things because they're not in the very image of Christ the only way you can become into the very image of Christ you must be born again somebody helped me here you see and what we must understand it's not by power it's not by Mike but it's by his spirit that's what Adam lost they lost the spirit they lost what we call the theophany they lost amen that glory that covers them hallelujah they lost their garment which was God himself hallelujah and it has taken how many thousands of years for God to clothe his people over again but the only way he could close them he had to bring someone who can pay the price that Adam couldn't pay hallelujah he had to bring somebody that would pay the price that you couldn't pay and that price that he brought that man that he brought was Christ somebody help me here this is why amen Jesus could not be part of Mary and he couldn't be a part of Joseph he had to be virgin born and Mary had to be just an incubator the very blood shell came from God that right the very air came from God everything about Jesus was pure it happened about sex his blood would have been contaminated and it would have been done us no good oh what a mighty lamb we serve right and throughout all of the ages remember the whole book eat the whole book everything you must be identified with everything in the back when God showed me Abel I'm father hallelujah Abel had the revelation somebody help me here see because when you get the true revelation that it is the blood of Jesus Christ whoa with the mercy of grace of God that saves you you got it oh yeah but Cain always thought he had he could work himself to heaven you can't work yourself to heaven Genesis 15 12 there's a man by the name of Abram God showed him I called you and my grace and mercy for you is unconditional in order for you to escape this darkness it must be the grace and mercy of God that God has given to you that it's unconditional hello you can't do it you can work it all you want to hallelujah it meant but your work and your righteousness is like filthy rags to God the only way of escape is through Jesus Christ that ride Oh Sun behind look at he toto the Bible a corner of Genesis 15 and when the Sun was going down a deep sleep fell upon Abram and lo a horror of great darkness fell upon him and he said it even know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in land that is not theirs and shall serve them and they shall flick them four hundred years he's talking to Abram and it happened just like he said the children of Israel was in each of us then and you gotta watch this because he says listen and also that the nation whom they shall serve will I judge and athlete shall they come out with a great substance did not it happen four hundred years because God wanted it to be so hallelujah and you gotta understand Amen they were there for forty generations Oh somebody help me here say all Brotherhood's also the nation who may serve right and thou shall go to thy fathers in peace and thou shalt be buried in a good old age let me go on and say this now but he says in the same day so you got to understand that God told him says listen you gonna be placed in the bondage Egypt is a dark place but in order for you to resurrect you got to die hallelujah you've gotta die in order for you to come up you gotta die and we find out something has to die right so you got to understand that is why God told Moses at the end of the day I want you to take a lamb Meiko show everybody gotta win cuz something has to die in order for them to live now you don't practice and you don't earn a lot of these things but now we get ready to have the real communion holy noon and so we find out the blood has be put on the doorposts and the lintel right make a cross hallelujah by the blood hallelujah not because they've been good not even because they've been better than the Egyptians because remember when they went out into the wilderness the real Israel showed up oh I wish I was back in Egypt all the melons and the leeks in all of us they went back why because it is them they were not sanctified they come that's right by what the blood of a lamb oh we call it the pass over glory to God hallelujah what was that it was like defeating darkness that right remember I'm just gonna jump because I got the scripture it tells us in Exodus that the light I think was a ninth plague that fell upon Egypt was darkness and that darkness was so great you could feel it hallelujah and that's exactly what's happening now in this what we call spiritual Egypt you can feel the darkness it's everywhere you can feel it hallelujah oh come on somebody but it is now the reason that's why we must understand there is a third Exodus that's another XK coming and it can the only way that it can you can make this escape you must be covered by the blood hallelujah but right now death has a grip on so many people hallelujah but the bride of Jesus Christ is moving on somebody help me here everybody that came out of Egypt did not make it to the promised land why because Satan or death darkness still had a grip hallelujah and God said in his word I brought them out y'all better learn this because those were for our example to know because you come out of denomination in our organization the spiritual egypt doesn't mean you crossing over you've got to get the darkness out of you hallelujah and you can't do it it's not by power not by mine but by my spirit saith the Lord it is the only way you can get it out you must call on the name of God hallelujah so what happens the darkness is so great and everything else is so great but at the same time there was light and go show yes even though Israel I mean Egypt had such a darkness that you could feel there was still light and Goshen he meant God where was Goshen closer was where the people of God live hallelujah amen I remember the time when I was in Lima Ohio a tornado maybe I storm that's what it was and everybody basement was flooding and everybody likes was out and every time mine would flicker I said but there's light in Goshen hallelujah and my life stayed on praise the Lord yes because God anointed me to say there was light in Goshen it wasn't me it because he anointed me to say there is light in Goshen why I identified myself with the Word of God when you identify yourself with the Word of God you can't help but to come out as a victory is that right that's why Paul said we're loving conquerors I can look in the book I can see that will more than cover us hallelujah come on somebody one-man army invaded Egypt like one man invaded the United States oh come on somebody the message still goes on it's still live Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever this message right now whether y'all see it or not is conquering the world yes ah it's bringing the people out of darkness death into the light because the Word of God said there shall be life in the evening time no matter how gloomy look how dark it look God is defeating the forces of Satan right now who cares Oh Pharaoh thought he was something and that's the way God does it he makes sure that he gets a mighty man from hell to fight against he don't user nobody he makes it sure that he gets somebody who's gotten a system so tight that nothing on earth can defeat oh come on now think about it here was God he meant coming into Pharaoh's territory and loosed upon us and the people escaped because of the Word of God but listen the moment you start thinking oh I wish I was back oh I like this oh I like that you will now I didn't find yourself with the fall of the children of Israel hey somebody help me here I've got my mind made up my heart is pitched and I know Jehovah God the still lives we're going all the way with the messenger is that right they stayed true to the message they stayed true to the messenger and guess what they ended up in the Promised Land Oh somebody help me here what happens a man the very light of God became darkness to Egypt but like to the children in Israel ma the very light that same pillar fire that became light to us became darkness to the Egypt Egyptians is that right oh yes the pillar cloud by day and the pillar of fire by night but the pillar of fire by night became like to the children of God but you look in the scripture according to Exodus 14 it was darkness to Egypt hallelujah and when the children of Israel began to march through the sea God told Moses don't you worry about it why cry speak your indistinct I'm in this thing and guess what now the composer and the director is on one Accord and when the composer and the director is on one Accord hallelujah it can't help but to work out right is that right it's when the composer is trying to do something and the director is doing something else it's when you get a come ask of confusion but when yet composer and they reverence him because they know no matter how much of the music they know they need to know how fast and how slow and when to break and he's the one that's going to direct them in this whole thing hallelujah because if they don't look at him they could be playing the right music at the wrong time you understand and the wrong timing the wrong beat but when they get on the car and that conducted hallelujah amen and he can see that they're looking straight and then walking with him he can do whatever he wants to he can move in this way he can slow it down he can do whatever he needs to do and they're right there with him that's what it is you can't do nothing without God you need the composer on the sin that's why we need the Holy Ghost oh we can't do it without in hallelujah he was Jesus the very word of God and he needed the Holy Ghost y'all help me he Jarman but the Bible said when you John this is the one whose you see that dog coming down hallelujah in the Holy Ghost coming down in the form of the dog and he said this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased to dwell in what was it he was an obedient son and that's what God is looking for us to be an obedient son hallelujah you trying to tell me I'm telling you in this book how this could be so boring to some people when all you get in is his victory over victory and joy of a joy and you see God's accomplishment yesterday and you know he can do it today hallelujah come on somebody is that right millions of people he baptized one time in the Red Sea right they come on off the show shouting and dancing and that shows you you can be justified y'all hear me and you can shout and dance on the justification there had not been sanctified yet because the wilderness was their test to be sanctified is that right I think it's Deuteronomy said I brought you out here so I can try you so you can see what's in your heart Pauline ouya that's what we're here for every test we go through it's for our own good hallelujah and that test is to see what's in your heart is that right my mom said when he went when his son died in it excuse me his wife died and his baby died and then his brother died and his daddy died and and the devil said see you know I went out preaching every time you don't told people that God loves and here it is he he don't love you he look lady left let all these things happen to you he said I stopped thinking about him like yes yes yes but when it came down to him telling you telling me that God wasn't real oh it's true it's too late now he said that that party time I realize hallelujah God is he's a meant to be praised you limitate without the holy ghost you'll be like a Peter who wasn't converted you run from your trials your right from no test hallelujah but once Peter was converted he said don't crucify me my god turn me upside down well somehow they help me hit us more this evening so you can understand amen this God I'm talking to you about amen he's the greatest of all things and he humbles himself he humbles himself and he comes to occupy your heart ha so you can be great he wants you to be great but he want that greatness in him that right David was a little shepherd boy how a man he had a little small job you know working the sheep and back in that day was like being a garbage man hallelujah it wasn't respected at all matter of fact it's daddy jesse was ashamed of him hallelujah amen he didn't want to hear Jesse to come before Samuel right Sam you had to say don't you have another son hallelujah much ago say oh you don't look all bright you know brawny and big like my other brothers other sons but you know brother say he look like a hallelujah and daddy didn't want him to be seen and the process I'll surely you've got somebody else because God don't make a mistake where is he go call him I can see David coming up in there a man with the face of a cherub don't look like no King to me but you see those are the kind God uses and any what you look like from here is what you look like from your heart God knew David's heart he was designed to be a king hallelujah that's why God chose you it wasn't because of all the mistakes you made you're gonna make him your in the body of death that's what Paul said who's gonna deliver me from this body of death hallelujah who gonna do it who can't do it nobody but Jesus oh lord have mercy you know there's two laws amen there's a law of the Spirit and the Lord of flesh amen he said then Paul says is it he said I find him a law that when I would do good evil is present with me for I delight in the law of God after the inward man but I see another law in my members warring against the law of my mind and bringing me into what captivity to the law of sin which is in my member so so Paul said I ain't perfect not like that he said I find myself doing things I wouldn't do but one thing that's good for me I got another law I got a law of life that pull the roll over rise the law of death right and Paul said the law of life one day would change this law this body of death into immortality somebody help me here see you gotta understand if you don't trust God's Word you might love forget it trust the Lord with all your heart he didn't say some of it he said oh you ain't gotta see what the ends gonna be not like that he done already told you but Joel Joel jokes they're all hard you know what is the ain't gonna be job had no idea hallelujah what his end was gonna be until God got ready to tell him right but before God told Joe what the next move was God asked job where were you when I was you when I created everything where were you when the sons of God began to shout and dancing jump for joy why are you I'll tell you Joe I'm giving you a revelation you were with me you were always with me hallelujah I've never lost one oh and another lose one why should I feel perfect love casts out fear hallelujah it is all about my goodness is His goodness and I do right only because I want to please him hallelujah mmm you got to understand that Jesus suffered for you and me that was the only way xscape that was the only way to break out of this jailhouse we had to have a leader and his name was Jesus Christ hallelujah is that right he we're dead which was the greatest jailhouse of time it's time cuz gonna be destroyed hallelujah and Jesus went down there and he went right there to the warden the big man knocked him down took his keys he says all mine coming up out of here gee it was darkness over light but the Sun had to set but wow the Sun he and he conquered death hell and the grave hallelujah basically he was saying it's time out for this foolishness I'm going to show you something what this was all about you didn't know but I'm the second Adam and what you don't know is there's gonna be more of me you try to cop to me you try to get rid of me but I've got another plan in store yeah and you know what the devil couldn't comprehend it because you're gonna tell you something darkness can comprehend like hallelujah a man here was Jesus dying on the cross we finally got that prophet we got him he always tried to kill the royal seed hallelujah because he was looking in your heart what God said in Genesis 3 that come alone that would bruise your head and your bruises healed that was done on Calvary but he didn't understand the fullness the one of God said who shall declare his seed there's got to be a generation that would declare the seed of God hallelujah and you and I we are that generation if you are sealed with the Holy Ghost we're getting ready to move hallelujah in such a way that devil is trembling you can see the politics you can see the earthquakes you can see everything moving amen and that darkness is gathering together amen against the Lord and His Christ once again this is an exciting moment hallelujah we don't have to cry and scream like Moses because God had already showed us he conquered you don't have to cry and that right oh come on somebody I'm almost done but just like Paul Paul called a revelation Paul understood Amen what he was about is that right and he knew that death had no victory over him he understood what Jesus did Oh hallelujah I can see the Paul laughing oh he wasn't screaming and squirming I got a quote he's not one screaming screaming or about to die I'm going me wrong dropping by no it's just like the disciples when they were in jail understood it meant that this was all for the glory of God hallelujah and I can almost hear him singing the song something like this you don't know like I know what he's done for me you don't know like I know what he's done for me and that jailhouse begin to rock and the prison doors all put hallelujah and the angel said now you can go you must be you can't take a portion of the world you must take it off whatever he said yesterday he means it today and forever more hallelujah you want your victory it's in the learn take him at his word hallelujah it's the only way of escape y'all understand me it's not all I know the Bible knowing the Bible don't save you that feel theologians right now they can out quote every one of us hallelujah knowing the message don't save you Paul said you could understand all mysteries and have it profits you nothing what we need is God in the house I'm not talking about this building I'm coming y'all know that you are the temple of God we need God in the house hallelujah we meet the composer we need the man who can turn on lights hallelujah is that right that's what we must understand this is a war going home folks hallelujah but you know what we're not doing the fighting what you're fighting for you know who's doing the fighting he is you can't beat the devil it's God in you that beats the devil you can't defeat the devil God the devil went right to eat and being that he was a part of Adam she should have been able him right from creation hallelujah but he's asleep Oh somebody help me about every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God receive it was the woman now the bride must come to know man does not live by bread alone but by every word to proceed out of the mouth of God humiliates him sometimes he sends waves of death waves and try to put you in a fear you know me or you gonna die Hebrew boys well if I die let me die somebody that's what the word says if you believe it in Jesus Christ you said you will not die but live hallelujah oh my listen to a prayer brother I'm prayin bleeding God he says finally going in and kneeling down by the side of a baby and just prayed a simple little prayer laid hands upon the baby and said Lord God of heaven and earth who created all things you give us the divine power to break the power of Satan is the power to break the power of Satan why do you say what are you saying brothers listen when God told Joshua go down to Jericho I want you to walked around you know what that was that was just something visible so that we could see what was going on in the unseen we can see what was going on it wasn't those people that brought the walls down there was an unseen force behind back hallelujah don't you understand me when you are beaten to the word it bring it releases the unseen force of God he told the Israelis that you don't have to fight about I will fight your battle mm-hmm am i preaching too long or something listen he says listen who created he said you you got you give us divine power to break the power of Satan over this life in the name of Jesus Christ Satan come out of the child and it shall live turn around the father thank you lord thank you mother and this is what's happening the mother in the father started thinking and then began to laughing and going on Oh see that's when you really believe when you know that you know the prayers getting been answered you don't go and say oh let me check the fever he said that couple began to God can heal my baby oh no Ward's me I gotta wait and see nothing like that he began to read job they began to rejoice amen and the little nurse was upset she that's what people he's calling minded people to get upset what you doing you acting like you don't care I care but he doesn't already answer my prayer y'all understand me Amen the little nurse was upset and she said say you know how saying it's alright to have faith but that baby is dying said how can you act so unconcerned about it while I said you understand you understood the doctor said the doctor said the baby is dying it's been unconscious now for over a day saying you misunderstood the doctor the old patriarch said no I didn't understand or misunderstand the doctor said I heard what he said the baby is gone him why but you see when you when this cardiogram shows that that heart in that condition said it's never in all history ever raised up again said it is all right to have faith but said it can't fake can't do nothing now the old man with the steady hand looked at the nurse and said lady you are looking to the child and I'm looking to the divine promise that's how you escape the evil forces body believing the promise oh my god listen if the prayer that you pray is true he said I know this that some of us has come has more faith than others and those who have abundance of faith are supposed to pray for those but if you don't have don't live the right kind of life you better leave away from it the devil will laugh at your prayer but when you live right and do right and act right and have faith in God Satan will tremble when you speak because God swore on the obligation he would take care of that prayer that's true if you live right you stay right you pray right and he'll answer right hallelujah glory to his name hallelujah oh listen no weapon formed against do we really believe that I don't give a switch crap you do doctor or nurse no weapon formed against you shall prosper and every tongue that shall rise against the in judgment thou shalt condemn what this is the end this is the heritage of the service of the Lord and their righteousness is of me said the law not my righteousness his righteousness hallelujah you love the Lord I'm almost done so you and I must no Samson was defeated for a long time he had his days of glory and everything but there's a time he was defeated hallelujah hallelujah now you think God is gonna let something be defeated and you're not gonna go through it sometimes but at the end of the day he brings it back up to a place so he oh god I let you fall yes he will he will but you got on the father hello and at the end of the day Samson woke up out of his sleep sometimes we get into this thing and we have to be even God has to wake us up what are you doing where are you how did you get here wake you and then when he wakes you up he puts you on such a fire you out you ready to avenge all your sins well what about Joshua see I told you I'm almost done you gotta be identified you want your victory and read this book these this is the instructions to all of your victories read this book Oh Josh wouldn't needed just a little bit more time you know I'm not gonna leave out here like a loser hello even if God said you know if I if I asked for an extension of time in this life it's only because I want to be victorious I don't want to lose leave out here and not be victorious you understand me I don't know what heaven is mine but I know in my mind I want to hear well done that good and faithful servant well done being saved i'm saved hallelujah I believe you I do but I will relieve out here in such a way Amen that we that songs that there's no big change hmm because the virtues of God is missing I'm telling the truth you reach I'm at a rapture these virtues must be on display it is the blood in spirit form and don't tell me I can't do it like like they said to those spies coming Oh giant signal a I don't had this problem for a long time I was born with giants but David said those dahlias can be conquered I'm a witness I killed Goliath and I had stones ready for his brothers yeah we're giant Slayers and we are conquerors we will conquer this age will walk upon the ashes of this age hello somebody we are hallelujah we are dating to defeat every darkness that comes our way we are here in the light of God is in us to destroy everything every work of the fresh God petals has ordained us in this evil age I'm glad to be here I'm glad that God is now moving me and bringing me to victory at the victory after the I do it but he waited I waited upon the Lord they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength they shall mount up with wings of eagles they shall run and not be weary this you're walking nothing that is a true scripture last day we are our balls and don't expect to be like nobody else you know the more the word come seem like the less the crowd is but that scripture there'll be a great falling away it's going to be people don't love God like they used to they wait and you know people coming to church and they just so ready to leave the word is God has serving all this good food I understand the Bible says in the last days there be lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God and it's true it is absolutely true Satan and death has a grip on the people and they don't have no idea where he's taking them but I could tell you where he's taking them he's taking them to hell and they don't even know it hmm people understand they better understand you don't get the one chance at this and if God is in you you better run with all your heart and do all you to get God more God more God I can't get enough I want it just like David said I want my cup running over let me explain something to in closing when a man a woman has done all they're supposed to do for God two things happen they either go off the scene and death oh god just put him in a place whether it just came because the work is done and because God has a time he has a time to move people on and he's not going to jump that time and you know y'all know what I'm saying I'm really I mean I'm sincerely saying these things and then I have some people call me from all overseas and tell me how God has blessed them through the ministry blessed them through the song and is always on time hallelujah I'm looking at the last earnest of my ministry and I believe this is it I believe that what I'm doing now is basically the last and what I'm doing and when God raised up whatever it would come through what I'm doing you know y'all understand what I'm saying I just do believe that and I I just know that whatever God is doing he's gonna do it I can't look at the way things are looking you know I didn't have a falling away like Noah Noah had millions or whatever everybody was coming to see Noah come see the site y'all know how they do they treat it like a Cedar Point come see the side of this Ark yeah you got to climb the mountain to get to it you know what I'm saying and no doubt he had more believers than eight cuz that's the way it goes Jesus had multitudes and at the day end of the day he can only get a hundred and twenty in the upper room this message had thousands maybe millions follow us now look at it now and you got to understand everybody in this message is not yet the Holy Ghost there are those who are getting the marker to me oh absolutely if you don't get the Holy Ghost you get the mark of the beast if you don't you fall into a systemic way of worship that is Satan's mark and people don't understand many of them making fall of Moses and everything else and they ended up with if you want to look at the type they ended up with a mark because when you don't receive God you receive the devil when you receive a system over God you receive the mark it's spiritual that's great father we so thank you for your grace in your mercy we thank you for being so good to us you have been better to us and we have been to ourselves
