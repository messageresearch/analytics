uh the closer we get to that time yeah the Lord allows us to become more uncomfortable that can we say praise the Lord God doesn't want you to get comfortable here he wants our Focus to become more so on the things of God Amen we're becoming one with him amen we have to become amen because we are the words can you show him that power you believe that amen we are the words amen so we have to come into the manifestation more clearly concerning who we are the second new song Praise the Lord amen so I don't want to keep you standing long did you Republic um we'll get right into the words Amen in our Bibles amen let's go to First Samuel because I don't know chapter 15. you want to start at verse 12. news verse 12 says that when Samuel Rose early to meet Saul in the morning it was told Samuel saying Saul came to Carmel and behold he set him up a place and has gone about and passed on and gone down to gilgal you still live out the ball my temple Devon the soul you know um and Samuel came to Saul and Saul said unto him blessed be thou of the Lord I have performed the Commandment of the Lord and Samuel said what meaneth the what meaneth then this bleeding of the sheep in my ears and the lowering of the ox in which I hear Samir indeed kids amen let's pray Heavenly Father yeah for again Lord blessing us to be able to come foreign [Music] [Music] and you said that's who you came for questions for those that know that they need help so we don't want to be a proud people because what follows Pride because sweet like like logo is destruction it's like destruction and father we need healing we need help to help us to be humble to your Holy Spirit we ask this in your name the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ Jesus Christ amen amen amen God bless you Saints you maybe and I want to continue reading on now scripture I just didn't want to keep you standing long I do starting at verse 15. it says and Saul said they have brought them from the amlicites for the people spared the best of the sheep and of The Oxen to sacrifice unto the Lord thy God and the rest we have utterly destroyed the is [Music] then Samuel said unto Saul stay and I will tell thee what the Lord has said to me this night and he said unto him say all yes it says in Samuel and Samuel said when thou was little in our own sight was thou not made the head of the tribes of Israel and the Lord Anointed The King over Israel Samir died and the Lord sent thee on a journey and said go and ugly destroy the Sinners the amalekites and fight against them until they be consumed wherefore then did as thou not obey notice this it says the voice of the Lord but thou didst fly upon the spoil and did his evil in the sight of the Lord is so to God I know I told you it's evil not to be his voice can we say praise the Lord amen so let's read on down and Saul said unto Samuel yea I have obeyed the voice of the Lord and have gone the way which the Lord sent me and have brought a gag the king of amlak and have utterly destroyed the amalekites yes so Samuel was a prophet of God did you and man he was the he was a very mouthpiece of God when Samuel spoke that was God's speech did you keep out there isn't that right so here it is Samuel is talking to Saul hello and Saul knows that Samuel is a prophet is he knows that Samuel is a man of God and God is now speaking through Samuel amen he tells Saul you have not obeyed my voice and Saul looks at Samuel who is speaking by the spirit of God and he's telling God no no I did obey your voice Samuel was confused he didn't understand what he was doing and we say praise the Lord God was speaking to him but he was telling God no you're wrong but he didn't think that he was doing that in his own side but he was doing it in the sight of God you he was challenging god dude and he didn't realize since we never want to find ourselves we never want to find ourselves so my title this morning is Discerning the voice of the Lord the voice of the Lord the time we're living in right now everybody's saying they're here that they hear from God amen amen especially in the church ma'am don't produce something called don't eat please everybody want to feel Judy like they're being led by God and many people will say the Lord led me or the Lord spoke to me but the question is did God really speak to you that's very important because the Bible says as many as are led by the spirit of God it says they are the sons of God and the daughters of God can we say praise the Lord so understand this if you don't have the direct leading of God in your life the leadership the Jew you don't have nothing whatever decisions you make if they're not being led by God they are wrong decisions can we say praise the Lord I'm talking about in our everyday lives in home business don't don't hold how you conduct your home the activities that go on in your home right we need the leading of God in our homes Amazon we need to be able to hear God's voice because if we don't have that sound we'll be misled and nobody wants to be misled our young adults you have you get you're getting ready to step out into your careers you just don't want to go into whatever career you want to go into universities can we say praise the Lord I do you want to go into the career or the occupation that God has for you can we say praise the Lord you can't go into a job solely based upon how much money you'll make even though that's what we all want I want to make more money myself but what's the point in making more money if you're outside of the will of God because with that more money is going to come troubles trouble you don't have to deal with it see God has a perfect will you and God has a permissive will you're outside God's perfect will it's what he wants [Applause] for the fam because you want to do it and you don't care enough if you're not fool about his will so God will let you go and have your own way that you don't want his way our Prophet said that God will give you the desire of your heart even though it be against his will stop hold on 10. when he gives you an answer going to do concerning a prayer uh yeah when you've asked him a question and he gives you that answers and he sees that you're dissatisfied with his choice and you come to him again because the answer you gave that he gave you was not the answer that you wanted to hear so you want to go back to God In Prayer if you want to Pray Again because maybe maybe I didn't hear God Christian and brother Brandon said God will give you the desire of your heart just like he did with Baylor should he go es back to him and God came to him and he said no don't go back and he heard dogs but it wasn't according to his desires because our Prophet said that Balaam wanted to curse Israel so he was able to go to God again because of what was really in his heart but notice this when he went back to God the second time for it God didn't give him no resistance the second time fought when God gave him that answer yeah God spoke to me Balaam can say God spoke to me and he wouldn't be lying but even though God spoke to him God said go ahead as though there was no problem but when Balaam went the Bible says there was an angel that was standing in the way to kill Baylor so it would have been much better for him to be accepting of whatever the initial voice of God was so now Saul hello he heard clearly what Samuel told him before they went to fight with the amlikas because God spoke to Samuel and then Samuel spoke to Saul and the instruction was very clear can we say praise the Lord but when he got there and he began to listen to other people then there was an influence to put down the perfect will of God and to enter into the permissive will of God please no that when you put down the voice of God when you refuse to accept the voice of God immediately you begin to follow your voice Saul did not know that he had actually began to be led by an evil spirit that was causing him to do the exact opposite of what God had actually said but when that evil spirit came the soul Saul actually thought Cyrus that he was hearing from God because Saul says I have done I have obeyed the voice of the Lord that is God so when you hear people say the Lord is leading me well the Lord told me you just can't accept that as being God many times people are there by their own desires have you ever thought about this when somebody really like say for instance for example somebody might want um a Rolls-Royce Roy's Royce you've watched your Rolls-Royce right how many don't like how many don't like a Rolls Royce rewards Royce they watch your Rolls Royce I'll take a Rolls Royce if it's the Lord's Wheels but if it's not Lord the Lord I don't want a Rolls-Royce but some people can have a Rolls-Royce sowing their hearts itself until just got screwed if it looks as though if it looks as though they can get one I've watched it towards Royce even if it's not the Lord's will because they so desire it is if somehow a way opens up that they can actually get one many people would think that that was God giving them that Rolls-Royce because it's the very thing they wanted anyway in the yard he sit in the yard he drives your happiness they gotta lose their house because they can't make no house payments but yeah they thought it was of the Lord but everything shows when you lost your house when you can't pay your bills when you're struggling to have this Rolls-Royce that shows you that that wasn't God's will and sometimes people people are so set in their own ways until God has to allow them to make wrong decisions amen they have to train them to what his voice really is the woman you want God get the man that you want Lord have mercy you understand just so you can see right that that wasn't his choice because after you get that person brother said your life on Earth yeah you have so many troubles so many problems see God's way is so much better I don't know why did you said you know so so mayor you understand what I'm saying but you got to come to the place so where you really want God's way in the Bible in Proverbs chapter 3 the Bible says don't lean to your own understanding it said trust in the Lord with all of your heart if you're trusting with all of your heart that don't leave any of your heart to trust in anything else he says trust in the Lord with all of your heart to your own understanding yeah but in all your ways no matter what it is every decision of your everyday life he said in all your ways we pray to God we pray we live a prayer for life amen but we're constantly asking God for his leadership can we say praise the Lord because we don't want to make a wrong move amen without God being with us we want to we want to be able to step correctly we've all made wrong decisions can we say praise the Lord and now we can see back when we look back at those decisions and decisions that you thought you were being Led Led by God to me this is God allows you to make that decision and then he comes to you and he shows you that was not me and now he wants you to look and study that decision study that situation so you can understand where you went wrong because then you learn from that music no you're beginning to be trained to the voice of God now as we begin to make more decisions you will be more careful now you understand what I'm saying because you don't want that trouble no more that came with that wrong decision you don't want to go through those hardships no more an emotional heartbreak when you got the woman you shouldn't have had when you got the man you shouldn't have had and you experienced that heartbreak amen when your mind is on your emotions because of your wrong decision you don't want to go through that no more amen life is a good teacher life life lessons are good teachers for us to help us to begin to find the voice of God in the perfect will of God oh Sons and Daughters of God how many believe you are son and the door of God Amen God wants to more perfectly lead you in your life because you were put here for a purpose amen and only when you find God's purpose in your life will you find will you find satisfaction satisfaction for the young sisters Amari you want a handsome man who I know I'm I'm born and for the brothers they pull it flower I know for a while you're fine you want to be able to look at her time but it's very beautiful can we say praise the Lord you must be able to discern the voice of the Lord because the beauty the the beauty that God brings masculine could you oh man it's beyond a surface a surface image sisters the husband that God has for you he may not be the most handsome man but yet amen because he's made for you once God brings you together in your side once you gain God's sights can I say that again once you gain God's side you come out of your own site and now you're looking through the eyes of God and you know what you will see you will see a handsome man by the way that man treat you and by what God supplies him about Circles by his spirit that that man begins to give to you you'll begin to see he's the most handsome man in the whole world that sister will be perfect for you because it'll be more than just giving you a beautiful look to look at that's right it'll give you the beauty of carrots amen amen somebody that God can show himself to show himself through show himself through schedule to you and it'll be God being a husband to you every husband our example it's on this example it's God did you when I can let God take control of this brother they say drip on the controller Circle then my wife is all smiles when he get off work when he get off work he don't even want to go by the store he want to come straight home so he can be with his wife [Applause] it's hard it's okay he'll be all in love don't I move yeah butterflies all in his foreign but see the what hearing the voice of God is vital you see important you think about yourself right now are you happy excuse me think about it if you're not happy what's the cause of that kisses Jessica because even if you're single memsi was at uh was that uh the scripture says that you should attend upon the Lord it says without distraction see God has to be your best friend can we say praise the Lord so you don't many times young people foreign [Applause] by the relationship that's been established between you and him in your private time in your everyday life let's go to First Samuel chapter three I don't understand I learned that we only had one service I learned we only had one service yeah I thought we had two seconds so now I'm trying to bring everything together they give you a nice meal I was gonna break it up yeah you can give you a three-course meal this morning maybe give you another four course meal in the latter part of the day now I'm counseling my time so now I gotta try to give you a full Place praise the Lord so you can go home and chew on it amen amen but first Samuel chapter three now this is very beautiful and also if I want Matthew because I believe we're all Sons and Daughters I look forward to going in a Rapture with each one of you I want to say this right now if anybody in here see the devil is trying to make you feel like you're not a child of God I want you to cast that thought don't allow yourself to think like that no more foreign because that's not God I look forward to being within the Rapture on that rapturing morning I look forward to being in that Rapture with each one of you amen and that will rise up together by the grace of God God loves every one of us and we are all a work in progress [Applause] you make mistakes you my tomato you might have made a wrong decision yesterday with God understands us and he's here to help us he'll correct us and he'll work with us and then he'll teach us to give us strength to be able to overcome the enemy no matter where he is in our lives he knows how to work with us I got five children I learned a lot I know how to work with them now but I made a lot of mistakes I didn't want to make it but I'm human vegetarian I'm still being trained to the voice of God first Samuel chapter three starting at verse please pay close attention this is very good it says and the child Samuel ministered unto the Lord before Eli jeans now this is the same Samuel I don't remember Samuel that was speaking by the spirit of God see when we read in first Samuel 15. see he was old enough see he had experience with God now you know now now when God speaks to him I may not come true rebound he wasn't confused he knew precisely that it was God because it did you but his life wasn't always like that comes up so here in verse 1 of chapter three it says and the word of the Lord was precious in those days it says there was no open vision and it came to pass that time when Eli was laid down in his place and his eyes begin to wax them that he could not see it is where the lamp of God went out in the temple of the Lord where the Ark of God was and Samuel was laid down to sleep Samuel was laid down to sleep so now Samuel asleep he's in the temple of God don't don't put the Jew doing the service unto the Lord on selfie on the cell phone he was a prophet he was born a prophet and we say praise the Lord see so he heard her voice but he couldn't discern that voice he responded but he didn't know who he was responding to tell me amen verse five thou said sunk so because he didn't know who he was responding to hello in his mind he said well you know he lies here and I heard the voice so let me go see what Eli wanted I don't know so it says that he ran unto Eli and he said here am I notice this thou call this me got you my happily he heard the voice of God why don't you have what did you but he thought it was the voice of a man see at this point he's growing I said we're going to you but everything is not clear yet I don't doubt that there's times among our young people dude that God is speaking to you but you just can't quite understand it just yeah notice this and he was doing a service unto God badger the word no more in the dictionary everybody with me the word no the meaning of no in the dictionary it means to develop a relationship with someone it says through meeting and spending time with them [Music] everybody in here not just young people you could be in the church for 10 years 15 years or 30 years and still not know the Lord you understand what I'm saying that's nothing to be ashamed about but if you're able to recognize that it's a blessing to you [Applause] to get to know the Lord because there are many people understand this the Bible says there are many people yeah that are walking through this life and they're having experiences with God he's on this experience meaning the true anointing of God it's coming down upon their lives the most important thing foreign even though they were being used by God memories they were living their lives they were being led by an evil spirit right he said depart from me for I never knew so I don't Rejoice because I can preaching I don't Rejoice because somebody might say oh brother you preached a good message oh you're a man of God I'm beyond that because of my life in my personal private life listen you know if you got a relationship with God enough you understand what I'm saying don't let first John chapter four I don't know I'm going back to First Samuel three but I want to touch on First John chapter four got them listen to this this is very important we're dealing with Spirits please understand Spirits are in this room right now you understand what I'm saying they're folks that are coming to people's minds right now and if you can't discern that violence you could be listen you can be given place but considering the thought of a devil that's trying to distract you yes from the voice of God you the Bible says in first John chapter four now people don't understand in verse one explain the Bible says beloved believe not every Spirit but then it says but try the spirits whether they are of God will I see sold the jury now you understand that means listen I don't feel confidential when we come to church you know some not just when we come to church we can be at home no some people get real good and looking at everybody else and trying to see evil spirits on everybody else while the movies and speed on two more and they become professionals and being able to see spirits on everybody else but then when they come to themselves they can't seem to see where the evil spirit the Bible says before you can cast The Beam out of your brothers now you can help somebody else foreign so try every spirit I don't improve it do this is free how does the Spirit come to you come on this is see you have a spirit so when the spirit comes to you it speaks to you powder but when a spirit speaks to you you hear it as a thought coming Ponce see many people don't understand they have thoughts all day you're having thoughts right now the Bible saying try the thoughts you having in your mind right now to see whether or not it be of God if it's something that's trying to get your mind during that power did you some people are already thinking about what they're gonna eat it is but God is trying to give us something make sure we don't need to catch your shoes some people are already thinking about what they're going to wear to work tomorrow or what they gonna wear when they get out of church because dress clothes aren't always the most comfortable clothes but dress clothes are not always the most comfortable clothes so some people are thinking but I don't have ten pounds and I can't wait to get out of these clothes and you're already thinking about what you're gonna put on when you get here but we're in church right now and see evil spirits they want to distract us at all times we know ourselves don't we when you at home and you know you need to pray [Applause] think about how that devil tries to distract you oh my God then come on so yes to demo is trap you gotta do everything else but look because of how those don't because of how those spirits come here you don't see it as an evil spirit God to help you to be able to see how the devil is trying to hinder you in your day-to-day life can we say praise the Lord I want to read something here our prophet in a message called hear his voice brother Brandon said he says but listen he says to his small steel voice his steel Small Voice he says every one of you people he said who professed to be Christians he said get yourself quiet before him God was that Devon wreath now remember the word no I don't know it's for you to begin to become familiar with someone through communicating with them and spending time with them many people say they know the Lord and they don't know the Lord they want to know the Lord but they are not willing to put the time to spend time with God maybe there are too many things he last book through the shows take up that time poem was shut down but listen God want to spend time with you more than what you want to spend time with him he's always waiting he's always ready because he loves you let's keep Museum you're the apple of his eyes he wants your attention listen he wants you to want his attention notice how the prophet says every one of you people notice how he says this sisters because at home I wash clothes too because July I'll leave my wife to do everything she's not smacking my father I don't mind helping me you should buy the problem she trying to take care of all the kids and he said dude fixing dinners dealing with the children's problems and I come home and I sit down and I see stuff need to be done and then I say oh that's her job to do that you that's her job to do it I ain't that kind of brother if I see the clothes need to be washed I go take a load of clothes I take them out [Music] and I take I give them to my young boys that's their chore my boy's choice to separate the clothes want to separate the clothes and put the clothes up amen my daughter shares part in that too I got four Sons my daughter is the baby and my my feet maybe one day you'll get a chance to meet him some of the brothers that came down to South Carolina they had a chance to see my family but notice what the prophet says he says get quiet before God he says don't let the washing hinder you oh don't let the washing hinder Elizabeth he said don't let the work hinder so sisters and brothers hello finally sir there might be things that need to be done it puts you it puts you have one of the shows but when the king wants to spend time with you what God is saying you put me you remember me before washing the dishes yet you might say oh I gotta wash the dishes remember Martha and Mary Martha was busy she was cleaning up and Jesus was in Jesus was in the building but she was cleaning up I like don't touch it and in her mind don't sit on sick she looking at her sister she relaxing but she wasn't being lazy see I didn't tell you she was relaxing and it did at the feet see Jesus was speaking about it and it was more important than Mary to hear his voice versus washing a dish that she was not hearing the voice of God okay that was another voice from another spirit that was trying to pull Mary out from the voice of God what did Jesus say oh Jesus you got so many things on your mind he said but Mary has found that good part from her okay he said don't let the washing hinder twice he said don't let the work he said don't let nothing happen he says don't let nobody know what you're doing listen now he said just go before him get up in the woods somewhere get out on the side of the road so that means if you driving somewhere foreign that's the kind of leadership God wants us that's how sensitive sensitive that God wants us to be could you say come on see that's that's what he's growing us up into since the prophet said we're going to get to a place until she won't move Jesus [Music] we're becoming him you're different only you understand that I don't know about you but experiences are increasing experience but it's happening so simple listen God is moving in such a simple way because many people are looking right at God it is me and Brother Rich went out for dinner last night and I mentioned something to him I said it don't happen all the time but they're all tired and I know I ain't the only one it happened sometimes somebody can be talking to you you know we got a lot of things on our minds but sometimes a God God will bring you conscious that's that's him because work on this liquor it's actually and now when you look at that person and now God is bringing you conscience and that's actually him speaking through that person's mouth could you don't understand has that ever happened to you before and as we would God can actually use one of you dripper trees and you don't even realize but it's such a blessing message benediction for God to be dealing with us could you no matter who he's living with us through and to be able to see it you understand that you're capturing the visitation of God Jesus said blessed are your eyes in your ears the prophet says this Prophet Jesus he says go up in the woods somewhere divided he says get out on the side of the road he says go into the secret closet and then close the door why don't that show more secrets he found that book he says when the kids get out at school hey they call his own phone today when your kids go to school he says there get down on your knees amen amen he says you've heard all kinds of voices everywhere I don't have time to get into everything I want to get in here how many real life we need to discern the voice of the Lord how many know that Peter is a Peter was a Son of God he is the Son of God right God used him the preach the gospel your life the same mouth that preached the gospel by the spirit of God that was a Son of God he was an apostle of God giving the keys to the kingdom please understand it don't matter what your relationship to somebody is it don't matter if it's the pastor one of the ministers your husband your wife it don't matter who it is the Bible says try every Spirit they prove it through even though they're your loved ones and they are true children of God sometimes the devil can grab a person and they not even know it and Satan speak out of their mouths Peter was a Son of God an apostle of God but listen Satan was able to step inside and when Satan came inside of people Peter didn't even know it yeah Christ had just made known what his purpose was he had just made noise on boots but Satan didn't want the word to be carried out because he loved Jesus he's talking to his friends that's not going to happen to you when Jesus heard Peter's voice he recognized that was a country boy and even though that was his son and Madison said this on Feast you understand this even though Peter was his very solid the Bible says he looked at Peter and he said get thee behind me thou savior is the things that be a man and not of God the same mouth that spoke by the spirit of God we have to have discernment of spirit world so you can recognize that difference and not just go along with something because of how you feel about that person because of the position that person holds in your life I don't care if it's your father I don't care if it's your mother I don't care if it's the ministry whenever they get off the word hey can we say praise the Lord that's the time we in right now all Prophet says what's that true church comes to the place listen and she said he said by the spirit of God be able to discernment the two Spirits that's working in the framework of the church and he said be able to withstand the Antichrist he says she'll be an invincible he says Satan won't be able to do nothing with him Hallelujah [Music] so as we walk on to know the Lord as we walk on to know the Lord we spend more time with him it changes us you realize the voice of God it got power right yeah the power of transformation how do you think you sitting here this morning this morning devils are being cast out the kingdom of Satan is being challenged by the spirit of God you understand that brother Brandon when he was in those services and he was in that spiritual realm he could see Devil's colors he could see him moving around because people were beginning to believe people were beginning to believe and evil spirits that were on certain people begin to cry out for help wow because they were being cast out they felt themselves getting weak they were losing their holes they understand what I'm saying and the prophet could see that what was happening God was getting the victory God is getting the victory this morning he's delivering his children God is changing your thoughts I'm gonna try to close I'm gonna end with this right here I'm gonna start with this all right tell me that like seven though God is having his ways see I didn't know that in the beginning of my journey when I first started ministering it was a gift that was there but that gift needed to be mature see when you first step off into you into God using you and your purpose you still have a lot of growing to do what's happening you understand what I'm saying God still gotta deal with you to a great degree do I do I covered to bring you the way you need to be um to where you can be more effective effective but the more effective you become May the proves effective good evening you know it's going to automatically come with that video you don't care about no attention you don't care about no reputations [Music] when God is really in your heart everything is about him you will never point the people to yourself because you will know that you are nothing there's no there's no such thing as a good Ministry means down there's no no there's no such thing as a good preacher yeah all we're seeing is god making himself known through certain vessels that vessel ain't got nothing to do with it God survives there is no glory that goes to that vessel I'm trying to stop Jesus himself when he was in the flesh and he would do signs and wonders of America yeah you know what Jesus said he says see that you tell no man about it the Bible says he made himself of no reputation that's the almighty God veiled in flesh brother Brandon said what made him so great it's because he was able to make himself so small yeah I'm getting ready to close I'm just going to leave you with this the end of this quote right here he says get up in the woods somewhere foreign and you begin to lift up if you come on this is a real thing your prayer life our prayer lives can enter into this place to where we listen cause when you first go into prayer the devil don't want you to pray so you said you kneeling down trying to pray all kinds of thoughts come in your mind hmm the devil trying to get you to get up you have to say that was on living you're trying to get you distracted but brother Brandon said you stay there until every other voice is now you've entered into his presence he says then you begin to lift up he says it'll change it he says it'll make you different praise the Lord he says like it did this little Samuel somebody else he says it'll do something to you if you'll just do it he says now it'll make you what you should be it'll make you it'll make you the kind of Christian that you ought to be what is that that's a simple prayer life the Bible said that there's a song that says oh what peace we often forfeit okay we often forfeit we often give up news it says oh what needless pain we Bear Creek all because we do not care just the best Everything To God In Prayer but then once you get in prayer you gotta fight to get into his presence you just can't go and give up can we say praise the Lord praise the Lord you gotta fight and I'm Gonna Leave You with this when you have a chance conference go back and listen did this message hear his voice 1958 October on another October when it comes to hearing God's voice did you he said you have to sit there every other voice because he said but when you get in the prayer God who's gonna take it out PM say what's on your heart these circuits but you can't be in a hurry he said because many times when we go pray he said we do all the Talking new news many people think that's what prayer is I got a lot of problems I got a lot of things it was that very least and you go and you pray and you begin to tell God your list released and once you feel like you don't told him everything you need to tell him then you say oh man no amen and you get up and you walk off but brother Branham we don't give God enough time to speak back spooky new powder kindergarten see for husband and wives poor Maria Farm whenever y'all were getting to know one another if the husband or the wife did all the talking to the power and then give you a chance to say nothing y'all wouldn't be together today when you talk to somebody you have to be interested enough to hear what they got to say back um I recently started to implement this in my life I did it this morning and as I was in prayer I prayed and I just kind of sat there let me know I wasn't in a hurry and after a while yeah additional scriptures begin to come to my mind because we need to hear his voice it's vital to our lives it can be it can mean life or death I'm gonna start right there I could say more but I'm gonna say yes but it's a matter of life and death see um don't play with it it's more important to you than what you may realize right now you must hear his voice [Music] you don't want to be led in a room you don't want anybody to come to you that you might look up to because that might be a true son and daughter of God but in a moment be led by a wrong Spirit tell you something that didn't come from God you want to be able to see that is can we say praise the Lord so you pray for me I'll be praying for you let us all Stand Together praise the Lord amen let's just bow our hearts sometimes Heavenly Father this is very important you're emphasizing it to my heart because you see my need for it that's what you've watched because you're busy they are truly many voices but you only have one voice and Lord is very needful I don't know that I hear that voice the Bible says when Elijah was in the cave he heard a strong wind come by you don't know and that wind knocked off pieces of the mountains but the Bible says that you were not in the wind the Bible says there was an earthquake that came live but Elijah wasn't moved by the earthquake he stayed in the cave laying down even though he felt the earthquake the Bible says that you were not in the earthquake then the Bible says there was a fire and even though Elijah knew that there was a fire he didn't feel to come out to see what was going on at that time and the Bible says but yet when that small steel voice came that voice he had become familiar with family then it caused the prophet to move I don't think of the prophets because he was able to recognize how you were speaking he was able to discern your your movement and your voice and he got up and he wrapped himself he said he said he said in his medal and he came out to hear what more you would say to him Lord he was in a beautiful place to where he was he was familiar with your voice father let us come into that place now Alaska news Lord you're already speaking to us but Lord you speak more than what we're able to hear father help us to hear your voice help us to follow your lead [Music] lord it's causing so many to turn away from the truth unto a lie Lord you calls me to read in your word this morning were Satan's ministers they change themselves to be Ministers of righteousness and they say it says that Satan himself transforms himself to appear as an angel of Light Lord how important is it for us to be led by your spirit so as your Bible says we will try every Spirit every Spirit to see whether or not and we can't do that without you so Lord may you help every one of us here in this building and your bride around the world to enter into that very special it's a sweet place of your presence special [Music] better than we ever knew you before a true relationship with the Living God we thank you for this time we thank you for visiting us by yourself [Music] may this word be further unfolded in the hearts of your children bless each one of them Lord you know they're alive you know their needs you know their situation Lord strengthen them Lord may they receive more of your spirit by your grace in the mighty name if our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ we ask all these things Lord and we pray let's give the Lord a hand clap of praise God [Music] praise God amen let's sing this song it is so sweet to trust in Jesus amen you love the Lord [Music] so sweet to trust in Jesus just to take him out his word oh just to rest upon his promise [Music] oh Jesus Jesus [Music] [Music] Jesus Jesus Precious
