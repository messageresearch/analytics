he has done for me nobody knows like I know what he's done for me nobody else believe I believe Hallelujah as we stand uh let us turn to Revelations the third chapter we really appreciate you being here by the grace of God oh thank you Jesus last week we preached the Ultimate Reality and we said today we would preach part two we'll try to finish it this thought can be Everlasting and uh but we'll try to do our best by the grace of God as we turn to Revelations the third chapter 14th verse and it reads unto the angel of the Church of the lers and right these things sayth the amen the fa the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God let us pray our gracious father God we thank you for your goodness we thank you for your grace we thank you for your mercy and all that you have done for us Lord we pray right now that you would give us Grace to receive your word and to live your word we ask these things in your lovely name Jesus Christ we pray amen amen you may be seated you know I just want to inform some of you all on the lateness of the hour yeah they have a a a form of the World Council of church that is now uh working uh in South Africa in in New Zealand as well as the Congo and they have started putting pressure on the people sadly to say there are some Churches who were part of this message that have now succumbed to the pressure of the Council of churches uh over over even in Trinidad um some of the churches have succumbed to the pressure of of the Council of churches in the trinidadians it is the Pentecostal who is now heading this move and basically you can't become a church or be a church unless you be part of this this this move now brother Bram told us that these things will happen it's not yet here in the States but you know it's coming I'm going to read something uh this is referring to the Congo the Blue Print name social pack for peace and living well together in the de uh uh Democratic Republic of Congo the greater Lake Region is the joint work of the Churches of Christ in Congo the union of the Union of over 60 Protestant denominations and the Catholic Church World Council of churches reported the United Nations says on January 24th it is Gravely concerned about the Safety and Security of civilians and internally displace people in this in the Eastern de Democratic Republic of the Congo he's on at the launch of the church's blueprint Reverend Eric ning General Secretary of the Church of Christ in Congo and fr brother brother sh surely General Secretary of the national Episcopal Conference of Congo said the secret said that the peace and the living well together were an urgent emergency that stood at the people's doorsteps in this Year of Jubilee our prophetic missions makes it our duty to exort people communities and the state of our sub region to fulfill the duty of human beings toward themselves that the peaceful coexistence and supportive coexistence said the leader in a statement we have to read it amen so I thought I'd read that to you this was given to me by a brother but I just want you to realize that we're not far from that translation we know it's going to work it is the Gathering of the Council of churches and like the prophet of God said only interested in the bride because we are the only true Protestants he used Samson for an example and he said before they presented Samson in the time of his persecution in the arena they had all kinds of Tricks going on all kind of animal tricks from monkeys and [Music] everything but he said the main attraction was Samson so understand this they know that the True Believers that follows malach 4 will not bow to that but understand this like I've always said the 70 has already departed from jesus' Ministry but Judas remain remember that and Judas was a part of the congregation or the message Jesus Christ you love the Lord now let's get to our subject we thank God for his amazing grace to me Grace is is forever it it just it just continues and as long as we are in this realm you're going to need Grace we understand by the grace of God that I I'm so happy I almost don't know what to do I I I actually feel like shouting right now those tears were not tears of sorrow but tears of joy that's what the prophet of God said he said when John saw the lamb he he didn't cry because he knew he wasn't unworthy he knew he wasn't worthy but when he saw Jesus who was worthy he said it was tears of joy and when I when I receiv received of the message any good thing the Bible said hold fast to that which is good so when I see in the word how God has given me a way of Escape from the Satan's traps I just get I just get excited the beauty of the whole thing is we know what the end results amen I read that scripture about Jesus being the beginning of the creation of God and I want to see you you you to see where you were at that time like I said it's in a reality it's not it's not fictitious it's not it's not something made up it's real sometime thing can be so exciting you have to pinch yourself is this real and and and that's the way I feel this morning it is so realen brother Adam says back in the making you begin with the germ of life when you become gerti in your great grandfather he said that's scripture Levi paid tithes in The Lord of Abraham his grandfather see all right but your jourm your life your soul began in the creation of God in the beginning didn't Jesus tell his disciples I knew you before the foundation of the world called us ordained us to be Ministers of the Gospel and so for it's the ordination of God all right then I'm going to go to another quote he said God is the Creator and how was he ever created but this is the beginning of the creation of God when God the spirit was created in a form of a man understand that that was God being created God the Creator himself becoming a creation hallu God who made the dirt made the calcium made the cosmic light petroleum took the thing together created himself in the beginning of creation amen am the final amen means to be so be it the final God when God completed in his creation y understand me Hallelujah and in that creation I read the quote you were hallelujah hallelujah I love this because I was in the gene of God you were in the gene of God I know you've heard this thing I know you've heard this before Hallelujah but even when Jesus was being described as MDC or in the order of mzc the Bible said that everything is being held in place by the power of His endless life Hallelujah is that all right so when we think about all of the prees all of the things that Satan is planning uh uh to come against the bride God given us a place of rest hallelujah hallelujah let me let me read this and know there not 65 you started back there as a seed and work down to where you are now and then you were all in Christ and when Christ died he died to redeem all of you and you and you are part of this word and he said and how can the Bible all of it precept upon precept line upon line here little there little not one jot or k shall fail Hallelujah and if you can believe it you can receive it hallelujah hallelujah is that all right also in Corinthians let me read it the fourth verse for though he was crucified 134 and5 and though he was crucified through weakness yet he liveth by the power of God for we also are weak in him but we shall live with him by the power of God toward you Hallelujah so even though I might be weak I will live because Christ lives in me Christ lives in you hallelujah hallelujah now the fifth verse says examine yourself where whether you be in the faith prove your own self know ye not your own selves how that Jesus Christ is in you except you be reprobate now of us who don't know what the word reprobate means it means that which is rejected on the account of his own worthy uh worthlessness okay it also means this word is also used with reference reference to a person Cast Away or rejected because they have failed to make use of the up Hallelujah to make use of the opportunities offered to them you understand at some point like brother said if we're not careful we will cross the line and when you cross the line you become a reprobate hallelujah hallelujah I'm excited I'm really enjoying this this life of the word hallelujah Isaiah 55 And1 love the Lord well I tell you like this you say it ain't deep enough but let me say it like this what deepness is going to do to you for you if you miss this great opportunity Paul said you can understand all my hallelujah hallelujah and you still can't love your brother it profits you nothing hallelujah hallelujah God don't care about how long you've been in the message but concern on how your welfare are you growing are you reing the word that has come to perfect you hallelujah hallelujah you love the Lord Isaiah 55 and so shall my word be that go forth out of my mouth I shall not it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which I please and it shall prosper in the things where two I sent it Hallelujah so this message word will make you prosper you don't have to prosper on your own it will make you prosper Hallelujah now we we have our thoughts you're going to always have that time with your flesh if you're a true Christian if you're a true Christian you're going to have to confess every day Hallelujah you're in a battle every day Hallelujah but don't get confused with the battle the battle doesn't determine who you are hallelujah hallelujah what determines who you are if you can believe that the battle is the Lord hallelujah and you have you will win the battle no matter how no matter how intense the battle become [Music] Hallelujah God has already determined you are the winner Hallelujah is that right cuz I was saying last week can you only imagine what heaven is going to be like Hallelujah when all of this is over I was thinking the other day on how beautiful heav must be my wife and I heard a strange thing this morning here is January this is the month of January and there were birds singing in my tree somehow they they're confused something's going on if the birds are returning in January something's off amen you is that right brother tells us to watch nature Hallelujah and this is not the season something's coming something's coming and it's coming early whatever it is it's coming Hallelujah to God you know when birds come that's a true sign that Easter is about here life they they only return back here to lay eggs they egg in the winter oh my God I don't know what it is but I'm going to keep watching Hallelujah but I was thinking the other day there is not one city here on Earth that I have seen that would make me think about heaven it doesn't matter how big and Grandeur the buildings are it does not make me feel like I'm in heaven you understand me and it doesn't matter how Satan tries to mimic what's in heaven he can't do it is that right even brother Bram said that Babylon the old Babylon had the Hanging Gardens had the Hanging Gardens like the true City Hallelujah but in all that he tried to do where is it now but our city is an everlasting City Hallelujah there be no death there there be no pest there Hallelujah everything will be perfect but when I think about God I'm in the mountains I love the rivers I love the peaceful sound I love the sound of animals you understand me because that reminds me of what heaven is going to be like Hallelujah peaceful Tranquility Hallelujah and the only people that's going to be making noise really noise it's a people like brother brandham running around the tree praising the Living God hallelujah so you know we we we the the the ultimate of our why would you want to miss this anybody like me you grow up you start getting old everything wrinkling everything is wrinkling up Hallelujah you can't hardly get up getting up out of the chair is an achievement y like y don't know what I'm talking about some of y'all older folk y'all know what I'm saying hallelujah there's a time when you can sit down on the floor pull your leg up and tie your shoe I'm just saying nothing here is eternal nothing here will remain the same you can see death working on you already Hallelujah you know when you're missing your hair you put a little something on the top try to spread it out to cover the ball y'all know what I'm saying you can look and see that's death that's not life everything about this world is death what about the people who have become billionaires what they have failed to see they going to meet death and if they don't know Jesus if you don't know Jesus Hallelujah all of your efforts say that ain't scripture ask the Rich Young Ruler at the end of his day he had a call on his life and he refused to call beat the call and he went with the world and he died and he ended up in the region of the L Hallelujah that's what a repeate is a person who missed the opportunity God said to the Rich Young Ruler sell all you have and come follow me Hallelujah Psalms 119 116-1 17 ain't your adversary I'm trying to help you think about it I trust nobody misses it because if you do miss it you will hear my voice preaching to you trying to help you Psalm 119 116 through 17 hallelujah amen here David is saying uphold me according unto Thy word that I may live and let me not be as shame of My Hope hold thou me and I shall be safe and I will respect I will have respect unto thy statue Contin Hallelujah see it ain't us holding us it's God holding us just to show you a mystery they say it take oxygen for fire to burn if there is no oxygen the Fire won't burn so let me ask you how is it that the sun is still burning with no oxygen hallelujah hallelujah the sun is upheld by God hallelujah so you understand when you get to heaven you won't need oxygen to live cuz in that body you don't breathe somebody help me here so now life is not even in the oxygen man should not live by bread alone but by every word that proceed out hey I don't know about you because if I don't have oxygen to breathe that means I won't get tired Hallelujah somebody help me I need God to uphold me like he's upholding the son like he's upholding the moon like he's upholding the Stars I need God to uphold me you need God uph you hallelujah hallelujah glory to God you know we don't understand I think some of us don't this message if the Pentecostal could see it they really would jump in on it but just like the Jews was blinded for the Gentiles Le was blinded for you they cannot see Hallelujah but you claim to have eyes to see oh let's move on this is this is this is is just the ultimate when I think about no matter what Satan brings toward me I am eternally secure hallelujah hallelujah and for those of you who haven't bloomed yet counting on you to bloom amen and those of you who have uh uh is not showing forth fruit I'm counting on it Hallelujah glory to God you know I don't try to uh when I say I'm preaching I'm trying to I'm trying to Quicken the seed in you if it has if it hasn't been quickened I'm not trying to bring you down I'm not trying to call nobody serpent seed or or some kind of tear I'm counting on the whole church wouldn't that be wonderful people say well I don't know about that brother I don't know about that sister with that kind of thought you be you need to be thinking I don't know about me Hallelujah the Bible said it's not the will of God that any man should perish but that all should have eternal life Hallelujah thank you Lord thank you Mark 1211 I believe God and I trust him cuz Can't Nobody Do Me Like Jesus I've had friends after friends after the friends thank God for my friend but Can't Nobody Do Me Like Jesus and some of us we we taken the Hard Away we wonder why bad things happens and sometimes it's because of our doings sometimes God just come to to to to send you through a trial but either way God is still God and he going to get your attention one way or the other Mark 12 10-1 and have you not read the scripture the stor which the builders rejected is become they head of the corner what were you talking about brother the same Jesus that died was rejected he is the Cornerstone and that same Cornerstone has become The Headstone you can't get around it every one of us whether we're Christians or not you're going to meet Jesus he's the alpha he's the Omega he's the first he's the last Hallelujah you're going to either meet him on good terms or bad term but I'm trusting all of us will meet him on a good ter Hallelujah reject him Hallelujah but this is what those who see him can say this what the Lord is doing and it is marvelous in marvelous in our eyes Hallelujah that God would love a sinner such as I hallelujah hallelujah see none of y'all don't know what I've come through but I know what I've come through you don't know what I used to be but I know excuse me what I used to be and I know what I am today Hallelujah and I can truly say only God could have made the change Hallelujah only God could have made the change you know there were times when I was in the Pentecostal church I had some little little uh they FS I thought and I was shouting I was dancing I run up and down I singing all that popular in the church but then there were things I thought with this remain with me hallelujah hallelujah but when the message came somebody help me here when the message came can I say it like this I had a message birth Hallelujah it went in and it changed me that I once couldn't conquer had been conquered y'all hear what I'm saying and and it's not over yet the work is not finished but he that began the good work in me the good work in you fa to complete it Hallelujah he's upholding his word and you're part of the word hallelujah to God that's why the Bible say him that he called he justified and them that he justified he glorified hallelujah hallelujah see what we must understand the word is true it has nothing to do with your feelings it has nothing to do what you do with your mind God has said it God has said it and it shall be done hallelujah it's going to be done hallelujah that's why the Bible says receive the end of your faith Hallelujah don't look for what's happening in the middle it's what's happening at the end Hallelujah to God and don't tell me you haven't seen your in don't tell me you haven't seen your in the prophet of God said I saw you there I'm going to take that as my end those Millions came running to him saying my precious brother I was one of them Hallelujah absolutely glory to God Isaiah 40 41 10 through 11 hallelujah hallelujah my God is God that's right Ain nothing he can't do when Satan say he ain't going to do it just look up at the stars look up at the sun look up at the moon the Bible said the heavens declare His Glory Hallelujah and if God could keep them he can keep me Hallelujah this is a beautiful situation Hallelujah you might be going through some struggles they say your struggles don't last always Hallelujah Every Storm brings a rainbow Ah that's that's what job said J said I'm just going to wait till my change come the secret of Victory is praise and worship because the devil when he when he's messing with you he want he want to make you sad and when you're sad you loses your strength hallelujah hallelujah but joy in the Lord is your strength you understand me turn it on you got to say Lord help me turn it on Hallelujah and when you begin to praise God oh my God God comes down he inhabits the praise of his people come on somebody see let me tell y'all something this is why this is why the Pentecostal churches are so much happier than message people because they don't mind praising the Lord hallelujah but we we've gotten so dignified yes can I say it like this phari Pharisees Hallelujah yes sir you look down on everybody else to God God hates that somebody that's going to worship him yes glory to God when you think of the goodness of Jesus and all he's done for you it ought to set your soul on fire CU I'm going tell you something when you're sad you're not in Heavenly places I'm just telling you Satan has brought you down now you need to let God pick you up anybody anybody's going to the guillotine today the guillotine your ha cut off sorry that was my Southern pronunciation but my point is this think about it you living in a house you got food he got clothing and most of us are putting on weight you know what I'm saying you're blessed beyond measure Hallelujah and Satan wants you not to see that but when you think of the goodness like that song count your many blessings yes sir amen I did this little thing one time and and I I had a white sheet of paper and I put a dot on the paper a black dot and I asked everybody what did you what do you see and they said a black dot it was more than a black dot the rest of the paper was white the rest of the paper represented your blessings the black do just represented your trial that's what Happ happens Satan makes us see our trial and we forget about all the blessings hallelujah hallelujah Focus refocus this morning make the devil a liar because what he is hallelujah hallelujah your world ain't come to an end yet don't refuse this opportunity to get into Christ hallelujah hallelujah like I said last week elderly man came to me some years ago I think I was maybe in Virginia somewhere and he gave me the scripture and I held on to the scripture Isaiah 4110 through1 fear thou not for I am with thee be not dismayed I am thy God I will strengthen thee yay and I will help thee and yay I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness see I need to uphold hold me up Lord behold all they that were instense against thee shall be ashamed and confounded that means those who are wishing praying hurt to me will be confounded Hallelujah they shall be as nothing and they that strive with thee Shall Perish I I don't worry about it when when people don't like you when people come against you why do you get upset God is with you they can't win the battle the scripture said they going to perish touch not my anointed Hallelujah do my prophets no harm that's not just with a prophet that's you you are the anointed and you got a law a law that God is going to uphold Hallelujah it ain't you it's God you better remember this when the World Council of churches if we in that and they start squeezing on us don't worry about it because once they clamp or once they come to that we're going up we're going up Hallelujah that's right that's why the Bible says when you see these things coming upon the earth look up your Redemption D now Hallelujah isn't it amazing isn't it amazing that the whole world is saying they seeing UFOs UF unidentified objects people are laughing at us because we believe that Hallelujah but we don't believe as creatures with big old eyes and strange looking heads our Prophet told us that they were investigating angels said one day it's going to pick you up I'm not afraid of it I don't know how they going to do it but I'm waiting for the trip Hallelujah glory to God you love the Lord people think we're crazy well why why in this day UFOs unidentified objects everywhere some might be scientific That's what Satan will do he scientifically blind the people Hallelujah to the real reality you got to understand that it's got to be real or Satan wouldn't have had nothing to copy it has to be real or Satan would have had nothing to copy glory to God they've seen things yes sir they can't explain it but they want to make it happen come on somebody if if we didn't have a prophet who told us about Dimensions perhaps they would even know about Dimensions Hallelujah but we know that this world is not the only Dimension there other dimensions Where Angels are living where the redeem are living Hallelujah there's a better world behind the Cur I believe hallelujah hallelujah glory to God you love the Lord Hebrews 8 12-13 don't mind me Hallelujah I'm having a good time I trust that you being blessed this morning stop the devil from make listen when Satan makes you sad he can give you ulcers high blood pressure make you have a attack it can make you have a stroke because worry is not an attribute of God hallelujah but I learned something remember I told you about my flowers how beautiful they were not my flowers my wife's flowers but then after a while I know I don't know how long they supposed to last but then they started drooping and I wondered because I'm G tell you something it is a scientific fact you talk and speak happy things to your flowers they will last much longer but if the atmosphere is not right that's right your flowers going to tell you how sad they are it is the trth witness it when the atmosphere changes the flowers change Hallelujah you got to have that right temperature and if you got love in your house how many of yall seen people flowers just grow because they're able to relate love to those flowers I know y'all think I'm crazy but it's true anyhow it's true anyhow you go look at that tree in my yard that tree was planted out of season it was planted out of season and it was it was it was dying and the Holy Spirit I know it was him I said Lord I want that tree to live he said go speak to that tree I spoke to that tree I said You shall not die but going to live so that you and God is my witness that Tree Blossom twice the first Blossom went and it's Blossom again and it's outw it's outgrown the tree that was there before it help the tree and every time I see it I said God you made it happen it wasn't I was inspired to say it f it oh just so many things I can tell you but you might think I want to try I'm trying to be something no I'm not is Jesus Christ the same yesterday and don't even think it when he tells you to do something do it don't even think about it just do it when he say say it say it Hallelujah and then watch what God will do for you hallelujah hallelujah Hebrews 8 12-3 for I will be merciful to their unrighteousness and their sins and their iniquity oh my God some and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more praise God thank you Lord when I was reading that scripture one day blessed is the man whom God will not impute impute sin the holy spirit says you're one of them my life have I had a lot of ups and downs but when God finishes with it all you're going to see is UPS God is wiping away the Downs Hallelujah that's it Hallelujah hallu he that saith a New Covenant he he had made first old now that which decayeth and watch o is ready to vanish away you know what he's talking about the Covenant of Levi he said it's been done away with but who who where where who did who who made the change MDC the another priesthood come on somebody it's the TR Hallelujah a new priesthood Hallelujah you said what do you mean God was doing something Hallelujah and God rewarded Abraham Hallelujah yes he did and we find out that Abraham amen received a child in his old age hallelujah hallelujah and he rewarded Abraham with many other children Hallelujah there's always a reward to those who trust in God hallelujah always first of all the greatest reward God can give you is eternal life what was he saying he wasn't giving you a box with a ribbon on it amen no sir he wasn't giving you a box with a ribbon on it he said the greatest reward I could ever give you it's myself hallelujah hallelujah I give you a a reward I give you a gift that will never fade away that will never get old Hallelujah I give you eternal life that's the greatest I could give you going to heaven is not the greatest walking on the streets of gold is not the greatest here here in the Angelic choir is not the greatest but I give you me Hallelujah is that true that's exactly right Hallelujah when two get married Hallelujah they get all kinds of gifts but the greatest gift of the marriage is the man giving himself to the woman and the woman giving herself to the man that's right cuz everything else will soon Fade [Applause] Away hallu Hallelujah and those of us who saying I wish I had never gotten married you're working against the will of God God put you together and God know you can make it Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah and if both of you ain't going to make it one of you will I'm just telling you when we stop murmuring and complaining start praising God it will change your atmosphere but as long as you murmuring and complaining you got God's hands tight amen y'all better hear what I'm saying hallelujah God didn't tell you you was going to have a Cinderella Story you ought have known you was going to have trouble everybody have trouble I don't care if you been married 70 80 years you have had a lot of trouble why do you think God put on that on that little vow to death do his part he knew you were going to go through trouble y'all don't look at me this is God speaking you can either receive it or you can reject it this not even in my not so when things are not in my notes I know he's the one Speaking y'all hear what I'm saying this could be a beautiful situation amen yes [Music] siru yeah you got to understand God knows what he's doing y'all think God don't know what he knows what he's doing and what you don't understand is God trying to perfect you and he's trying to perfect him hallelujah oh I love you I can love you while you treat me good what about it when you Trea me bad I got to love you anyway I didn't say like you love well he don't love me but you got to love him but she don't love me but you got to love her I'm on the right field now folks don't got tired and mad yeah you to see some of the faces but what people don't understand you going to have to go through it God's molding and making you you got 6 thousands of DNA trouble in you and you think God going to clear it up in a moment well he beats me must Jesus bear the cross alone and all the world go free there's a cross for everyone and there's a cross for me guess what in all all of that you say well brother what you talking about let me tell y'all something we were in the Pentecostal church and here This Woman's husband wasn't saved he kept beating her and she got on her knees and kept praying God will answer your prayer one day he went to strike her and he fell with a stroke y'all hear what I'm saying I ain't trying to put no stroke on nobody but the Bible said touch not my anointing it may look like you going to get away with but God got you he got your number hallelujah hallelujah and you know what that lady loved that man till he died she pushed him around in a wheelchair I'm a witness I'm a witness what he did what God did she pushed him around in a weird chair until he died God don't have respect a person God don't care if you're a woman or a man and because you're a woman that don't mean God gives you less benefits y'all better hear what I'm saying in God's eye there's neither male nor female you got the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost got you y'all use what to God Amen oh folks don't get mad at me I'm telling you way he telling me to tell you but the point is we're living beyond our privilege you got the almighty God in you recognize it use what you got Hallelujah and I'm going tell you something prayer changes things you said Adam prayed and Adam prayed cuz you pray in hope you pray in hope not in faith when you pray in faith you know it's got to happen it will happen John 17 2224 I'm almost done I'm almost done Lord have mercy God show you love you cuz if he didn't love you he wouldn't tell you what you're doing wrong John 17 22- 24 how brother Brooks [Music] know brother Brooks don't know he just say what he tells me and the glory which thou gavest me I have given given them now he said he gave it to me he gave it to you Hallelujah that they may be one even as we are one y'all thinkk y'all got at hard how many times Paul was thrown into jail in prison where all the rats and the infestation of all kind of stuff was Hallelujah and then he comes around he says I learn how to Glory in my infirmities and that's what you need to learn you need to learn how to glory in your infirmities Hallelujah and many of us are still whining like babies be adult in god grow up in the Lord hallelujah nothing no weapon I say that all the time but it's true hallelujah hallelujah i in them thou in me that they may be made perfect in one and that the world may know that thou has sent me and has loved them as thou has loved me you mean to tell me that my God loves me like he loves Jesus father I will that they also whom thou has given me be with me where am that they may behold my glory which thou has given me but thou lovest me before the foundation of the world we've heard that we know we've heard it let it let it sink in our heart this let it be let it become your reality the Ultimate Reality let this be you that God will Express himself through you that he may come and show you how much he loves you Ephesians one I got just a few more scriptures and I let go you and I must come to realize we got to walk in this Faith walk in this faith I had a situation not long ago I had to to deal with a racist person and I said Lord I know you got this person here for me to love them and I said give me the love for this person that when I see them I won't feel this funny feeling not only did the Lord uh give me love for that person but he also made that person get another job wherever he is he ain't where he used to be I had the same situation here in this church years ago I had a really really really bad problem and something was sent to me by way of my uh by way of email or texting whichever but it literally had me crying I was so hurt because I didn't know this person had that in their hearts and I said Lord I have to love this person show me how to do this give me the love that I need and honestly I came to love this person and and his family and at the moment I came to that he left and I was trying my best to keep him here because I no longer had that I loved him and since then all kinds of tragical things have happened to him family I didn't never I never wish [Music] that but I'm sharing these things to let you know whatever your mountain is speak to that mountain and God will move the mountain Hallelujah y'all better hear what I'm saying right having predestinated us now listen let's back the fourth verse according he have chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him where in love that's it people liking somebody you got to love you got to love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will am one more scripture No let let me go to this let me I have to skip some of this but I'm coming I have to skip some of this I'm coming down to so I won't won't keep you too long you know it's so amazing I don't see how we we we we we so acknowledge the devil but we failed to acknowledge God every time the devil is doing soil the devil the devil he get so much praise where does God come in right coming from the message Revelation chapter 5 paragraph 37 brother Adam says now Satan will constantly punch you until you finished here on Earth just remember that you'll never have a time but where there's a punching going on all the time cuz you in a battle did you ask to come to Christ to go on a picnic well you're sure going to be surprised because it's a constant battle I've been on the field for 31 years and I fought every inch of the way that's right Israel have to fight every inch of the way Palestine was to give to was given to them but they have to fight every inch of the way together Heaven belongs to you the new world belongs to you but you're going to have to fight amen let me say it like this I give up anything except Jesus that's right uhuh he comes first he comes before me he comes before my wife he comes before my children and he com before my church hallelujah hallelujah thank you Lord yeah you didn't see me but I was shouting he yeah he was doing it yeah the Book of Ruth listen just just just just to uh give you a thought The Book of Ruth is definitely a book of redemption we know that first of all you know Ruth had to make that decision I'm going I'm going with Naomi just like you had to make a decision I'm going with Christ right after making that decision Ruth had to serve and brother Bram liking that as working your working working out your own [Music] salvation but he said we got into legalism and that's what we did that's why I'm trying trying to pull y'all out of legalism legalism will always cause you to judge other people wrong Hallelujah you out there working you out there working now Hallelujah but but then after that she was introduced to Boaz and y'all know the whole story Boaz told her you know work in the field and all that Hallelujah but then there's a time that that that Boaz she had to come and wait right and see this is what where you fail to see after all of her working she didn't have to work no more Boaz did all the work he went up and fixed up Naomi's house just like Jesus say I'm going to prepare a place for you that where I am there you'll be also right it was Boaz who took off his shoe and and declared that uh Ruth was his wife right he bought her he paid the price right so what I'm trying to say is you you have no price to pay the price is already paid Hallelujah but what Ruth was to do she was to rest on the Promises of Boaz he said you rest here and I'll come back make this thing happen did he make it happen Hallelujah this is how we rest we rest in the Holy Ghost you got theol go you need to just rest stop worrying about whether I'm going to make it cuz you already done made it and maybe maybe you're not to that Perfection yet but God promis you that he'll complete the work in you it ain't you it's him right so you got to move on with God like like Hallelujah did they get married they got married on his promises she didn't have to do nothing but rest on the promise this is what he said the Ultimate Reality of this message if you have the Holy Ghost you should be at rest Hallelujah if you don't have the Holy Ghost you need to get the Holy Ghost that's the only way you're going to be at rest Hallelujah it is the only he he himself in you will make it all happen Hallelujah brother bam said it in Revelation chapter 5 part two he says paragraph 125 he said do I have to be a Methodist do I have to join the Baptist do I have to be a presbyterian he said no sir just get the Holy Ghost and rest we we we we look at all of these things and we we we doing just what Paul said told us not to do with all of the gifts and everything else and all the the the supernatural we done all perhaps have Supernatural things of God but that is not salvation Salvation is when Jesus accept you and gives you the Holy Ghost hallelujah look at the of Israelites that saw that saw the mirac happen and look how many went into the promis I don't know about you maybe you're not selfish I'm selfish I'm selfish when it comes to my soul I'm selfish I only get this one chance you say well it's really not a chance well Paul said it Paul said I have to be careful Les I become a Cast Away hallelujah oh I'm secure and I'm going hold my faith I'm secure and no matter how many times I've fallen he always picks me up let's stand I know one thing I'll know certain ones that have the Holy Ghost when they start treating their wives right love your wife as Christ Lov the church you love your wife let me tell I've been married 47 years I love my wife and I trust my wife I don't have to worry about her cheating on me that's just I never think about it it is a reality in my life that's how love binds you and when it comes to uh love honestly I think a person shouldn't even Mar if they don't love you if it's a business deal you going to have trouble down the road if God don't give you love for that person you going to have problems but you don't made the contract not just on Earth in heaven and the only solution to that is the Holy Ghost solution you see everything work in your behalf seek ye first the kingdom of God it righteousness and all these other things will be add let's bow in a word of prayer father God we come before you we thank you for your goodness and your mercy Lord all that you have done for us no the way is not easy it is battling fights all the time sometimes we're up sometimes we're down in our battles but father there comes a time that you'll bring steadfastness as we mature we will The Falls will stop the Downs will stop and all we will experience is the UPS help us now Lord Jesus to move forward to do what you would have us to do I bind every spirit this morning that stands against the the truth of the word I bind every spirit this morning that will cause the hearts of the people to harden I bind every Spirit Hallelujah that will that will stop the word of God from entering into the souls of the people Lord may let this day make bring a change that's what we here for change not just to be a church member or a church goer or to be associated with The Higher Ground Tabernacle Lord we want to live as Christians we want to stand as Christians father we know our Perfection comes from you because within ourselves we're just as faulty as we ever been but Lord you've made a way for us to change help us see the promises of this word and hold fast to it Lord in your name Jesus Christ bless the hearts and families here Bless the people of god father you know I preach this message only out of the love that you've given to me there's not one soul in this place that I hate or feel indifference only because you've made my heart so help us now that we'll feel the love of God flowing through this church because we realize that our Ultimate Reality each and every one of us would be filled with your Divine love in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen [Music] amen you [Music] Lord I love you in moment in moment like the I'll sing
