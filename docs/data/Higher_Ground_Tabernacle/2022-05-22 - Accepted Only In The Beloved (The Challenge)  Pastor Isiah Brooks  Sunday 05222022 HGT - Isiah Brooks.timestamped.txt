[40:21] but he's given me power to overcome it
[40:25] and i love that i love that you have no
[40:27] idea
[40:29] what that did for me
[40:32] because
[40:33] i inquired of the lord

[40:37] other things could be worse but i
[40:40] personally inquired of the lord
[40:42] and i wanted to know

[40:45] why
[40:47] out of all the things in the world
[40:50] uh uh i had this particular battle in my
[40:53] life
[40:56] and through the ministry of our brother
[40:58] ben he was helping me
[41:00] god answered my question
[41:04] and totally set me free

[41:09] condemnation

[41:34] for so and entrance shall be ministered
[41:36] unto you abundantly
[41:38] into the everlasting kingdom
[41:41] of our lord and savior jesus christ
[41:46] [Music]
[41:57] the first chapter
[42:08] and we're going to read uh from
[42:10] beginning at the 6th verse to the 14th
[42:12] verse
[42:17] [Music]
[42:21] and it reads
[42:23] to the praise of the glory of his grace
[42:27] wherein he have made us
[42:29] accepted in the beloved
[42:36] in whom we have redemption
[42:38] through his blood
[42:40] the forgiveness of sin
[42:42] according to the riches of his grace
[42:50] wherein he have abounded toward us
[42:53] in all wisdom and prudence
[43:00] having made known unto us
[43:04] the mystery of his will
[43:06] according to his
[43:07] good pleasure which he have purposed in
[43:10] himself
[43:17] that in the dispensation
[43:20] of the fullness of time he might gather
[43:23] i love that together in one all things
[43:26] in christ both which are in heaven
[43:30] and which are on earth even in himself
[43:42] in whom also we have obtained
[43:45] an inheritance
[43:47] being predestinated according to the
[43:50] purpose of him who worketh all things
[43:53] after the counsel
[43:55] of his own will
[44:06] i really like that after the counsel of
[44:08] his own will i love that
[44:10] 12th verse that we should be to the
[44:13] praise of his glory
[44:15] who first trusted in christ
[44:23] which
[44:24] excuse me in christ in whom ye also
[44:27] trusted do you trust him
[44:30] after that you've heard the word of
[44:32] truth the gospel of your salvation in
[44:36] whom also
[44:37] after that ye have believed ye were
[44:40] sealed with that holy spirit of promises
[44:44] [Music]
[44:53] which is the earnest of our inheritance
[44:56] until the redemption of the purchased
[44:59] possession unto the praise of his glory
[45:10] thank you for your patience
[45:12] let us pray
[45:14] lord jesus christ
[45:16] which
[45:21] as our brother saying this morning we
[45:23] are the temple of god
[45:25] and lord jesus we thank you father
[45:29] for not being a million miles away
[45:33] but lord you have chosen to abide within
[45:36] us
[45:38] and our father
[45:40] who art in heaven
[45:42] hallowed be thy name
[45:44] lord you are the holy one lord
[45:46] your elohim you are the god of
[45:48] self-existence
[45:50] and because of you we are here
[45:53] it's by your own thoughts
[45:55] we were created
[45:57] and we were made
[46:12] in a
[46:22] in your lovely name jesus christ our
[46:24] lord
[46:25] amen
[46:26] you may be seated
[46:34] we just thank god for
[46:38] uh i'll tell you his goodness
[46:53] and if i would have like a subtitle
[46:58] i would entitle it
[47:00] the challenge
[47:02] [Music]
[47:03] the challenge
[47:04] i trust everybody know what that word
[47:08] means but whenever there is a challenge
[47:11] there is an opposition
[47:15] and you hear me say this all the time
[47:18] we're also not against flesh and blood
[47:21] or spiritual wickedness in high places
[47:26] our enemy
[47:28] as it was
[47:29] since the beginning
[47:31] has always been satan
[47:34] not your brother
[47:36] not your
[47:50] but um
[47:51] i'm not
[47:52] here to just preach on that
[47:56] as the bride of jesus christ
[47:59] we must
[48:01] refocus
[48:04] throughout the years
[48:07] since brother branham has been off the
[48:08] scene
[48:10] we have lost focus
[48:14] the very thing that we were to overcome
[48:30] a denomination
[48:36] that works in organizations
[48:38] and denominations
[48:41] has grabbed a hold
[48:44] uh many of those who claim to be
[48:46] believers
[48:59] lost vision of who
[49:01] they were
[49:03] and the purpose for which they were born
[49:08] it got worse every age
[49:11] if i could say it became more deceived
[49:29] remember brother branham said it like
[49:30] this
[49:32] he said the lutherans
[49:35] were spurring off of the catholicism
[49:40] and then the wesleyans
[50:11] now the power of the holy ghost was now
[50:14] restored or being restored to the church
[50:20] but they failed
[50:23] they came
[50:24] short
[50:26] so much so the bible described the
[50:29] laodicean church age as blind and naked
[50:33] and wretched
[50:38] with
[50:45] but then god pulled out of
[50:48] that
[50:49] pentecostal church
[50:59] because god delivered israel out of
[51:01] egypt
[51:05] but egypt was still in israel
[51:33] of all ages we have more word than any
[51:36] age
[51:40] in more word
[51:43] than any age
[51:46] in in in ephesus age
[51:51] but can you imagine
[51:54] how long it took for those letters of
[51:56] paul to circulate
[52:00] to the various churches
[52:03] hallelujah
[52:04] but the thing in which they had
[52:09] was greater than silver and gold
[52:14] because even though they didn't have
[52:30] even before paul came meme avant paul
[52:33] new zealand hallelujah
[52:35] but paul came to do something
[52:39] he was an extension of the ministry of
[52:42] jesus christ
[52:46] but you can tell everybody
[52:48] it was jesus christ citizens
[52:51] that lived in paul do you have a victory
[52:52] on paul
[52:54] we come to fulfill a purpose
[52:57] and i'll come back to my thought here
[54:22] the denominational
[54:47] of who jesus christ
[55:05] you understand me
[55:07] that spirit is the thing that you and i
[55:09] must be careful about see this
[55:11] priesthood
[55:14] like this
[55:15] once the bride of jesus christ
[56:57] [Music]
[57:11] but let's go back beyond before then
[57:15] with jesus christ
[57:19] he was considered
[57:21] considered a devil
[57:25] because he was against
[57:27] the traditions of the elders the
[57:30] tradition
[57:35] and jesus exposed them in saint mark
[57:37] jesus exposed to mark
[57:40] he let them know it is a face of war
[57:42] it's not the food that goes in that
[57:44] defiles you
[57:49] hallelujah but he said it is the thing
[58:33] so jesus was saying to the pharisees
[58:36] you're a hypocrite
[58:40] that's what he said
[58:41] he said you put all of these laws
[58:44] and all these isms and all these schisms
[58:48] on the
[59:01] against
[59:02] televisions and then they got a big one
[59:04] in the house
[59:09] now we we don't want to realize this but
[59:12] we were free
[59:15] brother branham never left apostles for
[59:17] us
[59:19] he never left a group of ministers to
[59:21] say follow them.
[59:25] but since he's been gone
[59:28] we've had ministers to raise up
[59:43] many people follow
[59:45] [Music]
[59:57] not because of a
[59:58] testimony will follow people because
[1:00:01] they have a gift of healing
[1:00:04] hallelujah some people follow them
[1:00:05] because they might have a little
[1:00:06] discernment yeah
[1:00:08] hallelujah but
[1:00:10] not the reason to follow a man
[1:00:27] hallelujah
[1:00:29] he said brother books i don't believe
[1:00:30] that yeah
[1:00:32] the same system
[1:00:34] system you were to overcome can you
[1:00:35] devote that we failed to do so zombo
[1:00:38] now i'm going to tell you something
[1:00:40] random
[1:00:48] the pentecostals warned them him to join
[1:00:50] them
[1:00:52] wanted him to join
[1:00:53] the baptist wanted
[1:01:06] amen
[1:01:07] and let me say it like this yourself
[1:01:09] you're going to be a virgin unto the
[1:01:11] word
[1:01:11] you must
[1:01:12] you must be in contact with the virgin
[1:01:15] hallelujah
[1:01:18] listen
[1:01:20] let me say it like this because i'm a
[1:01:21] cut to the chase this one
[1:01:36] why did we need another message
[1:01:40] let me say it like this because some of
[1:01:41] y'all don't believe
[1:01:44] why did we need a new testament
[1:01:58] [Music]
[1:02:04] is that a monkey so much so brother
[1:02:06] branham called them
[1:02:07] pentecostal children
[1:02:14] he could not be delivered unto them the
[1:02:16] outer practice
[1:02:26] hallelujah
[1:02:28] just as predestinated as malachi 4.
[1:02:32] that's right
[1:02:58] the victory that god gave us the victory
[1:03:13] see what we
[1:03:15] we do just like denominations
[1:03:18] we judge each other
[1:03:21] we criticize each other
[1:03:23] we try to say who's going to make heaven
[1:03:25] and who's not
[1:03:42] can i say it
[1:04:08] but did paul need salvation
[1:04:24] hallelujah
[1:04:56] me and mine
[1:04:59] not the early church
[1:05:02] they had so much love for each other
[1:05:35] right
[1:05:36] but many times
[1:05:38] people are bringing somebody new into
[1:05:40] the church
[1:05:42] they may not look like you
[1:05:44] may not be dressed like you know
[1:05:47] immediately you want to clean the fish
[1:05:50] immediately
[1:05:52] go catch your own alley
[1:05:55] and if you catch your own
[1:05:57] you can help
[1:06:00] make sense
[1:06:02] so let's go on
[1:06:29] so you can understand how fallen we are
[1:06:31] book of companies
[1:06:33] call ourselves the bride
[1:06:36] we say i'm bright
[1:06:38] i'm gonna hit this but we said oh i
[1:06:40] believe in conduct and orders
[1:06:43] no you don't no one word broken uh
[1:06:47] one word broken
[1:06:50] and i'll tell you what that one word is
[1:06:52] jewish scripture
[1:06:53] church on time
[1:06:56] i just tied it all together
[1:07:03] so my point is i'm on point you can't
[1:07:05] point your finger
[1:07:10] secondly
[1:07:12] ain't none of us
[1:07:22] so if we're going to make that a law
[1:07:24] i'll see
[1:07:25] where we come late we
[1:07:35] just so you know
[1:07:36] that ain't going to save you
[1:07:38] you can be the church every day
[1:07:40] every second
[1:07:53] because he didn't come a few minutes
[1:07:55] late
[1:07:56] sometime he'd come out
[1:07:58] okay
[1:07:59] but god was dealing with him
[1:08:02] as long as you're late
[1:08:03] and god is dealing with you
[1:08:06] let me move on
[1:08:08] i'm taking my time this morning
[1:08:10] try not to be too much longer
[1:08:13] but let me just read you a quote
[1:08:16] coming from is your life worthy of the
[1:08:17] gospel
[1:08:20] brother said look at polycarp
[1:08:51] he said that's life
[1:08:53] worthy it is sadly
[1:08:58] look what paul said in the book of
[1:09:01] hebrews the 11th chapter who got the
[1:09:02] scripture didn't even worship he said
[1:09:04] they were sawed asunder
[1:09:07] is it
[1:09:09] pulled apart is it a
[1:09:11] dictionary wondered about it
[1:09:15] and gold skins don't leave
[1:09:24] listen when the stock market crash
[1:09:27] the
[1:09:28] stock market you don't have water
[1:09:32] you don't have food to
[1:09:35] you know your clothes get ragged we
[1:09:37] don't know how long we've got to go
[1:09:39] through this
[1:09:42] he'll be able to love him
[1:09:46] still
[1:09:57] hallelujah
[1:09:59] there you are
[1:10:01] that's life
[1:10:02] is worthy
[1:10:05] of the gospel
[1:10:08] how is mine and yours
[1:10:10] going to stand come on in my day of
[1:10:13] judgment
[1:10:19] and don't tell me that's a long time ago
[1:10:22] because jesus said one thousand years um
[1:10:26] as one as unto the lord is is one day
[1:10:30] let me read you another here
[1:10:32] you know and satan's son
[1:10:36] will be sealed in the last days
[1:10:40] so you're going to be healed
[1:10:42] you're going to be
[1:10:54] that all that did not have
[1:11:37] glory of god
[1:11:43] [Music]
[1:11:51] because he did not have the holy
[1:12:34] when you got christ on the inside
[1:12:38] of the curse
[1:12:48] see what i'm trying to say excuse me
[1:12:50] said this brother said i fear what i'm
[1:12:53] doing that the churches
[1:12:55] are you're not getting the people to
[1:12:57] christ
[1:12:59] and one thing about that
[1:13:02] you cannot force
[1:13:44] oh all the darkness is turning today
[1:13:50] hallelujah
[1:13:52] he says well he said yeah he said the
[1:13:55] mark of the beast began
[1:13:58] the god
[1:14:43] and everything that these churches have
[1:14:44] given to us
[1:14:47] and we've lived by it
[1:14:51] with salvation
[1:14:55] that's not cinepassa
[1:14:58] even brother branham told
[1:15:00] uh uh brandon tabernacle and probably
[1:15:03] what i'm doing you got to be born again
[1:15:06] you got to receive the holy ghost
[1:15:09] hallelujah is that right
[1:15:11] even before he left he says something's
[1:15:14] happening here
[1:15:15] i'm paraphrasing
[1:15:18] he said we used to have miracles here
[1:15:22] and the people would
[1:16:18] into
[1:16:46] you see so because you've been so used
[1:16:49] to well
[1:16:50] i'm telling you what to do
[1:16:55] because you obey them you're going to
[1:16:57] hell
[1:17:00] that's
[1:17:25] the people where they're getting it from
[1:17:27] these people god will do
[1:17:56] he broke down every tradition he could
[1:17:58] break down
[1:18:00] they had the people in bondage
[1:18:05] washing apart the
[1:18:08] the washing of parts
[1:18:24] literally brought death to them
[1:18:27] what do you mean
[1:18:28] did jesus ever break his words because
[1:18:32] absolutely but he broke the traditions
[1:18:34] of men
[1:18:36] you said what are you saying
[1:18:38] he
[1:18:50] how could he talk to her come on
[1:19:00] but not in the order of the leviticus
[1:19:03] priesthood
[1:19:19] is
[1:20:15] hello somebody they don't need
[1:20:21] [Music]
[1:20:38] listen
[1:20:39] i know what i'm talking about jesus
[1:20:42] they got an eighth angel
[1:20:44] and with him
[1:20:57] they got an eighth angel in europe with
[1:20:59] him angel
[1:21:00] won't the real eighth angel stand up
[1:21:05] huh
[1:21:05] there is an eighth yeah and with him
[1:21:08] what is jesus christ himself this is
[1:21:10] because remember the eternal god
[1:21:21] well when you know maybe i'm not the one
[1:21:23] a potential surprise but there's coming
[1:21:24] a one
[1:21:25] heck yeah
[1:21:39] coming down
[1:21:54] we needed this message
[1:21:56] this is the only message that would give
[1:21:58] you a rapturing of faith
[1:22:04] he hasn't had her revival yet
[1:22:07] that was when he was living
[1:22:09] right now
[1:22:10] the bride is in revival
[1:22:14] excuse me because a lot of times
[1:22:17] passed away
[1:22:20] revival
[1:22:46] [Applause]
[1:22:49] hallelujah
[1:22:53] systematic worship
[1:22:55] systematic
[1:22:57] will kill you
[1:23:01] you say how i know
[1:23:04] i've allowed the satan to succumb me to
[1:23:06] that
[1:23:08] on the event because when the spirit of
[1:23:10] god move on you okay
[1:23:12] it don't move you won't move unless
[1:23:14] somebody else moves
[1:23:17] but listen i don't care if you're the
[1:23:18] only one
[1:23:20] god comes down and anoints you
[1:23:22] for wine give him the praise
[1:23:25] give him the glory that god how do you
[1:23:28] know
[1:23:29] you become systematic
[1:23:32] because you won't read your bible
[1:23:34] you won't read your i'll pray
[1:23:37] until it's about time for church
[1:23:40] you know what i'm saying
[1:23:43] some of us in bad shape
[1:23:45] but we claim to be the word
[1:24:28] and this tree
[1:24:30] is a double has grown around the pole
[1:24:34] [Music]
[1:24:37] and it looks like the pole
[1:24:39] is is in the tree is
[1:25:03] you have never heard a snake until you
[1:25:05] come up against wine
[1:25:08] you don't even know he's there you could
[1:25:10] be standing there foreign
[1:25:30] [Music]
[1:25:37] has affected a lot of people in the in
[1:25:39] the message
[1:25:41] they're so only dying
[1:25:44] and they don't recognize it's death
[1:25:49] let me go on i know i know just help me
[1:25:51] i'm trying to go as fast as possible
[1:25:54] now you say what brother books what are
[1:25:55] you saying
[1:25:57] preached messages
[1:26:02] and david and goliath
[1:26:04] it was showing the condition of the
[1:26:06] church
[1:26:30] we have seen a lot of message preachers
[1:27:00] is
[1:27:30] but we can never defeat them
[1:27:34] if we feel like they're greater than us
[1:27:38] if we're ashamed of our message
[1:27:42] huh
[1:27:44] if we don't if we don't testify
[1:27:47] honestly i i don't know a person too
[1:27:49] long without letting him know that i'm a
[1:27:52] christian
[1:27:58] james
[1:28:04] but i want you to understand that this
[1:28:06] message has come together
[1:28:09] wisdom
[1:28:11] that's what paul said
[1:28:12] in
[1:28:27] we did not come to be another
[1:28:28] organization or denomination
[1:28:34] we came to be him
[1:28:36] louie

[1:28:39] let me say like this week
[1:29:04] you better make sure they got the holy

[1:30:33] she lives
[1:30:35] i'm like you asked
[1:30:36] me
[1:30:37] and i told you
[1:30:39] do what you want to do
[1:30:41] you know
[1:30:42] i'm i'm forgive me the slain but i do
[1:30:45] what people say i say yeah go ahead you
[1:30:47] do you
[1:30:50] scripture
[1:30:51] if that's what you want to do and do it
[1:30:53] this is the secret truth
[1:30:54] listen people here you'll never see me
[1:30:58] acting like a nicoletto
[1:31:15] that's everybody
[1:31:17] i've learned the hard way
[1:31:19] [Music]
[1:31:25] you love the lord
[1:31:29] second thessalonians quickly
[1:31:32] let me get your thought over here this
[1:31:34] morning
[1:31:35] uh
[1:31:37] you know
[1:31:38] listen i'm not here to form another
[1:31:40] little message church
[1:31:42] performing
[1:32:22] by god's grace i don't think i have any
[1:32:24] enemies
[1:32:34] because that's what jesus did that's the
[1:32:36] scavenger israel and i don't do it
[1:32:38] because i have to julie
[1:32:40] i would love because i wanted it
[1:32:42] because it's part of me to do something
[1:32:46] i don't have a hatred bone in my body
[1:32:50] i really don't i don't i don't know
[1:32:52] anybody
[1:33:00] that's just the holy spirit
[1:33:03] that's true i said why
[1:33:05] now
[1:33:06] well what about all those people they
[1:33:07] talk about you put the jeans
[1:33:10] so many things said about me
[1:33:14] i got thick skin when it comes to that
[1:33:17] you know
[1:33:18] to be honest with you i don't care
[1:33:33] it's easy but
[1:33:34] i can't help it because i know where i
[1:33:36] come from
[1:33:39] anyway let's move on
[1:33:41] i'm trying to get us to see the
[1:33:42] traditions of men
[1:33:46] do to you
[1:33:47] fondue
[1:33:50] you know how can brother branham lay out
[1:33:52] a law come on people
[1:33:54] and then tell you to break it eve
[1:33:59] now he'll come and he says okay selling
[1:34:01] service 30 45 minutes
[1:34:06] but then again he'll say
[1:34:08] you ought to at least get out of order
[1:34:09] enough to get long enough to get the
[1:34:10] holy ghost
[1:34:14] huh
[1:34:15] at least ought to get out of order long
[1:34:17] enough to get the holy ghost
[1:34:20] you don't understand what i'm saying
[1:34:22] it's going hard oh i'm sorry
[1:34:24] somebody help him
[1:34:27] no i'm trying to make sense to that
[1:34:44] i don't know french probably
[1:34:48] but my point is
[1:34:51] you want people to hear you wanting to
[1:34:52] understand
[1:34:54] and so i i say this to you
[1:34:57] i'm trying to get you to understand
[1:35:11] [Music]
[1:35:16] [Music]
[1:35:19] because all of us come from different
[1:35:21] churches
[1:35:22] and many of us are carrying the same
[1:35:24] kind of bag that you had over there
[1:35:41] i love this message
[1:35:43] and i understand what god has done in
[1:35:46] 1963
[1:35:49] the change in brother bannon's ministry
[1:35:52] there's a time he preached to the church
[1:35:55] but then there was a time he switched
[1:35:58] preaching to the bride only
[1:36:01] hallelujah
[1:36:02] because he said those who are not of god
[1:36:06] they will get they'll kick the tapes out
[1:36:36] but you gotta be
[1:36:45] and you and i must go on to whatever
[1:36:52] hallelujah
[1:36:53] do i have more time
[1:36:55] let me say this
[1:36:57] y'all i didn't nobody how to say it
[1:36:59] anything but i said yes i do
[1:37:01] i do great now remember
[1:37:17] if there was anybody that was legalistic
[1:37:23] and god chose him
[1:37:26] god chose paul do you have issues with
[1:37:29] them out in the desert for three and a
[1:37:30] half years
[1:37:44] [Music]
[1:37:47] to be identified
[1:37:49] hallelujah the early church
[1:37:52] was called jesus it pleases you
[1:37:54] is that right
[1:37:56] sure
[1:37:57] paul said saul said this what the lord
[1:38:05] it's hard to kick against the prick see
[1:38:08] you where was jesus
[1:38:10] he was in the people
[1:38:12] he was in the christians
[1:38:14] he was
[1:38:27] and you and i cannot even imagine
[1:39:10] the synagogue is not holy
[1:39:12] some perspective i'll say no
[1:39:14] no because no ye
[1:39:16] are the temple of god
[1:39:18] hallelujah you mean to tell me all the
[1:39:20] feasts
[1:39:22] of faith sacrifices
[1:39:38] those were fighting
[1:39:42] but that was jesus in him
[1:39:44] breaking all those traditions
[1:39:47] hallelujah he didn't stop there
[1:39:51] love you sitting
[1:40:19] amen and see that's what people don't
[1:40:21] understand
[1:40:22] in this message
[1:40:24] racism
[1:40:32] where is the holy ghost
[1:41:02] that cylinder white church is this there
[1:41:05] this is the don't say concealer should
[1:41:07] never be labeled
[1:41:10] when i pass through the church in line
[1:41:14] 95
[1:41:30] and i had an old sister come to me and i
[1:41:33] had javi
[1:41:37] being a black man
[1:41:39] casting a white church that's what i saw
[1:41:42] i said i thought we were all washed in
[1:41:44] the blood
[1:41:48] that's nonsense this is nonsense
[1:41:52] hmm
[1:41:53] hey it's the truth and then sometimes we
[1:41:56] think we're better than some other races
[1:42:11] how can you say i'm better
[1:42:46] and when that life is coming through
[1:42:48] that's real worship
[1:42:50] saul yeah
[1:43:36] he
[1:43:50] now we look at this and you and i must
[1:43:51] understand
[1:43:52] who's in the world
[1:43:54] four thousand years man
[1:43:58] hallelujah
[1:43:59] and on the day of pentecost
[1:44:01] it was a great thing you have been gone
[1:44:03] it was a change of something
[1:44:07] is that right
[1:44:08] when when when they honor the leviticus
[1:44:11] priesthood and
[1:44:12] all of that
[1:44:13] there comes another creature
[1:44:32] news
[1:44:34] and if you've got any kind of
[1:44:36] understanding
[1:44:38] you'll know that the ministry of william
[1:44:40] branham
[1:44:43] to bring in the news
[1:44:45] because it was a new testament
[1:45:15] y'all understand me the components
[1:45:17] remain right
[1:45:21] god's spirit was so invisible
[1:45:24] what happens after
[1:45:26] malachi 4 was it malachi was hundred
[1:45:29] years i think because jesus came on the
[1:45:31] scene
[1:45:33] without a vision the people perishing
[1:45:36] so men you know whatever they thought
[1:45:38] was right in there
[1:45:41] what we do not understand
[1:45:54] [Music]
[1:46:10] hallelujah
[1:46:22] because on the day of pentecost
[1:46:35] he was more concerned about this house
[1:47:16] so you can understand i'm not trying to
[1:47:18] tear anybody down
[1:47:38] and so at the end of the day all i found
[1:47:40] you're going to understand just like i
[1:47:41] said
[1:47:42] when you get to these places
[1:47:45] and
[1:47:47] folks expect you you to bow to them
[1:47:58] get away
[1:48:02] john
[1:48:11] now if you come in the bow or however
[1:48:13] you figure you want to have prayer
[1:48:14] that's that's what i'm not talking about
[1:48:24] how we all used to take off our shoes
[1:48:26] when we went to prayer come on
[1:48:47] but uh let me let me let me bring it the
[1:48:50] reality
[1:48:51] the the gravitation of this thing
[1:48:55] if the book is opened
[1:48:57] and the seals have been revealed
[1:49:01] it has come down
[1:49:03] this time the gathering of the people
[1:49:09] and if that be the case let me ask you
[1:49:11] something
[1:49:12] personally
[1:49:36] [Music]
[1:49:37] you can't never say that a certain dress
[1:49:40] we have a code that
[1:49:54] and i'm not saying holiness and holy
[1:49:55] dressing just deepak
[1:49:59] you got to understand where brother
[1:50:00] branham
[1:50:05] he was in a time when america was
[1:50:07] chaotic
[1:50:19] martin luther king
[1:50:31] he was moving in the realm of socialism
[1:50:35] to socialism
[1:50:50] ask
[1:51:31] the holy ghost
[1:51:45] these demonic
[1:52:00] don't
[1:52:28] come
[1:52:33] [Music]
[1:52:42] but it cannot
[1:52:45] [Music]
[1:52:48] but as long as you're in these systems
[1:52:50] no you don't want to sit on your system
[1:52:51] you don't go to my church
[1:52:53] i don't want it jesus and your preacher
[1:52:55] don't preach like my preaching
[1:53:19] [Music]
[1:53:24] um i want you to look up and see what
[1:53:27] all what kind of laws brother branham
[1:53:36] but he didn't tell you to do one thing
[1:53:37] maybe
[1:53:38] make sure
[1:54:07] there's so i'll have to do i have to do
[1:54:08] the rest later
[1:54:11] so that you understand
[1:54:14] that god has done something you drafted
[1:54:17] and many of us say oh we praise god
[1:54:34] he's done something that the devil is
[1:54:36] mad
[1:54:41] with because of fact
[1:54:43] that we are accepted in the beloved
[1:54:45] son
[1:54:48] he he's mad
[1:54:50] because we have a revelation
[1:54:53] that my sacrifice has made me free
[1:54:56] sacrifice
[1:54:57] he's mad
[1:54:59] because he we understand seriously no
[1:55:02] condemnation
[1:55:31] why are we afraid
[1:55:34] of goliath
[1:55:35] that's the challenge
[1:55:38] let me ask you one more question
[1:55:41] i don't care how much conduct and order
[1:55:42] you have committed adultery
[1:55:59] told you about the iphone i mean it was
[1:56:00] just something probably the ipad the
[1:56:02] ipad hallelujah
[1:56:04] come on somebody
[1:56:06] you know nobody can be with you
[1:56:12] but
[1:56:12] god hallelujah and i'm telling you now
[1:56:17] people of god we're we're living
[1:56:20] so beneath our privilege
[1:56:25] god can't use us like he wants us to
[1:56:27] want to use us
[1:56:31] ourselves
[1:56:35] the seals will open
[1:56:38] more consecrated
[1:56:40] and if he had to be more consecrated
[1:56:44] to perform the act or be there when god
[1:56:46] did what he did
[1:56:47] you got to be more consecrated
[1:56:52] no con of mine will be able to
[1:56:53] understand what i'm talking about
[1:57:01] you know especially when you start
[1:57:02] talking about preachers
[1:57:06] but i'm a preacher so i know
[1:57:21] but i'm not here to rule none of you
[1:57:23] suppose
[1:57:25] and if you think i'm here to rule you
[1:57:28] do anything
[1:57:31] you are totally wrong
[1:57:36] in this capstone message
[1:57:40] only love will prevail
[1:57:43] in this capstone
[1:57:45] only the bride will prevail
[1:57:49] we don't have time to fight
[1:58:17] and as long as we got little sex in the
[1:58:19] message
[1:58:21] however i was i i remember being an
[1:58:23] apostolic church
[1:58:26] that apostolic church wasn't a part of
[1:58:27] our apostolic church
[1:58:31] the rule was you couldn't go there
[1:58:34] and you were talking about going there
[1:58:37] you were stepped down for doing such a
[1:58:39] thing
[1:58:42] you know spectacular and that same stuff
[1:58:45] is in the messages
[1:59:01] that's why you need to study
[1:59:03] for the v2g and you need to listen for
[1:59:06] the equity and if i preach anything that
[1:59:08] you don't understand
[1:59:11] first
[1:59:13] lord show me what brother brooks says
[1:59:16] and if you could ever prove me wrong is
[1:59:18] he true you're welcome
[1:59:20] apparently
[1:59:23] know the protocol though
[1:59:25] there's a protocol
[1:59:28] you don't come with your finger
[1:59:34] right
[1:59:36] that's not the way you get anything from
[1:59:37] god
[1:59:41] you love the lord
[1:59:45] there's so much and i i kind of chewed
[1:59:48] it up a little bit
[1:59:49] more
[2:00:00] you understand me
[2:00:02] the bible said do unto others
[2:00:05] as you would have them to do unto you
[2:00:09] the word can never be broken
[2:00:21] if you have a problem with one another
[2:00:24] you know
[2:00:32] mcdonald's
[2:00:34] go buy somebody a good steak or
[2:00:36] something
[2:00:38] show people how much you love him
[2:00:43] last week
[2:00:44] last month
[2:00:46] i meant to make this announcement
[2:00:50] i don't know how we're going to do it
[2:00:55] [Music]
[2:01:01] [Music]
[2:01:04] because
[2:01:06] a lot of us don't know each other
[2:01:10] we know each other by faith
[2:01:13] but we don't know each other's names
[2:01:17] and so even if you got to make your own
[2:01:19] name tags
[2:01:20] messages
[2:01:31] [Music]
[2:01:32] you know i i want to wipe out
[2:01:35] every little
[2:01:37] ism thing in your mind
[2:01:39] that we may have
[2:01:42] traditions
[2:01:44] traditions
[2:01:46] keep us separated
[2:02:02] we've
[2:02:16] never
[2:02:25] and paul says
[2:02:27] we have to fight
[2:02:30] about the unity
[2:02:44] of our industry
[2:02:46] i'm sure she would love the help
[2:02:49] we need to find a place to have it
[2:02:52] or we can have it out here in the
[2:02:54] vegetables
[2:02:55] normally we all can't fit in here but
[2:03:11] graduate into the spiritual
[2:03:40] lord you've been so good to us
[2:03:42] i feel like i chopped your message up so
[2:03:44] welcome cg
[2:03:46] perhaps next time i'll be able to finish
[2:03:51] let the people see
[2:03:56] [Music]
