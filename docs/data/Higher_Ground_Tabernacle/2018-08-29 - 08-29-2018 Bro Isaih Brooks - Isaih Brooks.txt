good we thank God for His grace in His mercy as we stand we're just going to get right into the word of God tonight I sometimes wonder why God uses me I don't know whether anyone else thinks like that sometimes out of all of the people in the world he chose me I still can't figure that one out I have to take what he says we were in him before the foundation of the world so that gives me no ground to boast other than on him and I am so grateful tonight to be a part of God in spite of all my faults and failures I know that he loves me and I appreciate that because see you can love God and that it has no promises but when God loves you it promises you everything revelations the eighth chapter we're living in such an age that we need to know that it is a dangerous time we're going to read the first five verses of Revelations the eighth chapter oftentimes we forget the day that we in this is a dangerous time revelation is eight one through five and when he had opened the Seventh Seal There was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour and I saw the seven angels which stood before God and to them were given seven trumpets and another angel came is stood at the altar having a golden censer and there was given unto Him much incense that he should offer it with the prayers of all the saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne take notice to this prayer that's being offered prayers of all the saints were offered so it's it's a needed thing in order for this scripture to be fulfilled it must be Saints praying so your prayers are needed and the smoke of the incense which came with the prayers of the Saint Saints ascended up before God out of the Angels hands and the angel took the censer and filled it with fire of the altar and cast it into the earth there were voices and thunderings and lightnings and an earthquake so if you let us pray father God we come before your Lord as humbly as we know how and we thank you for your grace and your mercy we thank you for being so good to us from cleansing us Lord from all about righteousness Lord our sins be many but I know father God you cleanse us and washes us every day thank you lord thank you for the blood of your dear son Jesus Christ that perfects us day by day bless your people now give us ears to hear and a heart to receive in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated I like to just title this message before the third woe for those of us who may not know that we are right in between the second and the third in Revelations 813 it says and I beheld and heard an angel flying through the midst of heaven saying with the loud voice woe woe woe to the inhabitants of the earth by reason of the other voices of the trumpet of the three angels which are yet to sound now you and I know and understand by God's grace that two of the walls have already sounded where the venom goes on to say the third one has already and we know by God's grace that the everything overlaps it's a process things happen and you know a lot of times people don't even know what's going on but when you think about a woe it's not something that you get excited about is actually something dangerous coming and you and I must know that we are right in between it you know how can I said there was a time it was three minutes to midnight and I think we're at a place right at midnight just in a moment's time and what Satan is doing to all of us he's keeping us busy and when when you're too busy that word busy means burden under Satan's yoke because that's what it is you're so busy that you literally we forget the time we're living in and we forgotten that millions of people have already died under the first war in the second woke the first wolf for those of us who may not understand was World War one and Jesus said it at at the eleventh hour when he began to call people to the gospel that's when World War one was over the 11th month the 11th day of the month 11 minute 11th hour everything was 11 11 11 and to this day they don't even know how that world war stopped and Men declared that they would never go into another world war and I think it was like 30 years later a second woe came and that wall was world war two now mind you were while one was stopped because God told those angel the full wind stopped because my servants have not received the seal and you and I know that we are not servants with children so God was working with the Jews we're right here at a time where the Jews and now the focus of the whole world even our president just said something about them paying a greater price or the the air is playing a greater price Jew Israel has paid a great price so anyway anyway we realized that there's a little stirring still going on when everybody thought it has settled down we know by God's grace through reading how that Israel is preparing for the coming Messiah now it's amazing how they're preparing and the bride is supposed to be preparing but understanding to the bride gets in her position Moses and Elijah can't come we're not only holding up the rapture but we're also holding up the prophecy of Moses and Elijah because they can't come once they come then you and I understand that the door to the Gentile is over whether Adam said they'll be crying and screaming the name of Jesus and won't get anything and you wonder how come that's so because remember now Jesus changed his name even in the Jewish dispensation they called him Jehovah but then Jesus when he came he said except you believe that I am he you should likewise die in your sin and he went on to say amen there is no other power there is no other name given under heaven whereby we must be saved but the name of Jesus Christ so calling on Jehovah wasn't the key it wouldn't fit the door and so all those Jews that believed in Jehovah in the way they did perished only those Jews who were able to cross over in that time of transition amen they they crossed over from law into grace and during that time him and they they began to believe in Jesus Christ and and the prophet of God and the historian Josephus said every follower of Jesus Christ heard what he said and when Titus came in 70 AD not one Christian was slaughtered in that massacre because they heard what he said you see the armies and camp about Israel Jerusalem don't you go down and get your stuff you keep moving everybody that didn't hear that ran into the rusyn I'm thinking they were safety and sheltered there in Jerusalem and God had turned the table and the place that they thought was a refuge became a deathtrap you and I must understand that's kind of like what our brother John sched was telling us our refuge is not in the shelter of what we call the message it's in the shelter of Christ Jesus being in you now the message is the one the message understand what I'm saying the message can take you there but because you read it and because you believe it doesn't make you safe right because understand that's how the Baptist's believe they believe but have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe even the prophet of God called his message the Holy Ghost message he is the one who gave us the entrance he key he's the one that God unlocked the keys of first Peters that had to your faith virtue acknowledge because we thought once we experienced the Holy Ghost we were done but we find out that when you received the Holy Ghost amen you are now just born and you've got to grow up into a statue of Christ that's why we finding people fall away because they they weren't completely sealed doesn't mean that didn't have an experience with God but some of them are still babies still justified never getting sanctified but if you don't get sanctified you can't have the Holy Ghost God can't see you is what I'm saying testimony he said my Christian friends a sinner friends whatever you do if you believe mean to be sent from God you seek the kingdom of God just as quick as you can and get into it but that's the only safety we have today the world's at the end of the age only in Christ are you saved so you and I must realize amen that there's I read that scripture according to revelation 8 chapter because we know when the seven seals were open there was a silence in heaven there are things that brother Adam seen and he said I cannot interpret them yet throughout the the age of this what we called message men have tried to interpret the silence the silence is only God is the only one who can interpret that and if God didn't let a prophet see it and understand it he surely won't let you see it and understand it until that time comes so you and I must understand a men that went being men began to say oh I got it I got it brother well said even if you had a new name and you knew it a new name you wouldn't tell nobody the Holy Ghost wouldn't even allow you to tell it so you and I must understand him and that we're at a time when everything is being shaked shaken remember I told you how that when David even sought to tow the men I want you to go in there and conquer the Jeb's eyes and I want you to you know possess Jerusalem he said but when you go in I want you to kill the main right and I want you to kill the blind there'll be nothing that's going to defile the city and I really believe that's the hour that we're living in everybody who cannot walk straight with the word if you don't repent God will get rid of you those of you who say I believe the message but you allowing your eyes to be blind to the signs of the time God is gonna get rid of you because there is there will be no man no less nothing that will defile the kingdom so none of your bad habits that make you live hallelujah amen everything that you are you you possess that's not of God has to go is that right yeah that's what I probably preach you and I must come into a perfect statue of Christ but the devil God is so busy and while he has us busy we are neglecting one of the most important things that God has given to us to make it and that's prayer but the madam said I was talking on prayer or power prayer power of speech power of the Holy life amen he said that's what the Holy Ghost is to do some of you people walking along saying well I just can't quit drinking I just can't quit this the Holy Ghost comes to living you to make all these cans get away from you that's right make women stop cutting their hair make them quit wearing shorts and slacks no excuses make them quit tattling oh yes that's what it's for to make you a holy life it'll follow it'll it'll it will follow the instructions of the Bible every time y'all hear what I'm saying see a woman say it's just too hot I just have to wear these give me a headache if I let my hair grow but there's no excuses with the Holy Ghost it's there to make it so it's follow the word just exactly that's what the Holy Ghost is to do so when people don't follow the Holy Ghost exactly it makes it brings us to a question do they really have it or do they have an impostor something that's acting like the Holy Ghost because brother Baron said in his last days Satan will personate he impersonate every gift everything that the Holy Ghost can do he can impersonate except one thing and that's life once the Holy Ghost comes in you and give you light you know that's the Holy Ghost right see it is to make you make you man turn your hair from them have naked women and quit lusting after them in a church member see that's what it'll do it is to quit making you smoke and drink won't be a beach shot and to take that out of you it'll humble you when you do that that's what the Holy Ghost is for it's for a holy life that's right make you quit gossiping make you quit playing cards shooting craps and all these other things that you do around the corner it'll make you quit you're carrying on the way you're doing living unto you to you while a living untrue to your wife that's what I'm gonna do that's right it'll quit making it a quit making you want to marry someone else's wife that's exactly right that's what it is is to make you live a holy life that's what the Holy Ghost is powerful to set your affection on things above where God stands there see the mind of Christ is in you you can't help from seeing those things when you look at them you turn your head that's right is to make you you say oh I can't do it oh I just can't do it sure you can't but the Holy Ghost comes for that purpose that's what it did it comes to take it out of you all of them all habits and things that you're doing right what that's what it came for see you and I we can't do it but the Holy Ghost can do it that's what he came for is that right but like he said see sometimes we just too loose about things were too loose about it we we love this grace and we get loose about it is that right he said that's what's the matter we don't get seal so much we're too loose about things when the inspector goes through to inspect your life you see it if you're not just a little loose about things little loose about your prayer life little loose about that temper little loose about that tongue to talk about others he'll never seal the car some dirty habits some foul things some verga vulgarity mine he can't seal the car but when he found everything in place the inspector then he seals it dare to be anybody open that seal until the car has reached its destiny to where it's sealed for there it is touch not my anointed do my prophets no harm but I say unto you it'll be better for you that a smear stone was hanging at your neck and you were drown in the depths of the sea then even to try to a fin or shake a shake a little on the least of these that then seal see what I mean see so you and I must understand we're just too loose I believe all of us can say Amen we're too loose but God said if you want this you got to tighten up we got to be more serious about what we're working with because you and I must understand only brother madam said like this he said you're gonna either receive the mark of the beast are you gonna receive the seal of God is up to us hmm right we're now like I'm bringing this thing so you can see where I'm at where we are right at a moment's time from the catching away everything is moving in position the earth is groaning hurricanes coming on all kinds of ways and directions earthquakes is that right in depth you know they're so worried about mount st. Helen erupting because they say if it erupts it can literally cause another Ice Age whoo we don't have to be afraid about Mount Saint Helen she can't erupted her we leave per se but we want to be caught up in that number we don't have to worry about Russia bombing us Russia Kate a drop a bomb until the bride is gold so but all the creation is groaning and waiting for the manifestations of the sons of God we're here but we've been dilatory we've been loose and God says tighten it up he don't want us to fear but he want us to be concerned he really want us to be diligent about his promises and his achievements right he promised Abraham success he did and I'm gonna bless you Abraham but Abraham had to be mindful of everything God told him to do and you and I must be mindful of everything God has told us to do in order to make a rapture I believe we're saying but that ain't where we want to be there'll be a lot of people saying who these versions of me say but I don't want to be us be saved I want to make a rapture hallelujah listen what brother Byrne says he says how the pains birth pain struck the world in World War one she had a terrific pain because they had pause and gasps and so forth that almost could destroy the world and in World War two she struck another heart harder pain they had blockbusters and also atomic bombs she cannot stand another labor pain here he said she cannot the world cannot stand another labor pain will she get one absolutely so that's where we are people looking at Russia because we know Russia is one that's gonna send the bomb right people looking and they missing the whole whole political scheme you know of the other of the Catholic Church because she's controlling everything and people don't understand why do you think that these demonic powers have been loosed on the earth like like it has been you know we watch demons and you know look at dmoz and you know posters of demons and we think about some figment of somebody's imagination but people are inspired to draw these things and understand demons have to have an image to be worshiped by that's why the bob said don't make no graven image so when you have images I remember somebody gave my wife and I disfigure reen statues and and then you know they were lovely I love them but a brother with the gift came and said but there's witchcraft behind this I would have never guessed it and the figurines were expensive and he said if you don't believe what I said go somewhere privately break them up and see their reaction I broke them up on a Wednesday and one of the sisters stopped coming altogether and the whole time they looked at me with their faces balled up what was it their plans were spoiled you know and my thing is you know you know people dear Catholic friends that I have you know they pray to this one saying I pray tonight and it works that's why you got so many of them still there because they pray to these statues and they don't understand their demonic powers behind it that will make it happen I'm come on somebody but they think it's God hello they think is God but it's not God if you know your history if you go back in the Bible you'll find out that is the reason why God didn't like images because demons hid behind those things understand me now you say well what do you mean brother that's why we cannot bow to the image of the beast we can't we came back down to an organization or denomination because it is an image it's not God but it's an image and you know we we preach Catholic but it ain't just Catholic is that all of the Protestants have gone to the same thing see but you not have been so blessed because we can see we have eyes to see that there's only one God that's how the Catholic Church got that's how they got started understand the Catholic Church was a pillar Coster Church sure they were they were a real church in the beginning but after 1830 378 D 325 325 ad Constantine during that time won the war and you know there communica cancer got together and all the churches got together and they literally kicked out according to Josephus they literally kicked out all the spiritual ones brother Adam say they had no business going down there huh all of the profits and everything what they kicked out they then began to kill off see what I'm trying to say is who you and I gotta escape we must escape we've got to tighten down we gotta focus cry out before God says Lord keep me help me focus draw me back to that that that way of see that way of sight y'all remember how we first started out we kept our eyes on Jesus but we've allowed all these things distract us and everything else and we're right at the next whoa peppers is that right T Eve Eve should have been this is what he said Eve should have been burned along with the serpent for their awful deed burn because remember fire is the Last Judgement the lake of fire is the last judgment of God and if that was the judgment in the ending in the at the end it should have been the judgment in the beginning but the only thing that kept Eve from being burned is because Adam stepped in and saved her and that's the only reason why we won't be burned because how Adam stepped in and saved us he said but when it comes to this world it's last this last Eid this last Church age he said there will be no one to stand for her why she kicked him out when he came knocking on the door she kicked him out that right he said but Adam intervene taking quickly to himself so that she was saved but when this satanic religion has gone the full course of the ages there will be no one to intervene and she will be burned with her seducers for the and her children and the Antichrist and Satan will all find their place in the lake of fire now you say why are you saying all of this because I want you to understand this literature this word has gone out and it can't come back boy God cannot lie hallelujah and the vision has been made plain the Bible said when the vision has been made pray let him that read it run not walk run because he won't always tarry hallelujah y'all understand me so we look at this thing and you say well brother Brooks what are you trying to say I'm trying to say it's so plain but we've missing it you know you never hear people to talk about this this this religion that sits on seven hills and baba says it was a beast with seven years don't seven heads were seven mounts in those seven hills and that's where Rome said and understand a man she has power over all the earth even now whoa there ain't a witch in the world that can outdo the witch is there they are the highest of all witchcraft yes sir buddy and you better believe Amen that when the Prophet God said all those demons came back down into Hollywood amen and what those Hollywood demons doing now is casting spells on people oh that was a good movie and you don't even know you've been possessed it's coming through the fourth time in China and you think amen his pleasure and the devil is laughing at you is that right brother Brad that's the devil's preaching machine and just like a preacher the world said he preached he's telling you the vision of God but the devil is telling you a vision of hell and all we see now is demonic power coming up as heroes and we're glorifying them and we don't even realize by God's grace that we are being entertained by devils and all they're doing is setting you up to make You mr. rapture is that all right it's the truth mr. truth some of the stuff they got down out now for toys for children out and scared of been a nightmare experience for me these kids are loving it huh and so they dress up women as princesses and everything else and they half naked one thing I do like about them that most of them do have long hair but you know you look at this thing and you say all Brotherhood's what are you trying to say I'm saying we need to tighten up if we want the virtues of God I'll speak I'm preaching to me to folks this is coming this way in that way and we want these virtues in us we must pray that God will allow these virtues to come and when the tests come to prove it we will pass the test ha ha I don't want to be left behind the Lord is my refuge we don't have a rock to run to no more hmm we don't have that there's not a mountain we can climb that's gonna allow us to escape the wrath that is to come how are we going to get out of this place he has given us the mystery he's given us the mystery or the revelation of the mystery to us for our age like he did in the days of Noah is that right in the second Exodus owner in from Egypt a man from Egypt on out of Egypt he gave them the remedy he gave them the that the formula put the blood on the doorpost and a little and you'll get out of here tonight see he's given us the remedy of making the heavens because you and I must understand no unclean thing will enter there in God a plan God don't care if I'm a preacher being a preacher does not qualify me for heaven but being sealed with the Holy Ghost qualifies me for heaven after your faith virtue knowledge temperance patience and that's where a lot of us fall right there godliness we don't even get to bluntly kindness but godliness acting like God living like God behaving like God it is right there with those the spirits get us all of us guilty brother but we got a we we got to get on our knees and pray we've got to ask God lord help us Jesus you say what would pray now see if your prayers are needed for the censors you understand me the prayers of the saints were placed in the sin serves so God expects us to pray there's a place for your prayer hallelujah and those senses amen words are all thus prayers of the saints and what God does when that angel grab that sister and He pours it out what does he do he is literally revenge' her of her adversaries for the devil amen treatments the way he's treated us and in causing us to behave the way we behave everything that we have fallen - lord help me God put it in a sensor it's needed if that means somebody gotta be praying Murilo brother I don't ask they ask a question when the foolish version y'all say this all the time the foolish virgins when they came looking for oil the wise virgin said to the foolish virgin you go pray up evidently that's what she was lacking she was lacking prayer without a prayer life your home is defeated already ain't no Bible studying if you don't pray that you're not gonna have no family time and no pilot studying you don't need pray you're not going to you feel like doing it but if you got an atmosphere a prayer it'll change everything some see uh I wrote in my little notes I said I will not fear the only way you can know not fear is when you have made your call in an election sure you will fear David said though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil I'm not gonna fear the things that Satan is is that right because the Bob said the thing you fear it's the thing that God will allow to come on you your fear brings it alliant even though it's wrong coming at you if he doesn't sense fear he is stopped he might come again but he gonna stop the first time because he expects you to fear everything feels a lion but when a man is being charged for a lion has charged him the worst thing you could do is turn your back cuz he said he know he's got you the thing you've got to do is stand still they're looking right in the face and let him know you don't fear because it's in an animal to fear man that's what the game one told me so it ain't my thoughts is what a game one told me he said you can't fear the animal because they can smell it the Satan can smell your fear and the more you fear Him the more he's gonna come at you I will not fear fear is a distressing emotion aroused by impending danger evil or pain wherever the threat is real or imagined the feeling or condition of being afraid so it doesn't matter whether it's reality or something imagine you still can fear is that right rather than say there be many people who live with certain diseases or what conquer the disease because they didn't fear if you don't fear cancer he can't he can't destroy you but it's only when you fear hmm one one two three says Amen hear my cry of God intend unto my prayer for the end of the earth will I cry unto thee and when my heart is overwhelmed lead me to the rock that is higher than I see that's what we supposed to do when things are overwhelming what we supposed to go to God in prayer I think that's why he said things to bring us back to prayer most of us know that's true God will do whatever he has to do to get our minds and hearts back on him hallelujah and once we get back there he'll fix it for us from the end of the earth will I cry unto thee when my heart is overwhelmed lead me to the rock that is higher than I but thou has been a shelter for me and a strong tower from the enemy hallelujah I was telling somebody to dance a which crowd for no witchcraft my god still is car hallelujah I'm not going to call something Amen like it's something greater than what I got greater is he that is in us and he that is in the well but if we don't put the prayer we don't get the prayer we're turning guarding in the moon is that right the pressure on Israel in order to escape Egypt they had to pray is that right God said I have heard the cry of my people that right and I have come down see when you hear when God hears your car God will come down and rescue you he is our refuge he is our strength he is our deliverer he is all in all there's somebody that's the way it is yes Lord he's been my strong tower is that right proverbs 18:10 said for the name of the Lord is a strong tower and the righteous run it into it and say hallelujah yes I run into the name may the name of what Jesus Jesus Christ is the only name hallelujah that every demon every devil the window amen earthquakes stole everything must bow to the name of Jesus Christ we don't have to fear but you don't you see we feel insecure when we're not praying we're not connected and therefore we feel insecure but brother Branham said like this he said the Holy Ghost comes to give you a charge hallelujah like a battery it comes to give you a charge and if you get on your knees if you feel weak if you feel weary hallelujah you need to plug up hallelujah till heaven amen so God can come down and give you a charge a little here no weapon formed against you shall prosper if you gotta say that everyday before you can believe it you need this hand no weapon I don't care if the biggest which are the biggest devil on earth amen come against you you it cannot want Ukraine when you got prey on your side you got a wall of fire about you and that devil can get through he can't get through you won't embarrass the devil you start praying hallelujah so we've got to refuse people and that's what we need to do when the storms are coming the floods are coming like I said last week I said I feel like it I know that's true my life my life right now I'm going through a flood I thought I knew what the third was I'm going through some hard times I've had some terrible situations but I've never had it like this I'm telling you things that I can't even say from this pulpit he just one person is more than one hallelujah but nevertheless God keeps every promise hallelujah amen I don't care what my children think about me my relatives think about me it makes no difference why because the prayer of a righteous man availeth much hallelujah and what we need to do is stop being dilatory we stop fearing it stop worrying and we need to start praying y'all believe that Scripture the prayer of a righteous man another unrighteous a righteous man you got to have some quality about you hallelujah hey man psalm 46:1 through says that god is our refuge and strength a very present help in trouble present health very present not almost present very present hallelujah help in trouble therefore will I not will therefore will not we fear though the earth be removed though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea though the waters thereof roar and be troubled though the mountains shake with the swelling there are is that right that that captain here was that lady I don't know what she was saying on that ship in there but maybe she just pray the little Lord Lord you're so good to me that captain said did you not hear said I just told you that you know we gonna sink you know this ship can sink you know you know wait things are going I don't remember exactly how he said it but she she began she said yeah I heard you so you see I got it I got a daughter in New York and if the ship make it into New York and still praise the Lord and say I got a daughter in heaven if the ship don't make it amen I feel I got a dog yet y'all hear what I'm saying that is the way I believe a thing he knows you sir worrying no use of fret Amen no fear hallelujah either way is a win-win situation when you covered by the blood of Jesus it is a win-win situation but we need to use Amen you got God hears you God sees you God knows but God want to hear your prayer God won't have you asked for it he said you have not because you ask not hallelujah amen and we ask for something according to our flesh he go give it to you but when you in battle and you say love for your name's sake for your name's sake Lord hallelujah I want this a helping law so I can stand up and praise the Lord and tell God tell everybody what a mighty God we serve when you take that approach go to answer God go come on the scene hallelujah hey man God loves testimonies they overcame by the blood of the Lamb and the word of their testimony is that right he said there is a river the streams whereof shall make glad the City of God the holy place of the tabernacle in the Most High God is in the midst of her she shall not be moved God shall help her and that right early the heathen rages the kingdoms were moved he uttered his voice the earth melted the Lord of Hosts is with us the God of Jacob is our refuge he is mine hello I trustees everybody else's he's my refuge y'all hear me now I was here 59:19 says so shall they fear the name of the lord from the west and its glory from the rising of the sun when the enemies shall come in like a flood the Spirit of the Lord should lift up a standard against it that's what God is trying to do right now lift up that standard how do you lift it up by prayer because when you pray your prayers like instance it goes up to heaven is that right when it reaches heaven God bottles it he puts it in the center why cuz he's got use for it touch not my auntie huh do my prophets no harm hallelujah God said it's better for a man to tired and they'll storm about his neck and cast himself in the sea then to touch one of these little ones is that right God loves you and God is going to revenge avenge us of our adversary you know I said Lord how do I pray how do I pray he said pray like David hallelujah then there was a man other God's own heart God you see my enemy you know who he is now we don't wrestle against flesh and blood like David did but we rationally get spirits and you need to call God as God destroy these enemies not people destroy the enemy I came battle but I can't see hallelujah but God you see it all ah break the yolks Lord don't y'all believe he can break up I think you know if you got faith that God can save your whole house he'll save your whole house uncles and cousins and everybody else God I'm depending on it and you ought to see where you're standing you are the voice in this last age but the bank said the bride of Jesus Christ is the blood of Jesus Christ by the Spirit he made us priests and kings for win next day know now but you apply you get in that position on your knees hallelujah don't be afraid approaching God that's to say that no he didn't call me but I'm going I'm desperate I got a situation here I done prayed and I had everybody fasting and praying now I'm going to see him and if I perish let me perish I'm going to see the king you have to have that attitude does ever say you pray like that you're gonna lose my mind that's what I'm trying to do I want to lose it so I can have here a man and when the enemy shall come in like a flood the Spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard that's what God told me he said I made you that standard and every one of you has become that standard now you gotta live it the flood is coming you know what the flood does a flood moves everything out of the way y'all seen that big flood that tidal wave that hit Japan it devastated it I don't know any any elephants or any building or any whatever stood but God said this one will huh the Bible said this house this Kingdom will stand the greatest flood ever because our house was built upon the rock the florid King beat upon the house is that right but the but it wouldn't it couldn't it couldn't it couldn't shake us down cuz our house was built upon the rock see but if it's built upon the said about said great is the fall there are but that person that's rock is built that's what paul says here's a building built i laid the foundation that foundation is jesus christ if you build the house up on that rock hallelujah well the flood is coming and it is on now but if you are the standard for the saint you are the real genuine Christian christ in you the hope of glory hallelujah and jesus never lost a battle hallelujah and he ain't gonna lose one of you not if you committed on to him you will not lose god will come out as a winner hallelujah and the Redeemer she'll come to Zion and unto them that turned from the transgressions in Jacob said the Lord as for me this is my covenant with them said the Lord my spirit that is upon thee and my words which I have put in that mouth shall not depart out of thy mouth nor out of the mouth of that seed nor out of the mouth of that CC said the Lord from henceforth and forever that's your battle just before the wall the last wall that's where we are right there feasts of the trumpets and everything else y'all know how that's placed there and we're right there at the coming of Moses and Elijah but God can't move to the bride gets in her proper place that means we got to cut off everything die to everything is your brother because I don't know how no you don't but if you can get the Holy Ghost like you all to hear the view the work hello and I think that's the problem we ain't got it like we ought to have we're afraid to say it but evidence evidence evidence the Bible said you know the tree haha by the fruit it bears hallelujah some of us don't have fruit so we need God we need more of God you say are you out of the scriptures no because the scripture says that there was going to come a day with a wheat and the tares what's gonna cry out for the rain is that what the Prophet said he said they're both be crying out and God is gonna send the rain hmm and that rain would fall on the wheat and the tale it is now but it will he said there be a last outpouring you know he said but would not let you see one thing about rain and can't change the seed it just makes it mature it just Germa ties it but see for us who are the seed of God it will bring us to the level that we need to be but let's not wait folks let's get before God says lord help me increase my prayer life change me O God change me and I'm not trying to tell you like I love the way my wife teach the kids how do you eat an elephant one bite at a time that's how you eat an elephant one bite at a time that's how you possess the land is that right jesus said in the Word of God how are you gonna possess it little by little right if you try to take it all at one time you're gonna faint little by little take what he gives you and move forward hallelujah I feel the presence of Lord here tonight I don't know what you feel it but I know he's up in this book idiot and I know that this message came straightly from heaven and I trust by God's grace you've been blessed because ain't no using us worrying what we need to do is pray brother Adam said those Hebrew boys did not even get an answer from God well he said they prayed all night and God never answered them but they were so convicted they didn't go on the feelings they said whatever even if you don't answer me I'm not gonna bow I don't feel him I'm not going bow if I don't hear him I'm not gonna bow cuz I know it is his intentions hallelujah it must have been a wonder to them because the battle was still on and they were still trusting God and as they were walking forward look like look like the fire was becoming more intense but they couldn't feel it see what it is when you in the Holy Ghost you don't feel all that stuff it's only when you and your carnal mind you get the feeling air everything but they were so caught up i've been prayed up they didn't feel it but those old people those old men who were throwing them in the fire were dying left and right boom boom boom hey man and then when they got to a certain place they saw him the word himself huh that's the way we ought to be because the probably God said I meant that this this this uh fire in this age is heated up seven times more so of what they experienced the greatest and most evil is age ever and he chose you as a standard I'll take it I'll be like David your rod and your staff they comfort me this is my confidant and the Holy Ghost strike the word yeah and tells me you it's gonna be alright no weapon faulty we read these scriptures but sometimes God has allow us to go through things for them to come to life better Stan don't fear no evil don't fear fears torment perfect love casts out fear father God we come before your Lord as humbly as we know how we thank you for your amazing grace cleanse us Lord from all our righteousness cleanse us Lord from the evil thoughts in our region II father father father father father father you know our condition Lord oh yeah in your mercy in your grace of amazes me God at Lord I say take this vessel of mine and use it for that globe bring us to a place that we are in perfect harmony with you Lord our holiness our righteousness our brotherly kindness all of the things that need to possess our bodies help us now father give us victory in these battles Lord and father will be careful to give you the praise glory in Jesus Christ's name we pray in the in the in the in the in the in the belly [Music] I believe that we never march around Jericho I don't believe they were playing when they had to shout they shouted near my god to D I really think that that they were saying something really good and then when you think about God put the music Amen in front run no music no sad music it was jubilant music wall music something that could encourage the people to keep on fighting you love the Lord I shall not be [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] in my body I shall not be moved
