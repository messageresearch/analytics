morning amen amen just turn around and shake your neighbor's hand say it is good to see you this [Music] amen uh whilst we standing let us open our Bibles to the book of um Jeremiah in chapter one verse four if you go in there say Amen if you still need more time just say help me Lord the book of Jeremiah chapter 1 and verse4 reads then the word of the Lord came unto me saying before I and before thou before I form thee in the belly I knew thee and before thou camest fought out of the war I Sanctified thee and I ordained thee a prophet unto the Nations and Jeremiah 29 and verse uh 11 reads for I know the thoughts that I think toward you say the Lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end then you shall then shall you call upon me and you shall go and pray unto me and I will and I will hearken unto you amen may the Lord add blessings to the reading of word we may take our seats as we continue to read i' would also like to read in Ephesians chapter 2 and verse 10 for we are his workmanship created in Jesus Christ unto good works which God ha before ordained that we should walk in them amen amen for a short time this uh morning we want to speak on a subject called called to a purpose amen amen in the book that we read um in Jeremiah God told Jeremiah that before you were formed in the belly of your mother I knew thee before you were born before you were even conceived I knew of your existence and I ordain thee to be a prophet unto the Nations so Jeremiah became a prophet before he was even born and that's the purpose that he was called to and God gave him and called him to that purpose before he was even born and we know that does not apply to Jeremiah only appes to each and every one of the children of God before you were born on this Earth before you were even conceived God already knew these and he already had a purpose for you amen amen so for you to know your purpose you have to go to the maker Lord what's my purpose nowadays they tell you you can can become whatever you want but no you were not supposed to become whatever you want you were supposed to become what God wants you to be because he is the one who has a purpose for you you just didn't come to leave grow pay bills and die but he has a special purpose in your life in I know my redeemer believeth paragraph 27 the prophet of God says and god did did not make you and I just to see if he could do it he made us for our purpose therefore there is a purpose of us all being here you are not here just to be another human you are here because that God made you for some purpose amen amen you are not here just to eat the food that God growed you are not here just to leave in the house that men made or to wear the clothing that somebody else fashioned here for a specific purpose no matter how little you think you are no matter how big you are you you are important or how unimportant you are you are here to serve a purpose amen amen that's the word of God telling us you did not just come here to live and die you have been predestinated you have been called to fulfill God's purpose in your life amen amen you know when you buy something from the store something that you have to put together you can sit and you say I'm I went to school I have five degrees but you sit there and you spend five hours trying to figure out which piece goes all you need to do is go find the user manual and within 15 minutes you will be done because the user manual was made by the manufacture of that device so instead of spending 5 hours if you follow the user manual yourself a lot of time because the person who rather use a manual is the one who created the device knows goes where God is the one who has your user manual he knows what goes where he knows where you are supposed to be that's why David say see the Lord in all your ways and he will direct your paths it doesn't matter how smart you think you are if you walk out of purpose if you walk in the way that God did not mean for you you will not succeed you might not understand what's going on all you have to do approach the one who made the user manual your user manual and if you follow it you work in his purpose and you will work in the way that God intended you to be we thank God for the use manual hallelu when we look into that word of God he tells us what we need to do amen amen in the Bible read of David David had a purpose when God was done with Saul he he told the prophet Samuel and he say stop mourning over Saul I'm done with him but I have a special person that I have to be anointed a special person who has a purpose to be a king and Samuel went to the house of Jesse and he says I have a word from the Lord that in your house there is a king and Jesse was right there he says I have a lot of young boys called all his sons and he says here they are pick your choice and Samuel the prophet he was right there with a horn of oil he went to elab no oil could come out he came to the Second Son no oil could come out he came to the third son no oil could come out because the first second third fourth that was not their purpose amen the purpose of being a king God had predestinated someone the fifth brother came the oil did not come out six seventh came nothing came out Samuel will said something is wrong God never lies why is there no King here then J says like oh there's another young boy who's in the back of the Wilderness who's hurting sheep see Jessie did not even consider David he did not even consider him to be a king amen amen but God he does not look at the stature of a man Hallelujah he looks back into this back part of his mind what he has predestinated for you then he says just call him up and then they called him from coming from heading the sheep and then as soon as heed there the oil of own started pouring out oil and they anointed David to be because that was his purpose no one else could come and stand in his place God does not have a replacement for you hallelujah hallelujah so when David was anointed right there his own family didn't even consider him but God considered him so people around you might not even consider you say he's just a useless bom but God does not look at you like a useless bom he that's my child that's my son that's my daughter and I have a purpose for him and David after that he went back into the Wilderness back where he was hurting the Sheep he was not even trained to be a soldier cuz he was just a red little fellow nobody considered him but his older brothers were in the Army but whilst he was there already anointed for his purpose the devil tried to attack him but your purpose will protect you hallelujah hallelujah he was anointed to be a king oh there's a lion that came to steal one of his sheep he went and he killed that lion there is a bear that tried to come to steal some of some of the sheep he killed it he had to overcome why because he was a king there is no lion that could eat him there is no bear that could eat him up because his purpose was not yet fulfilled in God's plan he was supposed to be a king nothing was going to happen to David until he became a king his anointing his purpose was protecting him so whatever purpose you have on your life will prot you Satan cannot do you no harm because your purpose is protecting you there is no sickness that can take you out because your purpose is protecting you so long you have breath in your body so long you are still alive you have a purpose in your life because as soon as you are done you won't stay one second longer God will take call you back home so you are seated right there this morning you got breath in your body I'm here to tell you that God is not here down with you he has a purpose in your life so you got to know there is not enough demons in hell that can stop the God's purpose in your life hallelujah hallelujah oh just turn around and tell your neighbor God purpose I got a purpose so David was sent by his father him say go give your uh your older brothers food even if he was although he was even anointed to be a king they didn't even consider him worthy to enough to go to the war say he just a small boy what is going to do but God was seeing differently and when David came he brought the food to the brothers and while he was there before he went back he had a voice that was in the valley that was blaspheming against the name of the Lord he says what did I hear what's that and they said oh is this giant that's coming up yelling and throwing threats to the children of Israel and as soon as Goliath would start yelling and shouting they would all run in caves and try to hide away but when David heard it he says but hold up I got the Blood of Abraham flowing in my vein I have a promise that I am going to possess the gates of all the enemy hallelujah hallelujah and he remembered that I have a purpose I've been anointed to be a king so I'm not going to die until I become a king that's why he went up to Saul and he says I want to go fight him he just didn't say I want to go fight him but he says what's going to be done for the person who's going to [Music] win because he already knew he was going to overcome he knew his PO purpose was protecting him and they were told oh he will he will get the uh the King's Daughter whatever else he was going to get he says I'll go and he did not hesitate and he ran towards Goliath if you read your Bible your Bible tells you he did not walk he ran towards go he knew victory was certain victory was sure because it does not matter how much Weaponry Goliath Hado that's on my life is greater than the enemy Hallelujah I don't care what giant is in front of me I overcome it because I have a purpose in my life he said listen a be tried to come I killed it a lion tried to come I killed it so what is gol he's just another beast and he ran towards swung that slingshot and he let that stone out what was he standing on he was standing on his purpose he knew he was called to a purpose to be a king so his purpose was a hedge around him his purpose was protecting him and he killed Goliath it does not much matter how many arrows Goliath was going to throw at David they were not going to work because nothing was going to happen to David until he became a king nothing will happen in your life until you fulfill the purpose God has hallelujah hallelujah there is no trial there is no temptation there is no Peril that can take you out until you have accomplished God's purpose in your life amen amen we take a look at Jonah Jonah was a man under purpose he tried to run away and he was right there in the boat and the storm started and they're trying to figure out what's going on but he kept on seting that he knew he was the culprit then he says hold on it's all me I'm the reason why cuz he knew he was trying to run away from it doesn't matter how far you run away from God will always catch up with you you either do it God's way easier way or you try to run away and do it your way but he's going to catch up with you anyways and he says I'm the fall throw me in the in the in the ocean come on Jonah you aown man why do you want people to throw in the ocean do it yourself just jump in he didn't want to be the one to blame for that and they threw him overboard he knew he was on purpose there was not enough ocean that could drown him until he had accomplished God's purpose which was delivering God's word to n so he me out there and he knew God was going to protect him he knew his purpose was going to protect him there was no substitute it to be amen so he they put him in there and God created a fish that came to swallow him even if Jonah was in the wrong hallelu it doesn't matter what you have done it doesn't matter how many sins you have committed God will still protect you you are still in his purpose amen amen your purpose will protect you amen amen there is not enough Devils that can take you out until your purpose is done we look at Esther she knew she had a purpose she knew that she was the one who was supposed to save the Israelites she said although there is a decree that's made out that if the queen goes into the king without being summoned she could be killed but she fasted and prayed and she got up realizing I have the purpose to protect my amen she stood up and she went in fing Against All Odds and she went in and the King she says what do you want if you want even have of my I can give it to you and she got her heart's desire because she was in her purpose there is no Hammond that kill her because she was in purpose her purpose was going to protect her amen the Bible says no weapon from against you shall prosper Hallelujah can give us Isaiah 54: 17 no weapon that is formed against you shall prosper and every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment Thou shalt condemn hallelujah hallelujah this is the heritage of the this is an inheritance of the of the Lord that inheritance is no weapon that is formed against you that shall prosper it may be formed try to work but it will not Prosper hallelujah hallelujah amen amen because the one who formed the weapon is is uh was formed by my God so my God created the one who formed the weapon is telling me that that weapon is not going to prosper hallelujah hallelujah it might try to work but it will not work against me Paul comes in with a word and says all things work together for my good to them that love the Lord so I love the Lord that weapon is going to work but not against me but it is working for my good and hear his voice the prop says says nothing is going to bother you don't be scared to take God at his word hallelujah hallelujah just relax rela and have faith and believe he's watching over you who I like this part he says he'll dis integrate anything that tries to bother you oh it might attack you but it cannot harm you hallelujah hallelujah he will disintegrate that weapon why because all things are working together for my good no weapon formed against me shall prosper in I know my redeem leave the prophet of God say if we were put here for a purpose there is nothing that can destroy us until God's purpose is fulfilled nothing can harm us until that purpose that God has put us here for has been made manifest no no matter how much trouble we have how many heartaches or Sorrows that we go through all of these reasons they will not affect you they will not overcome you until God's purpose is fulfilled hallelujah hallelujah there is no pain that's going to take you out there is no sickness that's going to take you out until God's purpose has been fulfilled amen amen in Isaiah the word of God says the word of God when it is spoken it does not come back to God voice after it is accomplished that which he sent it out for God's word will not return to him void but after until after it is accomplished the purpose which you spoke it for when he said let there be light that voice wasn't going to come back to him was light when he says let everything that has let every seed bring forth after his own kind that word could not go back to him until every seed had come out and we know a word is a thought expressed so before it becomes a word it had to be a thought first amen amen and we know we were in the back part of God's mind we are God's thoughts expressed so we are the word God made manifest because he thought about you before the foundation of the world and he made you manifest so you are the word of God and the word of God cannot go back to him without accomplishing his purpose he will make sure it has to happen you you are the word of God you are not going to go back to God until you have accomplished the purpose that God brought you here for amen amen cuz we are the word god of so we are the word made manifest and the word never ever fails so you can never ever fail so it doesn't matter what comes to me I know it's working for my good I don't care how much depression comes to me I know it's working for my good I don't care how much anxiety comes to me I know it's working for my good I don't know how many Ops can come against me they will not Prosper because God will protect you your purpose will protect you you remember job job had a purpose he was the one who had to catch that Revelation that I know my redeemer there was no sickness there was no trial that was enough take job out because he wasn't going to die until he said I know my redemer lives Satan went to God or rather God told Satan he says have you considered my servant and Satan says what else could you expect you have given him everything he needs you have put a hedge around him I got a question how did Satan know that job had a hedge around him because before he had that conversation with god he tried to go t job but because of that hedge dirty hands on and then God had to give him permission to go pass that hedge for him to touch job amen am so you have a hedge around you you have God's protection around Satan cannot do nothing to you unless God allows it unless God permits it and for God to permit it he already knows that you are going to overcome it because all things are working together for your good he will never give you a trial you cannot overcome he wants you to overcome it so you can come out with a testimony so you can say I know my redeemer you can say I know Jehovah he will allow you to get broke so after he provides for you cat that Revelation I know my God he's a provider Hallelujah he will make you go through battles and he will come and he will fight those battles for you and after you have gone through them you say he is my Jehovah sh he is the god my banner and you can say he's I can say he is Jehovah Shalom he's the god of my peace because he promised me peace the Bible says peace that pass all understanding peace that passes all understanding say peace that makes no sense promised that to you hallelujah hallelujah so long you work in your purpose nothing can do you no har hallelujah hallelujah how many believe they have a amen amen Jesus had a purpose one day he went to a synagogue and they gave him the scroll to read and as soon as he got there they gave him the scroll and he opened it up to the book of Isaiah let's go to Luke 4 ver and as they gave him the scroll he didn't look for any other word he didn't start reading in the beginning was the word he went right to where his purpose was verse 17 says and there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Isaiah and when he had opened the book he found the place where it was written the spirit of the Lord is upon me because Heath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to the captives what was he doing he was reading out his purpose to the people he's saying this is why I was born I was born to heal the brokenhearted I was born to set free the captives and recovering of the sight of the Blind and to set at Liberty them that are bruised verse 20 and he closed the book and he gave it again to the minister and he sat down and the eyes of them all that were in the synagogue were fasten on him and he began to say unto them this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears what was he talking about he was talking about his purpose he's saying this is my purpose this is why I was born to come and deliver and set you free hallelujah hallelujah he said I didn't come for the Pharisees the Sadducees the self-righteous people I came to preach it to the poor I came to preach it to the blind brokenhearted if you have ever been brokenhearted Jesus came for you if you have ever been captive Jesus came for you because he says that was his purpose and there was not enough Devils that could stop his purpose the purpose the reason why he was born was so he could go to Calvary be that ultimate sacrifice where he would pay for your sins and bring you into your purpose so his purpose was to bring you your purpose that's why when he was in the garden of GS Lord if this pass if this cup could pass I would but nevertheless according to your will I will go why did he go he had a purpose he had you on his mind you saw you seated where you were sitting 2 years ago and he says because of my son because of my daughter I have to walk all the way up to Calvary and God left him Jesus was God and man he was not 50% man 50% God because if he was half man and half God he wouldn't be able to say I know what you're going through because he W feel everything that a man is going through but also he wouldn't be powerful enough to overcome what he were going through so the prophet of God says Jesus was a 100% God 100% man he was man enough to go each and everything you go through that's why he says I know whatever you going through he says I know the Bible tells us that there is no temptation that a man will ever go through that Jesus did not so whenever you kneel down in prayer you pray to God you can say Lord you know what I'm going through you know how it feels feels sick how it feels to go without so please come in my situation and he knows how it feels to be rejected he was rejected by his own father and his father left him God left him when he went to Calvary he was not man God he was only man because God cannot carry sin so rightous he had to leave him and when he walked that road via d Roa all the way to Cal caring your sins and my sins he was a man so when he says I know he knows what you going through if you're going through depression he went through depression if you're going through anxiety he went through anxiety he knows what that feels like if you not feeling well he knows exactly how it feels to be sick if you are broke and you are going without he knows how it feels to be broke through each and everything you can ever go through so when you are praying to God say Lord imagine if it was you what were you going to do was you in my situation and he will come to your rescue because he's been through that route he's been through that rout and he went all the way to Calvary as a man bearing your sin all the sins you committed he died for them your iniquities you committed he died for them the sins you are going to commit tomorrow he died for them he just did not die for them but he wiped it clean so Satan does not have the right to come and accuse you to say you did this two years you can tell him I never did it in the first place Christ came to die for me and he set me free the chains of my past cannot hold me anymore why because Jesus had a purpose to set me free and he was not going to leave this earth until he had accomplished his purpose hallelujah hallelujah when he was lying on that cross his hands outstretched he had you on his mind he had me on his mind and he cried out with a loud voice it is finished my mission is finished the purpose I've been born for is finished hallelujah hallelujah your troubles are finished your sickness is finished why because he accomplished his purpose there was not enough devils in hell that could stop him pilot was not enough pilot was not enough to stop him the Pharisees were not enough to stop him Judas was not enough to stop him because he had you on his mind hallelujah hallelujah he had to accomplish that purpose there were so many scriptures in the Old Testament that had to be fulfilled so nothing could happen to him until he fulfilled all those scriptures nothing can happen to you until you fulfill all the scriptures that talk about you Hallelujah hallelu when the scripture says you are a mighty conqueror you are not going to die until you become a conqueror you are not going to die until you possess the gates of all the en because that's your purpose nothing can take you out until you fulfill God's purpose Hallelujah when he was on that cross he cried it is finished I have done it I have accomplished that purpose and he gave up The Ghost and he died oh and they took his body down and they didn't even have a grave for him then they did not even believe he was going to resurrect they started crying we thought he was going to deliver us and they said our hope is gone but he was right there his purpose on the Earth was done but he still had another purpose to go to hell hallelujah hallelujah when he said it is finished he says it is finished here on Earth and they took his body down they didn't have any place to put him and under inspiration they didn't know what they were doing but they borrowed a grave have you ever heard of a grave being borrowed well if you take my grave then when I die where am I going to go they borrowed the grave of Joseph of ARA and he gave it to them they didn't know what they were doing it was a prophet prophetic gesture the borrowing means you have to return it so they borrowed the tomb of Joseph of Aria because they were going to return it to him hallelujah hallelujah so Jesus was laid in a border of grave tried to seal him in and they put a rock on the opening of the grave and they put a Roman soldier there yeah his disciples are going to try and steal his body and say he resurrected but did he know his mission on Earth was done but there was another mission he was supposed to go accomplish so whilst his body was laying in the grave he had another place to stop and he walked down to Hell hallelujah hallelujah and he came knocking on the door he came knocking on and they said who is it they said it's it's Jesus and all hell started trembling if you can put up the atonement paragraph 87 he knocked into hell and he went in there and he started looking for Satan Satan where are you because remember he had to accomplish his mission the prophet of God say I can hear him say Satan come here and he is boss now he reaches over grabs that key of death hel of the side and he took it away from Satan and he put it on his side and he said to Satan I want to serve notice on you you've been a Blu long enough I'm the Virgin born son of the Living God right now my blood is still wet on the cross the full debt is paid you have no rights no more hallelujah hallelujah he paid your debt his blood was enough so no one can put a claim on you because his blood was enough to set you free his blood was enough to pay for all the crimes you committed going to commit and the food is paid you have no rights no more you are stripped he says give me those keys that's right he turns around and he gives the devil a good healthy kick slams the door he slams the door all together stay in there I'm the boss from now on Hallelujah he accomplished his purpose on Earth and he he accomplished his purpose in hell and he took those keys so Satan no longer have power over death Satan no longer have power over hell so all the people that had been under Satan God took those keys Jesus took those kills and he overcame him so Satan cannot kill you until your purpose on the earth is done because he does not have those rights he does not have those keys Christ took them away from him and he rendered him powerless amen and when he accomplished his mission in hell it was stand for him to rise up again it was time for him to get out of that b of GRA no Roman soldier there was not an army enough that could keep him in the grave there was no rock that was strong enough that could keep him in the grave he had overcome death and the grave he overcome every sin overcome every trial every Temptation every man could go and early Sunday morning earthquake today is a Sunday morning hallelu there is an earthquake in Hell the prophet of God says if the weakest of Sinners on needs to pray there is a shaking in Hell Hallelujah say I'm not strong but so long you are a Christian you have enough power to shake hell Hallelujah early Sunday morning there was an earthquake the Earth couldn't hold him anymore oh and that stone rolled away and he came out Victorious the Virgin born son of God he had overcome death hell and the overcome each and everything and he became Victorious he got the victory so you can get the victory he accomplished his purpose so you can accomplish your purpose hallelujah hallelujah if he overcome death hell and the grave you can overcome it too There Is No Death that can hold you down there is no no sickness that's powerful enough to hold you down if you Rose up you can also rise up I don't care what situation you are in I got a word for you this morning you can rise up cuz you are walking in your purpose when you are in your purpose nothing can stop you hallelujah hallelujah because God does not look at you he looks at the lamb in the book uh in the message job paragraph 24 the prophet of God says that's the way it is today we guilty unworthy and should die we are not worthy of leaving we are not worthy to come to Christ we are not worthy to ask for anything but God never looks at your unworthiness Hallelujah he doesn't look at your fault it says he looked at the lamb now if he can find no fault in Christ then you are free he died in your stead amen amen now if there is any fault with him you are not free yet back in the Old Testament when someone committed a crime or if they sinned they would try to find a blameless lamb to offer to go offer it as a sacrifice so that it cover their sins listen the blood of the Lamb did not erase the sins just covered them and they would it would ease their conscience but right after leaving the temple if he goes and sin to find another one to come back because the blood of that lamb didn't do you no good because the life of man is here and the life of an animal is here so a lower life can help you amen amen that's why God had to give his perfect sacrifice CHR on a purpose to come and redeem you it says he examines the lamb you say I'm not worthy to walk out of this wheelchair that's right you are not but God doesn't examine you he examine Christ and if he is worthy then you can walk so when the priest was examining the lamb the L was dying in the stad of the person who who brought the lamb when the priest would look at the blameless lamb lamb is the Lamb is blameless you become blameless because the lamb died in your stead hallelujah hallelujah the prophet of God is saying God looked at the lamb not you so he was looking at Christ not you so when God when Jesus died on Calvary he was the blameless lamb remember pilate said I find no fault in him was not just his saying he was fulfilling scripture because the Lamb of God had to be examined the reason why he had to be blameless so that you could be blameless amen he says it depends on what you think about it you say brother brandham I'm an awful woman I've lived illegally I've even broken my marriage vow I've done this and Mr Bram I tell you I've been a drunker I've done this he says no matter what you done God never looks at you he looks at the lamb amen he looks at that Bloody lamb and he has already accepted the lamb so if he has accepted the lamb he has accepted you so you are free God cannot see you he sees the lamb the lamb he sees the lamb that dies in your St hallelujah hallelujah that's enough to make a fellow shout so whatever you have done God does not look at you he looks at his bloody lamb jist who died on Calvary and when he sees that he blameless he doesn't even have to look at you he because the lamb is blameless you are blameless you haven't done it in the first place Hallelujah hallu so you've been set free to walk into your purpose that you were born for and your purpose will protect you hallelujah hallelujah and remember all things work together for good for them that love the Lord you might say I don't understand it but the word says it's working for your good say I don't understand why I'm going through this but it's working for your good say I don't understand why I'm going through this breakup but that breakup is working for your good might not understand and say why am I being rejected it's working in your good it's not a rejection but it's God's redirection what you thought was a breakdown is God break making you have a breakthrough because if you are working in per if you're walking in your purpose everything is working out for your good stand amen amen how many believe that this morning you have been born with a purpose you were just not born to leave and die each God predestinated you so you could reflect him so you can be a reflection of Christ that's your purpose he wanted to brighten this last day that's your purpose amen amen whatever you did doesn't account if you confessed it he doesn't look at it remember you have to confess it first he doesn't look at you he doesn't look at what you did he looks at the lamb look at Abraham Abraham was a liar but in the book of Hebrews when his name was written in the Hall of Fame he says it was he was faultless he was blameless look at David David he committed a sin and committed another sin to cover that sin but because he was a man after God's Own Heart when his name was written in the book it says he never done it in the first place Sarah doubted God but her doubt was not accounted for it says she was judged Faithfully she never doubted God but Although our minds know that she laughed does not look at that he looks at the purpose because your purpose will protect you and it will carry you through amen amen let us sing this song in the cross worship just [Music] before my [Music] glory till my CH s
