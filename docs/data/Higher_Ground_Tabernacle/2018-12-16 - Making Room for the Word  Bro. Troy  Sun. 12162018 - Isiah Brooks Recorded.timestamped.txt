[29:21] 21 days and all of a sudden the angel
[29:28] Gabriel was sent to him and when the

[29:56] how many believes he's already done amen
[29:58] amen let's just open our Bibles to the
[30:02] book of 2nd Kings chapter 4
[30:11] speak a message this morning called
[30:13] making room for the word second second
[30:27] Kings chapter 4 we'll start with the
[30:31] eighth verse and read on down to the
[30:33] seventeenth verse it says and it fell on
[30:46] a day that Elijah passed to Shuna where
[30:51] was a great woman and she constrained
[30:55] him to eat bread and so it was that oft
[30:59] as he passed by that he turned into
[31:02] there to eat bread and she said unto her
[31:06] hut unto her husband behold now I
[31:10] perceive that this is a holy man of God
[31:13] which passeth by us continually let us
[31:18] make a little chamber I pray thee on the
[31:21] wall I let us set up for him there a bed
[31:24] a table and a stool and a candlestick
[31:28] and it shall be that when he cometh to
[31:31] us he shall turn in thither my things
[31:36] are getting ready and it fell on a day
[31:40] that he came thither and he turned into
[31:43] the chamber and he lay there hey man
[31:46] remember the word comes to the prophets
[31:48] Haven and now the prophet with the word
[31:50] is now laying in their own house in
[31:54] their chamber that they prepared for him
[31:56] and he said take a haze' his servant
[31:59] call this Shunammite there was he was
[32:03] laying there something came on his mind
[32:06] while he was laying there and he said to
[32:10] Gaza his servant call this Shunammite
[32:14] and when he had called her she stood
[32:17] before him and he said unto him say now
[32:21] unto her behold thou hast been careful
[32:24] for us with all this care what is to be
[32:27] done for thee wouldest thou be spoken
[32:31] for to the king or to the captain of the
[32:34] host and she answered I dwell among my
[32:37] own own people and he said what then is
[32:41] to be done for her and gaze as answered
[32:44] verily she hath no child and her husband
[32:48] is old and he said call her and when he
[32:51] had called her she stood in the door and
[32:54] he said about this season according to
[32:57] the time of life thou shalt embrace a
[33:00] son a man let's just stop right there
[33:03] hey man Alyssa's bow our heads and word
[33:05] of Prayer Heavenly Father we just want
[33:07] to thank you Lord for your word Lord
[33:09] it's it's great and rich father Lord we
[33:12] just thank you for every every scripture
[33:14] father and Lord and this morning as we
[33:16] have gathered together one body in your
[33:19] name Lord
[33:19] where you said you'd be in the midst of
[33:21] us Lord and we just invite you into this
[33:24] place Laura this morning we open up our
[33:27] hearts father we don't hold anything
[33:29] back father Lord we just open up our
[33:31] hearts unto you Lord asking you to to
[33:34] move in this morning lawyers we make
[33:36] room for you Father
[33:38] Lord you take the highest place and have
[33:41] the preeminence this day we just thank
[33:44] you Lord for being such a blessing to us
[33:46] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we
[33:48] pray amen amen you can be seated anyway
[33:54] I'm making room for the word this woman
[33:58] the Bible says she was a great woman
[34:01] amen they had fields they had a nice
[34:04] farm they had some type of wealth you
[34:07] know but one thing about it though is
[34:10] that when the word started passing by
[34:14] that she continually saw this man she
[34:18] knew there's a holy man so she offered
[34:20] up bread and he came in he would speak
[34:23] about what he was going the work of the
[34:24] Lord that he was on the hero they was
[34:28] the prophet and then the Prophet never
[34:30] really knows exactly what he's going to
[34:32] be doing from day to day but just as the
[34:34] spirit moves him he goes and does
[34:37] the spirit calls him to do so as the
[34:40] spirit will be calling the Prophet to go
[34:42] from here to there you have passed by
[34:45] this place continually amen so as as
[34:49] this woman kept seeing the Word of God
[34:52] on its way about his father's business
[34:54] as she said how can I be a blessing to
[34:58] the Word of God amen how can I be a
[35:01] blessing to the vessel that is holding
[35:04] the Word of God for our day amen how can
[35:07] I be a blessing to to make it just a
[35:10] little bit of assistance what can I do
[35:12] to make sure that the Word of God for
[35:15] this day has everything that it has need
[35:17] of to go wherever it needs to go amen so
[35:20] so she thought about what she could do
[35:23] what could possibly be done what would
[35:25] be the best thing to do is she thought
[35:27] you know if he's weary upon the journey
[35:29] if he's hungry you know we'll feed him I
[35:31] said you know let's just make a little
[35:33] place in our house a little room in our
[35:36] house so that when the word of god is
[35:39] passing by that he won't just stop and
[35:41] eat and go on but that the word of god
[35:44] might stop and stay for a while
[35:49] that's blessing amen
[35:52] not just the word of god but the
[35:54] anointed prophet of the Lord amen
[35:57] because when the word and the anointing
[35:59] get together and now we got the word the
[36:02] word is sitting on on bookshelves all
[36:04] over this country gathering dust
[36:07] amen amen and it's not doing anything
[36:09] for those people on Newt on who those
[36:11] bookshelves is sitting why is that they
[36:16] made room for the physical book but they
[36:20] haven't made room for the manifestation
[36:22] by the Holy Spirit of living gut amen
[36:27] that's why the most powerful book is
[36:31] ever written that has been flooded this
[36:33] entire country and is sitting on
[36:35] bookshelves all over this country that's
[36:37] why it's not having its effect amen
[36:40] because they made room for the physical
[36:42] book but they didn't make room for the
[36:46] spirit that could make this book come
[36:47] alive
[36:49] amen that could pull up the events out
[36:51] of history Amen suits so that you
[36:54] yourself can become living in Bible days
[36:56] again amen that's that's one thing I
[36:59] really drew me to this message is when
[37:01] I've you know looking for those Bible
[37:04] days and you know I heard that it was
[37:06] you know they said in the newspapers
[37:09] back in the 50s you know we're living
[37:11] Bible days have returned to the earth
[37:14] Bible days are here again amen you know
[37:17] when they saw the ministry of brother
[37:19] Branham on old ax and all the the
[37:20] miracles and the phenomena and the dead
[37:23] were raised the the sick were healed and
[37:26] all those things going on and and as and
[37:28] as that phenomena I was seen inspire the
[37:33] people to say we are seeing the things
[37:35] that were written in this book now
[37:37] coming to pass in our own day and it got
[37:41] the people excited yeah you got me
[37:42] excited amen
[37:44] why because I enjoy see not just this
[37:47] physical book but I like to see this
[37:48] book in action amen that's what I'm here
[37:52] for I really like to see my god on
[37:54] display I like to see him when he comes
[37:56] in in power hey I like to see it when he
[37:59] comes in and changes a situation I like
[38:01] to see a win when God can reach out his
[38:03] hand and take someone who's sick and
[38:05] heal him amen you know I don't know you
[38:09] know one of the most blessed thing you
[38:10] know when when I come into a church or
[38:13] someone comes up to me and says you know
[38:15] brother you you prayed for me last week
[38:17] and you know what in over a week I was
[38:19] healed or whatever eye problem I brought
[38:22] up it was delivering out what did that
[38:24] it was not me
[38:25] it's not that I had any power Amen it's
[38:28] not that it's just that God has has
[38:31] placed in the body of Christ the ability
[38:35] to bring requests up unto the Lord Amen
[38:37] when that request goes up unto the Lord
[38:39] God makes intercession for us based upon
[38:42] our confession amen and he reaches down
[38:44] and changes the situation here on the
[38:47] earth Amen to make whatever the
[38:50] situation is here on the earth match
[38:53] what it should be up in the heavens
[38:55] that's what our God does hey man I will
[38:58] I love I love to hear the testimonies a
[39:01] man that I just ever
[39:02] time we pray for someone here I just I
[39:06] expect that there's gonna be a testimony
[39:07] coming actually that's just the way I
[39:09] believe hey you should be the same way
[39:11] hey that's not for the minister s for
[39:13] the body of Christ amen
[39:16] to expect that when their prayer goes up
[39:18] to the altar where the blood of Christ
[39:20] is and when Christ makes intercession
[39:22] for you based upon your confession then
[39:25] you know something is going to come to
[39:27] pass hey man so this woman she made room
[39:31] for the Word of God and I think about it
[39:37] as they as they took the house and they
[39:40] added on that little place you know they
[39:42] put the hole in the wall or however they
[39:44] did it and they made that little room on
[39:46] the side and and they made a bed and
[39:49] they put the bed in there and they made
[39:51] a little stool and then they made a
[39:53] little table a man they put them in
[39:55] there and then they placed on the table
[39:57] a lampstand so he could have light so he
[40:00] could be comfortable amen
[40:02] they made a place where the Word of God
[40:04] the Prophet could be comfortable and so
[40:09] as as is that now look now look about it
[40:12] one of the first times that room was
[40:15] used the the Prophet came by the house
[40:19] and he goes into the house and now the
[40:21] house has changed there's now an
[40:23] additional room there and they say and
[40:25] she goes and she shows him this room he
[40:27] says this room is dedicated to you into
[40:30] your ministry I have made room in my
[40:35] house for you and for your ministry he
[40:38] walks into that room and and he lays
[40:41] down and she goes about her business
[40:43] about her day and as he's laying there
[40:45] he's sinking my lord I pray you would
[40:49] bless this woman Amen Lord I pray you'd
[40:52] bless this family for the things that
[40:54] they have done for making me comfortable
[40:56] Laurel I pray you bless this family Lord
[40:59] I don't know what she has Nita but Laura
[41:00] I just pray you and bless her a man and
[41:03] he's sitting there communion he's laying
[41:04] and the Bible says he was laying on the
[41:06] bed there that all sudden he he calls
[41:09] for her come here what's he doing the
[41:14] Lord has shown him
[41:16] she has a need so now the word once it's
[41:21] invited into the house and now our room
[41:26] has been made for the word in this house
[41:28] and as the word is staying there and
[41:32] remaining there remember it's not just
[41:34] that the word comes by and then leaves
[41:36] but now the word has come by in an
[41:38] estate the prophet has stayed he didn't
[41:42] just pass some grab some bread and left
[41:44] but the word came in and he stayed amen
[41:49] so as the word stayed there all of a
[41:53] sudden a thought came to the prophets
[41:56] mind this woman has a neat this woman
[42:02] has a neat he went and he talked to her
[42:06] until he found out what that need was
[42:07] and immediately God gave him permission
[42:10] to announce that that need will be taken
[42:12] care of she I need to have a baby and
[42:15] God gave her her need you know she would
[42:20] have lived without the baby you know she
[42:24] could have gotten by without having a
[42:26] child you know they had plenty they were
[42:30] comfortable they were living a
[42:32] comfortable life but there was this a
[42:34] desire inside of her heart that was
[42:37] according to the Word of God and she had
[42:40] been desire upon her heart and when the
[42:42] word came and stayed in her house that
[42:44] the Word of God through the Prophet
[42:47] answered back according to the desire of
[42:50] her heart my what a blessing they made
[42:56] room for the word made room for the word
[42:59] amen let's turn over to John chapter one
[43:33] the Baptist's here we'll start with John
[43:36] chapter 1 the 29th verse it says the
[43:41] next day John seeth Jesus coming unto
[43:44] him and saith behold the lamb of God
[43:48] which taketh away the sin of the world I
[43:51] wouldn't love him standing there
[43:52] wouldn't you this is he of whom I said
[43:57] after me is cometh a man which is
[43:59] preferred before me for he was before me
[44:02] and I knew him not but that he should be
[44:06] made manifest to Israel therefore I am
[44:09] come baptizing with water and John bear
[44:12] record saying I saw the Spirit descend
[44:15] from heaven like a dove and it abode
[44:18] upon him so John the Prophet is
[44:22] testifying I saw the Spirit of God now
[44:25] this is the same spirit that created the
[44:27] heavens and the earth the same spirit
[44:28] that brooded in the back in the
[44:30] beginning I saw that spirit that spirit
[44:32] descending down from heaven like a dove
[44:34] and it abode upon this man it stayed
[44:38] there amen
[44:40] the spirit came down upon this man and
[44:44] it stayed there and I'm here to bear
[44:47] witness of him
[44:48] amen then he goes on to the next verse
[44:50] and and I knew him not but he that sent
[44:54] me he said when I saw this man I didn't
[44:58] know but I saw the spirit descending
[45:03] upon' now I get to verse 33 I knew him
[45:05] not but he the one that sent me to
[45:07] baptize with water that same one said
[45:10] unto me upon whom you shall see the
[45:13] spirit descending and remaining on him
[45:17] the same is he that baptizes with the
[45:20] Holy Ghost and I saw and I bear record
[45:23] that this is the son of God amen so so
[45:27] so so John said that the man of the very
[45:31] voice the very one that sent me to go
[45:33] baptize with water
[45:34] they sent me to go prepare the way for
[45:36] the Messiah that same one told me now
[45:39] one of these days you're gonna see the
[45:41] Spirit of God descending upon a man amen
[45:44] and when he descends he's gonna as a
[45:47] remain
[45:47] there amen and when you see that that
[45:50] man will be the one that baptizes with
[45:52] the Holy Ghost so John was going along
[45:59] and he sees us Mary says I didn't know
[46:00] him but all of a sudden I saw the Holy
[46:02] Ghost descending like a dove from the
[46:05] earth and I watched it and I said well
[46:07] that's just what that man that's just
[46:08] what the voice told me amen and when he
[46:11] went and he landed upon the head of
[46:13] Jesus and the Holy Spirit went hid there
[46:18] it stayed and remained still there amen
[46:24] it's still there that same spirit that
[46:28] created the heavens and the earth the
[46:30] same sphere that all power is in the
[46:34] hands of that spirit amen amen he can
[46:36] create he created this world out of
[46:37] nothing
[46:38] amen he can do anything he wants to amen
[46:42] he brewed it over the darkness amen back
[46:45] in the beginning and said this world
[46:47] ought not to be in this condition and so
[46:50] the Holy Spirit got to be brooding and
[46:52] said it shouldn't be in this condition
[46:53] so the spirit started planting seeds it
[46:56] started bringing up the earth it started
[46:58] making the place of the world a nice
[47:00] decent place to live so that we could
[47:03] enjoy it
[47:04] who did that spirit did that and now
[47:07] this same spirit is being seen coming
[47:10] down you know you know Israel needed
[47:14] that spirit amen they were a little they
[47:17] were really lacking it a man had been
[47:20] hundreds of years since they had a
[47:22] prophet
[47:22] amen they were living in bondage
[47:24] underneath the Roman system amen they
[47:27] their there their whole worship system
[47:29] was a dry terrible mess
[47:32] amen they they were they were doing all
[47:34] the sacrifices but they couldn't seem to
[47:36] obey the word their zeal was gone and
[47:39] all they were doing was just living
[47:41] according to the dry word and they
[47:45] couldn't see this word be made manifest
[47:48] in their lives so it was just a dry
[47:50] gospel to them amen and they had turned
[47:53] their religion into just a
[47:56] denominational mess so here comes
[48:02] what was it now religion had become in
[48:06] the same condition that the world was
[48:08] back in the beginning they meant the
[48:12] world in the beginning was dark and his
[48:14] void is formless it wasn't doing
[48:16] anything wasn't producing anything
[48:17] wasn't making thing'll it wasn't making
[48:19] anything alive it was dark it was void
[48:21] now religion the religion of Judaism had
[48:25] done the same thing
[48:26] Amen the religion of the Jews had become
[48:30] dark it was without for without void it
[48:33] wasn't doing anything it wasn't making
[48:34] anything live it wasn't making anything
[48:36] alive it was a dead religion so now with
[48:39] the same spirit that back gave life back
[48:42] in the beginning is now coming back now
[48:45] here to Jerusalem a man and that spirit
[48:47] had a messenger sent before him and that
[48:49] messenger said upon whom you see the
[48:52] Holy Spirit descending like a dove and
[48:54] remaining there that's the same one that
[48:57] is now going to go and select people to
[49:01] be depositories of this holy spirit that
[49:04] created the heavens and the earth this
[49:09] is the one that will baptize with the
[49:11] Holy Ghost so now we're in a good
[49:16] position we've identified the one that's
[49:18] going to baptize with the Holy Ghost and
[49:20] the world wasn't a need to be baptized
[49:24] with the Holy Ghost because let me tell
[49:25] you every time the Holy Ghost comes it
[49:28] brings life that's why the Holy Spirit
[49:33] comes he is the Tree of Life from the
[49:36] beginning and he has life to give I come
[49:41] that you might have life and have it
[49:43] more abundantly
[49:48] why why he said because the whole the
[49:51] life giver was on the inside of him he
[49:53] was the life giver
[49:54] amen I am come that you might have life
[49:58] and have it more abundantly
[50:00] amen amen so when John saw that Holy
[50:06] Spirit coming down he identified her
[50:08] right away
[50:08] this
[50:09] is the same this is he that baptized us
[50:13] with the Holy Ghost and I saw him bear
[50:15] record that this is the Son of God amen
[50:22] how did we get to this point let's go
[50:26] back let's go back over to Luke chapter
[50:28] one
[50:48] as we know this was a this is a blessed
[50:50] event they meant weird the word have was
[50:55] identified the Holy Ghost had been
[50:58] identified and it was here it was on the
[51:00] earth and it was ready to baptize with
[51:04] the Holy Ghost though the word had
[51:07] returned to the earth again how did we
[51:10] get to this point Luke chapter 1 verse
[51:16] 26 and the sixth month the angel Gabriel
[51:23] was sent from God unto a city of Galilee
[51:25] named Nazareth to a virgin espoused to a
[51:29] man whose name was Joseph of the house
[51:32] of David and the Virgin's name was Mary
[51:34] an angel came in unto her and said hail
[51:38] thou art highly favoured and the Lord is
[51:42] with thee blessed art thou among women
[51:44] and when she saw him she was trouble at
[51:47] his saying and casts in her mind what
[51:50] manner of salutation this should be and
[51:52] the angel said unto her fear not Mary
[51:55] for thou hast found favor with God
[51:57] and behold thou shalt conceive in thy
[52:00] womb and bring forth a son and shall
[52:02] call his name Jesus he shall be great
[52:05] and he shall be called the son of the
[52:07] highest and the Lord God shall give unto
[52:10] him the throne of his father David and
[52:12] he shall reign over the house of Jacob
[52:15] forever and of his kingdom there shall
[52:17] be no end amen amen and then we get down
[52:27] to verse 38 it says and Mary said Behold
[52:31] the handmaid of the Lord be it unto me
[52:34] according to thy word and the angel
[52:39] departed from her why the angel depart
[52:42] from her Amen this is when the angel
[52:45] decided to leave why the angel decide to
[52:46] leave at that point because as soon as
[52:48] she said Lord I believe Lord be it unto
[52:52] meet Lord that's nothing but the truth
[52:53] Lord be done to me according to thy word
[52:57] they eat is like that's it
[53:00] amen the work is done
[53:02] amen the Holy Spirit has selected the
[53:05] woman amen I've brought the message to
[53:07] the woman the messenger Gabriel came to
[53:09] the woman amen and when she heard the
[53:11] message the message went into her ears
[53:16] it came across the field of her mind and
[53:23] she had what a virgin not just a virgin
[53:26] womb well she had a virgin mind amen now
[53:32] this is important
[53:34] amen now look what had Mary done Mary
[53:38] had made room for the word she may not
[53:42] have realized that she did it but she
[53:44] had done it she had made room for the
[53:46] word she made room for what she had
[53:49] reserved her womb was reserved for the
[53:51] pattern of the word a meant her her mind
[53:55] was reserved to trust only in what the
[53:59] word set
[54:00] she knew the scriptures amen her heart
[54:03] had been prepared amen she she had kept
[54:06] her heart from the world of the things
[54:09] of the world amen and she was prepared
[54:12] she had kept herself through and through
[54:15] and that's why she was highly favored
[54:19] among women amen and so when the word
[54:22] came to her and the word was preached to
[54:25] her and the word came into the field of
[54:28] her mind she said yes that is the truth
[54:32] let it be unto me according to the Word
[54:35] of God just according to the word and
[54:37] that word as soon as she said that the
[54:40] word dropped down from her mind down
[54:44] into her heart I wanted to do it gave
[54:50] room for the Holy Spirit to place his
[54:56] word down in her womb and Jesus Christ
[55:00] began growing inside her womb why
[55:04] because she received the word she
[55:06] believed the word and she said yes and
[55:08] amen to the word that's the angel left
[55:11] because he knew the word had been
[55:14] preached and placed where
[55:16] to be amen amen and behold thou shalt
[55:26] conceive in thy womb and bring forth a
[55:28] son and shall call his name Jesus he
[55:31] shall be great he should be called the
[55:33] son of the highest
[55:34] Laure God shall give unto him the throne
[55:36] of his father David he shall reign over
[55:38] the house of Jacob forever and of his
[55:41] kingdom there shall be no end that means
[55:45] he's still reigning somewhere
[55:48] amen this king is still around somewhere
[55:50] he still he's he is still on the throne
[55:53] he is still raining as king he still has
[55:56] power to make things happen according to
[56:00] his kingdoms sake that's why John the
[56:02] Baptist and Jesus both went preaching
[56:04] the kingdom of heaven the kingdom of
[56:06] heaven is coming unto you the kingdom of
[56:08] heaven is coming into you and that
[56:09] kingdom is still here now as we look
[56:12] around it at the newspapers we don't
[56:14] necessarily see the kingdom where he was
[56:16] we look around to the to the
[56:19] civilization that we have here we don't
[56:21] necessarily see the kingdom Amen when we
[56:24] look to the denominational churches and
[56:26] and the religion that we have today we
[56:30] don't necessarily see the kingdom but
[56:32] let me tell you the kingdom has a place
[56:35] that has been prepared for it to be it's
[56:37] of the ink the Bible says of the
[56:40] increase of his kingdom there shall be
[56:41] no it Amen that means that kingdoms
[56:45] going to increase and it's been
[56:46] increasing since the day that Jesus
[56:48] Christ was here of the increase of his
[56:50] kingdom there shall be no and that means
[56:52] it's still increasing amen
[56:54] where is it increasing everywhere where
[56:58] room is given to it amen
[57:03] everywhere where room is given to the
[57:06] word that kingdom comes makes itself
[57:11] home makes itself manifest and there it
[57:16] increases amen
[57:23] remember they when they built the the
[57:26] temple back in the beginning that they
[57:28] there was never a sound of a hammer
[57:29] heard there there was no sound of a tool
[57:34] heard on the site because they did all
[57:36] that work off-site and then they brought
[57:39] the piece in prepared and fit it
[57:43] together fit it together
[57:45] fit it together you know one of these
[57:47] days in a moment and twinkling of an eye
[57:50] we're gonna be changed amen
[57:55] and we're gonna go up and we're going to
[57:57] find out that the kingdom was increasing
[58:00] the whole time the kingdom was being
[58:03] built the whole time amen
[58:05] everywhere the where room was made for
[58:08] the kingdom to grow it grew amen and
[58:11] that's how the judgment is gonna be Amen
[58:14] why because people will be judged by
[58:15] whether they allowed room for the
[58:17] kingdom to grow or whether they refused
[58:20] the word of the Messiah
[58:22] amen Bruce what did the word do when it
[58:25] came John says this is he does baptizing
[58:28] with the Holy Ghost
[58:30] so Holy Ghost came and anointed the King
[58:35] Jesus Christ
[58:37] now that King is looking for subjects
[58:39] and what does he do he's baptizing them
[58:42] in the Holy Ghost and what happens when
[58:44] they're baptized with the Holy Ghost
[58:46] they began growing up into the kingdom
[58:48] they're being told they're being shaped
[58:50] they're being formed into that which
[58:52] will be brought up in one moment in the
[58:55] twinkling of an eye and set in this
[58:57] place same n and then what happens that
[59:00] same City John said I saw the city
[59:03] adorned as a bride descending from God
[59:05] out of heaven Amen shaped like a pyramid
[59:08] descending from God what happened the
[59:10] bride was prepared here on the earth as
[59:14] where all the noise takes place as where
[59:16] all the trouble takes place those were
[59:17] all the trials and a fairy furnace takes
[59:20] place amen but what are we doing were
[59:21] being prepared jesus said I go to
[59:24] prepare a place for you maybe we just
[59:29] didn't realize that he's preparing us a
[59:32] minute he's going to prepare a place he
[59:35] has a spot
[59:36] serve for us and we have to fit into
[59:38] that spot that means we have to be a
[59:40] certain shape a certain condition amen
[59:43] and that's why the Holy Spirit moves
[59:44] upon your life that's why the Holy
[59:47] Spirit convicts you when you do wrong
[59:49] that's why the Holy Spirit leads you to
[59:52] do this and to do that to get experience
[59:54] amen
[59:54] why because the Holy Spirit wants you to
[59:56] be in a certain shape a certain
[59:59] condition to have certain fruits on
[1:00:01] display amen certain fruits on display
[1:00:05] in your life so that when the rapture
[1:00:06] comes that you fit into the condition
[1:00:09] that you were God for ordained for you
[1:00:13] to fit in well when you resist the Holy
[1:00:15] Ghost you're rejecting the very one that
[1:00:22] is trying to shape you to prepare a
[1:00:24] place for you you're not making room for
[1:00:27] the Word of God amen
[1:00:33] let's turn over to mark chapter 11
[1:00:53] they're that angel told Mary that he
[1:00:56] will rule as a king over the house of
[1:00:58] Jacob the increase of his kingdom there
[1:01:02] will be no end amen
[1:01:03] as his kingdom will continually grow a
[1:01:06] man so mark chapter 11 you read the
[1:01:09] first verse it says and when they meet
[1:01:12] they came nigh unto Jerusalem and when
[1:01:16] they came 9 to Jerusalem unto Beth Beth
[1:01:19] phage and Bethany at the Mount of Olives
[1:01:22] he sent forth two of his disciples we're
[1:01:25] gonna go forward to verse five here a
[1:01:29] second but what is going on right here
[1:01:31] is Jesus is coming back to Jerusalem
[1:01:36] amen
[1:01:37] the word is coming back to Jerusalem he
[1:01:40] made a full tour through all of Judea
[1:01:43] they meant through the house of Jacob he
[1:01:45] went to the Samaritans he went oh and he
[1:01:47] just was coming back now from Jericho
[1:01:49] and what did he do he was expressing
[1:01:50] that the kingdom of heaven is coming
[1:01:52] back to you
[1:01:53] amen preaching the kingdom of God
[1:01:56] preaching the kingdom of heaven a man
[1:01:58] now the the Jesus Christ the King is
[1:02:01] coming back to Jerusalem and as he
[1:02:05] enters what what to see if there's room
[1:02:07] for him there amen now let's go to verse
[1:02:11] 5
[1:02:18] disciples into the city at verses 2
[1:02:21] through 4 there told him to go and get a
[1:02:24] colt a donkey find him and bring him to
[1:02:28] the city so that Jesus can write in on
[1:02:31] the city on the donkey verse 5 says and
[1:02:34] certain of them stood there said to them
[1:02:36] what do you seen this Colt
[1:02:39] this donkey and they said to him even as
[1:02:43] Jesus had commanded and they let them go
[1:02:45] and they brought the Colt to Jesus and
[1:02:48] they cast their garments on him and he
[1:02:51] set on him and many spread their
[1:02:54] garments in the way and others cut down
[1:02:56] branches off the trees and strewed them
[1:02:58] in the way and they went before and they
[1:03:01] and they that followed cried saying
[1:03:03] Hosanna blessed is he that cometh in the
[1:03:06] name of the Lord blessed is the kingdom
[1:03:09] of our Father David and that cometh in
[1:03:11] the name of the Lord hosanna in the
[1:03:13] highest
[1:03:14] and Jesus entered into Jerusalem and
[1:03:17] into the temple and watch this and when
[1:03:20] he looked around upon all things and
[1:03:23] when he had looked around about upon all
[1:03:26] things and now the Eventide was come the
[1:03:29] who he went out unto Bethany with the
[1:03:32] twelve what just happened here Jesus
[1:03:36] came he entered into the city he was
[1:03:38] worshipped he entered and he looks
[1:03:40] around in turns into the temple he goes
[1:03:43] down to the city he looks around he
[1:03:45] looks upon all things and then when the
[1:03:49] evening comes he leaves the city and
[1:03:51] goes back to Bethany the word came but
[1:03:54] the word did not remain amen and while
[1:03:58] the word was there what'd he do he
[1:04:00] looked on all things that's what Jesus
[1:04:04] does amen the word came he entered into
[1:04:07] the very heart of Jerusalem into the
[1:04:10] very temple itself and he looked upon
[1:04:12] all things but then when the evening
[1:04:14] came he turned around and went back out
[1:04:16] to Bethany no matter how much they
[1:04:19] worship how much they praise him no
[1:04:21] matter all that it's still the word left
[1:04:23] amen
[1:04:25] remember you know it's not too far from
[1:04:28] here that that uh just not to me verses
[1:04:30] away to where where
[1:04:31] this is the disciples a few chapters
[1:04:34] down they say oh look at all these
[1:04:35] buildings look at all this he had
[1:04:38] already gone in beforehand and examined
[1:04:41] all things and he looked at them as they
[1:04:45] are praising the buildings he says I
[1:04:47] tell you the truth not one stone of
[1:04:50] these buildings or remain upon another
[1:04:54] what happened he looked he entered into
[1:04:57] the heart of Jerusalem there was no room
[1:05:00] for him there he left was a judgement
[1:05:03] was pronounced upon that City they
[1:05:05] rejected the word amen no matter how
[1:05:11] much they praise the word the word was
[1:05:13] still rejected he looked upon all things
[1:05:17] you know Jesus does the same thing when
[1:05:18] he enters into your heart amen he came
[1:05:23] to baptize us with the Holy Ghost he
[1:05:27] came to us to initiate us into his
[1:05:31] kingdom to cause us to be sons and
[1:05:34] daughters of God amen he enters into the
[1:05:37] very heart of us and he looks around in
[1:05:39] all things have you prepared room for
[1:05:45] the word amen does the word have room in
[1:05:49] your life to thrive to live to move and
[1:05:52] have its bean amen or does it just come
[1:05:54] and look around and find out there is no
[1:05:57] room here for me to stay remember God
[1:06:00] doesn't share a mint he might come he'll
[1:06:04] look around but then he'll just if he's
[1:06:05] not welcome it'll just pass on by amen
[1:06:09] and then jesus said this there will not
[1:06:11] be one stone remaining upon another why
[1:06:13] because they would not receive the word
[1:06:16] amen the same thing happens to - to an
[1:06:19] individual when when the gospel comes to
[1:06:22] pass across your heart and you have an
[1:06:24] opportunity to make room for the word in
[1:06:26] your heart and you see the word says
[1:06:29] repent be baptized in the name of Lord
[1:06:31] Jesus Christ and you shall be saved
[1:06:33] you say well I don't know if I want to
[1:06:35] do that I don't know if I don't want to
[1:06:36] repent because if I repent I would have
[1:06:39] to repent of this or of this I don't
[1:06:44] want to have to
[1:06:45] this or this up so therefore I'm not
[1:06:47] going to repent because I don't have to
[1:06:49] give this or this up they meant what are
[1:06:51] you doing then the word just passes
[1:06:52] right on by Amen when you when you say
[1:06:55] well I don't want the Holy Spirit to
[1:06:57] come upon me because I don't know what
[1:06:58] the Lord will lead me to do and you and
[1:07:00] you sir stand off from the Holy Spirit
[1:07:02] then the word just passes right on by
[1:07:05] why because you didn't make room for the
[1:07:07] Holy Spirit amen
[1:07:09] no matter how much you come to church no
[1:07:10] matter how much you take down the palm
[1:07:12] leaves and wave them around and say
[1:07:14] Hosanna Hosanna unto the highest Amen
[1:07:16] but Jesus looked at those turning out
[1:07:18] those Pharisees there watching all that
[1:07:20] and he said until you say blessed is he
[1:07:23] that cometh in the name of the Lord
[1:07:25] you'll never see me again Amen why
[1:07:31] because the word came but the word was
[1:07:33] not listened to amen amen I was I was
[1:07:42] Matthew 23 where he said you shall not
[1:07:45] he said verse 37 he said o Jerusalem
[1:07:49] Jerusalem thou that killest the prophets
[1:07:50] and stonest them which are sent unto you
[1:07:53] how often I would have gathered thy
[1:07:55] children together even as a hen
[1:07:57] gathereth her chickens under her wings
[1:07:59] and you would not behold your house is
[1:08:03] left unto you desolate for I say unto
[1:08:06] you ye shall not see me henceforth until
[1:08:09] you shall say blessed is he that cometh
[1:08:13] in the name of the Lord amen amen what
[1:08:18] happens when you say blessed is he that
[1:08:19] cometh in the name of the Lord you're
[1:08:21] receiving the word that has preached to
[1:08:23] you and making room for it in your heart
[1:08:26] to do all that is told unto you to do
[1:08:30] Amen that's what happens when you say
[1:08:33] blessed is he that cometh in the name of
[1:08:34] Lord you're gonna receive all the word
[1:08:36] that has preached unto you and say yes
[1:08:39] and amen to it amen let's turn over to
[1:08:46] John chapter 20 so
[1:08:51] Mary she received the word well soon as
[1:08:57] the word was pretty sure she received it
[1:08:59] she said yes name into it it dropped
[1:09:01] into her heart and continually groped
[1:09:04] from there and when the same thing
[1:09:05] happens to us well that's why what what
[1:09:08] we do we keep our heart pure or keep our
[1:09:10] heart clean keep our heart ready why
[1:09:12] because you don't know when Jesus is
[1:09:14] gonna come by I mean you got to be ready
[1:09:16] make room for the Holy Spirit to act in
[1:09:19] your life amen we got to do that every
[1:09:22] day yeah make room for the Holy Spirit
[1:09:24] every day to act in her life
[1:09:26] remember the whole river when we read
[1:09:28] their backing second kings that when
[1:09:30] they made the room for the Prophet that
[1:09:33] the Prophet came and this time it said
[1:09:36] of just leaving right away after eating
[1:09:38] he went into the room and he laid down
[1:09:41] and now on the inner chamber of their
[1:09:43] house the word was resting amen the same
[1:09:48] thing happens to us when we take time to
[1:09:51] read our Bibles we take time to pray we
[1:09:54] take time to met apply it meditate upon
[1:09:56] the word that the word doesn't just come
[1:09:58] by our place and leave and now the word
[1:10:00] is resting we can stare upon our minds
[1:10:03] and when that word when we're meditating
[1:10:04] and that word is on our minds and we say
[1:10:07] yes that's nothing but the truth and
[1:10:09] then the word drops down and becomes act
[1:10:14] amen remember the testimony brother
[1:10:17] Branham had of a sister Hattie right
[1:10:19] where she said that is nothing but the
[1:10:21] truth what happened the word came into
[1:10:25] her mind of a testimony of something
[1:10:28] that God had done amen and as soon as
[1:10:32] she heard she heard that word she could
[1:10:35] thought well that's kind of neat and
[1:10:36] just past somebody and that word would
[1:10:39] have went in her mind and then just left
[1:10:41] right after it amen but well she took
[1:10:43] and when the Prophet brother Branham
[1:10:46] took that and he said ty gave of the
[1:10:48] testimony ancient into her mind she says
[1:10:50] that is nothing but the truth that that
[1:10:53] word dropped down into her heart
[1:10:55] amen I wanted to do all sudden the
[1:10:58] Prophet brother Branham he's sitting
[1:11:00] there he's resting at her table and all
[1:11:02] of a sudden the angel comes and says
[1:11:04] give her whatever she desires as a
[1:11:09] second Kings being reacted upon the
[1:11:11] earth again so that which happened in
[1:11:16] the Old Testament it also has happened
[1:11:20] in the New Testament now has also
[1:11:22] happened in our day what kind of a day
[1:11:26] are we living in what kind of
[1:11:28] opportunities do we have on a day-by-day
[1:11:30] basis to listen to the word now let me
[1:11:36] tell you right now if I want to listen
[1:11:38] to the voice of Elijah I don't have a
[1:11:40] tape I could go play you know if I want
[1:11:43] to listen to the voice of of John the
[1:11:46] Baptist or of Elijah you know I don't
[1:11:49] have any of their sermons of course a
[1:11:51] few of them are written down here in the
[1:11:52] Bible a member I don't actually have any
[1:11:54] of their sermons recorded where I go and
[1:11:57] listen to their voice but here in this
[1:12:00] state we have a man upon who testified
[1:12:04] that the same spirit of Elijah that was
[1:12:06] on Elijah Elijah Elijah John the Baptist
[1:12:10] has now come and enter on to him and we
[1:12:15] have an opportunity to listen to that
[1:12:17] message to listen to that voice that's a
[1:12:20] blessed kind of means and what do you do
[1:12:23] what do you want you know some of the
[1:12:24] things you hear and there I never get
[1:12:26] tired of hearing those healing lines
[1:12:30] it's a reminder to me here in our day
[1:12:34] God has testified I am the same
[1:12:35] yesterday today and forever I have not
[1:12:39] changed I still remain the same of the
[1:12:42] increase of his kingdom there is no end
[1:12:44] he is still here
[1:12:46] a same Holy Ghost that John the Baptist
[1:12:48] said he this is he who has come to
[1:12:52] baptize with the Holy Ghost I saw the
[1:12:55] Spirit coming and landed upon him I
[1:12:57] remained upon him and now because I have
[1:13:00] seen that token I am here to testify
[1:13:02] that this is the Messiah the Holy Spirit
[1:13:05] is here and I wanted to do that Messiah
[1:13:07] came he went to Jerusalem Jerusalem
[1:13:09] wouldn't receive him so he left
[1:13:12] Jerusalem with his twelve went out to
[1:13:14] Bethany and not too long after that him
[1:13:17] and the
[1:13:18] those 12 and 120 women were in an upper
[1:13:20] room and the Holy Spirit came and
[1:13:24] descended upon them like tongues of fire
[1:13:27] and it remained and of the increase of
[1:13:30] that Kingdom it has not ended yet and
[1:13:33] it's continuing and continuing and
[1:13:35] continuing and we all have a grand
[1:13:37] opportunity to be that same city to make
[1:13:42] room for the word in our hearts to have
[1:13:44] the same Holy Ghost descend upon us so
[1:13:47] that as the Holy Spirit descended upon
[1:13:50] Christ and remained upon Christ now the
[1:13:52] Holy Spirit descends upon us and remains
[1:13:55] on us if you would just make room for
[1:13:58] him amen that's what happens and when
[1:14:01] the root and when the word is resting in
[1:14:04] your heart when the word is worshiped
[1:14:08] and the word is given the preeminence
[1:14:10] and the word is resting upon your heart
[1:14:12] and and and then what does it do it says
[1:14:14] ask whatever you will that's what he
[1:14:17] said in John in John 14 in John 15 in
[1:14:20] John 16 he said ask what you will ask
[1:14:23] what you will what do you want ask
[1:14:25] whatever you desire and it shall be done
[1:14:28] unto you I meant three times in three
[1:14:32] chapters he said whatever you ask ask
[1:14:34] seek knock it'll be given unto you and
[1:14:37] why why because when the word comes and
[1:14:39] abides in you amen
[1:14:42] you can have what you want
[1:14:51] I told you a turn at John 20 verse 19 it
[1:14:56] says then the same day evening is after
[1:15:02] the crucifixion after the resurrection
[1:15:04] being the first day of the week when the
[1:15:07] doors were shut where the disciples were
[1:15:09] assembled for fear of the Jews came
[1:15:12] Jesus stood in the midst and said unto
[1:15:15] them peace be unto you and when he has
[1:15:18] so said he showed unto them his hands
[1:15:21] and his side and then were the disciples
[1:15:23] glad when they saw the Lord
[1:15:26] they meant then jesus said unto them
[1:15:30] peace be unto you as my father has sent
[1:15:33] me even so send I you and when he had
[1:15:37] said this he breathed on them and saith
[1:15:39] unto them receive ye the Holy Ghost
[1:15:42] what whosoever sins he remit they are
[1:15:45] remitted unto them and whosoever sins
[1:15:48] you retain they are retained I think
[1:15:52] about it he Jesus entered into Jerusalem
[1:15:55] or Jerusalem would receive him he left
[1:15:58] Jerusalem and how here gathered into
[1:16:01] this room are those that would receive
[1:16:03] him so he turns in to the room and he
[1:16:06] says peace beyond you the same Jesus is
[1:16:09] here this morning amen amen
[1:16:12] it says the same thing until you peace
[1:16:14] be unto you
[1:16:15] I'm here to enter into your heart I'm
[1:16:17] here to enter in to fill you with the
[1:16:19] Holy Ghost amen if you just make room
[1:16:22] for the word make room for Christ he
[1:16:24] said peace be unto you even as the
[1:16:27] father has sent me how did the father
[1:16:30] sent him because the word went into a
[1:16:32] willing heart of Mary Jesus was sent to
[1:16:37] the earth through a willing heart that
[1:16:40] would receive the word even as the
[1:16:42] father sent me now so I send you why you
[1:16:46] have willing hearts you've received the
[1:16:48] word now the same word as in me is now
[1:16:51] implanted into you amen and it's gonna
[1:16:54] bear the evidence and he breathed on
[1:16:56] them and said I'm sending you receive ye
[1:16:58] the Holy Ghost and now the same spirit
[1:17:03] that descended upon Christ and remain
[1:17:05] is now again descend upon these and
[1:17:09] remain I shall be with you I'll be in
[1:17:12] you until the end of the world
[1:17:14] Amen whosoever sins you remit they are
[1:17:17] emitted unto them and whosoever sins you
[1:17:19] retain they retain
[1:17:21] now why do you say that when the Holy
[1:17:23] Spirit comes it comes to judge sin amen
[1:17:26] it comes to make things right what is
[1:17:28] common there is a pattern in heaven that
[1:17:31] is what the earth is supposed to look
[1:17:33] like there is a pattern in heaven that
[1:17:37] is what you and I are supposed to look
[1:17:39] like amen our names were written upon
[1:17:43] the Lamb's Book of Life before the
[1:17:44] foundation of the world and that's not
[1:17:46] just the the English alphabet of our
[1:17:49] names that is who we are what we're
[1:17:51] supposed to be was written upon the
[1:17:53] Lamb's Book of Life before the
[1:17:54] foundation of the world and that's
[1:17:56] reading there's write written standing
[1:17:58] there in heaven Jesus says don't rejoice
[1:18:00] because the Devils are subject unto you
[1:18:02] but rather rejoice because your names
[1:18:04] are written on the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:18:06] up in heaven amen
[1:18:07] and so what your name is written up
[1:18:09] there it's a picture that God took of
[1:18:11] you amen is what you're supposed to look
[1:18:14] like this is what you're supposed to be
[1:18:15] and the Holy Ghost has come upon this
[1:18:17] earth a man to make you your body your
[1:18:20] spirit your soul match what is written
[1:18:23] up in the heavens amen so he breathed on
[1:18:28] them receive ye the Holy Ghost and so
[1:18:30] what the Holy Ghost will do unto you so
[1:18:33] in the when when when the earth was in
[1:18:35] darkness the Holy Spirit came and
[1:18:37] brooded upon it turned it into a Garden
[1:18:39] of Eden amen when Judaism had gone into
[1:18:41] darkness the Holy Spirit came and
[1:18:43] brooded upon it and gave them a promise
[1:18:45] of everlasting Messiah
[1:18:47] now all the Gentile ages has become
[1:18:50] darkness amen and all the tables are
[1:18:52] full of vomit
[1:18:53] amen amen every every house is as an
[1:18:56] unclean cage of every unclean and
[1:18:58] hateful bird amen
[1:18:59] every church every denomination a cage
[1:19:02] of an unclean hateful bird but the Holy
[1:19:04] Spirit has come upon this darkness a man
[1:19:06] is brooding over the people crying come
[1:19:09] out of her my people that you might be
[1:19:11] not be partakers of her sins I have a
[1:19:13] pattern of you that was written up in
[1:19:15] the heavens and I have come down the
[1:19:17] Holy Spirit
[1:19:18] come here in this day it's the word he
[1:19:20] wants you to make room for him in your
[1:19:22] heart so that you might be changed to
[1:19:24] look like what was written upon the
[1:19:27] Lamb's Book of Life in heaven amen and
[1:19:30] that life I have come that you might
[1:19:32] have life and have it more abundantly
[1:19:35] won't you make room for me in your heart
[1:19:37] amen love me adore me amen amen
[1:19:40] make room for the word in your heart
[1:19:42] amen so that the work and come and
[1:19:44] change you and to being what God wrote
[1:19:47] about you before the foundation of the
[1:19:50] world amen and Mary believed the word
[1:19:55] and the Word was made manifest on the
[1:19:58] inside of her amen amen it came out as a
[1:20:01] testimony that she believed the word
[1:20:04] amen so is it to us all every one of us
[1:20:08] have an opportunity to let the word pass
[1:20:12] on by or to open up our hearts and say
[1:20:16] yes Lord come in Lord come into my heart
[1:20:21] and let your holy spirit do whatever he
[1:20:25] sees fit to do change me mold me make me
[1:20:28] shake me into your image amen he again
[1:20:32] in Christ says and Paul said and he gave
[1:20:35] us power to become sons and daughters of
[1:20:38] God amen amen
[1:20:40] the rest of the world they might not see
[1:20:42] it they might not know it they may not
[1:20:44] understand it amen it's a mystery unto
[1:20:46] them amen but the Bride of Christ will
[1:20:49] be a mystery to the world why because of
[1:20:51] the the Spirit has been given unto us we
[1:20:54] are being changed
[1:20:56] day by day and one day in a moment and a
[1:20:58] twinkling eye those that made room for
[1:21:00] Christ in their hearts
[1:21:03] we changed taken up into glory and put
[1:21:08] into that position of the pyramid where
[1:21:11] God has reserved a place for them and
[1:21:13] you were shaped here on the earth they
[1:21:15] they a malicious tan as the father sent
[1:21:22] me so send I you and he breathed on them
[1:21:25] receive II the Holy Ghost amen
[1:21:30] amen the head of the church is the word
[1:21:33] and if the church won't listen to the
[1:21:35] word and the church becomes paralyzed
[1:21:38] and cannot act my brother Brandon said
[1:21:40] that every true church will write a book
[1:21:42] of acts behind it
[1:21:44] amen and that's what we're here to do is
[1:21:47] write a book of Acts behind us not that
[1:21:49] we write it but we write it every time
[1:21:52] we give a testimony of something that
[1:21:55] the Holy Ghost has done in our lives how
[1:21:58] did the Holy Ghost do that room was made
[1:22:01] for him and as a Holy Ghost lays there
[1:22:04] upon the bed that you made for him
[1:22:06] something enters into his mind and the
[1:22:09] Holy Ghost is inspired ask what should
[1:22:12] ever you will it'll be done unto you
[1:22:15] whatever what's the desire of your heart
[1:22:17] with what burning desire is there
[1:22:19] because when you when you when you
[1:22:21] cleanse your heart in your mind of all
[1:22:23] the filthiness of this world and the
[1:22:25] gospel begins to to have room to
[1:22:28] manifest and to grow and to be
[1:22:30] enlightened but in your mind in your
[1:22:32] heart then all of a sudden your desires
[1:22:34] change so you can be about your father's
[1:22:36] business amen
[1:22:39] and when your heart has changed to be
[1:22:41] about your father's business then all of
[1:22:43] a sudden desires start cropping up wow I
[1:22:47] wish I could do this for the Gospels
[1:22:50] sake I wish I could just I could do this
[1:22:52] it's according to the word I wish you O
[1:22:54] Lord I need a job so I can support my
[1:22:56] family Lord I need I need to I need this
[1:22:58] I wish my children love the Lord more
[1:23:01] Lord I wish that so-and-so would come to
[1:23:03] Christ I wish that that so-and-so could
[1:23:06] just be healed of this this constant
[1:23:08] problem that they have I would Laura so
[1:23:11] it's those mind has been put into prison
[1:23:13] and I see the chains upon my brother and
[1:23:15] my sister lord I just pray that somehow
[1:23:18] they'd be delivered and as the Holy
[1:23:21] Spirit is resting there upon your heart
[1:23:22] all sudden it moves lights flesh and the
[1:23:28] spirit gives utterance it says whatever
[1:23:30] you want whatever you desire it'll be
[1:23:34] even as you say what you made room for
[1:23:37] the word in your heart that's what
[1:23:42] Christ
[1:23:42] when he comes into a heart that's we're
[1:23:45] prepared that is how important it is
[1:23:48] that we stay virgins to the Word of God
[1:23:52] amen the word came to a Virgin Mary amen
[1:23:59] the word came to Eve but was not
[1:24:03] received because she wasn't a virgin
[1:24:05] unto the word amen and so when she gave
[1:24:10] birth she gave birth unto death because
[1:24:13] she wasn't a virgin under the word but
[1:24:16] Mary had an opportunity she kept her
[1:24:20] heart to the word alone and she said be
