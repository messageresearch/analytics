you have been so [Music] so good [Music] with every breath that i am [Music] is [Music] we're going to get right on into the word of god surely god is good to us all my life he's been so faithful i can remember the times that god saved my life even when i was a sinner when i've been when i should have been caught by bullets gunfire he kept me safe when i should have been killed by a car accident he kept me safe and now that i look back i could see that he's been with me all along and i'm grateful tonight because he has been faithful as we stand we're going to turn to revelations the 10th chapter revelations 10. we're going to read verses 1 to 3. and i saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud with a rainbow a rain and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the sun and his feet as pillars of fire and he had in his hand a little book opened and he said his right foot upon the sea and his left foot on the earth and he cried with the loud voice as when a lion roareth and when he had cried seven thunders uttered their voices let us pray father we thank you once again for your amazing grace we thank you for being so good to us lord there's no words that can express our gratitude the more we see and understand the more grateful we are father i pray that you keep our heart and mind so focused on this word and give us the grace to make ourselves ready for we realize oh god tonight that there is a translation taking place in one of these moments it'll all be over and father we pray for the people of god everywhere that you would keep our eyes stead on you forgive us of any sin and all sins that we have done that have not been pleasing in thy sight granted dear jesus in your lovely name we pray amen you may be seated we truly thank god for his amazing grace and we've been dealing with the coming of the lord we've been dealing with the rapture because of the truth we better understand what god is doing and like most of us we have all had our ideas of how the rapture is going to take place but i just want to encourage you on this that we don't have to worry about it because god interprets his own word and however god chooses to do it i don't think we'll have any complaints as long as we're part of that translation now we're at a time and we know uh brother branham talks about the mighty angel coming down and he also tells us that was the seven seals and how god really broke those seals himself and if you know anything about the seals you'll find out they were like scrolls rolled up and you had seven of those scrolls rolled up and then of course that last seal would be uh the seventh and that seal had to be broken before the any of the others could be seen or opened so we realized by god's grace that we've had a great thing to occur in our day and i don't know whether we're really recognizing the impact of it because now that we have been smitten and we can't be in the seventh church age we can't be in laodicea because if you are you you're in that spirit of rich increase with good and you know you're naked blind and you don't know it and have need of nothing and i don't think any of us can actually say that we're underneath that inspiration but what we need to see by god's grace is that god has placed us in an invisible age or an inter eternal age an age that even the word or i could say the world don't even know exists had we not a prophet we wouldn't know it but he taught us by god's grace about the eighth day and that eighth day was in the bible according to old testament as a holy convocation and he said really in reality there is no eighth day but that first that that first day goes back that eighth day goes back to the first day and so we understand that now we're in the beginning of a new age if we want to say it that way and in this age it's the age of life now when we were in denominations and organizations you know you almost had like deuteronomy and effect you had the law of life and you had the law of death and that's what deuteronomy is two laws and in those two laws you either experience death by not disobeying or life by obeying but we realize now that the law that we're under is the law of grace and the law of love and the law of grace and love has placed us into a condition where brother branham describe it as an uh unconditional love or unconditional um how can i say it he he showed us by god's grace that god's favor has placed us into an unconditional covenant that's the word so you it doesn't give us the right to sin or the right to uh do anything that's contrary like oh i can just do anything i want to and he said if that be the case if you did things that are contrary to the word then in reality you really don't have what you think you have because if you truly love god you'll do your best to keep his commandments we are of a different seed we're not the seed of any denomination or organization and that's why this is why we must be careful brother random also tells us that if we say i am a methodist i am a lutheran or something like that he said right there you die and you know he said we must say we are of christ or we are of the word because the word cannot die and so i was saying all of these things because when this word came to us and we we saw the mighty angel come down oftentimes i used to wonder what you know one foot on the land and one foot on the seat not even thinking you know of kingdoms because you got to understand that this mighty angel came down to conquer and to shout the victory that's what the shout and the voice and the trump all of these things were literally shouting victory that the lamb had taken the book remember the bible says amen that john wept because there was no man worthy to take the book he said had not there been someone to take the book we all would have been lost now i want you to really think about that because john who had the holy ghost who laid in the bosom of jesus right who was part of the twelve had not the lamb taking the book all of his experience would have been nullified would have been of no value because it had that last episode that last what you call drama of calvary had to take place john said amen when he heard the lion roar or when he heard the lion he looked he looked to see a lion but when he turned around he saw a bloody lamb and so we can understand what the lamb was all about it was the lamb in the beginning remember amen when adam and eve sinned it was a lamb that god slew for their sins lamb is the most innocent of all uh uh creatures uh he he needs a shepherd and that's why we call jesus christ our great shepherd because he liken us as to sheep so we understand that even in the garden of eden the lamb was unveiled it was skinned it was taken the skin of the lamb was unveiled the lamb was unveiled and he took those coats of skin and he clothed adam and eve's nakedness now we must understand that adam and eve a man had on uh fig leaf aprons but adam knew that even with the religion or the act that he had performed he still saw himself naked and the question was asked out asked that god asked adam who told you you was naked so we go right back to the serpent right and we know by god's grace that the serpent calls the mess or the trouble because it was his seed who that came forth out of the womb e of eve first so and it was caused by sex but nevertheless let's go on so by god's grace the lamb takes the book and the lamb uh um was the only one worthy christ jesus he's the only perfect man that ever exists on the earth and the only way we receive our perfection is because we are accepted in him and uh so we thank god for that now you say well brother books where where are you going with this i'm going with this new creation because a lot of times i mean i could say like this throughout my own christian life i miss that scripture that we are to be a new creation and old things are passed away and behold all things have become new now that is a challenge that is something that you and i must understand this must become a reality because having the holy ghost doesn't mean that your life is going to be patched up at some point in time you must die completely rot to your will and god must have complete control over your life you understand me in the way that brother branham said the devil will not won't know what to do with you he's he's teased you he's threatening you he's he's caused you to fall but now you so work you walk so circumspectly with god till now he's confused because all of his old tricks won't and won't work for you so this is what the message does for you this is what the word will do for you this is why it's important that we lay in the presence of the sun that means those books those tapes this bible we must lay there we must stay there as often as we possibly can because that's where rapturing faith lie or lay we who are of god understand that we have been quickened you know people say well everybody say well you've been quickened you already been quickened just so the life of the seed has already quickened you otherwise you wouldn't have a desire for this do you really think it's your flesh that want the word they're enemies they're enemies it's your soul that has been quickened by the word of god so you've got life because you love to hear the word right even paul says i find it difficult at times to do the will of god because he says every time i try to do good evil is there right and he has a battle everybody has a battle right remember the time amen the old indian chief was talking to brother branham and and he was telling brother branham how he has a hard time sometime and uh he and brother branham says uh he said always these two dogs fighting a black dog and a white dog he said well which one when he said the one that i feed the most and so if you feed that unnatural nature the most he's going to win but it doesn't mean that the white dog is dead and dead you understand me but what i'm trying to say is is that you your feeding habits your your your your uh uh appetite or your desires must change even as a woman when she's pregnant her her desires her food changes things that she once liked to eat she may not want that kind of stuff anymore and you know she might want something as delicious as ice cream and pickles but it's what the baby is crying for as to what the baby is calling for right you know i always before i won't say always but oftentimes i said lord you choose me a message to listen to give me because i go and i'm gonna tell you something it always work it always work there's always something there for me now let me go on by the grace of god so when when this mighty angel put his uh one foot on a land and one on the sea you know i was just thinking he was just conquering the world and in reality he was but understand we're working with religious demons you understand me the battle that we're fighting we're almost at the end of this thing and the battle that we're fighting did not start on earth it started in heaven when lucifer tried to overtake heaven god kicked him out then he came down into the garden of eden he deceived the serpent the serpents he deceived eve and this is where sin came in and from that point on the battle field became the mind and this is why the prophet god said that the greatest battle ever fought is in your mind why in this day paul didn't preach of nothing like that paul said put on the whole arm of god he covered the mind he covered the head but you see he didn't focus why because this is the age of the headship as god has come to uh uh uh be uh come the headship of his body satan wants to become the headship of god's body you see what i'm saying so he's they're two both fighting for your mind this is why we have all the battles he's the spirit of unbelief and god is the spirit of belief hallelujah and jesus said if you if you believe all things are possible to you now you and i must understand there's no good in us nothing we can do nothing nothing good in this flesh so we must destroy the flesh now you understand what i mean by that we must be destroying the flesh is the denying the flesh appetites hallelujah whenever the devil crave you you give him something healthy to eat the word of god [Laughter] amen because you and i know that the craving is better than the reality did you know that how many times you've seen a piece of chocolate cake or some piece of fried chicken or whatever the case may be in the natural smells good looks good and you go buy it and it ain't so good but the craving was delicious you could smell it you could taste it it was almost a reality to you that's the way sin is right the craving is better than the reality hallelujah but not with god the more you crave him the better it gets hallelujah so we understand the the religious realm what beast came out of the sea the beast that came out of the sea the one that had the so what seven heads or ten heads however it was that was that religious spirit that we know as the catholic church and what what beast if i want to say came out of the earth revelations 13 came out looking like a lamb but transformed itself into a dragon so when jesus christ descended he was placing one foot on catholicism and the other footed on protestantism and said to you is impossible for the bride of jesus christ to be deceived why because he brought you an open book and in that open book you can see every trick and trade that the enemy has done we're not ignorance of the devil's devices from genesis to revelation hallelujah if you know the enemy's moves there's no way he can defeat you hallelujah and this is why god has given us understanding and what did he say whatever you do don't you join the world council of churches is that what he said and he said listen he said it's not china the bamboo curtain is not the thing that threatens us he said not even russia but he said keep your eyes on the what purple curtain hallelujah he said because that's where the mark of the beast comes in at hallelujah he was the one that told us it's not a chip he was the one it was god coming down showing us in the open book that we don't have to fear those kind of things but we must not be a part of the system hallelujah because remember amen being a part of the system is so dangerous because it is the system that brings the mark of the beast right because the systematic worship is lucifer in disguise oh yes cain and abel go all the way back to genesis lucifer or the devil serpent however you want to say cain amen had a well-organized way of worship he actually went before the throne and the altar of god with with his worship and god rejected him and that same kind of worship is referred to the worship that we are now seeing in babylon beautiful worship beautiful choirs beautiful preachers everything is beautiful but it lacks the blood and the only way there is remission of sin the blood must be applied and so you see by god's grace while the book is open this is why we have victory because the mighty angel came down with the book the open book in his hand and now we see the conquest can you imagine what it must have been like when john saw his name on the book and the prophet god said it wasn't like john saw the word john on the book it's a revelation it's not like a book like this but it's a revelation and whatever it looks like amen it's eternal this is not eternal these pages can be burnt you hear me these pages can be burnt this book can be destroyed but the words that's on the book is eternal and it cannot be destroyed be destroyed you see so when he when you say oh brother i heard and i should think well you know when the lord calls my name how do i know when the lord has my name is on the long book of life you know how you responded to the message called when everybody else rejected it they didn't hear it they couldn't hear it they weren't ordained to hear it but you heard it in your spirit in your soul and you knew it was right that was god calling you hello y'all understand what he's calling you for he's calling you for the wedding supper hallelujah he's calling you to the marriage of the lamb not to an organization or denomination he's calling you to something that is super super super amen more super than you and i can imagine it is an eight it's an optic higher as i heard him say an arctic higher a man than leo deceiver and the arctic as i understand is eight notes higher can you imagine taking us up that higher and this is what he told john come up higher come up because this is the only way you can see the reality of what eternity is all about time travel amen we know john did that and one day we're going to do it hallelujah amen one day the portals of heaven is going to open up you understand what i'm saying these things are available because the lamb took the book [Music] what did it do give us back our rights gave us back our authority and the only way that this is going to work for you is that you have to have faith to believe that it is for you hallelujah we don't know when god said let there be light we have no idea how long it took for light to break forth but one thing for certain god never doubted his word y'all hear what i just said god never doubts his word and if god said if you could ask whatsoever you will and believe that you shall receive it why do you doubt because if that's god's word god cannot come back void and the only thing that can make that turn is your lack of faith you understand me god is not the problem we're the problem listen in invisible union and we understand that that's what that is this is why a lot of people say i'm the bride with that term bride is really not supposed to remain somewhere there's supposed to be an invisible union right remember amen the old rancher's story about the rancher who was looking for a a wife or his son and sent his son out there to find a wife and you know of course they had all of those pretty little girls doing what they do and then he found a little girl amen in the backyard dishwashing everything else who was related amen to the to the girls in the living room right but there was a a time when the girls in the living room had no idea what was going on in the backyard i'm speaking scripture here see in the back of the book something was going on that the people in the front had no idea because you got to remember the book was sealed within and without hallelujah the same way noah's ark was sealed in with pitch in and without hallelujah and the bride of jesus christ must be sealed within and without hallelujah amen and what was happening there was a time when that ranch's son asked her to be his wife and she said me see that's the way that's the real response it's not like i know you was gonna ask me you know what i'm saying no that wasn't the attitude she felt very unworthy of the calling a real bride seed always feel unworthy of the calling who me i'm the least of all why me because i have watched you and i've seen your character right and she says okay i do you know how it is you hesitate for a while you don't want the man to know you're that anxious so you kind of hold up a little bit i do he said hold fast you just be faithful to like come right that's all he asked us to do be faithful to the word doesn't mean you're not going to make mistakes but be faithful to the word do whatever you can do to be faithful to the word and when i return well everybody nobody knew the arrangement that took place on the back of the book because what was on the back of the book wasn't written hallelujah and it was a secret it was something nobody could see it was like adam laying there standing there with his feminine part in him and even the animals that that was around him never knew adam had a mate it was a secret until one day god laid him to sleep a deep sleep brother and said that was like death and pulled his feminine part out of him and formed a wife and adam knew immediately who she was what she was and what she was going to do see god knows every mistake we make god knows he knew he was going to make it before we make it made it yet he chose you why because you came from him that's what the blood is all about he knows your weaknesses he he knew that before he even put your name on the land book of life but what we fail to see is that the reason why he could do that is because you came from him you understand me you came from him and adam knew this is bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh now he's waking up from a resurrection if i would say it like that he's resurrecting back to life and he sees this beast look like himself but in a different form and he already knows where she come from it was god god is not making any mistakes he knows those the bible said the lord knoweth them that are his he knows you came from him guess what this is the part i like adam didn't have a choice for a wife neither did god because there was no other there was no other he was the only god and there was none like him no other and the feminine part there was no other right so he's basically showing us amen how secure you and i are because if we came from him we'll go back to him and what did he do he says listen he knew now maybe you don't understand it but we would have never had fathers and mothers husbands and wives it wouldn't have been like that but adam one of the first things he said to to uh uh eve he says you know basically you know you must leave father and mother and cleave to your husband right but that came by the fall we were all supposed to be brothers and sisters say that ain't right yes it is even in in the in the old old testament when when adam and eve fell even after they failed what were they marrying who were they marrying their brothers and their sisters and when you get to heaven who are you going to see your brothers and your sisters they're no longer your husband it's no longer your wife even though you might be together there is no such thing as that kind of a marriage in heaven everybody's going to be brother is that right my precious brother my precious sister right because in that in that in that in that day amen in that time the reproduction is over all the sons and of daughters of god has been made manifest is that right even though we can't number them they're all there and guess what god said he never lost one so you say well what do you mean brother but why because the book is open we know we came from god and we go back to god that's the victory do you suffer yes it's part of the fall hallelujah but god told israel can i forget you he said i could never forget you why because you're written in the palms of my hand hallelujah let me move on by god's grace you say what brother brooks where are you going with this you see you can be seed and not yet quickened because jesus disciples followed him they knew he was the word they believed he was the messiah but they had not yet received the holy ghost you understand me brother branham was a seed born a prophet he had to come to salvation like everybody else he had to repent he had to be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ and he had received the holy ghost it didn't stop there he himself had to come to what we call the statue of a perfect man and whether you remember you remember the time when brother branham said he was there in that auditorium and and here it was this couple was making out on the front row it was a test because the angel of the lord had already told him you're going to be tested and he kept telling the young people stop stop don't do that and the more he told them to stop the worse they became and the angel said whatever you say remember the third pool was in order he could have spoke whatever he would speak on those people blindness death crippled whatever it would have happened but something moved him and i'm saying this this is very very very important in what i was i'm going to say the devil was agitating pushing him to bring forth a judgment remember and whatever that judgment would have been god would have honored it but what god was looking for was the lamb's nature remember john said i saw a lion brother branham could have been a lion he could have roared it out he could have made the judgment it would have been so but you guess what he did that was his last step that was the crown he needed that was the victory he needed now i didn't know this because i was at a camp meeting and the brother was telling me that the brethren said that after that meeting brother brannon was outside of the building shouting i made it i it you know he understood he needed that was the victory he needed and you know what he said i forgive you well what about stephen stephen had the holy ghost and whatever judgment stephen would have made god would have required it and i always think about this all the time had stephen said may you all drop dead they would have but if he had said that we would have been missing the first church age angel the messenger saul he was there he was pushing it he was laughing whatever he was doing he was cheering them on kill him stoned him and had he given the wrong judgment or the wrong sentence god would have honored it then things would have been messed up but you know what he said forgive them for they know not what they do hold not these things to their charge he spoke almost the same words jesus spoke at a time of crucifixion why are you speaking this brother brooks because the squeeze is coming the pressure is coming you can't fight with the sword hallelujah love will conquer this age the lamb if i can say it like this conquered the dragon that's where god is bringing us to perfect love every age must come to that perfection because they can't be perfect without us and that's why you say well uh me and brother was saying there's so many people dying now or leaving us and message believers you know with this kovac and everything else but you know what god is collecting that's all he's doing and he's thinning down the number amen so when this pressure comes it ain't going to be no whole lot of folks you got to deal with it's going to be a few is that right that's why brother brown said you won't worry about doctrine then you'll be so glad to see a real christian amen standing for the word of god amen hallelujah my message i should have given this title before amen my message is from the word to the word we came from the word and we go back to the word and the word is god just bringing that and coming and seeing what god has done for us come on somebody you and i must understand that we have complete victory given to us did you hear what i say you don't have to work for it is given to you give one you say well how even the old testament saints do you think that they were perfect within themselves they were not but they believed on the one that was perfect and they died with that one that was perfect and because they believed that he was coming there was a resurrection for them hallelujah and you and i must understand that god has done a great thing you say what do you mean brother do you understand and this is what i'm trying to tell the people you know right now we say oh i'm just a church member i go to church i don't you understand it's more than that that's happening you're part of the resurrection you're the very vessels god is using amen after who's going to be translated except for those who really believe this word and have allowed it to be their handship you're already in it amen you say why would you say that well just like i said this morning when jesus rose from the dead he never did go back to the old churches he never talked no more with the pharisees and the sadducees they never did see him ever again laodicea will never see him again and what they're looking at now is an impostor but this bride he said in that day or at that day you'll know i am in the father the father's in me and i am in you that's where he's at he's in you and the more we allow him to uh uh uh unfold himself in us like i said this morning once eating the book the thunder now doesn't echo from heaven it echoes out of you it speaks from you you're the very virtue the very did not that divine nature of god in you as the bible says amen legion wasn't afraid of of jesus per se by flesh but he was afraid of the character that was in that body the devil is not afraid of you but that character that god-given character that jesus man that's on the inside that's what he's afraid of because he knows that that jesus is lord right so what did he do he's on the road to emmaus they're on the road the disciples there on the road to amaze and all of a sudden the seventh seal walk up the man who just rolled away the stone the one who was dead and now he's alive again huh he walks up and he walks up like a stranger they didn't even know who he was you understand me sometimes god gives you things and you don't even know where it's coming from and you don't even understand he's the one talking to you you think these thoughts just pops into your mind and god is talking to you because god projects his thoughts into your mind hallelujah let this mind be in you that was also in christ jesus so when god comes along he's talking to you you're reading the scriptures he's breaking the bread he you're reading oh my i've never seen that before do you think that's your intellect that's the invisible god speaking to you and on their way on their own wait on the uh times you know the bible said that jesus acted like he wasn't going any further and he says no come on stay with me stay with me and he does it still yet today how many times you felt him move away and you said no lord please stay with me oh yes sir what you know i know i enjoy sometimes i guess you say lord i enjoy that fellowship i enjoy and then when your presence is near me and whatever you do don't stop don't pull away and he'll do that just to hear you say that when they sat down there in the tent or in the inn or wherever they were with the conversation they had all of a sudden jesus break he breaks the bread and the bible said it was at that time their eyes were open well you know what people of god that's how you know you say well what do you mean brother brooks remember when that seal was broken jesus did what he didn't go declared uh jeremiah no he went through those books the old testament took the old testament and he preached jesus who was preaching jesus jesus was preaching jesus and he pulled all the way through and they saw it they understood that this same jesus christ he did not die just in vain but his death was already written in the word he opened their eyes to their understanding and according to luke 24 44 it said thus it is written and thus it be who christ to die and to suffer and deride on the from the dead on the third day that repentance and remission of sin should be preached in his name among all men beginning at jerusalem the bible said then open he their eyes to the scripture that they would understand that this same jesus god has made him lord in christ not two gods not three gods but one god and you know what because the book was open we don't understand do we i tell you what we are privileged people because we had a prophet and that prophet a man had the ability to go into the mind of god and come back with the true revelation of the word not just a preacher or a bishop that's going you know how we go you used to go to these bible studies and they said well i i think this mean that well you know this could mean this you see and the bible is not of any private interpretation god interprets his own word even if it's through a man that's what he does but he doesn't use theologians like that only a prophet you love the lord now coming to this place and i'm not going to be too much longer like i said earlier it's all through the bible that god conquered the whole world when he died on calvary and when he took the book out of the right hand of him that sounded on the throne when he took that book he took back the title deed right and then he gave it to john take the book john took the book are you john john was a type of the the bride of jesus christ right and so when you take the book what you're saying i now have the title deed that means i have the authority and everything that adam lost is now in my possession have you ever seen people try to put things together you know i'm not good at good at mechanically setting things together you know i'm you know i'm the kind of person you know i want to skip the direction and just figure it out in my mind worst thing you could do even though you might start out good something's going to go wrong because you did not read the directions and that's the way it goes with the word there's a certain way a place and you can't misplace it it's a certain way you place the word to make it work you can't just do it and you know what the truth of the matter is you can't just call think the word is going to work for you if your attitude is wrong if your motive and objective is wrong you can't use god like that y'all remember amen when peter and i think of james and john they were called sons of thunder lord send down the fire you know yo lord have mercy you know spoken word that's why god can't give it to us until we mature because our attitude is in trouble and jesus said unto them you don't know what you're asking because when elijah called down fire he was not in the right spirit that was not the holy ghost that made him do that when he when he said called call those bears to eat up those children that was a man an angry prophet you understand me but because he was a prophet god honored his words whoo isn't that amazing that's why you and i have to be careful what we speak he said always bless and curse not right you love the lord okay i'm so glad y'all so stirred up about the word y'all shouting out your seats and everything don't believe that oh my god god is good but we must understand that the whole purpose of god coming is to produce his own the world that we're getting ready to embrace will not have any serpents any evil no darkness this world that god is fixing up for us and doing for us amen is a world of holiness of his kind which adam the first adam was supposed to reproduce this is why as i said this morning those who are now standing in that sixth dimension you call it under the altar they are waiting for their glorified bodies they are now standing in their theophanies in their theophanies they don't eat nor drink nor sleep that's why if you hear an angelic choir singing they can hold a note forever because they don't have to breathe in to get more air see so that's the difference we have to hold and breathe and hold and breathe but they do not because they the life the breath of life was given to us on earth you understand me before the breath of life we were living right we were in our theophanies or adam was in this theophany he didn't need that but when he came into this dimension which is a limited dimension which is an animalistic or how he was three dimension he needed the breath of life so god breathed in the nostrils and he began to breathe he began to live so that he could feel taste smell and all those other kind of things that we do in this dimension which is there you don't have so they desire to come back to have an earthly body because that's what we were made for earth is our home heaven is just a vacation but we have been designed for the earth and god is going to bring us back to this earth to live somebody said the problem of god said you being believed that all these people that's died gonna be on this earth well prophet god said first of all god didn't say it like that but he said understand god has worlds on worlds suns and moons and stars he's got all of that we have no idea what's in store for us but i always will believe that this is headquarters this is where it starts but this is not where it ends you know scientists know something's out there or should be out there but just think about it jesus said if you be faithful into littles i will give you ruler to be the ruler over ten cities can you imagine every one of us ruling ten cities and god's cities are not small and if that be the case think about it how many worlds will we need i don't know but it's good to imagine it won't be cramped and it won't be overpopulated you won't have smog neither will you have fog it's going to be beautiful you love the lord i'm almost done with this portion i'm gonna keep chewing and chewing and chewing and chewing because we must understand that god is working on us to make sure that everything of this world is dead to us and we must in order for us to gain that victory we must say father not out my will but thine be done second corinthians 5 17 you don't have to turn he says therefore if any man be in christ he is a new creature old things are passed away and behold all things are become new showing there is a process there's something that goes on that brings these changes hallelujah you love the lord and to understand and i'm saying this galatians 6 15 says for in christ jesus neither circumcision availeth anything anything and uh nor uncircumcision that means you being a jew or gentile methodist baptist apostolic pentecost it does not matter but the only thing that matters to god is a new creature a new creation so from word to word and that's what we're doing that's what's happening now changing us what do you mean god chose us to be his partner that's dan we're going to read and go into uh our communion service am i the only one excited i don't know i am it may not look like it but i am inside of me there's a rejoicing i got friends that seem to be going on to before me and i can't hardly wait to see him again and you know it's just a time and i don't know how much father and how much longer my life will be extended on earth here but either way i just want to be make sure i'm ready i want to make sure i'm prepared to meet the lord and i i thank god for this message because everything i thought i knew i don't know i didn't know you know even in the denominations i didn't know you know that god i don't understand it other than election and predestination and the very fact he says come out of her my people he knew that we would be in that system all of us some way has been linked to some kind of harlot system and god said come out of her don't be partakers of her sin come out of her come to the word right this is the only age that we god calls evil this is an evil age or age of evil and you and i can see uh every from name it you name it name the places you can go uh that has power authority evil just just just just run by it and hear god chooses to take a bride out of such a place like this and only god can make us virtuous we can't do it on our own we we look at ourselves and we see such failures i do in christ alone do i give my glory he's the only one that i can depend on he's the only one that i could say yeah is worthy of all praise because as far as i'm concerned without him all of us will be lost but thank god because he's been rich in mercy that's the message you know god is rich in mercy as we stand we're actually to turn with us the first corinthians the 15th chapter i'm sorry 11th chapter we're going to start at 23rd verse we're going to work this and i'll read the scripture and then go prepare for communion i ask god musicians just to play something while i do so but as we read from the 11th chapter of first corinthians for i have received the lord that which also i delivered unto you that the lord jesus that same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took a cup when he had stopped saying this cup is the new testament in my blood this dewey as often as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you did eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever eat shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat up that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily even drinketh damnation to himself not discerning the lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chasten of the lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat tarry one for another and if you demand hunger let them eat at home that ye come not together unto condemnation and the rest i will set in order when i come i want to drop a note to you laodicea was really rebuked that's where we most of us most of us started god gave us our invitation to come he said we'll be gold tried in the fire and only gold can answer to his call being that we are gold gold is a symbol of deity but god had to clean us up like he did at the woman at the well deity christ in them everybody that received the holy ghost is transformed from an old creature to a new creature so much so that god shares his deity with you and it's not you that's deity but it's the god that's in you that's deity and so here we are great pieces of bread broken and god said these fragments are his body one day these fragments will be placed together and put together like the city of of jerusalem coming down from heaven different stones from different places different people from different places we all have been different we are different but yet and still we have one thing in common and that's christ and once we have christ on the inside of us god liken us as living stones living stones that are united by the holy spirit that's what we are people we are who we are and once we come to see we are bride and stop thinking about what you used to do what you was and you know let the holy spirit wash all of that away from you because that was not you you're a new creature now once christ is in you you're new that's the old man and uh so what we need to do is separate those thoughts from the thoughts of god think the way god would think and this will get us through these times of trials but we this is a beautiful situation to me i'm really enjoying myself probably as a christian more now than i ever have in spite of all the obstacles there's something that's really just leaping for joy on the inside because i know in just a matter of time we'll be changed so as i go and prepare myself we're just going to sing a little song anymore play a song either my faith will go so so [Music] so [Music] so [Music] your name this piece of bread oh god unleavened because your word is unleavened lord lord we come and we pray that you bless all the participants those who have come lord to be a part of this community seeing and understand lord jesus that none of us are worthy but father you have made us worthy and because we are accepted in you

testament church lord that we would wash one another's feet that we will be servants that we would humble ourselves to one another and that we will forgive one another of their sins and they would forgive each other for their sins and father god we go into this portion of the service with honor and gratitude that you have shown us the way of the kingdom of god bless us now as we partake of our feet washing in jesus christ's name we pray amen [Music] our brother uh james has been exempt because of his condition he can't get down to wash feet but god knows his condition we know that we know
