[1:05:24] i'm so glad this morning it was too
[1:05:28] cool and now it's too warm
[1:05:32] somewhere in the middle of the road
[1:05:34] right
[1:05:36] [Music]
[1:05:37] oh my goodness
[1:05:43] that's where it's at
[1:05:46] now this morning we started out with
[1:05:47] acts 17.
[1:05:49] i'm going to read just a portion of that
[1:05:51] today and then
[1:05:53] we're going to go from there to
[1:05:54] colossians 1.
[1:05:57] acts 17 we're talking about
[1:06:01] the destiny of god's will
[1:06:05] and us being in that
[1:06:08] in that will in him uh
[1:06:12] that's why his will be done not ours
[1:06:16] it's uh a beautiful situation
[1:06:19] wearing that we're now beginning to see
[1:06:24] uh what god's plan has always been
[1:06:27] for us now we we didn't know
[1:06:30] throughout the ages they didn't know
[1:06:33] because we had fallen away from god
[1:06:35] so much think about it's been over 6 000
[1:06:38] years since you know the fall of adam
[1:06:41] and eve
[1:06:43] and look how far we have come
[1:06:46] in the most contrary way and
[1:06:49] you know what just like with all the
[1:06:51] issues going on in the world
[1:06:53] uh we were talking and and i heard
[1:06:55] somebody said you know it's not a skin
[1:06:57] problem it's a sin problem
[1:07:01] and once people begin to understand that
[1:07:03] it's a sin problem that has the people
[1:07:05] doing what they're doing
[1:07:07] you know maybe we can repent but you see
[1:07:10] as a whole america and most of the world
[1:07:13] have fallen away so much so there is no
[1:07:15] place to repent
[1:07:17] uh when you think about all of the
[1:07:19] tragic tragedies that has been taking
[1:07:21] place and
[1:07:23] all of the earthquakes and then i think
[1:07:24] in the congo they've had another
[1:07:26] volcano erupts so it's two going on
[1:07:28] right
[1:07:29] and you think about that and almost
[1:07:31] everywhere you look
[1:07:33] the philippines and different places
[1:07:35] islands and
[1:07:36] you know that's the ring of fire people
[1:07:39] and brother adam talks about when that
[1:07:40] thing began to wag his tail
[1:07:42] that's exactly when california is going
[1:07:44] to sink so we're right at that place
[1:07:47] of the sinking of california in the
[1:07:49] translation of the body
[1:07:52] now understanding the opening of the
[1:07:53] word it says that god that opening of
[1:07:56] the word was also
[1:07:57] the gathering of the people it was a
[1:07:59] time when god was going to gather those
[1:08:01] saints who have already gone on
[1:08:03] and i was telling somebody the other day
[1:08:05] i said they must be having a glorious
[1:08:06] time down up in there
[1:08:08] up in there wherever they are they're
[1:08:11] having a glorious time because they
[1:08:13] understand
[1:08:14] what's getting ready to take place you
[1:08:16] know we
[1:08:17] in in this dimension we're so blind
[1:08:20] to the other dimensions but that's why
[1:08:23] god wants us
[1:08:24] to come up higher that's why he told
[1:08:25] john come up hither
[1:08:27] you can't see this revelation on the
[1:08:29] earth by
[1:08:30] being earthly and carnal we've got to
[1:08:32] get into the spirit of the
[1:08:34] composer in order to see what the music
[1:08:37] with the next move in this drama
[1:08:38] is and you are it you know like this
[1:08:42] you know you know we realized a man that
[1:08:44] was samson amen was uh you know being
[1:08:46] paraded and being
[1:08:48] mocked which samson typed out the church
[1:08:50] he became a laughingstock
[1:08:52] the same pentecostal church the same
[1:08:54] powerful church
[1:08:55] that used to be you know the talk of the
[1:08:57] town to talk with the world
[1:08:58] when it came to miracles signs and
[1:09:00] wonders have now fallen
[1:09:02] amen and you rarely hear anything all
[1:09:04] they have is music shouting and
[1:09:06] dancing and confusion right
[1:09:09] they were blind and i asked what
[1:09:12] happened to samson he was blind
[1:09:14] but one thing about samson he was not a
[1:09:16] quitter
[1:09:17] and that's he was the typing of the
[1:09:19] bride she is not
[1:09:21] acquitter she doesn't quit she moves on
[1:09:25] in spite of all the opposition she could
[1:09:28] not feel
[1:09:29] or see in the natural but he had more
[1:09:31] sight
[1:09:33] than the philistines had and he said
[1:09:36] there's a possibility so i want to say
[1:09:39] that even with your
[1:09:40] faults or your failures there's still a
[1:09:43] possibility
[1:09:44] that god is going to answer your prayer
[1:09:47] just that possibility he
[1:09:49] moved on that it's kind of like the
[1:09:51] woman with the issue of blood
[1:09:52] with that little possibility if i but
[1:09:55] just touch
[1:09:56] the lamb of his garment i shall be made
[1:09:59] whole
[1:10:01] and so we realized by god's grace amen
[1:10:05] faith doesn't quit faith is a
[1:10:08] is a man of muscles
[1:10:10] [Laughter]
[1:10:12] and there's no failure in faith
[1:10:17] so let's read acts 17 we started today
[1:10:20] at the 22nd verse
[1:10:22] uh by god's grace
[1:10:32] 24th verse god that made the world and
[1:10:35] all the things therein
[1:10:36] seeing that he is lord of heaven and
[1:10:39] earth
[1:10:40] dwelleth not in temples made with hands
[1:10:42] neither is worship with
[1:10:44] men's hands as though he needed anything
[1:10:46] and seeing he giveth
[1:10:48] to all life and breath and all things
[1:10:51] and that's so amazing people
[1:10:53] when they give their tithes they
[1:10:54] actually think they're giving something
[1:10:57] you're only giving what god has given
[1:10:58] you
[1:11:00] and so many people are so stingy when it
[1:11:03] comes to god but then they want god to
[1:11:04] give them everything
[1:11:07] you know it's amazing i don't usually
[1:11:11] mention tithing but i just felt spirit
[1:11:13] led to me there and he have made of one
[1:11:15] blood all nations of men
[1:11:17] for to dwell on all the way of the face
[1:11:20] of the earth
[1:11:22] excuse me and have determined the time
[1:11:25] the force
[1:11:26] appointed and the balance of their
[1:11:30] habitation and so let's just
[1:11:33] put it this way god knows your
[1:11:35] boundaries
[1:11:36] he set those boundaries you know
[1:11:39] and uh i think it was a brother rich
[1:11:42] brought to my attention one time and
[1:11:44] you know brother rich said you know god
[1:11:46] is so awesome
[1:11:48] he didn't make all everybody nurses
[1:11:51] and he knew those who would be nurses
[1:11:53] he's got the right amount of nurses
[1:11:55] the right amount of doctors the right
[1:11:57] amount of scientists sciences of god too
[1:12:00] but god comes first all that is of god
[1:12:04] but god comes first
[1:12:06] you know you know we're not talking
[1:12:07] illiteracy here we're talking about
[1:12:09] amen god is the creator of all things
[1:12:12] where would we be
[1:12:13] without those who would construct and
[1:12:15] knew how to construct buildings and
[1:12:17] roads and
[1:12:17] all these modern things that we have now
[1:12:20] is very very convenient
[1:12:22] and i don't think any of us would want
[1:12:23] to go back to the horse and buggy
[1:12:25] not me you know maybe if i'm at a fair
[1:12:28] ground or somewhere where you know you
[1:12:30] can get a little
[1:12:32] small experience of it that's okay but
[1:12:34] who would want to live in that
[1:12:36] under that kind and there are people in
[1:12:38] the world that still live that way
[1:12:39] but i'm speaking about those of us who
[1:12:41] are in america where we have the
[1:12:43] luxuries of driving in the car
[1:12:46] anyway those things are okay the thing
[1:12:48] that god has
[1:12:50] issues with is because man failed to put
[1:12:53] him first
[1:12:55] he must come first and he knows how to
[1:12:59] make you miserable
[1:13:02] god knows how to get our attention now
[1:13:04] and that's exactly what he did with
[1:13:05] samson
[1:13:06] he made him miserable sometimes you got
[1:13:08] to go down
[1:13:09] in order to look up so let's go on
[1:13:13] with the word of god by god's grace i'm
[1:13:15] just a little stirred this
[1:13:16] this evening 28th verse for in him we
[1:13:19] live
[1:13:19] and move and have our beings as certain
[1:13:22] also of your own prophets have said
[1:13:24] for we are also the offspring and so
[1:13:27] we talk about a destiny we talked about
[1:13:30] this morning
[1:13:30] how that from the beginning of time
[1:13:32] before time or
[1:13:33] when adam and eve was made or created
[1:13:36] god purpose for them was to be fruitful
[1:13:38] and to multiply
[1:13:39] they failed they did multiply but they
[1:13:42] were no longer producing sons of god
[1:13:44] they were producing sons of adam and now
[1:13:47] now god called them sons of god now why
[1:13:50] because they still was made in the image
[1:13:52] and likeness of god but they were marred
[1:13:55] right the sons of god saw the daughters
[1:13:58] of men
[1:13:59] and took unto them wise so god's still
[1:14:02] liking them
[1:14:03] as the sons of god just like he liken
[1:14:05] all of us as sons and daughters of god
[1:14:07] because we're still made in his image
[1:14:10] and his likeness we know good
[1:14:11] from evil not like some kind of beast or
[1:14:13] some kind of animal
[1:14:14] that has no idea what good and evil is
[1:14:17] they just do what they do
[1:14:19] but man who is a higher order who is in
[1:14:22] the image and likeness of god
[1:14:24] and that's what happened when they eyes
[1:14:25] were open they beg
[1:14:27] knew good and evil they began to have
[1:14:29] their own will
[1:14:30] and their own choices of things
[1:14:33] activated
[1:14:34] while under the word it was only the
[1:14:37] will of god
[1:14:38] and i explained that in the message
[1:14:40] before that is why
[1:14:43] in the garden the second adam who was
[1:14:46] lord of heaven
[1:14:48] said father not my will but thine
[1:14:51] be done he reversed the very will
[1:14:55] of man and placed it back in to the will
[1:14:59] of god
[1:15:00] when adam took it out of the hand of god
[1:15:02] and placed it in himself
[1:15:04] so and in that is where you'll find
[1:15:08] eternal life amen colossians
[1:15:14] you love the lord colossians 1 15.
[1:15:20] one thing i love about this word it
[1:15:23] speaks for
[1:15:24] itself
[1:15:27] it speaks for itself
[1:15:33] we know by god's grace that uh how can i
[1:15:38] say it
[1:15:39] god is rich in mercy amen
[1:15:44] let us never forget about that
[1:15:49] god never forces his by
[1:15:53] his whosoever will god is a gentleman
[1:15:58] right and he never forces anything on us
[1:16:03] he'll tell us what is required of us
[1:16:07] but when it comes to forcing it on us he
[1:16:10] will not do it
[1:16:12] of course there are consequences for us
[1:16:14] not be obeying
[1:16:15] obedient to him but then at the end of
[1:16:18] the day is because of our choice
[1:16:21] our choosing excuse me i'm just having a
[1:16:23] i'm having a little struggle up here
[1:16:25] there you go it was hiding from me
[1:16:27] colossians
[1:16:29] amen colossians amen 115
[1:16:36] let's just uh let's go to the 13th verse
[1:16:40] who have delivered us from the power of
[1:16:43] darkness
[1:16:44] and have translated us into the kingdom
[1:16:47] of his dear son
[1:16:48] in whom i love that has translated us
[1:16:52] into the kingdom of his dear son that
[1:16:54] ain't tomorrow
[1:16:56] that's today what part of us did he
[1:16:58] translate
[1:17:01] and if he translated us already we're in
[1:17:04] there already
[1:17:05] amen in whom we have redemption through
[1:17:08] his blood even the forgiveness of sin
[1:17:11] who is the image of the invisible god
[1:17:15] the firstborn of every creature for by
[1:17:19] him were all things created
[1:17:21] that are in heaven that are in earth
[1:17:23] visible and invisible
[1:17:24] whether there be thrones dominions or
[1:17:26] principalities or powers
[1:17:28] all things were created by him and
[1:17:31] for him and he is before
[1:17:35] all things and by him all
[1:17:38] things consist as we say you can't love
[1:17:41] something you don't know
[1:17:43] you know what i mean you can't you can't
[1:17:44] you can't i mean we we uh
[1:17:47] you know we use the word love so
[1:17:50] lightly and freely you know yeah we love
[1:17:53] i love
[1:17:54] my automobile
[1:17:58] you know what i mean i love this chair
[1:18:01] you don't think can't even do you look
[1:18:02] they can't love you back
[1:18:05] can't even hear you you know what i mean
[1:18:07] but we do that because
[1:18:08] there's levels of love but there's only
[1:18:11] one divine love
[1:18:13] there's a there's agape love and there's
[1:18:15] a filial love and
[1:18:16] we want the agape love that causes us to
[1:18:19] love
[1:18:20] even our enemy let me hurry amen by
[1:18:23] god's grace
[1:18:25] let's just stop there for the uh the
[1:18:28] reading no one more scripture
[1:18:29] isaiah 43 and 6 isaiah 43 and 6
[1:18:35] i did not know i had gone so long on
[1:18:38] this morning but
[1:18:39] i was blessed and i trust that you were
[1:18:42] as well
[1:18:43] uh we know there's a destiny and i'm
[1:18:45] looking forward to it i'm
[1:18:46] i'm really excited for the change
[1:18:50] i've seen where god has brought me from
[1:18:52] i know where i came
[1:18:54] from a lot of you all don't know you
[1:18:56] have no idea
[1:18:58] but i was i was really under the mud i
[1:19:01] wasn't stepping into it
[1:19:03] i was covered right it was god who heard
[1:19:06] my voice
[1:19:06] underneath the mud and pulled me out
[1:19:10] that's just the way he did it no use in
[1:19:12] trying to spare me
[1:19:13] a spare my you know like i've been some
[1:19:16] good boy no
[1:19:17] i was not a good boy hmm
[1:19:24] let's start at the fifth verse fear not
[1:19:27] for i am with thee i will bring thy seed
[1:19:30] from the east
[1:19:31] and gather thee from the west
[1:19:34] and when i i will say to the church to
[1:19:36] the north
[1:19:37] give up and to the south keep not back
[1:19:41] bring my sons from far and my daughters
[1:19:44] from the ends of the earth
[1:19:46] even everyone that is called by my name
[1:19:50] for i have created him for my glory
[1:19:53] i have formed him yea i have
[1:19:57] made him call you
[1:20:01] for his glory we need to find out what
[1:20:04] the glory
[1:20:06] of the lord is let's pray
[1:20:09] father we thank you for your grace we
[1:20:11] thank you for your mercy we thank you
[1:20:13] for being
[1:20:14] so good to us in a time when satan has
[1:20:18] tried to belittle us cut us down
[1:20:21] demean us uh between us and
[1:20:24] everything he's tried to do but you
[1:20:28] in your word has promised us maturity in
[1:20:32] this day
[1:20:33] in spite of all of his efforts there is
[1:20:36] a seed
[1:20:37] that is alive in us that will grow
[1:20:41] until we reach that perfection
[1:20:44] because it's ordained to do so
[1:20:48] and father we ask that you give us the
[1:20:50] grace to surrender to your will
[1:20:53] that we would let go and let god
[1:20:56] have his way lord we pray that you bless
[1:20:59] this service in a special way
[1:21:01] bless the hearers whether they be here
[1:21:03] or on the youtube
[1:21:05] bless them father they may be able to uh
[1:21:08] enjoy take partake of the service
[1:21:13] wherever they may be father we give you
[1:21:15] the glory
[1:21:16] the honor and the praise and we thank
[1:21:18] you for the opening of our eyes that we
[1:21:20] can see
[1:21:21] thank you lord in jesus christ's name we
[1:21:23] pray amen
[1:21:25] you may be seated now if you notice that
[1:21:28] even in the third chapter of revelation
[1:21:31] uh laodicea is being rebuked
[1:21:36] because she's forgotten laodicea was the
[1:21:40] pentecostal age and we understand that
[1:21:43] god has pulled us out of that age
[1:21:46] it's not that we're better pentecostals
[1:21:48] it's just that the grace of god has
[1:21:50] found
[1:21:50] us our roots are pentecostal if you want
[1:21:53] to put it that way
[1:21:54] our roots amen comes from the
[1:21:57] in feeling and indwelling of the holy
[1:21:59] ghost
[1:22:00] but we realize that we're not
[1:22:03] uh we have matured as paul says you know
[1:22:07] when he was a child he spake like a
[1:22:09] child he you know
[1:22:10] talked and walked like a child but when
[1:22:13] that which is perfect has come
[1:22:14] it's come he put away the childish
[1:22:16] things
[1:22:17] and so we realized that all of the
[1:22:19] sensational things that we dealt with
[1:22:21] and enjoy
[1:22:23] in pentecost was not necessarily
[1:22:28] signifying that we truly was sealed
[1:22:32] by the holy ghost we enjoyed his
[1:22:34] presence
[1:22:35] we enjoyed the dancing we enjoyed the
[1:22:37] shouting we enjoyed the speaking in
[1:22:39] tongues we enjoyed
[1:22:40] all of those things for those of us who
[1:22:42] have gone through those stages
[1:22:44] we've seen it we've seen the miracles
[1:22:47] i've seen miracles
[1:22:48] even when i was among them but we
[1:22:51] understand that
[1:22:52] all of that does not signify that you
[1:22:55] have the holy ghost
[1:22:57] what signifies the holy ghost in you is
[1:23:00] when you can
[1:23:00] recognize and agree to the word of your
[1:23:04] day you see because
[1:23:06] you've got to understand that the same
[1:23:08] anointing of
[1:23:09] luther went to the wesleyans but when
[1:23:13] the wesleyans refused
[1:23:15] and the wesleyans were under uh their
[1:23:18] same anointing
[1:23:19] but a higher order of the anointing uh
[1:23:22] that the lutherans was in and when the
[1:23:24] lutherans failed to
[1:23:25] follow the westlands they died
[1:23:29] and the westlands when they failed you
[1:23:31] know to move on with the pentecostals
[1:23:34] they die and so when the pentecostals
[1:23:37] fail to move on
[1:23:38] with the word of their day they die
[1:23:42] the life continues on up the stark
[1:23:45] until it comes amen to a place where it
[1:23:47] will produce
[1:23:48] the very seed that was planted
[1:23:51] amen and what you must understand is
[1:23:53] that this is
[1:23:55] the omega
[1:23:58] time that's why jesus said i am the
[1:24:01] alpha
[1:24:02] and the omega i am the planting and i'm
[1:24:05] the harvest
[1:24:06] and so we're living in the harvest time
[1:24:09] we're living in a time where the sea
[1:24:11] now is laying in the presence of the sun
[1:24:15] amen to do what be ripened amen so when
[1:24:18] god comes back
[1:24:20] again he's coming back for the same kind
[1:24:23] of seed
[1:24:25] he had planted in the age of ephesus
[1:24:29] which was the paul uh paul age many
[1:24:32] people don't even
[1:24:33] liken paul as a prophet but paul was a
[1:24:36] prophet
[1:24:37] the word of the lord came to paul and
[1:24:39] this is why
[1:24:40] paul was able to speak as he did
[1:24:43] right remember paul said in the
[1:24:45] corinthians church he says ah
[1:24:46] he said you're making me nervous now he
[1:24:50] said i would i want to present to you
[1:24:53] i i want to present to god you as a
[1:24:56] chaste virgin
[1:24:58] but you're scaring me you're making me
[1:25:01] nervous
[1:25:02] because you're acting like eve
[1:25:05] and just as sure as the serpent beguile
[1:25:07] eve
[1:25:08] i'm a fear i'm afraid you're going to be
[1:25:10] beguiled likewise
[1:25:13] paul knew what he was talking about and
[1:25:15] why did he
[1:25:16] take this same thing spiritually that
[1:25:18] was taking
[1:25:19] our place in the ephesus church and and
[1:25:22] and
[1:25:22] and liking it into the to the garden of
[1:25:25] eden
[1:25:26] because paul was fully aware of what
[1:25:29] take place took place
[1:25:31] in the garden of eden hallelujah he knew
[1:25:35] amen that it was not an apple that eve
[1:25:38] had eaten but eve was a
[1:25:42] she allowed herself to be a machinery
[1:25:46] of high breeding amen you see that's why
[1:25:50] god could not accept
[1:25:51] cain's offering he was not of the
[1:25:54] bloodline
[1:25:56] he was not adam's seed and so because of
[1:26:00] that
[1:26:00] amen there was nothing he could do now
[1:26:02] god said unto him now if you act nice
[1:26:04] and you come and worship and do like you
[1:26:05] ought to
[1:26:06] you know i will accept you think about
[1:26:09] it
[1:26:10] here was god right there giving
[1:26:13] cain the uh uh the the place
[1:26:17] a place a place in the garden in other
[1:26:19] words i won't separate you
[1:26:21] i'll leave you there now jesus didn't do
[1:26:24] that
[1:26:27] jesus in the new testament
[1:26:30] say let them grow together but i'll
[1:26:33] bring a prophet he'll bring the
[1:26:34] separation amen
[1:26:36] right but in the garden of eden
[1:26:40] god separated and drove cain out of the
[1:26:43] garden
[1:26:45] and cain left and went to god and y'all
[1:26:47] know the story
[1:26:48] but the whole point is is that they
[1:26:50] learned the
[1:26:51] animalistic way of reproduction
[1:26:55] and they began to multiply and multiply
[1:26:58] and multiply and as they multiply
[1:27:00] women began to get prettier and prettier
[1:27:02] and prettier and prettier
[1:27:04] and and then men began to take more than
[1:27:06] one wife you know
[1:27:07] it's like having three or four cars i'll
[1:27:09] take this one i'll take that one
[1:27:11] oh yeah that one's better you know how
[1:27:13] you can't drive four cars at one time
[1:27:16] but that's what people do and they don't
[1:27:19] they
[1:27:19] fail to see amen that when we do that
[1:27:22] amen it is out of the order of god now
[1:27:25] look at god look at
[1:27:27] look at the scriptures when god wanted
[1:27:29] to bring an elect
[1:27:31] to to earth that's going to do a will
[1:27:35] some his purpose he made it known
[1:27:39] samson
[1:27:42] huh an angel visited by an angel
[1:27:46] right amen when it came to uh moses
[1:27:50] visited by an angel right all those
[1:27:54] seats and that was the way it was
[1:27:56] supposed to be
[1:27:57] god was to determine when the seed would
[1:28:00] come upon the earth
[1:28:02] but adam and eve they failed to the
[1:28:05] serpent's way see
[1:28:06] animals you know they uh have mating
[1:28:10] season
[1:28:12] but the woman can mate at any time
[1:28:16] she can get pregnant at any time lambs
[1:28:18] get pregnant uh you know
[1:28:19] and have their babies in the spring
[1:28:23] but you see there's a time they can
[1:28:25] can't conceive but when a woman she can
[1:28:27] do it and why
[1:28:28] because she fell into the animalistic
[1:28:30] way of reproducing
[1:28:32] and when she did that she no longer
[1:28:34] produced
[1:28:36] i said majority of the children that
[1:28:38] were being born
[1:28:39] were not children of god
[1:28:45] and here was adam seed
[1:28:50] and at the end of the day adam island
[1:28:54] had
[1:28:54] eight seed
[1:29:00] whatever went on the ark
[1:29:03] was all that he had left because the
[1:29:06] hybrining of flood swords
[1:29:08] had killed off the two seat of god
[1:29:11] speaking spiritually
[1:29:14] so you see amen the earth was
[1:29:16] replenished but it was replenished by
[1:29:18] serpents
[1:29:19] this is why god said destroy it all
[1:29:22] that's why
[1:29:23] that's why noah could preach for 120
[1:29:26] years and nobody repented
[1:29:29] they were like their father it was the
[1:29:31] offspring
[1:29:36] but yet god says no no no this my word
[1:29:39] cannot come back void
[1:29:43] see it cannot god had had adam says
[1:29:46] listen
[1:29:46] it must be done so god comes down
[1:29:52] and he didn't say he was the second adam
[1:29:53] says he was the last adam
[1:29:56] that was jesus christ god in
[1:29:59] morphine coming down to do what
[1:30:02] restore bring back
[1:30:06] what the first adam messed up
[1:30:09] the first adam as i said in corinthians
[1:30:11] made us sinners
[1:30:14] made us flesh made us corrupt
[1:30:17] and look now over six thousand years how
[1:30:20] corrupt we've become
[1:30:22] man has been he has lost his identity so
[1:30:25] much so he doesn't even know who he
[1:30:28] is or what he is they're tattooing
[1:30:31] themselves they're putting horns on
[1:30:33] their head and
[1:30:34] disfiguring their bodies they want to
[1:30:35] look like animals
[1:30:38] if they could read that mind of a cat or
[1:30:40] dog
[1:30:42] the cat or dog would love to be a man or
[1:30:44] a woman
[1:30:46] and here we want to go that way see we
[1:30:49] it just
[1:30:50] messed up and people don't realize it's
[1:30:53] because we're lost
[1:30:55] we've lost our identity and in the only
[1:30:58] way to find your way back
[1:31:00] you got to pick up the road map you got
[1:31:03] to pick up the diary you got to pick up
[1:31:06] amen the the will and testament and find
[1:31:09] out whose relatives and
[1:31:10] who gets the promises
[1:31:13] yeah but anyway let's go on
[1:31:17] we've been created for his purpose and i
[1:31:19] i want to be i want to do his purpose
[1:31:22] and this might sound really crazy to you
[1:31:24] but you know i says lord
[1:31:26] if i can't be with you i'd rather burn
[1:31:28] up i'd rather come to my
[1:31:31] end can you imagine living eternity in
[1:31:34] the devil's hell
[1:31:37] always thinking about how you did his
[1:31:39] bidding
[1:31:41] thinking about how god tried to call you
[1:31:44] and you wouldn't respond
[1:31:47] that in itself just thought alone
[1:31:50] is hellish to know that there is no prop
[1:31:54] no way no way no way you could ever have
[1:31:57] eternal life and be with the god that
[1:31:59] created you
[1:32:00] that's that's amazing
[1:32:04] fire would be a pleasure compared to
[1:32:07] that kind of a torment
[1:32:11] but god rich in mercy as i said
[1:32:15] always tried to contact man
[1:32:18] and even when mankind had gotten down to
[1:32:20] the lowest of all lows
[1:32:22] he always would lift up a standard
[1:32:25] the bible said that god never left
[1:32:27] himself without a witness
[1:32:30] huh never left himself without a wisdom
[1:32:34] even if it was just only one what you
[1:32:37] say noah yeah you crazy
[1:32:40] you're up in the top of the mountain
[1:32:42] building an ark tell me there's going to
[1:32:44] rain
[1:32:45] and we haven't seen no rain the best we
[1:32:48] have ever seen of water is the dew
[1:32:49] coming up
[1:32:51] so scientifically no doubt they tried to
[1:32:54] experiment and see
[1:32:55] to see whether nora's noah's
[1:32:59] theory was correct and they went into
[1:33:01] the atomic mode
[1:33:03] trying to find out if hot air and cold
[1:33:06] air collides together what it's going to
[1:33:07] produce
[1:33:09] and they went too far you think oh
[1:33:12] god just caused it the rain man did it
[1:33:15] science did it just like science calls
[1:33:18] it the flood
[1:33:19] science is going to cause heaven to rain
[1:33:21] fire
[1:33:23] amen by way of the third world war
[1:33:26] dropping the nuclear bomb
[1:33:28] is going to throw this earth back into
[1:33:30] the fire
[1:33:31] hey in that world we will have a fire
[1:33:34] baptism
[1:33:38] hey mankind but in the whole time they
[1:33:42] don't realize
[1:33:43] what the fire baptism is
[1:33:46] it is this platform it is the stage
[1:33:51] for the bride of jesus christ and when
[1:33:54] she come back to earth
[1:33:56] the bible says she will walk upon the
[1:33:58] ashes
[1:33:59] of the wicked
[1:34:00] [Laughter]
[1:34:02] hallelujah knowing the devil has been
[1:34:05] placed under her
[1:34:07] feet that's our destiny
[1:34:10] that's his will and god let your will be
[1:34:14] done
[1:34:15] he always tried to show himself
[1:34:21] god is a just god he he doesn't
[1:34:24] he always give you warnings before he
[1:34:27] judge you
[1:34:30] but god is a mysterious man
[1:34:34] the bible said that he took moses and
[1:34:38] moses did exploits in egypt
[1:34:42] so much so god told moses you hear what
[1:34:45] i'm saying god told moses
[1:34:47] you will become god unto pharaoh can you
[1:34:50] imagine
[1:34:51] you we don't understand egypt had
[1:34:55] built such a kingdom they had they were
[1:34:58] led they lasted for thousands of years
[1:35:01] i ain't talking about america three to
[1:35:03] four hundred years thousands of years
[1:35:05] egypt was number one
[1:35:09] and god took a runaway
[1:35:14] fugitive enslaved by the name of moses
[1:35:19] brought him back that's right even a
[1:35:22] murderer
[1:35:22] brought him back to egypt with a stick
[1:35:25] in his hand
[1:35:27] i wonder how scientists figured that one
[1:35:29] out
[1:35:30] the greatest nation on earth was
[1:35:34] defeated
[1:35:36] by a shepherd boy
[1:35:40] a shepherd the lowest of
[1:35:43] all loaves it was low class to be a
[1:35:46] shepherd in england in egypt
[1:35:48] and god said listen i'm going to show
[1:35:50] you something you might be proud in your
[1:35:52] business your builders may be high
[1:35:55] but i'm gonna show you i'm bringing you
[1:35:56] down
[1:35:58] and listen let me tell you something god
[1:36:01] hardened pharaoh's heart
[1:36:05] when he wanted to repent god hardened
[1:36:08] his heart
[1:36:10] why because god had already made him a
[1:36:13] vessel of
[1:36:14] dishonor
[1:36:17] is that all right god took a man now
[1:36:21] he's trying to reveal himself
[1:36:22] but let me tell y'all something you know
[1:36:24] why leo the seal is blind
[1:36:26] because god said there would be
[1:36:30] god said it he's a god of god's contrast
[1:36:33] there are those there shall be light in
[1:36:35] the entire some kind of darkness must be
[1:36:37] somewhere
[1:36:38] and he's not talking about the sunlight
[1:36:41] spiritually there shall be light
[1:36:44] in the evening time and you and i must
[1:36:47] understand
[1:36:48] evening time has passed we're at the
[1:36:51] breaking of a day
[1:36:53] midnight has passed we are breaking of
[1:36:56] the day
[1:36:57] is that right the morning star has
[1:37:00] appeared
[1:37:02] hailing the sun that is to come
[1:37:05] and the dog how do you know brother
[1:37:07] because the darkness are now
[1:37:09] congealing together trying to press
[1:37:13] out the light
[1:37:16] but they don't understand never in
[1:37:19] history
[1:37:20] never in the time of creation has
[1:37:23] darkness
[1:37:24] ever defeated the light
[1:37:27] hallelujah there's a light why
[1:37:30] because they said uh the the difference
[1:37:33] between um
[1:37:35] uh the darkness is the light is that the
[1:37:38] the darkness is absence of the light
[1:37:42] hallelujah so you got to understand if
[1:37:46] once light it doesn't matter how dark
[1:37:47] you are
[1:37:49] light comes in you become the light
[1:37:52] right and so that's how it is it doesn't
[1:37:55] matter how dark the heart is
[1:37:58] once light comes in the heart whatever
[1:38:01] was dark becomes light
[1:38:06] so god comes along and he's always
[1:38:08] trying
[1:38:10] and when i went to egypt and now i love
[1:38:11] this i always tell people egypt never
[1:38:14] got over
[1:38:15] moses but moses but egypt was so proud
[1:38:19] to
[1:38:20] they don't really remember moses
[1:38:23] you know just like in that movie how
[1:38:25] seth he said we're going to wipe his
[1:38:27] name out
[1:38:28] we're going to take it off this and
[1:38:29] that's true i i went to
[1:38:31] egypt and and and and the uh what they
[1:38:34] call those people that
[1:38:35] showed you around um the guy
[1:38:38] you know we were there in the library
[1:38:39] and everything she said we don't have no
[1:38:41] record of moses i say
[1:38:42] yes amen that's why brother ben said
[1:38:46] that
[1:38:46] that man who who made the movie was
[1:38:48] inspired by god
[1:38:50] because they have no record of moses
[1:38:54] but we do that's why egypt is in a wreck
[1:38:57] to this day they never got over moses
[1:39:07] yeah so anyway let's move on
[1:39:10] but what what i'm trying to say is at
[1:39:12] the time of exodus
[1:39:14] god was hidden behind human flesh
[1:39:17] god even told moses you will be god unto
[1:39:20] these people
[1:39:21] you understand me that was god in moses
[1:39:25] moses never did one miracle it was god
[1:39:28] who did all the miracles
[1:39:31] he was hidden behind the veil of moses
[1:39:34] you understand me that was god behind
[1:39:37] the veil
[1:39:38] when he said when he when when he struck
[1:39:40] out that rod
[1:39:41] amen uh and and he spoke to the sea and
[1:39:44] that sea backed up
[1:39:45] no man could do that
[1:39:49] i'm coming to something because we got
[1:39:52] to know where our destiny is
[1:39:54] you know i tell you what i don't know
[1:39:56] how the little worm thinks about his
[1:39:58] who he is when he's a worm but somehow
[1:40:01] he always
[1:40:02] when it becomes a butterfly he doesn't
[1:40:04] act like a worm anymore
[1:40:06] right when he takes that madam office
[1:40:08] change and
[1:40:09] he gets into that cocoon because there's
[1:40:12] a hiding place
[1:40:13] and when you get into that holies of
[1:40:15] holies oh somebody help me here
[1:40:17] see i want you to understand when you
[1:40:19] get into the presence of god you don't
[1:40:21] have to work
[1:40:22] it works for you hallelujah when you get
[1:40:25] into the presence of god that's why the
[1:40:28] devil tried to keep us from praying
[1:40:30] that's why the devil was trying to keep
[1:40:31] us from fasting he do not
[1:40:33] want us to get into that element of of
[1:40:36] god
[1:40:36] because you know if you get into the
[1:40:39] element of god
[1:40:40] god will change you
[1:40:43] it's god's business to bring forth life
[1:40:45] in us you can't do it
[1:40:48] just be the rod hallelujah and i told
[1:40:51] you
[1:40:52] that rob was a female rod did i tell you
[1:40:53] that because only the female tree can
[1:40:56] bring forth fruit
[1:40:58] and that tree brought forth almonds
[1:41:01] think about it god was using that rod
[1:41:03] all along throughout time showing
[1:41:07] in type the godhead
[1:41:12] see a lot of times people think the
[1:41:13] godhead is just father son and holy
[1:41:16] ghost those were terms that they've been
[1:41:17] used in the modern language
[1:41:19] but you got to understand that the
[1:41:20] godhead means more than that
[1:41:23] and i'm going to prove it to you brother
[1:41:26] branham brought out some things
[1:41:27] is she what people don't understand god
[1:41:30] if you want to put that away
[1:41:31] has always been changing
[1:41:34] because one time they only knew him as
[1:41:36] jehovah one time they only knew him as
[1:41:39] uh elohim you understand they knew him
[1:41:41] jehovah jairo jehovah nesi
[1:41:43] that was a godhead he was the only one
[1:41:45] he still is the only one
[1:41:47] but then when jesus christ came and the
[1:41:49] holy ghost began to manifest itself
[1:41:52] in the new testament they said the
[1:41:53] godhead which consists of father son and
[1:41:55] holy ghost
[1:41:56] but in their theology they made the
[1:41:58] godhead three and not
[1:42:00] one and they fail to see that the
[1:42:02] godhead has always been one
[1:42:04] always will be one and if you had a
[1:42:07] two-headed monster you'd be in trouble
[1:42:11] god is not two-headed there's only one
[1:42:14] head
[1:42:16] the father who's above christ christ
[1:42:19] who's the head is who's above the church
[1:42:22] and you got to understand let's let's
[1:42:23] just go back to the garden of eden who
[1:42:25] was the godhead there
[1:42:27] who represented the godhead before the
[1:42:29] fall it was adam and eve
[1:42:32] you know what that means the authority
[1:42:34] of the word they had the authority of
[1:42:35] the word they had god
[1:42:37] living in them they had his mind they
[1:42:40] had his thinking
[1:42:41] they had his will they had his way that
[1:42:43] was the god
[1:42:44] hand so if you go if that was the way it
[1:42:48] was in the beginning
[1:42:49] you got to understand that's the way in
[1:42:50] the end you say prove it to me by
[1:42:52] scripture
[1:42:53] because the bible says the spirit and
[1:42:55] the bride
[1:42:56] says come amen amen
[1:43:00] not two persons one person amen
[1:43:03] he said i'll tell you what jesus i'm
[1:43:04] going a different way he said but i'm
[1:43:06] gonna tell you something
[1:43:07] i will let you in this day as you
[1:43:09] overcome
[1:43:11] i will let you sit in my father's throne
[1:43:13] even as i have sat in his throne
[1:43:16] hallelujah now when jesus sat in his
[1:43:19] father's throne
[1:43:20] who did you see jesus
[1:43:24] hallelujah and when the bride sits in
[1:43:26] here
[1:43:27] his throne he sits in our throne which
[1:43:29] is the heart
[1:43:30] you understand that this is where the
[1:43:32] throne room is
[1:43:34] it ain't there that was a replica
[1:43:37] the throne room is your heart
[1:43:42] amen yes i'm not saying there's not a
[1:43:44] throne room
[1:43:46] i'm saying but the major throne room is
[1:43:48] in your heart
[1:43:50] that's where god you are the tabernacle
[1:43:52] of god
[1:43:53] that's why people are so weak because
[1:43:55] they don't want to believe that
[1:43:57] but when you know you've got god on the
[1:43:59] inside of you
[1:44:00] you are as omnipotent as he is that's
[1:44:03] right because he said you could ask
[1:44:04] whatsoever you will and it shall
[1:44:06] be given unto you hallelujah is that
[1:44:09] right
[1:44:09] and the scripture tells us that god is
[1:44:11] more able to give us a bundle
[1:44:13] exceedingly abundantly above
[1:44:16] anything we ask or think
[1:44:20] hallelujah let's move on by the grace of
[1:44:22] god you understand what i'm saying
[1:44:26] let me just read a few things here is
[1:44:27] this okay because i said i wasn't going
[1:44:29] to keep you long and i really don't
[1:44:31] intend to do so but i'm trying to get us
[1:44:33] to see
[1:44:36] this thing it can't go back board it has
[1:44:38] to come back to the reality of who we
[1:44:40] really are
[1:44:42] sons and daughters of god i read there
[1:44:43] in acts 17
[1:44:45] he said we are the offspring of god
[1:44:47] offspring of god
[1:44:48] that means god had a son his son would
[1:44:51] be a god if he had a daughter
[1:44:52] his son would be a god it would not be
[1:44:55] it would not be a horse or
[1:44:57] donkey or cow it would have to be the
[1:44:59] very image of the father and the mother
[1:45:02] it would have to be the very genetics of
[1:45:04] the father and the mother
[1:45:06] is that right so when god produced
[1:45:08] that's why god said
[1:45:10] to uh adam and eve now listen he says
[1:45:15] you must leave father and mother and
[1:45:18] cleave
[1:45:19] to one another because you have now
[1:45:22] become
[1:45:23] one flesh
[1:45:26] now you love that so we look at this
[1:45:29] thing and you say well brothers what are
[1:45:30] you trying to say
[1:45:31] i'm trying to say this
[1:45:34] you didn't create you you did not make
[1:45:38] you
[1:45:38] who you are god made you
[1:45:42] and no matter how insignificant you may
[1:45:44] feel
[1:45:46] it means nothing to god god kind of
[1:45:49] really it's something about god he takes

[1:46:35] stars

[1:46:41] whole human race
[1:46:43] look what god has done mastermind you
[1:46:46] see that's one of those old
[1:46:48] songs hallelujah you love the lord
[1:46:52] amen amen listen
[1:46:55] when we how many all believe that god is
[1:46:59] the word
[1:47:01] god is the word everything was made by
[1:47:03] the word
[1:47:04] what you're sitting on has been made by
[1:47:06] the word what your breathing has been
[1:47:07] made by the word everything is made by
[1:47:09] the word
[1:47:10] see it says god it's your word it's your
[1:47:12] word
[1:47:14] and you know this this word can only
[1:47:17] operate by faith faith is something that
[1:47:20] god gives you
[1:47:22] you can't muster you can't exercise into
[1:47:25] it
[1:47:25] it's something that god gives you it's a
[1:47:27] revelation that you know
[1:47:29] that you know that you know that you
[1:47:30] know and you don't have no explanation
[1:47:33] for it how come this and
[1:47:36] out of all the world out of all the
[1:47:38] religions out of
[1:47:40] all that's going on god chooses you
[1:47:43] and select you to hear what is truth
[1:47:47] see people can argue with the fact that
[1:47:49] they don't believe brother branham is a
[1:47:51] prophet
[1:47:52] but i can prove to you that he is and
[1:47:54] that he was
[1:47:56] just by the things he preached the man
[1:47:59] been gone since 65
[1:48:00] but yet and still the words that he
[1:48:03] preached still
[1:48:04] lives and it's happening right
[1:48:07] now we see the world counseling of
[1:48:10] churches
[1:48:11] we see what they call the the the big
[1:48:14] businessmen getting together
[1:48:15] and people have no idea it's amazing how
[1:48:18] god allowed me to see things
[1:48:19] because before big tech ever became big
[1:48:21] tech they met with the pope
[1:48:24] i saw it and they came back with a new
[1:48:27] agenda
[1:48:29] and they have enforced it and let me
[1:48:31] tell you something
[1:48:32] nothing's going to stop it you know you
[1:48:36] say oh we're going to have a better day
[1:48:37] the better days are over
[1:48:40] and what we're heading into nothing can
[1:48:42] stop it is on a roll
[1:48:44] i don't care how much money you try to
[1:48:45] put to it i love this one and i enjoy
[1:48:48] that one but let me tell you something
[1:48:49] this thing is going to fulfill itself
[1:48:52] amen
[1:48:52] and this thing in america is affecting
[1:48:55] the whole world
[1:48:58] amen it's true everybody seems like
[1:49:01] whatever happened in america
[1:49:02] happens here england yeah everywhere
[1:49:05] it's happening
[1:49:07] because the whole world is being
[1:49:08] consumed by the spirit
[1:49:10] of destruction it has to be destroyed
[1:49:14] all systems must fail you understand me
[1:49:18] before the exodus egypt had to fall
[1:49:27] and before the exodus the whole world
[1:49:31] must fall everything is going to fall
[1:49:35] must fall and at the same time when this
[1:49:38] thing is being
[1:49:39] being done there are those who's covered
[1:49:42] by the blood amen
[1:49:43] aren't you glad to be covered by the
[1:49:44] blood hallelujah
[1:49:46] aren't you glad to be able to hear the
[1:49:48] voice of a prophet
[1:49:50] knowing that it's not the man but it was
[1:49:52] god hidden and veiled behind them and
[1:49:54] this is what we're trusting not the
[1:49:56] flesh of a of a seventh year or
[1:49:58] a great seventh grade uh man born in
[1:50:00] kentucky that's not what we're trusting
[1:50:02] it's the word that he brought a man we
[1:50:06] realized that was
[1:50:07] not a man it was god amen
[1:50:10] and that it didn't stop there that's the
[1:50:13] thing
[1:50:14] everybody think it stopped it did not
[1:50:17] god don't you understand god confuses
[1:50:21] and blind people
[1:50:22] under that seventh seal let's put it
[1:50:25] this way under the sixth
[1:50:28] it shook the people
[1:50:32] when john the baptist was killed
[1:50:36] but it really shook the people
[1:50:39] when jesus died amen
[1:50:43] they had a they had their own
[1:50:44] interpretation just like the people in
[1:50:46] our day
[1:50:47] they never would have thought william
[1:50:48] branham was going to die but he had to
[1:50:51] die
[1:50:52] like john had to die he had to move out
[1:50:54] of the way
[1:50:56] something was turning jesus had been
[1:50:59] identified
[1:51:01] he pointed to the lamb of god and said
[1:51:03] that's my lord
[1:51:05] see but that was the transition that was
[1:51:08] a changing of dying
[1:51:12] and those who followed john was left
[1:51:14] behind
[1:51:16] god gave him a space of grace they met
[1:51:19] up with paul
[1:51:20] and you know he gave him the word and
[1:51:22] they changed
[1:51:23] i know what baptism was you baptized i
[1:51:25] was baptized under john
[1:51:26] baptized john only baptized with the
[1:51:28] baptismal epistles you need to be
[1:51:30] re-baptized again so you see i'm saying
[1:51:33] all of these things they're saying
[1:51:36] god comes along and this whole thing is
[1:51:38] falling apart
[1:51:39] the evidence of what we see small in
[1:51:43] number
[1:51:44] and this is everywhere it is it's
[1:51:46] everywhere even among us people don't
[1:51:48] want to hear the word
[1:51:49] let me tell you something if the word
[1:51:52] don't give you
[1:51:53] joy you are backslidden
[1:51:56] amen hello if you can get happiness and
[1:52:01] joy out of music
[1:52:02] and playing and dancing and everything
[1:52:04] else oh that's good
[1:52:08] but your husband is here
[1:52:12] your husband is here it's all right to
[1:52:14] like your ring and like your watch or
[1:52:16] whatever he's giving you
[1:52:18] but because you like and love that that
[1:52:20] don't mean you love him
[1:52:22] he gave those things to you to gain your
[1:52:25] favor so that you can love him
[1:52:27] hallelujah this is what god has done for
[1:52:30] us
[1:52:31] he's given the word so we can love the
[1:52:33] word because let me tell you what
[1:52:35] the bible says that all shall pass away
[1:52:37] everything
[1:52:39] the grass with us the flowers fade away
[1:52:42] the music fades away
[1:52:43] the dancing fade away all the gifts fade
[1:52:46] away
[1:52:46] hallelujah but the word of the lord
[1:52:48] shall stand
[1:52:51] that's where we are we're in we're the
[1:52:54] word
[1:52:54] we cannot fall it's impossible
[1:52:58] for us to disbelieve the word we were
[1:53:01] ordained to believe it
[1:53:03] like mary we may not understand it but
[1:53:05] be it unto me
[1:53:06] according to thy word of god
[1:53:10] amen see that's where we are that's why
[1:53:12] they call us crazy
[1:53:14] hallelujah listen they're going to strip
[1:53:16] us from all
[1:53:18] nice and fancy things
[1:53:21] everybody that won't join into this
[1:53:23] world council of churches
[1:53:26] you say that can't be true oh yes
[1:53:29] there was another man whom god hid
[1:53:30] behind his name was daniel
[1:53:34] and daniel you got to bow if you don't
[1:53:37] bow
[1:53:39] to the image out there i'm throwing you
[1:53:40] into the lions
[1:53:42] no we're not bowing to the world council
[1:53:44] of churches and the image of the beast
[1:53:46] we're not going to take the mark of the
[1:53:47] beast
[1:53:48] and we don't care i'll open up my window
[1:53:49] so you can see
[1:53:54] we're not going there i don't care
[1:53:56] listen when you tell tell me tell me
[1:53:58] tell me
[1:53:59] throughout all history when has the
[1:54:00] majority ever been right
[1:54:04] never never
[1:54:09] they have made a mockery out of
[1:54:11] christianity
[1:54:14] all the churches they have go there with
[1:54:17] all kinds of little shorts and skirts
[1:54:18] and
[1:54:19] little everything's exposed and then yes
[1:54:21] jesus loves me
[1:54:23] come on
[1:54:27] like i said the other day i'm not
[1:54:29] criticizing a girl i don't know she
[1:54:31] probably just don't know no better
[1:54:33] but i was on the youtube and i don't use
[1:54:34] that no more but i had youtubing
[1:54:37] and they had fantasia on there
[1:54:40] oh my goodness and she was singing
[1:54:45] when he put my name on the road you know
[1:54:48] jesus you know
[1:54:50] huh
[1:54:53] i've been changed i know i've been
[1:54:56] changed
[1:54:58] and i'm like you've been changed if
[1:55:01] you've been changed i wonder what you
[1:55:02] were before you were changed
[1:55:06] but you know not making mockery i don't
[1:55:07] mean to do that she don't she probably
[1:55:09] don't know she just doesn't know
[1:55:11] they're blind naked and don't know it
[1:55:14] because i was out there i used to be on
[1:55:17] the
[1:55:18] on the on a group called uh the voices
[1:55:20] of faith
[1:55:22] and we'll sing on friday night record on

[1:55:29] after we record we go to the club
[1:55:32] oh yeah we didn't know no better
[1:55:36] but as i began to sing the songs that
[1:55:38] song convicted me
[1:55:41] i think that was one of those songs lord
[1:55:43] you know i've been changing angels in
[1:55:45] heaven
[1:55:46] and i knew i hadn't been changed
[1:55:49] but it did
[1:55:49] something i used to hear this song thank
[1:55:53] god i was saying
[1:55:54] you know he watched me through and
[1:55:56] through and made my love brand new thank
[1:55:58] god
[1:55:59] thank god i've been saved i've been
[1:56:01] saying
[1:56:02] and i'm saying lucy
[1:56:07] and nothing in me would say nothing
[1:56:12] but god had mercy he knew the thirst he
[1:56:15] knew the desire
[1:56:16] was to be saved and by those
[1:56:20] words god convicted me and i had to stop
[1:56:22] that nonsense
[1:56:24] i had this big hair overhead believe it
[1:56:26] or not i went to the church they were
[1:56:29] baptizing
[1:56:30] i'm like i got a concert tonight i came
[1:56:32] with this
[1:56:33] because when you wet the fro you know
[1:56:35] what happened to it right
[1:56:36] from there to there i said i can't do
[1:56:39] this
[1:56:40] i'll come back after the concert and
[1:56:43] that's what i did
[1:56:44] i came back after the concert and there
[1:56:46] was brother simmons
[1:56:48] and i heard the voice says be baptized
[1:56:50] in the name of jesus christ i heard him
[1:56:52] he said no you didn't yes i did where it
[1:56:55] came from the outside or the inside
[1:56:57] i heard it who can determine did that
[1:56:59] come from the outside no
[1:57:01] i heard him he was there i got baptized
[1:57:04] when they baptized me in the name of
[1:57:05] jesus christ not only did i i heard
[1:57:07] the voice commanded me to be baptized
[1:57:09] but i also heard the voice says
[1:57:11] now you know the name and when i come up
[1:57:14] out of that water
[1:57:15] it could have been my own experience in
[1:57:17] which it was it could have been
[1:57:19] i don't know what it was but i saw
[1:57:20] lights hanging all off the walls
[1:57:23] and i'm screaming where look at all
[1:57:25] those lights and i was the only one that
[1:57:26] could see those lights
[1:57:28] i didn't know it at the time but you
[1:57:31] know what
[1:57:32] i've seen those lights before when they
[1:57:34] were killing a missionary there over
[1:57:35] there in india and bombay
[1:57:37] they had just burned a missionary his
[1:57:39] wife and family up in a car
[1:57:40] i was at a hotel there laying in my bed
[1:57:42] and those lights appeared then
[1:57:44] i had no idea what was going on on the
[1:57:45] outside until i came out and that's what
[1:57:47] they told me
[1:57:48] god protected me because i i kept seeing
[1:57:51] lights flashing
[1:57:52] i thought it was my eyesight i don't
[1:57:55] know what all that means i'm just
[1:57:56] telling you
[1:57:57] it doesn't make me any different no you
[1:57:59] know what i'm trying to say these
[1:58:01] supernatural things they're wonderful
[1:58:03] but those are the things that i do not
[1:58:04] major on
[1:58:06] i major on life the life of christ
[1:58:11] many shall come in my day say lord lord
[1:58:13] have not we cast out
[1:58:14] devils have not we done many wonderful
[1:58:16] works in your name
[1:58:17] and he's going to say depart from me ye
[1:58:20] workers of iniquity i don't know you
[1:58:22] that's people ministers
[1:58:26] prophets and prophetess all kinds of
[1:58:30] people who
[1:58:30] were used by god but they never came to
[1:58:34] know him and he never came to know them
[1:58:38] they never had an intimate relationship
[1:58:40] and god is looking for
[1:58:41] an intimate relationship with his people
[1:58:45] a union that's how intimate he wants to
[1:58:48] be
[1:58:48] a union not some engagement ring
[1:58:52] a union that's a marriage
[1:58:55] becoming one flesh hallelujah is this
[1:58:59] okay
[1:59:00] let me hurry up listen
[1:59:03] we we it's coming from the message
[1:59:06] seeking after him
[1:59:07] he said god it's your word and take the
[1:59:09] right mental attitude toward it
[1:59:11] that divine promise it will bring it to
[1:59:14] pass
[1:59:14] because there is no defeat faith cannot
[1:59:18] be defeated

[1:59:25] what you understand
[1:59:26] i'm telling you devil this word is god
[1:59:29] you don't fight me you're fighting the
[1:59:31] word the word is god
[1:59:33] and there is no defeat in the word
[1:59:36] that's how you bring it to the devil
[1:59:38] you take it right to the juggling or
[1:59:40] right to the heart
[1:59:41] and let him know this is god this is my
[1:59:45] shield
[1:59:46] this is my buckler you understand me
[1:59:49] this is how i
[1:59:50] i'm straightened in the inner man by his

[2:00:16] one time what you really once you really
[2:00:19] believe
[2:00:22] right that touches him in other words
[2:00:24] when god see that you truly believe it
[2:00:26] it touches him hallelujah let me move on
[2:00:29] amen
[2:00:30] you got to understand then it was god
[2:00:34] and in them days it was god in a man i'm
[2:00:37] listening because i'm working with
[2:00:38] the godhead now and i'm gonna bring a
[2:00:40] scripture here just a minute
[2:00:42] because so you don't think i'm bringing
[2:00:43] a new doctrine i'm just trying to tell
[2:00:45] you that the ark moves on
[2:00:47] it takes it moves place it it changes
[2:00:51] mask right why would brother branham say
[2:00:55] the move is on for the bride
[2:00:58] and why would he have to decrease
[2:01:01] for him to increase and if he increased
[2:01:05] what was his increase it was his bride
[2:01:08] it was god in his bride the holy ghost
[2:01:13] now representing god in the feminine
[2:01:15] form
[2:01:17] oh somebody i just feel just like
[2:01:20] shouting yarn
[2:01:24] we believe that see see it was god and a
[2:01:27] man his son jesus christ
[2:01:30] we believe that not just a prophet not
[2:01:32] just an
[2:01:33] ordinary man or ordinary human it was
[2:01:36] god
[2:01:37] in christ god in a man the
[2:01:40] fullness of the godhead bodily in
[2:01:43] a man
[2:01:46] god in a man see now is god
[2:01:50] in men amen the fullness of the god
[2:01:55] in the godhead see what i'm saying
[2:01:59] the let me yeah let me read it again for
[2:02:01] you so it's
[2:02:03] that don't stir you
[2:02:04] [Laughter]
[2:02:07] now is god in men the fullness of god
[2:02:11] in the godhead in his entire
[2:02:16] church
[2:02:18] no it can't get in planar manifesting
[2:02:22] himself
[2:02:23] fulfilling his word that has been the
[2:02:25] mystery
[2:02:26] to restore eve back into the godhead
[2:02:32] hallelujah what are you saying i'm
[2:02:34] trying to tell you
[2:02:36] i mean that's what it's all about
[2:02:39] you go look at esther what did god what
[2:02:42] did what did king
[2:02:43] hesselro did when when he stuck out his
[2:02:46] scepter
[2:02:46] amen to esther he actually
[2:02:50] gave her power she
[2:02:53] and him became one in the godhead
[2:02:57] and he even brought it broke it down he
[2:03:00] said i'll give you
[2:03:01] half of the kingdom and jesus said we
[2:03:04] are joint heirs with christ
[2:03:07] you're part of it but your
[2:03:10] your definition of the godhead is what
[2:03:12] confuses people
[2:03:16] that those words were only used in the
[2:03:18] new testament
[2:03:23] but when it came to esther she not only
[2:03:26] condemned the devil
[2:03:27] haman she killed all of the
[2:03:30] serpent seed hallelujah
[2:03:35] she restored israel
[2:03:39] she did because she said within her mind
[2:03:43] and she died and let's put it this way
[2:03:45] in time she said we go fast three days
[2:03:47] and three nights without water or food
[2:03:50] in a natural way she dies she
[2:03:52] resurrected and when she rolls
[2:03:54] she rolls with power hallelujah
[2:03:57] and the king saw that that she was
[2:04:00] wearing
[2:04:01] the garment in which he gave her that
[2:04:04] glorified
[2:04:05] garment of praise ain't nothing
[2:04:08] more flattering to your husband when you
[2:04:10] put on something he's bought for you
[2:04:14] that's right he likes that
[2:04:17] i'm telling you he likes that
[2:04:21] and immediately he's going to compliment
[2:04:23] you because he realized you wearing that
[2:04:25] i bought you that didn't i
[2:04:27] yeah you know and that's how it was with
[2:04:29] the king
[2:04:30] he was overwhelmed with her beauty and
[2:04:33] for the fact
[2:04:34] that she was wearing the garment he gave
[2:04:37] her
[2:04:40] so you see what i'm saying what is your
[2:04:43] garment
[2:04:44] is christ put on him
[2:04:48] we must put on christ what is christ the
[2:04:51] anointing
[2:04:52] we put him on and he puts us on we
[2:04:55] become
[2:04:56] one oh my god
[2:04:59] god is doing something and we cannot
[2:05:02] allow church
[2:05:03] entity and christianity as we call it to
[2:05:06] be our hindrance of growth
[2:05:08] we've got to go beyond pentecost we must
[2:05:11] manifest
[2:05:12] god in a way that they did not
[2:05:16] see that's what the prophet was trying
[2:05:18] to tell them when they were majoring on
[2:05:20] speaking in tongues and shouting and
[2:05:21] dancing he said listen there's a lot of
[2:05:23] people among you
[2:05:24] who do that and they don't have it the
[2:05:26] character of christ is not there
[2:05:29] and power without character is satanic
[2:05:32] i'm trying to tell you
[2:05:33] what's in your ranks because you have
[2:05:35] altered the word
[2:05:36] and you made it the evidence of the holy
[2:05:38] ghost speaking in tongues
[2:05:40] you allow satan to come in and deceive
[2:05:42] you and so therefore
[2:05:43] another seed has been planted and now
[2:05:45] the serpents are standing in the doorway
[2:05:48] of your church just like they did in the
[2:05:50] doorway
[2:05:51] when jesus came your preachers he said
[2:05:55] he called them serpents he said they
[2:05:56] won't go in
[2:05:58] and they won't let you go in and they're
[2:06:00] holding the truth
[2:06:01] in unrighteousness understand me they
[2:06:04] know who i
[2:06:05] am and because of their jealousy they
[2:06:07] have plotted against me to kill me
[2:06:09] that's what he said is there parable he
[2:06:13] spoke it he said the king sent his own
[2:06:16] son
[2:06:16] he had already sent laborers into the
[2:06:18] vineyard
[2:06:19] he he sent them there and they killed
[2:06:21] them all
[2:06:23] when they ran them off and here and then
[2:06:25] and then when the sun came to oh
[2:06:27] this is the sun let us kill him that we
[2:06:30] may get his inheritance
[2:06:32] and that's exactly what they've done
[2:06:34] these mega churches
[2:06:35] instead of giving it to the people of
[2:06:37] god they have taken it upon themselves
[2:06:40] stealing god's inheritance hmm
[2:06:44] i'm just telling you we're there i'm
[2:06:47] feeling close i'm feeling close
[2:06:51] see now it's guarding men the fullness
[2:06:54] of the god here
[2:06:55] in the godhead that in his entire church
[2:06:58] manifesting himself
[2:06:59] fulfilling his word now we find god
[2:07:03] of all ages has skin on it
[2:07:07] he god has been hidden behind
[2:07:11] the veil in other words god
[2:07:15] came down he revealed himself to some
[2:07:18] and he hid himself from others by the
[2:07:21] veil of william branham
[2:07:23] god has done the same thing in this day
[2:07:25] that's right
[2:07:27] here's the bride of jesus christ is on
[2:07:29] the scene and he's hiding himself behind
[2:07:31] his people
[2:07:32] they call you a lunatic they call you
[2:07:34] brendamites they call you a cult
[2:07:36] they call you all of these things just
[2:07:38] like they did jesus
[2:07:39] he promised it didn't he he said if they
[2:07:41] did it in the green tree what they gonna
[2:07:43] do in the drive
[2:07:44] right if they you understand me so you
[2:07:46] got to understand it man
[2:07:47] all of these things are really wonderful
[2:07:49] especially
[2:07:51] when you have come to a level in god you
[2:07:53] know who you
[2:07:54] are
[2:07:57] and we don't put on acting we don't put
[2:08:00] on displays
[2:08:02] they have gotten so much hollywood into
[2:08:05] the pentecostal realm
[2:08:06] and into the message and i'm going to
[2:08:09] say it again
[2:08:10] you pray for people come out devil come
[2:08:13] out
[2:08:14] come out i know you in there come
[2:08:18] spending hours with drama
[2:08:22] and the whole time the devil is laughing
[2:08:24] at you
[2:08:26] because he knows you don't even believe
[2:08:27] what you're screaming
[2:08:31] when jesus said come out of her
[2:08:34] that was it the devil had to leave
[2:08:37] when that when you when that man who had
[2:08:39] epilepsy and
[2:08:41] and jesus spoke over that man and told
[2:08:43] that devil to come out
[2:08:44] the devil acted up you see the devil of
[2:08:46] drama
[2:08:47] he loved drama you ever seen people like
[2:08:50] that they just love drama
[2:08:56] i've seen it i've seen you say one thing
[2:08:59] they waving their head i saw a girl get
[2:09:02] beat up like that
[2:09:04] big old girl big girl i better not call

[2:09:52] i mean this girl must have had some
[2:09:53] brothers she stood up
[2:09:56] and then she grabbed cat this is a big
[2:09:58] girl with a little this little girl
[2:10:00] literally lifting her and the whole time
[2:10:04] no forgive me i can't get it out my mind
[2:10:09] every time she hears her can't go
[2:10:16] i called her name lord forgive me
[2:10:20] but i learned a lesson you can never go
[2:10:22] by anybody's size
[2:10:24] you don't know what they're packing
[2:10:28] all right you know what i think about
[2:10:31] let me move on let me move on
[2:10:33] so my point is this goliath thought the
[2:10:36] same thing
[2:10:38] he waving his probably so everything oh
[2:10:41] david you do a little something you
[2:10:42] run and don't know i'm gonna take your
[2:10:44] head off and david said but you don't
[2:10:46] understand
[2:10:47] i come in the name of the lord david
[2:10:50] didn't fuss with him
[2:10:52] david took it says no no no you the
[2:10:54] one's gonna die
[2:10:56] and i'm gonna take your head off can you
[2:10:59] imagine a little boy talking stuff like
[2:11:01] that
[2:11:02] but david knew what he was packing
[2:11:04] brother bradley said
[2:11:05] do we have any davids do we have it and
[2:11:08] david's left
[2:11:10] people who are not afraid of
[2:11:11] circumstances and the things that the
[2:11:14] devil tried to put on you
[2:11:15] he is a liar i don't care what kind of
[2:11:19] sickness he's a liar
[2:11:21] that's not yours that's not your
[2:11:23] headache that's not
[2:11:24] your blood pressure that's not your
[2:11:26] diabetes that's his stuff
[2:11:28] god healed us with his stripes we were
[2:11:32] healed
[2:11:34] 2 000 years ago and the medals are still
[2:11:37] work
[2:11:41] and the devil knows it
[2:11:47] god is so good to us
[2:11:52] you love the lord
[2:11:56] i'm just going to stop here but uh let
[2:11:59] me read this
[2:12:00] because this is what god is don't worry
[2:12:02] about vindication
[2:12:05] god will vindicate his word if you stand
[2:12:08] on his word
[2:12:09] he's going to vindicate it sometimes god
[2:12:13] allows you to go to the extreme before
[2:12:15] he comes through
[2:12:17] in other words he might let you walk
[2:12:19] directly into the fire
[2:12:22] before he come and rescue you but he
[2:12:25] will
[2:12:27] he's done it before you understand me
[2:12:29] god don't keep us out of trouble
[2:12:32] he just don't that's part of it
[2:12:35] how much do you really love him how much
[2:12:38] do you really believe him and you know
[2:12:40] every time when things are going well i
[2:12:42] just love the lord
[2:12:43] but when things go rough do you still
[2:12:45] love him
[2:12:48] remember the prophet god tell about that
[2:12:49] little story about those poor
[2:12:51] poor couple who didn't have much lived
[2:12:54] in the box cart
[2:12:55] from on the train track and he went up
[2:12:58] to the
[2:12:59] house of the rich people where he he had
[2:13:01] married them and
[2:13:03] here he peeps through the door the
[2:13:04] window or however he
[2:13:06] kind of looks in there and they fussing
[2:13:08] and caring on about what happened the
[2:13:09] night before at the party
[2:13:11] and the man was jealous of his wife
[2:13:12] because she she um
[2:13:15] dance with somebody else and they
[2:13:16] screaming and hollering at everybody
[2:13:18] each other and then knocked on the door
[2:13:20] to see it brother branham come
[2:13:23] god bless you brother bran
[2:13:26] how y'all doing we're just doing well
[2:13:29] aren't we honey
[2:13:31] you better smile too
[2:13:37] you see what i'm saying hypocrites
[2:13:40] he said and then i went down and i found
[2:13:42] out from my brother what happened to
[2:13:44] that couple who didn't have
[2:13:45] holly nothing when he got married his
[2:13:47] hair was shagged and everything else it
[2:13:49] didn't have nothing to give her but love
[2:13:51] he went down in there and he said i i
[2:13:54] felt like a hypocrite i
[2:13:55] i was looking in on there and here he
[2:13:57] had just gotten off from work and she's
[2:13:59] sitting on his lap
[2:14:00] and and they're they're counting the
[2:14:02] money and he wanted to go buy her a
[2:14:04] dress and
[2:14:05] she said honey i don't need a dress and
[2:14:07] you know all that kind of thing and
[2:14:09] you know we yeah he and he goes on and
[2:14:11] said but
[2:14:12] they loved each other so much he said
[2:14:15] who was the rich ones
[2:14:18] see being rich doesn't guarantee you
[2:14:21] happiness and joy
[2:14:23] well i want to i want somebody that can
[2:14:25] financially take care of me
[2:14:27] but that don't mean you're going to be
[2:14:28] happy
[2:14:31] find somebody you love that's going to
[2:14:33] love you and going to endure see that's
[2:14:35] what god wants he don't want somebody
[2:14:37] to love him because of his riches oh god
[2:14:40] is good to me
[2:14:41] but what ain't he when he doesn't when
[2:14:43] he's not
[2:14:44] or when you think he's not hallelujah
[2:14:47] when trials are coming do you still love
[2:14:49] him
[2:14:49] when somebody gets sick and ready to die
[2:14:52] or even die you do you still love
[2:14:54] him or do you get angry with him you see
[2:14:58] no all things work together for the good
[2:15:01] of them that love god
[2:15:03] you got to love him in the pain the
[2:15:05] sorrow the shame or whatever
[2:15:07] you love him still that's the kind of
[2:15:08] bride he wants he wants somebody that's
[2:15:10] going to stick with him
[2:15:11] like i've tried to sell somebody i said
[2:15:13] that's the thing about a lot of
[2:15:14] christians
[2:15:15] like i said this morning i'm getting
[2:15:16] ready to close on this segment then
[2:15:18] we'll when we preach again we'll
[2:15:19] move on with it but the point is
[2:15:23] sometimes people misunderstand love
[2:15:26] and like i said this morning they think
[2:15:28] love is giving give me this give me that
[2:15:31] that ain't that is not
[2:15:36] love is too thick and thin
[2:15:39] i've seen people do some crazy things
[2:15:45] wife or someone get afflicted husband
[2:15:47] get afflicted and
[2:15:48] then they want to write them a divorce
[2:15:50] you never loved that person
[2:15:53] things are going to change
[2:15:56] all flowers fade
[2:16:00] nothing remains the same but the word
[2:16:04] but somewhere you got to come to grips
[2:16:06] whether you know this is love
[2:16:08] or this is convenience and i've seen
[2:16:11] people marry for
[2:16:13] convenience
[2:16:17] stuck like chuck
[2:16:20] people in this message i've seen
[2:16:23] congolese people and different other
[2:16:24] people
[2:16:25] england people from england a couple
[2:16:27] married each other in the military
[2:16:28] because they wanted
[2:16:30] better tax breaks
[2:16:34] that's how the devil fooled people
[2:16:37] but when it comes to marrying god
[2:16:42] the thing about god is when you come to
[2:16:44] marry him he says you got to give up
[2:16:45] everything
[2:16:48] i don't want nothing in your past
[2:16:52] to come between us
[2:16:55] so you got to give it up all give up
[2:16:58] all i don't care who it is or what it is
[2:17:04] when you come to the altar you come just
[2:17:06] as i am
[2:17:11] i don't have nothing to give nothing in
[2:17:13] my hands i have to bring i'm not
[2:17:15] clinging to anything
[2:17:16] i'm coming just as i have i'm
[2:17:18] surrendering my thoughts
[2:17:19] my ways my habits my everything i'm
[2:17:22] surrendering all to you lord
[2:17:24] i'm stripping myself naked so you can
[2:17:26] see everything
[2:17:28] i have nothing to bring but i understand
[2:17:31] you're the only one that can clothe me
[2:17:34] you can take away my shame you can build
[2:17:37] me into a person
[2:17:39] a real person this is what i come for
[2:17:43] i want to be united with you lord
[2:17:46] and it doesn't matter what circumstances
[2:17:50] i want you you're the treasure
[2:17:55] that i have found
[2:17:58] and the thing about it in closing i i'll
[2:18:02] finish this later i think about the rich
[2:18:06] young ruler sometimes
[2:18:08] and how god told him says listen you've
[2:18:10] been a real christian
[2:18:12] i'm paraphrasing it you've done all the
[2:18:14] works
[2:18:15] you've done everything that's needed to
[2:18:17] be done
[2:18:23] but you haven't given up your most
[2:18:26] prized possession
[2:18:30] and i want you to give that up sell
[2:18:34] all that you have and come follow me
[2:18:39] so close to the kingdom and yet he
[2:18:42] turned and walked away because
[2:18:45] he still was holding on to worldly
[2:18:47] things
[2:18:48] a lot of christians are will find
[2:18:50] themselves in that position
[2:18:52] they fail to see
[2:18:56] that the offer that god has given you
[2:19:00] can't even be compared to what you have
[2:19:04] you want to hold on to your pennies when
[2:19:07] god wants to give you trillions
[2:19:09] zillions whatever and you think this
[2:19:13] life is something it ain't worth two
[2:19:15] cent
[2:19:16] it's like a vapor you can't even grab it
[2:19:20] you can't hold it it's not there long
[2:19:23] enough
[2:19:24] it disappears that's right that's what
[2:19:27] james said
[2:19:28] this life is like a vapor a vapor's a
[2:19:31] short period of time
[2:19:32] once was there now it's gone and you
[2:19:35] want to hold on to that vapor
[2:19:38] tell me if it's possible it's not
[2:19:42] it's for a moment and it's going to next
[2:19:46] right so you say well brothers what are
[2:19:49] you trying to say
[2:19:50] and jesus says i'm offering you eternal
[2:19:52] life
[2:19:53] a vapor can't even be compared i don't
[2:19:55] even how would you count a vapor into
[2:19:57] eternal life
[2:20:00] but most people look at this world like
[2:20:02] i want to live like that
[2:20:04] y'all too strict i can't do this
[2:20:08] i can't do that well okay let's see when
[2:20:11] you get to hell you can do it
[2:20:15] people think and i'm closing people
[2:20:16] think when i get the hair they don't say
[2:20:18] it
[2:20:19] but many people do they don't they think
[2:20:21] going down the hell they're gonna be
[2:20:22] partying
[2:20:23] you'll be jumping but it won't be bad
[2:20:25] music
[2:20:27] and that's what people don't understand
[2:20:29] this life is nothing
[2:20:32] you're going to die can't carry nothing
[2:20:34] with you
[2:20:35] and everything you think is worth
[2:20:37] something it ain't worth nothing
[2:20:39] and think about it every that's what
[2:20:41] solomon said it's vanity
[2:20:43] you don't work all your life to save up
[2:20:45] all this money you
[2:20:47] die and a fool comes around and spend it
[2:20:50] in a day
[2:20:54] they don't care i don't seen it
[2:20:58] when somebody die the money hunters come
[2:21:03] they do the relatives come i want this i
[2:21:05] want that i want this
[2:21:06] sometimes the people ain't even in their
[2:21:08] grave yet
[2:21:10] but that's what they do so solomon's
[2:21:13] right
[2:21:13] it's vanity we put emphasis in the wrong
[2:21:16] place
[2:21:17] what we need to be concentrating on
[2:21:18] right now faith
[2:21:21] virtue knowledge temperance patience
[2:21:24] godliness brotherly kindness holy ghost
[2:21:26] the capstone of god
[2:21:27] capping us off that's where we what we
[2:21:30] should be building
[2:21:31] that's where our emphasis should be lord
[2:21:34] help me
[2:21:35] make me into that perfect statue of
[2:21:37] christ
[2:21:39] let me be that individual that you would
[2:21:41] house your holy spirit here
[2:21:44] that i would be a reflection of you in
[2:21:46] this last day that's
[2:21:48] my goal let's stand
[2:21:53] everything has a destiny you take an
[2:21:56] automobile shop you got all kinds of
[2:21:59] nuts and bolts
[2:22:01] and screws and paint and
[2:22:04] you name it all those things look like
[2:22:07] jump
[2:22:08] put laying on the floor if you put them
[2:22:10] all together un
[2:22:11] unconnected but when you start
[2:22:14] connecting those pieces together
[2:22:16] whoo that thing started looking good
[2:22:19] right
[2:22:20] and the finished product it looks real
[2:22:22] good but they got to give it the final
[2:22:24] test put some oil and some gas in it
[2:22:27] and crank it up and he says oh that baby
[2:22:30] running real good
[2:22:31] it's amazing right amen
[2:22:34] but if you would you as they were before
[2:22:38] united and connected by boats
[2:22:42] it was just a pile of junk that's how
[2:22:45] the body of christ was
[2:22:47] just a pile of junk but the mechanic
[2:22:51] the holy spirit is putting it all
[2:22:54] together
[2:22:55] and every cylinder is going to work
[2:22:58] everything in this car
[2:23:00] let me tell you something people before
[2:23:03] it's all over these people who have
[2:23:06] mocked us
[2:23:07] and laughed and made fun
[2:23:11] they're going to see who god has chosen
[2:23:17] for his bride
[2:23:20] i'm not saying everybody who identify
[2:23:23] themselves with william branham is going
[2:23:24] to make it either
[2:23:26] there's a lot that won't because they're
[2:23:29] not hearing it
[2:23:31] they're slumbering still you're not
[2:23:34] taking heat to the warning it's so late
[2:23:36] in the evening it makes me nervous
[2:23:38] i got so many things that needs to be
[2:23:41] done
[2:23:42] in my life and i know it's only by the
[2:23:45] mercies and grace of god it's going to
[2:23:47] be done
[2:23:48] but there is no quitting there is no
[2:23:51] giving up
[2:23:52] there is no surrender because in the
[2:23:55] depths of my heart
[2:23:56] i know who i am it doesn't matter how
[2:23:59] the devil tried to deceive me and
[2:24:02] things and make me think i am not but
[2:24:04] god says i am
[2:24:06] hallelujah let's pray father god we come
[2:24:08] before you we thank you for your grace
[2:24:10] and your mercy
[2:24:11] thank you for being so good to us lord
[2:24:15] we are in you and you are in us
[2:24:18] that's what makes us who we are none of
[2:24:21] us can declare these things of our own
[2:24:24] only because you said so and because you
[2:24:27] say
[2:24:28] so we believe it we receive you told
[2:24:30] mary she was going to have the christ
[2:24:32] child she wasn't the only virgin
[2:24:36] it wasn't because she lived much cleaner
[2:24:38] than the others
[2:24:40] they were virgins but you selected her
[2:24:44] you chose her from the foundation of the
[2:24:47] world and when isaiah was
[2:24:48] speaking that word a virgin shall
[2:24:50] conceive
[2:24:52] it sent out that message it sent out the
[2:24:55] seed
[2:24:57] it sent out a word that would create
[2:24:59] this little baby girl
[2:25:00] in somebody's womb it protected her
[2:25:04] through all her life
[2:25:06] no doubt she had temptations and of some
[2:25:09] sort of kind
[2:25:10] but god you kept her you kept her faith
[2:25:13] in church because
[2:25:14] the word said so it was your plan it was
[2:25:18] her
[2:25:18] destiny and you made it come to pass
[2:25:21] now we know her amen and all christians
[2:25:24] will and don't do know her lord you
[2:25:28] you call saul who was one you called
[2:25:31] paul who was once saul
[2:25:34] and even though saul didn't who know who
[2:25:35] he was he was
[2:25:37] crashing the church he was crucified he
[2:25:40] was he was he was literally killing the
[2:25:42] people
[2:25:42] who he called heretics until one day
[2:25:46] his election caught up with his destiny
[2:25:49] and lord you spoke to him directly
[2:25:54] and said unto him saul saul why
[2:25:56] persecuted thou me
[2:25:58] and for the first time he heard your
[2:26:02] voice
[2:26:03] he knew who you were
[2:26:07] you said i am jesus
[2:26:11] it is i am the one you are
[2:26:15] persecuting don't you know it's hard to
[2:26:17] kick against the prayer
[2:26:20] a revelation broke that the very god
[2:26:24] he was persecuting he killed stephen
[2:26:28] he killed others those who were your
[2:26:31] children
[2:26:33] now he understood why stephen responded
[2:26:36] the way he did
[2:26:37] lord forgive them and hold not these
[2:26:40] things to their charge
[2:26:41] it was you and stephen lord now this
[2:26:44] pill of fire is speaking to me
[2:26:47] so i'll go there's a man by the name of
[2:26:49] ananias
[2:26:51] he'll tell you what to do we understand
[2:26:54] by god's grace we know the story
[2:26:57] a a persecutor a murderer
[2:27:00] of the christian church became the
[2:27:03] leader
[2:27:04] of the people he once hated god you knew
[2:27:07] all about it but you do strange and
[2:27:10] wonderful things
[2:27:12] look at us many of us were
[2:27:16] really bad living people
[2:27:18] [Music]
[2:27:23] but you look beyond our faults and you
[2:27:26] saw our needs
[2:27:28] you saw the seed of predestination you
[2:27:31] saw
[2:27:32] the election that was in our lives and
[2:27:34] you called us
[2:27:35] you drew us you gave us ears to hear
[2:27:38] you gave us understanding now we know
[2:27:42] who we are we know our relationship with
[2:27:46] you
[2:27:46] and we know that this revelation
[2:27:50] will cause all darkness
[2:27:52] [Music]
[2:27:53] to be dispelled and the light of god
[2:27:57] will flow through every
[2:27:58] fiber of our being so much so that will
[2:28:01] be changed
[2:28:03] from this corruption to that which is
[2:28:07] incorruptible
[2:28:09] will change from mortal to immortality
[2:28:14] would take off this robe of crush
[2:28:17] corruption lord as we said
[2:28:18] and put on that which incorruptable
[2:28:22] father you said it you spoke it
[2:28:26] we believe it we receive it
[2:28:29] it's our destiny to be
[2:28:33] sons and daughters of the most
[2:28:36] high god thank you lord jesus
[2:28:40] for being so wonderful words cannot
