hallelujah so we want to thank the lord and uh for safe journey and safe travel literally just coming in off the road a few minutes ago we uh come pulling right in just as just as quick as we could and uh and so you know we we uh we just thank the lord because you know so much of that travel like that can get very complicated anyways and uh especially with having to wear a mask in and out of a place and you're always trying to watch okay where did i touch and what did i touch and all this kind of stuff you know and but you know thank the lord that we was able to get here safely and and uh so appreciate the lord i wish my wife could be here to sing and all that uh she can't she's school teaching and and uh school is back in session and uh so y'all gonna have to put up with me sorry

from many many years ago uh if you're a quartet fella somebody by the name of rex neal and if you ever hear the needles they used to sing this one all the time and i like this kindly to me couples with what we were just saying when he says [Music] how many souls have been his [Music] but god has promised us today his overcoming power amen oh greater is he in me greater is [Music] and baptize all of them with a power greater than corona or earthly foe i'm so glad i've got it too i wanna let the whole world know that greater [Music] greater or greater greater greater is he oh than he that

stand together amen let's get our bibles out let's go right into the word of the lord tonight thank god and thank god mr lanny wolf anybody know lanny wolfe sang that one for years and years and years y'all need to get educated on good music amen hallelujah got your bible joshua chapter one verse one you love the lord amen well we're going to have to make up for about well each one of us are probably going to have to make up about three amen so you're going to have to work a little harder tonight i think but anyhow all right say uh excuse me not saint john john open here but joshua chapter 1 and then i want to look at verse 1. the message tonight titled no shortcuts to adoption no shortcuts to adoption now after the death of moses the servant of the lord it came to pass that the lord spake unto joshua the son of nun moses ministers saying moses my servant is dead now therefore arise and go over this jordan thou and all this people unto the land which i do give them even to the children of israel every place that the soul of your foot shall tread upon that i have given unto you as i said unto moses from the wilderness and this lebanon even unto the great river the river euphrates all the land of the hittites and unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun shall be your coast there shall not be any man able to stand before thee all the days of thy life my wish they would have believed this prophecy but like it is today people hear the lord speak and they sometimes believe it sometimes they don't amen it doesn't change a word though it makes the word the same the word ain't no it don't change no matter who believes it or who don't believe it god said let there be light the sun gets up every morning and in spite of whoever says there's no god the sun still gets up that unbelief has never hindered the lord jesus christ that's right amen and as i was with moses so i will be with thee i will not fail thee nor forsake thee be strong and of good courage unto this people shalt thou divide for inheritance the land which i swear unto their unto their fathers to give them let's pray over the word if you don't mind us bower heads for just a moment heavenly father what a privilege it is lord jesus to be back here in the house of god lord as we are standing here with our heads bowed to the dust from whence we've come lord we realize that human beings are inferior lord we are finite we're weak oh god and there's many attributes in our flesh lord we could never take none of this that we pack around with us 24 hours a day seven days we can ever expect it to manifest the word of god but lord how thankful i am tonight greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world and now lord as we open up the pages of the bible once again we have no ability to do anything with this word of god except for you come and take this little piece of clay use it to speak to the people of god lord you see my frailties you see my weaknesses i am in your hands tonight my father like clay use me anoint me mold me that i might be able to speak to this audience the things that need to be said then lord for those that will be streaming and those that will be listening to the message at some point lord they'll go back and pull it up on youtube wherever where they might get it but lord i pray not a blessing for just the visible but for the invisible that you'll anoint every person that their ears that will hear this message anointing that they might be able to receive for father we want the words tonight to be a blessing to the people of god granted lord in the name of jesus christ as we commit the word tonight and the entire weekend to thy hands both speaker and listener in jesus christ's name and all the saints said amen you gotta say it a couple times because you got to make up for amen amen amen amen so you got to get it out there all right you may be seated may the lord bless you troy it's a little hard to hear up there can i can we turn one of these speakers just a little bit this one right here can you angle that a little bit toward me just a piece i uh i appreciate that oh now i can hear me hallelujah i i um i appreciate it very much yeah very good yeah that works that works nicely thank you sir thank you very much now i i want to try if the lord will help us to i know this is going to sound odd in a way but what i want to do is i just want to take this picture right here of what we're hearing in the writings of joshua and i want to try to show you the way the lord expects us to look at the hour that we're living first of all i want you to understand that when he wrote this in the book of joshua when he started out with this after the death of moses then he says in verse 2 moses my servant is dead joshua is not writing this to be mean to be disrespectful to place any negative light upon the messenger or what the messenger meant to the people in any way whatsoever but what you are listening to and what you are reading in there is you are reading a call to the people of israel to wake up and recognize the dispensation of time that god was calling them to amen are you with me now i want you to realize that when he announces that the servant of god has passed from this life he's dead he's gone he's not coming back the purpose of announcing that to the people was because now the administration change between moses and joshua was going to bring forth a new revelation amen not so much a new revelation different from what had already been said but a further understanding of what god intended when he sent moses in the first place amen and there was an intention there was a purpose and there was a reason that god brought the children of israel out of egypt and brother it wasn't so they could run around the mountain saying moses said moses said moses said amen or walk around and talk about what great things the prophet done and all the great things that he come and said and everything that he did and oh that great prophet of god oh and how he done this and oh how he done that but the administration changed what's going to take the children of israel from being a group of spectators and now usher them into an hour to where god was asking them to be participators hallelujah somebody say amen now now notice when when joshua steps on the scene he's nowhere near the caliber of man that moses was as far as the outside demonstrations remember that when god calls moses in the very beginning moses was a man that ran from the presence of the lord he didn't want to do the job in the first place after he messed up with the egyptian out there he figured this is all she wrote i'm going to take my ball and go home hallelujah he had enough so he went to the back side of the desert he goes around brother isaac there for 40 years until he meets the pillar of fire hanging in that bush out there and then the fire comes off that bush goes inside of moses and moses marches down to egypt and announces i'm here to take over let my people go thus saith the lord let my people go quite a declaration i mean here's a man walking in with a bald head 80 years old with a beard hanging down to his belly button amen with a high-tempered wife and a little prophet hanging around him and he throws a crooked stick on the ground could you imagine somebody walking into donald trump's office right now hey i just want to let you know you're not running the show anymore we're here to take over i mean it was amazing to think that one man could be given such a commission before god and yet moses as he stood out there before the people he was god and aaron was the prophet and as god always does he speaks through his prophets and aaron does the talking for moses remember his words at the burning bush i can't talk because moses was a stuttering man amen amen but he said who made man he made who made his tongue who formed him in fashion him in the secret parts amen god was the designer and god was the creator and god was going to give him a tongue his name was aaron his name was aaron aaron steps before the people he announces to them as he throws the serpent down now of course we realize the rest of the story pharaoh of course with the hardness of his heart he begins to fight against this word of the lord now i want you to remember that when moses then steps out the second time notice not one member of the children of israel not one member of that family not one of them ever stepped out with a stick in their hand that's right don't you listen to me now not one of them stepped out and said let my people go they were all spectators watching the prophet manifest his ministry watching the prophet get thus saith the lord watching the prophet receive the revelation not one of them stepped out they were spectators brother brooks and as they stepped out before the prophet of god amen they said what are you getting us into i imagine if you could have heard some of the conversations around the dinner table we did this man is going to kill us they're going to come against us they're going to take us out we are done we are through i imagine it's probably way some people feel about coronavirus or some of these other things the world council of church i'm amazed i stand amazed at how many message people i hear as of late oh we're going to take a chip in our hand and they're going to get us the mark of the beast and on and on and on brother if we don't know any more about our bible than that we need to go back and get saved the mark of the beast is not a tattoo it is not a chip in your hand the marking of the beast is a rejection of the holy ghost once you reject the baptism you're through but i imagine they had their pressures about like we do today somehow maybe mama got done cooking a lamb and she sat down you know and and and maybe they sat down to eat a little bit and as they started talking around the dinner table maybe papa would say pass me some mashed taters he was from tennessee you understand and maybe he was sitting there and eating and then maybe somebody would say in the silence maybe the pressure would break and somebody would speak up and say what do you think about this moses fella oh i remember him i remember when he come out here 40 years ago i was a young boy like you one day he said one time in my life i watched him go out there and try the same old stunt and all he had to prove for it was one dead egyptian i don't believe anything he's got to say as a matter of fact i think he's a false prophet because you know he told us some things that was supposed to happen and i wasn't able to see it myself but i'm told that when he went out on a mountain a certain place he wasn't actually there maybe somebody would say well i'm told you know that his birth date ain't exactly what they said it was i i've heard a lot of things you see you've got to be careful with the old grapevine because little foxes can spoil that grapevine thank you lord now you realize that when moses then steps out no matter what the people might have thought about him god was not incorporating the people's participation at this time as a matter of fact the only one given the commission was moses and aaron nobody else was involved in the work of the lord and when moses steps out there and says all right pharaoh what about it pharaoh looks at him and says you're crazy you think for a second i'm going to let you walk out of here with 2 million of these people you'll form an army and you'll take us over you said you've already lost the war we're done taking over we're coming out of here so he said well oh let's let's see about that then of course you know the story janice and jammers throw down their serpents and they eat him up they're making fun and uh and they're crawling around and what more and making fun and then aaron's rod eats them up at this time notice not one member of the children of israel walked out there to say not one word they're spectators at this time all they've done is watched the prophet perform great miracles all they've done is watch the holy ghost do great things through the ministry of the hour they've never not not done one thing themselves then of course he goes through the plagues the fleas come lice pestilence moses creates flies me and him i'm gonna have a talk about that thing when i get over yonder i hate a fly cockroach with wings on it's what it is it creates all of these things you realize they didn't even know what to call it they never saw a fly in their life moses takes that stick and says let there be flies i imagine he didn't have the blueprint in his mind he just spoke the word and god created right through his lips and notice not one israelite come out of their hut to say let me help you at this time in the journey of god's people they're spectators all they've done is watched all they've done is paid attention to the prophet all they've done is followed his moves maybe after a period of time they'd started putting some of his works down in a book and they'd sit at the dinner table some of the ones were beginning to catch on a little bit no this might be god after all maybe jehovah's in our midst maybe some would read you know what i heard him say the other day i heard him say let there be lies he said it on page four volume six notice at this particular time not one of them spoke the word by creative thus saith the lord they're spectators all they've done is follow the moves of the leader of the hour oh i hope somebody hear me tonight now i want you to realize that now they're moving into an exodus where god is going to take them into great temptation remember last month when i was here and i told you god had sent evil angels among the temptum right he sent them in there for the purpose of tempting them to deny what god was doing why would god send in such a plague because you realize sometimes when god shakes things up it's because he's trying to shake some things out both positive and negative amen just because you go bankrupt doesn't mean that god ain't got your back just because your business failed or your ventures failed or your purposes failed doesn't mean god don't have your back when one door closes another one opens up god was proving his people they come to the border and they're standing there and there's 10 line preachers we cannot take this land it is impossible for us to go out there and beat them big anax that word a-9 means long neck and they went out there and took a look at them giants out there and they said there is no way of course they believe that up to this time they've been nothing but spectators they've never handled the word themselves they don't know what it means to go out there and take their land every foot place and step out and say it's mine but you know there's a whole different breed of people caleb and joshua they're humans like the rest of them got two legs two arms two eyes got a heart got a mind got thoughts and yet when they walked out there oh caleb walked out there he was looking past the anax at that mountain that he'd been looking at for the last 20 years what was it he was of a different caliber that he was not contented listen with being a spectator he wanted to be a participator oh god give me a man give me a woman give me a preacher give me a boy that is willing to take god at his word that is not contented with being just a spectator but some folks are like the rest of the one well i i read it in the bible that's good enough oh no that's spectate religion don't you realize one reason why basketball and football and soccer and these other things are so popular it's what they call spectator sports it is easy for me to sit down in an armchair with a cold pepsi or remember what it is and watching boys running up down that field with that football going man they should have done this man they should have done that let me tell you something if i had a football in my hand i probably couldn't throw it from there to the back door i'm a musician not an athlete i'm going to tell you it's easy for me to sit there and spectate to be on the field with them grizzly bears them guys on that line maybe 4 400 450 everyone there are are you kidding me i'd be mashed taters before the night was over come on now praise the lord you might be little but you can make some noise a firecracker does praise the lord that's right now i want you to notice that when they go into this this place where god is trying to give them an opportunity to possess oh god that's what the message has done for you and i it is god giving us an opportunity to possess what the bible spoke of in the last days to be able to as paul said lay hold on eternal life not just watch it not just look at it lay hold on it possess it tired of being a spectator i want to be a participator i'm going to say something this is going to sound ugly but it is what it is the majority of the problems that we have in this message do not come from a lacking of holy ghost huh god's god just right now as he ever was you nudge your head this way uh-huh the holy ghost is just a holy ghost same as he's always been right the bible is still as powerful the message is still the truth the angels of god are still around us right god got gifted men to preach to us gifted musicians to sing and play is happy right the holy ghost church has not diminished in the gifts and what god has given to it there are still nine spiritual gifts we can tap into and if it only falls on me tonight i can prophesy to you you could speak in tongues and interpret to lay hands on sick folk cast out devils all of that is still in the body of jesus christ but let me tell you what the problem with people in this message are i mean it's critical now i mean it's truthful we've become spectators and not participators we've allowed ourselves to be lulled into a sleep where we can talk about the message talk about the bible talk about the powers of god come on now amen but when it comes to actually manifesting we've become spectators that's one reason why people like to see the preacher do it you know it ain't always the preacher's obligation to make the word live of course he should but i mean it's not always on him huh now what about some of y'all we got one sister in this room tonight and i know how people behave well she's just a woman i got news for you brother branham said that little lady back there could operate all nine spiritual gifts y'all say say what he said i am you ain't amen and too loud she can do everything spiritual there is except for preach and hold an office in the church well praise the lord but you know we've devalued women in this message they're nothing but baby makers and pie makers that's about all they're good for that's not true a woman has the ability to tap into supernatural things and she can be a great instrument for the for the work of the lord she's just not allowed to preach i mean people call us women haters because the way we make them dress and all that kind of stuff i said that's where you're messed up at that's where you've messed your mind up we don't make real sisters do nothing i don't make a woman do nothing i don't make my wife or my girls dress the way they dress i don't i tell them exactly what the bible said i tell them what brother branham said and i tell them the way that we're dressing is this godly this is holy now mind you as long as my girls are young i'm not going to allow them to dress immoral without nothing like that but you can ask my babies they wear dresses because this is what's right to do you train up a child and the way they go they'll do the right thing right you tell them how the bible works you tell them how supernatural things work sure can be a great tool for the kingdom of god a woman can be powerful matter of fact philip had what was it eight dollars i think it was or seven dollars something like that and they were all prophetesses people haul a prophet prophet prophet but what about these prophetesses down there prophesying the power of god look at lydia the seller of purple a lot of men didn't make it in the bible but there's lydia sitting there remember when paul finds out about fornication it was reported to him from the house of chloe that's a woman amen who was it around jesus that had the greatest testimonies mary magdalene mary the mother of jesus all these different women that surrounded a woman has a great role in the body of christ absolutely but what we've done if we're not careful is we've regulated the people down to being nothing but spectators well you believe the message don't you you believe the prophet don't you well sure then people in israel could have said the same thing sure i was looking at it that day whenever the rivers turned to blood sure i believe that was god's prophet done that amen come on shall i believe that he was able to speak that pestilence out there i watched it when the death angel passed through we stood in the doorway under the blood and watched the death angel pass through the city the screams going out in the middle of the night but up to that time they were no more than spectators all they had done was just watched from a distance sure but notice oh my now god is trying to take the people into a place let's get out of egypt they did huh now he's trying to take them into a place brother isaac where now god is going to ask them you go get it amen don't don't you understand the change in brother branham's ministry he didn't even understand it himself really listen to his own words he's still looking for this to happen and that happened that to happen he didn't even understand himself what was necessarily happening in his ministry watch him been ashamed to him he comes all the way down almost to the last four five or six months over what it was i think it was in july if i remember correctly and ashamed of him he's coming right down to the last months of his life and brother adam's talking about getting a tent in a ballpark so they could have a great revival great healing revival you see god don't show his prophets everything brother branham has brought us a message he's brought us thus saith the lord he's brought us the truth of the hour and we believe it but even brother branham himself didn't understand the changing of the ministry moses my servant is dead now you you don't you be a spectator no more now you got to be a participator you go to this jordan and you possess oh and that's where the grumbling started because when people crossed over that jordan river which meant death which is where they should have died they should have died to themselves died to their ideas died to their thoughts yielded themselves to jehovah and said all right lord whatever you want me to do i'm here out of two million people two million spectators had two participators in the whole thing joshua and caleb oh you say well that ain't right yes it is jesus said every single one of them were dead separated from god not that they're dead in their body dead in their heart they had no inspiration to do anything else but watch the prophet now don't you listen when the two million people watched him do it they were strong they had big revivals they were having meetings with people setting chairs out all outside standing in line standing in the rain getting up early in the morning trying to find parking spaces but now it's time for them to participate and the revivals ain't as big as they used to be i hope you're spiritual now listen unto me the revival seemingly is dying down they don't see the people when they go to possess they're not seeing the great pestilences and plagues and darkness and angels of death and on and on and on but to prove to the people god was still with him joshua goes down there and his memories got to cross jericho before he can get to the promised land that's exactly the same place that you and i come to before we can possess we've got to beat jericho hallelujah and that is where our victory comes remember when joshua got down there amen god was going to prove as i was with moses remember joshua marches around him walls seven times i wonder then people probably thought what in the world are we doing amen now they've moved remember in egypt they didn't have to pay tithes in egypt they didn't have to give offerings in egypt they didn't have a way or a system of worship in egypt they didn't have deacons they didn't have trustees they didn't have to go to church on regular days but now joshua stands up and starts marching you can almost hear them children of israel now going around that wall what does he mean be here tonight and then again sunday and then again wednesday what's he talking about got to pay a tenth of my money what does he mean i gotta love my enemy what's he talking about oh god why are we doing this where's moses god remind him right in the word he's dead but just to prove that god was with him when they shouted on the seventh day jericho flattened out god didn't do that to prove anything else except to show that he was with joshua now when they start the campaigns over there watch and see this is where the trouble comes you never ever hear of an aiken when moses was alive when moses was on the scene there was no babylonian garments there was no gold wedges but now the administration has changed over to god and now now there's an entirely different focus on what the church which is what israel was the called out the church was what church means the church had a completely different focus all together people wonder friends they look at this message and they look at it through scandalous eyes anything well brother brother branham was alive we didn't have all this trash we just didn't see it because the focus was on moses hey listen you reckon the brother man was alive today and down there at the tabernacle of him 110 years old and he was discerning heart you reckon i'd be sitting here right now come on somebody i'd be down there watching what that prophet had to say i would be like elisha where you go i'll go amen but now they don't have a prophet to watch and now the focus is going to change to what to them no wonder the lord inspired by the brand to preach what is the attraction on the mount and he tells us if when john showed up or when jesus showed up come to john he said the prophet changed from the prophet to the prophecy that's exactly what happened on sunset mountain the prophecy changed from brother bradham and now the focus is going to be on us and what do you find when a spotlight is put upon the church aikens babylonian garments gold wedges sin in the camp friends it's not an abnormal thing to go amongst message people and find all kinds of filth and trash if brother branham was here we wouldn't pay attention to it but because moses my servant is dead now we're looking in a different view now we see things through different eyes no wonder many of those people got so discouraged well i i was conducting a a a research study and i was asking in my research about the older brothers you know the baby boomers and the difference between them and the millennials you know the younger men the younger myself i'm not a millennial i'm a generation xr i was born in the 70s so i come up on a different scale some of you boys are millennials you know maybe in that that range and i was asking some of them older brothers of course i didn't know who they were it was an atomic an anonymous thing and i made the statement i said do you think that education and technology is a good thing in the church and almost unanimously all of them that answered they said now it's of the devil and them younger boys were saying but i think it's all right now the point i'm trying to make to you is the ideas of what some of the older brother and i had they were looking at it through a lens of their generation they saw things in a different perspective they wasn't raised with facebook they wasn't raised with instagram they wasn't ray's tweeting along the only tweeting they did is when they went working in the garden with a hoe or listen to the birds tweet maybe that might have been the thing so to them because there's a gap in there because their view and their experiences are different they relate what they think based on their own personal experiences well of course it's easy for people to stand up and follow brother branham and say oh that prophet let me tell you he walked in a room and knew who everybody was and of course we're supposed to oh oh wow and i love to hear those stories don't get me wrong but i will not be in awe of a dead man when god is calling me to be a participator amen praise the lord moses my servant is dead we need to leave him in the grave where he belongs friends i said where he belongs god put him there so he must belong there if brethren belonged in the pulpit right now he'd be in the pulpit but he's where he belongs god laid him to rest because that's what god wanted listen to me now oh you say but brother ben there's no way in the world we can take our eyes off that messenger then why did god put moses in the grave he hit him so well that even the angels in michael hadn't been disputing there'd been an argument where is he at where is he at where's the body of moses anyways they'll find him one day he'll come popping out of the shadows his camouflage will be removed but you recognize that now because their vision must change oh god listen to me they've got to look at their lives differently not through the lens of what moses did moses said moses acted but now they've got to change from being spectators and now they've become participators listen to this in a message brother man preaches here he must be born again he said now shortcuts he said tonight he said they're out here in other words in the world he said then tomorrow they come in they want to preach he said pentecostal people letting them do it he said yeah they want a shortcut to heaven hallelujah all i have to do is get down here and don't think of nothing on say hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah some got elijah's garment on tomorrow they're going to cast out devils hallelujah hallelujah i got it praise god here i go they want a shortcut to heaven taking as much of the world as they can take but you can't take any of it there's no shortcuts you come the way of calvary you come the way of the brazen altar you come the way of the brazen serpent he said you die you actually die so god why can i say it right you literally die to yourself the things of the world and you're born anew but they want to come quickly oh listen to me they don't want to grow we grow in the lord and it takes growth and experience now listen to me they had no growth they had no experience while they were standing there watching moses with that crooked stick turn the waters in the blood they had no experience no growth whenever he walked out there and he called the firstborn to death he tells them the only action they ever actually performed was at the very last hour when he tells him to paint the door and take the lamb and eat it and put your staff in your hand and girdle yourself up that's that's as close as any of them had come to participating in anything and even then they were only doing what they were told anybody can follow a rule i i um i i teach chinese kids overseas to speak english and they have these interactive slides matter of fact i got several classes in the morning and um they they've learned they can't say the word a bit more than i could speak japanese or chinese but they've learned to take that word because it looks a certain way and it belongs there i thought to myself the other day i thought that's about what message people have done that quote belongs there and that quote belongs there and that date belongs there and that statement belongs there but as far as being able to interpret the word for their own benefit they can't do it why they become spectators oh god somebody hear me tonight they have watched brother branham do they have watched the holy ghost perform but they have no experience for themselves so you when you read about casting out devils they go amen that's right praise the lord we really like laying hands on the sick yes i believe that when's the last time you done it oh you say that that that ain't my job really when's the last time that you just walked up to somebody had an evil spirit on them and so i take every spirit in here under my control for the glory of god oh you say you can't do that it's because you're a spectator but when you're a participator all things are possible amen glory to god all things a-l-l means all right but they want shortcuts well you know i don't have to get saved my mommy and daddy's got the token over me and i make it in because mommy and daddy are believing for me hey i don't doubt what the bible said about claim your your uh your your family and your youngans and mothers and fathers and ever who ever who just just pull one out and put another one in every who you're claiming i believe what the bible said about that but where in the world have we come to the spot how in the world did we come to the spot to where in order to get people to heaven we choose a shortcut rather than crossing jericho going over jordan and possessing because god said i'm going to give you the land and every place the soul of your foot steps on i'll give it to you try chores maybe maybe you go to church that night and go hallelujah but then you look over the promised land you look over that border down there kadesh that is mine with all them hittites in there with all them jebusites you mean with all these genetics that my mom and dad passed out of me that temper that impatience all that glory to god yes it's all yours but you've got to possess it by participation not expectation i know i get it i i know folks that probably hear this they'll probably say oh brother ben oh oh boy you've blasphemed you mean get away from brother branham in a sense i do how in the world do we ever go and possess what is ours and have growth and experience if we're not willing to allow brother brown and be a part of the history that made who you and i are who you and i are i don't discount him i don't discredit him i don't ignore him but brother branham is a part of my history brother branham is not a part of my future or my present he is a part of my history the bible did not say that william branham was the same yesterday today and forever said jesus was the same yesterday today and forever moses was a part of egypt's history or israel's history moses was a historical monument of what god could do for a people that really didn't even deserve what god was doing for him hey listen none of us deserve the grace of god none of us deserved it none of us earned it none of us can work hard enough to keep it right it's given to us by god's grace god's mercy and nothing else thank god he chose me to be a part of that but moses was a part of their history moses was not a part of their future moses was not a part of their presence we glory to god and hallelujah don't you think now why would he tell him moses is dead i reckon they didn't know the man ain't been seen in months not heard hiding her hair of where he's been he goes up into the mountain and all of a sudden disappears oh i imagine some of them messaged people were probably finally missing a person's reports all over the place trying to get the local authorities as it was find out that prophet search him up where is he at because they depended upon that as part of their walk with god i mean what is he telling him this for moses is dead i wonder if someone want to sit there and say i know that why is that significant at all god was announcing to them this is the turning of a corner all those times that god come down there and cast all these plagues and things on the egyptians now it's your turn to call for what's your rightful property and just like today like everybody else does they said well i i i believe what the bible said you know when it said call for the elders of the church and the prayer of faith will save the sick i believe that but you know i just feel so bad but you know if brother branham was here anybody ever thought that in your lifetime i have i've been in situations where i thought to myself if he could just show up in a dream and discern my problem if i could just get him in a vision come on somebody if he could just show up somehow supernaturally just tell me what's wrong with me problem is i already know what's wrong with me i just don't want to admit it come on somebody but don't you understand we crave for that singularity of leadership we want a man to come and demonstrate to us that god can do it because we've got spectator religion we like to watch it but we don't want to enforce it god help us lord praise the lord they want a shortcut oh well don't worry about things you know it'll be all right brother bam will come back here and straighten us out one day i got news for him boy they wouldn't want that prophet of god back here any day of the week oh goodness sake's alive no man they wouldn't want that prophet step up his platform tonight amen give him a worldwide platform god would blow out those walls of that internet and the whole world would hear a message for us over with he'd tear them apart for all of their loose living and their laziness and their lack of faith and what they've done with the precious truth of the bible and how they provided for merchandise and doing their own thing and it says moses is dead maybe somebody will wake up that morning and go did you read this what in the world is that crazy guy trying to tell us moses is dead we know he's dead what's that got to do with anything oh then they read the words now you arise maybe they're going to supper again that night you know and what do you think about that grandma i'm my memory on that prophet glory to god whenever he spoke that testlets hallelujah i was in that meeting in shreveport but now god is saying that's good that was good for its time but now it's your turn praise the lord words amen in case some of y'all forgot it god is asking them now to apply their own faith to what he's demonstrated do you understand he has exhibited the greatest powers of god before these people it don't get any better than watching the egypt of the red sea open right up in front of your face and then watch god take that very same water and drown every one of your enemies in it that should have been enough for them don't you understand why they went into the wilderness angry because they were spectators truth be told many of them never wanted to leave in the first place oh you know it's the same as it is today societal pressure pressures from family i'm convinced that one reason young people have a tendency to serve the message until they get 18 is because just like those egyptians and those israelites they've been forced to do a certain thing you live in my house this is my rules and you're going to follow what we follow but they never chose it they come along because of pressure they do what they can because of pressure and you know when they backslide we think well they must have went so far were they really that far in their hearts they might have been closer to it than what you realize it was i mean here god takes them out in the middle of nowhere and he starts feeding them water out of a rock he blows quail in manna and yet they're still going what the god i had some of them leeks and them garlics in egypt why didn't you bring us out here to die i could almost see almighty god rubbing his hands together going yep just keep running that mouth of yours because you are only proving that you're nothing but a spectator you realize god moved two million people because there was two saints in it god made a national a national move over two people what do you think he would do in this world if there were 700 believers on this planet right now he would turn this world upside down for 700 believers if there were seven in it and he did turn the world upside down in the days of noah there were only eight and some of them were just coming along for the ride yeah i know it's preached it for 120 years yesterday he's family i guess i gotta go shortcuts well and you understand god is trying to give these people a proper positioning to where that when you see moses goes out of the world of legend in all intents and purposes and by definition moses went out of legend you don't think he was we talk about him today six thousand years later every how many years we're still talking about the great acts of that great deliverer of moses the man is a legend in bible lore and god wanted this nation of people this church to go in there and make their own testimonies to make their own reputations to make their own victories and to be able to place possess and dispossess anything that god laid before him and instead of doing that they stood at the border and they went hey listen i ain't silly i know how some of y'all probably behave and i'm talking to those that ain't here too whenever they hear brother isaiah stand up here in that great heart of faith that god's given our brother and he starts testifying to the powers of god and some of you all sit there and go whoo that's right pastor oh glory to god hallelujah that's right you're a spectator until the holy ghost moves on you and you can possess the same faith all you're doing is spectating have you ever noticed how a church house looks a lot like a movie theater i know some of y'all ain't never been in no movie theater but you ever notice how it's set up where there's a focal point now god intended it for that way remember what peter said when he come to the man the gay people look on us god wants you to make a contact like oral roberts said contact pay attention watch and so forth like that god made a focal point so that you could hear and receive understanding from the word but if we ain't careful the church has become like a movie theater people come to watch the show and if a pastor or an evangelist or a teacher whatever he might be if he's a good orator he can demonstrate and he can you know show off his oratory skills if he's interesting somebody comes with their power points and everything listen i ain't got nothing wrong with your powerpoint just bring your power with your point come on that's all right if they've got the holy ghost in it but if we ain't careful what happens is the church becomes like a movie house the lights are turned down low and everybody just gets ready to watch the show the church of god was never intended to be a movie house you understand my parable it was intended for you to come to receive instruction of how to go back out there in that filthy old world satan's eden and possess what god laid before you that's what god wanted you to do with the message the message wasn't placed in our hand and the degree that has been placed in our hand and the magnitude of things that's been placed before us for the sake of just saying well that's what moses done didn't he well i remember when he preached such and such a sermon they've got these things memorized so well they can tell you how many times moses breathed in between words let my two breaths people go they've got it memorized down and they can tell you how many times his eyes blinked spectators never participators now watch oh my thank you jesus listen to this paragraph 147 again he says now they've got elijah's garments he said and so on and so forth he said they've got manifested sons of god he said yeah god's getting manifested sons now he said but tonight you're a sinner and tomorrow you're a manifested son of god you know what he said nonsense i know i know it's time to stop preaching i hear you i hear you nonsense he says where do you get that in the word listen babies are not born men babies are born to grow to men amen oh glory and what does a baby do when it's little spectates mama feeds it mom addresses it mama shows it how to walk mama tells it how to talk mama shows it when to sleep mama shows it when to wake up but then after a period of time mama says set your own alarm am i getting you up praise the lord could you imagine a great big strong boy like his brother right here sitting down at the table tonight we maybe go burger king we'll say maybe he gets it one of them big old double whoppers with extra cheese on it or goes to wendy's and gets one of them triple burgers troy there's cheese all over the place and that steam coming up off that paper you know what i mean and his mama come over here and say hold on honey she starts cutting the little bitsy pieces up now open up the hanger here comes the airplane some of you brothers would be tweeting and instagramming and facebooking he would go viral in the message before nightfall and the caption would read grown man cannot even feed himself his own triple burger mommy has to feed him now brother we laugh it's ridiculous and that's funny but how many times does god look right down on you and i and see the same behaviors in the church of the living god he manifests the power before us he shows us how to get there and then we are still sitting in the church like feed me mommy feed me mommy you are 98 years old you are 430 pounds you can feed just half but we can't do it we can't do it mama we can't do it oh oh i'm in trouble oh brother i said brother and brother i said don't answer his phone oh god in the name of jesus inspire that man of god to answer his telephone but instead of taking your faith remind you i'm preaching to these folks here too instead taking your faith and saying i appreciate my pastor i appreciate his faith but god i'm calling you on the scene myself sometimes the phone call we need to make ain't to the pastor come on somebody sometimes the call we need to make is a call ahead to say almighty god i am believing your word but as it is with every move of god you have a class of spectators you have a class of participators now listen to this in revelation chapter 2 verse 7 the bible said to him that over cometh now you know what's interesting about this scripture when you read the church age book and you listen at what he says about he singular he that hath an ear let him hear you realize that he doesn't respond to everybody that he is the messenger of the age he hears what god says he delivers it to the people but isn't it interesting that when he the messenger hears what god says then the very next line is to him that's no longer the messenger just he didn't say they now but he said to him that overcome it did you ever notice that singular there you know why god is allowing you to put yourself in succession to he that heard now him that overcomes which one do you want to choose you want to spectate both or you want to find your place because remember there's no shortcuts to adoption god was not going to take moses and let him plow right through a canaan land and drive out the hittites and take his stick and drive out the jebusites and send flies and pestilences on those anax no god said you want to be adopted you want your position all right do you want your place him that overcomes i want to be one of the hymns amen that's me he's talking about to him that's me now you can read your name there just like i can mine i want to be one of them ones that overcomes don't you amen well if he hears the message and the message is delivered to me then i become a hymn i find my position amen but to get there i've got to overcome and did you notice he said overcometh in a way of saying it exactly it's not just the once but it's over and over and over again because real overcoming power does not come in just beating it once you have to every single day of your life you're going to have to get up put your sword in your hand put your shoes on your feet and start walking my brother-in-law i laugh at him not making fun of him but he tickles me sometimes and uh tickles that's a southern word for makes me laugh and uh he bought some property and he had people coming on all sides of that property and so forth like that people that was used to walking around there and he didn't know who was who and he'd get up crack it on you know for work he'd have his shotgun in his hand he'd go from one corner of it to another he gonna run poachers off he's gonna run anybody gets on his property you know and he'd go from one side go to another go to another go to another go to another then he'd go on to work you know he'd come home as soon as he'd get home before the sun went down you know he'd start walking and and and i laughed at him i said you ain't found nothing yet i said who in the world gonna be crazy enough to see you coming with a shotgun and stay around they're going to run out of there he goes that's the point and i thought oh god let that message sing through to me i may never meet one devil in my lifetime i may never have to fight not one spirit not cast out one devil not be able to lay hand on nobody about being sick but if i can just get my sword in my hand my shoes on my feet and start walking come on somebody the devil sees me coming if he's smart he don't stick around praise heart because that's what being a participator looks like brothers listen to me saints listen to me coming to church is not a participation or a spectated sport this is the reason why we come to the house of god don't just sit there and look participate in some way people tell me all the time that's all you want when you come to church somebody said hallelujah somebody said glory to god i said what do you think we're supposed to do in church i said well it offends me you ask if he come out on somebody i said it offends me that you won't come on amen because this house is a house of participation not a house of spectation but the curtain draws for some people and the lights turn down low and they got their popcorn in their hand and they're ready for the movie tell me something man of god teach me something all right first thing i'm going to teach you is get that popcorn out of your hand get a sword in it next thing i'm going to tell you is uncross them feet and put your square your shoulders back and stand up straight and act like you're in a man's army because it makes you wonder sometimes the way people are when they read the message you know they read the message from this view well you know the prophet did and the prophet said and well that's wonderful thank god for everything brother man did remember brother branham is a part of my history and that history is what makes me what i am today but brother branham is not a part of my present nor my future amen moses my servant is dead time to come out of the spectator booth time to start participating let's stand thank you jesus yes alarm clock i know i'm supposed to stop preaching i get it now you know last time i was here i didn't even set the clock because i went i didn't care about the time i had a lot to say i wanted to say it but being that we got service tomorrow and on and on i don't know where you had either but you get the point of it now what i want to do now because i realize i'm preaching to believers here but look back in your life how many times has failure been the result of just being a spectator just just think of that how many times has failure come right to your doorstep simply because you've been a spectator not been a participator i know this is hard for us to receive and i hope these folks listening out there i hope when they get this message that they'll ask themselves these same questions why do you think god allowed that sickness to come to your door why do you think god allowed the other things to come troubles problems difficulties why do you think that showed up how do you think god let that head tight through the game why do you think he allowed that jebusite to show up at work all the places in the world i've been there i was at a certain place and and and and and had all kinds of little troubles problems and things you know how it goes a regular run of things in church and and i was able to finally get free went to another place as soon as i got there here come jebusites i like god i can't even get loose anywhere i go i go to a meeting i'm getting ready to preach somewhere with isaiah and i think glory to god we're going to get in the anointing and the power of god's going to fall hittite's sitting on the front row you understand what i mean you can't escape it why do you think they're there thank because god is trying to force you to come out of that spectator's box and start participating with the word to make a decision i am going to fight come what may amen i want to say something to you friends but isaiah can say amen to this we've served the lord since we were boys preached since we were kids nearly i have brother brooks started young like i did we've given our life for this gospel the further we go down in time or the troy the more we see people falling here falling there you know why they've seen the movies so many times they're tired of watching it you understand me people don't watch old movies anymore you know why you know why that in hollywood they'll tell you that so there's a population of people that love old movies but you know hollywood don't put out a remake of a movie in black and white they've got new technology they'll put out a transformer or some kind of robot or something fella like that don't look at me so holy you know what i'm talking about you're around the same stuff i am they'll put out some little thing and why do you think they try to get the most powerful visual images they can because they know that people have just about seen everything there is to see and if they want them to come see the movie they've got to do something for them that's never been done before because that is the nature of a true spectator you must constantly listen keep them entertained or they won't stick around that is why i feel like we have made such a discredit to the church of god by making ourselves lean and cater to spectators so when we preach the gospel brother isaiah we preach it in a way that maybe spectators would be blessed and then the next time they see you preach they're not as enthused with you because you've got the same old message you've got the same old delivery the same old type of thing and you're nothing new to it well you know anymore they got to come out and the ties have got to be wilder and the colors have got to be bigger and they've got to kick their leg two inches higher than it did last time come on church come on somebody why because we're trying to appease spectators but the real church of the living god don't come for a show they come to participate god help me know what my next steps in life are i've learned hey listen confession good for the soul right i've learned through the years listen preachers are actors sometimes we put on a little thing do we we'd be sick as a dog you know we come to the platform smiling we don't feel like smiling saying that right now we do it for the benefit of the people there's a difference in trying to demonstrate and behave in a manner that you're giving your best to the people of god that they can enjoy the word but there's a line there that is often crossed too many times and so instead of the preacher just bringing the word and that being enough for the people he's got to have a good joke he's got to tell him the story to make him cry he's got to tell him a story to make him smile he's got to inspire them with a quote for the day god help us we become nothing but a bunch of spectators and when a man preaches or a man sings or woman sings or ever what it is then in order for them to capture the attention of the people and i know this i'm a musician my wife and i sing all over the world we go places and sing an old song like when the saints go marching in you know how people respond they just look at you you know and i know what they're thinking i'm not stupid i know exactly what they're thinking they're thinking the same thing i thought i've heard that song 10 million times saying something fresh huh sometimes and listen there's nothing wrong with entering into the old songs and entering into old worship don't always have to be that way we can pick fresh stuff and new things and and and things will be a blessing to people but don't you realize the reason some people cannot get into that kind of worship is because they need to be entertained and so if you're not singing the latest hill song or the latest natalie grant or some of these folks like that they don't even want to hear what you've got to say you mean you're going to sing a song they only believe psalm book oh what they're trying to tell you is i've seen that movie enough i got news for you friends i never get tired of hearing the songs i heard tonight fill my way every day with love those different ones that we heard singing tonight those three or four extra you sang because i didn't hear you call me out swing low sweet chariot i i love them old songs but the reason i love them is not because of the song itself but because of what it means to me as a participator amen because i'm looking for one day a chariot to sweep me out of here i believe in amazing grace how sweet but you see when it comes to being participators we have a different vision a different goal and a different endgame in mind than the rest of the world i started to confess to you didn't i i've been those kind of guys in the early days of my ministry listen i wanted the holy ghost to just dumbfound the people that's what i wanted i wanted the power of god to come there and they had false teeth shake their false teeth out of their head right out of the building so i thought maybe if i kicked my leg here maybe that would do it maybe if i held my hands this way or if i gestured that way maybe that would bring it in my innocence and in my ignorance i've done everything i knew how to do to try to bring the holy ghost on the scene one day i was at church and my pastor was preaching at the time and it was one of those services that were a dead thumb anybody ever been in one of those dead thump i mean there wasn't nobody amen and three-fourths of congregation was asleep and i watched brother carol he was preaching preaching preaching preaching preaching and i heard him when i noticed it was kind of he hit that spot where he was struggling and i thought uh oh how's he going to get out of this because i've been in them services many times and i know they're difficult to dig out of and i watched him stand in the middle aisle started quoting scriptures one afternoon as fast as he could get him out of his mouth he was moving so quick he was stumbling over his own tongue within 10 minutes the power of god come into that building before the services out of people were shouting and laying in the floor i went to the the truck and we went to go eat the next day and i was sitting in the front seat up here with him and he was riding down the road and i want to ask you a question he said yeah i said how'd you do that last night it's been many years ago now almost 20 years ago and i asked him this he said ben i learned one thing he said god comes to his word and if you'll bring the people to the word god will come to that word and meet the people there so then the next time i preached of course you know what i did i didn't kick my leg as high i didn't hold my hands that certain way i focused on bringing the word and for 25 years well going on 30 now every time i've come to that platform i've watched the holy spirit come to that word again and again and again and again this is what i'm talking about this is what brother branham called hollywood evangelism i'm not throwing off on our boys today but if we're not careful all we'll have in our pulpits is good one-liners jesus is alive jesus is real brother brown was a prophet the bride is pure the bride is right if they say a good a good amount of one-liners enough to work on the people's emotions people will be going hallelujah glory to god praise the lord but let me tell you something if i stood at that clip that back door back there with a clipboard in my hand after many of those kind of services and i asked those people what did you learn about you tonight what did you learn about yourself what do you need to work on to be a better christian what flaw or what error was illuminated to you tonight so you can see how to serve god in a better way majority of them couldn't even answer you not with two words strung together why because we've sat down in our seats we've put the lights on low we've put our boxes of popcorn in our lap and we're ready to watch the show iowa windsor heights listen to me the holy spirit sent me the message to this little bitty audience tonight and for those that will catch this i got one message for you god is calling us out of the spectation business it's time to participate you young boys don't you get it in your mind that we don't have 40 more years you don't know that don't think in your mind they're into tomorrow for your kids we were saying that 40 years ago we don't know at what hour that jesus may come don't think that your piano playing gifts and your drum playing gifts and all that is of not the things that god's calling you to do there may not be 50 in the future but god's calling you for a purpose stick with that purpose let's pray together heavenly father thank you for your word tonight lord you've allowed me to speak a very very important message to the people tonight and father i pray that its importance will not be undermined that it will not be largest cast aside but that the words that i have spoken here tonight which are not my words are your words let these words fall in the hearts of every believer father from with isaiah and myself brother troy the ministry here and lord on down to brother isaac song leader and musician brothers on through our sister back there in the back those little stream god may we all just step up to the challenge and father if we need to repent for being spectators we do that now and ask you to forgive us lord forgive us for just being spectators help us lord to step out and participate oh what it must have been when them children of israel watched moses walk out there and speak in the creative power of god sent pestilences soaring around my little clinkers of bugs and things probably come out of nowhere it looks like fireworks going off by the people like watching a fireworks show probably ood and all but lord when you brought them to the promised land and you set them on that border over there and they looked across now it was time for them to take their place god they all every single one of them except for joshua and kenneth they wanted a shortcut but god there are no shortcuts and adoption if we want to come this way this is the way we must come help us tonight lord help us is my prayer help me help these believers help us god to put ourself in a in a mindset to change our thinking and lord instead of just reading about it say god i want to enjoy it i want to learn it but i want to enjoy it i want to study it but i want to manifest it i want to read it but i want to see it too but i'll let that be the cry of our heart in jesus name how many feel that way just raise your hands up to the lord will you and just say father tonight i'm tired of being a spectator tired of just looking from the galley looking from the box seats as it was in sports and sitting in the rows and looking from the bleachers or whatever you might think in our mind but lord i want to step out there on the battlefield father i got lost loved ones i got health problems i got this i got that whatever it is lord jesus help me stop being a spectator help me start being a participator granted my lord in the name of jesus christ granted bless every uplifted hand every life in jesus name to god be the glory [Music] to god [Music] be the glory for the things he has done with this yes lord he [Music] he has raised me to for the things you remember when jesus was walking with him he would take speak to a tree or he would take fish and loaves he'd do other things he'd say when he come to the last supper he broke the bread and poured the wine put the water in a basin he said i've done this to show you something even in the ministry of jesus which was the second exodus jesus had such a glory the people spectated but then when it come to the day of pentecost they had to go out of that upper room they had the right idea because when they come out of that upper room how is it we hear every man speaking our own language no longer spectators participators sing it again to [Music] god [Music] he [Music] with his power oh he has raised the glory for us the presence of the lord there is [Music] in the presence of the lord [Music] peace [Music] is [Music] in the presence of [Music] can you say [Music] oh won't you help me worship him tonight [Music] [Music] yes [Music] yes [Music] hallelujah [Music]

god bless you [Music] what a powerful message amen um you know i was thinking and i'm not going to be long because the word of god was just excellent it was wonderful to me you know brother branham can say and they never use that those quotes forget about me it ain't me he'll tell us that all through this through through his his lifetime even in the seals he said forget about me but then you know when you said when a preacher said forget about him then they look at you like you antichrist right amen but what a powerful message it's just right where i'm at brother you you you it's god knew what he was doing i'm telling you this message was of the lord i was just telling the brother i said we're moving in a different direction now and i know this message really it just i can't explain it just lays such a great great great foundation if you i don't know how you say it but i really enjoyed every bit of it participation i love that you know and we all have been exp uh spectators at times it's the truth and we've fed those spectators at times it's nothing but the truth you know but when you brought the theater part i'm like oh god that's so good you know because that's exactly what has come and what has happened i mean just what last week i mean we had so many spectators i'm trying to i hate to say it but i'm trying to pump it up i'm trying to get a little bit of movement yes sir and i did the little different things and it didn't work you know i mean it's the truth you see people and you think why are you not excited i'm excited but anyway wonderful message a wonderful message and and uh you know i i don't know what else to say but also we're going to be having uh i told the sony to do but since i'm up here we're going to have two services with our brother on tomorrow yeah tomorrow morning tomorrow evening amen starting at our regular time those who want to come come those who don't don't want to come don't come you know maybe if you if you want to come as a spectator come on you know maybe you'll start participating amen you know god will do something for you but we love the lord we appreciate everything that's been said and done and you keep preaching like that you're going to get in trouble you're going to get in trouble but listen the bride of jesus christ i i'm going to say something because it's something that's moving on my heart in those seven thunders brother said i couldn't figure it out and understand in the secret catching of a way i'm just going it ain't for this this seven thunders is not for exp uh spectators spectators spectators they're not it's not for them it's for participants all right if you're going to climb this mountain if you're going to be a caleb you can't be a spectator you got to be a participant and when i was thinking about your preaching when you were talking about and i was just i went to jericho you know there was no children in the march that's right they were warriors hallelujah all warriors there were no children in the march around jericho because children would have been able to talk they would have been there you know what i mean they they gave the secret away hallelujah but god called them to participate and i was thinking about jesus christ that's one thing they saw him but one thing jesus did he tried to make them participate but they were they were wanting to spectate gave them power and they still wanted to see jesus they couldn't work it without him and that's what's happening to a lot of people now it's true it's true or true they can't go forward because they're working with brother branham and i don't mean no harm i you know i love my prophet i love my prophet but i refuse to allow the catholic spirit to get me i ain't gonna worship those saints i ain't praying to no saint and i ain't worshipping one y'all understand me anyway come on brother cause i'm be preaching he he left that anointing up here so but i appreciate that brother that was excellent that was wonderful yeah yeah i guess if you get in trouble i get in trouble with you amen praise god amen hallelujah let's sing amen thank god i'm free amen hallelujah amen [Music] amen [Music] for a long time i traveled down a long lonely road my heart was so heavy and then i heard about jesus [Music] what a wonderful hour i'm so glad that i found out he could bring me [Applause]

them but you know what people take that out of context they take it out of context he wasn't talking about that kind of dead he was talking about dead dead and gone and gone all right it's just the same when when um he said uh lazarus is sleeping they didn't understand the language lazarus sleeping all saints sleep hallelujah moses sleepeth but joshua said he's dead because there was a change i like that hallelujah and don't you understand people of god the same the same the same he's the same yesterday today and forever amen when god took the prophet off the scene there is a change he said see those bloody footprints i can't take you i can't take you no father this is where like moses this is where we are we're here you got to follow those footprints so i say just like god had said that so so do they don't understand he says okay lazarus dead so you can understand but i go to wake him right so i love that i love the way the lord word things so we can understand things and i'm telling you saints of god i feel so so sorry i i i i put it this way it may sound crazy but i pity people because they're not catching the vision they don't see how late of time it is yeah you know we may have 50 more years but who's to say you got 50 more years to live you got to do what you need to do now right as though it's going to happen now right but at the same time brother branham said even if i knew he was coming today and i had to plant potatoes i'll still plant my potatoes hallelujah i'm we're resting on the grace of god and his election is that right i love the lord and i thank god i appreciate what god did to here tonight i'm so glad i was here because one time i thought i was going to be here in lime ohio you know with my mother-in-law and all but you continue to pray that god's perfect will be done there you love god amen okay we just let's just let's just end in a word of prayer and you can play softly if you like father god i so thank you tonight for the message that you allowed my brother to preach you spoke to my heart and i believe you spoke to others lord we're not to you know trying to degrade your profit or anything we know where he is in our heart we know lord god that you called us for work and father we we know that when you said the move is on for the bride you're bringing these pressures on us you're bringing these trials and these tests on us so that
