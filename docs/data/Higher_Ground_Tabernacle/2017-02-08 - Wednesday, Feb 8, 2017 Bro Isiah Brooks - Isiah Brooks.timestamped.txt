[38:57] as we stand let us turn to
[39:00] Jeremiah I've been in bed practically
[39:03] all day battling
[39:05] demons I'm G give you my
[39:07] best because I'm giving him his
[39:10] best we thank God for his grace and his
[39:13] mercy
[39:15] and what would we
[39:18] say what can we do without
[39:21] him I love the
[39:25] Lord so going to turn right to the
[39:27] scripture without even looking for it
[39:30] we're going to be coming from Jeremiah
[39:32] the 32nd chapter of
[39:35] Jeremiah read the 36 to the 42nd
[39:44] verse Jeremiah
[39:47] 32 beginning at the 36th
[39:51] verse you love the Lord
[39:55] amen
[40:01] and it reads and now therefore thus
[40:03] sayeth the Lord the god of Israel
[40:06] concerning this
[40:08] city there where of ye say it shall be
[40:12] delivered into the hands of the king of
[40:14] Babylon by The
[40:16] Sword and by the famines and by the
[40:19] pestilence behold I will gather them out
[40:22] of all
[40:23] countries whether I have driven them in
[40:26] my anger and in my Fury and in great
[40:28] wrath and I will bring them again unto
[40:32] this place and I will cause them to
[40:34] dwell
[40:35] safely and they shall be my people and I
[40:39] will be their God and I will give them
[40:43] one heart one way that they may fear me
[40:47] forever for the good of them and for the
[40:51] childrens after them and I will make an
[40:54] Everlasting Covenant with them that I
[40:56] will not turn away from them to do them
[40:59] them good but I will put my fear in
[41:03] their hearts that they shall not depart
[41:05] from
[41:07] me yay I Will Rejoice over them to do
[41:11] them good and I will plant them in this
[41:13] land ass surely with my whole heart and
[41:17] with my whole
[41:18] soul but thus said the Lord like as I
[41:22] have brought all this great evil upon
[41:24] this people so will I bring them all the
[41:28] good that I have promised them you love
[41:31] the
[41:32] Lord let us pray father we thank you for
[41:36] your grace and your mercy we thank you
[41:38] for your goodness and all that you've
[41:40] done for us Lord no matter how the enemy
[41:44] is trying to afflict my body I I reject
[41:47] it Lord I stand because you said with
[41:50] your stripes we healed I pray father God
[41:54] that you give us the grace to Minister
[41:56] the word tonight Lord circumcise my
[42:00] heart circumcise my spirit oh God that
[42:04] your word will be declared tonight and
[42:07] we'll be careful to give you the praise
[42:09] the glory and the honor in Jesus
[42:11] Christ's name we pray amen you may be
[42:19] seated most of us have heard and we know
[42:22] so many things about Israel and all of
[42:25] the pests and trials that they have gone
[42:28] through we know by God's grace that
[42:31] Israel had several prophets Jeremiah was
[42:34] one of the Major Prophets that Israel
[42:37] had and uh we know that when Jeremiah
[42:40] came on the scene God had already told
[42:43] Jeremiah that the people would not
[42:45] repent and that he would be preaching to
[42:47] a hard-hearted people so no matter how
[42:50] much God would warn them through
[42:52] Jeremiah it had already been established
[42:56] that there was no place for repentance I
[42:58] want to say this by the grace of God
[43:01] Only God can give a man repentance
[43:03] repentance is not something that you
[43:05] feel like you want to do God's grace
[43:08] brings repentance you can feel sorry for
[43:12] what you've done but only God can give
[43:14] you true repentance so we realize that
[43:18] it is Grace is his mercy and it has to
[43:22] be his will to do so because remember in
[43:25] the time that Pharaoh tried to repent
[43:28] and every time he tried to repent God
[43:30] would Harden his heart so it is even
[43:33] your repentance is in the hands of the
[43:36] Lord I am so thankful to be one of them
[43:41] one of those people that God had chosen
[43:44] uh to to to to do his will in these last
[43:48] days there was a time that when
[43:52] Babylon took over Israel uh uh is uh and
[43:55] everything thing we find out that there
[43:57] were people who bought land and they
[44:00] bought land and they sealed the deed up
[44:02] in in Earth and vessels because God had
[44:06] promised them that they were going to
[44:07] come back to the land they were being
[44:10] chastised and they had to uh be
[44:12] chastised for 70 years one of the
[44:15] reasons why God uh chose 70 years he
[44:17] took 10 years for every year seven
[44:21] Sabbath there were seven Sabbath amen or
[44:23] 10 that they did not obey God and of
[44:26] course it it came up to uh to equal out
[44:30] uh 70 years and it's because they chose
[44:32] to work when God wanted them to rest now
[44:36] we find out that by God's grace that uh
[44:39] Israel had gotten so off to mock amen
[44:42] they began to just do all kinds of
[44:45] things uh that they knew that Jehovah
[44:47] God wasn't pleased with they did things
[44:50] that that all of their neighboring uh uh
[44:53] tribes or whatever more uh were doing
[44:56] they adopted Canaanite ways and all
[44:59] kinds of ways they adopted they adopted
[45:01] the the the the neighbors God Moab and
[45:04] all of these things knowing that God
[45:06] would be angry with them they took the
[45:09] God house of God and made it a business
[45:12] we've seen that before when Jesus walked
[45:14] into the Temple of Solomon he found that
[45:16] they had made God House of Prayer a a
[45:20] place of of money changing and he was
[45:22] very rought with that we understand that
[45:24] was his righteous indignation
[45:26] that took charge there and he W began to
[45:28] whip them out of the temple so God is
[45:31] looking for people in this last day that
[45:35] will reflect him we understand by God's
[45:39] grace that it is God's uh doing and we
[45:43] understand that it is his
[45:44] pleasure Think About by think about it
[45:48] that God did something from the
[45:51] beginning of time that mankind didn't
[45:54] even understand what he was getting
[45:55] ready to to do we understand we when it
[45:58] comes to Adam and Eve we saw Adam and
[46:00] Eve fall and we thought well praise God
[46:03] it just plunged Us in sin and had no
[46:05] idea by God's grace that this this act
[46:08] was basically the foundation of what God
[46:11] was getting ready to do in way of
[46:13] redemption we understand by God's grace
[46:16] that God showed that Adam was made after
[46:19] the very image and likeness of God God
[46:21] had given him a promise and that promise
[46:23] was to bring forth of his kind but
[46:26] because the woman defiled herself and
[46:28] then Adam defiled himself with the woman
[46:30] mankind was no longer in the image of
[46:33] God they were now in the image of man
[46:35] who was Adam so we realize by God's
[46:38] grace that this was all God's plan you
[46:41] see God is a god of contrast he's one
[46:43] that you'll know he'll let the darkness
[46:45] come in order to reveal light he'll let
[46:48] sickness come in order to reveal himself
[46:49] as a Healer he'll let confusion come in
[46:52] your life just to uh uh reveal to you
[46:55] how he is the peace of God so we realize
[46:59] by God's grace that everything that we
[47:02] see here is not by chance God didn't say
[47:04] well I'm gon throw a few coins out here
[47:06] and let's see how they land and then it
[47:08] work accordingly but everything that God
[47:11] did is so IND detailed that he was able
[47:13] to set it in the heavens as a record
[47:16] amen we realize amen that God's word can
[47:18] never come back void and God he does all
[47:22] of these things because of his own
[47:24] pleasure because of his own mercy and
[47:28] because of his own
[47:29] Grace understand these things there are
[47:32] things that we didn't understand for a
[47:33] long time time Jesus talked about it and
[47:37] he talked about a SE going to seow seed
[47:40] and in that seed he said there were
[47:42] seeds amen and he said uh this man sold
[47:46] good seed and then after him came a bad
[47:48] man man and sold Bad Seeds all right and
[47:51] I thought to myself just the other day
[47:54] what was the difference in the seed
[47:56] and and I believe it was the Holy Spirit
[47:58] that spoke to my heart and said the
[48:01] content the content see things can look
[48:05] exactly the same but it all depends on
[48:08] what's on the inside of the seed that
[48:11] would determine the difference in the
[48:12] seed right because nowadays they can
[48:15] hybrid a seed and it can look exactly
[48:18] like the genuine seed and to the Natural
[48:21] Eye you wouldn't be able to tell the
[48:22] difference but when it comes to the the
[48:26] the the the seed the only way to
[48:28] determine is whether it's real or
[48:29] whether it's fake is to bury the seed
[48:32] plant it and then whatsoever is in the
[48:35] content whatever that's in the seed
[48:37] would then make itself manifest and I
[48:40] thought that is so wonderful Lord amen
[48:43] because this is why God liken his word
[48:46] as the seed Hallelujah because within
[48:49] the seed of God's word is God himself
[48:52] and if that word is properly treated
[48:55] read it directly right it will bring
[48:58] forth God see it ain't the ground that
[49:01] brings forth God it's the seed that
[49:04] brings forth God and so the Lord showed
[49:07] me that this is why God before the
[49:10] foundation of the world planted a seed
[49:12] within the inside of you amen hallelujah
[49:16] because he understood that one day the
[49:19] light will strike that seed and bring
[49:21] forth the content y'all hear what I'm
[49:24] saying see if the real seed is God it
[49:28] can't help but to bring forth God Amen
[49:31] and we came to find out that in the
[49:33] beginning the spoken word was the
[49:36] original seed and if it was the original
[49:39] seed then it's the Original Seed now
[49:42] Hallelujah now God wanted natural seed
[49:44] and this is why he told Adam to be
[49:47] fruitful and multiply but the ultimate
[49:49] goal of God was to bring forth seeds of
[49:53] his kind hello and these seeds would be
[49:57] word seeds this is the difference
[50:00] between us and the Pentecostals because
[50:04] we are the seed of God and they are
[50:06] liken unto the
[50:07] shark Ephesians 1:9 I just want to say I
[50:10] was thinking also about um h a
[50:15] Grace Grace is so
[50:19] amazing I'm G say that again Grace is so
[50:24] amazing and you and I must realize amen
[50:27] that we are only here because of the
[50:30] grace of God you see what I was elected
[50:33] and chos chosen by God it still was
[50:35] Grace because not one of us could have
[50:38] merited his
[50:41] favor at all it was God who chose us it
[50:46] is God who elected us hello and so when
[50:50] we realize this that's why I think about
[50:52] heaven sometime and I think oh my God
[50:55] I'm so glad that we'll have bodies that
[50:57] we won't ever get tired in because I
[51:01] don't know you know there's got to be
[51:03] some rules there's got to be some laws
[51:04] there's got to be something there that's
[51:06] going to have to tell me when to stop
[51:09] and move forward I don't know but I
[51:11] can't hardly wait till I get into that
[51:14] place where I can worship God long as
[51:16] long as I want to without anybody
[51:19] disturbing me when you think about Grace
[51:22] and I'm talking about if if there be any
[51:25] any any age uh that have gone forth that
[51:28] that should appreciate the grace of God
[51:32] this age because this age is the worst
[51:35] age of all we have come at time of
[51:39] harvest we are in a Time the Bible
[51:42] called Dangerous perilous times we are
[51:46] in a Time amen that Daniel said when he
[51:49] saw in a vision he said he said the
[51:52] things that are getting ready to come
[51:53] upon the face of the Earth he said never
[51:56] ever has it ever been before so we
[51:59] realize amen that we're getting ready or
[52:01] the World At Large is getting ready to
[52:04] encounter HHH the Fier Fierce wrath of
[52:07] God like never before y'all hear what
[52:10] I'm saying the days of Noah just cannot
[52:14] compare to what's coming up the days of
[52:18] of of Sodom and gomorra cannot compare
[52:20] to the days that's coming up so look at
[52:23] the contrast look at the contrast
[52:27] because God took a a boat an ark and he
[52:31] saved Noah with an arc but watch Enoch
[52:35] because he realized that Enoch needed to
[52:37] be saved in a different way Hallelujah
[52:41] Enoch had to
[52:43] ascend into a place where the elements
[52:46] of the world couldn't touch him and so
[52:49] we understand by God's grace that God
[52:52] has likened and fashioned us like Enoch
[52:55] KN Hallelujah we won't stay on this
[52:58] Earth but God as according to H Psalms
[53:03] God 27 God will will will catch us up
[53:07] into a secret
[53:09] place Hallelujah a place of Pavilion a
[53:13] place of safety and and you know it's
[53:15] all that's the only way you'll be able
[53:18] to be
[53:21] saved so let me say it like this you
[53:24] can't go to Heaven unless you came from
[53:27] Heaven that's right hallelujah it's only
[53:31] those who have descended can us sin
[53:35] Hallelujah and you must have been with
[53:38] God in the beginning in order to return
[53:41] back to him can you understand what I'm
[53:45] saying because I want you to understand
[53:47] when God comes in a man God quickens
[53:51] that seed not your flesh not your
[53:54] emotions he quickens the seed and when
[53:58] God quickens the seed in you your work
[54:01] is
[54:02] finished why because it is the life of
[54:05] God that now take control God don't need
[54:08] your help oh Lord help me Lord Ephesians
[54:11] 1
[54:14] 9-14 having made known unto us the
[54:16] mystery of his will according to his
[54:19] good pleasure which he have purposed in
[54:23] himself now watch this God hid the
[54:27] mystery of his of of all of his his
[54:29] creation into a earth vessel called
[54:32] Jesus Christ hello and that earn vessel
[54:36] was
[54:39] sealed when Jesus was born the devil was
[54:42] so blind the devil went and tried to
[54:45] kill all the children that were two and
[54:46] a half years under thinking that he
[54:48] could kill Jesus but Jesus wasn't just a
[54:51] child he was a word child created by God
[54:55] himself Hallelujah he could have sent
[54:58] Herod could have sent all the forces
[54:59] that he wanted to Hallelujah after Jesus
[55:02] but he could not
[55:04] die Hallelujah any kind of death oh come
[55:09] on somebody understand what I'm saying
[55:12] God had he hid
[55:14] Jesus even the world in itself had no
[55:18] idea who Jesus Christ was and the more I
[55:21] think about it I said think about Israel
[55:25] that little place called Bethlehem and
[55:28] this great big old world it was like a
[55:32] the head of a needle compared to the
[55:35] mass of people that was on the earth and
[55:38] only a few people knew that he ever
[55:42] came y'all hear what I'm saying so if
[55:45] that be the truth how many people going
[55:48] to know when he
[55:53] leaves heaven what the good pleasure
[55:57] which he have purposed in himself that
[56:01] in the dispensation of the fullness of
[56:04] time he might gather together in one all
[56:08] things in Christ both which are in
[56:10] heaven which are in Earth even in him
[56:15] who's Gathering it God's Gathering it
[56:19] who knows wheat from tear God does Jesus
[56:23] said I my sheep Hearth my voice is that
[56:27] right and the Bible said the Lord
[56:29] knoweth them that are
[56:33] his
[56:35] Hallelujah my my message subject so you
[56:37] know where I'm going is called
[56:41] content of the
[56:43] seed see because this thing won't be
[56:45] able you can't fake
[56:48] it
[56:50] Hallelujah because you got to realize
[56:52] Amen in order for Christ to live you
[56:55] must
[56:56] die that is the
[56:58] law right it is the law since the fall
[57:03] everything that lives must die in order
[57:06] to live again y'all hear what I'm saying
[57:09] see so it can't be you know how can I
[57:12] say it i' I've seen people uh you know
[57:14] they say well well that that's just my
[57:17] personality God is not interested in
[57:19] your personality God is interested in
[57:22] one thing and that's his person
[57:25] in you we to be
[57:28] dead they could have say Paul he's a
[57:30] mean fell but you see nobody really saw
[57:34] Paul just like nobody saw
[57:37] Jesus y'all hear me they could say
[57:40] whatever they want to say but Jesus said
[57:42] I can't do nothing except the father
[57:44] show me everything he tells me to do
[57:46] that what that's what I do is there
[57:48] anybody here that can lay a charge to me
[57:51] for not doing what he told me to do see
[57:54] he really had had no life of his own
[57:56] that's why when they said to Jesus show
[57:58] us a father he said hold up now he said
[58:01] have you been so long with me Hallelujah
[58:04] that you would ask me that question show
[58:05] me the father he said when you see me
[58:08] you see the father see that show that
[58:11] Jesus really had no identity of himself
[58:14] outside of the word of
[58:20] God is that okay now that's the content
[58:23] of that seed yes when you saw Jesus you
[58:27] saw the unveiling of
[58:31] God y'all hear what I'm saying when you
[58:35] saw Jesus you saw the unveiling of God
[58:39] see and that's what we P oh that's Jesus
[58:42] hold up because if you and I are made
[58:45] are we possessed the same seed we are
[58:49] supposed to be the
[58:51] same brother Brooks ain't supposed to be
[58:53] brother Brooks he's supposed to be the
[58:55] unveiling of God for this day and this
[59:00] hour if anybody going to see Jesus they
[59:03] must see Jesus Through
[59:06] us see is his good pleasure and if you
[59:09] really want God to take full control he
[59:13] will I'm G say that again if you really
[59:17] want God to take full control of your
[59:20] life he
[59:23] will you'll never be able to stand
[59:26] before God and said Lord I offered
[59:28] myself and you didn't take
[59:31] me
[59:33] Hallelujah God took a few fish and
[59:35] loaves of bread God took amen two corns
[59:39] from a lady that's all she had
[59:42] hello God will take everything or
[59:45] anything you give
[59:47] him that he might be
[59:53] glorified and whom we have what obtained
[59:56] an
[59:57] inheritance being predestinated
[1:00:00] according to the purpose of him who
[1:00:02] worketh all things after the counsel of
[1:00:04] his own will and that's why God said
[1:00:07] that we should not murmur and complain
[1:00:09] and God have mercy on
[1:00:13] me
[1:00:15] Hallelujah by God's grace I'm looking
[1:00:18] and I'm trusting that everything comes
[1:00:20] out of my mouth will be
[1:00:23] life
[1:00:25] but even sometime you let little thing
[1:00:27] slip and all you can do is say God
[1:00:29] forgive
[1:00:31] me Hallelujah see this this is about his
[1:00:36] will the counseling of his will and who
[1:00:38] in Earth can tell God how to do it God
[1:00:42] does what he wants to do with you if God
[1:00:45] wanted the police to come knock on this
[1:00:47] door today and say you're locked up what
[1:00:50] you g to say oh my God what are you
[1:00:53] doing h Hallelujah that's not what the
[1:00:56] disciples did Hallelujah they began to
[1:00:59] worship they began to praise God why
[1:01:02] because they were in a ram and they knew
[1:01:05] that God was God and they understood no
[1:01:08] matter what region the demons came out
[1:01:11] of they had to pass by The Throne of God
[1:01:14] in order to get
[1:01:16] permission hello somebody you and I must
[1:01:20] understand nothing happens to a child of
[1:01:21] God by chance everything is ordained and
[1:01:25] predestinated by God even so the Bible
[1:01:28] said the footsteps of a righteous man
[1:01:30] are ordered by God how you going to get
[1:01:33] out of what you're going
[1:01:35] through Joseph said oh
[1:01:38] Lord I had a dream and I had no idea was
[1:01:41] GNA get me in this much trouble
[1:01:44] Hallelujah but never ever do you see in
[1:01:47] the scripture that Joseph ever
[1:01:48] complained about his condition why he
[1:01:52] somehow knew God was gonna get him out
[1:01:54] you know what you get this thing in your
[1:01:56] heart you can't explain it but you know
[1:01:59] God is in control and he's going to fix
[1:02:03] it that's what you call
[1:02:08] Revelation is that okay he's going to
[1:02:11] work it out to the counsel of his will
[1:02:13] and let me tell you something God will
[1:02:15] let you go through a situation for years
[1:02:17] before he changes
[1:02:18] it most of the time he lets us stay
[1:02:21] there because our our attitude
[1:02:25] Hallelujah when Jesus was getting ready
[1:02:27] to go into the greatest test of his all
[1:02:29] time you know what he said father not my
[1:02:32] will but thine be done and that's
[1:02:34] exactly what God is looking for
[1:02:37] surrender once you surrender to God
[1:02:39] he'll move you on but he finds a clay
[1:02:43] that's hard to be molded a clay that's
[1:02:45] going to resist his will he'll keep
[1:02:48] pressing he'll keep pressing until he
[1:02:52] gets you to fold into what he wants you
[1:02:54] to F into hello somebody the content of
[1:02:58] the seed all we've got to do is look at
[1:03:01] Jesus and we'll know how to act we'll
[1:03:04] know how to behave we'll know how to
[1:03:06] pray we'll know how to treat one another
[1:03:08] if we look at Jesus because he is what
[1:03:12] was in the seed or he is what is in your
[1:03:17] seed listen the Bible says
[1:03:21] what this is a god coming into us and
[1:03:26] and is what to that we should be to the
[1:03:28] praise of his glory what is God
[1:03:30] glory what is his glory you know what
[1:03:33] God's glory is when God can see the
[1:03:37] light of himself reflecting through
[1:03:40] you that's his glory I'm G say that
[1:03:44] again when God can it Oh Glory that
[1:03:48] ain't no
[1:03:50] glory you just said Glory but glory is
[1:03:54] when when go cuz anybody can say that s
[1:03:56] and Saint can jump and say Glory see but
[1:03:59] God's glory is when people can say like
[1:04:03] they did those Christians were first
[1:04:05] called Christians at Antioch why because
[1:04:08] they look like him they walk like him
[1:04:09] they talk like him the Miracles that
[1:04:12] followed them were just like Jesus see
[1:04:15] that is the glory of God in this age
[1:04:18] when when you in a dark age as it is can
[1:04:22] defy Satan's Eden and say God is still
[1:04:26] greater than you even in your own
[1:04:29] Eden in whom ye also trusted after ye
[1:04:35] heard the word of Truth The Gospel of
[1:04:37] your salvation in whom also after that
[1:04:40] you believe ye were sealed with that
[1:04:43] Holy Spirit of Promise y'all understand
[1:04:46] that so here it is we understand the
[1:04:48] Salvation is a process I was just
[1:04:50] listening to the prophet of God today he
[1:04:53] was talking about how his m mother
[1:04:54] whenever she have a dream is always true
[1:04:57] and he said she had a dream that he was
[1:04:59] standing by three stairs of steps
[1:05:01] preaching he said exactly right he said
[1:05:04] because I taught the justification
[1:05:06] sanctification and the baptism of the
[1:05:08] Holy Ghost Hallelujah and so you look at
[1:05:11] this thing you say well what do you mean
[1:05:12] see Paul preached the same thing
[1:05:15] Hallelujah if that wasn't true why would
[1:05:18] they say have you received the Holy
[1:05:20] Ghost since you
[1:05:21] believe Hallelujah something people
[1:05:24] believe in the Holy Ghost drops on them
[1:05:26] like that some people there's a
[1:05:30] process I don't care whichever way it
[1:05:33] comes as long as it comes Hallelujah and
[1:05:37] when it does it changes you you don't
[1:05:40] change
[1:05:41] it Hallelujah y'all have y'all know what
[1:05:44] I'm saying it's just like you I know
[1:05:46] what's what we do sometime God try to
[1:05:48] put a coat on us and you know how we do
[1:05:50] it you know trying to put it on the on
[1:05:53] the child's arm and they just hold still
[1:05:55] hold still hold still hold still all of
[1:05:58] a sudden you have to jerk them and say
[1:06:00] hold still put the to put the jacket on
[1:06:03] them and that's exactly what happens
[1:06:06] instead of you allowing God to just put
[1:06:08] the jacket on you you're trying to help
[1:06:10] God put the jacket on
[1:06:14] you Hallelujah and then by doing so you
[1:06:18] working against his will God gives you
[1:06:21] the Holy Ghost because he will to give
[1:06:23] it to you it ain't because you've been
[1:06:25] so good our righteousness is at filth
[1:06:28] theise says the
[1:06:29] Lord oh it's good to try to live right
[1:06:32] and do right but the ultimate thing the
[1:06:35] whole matter is God have mercy on whom
[1:06:38] he
[1:06:40] will oh that's why I love acts
[1:06:43] 238 the Bible said if you repent be
[1:06:46] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:06:48] Christ you shall receive the gift of the
[1:06:51] Holy Ghost so if you ain't got it
[1:06:54] if you don't have it and you've been
[1:06:57] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:06:59] Christ what made you get baptized
[1:07:02] because you knew it was a promise and
[1:07:04] that promise was I'm gonna give you the
[1:07:06] Holy Ghost Hallelujah so you have to
[1:07:10] hold God to his promise Lord I've been
[1:07:12] baptized I
[1:07:14] repented and you can't repent no more
[1:07:17] than God allow you to help us
[1:07:20] Jesus but when it comes to the Seal of
[1:07:23] God you and I must understand I'm going
[1:07:25] tell you something I wish it was so you
[1:07:28] know you could just go to the grocery
[1:07:29] store you say I want some of this and I
[1:07:32] want some of that and I want some of
[1:07:33] this and I want some and pick it up and
[1:07:34] leave right then you know Hallelujah but
[1:07:37] sometime when you ask for God God to do
[1:07:40] something he
[1:07:43] waits he does he just don't drop it in
[1:07:45] your
[1:07:47] buggy it's his purpose to give it to you
[1:07:50] because you ask but sometime God just
[1:07:52] wait to see whether you really wanted
[1:07:54] bad
[1:07:56] enough huh you say that's not true yes
[1:07:59] it is he told those disciples go to
[1:08:02] Jerusalem T there till you be endured
[1:08:04] with power amen hallelujah you can't
[1:08:07] even get people in here three four hours
[1:08:09] more or less amen 10
[1:08:11] days and God made him
[1:08:14] wait Hallelujah and all along no doubt
[1:08:18] they tried to figure him out but you see
[1:08:21] one thing about the content God cannot
[1:08:24] lie Hallelujah God cannot lie God cannot
[1:08:29] fail and he never will fail
[1:08:35] you listen you think you feel good when
[1:08:37] the Holy Ghost come down oh I'm telling
[1:08:39] you I'll be feeling good huh but this
[1:08:42] just
[1:08:43] Earnest that's just a little
[1:08:45] taste Hallelujah brother brandom said it
[1:08:48] it's almost perverted by the time it
[1:08:50] gets to you cuz when it comes from
[1:08:52] Heaven it's pure
[1:08:54] but as it
[1:08:57] descends Hallelujah it goes through the
[1:08:59] goes through the atmosphere and all
[1:09:00] these little things you hear what I'm
[1:09:02] saying so he said listen this is just
[1:09:04] the earnest and if you think that little
[1:09:07] piece of holy ghost that I gave you is
[1:09:09] wonderful you wait till you get to
[1:09:11] heaven
[1:09:13] hallelujah oh I want to say something
[1:09:15] let me say it like this because brother
[1:09:18] brand said the Holy Ghost is a
[1:09:20] gift
[1:09:22] Hallelujah understand this and it's a he
[1:09:25] said it's a temporal gift wo hallelujah
[1:09:30] what is it it's like the life it's like
[1:09:33] the blood it's the blood that God places
[1:09:36] in you to develop you to grow you to
[1:09:39] mature you and all those things but when
[1:09:41] you get to heaven you'll have your
[1:09:44] own oh
[1:09:50] Lord y'all you will be the Holy Ghost I
[1:09:53] don't know what else to
[1:09:56] say you will that's what's in the
[1:09:59] content of the seed God
[1:10:03] himself is that right God is using you
[1:10:07] as a
[1:10:08] incubator as a housing to produce
[1:10:12] himself in a mature
[1:10:15] State I don't know what else to say the
[1:10:19] content I got the Holy Ghost oh and the
[1:10:23] h Holy Ghost got me that's what I'm
[1:10:26] talking about it ain't no use in you
[1:10:28] having the Holy Ghost if the Holy Ghost
[1:10:30] don't have
[1:10:32] you the Holy Ghost wants you he wants to
[1:10:36] control you your minds and your thoughts
[1:10:40] and everything else but you've got to
[1:10:43] surrender Hallelujah I say that because
[1:10:47] I realize in this day surrendering is
[1:10:50] not
[1:10:52] easy it is flooded with pride this
[1:10:55] age arrogance and everything else nobody
[1:10:58] being humble is is weakness and all of
[1:11:02] this kind of stuff
[1:11:04] right but God don't care what they doing
[1:11:06] in the
[1:11:08] age God know what he puts in you and all
[1:11:12] he has to do is Quicken
[1:11:15] it Hallelujah I love the Lord Jesus
[1:11:18] because you know all of us have
[1:11:20] different um levels of faith you
[1:11:24] know you know some may have a little
[1:11:27] more than the other but it's the same
[1:11:30] Faith same God come on somebody and the
[1:11:34] only reason why God would give you more
[1:11:36] or give someone less is because maybe
[1:11:38] he's got more for you to do and less for
[1:11:40] somebody else to
[1:11:41] do but it doesn't make the man who does
[1:11:44] more greater than the one that's
[1:11:47] less Hallelujah my little toes you don't
[1:11:50] even think nothing about your toes but
[1:11:53] you miss one of them let one of them get
[1:11:55] cut off or
[1:11:56] something Hallelujah sometime you forget
[1:12:00] they're there until you stump
[1:12:03] it and they're very
[1:12:06] important y'all hear what I'm saying
[1:12:08] without those toes those that body
[1:12:11] wouldn't be able to be balance itself
[1:12:15] such a small thing oh yeah nothing about
[1:12:18] the the the thing in there it doesn't
[1:12:20] move doesn't do anything but you know
[1:12:22] get on your nerve grow all the time
[1:12:25] but you take that fingernail off that
[1:12:30] finger you go buy you
[1:12:34] some y'all hear what I'm saying those
[1:12:36] small things are important that's what
[1:12:39] Paul was trying to tell us everything is
[1:12:42] the body is
[1:12:44] important everything has been quickened
[1:12:47] to be made
[1:12:48] hair thank God we just don't have a face
[1:12:51] full of
[1:12:52] noses but but everything in the body is
[1:12:57] important Hallelujah y'all hear what I'm
[1:12:59] saying different gifts and everything
[1:13:01] else but it faith is something that God
[1:13:04] gives a man and you can hope for Faith
[1:13:06] all you want to but if God has
[1:13:08] determined in his in your life that give
[1:13:10] you a certain portion that's all you
[1:13:14] getting but it will be enough to make a
[1:13:19] [Laughter]
[1:13:21] Rapture that's all I'm talking about
[1:13:25] Hallelujah I don't know where I fit
[1:13:27] there in heaven I just want to
[1:13:32] fit y'all hear what I'm
[1:13:37] saying it's the
[1:13:40] content that's why John says oh little
[1:13:43] children I shouldn't have to write unto
[1:13:45] you about love is love see he talking
[1:13:48] about the content of the seed and if
[1:13:50] that seed has been quickened in you
[1:13:53] that's love love what my friends love my
[1:13:56] neighbor no love
[1:13:59] everybody God didn't give us room to set
[1:14:02] choose pick and choose the ones who we
[1:14:04] love love your enemy love those that
[1:14:07] spitefully use you do good unto them
[1:14:11] that's the content of the
[1:14:14] seed hello
[1:14:19] somebody Philippians 2 13 through 15 say
[1:14:24] for it is God which worketh in you both
[1:14:27] to Will and to do of his good pleasure
[1:14:30] do all things without murmuring and
[1:14:32] disputing hello I see people doing
[1:14:37] that surely when people do that is not
[1:14:40] is not the Holy Spirit that's doing
[1:14:42] it
[1:14:44] Hallelujah but God wants me to do this
[1:14:47] and I
[1:14:49] remember one of when I I Pastor the
[1:14:52] church I don't want to say to too much
[1:14:54] but I Pastor the church and these two
[1:14:55] little boys would sing together sometime
[1:14:57] and and when they were sing they were
[1:15:01] cute regardless to the noise they were
[1:15:06] making but so happened one of the little
[1:15:08] boys thought he could out sing the other
[1:15:10] one and the boy who thought he could out
[1:15:13] sing the other one was the one that was
[1:15:14] making most of the
[1:15:16] noise but when I saw the competition in
[1:15:19] such a way I stopped it and I basically
[1:15:22] didn't say both y'all need to stop
[1:15:24] because y'all can't sing I just gave the
[1:15:26] them other things to
[1:15:29] do instruments or
[1:15:32] so Hallelujah because I knew the talent
[1:15:35] wasn't
[1:15:37] singing but because they were musically
[1:15:40] inclined I felt like something that they
[1:15:42] could do in the field of music that
[1:15:44] would benefit the church and it
[1:15:48] did y'all hear what I'm saying one
[1:15:51] continued to sing and the other one
[1:15:53] continue to do other
[1:15:56] things glory to God it just brought back
[1:15:58] memories you know when it comes to the
[1:16:01] content and that's how it is with us
[1:16:04] it's what's in us that makes us
[1:16:07] different come on somebody listen if we
[1:16:10] look at Flesh and Blood right here
[1:16:13] nobody is better than the other we're
[1:16:15] guilty we're all Sinners wred amen
[1:16:19] hallelujah but it is the seed of God in
[1:16:23] you that makes you different and gives
[1:16:27] you
[1:16:29] worth y'all hear what I'm saying it
[1:16:32] makes you different and it gives you
[1:16:35] worth because remember now everything
[1:16:38] that is of no value will be
[1:16:43] burned see how he loves us he saw it he
[1:16:48] knew it and he planted his seed in US
[1:16:52] listen God wouldn't have saved the world
[1:16:54] if there wasn't nothing there for him to
[1:16:57] save hello just opposing the story went
[1:17:00] different and everything on Earth was
[1:17:02] serpents God wouldn't have wasted his
[1:17:06] time there wouldn't have been a
[1:17:11] Calvary that's deep in it I want you to
[1:17:14] think about it there would not have been
[1:17:16] a Calvary calary for was for you and
[1:17:19] me calary was God's redeeming plan and
[1:17:25] you cannot redeem something that's not
[1:17:28] yours at the
[1:17:30] first oh Lord have mercy I I I tell you
[1:17:33] what I feel really feel like shouting
[1:17:35] think about it content is what's in the
[1:17:39] seed that makes us different from
[1:17:42] everybody
[1:17:44] else Hallelujah Craig explained it so
[1:17:47] well he talk about that life coming from
[1:17:49] the seed all the way up to the Shu and
[1:17:51] everything else to Tal
[1:17:53] same life but listen every age that life
[1:17:58] moved on we can't be shock why because
[1:18:02] this is seed time shock is already
[1:18:06] established shock has already been
[1:18:08] judged this is seed
[1:18:13] time and if it is seed time that means
[1:18:16] that's all God looking
[1:18:20] for somebody help me that's all all he
[1:18:23] looking for he ain't looking for Shar
[1:18:26] he's looking for
[1:18:29] seed and at the end time the Bible said
[1:18:32] there will become a separation you see
[1:18:34] well win the separation it is now he
[1:18:36] said I send my angels to separate the
[1:18:39] wheat from the tear or the shark and
[1:18:42] what is this message doing separating
[1:18:45] the
[1:18:48] wheat bringing a separation right in the
[1:18:51] eyes of the people and if that be true
[1:18:53] it also declare that this is Harvest
[1:18:58] [Music]
[1:19:03] Time Harvest
[1:19:08] Time you know it's amazing because I
[1:19:11] remember when I was a little boy and

[1:19:23] call the table of content and that table
[1:19:26] of content will list all of the
[1:19:28] different
[1:19:30] subjects in that book so that you could
[1:19:33] break it down so you could have
[1:19:35] reference if you were looking for
[1:19:37] something to go find it in a certain
[1:19:39] area hallelujah hallelujah well in the

[1:20:42] the
[1:20:42] Omega see what I'm saying it's the
[1:20:46] content you know it's amazing you
[1:20:49] know it's like a bag of potato chips you

[1:21:01] you especially if you taste them already
[1:21:03] and you didn't like them right but if
[1:21:04] there's a thing about Laz potato chips
[1:21:07] every time you see that
[1:21:10] bag it's going to bring

[1:26:07] would have known what Jesus was all
[1:26:10] about he would have never crucified him

[1:27:39] and you and I must sell out amen every
[1:27:42] individual is responsible for himself or
[1:27:45] herself but the truth of the matter is
[1:27:47] the supernatural God must be seen in
[1:27:51] your life

[1:28:23] Hallelujah he said you got Lord excuse
[1:28:29] me he said you got to have the
[1:28:33] [Laughter]
[1:28:34] abstract Hallelujah don't you understand

[1:28:41] owner he's the owner and you got to have
[1:28:44] that to prove you was with
[1:28:47] them oh Lord help me Jesus Hallelujah
[1:28:52] he said when there was no death I was
[1:28:54] brought forth when there was no fountain
[1:28:57] abounding with water before the
[1:28:59] mountains was settled before the hills
[1:29:01] was I brought forth he and while as yet
[1:29:06] he had not made the Earth for the fields
[1:29:09] nor for the highest part of the Dust of
[1:29:11] the world when he prepared the heavens I
[1:29:13] was there when he set a compass upon the
[1:29:16] face of the earth when he established
[1:29:18] the clouds above when he strengthened
[1:29:20] The Fountains of the deep when he gave
[1:29:21] the see his decree that the waters
[1:29:23] should not pass his com commandment when
[1:29:26] he appointed The Fountains of the earth
[1:29:29] when I I then I was by him as one
[1:29:32] brought up with him and I was daily his
[1:29:35] Delight rejoicing always before
[1:29:38] him oh somebody
[1:29:41] somebody if y'all don't start saying
[1:29:44] amen I'm gonna quit this
[1:29:46] message y'all hear what I'm saying amen
[1:29:49] I'm fighting Devils up here as it is so
[1:29:52] y'all gonna help me
[1:29:53] preach now I'm G shut it
[1:29:55] down is that nice
[1:30:00] enough is that right what do parents
[1:30:05] do when he established the clouds above
[1:30:07] and when he had strengthened The
[1:30:09] Fountains of the deep when he gave the
[1:30:11] sea his decree that the wat should not
[1:30:14] pass his Commandments when he appointed
[1:30:16] the Fountain of the earth then was I by
[1:30:19] him as one brought up with him and I was
[1:30:22] daily his Delight rejoicing always
[1:30:25] before him rejoicing in the habitation
[1:30:28] of I'm reading the word I'm not giving
[1:30:30] you my thoughts right now I'm reading
[1:30:32] the word and the word deserves
[1:30:37] amen rejoice in the habitation of the
[1:30:40] part and my delight were with the sons
[1:30:42] of men now therefore hearken unto me oh
[1:30:46] ye children for blessed are they that
[1:30:48] what keep my ways amen and you and I
[1:30:52] must realize that's the key keeping
[1:30:56] God's way look through the whole content
[1:30:59] of the Bible and you'll find out that
[1:31:02] God has always exalted the people to
[1:31:05] keep his way everybody that kept his way
[1:31:08] was
[1:31:10] saved everybody that didn't keep his way
[1:31:13] was was not saved is that right
[1:31:16] hallelujah what was the main thing God
[1:31:19] one of the major thing God said unto
[1:31:20] brother Brown because you have chosen
[1:31:24] the harder way which is what my
[1:31:27] way you have a a huge portion of Heaven
[1:31:32] that's awaiting you just keeping God's
[1:31:35] way not the way of the Baptist or
[1:31:38] Methodist Catholic or whatever but the
[1:31:40] way of the
[1:31:44] word hallelujah now Faith is the
[1:31:48] substance of things hope for and the
[1:31:50] evidence of Things Not Seen
[1:31:52] Hallelujah is that all right cuz you and
[1:31:55] I must realize amen that What God Says
[1:31:58] listen when Christ came they had no idea
[1:32:01] what what he was packing but brother
[1:32:03] Brandon liken him as the Easter seal and
[1:32:06] when that Easter seal was broken guess
[1:32:08] what was H what happened that Easter
[1:32:10] seal which was Christ which was the life
[1:32:12] of God and then went down into the hell
[1:32:16] Hallelujah set the captives free in in
[1:32:19] in the re y'all hear what I'm saying
[1:32:22] Paradise Hallelujah had not the seal
[1:32:25] been broken there would not have been a
[1:32:29] resurrection because within Christ
[1:32:32] Christ knew what was in the content he
[1:32:34] said no man take my life he said but
[1:32:37] I'll lay it down and if I lay it down
[1:32:39] I'll pick it back up Hallelujah that's
[1:32:43] the content that's why Paul can say if
[1:32:46] that Spirit be in you that was also in
[1:32:49] Christ Jesus that is Quicken him is Mor
[1:32:52] body it will also Quicken
[1:33:02] yours I tell you if a man that feels
[1:33:05] like me can do what I do right now what
[1:33:09] I'm doing now by God's grace you can do
[1:33:12] too let's not resist the Holy
[1:33:16] Spirit we got to do
[1:33:19] better Hallelujah
[1:33:22] you love the Lord because we realize by
[1:33:25] God's grace he said
[1:33:27] take when and when when when when he
[1:33:30] when they were instructed to buy the
[1:33:32] field and and purchase it he says now I
[1:33:34] want you to take this thing put it in an
[1:33:36] earth and vessel but he was talking
[1:33:37] about Jesus Christ right because
[1:33:39] remember Abraham when he bought the
[1:33:42] field he wasn't gonna take no he wasn't
[1:33:44] taking nothing
[1:33:46] free right remember he said no no no no
[1:33:48] I'm going to pay for this because if I
[1:33:51] don't you gonna think that you gave me
[1:33:53] some kind of Victory see what I'm saying
[1:33:55] there's always a price to pray
[1:33:57] pay even when it comes to Christ you
[1:34:00] said well salvation is free but you
[1:34:02] still
[1:34:03] pay you pay with your
[1:34:06] life you got to give your life up in
[1:34:09] order to get Christ's life in
[1:34:12] you let me move on so you and I realize
[1:34:16] by God's grace that see if the seed is
[1:34:18] in you you got to recognize and I tell
[1:34:21] you what you can't have law and Grace at
[1:34:23] the same time but then God ain't going
[1:34:25] to put up with disgrace either y'all
[1:34:28] hear what I'm saying the truth of the
[1:34:29] matter is I can't tell you whether who
[1:34:31] you are only you know who you are you
[1:34:35] can't tell me who I am and I can't tell
[1:34:38] you who you are only God knows who you
[1:34:42] are right brother Browner preached to
[1:34:44] Millions but he didn't know who he who
[1:34:47] they were until they declared themselves
[1:34:49] to be Hallelujah when the man came up
[1:34:52] said I don't care what you do raise the
[1:34:54] dead or whatever he said I ain't going
[1:34:55] to believe he said that's all right this
[1:34:57] word wasn't written to the unbelievers
[1:34:59] it was written to the
[1:35:01] Believers Hallelujah see the point is if
[1:35:06] we're going to believe this message we
[1:35:07] got to go with all our hearts amen I'm
[1:35:10] preaching from the pull pit all the way
[1:35:11] back to the
[1:35:14] door let's

[1:36:49] us and therefore we don't have to worry
[1:36:51] worry about conquering it those things
[1:36:54] because you have conquered for
[1:36:57] us and father you said that if that seed
[1:37:00] remaineth in
[1:37:01] us we cannot we cannot sin
[1:37:05] amen surely Lord Jesus we know that your
[1:37:09] word is
[1:37:10] right and we can rest assured that if
[1:37:14] the seed is
[1:37:17] Quicken the god that begun the good work
[1:37:19] in US

[1:37:24] would make us lazy or
