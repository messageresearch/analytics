[0:00] amen as we stand let us turn to the
[0:07] scripture we'll be coming from first uh
[0:09] second Peter

[0:27] seventh verse
[0:28] tonight
[0:35] appreciate the Lord for being so good to
[0:37] us amen he is God yes he is and he's
[0:42] always uh
[0:45] mindful of us by the grace of
[0:48] God we just want to get right into the
[0:51] word we'll be coming from second Peter
[0:53] the second chapter we're going to read
[0:56] the 7th through the 12th
[0:58] verse uh verses and uh uh we'll read it
[1:03] prayerfully and we've we've gone through
[1:05] so many things here that by the grace of
[1:07] God we've already gone through so we're
[1:09] just going to uh jump right into the
[1:11] godliness and brotherly kindness
[1:14] amen and uh it says add to Godliness
[1:17] brotherly kindness and to brotherly
[1:19] kindness charity for if these things be
[1:23] in you and abound they make you that you
[1:26] should neither be Barren nor unfruitful
[1:29] in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus
[1:32] Christ but he that lath these things is
[1:35] blind and cannot see a far off and have
[1:39] forgotten that he was purged from his
[1:41] old sins wherefore the rather Brethren
[1:45] give diligence to make your calling and
[1:47] election sure for if you do these things
[1:50] you shall never fall for so an entrance
[1:54] shall be ministered unto you abundantly
[1:57] in the Everlasting Kingdom of our Lord
[1:59] and Savior Jesus Christ wherefore I will
[2:02] not be negligent to put you always in
[2:05] remembrance of these things though you
[2:07] know them and be established in the
[2:10] presence truth Amen Let Us Go by the
[2:14] grace of God to one more
[2:16] scripture Romans the 8th
[2:19] chapter uh beginning at the 15th
[2:23] verse Romans
[2:25] 8 beginning uh reading the 15th verse
[2:30] for ye have not received the spirit of
[2:32] bondage again to fear but you have
[2:35] received the spirit of adoption whereby
[2:38] we cry AB father the spirit itself Bears
[2:43] witness with our spirit that we are the
[2:47] children of God and if children then HS
[2:51] HS of God and join HS with
[2:54] Christ if so be that we suffer with him
[2:58] that we may be also so glorified
[3:01] together but I reckon that the suffering
[3:04] of this present times time excuse me are
[3:07] not worthy to be compared with the glory
[3:11] which shall be revealed in us for the
[3:14] earnest
[3:15] expectation of the creature waited for
[3:18] the
[3:19] manifestation of the sons of God for the
[3:23] creature was made subject to vaning not
[3:25] willingly but by reason of him who have
[3:28] subjected the same in
[3:31] Hope because the creature self also
[3:34] shall be delivered from bondage of
[3:35] corruption into the Glorious Liberty of
[3:38] the children of God for we know that the
[3:42] whole creation granth and travaileth in
[3:46] pain
[3:48] together until now let us pray Heavenly
[3:54] Father God we come before you as humbly
[3:56] as we know how we thank you for your
[3:59] good goodness we thank you for your
[4:02] grace we thank you for a lovely day Lord
[4:06] God and we pray father that you would
[4:09] just continue oh God to continue work on
[4:12] us oh give us a spirit of humility
[4:16] humble keep us humble before you Lord oh
[4:20] God that we will be willing to do
[4:23] whatever you would have us to do Grant
[4:25] it we ask in Jesus Christ's name we pray
[4:29] amen you may be
[4:32] seated amen we're still working by the
[4:34] grace of God with with uh
[4:39] completion I was listening by the grace
[4:41] of God to uh uh the message once more in
[4:46] 1963
[4:48] 11:17 and brother Brandon was talking
[4:51] about how Samson was
[4:54] stripped from all his
[4:57] powers and said basically had been
[5:01] defeated by the very thing that God has
[5:04] sent him out to
[5:07] destroy he went on to say that
[5:11] Samson was lured Away by we know the
[5:15] woman
[5:16] Delilah and Delilah types out the
[5:20] world but you see what the devil don't
[5:23] tell you is that while he's stripping
[5:25] you you're actually you losing strength
[5:29] you're losing faith you're losing all
[5:33] that God had placed in you the scripture
[5:36] tells us that Samson had Seven
[5:39] Locks and he revealed those locks that
[5:43] in those locks was his strength Samson
[5:48] types out the Church of
[5:50] today and we understand by the grace of
[5:53] God that God has given us Seven Virtues
[5:57] to uh complete yes and then God himself
[6:01] comes down and caps off with the eighth
[6:05] so we realize amen that here Satan
[6:08] always move slowly he's kind of like a
[6:12] creeper he's one that uh if you're not
[6:15] watchful unto prayer he'll be right on
[6:19] you the first thing he did with Samson
[6:22] was he put out his spiritual
[6:25] eyes and I am afraid that so many of us
[6:30] uh in this message eyes have been put
[6:35] out because we can not see the enemy and
[6:40] we can't see God as well and we find out
[6:45] that Samson had gotten to a
[6:47] place amen where all he could do was
[6:51] reminisce on all the things that God had
[6:55] done for him you are in a strange place
[7:00] when all you can do is
[7:02] remember yesterday or the day before
[7:05] yesterday what God has done for you God
[7:09] is one that should uh move in your life
[7:12] on a daily basis amen there should be
[7:15] praise uh and
[7:18] Thanksgiving uh every day of your life
[7:22] am so you and I must realize Amen to be
[7:26] backsliding as brother brandham said
[7:28] doesn't mean that you going back into
[7:31] the world but it means that you your
[7:33] knees are locked and you're not going
[7:36] anywhere so we realize amen there was
[7:39] one thing that Samson thought when he
[7:42] within himself according to brother
[7:44] brandham he thought perhaps there is an
[7:49] opportunity that God would restore
[7:52] Me Maybe if I call on his name he'll
[7:57] restore and bring back the the holy
[7:59] ghost power in my
[8:02] life but one thing that Samson realized
[8:05] is that he had to die with his
[8:10] enemy in other words the things that are
[8:13] in your life that have you bound or the
[8:16] things that you must not only kill but
[8:19] you must die with it hello
[8:22] somebody amen you must be willing to die
[8:25] if you're not willing to die with the
[8:27] Enemy you'll never get the victory am
[8:30] you must be willing it is uh uh uh
[8:33] brother said basically you know it must
[8:36] be a madeup mind I have decided I will
[8:40] die with my
[8:41] enemy oh Lord have mercy on me once
[8:47] more and you know in that message he was
[8:50] really screaming out basically he said
[8:53] if you only knew what time it was uh and
[8:57] that was in 1963
[9:00] he said you ought to be
[9:02] hollowing and crying out now I had never
[9:08] ever heard him say that like that before
[9:11] but for whatever reason God
[9:13] allowed that portion of the tape to
[9:17] catch my attention because there are so
[9:20] many people even in this church amen who
[9:23] don't believe you've got to holler and
[9:25] cry out but I'm going tell you something
[9:28] desperate ation hadn't struck you yet
[9:31] when desperation strikes you amen you
[9:34] will scream and you will holler amen for
[9:39] whatever you might need is that all
[9:42] right now we're talking about uh I had a
[9:47] brother tell me the other day and and
[9:49] and which I thought was really good he
[9:51] said brother Brooks I'm not going to
[9:53] play with it he said I'm going to start
[9:55] from
[9:56] virtue he said I know I got faith
[9:59] he said but I need some
[10:01] power hello and I thought man that is
[10:04] really really good because the Bible
[10:07] said that sometimes we have to uh uh go
[10:10] back to that place where we were first
[10:13] illuminated and the Bible says you know
[10:15] there are times we have to go and do our
[10:18] first works
[10:20] over hello it's better to be
[10:24] sure because the Bible said make your
[10:27] calling an elect
[10:30] sure he said I don't want to assume I
[10:33] got certain things he said I want to
[10:36] know that I know that I have them and I
[10:39] thought brother that is absolutely the
[10:42] mind of God because I realize amen that
[10:46] you don't want to get up the road and
[10:48] find out that your chain is still
[10:51] weak Amen brother Ram said that chain
[10:55] that hangs be over
[10:57] hell hello
[11:00] that chain is only as strong as his
[11:02] weakest link and if that chain is
[11:05] hanging you over hell and you allow it
[11:07] to break you are in trouble hello
[11:11] somebody look it up in your concordance
[11:13] chain hanging over
[11:15] hell but listen in brotherly kindness
[11:18] because this is where we must we must
[11:20] all grow uh you know it's it's it's it's
[11:24] it it is what it is often time we fail
[11:27] to put ourselves in in our brother's
[11:30] place or in our brother's matters
[11:34] because we feel like we may be up the
[11:37] road and of course it's not our problem
[11:41] and of course we don't have the kind of
[11:43] complexes he or she has or have so
[11:47] therefore we don't understand why they
[11:49] got to go through all these
[11:52] changes brotherly kindness learns how to
[11:55] empathize or sympathize and brotherly
[11:58] kindness is know how to get in there and
[12:01] become that individual but how you going
[12:04] to become that individual if you don't
[12:06] even know one
[12:09] another hello
[12:11] somebody you can't put yourself in a
[12:13] person's place if you don't even know
[12:15] who they
[12:17] are and it's so that a lot of times
[12:20] people look at things and I'm going tell
[12:22] you something there's so many people in
[12:24] this message feels like what I'm
[12:25] preaching is not even necessary but I'm
[12:28] going to tell you something brother ROM
[12:29] said if you don't have this you don't
[12:32] have nothing
[12:34] amen now I was going to read a scripture
[12:37] and I read it I think it was Romans 8:15
[12:39] I was supposed to read it for ye have
[12:42] not received the spirit of bondage again
[12:44] to fear but you have received the spirit
[12:48] of adoption in other words that spirit
[12:51] that you get is the spirit that brings
[12:53] you to adoption amen a lot of time
[12:57] people believe that once I get that
[12:59] spirit in me I got it but brother bam
[13:02] said the baptism of the Holy Ghost is
[13:04] just the beginning of the journey hello
[13:07] that spirit is the Holy Ghost of course
[13:10] but the Bible according to Galatians
[13:12] says it's your tutor amen it is child
[13:16] training you it's bringing you up
[13:18] Hallelujah and therefore you and I are
[13:20] not supposed to remain just children but
[13:23] you and I supposed to be taught by the
[13:25] tutor and the prophet of God said that
[13:27] Holy Ghost tells the father exactly what
[13:30] you're doing yes sir amen so you see
[13:34] getting the baptism of the Holy Ghost is
[13:36] the beginning of the journey right you
[13:38] say I don't believe that well Jesus
[13:41] received the Holy Ghost on the Jordan
[13:43] River and the father God said this is my
[13:46] beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased to
[13:49] dwell in hello he was in there and the
[13:52] Bible tells me that he was led into the
[13:54] Wilderness to do what be tempted see cuz
[13:58] after you get the the Holy Ghost then
[13:59] you're led to be what tempted or tried
[14:02] Hallelujah come on somebody he was Tried
[14:05] by the lust of the flesh to L of the eye
[14:07] and the pride of life and and he came to
[14:10] conclude with the devil man does not
[14:12] live by bread alone but by every word
[14:15] that proceedeth out of the mouth of God
[14:18] and this is another thing he said to
[14:19] Satan I am your God Amen I don't worship
[14:23] you you worship me amen see and once you
[14:28] and I coming to the full statue of
[14:30] Christ we become the god of Satan amen
[14:34] that's right why because the god of
[14:36] Satan is in US amen amen see now
[14:40] brotherly kind is is is hoping someday
[14:43] you know we have patience with one
[14:45] another and Temperance and enduring with
[14:47] him and knowledge to understand what he
[14:49] believes and you know and remember it's
[14:52] in his heart see and that's what it is
[14:55] virtue in yourself to let it go out with
[14:58] kindness and meekness to him and having
[15:00] faith that someday God will bring him in
[15:04] see that's what we're working with that
[15:07] God will someday bring us into that
[15:10] place how you going to be tried and
[15:12] tested you can't Grumble when God bring
[15:15] test on you you got to learn how to
[15:17] thank God and appreciate God Amen for
[15:20] what he's doing for you amen all right
[15:24] so we realize amen by the grace of God
[15:27] that you know throughout the Church ages
[15:29] of course they rejected uh uh the
[15:32] Capstone and in in our day they rejected
[15:34] the Capstone and and God so allowed us
[15:38] to see that that he he allowed America
[15:40] to put it on her on her uh dollar bill
[15:43] and and but there in that time period
[15:46] there was going to be a people who would
[15:47] receive it amen amen sir and understand
[15:51] this amen the Capstone setting down and
[15:54] coming down upon you it's not because
[15:56] you receive it it's because he receives
[15:59] you amen when Jesus went up on the mount
[16:02] Transfiguration the Bible said there
[16:04] Shone a light from Heaven it was God
[16:06] coming down and he said hear ye him this
[16:10] is he hear ye him
[16:13] amen right now realize that in the
[16:16] messages of adoption brother R talks
[16:18] about the two sons of God that's exactly
[16:21] what happens you'll never be fully
[16:23] adopted without the world knowing it or
[16:25] the church knowing
[16:27] it it makes sh out like a
[16:29] secret but it will be made
[16:33] manifest adoption see is a relationship
[16:36] with
[16:37] God which God was pleased to establish
[16:42] between himself and
[16:44] Israel in preference to all other
[16:47] nations in other words when God chose
[16:50] Israel as an adopted son he made the
[16:53] world know there was a difference you
[16:57] couldn't just treat Israel
[16:59] any kind of way and got away with it
[17:02] hello as long as Israel stayed within
[17:05] the word of God God made himself made
[17:09] manifest right because
[17:12] remember Janice and jambre was a church
[17:15] member of the wrong Church they was of
[17:18] the Church of the Pharaoh but they were
[17:20] there they had signs they had wonders
[17:23] come on somebody but when it came to
[17:25] Moses God made a distinct difference
[17:30] through the signs the Wonders and all
[17:32] that took
[17:33] place right amen and that's the way God
[17:37] is even in the early church I don't care
[17:39] how many Orthodox Jewish Church there
[17:42] were that little Christian group was
[17:46] manifested as the Sons and Daughters of
[17:49] God by signs and wonders and that's what
[17:52] brother R said he said there was a time
[17:54] when the church had power there was a
[17:57] time she had strength but now she's like
[17:59] Samson she got more muscle she's got a
[18:01] bigger Church she got more people but
[18:04] has no power why and he said God don't
[18:07] want your strength he wants your
[18:09] heart because if he can get your heart
[18:13] he's got everything of
[18:14] you so adoption also is the nature and
[18:19] the condition of the true disciples in
[18:22] Christ uh who by receiving the spirit of
[18:26] God in their
[18:29] Souls become sons of God now there is no
[18:33] other place uh that that that that the
[18:36] elected is is ordained to receive God
[18:39] outside of their soul and understand
[18:43] that's why amen that the temple as I
[18:45] said last we had to be rent from top to
[18:47] bottom because God was saying whosoever
[18:50] will let him come but you know God
[18:53] understood who will and who wouldn't and
[18:55] he knew that his elect people would also
[18:58] hear his voice and follow through with
[19:02] the plan is that all right sure enough
[19:04] it is oh my God help us Lord because you
[19:07] I you and I must understand that we must
[19:10] seek these uh qualities and Virtues Of
[19:13] God every day now let me say it like
[19:16] this if you're not born again you got to
[19:18] get first born again because there's
[19:20] nothing to build
[19:22] upon right when you're born again that's
[19:24] Jesus Christ as the foundation amen and
[19:27] that found Foundation is laid there amen
[19:30] and from that point on you at virtal
[19:32] knowledge tempers all the way up that's
[19:34] God that's you growing and maturing as a
[19:37] Christian amen you'll never you'll
[19:40] always I put it this way there's always
[19:43] potential to fter until you completely
[19:46] capped with Divine love that's right
[19:50] hello can I say that again because the
[19:53] Bible according to the word of God said
[19:55] love never faileth amen love seeketh not
[19:59] her own love is not puffed up come on
[20:03] somebody up to that place you are you
[20:05] can be you can be you can go almost all
[20:08] the way because
[20:09] remember the chain is as strong at his
[20:12] weakest
[20:13] link and divine love out of all of them
[20:17] is the perfect
[20:19] gift is when God the fullness of God
[20:22] steps into your body and you become a
[20:26] living Monument
[20:29] now we're here and I said last week amen
[20:33] that these gifts uh let me put it this
[20:36] way according to the statute of perect
[20:37] man he says the
[20:39] glory the power of God coming down
[20:43] through this welding this together and
[20:47] he's talking about all of Virtues all
[20:49] the way from Paul all the way to Le deia
[20:52] he said God building his church is like
[20:55] one person into an individual into him
[20:58] self so that's why the prophet of God
[21:00] said uh justification make room for
[21:04] sanctification sanctification make room
[21:06] for the baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[21:08] the baptism of the Holy Ghost make room
[21:10] for the person of Jesus Christ himself
[21:12] that is why he said it the way he did
[21:16] because that Holy Ghost Fire
[21:19] Burns everything out of you step by step
[21:23] amen amen and wells in Christ Wells him
[21:27] in to you so connected you call it a
[21:31] fusion he fuses it in there so nothing
[21:34] can break through come in or out you're
[21:37] sealing in there is that right amen he
[21:41] says listen a sheep bear wool and he
[21:43] doesn't manufact W facture wool uh like
[21:47] oh I must I must pray because I know I
[21:49] must pray I must stop lying because I
[21:52] know that is what I am to
[21:54] do
[21:56] huh that's that's a crow wanting to be a
[22:00] peacock see we're not talking and I've
[22:03] said that long time ago you Cann not
[22:06] teach a dog how to bark a dog barks
[22:08] because it is a bark he is a nature it
[22:11] is the nature like you don't have a a
[22:13] cow don't go to school to practice to
[22:15] give milk it is the nature of that cow
[22:17] to give milk so is it when it comes to
[22:20] these virtues when it comes to God in
[22:23] you it ain't a practice it is what it is
[22:26] it's a fountain it's a it's an teasing
[22:28] well it comes up bringing Living Waters
[22:31] see and that's where a lot of the people
[22:34] everywhere have been guilty I'm saying I
[22:37] got to do this I got to do that you're
[22:39] just under law and you're going to fail
[22:41] no Ang a but about it it's going to fail
[22:44] until you ask God give me a Praying
[22:46] Spirit give me something that'll take me
[22:50] out of the way and put you in place of
[22:53] amen that's what we need that's why we
[22:55] fall short that's why our prayer lives
[22:58] many of us have dwindled because we have
[23:00] been doing
[23:01] it come on it's
[23:04] evidence
[23:06] yeah see I want you to know one thing
[23:08] about God he knows how to
[23:12] pray and when God is praying he knows
[23:16] what to
[23:17] say and you know when God is praying
[23:19] he's is eternal so it time has no
[23:22] element you know I mean we come to
[23:24] prayer I'm talking about prayer meeting
[23:26] now because when you come to prayer
[23:28] meeting or even prayer at home you can
[23:30] pray as long as you want
[23:39] to uh put it this way God can take you
[23:42] say Lord how can I pray H H all night
[23:45] prayer normally you
[23:48] can't your flesh is not going to let you
[23:52] you can't do it but God can see when
[23:55] it's God praying he can take you all

[25:25] just perfection that's what I'm striving
[25:28] for that's what I'm placing for here's a
[25:31] prophet saying that's what I'm striving
[25:33] for that's what I'm placing for come on
[25:37] somebody right he says oh Lord what I
[25:41] I'm here at the church for trying to set
[25:43] the church in order telling you brother
[25:46] and sister there's only one thing that
[25:49] can ever enter that and that's perfect
[25:51] love not because you are loyal to Bram
[25:54] Tabernacle or the Methodist Church or
[25:56] Baptist Church them all all right you
[25:58] should be but oh friend you've got not
[26:02] because you spoke with tongues danc in
[26:04] the spirit because you cast out Devils
[26:06] or move mountain with faith that's all
[26:09] right for all that's all right but still
[26:11] unless that real perfect love is in
[26:15] there there's what what's we're we're
[26:18] perfect that's where we're perfect they
[26:21] have they have obtained an inheritance
[26:24] inheritance inherit what eternal life
[26:26] being predestinated how he says does
[26:30] every does everybody understand that did
[26:32] you call on God no God called on you no
[26:35] man never sought God God seeking
[26:39] man Jesus said so no man can come to the
[26:42] father except the father draws him first
[26:44] see the nature of a man is to run from
[26:46] God and that's what BR that's what
[26:49] brothers me bothers me though to preach
[26:52] to you people don't remain on in the
[26:56] same condition you've been going in
[26:58] change now he said hear me I say it thus
[27:02] say the Lord I've never called myself
[27:05] this I'm not but you call me your
[27:07] Prophet or or or Prophet the world
[27:09] believes that the world around millions
[27:11] and millions and millions of people I've
[27:13] spoke directly and indirectly to tens
[27:16] and 12 millions of people or more
[27:18] directly speaking I've seen tens of
[27:20] thousands of visions and signs and
[27:22] wonders and not one of them have ever
[27:24] failed and that's right he foretold mean
[27:28] that that never failed to uh happen just
[27:30] exactly I bring any man to trial for
[27:34] that that's right I don't claim to be a
[27:36] prophet but you listen to me thus say
[27:39] the Lord it'll take perfect love to put
[27:42] you in that place for that's all there
[27:46] was there no matter how many how much
[27:49] religion Den demonstration how many Good
[27:52] Deeds you've done whatever you've done
[27:55] that won't count nothing on that day
[27:58] it'll take perfect love so whatever you
[28:00] do you lay aside everything else until
[28:04] you are just so filled with the love of
[28:06] God till you can love those who hate you
[28:09] I'm I'm just as I said this morning I
[28:13] the whole makeup is
[28:16] Grace so you got to realize amen that
[28:19] you and I we our time is
[28:22] short and he says as long he said this
[28:26] in 63 6465 he said it's going to be
[28:30] harder long as the time continue it's
[28:33] going to be harder to get the Holy Ghost
[28:36] amen the longer he
[28:38] carries the harder it will become to get
[28:42] the Holy Ghost amen so if it's going to
[28:45] be harder for us that's why oh I don't
[28:47] know why I a well how can they get it so
[28:49] easy because God Is Lifting his spirit
[28:52] amen that's
[28:54] right and if you don't get it amen is
[28:56] nobody fault but your own come on
[29:01] somebody now listen what he says 1 John
[29:04] 4:18 said there is no
[29:07] fear in love but perfect love cast out
[29:12] fear because fear have torment he that
[29:15] fearth is not made perfect in
[29:18] love and that's with anything demon work
[29:21] job it don't make no difference when
[29:24] Satan can make you fear and I don't mean
[29:26] come on somebody you hear a dog barking
[29:29] all of a sudden your flesh is going to
[29:30] quiver but that holy ghost kicks in sir
[29:34] right it's like brother BR when he when
[29:36] the when the when the when the when the
[29:37] uh uh uh bull was coming out his way
[29:40] amen he reached for his
[29:43] gun right but all of a sudden the Holy
[29:45] Ghost come down and settled the whole
[29:47] man that's what divine love is and
[29:51] that's what we're looking for now
[29:53] searching and diligently seeking God and
[29:56] and listen you oh brother I get
[29:58] frustrated that's all right every
[30:01] pregnant woman get frustrated when she's
[30:03] about to bring forth the
[30:05] child amen it ain't easy and your flesh
[30:09] want to get frustrated but you keep
[30:11] pushing and pressing and knowing by the
[30:14] grace of God this is for you because if
[30:17] you don't believe it's for you you'll
[30:19] never get
[30:20] it you as an individual got believe that
[30:23] you're bride and this is for you amen
[30:28] he builds a church and he's now building
[30:31] individuals the same way every church
[30:35] amen every church becomes one big church
[30:37] is that right he means every church
[30:40] becomes one big church amen now listen
[30:44] he says ever since by faith I saw the
[30:47] stream that flowing wound Supply
[30:50] redeeming love has been my theme and
[30:52] shall be till I die is that right he
[30:55] said though I speak with tons of men and
[30:58] angels and have not love it profits me
[31:00] nothing though I give all my goods to
[31:02] feed the poor it profits me nothing
[31:05] though I have power to move mountains
[31:07] and so forth it profits me nothing where
[31:10] there is prophecies it'll fail where
[31:13] there's tongues it'll cease and where
[31:15] there is knowledge it'll vanish away but
[31:18] when perfect love is coming to the human
[31:20] heart all demons in hell will never be
[31:24] able to upset it that's right he said
[31:28] hey is that good enough he said no demon
[31:31] in hell will be able to upset
[31:37] iten that's right he goes on and that
[31:40] was in Israel at Kadesh Baria and from
[31:43] that time he says amen that God is
[31:46] Christ is all in you all to you is that
[31:49] right don't you miss it my brother now
[31:52] he talks about his experience going
[31:53] beyond the curtain of time he talks
[31:55] about eyes have not seen ears of not
[31:57] heard neither have entered into the
[31:58] hearts of men that what God has has has
[32:01] for them in store that love him he said
[32:03] I've been more determined he said since
[32:05] I've been there I've been more
[32:07] determined Amen to do what God would
[32:09] have me to do is that right and he used
[32:11] that scripture he says lo I come into
[32:13] the volume of the book to do thy will oh
[32:15] God he said every day you ought to say
[32:19] Lord I want to do that which is only
[32:22] pleasing to
[32:24] you I speak in the name of the Lord
[32:27] except you have that perfect love you'll
[32:30] never be there cuz nothing could ever be
[32:32] there without it your spirit won't be
[32:35] out of place there uh if it couldn't
[32:39] come there'll be no way for it to come
[32:42] no more than it would be for a grain of
[32:44] corn to raise up out of the ground
[32:46] without a germ of life in it no matter
[32:48] how nature it natural it would look it
[32:52] could not rise and that's what he's
[32:54] saying that Holy Ghost that life in US
[32:56] is is the germ of life without that
[32:58] being in us there is no
[33:01] Resurrection right hello y'all
[33:04] understand that I'm saying these things
[33:06] because I don't think we I'm I'm it's F
[33:09] it's really unfolding to me you know it
[33:12] it'll make you stop all of the
[33:14] foolishness you know uh H and you don't
[33:16] want all of that you know uh you know
[33:19] but I ain't going to I'm not going to
[33:21] pretend I want God to take it I want God
[33:24] to deliver uh uh me and and and and and
[33:27] Place himself instead of all of the
[33:29] other
[33:30] stuff now he says Christ in the person
[33:33] of the Holy Ghost comes upon you in the
[33:35] true baptism of the Holy Ghost and you
[33:38] done got all these virtues sealed in you
[33:41] then God lives in the Tabernacle called
[33:43] the building the living Tabernacle of
[33:45] the Living God Dwelling Place when a man
[33:48] possesses these kinds of things then the
[33:50] Holy Ghost comes upon him no matter you
[33:53] might speak with tongues you might
[33:55] impersonate any gift that God's Got God
[33:57] you might do that but until these
[33:59] virtues here go into you you're still
[34:01] off the real true foundation of Faith
[34:05] but when these virtue grows in as you
[34:07] add it to that to that then you are a
[34:10] living Monument you are living moving
[34:13] Idol but you know the Heathen they
[34:16] prostrate themselves before the idol the
[34:18] imaginary God and in an imaginary way
[34:21] they believe that the imagination of God
[34:23] speaks back to them that's heathenism
[34:26] that's romanism they bow before the kind
[34:29] of saints and everything else they have
[34:32] right he said West uh excuse me they
[34:34] have amen uh Saint sis CIA and House of
[34:38] God and so many different things like
[34:40] that they bow to that and actually
[34:42] believe that in an imaginary way but he
[34:44] ain't talking about in no imaginary way
[34:47] he said what a type of it is true Living
[34:49] God but when we got not in imaginary way
[34:53] but prostrate ourselves before a living
[34:55] God a living virtue a a living knowledge
[34:57] a living patience a living godliness a
[35:00] living power coming by the Living God
[35:02] makes a living man a Living Image the
[35:05] stature of God what he do what what he's
[35:08] doing the same thing that Jesus did
[35:11] walked the same way he walked doing the
[35:13] same things he did because it's not
[35:15] imaginary thing there's a reality that
[35:18] proves it see what I mean see how these
[35:21] virtues these Building Material types in
[35:23] the church Min uh Messengers with the
[35:25] church ages now one of these days we're
[35:28] going to take each one of them and you
[35:29] know he goes on like that but anyway
[35:31] he's basically saying listen this is not
[35:33] an imaginary thing it's a
[35:38] reality one of my uh friends long
[35:41] friends and uh I put it this way
[35:43] Associates she was uh just died uh about
[35:47] a week or two ago uh went to Brother
[35:49] Isaac nor Aus Church there in in uh
[35:52] Tucson and this is uh uh the second time
[35:56] that I I've uh
[35:58] experienced or heard about it I put this
[36:00] way because the first time I didn't go
[36:02] to the hospital and the second time this
[36:04] time this last time I wasn't there but
[36:06] they told they tell me the sister when
[36:08] she was she hadn't spoken for a whole
[36:11] week and uh when she did awake she start
[36:17] greeting and patting a brother and
[36:19] calling his name a brother who's gone on
[36:22] before and say when she finished
[36:24] greeting she left out of the room she
[36:27] was gone be regard now a old sister uh
[36:32] her husband is the assistant pastor
[36:34] there at brother uh Tucson T brother uh
[36:38] uh norus church I don't forgot the name
[36:40] of it I don't want to call it uh but but
[36:42] my point is somewhere this lady this
[36:46] sister had it all
[36:50] right she didn't go down she went up
[36:53] am now my point is this the Bible said
[36:57] make your calling and election sure so
[37:00] you and I don't have to wonder cuz God
[37:02] said you can make it sure amen and by
[37:05] making it sure you're allowing test and
[37:08] trials to come and you know what's
[37:11] happening to you you're acting like
[37:13] Jesus would act that's right that's when
[37:15] you know you got it when you're acting
[37:18] like Jesus would act in every situation
[37:21] amen you know you got it you don't have
[37:24] to worry about flying off the h
[37:27] and want to
[37:30] curse Hallelujah come on somebody amen
[37:33] you got it like Jesus he said that's how
[37:35] it is with your brothers and your
[37:36] sisters he said when you be behave like
[37:43] Jesus come on somebody he said these two
[37:46] classes of people
[37:49] today same classes that's trying to do
[37:51] something to save
[37:53] themselves each one say I got to go to
[37:55] church and every Sunday that's very good
[37:58] I want to be religious he said that's
[38:00] very good that's still under a law but
[38:03] when the other by going to church being
[38:06] good is not something that you do
[38:08] yourself it's something in you doing it
[38:10] for you the Holy Spirit In Your Heart
[38:14] amen now notice in this intercourse
[38:16] these people that lived inside here seem
[38:19] to have always Fed Up always feeling
[38:23] good Ezekiel said I will write my laws a
[38:26] knew and put in their heart and where
[38:28] the law used to be on stones in the ark
[38:31] he said the ark represents the heart
[38:34] then I will put my new law in their
[38:36] hearts in the ark the heart is the Abode
[38:40] of God and in the Old Testament God
[38:42] dwelt In His glory over the ark heart is
[38:47] the ark God dwells not in the head in
[38:51] the heart God not known by theology God
[38:55] not known by mental conception God not
[38:58] known by old fashion Sanctified excuse
[39:01] me God's known excuse me by old fashion
[39:05] Sanctified Born Again experience that's
[39:07] in the human heart he said yet men and
[39:11] women live a good life love God by a
[39:13] mental conception but the real hiding
[39:16] place is in the heart hid with Christ
[39:19] and when Christ the Holy Spirit comes
[39:21] into your heart he is in you with your
[39:24] Temperance yes sir he's living in his
[39:27] own life he he's living his own life
[39:30] through his own will through you am I'm
[39:35] going read that
[39:36] again he's living his own life through
[39:40] his own will through you Hallelujah I
[39:45] know it sounds awful but it's right
[39:47] Christ so yielded you are that Christ
[39:50] speak the kinds of word he speaks he
[39:53] thinks the kinds of thought he would
[39:55] think through you he does the kind of
[39:58] works he would do through you you are
[40:01] yielded and resting what a beautiful
[40:03] picture of a consecrated Christian
[40:05] yielded Christ working through you Paul
[40:08] said for me to live as Christ and to die
[40:12] as gain not me that live anymore but
[40:15] Christ that lives in me Christ Living in
[40:19] the individual soul
[40:21] surrendered Christ speaks through the
[40:24] lips thinks through the mind sees
[40:27] through the eye acts through the
[40:29] temperance Hallelujah then the things of
[40:32] the world has passed away how can it be
[40:34] anything but sweet and pleasant all the
[40:36] time Christ has got control amen you see
[40:41] it that's what it is it's Christ in you
[40:44] Christ in you I believe it to be the
[40:46] truth brother Brenham that's right it's
[40:49] here it has to come
[40:55] here
[41:00] why are people so tossed
[41:03] about and that's in
[41:06] 1956 God in us Soul y'all don't get
[41:10] scared you just got to ask God to help
[41:13] us amen amen that's what he said he said
[41:15] if you know he said you ought to be Hing
[41:17] out and screaming out God help us that's
[41:19] what this message is trying to get us to
[41:22] do cry out God could never help Israel
[41:26] in Egypt until they cried out and God
[41:29] can't help you until you cry out that's
[41:32] why he putting the pressure some of us
[41:34] amen don't want to give you know I used
[41:35] to have a
[41:36] boy I spank him real good and he you
[41:40] know what he do ball his mouth up like
[41:43] and you could hit him go he wouldn't
[41:45] make a sound he was determined to
[41:48] outlast that
[41:50] switch but that ain't what God want I
[41:53] wanted repentance not stubbornness
[41:56] the weaping was to break his spirit so
[41:59] he could repent that's why God sometime
[42:02] to us to break us so we can repent but
[42:06] if you're stubborn longlasting is the
[42:08] whipping amen
[42:12] amen if you don't repent cuz that's what
[42:15] it's all about the chastisement of the
[42:18] Lord is to bring repentance and in our
[42:21] age Jesus said according to Revelations
[42:23] 3 be zous to repent know it's the truth
[42:27] you you watch your child when they've
[42:28] done wrong and they really break down
[42:30] and say but Dad Mom you know I really
[42:32] didn't mean to do it you're not going to
[42:34] spank them cuz what they giving you is
[42:37] what you was looking for they already

[42:41] that's how God listen even God said
[42:43] watch how fast Ahab
[42:46] repent and he was a he repented
[42:51] fast but he tried to get Jezebel to
[42:53] repent but she

[42:59] whooping she's been whipped ever
[43:02] since you know but we've been born into
[43:05] this eternal Church age and you know the
[43:07] thing about it is you don't have to fret

[51:08] it come on
[51:10] somebody y'all better know y'all better
[51:13] know y'all better know cuz it's going to
[51:15] come down to that it's coming it's
[51:19] coming now how you going to escape it
[51:21] without those true
[51:23] virtues huh how are you going to Escape
[51:25] that without those two virtues how you
[51:28] going to escape saving yourself without
[51:31] God in you cuz remember Jesus said if
[51:33] you save yourself you lose it right when
[51:37] it when it goes down he said that's
[51:39] what's going to happen to the
[51:40] denomination that's how they get the
[51:41] mark of the beast oh you can continue to
[51:44] have your home you can continue to have
[51:46] your job you can continue to do this but
[51:49] you got to do this see all right you and
[51:53] I don't y well I my grandbaby she's not
[51:56] here but she I might might embarrass her
[51:58] but she like to say either I'm hungry
[52:00] I'm or I'm
[52:03] starving and now she like watermelon
[52:05] like her Grandpa the other day I was
[52:07] with her she said well Grandpa why don't
[52:09] we just go by Walmart and get a
[52:13] watermelon I told I was going to get a
[52:15] one so I got to get a one by tomorrow
[52:17] but my point is amen you know
[52:21] it's you look at this stuff and and I'm
[52:24] going tell you you see these little
[52:25] children don't you know the children in
[52:27] the people in the uh Smyrna age they had
[52:30] to give their children up to all kind of
[52:31] deaths and everything else and they
[52:33] couldn't even get
[52:35] angry they had to portray
[52:39] Christ huh they weren't they they
[52:41] weren't fighting back brother said they
[52:43] even
[52:44] ran to the slaughter because that was
[52:47] the anointing on
[52:50] them and whatever the anointed is which
[52:53] is Eagle if you want to call it eagle or
[52:55] you want to call it Joshua wherever you
[52:57] are that's what will anoint
[52:59] you is that all right I I'm just saying
[53:02] all these things because I don't want
[53:03] you to think that God's packing us with
[53:05] these virtues for
[53:07] nothing God ain't going to give you all
[53:09] of this for nothing am there's a reason
[53:11] why he said we got to have it because if
[53:14] we are in the Joshua Ministry we must
[53:17] amen come to a complete Victory conquer
[53:20] everything in the land he said whatever
[53:23] you don't conquer will become your
[53:24] torment amen so you and I must die with
[53:28] the Enemy and how you going to do that
[53:30] but
[53:31] pray you can't add a cub toe the statue
[53:35] but when you pray the Bible said you got
[53:36] to pray believing that God will give you
[53:39] what you ask
[53:41] for can I'm going read one more
[53:44] scripture coming from Galatians please
[53:47] the fourth chapter he said but when the
[53:50] fullness of time was come God sent forth
[53:52] his son beginning at the fourth verse
[53:54] made of a Woman made under the law to
[53:57] redeem them that were under the law that
[53:59] we might receive the adoption of sons
[54:02] and because you are Sons God have sent
[54:04] forth the spirit of adoption into your
[54:07] hearts crying Our
[54:09] Father wherefore Thou Art no more a
[54:12] servant but a son and if a son then an
[54:15] heir of God through Christ and then
[54:17] brother Bram comes along he says if
[54:18] there was a line of Angels standing in
[54:20] line as for a request he said who and
[54:22] his son comes up which one he was sent
[54:26] answer first he says a
[54:29] son so even if Heaven is busy you still
[54:32] be able to jump line cuz you're a
[54:36] son amen oh my
[54:40] God is that all
[54:42] right how be it when you knew not God ye
[54:45] did service unto uh them which by Nature
[54:49] are no Gods but now after that you have
[54:52] known God or rather are known of God how
[54:55] how turn ye again to the weak and begly
[54:57] elements where unto you desire again to
[55:00] be in
[55:04] bondage now ain't that amazing because
[55:06] he's saying listen even with that Born
[55:08] Again experience he was absolutely
[55:11] dealing with people who had a desire to
[55:13] turn
[55:15] back he said You observe days and months
[55:17] and times and years and that's what they
[55:19] do in the
[55:20] message Brethren I beseech you be as I
[55:24] am for I am as ye are ye have not
[55:27] injured me at all you know how through
[55:30] infirmities of the flesh I preached the
[55:32] gospel unto you at the first my
[55:34] Temptation which was in my flesh ye
[55:36] despise not nor reject it but receive me
[55:40] as an angel of God even as Christ Jesus
[55:44] where is then the blessedness ye spake
[55:46] of for I bear you record that if it had
[55:49] been possible you would have plucked out
[55:51] your eyes and have given them to me and
[55:55] that's what brother said that was Paul's
[55:56] Affliction it wasn't in his side it was
[55:58] in his eyes when the um light struck him
[56:02] he was blinded but when the when he
[56:05] received sight his eyes constantly ran
[56:08] you know it's kind of like having sore
[56:09] eyes all the time and that's why he said
[56:12] you would have given me your own
[56:15] eyes
[56:18] right is that
[56:21] okay and I am therefore become your
[56:23] enemy CU I tell you the truth they
[56:26] zealously affect you but not well yay
[56:29] they would exclude you that you might
[56:31] affect them but it is good to be zous
[56:34] affected always in a good thing and not
[56:37] only when I am present with you my
[56:39] little children of whom I travail in
[56:42] birth again unto Christ be formed in
[56:45] you now he said I'm travail I travail in
[56:50] birth again until Christ be formed in
[56:54] you that don't mean like he's saying
[56:56] some praying a uh saying a prayer sound
[56:59] like he's praying a
[57:01] prayer right I desire to be present with
[57:05] you now and to change my voice for I
[57:07] stand in doubt of you tell me ye that
[57:10] desire to be under the law do you hear
[57:12] the law the do not do you not hear the
[57:15] law for it is written that Abraham had
[57:18] two sons the one by a bondman and the
[57:21] other by a Freeman what's he saying
[57:23] don't you hear the law there was w a
[57:25] Bond woman and there was a free the Bond
[57:27] woman was a type of the law the free
[57:30] woman amen is by
[57:32] Grace oh but he was uhhh but he who was
[57:36] of the Bond woman was born after the
[57:37] flesh but he that is uh of the free
[57:40] woman was by what promise not because
[57:44] you travailed but because it was
[57:46] promised to you that's how come you get
[57:48] it amen
[57:51] promised oh come on somebody it's
[57:54] promised to
[57:55] see knock knock Lord who is it this is
[57:58] your son Isaiah what you come for my
[58:04] promise that's how you knock on to Door
[58:07] my
[58:10] promise you promised me I've been
[58:12] baptized in Your Name Lord Jesus amen
[58:15] you promised me amen how long do you do
[58:18] it to you get it right like one of those
[58:21] whining
[58:23] children amen
[58:25] which things are an allegory for these
[58:26] are the two covenants for the one from
[58:28] the Mount Si which gender to bondage
[58:30] which is
[58:31] agar for this AAR is Mount Z and AR
[58:35] Arabia and answer to Jerusalem now is
[58:38] and is in bondage with her children and
[58:41] you know what I looked up Arabia Arabian
[58:43] it means mixed and that's exactly what
[58:45] the uh uh uh uh uh ishmail was he was a
[58:50] mix so therefore he became an Arabian
[58:53] hello uh come on come on somebody I'm
[58:55] working spiritually with this thing
[58:57] because I'm like you can't mix world and
[59:01] God you still in
[59:03] bondage but Jerusalem is is above is
[59:06] free which is the mother of us all for
[59:10] it is written Rejoice thou bearen that
[59:12] beareth not bring forth and cry thou
[59:14] that travaileth not for the desolate
[59:16] have many more children than she which
[59:19] have an
[59:20] husband now we Brethren as Isaac was are
[59:24] the the children of Promise are
[59:26] you I've been promised a Rapture I've
[59:29] been promised to come into the full
[59:31] stature of Christ I've been promised to
[59:33] be capped off with the ceiling of divine
[59:36] love I've been promised Hallelujah you
[59:38] promised me you swore by yourself that
[59:41] he that begun the good work in me is
[59:43] faithful to complete you swore Lord and
[59:46] here I
[59:47] am send the
[59:49] fire burn everything out of me build
[59:52] your character don't y'all feel it build
[59:55] your character in me step by step take
[59:57] me through it I know it might be tough
[59:59] but you said you gave me the victory
[1:00:02] through my Lord and Savior Jesus
[1:00:05] Christ but as then he was born after the
[1:00:07] flesh persecuted him that was born after
[1:00:09] the spirit even so is it now
[1:00:12] nevertheless what sayith the scripture
[1:00:13] cast out the bonds woman and her son but
[1:00:16] the son of the bondswoman shall not be
[1:00:18] Heir with the son of the free woman and
[1:00:20] you know what brother Ram said he said
[1:00:21] po little haar say she did nothing wrong
[1:00:24] said she thought she was doing
[1:00:25] everything
[1:00:27] right say she didn't ask amen for uh
[1:00:30] Abraham it was Sarah that did that to
[1:00:32] her and all she was doing was being an
[1:00:34] obedient slave and now she being kicked
[1:00:36] out because she misunderstood that's
[1:00:38] what he said and he said but God heard
[1:00:41] her
[1:00:42] cry now if God can hear a Bond woman cry
[1:00:45] what about you he surely will do it amen
[1:00:48] in in the tribulation period when those
[1:00:50] foolish virgins crying out he's going to
[1:00:53] hear them somehow they going to make
[1:01:00] it he gave them
[1:01:03] something to die and not curse
[1:01:09] God nevertheless what sayth the
[1:01:12] scripture cast out the bonds woman her
[1:01:14] son for the son of the bonds woman shall
[1:01:15] not be AED with the son of the free
[1:01:17] woman he didn't say she wouldn't be a
[1:01:19] they just wouldn't be HS
[1:01:21] with right cuz you I tell you what look
[1:01:24] at all all what the bonds woman got over
[1:01:26] there they got all the
[1:01:31] oil Adam AR's got everything over there
[1:01:34] come on somebody they gifted they smart
[1:01:37] they they they
[1:01:42] wow did God keep his promise are they a
[1:01:46] mighty nation the scripture say there so
[1:01:48] mighty said every nation they be hated
[1:01:50] of and is that the true today everybody
[1:01:53] hate them
[1:01:56] so then brethren we are not children of
[1:01:57] the bound but of free Stand Fast
[1:01:59] therefore the Liberty whereby Christ
[1:02:01] have made us free and be not a tangle
[1:02:03] again with the Y let me ask you
[1:02:04] something do you really think any of
[1:02:06] those Arabs can be
[1:02:08] saved I'm so glad y'all know y'all word
[1:02:12] the Bible said every every tongue
[1:02:14] Kindred and Nation even when we get to
[1:02:16] heaven we'll see some pygmies
[1:02:20] there everybody will be there yes sir I
[1:02:24] forgot what message there is and I don't
[1:02:26] understand that but he said everybody in
[1:02:28] heaven Won't Be Giants either so there
[1:02:30] must be some there
[1:02:36] too I don't understand it but I heard
[1:02:38] him say it so you know every giant
[1:02:42] wasn't
[1:02:43] bad so you know what I mean it it's like
[1:02:46] Rahab coming out where she was
[1:02:48] right it's like Mo you know mo over
[1:02:51] there in Ruth and all you know they
[1:02:53] might have been mixed in up all that but
[1:02:55] the Bible said the Lord knoweth them
[1:02:57] that are
[1:02:58] his hey somebody I thank God for his
[1:03:01] grace let's stand by the grace of
[1:03:05] God we're almost done but I I want to I
[1:03:08] want to touch the next time on on uh
[1:03:11] some things that uh even brother Keith
[1:03:12] shared with me uh and and the same idea
[1:03:15] had been thought thinking about but uh I
[1:03:17] I won't even say what it is but I'll let
[1:03:19] you come look
[1:03:20] at you know I I share like this people I
[1:03:24] put it this way and he'll know what I'm
[1:03:25] talking about there's always going to be
[1:03:27] a spirit of frustration trying to
[1:03:30] frustrate
[1:03:32] you it was for Israel and it will be for
[1:03:37] you and you've got to be determined
[1:03:40] because I'm G tell I'll give you a
[1:03:41] little bit because s balet means
[1:03:44] strength and S balet was a a moabit
[1:03:48] therefore he was a real close King to
[1:03:51] the Jewish
[1:03:52] people right and you got to understand
[1:03:55] by the grace of God that this
[1:03:58] frustration don't come in a weakness it
[1:04:01] comes in strength and the whole thing is
[1:04:04] to frustrate you oh I've giving up it
[1:04:06] ain't gonna work how can I no you can't
[1:04:08] do nothing except the Lord build a house
[1:04:12] you you build in vain anyhow all right
[1:04:15] amen so understand who's building the
[1:04:17] house so and and and you know it it's
[1:04:21] amazing CU When I was looking up some of
[1:04:23] the stuff I really got excited because I
[1:04:26] can see the spirits that we're now face
[1:04:28] where even in this message people are
[1:04:31] saying these virtues of what we're doing
[1:04:34] here are trying to get over to you is
[1:04:36] not
[1:04:37] necessary and understand who tobia was
[1:04:40] you know who toaya was he was he was a
[1:04:42] fake
[1:04:44] Jew he come out of Babylon come on
[1:04:48] somebody he came out of Babylon with
[1:04:51] zerubabel which mean born in Babylon
[1:04:54] right so they come
[1:04:56] out of the
[1:04:59] churches like we did looking like us
[1:05:03] acting like us but down the road they
[1:05:06] find out that their name is not on the
[1:05:10] book amen so they go back like believe
[1:05:14] the
[1:05:16] sign and they join with Sam ballot to
