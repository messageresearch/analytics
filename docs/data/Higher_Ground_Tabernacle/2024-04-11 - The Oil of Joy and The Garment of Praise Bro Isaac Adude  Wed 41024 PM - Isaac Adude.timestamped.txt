[38:11] said Heen he
[38:14] Judah all ye inhabitant of
[38:18] Jerusalem and Thou King
[38:21] Jehosaphat th sayth the
[38:24] Lord unto
[38:26] you
[38:28] Be not Afraid nor
[38:31] dismay by reason of this great
[38:36] multitude amen for the
[38:39] battle is not
[38:41] yours but
[38:43] God Amen Be not
[38:46] Afraid amen be not
[38:49] dismayed amen because the battle is not
[38:52] yours amen but it's
[38:55] God Amen you shall not need to fight in
[38:58] this
[39:00] battle amen set
[39:03] yourselves stand
[39:05] still and see the salvation of the Lord
[39:08] with
[39:10] you oh Judah and
[39:13] Jerusalem fear not nor be dismayed amen
[39:18] because
[39:19] tomorrow go out against
[39:22] them and the Lord will be with
[39:25] you amen you shall not need to
[39:29] fight in this
[39:32] battle set
[39:34] yourselves stand you
[39:36] still and and see the salvation of the
[39:40] Lord oh Judah and
[39:43] Jerusalem amen the prophet said that you
[39:45] have to replace X by its
[39:49] value amen here is talking about Judah
[39:51] and
[39:53] Jerusalem amen and tonight we're talking
[39:55] about Higher
[39:56] Ground ground amen oh Higher Ground oh
[39:59] Higher Ground fear
[40:01] not nor be
[40:03] dism amen
[40:05] tomorrow go out against them for the
[40:09] Lord will be with
[40:10] you amen tomorrow go out against
[40:15] them amen for the
[40:17] Lord is in
[40:19] you amen do not be
[40:22] dismayed do not
[40:24] fear don't fret
[40:27] God is with you amen you don't need to
[40:31] fight the battle is not
[40:34] yours but it's the
[40:37] Lord amen that was the
[40:40] word that the prophet told
[40:43] them amen it was this th sayth the
[40:46] Lord amen so we have to agree on one
[40:49] thing
[40:51] here amen the prophet says a prophet is
[40:54] a reflector of godet
[40:58] amen he's made he's made so that he
[41:01] cannot speak his own
[41:06] words amen he has to be God's words that
[41:10] he
[41:12] speaks he's just like a
[41:16] reflector and he is God's
[41:19] mouthpiece amen a prophet is a reflector
[41:22] of
[41:23] God he's made so that he cannot speak
[41:26] his own word
[41:29] amen so that everything that the prophet
[41:32] says amen it's coming from the
[41:34] Lord amen it doesn't matter even if it
[41:37] says th th sayth the Lord or
[41:40] not amen it's coming from the Lord you
[41:44] say where brother Isaac where here the
[41:47] prophet says that this is my
[41:50] opinion well it's coming from the
[41:53] Lord amen remember
[41:55] Paul when he was talking about
[41:57] marriage amen Paul says that this is me
[42:00] Paul
[42:01] talking amen but the same Bible
[42:04] says every scripture is inspired by
[42:08] God Amen so everything that the prophet
[42:11] says is inspired by God Amen he's God's
[42:15] mouth
[42:16] P amen what is the prophet telling
[42:20] us Amen in redemption in completeness
[42:22] and
[42:25] joy paragraph 63
[42:29] amen he says that
[42:30] now to every
[42:32] believer born child of
[42:36] God when death comes stealing to the
[42:41] door Prophet says
[42:44] prematurely amen he said that the angel
[42:46] of God stands between you and
[42:52] sickness now if you want to run into
[42:56] it
[42:58] that's your
[42:59] business but you don't have
[43:02] to see he's standing between
[43:06] you and death amen every time you
[43:10] sick the angel of God is standing
[43:14] between you and
[43:16] death amen so it's your decision
[43:19] now amen you have to
[43:21] choose are you going to run run into
[43:25] death or are you going to be on the
[43:27] Lord's
[43:29] Side amen but not one thing that the
[43:33] angel of the Lord is standing between
[43:34] you
[43:36] and amen that is what the prophet of God
[43:39] is telling us amen so when you're
[43:42] sick amen believe that you have God in
[43:45] your
[43:46] son believe that your sickness amen you
[43:49] can't have healing for your
[43:52] sickness amen because you have a hidden
[43:54] Authority in
[43:56] you
[43:58] amen the prophet here
[43:59] says now the only thing you have to do
[44:04] then amen is to have faith in what you
[44:09] are and have or maybe it's have to have
[44:12] faith in what you
[44:14] are have faith in what the word says you
[44:20] are amen have faith in what you
[44:23] are and have faith in what the word says
[44:26] you are
[44:28] amen here I like the way the prophet
[44:30] just say
[44:31] it amen because it's covering
[44:35] everything amen you don't have faith
[44:37] about what you are
[44:40] yourself amen because you don't know
[44:42] what you are
[44:44] yet amen the prophet did not stop
[44:47] there he said that have
[44:50] faith in what the word says you
[44:54] are amen the word of God says that you
[44:56] are the Son of
[44:58] God so have faith in
[45:01] that amen the word of God says amen you
[45:05] are a priest and a king and a
[45:08] king amen so have faith in that amen so
[45:13] have faith in the what the word said you
[45:16] are amen and you will see everything
[45:18] coming to pass in your
[45:21] life amen so when you go through your
[45:24] trials amen ask yourself a question
[45:28] who am
[45:29] I amen and after you have the answer to
[45:34] that amen you will see that your
[45:36] attitude will
[45:37] change amen because if you realize that
[45:40] you are the Son of
[45:42] God Amen you know that you can go to
[45:44] your
[45:45] father amen at any
[45:48] moment amen
[45:50] anywhere amen you will ask him for
[45:53] something amen he's going to give it to
[45:55] you amen if you know that you are amen
[45:58] if you find the answer that you are a
[46:01] king amen a kingdom is not a
[46:05] democracy amen a
[46:07] kingdom amen it's dict
[46:12] dictatorship amen what the king
[46:15] says amen that's what will be done amen
[46:18] it doesn't matter if you agree or
[46:21] not amen amen if you say well I know
[46:25] that you know sometimes a king can't
[46:26] have a
[46:28] battle amen that he cannot
[46:31] overcome amen then you can switch by
[46:33] being a
[46:35] prince amen because when you're a
[46:38] prince amen your father is a
[46:41] king am and if God is your king amen
[46:45] there is no
[46:47] battle there is no battle that he can't
[46:51] overcome amen there is no battle amen
[46:55] that he can't win amen there is no
[46:58] Kingdom oh there is no Kings amen
[47:02] stronger than him amen so have faith in
[47:05] what the word says you
[47:06] [Music]
[47:07] are Isaiah 61 verse1
[47:13] to3 amen the spirit of the Lord God is
[47:16] upon
[47:19] me because the Lord has anointed me to
[47:22] preach Good Tidings unto the
[47:25] weak
[47:29] amen he has sent me he has sent me to
[47:31] the to Blind the
[47:35] Brokenhearted to Proclaim Liberty to the
[47:41] captives and the opening of the of
[47:43] prison to them that are
[47:51] bound to proclaim the acceptable year of
[47:54] the
[47:55] Lord and the day of Vengeance of our
[47:59] God to comfort all that
[48:03] mourn to appoint unto them that morning
[48:07] Zion Amen to give unto them beautiful
[48:12] ashes the oil of joy for
[48:16] morning the Garment of Praise for the
[48:18] spirit of
[48:20] heaviness that they might be called
[48:23] Trees of
[48:25] Righteousness
[48:28] the planting of the
[48:30] Lord that he might be
[48:34] glorified amen the spirit of the Lord is
[48:36] upon
[48:38] me amen has anointed me to preach Good
[48:44] Tidings unto the
[48:47] meek am man he had sent me to to to to
[48:51] sent me to Blind up the the to Blind up
[48:53] the
[48:55] Brokenhearted
[48:57] Amen to Proclaim Liberty to the
[49:00] captives amen so if you feel yourself
[49:03] that you're in captivity
[49:07] tonight amen there is liberty for
[49:10] you amen God is able to break all the
[49:14] chains amen look at Peter in
[49:17] prison amen he was all he was there all
[49:22] bound amen he was there Bound in all the
[49:25] chains
[49:27] amen but when the angel of the Lord
[49:30] came amen he broke all the
[49:33] shackles amen he broke all the chains
[49:36] amen and set him free amen so it doesn't
[49:39] matter the prison where you find
[49:41] yourself
[49:42] in amen believe that God is able to set
[49:45] you
[49:47] free amen he will set you
[49:50] free amen God is
[49:52] able amen so the reason why the church
[49:55] is not happy today
[49:59] amen it's because we have forgotten all
[50:01] the
[50:04] victories amen we have forgotten all our
[50:08] victories amen we we have forgotten once
[50:10] what we once
[50:13] were am like that eagle like that crow
[50:16] that was that was B that was bound that
[50:19] was in
[50:22] chain amen he was so in chance for so
[50:25] long
[50:27] amen he forgot how to
[50:30] fly amen he still had his his his wings
[50:35] with
[50:36] him amen his wings weren't cut
[50:40] off amen but he was in that situation
[50:43] for a long
[50:45] time he was in his trials for a long
[50:49] time amen he got comfortable with
[50:52] it amen he lost his
[50:55] identity amen he forgot who Jesus
[50:59] was amen he forgot who Jesus
[51:02] is amen he forgot that he still had
[51:06] wings amen sometimes we find ourselves
[51:08] in that same
[51:10] situation amen your faith is still in
[51:13] you amen for you to wake up amen it's
[51:17] Faith amen for you to drive from one
[51:20] point to another it's
[51:22] Faith amen for you to come to church
[51:25] it's faith
[51:27] amen but you find yourself in the
[51:29] situation where you find where you are
[51:30] in so
[51:32] long amen you've been in your trials for
[51:34] a long
[51:35] time amen you've forgotten the test of
[51:39] Victories amen amen you have forgotten
[51:42] what God is to
[51:44] you amen you have forgotten who Jesus is
[51:47] to
[51:48] you amen you you made yourself
[51:51] comfortable amen like the children of
[51:54] Israel amen they were so comfortable in
[51:57] Egypt amen they couldn't see the
[51:59] blessings that were in front of
[52:02] them amen they wanted to go
[52:05] back amen instead of enduring a little
[52:07] bit little a little
[52:09] while amen so God doesn't
[52:12] change amen if it was just the same God
[52:16] yesterday amen he's still the same God
[52:19] today the reason is amen we stopped
[52:23] trusting him am the reason is is amen we
[52:28] stop having faith in
[52:30] him but we have to be like job amen it
[52:34] doesn't matter if the day is getting
[52:37] harder amen I'm
[52:39] praying amen but my children's are
[52:42] dead amen I'm praying every day amen my
[52:46] cattles are
[52:48] [Applause]
[52:50] gone amen I'm praying every day amen my
[52:53] body is becoming sick my body is
[52:57] becoming
[52:58] sick amen but still my faith will not
[53:03] change amen because it's rest on the
[53:05] Solid
[53:06] Ground amen it's on the solid it's on
[53:09] the Solid
[53:11] Rock Amen the prophet said that that's
[53:13] what's the matter with the church
[53:16] today man we're too long forgotten that
[53:19] Jesus Christ is the same
[53:23] yesterday today and forever
[53:27] we forgot that our God Is A
[53:30] Healer amen can make the sick
[53:33] well amen we forgot that the baptism of
[53:36] the Holy Spirit was poured out upon the
[53:42] disciples amen and given from generation
[53:45] to
[53:47] generation for
[53:49] anybody whosoever will whosoever will
[53:53] could
[53:54] come amen we for for gotten
[53:57] that amen long long
[54:00] ago amen we've forgotten that God is our
[54:04] healer amen now we're fine with we're
[54:08] fine with taking pills every day I mean
[54:10] I'm not nothing against
[54:16] it amen but we forget sometimes that God
[54:19] can heal
[54:21] you amen you feel so comfortable with
[54:25] it you have a set
[54:29] schedule amen that every morning I have
[54:31] to take this and
[54:33] that amen and if you if you miss one or
[54:37] an hour
[54:39] pass amen you're so worried about what
[54:41] will happen to
[54:44] you amen so what about
[54:48] God what about God Amen he's still able
[54:51] to heal
[54:52] you amen he's still able to recover you
[54:55] to give you back back your
[54:57] strength amen he's still able to give
[55:00] you back your good
[55:02] health amen we just have to trust
[55:05] him amen we just have to believe
[55:08] him amen it seems
[55:11] like the Christian
[55:14] Life if the fellow is not absolutely
[55:18] centered in is not absolutely set on
[55:20] Christ centered on
[55:25] Christ the Christian life seems like or
[55:29] holds so many
[55:35] disappointments but those
[55:37] disappointments are God's Divine will
[55:40] happening for
[55:44] us now it don't seem like it it don't
[55:47] seem like it will be
[55:51] that but it's God's way of doing
[55:55] things amen he lets us hit the
[55:58] [Music]
[56:00] river to see what we will
[56:03] do amen he let us get to those
[56:08] point where we feel like there is no
[56:10] more
[56:12] hope amen where we feel like there is no
[56:14] more
[56:15] solutions amen just to see our
[56:19] reactions amen look at the Hebrew
[56:22] children amen they stood for God amen
[56:27] but yet the king ordered that the the
[56:29] fire be HED seven times harder than it
[56:32] was
[56:35] before amen certainly they were hoping
[56:37] that to God for God to intervene before
[56:39] they got to the
[56:42] fire amen but God brought them to that
[56:46] point amen just to see what they will
[56:50] do amen just to see their
[56:53] reaction amen and because they stood for
[56:55] God
[56:57] amen God stood for them amen God was
[57:01] there to quench the fire for
[57:03] them amen look at

[1:03:58] heavens I looked on
[1:04:01] Earth amen I went back to
[1:04:04] history amen still I couldn't find
[1:04:07] somebody who was like
[1:04:09] you amen so that that the the the
[1:04:13] writers said that to write the love of
[1:04:17] God is
[1:04:19] impossible amen because it will stretch
[1:04:22] from Sky to
[1:04:24] Sky amen you might start saying it
[1:04:28] today amen you will never
[1:04:31] finish you can have it town a thousand
[1:04:34] years to praise
[1:04:36] him you will never get
[1:04:39] bored amen because his merci is renewed
[1:04:42] every
[1:04:45] morning amen and as long as his Mercy is
[1:04:47] renewed every
[1:04:51] morning amen I will always have a reason
[1:04:53] to praise him
[1:04:58] amen amen the prophet here says the last
[1:05:01] quote before we so that we can
[1:05:05] close amen he says in the in the Victory
[1:05:09] Day He said
[1:05:11] now don't fail
[1:05:14] this don't fail to get
[1:05:18] this when you have a trial or a
[1:05:24] test it shows the grace of God has
[1:05:30] found you found favor with
[1:05:35] God and God
[1:05:39] believes that you will stand the
[1:05:43] test amen he says that don't fail don't
[1:05:45] fail to get
[1:05:48] this when you have a
[1:05:51] trial when you have a
[1:05:53] test amen when everything looks like
[1:05:57] there is nothing good coming out of
[1:06:01] this it says that he only
[1:06:05] shows he only shows the grace of God has
[1:06:12] found that you found favor with
[1:06:16] God and God
[1:06:18] believes that you stand the
[1:06:21] test because I believe the Bible
[1:06:24] says that God doesn't give us trials
[1:06:27] that is beyond the ability to overcome
[1:06:33] it amen even though he gives us trials
[1:06:36] that is not beyond our ability to
[1:06:41] overcome amen he will always make a way
[1:06:43] of Escape for
[1:06:46] us amen so what you have to
[1:06:49] do just
[1:06:52] rest amen just rest
[1:06:56] because

[1:07:21] it is the high priest of our
[1:07:24] confession
[1:07:27] amen so the price has been
[1:07:30] paid amen he paid the price of the
[1:07:33] Redemption amen he died on the
[1:07:37] cross Amen on the third day he came
[1:07:41] out Amen on the cross he cried
[1:07:43] everything is
[1:07:46] fulfilled amen which means everything
[1:07:48] that you can think
