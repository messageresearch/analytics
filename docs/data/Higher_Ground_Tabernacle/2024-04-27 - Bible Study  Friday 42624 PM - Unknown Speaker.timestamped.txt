[3:52] amen amen all right so um I'm just going
[3:56] to be we're just going to be reading um
[3:59] the book of
[4:00] isra or Ezra um my mic is a little bit
[4:04] too
[4:06] loud yeah so we'll just um if we can
[4:10] open our Bible to
[4:12] Ezra so um it's pretty much just talking
[4:15] about the
[4:16] temple um like
[4:21] the con like rebuilding the second
[4:25] temple um Ezra chapter 3 can can you put
[4:30] that
[4:39] here it's after the the it's after
[4:42] second
[4:57] chronicles and when when if everybody's
[5:00] there we'll just get
[5:12] started are we all there all right
[5:15] praise God let's get started um it says
[5:18] and when the seventh month month was
[5:20] come and the children of Israel were in
[5:23] the cities the people of God uh the
[5:27] children of Israel wereing this is the
[5:28] people gather them El together as one
[5:30] man to Jerusalem then stood up Jo Joshua
[5:34] the son of
[5:36] Jos and his Brethren and the priest and
[5:39] zerubabel the son of Shel Tiel and his
[5:43] Brethren and builded the altar of of the
[5:47] god of Israel to offer burn of to offer
[5:51] burnt offerings thereon as it is written
[5:54] in the law of Moses the man of God so
[5:56] what we're going to be doing is we're
[5:58] just going to be like
[6:00] commenting like verse after verse you
[6:02] know so here like to to to talk about
[6:06] what what is happening here is that um
[6:08] the children of Israel we've been
[6:10] studying on the book of Jeremiah lately
[6:12] and um like I'm just fast forwarding
[6:16] after Jeremiah they went into captivity
[6:18] in Babylon and then after the Captivity
[6:21] um this is like after they came back
[6:23] from captivity and uh they wanted to
[6:25] rebuild the Temple you know cuz like
[6:28] when the the Babylonians took over the
[6:31] cities of Jerusalem they had destroyed
[6:34] the first temple that King Solomon had
[6:35] built and here now we see that they had
[6:39] a desire to restore the the the AL the
[6:42] the temple you know and the first step
[6:44] here in restoring or rebuilding the
[6:47] temple we see that they had builted the
[6:50] altar in verse two he says and build
[6:53] building the altar of the god of Israel
[6:56] to offer burnt offerings thereon as it
[6:59] is written in the law of Moses the man
[7:01] of God so we understand here that the
[7:04] first step when building uh the temple
[7:07] of God was to build the altar you know
[7:10] and um and we're also going to try to
[7:12] apply it in a spiritual sense too you
[7:14] know we're not just going to talk about
[7:15] the physical because this is the shadow
[7:18] of of what is happening in the spiritual
[7:20] right so like um the prophet of God says
[7:24] in this quote um he says in Christianity
[7:28] versus I idolatry says may he be the one
[7:31] that fills their Temple he was praying
[7:34] and he was and he said and then the
[7:36] power and fire of the Holy Ghost will
[7:38] fall on the altar of their heart there
[7:41] is where the real altar is Lord is on
[7:44] the hearts of each individual you know
[7:47] so the real the real altar we understand
[7:49] that is in the heart of every individual
[7:52] you know so um our body is the Temple of
[7:56] the Holy Ghost you know and then the the
[7:58] devil like
[8:00] just like the devil destroyed the first
[8:02] temple he tried to destroy this Temple
[8:04] and now God wants to build this Temple
[8:06] you know he wants to build a spiritual
[8:08] uh house where he can come and dwell in
[8:11] the first step to building that we
[8:13] understand is is to build the altar you
[8:16] know that's what the that's what uh the
[8:18] children of Israel did and the altar is
[8:20] in your hearts you know the next quote
[8:23] also I have another quote he says um
[8:27] then they come to the first altar and
[8:29] the first altar is where they is where
[8:32] they burns the sacrifice and where the
[8:35] Lord met them there in forgiveness of
[8:37] sins and cleanse them from all their
[8:41] unrighteousness and the burning altar
[8:43] the Brazen altar burns the Beast and the
[8:46] blood from the Beast that was the second
[8:48] court so on that first altar the prophet
[8:51] is saying that's where they were burning
[8:52] the sacrifice you know uh like uh that
[8:55] that's where they met the Lord for
[8:57] forgiveness of their sins you know clean
[8:59] them from all their unrighteousness so
[9:01] the first step when you're trying to
[9:02] rebuild this Temple of the Lord you have
[9:04] to meet God where do you meet God you
[9:07] meet him in your heart you know in your
[9:09] heart and then you ask him to forgive
[9:11] him to forgive you for your sins you
[9:13] know and you ask him to cleanse you
[9:15] that's the first step and uh if we keep
[9:18] reading um uh verse three he says and
[9:22] they said the altar in the book of isra
[9:26] can you put isra do you say isra or Ezra
[9:29] Ezra
[9:30] okay can you put Ezra chapter
[9:33] 3:3 here we go and they said the altar
[9:38] upon his bases for fear was upon them
[9:41] because of the people of those countries
[9:44] and they offered burn offerings there on
[9:46] unto the Lord even burn offerings
[9:49] morning and evening they kept also the
[9:51] Feast of the Tabernacles as it is
[9:53] written and offered the daily I I'll
[9:56] just skip forward to I'll I'll skip to
[9:59] verse six it says uh from the first day
[10:03] of the seventh month began they to offer
[10:07] burnt offerings unto the Lord but the
[10:10] foundation of the Temple of the Lord was
[10:13] not yet laid you know so we understand
[10:16] that they were they they had built an
[10:17] altar but yet the foundation of the of
[10:20] the Temple of the Lord was not yet laid
[10:23] and they gave money also unto the Masons
[10:26] and to the carpers
[10:29] and um Can someone else read this like
[10:33] uh brother brother Isaac can you read
[10:35] this they gave money also the Mas to the
[10:38] Carpenters and meat and drink and oil
[10:41] unto them of zidon and to them of Ty to
[10:45] bring cedar trees from Lebanon to the
[10:47] Sea of Jaa according to the grant that
[10:50] they had of Cyrus King of
[10:53] Persia what verse is
[10:57] that okay can we
[11:00] skip to verse n
[11:03] yeah
[11:06] thenu Kel and his sons the sons of Judah
[11:11] together to set for set forward the
[11:14] workmen in the house of God Sons
[11:17] ofad with their sons and their the
[11:21] Levites okay verse um
[11:24] 11 no actually verse 10 sorry yeah and
[11:27] when the builders laid the foundation of
[11:29] the Temple of the Lord they set the
[11:32] priest in their apparel with trumpets
[11:35] and the Levites the sons of Assa with
[11:39] symbols to praise the Lord after the
[11:42] ordinance of David king of Israel okay
[11:45] so here like they when the the the
[11:48] builders laid the foundation of the
[11:49] Temple of the Lord the Bible is telling
[11:51] us that they started singing they
[11:52] started praising rejoicing right and
[11:55] verse 12 it says but many of the priests
[11:58] and Levites and chief of the fathers who
[12:02] were ancient men that had seen the first
[12:05] house when the foundation of this house
[12:07] was laid Before Their Eyes they wept
[12:10] with a loud voice and many shout shouted
[12:13] aloud for Joy so that the people could
[12:17] not discern the noise of the shout of
[12:20] Joy from the noise of the Weeping of the
[12:22] people for the people shouted with a
[12:24] loud shout and the noise was heard a far
[12:27] off so like verse 12 here it's telling
[12:30] us that there were some people ancient
[12:33] men like people that had like they they
[12:35] they old people you know they they
[12:37] experienced the first temple they they
[12:39] saw the glory of like we'll read the
[12:41] book of hegi right after this he he
[12:44] explains more what what is happening in
[12:45] this chapter CU like the chapter of the
[12:48] book of hegi
[12:50] Zechariah uh Ezra all those like it is
[12:54] happening around the same time so like
[12:56] verse 12 those ancient men they started
[13:00] weeping you know they started weeping
[13:02] because uh yeah we'll understand why
[13:05] they start they were weeping when we
[13:07] read the next uh uh book but um but what
[13:11] kept my attention here is that he says
[13:13] that uh there was a like they couldn't
[13:17] tell between the shout of joy and the
[13:20] Weeping there was a confusion you know
[13:23] there was like something like like some
[13:25] it was an uncertain sound like they they
[13:28] couldn't tell which one you know uh
[13:30] there was a confusion and what what was
[13:32] the confusion happening around that was
[13:34] at laying of the foundation right the
[13:36] Bible says that's when the builders laid
[13:38] the foundation on verse 10 after that
[13:40] then some people were crying and some
[13:43] other people were rejoicing but they
[13:45] couldn't tell which like what the sound
[13:48] was you know that's the same thing
[13:50] that's happening like that that that cuz
[13:53] we we're going to try to look at it
[13:56] physical and spiritual at the same time
[13:58] that's the same thing that's happening
[14:00] in our like in our day Lord like when
[14:03] the the Bible what the foundation of the
[14:06] Lord let just read uh the book of um I
[14:10] have this in my notes Here one
[14:13] second U chap Matthew chapter 16 verse1
[14:17] 17 and 18 cuz we're talking about laying
[14:20] the foundation right and then the Bible
[14:22] now let's let's see what the foundation
[14:24] is like in the Book of Matthew uh
[14:27] chapter 16:1 17 and
[14:30] 18 and the Bible says and Jesus answered
[14:33] and said unto him blessed are thou Simon
[14:36] bjah for flesh and blood has not
[14:39] revealed it unto thee but my Father
[14:41] which is in heaven can you uh go to the
[14:44] next one and I say unto thee that thou
[14:47] are Peter and up on this rock I will
[14:50] build my church and the Gates of Hell
[14:53] shall not Prevail against it so we
[14:55] understand that the revelation of Jesus
[14:57] Christ of who Jesus Christ is is the
[15:00] foundation because Christ is building
[15:03] his church up on the revelation of who
[15:04] he is right
[15:07] so just like here there was a confusion
[15:09] there that's the same thing that that
[15:11] that's why like the devil tried to to
[15:14] change that that Foundation oh the name
[15:16] of Father Son and Holy Ghost or or like
[15:18] all those those those those things
[15:20] happening around the name of Jesus
[15:22] Christ right confusion but then we have
[15:24] a prophet that came and you know um
[15:28] showed us that like it's it's only one
[15:30] name it's the name of the Lord Jesus
[15:31] Christ so uh that kind of caught my
[15:33] attention that verse you know that that
[15:36] there was a confusion when they were
[15:37] laying the foundation and
[15:41] um um uh if we go to if we keep reading
[15:44] the book of Ezra chapter
[15:47] 4 um because we understand that in
[15:50] chapter 4 there came like ad adversary
[15:54] adversity or opposition to the children
[15:56] of Israel you know like when they
[15:58] started building in the temple uh then
[16:01] they came like like they had to fight
[16:03] you know because like let just read what
[16:06] the Bible says verse one now when the
[16:09] adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard
[16:12] that the children of the Captivity
[16:14] builded the temple unto the Lord God of
[16:17] Israel then they came to zerubabel and
[16:20] to the chief of the fathers and said
[16:23] unto them let us build with you for we
[16:26] seek your God as ye do and we do
[16:29] sacrifice unto him since the days of
[16:33] aseron king of Asher which brought us up
[16:38] here you know so we understand that
[16:41] there came like like the Bible called
[16:43] them adversaries in another uh version
[16:46] of the Bible I think the NIV says
[16:47] enemies you know the enemies of the
[16:49] children of Israel came they wanted to
[16:52] join them you know that's that's a
[16:54] tactic of the devil you know the prophet
[16:57] uh we'll read this one quotes where the
[16:59] Prophet says that Satan comes and tries
[17:01] to to use un Unity as his tactic you
[17:04] know we want to use the United Church
[17:06] they won't let us builds together after
[17:08] all we seek we serve the same God you
[17:10] see the Bible says here they say for we
[17:13] seek your God as you do you know they're
[17:15] saying that let us just unite because we
[17:18] after all we serving the same God right
[17:21] and uh uh like and that's that's what
[17:23] the devil is doing too in our in our day
[17:27] and um
[17:30] let's just read his quotes
[17:40] here chur
[17:44] Chans
[17:48] right exactly amen amen exactly so like
[17:54] like like let's read this one quote here
[17:55] where it says that um okay I have this
[17:58] here he says notice his plans is to
[18:02] build a super denominational Church the
[18:05] World Council of churches see a super
[18:09] denominate so that all the world will
[18:12] worship Him the Beast under the name of
[18:15] United Christianity that's what that's
[18:18] what these people Tred to do they were
[18:20] like they're saying we we we seeking the
[18:22] same God as you do but later on like the
[18:24] Bible says by their fruits you shall
[18:26] know who they are later on you you will
[18:28] see how they reacted toward the children
[18:30] of Israel it proved that they weren't
[18:32] serving the same God you know and um cuz
[18:35] like they like just like brother Isaac
[18:37] says oh come join this church come join
[18:39] this church and they they they try to to
[18:41] get us to believe that we are serving
[18:43] the same God we are actually not because
[18:46] in the Book of Revelation Christ is on
[18:48] the outside knocking you know he's
[18:50] knocking he's like he want to come in so
[18:53] then if he's on the outside then who are
[18:55] they worshiping right you know the the
[18:57] the devil has put them under that
[18:59] illusion that they're they're worshiping
[19:01] God they think they're worshiping God
[19:03] but they're not worshiping God right
[19:05] like the prophet says in the Satan's e
[19:07] and he says the God of this world today
[19:11] the the worshiped person of this world
[19:13] today is Satan and the people are
[19:16] ignorant of worshiping Satan but it's
[19:19] Satan impersonating himself as the
[19:21] church see as the church they worship
[19:24] Satan thinking that they are worshiping
[19:26] the god worshiping God through the
[19:29] church but it's the way Satan has done
[19:32] it right so like the prophet is telling
[19:35] out that those people they out there
[19:37] worshiping Satan but they think that
[19:39] they're worshiping God you know U okay
[19:43] let's see they think cuz and then that
[19:46] that that is um like I won't I won't
[19:49] quote it but it's in Revelation chapter
[19:51] 3:14 to20 where Jesus says that behold I
[19:54] stand at the door and knock and if any
[19:56] man hear my voice and open the door I
[19:57] will come in
[19:59] uh to him and will stop with him and
[20:01] hear with me you know so we understand
[20:03] that Christ is on the outside right and
[20:06] um um second can you go to Second
[20:09] Thessalon Thessalonians uh chapter 2
[20:12] verse 3-
[20:17] 4 where it says let let no man deceive
[20:21] you by any means for that they shall not
[20:24] come except there come except there come
[20:27] a falling away first and the man of sin
[20:30] be revealed the son of predition the no
[20:34] it says the man of sin be revealed so
[20:37] can you you go to the next verse
[20:39] here who opposeth and exalteth himself
[20:43] above all that is called God or that is
[20:46] worshiped so that he as God Seth in the
[20:50] temple of God showing himself that he is
[20:53] God that's what that that's who they are
[20:56] worshiping that person who is like
[20:58] showing him himself as if he God he's
[20:59] impersonating God and those people
[21:02] without Revelation they are thinking
[21:03] that they are worshiping Christ but
[21:05] Christ is on the outside you know and
[21:07] who is Christ Christ is the word you
[21:09] know right so the word is on the outside
[21:12] knocking trying to get in but they have
[21:14] their own illusion that's so and they
[21:17] want to use the the same tactic let's we
[21:19] all Christian after all we're serving
[21:20] the same God no the word of God calls
[21:22] for separation with all unbelief God is
[21:25] a god of Separation right so if we
[21:27] continue to book of Ezra verse three but
[21:31] zerubabel um and Joshua and the rest of
[21:35] the of the chief of the fathers of
[21:37] Israel said unto them ye have nothing to
[21:40] do with us to build an house unto our
[21:43] God but we ourselves together will build
[21:46] unto the Lord God of Israel as king
[21:49] Cyrus the King of Persia has commanded
[21:51] us so we understand that zerubabel told
[21:53] them that you have nothing to do with us
[21:56] you know this is our inheritance this is
[21:59] what we're supposed to do right so he
[22:01] turned down um uh the offer from the
[22:04] world right so let's let's move on verse
[22:09] four and six uh can someone read verse
[22:12] four and six
[22:15] um any volunteer yeah you
[22:19] can then people of the land weak of
[22:24] people of
[22:25] Judah them build
[22:28] and hired counselors against them to
[22:31] frustrate their purpose all the days of
[22:34] Cyrus King of Persia even until the re
[22:37] of Darius King of Persia right yeah so
[22:40] so now we see what their their int
[22:42] intentions were right because you don't
[22:45] you we you don't want to join us then
[22:48] they they weaken the hands of the people
[22:50] you know hire counselor against them to
[22:52] frustr their purpose isn't that what the
[22:54] council ecumenical ecumenical council
[22:58] will do if we don't join us then you
[23:00] guys cannot worship anymore you you can
[23:02] we'll close the churches the Bible the
[23:04] prophet says that they'll be there'll be
[23:07] like the the pressure The Squeeze will
[23:09] be on on for the bride right you know
[23:11] they'll TR they'll start pressuring us
[23:14] because they were not of us in from the
[23:16] beginning you know so that's the same
[23:18] thing that's happening here and if we
[23:20] skip to verse 11 um interesting there
[23:24] says and they H counselors like lawyers
[23:28] right right con
[23:30] amen amen amen yeah so if we Skip and
[23:35] and we like I want read everything but
[23:37] like we understand that they are um so
[23:40] they they wrote a letter to the king you
[23:42] know
[23:43] to again like say negative things about
[23:46] the children of Israel and verse 11 it
[23:48] says this is the copy of the letter that
[23:51] they sent unto him even unto
[23:54] Ares the king thy servant the man on his
[23:58] side be known unto the king that the
[24:00] Jews which came up from thee to us are
[24:03] come unto Jerusalem building the
[24:05] rebellious in the bad City and have set
[24:07] up the walls I think I'll just skip this
[24:10] uh it just it's a lot of accusation
[24:12] false accusations against the children
[24:14] of Israel and um let's skip to verse 23
[24:19] and verse 24 now when the copy of King
[24:25] of the king's letter was read before rum
[24:28] and shimshai The Scribe and their
[24:30] companions they went up in haste to
[24:32] Jerusalem unto the Jews and made them to
[24:35] cease by force and power then ceased the
[24:39] work of the house of God which is at
[24:41] Jerusalem so he ceased unto the second
[24:44] year of the reign of Darius King of
[24:47] Persia you know so and then they oh
[24:52] after all we seeking the same God let us
[24:54] build the house of the Lord together no
[24:56] you guys wanted them to ceased because
[24:59] now because you couldn't work together
[25:01] then you the work of the house of God
[25:05] ceased you know it stopped pretty much
[25:08] right and um if we continue verse uh
[25:12] chapter 5 verse one then the prophet
[25:14] hegi the prophet and Zachariah the son
[25:17] of Ido prophesied unto the Jews that
[25:20] were in Judah and Jerusalem in the name
[25:22] of the god of Israel even unto them then
[25:26] rose up zurubabel
[25:28] the son of
[25:29] Shel and Joshua the son of jedak and
[25:33] began to build the house of God which is
[25:36] at Jerusalem and with them were the
[25:39] prophet of God helping them right so
[25:42] like uh and and to understand the word
[25:46] that God uh spoke through the prophet
[25:48] hegi let's go to the book of hegi uh
[25:52] chapter
[25:56] one there go chapter
[25:59] one so we understand that if we like for
[26:02] instance Ezra chap chapter 5 verse 2 it
[26:05] says that then rose up Zer zerubabel the
[26:08] son of
[26:10] Shel you know and um and they started
[26:13] building the house of the Lord but the
[26:14] word that encouraged them was hegi
[26:16] chapter 2 verse one in the seventh month
[26:20] in the 1 and 20th day of the month came
[26:23] the word of the Lord by the prophet hegi
[26:26] saying speak now to zer the son of Shel
[26:30] governor of Judah and to Joshua the son
[26:33] of joseth the high priest and to the
[26:37] resid of the people saying who is left
[26:39] among you that saw this house in her
[26:42] first uh glory and how do you see it
[26:46] now is it not in your eyes in comparison
[26:51] of it as
[26:53] nothing and this I think from from what
[26:56] my Bible is referring like it's giving
[26:58] reference to Ezra chapter 3:12 so it's
[27:01] like when the the ancient men were
[27:04] crying you know for what they were
[27:06] seeing so like the B God is saying that
[27:11] who is left among you that saw this
[27:13] house in her first glory and how do you
[27:16] see it now is it not in your eyes in
[27:18] comparison as nothing yet now be strong
[27:23] oh Zer sayth the Lord and be
[27:26] strong oh oh I was read reading I was
[27:28] reading chapter 2 so I meant to read
[27:31] chapter 3 so chap this chapter 2 was in
[27:33] reference to like I said earlier Ezra
[27:35] 3:12 but let's go to uh chapter 3
[27:38] actually that's what I meant to read
[27:40] wait chapter 1 verse
[27:43] three hey chapter 1 verse3 yeah because
[27:47] we we stopped at Ezra chapter 5 verse
[27:50] one where the Bible says that you know
[27:52] there that cease to uh the work of the
[27:54] work of the temple and then the prophet
[27:57] had and Zechariah prophesied and then
[28:01] zerubabel started building the Temple so
[28:03] now let's read the word of that prophecy
[28:06] um chapter 1 verse 2 thus speaketh the
[28:09] Lord of host saying these people say the
[28:12] time is not come the time that the
[28:14] Lord's House should be built so that's
[28:17] what the children of Israel were saying
[28:19] when the the the work ceased they
[28:20] started thinking that oh the time is not
[28:22] come yet to build the Temple of the Lord
[28:24] you know now God didn't didn't like that
[28:27] God rebuked them because in verse three
[28:30] God is saying then came the word of the
[28:32] Lord by hegi the prophet saying is it
[28:35] time is it time for you or ye to dwell
[28:39] in your sealed houses and this house lie
[28:43] waste you know now therefore thus sayith
[28:47] the Lord of host consider your ways you
[28:49] know go like the children of Israel they
[28:51] were just their priorities were not
[28:53] straight their priorities were just like
[28:55] taking care of their own houses you know
[28:58] and God is saying you guys are dwelling
[29:00] in Seal sealed houses and then my house
[29:03] is lying laying waste you know and he
[29:05] says ye verse six ye have sown much and
[29:10] bringing little ye eat but you have not
[29:14] enough you drink but you are not filled
[29:17] with drink you clothe you but there is
[29:20] none warm and he that earnthenecklace
[29:28] sayith the Lord of hosts consider your
[29:30] ways right so he's saying that like you
[29:34] you never you're not satisfied you drink
[29:36] you're not satisfied you eat you're not
[29:38] satisfied and and then you work but then
[29:41] it's like all the money that that that
[29:43] you work you just you can't even save
[29:45] you can't even do nothing with your
[29:47] money why because your prior their
[29:49] priorities were not straight you know
[29:51] the God was saying that you they should
[29:52] have taken care of also the house of the
[29:54] building the house of the Lord you know
[29:56] that's the same thing that's happening
[29:57] to there even with the spiritual house
[30:00] you know if you if you don't many of us
[30:03] we we we
[30:05] only like we're so worried about the
[30:07] things of like our like making sure that
[30:09] the garden the the grass is well taken
[30:13] care in the house you know the house is
[30:14] clean but what about this spiritual
[30:16] house God also want us to be to to work
[30:20] on this spiritual house to you know to
[30:22] build this house you know and um that so
[30:25] that was the same thing because I mean
[30:27] and then God told them consider your
[30:29] ways right go up to the mountain and
[30:31] bring wood and build a house and I will
[30:33] take pleasure in it and I will be
[30:36] glorified sayth the Lord so we
[30:38] understand that God is glorified and
[30:40] takes pleasure when we invest in
[30:42] building this this this house right you
[30:45] know this Temple and you look you look
[30:48] for much and L it came too little and
[30:51] when you brought it home I did blow it
[30:53] up on it why sayth the Lord of hosts
[30:56] because of mine house that is
[30:58] waste and you run every man onto his own
[31:01] house you know I like to read this in
[31:04] the NIV version like I just like the way
[31:07] he um he explained that uh NIV version
[31:12] okay let me go
[31:13] here so verse
[31:17] seven all right so let's go verse seven
[31:20] this is what the Lord Almighty says give
[31:22] careful thoughts to your ways go up into
[31:25] the mountains and break bring down
[31:27] Timber and build my house so that I may
[31:30] take pleasure in it and be honored sayth
[31:32] the Lord you expected much but see you
[31:36] turn out to be little what you brought
[31:38] home I blew away why declares the Lord
[31:41] Almighty because of my house which
[31:44] remains in ruin while each of you is
[31:47] busy with your own house you know I like
[31:49] the way he said it here each of you is
[31:51] busy with your own
[31:56] house oh yeah
[31:58] house amen bring into the amen we all
[32:03] worried about our own building our
[32:09] own amen
[32:11] amen amen any other
[32:14] comments amen so but that so that that's
[32:17] that's pretty much it right you know we
[32:19] we God is honor and pleased when we we
[32:22] invested in spiritual things you know
[32:24] like set your affection on things above
[32:27] right and and if we continue reading
[32:30] here it says that uh therefore Because
[32:34] Of You the heavens have withheld their
[32:37] due and the Earth its crops I called for
[32:41] a draw on the field and the mountains on
[32:44] the grain the new wine the olive oil and
[32:47] everything else the ground produces on
[32:50] people and livestock and on all the
[32:53] labor of your hands right so God you can
[32:56] even create a drought you know on on the
[32:58] works of your hand just because you you
[33:01] you not setting your priorities on
[33:03] things of above you know he God wants us
[33:06] to build this house you know to build
[33:08] this spiritual house you know and um
[33:12] yeah let's go back to um Ezra
[33:28] I think we almost at the endend uh Peter
[33:30] can I get the charger for my
[33:33] laptop it's about to go
[33:36] there but I'll just send this to my iPad
[33:39] so I can use it from my
[33:49] iPad yeah I'll just do it from
[33:56] here sorry about
[34:26] that so we are chapter 5 Ezra okay can
[34:30] someone read chapter
[34:34] 5 yes the first verse I believe is that
[34:37] where we left
[34:39] off
[34:42] three no I don't think we read three yet
[34:45] cuz that's talking about the
[34:48] Govern oh okay okay
[34:52] okay yes yes yes can you please at the
[34:56] same time to them T governor on this
[35:00] side of this side of the river and
[35:03] sheth BOS and their Companions and said
[35:07] thus unto them who hath commanded you to
[35:10] build this house and to make up this
[35:13] wall then said we unto them after this
[35:16] manner what are the names of the men
[35:19] that make this
[35:20] building the eyes of their God was upon
[35:23] the Elders of the Jews that they could
[35:25] not cause them toase till the matter
[35:28] came to
[35:29] Darius and then they returned answer by
[35:33] letter concerning this man right so so
[35:36] we see that like despite so like because
[35:39] the after the the work of the Lord had
[35:42] ceased God we just read the rebuke that
[35:46] God rebuked the children of Israel
[35:47] because they they were thinking that oh
[35:48] it's not time to BU at the house of the
[35:50] Lord yet but they had time to build
[35:52] their own houses right and then when the
[35:55] word of the Lord said that um zerubba
[35:57] was encouraged and he started building
[36:00] the the temple again right zerubabel and
[36:02] Joshua but then an opposition came again
[36:05] to show you that every time you want to
[36:08] work on build this Temple of the lord
[36:10] the devil will always try to fight you
[36:13] you know and like like we just read this
[36:16] time around that was another governor
[36:17] who said who gave you who who has
[36:20] commanded you to build this house then
[36:22] he wrote another letter to the king and
[36:25] we won't have time to read the entire
[36:27] letter
[36:28] I think it's in verse seven that they
[36:30] said they they sent a letter unto him
[36:32] wherein was written thus unto darus the
[36:34] king of all peace and then let's skip to
[36:38] verse
[36:40] 17 Ezra 5:1
[36:44] 17 now therefore if it seem good to the
[36:48] king Let There Be search made in the
[36:51] king's treasure okay now let's read
[36:54] verse oh yeah verse 17 so this is after
[36:57] they send the letter to the king you
[36:59] know the the the king he asked um
[37:03] zerubabel and Joshua you know like like
[37:06] I heard about this and that what are you
[37:08] guys saying and this is no this is the
[37:10] letter that they sent to the king saying
[37:12] to the king that if it seem good to the
[37:15] king Let There Be search made in the
[37:17] king's Treasure's house which is there
[37:21] at Babylon whether it be so that a
[37:25] decree was made of Cyrus the king King
[37:27] to build this house of God in Jerusalem
[37:31] and let the king send his pleasure to us
[37:34] concerning this matter so what they were
[37:37] saying is that search because God God
[37:40] you know when God ask you to do anything
[37:42] he's he's provided he's given you
[37:45] everything you need already you know
[37:47] like God had inspired King Cyrus to
[37:50] write a decree and to store it in the
[37:53] treasures house because he knew that one
[37:55] day King s will will be dead but then
[37:59] his writing will be what will will
[38:01] counts right and but I what I love the
[38:05] most is when you go back to chapter one
[38:07] you know you just said it was King Cyrus
[38:09] but his word was inspired by the Lord
[38:11] you know so like the B because the Bible
[38:14] the Bible says in chapter one if you can
[38:17] read just like the first verse I think
[38:18] chapter one of that same book now the in
[38:21] the first year of Cyrus King of Persia
[38:24] that the word of the Lord by the mouth
[38:26] of Jeremiah might be for fulfilled the
[38:28] Lord stirred up the spirit of Cyrus King
[38:32] of Persia you know that he made a
[38:35] proclamation throughout all his kingdom
[38:38] and put in also in writing saying right
[38:40] so it was the Lord that led King Cyrus
[38:43] to so it was it was an inspiration from
[38:45] the Lord in other words and and we know
[38:47] that the Bible says that all scripture
[38:49] is written you know by inspiration right
[38:52] so like and if we go back to this
[38:54] chapter five then zerubabel he asked
[38:58] okay let's search in the scriptures you
[39:00] know we want to build this Temple of the
[39:02] Lord there there's going to be an
[39:04] adversity that's going to arise and
[39:06] every time the adversity arises let's do
[39:09] like zobel let's let's refer back to the
[39:12] scripture what does the scripture what
[39:14] what does the decree say about this
[39:16] house this this this house right that's
[39:18] what they did and then later on on
[39:20] chapter six uh then Darius the king made
[39:23] a decree and search was made in the
[39:25] house and you can read this chapter 6 on
[39:28] your own but it's like amazing how like
[39:31] this King Darius he he even he even said
[39:34] he also made another decree saying that
[39:36] they can now build the house and that no
[39:40] one should add a word or or take a word
[39:43] take away a word from the new decree
[39:46] pretty much just like the re Revelation
[39:48] says no one should add to this word or
[39:50] take away from the word of God right and
[39:52] then they and then uh verse 14 and the
[39:56] Elders of the Jews builded and they
[39:59] prospered through the pro prophet
[40:01] prophesying of hegi the prophet and
[40:04] Zechariah the son of Ido and they build
[40:07] it and finished it according to the
[40:09] Commandment of the god of Israel and
[40:11] according to the Commandment of Cyrus
[40:14] and Darius and AR cus the King of Persia
[40:19] right so they they they they build it
[40:21] the house and they prospered through I
[40:24] love this they prospered through the
[40:25] prophesying so this the
[40:28] the they prospered through the spoken
[40:30] word through the word of God that's how
[40:32] they were able to build that their house
[40:35] the same way that they were able to
[40:36] build the house through the word of the
[40:38] prophet in the physical way we also are
[40:41] able to build this house upon the spoken
[40:43] word of God you know with the help of
[40:45] the spoken word of God you know that you
[40:47] got to keep reminding yourself
[40:49] scriptures you know and
[41:26] us it's that
[41:55] spoken amen
[41:58] true amen
[42:04] amen them to cease this time the second
[42:08] time they didn't listen they kept amen
[42:11] and so they had to so they kept working
[42:13] they had to send a letter to the king
[42:15] keep working amen the house amen amen
[42:18] amen and then and then I didn't even
[42:20] read the the other chap the entirety of
[42:22] chapter in hey but like the reason why
[42:25] they were able to do this is because the
[42:27] Lord encouraged them to tell them I am
[42:29] with you you know they they were fearing
[42:31] they they had a lot of things that were
[42:33] going through their mind but the Lord
[42:34] reassured them that I am the Lord and
[42:36] I'm with you and that's why now they
[42:39] have courage they have boldness to even
[42:41] write back to the king hey they they
[42:43] started reminding them of the promises
[42:46] you know and um you know like just to to
[42:50] to close it to summarize it like uh I
[42:53] was saying that this this time around
[42:55] we're not building physical houses or
[42:57] physical temples you know it's your body
[43:00] it's your your like let's let's go to
[43:02] the book of Acts 7 verse
[43:05] 46
[43:10] um he says who found favor before God
[43:14] and desired to find a tabernacle for the
[43:18] god of Jacob but Solomon built him in
[43:21] house how be the most high dwelleth not
[43:24] in temples made with hands as sayith the
[43:27] prophets Heaven is my throne and Earth
[43:30] is my foot stool what house will you
[43:32] build me you know sayith the Lord or
[43:35] what is the place of my rest so God is
[43:38] still looking for a house to be built
[43:40] for him right and um 1 Corinthians
[43:44] chapter 3:16-17 the Bible says that know
[43:48] ye not that you are the temple of God
[43:51] and that the spirit of God dwelleth in
[43:53] you if any man defile the temple of God
[43:56] him shall God destroy for the temple of
[43:59] God is Holy which Temple ye are you know
[44:03] God wants to build you into his full
[44:07] stature like into the stature of a
[44:09] perfect man and um I'll just read this
[44:20] um
[44:22] really the only thing that separate us
[44:25] from other denominations
[44:30] amen amen only God's
[44:34] not you're better in the
[44:37] amen amen
[44:40] God knows
[44:44] amen amen
[44:55] amen amen can you can you uh hide this
[44:59] uh I want to project the
[45:05] quotes it's not showing if if you go can
[45:09] you go to open
[45:10] LP no go to open LP where we put the
[45:22] songs but yeah it's it won't work but
[45:25] anyway let me just read read it
[45:28] just I I just wanted to show the the um
[45:33] the statue of a full perfect man and you
[45:36] know like that's the that's the temple
[45:39] that God wants to build right you know
[45:41] Faith virtue knowledge Temperance
[45:44] patience godliness broadly kindness Holy
[45:47] Spirit and love you know and you know we
[45:50] have to keep working till all these
[45:52] things are are there you know and God
[45:55] promised us that he's with us the good
[45:57] thing is that we not even the ones doing
[46:00] everything like you know the Bible says
[46:02] that he who started the good work his
[46:04] faithful to finish it you know so it's
[46:07] like those are the promises that we need
[46:08] to to remind ourselves right and um cuz
[46:12] that God is building a bride body you
[46:14] know she the prophet says she will be uh
[46:17] she will be the word made flesh um if
[46:21] can you go to the the the last quot
[46:23] Peter
[46:28] I'll just do it here
[46:37] open well it's not it's
[46:40] not but anyway uh the last quote says
[46:42] this it's in the message it is the
[46:44] rising of the sun um paragraph 111 it
[46:49] says and as he being the groom the bride
[46:53] has come forth has to come forth cuz
[46:56] it's part of him and he can only be the
[46:59] manifestation of the fulfill fulfilling
[47:01] of the
[47:02] revelations any others has spoken of the
[47:06] Bride it can only manifest if if it does
[47:10] something different from the groom it
[47:12] isn't the bride because she is flesh of
[47:15] his flesh bone of his bone life of his
[47:18] life power of his power she is him you
[47:22] know so like Christ is he wants to build
[47:26] himself
[47:27] pretty much you know and uh because like
[47:29] the full stat of a perfect that's that's
[47:31] Jesus Christ right there you know that's
[47:33] all his character he had all this Faith
[47:36] virtue all that that was Jesus Christ
[47:38] and he want us to be like him because
[47:40] the bride we just read the prophecy say
[47:41] she is him you know the Book of
[47:43] Revelation chap 21: 2-3 it says and I
[47:47] John saw the holy city New Jerusalem
[47:50] coming down from God out of Heaven
[47:52] prepared as a bride Adorn for her
[47:55] husband and I heard a great voice out of
[47:58] out of Heaven saying behold the
[48:00] Tabernacle of God is with man and he
[48:02] will dwell with them and they shall be
[48:05] his people and God himself shall be with
[48:08] them and be their God right so um that's
[48:12] that's this study for today I encourage
[48:14] you guys to keep reading the book of
[48:16] Ezra and Zechariah um I I'll just end it
[48:20] here but like next time if I get a
[48:22] chance we'll read cuz we only read you
[48:25] know when they they stop building the
[48:27] temple the Bible says that zerubabel was
[48:29] encouraged by the prophesying of hegi
[48:32] and Zechariah right and then also
[48:34] Zechariah we see what happens if you can
[48:37] read it at home it's Zechariah Chapter 4
[48:40] Verse
[48:41] 1-4 I love that chapter because that
[48:44] chapter talks pretty much even talks
[48:46] about the seven Church ages talks about
[48:48] the the SE the seventh messenger you
[48:51] know it's just amazing you know it talks
[48:53] about the two olive trees you know and
[48:56] then the old the prophet says he called
[48:57] that the Old Testament and the New
[48:59] Testament you know and it's just amazing
[49:02] next time we'll continue studying on it
[49:04] but I really appreciate your

[49:41] there's a lot of things that God wants
[49:42] to do in the city of Deo but we are so
[49:46] prioritized by other things that he can
