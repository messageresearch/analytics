TRANSCRIPT
========================================
praise the Lord amen that's so true amen it's never failed this amen and if it looks hard keep believing amen keep believing it's one thing God can't do but it's two God cannot fail God cannot tell a lie amen so that's the God we serve with it's good to be back here again we thank the Lord for all you coming out let's just bow our hearts amen Lord how true that song is you never failed us yet and Lord how blessed it is to be able to serve a God who knows no failure who knows no defeat who knows no retreat Hallelujah Lord everything you sought out to do you accomplish and Lord you will accomplish in US Lord and Lord we are so thankful for that and we pray Lord that you would bless the service Lord put your hand upon us as your children as your bride as your wife life Lord and Lord God give us understanding in all that we need to know tonight and Lord in the precious name of Jesus Christ we pray church amen hallelujah if you have your Bibles let's turn to um uh Genesis 6 and then we're going to go to Ecclesiastes one Genesis 6 verse uh let's just start at verse one oh my I'm laughing because before we got here quoted the scripture hey I love Vindication amen hallelujah you see I think sometimes people understand as ministers you always want the mind of God but you're always looking for Lord am I in the right Chan Lord is this what you want me to speak and right before we turn in the parking lot he quoted the scripture amen hallelujah amen he say and verse verse 1 6 And1 Genesis 6 And1 and it came to pass when men began to multiply on the face of the earth and the daughters and the daughters were born unto them that the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair and they took them wives of all which they chose and the Lord said my spirit shall not always strive with man for that he shall for that he also is flesh yet his days shall be a 120 years there were giants in the earth in those days and also after that were the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men and they bear children to them the same became Mighty Men which were of old men of renown and God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth and that every imagination of the thought of his heart was only evil continual and it repenteth the Lord that he had made man on the earth and it grieved him at his heart and the Lord said I will destroy a man whom I have created from the face of the Earth both man and Beast and the creeping things and the fouls of the air for it repenteth me that I made them but Noah found Grace in the eyes of the Lord amen Ecclesiastes one uh let's start at verse 8 Ecclesiastes 1 and8 All Things Are full of Labor man cannot utter it the eye is not satisfied with sin nor the ear full with hearing the things that have been it is that which shall be and and that which is done is that which shall be done and there is no new thing under the sun is there anything whereof it may be said see this is new it have been already of old time which was before us there is no remembrance of former things neither shall there be any remembrance of things that are to come with those that shall come after may the Lord bless the reading of his word you can have your seats today amen my subject by God's grace tonight is finding your place in history finding your place in history but if I can I want to I want to deal with when history repeats itself amen you know some history is good some history is bad amen but I believe us as Believers we got to find our place in what we want to be remembered for amen uh uh not as a person but the spirit behind our lives amen be because behind everything is a spirit amen whether it's good or whether it's bad there's a spirit behind it and there's also some history behind that Spirit Hallelujah now the reason why I read uh uh uh The Book of Ecclesiastes because Solomon Solomon uh uh he said that there's nothing new Under the Sun amen all the things that we're seeing now they've already came Hallelujah and if I can talk I'm going to talk kind of natural some things that we see upon the face of the Earth that have already been here you know if I can talk to the young people you know uh they have styles of uh it's kind of faded out now but different styles ush in you know they they brought back the afro and the cornrows but if you go back into the family album you'll see Mom and Daddy with cornrows and afro Hallelujah that was already was and that same Spirit came back up again hallu you know what it was it was fashion trying to stay relevant amen see so it was a spirit behind it and you look uhh uh uh even in my day Hallelujah we wore uh certain hairstyles what we call a crew cut or a box and you see those very things are coming back now and church what I'm saying is we see a lot of things repeating itself but normally uh uh when you look at at things repeating itself you got to wash the spirit behind it because one thing about Satan Hallelujah Satan cannot create so a lot of times he bring up things that were once popular Hallelujah and he does it all over but one thing I want to show you when it comes to Satan that Spirit becomes more and more wicked more and more evil amen as it repeats it becomes more and more evil you know brother brandom talked about a woman named Sarah B amen and he said that she was a flapper amen her mama was a flapper because her Grandmama was a flapper so he say the only thing the daughter could be would be what her mama and her Grandmama was see history repeated itself now that was the name he called out and as that Spirit moved on that Spirit fell on Marilyn Monroe Hallelujah Same Spirit different vessel but it got more wicked amen see Sarah Bo she was one of the first women who started the natural strip teas started a strip brother Ram say it was a strip teas and it was silent film then she it was just playing a little music and she it wasn't even wasn't even no music it was just a a film where she would go behind a curtain throw her clothes off and the men would be standing there no words coming out of their mouth just a facial expression it was a solid lust it was a silent strip teas but you know as that Spirit moved on it got even more and more wicked from Sarah from sarbo to Mel Monroe Hallelujah it got even more wicked and as the spirit moved on and history repeated itself it fell on Madonna yes sir and got even more even Wicked she started singing songs Like a Virgin oh my can I preach tonight but what was happening church history was repeating itself but it was a spirit of evil Hallelujah and as it came on you notice the Bible said the reason why I read Genesis 6 he said in man's heart was evil continually the more man progressed the more wicked he got the further he got away from God oh my why because history was repeating itself H the prophet of God say he said that he said that God takes the man and leaves the spirit he said Satan does the same thing he'll take the man and leave the spirit amen and you know if I could if I could go down into on the male side now well you might say well uh uh brother digs uh what's so wicked today I call his name out and some of these people I don't know I have no problem with but one thing I know I know a spirit when I see it Hallelujah in church if I call the name out of Justin Bieber Hallelujah I don't know the young man very talented but I've seen that Spirit on him before history is repeating itself why you young people may may may may may may look at that and you may crazy you may be craving the wrong thing that happened years before and some of you adults you may not even know who that is but you've also seen that spirit before it was on a man named Elvis who was a young man had more money than he could control but he was literally losing his mind just like Justin Bieber Hallelujah you say Brother D he had he's a young man he's 19 years old and he has $100 million so was El see The Cadillacs the prophet called his name so the bride is calling a successor to that ministry's name cuz it's the same spirit and even in between there between Elvis and Justin baver you had that spirit that got even more wicked than Michael Jackson you say why is he talking about all these people I'm talking about history I'm talking about the spirit that's following Mankind and you have to know where you want to be identified you have to know what's trailing you what's in your bloodline Hall what's in your family tree amen because history really you know you you can be in a God-fearing family and still have evil in your blood life and if you not careful Hallelujah to be on your knees with God you'll do things that your saved father did you said come on brother he make sense to that Abraham was a man called of God but way down inside Abraham had fear and a lying spirit inside and he was called of God you know what he told a lie when his son matured and got in the same situation he did the same thing his father did told a lie in the same situation this is my sister not my wife H so you know that that Spirit was in the bloodline and he kept following on up Hallelujah and from Isaac Hallelujah who told a lie his son after him told a liot Jacob Hallelujah Jacob lying and cheating ducking and dodging because the spirit of History Hallelujah was following him even though they were quoting God the same God who was in that Father Abraham Isaac and Jacob amen one of those Spirits are going to overcome you you got to be identified with the right kind of History amen but Church even if we look in there Hallelujah Abraham lied Isaac lied Jacob lied don't you know Jacob's boy did the same thing when we say Joseph was perfect but Joseph told a lie that Spirit was laying there so God hallelujah God begin to clean things up amen hallelujah because you don't want to be identified amen with evil Hallelujah and church it moves and it moves moves and it moves we have to be careful Hallelujah that we don't that that we don't take things lightly amen and you notice I I one thing I believe about church amen people are not conscious how they're being affected by their past if I can and you know sometimes you say things and you you're not trying to hurt nobody feelings and and all these things but you're trying to make a point you know every year they celebrate and and I I have no problem with the celebration I have no problem with what it means but you have to be careful of the spirit behind things you know we we celebrate every every every year as a culture MLK MLK Day Hallelujah if y'all know what that is that's that's that's the birth I mean the the the so-called CEO or president of the Civil Rights Movement huah but if you're not careful in your celebration or as parents or whatever you'll be expressing to your children all your pain all your hurt all the things you went through when God has given you Joy why should I tell my kids about I was once a slave when God has blown the Jubilee trumpet God has blowing a jubilee trumpet why shouldn't I be able to tell them you can be whatever you desire be with God on your side so we have to be careful which part of History we're being identified with amen we say where it's black history money amen for us to talk about black history we have to remember White History Hallelujah so in all that we have to be careful we're not bringing up the struggle and you know you have these leaders these leaders nowadays and they say you know I get in trouble for preaching like this amen but my heart is to be transparent amen my heart is to see people have victory in their lives amen you know and they talk about this civil rights movement and they say well the kids don't know what happened in the past and they're not keeping the struggle alive cuz I'm not in a struggle anymore hallelujah hallelujah when the Holy Ghost comes I have victory amen hallelujah only the devil puts things on the skin color of a man God never dealt with that God always dealt with the heart the first the first racism was up in heaven Hallelujah the first racial thought was up in heaven amen Satan looked at God and all his angels and he had envy and hatred and he said I want to be like God I want my own race but what he messed up he put his race on flesh God's race was a gene it was a seed Hallelujah it was something that couldn't be stopped by a water holes it couldn't be stopped by a whip amen hallelujah it was a bloodline Glory Church let me ask you are you keeping God's history relevant amen and we say that same God is here that that that that brought the children of Israel out of their bondage and crossed through the Red Sea I wonder how many of us are standing at a Red Sea in our lives Hallelujah but we're afraid of our history Hallelujah Church you got to be identified with it amen hallelujah Church there will be another shaking h if I can as I'm talking about these Natural Things am me you know I I the reason why I'm talking plain and I'm using a lot of natural things because I want to show you in a nutshell Satan ain't got no power he Ain got no power Church what he does is he digs back you know uh uh in the stores and some of the young ones may know they got this thing called throwback jerseys where they take the stars and the superstars that were once popular like a Magic Johnson who done been out of the league probably over 20 years amen or or or a Michael Jordan another 10 15 years and they begin to put their names back on the line amen and they say wouldn't you love to have an authentic Magic Johnson Jersey Hallelujah magic don't even play anymore but they're trying to keep the spirit behind Magic's life alive and when you keep the ball player alive you keep his adulterous Life Alive you keep the fact that he had AIDS and he cheated on his wife you keep all all these things come along when you accept magic see I read a lot and I you know one thing about the word I'm I'm I'm in this world but I'm not of this world Hallelujah so you know what I do I study the lives of the people that my children are interested in because I want to show them the good and the B hallelujah amen I want to show them if you going to follow this be careful Hallelujah because D Man wasn't faithful how many Hallelujah although he had a nickname like magic he was tragic Hallelujah in his to his wife he was tragic in his relationship Hallelujah he was tragic as a father hallelujah oh my and that's the spirit that stays relevant when they create a magic throwback jersey or even you take you take Michael I the leag for years and all they're doing is comparing him to the next ball player and what they do Hallelujah they say well we going to bring his shoes back so it'll have the same effect that it had on the generation Hallelujah before them and what it does it keeps everything that he stands for alive another adulterous man another another man that you notice all these superstars of old never acknowledge God amen so the the the the the the the the the repeating of their lives is only giving Satan Glory but you got to be careful how you be identified clothes repeat theirselves church have you noticed amen and I'm a man who like to dress up for God but you notice both Ties Are Back In Style Hallelujah history repeating itself amen hallelujah sisters wearing high his shoes and they call them clogs and all kind of things back then they call them stacks and now that's the Le and so forth same old Spirits amen church but it gets more and more wickeder amen now they got this thing is accepted the men and the women called skinny jeans you know where that come from when I was in school they used to be called stretch pants and only the women would wear them but now they call them skinny jeans same devil just more and more wicked that you got the men walking around with tight clothes on now when the Devil comes back around it's more and more wicked oh my so what are we getting ready for I ain't going to be too much longer what are we getting ready for we're getting ready for the wrath of a god who's got tired of what he created look at it homosexuality On The Rise Hallelujah now the the main topics in our government are not about uh uh the well-being of the people it's about rights it's about can this one marry that one and and be accepted and you can't say nothing about it if not Sodom and gomor was here Sodom gomorra is full-fledged here upon the Earth but do we realize history is repeating itself Hallelujah and as we can see the evil being repeated Church in the midst of all that evil somebody found Grace hallelujah hallelujah Noah found Grace in the eyes of the Lord and what I want you to understand God gave Noah the blueprint how to escape come on somebody God has also repeated history he's given us a blueprint a message showing us how to escape the wrath of God that's coming to the hurt Hallelujah people are so caught up with the spirit of pleasure amen and all these things repeating Hallelujah and if you if you still not quite with me think about this one remember like now look at the body style of the Mustang Ford Mustang that body style is not new somebody talk to me it's not new that same style come from the 60s and you know what when they first decided to do that and they put it out in the public that they was going to do it the car was bought before it was even made the car was on back order before they could even produce it why because all the people that loved it then they loved it now and That's what Satan does hallelujah he knows what was popular he knows how to get the people attention church that's why we don't have no new music we got new lyrics over the same beats amen you notice that not Christian music is real hard to find good clean Christian music because they may have good lyrics and good thoughts but they can't make up a beat so they what was popular you never know you may be singing Amazing Grace over a shake ring Roby Hallelujah so you know what that mean that means your worship is not pure Hallelujah see church and you say well back to Justin you say well Justin he's only 19 and that's too much power for a young man that age you know what I've seen that spirit before I've seen a young man with power before but this young man hu was able to hold that power this young man name was Josiah Hallelujah had a kingdom amen the Bible says he went to the left nor to the right but he stayed right with the truth amen I've seen that spirit before where God just poured his riches and His blessings out on a young man Hallelujah but he had the character to keep it amen God there never was a man as wise and as rich as Solomon so don't tell me you can't have the best of the best and still serve God hallelujah Glory there's nothing new Under the St but where do you want to be identified what part of history is following you you know what they say sometimes we anoint our kids you just like your old sorry Daddy and that's what he going to be cuz you missing the adjective you put before Daddy he man said Daddy sorry okay but I must be sorry too you going to be just like your old trifling mama mama trifling but I must be trifling too y'all don't get quiet on me Hallelujah see you anoint the word for your day you got to know how to anoint the word amen God has given us the word we have the word but it's up to you to anoint the word remember when Jesus was sitting in Simon's house H and they wasn't paying him no attention that prostitute came in there and anointed him that prostitute came in there with that Alabaster Box Hallelujah and she said you don't know the price of this oil you don't know what I went through amen I know my past is wicked but I'mma change that today hallu Hallelujah and she would not let history repeat itself like that anymore but she went down a different way Hallelujah Church what happened they said if he knew who was touching him he wouldn't let her Hallelujah but Jesus said leave her alone y'all don't understand the work she's doing upon me Hallelujah she was anointing the word so the word had to give her heart desire Hallelujah Church you got to anoint the word Hallelujah see if you anoint that word that word will give you your heart's desire amen like I said this morning that woman at the well she anointed the word Hallelujah Jesus begin to talk to her and she begin to talk back but you notice Jesus was talking natural and she was talking spiritual he began to talk about the fathers the fathers in the mountain and they don't worship like I worship and then Jesus say how many husbands you got Hallelujah then she be to respond and then she begin to say they say when Messiah coming he G to say these kind of things Hallelujah so Jesus dealt with her in a natural realm to bring out her spirituality Hallelujah and as he talked with her the more he talked with her the more word came out Hallelujah according to history she wasn't supposed to be able to do that but her history was her fathers knew Jacob amen amen her father's Worship in that mountain so Jesus had to come with a word hallelujah and she said I know when Messiah coming she anointed the word all Jesus could say was I am he Hallelujah she anointed the word amen oh my church we got to anoint the word hallelujah had a right anointed the word Amen brother random sitting there talking Hallelujah and he's talking about all the things God has done in his ministry and and Supernatural in the third pool and hi and right just sitting there listening and she couldn't help it no more she said that ain't nothing but the truth and the anointing came down do I got a church in here do I got a church in here hallelujah the prophet of God say she said the right thing she anointed the word and then God the holy spirit says give her whatever she asked forah whatever she won't give it to her he said she said so what should I ask for the prophet of God say I don't know no ask for whatever it's yours he say you got a sick sister she could be here you got children you're poor whatever you ask for but God only sent that anointing because he knew that she had the thoughts of God he knew she wasn't going to ask for me no Hallelujah she asked for salvation Hallelujah and God gave her exactly what she asked for she said Give me the salvation of my boys and you say those boys were snickering and laughing and soon as she said that Hallelujah they started crying Hallelujah and weeping right there the very thing she asked for and she went down in history as somebody we quote to this day church as history repeats itself and it comes back and back and on and on look the reason why they have all these Throwbacks not only just the Mustang the Camaro the charger all these body styles are way back when but now they're keeping it relevant because you know some men when they reach the time of life they say I'm GNA get me a SP I want me a Mustang see oh did you know that that got a spirit behind I'm a Mustang I'm wild I'm a Mustang I'm free I'm a must thing oh my oh a charger oh my I can't be stop I'm a charger Church remember when Anor SW niggga got caught by his wife you know what he said he said I got the money I got the power I can do what I want to do see the the the spirit behind men of renown the spirit behind Hollywood that's why when when when the prophet God preach the invasion of the US where did he start in Hollywood H showing that Paris used to be the leader now we the leader Hall you know and I was saying you look at how history gets more and more wicked y'all know in New York now I'm not saying these things for you to go and look it up because you better be careful you might not can't handle some of the stuff I'm talking about you might go look it up and get a spirit on you Hallelujah Glory Hallelujah go look up go go look up what God did not what the devil did Hallelujah but you know in New York City every year they have ride the subway in your underwear day every year thousands of people get on the subway and the underway and it gets bigger and bigger every year now it's to the point where more countries are doing it on the same day they doing it in New York see it gets more and more wicked more and more more evil and God is looking down on it saying what's about to happen Church he's saying my spirit will not strive with man always now ask yourself is God pleased with your life or was God looking at you saying you know what I hate I even created you boy I know that's kind of stiff but that's the spirit of this age God is looking down at his people and he's he he hated that he even created man because everything they think about the imagination of his heart is evil Wicked you know they started out with arrows and Bows just enough to stop the man now they got things to blow him up in pieces make you even forget he was there they got stuff not there hit the man with he nothing but just some meat laying over there wouldn't even look like a man again but as man getss in his laboratory he his mind Hallelujah because it's unconverted it becomes more and more wicked his thoughts become more and more evil oh my look at it Church Hallelujah we the spirit that's supposed to be on his bride is spoken word Authority we're supposed to be able to speak creation but the spirit we're fighting against is the spirit of man trying to create another man Hallelujah they're in their Laboratories trying to make another man you'll never be able to do it through science Hallelujah because that's God's permissible will hallelujah oh my the original way the way that can and Abel came was God's permissible will that was not God's perfect way Hallelujah if you understand your message H the prophet of God say Eve was supposed to speak her children into creation you said but she couldn't wait and she stepped from behind that Holy Veil and a lust Veil came down oh my church but church we can see all these Spirits moving it's getting more and more wicked and more and more things are coming along you know music now is more uncensored than ever you can't all flip the radio station in your car without some nonsense H and you look at these Gods on the earth Beyonce and and a z hallelujah what they selling they ain't selling music they're selling sex they're selling evil Hallelujah the prophet of God say is death is sin in Disguise Hallelujah Glory so if that's sin in Disguise who are we who are we we're God in Disguise Jesus in Disguise Jehovah passing by where are you being identified amen oh my see and the reason why the enemy comes back and he uses all these things that he's already used before the prophet of God say one of the first songs that came out uncensored was a song that said roll down your stalkings and show your knees he said and now they don't have anything to roll down Hallelujah you know what they say stockings uncomfortable I don't want to a't none of them they they make me hide you know what that is that's the effects of that song I ain't telling you what to do you do whatever you do whatever you do whatever but all I want to show is use the spirit Hallelujah all I want to all I want to do is show you how sub to the devil is amen we think we see these things we see these fashion and we listen to the music and and all this stuff even TV you know brother brand hammered I Love Lucy hammered it and we look at our love L what was he talking about she ain't doing nothing but giggling and laughing whatever else you know but he was watching the spirit you know she was one of the first women to rebel against her husband before a live audience she was the first one to tell her husband no I ain't doing that I make just as much money as you make and I'm going to work he was watching that spirit he was what was he watching he was watching Jezebel Hallelujah telling Ahab what to do oh my and I know you may think D you just so hard it is so hard I want to I want to feel happy this makes me happy Hallelujah to know that God got his eyes on me to know that my past Hallelujah my past does not control my future Hallelujah and because of my past he didn't erase my future hallelujah oh my church look at this the cycle of time swings back ever so often history repeats itself and the scripture repeats itself down through the age and Scholar knows that Hallelujah every study from the spiritual standpoint to watch how scripture will repeat itself Hallelujah run in Cycles you know one thing I pay attention to the prophet of God say every seven years you go through a change from 7 14 21 28 30 is it 32 35 Hallelujah on up 42 49 every seven years you go through a change that what the prophet said amen so you need to look at the cycle of life you in Hallelujah and if you're a Christian your change is supposed to be for the greater and people don't realize they're running from God they're running from God they won't fully Hallelujah surrender themselves and they're trapped in a cycle they're trapped in a cycle of evil and they can't say why I keep doing this because history repeats itself Hallelujah church if you look at how the church went out look at it and I'm about to close look at man's heart was getting more and more evil more and more wicked and God look down on man and he said you know what I'mma destroy I'mma wipe it out the face of the Earth he said I'm G give him a warning first though I'm going send a messenger down there you know what he says but before you even do that somebody's going to experience a Rapture [Music] Hallelujah before he even did that Enoch was gone Hallelujah I wonder is there anybody here already caught up hallu Church The Rapture is a body of Believers the Rapture is a revelation the Rapture is a process am and we are supposed to be that Enoch I'm not Noah I'm not Noah I'm not preparing myself to go through the Judgment Hallelujah that's not my history my history is not Hallelujah some some some a blueprint Hallelujah to go through the tribulation no I'm the Enoch of the Bible you're the Enoch of the Bible amen hallelujah who walked with God Enoch was and was not that's our history our history is to be so in tune with God hallelujah that we will call the Rapture the prophet of God said in this last day the bride will be so much like him that God can't take it no more he's looking down on you and he say man I just I oh man I'm just longing to be with my body I just oh I just oh my head I just can't take it no more I got the put it on my body he's the head right and we're the body what good is a body without a head what good is a head without a body church that's where we are that's what we are look at history amen it's more and more wicked you know what they did some people hallelujah and I ain't going to go this far but you know uh some people when they look at Obama they're comparing him to Hitler H now I ain't never studied and I don't have it don't matter to me one way or another cuz you know they they oh he the Antichrist no he ain't Pope is the prophecy you can say what you want the man made this law made that Law whatever the prophet of the God said the pope is the Antichrist so you can get as mad as you want to be you can look at him and say I can't stand him or whatever just like just like uh uh presidents before Hallelujah they were fulfilling what God wanted to be fulfilled amen Bush did it Reagan did it Clinton did it and now Obama gonna do it so don't get caught up in your feelings cuz your feelings will make you miss the real purpose of God hallelujah that's what happened with Ahab when he walked down there with jiah I mean uh when when je Jehoshaphat and Ahab walked down there to Micaiah he said is there not another prophet in the land Micaiah jehoshaphat's word I mean ahab's words was verbatim yeah yeah there's another Prophet but I don't like him look how stupid that is he acknowledged the man to be a prophet and what is a prophet a seer of God's will he acknowledged it hallelujah hallelujah he he acknowledged it he said yeah he's a prophet but I hate him why because he never says anything good about me what that had to do with the truth see he let his own personal feelings get in the way of the truth and you realize people are doing that in church they're bouncing from this church bouncing from that church cuz they looking at the man of God and they letting their personal feelings get in the way forget that he staying with the message of the hour forget that he preaching the gospel truth forget that he's anointed they worried about his socks they worried about what kind of car he drive nonsense amen as long as the man is stand with the word he's on the word filled with the holy spirit all that other stuff is irrelevant and to show you how silly Ahab was amen they sent the S the S The Messengers down there come down there he said hey should I go up with him he said sure go up power is slapping Ahab didn't I tell you to tell me the truth so what was that saying he knew he wasn't supposed to go he knew he wasn't supposed to go but he let his own personal feelings of who was telling him not to go get in the way and how often we do that in the church we hear the word we hear what we're guilty of but because the vessel is coming from we can't receive don't go down in history like that Hallelujah because he rejected he said I told you to tell me only what God was say he asked for the truth but he really didn't want it and Ahab say okay I will if you even come back he said I see Israel Hallelujah sheep scatter without a Shepherd Hallelujah he said if you even come back God never spoke to me that man would have told me that I would have fell on my knees and say Lord have mercy on me but because it was a spirit of Lou the because it was a wicked spirit that was moving through the church ages who heard the word and still wasn't going to listen still had Pride Hallelujah still was rebellious that's the problem today h Same Spirit I was on Ahab hearing the truth hearing it come from a God-fearing man but they don't like it be careful history going to repeat itself remember what happened to Ahab he went on down there anyway riding on his chair Hallelujah that was his end Hallelujah so church we have to be careful what we're being identified with amen history will repeat itself but in my closing one thing I want you to understand just as God had a Welch Revival there will be a BRI Revival I know people these theologist looking back and saying there there they brother BR say won't be no Revival and this and that and all the stuff of whatever what else is going to get us out of here if we don't have our own personal Revival we going to miss it I ain't talking about a group big churches and people flocking in but I'm talking about you what is a Revival a Revival is a killing a Revival is killing this man hallelujah amen the prophet of God said when the ocean has a Revival what does it do it pushes all the trash outen history repeats itself every time that W go out it pushes some more trash on the bank it do it over and over again what I love about the ocean you study the ocean anything that doesn't belong in there it's going to find its way to the shore you can drop a dead body in there and people I dropped in the ocean I'm I'm free oh my nobody never know and one day that body going to raise to the top it raised to the top and all of a sudden the very thing that you thought was hidden because it don't belong there your secret you thought was hidden in the ocean Hallelujah that sickness Hallelujah you thought that nobody else would see Hallelujah the way the ocean is built the ocean is built to stay clean why because it's preserving life amen and you can't have all that other stuff inside that's why when they have oil spills what happen to the oil push to the shore hallelujah amen you can leave a boat out there with no with no Captain it just out there drifting all by itself and one day it'll find itself what they call it shipwreck the only way it can be wrecked is if it find itself to something and normally that's to another bank amen so let us have our own personal Revival get all the trash out your life Hallelujah go to your DVD collection and clean it out go to your music and clean it out go through your house and clean it out sweep your house Hallelujah because God is about to destroy this place the handwriting is written on the wall if you read your Bible we ain't got much time like me and brother ke was talking about the the the blood moons and so forth all the stuff Hallelujah remember those those those those those signs of the Angels you know the Omega and all that stuff that we saw amen when when when we we came down and preached about the Omega and that angel standing there Hallelujah in the heavens with the sword Hallelujah next thing came was the aligning of the planets Church don't forget your history amen God going to do it again we ain't got much time you know if your kids are still out there pray harder pray harder amen don't give up pray harder if your wife ain't saved yet pray hard don't give up keep being a light amen don't give up because if God Amen remember let me give you a scripture it says the the the Sanctified one sanctify the one that's not saved Hallelujah so you got to keep believing amen you know and they may be caught in a cycle of of of of history but God can break that chain amen my if I us not putting my my my mom and dad on blast but uh my biological parents got a divorce when I was very young so that was in my bloodline but you know what stopped it the Holy Spirit hu that's what stopped it between me and my wife the holy spirit cuz you know what she get angry sometimes I get angry sometimes but there's a great big wonderful awesome Mighty God in the middle of my marriage and he's Hallelujah he's the one that's keeping me alive Hallelujah and see church God has to be the X Factor amen you know people say people say it all the I'm under the blood I'm under the blood I'm under the blood the blood don't save you I know there ain't no skill milk the blood don't save you by faith you are saved the blood keeps you clean the blood keeps you right in God's presence amen cuz when you do wrong there's an atoning there that begins to wash Hallelujah wash the Devil comes and accus and he say oh Richard did this and that blood is laying there wash and washing Hallelujah it keeps you clean it's a covenant where your history doesn't have an effect on your present Glory so Church let's have our own our own Revival Hallelujah when we go down in history as that church you know it's a song I love to hear written by Sher lefonte and it's called are you she and he said they sitting in she said they sitting in heaven you know this is when we when we make it to heaven and she wrote this song like the atmosphere of Heaven what was taking place in heaven after we were raptured and he said that Paul and all the different ones they see us marching up in heaven and they're looking at us saying are you sheep the Bride of the last days hallelujah oh my you know that Peter Paul and James Hallelujah they're looking at US mean a Renown and say that those Jezebels couldn't get us hallelujah that we stayed true to the word of God Amen looking at the sister you know Ruth and eser going to be looking at y'all and say y'all wasn't fooled by The Shining serpent oh my see are you she the Bride of the last days amen well there's a certain portion of History that's only allotted to you amen don't be deceived amen this thing is winding up real fast real fast more and more prophecies is being fulfilled if we could if we could if we could look at it people people don't want to admit it but you look at it right now we're we're right in the midst of the falling away we're right here Church Falling Away people been in this message 30 something years Falling Away turn their backs on don't want nothing to do with it amen amen they're going back saying they're atheist and all these other thing going back to their Lutheran Doctrine he said except the falling away come first we're here Church we're here history is repeating itself we're here so if we could see the falling away what's to happen next what's to happen next God is about to come and get his wife Hallelujah he's sending out the Reapers right now Hallelujah and they're Gathering the wheat Hallelujah they're Gathering the wheat right now the Gathering the Reapers they're Gathering Hallelujah and church we're going into the barn the chaff is going to be burned ain't going to be water this time it's going to be fire and and there's only one thing I disagree with this morning he said there going the book say it's going to be a lot of noise it's going to be streaming in hell and it's going to be streaming in heaven but there one place he left out that's also going to be streaming in the tribulation now thing we got to decide in my closing is you got to decide where you want to make your stream I don't know about you but mine ain't going to be in hell and his soul ain't going to be in the tribulation hallelujah it's going to be in heaven if I can before I close and I know I keep saying that amen but chur you think about it it blows me away that all that we can see God doing amen and and it's so it's it's it's it's so easy for us in the atmosphere of the Holy Ghost in the atmosphere of the unleavened bread the word the pure word of God for us to keep our composure I think sometime we don't even realize who talking to us amen Hallelujah I don't know what's going on in your house I don't know what's going on in your heart I don't know your challenges if if if if let me say it like this if you get excited at any time doing the service that's not me that's not me that's God Hall that's God stirring you that ain't a man that's God hallelujah I have no joy to give out the only joy I got God gave it to me if you get excited that's not me and let me say it like this if if if if if my voice or my preaching and my sweating and my jumping and shouting and my hollering makes you sick that ain't me either that's the devil so you can't put it on me hallelujah it's whatever you yeld yourself to but you know what I like to say and I'mma illustrate this and I'mma quit but I like to say if we Hallelujah in the presence of God are able to keep our composure you know how we do that's just us that's our nature and so forth but if I ask the question are we in Heavenly places are we in heaven yet think about it Church we're supposed to be in Heavenly places and if prophet of God in Heavenly places is is is is the position of the believer Hallelujah in your position you're in Heavenly places Hallelujah but if you think about it if we wasn't it let's go there before I close what if Higher Ground was [Applause] Heaven what his Higher Ground was Heaven and you know what's going to be going on in heaven we going to be testified Hallelujah and you think about
