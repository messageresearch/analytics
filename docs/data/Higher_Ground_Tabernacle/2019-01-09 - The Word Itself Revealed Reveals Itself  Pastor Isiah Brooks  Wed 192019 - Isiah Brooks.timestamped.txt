[25:09] I think about the words such and so
[25:18] powerful words when they placed in the
[25:20] right place you love the Lord I
[25:25] apologize I ran off from the house
[25:28] without my Bible but by God's grace we
[25:34] got her done as we stand excuse me glad
[25:38] to see everybody tonight we ask that you
[25:45] turn with us the Saint John the tenth
[25:47] chapter we'll begin reading at the 27th
[25:53] verse of that chapter we'll read all the
[25:58] way down to the tenth a 30th verse then
[26:03] we'll go to st. John 8 and we read the
[26:07] 21st through the 24th verse of that
[26:11] chapter
[26:14] my sheep heareth my voice and I know
[26:20] them and they follow me
[26:25] that's very powerful I know them and
[26:29] they follow me and I give unto them
[26:33] eternal life and they shall never perish
[26:41] neither shall any man pluck them out of
[26:45] my hand my father which gave it me gave
[26:53] them me is greater than all and no man
[26:57] is able to pluck them out of my father's
[27:00] hand
[27:01] it shifts it goes higher it becomes even
[27:07] more certain if you could put it that
[27:09] way st. John 8 21 through 24
[27:22] then said Jesus again unto them I go my
[27:29] way ye shall seek me and shall die in
[27:34] your sins whether I go ye cannot come
[27:40] now here he talks to one group of people
[27:43] and he reassures them that no man can
[27:48] pluck them out of his hands and here's
[27:51] another group he's telling you look for
[27:55] me and you can't find me and and you
[27:57] won't be able to go where I'm going
[28:00] Lord Jesus then said the Jews will he
[28:05] kill himself
[28:07] because he said whether I go you cannot
[28:10] come and he says unto them ye are from
[28:15] beneath now he's telling them why they
[28:18] can't come because you're from beneath
[28:21] I am from above he are of this world I
[28:27] am not of this world
[28:29] I said therefore to you that ye shall
[28:33] die in your sins but if ye believe not
[28:36] that I am he ye shall die in your sins
[28:43] let us pray father God we thank you for
[28:49] your amazing grace we thank you for
[28:53] being so good to us Lord you have been
[28:57] better to us than we have been to
[28:59] ourselves and father I pray that you
[29:03] would bless the service tonight in a
[29:06] special way cleanse us from all
[29:09] unrighteousness and we'll be careful to
[29:13] give you the praise the glory and honor
[29:15] in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen
[29:18] you may be seated
[29:26] it's so amazing that we are who we are
[29:32] but we are who we are by because of the
[29:35] grace of God God is a God of contrasts
[29:43] brother Branham has reassured us is his
[29:47] messages over and over and over again
[29:50] that when God gets ready to do something
[29:53] Satan who is the adversary is always
[29:57] busy Paul talked about it he's talked
[30:01] about when I am there to do good evil is
[30:04] always present and you and I must know
[30:07] that we are in the age that is most evil
[30:11] of all ages this is the age in which
[30:15] they will crown Lucifer we see in the
[30:23] world of principalities and that's what
[30:29] the Bible tells us that we don't fight
[30:32] against flesh and blood but we fight
[30:35] against principalities and powers and I
[30:40] think some time is very difficult for
[30:42] people to understand that everything has
[30:46] a spirit behind it every motive every
[30:51] objective there's always a spirit either
[30:54] the Spirit is good or the spirit is evil
[30:58] and those things that so appeal to our
[31:03] eyes and our flesh often time are evil
[31:08] even though they may be beautiful I
[31:12] recall one time when we were in
[31:15] elementary and they were teaching us
[31:18] about the Venus flytrap which is a I
[31:22] believe it's tropical flower but it is a
[31:25] flower and this flower actually eats
[31:32] insects it is one of the few flowers
[31:36] that I know of that
[31:38] is if a guy said like this carnivorous
[31:42] it likes flesh and in what it does it
[31:46] sends out this nice odor and it's a
[31:50] pretty flower and it attracts but the
[31:53] intent of that odor and that beauty is
[31:56] to win the victim for maybe a new snack
[32:02] or evening meal and it's just kind of
[32:06] remind me of Satan in this world when we
[32:09] talk about principalities that's why we
[32:13] holidays and all of these things that we
[32:15] see understand that everything in this
[32:19] world is operating by the spirit of
[32:22] Satan God put in this particular RAM his
[32:31] own kingdom but outside of the kingdom
[32:34] of God is the kingdom of Satan and you
[32:39] know I was just talking to one of my
[32:41] children today I said you cannot expect
[32:44] the unconverted to act as if they are
[32:48] converted I said whatever the seed is
[32:52] whatever the life is in them it it must
[32:55] reflect itself and if a man is not born
[33:00] of God he is literally he's going to
[33:04] reflect Satan's attributes there is no
[33:08] way you cannot expect the world to love
[33:12] you and love their father too because
[33:16] their father is a murderer my point is I
[33:20] was trying to tell them I said you you
[33:23] make the mistake of trusting people in
[33:26] the world you got to understand when
[33:31] they're not converted they're not
[33:33] responsible for their behavior because
[33:37] they're not in control of their behavior
[33:40] and oftentimes we expect them to act
[33:43] like Christians and with respect and
[33:47] honor but you must understand those days
[33:50] over there was a
[33:52] time when when the Word of God even
[33:55] controlled the world-in-itself but we
[33:58] are now in Satan's Edelen he's
[34:00] controlling the people just by
[34:03] inspiration there is no respect for the
[34:06] word or the people of God and and so
[34:08] therefore that they they do what they
[34:10] want to do the every man has a right to
[34:13] do what he wants to do this is Laodicea
[34:15] the people's rights and so if they they
[34:18] want to act and do whatever they want to
[34:20] do they feel it's okay to do it if it's
[34:24] hurting you're feeling it doesn't matter
[34:26] you'll get over it
[34:27] see that that's that attitude and you
[34:31] and I must understand that and if Satan
[34:36] can be so prevalent and we can see him
[34:40] so well in the way people behave and the
[34:43] way people act we know it's the devil
[34:45] cause as soon as they do something you
[34:47] said you know that ain't nothing but the
[34:48] devil but we when we fail to see that
[34:51] when we say that we really giving honor
[34:53] to the devil because that's what he's
[34:55] doing it is he has acted in such a way I
[34:58] mean you're looking at a person but
[35:00] you've seen the manifestation of a devil
[35:02] in them I'm saying all of this to get to
[35:08] my topic if we are the Word of God and
[35:12] we are in the kingdom of God there is a
[35:15] way we must behave but this behavior
[35:19] cannot be by your might
[35:23] or your power the only way that we can
[35:28] ever enter into the kingdom of God is
[35:31] that you must be born again now a lot of
[35:34] people they think brother but you've
[35:35] preached this all the time but you see
[35:38] the kingdom of God is supposed to be
[35:41] like light night and day in comparison
[35:45] to Satan's Kingdom it should be in a way
[35:49] that there is no question you know when
[35:53] I see light I know it's light when I see
[35:56] something that is dark I know it's dark
[35:58] there's no confusion in my mind because
[36:01] the darkness itself is manifested and
[36:04] the light in the south
[36:05] manifested how you and I supposed to
[36:09] have a light in us that's brighter than
[36:12] the Sun is that correct it is absolutely
[36:16] the truth because when Paul was on his
[36:19] way to Damascus and the Bible said a
[36:22] light shone from heaven and that light
[36:25] was brighter than the noonday Sun see
[36:29] that is the kind of light that is
[36:31] supposed to be within us because that
[36:35] light he didn't recognize was the pillar
[36:38] of fire who was Jesus Christ himself so
[36:44] God put us in a dark place and God said
[36:48] in this day there shall be light
[36:50] in the evening time right the Prophet
[36:54] God said it'd be a dismal day in in
[36:56] between night and the breaking of a day
[36:59] but he said it's at that time God would
[37:04] bring a light that would be brighter
[37:08] than the lights being seeing you know it
[37:12] is early in the morning or late in the
[37:15] evening when it's getting dark that
[37:18] light and that darkness it'll blend and
[37:20] I don't know about you but I have a
[37:21] stigma so sometimes it becomes very
[37:23] difficult for me to see when I'm driving
[37:26] in that time of the day that's why I'd
[37:29] like to be either at home or somewhere
[37:32] stationary because I do I have a little
[37:36] trouble by God's grace but you see it's
[37:39] like this I can't control the graying of
[37:43] my hair's oh my head it is part of the
[37:48] process of dying so certain things that
[37:52] God allowed to happen to us will happen
[37:55] but in all of that the light of God is
[38:00] supposed to overshadow what death is
[38:04] bringing us subject the word itself
[38:12] revealed reveals itself
[38:18] I like that the word itself reveals
[38:24] revealed reveals itself I'm gonna say it
[38:33] again
[38:33] the word itself revealed reveals itself
[38:41] and this is why I read the scripture
[38:47] because here was the world of God
[38:49] standing in the midst of the Pharisees
[38:52] and the Sadducees and they could not see
[38:56] him they saw a man that may have even
[39:00] known that he was Mary's son but they
[39:04] could not see God see and you've got to
[39:11] understand Jesus in and i'ma read that
[39:14] scripture he said except you believe
[39:17] that I am he you shall likewise die in
[39:22] your sins the difference between a wheat
[39:27] germ in a kookaburra is that a
[39:30] kookaburra is designed with unbelief a
[39:36] kookaburra has nothing in it to believe
[39:40] even though if it rains if it's thirsty
[39:44] to cry out for the glory of God but a
[39:47] conquer burrell cannot believe God now I
[39:53] work with people now see because
[39:56] remember a kookaburra is a symbolic or
[39:59] symbol of unbelief and the wheat germ is
[40:04] a symbol of belief if you are a wheat
[40:08] germ you are designed you have the power
[40:11] in you to believe the Word of God right
[40:15] because understand all rain comes for
[40:20] the wheat a kookabura
[40:24] is a symbol or for that which is
[40:27] backslidden that which is fallen it is a
[40:32] it's a thistle it is something that was
[40:35] in his original form something different
[40:38] but because of the fall realize now
[40:41] there won't be any cuckoo birds there
[40:44] and you must understand Amen that with
[40:48] the Bible begins to unfold itself it
[40:52] begins to reveal who is cocklebur
[40:55] and who is wheat it is able as the
[41:01] scripture says leave it when the wheat
[41:04] and the tares are sold together leave it
[41:06] until the harvest time and when the
[41:10] harvest time comes a man it will then
[41:15] the angel will then come and separate
[41:18] the wheat from the ten you know I wonder
[41:22] what people think that's happening where
[41:23] does that go
[41:25] that's happening now it is a message
[41:28] that seventh angel that God sends to
[41:34] separate the wheat and the tail the
[41:37] cocklebur from the wheat however you
[41:40] want to say it but this is the message
[41:44] God said leave it to win the harvest
[41:47] time then I will sit my angels everybody
[41:52] expecting to see angels and men with
[41:54] wings and everything else no the angel
[41:57] in the pulpit he is the one that is
[42:00] preaching the word that is going to
[42:03] separate the wheat from the chaff
[42:07] hello where the vellum says in the
[42:15] message faith is the son of God faith in
[42:18] the Son of God he says listen the
[42:20] worship are once purged has no more
[42:24] conscience or no more desire to sin and
[42:29] if you still have the desire
[42:32] you haven't been purged yet that's just
[42:36] one thing sure if you still have a
[42:39] desire this is what I love you said in
[42:41] your heart he didn't say in your head
[42:44] cuz Satan will always
[42:46] you're mine right he gonna come to your
[42:48] head but if you still have a desire in
[42:52] your heart to go out and lust and sin
[42:57] just remember my friend you need to come
[43:01] back to God
[43:02] back to the altar for we are sold with
[43:06] the incorruptible seed of God and
[43:09] ordinary an ordinary say grain of wheat
[43:13] won't perish if it's in the right kind
[43:17] of a ground how about the seed of God
[43:20] which is incorruptible it's got to
[43:24] produce just exactly what it says it
[43:28] will and listen a grain of wheat will
[43:32] never produce a kookabura
[43:35] no sir no a barrel will be in the
[43:39] field and when the drought is on the
[43:43] conquer barrel is just as happy to
[43:45] receive the rain that falls from the
[43:48] wheat falls for the wheat the rain that
[43:52] falls for the wheat and if the rains say
[43:57] the same rain but their fruit you'll
[44:00] know them see you'll know whether it is
[44:03] a kookaburra all wheat and if you still
[44:06] and if you steal that color in your
[44:11] heart and so forth unbelief see unbelief
[44:15] is all it is so if there is if you're
[44:21] not converted there's a Kaka birthday
[44:23] he's unbelief and the thing about it is
[44:28] only faith is a gift from God everything
[44:33] can worship God he says let everything
[44:35] that has breath praise the Lord
[44:37] but the Bible came to reveal it came to
[44:41] uncover what you and I were from the
[44:47] beginning it can't change you the gospel
[44:52] doesn't come to change who you are in
[44:54] your soul because in your soul you are
[44:58] either elected or you're not it came to
[45:02] reveal what was in your soul the seed in
[45:07] his self was shown before the foundation
[45:10] otherwise remember that you can take it
[45:13] all the way back to the book of Genesis
[45:14] God never changed the seas that were in
[45:17] in that darkness and all he did was
[45:21] shine light on the seed and the seed was
[45:25] what it was the light didn't change it
[45:29] it just unveiled what was under the
[45:33] darkness he see them saying see so when
[45:37] the word itself is revealed it it
[45:42] reveals itself it comes to manifest
[45:45] itself hallelujah and by light by the
[45:51] light shining on the seed
[45:54] hello but think about it three and a
[45:56] half years Judas with Jesus if any kind
[46:00] of transformation could have taken place
[46:02] it would have would have done it but the
[46:04] Bible said he was born the son of
[46:06] perdition Holy Ghost breathed on it
[46:10] receive either Holy Ghost
[46:12] hello he was justified he was sanctified
[46:17] the brother branham said he could not go
[46:20] to Pentecost ha because of who he was
[46:25] from the beginning hey am I making sense
[46:29] Steve so there are certain things that
[46:32] cannot be changed God does not have an
[46:36] eraser on the back of his pencil when it
[46:40] comes to the Lamb's Book of Life
[46:43] Book of Life is one thing the Lamb's
[46:46] Book of Life your name cannot be taken
[46:48] off you understand me
[46:52] God doesn't say well you've been so bad
[46:54] boy I'm taking your name off the Lamb's
[46:56] Book of Life
[46:56] no the Lamb's Book alive well little
[47:00] sealed the very means that was there so
[47:05] protected it was sealed hallelujah
[47:08] underneath the seventh seal it's amazing
[47:14] the Bible said even the world will
[47:16] wonder whose names are written in the
[47:18] Lamb's Book of Life
[47:19] hallelujah not the bride she know her
[47:23] name is in the was was in the book lies
[47:26] Lamb's Book of Life
[47:28] why she heard him remember my sheep here
[47:32] with my boys and a stranger they will
[47:36] not follow listen show us the father he
[47:41] said then any divine promise of God is
[47:44] of God is a seed in an in divine promise
[47:47] of God is a seed and that seed is there
[47:50] in the right ground will produce his
[47:52] kind corn would bring corn barley would
[47:56] bring barley wheat would bring wheat and
[47:58] my divine promise of God would bring the
[48:00] results is if it's a place in the ground
[48:04] and there's water with faith prayer
[48:07] trust God shall bring it to pass
[48:10] he says I'm saying that from experience
[48:16] but there's no way that you and I will
[48:19] be able to tell God I trusted you and it
[48:22] didn't happen no such thing the fault
[48:26] will never be God's fault because God is
[48:29] faithful to his word hallelujah st. John
[48:33] 10:27 through 30 says my sheep hear my
[48:36] voice and I know them and they know me
[48:41] now he's talking here's Jesus right now
[48:44] my sheep hears my voice I know them
[48:48] right and they follow me
[48:52] see you gotta understand Jesus amen he
[48:56] had such a knowledge and he knew his
[49:00] sheep because they would follow can you
[49:05] imagine
[49:05] James Peter John and all of them fishing
[49:08] come follow me he knew he knew at that
[49:13] moment they
[49:14] drop their nets he knew at that moment
[49:16] they would follow him he knew that when
[49:19] you heard the word you would follow him
[49:24] he knew it was a voice that drew you
[49:28] you didn't even understand it yet the
[49:31] voice caught you hallelujah
[49:37] and I give unto them eternal life so
[49:40] when the devil tried to tell you
[49:43] Elia you can't make it no no no not you

[49:52] to me and they shall never perish
[49:59] neither shall any man pluck them out of
[50:03] mine I'm so glad about that because if
[50:08] he's got you in his hands there is no
[50:11] way any man can pluck you out
[50:13] hmm and he takes it even higher my
[50:17] father which gave them me is greater
[50:21] than all and no man is able to pluck
[50:25] them out of my father's hand and then he
[50:29] breaks it down so you can easily see him
[50:31] he's revealing himself now I and my
[50:34] father Oh hallelujah

[50:43] is nobody you can government come to an
[50:45] appeal to because I am my father 1 we
[50:49] have the same mind the same existence
[50:54] hallelujah see so that word comes to
[50:57] reveal that's we don't see we don't see
[51:00] that the very separating of the wheat
[51:02] and death is happening right now by way
[51:08] of this message see here here we have an
[51:14] answer she don't want to make us think
[51:17] we don't have an answer but we have an
[51:19] answer we know what eternal life is and
[51:23] we know that we can only obtain see the
[51:26] body
[51:27] we are accepted in the beloved but what
[51:30] we must understand is that the beloved
[51:32] must accept you right ain't you
[51:36] accepting me love is to be loved it's
[51:38] accepting you and when he accepts you
[51:41] then you pass it ain't even based on
[51:49] your goodness it's based on your
[51:51] election come Oh Jacob was a shyster huh
[51:57] he was a shyster God even at Birth said
[52:01] no that's the one I'm old even though he
[52:05] saw as the firstborn
[52:06] Jacob will rule him I want him see see
[52:11] it's election why because we were in him
[52:15] he knew us when we were in him we may
[52:19] not have known him but he knew us and
[52:21] that's why you and I must understand it
[52:24] doesn't matter how dark it gets in this
[52:28] side on this side if God has already
[52:31] elected you listen you won't skip the
[52:34] process you won't skip one step God will
[52:37] if he doesn't lead you he would drive
[52:39] you like a cattle and he will bring you
[52:42] to perfection that is the word and we
[52:46] still to say thank you Jesus because
[52:51] he's doing the work I'm so glad I don't
[52:53] it ain't me uh you know I'm just here
[52:56] we're here he's using my body we'll
[52:59] think about it
[53:00] God is using your body that's such an
[53:03] honor that is such a glorious honor that
[53:07] out of all the dust of the earth God
[53:09] chooses to use your body the body he
[53:13] gave you the body he made see you and I
[53:21] must understand Isiah brother said I
[53:26] said I knew what it meant to be a
[53:27] prophet and he knew is going to take
[53:30] more than what he had to meet the answer
[53:34] of the day let me break it to our turn
[53:38] we know we are the bride
[53:40] but we know is going to take more than
[53:46] what we got to meet the answer of the
[53:50] day we know it there's no way we can sit
[53:54] back and say well yeah no no we're not
[53:58] where we should be we gotta have more it
[54:03] frightens me I was thinking about that
[54:06] today almost all day I think 3 o'clock
[54:09] in the morning I woke up and all I was
[54:11] thinking about was a dead church what
[54:16] makes us think we are alive the
[54:20] Pentecostal churches they got more
[54:22] action they got more noise they got more
[54:24] gifts they got more all of that and yet
[54:26] the Bible says they're dead spiritually
[54:31] dead yet it appears to be alive you have
[54:36] a name that you live but yet you're dead
[54:38] what what constitutes a dead church you
[54:43] know what it is when God leaves it and
[54:46] write it kabob you understand me now I
[54:53] think some of us would not be thinking
[54:55] oh well you know what about this you
[54:57] know what I'm talking about the church
[55:00] individuals individuals when God departs
[55:06] that's when you become a dead church
[55:09] when Samson knew that God was no longer
[55:13] with him he became a dead church but
[55:17] because he was elected God knows how to
[55:19] resurrect the dead mmm help us Jesus and
[55:29] so does it take it takes more than what
[55:32] we got Oh Lord today to meet the answer
[55:35] it takes the person of Christ within us
[55:39] he didn't say the baptism of the Holy
[55:42] Ghost he said the person of Christ
[55:45] justification make room for safe
[55:47] occasion sanctification make room for
[55:49] the path to the Holy Ghost and the
[55:51] baptism of the Holy Ghost make room for
[55:53] the person of
[55:54] we cannot stop amen in order for us to
[55:57] defeat in order for us to come out as
[56:00] victors in this age we must have the
[56:04] person of Christ ruling in our lives we
[56:09] must we won't meet today what God is
[56:13] requiring from us we will come short if
[56:17] the person of Christ is not within us it
[56:21] takes Jesus himself to answer the
[56:25] question great Lord grant that the Holy
[56:29] Ghost in the person of Christ in the
[56:33] person of the Holy Ghost may come into
[56:36] every heart just now cleanse us Lord
[56:39] from all our unbelief clears us from our
[56:45] creeds and our foolishness of this world
[56:47] cleanse us from it Lord and put your
[56:50] word in our heart and meditate on it day
[56:53] and night
[56:55] may the answer come Lord as soon as the
[56:58] harder cleanse see the heart gotta be
[57:02] cleansed granite Lord laid the angel of
[57:06] God touch each one of our hearts now
[57:08] with the cola fire as we were waiting
[57:12] upon him Granite Lord see see you know
[57:17] if we're gonna be bringing into our our
[57:21] Commission you know we came to do what
[57:24] better than say the last that this Mount
[57:26] Zion showdown must have the person of
[57:30] Christ on the seat because Janice and
[57:35] jammer is going to be doing signs and
[57:37] wonders - when the squeeze come Janice
[57:41] and generous will be doing signs and
[57:43] wonders - but the difference is they
[57:48] have the person of Christ how is that
[57:52] right the difference between Janice and
[57:54] Jambres and Moses Moses was veiled with
[57:58] the pillar of fire
[58:02] hmm which was Christ himself
[58:07] see you and I must understand him and
[58:10] where we've seen people and this is why
[58:12] I was talking to the Lord as his Lord
[58:14] you know I talked to him whether he ever
[58:18] was gonna come back and say a word or
[58:20] two or not I talked to him I let him
[58:22] know he knows what's on my heart I said
[58:24] God the person of Christ is missing
[58:27] where is he
[58:29] even among the preachers if he's where
[58:32] is he Lord there's a God you know my
[58:37] thirst you know my heart's cry I'm not
[58:41] here for fame I'm not here for fortune
[58:44] and I don't care about that stuff
[58:46] I'm just here for one thing that God
[58:49] would occupy my body that he would lead
[58:52] and lead through in my heart in my mind
[58:55] well I have no thought of my own
[58:58] totally surrendered to him I want to see
[59:01] the person of Christ in these people
[59:04] Lord in this man that's what I'm talking
[59:09] about
[59:09] is it real is real have not God been
[59:13] been perfect in his promise everything
[59:16] God has promised he's brought it to pass
[59:18] this is not too hard for God but he's
[59:22] got to take us or it takes a surrendered
[59:24] heart it takes a man and a woman who's
[59:27] gonna be able or willing to say Lord
[59:29] take it all
[59:30] I'm just so tired of it taking all Lord
[59:32] I just kill me now
[59:35] made me I become another Isaac slain me
[59:39] that I might live again that you might
[59:41] live through me and this is what I'm
[59:43] thinking about I keep thinking I says
[59:45] Lord I said you know we were religious
[59:48] we have a good time your presence come
[59:52] in here I said but it's more to it it's
[59:56] more to it y'all hear me is more to it
[1:00:01] Satan challenges us I was reading quotes
[1:00:03] where brother man said I challenged the
[1:00:05] devil that was the person of Christ in
[1:00:10] him and that's where we must come to
[1:00:13] because we're coming to a place that's
[1:00:15] Satan's gonna bring that challenge but
[1:00:17] you've gotta have hearing you to produce
[1:00:19] an
[1:00:20] other challenge to come back at him
[1:00:21] Yanis famiiy is between good and evil
[1:00:24] it's between Micah and Lucifer Christ
[1:00:29] and Lucifer and you gotta have that
[1:00:30] Christ in you is that right Bell said
[1:00:35] you better let go over to these overseas
[1:00:37] places he said because the devil these
[1:00:39] witches will challenge you you gotta
[1:00:42] have Christ in you you can't go now talk
[1:00:47] to her brother today and his wife Tony
[1:00:49] say you gonna keep going over there she
[1:00:51] shouldn't see it this I say well you
[1:00:53] know people that just didn't seem too
[1:00:55] much television telling you keep going
[1:00:57] over there to them places they're gonna
[1:00:58] have your head in a pot but you know
[1:01:16] people still believe people still
[1:01:18] believe what they've seen on TV TV don't
[1:01:22] walk to everybody's mind civilization
[1:01:26] has conquered the world and they still
[1:01:28] thinking that you know of course there's
[1:01:30] cannibals in in places and I won't name
[1:01:32] these places you know what I mean yeah
[1:01:34] but you know you rarely hear if
[1:01:37] anybody's being stuff to the pot these
[1:01:38] days because see if God sends you he's
[1:01:44] going to protect you if this okay he
[1:01:50] says listen he said then said unto them
[1:01:52] I go my way and he shall seek me and
[1:01:55] she'll die in your sins let me move on
[1:01:57] down you and I must understand
[1:01:59] Corinthians says examine yourself
[1:02:01] whether you be in the faith prove your
[1:02:04] own self
[1:02:05] no II not your old self hello how that
[1:02:11] Jesus Christ is in you except you'll be
[1:02:14] reprobate know him you gotta know he's
[1:02:18] in you I hope no in that day you will
[1:02:22] know I mean the father the father's in
[1:02:24] me and I am you you and I must come to
[1:02:26] know he said except you be reprobate but
[1:02:31] I trust that ye know
[1:02:33] that we are not reprobates now I pray to
[1:02:36] God that you do no evil not that we
[1:02:40] should appear approved but we should do
[1:02:44] that which is honest though we be as
[1:02:48] reprobates for we can do nothing against
[1:02:53] the truth but for the truth so you can't
[1:02:57] do nothing about the truth truth is
[1:02:59] truth even Pilate says what is truth but
[1:03:05] he had to acknowledge to truth I find no
[1:03:08] fault in him this man is the holy man I
[1:03:12] find no fault in him he said he didn't
[1:03:15] know what truth he wondered and he and
[1:03:17] the truth comes out I find no fault this
[1:03:20] lamb is pure it's ready for sacrifice
[1:03:24] hallelujah it's ready to be offered up
[1:03:26] he's going for the whole judgment Hall
[1:03:29] to judgement Hall they examine him they
[1:03:31] examine him to see whether they could
[1:03:32] find a spot or blemish and the lamb
[1:03:35] comes clean no fault in him now he's
[1:03:39] ready to be crucified hmm see we must
[1:03:43] realize him and that the Old Testament
[1:03:46] was Christ it always been Christ Oh said
[1:03:51] Moses spoke rather let me see
[1:03:55] he he had the rod as an and in the
[1:03:58] author s he opened no man can do that
[1:04:04] that was Christ in the man Josh was a
[1:04:10] son Stanfill yes it was a man's voice
[1:04:15] but it was Christ behind the boys the
[1:04:19] Creator was in the man presence in
[1:04:25] Christ was in in Abraham Christ was in
[1:04:28] Isaac Christ was in Jacob Christ within
[1:04:32] Joseph Christ was in Moses Christ is in
[1:04:38] all the Old Testament in all the Old
[1:04:41] Testament and if we had time here seven
[1:04:44] years ago he's at last two months we've
[1:04:46] been on the
[1:04:47] exodus from one side to another try
[1:04:50] typing everything even the waters of
[1:04:52] separation the red heifer hello and
[1:04:55] don't you know israel just found a red
[1:04:58] heifer a red heifer without spot or
[1:05:03] blemish you know what the red heifer was
[1:05:05] all about being able to sanctify the
[1:05:09] people according to God's standard and

[1:05:55] complete Galatians says my little
[1:06:01] children of whom I travail in birth Paul
[1:06:04] was concerned about the Galatians

[1:06:08] gotten to the place they wanted to go
[1:06:10] backwards you know the lean circumcision
[1:06:13] and all that stuff he said he was
[1:06:14] concerned he says listen I'm working
[1:06:16] hard I'm working hard and then trying to
[1:06:18] bring you to her bad eye that's what he
[1:06:21] said he said of whom I travail in birth

[1:06:28] not some rule not some regulation I want
[1:06:32] to see Christ in you see that's what I'm
[1:06:34] saying that's what we want to see in
[1:06:37] this church let some rule some tradition
[1:06:41] formalism and all of that life Christ we
[1:06:47] should have even preached Oh love or
[1:06:49] anything if Christ is in here he will
[1:06:53] express himself he will reveal himself I
[1:06:56] desire to be present with you now and to
[1:06:59] change my voice five
[1:07:01] staying in doubt of you he was the
[1:07:03] prophet of God Paul himself talking to
[1:07:06] the Galatians I you know I wanna I wanna
[1:07:09] change my boss I know I'm screaming at
[1:07:12] you right now
[1:07:12] and I'm being forceful he said but but I
[1:07:15] have to be I want to change my boss but
[1:07:17] I stand out in doubt of you in other
[1:07:20] words I don't see Christ I don't see
[1:07:23] Christ in you I need to see Christ Paul
[1:07:28] was telling the Galatians I want to see
[1:07:29] Christ in you and I'm gonna continue to
[1:07:31] pray and pray and I'm gonna continue to
[1:07:33] rail it meant to some I see a breath
[1:07:35] come for Oh hallelujah
[1:07:39] see he's Paul was speaking he's speaking
[1:07:41] pretty hard to him
[1:07:42] but he says listen the world has been
[1:07:44] revealed but now I need to see the
[1:07:46] revealed the revealing of what was
[1:07:49] revealed I want to see the expression of
[1:07:51] but I want to see I want to see the
[1:07:53] manifestation of what's been revealed
[1:07:55] and that's all I'm saying the message
[1:07:58] that we reveal the thunders have honored
[1:08:00] that the seven seals have been open but
[1:08:03] I want to see the manifestation of
[1:08:04] what's been revealed that's what we want
[1:08:09] to see and if we're not careful people
[1:08:12] we will die if we don't move forward we
[1:08:16] must booth for every one of us must
[1:08:19] press it is a hard press right now it's
[1:08:23] a hard press it's a time where evident
[1:08:25] every devil in hell every principality
[1:08:27] is coming against you you can't go to
[1:08:30] the grocery store without seeing Phil
[1:08:32] everywhere you go Shaitan is is right at
[1:08:35] the door but you got to press you got to
[1:08:40] recognize who you are and understand I'm
[1:08:42] in another Kingdom this is not my
[1:08:44] kingdom hallelujah and I will not allow
[1:08:47] that evil Kingdom to pull me out of the
[1:08:50] one I'm into no sir my kingdom is
[1:08:55] eternal God's kingdom is eternal this
[1:08:59] kingdom will be done away with
[1:09:01] hallelujah
[1:09:02] see what the Prophet god says in all
[1:09:05] things he said God wants to perform his
[1:09:08] word by his power and when the church
[1:09:12] denies his power
[1:09:13] how can he perform
[1:09:15] and vindicate his word when the church
[1:09:18] explained it away and say it's for some
[1:09:20] other day or something how can god who
[1:09:24] wants to fulfill his word and perform
[1:09:26] his word going among the people and the
[1:09:29] people did 9 that he does it yet
[1:09:33] they go through all the rituals and see
[1:09:37] you got to understand people think I'm
[1:09:39] insane but I see conditions
[1:09:42] I see the conditions of people around
[1:09:44] the message I know I'm fighting I'm sure
[1:09:47] you're fighting you're pressing but when
[1:09:49] I go all over the message you know
[1:09:51] people are not they're not thirsting for
[1:09:53] God they got all the rituals they got
[1:09:57] all the quotes of william branham most
[1:09:59] of them don't know their Bibles hello I
[1:10:01] mean they got it all they look good but
[1:10:04] where is the Christ that was been
[1:10:08] revealed is that right the Bible said
[1:10:11] the token came in the evening time where
[1:10:13] is it where's the life right
[1:10:17] it's got to be seen it was brought here
[1:10:21] to be seen where in his people Christ
[1:10:26] unveiled in his people the bride is the
[1:10:29] mystery of Christ revealed that's who
[1:10:33] she is right he goes on and says when
[1:10:37] the church explained it away he said I'm
[1:10:40] saying oh yes the Holy Ghost without
[1:10:43] sensation but where is the person of
[1:10:46] Christ we have peeled the move of God
[1:10:50] because we say we don't want to be
[1:10:53] Pentecostal well you can never be bride
[1:10:56] without becoming Pentecostal first you
[1:10:59] must have the Pentecostal experience
[1:11:02] before you could ever go any further you
[1:11:06] don't jump from justification to the
[1:11:08] person of Christ or sanctification to
[1:11:11] the person of Christ you must have the
[1:11:13] baptism of the Holy Ghost and by doing
[1:11:15] so then God God brings you to that
[1:11:17] person of Christ by maturing Paul said
[1:11:20] grow up into him stop behaving like
[1:11:23] children grow up into him
[1:11:29] here's what happened
[1:11:31] God wants to perform by the Holy Ghost
[1:11:34] into something how people even get him
[1:11:36] all stirring up I was telling brother
[1:11:38] Craig the other day when I was talking
[1:11:39] to him I said if the preachers are
[1:11:41] preaching a message to excite the people
[1:11:44] all they are actors the Word of God
[1:11:52] comes to bring conviction the Word of
[1:11:55] God comes to show the people it is the
[1:11:57] light of God that shines and cuts
[1:12:00] through every veil that you might see
[1:12:03] where you're standing it must bring
[1:12:05] conviction it must bring and thank you
[1:12:08] yarn if you come out of service and
[1:12:10] you're not yearning for more God
[1:12:12] the preacher fail because he didn't let
[1:12:16] go and let God God never fails
[1:12:21] but every man you say you get to
[1:12:23] oppression people than what we got it we
[1:12:25] got it
[1:12:26] Israel thought they had it and all they
[1:12:28] were was Pharisees they became actors
[1:12:32] performing for the audience of people
[1:12:34] and yet they got their hearts were too
[1:12:36] so far away from God am I right or wrong
[1:12:40] it is the mystery is reality oh yes they
[1:12:49] have to do not listen he said and the
[1:12:51] church wants to perform they have to
[1:12:54] divide denied the Holy Ghost they want
[1:12:56] to perform to make a big organization of
[1:12:59] wealth to bring membership no matter
[1:13:01] what you have to baptize sinners drunken
[1:13:03] bootleggers anything else and take them
[1:13:06] into the body of the church
[1:13:07] no wonder revelation 17 says this old
[1:13:10] prostitute woman that had a bunch of
[1:13:12] daughters that she was full of names of
[1:13:15] blasphemy named churches and daughters
[1:13:17] calling the names of daughters you know
[1:13:19] what I'm saying but understand people of
[1:13:23] God you and I don't ever want mercy to
[1:13:25] be removed from us now the way I preach
[1:13:30] is not so accepted around places but I
[1:13:34] could care less the Bride of Christ will
[1:13:36] here and my thing is when I see the
[1:13:40] struggle and I see all this
[1:13:42] witchcraft you know witchcraft is what
[1:13:43] really right brother branham said he saw
[1:13:46] the Church of America being led by a
[1:13:49] witch
[1:13:51] so witchcraft is the principality it is
[1:13:55] the power that's moving these churches
[1:13:58] right and it's the power that's moving a
[1:14:02] lot of people because if you find
[1:14:04] yourself being stubborn against the Word
[1:14:06] of God you have a witchcraft spirit
[1:14:08] something that is anointing you that
[1:14:11] will keep you away from the promises of
[1:14:13] God you have been bewitched and if you
[1:14:16] come to a place like the Galatians did
[1:14:18] who they thought Amen that if they went
[1:14:21] back to the law of circumcision the
[1:14:23] fleshly things amen he said Paul says
[1:14:26] but who happy which did you see it ain't
[1:14:29] about law it's about love it's about
[1:14:33] love he said if you love me you will
[1:14:36] keep my Commandments
[1:14:38] that's only stipulation God put on it if
[1:14:40] you love me you will keep my
[1:14:43] Commandments hmm when this reveal is
[1:14:52] revealed right I don't care if you got a
[1:14:55] bright light underneath the cloak once
[1:14:57] you pull that cloak off that light go ah
[1:15:01] that's what God God is saying listen I
[1:15:04] am revealed I open the seals I've taken
[1:15:06] I've loose them I've showed you your
[1:15:08] name is in the book shine for me try you
[1:15:13] come to shine for God different than
[1:15:16] anybody else in the world handpicked by
[1:15:19] the Almighty God to show forth in this
[1:15:22] generation that's what we are a special
[1:15:26] class of people but if that anointing
[1:15:31] right what did the angel do to Mary just
[1:15:35] Mary you're gonna have a baby there says
[1:15:39] how could this thing be seeing that I've
[1:15:41] never known a man and then the Holy
[1:15:46] Spirit said but the Holy Ghost in you
[1:15:51] let me preach it's going to overshadow
[1:15:54] you it's going to come right there and
[1:15:58] it's going to produce the promise and
[1:16:01] all Mary had to say was be it unto me
[1:16:06] according to thy word that's all if
[1:16:12] that's all the prayer you have you ought
[1:16:15] to say Lord be it unto me according to
[1:16:19] that word if that's all you got to pray
[1:16:21] pray it because you're giving God
[1:16:25] permission he's a gentleman whoever
[1:16:34] stands in the unity of God when God he
[1:16:37] says listen it's time that men and women
[1:16:40] woke up to the fact that we want to be
[1:16:43] one Jesus pray that we might be one just
[1:16:48] as God and him were one and God was in
[1:16:52] him and we are one with Christ if we let
[1:16:57] Christ come in but it's the only way we
[1:17:01] can do is to let him take the control
[1:17:04] room in our hearts then we become one if
[1:17:09] we become one we have no issues with
[1:17:11] each other
[1:17:14] unity is what it is I don't know what
[1:17:22] people think but even if we had a Judas
[1:17:26] I had some Judas's in here don't you
[1:17:29] know you still got to love them and
[1:17:30] don't you know Jesus never told anybody
[1:17:33] who he was the only person he told was
[1:17:36] John and that was just before the
[1:17:38] persecution my point is how could we
[1:17:42] make heaven you know we must understand
[1:17:45] this you know I've just got to love your
[1:17:47] family your friends your neighbors but
[1:17:53] you must love your enemies because God
[1:17:55] gave them to you hello you say oh I want
[1:18:01] to be like Jesus you can't be like
[1:18:02] that's part of that's part oh geez
[1:18:05] loving his enemy he loved judo so much
[1:18:08] who was his enemy he kissed him hmm
[1:18:12] he loved judo so much Amen that he
[1:18:15] kissed him and still call him friend
[1:18:17] would he knew that his commission was to
[1:18:19] betray him that's Jesus that's the
[1:18:23] person of Christ in you I don't trust
[1:18:30] him
[1:18:30] well you know what I'm saying what what
[1:18:32] about God you and I still working we're
[1:18:36] still pressing in to the place where God
[1:18:39] can trust us all of us
[1:18:49] this is okay I'm almost done second
[1:18:56] Thessalonians 1:7 through 12 this is my
[1:18:58] last grip chill y'all understand what
[1:19:01] I'm trying to say I'm trying to say
[1:19:03] tonight if the word has been unveiled if
[1:19:07] the cover is moved from the object that
[1:19:11] we're doctors hear it then once the
[1:19:15] light strike it the identification of
[1:19:18] what it is is now known see once the
[1:19:23] gospel light strikes you the
[1:19:25] identification of who and what you are
[1:19:27] is now known in the making sense see the
[1:19:35] light the darkness hit it when we were
[1:19:37] among the world in that darkness we all
[1:19:39] looked alike but when the gospel comes
[1:19:42] it it shines a light there and then it
[1:19:45] identified who you are there's no more
[1:19:49] cloaking everything is revealed the coin
[1:19:54] is revealed the weed is revealed the
[1:19:56] cocklebur is whatever you are is
[1:19:58] revealed by the message of the hour
[1:20:03] now it may be in a place you know if
[1:20:06] you're not truly converted doesn't mean
[1:20:08] that you are not wheat the problem is
[1:20:12] you must become converted and if God has
[1:20:16] set you in this gospel this gospel came
[1:20:20] to convert you and the only way that
[1:20:23] you'll not be converted is that you
[1:20:25] don't believe that you can be see that's
[1:20:34] the attribute of the cocklebur
[1:20:35] but you've got to push over that that's
[1:20:38] what so you got to be born again
[1:20:40] hallelujah is that right cuz brother
[1:20:43] Branham said it like this he said in the
[1:20:45] midst of the kokuboro
[1:20:46] was a wheat germ hello
[1:20:50] meaning that we came into this world
[1:20:52] hybrid Oh hallelujah the outside look
[1:20:59] like a cop tomorrow but on the inside
[1:21:01] was wheat I'm almost done starting at
[1:21:07] the seven verse and to you who are
[1:21:09] troubled rest with us when the Lord
[1:21:13] Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with
[1:21:15] his mighty angels in flames of fire
[1:21:19] taking vengeance on them that know not
[1:21:22] God and that obey not the gospel of our
[1:21:26] Lord Jesus Christ you said well Judas
[1:21:29] knew God he did not he knew of him had
[1:21:34] he known it was God he would have never
[1:21:36] betrayed him he didn't know him
[1:21:40] Peter knew it even though he was still a
[1:21:43] shyster when Jesus said you gonna go to
[1:21:46] Peter says Lord where we gonna go you're
[1:21:49] the only one that has the words to
[1:21:51] eternal I see you and I who really know
[1:21:54] this message is true you know you can't
[1:21:56] go nowhere cuz you know this is the only
[1:21:59] words to eternal life you know it
[1:22:01] nobody can II can't can't can't explain
[1:22:04] it away from you you know it that is a
[1:22:07] revelation God gave you I'm gonna hang
[1:22:10] on in there if there's a such thing mmm
[1:22:14] I'm not holding him he's holding me who
[1:22:18] shall be punished with everlasting
[1:22:19] destruction from the presence women in
[1:22:23] flaming fenders taking on those that
[1:22:25] know not God and that obey not the
[1:22:28] gospel of Jesus Christ what is the
[1:22:31] gospel of Jesus Christ you must be born
[1:22:34] again
[1:22:36] that's it's the only thing when Peter
[1:22:40] preached he preached Jesus and then when
[1:22:44] they said men and brethren what shall we
[1:22:46] do repent and be baptized in the name of
[1:22:50] Jesus Christ for the remission of his
[1:22:53] sins and you shall receive the gift of
[1:22:56] the whole that is the gospel the death
[1:22:59] burial and the resurrection and if you
[1:23:02] can't preach the resurrection you've got
[1:23:04] to live it the resurrection is alive
[1:23:07] that cries it's a sign it's a witness
[1:23:10] that Christ that once was dead is now
[1:23:13] living in me Hey
[1:23:16] who shall be punished with everlasting
[1:23:19] destruction from the presence of the
[1:23:21] Lord and from the glory of his power
[1:23:23] when he shall come to be glorified in
[1:23:25] his Saints and to be admired
[1:23:27] whoa I love that when he shall be glory
[1:23:32] come to be glorified well in his Saints
[1:23:35] and to be admired in all them that
[1:23:38] believe because our testimony among you
[1:23:42] was believed in that day
[1:23:44] wherefore also we pray always for you
[1:23:47] that our God would count you worthy of
[1:23:50] this calling and fulfill all the good
[1:23:54] pleasure of his goodness and in the work
[1:23:57] of faith with power that the name of the
[1:24:01] Lord Jesus Christ may be wet glorified
[1:24:03] in you y'all see what I'm saying the
[1:24:05] whole point I was being here is that God
[1:24:08] would be glorified in us it's time to
[1:24:14] stop looking at what Paul did and what
[1:24:16] John did and what Moses did and what
[1:24:19] Joshua did God want to see what you do
[1:24:22] he want to do it in you wasn't enough to
[1:24:25] be done when God wants it to be done
[1:24:27] through us not some past history he is
[1:24:34] alive today
[1:24:39] gotta be more it is more and those who
[1:24:44] hunger and thirst for more will be
[1:24:45] filled
[1:24:46] I can't thirst for you but each and
[1:24:49] every one ought to be thirsting for more
[1:24:51] God and what does God do to make you
[1:24:53] thirst show you your failures he show
[1:24:58] you your failures right if you got
[1:25:04] everything sweet you you know what I'm
[1:25:05] saying but when he throws some salt or
[1:25:07] something in there Amen it makes you
[1:25:09] thirsty for what something sweet and you
[1:25:13] not know we know but every day God shows
[1:25:16] us failures after failures I know maybe
[1:25:19] some of y'all have gotten to the place
[1:25:20] that you don't fail but I do
[1:25:24] I do hello
[1:25:27] I do but you see is not a counted as
[1:25:30] failures because I'm justified but I see
[1:25:34] what God brings me I see what I do and
[1:25:38] yet I am under the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:25:39] and my desire is to be just like him I
[1:25:43] don't even know what that means
[1:25:46] yeah understanding me it's a level of
[1:25:49] God I won't I know it's there for me you
[1:25:52] got a nose there for you I don't care if
[1:25:55] I don't become appalled as some great
[1:25:58] men of God if I'm just a preacher and
[1:26:00] all you see is God like I said with that
[1:26:03] later on that plane say what does that
[1:26:05] look like that's a lot and she said it
[1:26:06] like that I'll never forget that that
[1:26:08] wasn't me she was looking at that was
[1:26:10] God you don't know how that blessed me
[1:26:13] you don't know how much that stirred me
[1:26:16] to know that God you know how can I say
[1:26:20] it identified himself with me
[1:26:25] that was his identification not me
[1:26:27] whatever she saw was beyond flesh I
[1:26:31] didn't ask him all I did was listen I
[1:26:34] was listening brother branham I was
[1:26:36] listening to his tape trying to stay in
[1:26:38] tune with the word didn't even know that
[1:26:40] God was there like that y'all know what
[1:26:44] I'm saying
[1:26:45] little things like that little things
[1:26:48] like that

[1:27:22] was praying because they felt like
[1:27:24] something wasn't right
[1:27:25] y'all understanding the whole stage was
[1:27:27] caused by God people were praying for me
[1:27:31] when I didn't know they were praying I'm
[1:27:34] not trying to be anything but Jesus
[1:27:37] that's all I want and that's all you
[1:27:40] ought to want I'm not here to be glory a
[1:27:43] glorified I'm not trying to get into
[1:27:45] glory I'm not trying to sound like I'm
[1:27:46] more spiritual than anybody else cuz I
[1:27:48] am NOT if you go into this line they're
[1:27:51] mine per day you'll see the battle said
[1:27:53] you wouldn't like them it's reality it
[1:27:58] is reality and as long as you've got
[1:28:01] this flesh you gonna have the battles it
[1:28:04] doesn't mean you're gonna lose but you
[1:28:05] have the battles I'm almost done right
[1:28:09] wherefore also we pray always for you
[1:28:11] that our God would count you worthy of
[1:28:13] this calling and fulfill the good
[1:28:15] pleasure of his goodness and work of
[1:28:17] faith with power that's what I'm talking
[1:28:22] about that the name of our Lord Jesus
[1:28:24] Christ may be glorified in you and ye
[1:28:26] and him according to the grace of our
[1:28:28] God and the Lord Jesus Christ one of the
[1:28:30] things that got me stirred up because of
[1:28:32] my daughter
[1:28:33] I see the devil using her and I'm like
[1:28:37] Lord what that shouldn't even be because
[1:28:42] I know she's in prison and she don't
[1:28:44] want to be where's the power of God God
[1:28:50] is dealing Sonny you don't mean you're
[1:28:52] not people in this church they you know
[1:28:54] they know how faithful but how many
[1:28:56] really praying for her and thirsting for
[1:28:57] more god to make to get to a place where
[1:29:00] that demon has to go it can't be just a
[1:29:03] daddy y'all understand I'm saying this

[1:29:15] is but everybody don't be the judge is
[1:29:18] not by husband in the Kalina in their
[1:29:19] family it is in your family it's more
[1:29:24] than your your spiritual family in your
[1:29:26] natural and I'm not saying this because
