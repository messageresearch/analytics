[Music] and we may [Music] [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Music] oh power just now and baptize everyone thank god for his grace and his mercy we thank god for being so good to us it is a blessing it's a privilege to be in the house of the lord today or tonight there are many who did not wake up this morning but god was gracious enough to wake us up and you know by the grace of god as long as [Music] i'm here i want to do whatever god wants me to do we're just going to get right into the word of the lord thank god for the song service and those who did enter in and pray that god continue to bless you by the grace of god i had so many thoughts on my mind and things in my heart there was one message that i thought i would be preaching right now but it seems like that's the message that i have prepared is not what god would have me to preach of course i've got to maybe prepare myself even more so with that but psalms 18 is where we're coming from tonight psalms 18. i guess the thing that quest i have a question in my mind about is uh thought of wondering whether people realize uh what god is doing with us you know he did not call us to a religion or to be some kind of a group of a large or anything like that but there's a greater work that is happening among the people of god and the very thought that came to my heart and mine is that the only way that we'll ever be able to achieve what god has in mind for us to to achieve is to take him at his word to really believe what he says have no space a room for doubt and so that's what i'm going to be talking about just starting with something um i wanted to preach on of his kind uh but i'll minister on that perhaps the next time because i don't think that we realize what god is trying to get over to us and the blockage is not the heart the blockages in the mind because we find it very difficult to believe that god could choose such wretched as we are to do a great work in us uh but that's the way god likes to do it he likes to find that real great mess to make something beautiful out of it and uh so i i don't want to preach on that tonight but i will be preaching on something that will try uh uh tie into um this particular thought i'm gonna be preaching on tonight trust the word trust the word uh coming from the uh psalm 18 we're going to begin reading there at the first and second verse of that particular psalm and then we'll go to psalms 31. if someone can get me some water i don't know what i did with mine but i appreciate it these should be some by the refrigerator there nothing okay no problem psalms 18 1-2 i will love thee oh lord my strength the lord is my rock thank you sir and my fortress and my deliverer my god my strength in whom i will trust my buckler and the horn of my salvation and my high tower let us pray our heavenly father we come before you lord as humble as we know how we thank you for tonight we thank you for all your loving kindness toward us the grace that you have bestowed upon us lord is unexplainable and unexpressable there's none like you and i thank you for your long suffering toward us we thank you father for being our creator our god you are our all in all and father we just pray that you give us the grace to move through this time of journeying that at the end of the day you will be well pleased with us bless us now in your lovely name jesus christ we pray amen you may be seated one of the reasons why i chose this particular subject or i believe it's just god that brought it to me it was concerning me because when you have a condition or something that you're working with and you know that you can't overcome or you can't do it yourself you have to find someone or something that can do it we know that there is nothing impossible for god and god can do all things and uh so you know i'm claiming my victory in the situation that i'm speaking of and i'm just believing god that god is going to give me complete deliverance and thinking that way god brought it to my attention that the only way that this is possible is that you take me at my word and we understand that the gentiles according to brother branham we don't need signs we don't need wonders in that sense because remember the roman soldier when his servant was sick he told jesus i know what it is to be a master i know what it means to be a lord and that thy word that's all i need and this is the way we must believe this is a higher calling of what god is bringing us to and all of these trials and all of these tests are given to us because god wants us to depend on his word nothing comes easy because when it does it's really the value of it is not even worth anything everything that is of value comes the harder way i look at the psalms and i see david who have gone through so many trials and tests in his life and all he could say is i love thee and you know we say that too even when we fail god we still tell god i love you and then god replied to us if you love me keep my commandments it comes back to believing him and trusting him i looked up that word trust it means to a firm belief in the reliability of truth and ability or strength of someone you know we know god can and we know god will you say well how do you know god will because the prophet god told us that if there was a line of angels and then the son of god would step in that line he said who will god tend to first he would tend to the son because he is a son but the very fact that he he goes on to say uh you know that the lord is my rock and we understand that that word rock doesn't mean a stone it means a revelation i'm solid he's solid amen he's my fortress he's my protection and my deliverer now david says listen god is everything you let him be in times of trouble he shall hide me david said he'll place me upon a rock he'll give me a revelation that would lift me up beyond my trials and my tests he says my god is my strength when we talk about him being a deliverer that means that god is able to set me free no matter what the situations are and would be god is more than able to deliver us but we must believe that he is a deliverer hallelujah and when we talk about david said he he's my strength in whom i will trust you understand me my trust is my strength and my trust in him is my strength because we are frail and the bible said put no trust in the arms of flesh we can't even trust ourselves so we need someone to trust we need a word that has been tried and the word has been tried even when men wouldn't trust him god came through hallelujah it goes on to say that he's my buckler you know i for a long time i thought i knew what a buckler was but a buckler is a shield you've ever seen it those those super heroes they have those shields on the um that's what a buckler is either you can wear it around or you can wear it here is his buckler and when the enemy comes you do what you block his his dots with the buckler i thought it was something you wore around your waist and the horn of my salvation and my high tower you know what the horn is is power the horn even represents salvation and immortality in him is my my salvation and my immortality my high tower and you know i didn't see that that you know we think about a high tower but what it is is it's a vantage point and in in reality it he says i'm gonna lift you up out of your trials your situation i'm gonna place you in a place where you'll be looking down at the enemy and not only that you'll be able to see him from afar off can i say it like this i'm going to elevate your mind and put you into a higher dimension i'm going to let you think like christ because remember the bible says let this mind be in you never did jesus fear anything and he had an undisturbed faith because not only did he know who he was but he knew who god was and is in psalms 31 and 6 goes on to say i have hated them that regard lying vanities but i trust in the lord and you know what it is it's so easy amen to to to to to allow yourself to be part of some lion vanity but think about job i'm sorry think about jonah who was in the whale's belly and you and i have no idea how horrifying that was but jonah never looked at the circumstances because he knew his relationship with god and the bible tells us that jonah looked toward the temple because he remembered the word solomon david if you shall look toward the temple god no matter where you are god will hear you and answer you and so we look at these things and you say to my amazement i think sometime you know how i don't know the communication that went on between jonah and the whale but the whale knew which way to turn or either jonah in the well knew which way to turn and of course he didn't have any sense of direction like like we would have today but we must understand that the only way we can ever trust god we must learn how to delight in him you know i i i still go back to what i said last week when the bible says that the grass withers and the flowers fade away but the word of the lord shall stand i never seemed like i never saw it the way i see it now because the word of the lord is god he could never perish he can't vanish away there's no beginning there's no ending he is god and we're just a part of his creation we're like this tambourine in his hand y'all understand what i'm saying but he's the god of this tambourine that he could do something i can't do he could step in there but i can't he could become a part of it but that's not all of him you understand me so we look at this thing which is lord help me delight in your word how can we delight in it if we don't read it how can we delight in it if we don't study it how can we delight in it if we won't find time for it hallelujah you know i don't know about you but i have some things i delight in i delight in ice cream i delight in cake i delight in certain foods you know what i mean and when i want to delight in it guess what i go find it so i can delight it that's how the word's supposed to be y'all understand me when you enjoy something you're delighting in it that means you are being it brings pleasure to you and the word must bring pleasure now i'm speaking i'm talking to me you and i must understand that we're not where we should be oh my if i preach the message that i wanted to preach tonight my god have mercy on my soul things right in your face and you don't see it until god quickens it to you delight thyself also in the lord and he shall give thee the desires of thine heart that's the problem we fail to delight because this word cannot fail if we delight ourselves in the lord you say in the lord how can i delight god in the word is one in the beginning was the word the word with god and the word was god he is god the word is and so when you delight yourself in the word you're delighting yourself in the lord and the bible says he will do what give thee the desires of thine heart i don't know about you but my desires is not to have a great mansion or some fancy car my my desires is not to have a fancy trip you know what my desire is like david said that i might dwell in the house of the lord that i might behold the beauty woo i'm getting ready to cry up here i have only one desire and that is to serve the lord and i want to fully commit everything that i have in his trust and it goes on to say and he shall bring forth righteousness as the light and judgment as a new day he shall bring forth the word will bring forth the lord will bring forth we don't have to work it as long as we are delighting the life of the word will bring it forth it is the light that brings forth righteousness i love the seventh verse it says rest in the lord you don't have to worry about nothing when you are in the lord rest it's not you that do with the work he does the work and wait here it is patiently for him the trouble is we are slacking lacking patience amen we want it so fast and so quick but god don't even make trees grow like that and you are a tree little by little god is working on you he's not in a hurry he's a perfectionist i love that i want to be perfect let him perfect me i am his workmanship you are his workmanship created where in him who have known the mind of the lord or who have been his counselor anybody can tell me can you direct the lord the bible says the footsteps of a righteous man are ordered by the lord what absolutely even when you're walking in the valley in the shadow of death your footsteps are still being ordered by god oh my goodness you mean dangerous times through perilous times all of those kinds of times your times when you're upset the times when you're down in spirit the times amen when you're happy are glad all of those times are being directed by god moses could have said to israel moses could have said to god why you lead me out here like this to perish but all of that i love the way god does it he never tells you what the future holds but he'll definitely lead you into it and your future as you move through it is not always happy days hallelujah you understand me god will put you in trouble just to get you out how can he be a deliverer if he doesn't allow you to fall into bondage somebody should have shouted huh all of these things the bible says all things work together for the good of them that love the lord those who are called according to his purpose his purpose is the thing that's motivating him to do to you what he's doing and what we need to do is delight in it in all things the bible says give thanks job said the 14 2 says shall he that contendeth with the almighty instruct him he that reproveth god let him answer it and you know what that is it's when you contend but god you know how your children oh i don't you go into but oh go into the trash do i have to i did it tuesday you understand me it's the same thing we do with god god instructs us god gives us a place amen and walks us and take us through things and we are we we we give the big butt and why me because you prayed lord i want to be just like you that's why you prayed it and he answering your prayer but maybe not according to the way you want it to be answered but we must learn how to trust the word we must learn how to really trust god because if we're going to be and i'm jumping to my new message of his kind jesus never failed god at one or any point everything he was ordered to do he did it even when he didn't even want to what he didn't want to go to the calvary calvary of the cross and he says nevertheless father not my will but thine be done people look at a lot of abuses and they think my god you mean to tell me god allowed this to happen what do you mean he's the creator he knew it was going to happen before you got there but no matter what go you go through he has a time that he he has appointed to meet you what about the woman at the well she probably thought she was cursed and perhaps she was going to die like that but god allowed that to be so just to prove he is a deliverer and a healer because not only was she's a prostitute but she had some physical ailments as well oh my many things that happen to us it's because of our own decisions that we make but yet we want to blame it on god and who's going to reprove him who's going to tell him he's wrong who's going to tell him that there's a better way and that's your way it ain't happening the bible says we all sin and come short of the glory of god now i want to say something to you before i go to my next page i'm going to read a quote coming from the birth pains because a lot of times we don't understand if we can see where we're standing and where we need to go it would scare us half to death knowing that you got to know that you'll never get there until god take you there none of us amen can produce desperation desperation even desperation is given and caused by god hard trials and tribulations and all kinds of stuff will push you into a place of desperation because as men we're lazy dollatory right it takes god to even push us into a desperate mode now we find that rain which brings forth fruit upon the earth it's born as the porch says in the fields of thunder and ragged and jagged skies the little distilled drop of rain that's been lifted from the seas and distilled from salt it will not be born it takes that lightning thundering blast ragged rugged fearful thing to bring forth the soft petal drops of water it takes pain to bring forth birth and a lot of people on easy birth they want a scientific birth they want like a test tube baby hey they don't come through no pain they just test two babies but those who are born amen coming from in the natural way there is pain there's pain to the mother and there's pain to the child it is a frustrating time it's a time when you have to push when you don't feel like pushing but yet and still that's the way god has designed it some of us haven't cried tears in years if if any but let me tell you something there is no such thing as a dried eye conversion it takes dying as the clouds die rain right is born when they die the rain is born because rain is a part of that cloud one has to cease so the other one can exist and i want you to remember that because that's exactly where i'm going the next time i minister one has to cease in order to go the other one to exist so powerful but delight that depending on the word it's what we must learn how to do um it's kind of like what god told uh you know the the leopard name and i believe it was he go dip seven times why that you're gonna tend with god i mean come on anybody in their right mind know that this is the dirtiest rival around and how having leprosy which come from uncleanness how can it be cleaned but god is the only one can break something clean out of the unclean he's the only one i'm a witness on what god can do he can take the unclean and make him clean hallelujah but what it made no sense to the natural mind god didn't say to us his my his word has to make sense his word is on a level that we can't even comprehend so therefore it takes faith you must trust it had not named and dipped seven times he would have died a leopard six times wouldn't have done it five times would have done it four times would have done would not have done it he had to dip seven times because that was the word of the lord and you and i must understand when god said do something that's exactly what he says and that's exactly what he means hallelujah and we cannot reason it can you imagine staying up there in the upper room all those days i think it was 10. ten days shut up in that place with all those folks i don't know what they did and what they were doing but you know what i don't even know where the claustrophobia a but it had to be a very uncomfortable thing going on there and in the midst of that god tried them tried their patience tried them and 10 days amen they were rewarded guarantee you after those 10 days they thought it was worth it all see when god comes to reward you it's worth it all hallelujah taking god that is what we must come to a place we must come to that place people i said we because i'm including myself that we trust his word believe his word acknowledge his word to be true hallelujah proverbs 18 and 10 like i said he said the name of the lord is a strong tower the righteous runeth unto it and is safe hallelujah in other words he the righteous run it into it and it's set on high a tower that's lifted up up above the troubles which seemed to overwhelm have you ever felt the overwhelming and all when we do that we need to learn how to run the righteous running in and they are safe listen it is i be not afraid brother said i'm so glad that he is our safety zone he's the place where we can come and feel safe the thing i love about the lord jesus he'll never reject you ever reject you most of the time if you come to god he'll meet you on the way in the message god's chosen place of worship he said the only safety zone there is in the is is the lamb of god and him alone is salvation not in any church any creed any people any father any mother any holy man or nothing nothing no holy place it's in the holy god the lord jesus christ where god placed his name on a human being for redemption who paid the price for a sinners oh wait a minute now see we hear that all the time as if we owe god something you don't owe him nothing he paid the price the price has been paid you can't redeem yourself there is no price you need to pay for sinners for us sinners see that's the only place that there is salvation see that's the rock i stand on so when the devil is accusing you of your sins and your shortcoming let him know the bible said we have faults we will sin the bible said if a man say he have no sin he makes god a liar and the only reason why god counts us justified as he do does is because our lives are hid in him when i see the blood i pass over you it's not because you're so righteous no but the blood has been applied hallelujah who and where will you place your trust when we know by god's grace that everything is going to fall everything is failing everything is failing he said god said it was the whole heaven and earth is going to be on fire hallelujah it's going to be a renovation of the whole thing so a new world can be born god has prophesied it see she's rotten in all of her systems talk about the world she's got to do that to rot away that's why she says i said she is so nervous and red in the face and frustrated and earthquakes and everywhere and up and down the coast and tidal waves in alaska and shaking up and down the coast hallelujah of earthquakes and and things and people writing shall we leave it shall we leave it see they don't know what to do there's no safety zone y'all hear me the thing is we a lot of times we think oh there's a state no no not even in iowa there is no safety zone when the world began to reel and rock it ain't going to just happen in california it's going to be all over the world but how can you feel sheltered if you don't trust the word and the bible said he is our shelter he's our hiding place hiding with uh on what under the shadows of his weak people we have something that the world does not we've got a greater revelation of god than noah had huh and the bible said in i walk with god he in order to walk follow me follow me follow me is that right because that's what jesus said when he was uh recruiting or his his his followers follow me follow me follow me what was it the word was saying follow me follow me follow me and the reason why is because even when israel was a a nation that that had the the ark of the covenant the ark of the covenant went first the word went first and everything afterward had to follow god can't change his ways it's settled in heaven in order for us to achieve to achieve heaven we must follow the word and believe every word is that right there's only one thing that is the safety zone and that's in him all outside of there will perish just as certain as god said so a new creation god trying to get us to a place where we can see exactly what he's trying to do with us and you and i must understand that you know coming into this coming into this uh message is one of the greatest things that could have possibly happened to us and you and i must understand that the new creation is not a patched up job it is so new it's so distinct from the old one and how are we going to make except the creator do something this is not oh i choose god this is god chose us and if god predestinated us to be broad he has a work for us this is not the beginning ending this is the beginning and you and i must not complain about the situations and the tough times that we have listen i'm going through some tough times now but i realize that everything i'm going through has been ordained by god why should i feel fear in my way i gotta cry sometime no i'm not saying in the blues not gonna do it i will enter his gates with thanksgiving in my heart i will enter his courts with praise hallelujah why because this is the day that the lord is made and i shall rejoice and be glad in it i've got one more scripture i told you i'm not gonna be long this is wednesday everybody's tired and it's quite warm in the place turn with me one more one two psalms 102 psalms 102. you love the lord i trust this is a blessing this is just a little prelude to where i'm going uh by god's grace and i'm grateful i'm i can't i can't express i'm trusting that what god has revealed in to me will be quickened in me until i am exactly what what he has ordained me to be uh and that is the bride of jesus christ psalms 102 we'll begin at the 16th verse when the lord shall build up zion he shall appear in his glory y'all get that one that doesn't need to be explained or defined right when did he appear in our day in his glory he showed he was a healer he showed he was a deliverer he showed that he had he could he could he he he knew your thoughts how did he do that by way of malachi 4. that was god's appearing in his glory did y'all know that you said well what do you mean in the glory that's what i said the last time in his glory lord let the glory that we i had with you from the beginning be with them what was the glory god in you that is the glory god and man coming together you becoming a new creature creation a god man the bible showed us amen in revelation uh where the glory of god was upon the bride see you got to understand what the glory is that's why jesus never sought a reputation he always pointed back to god the spirit because he understood he never did anything it was god in him that did everything and you're not that is the glory of the lord right the glory of the lord it comes down on on the cherubims and set there amen on the altar hallelujah those things weren't sacred only when the glory of god was upon it wasn't unholy about those things that they made they were made out of metal they were made out of excuse me they were made out of natural things but oh when the glory of god came down that's what israel feared they feared the glory of god so much so the glory of god was in moses that he had to hide his faith he had to veil himself that's the kind of glory that god wants in us that we're so much like him we'll pull him out of heaven hallelujah he will regard the prayer of the destitute i love this and not despise their prayer sometimes we just can't be honest with god because we're so afraid that he's going to despise it let me tell you something that maybe you don't know god knows exactly what's in your heart and he knows every word that you're going to express to him before you express it he knows how filthy and dirty we could be come on it's the truth god ah i didn't know that no he knew that he knows that and the thing is we need to be honest with him you don't get before god and says lord forgive me of my known and my unknown sins come on you know what your sins are you know what you're thinking you know even the desires that you entertain even though they weren't yours you took them in from the devil he knows that and you need to tell god about it lord this is the way i was thinking it was wrong and i'm so sorry you say well brother books you do that absolutely let me tell you something the first time i had to really come clean with god was very very difficult because you know what i didn't know for some reason i thought he didn't know i was it was in revelation that he understood the very intents of my heart it was not a revelation so i thought in my confession i was kind of like telling god something he did not know already you know that's quite dumb right but that's just how dumb i was but guess what i call it like it is just like it was this shall be written listen for the generations to come and the people which shall be created shall praise the lord i'm gonna leave it just there what people what people that's being created now jesus christ the beginning of god's creation oh i got so many so good stuff but i ain't gonna go with it the truth of the matter is we worry about things we should not worry about and so that you'll understand change only comes by god you know we used to there used to be a song in the question that was asked what could grow without snow or rain in that song and i can't remember the whole thing but i really used to like that song and that was the phrase that i really liked and the end of that was a rock can grow without snow or rain and uh so anyway god is the only thing god is the only one that can make a man grow y'all know what i'm saying i have a friend now he's he's a short fella and he for a long time thought when i get to heaven you know i'm going to be 6-3-6-4 i'm like no when you get to heaven you're going to have the same height you got now right somehow people think when i get to heaven what they describe as being perfect they don't understand it ain't the house that god perfects it's the character you see that's what god looking at nature change and you and i must understand as we are at all the hard times we're going through the trials and tests this is just the beginning you know when i'm baking a cake you know i said don't tell me about that but anyway when i do that i put it on a certain degree for a certain hour but when i'm ready to crown it i turn that thing back turn it up to a certain degree to make sure it's smooth you know what i'm trying to say what i'm trying to say is this god got it at a certain temperature but in order to bring you to the place he wants you to be or wants us to be he's going to turn the fire up you're going to have to trust him brother branham said it like this he said it was it was the hebrew boys it was set seven times hotter and he says this age is seven times hotter than what they had and you know what that was all about to test their faith and guess what brother madam said they may have had an all-night prayer and god never answered the prayer but they were so convinced that god was god they said even if he don't answer i'll never bow down to you devil see what i'm saying even if he doesn't answer i'm not going to bow to the devil i'll stay with his word like they used to sing that song and that old pentecostal church i believe i'll run on to see what the end is going to be less than heavenly father we come before you lord it's homeless we know how and we thank you for your goodness and your grace in the word of god i've got a hiding place there is no place to hide it's just staying in the word of god we thank you father for those who came out tonight i pray that the word was a blessing to them has been to me i pray father that you quicken these these dead places in me bring everything to life shine through me lord shine through us help us lord jesus to be what you said we would be we hear it we see it but lord we must believe it with all of our heart in order for it to come to pass i believe it was john ryan the guy who came up for prayer he was blind paper boy brother branham prayed for him and he said he believed but he kept coming back up through the line and brother brandon said i thought you said you believe see once you really believe you don't have to have a second chance you don't need to come back up but you got to confess you believe that john ryan would get out there in the corner says extra extra read all about it i'm healed he kept confessing it until that confession became part of him and you and i must only understand that the battle is the victory is already given [Music] but we must continue to confess it i don't care if you fall you fall you fall you must confess your bride you must confess your perfect you must confess your victory you must confess your deliverance if you only keep confessing it brother brown said there's an angel listening that will bring it to pass he'll make it happen and you and i must understand we got all heaven on
