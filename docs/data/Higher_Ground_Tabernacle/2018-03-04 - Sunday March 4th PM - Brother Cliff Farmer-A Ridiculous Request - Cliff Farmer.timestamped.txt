[6:15] thank you brother man you loving this
[6:21] evening well I'll probably be
[6:26] short-winded tonight I don't have enough
[6:28] voice to be long-winded so but I'm
[6:31] thankful to be able to give my voice for
[6:33] him yeah good to see you brothers from
[6:35] Iowa City just want to say one more time
[6:40] we sure appreciate getting the
[6:42] opportunity to come and speak to you and
[6:45] appreciate for the Isaiah having
[6:48] confidence in us tough enough to ask us
[6:50] to come you know I told someone I said
[6:53] it it's good when a brother has enough
[6:55] confidence to ask you to come but then
[6:56] when he can come and and when you can
[6:58] come and he can leave town and trust you
[7:00] you know that's I kind of like that so
[7:04] tonight if we could let's just turn to
[7:06] Luke chapter 8 and it's got a very
[7:10] simple thought on my heart this evening
[7:12] something Lord is laid on me let's tell
[7:17] him brother Jon today as we we left the
[7:19] church here I said I have no idea what
[7:21] I'm preaching tonight not a clue and got
[7:25] in the car we went back to those days
[7:27] and packed up we got in the car and I
[7:29] said I still don't know what I'm
[7:30] preaching tonight so kind of opened up
[7:34] my notes and I so well I guess there's
[7:36] the answer so it's what the Lord is kind
[7:38] of laid on me Luke chapter 8 verse 40
[7:41] and it came to pass when Jesus was
[7:43] returned the people gladly received him
[7:46] for they were all waiting for him and
[7:49] behold there came a man
[7:51] named Jairus and he was a ruler of the
[7:54] synagogue and he fell down at Jesus feet
[7:56] and besought him that he would come into
[7:59] his house for he had only one daughter
[8:03] about twelve years of age and she lay
[8:06] dying but as he went the people thronged
[8:09] him and a woman having an issue of blood
[8:11] twelve years which had spent all her
[8:13] living upon physicians neither could be
[8:16] healed of any came behind him and
[8:18] touched the border of his garment and
[8:20] immediately her issue of blood stopped
[8:23] you can be seated I want you to kind of
[8:26] hold yet that place in the scripture
[8:28] we're gonna continue on but I just I
[8:31] want to kind of dramatize this story but
[8:33] you see what's what's happening here
[8:36] Jairus daughter falls sick you know as
[8:41] any loving parent would be they they
[8:43] took her you know they prayed for they
[8:46] took her to the doctor and there comes a
[8:48] point where the doctor can do nothing
[8:50] else and and you know I've been there my
[8:53] daughter she had a infection that was in
[8:56] her eye and and we were at the hospital
[8:59] Children's Hospital out in North
[9:00] Carolina and the infection was actually
[9:03] going behind her eye and they they told
[9:05] us they said we've we've been putting
[9:07] the IV in and it's not working and they
[9:10] said you know they said if this
[9:11] infection gets behind her eye it could
[9:13] go to a brain and kill her and you know
[9:15] as a parent when you get to this point
[9:18] you you're falling apart
[9:20] you know because I realize there was
[9:22] nothing that I could do there was
[9:24] nothing that the doctor could do and the
[9:26] only way out was if Jesus come on the
[9:29] scene and so here's Jarius knowing that
[9:32] doctors done all he can do daddy's done
[9:34] all he can do
[9:35] Namah has done all she can do and so he
[9:39] has one
[9:40] excuse me one way of escape and that's
[9:43] to get to Jesus if I can tonight I want
[9:47] to title this a ridiculous request a
[9:50] ridiculous request so Jairus runs and he
[9:55] finds the group of people around Jesus
[9:57] and as you could imagine faith was
[9:59] building in Jerry's heart if I get to
[10:02] Jesus everything will be okay if
[10:04] I can just get to where he's at if I can
[10:06] just tell him what's going on everything
[10:09] will be all right and as he gets to
[10:11] Jesus he sees that there's a little
[10:13] woman that comes behind him verse 44
[10:16] said and touched the border of his
[10:17] garment and immediately her issue of
[10:19] blood stopped and Jesus said who touched
[10:23] me when all denied Peter they when all
[10:27] denied Peter and they that were with him
[10:29] said master the multitude throwing thee
[10:31] and pressed thee and thou sayeth who
[10:34] touched me and I'll just show you if you
[10:36] take those words back in the Greek Jesus
[10:39] asked who touched me and Peter says
[10:42] every one is touching you but it's two
[10:46] different words to describe the word
[10:48] touch when Jesus said who touched me if
[10:51] you go back in the Greek the meaning of
[10:53] the word is who latched on to me and
[10:56] Peter says Lord every one is touching
[10:59] you but if you take that word in the
[11:01] Greek it says every one is brushing up
[11:03] against you and Jesus is saying no I
[11:05] know every one is rubbing up against me
[11:08] but someone latched on to me
[11:11] oh let me tell you tonight I don't want
[11:14] you to rub up against the Holy Spirit I
[11:16] don't want you to just feel his presence
[11:18] tonight but if you can latch on to
[11:21] Jehovah Jireh if you have a sickness
[11:24] tonight
[11:25] latch on to it if you have much repair
[11:28] Tony tonight latch on to him he said
[11:35] someone somebody has touched me for I
[11:40] perceive that virtue is going out of me
[11:42] she latched on to him so hard that it
[11:45] turned him in his tracks she latched on
[11:47] to him and when everyone else was
[11:49] grabbing ahold of him and latching on to
[11:52] him but they were not latching on in a
[11:54] spiritual way they had touched His
[11:56] garment but nothing had happened but a
[11:57] little woman with faith said oh if I can
[12:00] but touch the hem of His garment I want
[12:02] to share this for you this is the third
[12:04] pole in operation because there was no
[12:06] scripture promising then if she touched
[12:08] the hem of His garment she'd be made
[12:10] well there was no prophet that had ever
[12:12] said if you touch the hem of His garment
[12:14] you'll be made well but my faith and by
[12:17] the spoken
[12:18] she made her own promise and in her
[12:21] faith brought it to pass tonight make
[12:24] your own promise you say brother I don't
[12:28] know it seems ridiculous it's time to
[12:30] ask God for ridiculous things and when
[12:38] the woman saw she was not hid she came
[12:40] trembling and falling down before him
[12:42] she declared unto Him before all the
[12:45] people for what cause she had touched
[12:46] him and how she was healed immediately
[12:50] watch this here's Jarius trying to get
[12:53] to him and before he can even get to him
[12:56] a testimony service starts of what's
[12:58] already going on can you imagine the
[13:00] faith in the man I know my daughter's
[13:03] gonna be well now I know everything's
[13:05] gonna be back and he said daughter be of
[13:10] good comfort that feat that's made the
[13:13] whole go in peace Jairus is next in line
[13:18] he's ready to ask the scripture says
[13:22] while he yet spake there cometh one from
[13:25] the ruler of the synagogue's house
[13:26] saying to him my daughter is dead
[13:30] trouble not the master what a turn of
[13:36] events
[13:38] what a change here ease his faith is
[13:42] built he's ready he's already one touch
[13:45] the miraculous happened and he knows his
[13:48] daughter's not dead yet and then someone
[13:51] comes and says look I know you've come
[13:54] this far
[13:54] I know you had faith and I know that you
[13:59] believed you was going to get to him in
[14:01] time but your daughter's dead quit
[14:05] bothering Jesus because you see it'd be
[14:09] ridiculous brother Mike to ask Jesus to
[14:12] come pray over something that's too far
[14:14] gone but there's nothing too far gone
[14:18] with Jesus when he walked down to the
[14:21] tomb of Lazarus he had been dead beyond
[14:24] the point of coming back remember
[14:26] because he'd been dead for days the
[14:28] earth the skin worms was already
[14:30] devouring him
[14:31] but the same God that called for 16
[14:35] elements out of the earth to form the
[14:37] body of Alan of Adam's cheese Lee could
[14:40] call the 16 elements out of an earthworm
[14:43] back to create Miller Bantam said his
[14:46] knows that I already fell in but the
[14:48] power of the spoken word spoke over a
[14:50] ridiculous request and calls a man being
[14:54] eaten to stand back up and live well he
[15:01] hid speak he said my daughter's dead
[15:05] troubling off the master I think many
[15:09] times we hear the same words by the
[15:12] devil we've prayed and we've prayed and
[15:16] we don't see a way out and then we hear
[15:18] it quit bothering him quit asking him
[15:22] he's not going to do it quit praying
[15:24] quit having faith for your family it's
[15:28] not gonna work
[15:29] quit believing your wife will live this
[15:31] one day quit believing your children all
[15:33] serve God one day and he just whispers
[15:35] this stuff in your ear he tells you
[15:37] these things why he's saying don't
[15:39] trouble the master it's too far gone and
[15:44] I like the next verse it said but when
[15:47] Jesus heard it and we could in the
[15:50] service right there but when Jesus heard
[15:53] it everyone else has had their say so
[15:55] the doctor has said what he thinks about
[15:58] it
[15:58] the psychiatrist has said what he thinks
[16:01] about it the mayor said what he thought
[16:03] about it the runner came and said what
[16:05] he thought about it but when Jesus heard
[16:08] it
[16:08] oh let me tell you don't think for a
[16:11] minute when all the other negative
[16:14] testimonies are coming forth when all of
[16:16] them the negativity is being preached
[16:19] when when everything is is looking bad
[16:21] and everything wrong has been said Jesus
[16:24] has heard it but when Jesus heard it he
[16:29] answered him saying fear not believe
[16:35] only but
[16:40] good lord I was believing but now she's
[16:44] dead if you're not believe only but lord
[16:52] there's no way now he was talking to the
[16:57] waymaker about how there wasn't away he
[17:00] was talking to the one that part of de
[17:02] Red Sea about how there was no way to
[17:04] get across the sea fear not believe only
[17:10] and she shall be made whole and when he
[17:15] come to the house he suffered no man go
[17:18] in and save Peter and James and John and
[17:19] the father and the mother of the maiden
[17:21] and all wept now watch this
[17:25] he's already went out of his way to come
[17:27] back to the house now now the the healer
[17:31] the raiser of the Dead the the leper
[17:34] cleanser is in the house and everybody's
[17:38] still crying and he suffer no man to go
[17:43] in at Steve and all wept and to weld her
[17:47] but he said weep not she's only dead she
[17:52] she's not dead but sleepeth I want you
[17:56] to watch this next one and they laughed
[17:59] him to scorn now here's what we find out
[18:04] is that they're laughing didn't change
[18:05] anything but you understand it gets to a
[18:09] point to where everything looks so
[18:11] hopeless that when you speak faith you
[18:13] get laughed at when you speak that I
[18:16] believe God will still raise up the dead
[18:18] you're laughed at when you speak I
[18:21] believe I'm part of the rapture you're
[18:22] laughed at when you speak when the
[18:25] doctor said we give you up there's no
[18:27] more hope you get laughed at they all
[18:32] laughed but what's this they laughed him
[18:36] to scorn knowing that she was dead
[18:41] the reason they laughed him to scorn is
[18:44] because of how smart they were they knew
[18:47] look look Jesus we're not guessing about
[18:50] this we know we put it into
[18:53] terms sir this is the heart monitor it's
[18:56] flat you know I know whether she's alive
[19:00] or not okay
[19:02] you're smart you think you know we had a
[19:06] brother in our church just I don't know
[19:09] three months ago something like that he
[19:11] was sitting back near the back my dad
[19:13] was preaching and the brother just
[19:16] collapsed and we had a brother that was
[19:18] an EMT ran up to him and took his pulse
[19:21] he said he's dead few brothers went back
[19:25] and gathered around him and they laid
[19:26] his hand on him a cold for breath to
[19:28] come back in his body and a man looked
[19:31] up and he said what's going on he still
[19:35] the racer of the dead he still the owner
[19:40] of that line denies a brother was
[19:44] telling me he was overseas and he said
[19:45] he had preached that God was still the
[19:48] opener blinded eyes and he said a little
[19:51] woman come up for prayer and said you
[19:52] said it I believe it she said now you
[19:56] pray for me and he said I looked and I
[19:58] went oh boy he said I preached it but I
[20:03] didn't really know if I believe that or
[20:04] not but her faith remember jesus said
[20:08] your faith but her face she said you
[20:10] preached and I believed and he said I
[20:12] laid my hand on her and as I begin to
[20:14] pray she began to scream and her eyes
[20:16] come open he is still the same God today
[20:21] they laughed him to scorn knowing that
[20:26] she was dead but what's what he done and
[20:29] he put them all out you got to put
[20:33] people out sometimes when people are
[20:35] just negative you just got to put them
[20:37] out when people keep texting you
[20:39] negative thoughts you got to shut them
[20:41] off when people call you you got to hang
[20:43] up on them when people are constantly
[20:45] feeding you a negative report sometimes
[20:48] you got to just put them out they said
[20:51] he pulled him out and took her by the
[20:53] hand and called saying made a rise and
[20:58] her spirit came again and she a row
[21:02] straight way and he commanded to give
[21:04] her meat watch this not
[21:06] only did he raise her from the dead but
[21:08] now she is so made well don't give her
[21:11] milk but give her meat again
[21:13] when God does a job he doesn't the best
[21:16] when God gets finished with you you'll
[21:19] be ready to eat meat again
[21:21] and her parents were astonished but he
[21:25] charged them that they should tell no
[21:27] man what was done ridiculous a
[21:32] ridiculous request ridiculous to ask the
[21:35] master to pray for a dead one
[21:37] but the ridiculous was fulfilled brother
[21:41] branham said in 1954 he said God
[21:43] couldn't make sea serpents crawl out of
[21:45] the lake out there so big that would
[21:48] mash Chicago down if he seen fit to do
[21:51] so he said that sounds like it's
[21:54] mythical but he could do it he could
[21:56] create he said he can speak life into
[21:58] existence or he can speak out of
[22:00] existence he's God and we underestimate
[22:04] his being and his ability we
[22:07] underestimate God don't underestimate we
[22:11] underestimate I told the church here a
[22:14] while back and I don't mean it to be
[22:16] funny but Taco Bell you know they used
[22:18] to have the little saint you know then
[22:19] it's gonna put Godzilla in a box you
[22:21] remember and the Taco Bell commercial
[22:23] said I think you need a bigger box and
[22:26] I'm going to tell you if you're going to
[22:27] try and lock God in a box of humanity
[22:29] and our way of thinking
[22:30] you better get a bigger box because he
[22:33] is beyond our ways I I was telling Billy
[22:36] rich today at lunch the scripture said
[22:38] his ways are not always and his ways are
[22:41] past finding out you know sometimes we
[22:46] wonder why does things happen in our
[22:48] family let me tell you something there
[22:49] was a young boy at our church and he was
[22:51] serving God he was doing great he was
[22:53] singing I mean he was getting up and
[22:55] testifying and something turned and he
[22:58] ran right out and went to live for the
[23:00] devil and we thought wow what what what
[23:05] happened well he got hooked up with this
[23:09] girl that was just worthless you could
[23:11] tell by looking at her she wasn't worth
[23:13] shooting well about three months after
[23:17] he'd been dating her he brought her to
[23:19] church
[23:20] and you know she said I don't want
[23:23] nothing to do with those kind of people
[23:27] about two months later they just visited
[23:30] again and she was a little eased up
[23:33] about the church well about a month
[23:37] later they were sitting there and the
[23:40] power of God began to fall and I begin
[23:43] to call an altar call and I watched that
[23:46] little woman and that little boy get up
[23:48] and almost literally brother Isiah run
[23:51] to an altar and now that little girl is
[23:55] about one of the best preachers we got
[23:57] in town there was a sister saying the
[24:01] other day that's been raised in this
[24:02] message she said I know I don't live
[24:04] everything in the message but that don't
[24:06] make me a heathen she said hey don't
[24:08] live in a teepee and say you ain't in
[24:09] India now she's witnessing to her family
[24:13] she went back and told her mother she
[24:15] said you're going to live this message
[24:17] or my children won't stay in your home
[24:20] we don't understand what God's doing
[24:23] sometimes but there was a little seed
[24:25] out there and somebody had to go get her
[24:28] I don't understand that I can't explain
[24:31] it
[24:32] listen I can't explain time or either
[24:35] the way we look at things that shouldn't
[24:38] have happen
[24:39] God misjudged that one in our eyes but
[24:42] somehow it's written in the Holy
[24:44] Scripture because God's ways are past
[24:48] finding out we underestimate him it's
[24:54] what the Prophet said he should we
[24:56] underestimate him I told you I'm titling
[25:01] this a ridiculous request the word
[25:04] ridiculous means deserving ridicule
[25:08] silly or unreasonable see sometimes we
[25:15] have prayer requests that are
[25:16] unreasonable sometimes we're asking God
[25:19] to do things that there's no human
[25:22] reasoning that would tell you this can
[25:24] be done is that true they got to
[25:27] thinking you know there was a man one
[25:29] time he was sitting down by the walls of
[25:32] Jericho
[25:34] a little Bartimaeus you know he had done
[25:37] everything he knew to do and he had done
[25:39] like a lot of us do see he had a lamb
[25:42] and he his wife got sick and he said
[25:48] well Lord if you're Hiller I'll give you
[25:50] this see a lot of times we try to
[25:51] bargain with God Oh Lord I'll do this if
[25:54] you'll do that so the Lord heals us wife
[25:58] he gives up the lamb and he still got
[26:01] two turtledoves his daughter gets sick
[26:03] and he goes you know the story he goes
[26:05] and he says Lord if you heal my daughter
[26:07] I'll give you these turtle doves but
[26:11] then there come a point where there's no
[26:12] more seeing I'll ahem there's no more
[26:15] doves to make money and now Bartimaeus
[26:18] needs healing but there's one problem
[26:20] bartimaeus has no bartering tools he has
[26:25] nothing to offer God but he was tending
[26:29] there one day and he heard a noise and
[26:32] he remembered the scripture of his
[26:35] father Abraham when he was about to
[26:37] sacrifice Isaac he heard a noise and
[26:40] everyone else was hearing a fan crown
[26:43] but bartimaeus was hearing he is RAM in
[26:46] a thicket and boredom s beginning to
[26:50] scream Jesus I would say if you want
[26:53] something from him tonight don't be
[26:55] ashamed of scream Jesus those next doing
[26:59] those badness anointed people and met
[27:01] that a spirit and all that people said
[27:03] bartemaeus be quiet we don't do this in
[27:06] church they said please be quiet and he
[27:08] said Jesus listen don't worry about what
[27:13] the person next to you thinks about it
[27:15] don't worry about what the people that
[27:17] might walk by the building will think
[27:19] when they see you stagger out drunk in
[27:21] the spirit just scream Jesus it's
[27:28] ridiculous to think that Jesus was gonna
[27:33] walk over there and hear his voice above
[27:37] all the others but the scripture said
[27:40] that Jesus walked to him
[27:43] and he said bartemaeus arise now this is
[27:48] what the scripture tells us the
[27:50] scripture says that Bartimaeus throwing
[27:53] his coat to the side follow Jesus in the
[27:57] way well if you look back in that day
[28:00] and time to be a beggar you had to be a
[28:03] government-approved beggar and they gave
[28:06] you a special coat that says I got a
[28:09] problem oh you can go to a doctor and
[28:11] he'll tell you you you you need
[28:13] disability you can go to a doctor and
[28:15] tell you you got a mind problem but if
[28:17] you want to hold on to that you'll never
[28:19] get your healing
[28:21] so for Bartimaeus to wear the coat he
[28:25] had to hold on to the idea that I will
[28:28] be blind I will never get better
[28:31] but when sight come to his eyes he said
[28:34] Jesus I will cast my garment to the side
[28:38] because Bartimaeus was saying I will
[28:41] never be back here again I want to tell
[28:46] you something I used to wear a coat of
[28:48] lust but one night at an altar I got up
[28:51] and I casted my going to the side and I
[28:54] still look at that altar and say I'll
[28:57] never never never never be there again
[29:02] I'll never go back to where I was God
[29:10] have mercy I want to bring you out of
[29:14] the Bible now I got a precious friend
[29:18] down in Joplin Missouri
[29:19] we had a hernia operation he went to the
[29:23] doctor and I had the operation and
[29:26] something went wrong and they kept him
[29:29] in the hospital and kept working on him
[29:31] and kept working on him ended up they
[29:33] ran up a $95,000 hospital bill they
[29:38] still couldn't fix him so they sent him
[29:40] to Springfield Missouri
[29:42] and they finally got him taken care of
[29:44] but they run up a hundred and ten
[29:46] thousand dollar bill I'll never forget
[29:50] me and brother John here another brother
[29:52] in the church we were passing through
[29:53] and we we met with him and he said
[29:55] brothers honey prayer
[29:57] said I thought I had insurance and I had
[30:00] none he said now I got $200,000 in
[30:04] hospital bills that I've got to pay and
[30:08] I said brother Eric we're gonna pray
[30:10] he's a pastor of a church I said we're
[30:12] gonna pray and the Lord is going to take
[30:14] them hospital bills away well he called
[30:18] me about a month later and he said
[30:19] brother quit if you're not gonna believe
[30:21] this
[30:22] he said the joplin hospital sent me a
[30:25] letter and said because we messed up on
[30:28] the surgery we are riding off every bill
[30:31] you owe nothing so this this was his
[30:39] testimony he said brother cliff now all
[30:41] I've got to pay he is a hundred and ten
[30:44] thousand I said nonsense I said if he
[30:48] could get rid of ninety five he'll get
[30:50] rid of a hundred and ten a month later
[30:54] he called me on the phone he said
[30:55] brother you're not gonna believe this I
[30:57] said yes I am
[30:59] he said that hospital sent me a letter
[31:02] and said we have decided to deduct or
[31:05] bill to $900 I'm telling you the god of
[31:10] history has been raised up once again
[31:13] he's not a God that used to work
[31:15] miracles he's not a God that used to
[31:18] heal the sick but he's an alive present
[31:20] God today you all may have heard the
[31:25] story brother James Miller he was down
[31:29] in Nicaragua and a truck flipped over
[31:31] paralyzed him you know the story so
[31:33] brother Tim Hayden from Mountain North
[31:36] Carolina told me he supposed if he said
[31:38] the Lord told me to drive to Arkansas to
[31:41] pray over that man's feet that he could
[31:44] walk again and so as he was getting into
[31:47] the town there where they're at he said
[31:49] the Lord laid it on his heart to buy him
[31:51] a pair of shoes and he said well all
[31:53] right so he he said I walked into a
[31:55] store he said I didn't know what size he
[31:57] wore I didn't know what color he liked
[31:59] he said but I I walked past the aisle
[32:03] there and he said a certain pair of
[32:05] shoes stood out to me and he said I want
[32:07] that pair of shoes
[32:10] - brother James's house and he told
[32:12] sister Miller he said I've come to pray
[32:14] for him and he said I bought him a pair
[32:16] of shoes and he said when she opened up
[32:19] the box she began to cry
[32:20] she said brother this was the exact
[32:23] shoes he was wearing in the wreck and we
[32:26] lost them down there let me tell you
[32:31] somebody god
[32:32] I spoke to brother James after that and
[32:35] he was still sitting in the wheelchair
[32:36] and he said let me tell you something
[32:37] and he slapped his legs he said these
[32:39] legs are liars I am healed he said he
[32:45] said these feet they lie to me he said
[32:47] I'm already healed he said I don't know
[32:50] how long it'll take but I will rise from
[32:52] this chair I said brother with that kind
[32:55] of faith God would have to raise you you
[32:59] [Music]
[33:00] remember the story brother Billy Paul
[33:03] said he was standing there in the line
[33:05] he said that little that woman brought a
[33:07] little girl up in prayer and said she
[33:10] didn't have eyes not that she was blind
[33:12] he said didn't even have eyes in her
[33:13] sockets and he said that brother Branham
[33:16] this story stands out to me so much said
[33:17] brother Branham said we're going to pray
[33:19] for you and he said brother Branham
[33:21] begin to pray for eyes and he stopped
[33:22] praying and he said honey he wants to
[33:26] know not brother Branham wanted to know
[33:30] so you think sometimes little bitty
[33:33] matters don't matter to God but he said
[33:36] honey he wants to know what color you
[33:39] want she said I heard blue is nice
[33:46] brother Billy said I'll never forget he
[33:48] said daddy said bow your head but I
[33:50] couldn't he said I watched a blue light
[33:54] come down out of heaven and enter into
[33:56] her face and he said the most beautiful
[33:57] set of blue eyes you've ever seen was
[34:00] falling in her head I told this story in
[34:04] North Carolina brothers tear communes
[34:06] come up to him and he said brother cliff
[34:08] I want to share something with you he
[34:09] said I've met her and he said she still
[34:12] got the most beautiful blue eyes you've
[34:14] ever seen let me tell you he can still
[34:17] do it tonight

[34:27] but you'll understand now where I got my
[34:29] title will abandon said I heard it say
[34:34] again you are hunting and you need game
[34:35] how many do you need
[34:37] and I thought now I don't want to overdo
[34:41] this that's the problem we shortchanged
[34:46] God well I know what he's saying speak
[34:49] the word but I don't want to over speak

[35:30] to get three young red squirrels and he
[35:34] said which way will they come you're the
[35:39] one talking now you tell him how you
[35:41] want it you want healing tell him how
[35:44] you're going to get it
[35:45] brother we got at some point we got to
[35:48] start using I mean let me step away from
[35:51] this for a second when I first became an
[35:53] assistant manager I'll never forget I
[35:55] walked into my boss's office and I said
[35:57] hey I it was like the first week I was
[35:58] in management and I said this says needs
[36:01] a manager signature I hand it to him he
[36:03] goes you sign it I don't need to and I
[36:05] said but it it's you know I mean I was
[36:08] wearing the name tag that said manager I
[36:11] told everybody I put it on Facebook that
[36:13] now I was a manager and he said you sign
[36:19] it I said but it says it needs a manager
[36:21] signature he goes yeah well you are one
[36:25] see I think that's what we do a lot of
[36:27] times we go well I'm a believer and and
[36:29] then it says someone needs to sign the
[36:31] check so my family can be
[36:32] we go well we walk around the search
[36:34] going I wish somebody could sign this
[36:36] you said you as a believer you said you
[36:38] were the Bride of Christ you said you
[36:40] were the Queen of Heaven you sign for it
[36:44] he said which way will they come I
[36:46] thought well I've went this far there's
[36:50] something talking to me here just the
[36:52] same as you hear me talking and God in
[36:54] heaven and this Bible over my heart
[36:55] knows that's true and I said well I
[36:58] picked out a ridiculous place this is
[37:03] where I got my message
[37:04] an old dry lamb hanging out there about
[37:07] 50 yards where my rifle was shot in I
[37:09] said the first one will be right there
[37:11] and there he was it's that simple he
[37:16] said I rubbed my eyes I turned back my
[37:18] head and I thought I don't want to shoot
[37:19] a vision so I looked around again and
[37:22] there set the squirrel
[37:23] I thought of shelling my gun aim and I
[37:25] could see his black eye I thought maybe
[37:27] I'm sleeping and I'll wake up in a few
[37:29] minutes I'm dreaming about this eye
[37:30] level down shot the squirrel that
[37:32] dropped off the limb and I thought well
[37:34] should I go over and look for it he said
[37:36] and there at late I picked it up and
[37:38] blood run out of it a vision don't bleed
[37:39] you know so I picked it up and it was a
[37:41] squirrel I got real nun all over I bet
[37:44] he did
[37:45] oh let me tell you it would do us good
[37:48] to get real numb all over I know that
[37:51] we're beyond Pentecost but let me tell
[37:53] you something it would do you good to
[37:55] stagger out of the church once a lot
[37:58] listen I'm talking about praying for
[38:02] people brother you know what I'm talking
[38:04] about you pray for people until you walk
[38:06] out of the church and you're walking
[38:08] sideways and you finally just lean up
[38:10] against the building because you can't
[38:12] do nothing they nothing like it you know
[38:17] the problem most people they never got
[38:19] to that spot there was a brother in our
[38:22] church he was telling our pastor he said
[38:24] I don't I don't believe in all this
[38:26] speaking in tongues he said I just don't
[38:27] think there's any need for it and I
[38:29] think you guys are going too far but
[38:32] they've said that's all right so a few
[38:34] months later brother Dave was preaching
[38:35] a meeting and he took this brother with
[38:37] him as his driver and he said I prayed
[38:40] and said Lord I'm asking you to let that
[38:42] man speak in tongues all over that place
[38:47] he said the Spirit of the Lord chopped
[38:50] down that man began to speak in another
[38:53] tongue and rattled and rattled and
[38:55] rattled he said when we got back in the
[38:56] car
[38:57] he said I'll agree one said I don't know
[38:58] about all these people speaking in
[39:00] tongues let me tell you if you ever get
[39:03] in there you'll know about it all right
[39:06] [Music]
[39:10] he said I looked around and said God
[39:12] that was you he said thank you for this
[39:14] now I'll go and he said but you said now
[39:21] watch what he says here but you said do
[39:25] you doubt what you said not you doubt
[39:29] what I said to get out what you said
[39:31] remember what I said earlier you've got
[39:33] to make your own promise if I can touch
[39:35] the hem of His garment I'll be you make
[39:37] your own promise tonight let me tell you
[39:41] something if you decide tonight that if
[39:43] you come up and touch this red carpet
[39:45] you'll be made whole you'll have to do
[39:46] it but it ain't a promise in the Bible
[39:50] no it's your promise you write the book
[39:54] he said well he said you said you'd get
[39:58] three now where will the next one come
[40:00] from I thought well if I'm dreaming I'm
[40:03] gonna continue on so I picked out an old
[40:06] post over there a tree that was wrapped
[40:08] up with poison ivy you never get a
[40:10] squirrel in that it's ridiculous and I
[40:15] said the next one will come out of that
[40:16] poison ivy and there said a young red
[40:18] squirrel looking at me I set my gun down
[40:20] and rubbed my eyes and turned around
[40:22] again and I thought berry scent
[40:24] turned his head sideways I shot the
[40:26] squirrel and then I started to go home
[40:28] but said you said you said three I was
[40:36] preaching a youth meeting in Florida
[40:37] here a few years back and this young man
[40:39] come up for prayer seeking the Holy
[40:40] Ghost brother Brooks and we prayed over
[40:42] him and I'm gonna tell you he didn't get
[40:44] it I knew that and he said brother I
[40:48] don't know what to do I said I'll tell
[40:50] you what to do I said when you get out
[40:52] of church tonight I want you to call
[40:53] home so I want you to tell your parents
[40:55] that you got the Holy Ghost at the youth
[40:58] meeting in Florida yes look at me I said
[41:03] yeah he said why I said because brother
[41:07] Branham said your body has to line up to
[41:09] your testimony I said this meeting ain't
[41:13] over it was a Friday night I said it
[41:15] ain't over I said so what we're gonna do
[41:16] is we're gonna I said everybody you talk
[41:19] to now tell them you got the Holy Ghost
[41:21] you tell your mom and daddy you got you
[41:24] call whoever you can and tell them you
[41:25] got it and I said if you'll believe it
[41:27] then before you leave here God will have
[41:31] to make your body match your testimony
[41:34] and I'm here to tell you before that boy
[41:37] left Florida he had received the Holy
[41:39] Ghost we gotta start speaking it do you
[41:45] doubt what you said I said no Lord
[41:47] I don't doubt what I said watch now
[41:51] I don't out what I said for your
[41:53] confirming there was this one scripture
[41:56] that stumped me not if I say but if you
[41:58] say not if Jesus said it but if you say
[42:01] it yourself
[42:02] and I thought somehow I've broke into
[42:06] that channel and I know he's here
[42:09] because I'm almost beside myself
[42:12] now here I love it he said I thought I
[42:15] will make this one ridiculous
[42:18] sure enough the prophet of God said if
[42:22] he's going to let me speak like this I'm
[42:24] gonna make it crazy I'm gonna make it
[42:29] remember ridiculous I'm gonna make it
[42:31] deserving of ridicule I'm gonna make it
[42:34] unreasonable I'm gonna make it silly she
[42:38] sometimes there's things that we want
[42:39] but we think that's silly
[42:40] ask it anyway well I don't know Berkley
[42:43] if it just it's so small and it's
[42:45] significant speak it anyway frankly if
[42:48] it seems too far speak it anyway my
[42:50] children is too far gold speak it anyway
[42:52] not healings through Fargo speak it
[42:55] anyway and I said now I want you to
[43:00] listen to the detail of this I said
[43:01] there
[43:02] red squirrel come down off that hill
[43:03] come right down this way right by me go
[43:06] out sit on that limb look down there at
[43:09] that farmer and here he come down the
[43:11] hill went right out sat and looked at
[43:13] the farmer and I shot him Satan said to
[43:19] me you know what the woods is just full
[43:20] of them now and I sit there till twelve
[43:23] o'clock and not another thing happen to
[43:25] show that God is the very creator of
[43:27] heaven and earth yes God's the Creator
[43:33] but William Branham was the one speaking
[43:36] tonight he's the healer but it's up to
[43:39] you to speak it tonight he is the
[43:42] revealer but it's up to you to speaking
[43:44] tonight he's the deliverer but it's up
[43:46] to you it's time to ask for the
[43:53] ridiculous
[43:54] I want to read you a scripture here
[43:57] Matthew 8:28 and when Jesus was come to
[44:00] the other side into the country of the
[44:03] Girt Girja scenes there met him two
[44:07] possessed with Devils coming out of the
[44:10] tombs exceeding fierce so that no man
[44:12] might pass by that way and behold they
[44:16] cried out saying what have we to do with
[44:18] thee Jesus thou son of God art thou come
[44:21] hither to torment us before the time
[44:24] and there was a good way off from them
[44:28] and heard of many swine feeding so the
[44:31] devil's besought him the devils are now
[44:36] praying if thou cast us out suffer us to
[44:42] go away into the herd of swine and he
[44:47] said unto them go now you might ask why
[44:54] am I reading that well it's very simple
[44:58] scripture said if you ask anything in my
[45:00] name I'll do it and even when demons
[45:08] asked him in the right attitude he had
[45:11] to meet their requests
[45:13] if God would meet the prayer request of
[45:17] the demons in the body of Legion how
[45:21] much more would he answer the request of
[45:25] the bride of Jesus Christ they said send
[45:30] us through the herd in Jesus name any
[45:32] sinner and then he brought healing to
[45:34] that body let me tell you something he
[45:36] wants to do it for you tonight you might
[45:44] know this story I'm trying to close now
[45:46] I'm just gonna wrap it up but there was
[45:49] a sister there was a sister that went
[45:53] through the prayer line and the meaning
[45:54] of brother Tim proves Church for her son
[45:58] that was not serving the Lord you
[46:01] probably know this story y'all know what
[46:03] I'm talking about you know what brother
[46:06] she went up for prayer for her son that
[46:08] wasn't serving the Lord and she said I'm
[46:10] asking the Lord to bring my son home
[46:12] well this prayer line goes on and on and
[46:15] on and this boy was out taking a nap and
[46:20] they said pretty soon the Deacons heard
[46:23] something crashing through the woods and
[46:24] he had a real nice pretty truck and he
[46:28] had drove that truck through ditches
[46:30] through the woods they said the truck
[46:33] was trashed by the time he got to the
[46:35] church because church had lasted a
[46:38] little long and he woke up from his nap
[46:41] and nobody was home and he called and he
[46:43] couldn't find nobody and he thought the
[46:46] rapture had taken place and while that
[46:49] prayer line was still yet going he was
[46:51] driving through fields because he
[46:54] couldn't even see the road he was crying
[46:55] so hard and they said the Deacons
[46:58] carried him through the prayer line and
[46:59] he received the Holy Ghost right there
[47:02] in that prayer life let me tell you you
[47:05] know we pray like maybe in the five
[47:07] years it'll happen but before she could
[47:09] get out of the prayer line her son was
[47:11] in the line behind her we serve a mighty
[47:14] God
[47:15] [Music]
[47:18] I'll give you some ridiculous requests I
[47:21] told the church in Iowa City about my
[47:23] dad he was born crippled doctor said
[47:25] he'd never walk again but he was sitting
[47:27] and only believed in 1961 in Chicago
[47:29] brother Branham called out my grandpa he
[47:32] said you're sitting back there he said
[47:33] your name's farmer you're praying about
[47:35] your son's feet
[47:36] he said he's healed in the name of the
[47:37] Lord you ought to hear my dad tell that
[47:40] story they told him that he would never
[47:42] wear anything but special built shoes
[47:44] and when he tells it for those aliens it
[47:46] like this he says I've wore cowboy boots
[47:48] flip-flops Indian moccasins he said I
[47:51] wore everything but a pair of special
[47:53] built shoes our pastor's wife was
[48:00] diagnosed with cancer the doctor said
[48:02] she'd never lived they said we're going
[48:05] to cut her open but she'll stay even if
[48:06] we take the cancer she'll never live
[48:08] through it and so when they went to
[48:10] surgery they cut her body open and the
[48:12] cancer fell out in the floor already did
[48:17] he's a mighty God our sole leader back
