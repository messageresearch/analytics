stand let us turn to Hebrews 7 we're going to read the first three verses there glad to have her here today the battles are raing God has made Us Victorious Hallelujah and the Bible says the suffering of this world cannot be comp compared to the things in which God for us I believe am Hebrews 7 beginning at the first verse for this mzc king of Salem priest of the most high God who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the Kings and blessed him to whom also Abraham gave gave a tenth of all first being by interpretation king of righteousness and that also king of Salem which is king of peace without father without mother without descent having neither beginning of days nor end of life but made like unto the Son of God abideth a priest [Music] continually we're just going to stay with that one particular scripture right now let us have a word of prayer dear heavenly father God we thank you for your Gra Grace and your mercy we thank you for the reading of your word hallelujah we thank you for your anointing Lord father we thank you for a sincere prayer Lord you have forgiven us of our sins you have Sanctified us you have anointed us with your Holy Spirit and father we thank you right now for knowing that we're one of yours in spite of our ways in spite of our faults Lord God we have Hallelujah no fear because we have an assurance Hallelujah of who we are where we came from and where we're going bless the service tonight in a special way bless each and every heart break and restore the yolks of the enemy Lord in your lovely name Jesus Christ we pray amen amen you may be seated I'd like to entitle this message God changing his fashion I say that again God IM changing his fashion when we think about fashion of course we think about clothing and styles things of that nature accessories or something you know worn people at a certain time it just seemed to be contagious because everybody want to look like each other where the same stuff but I want you to understand that God was the first to change his fashion but it wasn't uh manmade it was always something God would do now we know by the message of the hour who mzc is and we understand that mzc was the high priest of the most high God understand who he really was MDC was and is God and the revelation of who mzc was was given to Abra Abraham so much so that Abraham gave him a Tain of all that he had hallelujah amen and Abraham called him the king of righteousness also the king of Salem which is the king of Peace because it was after the mighty battle that mzc showed up Hallelujah and We Know by the grace of God that our mzc our Lord Jesus Christ will show up after the battle is over one thing about God God Eternal when we think about who he is our minds can't comprehend the vastness of who he is and God gives us bits and pieces of himself to reveal himself often time we look at the Bible and we think all this is all God and it is but it's not all of God because there are things that we will come to see and know that's not written in the book all Paul could say was is is that eyes have not seen nor ears have heard has in store for us hallelujah and while scientists are trying to find out the answer to Evolution the Bride of Jesus Christ we know how it was evoluted we understand the process of God and we know that it is by the spoken word God created all things Hallelujah and we understand amen that God didn't have to mix anything to produce what he wanted God spoke whatever his thoughts were he placed it in seed form Hallelujah Not seeds as in many one seed in that seed every living thing that belongs to that seed was produced by that seed Hallelujah and God had an order don't you mingle the seed because each seed must bring forth of its kind everything that we see is a shadow and a type or an expression of God hallelujah hallelujah when God began his creation it was not three persons it was one person hallelujah amen understanding we hardly ever think that that that God changed into a person because the Bible said he was a spirit and he is a spirit but when he took that spirit and he formed a person he formed the person that was in the image and likeness of God hallelujah it was a man Hallelujah and and we are the highest order of God understand what I mean by person because before no one could see him Hallelujah he was a spirit but when he changed into a person or he presented himself in a person we now we're able to see him Hallelujah is that right he did not produce three persons he produce one person Hallelujah but in this one person he had three Divine manifestations of himself that he wanted to manifest Hallelujah he was God in creation he was son in Redemption and he's the Holy Ghost church today in other words he changed his fashion Hallelujah he became the god of immor even as a prophet of God he changed his mind or he changed his mask excuse me Hallelujah but to understand God it cannot be learned in school it's not it's not by education God reveals himself Hallelujah God knows how to to hide and God knows how to reveal Hallelujah you can stand right next to a person and God can reveal himself to you and the person that's sitting by you won't be able to see what you see that's how God is God can speak to me and you can you won't be able to hear it is that right when God spoke to Paul on the road to Damascus Hallelujah they said it thundered but Paul heard the voice of God and he said who th Lord hallelujah capital L O R D who are th Elohim Hallelujah and he said I am Jesus it was at that time who studied the Old [Music] Testament God in a person hallelujah amen the first time he had seen the cherubims he had seen the altar he seen the temple all of the gold and the silver but he never understood or never ever had met the God who created all of that he saw God in symbols but when Jesus identified himself as pill of fire as person who led the children of Israel out out of Egypt Hallelujah see Paul was familiar with with the pill of fire so when Paul was converted he didn't go to an intellectual school but the Bible said he went into the Arabian Desert and he stayed there 3 years and all he did was learn about the God he met on the road to Damascus Hallelujah see the entire Bible is God and to understand the Bible it must come by Revelation hallelujah amen we've got a great many doctors of divinity I met a man the other day we were talking about God he was interested in how many degrees I had you know I gave just enough to know that I had a little bit of education but then he he came and he said he had a doctor of this this Theology and that Theology and I and I sat there and I thought but do you know God youve studied about him but do you know him Hallelujah cuz when and as I spoke of the Holy Ghost seemed to go over his head when I talk about the miraculous and how God heals he couldn't comprehend it see you don't even know God until you see him in his resurrection Hallelujah that's why Paul said I don't want to just know him in his resurrection only I want to know him in the power and demonstration in other words I want to see him prove himself to be alive y understand me the church is not a church if they cannot prove that the god they serve is a lie Hallelujah and you don't have to be educated I'm coming with this in just a moment God God kept moving and the Greek word isor is when one person changes his mask God God did a big thing here see on the day of Pentecost we we we saw God put on a lot of mask not just one but he put on a lot of is that right why persecuted thou me talking about the whole church and that whole church was one God and his name was Jesus y'all hear what I'm saying God Amen coming down in a different fashion this is why the world came where is this Jesus if he is alive where is he well you see what they don't understand is that he is alive Hallelujah but it's not not in just one body he is in a many body Church Hallelujah but he said you'll be able to recognize them because these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out Devils hallelujah hallelujah you love the Lord see the same God today is the Holy Ghost there's only one Holy Ghost Hallelujah not three persons in God head but one God and three manifestations hallelujah it's like me being a preacher Hallelujah is that right and I'm just Isaiah you understand me it's not three persons three offices of that person Hallelujah but I act the same way Hallelujah I've got different functions as a husband and I have different functions as a father and I have different functions as a son but I am the same one yall hear what I'm saying with one name Hallelujah my name is one and that's the way God is so so simple the same God today is the Holy Ghost not three persons in the godhead but one God and three manifestations the mystery of God has been covered up is now being uncovered Hallelujah is that right he seek to find talking about God he he seeks to find those whove been ordained to be his body to be his bride understand me God seek those you say God don't seek well you didn't find God God found you Hallelujah and the Bible said he seeketh those that are lost Hallelujah so we must first recognize we were lost but let me say it like this if I lost a diamond ring and it was covered by mud if I thought if I was to pick the diamond ring up thinking it was just a CLA of mud and then I began to discover that under the mud is a diamond ring well the mud never changed what it was it was a diamond ring before I found it it diamond ring when I lost it Hallelujah so you understand what I'm saying you was a Son of God before God lost you you was a Son of God when he found you you a Son of God when he save you it doesn't matter how much mud you had on you Hallelujah it was what you was made from the beginning Hallelujah so what do you saying I don't worry anymore about being saved or even making a Rapture but I do want to please him while I'm here hallelujah you see what I'm saying I even heard a Muslim say this if you are being taught the truth where is the god or where is Jesus Christ in you if you say you are a Christian then you supposed to be doing the things that Jesus did Hallelujah so let me say it like this it Ain the word that's at fault it's not the word that's at fault without faith is impossible to please God and the problem is with most Christians we haven't gone far enough there too much of us that's still living and you and I must die and rock closer we get to God the more he will reveal himself to us more power we'll see coming through us that's the truth hallelujah hallelujah is that right so the veiling of God today is his bride having the same character doing the same Works he did when he was in the flesh called Jesus and you know we'll say amen but you know what I'm not satisfied maybe you're satisfied but I can't be satisfied till I see Jesus Christ fully on display in my life Hallelujah I recognize one thing about me it's too much of me there's got to be less of me let's put this way it must come to a place where there's none of me Hallelujah cuz God doesn't share Hallelujah and you've heard me say this God does not live in a duplex only one person lives in this house Hallelujah is that right if there's someone else living there gu what you have double Minds Hallelujah and the double minded man cannot receive anything from God hallelujah holds let me let me back up she lives in The Invisible world of the supernatural she's like Abraham she calls those things that be not as though they were come on people listen to what's being said see even though god holds our future and nothing will stop his program what do you mean I am just as important to God as RAB was and God went all out of his way to make sure RAB was redeemed Hallelujah y'all hear what I'm saying God went down to Simon's house Hallelujah because he knew a prostitute would come down by the name of Mary it looked like he went to to entertain Simon but he knew the prostitute was coming and he wanted the people of that day those religious people he wanted to make them what valuable to God not your religion but a heart that was willing to be changed hallu she sold all she had we always sing about that alabas baster box you don't know the cost of my Alabaster I like because it took all that I had I had to empty everything out in order to give it to him Hallelujah see we we we must understand god holds our future and nothing will stop his program hallelujah amen nothing will stop God's program Hallelujah no matter who Paul said who should separate me from the love of God hallelujah let the critics come we cannot be normal we're not called to be normal we're called to be peculiar Hallelujah we are different people we must live different we must different it's something we cannot control once the Holy Ghost is in you it lives his life through you Hallelujah let them come let the critics come let them say whatever they want to say our faith is in God hallelujah amen here's the spiritual attitude of the believer I'm going read this quote to you that was sent to me today and I thought I'mma I'mma paste that right into my message Hallelujah coming from the message great Shining Light the prophet of God says in paragraph 141 when you said Mountain be moved it still stands there you say well it didn't happen oh it did happen when you said mountain move maybe one little significant grain of sand turned loose out of the hundreds of billions and billions of tons one little grain moved but it begin to take place see that's what it is we look for some things and we we we look with these natural eyes these natural eyes can't declare the supernatural natural eyes can only see this this this but but the supernatural eye look beyond the natural and call those things that be not as though they were faith and once that mountain disappear certainly hold that faith when we said oh it's getting worse you just messed up Hallelujah you got to go back to the faith Foundation Hallelujah When you pray for something to come to pass it's the devil's job to make you think is getting worse Faith does not go by sight goes by the word whatever the word says that is what it is hallelujah amen the problem is after praying we need to start rejoicing amen hallelujah thou sh say in thy heart disease move from my child disease move from my body in the name of the Lord Jesus y'all hear what I'm saying so you need to start praying for yourself when you sick disease from my body but you got to believe it Hallelujah in the name of the Lord Jesus doubt right there the good germs take on a new armor a new weapon and the enemy begins to back up Hallelujah he is defeated because Christ in the drinking of his M calary defeated the devil and every one of his powers Hallelujah and he stripped him of everything he had and he's nothing but a bluff he can go through he can go through with it he'll do it Hallelujah we are determined by by God's grace to preach the gospel and reflect his light until he comes y'all hear what I'm saying whatever I must go through see the power and manifestation of the Lord that's what I do Hallelujah I hold that Hallelujah y'all remember Paul Raider uh Paul Raider I think it was he was sick a missionary caught a black plague or something he got so sick he was dying things were getting dark on him and he had his wife to pray he said pray honey I can't pray no more but pray for me and she was praying Lord don't let my husband die Lord don't let my husband die and he said as he he began to she he she he began to fade out he kept saying the room is getting darker the room is getting darker and at some point he blacked out and he said he saw himself as a young man on top of a hill where stream was coming down and the boss man said to to brother Raider I need you to cut this tree down and bring it down to the camp Hallelujah brother Raiders cut the tree but he couldn't bring it he said he tall with it he rled with it he did everything within his power Hallelujah to move the tree but he couldn't move the tree he said all of a sudden he heard the voice voice of the boss he said it wasn't his natural boss it was the boss Jesus Christ he said Paul why you wrestling with it don't you see that stream running by there he said just move that tree into the stream and the stream would take it down where to go and what you need to do is get on that law and ride on it Hallelujah y'all hear what I'm saying the truth of the the matter is we can't get there sometime sometimes we struggle when we don't have to struggle but we need to get on the word and ride on it every time the devil say it won't happen you need to say it's going to happen it has happened I'm riding on it I'm rid on it I'm riding on it Hallelujah and what happened Hallelujah he woke up out of his sleep he jump into the middle of the Flor C up by the anointing screaming I'm riding on it I'm riding on it I'm riding on it that's what it is about this Rapture Hallelujah I'm riding on the Promises of God hallelujah I might not have the strength myself but I'm riding on the word of God hallelujah yes I am Hallelujah this body is changed this soul is changed you say is yes you can't see it right now but it's already in the making it's already in the process and I'm riding on it because God has changed me and one of these old days the change will be complete I'm going to change from this model into immortality Hallelujah y'all hear what I'm saying I am the new fashion god so are you you are the new fashion of God the body of Jesus Christ amen Romans 12 you love the Lord amen he says be not conformed to this world be transformed by the renewing of your mind and you can't get there without the word word that transforms your mind washes your mind word that causes you to stop thinking way the old man used to think Hallelujah be not conformed to this world y' hear saying right now we're in a Time time that the world is conforming soall Christians into the worldly image of of of the world Hallelujah but he said be transformed by the renewing of your mind let God renew your mind let it take you back to where you used to be I say that before Before Time Hallelujah you were in him Before Time began Hallelujah remember when he spoke you were there Hallelujah glory to God when God created everything you were there remember you cannot be lost Hallelujah why can't you be lost because before the foundation of the world God put your name in The Lamb Book of Life it cannot be erased it is permanently there renew your mind you and I we're just strangers and pilgrims we're traveling through this world Hallelujah but this world is not my home this world is not your home we're just passing through hallelujah hallelujah amen renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God what is the perfect will of God to let the word renew your mind Hallelujah stop thinking evil stop doing evil love your brother love your enemy have the nature of Heaven somebody help me here have the mind of God hallelujah Titus 3:5 glory to God thank you Father not by the works of righteousness which we have done but according to his Mercy he saved us by the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Ghost your you hear what he said renewing of the Holy Ghost that means somewhere you must have had it when did you have it before the foundation of we were with him in him was in us we were in him Hallelujah renewing of your mind of the Hool ghost the Holy Ghost must be the mind of God the Holy Ghost must be the mind of God so let the Holy Ghost be in you let it live in you that was Christ Jesus right is that right the Holy Ghost is Christ Jesus the Holy Ghost comes in the name of Jesus Christ Hallelujah the Holy Ghost is the mind of Christ he could have done it without it y'all hear what I'm saying that's why when he was on the Jordan and that Holy Ghost come down and he said this is my beloved Son wh in whom I'm well to to please or to dwell in in whom right he was in him wait a minute now he comes down but then the Bible said he was in him see what I'm saying he was already in him he came down and the voice said this is my beloved Son in I'm well to to pleased to dwell in he was dwelling in him so how many gods there is then hallelujah I fear that we haven't gone deep enough and when I say that I'm I'm not talking about studying up the scripture I'm talking about deep in prayer Hallelujah because Prayer Changes Things hallelujah amen look what he said says an uncertain sound paragraph 362 and when you go when you got supreme power when Jesus says lay hands on the sick they shall recover and you got supreme faith in that being the truth need a supreme god that made a supreme promise and a and a supreme result will come y'all hear what I'm saying if your faith is supreme and you know that the word that you're standing on is true you can lay hands on the sick and they will recover cuz you're Supreme faith if if it's being the truth the Supreme God will produce the promise Hallelujah that's right Hallelujah is that all right right Hallelujah coming from the message who is this mzc paragraphs 41 hope this is all right with you the Bible says there is one God not three I keep saying one because I want you to understand you're part of that one we do it all the time we have we have communion not not different loaves of bread the communion is made out of one piece of bread broken into pie like a puzzle Hallelujah but those pieces did not have the origin or it's only origination it bread that was the the origin of the pieces y'all hear what I'm saying and that's why the Bible say we're one body we many but we're one one God but many you know Paul didn't get a different holy ghost in Peter didn't get a a different piece of the Holy Ghost they all received the same Holy Ghost the same kind of experience they all changed Hallelujah into the image and likeness of God so much so they were called Christians the same Holy Ghost is today because the Bible he's the same yesterday today and forever but we must believe you got to have faith you got to believe what you're say hallelujah that's right the Bible said there is one God not three but that's how that they could couldn't you you you can't you can't get this this straightened out and have God you would never sell a je that I tell you that one who know better he knows there's only one God hallelujah let me tell y'all something even the Muslim know they're one God hallelujah you know how they came to know by way of Daniel's teachings search the history those those those uh what you call the Stars studies of the Stars astrologers they were under the influence of Daniel because Daniel was the wisest man in Babylon Hallelujah because of Daniel that they understood the Stars one thing about the Muslim they know that God dwells in fire Hallelujah and we know that God is a spirit and he is a consuming fire Hallelujah so when they saw the star they knew because of the what D you see what I'm saying Daniel left a reputation in Babylon King Nebuchadnezzar say Daniel God they may not know the name of God but they call him Allah y'all better hear what I'm saying that same God hallelujah changed his fashion Hallelujah he changed his mask and became Christ Jesus our you don't believe it John 10:30 he said I am the father of one Hallelujah now you can believe that or not but that's what he said Hallelujah notice like a sculpture he hides a mask over it that's what God has done to this age been he all these things have been hid and is supposed to be revealed in this age now the Bible said they will be revealed in this latter time like a sculpure keeping his his piece of work covered over until the time he takes the mask off of it there it is is that right that's why the prophet of God had the preach the unveiling of God we had he took the veil off to show us who was there working in this day it wasn't just a prophet he himself wasn't mzc but the God that was in mzc was in him y'all better hear what I'm saying hallelujah and the promises that that that was left to Abraham has now been left to his seed without fa is impossible to please him hallelujah hallelujah you can't just oh I hope I'm Bri fa is when I know I am hallelu that's what the Bible has been it has been a work of God that's been coming up it's been hid since the foundation of the world and Sevenfold mystery God promised this day at the age of this lean church he would take the mask off the whole thing and we could see it what a glorious thing Hallelujah see the devil thought that he had defeated God In The Garden of of Eden he thought he had stopped the reproduction of God Byam but he didn't know that in the mind of God God had a second Adam coming Hallelujah that was not Earthly but he came from Glory Hallelujah and that second Adam the Bible said was a quickening spirit Hallelujah and what did he come to do he came to produce children Hallelujah y'all better understand me I'll say it like this this oncoming world has to be baptized has to be Sanctified the fire of God must purify it y'all better hear what I'm saying because that's how he does the believer you can't just be justified you can't be just Sanctified but the fire of God must come down and burn all of the wickedness out of you Hallelujah this oncoming world is only for God's children God is going to transport them what do you mean transport just like he did John John was translated into the new time into this day and John saw this day Hallelujah and one of these old days we're going to be changeed and we'll be oh God help me Jesus what people don't understand the Bible said God has a hiding place in the name of the Lord there is a hiding place let the bombs fall let the diseases come let the fire come in God I have a hiding place you got a hiding place Hallelujah that's what the Bible says the name of the Lord is a strong tower and the righteous run in and they are saved Hallelujah according to Songs of Solomon there's a secret place there's a secret place where God is going to hide us from the Wrath that is to come y'all better hear me Hallelujah God has a hiding place hallelujah hallelujah you see Noah had a hiding place AR Hallelujah and one time the The Hiding Place was the blood but now the hiding place is a dimension y better hear me Paul literally visited there he said to tell you the truth I don't know whether I was in the body or out of the body but the land is over there Hallelujah he said I saw things that I cannot explain Hallelujah but he was wasn't the only one William Bram comes along he's sleeping on his bed or just laying on his bed all of a sudden he was pulled up to the next Dimension he said he saw millions of people running to him my precious brother Hallelujah I don't know about you but I was there Hallelujah I in the number because when this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved I'm going to put on a new fashion y ready I'm going to change this whole body I'm going to step into my my my immortality I'm step into my theophany it ain't all over yet because once God cleans the world once he purify the world once he get the devil and all of his angels guess what we're coming back hallelujah we're coming back amen hallelujah they're trying to they're concerned about all these worlds you know there's got to be life somewhere what you don't understand that a couple of those PL is probably mine is that right that's what he said he said if you be faithful over these little he said I would give you 10 CI can you imagine the millions of people that have been faithful that's going to have 10 cities now I don't know how big the city is going to be but I know the city of Jerusalem is a big city y'all already hear what I'm saying I don't know it all maybe I'm just speculating but I know John saw a number no man could number Hallelujah and what people all of y'all came on the earth it all depends on how you're looking you're looking from a dimensional standpoint what you're looking at it seemed like heaven would be overflowing all of the billions of people and trillions of people that have died Heaven Hallelujah but it's not it ain't overflowing yet there's still room for me Hallelujah y'all hear what I'm saying there's a space for you and me hallelujah amen oh let me I I tell you what I'm enjoying myself this is a reality to me to come you know how long in my life you wonder who you are what you are what's going to happen to you everybody is going to die you know I heard the prophet say something that I had never heard before he said death used to be imminent he say it's no longer imminent since Calvary it it ain't going to always happen and in this day we going to take a Rapture so some of us won't die but before Calvary all of us would die but now in this day we have a promise that we're going to escape death we're going to cheat him Hallelujah glory to God hallelujah and that's what the Bible has been it has been a work of God that's been covered up and it's been here since the foundation of the world and S mystery God promised in this day at the age of the church age he would take the mask off of it the thing and we could see it what a glorious thing God and imor mask in the pill of fire God immor In A Man Called Jesus God his church God above us God With Us God in us the condescending of God up there holy no one could touch him he settled upon the mountain animals couldn't touch the mountain had to die and then God came down and changed his tent come down and live with us become one of us and we beheld him the Bible said first Timothy 3:16 without controversy greatest the mystery of godliness but God was manifested in the flesh handled with with hands God eat meat God drink water God slept God cried Hallelujah he was one of us beautiful in the Bible that was God above us God With Us now God in us the Holy Spirit not the third person the same person Hallelujah God came down and become flesh and died the death in Christ but he so he could come cleanse the church the church cleans the church in order to get into it Fellowship God loves Fellowship that's what he made the man at the first time for was for Fellowship God dwelt Alone with cherubim Hallelujah hallu I'm going to skip let's go to Romans 134 here hallelujah hallelujah glory to God Amen I heard somebody say everything y'all believe is wrong everything I believe wrong that's all I'm saying this message has made me the happiest man I ever been Hallelujah and when I get down and when the devil tells me I ain't no good put on the table open my bible however to me I can get on my knees and God speaks to me see that's why I know he ain't done yet still talking to me Hallelujah Romans 13:14 but put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ huh put him on put him on what are you talking about I'm talking about put his Fashion on mask let him put the mask on you however you want to put it but the Bible said those words are not put when you take a jacket off you putting on the Lord Jesus Christ make not provision for the flesh to fulfill the thereof Hallelujah Galatians 3 and I'm almost done hallelujah put him on Amen that's why people don't understand how important the anointing is that Destro to walk in that anointing hallelu not when we come to church every day all day the devil does whatever he can keep out of that anointing that's true you going to love everybody you're not going to struggle with people when you're in that anointing but when you're out of that anointing you into yourself and that's where the problems come Galatians 3 26- 27 are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus for as many of you as been baptized into Christ have put on Christ the baptism of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah don't to with it just take Jesus at his word hallelujah don't rle with it okay I'm I'm I'm done almost but let me read this last one Hallelujah you love God uncertain sound paragraph 415 God cannot change he's infinite prescriptions work every time give in the right way yes sir now heent be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your shall receive the Holy Ghost let me interject this in if you don't have the Holy Ghost yet fully repent will the Holy Ghost yes repentance come first you can be

God Came Upon you change your ways speak Tong lay hands on the sick Devils the same as they did how many how long end of the disciples you are a false prophet if you say that you a false teacher if you say that but Jesus Christ the Bible teaches us that he's the same yesterday today and forever and the apostles said here that the promise is unto you and to your children and them say it with me say it with me even as many as the Lord Our God shall call every every color every every whatever it is as many as God calls God calls you he commands you to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
