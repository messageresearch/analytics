[35:15] well praise the lord we're just going to
[35:17] try to pick up
[35:18] where he left off this morning
[35:22] and the day before the last service
[35:26] um if you would turn with me to jude

[36:13] to the only wise god our savior
[36:16] be glory and majesty dominion
[36:20] and power both now and ever
[36:23] [Music]
[36:24] amen hebrews please fourth chapter
[36:29] we start at the first verse let us
[36:32] therefore fear there's a promise being
[36:36] left
[36:36] us of entering into his rest
[36:40] any of you should seem to come short of
[36:42] it
[36:43] for unto us was the gospel preached as
[36:45] well as unto
[36:46] them but the word preached did not
[36:49] profit them
[36:50] not being mixed with faith in them that
[36:52] heard it
[36:54] remember that for we which have believed
[36:57] do
[36:58] enter into rest as he said i have sworn
[37:02] in my wrath
[37:03] if they shall enter into my rest
[37:06] although the works were finished
[37:08] from the foundation of the world for he
[37:10] spake in a certain place of the seventh
[37:12] day on this wise and god did rest the
[37:16] seventh day
[37:17] from all of his works let us pray father
[37:20] we thank you for your grace
[37:22] we thank you for your mercy and all that
[37:24] you have done for us
[37:26] and everything that you are doing we
[37:28] pray father that you're blessed of
[37:30] service in a special way
[37:32] we thank you lord for all that you are
[37:35] and father we love you because of your
[37:37] character in jesus christ's name we pray
[37:40] amen
[37:40] you may be seated
[37:46] uh just thinking about the to the
[37:49] service tonight
[37:51] and what god is requiring of us
[37:54] we talked and we spoke a little bit
[37:56] about the
[37:58] seven seals and the seven thunders and
[38:01] where we are
[38:02] in this time or in this dispensational
[38:06] time
[38:07] we know that we're at the end time amen
[38:10] because
[38:11] malachi 4 has come and gone
[38:15] and we also know that we are living in
[38:19] borrowed time if you want to say the
[38:22] long-suffering of god
[38:25] because in reality the rapture should
[38:27] have taken place already
[38:29] god is not we're not waiting on god god
[38:32] is waiting on
[38:32] us and you and i must understand that
[38:36] god
[38:36] the only way that you can please god is
[38:38] you must have faith
[38:40] faith is not something that you could
[38:42] work up it's not a psychological thing
[38:44] or
[38:44] intellectual thing it is something in
[38:46] which god gives you
[38:48] it is a finding it is finding favor
[38:51] with god many people we look and we read
[38:54] the scriptures and we hear
[38:55] where the bible tells us that abraham
[38:57] faith and he believed god
[38:59] but you must understand that god gave
[39:01] abraham that faith
[39:03] no man can believe god is that right it
[39:06] all of these things
[39:08] are directed by one thing inspiration
[39:12] and god gives that inspiration to the
[39:14] individual
[39:15] in which he's he he's chosen to give it
[39:18] to
[39:19] and i like to entitle this message this
[39:22] is the inspiration of the hour
[39:25] now we realize by god's grace and we
[39:28] talked about this in previous messages
[39:30] when brother adam talked about the
[39:31] junior jackson's dream about the
[39:33] white pyramid and the rock and said that
[39:36] that rock in itself could not be
[39:38] interpreted there was no written word
[39:41] amen and brother branham even asked that
[39:43] question in
[39:45] in service is the time because amen he
[39:48] was wondering you know
[39:49] what god was going to do he felt an
[39:52] inspiration
[39:53] he didn't fully understand the
[39:55] inspiration
[39:56] but he knew it had to do something with
[39:58] god understand
[39:59] a prophet a prophet is a straight
[40:01] shooter and brother branham was a
[40:03] straight shooter
[40:04] he was not one that would be willing
[40:06] amen as i said before
[40:08] to shoot a an animal a man in the side
[40:11] of the head or the ear or the chest
[40:14] he had to shoot that little squirrel
[40:15] right in between the eye
[40:17] and he even consulted the lord why am i
[40:19] like this when all the other brothers
[40:21] when they shoot they just so glad to get
[40:23] a kill
[40:24] but he was designed he was actually
[40:27] placed in a position
[40:28] where he had to keep it straight amen
[40:31] because he had a word he had a
[40:32] commission
[40:33] from god that required him to be
[40:36] that way and we so we so we realized by
[40:40] god's grace we're in
[40:41] he was he was actually being tormented
[40:44] if you want to say it because
[40:45] he didn't know remember and god allowed
[40:47] it to happen
[40:49] he actually thought it was his death he
[40:51] did not know
[40:53] like some people think he knew
[40:54] everything he did not know
[40:56] he didn't understand what was happening
[40:59] but then there's a question amen that he
[41:01] asked
[41:01] amen ensures the time and he he asked
[41:05] lord
[41:06] is these the angels of the lord
[41:11] that's coming to pick me up so he began
[41:14] to wonder and wonder and wonder until
[41:16] one day
[41:17] he was out there in the desert picking
[41:18] up a cocker barrel off of his pant leg
[41:21] and boom there it was
[41:22] one blast and seven angels came and
[41:25] caught him up
[41:26] amen into that pyramid cloud
[41:29] at one place he called it a circular
[41:31] cloud but we understand exactly what he
[41:34] meant
[41:35] i showed you by god's grace that that
[41:37] same cap pyramid cloud was actually the
[41:40] capstone of the pyramid
[41:41] or the capstan stone of the church ages
[41:43] however you want to put it
[41:45] but we understand my god that there has
[41:47] has to be
[41:48] an inspiration and if you don't have an
[41:52] inspiration now
[41:53] something's going wrong somewhere all
[41:56] true believers those who are chosen to
[41:58] be bride those who are called
[42:00] to be bride should be
[42:03] moving in a direction in which they
[42:06] themselves have no control over it
[42:09] it's almost like the animals who were
[42:10] led into the ark
[42:12] when the inspiration struck them they
[42:14] didn't know where they were going
[42:16] they didn't even understand but they
[42:17] knew they had to get somewhere at a
[42:19] certain time
[42:20] and be in that certain place when god
[42:22] moved
[42:23] and that's how it is with the bride of
[42:25] jesus christ she's under
[42:26] an inspiration and that inspiration amen
[42:30] is moving her amen and you know
[42:33] we're not at a place where we can afford
[42:35] to resist anymore
[42:37] that inspiration is pulling her and
[42:39] drawing her
[42:40] amen into that position that god has uh
[42:43] intended for her to be the thing i love
[42:46] about this message
[42:48] is that the message take away the guilt
[42:50] consciousness
[42:51] when the holy ghost comes it take away
[42:53] the guilt of consciousness
[42:55] as i said this morning many people would
[42:57] move forward
[42:58] faster if they stop condemning
[43:01] themselves
[43:02] amen why are you condemning yourself
[43:05] when god doesn't condemn you
[43:07] if god has totally justified you why
[43:10] would you not accept it see
[43:12] that's what i'm saying it must come by
[43:14] faith
[43:15] hallelujah amen you must understand
[43:19] in order to make a rapture it ain't a
[43:22] hope
[43:22] so it must become a no soul it must
[43:26] be a word the word of god that has been
[43:28] delivered to you
[43:29] if god said i'm justified i'm justified
[43:32] if he says i'm sanctified i'm sanctified
[43:34] if he says i'm here he is i'm here
[43:38] hallelujah because you must understand
[43:40] this flesh
[43:41] amen god god has already condemned it
[43:44] there's no way you can perfect this
[43:46] flesh
[43:48] when you try to perfect the flesh you
[43:50] have now adopted a
[43:51] system hallelujah and no
[43:54] system can perfect you neither can a
[43:57] system give you divine love
[43:59] you can work yourself to death
[44:01] hallelujah
[44:02] and god is the only one that can give it
[44:04] to you but the system in itself
[44:07] is there to control you and the bible
[44:09] said
[44:10] where the spirit of the lord is there's
[44:12] liberty
[44:13] and he whom the son set free is free
[44:15] indeed
[44:16] hallelujah you say oh but let me say it
[44:19] like this
[44:19] there's a time we needed a system
[44:22] hallelujah
[44:23] amen like a seed when it's planted into
[44:25] the ground and it begins to grow
[44:27] it grows in a systematic way
[44:31] hallelujah it has boundaries somebody
[44:34] help me here
[44:35] it has boundaries but those church ages
[44:38] was like a system
[44:40] and what did they do they they put laws
[44:43] and rules and regulations
[44:45] in place so that people can appear to be
[44:49] hallelujah but god ain't looking for the
[44:52] appearing to be
[44:54] he's looking for the reality of the seed
[44:57] hallelujah
[44:58] you had the lutherans you had the wesley
[44:59] we you know they all had something good
[45:02] about them but they did not look like
[45:04] the original seed
[45:05] hallelujah but you got to understand
[45:08] when god begins to move
[45:10] god is in this hour god is looking for
[45:13] the original seed
[45:15] hallelujah he said oh brother books what
[45:17] are you saying you know when cain killed
[45:19] abel
[45:20] amen the devil thought that he had uh
[45:23] the
[45:23] the world in a fix because k able was
[45:26] the only righteous seed
[45:28] and he killed the righteous seed
[45:30] hallelujah
[45:31] but then god appointed another seed
[45:34] and called his name seth and the bible
[45:37] said after god pointed south
[45:39] amen then the people began to call upon
[45:43] the name of the lord hallelujah
[45:45] and it doesn't tell us how long it was
[45:47] between
[45:48] abel and seth but we do know one thing
[45:51] there's a silence there
[45:52] there's no worship there hallelujah
[45:56] hey and abel represented the church and
[45:58] there was no worship
[46:00] it was when true worship came in when
[46:02] seth
[46:03] was appointed hallelujah to make a long
[46:06] story short
[46:07] true worship of jesus christ could not
[46:10] come back into focus
[46:12] until god appointed a seed and we call
[46:14] his name william branham
[46:16] and when god amen appointed him then he
[46:19] taught us
[46:20] what it meant to praise god how to
[46:22] worship god
[46:23] how to do those things that god would
[46:25] have us to do y'all understand me
[46:27] so let's move on what was it it's
[46:30] inspiration
[46:31] we're living in a time amen that you and
[46:33] i must understand the bible said holy
[46:35] men
[46:35] moved by the by the spirit of god see
[46:39] the spirit of god gotta move you
[46:41] amen you know how it is a lot of us we
[46:43] we love to witness but we can't witness
[46:46] until god moves
[46:47] upon us is that right amen this is the
[46:50] hour
[46:51] every man and woman of god i often think
[46:54] to myself
[46:55] i said what about tamar tamar looked
[46:58] like she was rejected
[46:59] and then she looked like she was
[47:01] finished but something
[47:03] moved upon it there was an inspiration
[47:06] that struck tamar it would have looked
[47:08] crazy and insane
[47:09] to everybody else but when it came to
[47:12] her
[47:13] it made all the sense in the world
[47:16] hallelujah and she moved and because she
[47:19] moved and and guess what she disguised
[47:22] herself as a prostitute
[47:24] hallelujah she knew the weakness of
[47:26] judah and she knew
[47:27] judah was coming her way listen because
[47:30] jude and tamar got together it didn't
[47:33] mean that she was going to get pregnant
[47:35] but god set it up hallelujah god set it
[47:39] up he works on both
[47:40] ears hallelujah
[47:43] and so we see by god's grace it is so
[47:46] important
[47:47] when the holy spirit tell you to do
[47:48] something do it
[47:50] but if you don't have a life if you
[47:51] don't have nothing you can't feel god or
[47:53] you can't hear god or you can't
[47:55] everybody even animals can hear god
[47:58] hallelujah oh come on somebody
[48:02] you know oftentimes we don't do because
[48:03] we don't want to do
[48:06] hallelujah but listen let's move on by
[48:08] the grace of god
[48:09] noah it was hard for the people to
[48:11] understand noah
[48:13] hallelujah in his day he heard god speak
[48:16] he knew it was the word because he was
[48:18] god's prophet
[48:20] god sent him forth to claim a great
[48:23] flood coming
[48:24] he built a way uh on the ark and in time
[48:27] of
[48:28] criticism make no difference to noah how
[48:31] many criticized
[48:32] he was the light of that day he was the
[48:34] word of god manifested for that day
[48:37] hallelujah and god destroyed the people
[48:40] you say well what do you mean
[48:42] listen the truth of the matter is you
[48:44] are the manifestation
[48:46] of the word today you are it
[48:49] is william brown who has done his thing
[48:51] you the word
[48:54] hallelujah help us jesus you and i
[48:56] supposed to be what
[48:58] the light of the world under the
[49:01] inspiration
[49:02] of the seven seals and the seven
[49:04] thunders
[49:05] you know why i'm saying it like that
[49:07] because under that inspiration
[49:10] we receive full authority
[49:13] and power everything we lost
[49:16] amen by the fall of adam has been
[49:19] restored
[49:20] but if you can't believe it it's only
[49:22] because that inspiration hasn't struck
[49:24] you yet
[49:25] hallelujah but when the inspiration
[49:28] strikes you
[49:29] it puts you in a place i'm not afraid of
[49:31] death i'm not afraid of corona
[49:33] i'm not afraid of nothing hallelujah why
[49:36] because the bible said no weapon formed
[49:39] against me shall
[49:40] prosper hallelujah you and i must
[49:43] understand you got to wake up
[49:45] you got to come to a place to realize
[49:47] amen you are bride
[49:49] hallelujah you're not some mistake
[49:52] hallelujah but you are the word of god
[49:55] predestinated for this hour to
[49:58] manifest jesus christ and him only
[50:02] hallelujah it is what it is hallelujah
[50:06] amen and even though it looked crazy
[50:08] you're gonna look crazy
[50:10] oh like i was saying this morning you
[50:12] can develop a systematic worship
[50:15] you can develop a way of doing it just
[50:17] right but that doesn't give you the holy
[50:19] ghost
[50:20] neither does it give you salvation
[50:23] there's a lot of people
[50:24] who can dress holier than us there's a
[50:26] lot of people who are far more faithful
[50:28] to church than we are
[50:30] hallelujah it's like jacob and esau come
[50:32] on somebody
[50:33] amen jacob amen esau looked better
[50:37] more like a christian than jacob jacob
[50:39] was a shy star
[50:40] hallelujah he was the one a man that
[50:43] looked like a devil
[50:45] but it wasn't about that god don't care
[50:47] about what you appear to be to somebody
[50:49] else
[50:49] he knows his seed the bible said he
[50:52] knows them
[50:53] that our ears and no matter what
[50:56] satan has clouded your your life with or
[50:58] covered you up
[50:59] amen it doesn't matter hallelujah when
[51:02] god begins to move hallelujah is that
[51:05] right
[51:05] no matter how bad of a person jacob was
[51:08] when god began to move
[51:09] when that inspiration got on jacob says
[51:11] i got to go back home
[51:12] hallelujah see that's what i'm saying
[51:15] you got to go back home
[51:17] you got to get your in your proper place
[51:19] and god is going to keep driving you
[51:22] because you know what as human beings
[51:24] we're lazy
[51:25] we don't like to study we don't like to
[51:27] read we don't like to do
[51:29] nothing but judge hallelujah come out
[51:33] it's the truth but god ain't all about
[51:35] that
[51:36] god is looking at a people amen that's
[51:38] ready for a rapture
[51:39] i don't know about you but i feel the
[51:41] inspiration i
[51:43] see what god is doing hallelujah and you
[51:45] know what
[51:46] i do not have to worry
[51:49] i've read you the scripture he's able
[51:52] not you he's able to present us
[51:55] faultless it ain't in your hands
[51:59] it's his it's in his hands hallelujah oh
[52:02] come on somebody
[52:04] find me somebody in the bible from
[52:07] genesis to revelation
[52:09] who was worthy hallelujah
[52:12] none was worthy that's what the book was
[52:15] all about
[52:16] that's why when the lamb took the book
[52:18] the bible said there was nobody worthy
[52:21] only one who was worthy hallelujah that
[52:24] means everybody outside of jesus christ
[52:26] who makes the rapture makes the rapture
[52:29] by grace and grace alone
[52:34] hallelujah it ain't about your
[52:36] systematic worship
[52:38] hallelujah it ain't about how you
[52:40] looking how you perform
[52:42] hallelujah is what god has determined
[52:44] you to be
[52:45] from the foundation of the world and the
[52:48] devil don't like it
[52:50] but there's another thing he can do
[52:51] about it the word is fixed
[52:54] and it can't be changed people say well
[52:56] oh praise god i can live any kind of way
[52:58] i want to
[52:59] well that just show you you ain't got
[53:00] nothing hallelujah
[53:02] because if it's truly a seed of god yo
[53:05] let me explain perfection
[53:07] see a lot of times we think perfection
[53:09] and i thought it this way for a long
[53:10] time
[53:11] we think perfection is i got my shoes on
[53:14] right
[53:15] i got my right colored shirt because see
[53:17] sometimes some people don't like you
[53:18] wearing colored shirts because they
[53:20] think that's wrong
[53:21] yeah it's true i know preachers right
[53:23] now who will not allow you to preach in
[53:25] their pulpit because
[53:26] of a colored shirt nonsense
[53:30] god wouldn't even care if i didn't have
[53:32] one on if i didn't have one to put on
[53:36] that is foolishness
[53:40] oh you say well what brooks are you
[53:42] insane what about the africans that he
[53:44] preached to
[53:45] didn't have no clothes on and they ran
[53:49] to get on blankets
[53:51] god gave them the holy ghost before they
[53:53] got clothed
[54:09] who knew of noah only god knew him
[54:14] and god called him but the perfection
[54:16] and work which i'm working with
[54:18] is not my touch not taste not handle not
[54:21] that's not perfection
[54:22] that's law hallelujah you know what
[54:26] perfection
[54:26] is if your earnest desire to do the
[54:30] perfect will of god
[54:32] every day that's perfection
[54:35] you're gonna make mistakes oh the bible
[54:38] said abraham was a perfect and upright
[54:40] mind was he not
[54:41] was not jose jobe perfect and upright
[54:43] did they make mistake
[54:44] yes in other words job would not have
[54:47] never had to
[54:48] even offer for sacrifice if he was that
[54:50] kind of perfection
[54:52] hallelujah is that right enoch
[54:55] enoch why is it not written that enoch
[54:58] did this and enoch did that and then i
[55:00] did this
[55:01] you know what it says he not walk with
[55:03] god
[55:04] hallelujah in other words as god talked
[55:07] to him and instructed him
[55:09] he followed the rules his perfection
[55:12] didn't come by just that
[55:14] his profession came by the blood of
[55:16] jesus christ
[55:20] without the shedding of blood there is
[55:21] no remission of sin hallelujah
[55:24] your perfection don't come by how
[55:26] wearing a tuxedo or wearing something
[55:28] it's all right if you got it i got a few
[55:31] tuxedos at home and i desire to wear it
[55:32] the church sometime but i thought
[55:34] no i don't want nobody to think i'm
[55:36] trying to be nothing
[55:38] sometimes i just put them on and see
[55:39] whether i can still fit them
[55:42] hallelujah you hear what i'm saying
[55:44] because i know if i wear my tuxedos
[55:46] people going to think what is he doing
[55:49] i'm wearing my tuxedos
[55:52] but let me move on by god's grace i'm
[55:55] working with the inspiration
[55:57] what's going to happen when the churches
[55:59] are closed you're shut down
[56:02] you got no clothes you got no food
[56:05] you know whatever they're going to do
[56:07] they're going to run us out of this
[56:08] place
[56:09] hallelujah you know why they're going to
[56:11] run us out i'm going to tell you
[56:14] remember i told you last week about the
[56:16] exodus
[56:17] the third exodus and i made a point
[56:21] i said when when joseph died there in
[56:24] egypt
[56:25] the jews should have gone back to the
[56:28] homeland
[56:29] but they did not why they were in goshen
[56:33] like the bride of jesus christ we're
[56:35] safe
[56:36] hallelujah we're enjoying the clothing
[56:39] and enjoying the food
[56:41] and enjoy we're just at a relaxed state
[56:44] and god says
[56:45] i can't bless you till you come back to
[56:47] your home
[56:48] hallelujah and god put the pressure
[56:53] on israel just to do what drive them
[56:56] back home was that was that the last
[56:59] time
[56:59] no sir even after they got into these
[57:03] great countries
[57:04] when they got busted up from titus and
[57:06] all the rest of them
[57:08] hallelujah you know what they did they
[57:10] got in germany they got in france they
[57:12] got in
[57:12] all these great countries and they began
[57:14] everywhere that you would go
[57:16] they prospered naturally
[57:20] but god said i can't move until you go
[57:22] back to your homeland
[57:24] hallelujah so he released stalin in all
[57:27] a mussolini and hitler and what did they
[57:29] do by the tender hand of jehovah
[57:32] they drove them back home just like
[57:35] pharaoh did with israel hallelujah
[57:38] and your day and my day is coming it's a
[57:41] shame
[57:42] that the bride of jesus christ with all
[57:44] of this word
[57:45] god got to put pressure on us calling
[57:48] the squeeze
[57:48] to get us back to the bible
[57:53] oh it's coming we too relaxed
[57:57] we're enjoying everything too much and
[57:59] you think this corona would have us
[58:01] praying more
[58:02] i'm saying oh my god message people
[58:05] don't eat fast
[58:08] don't get quiet people don't know what
[58:10] faster here
[58:12] more or less praying huh but oh don't
[58:15] you worry about it
[58:16] because fasting and praying is in the
[58:19] equation
[58:20] and whether you do it on your own or not
[58:22] god is going to make it happen
[58:25] hallelujah come on inspiration you got
[58:28] to be under the inspiration

[1:04:46] don't you understand what satan has done
[1:04:48] he's locked out all of the world why
[1:04:51] why why why he's done it because he's
[1:04:54] getting ready to change the whole order
[1:04:59] it looks wicked it looks wicked they're
[1:05:01] tearing down statues and all kind of
[1:05:03] crazy stuff
[1:05:04] it is wicked but satan has something up
[1:05:07] his sleeve
[1:05:08] people he's changing the whole facial of
[1:05:11] america
[1:05:15] it's the truth and you and i must wake
[1:05:19] up to the
[1:05:20] smell of coffee because this same
[1:05:22] machinery
[1:05:23] is going to come your way it's going to
[1:05:24] make a turn right
[1:05:26] it's going to make a turn because as
[1:05:28] soon as this thing the more scientific
[1:05:30] it become
[1:05:32] the more the bride of jesus christ
[1:05:34] resists it
[1:05:35] because our god is not science our god
[1:05:38] is god

[1:05:42] has always been the battle
[1:05:44] lucifer and and jesus micah however you
[1:05:47] want to say it
[1:05:49] but that's the whole battle faith versus
[1:05:51] science
[1:05:52] hallelujah is that right that's what he
[1:05:54] gave eve in the beginning he gave her
[1:05:55] science
[1:05:56] and his science work
[1:05:59] his signs work children were supposed to
[1:06:01] come by
[1:06:02] by the spoken word we're supposed to be
[1:06:05] no babies
[1:06:06] like there's not going to be no babies
[1:06:08] in heaven babies
[1:06:10] in the new world it won't be can you
[1:06:12] imagine nursing a baby for
[1:06:16] eternity
[1:06:21] come on it makes no sense god
[1:06:24] will turn the people back to what he
[1:06:26] intended them to be

[1:07:31] reason why i'm asking you

[1:09:54] that's just that's it you ain't gonna
[1:09:57] challenge no bad lion and you ain't
[1:09:59] gonna
[1:10:00] oh praise god yes no no no
[1:10:03] no no no think about the early church
[1:10:05] when the inspiration struck them
[1:10:08] huh they weren't afraid of rome
[1:10:12] they weren't well they weren't afraid of
[1:10:15] the arena
[1:10:16] you're going to die we're going to feed
[1:10:18] you to the lions and the inspiration
[1:10:20] struck them
[1:10:21] and they ran to the lions that's not
[1:10:24] human
[1:10:25] that's supernatural and our god is
[1:10:28] supernatural that's the inspiration
[1:10:30] we're under
[1:10:32] hallelujah is that right it was taken
[1:10:35] out of the hands of
[1:10:36] man brother branham even there even in
[1:10:38] his his
[1:10:39] showing the vision and he says listen he
[1:10:41] said i've taken you this far
[1:10:43] i can't take you no further but you see
[1:10:46] those blooded footprints
[1:10:48] follow them what was the bloody
[1:10:49] footprint that was calvary
[1:10:51] that was jesus that was joshua i can't
[1:10:54] take you no further
[1:10:55] as a man i've taken you as far as i can
[1:10:57] take you
[1:10:58] see the bloody footprints y'all
[1:11:01] understand me
[1:11:02] that's what what i'm working with amen
[1:11:05] brother branham has taken us as far as
[1:11:07] he can take us
[1:11:08] hallelujah he couldn't lift himself up
[1:11:11] it took those seven thunders
[1:11:13] to lift him up to where he's supposed to
[1:11:15] be
[1:11:17] that's all i'm telling you something
[1:11:19] happened there
[1:11:21] one blast seven angels
[1:11:26] was the manifestation of that white rock
[1:11:32] he said the angels i i got quotes if you
[1:11:34] need them
[1:11:35] he said the angels of the lord not angel
[1:11:38] angels of the lord came and picked me up
[1:11:42] people said oh there were seven men they
[1:11:44] could not have been brother ben said i
[1:11:46] first saw them as
[1:11:47] seven small birds then i saw them as
[1:11:49] seven pigeons
[1:11:50] then the next thing they came they came
[1:11:52] as seven angels
[1:11:54] hallelujah y'all am i right he said even
[1:11:57] the seven angels
[1:11:58] formed the wig over my head now they
[1:12:01] couldn't have been men
[1:12:03] could not have been oh people said well
[1:12:04] it was the theophanies
[1:12:06] of of uh uh of the seven angels of the
[1:12:09] seven church ages no it wasn't each one
[1:12:12] of those angels had a supernatural being
[1:12:15] revealing the word to them hallelujah
[1:12:18] you said well what do you mean brother
[1:12:19] because the seven angels were the seven
[1:12:20] thunders
[1:12:21] and guess what it was a hidden mystery
[1:12:24] that only they knew
[1:12:25] because god had told them hallelujah the
[1:12:28] brotherhood said did you see that other
[1:12:30] one
[1:12:30] that notable one that notable and he
[1:12:33] said that was the
[1:12:34] seventh angel so that you understand
[1:12:36] what he's trying to tell you
[1:12:38] that particular one represented jesus
[1:12:40] christ only
[1:12:41] because when it comes to the number
[1:12:43] seven every time you read seven
[1:12:44] seven seven seven always represents god
[1:12:48] hallelujah three is perfection and seven
[1:12:50] is completion
[1:12:52] i know i'm spitting grapes right now but
[1:12:54] it doesn't matter
[1:12:56] you got to realize that even if it's
[1:12:58] just oh oh you said well gabriel visited
[1:13:00] me well who was gabriel
[1:13:01] but christ
[1:13:04] who was micah but christ
[1:13:08] they just had they were they were
[1:13:10] immorphy
[1:13:11] it got him off they changed his mask
[1:13:14] and every time gabriel come hallelujah
[1:13:17] he says something's great going to
[1:13:19] happen
[1:13:20] why when christ steps on the scene
[1:13:22] something's about to change
[1:13:25] people of god i'm trying to tell us
[1:13:27] something you've got to come up these
[1:13:29] statues
[1:13:31] you what every trial you come through
[1:13:34] you got to whoop the devil climb jacob's
[1:13:37] ladder
[1:13:38] hallelujah that's what's making a
[1:13:40] rapture
[1:13:43] y'all hear what i'm saying now
[1:13:47] the truth of the matter is a lot of time
[1:13:49] if you're looking at your flesh you'll
[1:13:51] never see the virtues
[1:13:54] huh this old this old nasty house you're
[1:13:57] living in
[1:13:58] cannot reflect christ
[1:14:02] it's when god takes over
[1:14:07] hallelujah you said what do you mean
[1:14:09] brother branham was crossing that fence
[1:14:11] going to pray for that brother
[1:14:13] hallelujah he forgot that the bull was
[1:14:15] there
[1:14:17] all of a sudden he eat the bull he
[1:14:19] crossed the fence and the bull raised up
[1:14:22] a killer bull just killed a colored man
[1:14:24] not long ago
[1:14:25] he said i reached i went to reach for my
[1:14:28] pistol
[1:14:29] now was that a man instinct did there
[1:14:31] was fear there
[1:14:33] come on something was happening that
[1:14:35] made him look for the god
[1:14:37] hallelujah thank god for perfect love
[1:14:41] that's what people don't understand
[1:14:42] perfect love is not a thing
[1:14:44] perfect love is god himself that's the
[1:14:46] only perfect love and that's
[1:14:48] god god came on the scene and to make
[1:14:51] you know it was god
[1:14:52] brother branham said i just wish i could
[1:14:54] stay in that presence all the
[1:14:56] time it wasn't something that he stayed
[1:14:59] in all the time
[1:15:00] it was something that visited him even
[1:15:01] when it came to the bees
[1:15:03] something visited him that day cast that
[1:15:06] fear away
[1:15:07] and took control hallelujah is that
[1:15:10] right
[1:15:10] shadrach meshach and abednego you know
[1:15:14] they were
[1:15:15] how many of you come on somebody will
[1:15:17] see a blazing fire
[1:15:19] i ain't scared that's a lie flesh
[1:15:24] will fail you
[1:15:28] i know some people who are afraid of
[1:15:29] spiders
[1:15:35] flesh grown people they can't help it
[1:15:38] that's just their weakness
[1:15:42] and my point is is we need god
[1:15:45] we need that inspiration we need that
[1:15:48] visitation
[1:15:50] this thing is not collectively it's by
[1:15:53] by individuals every individual listen
[1:15:56] we're talking about marriage we're
[1:15:57] talking about a union
[1:15:58] union we're talking about god speaking
[1:15:59] secrets to you god ain't telling
[1:16:01] everything to everybody
[1:16:03] hallelujah and god you must understand
[1:16:06] coming to this rapture
[1:16:07] god ain't telling everybody and when he
[1:16:09] tells you something he knows you can
[1:16:11] keep it quiet
[1:16:15] just one little thing would have given
[1:16:16] us away
[1:16:18] right half hour silent brother i'm
[1:16:20] saying he said just one little thing
[1:16:22] moving
[1:16:23] could would have given us away the
[1:16:25] angels had to stop the seraphim had to
[1:16:26] stop
[1:16:27] everything had to stop hallelujah
[1:16:29] whatever
[1:16:30] was going on in heaven is stopped
[1:16:34] for who you and me so that we wouldn't
[1:16:36] be deceived
[1:16:38] god can never be deceived he didn't want
[1:16:41] the devil to get hold of it
[1:16:43] so that's what i'm trying to tell you
[1:16:45] amen before god can give you whatever it
[1:16:48] is
[1:16:49] you've got to come to a place where he
[1:16:50] can trust you
[1:16:55] um
[1:16:59] you know what i'm saying you can't be
[1:17:00] like samson's wife
[1:17:03] told her the secret about the about the
[1:17:05] lion and the the
[1:17:07] you know and the caucus and the bee and
[1:17:09] the honey and
[1:17:10] and the next thing she knows she done
[1:17:12] told all of phillips dies
[1:17:15] and when samson brought the riddle he
[1:17:17] found out that she they had they had
[1:17:19] they knew the it was too easy for him
[1:17:20] they knew
[1:17:23] see god looking for somebody that ain't
[1:17:26] gonna spill the beans
[1:17:27] when he can tell you something you can
[1:17:29] keep it
[1:17:33] that's what you call strength you love
[1:17:35] the lord
[1:17:36] give me a few more minutes you see one
[1:17:39] thing i
[1:17:41] and i anyway
[1:17:45] let the devil make fun of you people
[1:17:46] going to make fun of you
[1:17:48] especially now because you're saying man
[1:17:50] i'm in the message and
[1:17:51] you know what one thing i know about the
[1:17:53] message is not going to bring me to a
[1:17:54] system
[1:17:55] it's not going to turn me around and
[1:17:57] make me look at something that's already
[1:17:58] passed
[1:18:00] onward christian soldiers marching after
[1:18:02] war with the cross of jesus going on
[1:18:04] before
[1:18:05] and you and i must understand this is a
[1:18:06] time amen that god is saying
[1:18:08] wake up you need to get under this
[1:18:11] inspiration
[1:18:13] hallelujah you know anybody they don't
[1:18:16] get under it
[1:18:18] jesus was right there in jerusalem
[1:18:21] and people were still calling him devils
[1:18:23] a devil
[1:18:24] and here was these prostitutes and tax
[1:18:26] collectors and among us and
[1:18:28] everything else and they caught the
[1:18:30] inspiration when the religious people
[1:18:32] was looking over there and says
[1:18:34] who is this you see what i'm saying
[1:18:37] that's how it's going to be now so
[1:18:39] simple it passed right through you
[1:18:41] you know why because people are looking
[1:18:42] for great men of god
[1:18:44] great men of god hallelujah
[1:18:48] i can't help but chuckle sometimes
[1:18:50] because that's the way people think
[1:18:52] great men of god ain't no great men of
[1:18:54] god none
[1:18:57] you ain't great it's the god that's in
[1:18:59] you that's great
[1:19:00] and you say well what do you mean
[1:19:02] brother brooks i'm saying listen
[1:19:04] god will use some some nobodies
[1:19:08] am i right or wrong yes let me say it
[1:19:11] like this remember the rancher's son
[1:19:14] the man wanted to find her daughter uh
[1:19:16] for his
[1:19:17] wanted his son to marry and and you know
[1:19:20] he went
[1:19:20] among the wealthy and the rich and and
[1:19:23] that represents the organization
[1:19:24] denominations
[1:19:26] and while they were partying having a
[1:19:27] good time church folks
[1:19:29] drinking and smoking and lying and
[1:19:31] doping you know what i mean
[1:19:32] doing all those things and expect god
[1:19:34] was going to choose you to be something
[1:19:36] you know where he found her in the
[1:19:38] backyard rejected
[1:19:40] no shoes washing throwing dishwater out
[1:19:44] you think those stories would just give
[1:19:46] us just to make you feel good
[1:19:48] no it's a parabol jesus spoke in
[1:19:52] parables
[1:19:54] and god through the prophet was speaking
[1:19:56] in parables and the people in this
[1:19:58] message still ain't caught up yet
[1:20:00] why because we're so busy trying to be
[1:20:02] something
[1:20:04] god don't care about your shouting and
[1:20:06] your dancing
[1:20:07] that's what he was showing they had a
[1:20:10] pentecostal jubilee
[1:20:12] and god bypassed all of that and found
[1:20:15] somebody who
[1:20:16] thought and knew that they were unworthy
[1:20:19] that's what god wants he want to find a
[1:20:21] christian that that knows they're not
[1:20:23] even worthy to be a christian
[1:20:25] hallelujah and when that
[1:20:28] when that when that ranch's son saw her
[1:20:31] saw her character because that's what he
[1:20:33] was after
[1:20:34] he was at the character he's still out
[1:20:37] the character
[1:20:39] hallelujah he was out the character this
[1:20:42] is the inspiration of the day
[1:20:44] character not your own crisis character
[1:20:48] you can't take nothing with you if you
[1:20:51] don't believe me
[1:20:52] ask the egyptians
[1:20:55] all they thought was they could take all
[1:20:57] their gold and their treasures with them
[1:20:58] oh bury me with my treasure the only
[1:21:01] thing that treasure did was feed those
[1:21:03] grave robbers ain't going nowhere
[1:21:08] i don't care how diamond your diamond
[1:21:10] ring is
[1:21:11] when you die your diamond ring is
[1:21:13] standing right here
[1:21:15] y'all understand me the only thing
[1:21:17] you're going to pack with you is
[1:21:18] character
[1:21:19] whatever you are in character will
[1:21:22] determine your destination
[1:21:26] glory to god oh that that young lady
[1:21:29] says you know i can't be
[1:21:30] yeah but you're the one i like you don't
[1:21:32] want to
[1:21:33] i chose and then when she received his
[1:21:38] inspiration
[1:21:39] somebody help me here i'm paraphrasing i
[1:21:42] got it
[1:21:43] but when he she received his inspiration
[1:21:46] it was like he put a kiss on her
[1:21:49] when god kisses you you'll never forget
[1:21:52] it
[1:21:53] hallelujah i'ma say that again
[1:21:57] when god kisses you you'll never forget
[1:22:00] it
[1:22:02] hallelujah
[1:22:05] and that little girl says i don't care
[1:22:06] what you say he don't talk to me and he
[1:22:10] doesn't promise me i'm his bride
[1:22:12] you can laugh at me and i don't care if
[1:22:14] i'm poor as all get out to
[1:22:16] uh poor as dirt all i know is what he
[1:22:19] promised me and i'm saying
[1:22:20] amen so what i'm trying to tell you it's
[1:22:23] just the attitude you and i must have
[1:22:27] in this message take the promises
[1:22:30] whatever he says about you receive your
[1:22:32] promises
[1:22:34] stop crucifying yourself
[1:22:37] hallelujah live up to the expansion with
[1:22:39] joy in the presence of the lord there's
[1:22:41] fullness of joy
[1:22:43] and that's where i find that we we can
[1:22:45] tell when people are not in the presence
[1:22:46] of god because there is no joy
[1:22:49] hallelujah in the right hands what
[1:22:51] pleasure's forevermore
[1:22:52] i have pleasure in christ i don't need
[1:22:56] nobody else's i have pleasure in christ
[1:22:59] there's nothing like a holy ghost
[1:23:00] feeling oh
[1:23:02] somebody help me here you love the lord
[1:23:05] now listen here it is
[1:23:09] y'all believe the bible according to
[1:23:12] isaiah 43 1-7
[1:23:14] but now thus said the lord that created
[1:23:16] thee o jacob
[1:23:18] and he that formed thee o israel fear
[1:23:21] not
[1:23:22] for i have redeemed thee i have called
[1:23:25] thee
[1:23:26] by thy name thou art mine
[1:23:30] when thou passes through the waters
[1:23:34] i will be with thee hallelujah
[1:23:38] and through the rivers they shall not
[1:23:40] overflow thee
[1:23:42] when they are walking through the fire
[1:23:45] thou shall not be burned
[1:23:48] neither shall the flame kindle upon thee
[1:23:52] now think about it we've seen it happen
[1:23:56] we've seen it shadrach meshach and
[1:23:58] abednego
[1:23:59] we've seen it we've seen it when when
[1:24:02] israel
[1:24:02] crossed the the the river and and and
[1:24:06] the jordan
[1:24:06] red sea and the jaw we've seen it
[1:24:09] hallelujah
[1:24:10] we've heard and we've seen amen when
[1:24:12] they threw john
[1:24:13] amen into a a big of oil
[1:24:17] to burn him he cook him whatever they
[1:24:20] were trying to do
[1:24:21] hallelujah don't you
[1:24:24] see what god is doing he's trying to
[1:24:27] show you
[1:24:28] that you have become invincible to the
[1:24:31] elements of this world
[1:24:36] if the seals being opened
[1:24:39] has placed us back like the prophet god
[1:24:41] said into a place
[1:24:43] before we sin that means the full
[1:24:47] authority of a son
[1:24:48] and daughter of god has been restored
[1:24:51] but it cannot
[1:24:52] operate without the faith of god
[1:24:56] you need faith to operate it
[1:25:02] what did god do promise you a rapture
[1:25:06] he promised you a rapture and then he
[1:25:09] raptures brother branham for the moment
[1:25:12] brother brandon wasn't the only one that
[1:25:13] was raptured paul was too
[1:25:16] paul said i was caught up in the third
[1:25:17] of heaven i don't know whether i was in
[1:25:20] the body or out the body that's what he
[1:25:22] said
[1:25:24] and god comes right around and take the
[1:25:26] last angel messenger
[1:25:28] and he catches him up and all he can do
[1:25:31] is come back and says i was caught up
[1:25:33] those seven angels picked me up and i
[1:25:35] was in the constellation
[1:25:37] you know what when he came back he
[1:25:38] couldn't remember a thing
[1:25:42] think that like god come right back and
[1:25:45] then those seven angels he said
[1:25:46] oh i got he said you see how mysterious
[1:25:50] he's in the seventh seal
[1:25:51] he said you see how mysterious this has
[1:25:52] been
[1:25:54] the angels of the lord has visited me
[1:25:57] he said i was going to open those seals
[1:25:59] according to my own knowledge
[1:26:01] you know reading this book and reading
[1:26:03] that book and things like that
[1:26:06] you know and everything he said but uh
[1:26:08] then then the angel
[1:26:09] the minister the inspiration would come
[1:26:14] people said like i said this morning it
[1:26:16] could not have been the seven church age
[1:26:18] messengers
[1:26:18] it was not their theophanies these men
[1:26:22] had to have angels to minister to them
[1:26:24] throughout the church ages
[1:26:26] hallelujah but those seven angels one
[1:26:29] blast
[1:26:31] and seven angels came one god
[1:26:36] and separated himself in seven ways
[1:26:39] ministering they may have had separate
[1:26:42] bodies but it was god who was doing the
[1:26:44] ministry
[1:26:46] hey there's nothing nothing nothing
[1:26:49] nothing
[1:26:49] that you and i can claim and say we did
[1:26:51] anything
[1:26:55] huh calling micah calling gabriel call
[1:26:58] him whatever
[1:26:59] brother better say when that angel went
[1:27:01] down to see see
[1:27:02] see abraham he he jumped into three
[1:27:06] bodies
[1:27:09] and then he said
[1:27:12] two of those angels went down to sodom
[1:27:16] just trying to confirm to you that oral
[1:27:18] robbers and billy graham's ministry was
[1:27:20] of god
[1:27:22] and he said that one that stayed with
[1:27:24] abraham
[1:27:26] the elected
[1:27:30] the chosen hey
[1:27:33] y'all i'll tell you what i don't know
[1:27:34] when when people gonna really receive
[1:27:36] that
[1:27:37] the elected the chosen
[1:27:41] of god you everybody can't see this but
[1:27:44] he chose you to see it he
[1:27:46] y'all believe that you believe in
[1:27:48] revelation blessed is the man who hear
[1:27:51] and see it
[1:27:51] you see it you hear it you receive it
[1:27:55] let me move on so when you say what do
[1:27:57] you mean
[1:27:58] so you can understand what i mean the
[1:28:00] elements has nothing to do we you say
[1:28:02] what
[1:28:03] if you don't believe that how you're
[1:28:04] going to be translated let me ask you
[1:28:06] how
[1:28:07] when jesus rose from the dead guess what
[1:28:09] he did
[1:28:11] he walked through the wall
[1:28:14] huh well that's jesus
[1:28:18] what about philip phillip explain to me
[1:28:22] what happened to you
[1:28:23] how would you translate it and you found
[1:28:26] yourself in the desert
[1:28:28] no chariot right
[1:28:31] huh you say oh brother what you're
[1:28:34] saying well what about when peter james
[1:28:36] and john when they were in jail and
[1:28:37] he'd come to his angel nobody saw the
[1:28:40] angel coming in and going out
[1:28:42] but the doors were swinging wide open
[1:28:45] y'all don't believe that i believe that
[1:28:47] with all my heart
[1:28:49] hallelujah my same god amen he turned
[1:28:52] water into wine
[1:28:53] now if he did it then he can do it when
[1:28:55] we need it
[1:28:58] he called fish and bread and all these
[1:29:00] things that fouls are there
[1:29:02] hey this government or governments
[1:29:05] no matter where they are they hate the
[1:29:08] bride
[1:29:10] because the bride represents the truth
[1:29:15] and as long as we're here we're spoiling
[1:29:17] their program
[1:29:19] it is only after the pride is gone when
[1:29:22] satan can do whatever he wants
[1:29:24] to do but as long as we're here we're
[1:29:26] spalling his program
[1:29:28] hallelujah you love the lord oh yes
[1:29:33] let me let me just read it so you say
[1:29:35] listen in series of time
[1:29:37] signs of the end time he says well then
[1:29:39] i turned again and i thought
[1:29:40] lord god what does this vision mean i
[1:29:44] wondered
[1:29:44] and then it come to me not a voice just
[1:29:47] come to me oh
[1:29:48] that is the angels of the lord coming to
[1:29:51] me
[1:29:52] my new commission and when i thought
[1:29:54] that i raised up
[1:29:56] my hands and said oh lord jesus what
[1:29:58] will you have me to do
[1:30:00] and the visions left me for almost an
[1:30:02] hour
[1:30:03] and and i couldn't feel
[1:30:07] now you people know that the blessings
[1:30:10] of the lord is what the blessing of the
[1:30:11] lord is
[1:30:12] but the power of the lord is altogether
[1:30:14] different
[1:30:15] the power of the lord in them kind of a
[1:30:18] places
[1:30:19] i felt it many many times before
[1:30:21] envisions
[1:30:22] but never like that i feel
[1:30:26] it feels like a reverent fear
[1:30:29] i was so scared until i was paralyzed
[1:30:32] in the presence of these beings
[1:30:37] so he was in the presence of seven
[1:30:39] beings
[1:30:40] and he felt paralyzed
[1:30:43] now have you noticed the mysterious part
[1:30:46] of this week
[1:30:46] now he's opening up god is ministering
[1:30:48] to the seven seals that what it is
[1:30:51] that's what it's been it's not it's been
[1:30:55] not a human being a man
[1:30:58] it has been the angels of the lord
[1:31:02] and there is witnesses of three sitting
[1:31:05] in here that a week ago a little over a
[1:31:07] week ago
[1:31:08] i was up way back in the mountains near
[1:31:10] nearly in mexico
[1:31:12] and two brethren that's sitting here
[1:31:14] picking cocker barrels
[1:31:15] off sam uh the sandburgs off the
[1:31:18] trousers leg
[1:31:19] and a blast went off that almost looked
[1:31:22] like
[1:31:22] shook the mountains down now that's
[1:31:25] right
[1:31:25] i never told my brethren but they know
[1:31:27] they noticed
[1:31:28] uh but they noticed a difference and he
[1:31:31] said unto me
[1:31:32] now be ready go
[1:31:35] east here is the interpretation of that
[1:31:38] vision see
[1:31:39] now to let you know brother softman has
[1:31:41] not got the net game
[1:31:43] that he went after we was trying to get
[1:31:45] it for him
[1:31:46] and he said now tonight for assigned to
[1:31:48] you he isn't going to do it
[1:31:51] just you just consecrate yourself
[1:31:54] at this time for the visitation of these
[1:31:57] angels
[1:31:58] now let me ask you a question if brother
[1:32:00] branham had to constantly create himself
[1:32:02] for the visitation of those angels what
[1:32:04] do you think you got to do
[1:32:09] huh you gotta consecrate yourself you
[1:32:12] think god's just gonna drop things down
[1:32:15] without consecration huh
[1:32:18] think about it even even when it came to
[1:32:21] uh uh uh uh uh uh how could
[1:32:26] esther even when it came to esther
[1:32:28] esther says listen i'm going to
[1:32:29] consecrate myself i got god i want god
[1:32:31] to do something here
[1:32:33] huh said i don't want nobody eating or
[1:32:36] drinking for three days
[1:32:38] oh i wonder can we do that still
[1:32:41] three days don't eat or drink three days
[1:32:44] he could have been could have been in
[1:32:47] this generation
[1:32:50] and all the people fasted for three
[1:32:53] days because she says if i perish
[1:32:57] let me perish that's the inspiration i'm
[1:32:59] going to see the king
[1:33:01] huh and god answered her prayer
[1:33:06] ah she was moving under that inspiration
[1:33:08] she cared nothing about her life
[1:33:10] her whole desire was to see the people
[1:33:13] of god
[1:33:14] saved yeah it wasn't just about her
[1:33:17] she could like like like uh her uncle
[1:33:19] said mordecai said you could just stay
[1:33:21] in this castle but you know one day
[1:33:23] it'll catch up with you they're gonna
[1:33:24] find out you're a jew one day or the
[1:33:25] other
[1:33:26] or you could think well god put me here
[1:33:30] for such a time as this
[1:33:33] and that's what god has done for us but
[1:33:35] tell you something people to whom much
[1:33:36] is given much is required
[1:33:38] we can sit up here and think oh i got it
[1:33:40] made but god didn't give us this
[1:33:43] this blessed message to sit still on it
[1:33:46] but you know what you can not move
[1:33:49] until the inspiration comes
[1:33:52] what is an inspiration i'mma close i'm
[1:33:55] not done i'm still i'm gonna lay onto
[1:33:56] this thing
[1:33:57] lord willing i'll be here uh sunday uh
[1:34:01] the ninth of next month
[1:34:04] brother simon will be coming he'll be
[1:34:06] preaching for us on saturday and
[1:34:08] sunday simon smith he'll be coming
[1:34:11] already got his ticket and everything
[1:34:14] so he'll be coming on the ninth or that
[1:34:17] weekend of the ninth
[1:34:18] so let's prepare for him and uh but
[1:34:21] i am going to be laying in on this
[1:34:23] because i really believe
[1:34:24] that it is so important for us to see
[1:34:27] where we are
[1:34:28] because see it's when you get laid easy
[1:34:31] when everything gets easy
[1:34:32] when you look like what we're doing now
[1:34:34] right satan shut down everything
[1:34:36] people are relaxed even the christian
[1:34:39] instead of saying oh my god god is doing
[1:34:41] something
[1:34:41] i better make myself ready because
[1:34:43] remember that was the inspiration of the
[1:34:45] girl
[1:34:46] i'm gonna make he don't promise me but i
[1:34:49] must make myself ready
[1:34:52] see we want god to do it all for us but
[1:34:54] you must make yourself ready
[1:34:56] amen hallelujah
[1:35:00] those who cease from sin what
[1:35:03] will suffer in the flesh
[1:35:06] you're going to suffer in your flesh
[1:35:07] your flesh is going to want to do
[1:35:09] everything you
[1:35:09] always ever wanted to do but you got to
[1:35:12] have a greater power on the inside
[1:35:14] like we all say great is he that's in me
[1:35:16] than any he that is in the world
[1:35:17] it's true it's true y'all know that it
[1:35:21] is true i know i'm up here and i i'm
[1:35:23] acting like a
[1:35:24] a a child but i can't help it i feel so
[1:35:27] good right now until i'm
[1:35:29] beside myself hallelujah normally when i
[1:35:32] was in
[1:35:32] in the nomination i'll be shouting and
[1:35:34] dancing and everything else running
[1:35:35] right now but i'm feeling that now with
[1:35:37] control
[1:35:39] huh i'm feeling that with control i
[1:35:41] don't need i don't i don't have to do
[1:35:43] all of that now
[1:35:44] i'm letting this thing saturate my being
[1:35:51] a divine influence directly
[1:35:56] and immediately exerted upon the mind
[1:35:59] or soul that's what an inspiration is
[1:36:04] hallelujah you love the lord
[1:36:08] he opened that book
[1:36:12] and i say this by by the grace of god
[1:36:14] and he restored the seed
[1:36:18] look what the prophet of god says he
[1:36:20] said man is always praising god for what
[1:36:22] he's done
[1:36:24] always looking forward for what he will
[1:36:26] do
[1:36:27] and in no and in ignoring what he's
[1:36:30] doing
[1:36:32] it's always been that same thing
[1:36:35] and everybody has got his own private
[1:36:38] interpretation
[1:36:39] god is his own interpreter
[1:36:42] god don't need no one to interpret the
[1:36:45] bible said it without
[1:36:47] interpretation it don't need man god
[1:36:50] interprets the bible himself
[1:36:52] god said let there be and there was
[1:36:54] light that
[1:36:55] sheltered god said a virgin shall
[1:36:57] conceive and she did
[1:36:58] that settled it and when god says
[1:37:01] anything
[1:37:02] and vindicate it that's his
[1:37:04] interpretation
[1:37:05] of it
[1:37:08] so i'm saying if we allow people
[1:37:12] to take away the cloud you're literally
[1:37:16] allowing the devil to take away your
[1:37:18] rapture
[1:37:19] take away all your promise take away
[1:37:22] everything the messenger stood for
[1:37:24] because that was the highlight of his
[1:37:25] ministry to do what
[1:37:28] point you to jesus christ
[1:37:31] like the first john the baptist pointed
[1:37:33] his disciples
[1:37:34] to jesus christ and that same anointing
[1:37:38] that was on elijah then says
[1:37:39] i must decrease and he must increase
[1:37:43] y'all hear what i'm saying hallelujah i
[1:37:46] don't have a prophet
[1:37:47] growing up in me i have jesus christ
[1:37:50] i'm growing up into him and he's growing
[1:37:53] up in me
[1:37:54] let's stand i'm telling you i i can't
[1:37:56] explain what i'm trying
[1:37:57] i'm just trying to preach it the way he
[1:37:59] gave it to me all i know
[1:38:01] is it's it's really disturbing when you
[1:38:03] see
[1:38:04] it ain't taking hold to people you know
[1:38:06] you can't make it happen
[1:38:07] it just you pray that somehow the people
[1:38:10] would chew it like could
[1:38:12] go home and chew on it amen until it
[1:38:15] becomes a part of you
[1:38:17] because i'm going to tell you something
[1:38:19] being part of the message system
[1:38:22] is not what savior no more than a
[1:38:24] baptist system or
[1:38:26] pentecostal system or catholic system
[1:38:28] save you
[1:38:29] none of that has any saving grace it can
[1:38:32] teach you
[1:38:33] it can program you it can show you how
[1:38:36] to do it right
[1:38:37] but that doesn't mean nothing if the
[1:38:39] true life of god is not in you
[1:38:41] you and i need life and only christ can
[1:38:44] give us that life
[1:38:46] there's so many that's why people fall
[1:38:48] away like fly
[1:38:50] because they did it right they did it
[1:38:51] right they did it right but they
[1:38:53] never came in contact hallelujah
[1:38:56] and if you don't come in contact with
[1:38:58] jesus christ you'll never be impregnated
[1:39:00] with it
[1:39:01] hallelujah there's got to be an
[1:39:02] impregnation
[1:39:04] of god in you hallelujah and you can't
[1:39:07] just
[1:39:08] your system can't do that like i said
[1:39:11] this morning
[1:39:12] one thing the system cannot do and that
[1:39:14] is give you divine love
[1:39:16] it can tell you how to be nice to each
[1:39:18] other oh
[1:39:19] you know and like i said i mean even our
[1:39:22] prophet said that
[1:39:23] a system like like like christian
[1:39:25] science can
[1:39:27] manufacture all of those virtues
