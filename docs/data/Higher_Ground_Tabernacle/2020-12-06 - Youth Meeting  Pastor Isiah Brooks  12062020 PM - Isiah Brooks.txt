favorites amen God is good to us I appreciate everybody by God's grace in my rushing I left my iPad and I don't have my Bible and using the anointed word ofac we appreciate Lord Jesus Christ we still have something to say and uh we'll just get right into the word because of the lateness of the hour we're going to ask that you turn with us to judges the 13th chapter we appreciate you all um staying around and uh we had no idea was going to take us this long to get back we had two in one Service uh but it all turned out really well at least I left there feeling that way so we'll praise the Lord for that and uh so uh I'm just going to reiterate some of the things that I did say uh this morning in Iowa City just to just to get us all on one Accord um as I said turn with us to uh judges the 13th chapter there's a lot to be said in this chapter uh understand by God's grace that I I constantly say that we're living in the last days and maybe I'm beside myself but I I like being this way because it keeps me watching and praying so we're going to read I had no idea it was Charles's birthday did y'all know that okay okay but they desired to come and I I don't know whether it's because I stayed in church so long till their parents decided that they couldn't come because they didn't want them coming back at night so had I known that I would have done a little better but I I just what didn't know so anyway uh they did want to come but the parent says no so it's okay I begin to read and the children of Israel did Evil again in the sight of the Lord and the Lord delivered them into the hands of the Philistines 40 years and there was a certain man of zor of the family of the danites whose name was manoah and his wife was baren and bared not and the angel of the Lord appeared unto the woman and said unto her behold now Thou Art baren and beareth not but Thou shalt conceive and bear a son now therefore beware I pray thee and drink not wine nor strong drink and eat not any unclean thing for Lo Thou shalt conceive and bear a son and no razor shall come upon his head for the child shall be a Nazarite unto God from the womb and he shall begin to deliver Israel out of the hands of the Philistines then the woman came and told her husband and saying a man of God came unto me and his continent was like the countenance of an angel of God very terrible but I asked him not whence he was neither told he me his name but he said unto me behold Thou shalt conceive and bear a son and and uh and now drink no wine nor strong drink neither eat any unclean thing for the child shall be a Nazarite to God whom the womb from the womb to the day of his death then manoah intreated the Lord and said oh my Lord let the man of God which thou did Sin come again unto us and teach us what we shall do unto the child that shall be born and God hearkened to the voice of manoah and the angel of God came unto the woman woman as she sat in the field but no but manoah her husband was not with her and the woman made haste and ran and showed her husband and said unto him behold the man have appeared unto me that came unto me the other day and manoah arose and went after his wife and came to the man and he said unto him art thou the man that speaketh unto the woman he said I am and Mano said now let thy words come to pass how shall we order uh the child and how shall we do unto him and the angel of the Lord said unto manoah of all that I have said unto you to the woman let her beware she may not eat of anything that come cometh of the thine neither let her drink wine or strong drink nor eat of any unclean thing all that I command her let her observe and manoah said unto the angel of the Lord I pray thee let us detain thee until we have made ready a kid for thee and the angel of the Lord said unto manoah though thou detain me I will not eat of excuse me thy bread and if thou Wilt offer a burnt offering thou must offer it unto the Lord for vano knew not that he was an angel of the Lord that's very important and manoah said unto the angel of the Lord what is thy name and when he when thy uh excuse me and when thy saying come to pass we may do these honor and the angel of the Lord said unto him why ask thou thus after my name seeing it is a secret let's just stop there father God we come before you Lord we thank you for your grace we thank you for your mercy we thank you for all that you have done for us and everything that you are doing doing for us we pray this evening that you would bless oh God uh our eyes that we may see let thy perfect will be done in our lives Lord in Jesus Christ's name we pray pray amen you may be seated we went deer hunting yesterday and didn't get one but as the deer was coming my way it decided to change its mind and go the other way and my neighbor ended up getting the deer so at least we got something but I thank God for the experience and uh I appreciate God for being so good to me because I've always wanted to Dear hunt eyes to see remember I was going to work with that uh the last service having eyes to see is important and as young people as young men we want you to understand that this particular uh scripture reading was read once again in the message I believe once more oh Lord once more was the one done after the seals were open and you know a lot of times I coming up in the message we thought the message oh Lord once more was given basically to those who were of the denomination wanting a refilling wed a new experience with God but after the seals we know that the door has already brother brandom had already been thrown out of the system they were no longer having much to do with him and now he was now focusing on a bride because his ministry had change it was no longer just to the denomination but it was it was actually to the bride remember brother brandom said the move is on for the bride and God had now taken a church out of a church right so we got to understand too that none of us at that time or any of them at that time because I wasn't living they did not know that brother Brandon was going to pass they didn't know that he was going to change but he kept trying to tell them as like John did I must decrease and he must increase when I'm talking uh working with judges I I want you to understand that that God took an imperfect man and made him a man of a a man who was full of false like you and I we are full of false we we have to confess every day but understand that this man was chosen to be something that in his own power he could never be God called him to be a Nazarite he could he was not to drink wine he was not to run with women he was not to uh uh engage himself in any unkind in any unclean living he was never Amen to drink or eat anything that was unclean and it just seemed like Samson never got the message cuz he did everything but that and understand this is why I'm I'm talking tonight or today with you young men and I really appreciate the Lord what he's done I appreciate your Zeal uh and and and your desire to serve the Lord you you don't know what staying here meant has me is meaning to me you know the impact that you uh have have placed in my life today because even the Ministry needs an encouragement encouraging they need to be encouraged and your being here has encouraged me so just so that you understand that you being young you know one of the things that uh uh Paul wrote to Timothy to to flee useful lust because he knew that being young as he is he was going to have a battle understand also that when it comes to Samson Samson didn't create himself God created Samson but there's a thing about DNA that follows you whatever in your DNA is there and the only thing that can decode you is God himself he's the only thing that can cancel out all of those things that have traveled for thousands of years and now that are not occupying you in the form of DNA you say well brother I I I think I know I'm safe but let me tell you this Adam had a problem and his problem was that he took his wife without the permission of God and that fall brought in everything else that's right amen and we can cut it short and show you how that after the fall polygamy was introduced because there was that Gene there that had been hybrid it just was mixed with the real thing and without being converted those genes of your fathers your forefathers and all that come before you has potential to live again for 400 years it can live again and if somebody else break it and break it and break it and break it it almost become Everlasting your problems what's in your flesh the thing that makes you feel like you're about to lose your mind in this day the thing that Roars every day that that torments you that comes at you in a way that you wonder sometime am I really say but to encourage you that is the normal it is what the fall brought to you right but we understand that if we could just you know brother talked about he talked about getting that young man or that young woman to Jesus Christ before they reach that age of puberty because if the Holy Ghost if he can get that Holy Ghost in him that Holy Ghost has a power to press it down to keep it keep it keep it dead in Samson's life think about it do you think that God didn't know what Samson was going to do brother random preaches a message perfect strength and perfect weakness so he he knew he knew in this day the weakness of the Bride he understood what she was going to go through she he understood The Temptations and many times he saw the corruption of the world and he prayed oh God for his own children Rebecca and Joseph and the rest of them because he knew what they were going to face he understood and he said amen without the Holy Ghost what happens rock and roll going to get that person you see you have no power over this particular Gene in your life without God that's right David who was a king he passed the genetics he passed that corrupted gene on to his own son right David had a problem with women and then now you see over here you see Solomon having the same problem but just worse it doesn't get better and with the uh hybrid foods and everything that we're eating now it somehow it seemed to heightened you know the desires of the world that's in us and this is why Jesus told Nicodemus no matter what man you must be born again and like I tell people I said the problem is we don't want to die and we don't want to rot and that is where we must come to it is what we must come to you know I'm Different in the sense that I hate religion I hate sister I hate everything that makes it look make make uh pretend to be God that's what I'm saying I don't like that because that's where Deception comes in I don't want to be deceived you know give me the real or give me nothing at all right I don't want a substitute or a counterfeit holy ghost that works for me sometimes I need the Holy Ghost to work for me all the time amen and this is what I'm trying to tell the people I told the people there even in City I said don't you understand you and I have the potential of becoming the manifestation of the prophet's Vision right a bribe without spot wrinkle or blemish but you got to want it right you got to want it it's something that you've got to believe it's true in spite of everything that people are saying it is not you must believe that it is true you got to you got to believe that what brother Brandon preached is truth amen and it was not something of his imagination but it was something that God revealed to him and I believe it with all of my heart amen that that we're going to be that I cannot accept anything else I can't I got a sometimes I feel like in my own mind I'm about to lose my mind because I so love and thirst God thirst for God and at the same time I see all my failures anybody know what I'm talking about but here was here was uh H uh H H Samson who was ordained and he knew his parents when Noah and his wife was told that you was a proper child and you was ordained like many of us born into this message you an elected one you've been chosen of God and you know these things but you still have that Devil's desire to do evil Hello it is it's there no matter how we dress it up it's there Hallelujah and you've got to be born again you can't allow yourself to think that your covering of religion is going to make it right it will not religion only magnifies your problems and so I was telling them you know a lot of time we don't want to cry out we don't we don't break down enough for God to come on the scene because you got to understand if we break down ourselves like the dead on the day of Pentecost even after that when those people got the Holy Ghost on theza street if we break down like brother brandham did he was a prophet but you know he had to break down he had to dissolve all of his thoughts and desires he had to come down to say God I am nothing I'm worthless and until you break down and you know re re release everything that you think you know about God until you come to that place you're not going to go anywhere because think about it what is truth and almost every message Church like in the days of Judges is Right In Their Own eyes the prophet is going off to seeing Moses the holy spirit is lifting anybody know that yes sir that's why you can't get people to do nothing they don't even want to worship God they want to but they don't have the strength or the power I don't know how it all works but we're living in a day like the day of Judges where everybody every preacher everybody think they're right we can't all be right there's only one right and that just the the word of God Amen but you got to understand if that be true then I'm like Samson I can still cry out but Samson failed God so much right he was a laughter he was a laughter he was the joke of the Philistines seen the miracles of god seen what God had done picked up the gates of Gaza all of these great things and brother B said that's just the way the Pentecostal Church used to be they had power in the church but something happened cuz I want you to understand the coming of the Lord because when the angel first appeared unto mon Noah's wife it's am amazing how she's such a mystery and he appears to her and with no name but she knew there was something special about this man you know kind of like the woman at the well talk with him just a little bit and your deser and kick in this is not an ordinary man he may not have looked like a cherub he may not have looked like a some great Angelic being but he he appeared like he was a man don't you see what I'm saying that was brother bram's ministry right there in the scripture part of it didn't look like an Angel but they say once you got in his presence you could feel that love you knew something was different about this man and one thing I love about brother bandam he was not interested in you knowing his name he wanted you to know something greater than that so the first appearing of this Angel comes to manoah's wife and she types out the church B AR right and she goes to her husband and tells her husband of this visitation she said but you know he's more than a man there's something about this man and I can't explain it but I believe he was sent by God so listen this is amazes me because manoah goes and pray and says God if if this you be you come again the first coming or the first appearing was him coming to mano's wife but the second appearing amen he comes to Manor's wife again why because she's the one that's going to bring forth the child the promise is given to her think about it what scripture you know of where God by passes the man and then when Mano preaches I mean speak prays God bypasses Mano again and comes to this woman and this time the woman has to go to mano and say hey the angel is here now here come Mano now he's coming in and he sees this man and he's perceiving and see that's that that that's the way I love this because the true seed of God has a way of perceiving right and that's what the woman at the well as wicked as she was she was just like a an example of what Samson was no telling what she was or should have been but she said I perceive that thou art a prophet see when you get into the presence of a real godly man or a man of God you ought to have a perception that he is that's right and so what happens amen man Noah began PR say say I'm going to detain you we're going to make an offering and the angel said that's okay you can detain me I'll stay here for a while but understand I'm not going to eat what you're preparing give it unto the Lord what was he saying I don't want your praise the praise don't belong to me you see where I'm at I'm right there where John fell at the feet of the Angel and he says uhuh uhuh get up worship God and him only the same anointing the same kind of Angel amen is now in the presence of mano and his wife a mystery is unfolding unto them and all of a sudden they do the sacrifice and this Angel goes up in the fire think about that and then the Bible says that Manor perceived that this was the angel of the Lord such a mystery but you know everybody don't understand that the message did not come by a man it came by the angel of the Lord that's right and in all of this you can see seals and everything everything's unfolding here was Samson now growing up now he's he know he's supposed to be faithful but it was God's perfect will he was like a he was like a a uh how can I say a secret weapon because God had ordained him to destroy the Philistines and don't you understand that's what's happening we're going to have a Mount Zion Showdown that's it we've been ordained like Samson has been ordained and this is why I love judges because in the judges is nobody's perfect everybody that God uses have false Hallelujah messed up if we was to judge it we' say oh how can God ever use Samson look at him he's so backl ain't no good thing can come out of him but what they did not understand what they do not not understand we may may not be in full power right now Hallelujah but we have been ordained Hallelujah to shut the mouths of the the gainsayers we and young people this is what if if we could get you to see the message is 100% right yes it is if we can get you to see that you don't have to fear you don't have to doubt no matter how your problems how many you have that has nothing to do with God's choosing you and electing you oh God had a season and at Samson's darkest hour that's when God put him on display amen huh when God had put Samson in a place where Samson didn't even have eyes to see himself he didn't see a prophet he didn't see a man called from God he didn't see nothing and the only thing his blindness could get him to do was to look up Hallelujah he was blind in his natural but in his spiritual he knew he was ordained amen y'all understand what I'm saying amen he was ordained people I'm trying to tell you it it's not by power it's not by might but it's by God's spirit that we're going to conquer this enemy amen Hallelujah and Samson trials gain him victory over himself hello that's what Trials Come Trials come to make you strong that's right because God knows that every trial you go through at the end of The Journey you're going to be stronger in faith and in trust Hallelujah when you know God has brought you from a mighty long way I love the most s you don't know like I know what God has done for me amen and you can't tell it like I can tell it see it it's because that individual whoever they may be have gone through the trials some through the wat some through the flood some through God great trials but all through the blood see that is the the the the Walk of a true Christian and we're not afraid to suffer we're not afraid to go through trials We're Not Afraid this is what we come for we come to show Satan in his own Eden that God does not to give God don't have to give me a lollipop for me to serve him I'm not a child amen I'm a Man in Christ right and we can handle the things that God has given us because greater is he that is in us than he that is in the world here was Samson now going on around the same circles anybody know what I'm talking about you wonder when God going to ever deliver you you go around that same old Circle you know treading the corn treading the corn and you wish you could get free but you can't cuz you're bound God binds you to that trial he binds you to it Lord deliver me not yet keep on grinding keep on grinding not yet Hallelujah but understand God had a day a day for your Victory amen hallelujah is that right so is it now don't get discouraged with God because you keep falling and falling just get up just get up just get up keep on grinding because God has already ordained your day of Deliverance Hallelujah and during that time of Deliverance guess what you come out of is a victory you might be beat Up all In the Flesh you may not be the handsome man that you thought you was or used to be but guess what at the end of the day you know what God does he take that man who would who brought this the gospel to disgrace and hang him up in the Hall of Fame amen amen look how bad Samson was but when you think of Samson you don't think of about Delilah you don't think about all the the the the sin he did you think about Samson the strong man amen the Sams de the delil and every yeah that's what you're looking at don't get discourage God's Eye Is on the Sparrow and he watches us you know you you look at Samson this is the important part that I want to bring you because understand that unconverted seed unconverted seed carries the DNA or the germ or the gene of of of betrayal you understand me here was Samson this is why you've got to be you have to be converted this is why he gave Peter an encouragement Peter when thou art converted strengthen your brother because he knew Peter before the the crucifixion was not converted that's right and he knew Peter was going to deny him he told him you're going to not deny me you're going to betray me three times you understand me so don't ever say well I ain't going to do this that if you're not converted you still have that Gene it's passed on to you whether you like it or not is that the truth Abraham who was a true seed of God lied that was betraying the word he knew that knew better than that and it passed on to his son Isaac Isaac did the same thing Abraham did see it moves on and this is what what God is showing you that law those laws that work that there but the only thing that can kill that law is the grace of God you understand me the Holy Ghost in you you got to die you got to rot whatever it is you say well I don't know how to die I don't know how to rot he knows it's not the seed that determines the rottening of itself it's the sun it's the condition that the Sun and the weather and everything else bring upon that seed that make it die and rot and then that life come forth you got to pray that no matter how painful everybody say well I I don't you know you know I don't want patience you know I want to pray I want patience but I don't want to pray for it because tribulation bringeth patience hello that's the way God works it can't get out of it you either get it or you don't but the point is you got to realize by God's grace that god listen let me tell y'all something you may think you have problems that nobody can understand what they are because nobody goes through it like I I go through it and to you know the Bible doesn't go into detail but it does say that Jesus was tempted in every way that's right so you ain't got nothing over on Jesus he was tempted in every way but without sin he can't understand me yes he can I don't care how dark how dark your situation may be he understands that's why he came right amen he's the comforter he came to understand what you suffer in the flesh so he can comfort you he's never left us alone and he never will I feel like sh this going better than the morning but my whole point is this I'm trying to encourage you young men you don't know what you got you possess strength you possess energy you possess God you you got just what God can use you really do but you know what you got to die to yourself not my will but thine be done and you know what only that comes through prayer you know you can't collectively groupy go down on your knees and get like what you really want you got to get in your secret place well I don't feel like praying your flesh ain't going to never feel like praying cuz your flesh knows that you're praying to destroy it it's going to make you sleepy it's going to let thoughts run through your mind but you need the Holy Ghost to shut him down right Lord shut these thoughts down how y'all know what I'm talking about you can't get on get down on your knees and your phone is on forget it it's going to ring every time you get close to getting into something your phone going to ding or ring right that's what it does and from that point on your concentration is done cuz you're wondering who's calling me you can't do it you got to shut the world off every phone you can't even tell people some I'm telling you you tell somebody where you going the in before you done right in the midst of your prayer they're going to knock on your door or something it's the way the devil Works break all that all that you don't don't achieve you y'all know what it what I'm talking about do you know how difficult it is to get into that channel of prayer nowadays oh it's very difficult that's why you got to get to a place where you can't be disturbed a lot of people think you don't need it all I need to do is believe well brother Brandon preached a message desperation after he open after the opening of the seals and he says that's what we need that's right this is an hour of ever before this is a day of desperation and that's what happened to Samson but let me go on in showing that this thing also was like a type of the seals because here was Samson he's he kills a lion a roaring lion which is a type of the devil it wasn't God he killed a lion then he comes back to the lion and he finds amen that that the lion amen has a sweet a honeycomb with bees and all that and Samson looked at it and and he kind of open the seal up and he get a little bit of that honey right the bitter part was that he had to kill the enemy the sweet part was that he enjoyed the victory right and so now he had a mystery and who he tells who does he tell he tells his wife and then after that he has a what you call a bachelor party I think it was 60 or 70 men and in in the midst of this B this Bast party now this is denominational now messing with Samson's wife I want the mystery of it see Samson wasn't the only one that told something that he shouldn't have but there was something rolled up there that he says listen if you can give me you know the answer to this what they call those things riddles he said uh this is what going to happen I can read all of that but the point is the secret was with the wife and those men kept flirting with the lia and all that is that right until she finally told the secret and Samson when they told him the mystery of it because he knew nobody else could know what that was you see what I'm saying that is the that is the uh danger of take casting your pearls be among this the swine that's the danger of it everybody is not it's not given to everybody to know the Mysteries it's given to you you understand what I'm saying so it literally angered Sam son and what did he do 70 Church agents however you want to work it the whole point is Samson says I'm gonna get you cuz you've been flirting with my wife and y'all know that's true there's so many people in the outside of this message who knows some of this message because they've been flirting with the message that's right they preaching it out there but they're not telling them where they got it from Samson say uhuh this is Harvest Time and I'm going to show you what I'm going to do with you he got about how many foxes was it tied there seven foxes I believe seven Church agents tied their tails together and set it on fire they went through the wheat field and destroyed all of the Harvest and God says I'm going to destroy all of the Harvest y'all understand what I'm saying and he actually killed Delilah and her husband was destroyed excuse me and her daddy was destroyed by fire because Delilah's Daddy had given her to another man you say how can that be remember demon sharan who gave the Pentecost over to another man and all those Pentecostals who followed demon sh car because he was called father Pentecost and he took the United Pentecostals and all those who should have been the bride under this message of Malachi 4 took it away and God says I'm going to destroy you and her because brother Bram says now demons should know better I taught demons that the Catholic church was the mark of the beast I taught him and he led all of those people right now the Assembly of God the Church of God and all these people who followed brother brand you know brother brandom filled those people churches up the Revival was because of him and God working through him he one time he called all of the upcs and everybody my children because they came to Christ through his ministry you understand me but you see what I'm saying even in those victories amen they still denied and married another God said I'm going to destroy now I'm I'm coming to my point so you can understand in all that Samson did and I ain't going to be long because of we spent the time but I want to give you a thought always believe there's a possibility never lose your possibility I don't care how bad you've Fallen I don't care how many times Satan that body slammed you however you want to say it never give up your possibility never give up your hope now this is where hope comes in you lose hope you lose everything cuz you don't have hope you can't have faith never give it up you know well I'm lost and I can't be saved never never amen never I can't be bride never don't ever give that up because it's not based on your righteousness just like in Samson's life it wasn't based as righteousness don't you know the Bible said that he was a Nazarite even unto his death w somebody help me here but what happened to all of the sin and he did in between huh God saw him as a Nazarite from the beginning to the end amen and he messed up tremendously but you know what is amazing that God never emphasizes that part he tells us how great Samson was am and that's the story this is what I want you to see you're young you may make mistakes you come up short you know the point is if the Lord has Justified you you're Justified as though you've never sin in the first place God can never take his blessings away from you you understand me I'm not trying to tell you just go out and be like Samson Solomon said listen I done tried everything under the under the sun everything and every time I hear that I think oh my God keep my mind straight Lord because he said everything and he said at the end of the day I'm going to give you the right solution fear God and keep his Commandments in other words I have been an example let my life be an example for you you'll never find peace nowhere else that's right other than in God I trust that you have eyes to see that your living is not in vain don't let your youth go to waste do something with God and for God y'all understand me I don't care if all of the old people still come to church late you come you come on time and that's what I told him I was I was a little late this morning you know what I mean and I'm thinking the church is already in session there was no angel singing nothing I come in and everybody else come in after me there was just a few people and just like I told them this morning I told him these you know I didn't say it in this manner but this what I intended to say if these congales people came in early they test testify against you there's a group came in early they were there waiting they testify against you and like I did tell them this I said you know what we punch the clock we go to work and we go there 15 minutes early hoping we get a little extra time overtime and then when we come to God we drag in and I told him I said now I'm going to show you and I'm telling y'all too you can always tell which court you're in if you're in the outer Court you're still a Christian but that means whatever change is come in your life you going to sway with it happy today sad tomorrow down up and down that's where you are you're not even Sanctified yet you understand me in the inner Court right because in the Inc Court you passed through that already but you hear in the Inc court but understand you still can have mood swings cuz if you let those lights goes out the Bible said if one of those characteristics are not in you you're blind and you don't even know you've been saved hello y'all hear what I'm saying but that's not your goal you want to get into the holies of holies amen where the eternal life is where the the union of of God and man is where God brings the light God brings the changes all you do is lay there and let him bring the changes that's where we want to be don't stop till you get there I don't care if everybody else go out partying doing whatever they want to people of God be an individual when it comes to this thank God for the message but be an individual be determined to make it amen to to to to because you can see I haven't crossed a finish line yet and just like I told the Lord and I've told him many times I I've not I'll never be satisfied until I see the full Christ Living in me amen not a portion because all that was in Christ he P poured it into his bride those virtues those identifications those those uh characteristics are supposed to live that is the divine nature I'll not be satisfied that that is completely sealed away in my soul yes h on display well I got blood on the door post and Len where is it I don't see it it has to be something that is visible to the naked eye that's right right let's stand I
