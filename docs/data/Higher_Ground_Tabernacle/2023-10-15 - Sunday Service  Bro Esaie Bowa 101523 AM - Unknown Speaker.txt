it's a long scripture before reading the word we're going to Bow our head and pray uh dear Lord Our Father we humbly come before you as Reverend as we can with our heads bowed down in your presence uh

Assurance each one of us we commit ourselves to you in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen we're going to read the first verse now came to pass in the days of ayus this is ayus which reigned from India even onto Ethiopia over 107 and 20 provinces that in those days when the king assus sat on the throne of his kingdom which was the palace in the third year of his Reign he made a feast unto all the princes and and his servants the power of Persia and media the Nobles and princes of the provinces being before himid when he showed the riches of his glorious Kingdom and the honor of his Excellence Majesty many days even 104 score days that means six months and when these days were expired the king made a feast unto all the people that were present in shushan and the palace both unto Great and Small seven days in the courts of the garden of the king's Palace the nth verse also V the queen Made A Feast for the women um where am I for the women in the Royal house which belonged to King assus Haron z [Music] z on the seventh day when the heart of the King was married with wine he commanded meuman bista harbona Bika and ab abaka ziar and carcass the seven chamberlains that served in the presence of aarius the king to bring V to the queen before the king with the Crown Royal to show the people and the princes her beauty for she was fair to look up but the queeni refused to come at the king's commandment by his chamberlains therefore was the king very wroth and his anger burned in him you may have your seat then King said to the wise men which knew the times for so was the king's manner towards all the new law and judgment and and the next unto him was K Shor adata tares mares marcena and mimen the Seven princes of Persia and media which saw the king's face and which set the first in the Kingdom what shall we do unto the queen vasti according to the law because she had not performed the Commandment of the King aarius by the chamberlains this was a question that the King was asking to the seven chamberlains to see what they can apply to the queen VY and mic was one of the seven that answered and he said and Micon answered before the king and the princes Vash the queen ha not done wrong to the king only but also to all the princes and to all the people that are in all the provinces of the king assar for this deed of the queen shall come abroad onto all women so that they shall despise their husband in their eyes when it shall be reported the king assus commanded vashti the queen to be brought in before him but she came not princess [Music] likewise shall the ladies of Persia and media say this day unto all the kings princes which have heard of the deed of the queen thus shall there arise too much contempt and wrath so um all the women were going to to this SP their husband just like V did and if he please the king King Let Let There Go a royal commandment from him and let it be written among the laws of Persians and the Midas that it be not altered the vashi come not before King aaras and let the King give her royal give her Royal Estates unto another that is better than she and when the king's decree uh decree which he shall make uh which he shall make shall be published throughout all his Empire for it is great all the wives that all the wives shall give to their husband honor both to Great and Small and the saying pleased the king and the princes and the King did according to the word of micin for he sent letters into all the kings provinces into every Province according to the writing thereof and to every people after their language that every man should bear rule in his own house and that it should be published according to the language of every people may the Lord bless the reading of his word we're going to try to talk this morning about uh the behavior of the queen vas it's a message that I preach in Iowa City and I started preaching on it three weeks ago the first time uh I preach about the conduct or behavior of Queen Vash which took us about two Sundays and the last Sundays was Esther with a royal crown this morning I thought I could speak about Queen to Queen Esther but because there's so many things to say I don't think uh it can be said in one day that's why I'm going back to the uh behavior of Queen vasy we'll see what did and what made her lose her place as a queen next to the king it's not in vain that I took my time to read all this it was so that even if I'm not able to say anything but like you can already read it from the word and you can read it at home too if I could say one thing that you don't you disagree with just think of it as ignorance for me just say the preacher doesn't know anything but if I say something that is in the word take it and put it in your heart and say thank you for telling you something according to his word something that can help you we are all here to be helped and I standing here I'm the person that most need uh that needs the most help especially in this moment I really need the help of the Holy GH so that I may say what God want me to say because if I say something that just comes from myself it's going to create trouble it's not going to be received by that's why I really need the help of the Holy Ghost so that he may use my mouth so that he may speak the way he wants things to be said so brothers and sisters I'm going to talk about queen as we read here was this beautiful queen that the king l because the Bible says that V was fair to look on and the King assus was rich and his kingdom was from India to Ethiopia and he had around 127 and each province was led by a prince or a governor and King assus gathered all the princes in the capital and the Bible says he started showing them his riches for as he gathered them inan he offered a big feast and in that F was showing them how rich he was we read here that he showed them his riches for for 180 days I believe on the earth there's not a person that can show off his riches for 180 days this King was the most Parish in in in the in the and in that time that he gathered with all the princes and he was married with wine he thought to invite the queen this beautiful woman that he he thought he had the honor to present to present her in front of the he sent seven chamberlains they had the power to announce the message of the king to the queen and when the seven chamberlains got to Queen B they say the king needs you he wants you to appear before because he want to present you to his guest but Queen vas refused to go and she said tell him I'm not coming and and queen Vash refused to appear in front of the king which means she she humiliated she disobeyed to her husband which shows that the the King was humili he became without value and he upsets the king that he gathered all the princes and ask them what law shall we apply to the queen embarrassing the king which law are we going to apply to so among those seven princes that were with the king the Bible says there was a seventh one called M and when I read how many letters makes the name of I found that it was seven letters and you see it was seven prin and M was the seventh one and I understood that here there is nothing else but just the seventh messenger of the age because his name has seven letters and only him had the courage to speak in front of the king and to tell the king this he said King what queen V did is just unacceptable because what she did not only did it to you but she Al also did it to all the prin all the people gathered here she disrespected all of us so because of that you the king have to write a decree you have to write a letter in which you must say que V will never appear before the king because of her Disobedience because of the embarrassment she made you go through today and now you will send these letters to all the provinces in your king because what she did not only she did it to you but she also did it to all of us and us the princes we also have our wives when our wives will learn what the que when they know that the king called and the queen did not come it's going to bring this spice uh and uh anger everywhere the act of the queen it's just unacceptable so you the king you have to write and send it to all the Prov and in that letter you must say that every man got to be the master in his house and not only will he be the master in his he will also speak the language of his people because if you're a master in your house but you do not speak the language of your people how will people know that you were master in your own house you have to speak the language of your so that when your people come to you and that you give an order and they will hear that the man gave order so you must speak the language of your people they must understand that you gave an order and we'll see what the mother will do and if she doesn't do it we just know that the man is not master own house it's in the [Music] Bible we're still in the Bible every man had to be a master in his own house that was sufficient to just stop there but M the seventh one he said not only shall he be a master but must also speak the language of his people so that when the people come to visit you you're not speaking in a language like in codes that they do not understand but you say I want you to do this and the people are in the living room they can hear what you say so it shouldn't be that when the people are there you start speaking in a language that they do not understand so that when you give an order and that order has not applied so you got to be a master in your own house and speak the language of your people you say do this and the people are there hear what you say the order has been given now they they're waiting and they they checking to see if the order will be executed if the order is not executed they will say that the man is not master in his own house that's in the Bible that's in the Bible he represented the seventh messenger he told the king that the king had to send all the letters uh to REM remove queen V from her function as a queen I think V where she where she was having that Feast with all those other women I can imagine was there in the feast with all women and when the message got to her that the king needs you I can imagine another woman who's telling her why would the king need you why can he not just be happy with the man over there why why is he calling you now no just go tell them that you're not coming and the queen also answered as the other woman told her and the message got to the king and when the king got the message that the queen refused now Mican is telling the king to uh uh um expulse to to remove the the wife because of Disobedience and the the king doesn't know what to do and he says what the but she also did it to us not just us but also to all the people that because what example has the queen given because our wives who are prin uh they will hear what the queen they will also despise their husband and then you'll just be despised so to stop it you have to send letters that the queen V is no longer Queen I can imagine the queen when the news got to her she started telling her friends you see what we you got me into now now I've been U uh uh uh that this is why especially to our s you have to pay attention to what kind of friends you have and what advice is they're giving because you may you can regret later something may happen to you and you start regretting so you must also know that each man that you're seeing here he always have that one person that he Leen to the most he always have that one person and the advice of that person will always find its place in your husband let's say things clearly because I just read that in the Bible there will always be a mamin somewhere who will force your husband to apply something on you and you're going to start regretting but but I'm going to speak as I said of the behavior of the queen vas because the prophet says this that a woman in the Bible she typifies the church and this morning we're going to uh emphasize on women the behavior of women because the prophet said if you want to know the level of a church look how the women of that church behave brother could have said look how the men in that church carry themselves but he did not say that he said look how the women car themselves the church and that shows you the spiritual level that the church has and to have a more Spiritual Church you need to hit harder on the women's side that's why this morning my precious sisters don't say that the brothers corrupted me no they did not corrupt that's what the prophet said to have a spiritual church you got to hit hard on the women's side because the woman has power and we live in a world where the woman is worshiped the woman has more power in this country than the man has yes brothers and sisters why do we have to insist on the women's side because the prophet because the woman was the first being to be dece by the serpent he wasn't man she was the first one and when she had she was deceived from that time from that time the woman listens more to the serpent than her hband the woman listens more to the serpent than God and the serpent is closer to the woman than God is to the woman it's very hard what is it hard I'm going to say things today in a way that I've never said before even if it hurts understand I'm not going to try to cause harm to anybody but I want the church to be more spirit true so every time in the Bible where it's written about a woman the prophet tells us that he types the woman at the church so the woman was deceived by the serpent so she brought the same deception uh the same husband and we know everything that happened there's always one thing that I noticed as I told you that since the woman was deceived by the serpent she stayed closer to the serpent then she is to God and she listens more to the ser Serpent and the serpent made her so beautiful especially in this an all the Cosmetic products we have in the market the serpant really made the woman fair and it's where the prophet of God says that beauty comes from the devil uh can our sisters say Amen uh beauty comes from the devil isn't it it's brother Bram that says it let me read it in questions and answers number one he says this in 64 you know in every life there is the male is the prettiest but the human race take any bird any cow take a bunch of cattle which is the prettiest the old crumpled horn cow or the big it's the uh uh uh bull that's uh prettiest take a deer which is the Little D or the buck it's the male that's prettiest take a bunch of elk which is the prettiest the male or the female so in all the animal species is the male which is the prettiest uh you see uh take the bird or the pretty Cardinal or the Little Speckled hand sit on her nest he said the male is the prettiest but the female to the human she caused the fall the female Satan chose her right there and beauty is of the devil can we say Amen since the fall of the woman she stayed closer to Satan she listens more to Satan despite the thought that comes to her spirit she's always ready to execute it that's why the prophet says a woman does not have discernment but the discernment has been given to the man because everything that comes to the spirit of a woman she has always had the desire to execute it without making it Go by the filter of the word so she has stayed closer to Satan she listens to Satan more even more than her husband oh you know a woman as we read uh types to church so when we take the natural image we go with it to the spiritual the church in the spiritual listens more to Satan than she listens to God and each thought that goes through she's always ready to execute it so beauty is of the devil the devil has fill the spirit of to want to be satisfied with beauty a woman always want to be beautiful brother I know it's it's natural for a woman to want to be pretty but the devil feeds the spirit of the woman with with the disatisfaction of beauty and when there's a spirit like it when there's a spirit like it it's the devil listen to this so today the woman is always ready to copy everything everything she sees everything she sees on TV everything she sees on TV or on the Internet she's always ready to copy that she has models that she want to copy no the only model that we have we find it in the word of we find it in the message that is our model we do not have models of stars as our models uh no my brothers and sisters already warned you here my sisters forgive me because you're going to get out here thinking that today I only spoke about women sisters sisters sisters as if they corrupted me with money on the pocket in my pocket no as we read here as we heard here the leadership or the behavior of is the same thing for the church and if our women here behave any certain any ways the image that they that's the image of this church so we have to pay attention because we need a church that is very spiritual a church where the spirit of God can speak and our women are uh paying attention and ready to hear the message of God so now brothers and sisters as I said my sisters forgive me don't have a bad of me but I'm going to make sure to repeat what the prophet said so that if you have anything if you have anything to solve you will have to do it with Brother by me you wash me with water you'll say that he doesn't have a problem the problem the person that has a problem me the seventh he's the problem me I'm nothing it's that seven who CA that the queen V be expelled so brother Bram and of course I know woman wants to look pretty that's nature that's what it should be and he also says don't look like the world and he says in question and answers number three paragraph 188 he said and of course I know women wants to look pretty that's nature that's what they should be each woman should be pretty they should be that way so that's fine so otherwise like this don't look like the world see don't pattern after to the world things wrong you want to cut off your hair but don't cut your hair now if you got braids hanging down or whatever it is in your hair you leave it long don't cut it don't cut it to look like the world so the prophet is saying here it's natur it's natural for a woman to we're not refusing it but only when your beauty when you do your beauty do not copy the world uh do not try to look like the Kardashian do not try to look like Beyonce no do not look like them do not try to copy them do not look like the world so V was this queen that was beloved so the king wanted to show but because of her Disobedience she was expelled and she was replaced she was supposed to show a good an example of submission an example of respect because she was the first first woman of the she was supposed to be an example but she fail to do she gave a bad example mic seeing this he projected it in future years and he said he acts that the queen if the king doesn't put a law our women will uh turn against us uh men will be like papers in their house so to stop it you the king you must write a decree in which you must say each man must be a master in his house that he must speak the language of his people yes Disobedience of V caused her to be expelled today the church is supposed to be obedient to Christ they supposed to be obedient to God to respect the word of God to practice the word every point every principle every commandment the church is supposed to follow the word to align with the word to receive everything she needs of the and our King is the king of kings is the C his name is Jesus Christ and we must obey him in everything so the seventh messenger he said and the King sent letters and the queen was expelled as I told you we take the image of natural things to apply this to the spiritual so the prophet says in question and answers in Hebrews preaching 19 57 he says in paragraph 71 781 he said listen here the man is the ruler don't you he's talking about sisters don't you think you you will rule the house the man is the ruler don't you think you will rule rule the house you are not the ruler of the house you are not a slave but you are a helpmate and the man has the rule over his wife and he's responsible Solly for his wife God makes the man answer for his he must answer for his wife now you see read and see if God says that now the only responsible person woman when she's married it's her husband it's to him that God is going to ask when a woman is married she stops being under the rulership of her parents God is not going to ask to he's going to ask her husband can we say Amen it's brother Bram who say so God wants every man to be the ruler of his house he has the last word the absolute of his house he does not share his power with someone else and the woman shouldn't be on a horse in between she shouldn't be in between in between the leadership of her parents and her husband once she is married oh now when he says that oh brother Eugene is sitting there he knows the word he knows the consequences that come after because I know that's what is going in our minds right now is this uh uh something to H he knows the word now we must say things as they are if we don't say it our children who are growing up or that CH who's there they're living here in the us know who is going to show them if the word doesn't teach them we living in a state or a country where the woman has more power than the man which makes it as man is like a piece of paper no our daughters must know that when she is a married woman she depends on husband and her husband is the first ruler he has the last word on her as long as she's a married woman so the man rules over he is the only responsible for his wife and God makes the man answer for he must answer for his wife so you cannot share powers between the parents of the woman and the husband many times in uh that there was fight in between there were always trouble there were always problems why it's either because the parents the parents did not understand that their their their responsibility ended when the guy married the the daughter no the daughter the daughter will remain your daughter until death until your death she's your daughter but as long as she's a married she must be submissive to her husband because if she becomes disob and Disobedience it's going to cause her to be expelled it's in the word there's not such a bad thing as a woman who disobeys her husband and here the the queen V ex she gave a bad example let's say this if she even did it in secret between her and her husband we could have understood because in law we always say there are certain situations by the mistake that she made was to disrespect in public it's the worst thing that a woman can do and she was expelled because of that now she was there regretting she could have start uh uh blaming her friends and now see what you made me do now she could have gone ask the go ask the king I didn't know what happened to me I didn't know it wasn't me it was my friend who no the law was already and it was finished because in the beginning of chapter two it says the king let me just read the beginning of chapter two of Esther you'll see that the king started to feel sorry for vast but the law that he already wrote was not giving him access to get V back anymore let's read CH to after these things when the wrath of King assus was appeased he remembered and what she had done and what was decreed against her so he said oh I could get her back but the law decree because mamic was the wise man the seventh messenger who is against the spirit of women he doesn't play with women he made the the king that was not giving the king access to get basty back so the King was caught in his own trap you see now the king could start start saying oh if you had done this between us but you made the wrong thing by doing it publicly now you see I can't even get you back anymore so there are there are certain things that you can do between you and your husband that can be okay but there are certain things that you do not do in public because when you do it in public you're giving a bad image of yourself and what you don't know is that in each family in each house there there's always problems you do not want your problems to be known of everybody am and now I'm going to read what the prophet says concerning V the of the Lamb uh the marriage of the Lamb okay okay let me say this now I didn't say this to play but I said it in Parable so that you may understand it's exact what you older Christians are doing for these younger exactly right you're supposed to be examples you older Christians so you're supposed to be examples you Pentecostals that profess to have the Holy Ghost you are to be an example for the Methodist and Baptist and Presbyterians not like the first lady but like Jesus You're supposed to be he tells you in here what to do how to do it we must follow his rules and his examples but that's the way we find find it so after this queen he he's talking about vast he says this queen she wouldn't listen she wouldn't come she humiliated him and say if this first lady of the land set an example like that all the rest of the women will do it so then when a man calls for his wife she'll say go jump in the river he really for told about America he so what mic made the king say the prophet is saying as if he was for telling about America now we found out that in doing so then there was a man that had some wisdom about him and he said that's what you must to expel her and to send the message to all the nations and to pick all the young virgins that all the young virgins and that you may find a wife among them and he pleased the king so the condition that was in that time God was already seeing the spirits that was going to be on the earth and how women would treat their husband how women will be in the end times and what mimic made the king was as a prediction what women will do in the US today and to stop it he had to excommunicate her and you know that Israel has done the same thing to Jesus when Jesus came for them they were the elected people of God they were the Bride of Jesus but they rejected they killed him and Jesus exom he turned to the Nations and he picked a queen among the nation and we are that queen that took the place of Israel now my brothers and things that happened in the Old Testament where the image of things that should happen today God is looking an obedient woman an obedient Church in every principle in every every do of the Bible God needs women and men obedient to God who respect every word of God Amen let's go back to the Old Testament because we're talking respect every principle in the Old Testament we have this man that we call Joseph brother forgive me I'm not saying this to talk about you by yourself you will understand that it's not about you it's about it's not by coincidence Co and if you see the the tape from Iowa City I also say the same thing Joseph was the the type obedient of belie he was the image of a Believer obedient to God in every principle so that when he found himself in Egypt and when the wife of Pier wanted to sleep with Joseph Joseph refus he refused those things from that woman and what did he do he ran away and now us today it's not even that we are tempted but now it's we are going to go tempt those women because if it was that you got tempted we will understand but it's not that we are but we're even going to go tempt them but God needs a church obedience in every principle in every point of the word or thought of the word or period how can you how can you want God to a people that does not obey his word the bible say that God when he promises one thing that thing must be fulfilled God is obligated to word but where is the Fulfillment of the word of God in our lives because God needs an obedient church and vas she's the type of the disobedient she was excommunicated the source of was cut off she found herself she was just other women and the royal king or the Royal Crown was taken from her God needs men and obedient to his word in every principle what is God going to say church that does not apply the principles of the word God needs men and women my brothers obedient because the Bible say obedience is worth more than sacrifice I'm going to try to get done in the next 20 minutes bear with me bear with me the prophet says in this message questions and answer 1961 I don't why I I studied a lot of questions and answers so if you have a question the answer is also there if you're asking yourself what you must do the answer is here uh my brothers and sisters you even hear that a man a woman beats her husband oh she slapped her husband in the name of the freedom in the US oh she slapped her husband and then the the police even put a restraint um on on the that man and that woman she walks with all uh no no no our sons and our children shouldn't do something like that the prophet says beginning what did I say when you see when you see anything Miles when you see a car uh getting uh down the road 90 M an hour get out of his way that's right when you see the first twist in anything get away from it stay away from it that's the ground you should not be on Satan will present something Satan will present something to you that will wreck your soul stay away from it sh the the very appearance of evil be a man be a woman I'm going to take up for the women for a minute he says that he says that's unusual I never do it but I'll he said I'm going to take up for the women a minutes that's unusual isn't it they say oh the woman oh it was the woman's fault and brother say if she hadn't gone out of her place well the man wouldn't go go got out of his that's true we'll say that's right she get out of her place and the prophet says a man can be bad a man cannot be bad L there is a bad woman but remember they cannot be a bad woman without being a bad man amen you oh she she she did she caused it she caus it yeah it's right but the prophet also took up for the women and a woman cannot do something wrong like vice versa if a man cannot do anything wrong if the woman and you who claim to be a Son of God where are your principles even if the woman is not out of her place aren't you a Son of God aren't you the one that's higher stronger vessel as the Bible says she's weaker then if she's weaker then show yourself a man of God a man cannot act bad if the woman didn't act bad in the first place same thing for the woman now my brothers and sisters as I as I said I'm skipping a few things so that we may go to the end so we need an obedient Church Church a a respectful Church brother says in marriage and divorce I'm not preaching marriage and divorce here I'm not telling the brothers to go excommunicate their wi it's not what is in my thoughts but my my thought is to have an Obed Church and for us to have an obedient church we taking the image of what our wives are because if you want to have a spiritual church let's see how what our wives are that's what's going to show us the exact place of what the church is in the prophet says in marriage and divorce in paragraph 243 he says this but to get this marriage and divorce straightened out so that you would know which was right and which was wrong now he plainly shows it here in This Ti there is one Christ and many members of the wife he he can put us away for Spiritual fornications and false do any time he wants to but how dare you try to put him away and make it he said the man can put away his wife and marry another one but the woman the woman put away her husand and but the woman cannot put away her husband she doesn't have that right because it breaks all thep a woman cannot refuse her husband just like the church cannot uh refuse but Christ the husb of the church has the power to Exel the church exactly how the man has the power to put away his wife I know what I'm talking about I'm not telling people to go put away their wives because there are conditions to do it you don't just wake up in the morning and just say I put her away no you cannot say you got to ask the p and he will tell you what God helped him to understand and he will tell you his position and how he and if you're right he'll tell you you are right if he also understands things the same way you do because this is not my church I'm not the pastor of this church the pastor of this church is brother but because we're talking about Disobedience of vas which uh to be put so a church that does not obey the word she will also be because Christ is the spiritual husband of the church so your s examine your own conscience and look for every principle of look every are you obedient to every principle of the word if you're not Obed God God is going to put you away the power and the to put you away but you cannot put him away you said a man can put away his but the woman cannot pull her husand and marry another one see all see all the shadows and types they are perfectly balanced see the original creation not the byproduct no where not the church the brides through the word not the woman the man each time that's why it never says anything against the man doing it it's always the woman that's exactly my brothers and sister I'm going to close by saying this so that we must understand that what motivated my spirit to speak about it I got inspired by the life of queen as we you heard it was very plain that even the little kids understood what he was talking that the Disobedience of her wife she was the first wife her Disobedience caused her to be put away while she was supposed to show a again said a good example she said a bad example and she was rejected and the King had to of another person where to take the place of and have the Royal Crown God also today he needs Believers and Christians Obed who when God needs them when God tells them to do this thing or that they do it with a good heart they do it with all their heart God needs that type of a Christian of a Believer a Believer my brothers and sister we may stand let's examine our conscience where we have not been Obed that we may ask God this morning Lord God I know I have not been Obed I have not obeyed the whole word I need you to forgive me I need you to have mercy on me to give me another chance so that I may go for you again that I may have another chance to do the word because I want to be in Obed I want to be an obedi wife I want to be an obedient husband that's what we need oh we're going to sing a song we can sing Love Lifted Me you can come sing and um I will pray at the end I was Sinking Deep in sin far from the peaceful Shore very deeply stained with sin sinking to sise no more but the master of the sea heard my despairing cry from the waters Lifted Me Now save my love lied me oh loveely lifted me when nothing else could have love LIF in me oh Love Lifted Me his Love Lifted me where and nothing else could

Love Lifted Me when nothing else could have loveely me yes Love Lifted Me Oh Love Lifted Me when nothing else could help Love Lifted Me Oh Jesus lifted me yes Jesus lifted me when no one else could have Jesus lifted me yes Jesus Lifted Me Oh Jes Jesus lifted me when no one else could help Jesus lifted me let's pray each one of us each one of us let's pray all of us according to what you heard let's pray J h we we're going to pray dear heavenly father with so much respect and reverently coming before you after hearing this message where you showed us that you need an obedient Church in obedient church that observes every principle every commandment of your word Lord when we examine our conscience we cannot say that we do not have sin because if we say that we do not have SE then we are liars and your word says that let every man's word be a lie only the word of God can be recognized is the truth dear merciful father even as small as the sin no matter how small the sin that we committed but there's still one scene and you do not need a church that continuously seen and seen you need an obedient church because when the church is obedient then shees all the blessings of God she has all the redemp Redemptive blessings each moment she's going to cry to you in her difficulty because she's an obedient Church you will hear that that prayer because you said in your word that if my people who are called by my name get together and they pray me God I will answer from Heaven Lord here we are a church certainly we have needs we have difficulties so how can you respond us if you say that we're not obedient so our prayer this morning forgive us for our that you forgive our shortcomings that you forgive our transgressions align according to your word that we may become Spirit of your spirit word of your word we may observe every commandment of your word oh Heavenly Father our prayer this morning is that when we look at past when we look at our history there are certainly things that we certainly bad things but your spirit this morning want us to be in obedient Church forgive our past Lord and help us to have a future to to future so so that we may be this church that does not have limits in your so that we but in order for us to get there we need to be obedient so forgive each one of us we commit ourselves to we give you our hearts when we can think about this nation it's a nation that you chose yourself when they were with you at the beginning when you were their absolute they had their Bible as the contition the US was a powerful na they had a victory in everything but since they rejected God why we seeing all these things happening Heavenly mer we see seen in every corner of the street we see the respects that disappeared the word of God is no longer considered heavenly father but as long as you have a BRI you want the bride to be OB want the bride to be you want the brides to work after the Commandment of your word so bless each one
