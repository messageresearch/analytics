[0:00] you love the Lord we're not going to
[0:02] sing we're just going to go right into
[0:03] the word of
[0:05] God what a mighty God we serve amen glad
[0:08] to see you brother
[0:10] Marcus amen
[0:12] amen uh we're going to be coming from uh
[0:15] a couple of
[0:18] scriptures first of all let's go to
[0:20] Romans 4 and
[0:22] 20 Romans 4 and
[0:28] 20
[0:30] oh my I am I
[0:33] am glad I'm one of
[0:36] them that's all I can say words cannot
[0:40] even
[0:41] express uh what I'm feeling right now
[0:43] here you go
[0:45] brother thank you sir yes sir yes sir
[0:50] amen I I I'm I'm I'm I'm thrilled I'm
[0:56] happy and uh I feel super amen
[1:00] Hallelujah that's my new word
[1:02] super so not just good I feel super amen
[1:07] Romans
[1:10] 4:20 we know who he's speaking of here
[1:14] he staggered not at the promise of God
[1:18] through
[1:19] unbelief but was strong in
[1:22] faith giving glory to God Amen and being
[1:27] fully
[1:28] persuaded that what he had promised he
[1:32] was able also to
[1:35] perform and therefore it was imputed to
[1:38] him for
[1:39] righteousness now it was not written for
[1:44] his sake
[1:45] alone that it was imputed to him but was
[1:49] for us also to whom it shall be imputed
[1:54] if we believe on him that raised up
[1:57] Jesus our lord from the dead amen who
[2:01] was delivered for for our offenes and
[2:06] was arised again for our justification
[2:11] amen I love that I love that first John
[2:28] 54
[2:30] 1 John
[2:32] 5:4 for whatsoever is born of God
[2:37] overcometh the
[2:38] world and this is the victory that
[2:41] overcometh the world even our
[2:45] faith let us pray Heavenly Father God we
[2:49] come before you Lord as humbly as we
[2:51] know how thanking you father for being
[2:54] so good to us you've been better to us
[2:57] Lord Jesus than we have been been to
[3:00] ourselves we thank you Father for your
[3:04] righteousness your Holiness and we thank
[3:07] you Father for all you have done for us
[3:10] bless this service in a special way and
[3:13] we'll be careful to give you the praise
[3:14] Glory and Honor in Jesus Christ's name
[3:17] we pray amen you may be
[3:24] seated if I want to if I was to uh uh um
[3:29] entitled this message I would uh entitle
[3:32] it no place for
[3:38] reasoning how many of us really believe
[3:41] that uh brother brandom is uh Malachi
[3:45] 4 amen and how many of you believe that
[3:49] God spoke through the
[3:50] man I know this seems like simple
[3:53] questions but then you'll find out why
[3:55] I'm asking you things these questions in
[3:58] just a moment
[4:00] because we realize amen
[4:02] that we are
[4:05] resting upon brother brandham and what
[4:08] he taught
[4:10] us y'all understand what I'm saying when
[4:13] brother bham had that vision of going
[4:15] over uh beyond the curtain of time he
[4:19] said there were Millions upon
[4:22] Millions uh who screamed out after he
[4:25] said well I preached what Paul preached
[4:30] amen and they said we are resting on
[4:34] that now they didn't say we are
[4:38] hoping but they were there
[4:41] resting because they
[4:44] believe what he
[4:46] preached they wouldn't have been
[4:49] there in other words they were saying
[4:52] absolutely You Preach what Paul preached
[4:56] and that's the reason why we're resting
[4:58] amen
[5:01] see it wasn't a hope
[5:04] situation but it was but what they were
[5:06] doing was
[5:07] amening uh what he has
[5:10] said and I can say Amen
[5:14] too now the reason why I'm saying this
[5:17] because if I was to have a theme it
[5:20] would be wisdom versus Faith that's
[5:23] where I got the bulk of my
[5:25] message because I realized amen that if
[5:27] we're going to make a rapture
[5:30] we must take God at his
[5:33] word we can't add to it we can't take
[5:35] away we can't reason with it it is what
[5:38] it is now you see what brother what are
[5:40] you saying I'm saying until you really
[5:44] get a true revelation of what a prophet
[5:47] is you will never have the
[5:50] respect for the word of God in which he
[5:54] preached because amen you're going to
[5:57] look at them at at him as though it was
[6:00] a man speaking to you but you and I
[6:04] realized by Revelation it wasn't a man
[6:07] amen even though God it was a man
[6:10] physically a
[6:11] tabernacle brother brandham wasn't smart
[6:16] enough to bring us such a
[6:18] message and he would have told you that
[6:21] himself that's why God Amen chose a man
[6:25] who had just a seventh grade
[6:27] education to bring the message of God to
[6:31] us now you say why is it so important
[6:35] you'll find out in just a moment because
[6:38] if God sent us a message if we add to it
[6:41] we in trouble if we take away from it
[6:45] we're in trouble amen amen hello
[6:49] somebody now you're not going to see me
[6:52] up here uh uh acting like a
[6:55] parrot cuz I only preach those things
[6:58] that I has been revealed to to me but I
[7:01] want you to make sure that what I'm
[7:03] preaching comes from what he preached
[7:06] y'all hear what I'm saying so I want you
[7:08] to understand that here the Bible said
[7:11] that Abraham stared not at the promise
[7:13] of
[7:15] God through unbelief in the in other
[7:19] words there was no sin that he
[7:22] disbelieve God now Abraham did some
[7:25] natural things that took him out of the
[7:29] way way right places when God said don't
[7:32] go he
[7:34] went anyhow because of his natural man
[7:38] but when it came to really believing the
[7:40] promises of God the Bible said he he
[7:42] never
[7:44] staggered
[7:46] now God
[7:48] knows how to work his plan out in each
[7:51] and every one of our lives but I want to
[7:54] say tonight there's no place for
[7:57] reasoning and the reason why I can say
[7:59] that is because throughout
[8:02] my time period in this message I found
[8:06] myself
[8:08] reasoning every last one of us have done
[8:10] it only because we did not understand
[8:13] who was
[8:15] preaching oh come on
[8:17] somebody it's true and every time we
[8:21] reason with the prophet's message or
[8:23] with God's message through the prophet
[8:25] we find ourself in
[8:28] trouble come on come on come on now let
[8:31] me say it like this so you
[8:33] understand reasoning the kind I'm
[8:36] talking about is of the
[8:39] devil right because that was the first
[8:42] thing he did when it came to Eve he made
[8:46] her reason with the
[8:49] word as if the word was not plain
[8:55] enough and God brought us a plain word
[8:59] am he had to bring us a plain word
[9:03] because Isaiah said that there will be a
[9:05] way a way in a
[9:07] way and said it would be so simple the
[9:11] fol wouldn't air so God had to make it
[9:14] so simple that even the unlearned could
[9:18] understand what he was saying it is the
[9:22] intellectuals that makes us
[9:25] reason
[9:27] amen they want to and the way it was in
[9:30] in Noah's day with uh Moses day excuse
[9:32] me with daythan and cor you always have
[9:34] somebody who's going to try to interpret
[9:37] to us what the prophet meant and
[9:41] said come on now y'all y'all follow me
[9:44] just a minute because I really want you
[9:46] to understand that you and I must begin
[9:49] to take a different mental attitude
[9:52] toward what we're hearing and what we
[9:55] are reading otherwise you're going to
[9:57] find yourself
[9:59] [Music]
[10:01] reasoning with the things that you hear
[10:04] hello somebody oh it's true that's why
[10:07] the the what we call the message or the
[10:10] the the the the realm of the message
[10:11] that's why so many people don't have the
[10:13] Holy Ghost because they found themselves
[10:16] reasoning Amen brother made it plain and
[10:19] clear it's not difficult it's only when
[10:23] we begin to
[10:25] reason whether we have to go the
[10:28] measure that has been laid out for
[10:32] us right
[10:35] listen after the seals were open brother
[10:38] B preached the token he said that was
[10:39] the Capstone of his
[10:41] message hello he preached desperation
[10:45] and told you you got to get desperate to
[10:47] get it amen now you can reason within
[10:50] yourself but I believe the prophet was
[10:52] laid here brought here to open a
[10:55] entrance a way into and if if you fail
[10:59] to hear the voice listen because a lot
[11:03] of time people when when I say this we
[11:05] don't realize we're not listening to a
[11:07] man we're not listening on the tape to
[11:09] hear the sound of brother BR Brandon
[11:11] pitch and how high he go how low he go
[11:13] we're there to hear from God
[11:16] Amen and Jesus said my sheep heareth my
[11:19] voice and a stranger they will not
[11:23] follow
[11:25] amen wouldn't it be
[11:27] better to believe it like he
[11:31] said without trying to explain
[11:35] it because Revelation comes to those who
[11:39] can take it face
[11:42] value hello you got to take it face
[11:45] value before God can reveal it
[11:49] amen all you got to say is Lord I don't
[11:51] understand it and God says get all
[11:53] you're getting but get it with some
[11:55] understanding so you got a word to bring
[11:58] before God so he can give you
[12:00] understanding but if you don't believe
[12:01] in faith value oh that can't mean
[12:05] that just saying that put you in
[12:09] danger but to say Lord I don't
[12:12] understand that then you give God the
[12:15] space to bring Revelation into your
[12:19] heart hello
[12:21] somebody coming from the message wisdom
[12:23] versus faith and I'll be reading he says
[12:26] now if this is the word of God you
[12:29] believe it then why doubt any word of it
[12:34] any promise of it how can you say that
[12:37] this is part and this is no part and
[12:40] this is that pick out what you want you
[12:45] can't do it it's either all good or it's
[12:50] none of it good that's right so as soon
[12:53] as you see that it's it's the truth take
[12:56] a hold of it don't turn it loose
[12:59] no matter what
[13:00] circumstances how they try to reason
[13:04] don't do that at all stay right with it
[13:08] God promised it if I'm going now to take
[13:12] my stand for Christ he'll give me the
[13:15] Holy Spirit his Spirit Bears record of
[13:18] his life in me then when I come to die
[13:21] Satan's triy to say you see you didn't
[13:25] belong to an organization stay right
[13:27] with the word you didn't do this you
[13:29] didn't do that no matter what s Satan's
[13:32] got no reason about it it's God's word
[13:35] stay with the word see it cast down all
[13:39] reasoning amen so if we stay with the
[13:41] word we don't have to argue with
[13:44] Satan his reasoning makes no sense
[13:50] anyway I mean come on when you think
[13:52] about it if we take the word of God as
[13:55] God has laid it out come on somebody now
[13:58] I'm coming to something something
[13:59] because the word of God is Not of any
[14:01] private interpretation amen now it took
[14:04] me a long time to fully understand that
[14:07] but what it is I'll read it to you in
[14:08] just a moment brother brandom said God
[14:11] sends a prophet to interpret the word to
[14:14] you
[14:15] amen that means you don't have to worry
[14:18] about interpreting it it's already
[14:23] interpreted and if we don't follow the
[14:26] interpretation in which he brings we
[14:29] find our s reasoning and we find
[14:32] ourselves like Eve did falling short and
[14:36] finding
[14:39] death
[14:40] hello it is what it is I've done it I've
[14:43] I I've I've out of weaknesses out of out
[14:46] of feelings out of emotions out of
[14:49] caring out of but you know what it's
[14:52] like
[14:54] this each man is responsible because
[14:58] you're an eagle
[14:59] amen each one of you are responsible for
[15:03] coming to understand and knowing this
[15:05] word amen hello
[15:08] amen oh it's true anyhow you say you're
[15:11] an eagle now the Bible didn't say all
[15:15] pastors take that little book and eat
[15:18] it no John represented the bride amen
[15:23] and the bride supposed to have an
[15:25] appetite for the word
[15:27] amen
[15:29] amen huh God gave her an appetite for
[15:32] the word and he tells us to eat it can
[15:35] you imagine eating something and you're
[15:37] not hungry for
[15:39] it that's
[15:43] miserable right I can remember when I
[15:45] was a boy my babysitter used to make me
[15:47] eat Harmony grits I hated it yesterday
[15:52] to day in
[15:55] forever and it's like that you don't
[15:57] want to eat something that you're not
[15:59] hungry for but the Bride of Jesus Christ
[16:01] is
[16:02] hungry you know what she's hungry for
[16:05] her
[16:06] identity amen right that's what brother
[16:10] B said he said basically she was among
[16:12] the chickens she heard the eager scream
[16:15] all along she was confused about why she
[16:17] was so different from everybody else but
[16:20] then when she heard the word she heard
[16:23] the scream of the eagle it gave her a
[16:27] identity and one of the first things
[16:30] Mama eager told the baby eaglet
[16:34] fly you are not Earthbound and you got
[16:38] no business out there fellowshipping
[16:40] with the
[16:41] chickens y'all hear what I'm saying so a
[16:44] eagle supposed to know how to fly know
[16:47] how to catch the wind and know how to
[16:50] know what is thus sayeth the Lord
[16:57] amen you don't know know how blessed you
[16:59] are to be able to see that God sent a
[17:06] prophet if the people in Noah's day
[17:08] would have known who he really was it
[17:10] would have been an
[17:12] overload but they didn't recognize him
[17:15] they they didn't they failed to see that
[17:18] it was God behind that human flesh and
[17:21] guess what they didn't understand that
[17:26] that Noah was the voice of God to that
[17:30] generation come on somebody you don't
[17:33] think God knows what he says and you
[17:35] don't think he understand what he means
[17:38] when God says something that's what he
[17:39] said he can't turn back from his word
[17:41] cuz he's perfect
[17:46] amen there's a lot of Grace given to us
[17:49] but people if we ever go come to the
[17:52] place to change what he says to meet our
[17:57] convenience we are are in
[18:01] trouble is that all
[18:03] right now we're at a place let's turn to
[18:07] Ezra real quick because this this this
[18:10] message brings an anointing did y'all
[18:12] know
[18:12] that it brings an anointing and
[18:17] uh I had it it brings an anointing and
[18:21] you and I must understand that we
[18:24] supposed to be under that anointing
[18:27] right
[18:29] God just don't cause you to do something
[18:31] without giving you
[18:34] something I'm sorry Ezra 15
[18:41] please it says then rose up the CH and
[18:44] this is when God was getting ready to
[18:46] lay the foundation uh the king uh of
[18:49] Persia had already given them word that
[18:50] they can go and you know uh lay the
[18:53] foundation go back to Jerusalem build
[18:55] the thing up you know it got frustrated
[18:57] a many times but listen in the fifth
[18:59] verse it says then rose up the chief of
[19:01] the fathers of Judah and Benjamin and
[19:04] the priest and the Levites with all of
[19:06] them whose Spirit God had raised to go
[19:11] up to build the house of the Lord which
[19:14] is in Jerusalem God Anointed The People
[19:18] come on somebody now the pastor has no
[19:20] business trying to beg people among us
[19:23] beg you to do something for God there's
[19:25] supposed to be an anointing with you as
[19:28] it is with
[19:33] him right I don't think Luther had to
[19:37] beg nobody Wesley didn't have to beg
[19:39] anyone right those people heard the word
[19:43] they fell under that anointing and it
[19:45] was
[19:45] off nobody had to beg Pentecostals Amen
[19:49] to sible themselves listen it's the
[19:51] truth they fell under that anointing and
[19:53] they were off well we were in The Bride
[19:56] age amen this is supposed to be a super
[19:59] age amen where everything is super is
[20:02] that right he preached the message on
[20:04] super right and this is supposed to be a
[20:07] super
[20:08] age where's the
[20:12] Super it's here yes he God left it here
[20:17] amen but you must enter into
[20:20] it it doesn't matter whether it's just a
[20:23] small group of people it doesn't take
[20:26] but one man to get in the hand of God
[20:28] and he he becomes a giant
[20:31] slayer but what it is we are in an age
[20:33] of intellectuals and don't get me wrong
[20:35] I don't have nothing with nothing uh no
[20:38] problem with people who have who are
[20:40] intelligent and smart brother B and God
[20:43] is working with the people who allow
[20:45] their intellect to to to deny the
[20:47] word but it's a good thing to have a
[20:50] good
[20:51] memory anybody know what I'm talking
[20:53] about it's a good thing to be able to
[20:56] comprehend and recall you know and
[20:58] there's nothing wrong with that but the
[21:00] problem is sometimes people allow their
[21:03] human ability to to
[21:06] recall they mistaken it as the Holy
[21:09] Ghost
[21:11] amen and there's a lot of preachers like
[21:14] that hello somebody a lot of preachers
[21:18] are that way where they think because
[21:21] they can recall hello somebody I want
[21:23] you to understand the devil can recall
[21:25] too matter of fact brother brandham said
[21:27] that the devil
[21:28] believe the word says He believe he
[21:37] trembles come on somebody so what I'm
[21:40] working with here is so that you can
[21:43] understand that we are approaching a
[21:46] serious
[21:47] hour one word
[21:50] disbelief you missed the
[21:54] Rapture it was one word disbelief that
[21:57] plunged us into this mess amen one word
[22:01] disbelieve it plunges you it takes you
[22:04] out of the
[22:06] Rapture y'all hear what I'm saying
[22:09] amen so this is not a time for
[22:12] reasoning if we reason here we will
[22:15] reason
[22:17] there and this is Satan's
[22:20] wisdom
[22:23] reason now there's a reasoning of God
[22:26] come let us reason together
[22:28] [Laughter]
[22:31] though your sin be Scarlet I'll make
[22:33] them whiter than snow in other words in
[22:36] God's reasoning you benefit sir you come
[22:39] to understand God is right and you're
[22:41] wrong amen God is Holy and you filthy
[22:45] that was the
[22:46] reasoning to know who are you stand with
[22:50] God but it comes along says but I'll
[22:52] make you white as snow amen is that all
[22:56] right overcome the world what overcometh
[22:59] the world those who are born of God
[23:01] overcometh the world how by what faith
[23:05] and what is faith faith is
[23:08] revelation faith is revelation faith is
[23:11] understanding uh your day and his
[23:16] message this message came to do
[23:19] what prepare a people for a Rapture
[23:23] greater than that to prepare a people
[23:26] for a wedding
[23:28] greater than that to make sure those who
[23:31] are prepared for the wedding you get to
[23:35] marry right Hallelujah is that right
[23:38] Paul said I would love in the 11th
[23:40] chapter Corinthians I want to present
[23:42] you as a Chase version unto the Lord he
[23:45] said but I feel Les at some point in
[23:47] time you will allow Satan to seduce you
[23:50] or begal you even as he did unto Eve so
[23:54] you got to realize that same spirit is
[23:58] Among Us
[24:00] now
[24:02] right it doesn't take
[24:05] much it it it doesn't take much it's
[24:07] like like the Galatians
[24:10] did you know we still should have a
[24:15] circumcision that's all it takes
[24:17] circumcision used to be a part of the
[24:20] ordinances of of Israel and that's all
[24:22] we need to do uh you know we we need the
[24:25] circum no you don't Paul said he said by
[24:28] doing that you make the word of God a
[24:30] none of
[24:32] act think about all of the people Amen
[24:35] in this message who don't even believe
[24:37] in taking communion no
[24:39] more they don't take
[24:42] it because they said he's
[24:45] here well he was here ever since all the
[24:48] time right amen hallelujah he just made
[24:51] himself known in
[24:53] 1963 because some things were happening
[24:55] come on if he wasn't here Luther
[24:57] wouldn't have been able to do what he
[24:58] was doing W than none of them but in
[25:01] 1963 the full word came
[25:07] amen and they said well he's here and
[25:09] that's part of the perusia doctor which
[25:11] is okay he is here his presence is here
[25:14] but my point is this brother brandham
[25:17] still kept communion even up to his
[25:21] death so was he
[25:23] wrong but he was the one who knew he was
[25:25] here before anybody else did y'all hear
[25:28] what I'm saying but you see people get
[25:30] in listen just like I heard a brother
[25:32] say if you going to take away communion
[25:35] take away the tithing
[25:38] too right because when when MDC met amen
[25:43] uh uh Abraham Abraham had communion and
[25:48] he paid tithing so if you going to do
[25:50] away with the communion do away the
[25:51] tiing too I guarantee those preachers
[25:53] don't want to do
[25:55] that see but it does doesn't take much
[25:59] Amen to get away and offer the word of
[26:01] God I have been
[26:04] guilty but I have repented thank you
[26:07] Lord praise the Lord every time I read
[26:10] something I hear something I see where
[26:11] I'm wrong I'm
[26:14] repenting I don't have a kingdom to put
[26:16] nobody
[26:17] [Applause]
[26:21] in and I myself you know I got to deal
[26:24] with me right I got to deal with me just
[26:27] this
[26:28] and at the same time I'm accountable for
[26:30] you amen
[26:33] amen hello is that the word that's the
[26:39] word amen coming from another quote
[26:41] wisdom versus faith and he call takes us
[26:44] to St John 10 1-5 verily verily I say
[26:47] unto you he that enter not by the door
[26:49] into the sheep fold but climbing up some
[26:52] other way the same is a thief and a
[26:56] robber what is a thief and a robber
[26:58] somebody that comes to take something
[27:00] that's not
[27:01] there right and then if you ain't been
[27:04] born again if you don't have he said if
[27:06] you hadn't come through the door you're
[27:07] a thief and a Rob him you eating and
[27:10] taking bread that ain't even yours
[27:14] amen but he that entered by the door is
[27:17] The Shepherd of the sheep right to him
[27:20] the portal open and the Sheep hears
[27:22] voice and he calls his own Sheep by name
[27:26] and leadth them out out and when he put
[27:29] forth his own sheep he goth before them
[27:31] and the Sheep followeth him for they
[27:34] know his Voice come on somebody so what
[27:39] happens when the word of God comes and
[27:41] the Holy Spirit is here and the Holy
[27:42] Ghost is preaching and he's preaching
[27:45] and he's preaching and there's no result
[27:48] something's wrong with the sheep or
[27:51] something's wrong with the
[27:53] voice because he said my sheep Hearth my
[27:56] voice he he said and when they hear my
[27:58] voice they follow it brother BR preach
[28:01] the message hearing and acting upon the
[28:03] word of God you don't come just to hear
[28:05] once you come and hear his voice he's
[28:07] talking to you on a daily basis they
[28:10] well you know the Lord ain't talked to
[28:11] me in a long time where when the last
[28:13] time you've been the
[28:15] church he talks to me before church in
[28:17] between church after church but you know
[28:20] what a lot of time people don't realize
[28:21] it's God talking to
[28:23] him like right now amen amen am amen a
[28:29] stranger they will not follow but will
[28:31] flee from him for they know not the
[28:34] voice of
[28:37] strangers and don't you know it is so
[28:39] true God didn't leave you know when
[28:42] brother Brandon went off to scene he
[28:44] didn't leave us with
[28:47] nothing he made it difficult for
[28:52] us he let all of the isms and the
[28:55] schisms come in
[28:58] hello somebody when I got here they had
[29:00] all kind of camps
[29:03] already come on somebody amen but thank
[29:06] God for the books and the
[29:08] tapes right because and thank God for
[29:11] the genuine Holy
[29:14] Ghost because that is the the Holy Ghost
[29:17] going to say Amen to the word but when
[29:19] it's not the word the Holy Ghost ain't
[29:20] going to amen
[29:23] it right and it's so many times you say
[29:26] what do you mean now we've got the voice
[29:28] of the
[29:31] bridegroom oh Lord have mercy hello we
[29:35] we're not working amen with with the
[29:37] with the preacher we're working with the
[29:40] voice of the
[29:41] bridegroom hello the preacher done

[29:47] you all of the things you need to be
[29:49] asked do you take this one to be your
[29:52] awfully wet you you take this one and
[29:54] you done say I
[29:55] do Hallelujah amen and when he said now
[29:58] you can kiss the bride he he now lets
[30:01] everybody know this is Mr and
[30:04] mes the preacher ain't got nothing else
[30:06] to do with it then it's between the wife
[30:09] and the husband that's how it is right
[30:15] now
[30:19] Hallelujah hello you understand me so we
[30:23] look at this thing and the word of God
[30:25] says listen that's why I thank God when
[30:27] God
[30:28] really showed me how brother bam when he
[30:31] came here he says listen I didn't come
[30:33] to start a denomination or organization
[30:35] I came to make an entrance I came to
[30:37] bring the bride amen into that perfect
[30:40] statue I'm like there it is it's right
[30:43] there in Peter Peter prophesied he said
[30:45] there come he said for entrance shall be
[30:48] ministered unto you abundantly into the
[30:51] Everlasting Kingdom of our Lord and
[30:53] Savior Jesus Christ and we still got
[30:55] people in the message who look at Peter
[30:57] at the and you know at your faith virtue
[31:00] knowledge Temperance and they don't even
[31:02] stud about it it don't even move them
[31:05] they don't even think about it it's
[31:07] constantly on my mind it's constantly on
[31:10] my heart amen when I fall short of imp
[31:12] patience Lord help me come on somebody
[31:15] what have I do wrong I'm examining
[31:17] myself to see where I am up the ladder
[31:19] come
[31:22] onuh because it is those people listen
[31:25] if you still fighting and and and and
[31:28] and and and and and battling where
[31:30] whether I'm going to make a Rapture or
[31:32] even whether I'm saved Peter said the
[31:34] virtues there are not in you amen and
[31:37] Satan has brought you to a place where
[31:39] you forgot you were
[31:40] saved he ain't saying you're not saved
[31:43] but he's saying like the brother said
[31:45] last week you're neglecting your
[31:47] salvation
[31:50] amen add to your faith virtue knowledge
[31:53] Temperance all of these things must be
[31:55] found in you because God is coming for a
[31:58] mature bride amen well brother I can't
[32:01] do it all you got to do is get the life
[32:04] in you and he'll do the rest he's the
[32:07] masonry amen he's the brick M he's the
[32:10] one that's laying the
[32:13] bricks right just like I heard that
[32:15] brother say that's right it's nothing
[32:17] but the truth and when when Ezra then
[32:19] was building the wall he said hey I got
[32:21] a sword in one hand and a brick in the
[32:23] other give me another brick Hallelujah
[32:27] amen so you got to realize amen you're
[32:29] going to be fighting at the same time
[32:32] you laying another brick brick upon
[32:35] brick right virtue upon virtue but you
[32:37] be fighting with one hand and building
[32:40] the house with the other that's the way
[32:42] it
[32:44] works but they were anointed to do
[32:48] it anointed the Bible said the cares of
[32:51] this life is the thing that chokes it
[32:53] out of
[32:55] you amen H caring about too much stuff
[33:02] amen oh Lord am I going to make it what
[33:04] are you talking about the Bible said you
[33:06] already made it you made it in his mind
[33:10] you're just here to walk it walk through
[33:12] it
[33:14] amen like I've also told told you many
[33:17] times brother brandom saw Millions I
[33:19] don't know how far he went in time
[33:21] million upon million but something's
[33:22] wrong with your faith and you can't say
[33:24] I'm one of
[33:25] them
[33:27] all them folks and you can't see
[33:29] yourself
[33:33] there I say wait a minute the Rapture
[33:35] can't even take place the translation
[33:36] can't take place till I'm
[33:39] ready honestly folks I don't mean to
[33:41] count you out but every day I say I'm
[33:44] that one
[33:46] amen you got to have that for
[33:49] yourself oh Lord have mercy Lord no
[33:52] think about it was the the Bible said
[33:54] interest is ministered but listen to
[33:56] what Psalms 19 19 and 130 119 130 says
[33:59] the ENT the entrance of Thy word giveth
[34:03] light giveth understanding unto the
[34:06] simple it says listen it it gives
[34:09] Enlightenment and it look down and and
[34:12] another meaningful it gives
[34:15] fire it giveth fire and it giveth
[34:19] understanding to the simple it's like a
[34:21] Daybreak amen right it gives
[34:25] understanding to what the simple for
[34:27] those who can be taught those who can be
[34:29] taught amen I don't mind being called
[34:34] Simple I'm simple enough to follow
[34:38] this now look at this statement because
[34:40] I'm I'm telling you we can look at these
[34:42] things and think that that it doesn't
[34:45] mean anything like somebody like I heard
[34:47] brother Bram said it like this he said
[34:48] you can sit with somebody who's a
[34:50] worldly friend and and they're drinking
[34:52] and you saying that ain't going to
[34:53] bother you he said yes it
[34:55] will there's nothing you could be
[34:57] drinking Kool-Aid and they could be
[34:59] drinking wine he said that will
[35:01] spiritually bother you you may not know
[35:03] it at the time but it going to catch up
[35:05] with
[35:08] you why you're entertaining you're
[35:10] fellowshipping with
[35:14] Darkness hello now think about this
[35:19] Abraham uh the people in Moses they
[35:21] could say wait a minute wait a minute
[35:22] Moses you know Abraham told us nothing
[35:25] about slaying a lamb and put the blood
[35:26] on POR in
[35:29] little but Abraham had gone on to be
[35:31] with God it was Moses who was divorced
[35:33] for that
[35:34] day hello they said we can't even see
[35:38] this in our
[35:39] rituals in our regular church services
[35:41] we've never had such a thing happen like
[35:43] this but Moses could say to them yes
[35:46] that is
[35:47] true but this is not Abraham's day
[35:51] amen hello this is this is we know we
[35:55] sacrificed land
[35:57] but I'm trying to get you a greater
[35:58] revelation of what the lamb is all about
[36:01] this lamb is not just slaying for some
[36:04] type of ritual but this lamb is
[36:06] declaring your deliverance this lamb is
[36:08] declaring your healing this lamb is
[36:11] setting you free from
[36:15] bondage and if you reject this lamb you
[36:21] dieen and to reject the bloody bleeding
[36:24] word of the message you die is the Lamb
[36:27] of
[36:29] God oh help us Lord amen St John 8:24
[36:34] Jesus said unto them that ye shall die
[36:36] in your sins for if you believe not that
[36:39] I am he you shall die in your sins
[36:44] that's it we've got so many people who
[36:46] walking away from this and not
[36:49] understanding they're not walking away
[36:50] from a man in his theology they're
[36:53] literally walking away from the ark that
[36:55] Noah had
[36:57] amen or walking away from the
[36:59] instructions of putting the blood on the
[37:00] door Post in L come on somebody it's the
[37:03] same thing this man wasn't just a man he
[37:06] was born to bring a bride to Jesus
[37:09] Christ and he was the only one that
[37:11] could interpret the word amen because he
[37:13] wasn't The Interpreter it was the one
[37:16] who read who wrote it he was the one who
[37:20] was interpreting
[37:25] it
[37:27] it was so in every age God revealed
[37:30] himself by way of the son of man is that
[37:34] right and those people who did not
[37:36] believe Noah Jesus went and preached to
[37:39] them where were they their souls were in
[37:43] prison I just read the other day how uh
[37:47] here was a man who I forgot the name of
[37:48] the man but here was a Christian a old
[37:51] fellow who preached the word and loved
[37:52] God so much and there was another fellow
[37:54] who was a drunker who was a drunker and
[37:56] he he was a friend of brother bram's
[37:58] Daddy and when this man came to die
[38:01] brother brandham said he fought demons
[38:04] for four hours or more fought demons and
[38:09] he was calling on brother brandom's
[38:11] daddy Charlie Charlie don't let them put
[38:15] those chains on me Charlie don't let
[38:17] them put those chains on me now he was
[38:20] the one who said God didn't exist he was
[38:24] the one that thought Christianity was
[38:25] just foolish
[38:28] you hear what I'm saying now I'm saying
[38:30] these things to you folks to if I can
[38:32] disturb you a little bit don't you
[38:34] understand amen the Bible said if we add
[38:38] one word the plagues will be added to
[38:41] you that mean you going to miss the
[38:47] Rapture and if we take it out he said
[38:49] your name will be taken out of the Book
[38:52] of Life yeah that means you're dead
[38:55] amen you know why I'm saying preaching
[38:57] like this
[39:00] because God has instructed me to do
[39:04] so and not only that I have seen my
[39:07] erroring
[39:08] ways and I know that I am
[39:12] repenting come
[39:16] on and you need to
[39:20] too what is it I allow my reasoning to
[39:23] get in now there's a lot of things that
[39:24] I'm speaking of and you have no idea
[39:26] what I'm talking about some yesterday
[39:28] today and tomorrow hadn't come yet but
[39:31] tomorrow will be
[39:33] different why because I'm looking at it
[39:35] in a different way that's all I'm
[39:38] saying as he revealed it to me as he
[39:41] show it to me I'll show it to you but I
[39:43] really believe with all of my heart and
[39:46] and don't get me wrong you're not going
[39:47] to see me straining at a KN and swalling
[39:49] a camel but my point is amen we there's
[39:54] certain things and things that we
[39:55] wrestle with and have wrestle with amen
[39:58] that God said it's it is what it is and
[40:01] we've got to fall back and come into
[40:03] saying yes
[40:04] Lord there is no other way but God's way
[40:09] wisdom tries to point us out say oh well
[40:12] now you know we couldn't do that do that
[40:15] in this time we must do it anyhow see
[40:19] tries to find an easy way tries to make
[40:22] the Bible say things that it does not
[40:24] say now you say oh brother brandom wait
[40:27] just a moment we'll go back to the seat
[40:29] again what was it the devil tried to do
[40:32] with wisdom make God word say something
[40:35] that it didn't
[40:38] say that's where we fall into trouble
[40:41] when we make God's word say something
[40:44] that he didn't
[40:47] say now my thing is
[40:50] this we're going to either follow God
[40:52] with all of our
[40:53] hearts amen or we're not going to follow
[40:56] him at all you're wasting your
[40:58] time y'all hear what I'm saying now let
[41:01] me say it like this Abraham believed God
[41:04] but he didn't doesn't mean it doesn't
[41:06] show where he didn't make mistakes he
[41:08] still made mistakes but he never doubted
[41:10] the
[41:12] word that's what I'm talking about you
[41:14] gon to
[41:15] make you this is this this is death
[41:18] right here right here you see this thing
[41:19] that's death you play with him he kills
[41:24] you it's the TRU
[41:27] you play with him he kills you like like
[41:29] the brother said I thought I was the
[41:30] only one only Revelation I thought I had
[41:32] that by I thought it was something
[41:33] really person when he said lot is always
[41:35] with
[41:36] you your flesh is
[41:40] lot until you get rid of
[41:43] lot separate yourself from lot amen Paul
[41:47] had to do it amen Paul said listen lot
[41:50] he said you doing these things not me
[41:55] amenallah
[41:57] he said this is the flesh doing these
[41:59] things that's not me I'm separated from
[42:01] that I'm the inner man that's speaking
[42:03] here
[42:04] hallah there's no condemnation to
[42:07] those who walk not after the flesh but
[42:10] after the
[42:12] spirit is that okay now I'm working with
[42:16] these things so that you can understand
[42:18] that we're now approaching a real
[42:19] serious
[42:21] season and I wouldn't be saying these
[42:23] things if I didn't know it was sure but
[42:26] I'm going tell you something people
[42:28] nobody in this room can tell me that
[42:31] we're not ready and about ready to brace
[42:33] a
[42:34] Rapture I have I have I have either that
[42:38] I'm getting ready to go home something's
[42:40] happening with me that's all I'm telling
[42:43] you something Supernatural is happening
[42:45] to me it's either the Rapture of God's
[42:47] going to call my
[42:49] name that's all I'm telling you and
[42:52] that's the only thing I can tell you I'm
[42:54] the Watchman y'all not standing where
[42:55] I'm I'm
[42:57] standing I'm up in the tower folks come
[42:59] on somebody I'm a
[43:01] Watchman and when I see the enemy coming
[43:04] God anoints me to see it I don't just
[43:06] see it on my own I don't have eyes to
[43:08] see like that but God anoints my eyes to
[43:11] see and I can see a far off and says hey
[43:14] the enemy is
[43:19] coming
[43:22] hello you know brother BR said you know
[43:24] a sheep don't it doesn't have that
[43:28] mechanism within themselves to know when
[43:31] the enemy is
[43:34] around you know they just that's why
[43:36] they such easy pre they so
[43:41] dumb that's why it takes a Shepherd to
[43:44] spy out the wolf or to spy out any kind
[43:47] of lion or anything that's that's
[43:48] approaching because the Sheep is so dumb
[43:50] probably wouldn't even know which way to
[43:52] run amen so it takes a Shepherd Amen to
[43:57] see that Wolf coming to defend the Sheep
[43:59] cuz this the Sheep has no defense
[44:02] mechanism amen well I'm going to hurt
[44:05] you with my wool it ain't
[44:07] happening it has nothing it's just soft
[44:10] from inside
[44:12] out come on somebody the goat now is
[44:16] something
[44:17] different the goat has a a mechanism
[44:20] right it knows how to butt you oh I
[44:23] believe the word
[44:24] butt yeah I believe what you just said
[44:27] but you know that's the wrong nature to
[44:33] have reasoning now God is too good
[44:38] listen what he says in wisdom versus
[44:40] faith God is too good God's too merciful
[44:44] he loves you too much you hear that same
[44:47] old devil today God's too good to do
[44:50] this God won't do this God won't punish
[44:54] he'll do just exactly what what he his
[44:56] word said he'll do ye shall not surely
[45:00] Li see what the he's trying to do is
[45:03] getting her to reason with him in a
[45:06] minute that you reason on God's word
[45:08] then you are losing faith see don't have
[45:12] no yes he said don't have no yes NOS
[45:17] maybe so stay right with it see Eve had
[45:21] the right approach but she listened to
[45:23] his reasoning there's just so many
[45:26] people today that has the right
[45:27] knowledge that knows uh knows that this
[45:31] word should be God's word and it is
[45:34] God's word but they stand and let some
[45:36] Seminary Student reason them out of it
[45:39] away from the holy spirit away from the
[45:42] things of God reasoning will cast excuse
[45:47] me reasoning will to cast them down
[45:50] right but I'm going to tell you why
[45:52] Satan said I I read the fourth verse uh
[45:55] first and the fifth one and the serpent
[45:57] said unto woman ye shall not surely die
[46:00] for God knoweth that in the day that you
[46:02] eat thereof then your eyes shall be open

[46:06] and evil from evil see he's giving her a
[46:08] reason wouldn't you like to be equal
[46:11] with God see and that's the point is you
[46:14] know the point the point is listen God
[46:16] has already established your
[46:18] place you can't be no more than what God
[46:21] has established you to be if you try to
[46:24] get out of what God has establish you to
[46:26] be then you get in
[46:28] trouble
[46:30] amen come on somebody I'm not going to

[46:35] just something I want to lay out and
[46:37] Sunday I'll finish it off you know I I I
[46:40] I don't know how good it's going to be
[46:41] but it'll be real it'll be God I tell
[46:43] you that but let me say it like this
[46:46] when we look at this thing and it's so
[46:50] true I'm going off something brother uh
[46:53] uh uh uh Jason said to me which is so
[46:56] true and I can't remember whether he
[46:58] said it in his message or not but he
[46:59] said
[47:00] this if you prayed
[47:05] for and you have to wait for a good
[47:08] feeling to know that you healed he said
[47:12] that is like a slap in God's face amen
[47:16] amen because just as sure as the good
[47:19] feeling comes a bad one's
[47:23] coming and if you base your healing off
[47:25] a good feeling you going to base losing
[47:28] your healing off the bad
[47:31] feeling amen hello somebody is that
[47:34] right he said you don't wait to feel
[47:36] good he said you get healed because you
[47:38] believe God's word amen if the feeling
[47:41] come praise God if the feeling don't
[47:43] come but I'm Healed because God's word
[47:45] says
[47:48] so right you see what you I thought oh
[47:51] my God how many times we've done that
[47:54] amen I know I'm not by myself we wait to
[47:57] feel good to say well I know he's you
[47:59] know and we ask somebody are you feeling
[48:01] better see what I'm saying feeling ain't
[48:04] got nothing to do with it amen and we we
[48:07] actually uh we actually pushes that
[48:10] thing as if we we must feel good to to
[48:13] to be here John
[48:17] Ryan H you can't see but you told me I
[48:20] was here he said but you told me you
[48:24] believed go testify of your healing
[48:27] Hallelujah whether you can see or Not by
[48:30] faith I
[48:31] can see that's the thing we base it upon
[48:35] feelings and listen that in itself is
[48:37] not the way brother brandom taught it
[48:40] amen he said go on believing and God
[48:43] will heal
[48:45] you not whether I feel it or can you see
[48:48] a little bit of sight can you see a
[48:50] little bit
[48:53] now hallelujah oh oh help us Lord Jesus
[48:57] it's know his word says so amen Abraham
[49:01] had no signs of having a baby for 25
[49:04] years and he staggered not at the
[49:05] promise of God brother brand they got
[49:07] their little room together and their
[49:09] little booties and everything else set
[49:10] it all up no matter what people said and
[49:13] that's the way you got to treat them
[49:14] demons you going out of here if you
[49:16] didn't go today you going tomorrow amen
[49:19] and ah why cuz I'm not going to doubt
[49:21] I'm going to hold fast to the thing cuz
[49:23] God said so and the word is God whether
[49:28] I feel it or not if I feel bad maybe
[49:31] feel worse than I have that means
[49:33] nothing to me cuz God said you got to
[49:47] go there's one thing I tell you what and
[49:49] I didn't tell brother Keith this but
[49:51] this is the truth brother Keith lost his
[49:53] Bible the other day
[49:56] I don't remember saying this but he was
[49:58] telling me about it and somebody took it
[49:59] and everything else and I first thought
[50:01] I saidwell Lord I said that fell that
[50:04] stole that brother's
[50:06] car and brother
[50:09] brandham prayed and they said they
[50:11] sealed it sealed
[50:14] it the prayer in the name of Jesus
[50:19] Christ y'all hear what I'm saying it's
[50:21] like a Roman seal boom when you seal it
[50:26] show show this to them and they got to
[50:29] release it huh y'all hear what I'm
[50:31] saying and I prayed I said Lord whoever
[50:34] took it make them bring it back now I
[50:37] didn't tell him that he was praying his
[50:39] own prayer but that's the way I was
[50:41] praying and then he comes along and he
[50:43] tells me that I wasn't surprised no sir
[50:47] because I knew that God was going to
[50:49] bring it back I it was some feeling you
[50:51] know now I ain't going to go off feeling
[50:53] but it was it was a real good feeling
[50:55] then brother Keith said he had a piece
[50:56] about
[50:57] it just using him now my point is I said
[51:01] when it when you really like I said
[51:04] faith has long distance
[51:08] amen right the prophet of God said I'm
[51:10] going to kill a a Grizzly a big bear
[51:13] today a silver tip and he had this man
[51:16] who God done done already showed him
[51:18] what he can do and he's just kept were
[51:20] you sure brother R are you
[51:22] sure now we we're just here this is not
[51:25] even a place where those Bears be are
[51:28] you sure thought the devil was you God
[51:30] allowed it God was allowing that man to
[51:33] try to penetrate the brother Brandon's
[51:37] faith and God allows Satan to try to
[51:40] penetrate your faith when you said it's
[51:43] mine the devil has a right to come back
[51:46] and make you try to make you
[51:48] doubt it's a
[51:52] Warfare and it all depends on who you
[51:54] listen to
[51:56] Amen brother I don't I don't care if a
[52:00] God can create one amen amen hallelujah
[52:04] hallelujah God can create it
[52:10] amen he said I think he said uh if if a
[52:13] gly bear show up I think I'm going to
[52:15] die he said but you might as well start
[52:16] dying
[52:18] now Hallelujah that is the way Faith
[52:23] speaks regardless to What SAT
[52:26] says all
[52:28] right I'm going read this quote and I'm
[52:30] going to let you go I'm not going to
[52:31] stay long tonight but here I want to say
[52:33] it this this way because
[52:36] uh I just want to say people of God I
[52:39] want you to go and think about all of
[52:42] the things that you've heard brother
[52:43] brandham say that you disagree
[52:52] with you may not even know you disagree
[52:54] with it but your actions may show
[52:57] up
[52:59] hello and then you need to say Lord I
[53:07] Repent whether I'm right I being right
[53:10] is nothing to me I I don't care about
[53:12] that now I I'm at a place right now I
[53:14] you know how can I say it I know that
[53:17] every test and trial that comes my way
[53:20] is for
[53:21] me if God put me up into a place where
[53:24] I've got to make any kind of decision he
[53:26] put me there amen and he's expecting me
[53:29] to make the right decision amen have I
[53:32] always made the right decision
[53:35] no have you ever always made the right
[53:38] decision but now it's time to do
[53:40] something amen because when you got
[53:43] instructions how can I how can I say it
[53:48] okay let's put it this way if you had
[53:50] instructions and this in in this book it
[53:53] says you know basic
[53:56] steps on how to
[53:59] love simple right and you find yourself
[54:02] coming short you say oh oh let me turn
[54:04] back to the basic steps that I might see
[54:07] what I'm doing wrong and how to correct
[54:11] it right so that's what I'm saying you
[54:14] need to look through back through your
[54:15] word and say it's okay because I'm I'm
[54:17] saying this now so you can understand
[54:20] the message came to us that we would be
[54:22] without spot or blemish
[54:26] if you fail to follow the instruction
[54:28] you going to come up with a blemish or a
[54:29] spot
[54:30] amen so it's there to bring us to a
[54:33] place where we will be presented without
[54:36] a spot or
[54:39] blemish am I making
[54:45] sense oh the re right midle he says you
[54:48] ain't got no thought
[54:52] coming listen he said gut connect with
[54:55] Christ Our Lives of Our Lives of our
[54:59] emotions the lives of our mind connected
[55:01] in in him you you see you you ain't got
[55:05] no thought coming and that's right you
[55:07] say I think this you haven't got a
[55:10] thought I haven't either the Bible said
[55:13] let the mind that was in Christ be in
[55:15] you and he was always about the father's
[55:17] business so that's the only thought you
[55:19] ought to have what God said about it not
[55:23] what somebody else said but what God
[55:25] said that's all there is to it woo
[55:30] that's a stinger but it's real I don't
[55:33] know whether you want to make a Rapture
[55:35] but I do
[55:36] amen that's what I'm here about and my
[55:39] thing is think about things that we
[55:40] might hold on to amen that means
[55:45] nothing because everybody's got their
[55:48] opinion and that's the point when it
[55:50] comes to this message you're not
[55:51] supposed to have your opinion amen if
[55:54] there's things there's things I I I I've
[55:56] heard brother B say I don't understand
[55:59] I've even searched scripture and I can't
[56:01] understand it still so I don't preach it
[56:04] but I don't disbelieve
[56:07] it
[56:09] amen because I'm going to tell you
[56:11] something I'm not a prophet as such I
[56:15] didn't come to interpret the word I came
[56:18] to preach the word that's been
[56:21] interpreted amen that's what I'm here
[56:24] for
[56:25] that's what I'm here
[56:27] for he said remember this never forget
[56:30] it the right mental attitude toward any
[56:33] promise of God will bring it to pass the
[56:36] right mental attitude toward any promise
[56:39] of God it doesn't take Gifts of healing
[56:43] to heal sick people any person in here
[56:46] has a right to meet Satan anywhere if
[56:49] you're a Christian and defeat him on any
[56:51] ground that he could stand on
[56:58] amen hello but you know that's what we
[57:02] do sometime we all have this so-called
[57:04] Catholic
[57:07] spirit and we want to put a man higher
[57:09] than the
[57:10] other there ain't never one man that's
[57:12] high and that's Jesus
[57:14] Christ and if we are high it's because
[57:17] our lives are HID in him y'all hear what
[57:20] I'm saying now I don't mean no harm
[57:23] people but I put it this way way I ain't
[57:26] resting on none of y'all faith I got my
[57:30] own in times of trouble where are
[57:33] you amen y'all understand what I'm
[57:36] saying you can't rest on mine you got to
[57:39] get your
[57:40] amen amen you got to get your own you
[57:43] got to know that God is in you amen well
[57:46] I'm in trouble you know you know it's
[57:49] it's the truth this ain't something some
[57:50] like like some kind of day gone where
[57:52] you got a statue and you can't get to
[57:54] your statue
[57:56] God want to be in you so wherever you go
[57:59] wherever what kind of trouble wherever
[58:01] anytime anywhere any place he's always
[58:03] there with you and you ought to know it
[58:06] by now am
[58:08] amen right you ought to know it by
[58:13] now and if this is the word of God then
[58:16] it is just as infinite as God is see
[58:20] there you are you must have faith in the
[58:23] word that's the only way it'll work and
[58:27] God's word is seed and you Farmers here
[58:30] you know if you put a seed in the ground
[58:32] and take care of it right if it's in the
[58:35] right kind of ground it'll produce what
[58:37] the seed
[58:40] is amen so the work ain't even
[58:44] yours it's all about the seed life
[58:47] living in through you
[58:51] amen am it making sense amen
[58:56] we are the
[58:58] abners we are the people like
[59:01] Mary be it unto me according to your
[59:05] word all right if God called for a total
[59:09] separation I don't believe he meant
[59:12] this I don't believe he meant
[59:19] that God said he couldn't even bless
[59:22] Abraham till he separation himself from
[59:25] life God can't even fully bless you till
[59:28] you separate yourself from your flesh
[59:33] amen not like he want to he blessed
[59:36] Abraham but he couldn't give him the
[59:37] fullness of it why you know why because
[59:40] I'm going tell you something Abraham
[59:42] flesh was the thing that got him in
[59:43] trouble all the
[59:44] time but when Abraham was willing to die
[59:47] to everything and he showed by way of of
[59:50] of of Isaac because Isaac was his
[59:53] prolong in other words first Isaac was
[59:55] the seed that was to come after him that
[59:57] was to bring more seed that was come
[59:59] after him so if Abraham was able to give
[1:00:02] up Isaac that means when Abraham died
[1:00:05] there was none that was gonna be like
[1:00:07] Abraham amen if he had to kill Isaac
[1:00:11] amen y'all hear what I'm saying but he
[1:00:13] was willing to give it up why Isaac was
[1:00:16] basically in in like figure showing
[1:00:18] Abraham that Abraham's nature had
[1:00:22] changed he was no longer a a a goat he
[1:00:26] had become a
[1:00:28] lamb and he was willing to lay his own
[1:00:31] life as out down for a sacrifice and God
[1:00:35] said Abraham I know you love me now see
[1:00:39] that's what I'm saying God don't even
[1:00:40] really know he you love him until you
[1:00:42] willing to lay down your life am as a
[1:00:45] sacrifice amen your life as a sacrifice
[1:00:49] when you give your life up then God will
[1:00:51] say I know you love me now amen
[1:00:56] I know you love me that's
[1:01:10] stand it's
[1:01:12] amazing Peter said well Lord you know I
[1:01:14] love you I love I love you Lord you know
[1:01:17] he said if you love me Peter feed my
[1:01:21] sheep feed my sheep feed my l
[1:01:26] in other words Peter this is your
[1:01:29] job when you do this and not think about
[1:01:31] yourself for however the case may be
[1:01:33] Peter love
[1:01:35] me and and and and you know and that's
[1:01:37] how we love God by loving each
[1:01:40] other there ain't no way you can say you
[1:01:42] love God and and got a problem with
[1:01:46] me you know I just I say it like this by
[1:01:49] the grace of God people is and I wish I
[1:01:52] could God will give me Grace
[1:01:55] because there's a lot of things that I
[1:01:56] have to bring even clearer and
[1:01:59] plainer but this is just a a foundation
[1:02:02] of what I where we're going with this
[1:02:05] because I want I want every one of us to
[1:02:08] know you know uh God didn't make a
[1:02:13] mistake when he sent Elijah to us and
[1:02:17] there are some human elements in in in
[1:02:19] the message we're not talking about
[1:02:21] those things but we're talking about the
[1:02:22] word right now
[1:02:25] y'all hear what I'm saying we're talking
[1:02:26] about the word we you know brother bham
[1:02:29] gave us some illustrations of when he
[1:02:31] was a young man you know how he was able
[1:02:34] to kill was going to kill or shoot and
[1:02:36] you know we're not talking about that
[1:02:38] that that has not nothing to do with
[1:02:39] your salvation those were things that
[1:02:42] God allowed him to tell us so that you
[1:02:44] could know he was a
[1:02:46] man y'all hear what I'm
[1:02:50] saying he told us those things and you
[1:02:53] know uh it's the truth I didn't get to
[1:02:55] it but brother man even comes to a place
[1:02:57] he said forget about the
[1:02:59] messenger he said I'm not the messenger
[1:03:02] he said the Holy Ghost
[1:03:04] is y'all hear what I'm saying you know
[1:03:08] we're not here to to worship the the man
[1:03:10] you know what I'm putting up here y'all
[1:03:12] might see brother Brandon I'm putting up
[1:03:13] the pillar of
[1:03:14] fire to me that's what the picture is
[1:03:17] the picture is a pill of
[1:03:20] fire see you know and the reason why I
[1:03:24] felt like I feel I can't even explain it
[1:03:26] but you'll see a change you'll see a
[1:03:28] difference not because of the picture
[1:03:29] but because of obedience but my point is
[1:03:32] this you're going to really see listen
[1:03:34] if the children of Israel now come on
[1:03:37] out of all the generations we're the
[1:03:40] last God takes his
[1:03:44] picture and you don't want to show it
[1:03:49] off am I making making sense you know
[1:03:52] I'm telling you when I make a good
[1:03:53] picture I like to show it up y'all you
[1:03:56] what I'm saying and here God takes it
[1:03:58] but I mean it's the right attitude
[1:04:00] toward it you know we're not we're not
[1:04:03] worshiping a serpent you know on the
[1:04:05] pole we know what delivered us the
[1:04:08] Living God the almighty God Amen but God
[1:04:12] thought so much of us that he gives us a
[1:04:15] glimpse of himself more than a glimpse
[1:04:18] he places his faith in the cloud and
[1:04:19] then he shoots and gives us a pillar of
[1:04:21] fire and there's no way oh my like I put
[1:04:26] it this way if that many people made it
[1:04:28] to Heaven resting on what he's taught
[1:04:31] I'm going to rest on it too
[1:04:34] am that's all I'm going tell you I'm
[1:04:36] going to rest on it too if that many
[1:04:38] people made it because they rested on
[1:04:41] what he preached and taught I'm going to
[1:04:44] rest on it
[1:04:47] too you love God let's pray Heavenly
