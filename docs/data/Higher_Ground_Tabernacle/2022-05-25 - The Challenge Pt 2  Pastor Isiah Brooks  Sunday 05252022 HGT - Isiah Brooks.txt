jesus oh can't you see i'm feeling mighty happy and i'm feeling mighty fine and i'm enjoying jesus hallelujah [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] that song took me all the way back when i first came into the message we sing that song in aitkin south carolina and there we had wooden floors and so we go enjoying jesus hallelujah [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] we didn't have no instruments during that time but oh my we see god come down in such a powerful way and uh it was amazing a little church maybe about the size of these where the outer edge of this these chairs back to the wall but it was packed oh my god what a time what a time what a time what a time thank you brother thank you for the service amen we're going to get just right on into the word of god since the presence of the lord is already here and sometimes i have a leading just saying but something told me not to and so i didn't sing my own song i just picked up for where he's left off here you know god is good to us and um we're just going to get right into the word of god we there's so many things that uh i want to say and i just trust that you're able to receive what will be said tonight i know paul had a difficult time brother branham had a difficult time trying to change things by the word it wasn't that he was trying to change them himself but he saw where the church had gotten off track and you know at the end of his ministry practically the lord showed him that the laodicean church had gotten so far off track she didn't even know what she was worshiping and he saw that she was being led by a witch and she didn't even know it and she thought she was going to be going up yet she was going down and so with the bride of jesus christ we know who we being led by we're being led by the holy spirit by jesus christ himself uh thank god for all of the dreams and visions the prophet of god had that made us know that god was moving and using him and and we know that in 1963 when the seventh angel the seven angels came down and made the pyramid and showed us that that was the face of jesus christ we understood that there was a turning point then and a lot of people in our day has not made that turn are they still trying to worship god in such a way because only they because they don't know him but the bible tells us that in this day his name will be called the word of god and that's how important it is that his name should be called the word of god but as we stand uh let us turn amen to saint john 6. we're going to go to saint john 6 and we're going to begin reading at the 28th to the 35th verse now last week we we talked about uh being accepted in the beloved you and i know that the only way that you can ever be accepted in god is that you were with him before the foundation of the world this is not really a trial and error type of thing everything has been predestinated and you know ordered by god not that god made you such but by your own choosing while you in the mind of god you chose and because of those choosing now those things that you've chose to do is now being made manifest in your day now how god knows all of that he's god amen saint john 6 28 and i'm glad about that because i don't i wouldn't want to try to uh have a seek salvation if there is a chance if it was by chance you understand what i'm saying because by chance i might lose and by chance i might fail you know we're born failures to begin with so we needed something really solid something that can secure us and assure us that our salvation is what it is and nothing can deter that nothing can change that nothing can alter that because if you were with him in his mind before the foundation of the world you'll be with him at the end remember he told his disciples i knew you before the foundation of the world before they were ever consumed in their mother's womb jesus knew them jeremiah i knew you i called you before you was even a in your mothers whom i call you to be a prophet i gifted you and i i fashioned you for the very hour and the day that you're going to live in and he was a man was not jeremiah a man so i want you to understand that everybody in this book were men and women such as we no they're born in a sin shaped in iniquities come out speaking lies and we all needed redemption all right listen paul couldn't have never done what he did without the god in him and you can't do what god wants you to do in this last day without god in you hallelujah saint john please saint john enjoying jesus what a powerful psalm because that's exactly what i've been doing enjoying jesus where in me enjoying jesus and me saint john the sixth chapter aren't you glad that we god don't have to roll dice or play cards or whatever the case may be you know any meaning mindy mo you know that kind of thing no no no no god knows and by his own choosing he chose us perfect choice a perfect choice and how can god take a people like us and make something out of him but you know i have you heard me say i'm gonna let you sit in just a moment but god loves to straighten out the mess right saint john 6 28 i didn't mean to have you standing that long but as i say i'm just enjoying jesus then said they unto him what shall we do that we might work the works of god and jesus answered and said unto them this is the work of god that you believe on him whom he hath sent now jesus didn't say if you just believe on me he said believe on him whom god has sent right they said therefore unto him what signs shall we thou look for that we may see and believe thee what does thou what does thou work he said our father did eat manna our fathers did eat manna in the desert as it had written he gave them bread from heaven to eat and then jesus said unto them verily verily i say unto you moses gave you not the bread from heaven but my father giveth you the true bread from heaven for the bread of god is he which cometh down from heaven listen for the bread of god is he that cometh down from heaven and giveth life unto the world right you know i was thinking when i used to read this i always thought about it just being jesus coming down as a baby and all that but he that come down the word that came in this last day is the bread of heaven then say they unto him lord evermore give us this bread and jesus said unto them i am the bread of life he that cometh to me shall never hunger and he that believeth on me shall never thirst one more scripture saint john 11th chapter beginning at the 44 just reading the 44th verse we're speaking of lazarus there in the 11th chapter of saint john and the 44th verse says and he that was dead came forth bound hand and foot with grave clothes and his face was bound about with a napkin and jesus said unto them loose him and let him go let us pray father god we thank you for you being here standing within us you said we are your temple and father we come to worship you to hear from you and we pray father that you speak through these jaws of clay that the people may hear and give them ears to hear you lord we ask these things in your name let your perfect will be done create in us a clean heart and give us a right spirit within us and oh lord when you've done all of that seal us with your holy ghost we say these things in your lovely name jesus christ we pray amen you may be seated last week we were talking about uh sunday we were talking about traditions and a lot of time we don't know how powerful traditions are because it's traditions that blind people this is why laodicea can't see because she had rather follow her traditions than to be called by god because remember amen the anointing of elijah that came in our la in the last day was calling laodicea out of these traditions of men but because they had all of these traditions they couldn't see the jesus christ in malachi 4. it wasn't the man that he was trying to present to you and there was a time when we said you know god sent a prophet but i wonder when will it come if it would ever come to a time when people would be so powerful in god that people would ask who are you you would be able to respond i am the bride of christ because you and i must understand it moved from elijah to elisha and elisha amen is the anointing of god on a many members of people and this bride of jesus christ was chosen by god her name was placed on the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world she was just as predestinated as jeremiah josiah adam moses there is no difference because these men whom god had chosen came to fulfill a purpose for god in this book this is why jesus said i am the alpha and the omega now we know what the beginning of the the book says and we know what the ending of the book says but understand every person whether it be joseph whether it be paul whether it be old testament moses and you name all of those great patriarchs of of of men people who who worked for god understand that was not human flesh that was god anointing these people to be of his service to make sure that the word of god came to the people or would come to those people in that day and to be understand you got to understand that let's take for example moses when god called moses moses was where was he in egypt you know a place of bondage even though he wasn't in bondage he came to realize that he was the son of a slave and therefore you know what happened being ran out of egypt however you want to put it we find moses on the back side of the desert now at that time he was moses but the bible tells us that moses when he was born he was born a prop for proper child that means god visited this baby when he was a little baby god told his mom and his dad how to protect him in a time when pharaoh was killing all the babies of the of his age same same deal when it came to jesus did not god do the same thing but the point is is that god set the scene because he wanted to show how he was going to live to deliver his people now i want to want you to see something here there was only one thing god told moses to do put the blood on the doorpost and the lentil and the death angel will pass he never gave them rules he never gave them regulations in fact they came out of egypt by the hand of grace but when they got into the wilderness and moses went away for a season understand me because you got to realize it's when the prophet goes off the scene is when satan begins to play and they forgot if they only realized that it was the blood covering them they never would have fallen into the trap of of of dayton and korra because dayton and korra gave them traditions and and brought them back oh i would that we'd be back in egypt back into idolatry back into all of the things that defile mankind you see god only gave them the blood to secure them with you understand me jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever he can't change the only only thing he gave adam and eve to secure them was the blood of the lamb and we realized at the end of the day when all of these things have come through the church ages come all the way at the end when john turned to see the voice he saw a lamb that was slain from the foundation they were back to the lamb back to the blood it wasn't church creeds and church dogmas you got to do this and you got to do that because one thing i know about the holy ghost once you receive the holy ghost that holy ghost become your law the holy ghost will teach you how to dress he will teach you how to speak he will teach you all the things that man can't teach you and listen it will not be human effort it will be god in you living through you that's the way the early church started they didn't have no books and tapes and you know things like that and even when god sent paul to do something these people began to exalt paul it's in the nature of man everybody want a god with flesh somewhere somebody to worship is not that the same trick you know that uh uh lucifer placed on eve you'll become a god see it it's a tricky thing that the devil always does uh with people that are not a call for the purpose of god's uh elected bride you know what i'm saying seem like they fall even and when i say this i mean when when jesus came he came to tear down all traditions because his word is not traditional it's real it's the same yesterday today and forever he does not change you know how tradition says well god is not the same god he just doesn't do the same things he used to do he does the same thing but he needs somebody to believe even when the word of god came in jesus day uh they tried to trick him in so many ways but let me go back right now to what i read the reason why i read uh uh the scripture in saint john and i read those scriptures so you can see that man does not live by bread alone it's a natural food it doesn't save you you can be 110 years old uh you know i'm saying you you've eaten well you look good you can be healthy and yet you could die and go to hell bread natural food is not what saves you and natural food is not what defiles you but it was such a tradition among the jews that they could not eat certain things they just missed the revelation of god all together because remember the time when god brought forth the sheet of these creatures before peter and peter said oh no lord i have not eaten anything unclean in my life now why would god what was he doing he had already taught them in saint mark it's not the things that goes in you that defiles you but the things that comes out right he tried to tell them you know these traditional things that washing of pots and of hands and all of these things that the elders have placed on you is nonsense because he came to the elders and said but see you criticizing me but let me tell you something what's defiling you now i'm putting it in our turn he said because it ain't the outside and say mark he's telling them he's rebuking them now and they came to understand it he's rebuking them it ain't what what you wear that makes you holy it's the inside what's coming out cursing and lying and adulteries and fornication he said these are the things that defile a man if if if the outside was the thing that would defile you then what did what how how how did jesus let mary touch him mary not only did did she did she touch him but she washed his feet she cried and you know washed and dried his feet with the hairs of her head it was the pharisees and the sadducees who looked upon him as being unclean because their tradition says no way a prophet or priest is supposed to let this kind of woman touch him how bad they were in bondage right remember when the man on the road to samaria when they saw that man who had been beaten and laying there in the street the pharisee passed by yeah the religious people's sadducees they passed by but this man coming from jericho who was a samaritan and that's a no-no he was unclean because he was mixed yet god uses him to put them to shame in that parable because this man was more righteous than the pharisee or the levite you see what i'm saying see it's the deeds the things that comes out of you that what makes you holy and what makes you unholy this is what jesus was saying now i say this think about it those people in the in the wilderness brother adam says it like this he said they ate the bread from heaven they ate what we call the manna but manna means what is it they never came to understand it and they call it manner today but we understand is more than what is it we know what it is it is god manifesting himself in morphe is that right because he said i was that bread i am that bread that was in the wilderness i am that rock that was in the wilderness right i am that water that came from the rock they thought he was plum crazy because you remember i want you to understand the bible cannot be literally understood by just reading it it comes by revelation and jesus said i will build my house upon this rock which is the rock of revelation right now your revelation must go inside with the word but understand god's revelation is far deeper excuse me than what the letter shows hallelujah can anybody tell me when god said said to jeremiah i knew you huh we're creatures of time at least that's what we thought but we're not creatures of time those who are true sons and daughters of god are not creatures of time hello jeremiah was with him in heavenly places before he got here on earth in this dimension hello so were you this is why you can hear the gospel this is why you can understand the gospel and jesus said my sheep heareth my voice and a strain that they will not follow now where the people get cut off they cut they get cut off because god began to change things in every age you'll find that god began to change things things and get rid of the traditions and every group that came out tried their best to get rid of the tradition but they couldn't get rid of all of them because they didn't have a prophet see but when a prophet you began to see what the traditions are excuse me dry throat he's the only one that could have seen him we wouldn't have been able to just like one tradition that killed the pentecostal church the evidence of the holy ghost is speaking in tongues it killed it became an idol do you understand me they major on that and nothing else matter and the bible says that speaking in tongues is the least of the gifts you see what i'm saying that's what tradition does and when you bring people into that kind of a tradition you've got all kinds of people that are not even converted amen because they feel like because i spoke in tongues no no no if you did it brings about if a real speaking of tongues in the soul it brings about a conversion it brings a change you understand me it brings in an authority it brings a power there are many people who've spoken in tongues have net and don't have the holy ghost they about ran me out of my apostolic church when i said that but it doesn't matter the point is that's a tradition traditions are this when you make people dress the way you want them to dress many people don't understand that the the sanctification is by the holy spirit and not by the preacher it must come from the heart when it comes from the heart you don't have to worry about nobody backsliding from it because god put that revelation in their heart it's true you can go to message churches now and if you don't come in like they think you are ought to they look at you strange and then they segregate great gate themselves from you even like peter did from the gentiles what a hypocrite let god work on people's hearts oh hey don't let them fall now right don't let them make a mistake i'm talking about traditions traditions make you move away from a person and that's not the word the bible said if you see your brother overtaken in a fault you need to go restore him and the bible said go in the spirit of what meekness but we'll judge it and it all depends on how bad the sin is that's traditional oh all unbelief is sin amen amen jesus tried to teach those people who caught the woman in adultery their traditions was oh we're going to kill them and then god basically showed them all y'all wicked all of you let the man who the first let the man without sin he let him be the first to cast stone and all are vanished at least they were honest but tradition is a murderer the bible said it makes the word of god of non-effects in my church that apple started i learned a lot because if that there was i could only go to their organization i could only go to the churches in their organization and and i had to ask for permission to do that there was no such thing as being led and if i was caught going to another church even in my organization you know i could be put on the back seat as an example of being disobedient ooh did i go to other churches oh yeah i went to some churches that even believed in women preachers when i didn't believe in it and guess what i had a shout and good time because i recognized the same holy ghost some people just ignored they don't know but even in our own ignorance god gave us the holy spirit let me ask you a question how are you going to separate yourself from even people who baptize father son and trinitarians did you not know that most of the people that was with brother branham was trinitarians until the truth of the word came and yet they had the holy ghost many of them did but we don't have patience for that because tradition says they're not like us shame on us because we've become just like it was in that day that's the way it was when when lazarus listened lazarus was dead for four days and realized four days the bible said a thousand years as is one day is as a thousand years so let's say 4 000 years well listen it was 4 000 years before god came back to the church per se because death struck came all the way through to the place that they was thinking hello it's the truth but what the thing that jesus said when he raised lazarus from the dead sea and that's what happened when luther came with justification the thing that god wanted to do wanted to be done is that grave clothes be loosed and those grave clothes were types of traditions and dogmas and creeds and all of those things it looked like when pentecost came on azusa street that god had set them free he did set them free and what happened they went back to the traditions this message come to set us free amen bringing us to a place where we should be able to be led by god that's not disrespecting you know your pastor we know that when you got to go somewhere it's good to tell him where you're going so that he can be aware of what's happening and stuff like that there's no rules and regulation it's just respect but when god is leading you to do something you are obligated to do it traditions is what happened to the pentecostal people and they set those things in order of control hello because traditions were controlled that's what nickelodeon spirit was it was to control the laity and that's what they did and they put the fear in the people so badly till they couldn't go nowhere or do anything and yet they shout like they're alive but let me tell you something whenever you take tradition over the word you are dead amen amen that's why i go where i want to or whenever i'm led to go somewhere i don't we may not see eye to eye but one of these old days we will the holy spirit is the holy spirit take those claims grave clothes off and lazarus was wrapped with traditions from the top of his head to the soul of his feet bound what's happening to the people now we've allowed the message or men to take this very message and tie us up and bind us again oh they don't say directly the days of miracles have passed but if you we don't need gifts anymore where is that the word find it show me where it's at show me where god told rebecca throw it all away we're the time of restoration he said well the word is open don't you understand what that means that means that every gift that god has given you in this church is to be used by the bride amen am i making sense but traditions oh you two pentecostals see that is the word of men and so many men have used those same turns and they blaspheme the holy ghost without even knowing it i'm not all about gifts but my thing is this the message of this hour came to lift us up out of laodicea and placed us into a capstone ministry that will change you from glory to glory until you come into the very image of god it came to give us back that divine nature that peter talks about that's it that's the thing that's the treasure that's the very thing we lost but if we're so busy fighting each other and picking on each other and saying these things listen god hate discord god hates a proud spirit and when we find ourselves amen looking at this church and they ain't got this and the past i've been guilty myself but god is now cleaning me of all of the filth and all of the things that i once thought who am i who am i who are you that you can point a thing and say this one is in and that one's out you can't do it and not be right with god love the lord even this message you know they overlook the young people they overlook the young children just like his disciples wanted to do lord these children jesus they suffer the little children that come unto me for such is the kingdom of god but we'll look at our young people like they ain't got nothing to say and no you know i don't do that but that's what we do around the world i mean you know you got to be a certain age for people to pay attention to it that's tradition that's nonsense when god can take a man by josiah who's what 12 years old and make him a king but you got to be oh you got to be old to bring forth wisdom why did god use a david as a child amen that slew of goliath we must understand that this thing is all messed up and the reason why because traditions have blinded us amen we're free for 4 000 years god remained distant a spirit who was invisible and revealed himself through what pillar fire a cloud angels and then prophets man could not talk to god directly and make contact do you see what i'm saying that's how bad it was even in in in in the days of jesus when jesus came where he could be touched that's why john says we have seen him we have touched him we have handled him because there was a time they could not have done that god wasn't so convenient but god came down in the person of jesus christ hallelujah blew their traditions out of the way out of the water they said oh but you heal you heal by beelzebub and jesus said let me ask you something your preachers they do all this stuff over here with the with the lambs and the rams and all he didn't say it all like that but i'm paraphrasing he said but then who do they heal by he was just showing them you remember the blind man born blind and they tried to curse him and he said wait a minute you mean to tell me with all your education and what school did you come from you know no devil can heal you know that's not taught even in the old testament you know in your scrolls you've never seen a a a crippled blind or whatever healed by a devil you know god can only heal they got so mad at him because in their traditional mind jesus was out of order first of all he wasn't a levite secondly he come from a place called nazareth thirdly they say he was born a fornication understand me he was a renegade and they couldn't figure it out so much so they came to him and says lord tell us who are you who gives you this authority jesus said i'll tell you if you can tell me who john the baptist was it wasn't a part of your system he wasn't pharisees sadducees or rhodium or whatever tell me who john the baptist was and i'll tell you who i am and where i got my authority from and nato air communicable council got together and they reasoned it and says well we cannot tell and jesus said well because you can't tell me i can't tell you either see you got to understand this is the way you got to deal with religious people right now god remains jehovah god above god invisible who could not be seen or touched certain and and or to touch uh would bring certain death remember don't even come near the mountain if the calves or the animals come near they will die if they touch it they will die you understand me only the high priest could literally go beyond the veil y'all hear what i'm saying what are you saying i'm saying people of god even in this message they have so traditionally done things when you try to tell them that the seventh seal is open and god has come down in a special way they they try to tell you no no it cannot be that way same thing they did in jesus day and here he was walking around healing the sick raising the dead and they say he was a devil then who was william branham you understand what i'm saying no man could have done that and people in this message know that but they don't want to go any further they want to leave it right there with malachi 4. they don't want to go to eat the book for thou must prophesy again when is that going to happen it's happening now where is god when he come down amen where did he go brother branham preached the message the views of invisible union of the bride and the bridegroom amen come on people where is he now he's in his body he's in his bride but you must come to understand where he's at because some of us are still praying like he's a thousand a million miles away we've got to change that the protocol means a lot you miss the protocol you miss god that's why he said only a few be that find it only a few because traditions is blinding everybody listen brother brethren the ministry of brother branham god used him to bring grace um listen all those people that came to get healed and you know what was that that was the grace of god all kinds of situations they were in you know god never said well what what religion you belong to he never said well you're a baptist i can't bother you you're a methodist i can't touch you you can't get healed i know you you pinnacle you see what i'm saying you know what he said kept telling us god gives the holy ghost to whom he will we don't know who seed listen did you all of a sudden become seed when you came into this message absolutely not you if your seed you always were nothing can change that and and what makes it so wonderful is because now we can see we are seed by the revealed word of the hour and like i said the other night if pentecost the pentecostal uh uh uh uh uh which god a period could have brought us into the message why did we need malachi for why do we need the capstone ministry what does it mean they cannot be complete without us what does that mean because the first time in all history bible history god is feeling sinful flesh with himself it wasn't just brother branham he was a wave chief but god came to prove that his blood is still powerful [Music] can you imagine there's a time you had to be holy this and in the line of this in the line of that but the greatest lineage ever is the lineage of jesus christ that's why we are accepted in him because we were in him no laws no rules no regulations oh you don't listen well if i that means you know i can just do what i want to do well yeah it's true but if you're a true seed of god you'll do only what you want to do and be the will of god yes what did this whole purpose oh my god if i could get get my if i could get you all to see i'm sure you do the whole what up what i'm trying to say is what you need to be working on most the most is your nature letting god work here cleaning out all the flus letting god rip away all the traditions y'all understand me yeah listen it's your place that people don't even know how do i get the holy ghost what brother adam said you ought to least get out of order long enough to get the holy ghost if god strikes you and all of a sudden you feel a spirit to scream and oh praise god well i can't do it that's out of church all the traditions traditions huh traditions i i can't think of the man now i got him in mine now you hear him on the on on brother m tapes all the time hey man why have you been ben people wanted to know this is from tom brown and sister maryland they told me people wanted to know whether brother ben really had the holy ghost brother brown said yeah that's the holy ghost because sometimes being would break out it when everything was quiet hallelujah and shook and shake everybody brother brother brother brown said he even saw a man jump out of his seat it scared him so bad but that was the holy ghost you know i think god was saying too quiet in here hallelujah [Laughter] god has a way he has a sense of humor but you see people will say because they don't understand they would probably think he's got a strange spirit because that's what they were thinking and brother brown says no that's the holy ghost and god holy spirit works on everybody differently that's what i'm saying see traditions you gotta shout you gotta dance you gotta speak in tongues all those things are good but what if they don't have just like i was telling a brother the other day what you need to focus on is the change have you been changed and are you changing that's the holy spirit amen because what happens when you don't when you stop speaking in tongues and you can't speak no more everything on c's except the word abraham and moses right he introduced the law to protect them from sin and correct and to correct their what fallen nature is that right that's what being born again is is god correcting your fallen nature of what adam the real adam used to be before he failed correcting your nature because listen you can't get to heaven with a sin for nature the nature has to be changed that's the thing character that would go up in the rapture amen that's it god don't care if you're pretty he don't care if you're ugly he don't care if you're skinny he don't care if you're fat he's looking for nature change and that's what we ought to be it ain't about amusement ain't about oh going over here and shouting and dancing and having i'm so tired and don't get me wrong i've been in this message for a good while now i've had some powerful service i've been in but you know what little change because all of that ain't going to do you no good if the word of god doesn't reach you the word of god changes you and if they're not preaching the word telling you that you are you you're now in a place where god is saying grow up grow up into christ right the oil and the extra oil is that you have the revelation of who you are and the purpose for which you were born and that purpose is to magnify jesus christ in this day as being the same yesterday today and forever that's what brother brown did that was his theme and it wasn't just a theme it was in action what's going to happen oh we're waiting waiting on what if he's in you what other kind of anointing you need the greatest anointing is in you it ain't what you feel on your head and on your skin it's in you christ is the anointing and we need to learn how to tap into that that he may do what he need to do in us hallelujah once the law was instructed transgressions and you know what the law does it shows you just how wicked you are i don't know for some reason it just seemed like those who was in jesus's army in his day was always them real wicked ones they were the outcasts of the society and you know the church world didn't want them because they had lived such wicked lives he had thieves and robbers and and and and and you know you had matthew and mark and you know these rowdy people fishermen that curse every day yeah and god god changed all of that and god used these man in such a profound co can't you see you ought to step into the places if god can change peter he can change me matthew and all the rest of them if he can change them he can change me huh the woman at the wealth if he could change her he can change me he gave them the holy spirit and that holy spirit was promised to them it was there to for the asking for the taking nobody could get their portion but they were there to get it and let me tell you something nobody can get your portion but your portion is for you and when you get your mind made up i'm gonna like i said earlier a month or so ago i'm tired of living for me i've lived my life and god has been good to me when i'm gonna when it's going when will it become his day in my life if that makes sense his day not my day lord what your will is thy will be done today that will be done tomorrow if i see another day thy will be done and not my will that's living for jesus when you start praising god and testifying of god they gonna hate you and when you start i just witnessed to a man the other day i think i told you guys about it told him about the baptism in the name of the lord jesus christ and you know that man went right on and got baptized in the name of the father son and holy ghost i gave him the app you know the table and everything i told him to listen to it i know he didn't because the next time he saw me had that little that little that little spirit you know what i'm saying his pastor done told him you know and i picked it up it was okay i still loved on him i told him the truth about his girlfriend and he got mad at me you know but listen people when you speak the truth satan is going to hate you gonna hate you don't feel bad the bible said if you if you're hated for righteousness say you're blessed if you're persecuted for his name say you're blessed why did he say his name's sake and what people don't even understand is that god has allowed you know god through the church ages aloud he winked at their ignorance by calling the alma this and ahmedabad and ahmadis and he didn't let the nominations and organization uh interfere with what he wanted to do but listen that changed when the word of god was open it changed come out of her my people come out of her my people these are the people that he's working with now and understand this working with them is in a secret they're looking at us like we're cursed and that we're cult they have no idea listen who looked on like a cult they had pharisees sadducees during that day and here was jesus with 12 disciples quit their jobs following a man who had no place to lay his head he looked like a cup he did in the natural eye that's what he appeared to be that's why they persecuted him because they couldn't see the messiah that's what's wrong with the people they're looking at william branham but they don't see the messiah working through that human flesh nobody could have discerned your hearts nobody could tell you your past and your future but jesus himself it was not the man it was god hiding himself now a lot of people have resorted to the man we don't we don't do that no we only exalt the name of the lord jesus christ here we recognize we respect hallelujah that's another thing it's true if you don't read enough quotes in some people's church you ain't in the message now is that tradition where did brother adam say that where did he say it you won't find it it's traditions even when it comes to oh brother brethren say brother brandon said brother i'm saying it's tradition who started that but we'll look at people don't get me wrong i'm not disrespecting the prophet but where did he preach like that he never in fact everything that he thought would be contributed to him he corrected the people and says no it's not me it's him people of god we need to wake up and start preaching the gospel the way it should be and we preach it like it ought to be we'll get the results but people are scared of you because of what you've done with the message of the hour they're afraid nobody wants to be in a cult but we made it look like one oh i get in trouble for making statements like that but it's true anyhow let me ask you a question where is in the word when jesus came on the scene anybody say come see john it ain't there there's a time in a period that we literally literally put it in god sent the prophet that's all we preach god sent a prophet what happened to jesus christ he was lost in all of that there's a time to tell the people god sent a prophet but you need to bring them to jesus christ first you know you know i'm at a place in my life right now i see what i see and the revelation of the word is in me i know what i'm talking about and i could care less about who accepts me and don't i really don't i don't care anymore i often been thinking i've been just thinking about it lately the brother brother said if i got a preacher the truth and drink branch water and soda crackers that's what i got to do i know my calling and i know what i've been sent for and that is to exalt jesus christ thank god for william branham don't get me wrong i wouldn't see and know what i know without the man fulfilling his scripture i needed him i needed him thank god he never fell short he did everything he was commissioned to do thank god and because of that i have an entrance because we did not understand peter add to your faith virtue add to your knowledge we thought it was human effort but brother branham preached a message statue of a perfect man and right at the end of it he said you don't add to it as to you but you got to get it first huh god in you you understand what i'm trying to say we're so afraid and you know i've been like this too you know we get so listen if the holy ghost comes in here and he anoints one song you stay with it until god changes it because i've changed songs thinking that's where god wanted me to go and then the holy spirit drops we're being led by god it must be so from the song leader to the songs to the preachers whatever to the people in the in in in in in the church listen if you want to say shout hallelujah hallelujah you don't have to wait till i say everybody shout everybody clap your hand no if you feel like clapping your clap your hand if the word good good good and you want to scream scream you're screaming to him hallelujah it ain't about me it ain't about the deacons it ain't about the ushers it ain't about we come to worship god and you want to see god moving here you want to see the power of god listen listen to brother listen to branham tabernacle in their early stages the holy ghost coming in and they'd be screaming and hollering and everything else why why brother branham never rebuked them for it why because that's what the preaching is all about you we preach that he the shekinah would come in and when he comes in he anoints and feels right i've seen it even when i was in lyme ohio i'm preaching preaching preaching the holy ghost dropped down in the service and several people was filled with the holy ghost that's the way it's supposed to be done so electrifying that god hears the hearts of the people while this worshiping and feels them it doesn't have to take all night i weigh off my notes but it's a challenge i remember my wife and i went to a concert or singing at um i won't say where it was but it was the lafontaine's singing me and my wife was the only ones enjoying ourselves you thought you was in a catholic church and even though i felt so out of order y'all know me i'm gonna break that barrier i'm gonna break that barrier even though i felt that odd i'm like you ain't shut me up god's been too good to me i don't know what y'all feeling you know what and then brother brother brother the fontaine after service say you know you god blessed me you you helped me out see you never know what you're doing but if you let go and let god have his way you're encouraging somebody i'm telling you worshiping here you could never get out of order for me you know unless you know you you're the preacher came preaching we can't hear him now you got to just calm it down a little bit hold it up that's right the spirit of a prophet is subject to the prophet you wait till we finish and then when you say amen wow you can do whatever you want to do yes uh see the the purpose of his return is to build a bride for translation amen and to do this he must change her fallen nature into the restored nature of christ the divine nature to give this eve to give this eve his nature she will receive it as the first he rejected it for dogma listen it i'm telling you something here we must understand by god's grace that god always rebuked and paul did the same thing i'm gonna get ready to close paul did the same thing william branham did the same thing paul did but paul came into the church and you and i can't understand that we weren't there but can you imagine changing from the law to grace that's why they hated him paul says all this ritualistic stuff you doing is not going to work imma say it today all this religious religious stuff people are doing here today it ain't going to save you you need the holy ghost you need to be sealed by god that's the only thing and that's a lot of preachers think because they can preach they not made it and got bad natures temples like blood saul you know what i'm saying i know a few it used to confuse me until now seriously we all get off sometimes but i all the time will you have a reputation of that kind of a preacher that's not god that's not god it it amazes me because a lot of times people can i mean tear the house down let me tell y'all something if i was evil i could do the same thing you understand me i'm capable every good preacher every anointed preacher is capable of moving the crowd that's not what it's for i've been moved so many times i don't know how many times it's been but i've been moved i don't want to be moved i want to be changed i want the word of god to change me i need him to change me he's the master bill the lord please have mercy on us what good is it to come and hear the tapes like i when i hear the tapes i'll be that i'll be like i like god i want that i want that that's what i want i can't get it on my own but i need you i need you to change me and everybody you know we don't got into the same pentecostal mood we're like faster having revivals everywhere and the whole time people are not getting the holy ghost and you say how you know that the dresses are getting shorter the menswear is changing everything's changing now you say well that doesn't matter it does matter now but it's not for me to change you it must come from the heart and that's how you know it never was in the heart right because if it was uh in the heart it would be it would be a stabilizer but there's no stabilizer nothing traditionally stable in the message it's there but i mean the carnal church is still doing what they want to do anyway let's move on i'm not trying to be critical i'm trying to tell y'all the truth i want you to open your eyes and ask god lord whatever i've got into me that's traditional i need to be removed you know why because i want to love my brother i don't care what church he goes to i don't even care if he's a baptist i want to love him you understand me i don't want to disfellowship and all of that that's not what brother branham was trying to tell us this message this bride this word this open word the open book however you want to say it has given the church a liberty that she's never knew she had brother brethren tried to show us brotherly kindness he tried to show what that was even when people spoke bad of him he still fellowshipped with him he still loved him he didn't build no circle around i put them out he said when that happens he said you build a bigger circle but not among us we just we've done just like the pharisees and the sadducees and we looked down and i'm trying to show you what tradition and i say we because i've been guilty of it of the same but when god began to open your eyes to these things and show you you'll never reach perfection like that you'll never reach it because you got to love your brother you got to love your enemy you got to love your the unlovable did you know that there's some people that they're the character is so bad you can't you can't love them on your own you need god you do you can't do it god puts beyond your boundaries but look what look what being said everything that in you that's negative god put there so you can overcome and god understands your weaknesses hey he understand your weaknesses he understand mine right oh you love the lord and and i like i said paul paul and i'm gonna have to close but paul came busting up everything you don't need the synagogue no more because now what no ye not he told the corinthians no ye not you're the temple of god you don't need to run over there no more you don't need no blood sacrifices jesus paid it all can you imagine they couldn't wait to get their hands on paul and you know they didn't care they killed him three times and every time he got up kill him again they were so blind they couldn't see that was god in him think about it people every christian must suffer persecution if you're not suffering persecution for the name of jesus you ain't telling nothing you ain't doing nothing y'all understand me because god gonna put you in the way so you can get some persecution even it's from your family i've had church people to persecute me oh you think you're holier than now thank you for the compliment right that's what paul said oh if you if that are you what he said to jesus dude are you a king he said y'all you said it huh paul brought change oh it got to the place that even the women got out of order and wanted to be preachers he said not so and people hate him to this day no women's are not supposed to preach they can testify they can do a lot of things that's a lot of study but the truth is look what traditions did i got friends who died women preachers and i think to myself oh god be merciful you understand what i'm saying and they only knew did that because they didn't know the truth of the word traditions taught them that was okay you understand me so let's go on i'm almost done what happens when god came down in 1963 and i'mma say it like that i don't care whether people like it or not is what god revealed to me i know it's more to it than that and i'm not saying we're not going to see him in a corporate body but everybody won't when we will it won't be like the sky going to open and everybody's going to say no no no no that ain't it when he comes in that last day with the jews and all that that's going to be a different story every eye will see him but in this day he's stealing away it's a mystery it's a real it's a hidden mystery and that's what people don't understand that invisible union could not happen if he ain't here you know he you got a union with god he's up there no he's here people wake up wake up because a lot of times people even in the message want to downplay the cloud well tell me what was it then listen all i'm trying to tell you i don't care what you call it some say thunder some say perugia some say well i don't know nothing about those doctrines i just know what william branham left on the tapes with my bible and i'm gonna tell you something it was more than just to display his face in a cloud a word came a book came a message that was different from the pentecostal message was given and what are we doing with it trying to make it pentecostal no it came to change us from glory to glory to glory to glory we're learning how to walk we that being said we're learning how to walk we're learning how to talk we're learning how to run we're learning how to grow up into him mature in him and understand that the power of every gift was placed in you amen when god filled you with the holy ghost we've said it and i'm almost done i'm off my notes i'm just going to preach it like you want me to we said it many times oh that was in god he brought him into christ and all that was in christ he poured it into his bride and i'm like where is it where is that pouring in where is it when we struggles and we're struggling like children only because of unbelief was those disciples that god chose were they you know those 12 disciples were were they of god absolutely even though one was a devil he still had the power to cast out devils because he believed how many times did jesus say oh you fool slow at heart what was he doing why did he preach that to them and you know what he did he went all the way back to the prophets and began to show them who he was through the scripture william branham did the same thing he went all the way through the prophets to show us who jesus christ was and is in this day amen he did it and yet he said oh fools and slow now jesus can say that because he's god but old fools and slow of heart why didn't you believe all of the scripture not some oh see what i'm saying this is the major part of the scripture that god is saying that will identify you as bride because you believe in him whom he sent was which was a prophet he said that's your word let me go back to that scripture and i'm gonna close i'm not done i got more to preach on this because it's a serious thing and i trust by god listen john 6 28-35 it says then said they unto him what shall we do that we might work the works of god here's your works jesus answered and said unto them this is the work of god that ye believe on him whom he hath sent that's your work that you believe listen if those people that followed moses had only believed continued to believe they all would have made it right they all would have made it but they allowed dogmas and creeds and listen what they did it was horrifying what they did when moses went away they let dayton and cora bring them back into idolatry and that's exactly what we did in this message we allow preachers to come and bring us back into idolatry instead of going forward god had to raise up a generation that was going to be free a generation a new generation that wanted the circumcision god gave them the circumcision let me tell y'all something young people those of you who've been born in this message and around this message this message is for you but you can't allow these dogmas and these creeds and all of this stuff to tie you down it's not time to be famous you don't have to be popular you're popular with jesus just make sure you're doing the will and the work of god that's all that matters i escaped all of that crazy stuff i don't need all of that oh man y'all don't hear me say well yeah yeah yeah you're in the top 10. i don't want to be the top ten i just want to be in him and him and me i don't care money don't mean a thing don't y'all oh lord if y'all could understand me i i'm gonna say it like this by the grace of god and i say it as humble as i can i've had so many offers pastoral offers even since i've been here i would be a fool to leave here without god telling me to god told me to come here he never told me to leave y'all understand what i'm saying no money can buy me i remember when i was in even in ohio this particular group of people you know the pastor come he want to buy me a suit and buy me that and i saw it called his spirit just like that i said no i don't want none of that now if my wife wants something you can get her something but she she can't preach so i know she you know but that's what they did that's what they would do i'm trying to tell y'all something please i hope by god's grace you hear what i'm saying and understand i'm not trying to destroy nobody and what whatever they do let them do to let them do it but as far as this church is concerned i want to see a liberty amen i really want to see a freedom in the spirit i want you to understand it's the word who's the head ship not brother brooks i'm here i'm here to to you know so maybe you could see god work through me but the god that i have is greater than what you see he's god and so i trust that you see that all of the stuff that people don't put on it you know if i had known what i know now people came into the church and judging me because of the pictures you don't have this up and you and i have that up you ain't in the message that's tradition pictures and painting don't put you in the message no more than how you're saying buckle buckles buckles i can't even get it out buckle belt buckles or cowboy boots or cowboy hats you know that's nonsense but that's the way people judge it some people got to wear something around their neck or tie or pen or something to identify what's the difference between a roman catholic priest dressed in his robe his little beanie on his head and you know same thing to identify brother brown said that's hypocrisy hypocrisy they hated him and they still hate him and you may not realize the gravitation of the seriousness of what the lord jesus christ did for them to hate him so much sitting there with an adulterous woman letting her wash his feet open the eyes of the blind on sabbath day everything they thought was rituals and what was so god he said ain't none of that god they were so bad they was they thought you know selling you know in the temple was god jesus took it took that that whip and whipped them all out and said one thing you become made my my my house a den of thieves and robbers and that's what we got in the message and he said this he said but my house should be called the house of prayer i'm preaching this here i'm preaching so that god will help you see i can't show you but god can show you and whatever ain't word leave it alone let god break it away from you matter what it is oh man the anointing come in that place let me tell you something you can go to apostolic or pentecostal church right now and the anointing will come in that place and make us a shame but it don't make you right because the rain fall on the just and the unjust you understand me and they got us just as much gifts huh what you talking about and one thing but one thing i can say about the pentecost and the apostolic at least they are not a shame or what they got let's stand it was god led me a different way maybe when i come back again i'll be able to say things because i i just know i know that if we're going to move on to perfection we got to drop it all and only god can reveal to you personally what is and what is not it's an individual walk it's not a group thing and i trust that somehow the lord will deal with each and every one of our hearts we're not here to please men [Music] we're here to please god brother i don't say you shouldn't jump no higher than you live but if you're living right jump as high as you want to you got the goods you don't have to fear anything because you've been covered think about it the bible said for our sins the blood covered us once and for all can you imagine and you know a lot of times we think that god is up there oh he doesn't sin again dash oh he doesn't sin again dash no no once and for all you can't stop your destiny because god had predestined you but i think a lot of time we get into these things that we fail to see that a lot of the things we we do is not even necessary this is a common salvation simple you know i i i wear suits only because it's traditional [Music] yes you did it's traditional who made it that [Music] that was his error when i say era i mean the time he lived in but if his sin not to wear a suit then what about all those who are poor and can't afford one [Music] you know i wear it just out of respect but if i choose not to wear it that doesn't mean that i sin you understand what i'm saying and and you and i must understand by god's grace there are people all over the world that can't afford a suit all they got is what they got and if it's wrong for me to not wear a suit is wrong for them too because the word has no respect to person but we do this because it was passed or passed on passed on and and don't get me wrong i really believe that a person to respect god they ought to wear something really nice if they can't afford it something that will you know you come into the presence of the lord or to the king chamber what happens if the holy ghost get a hold of you and just make you roll all over the floor don't get mad at you if your suit is dirty i'm just saying when you come to the house of god you're supposed to come to the house expecting whatever god wants to do with you if you say jump jump you know i i'm closing but i was i was there at brother bob's church and they they know how to worship down in there and i i think brother frank was there i almost fell [Music] and my thought was this if i fall i'm a roll i'm just gonna let it roll that's right i'm not going to get embarrassed because if i would have fallen he saw the fall before i fell and you know i just love the lord satan is always there to try to stop you i just try to see things and i says you know what's going to happen to us there are going to be a few come out of this message only a few because they're not going to be led by men and that's what happened we were in pentecost the seven church ages were led by men but what god did with this one he took the man out the way so you can be led by the spirit i trust everybody see what i'm saying this is the hour that we're living in and we need to move on with god we really need to move on let's just have a word of prayer dear heavenly father who lives within us for we set in heavenly places in christ jesus lord we thank you for your grace and your mercy we thank you for being so real to us we thank you for being our father we've heard your word when you said
