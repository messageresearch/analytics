amen we can cry out all the day long all day and night but at the end of time it's us that needs the touch from the lord it's us that needs god to do something in our lives as us it needs god to reach

isaiah recommended that we listen to that message supernatural and i listened about one and a half times i sure enjoyed it he was talking about being in the atmosphere and what the atmosphere will do for you you can have all the teaching and all the doctrines and all the dogma you want but you can have all the word put the word in there put the word in there but the egg has to hatch hey man it hatches underneath a certain atmosphere amen that atmosphere is what we need amen let's open our bibles to the book of mark chapter four mark chapter four we'll start with the 26th verse i hope you all meant that take the coal touch my lips amen mark chapter 4 verse 26 jesus speaking and he said so is the kingdom of god as if a man should cast seed into the ground and should sleep and rise night and day and the seed should spring and grow up he knoweth not how for the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself first the blade then the ear and then the full corn in the ear but when the fruit is brought forth immediately he put us in the sickle because the harvest has come amen let's just bow our heads for a word of prayer heavenly father we just thank you lord for this evening father we came lord to this place father not for any other reason lord but to but to lie in your presence lord and to hear from your word lord and if we did come for any other reason than that lord we just repent of those reasons father and we lay ourselves down upon your altar lord lord just saying lord hear our we lord lord take the cold lord cleanse us wash us fill us with your holy spirit lord we're not here

to do lord that we might see the road so clearly lord for thy word is aligned unto our path lord and lord and alight unto our feet father so we lay ourselves down before your word asking the lord to reveal it unto us right now in the name of jesus christ we pray amen amen we can be you can be seated i want to speak a message called the the seed of christ amen you know i was thinking about the the old testament and the jews and some of the remarkable signs and wonders that they had throughout all the history that you read in the old testament you know they have the powerful testimony about how abraham was called out and god started a new thing and and called abraham to start a nation really called abraham out of out of all the people of the earth he called abraham amen and said your seed will be like the stars of the heaven your your your offspring will be like the the the grains of the sand and on down throughout history as you watch that seed of abraham you know in isaac thy seed will be blessed and everything that god said about that that seed came to pass throughout all the ages every single prophecy that relayed to that seed came to pass whoever blesses you will be blessed whoever curses you will be cursed and on down throughout history those that blessed israel were blessed those that cursed israel were cursed if they gave the whoever they gave a cup of cold water to the children of israel were blessed moab would not let him go through their lands therefore the moabites were cursed and on down throughout history you see that same pattern over and over and over again of god blessing those that that that were a blessing to the seed of israel why because god was protecting something god had placed his place a seed there in abraham and he called it and called it out before and says as your seed goes forth you'll see signs and wonders you'll see you'll see miracles my angels will be surrounding that seed and constantly on down throughout history you see the profits rising up you see signs and wonders you see rivers being parted you see them going forth on dry ground and nothing could stop the seed of god on down through all history glory because god had something a vision inside of his mind where he had hidden his seed in the earth the earth had been cursed there in the end of the garden of eden the earth had been cursed there but right there in the midst of the curse god kept a blessing upon the earth god kept a blessing upon the earth even though he couldn't find the garden of eden anymore even though he couldn't find the the blessedness of a place where god had blessed the earth you couldn't find that blessed place you might find types of in goshen or types of it over here or a man that was blessed over there but but but nowhere could you find that that garden of eden anymore but as abraham was wandering around in the desert he says i have given you this entire land and i have given you this land as it will belong to you and your seed on down throughout all the generations you know and even though the the offspring after four generations left that land and went back to israel god never forgot that promise this land is your land 400 years went by but yet that promise of god that deed stayed there in the hands of jehovah waiting to give that deed back to the seed of abraham so that they could continue on in god's promises as the children of israel left egypt as they were getting ready to enter back into the promised land after those 40 years they were traveling through and you know after 40 years you know the a lot of things could go wrong you know though their shoes they didn't wear out they had a lot of blessings but you know a new generation was rising up and though they tried to faithfully teach them you know there's still losing that that memory of moses and uh the miracle of the red sea there and and some of those early blessings and and uh you know and you can just imagine how moses trying to run a tight ship but we're getting there towards the end as they're getting ready to cross over jordan and all of a sudden as they come back the land of moab there was a king that hired a prophet by the name of balaam and he said i want you to curse these people for me and this king balak he hired this prophet by the name of balaam i said i want you to go down there i want you to curse him and as baalik he first said he wouldn't go because he knew god wouldn't do it but then as he was convinced he decided to go ahead and go on anyhow even his donkey tried to tell him not to do it but he continued on and as he opened up his mouth he he was trying to he says well i'm only going to say what jehovah will say and i don't know what was going through balaam's mind but as he opened up his mouth the bible says that he blessed if you count the times he blessed israel four times in a row if you remember the story that he had to get a bala or balak would take him over to this mountaintop and say here i want i'll show you this part of israel i want you to curse and he'd open up his mouth and a blessing would come out and so the the king balak you take him up to this mountain show well i'll show you a different part of him over here and he'd open up his mouth and a blessing would come out amen i didn't take him up he took him to four different mountaintops and each time expect him to curse israel the last two times he he would have his eyes wide open also he'd go into a trance and he would see jehovah and all of a sudden he would bring out a prophecy why did god do that i want you to think about it the condition that israel was in this moment of time they had just been backslidden they had just been going against the laws that god had given them god sent snakes into their midst just a few days before this and it bits they're biting them inviting them you know and and they began crying out to jehovah and jehovah had him make that that brazen serpent and put it upon the pole and whoever looked at that brazen serpent would be saved whoever would refuse to look at it would be lost and they had to look up to that brazen servant that one hanging on that cross there in order to be saved and those that did they were those that refused were lost but that seed continued on in the midst of all that backsliding in the midst of all that the seed was continuing on continuing on i went balaam he went and looked at this backsliding people look to the people who are stiff-necked a people that couldn't follow the laws of god no matter how hard they tried they couldn't follow the laws of god when when bala when balaam looked upon them opened up his mouth and he said behold i have received a commandment to bless god has blessed them and i cannot reverse it balaam said that's right he said to balak god has blessed them i cannot reverse it if the israelites in that condition because of the seed that was dwelling inside of them could not have that blessing reversed it all gives us a little bit of a confidence saints yes balaam further on said jehovah has not beheld the iniquity in jacob neither has he seen perverseness in israel now when i go back i read through my bible and i read the book of exodus and i read the book of numbers i started thinking oh look at the perverseness oh look at all the iniquity but here comes a a a a hireling prophet this false prophet but he opens up his mouth all he can speak is the truth and he says i cannot god has blessed them no one can reverse it who can stop the blessing of god the seed of god is inside of them they're going where they they're going towards a promised land who can stop them he has not beheld their iniquity neither has he seen perverseness the lord jehovah his god is with him amen the shout out of a king is amongst them amen said these people israel they shall never dwell alone they shall dwell alone they should not be judged amongst the nations they shall stand by themselves when god goes to judge all the nations israel will stand by his side while the rest are judged the third time he went to curse them as balak took him up to another mountain he lifted up his eyes he saw israel abiding in their tents according to their tribes all in order and all of a sudden the spirit of jehovah came upon him as his eyes were open he fell into a trance as his face was looking at israel dwelling in this dry and dusty desert dust all over their tents constantly going astray here and there he says oh how beautiful are your tents as they were dwelling in the desert he said how beautiful are your tabernacles o israel as the gardens by the riverside as the trees that the lord hath planted as the cedar trees by the waters as his face is staring there looking at this dry and dusty desert this straggly people have been wondering for 40 years this false prophet looks out at him and he says all i can do is say what jehovah is seeing i can try i can't speak what my own eyes are seeing all i can speak through the eyes of jehovah and though they're drying in a dry and dusty land though they're dwelling in their sins i can't even see their perverseness i can't see their iniquities i can't see the dust on their tents oh how beautiful are your tents oh you're like trees in the desert you're like trees planted by the riverside and his their kingdom shall be exalted amongst the nations balaam said unto the messengers of balak where he said unto balak didn't i tell your messengers if you give me a house full of silver and gold i can't go beyond the commandment of the lord to do either good or bad of my own mind but what shall what what jehovah saith that will i speak and now and now as balaam is saying to baalik and now behold i am going up go unto my people come therefore and i will advertise thee what this people shall do unto thy people in the latter days and balaam's one last final time looks out across israel his eyes are open but he falls into a trance the spirit of the lord comes upon him he says i shall see him but not now i shall behold him but not nigh there shall come a star out of jacob and a scepter shall rise up out of israel and smite the nations the corners of moab and begin to describe all the nations that jacob shall destroy this prophet this hireling prophet was hired to curse the children of the most high god but there was a seed of abraham there was dwelling in the midst of them that no matter how much this prophet could not curse them all even if the houses of gold and silver were higher they were given to this prophet he couldn't go beyond as soon as he entered in to the presence of the lord as soon as the spirit of god came upon him and he opened his mouth all he could do is pronounce blessings why because as soon as he broke in to the the atmosphere of the heavenlies he could no longer speak what he saw of his own mind or what the the the influence of the silver of balak behind him but he could only speak out of the goodness of god towards his people the children of israel know the jews best days were not when they crossed the red sea it was not when they crossed the river jordan it was not when jerusalem when the temple was created under solomon their best days were when a messiah was given to them when god when a lamb was born in bethlehem the best days were when god gave them mercy to to to give them a messiah amen when the the promise that they've been looking for and looking for and looking for their best days were when christ came to them when the messiah came to them their very best days were it was when jesus christ after 30 years of wandering around came almost all started and started preaching the gospel to them healing their sick raising their dead preaching to them the mysteries of the gospel these were their best days and they didn't even see it they didn't even know it oh they danced on the riverside when they crossed the red sea they got out the tambourines and they sang and they danced but when christ came what did they do oh they rejoiced when when when solomon when solomon built the temple and the presence of god came down oh they all they were silenced was a wrong camp and they realized their god was amongst them but when jesus came who recognized it where were the crowds at the time of hezekiah's revival they all they all rent their clothing and then the whole nation repented in the times of josiah they repented and they had a revival but when jesus came where was this revival where was the honor that was due unto jesus christ the one that was comfortable jesus said if a man comes in his own name him you'll receive i come in my father's name and you receive me not let's turn over to john chapter 3. john 3 verse 14. we'll actually start with the 13th verse and no man hath ascended up to heaven but he that come down from heaven even the son of man which is in heaven as moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness even so the son of man must be lifted up whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have eternal life for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son and whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life for god sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved verse 18 he that believeth on him is not condemned but he that believeth not is condemned already because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten son of god amen jesus christ was that only begotten son of god he was that seed that was promised amen he was that seed that god was protecting down throughout generation through generation through generation when when balaam rose up to curse he couldn't curse because that seed was traveling through the desert when when when when the uh when the when the seas parted and they marched across dry ground though that that water could not crash down upon them because that seed was marching through there god's seed was going to continue on through generation to generation and be revealed in the last days of the jews amen and now when that seed rose up he said i am the only begotten son of god let's turn to uh galatians 3 galatians 3 verse 16. now to abraham and his seed were the promises made and he saith not anti-seeds as of many but as of one and to thy seed which is christ so who are the promises made to it's for christ what was that journey through all those 2000 years of the jews for christ christ to be revealed upon the earth amen that seed was to be revealed people say oh i i'm a son of god the bible says that jesus was the only begotten son of god you say oh i i've been saved let me tell you jesus was the only one that was saved if you want to be saved you got to get inside of christ let me tell you there is no shelter people act with so much pride inside their church inside their denomination inside their doctrine inside their dogma and they can hide in all kinds of things but let me tell you there's only one hiding place because there's only one man saved and that's inside the lord jesus christ amen all the jews they they they they had so much pride amongst their religion and about all all the things all the miracles the signs and the wonders throughout 2 000 years of their history but the whole journey was so that the seed might be revealed which was christ because the promises were made to christ the inheritor was christ the one that inherited all the promises was christ the the garden of eden was restored to jesus christ everything was to jesus christ but when jesus christ finally came they didn't recognize him oh they received moses they received hezekiah they received josiah they received all the kings they received the prophets but but now christ stands up and he's rejected by the entire nation oh they danced on the riverside when the red sea was but when he fed the four thousand they were only interested in the food jesus says you're only following me because i gave you the food remember the scripture he says don't labor for the meat that perishes but labor for the meat that brings to everlasting life jesus christ was the seed that was to come you know the jews best time most glorious time was when the seed of god was being revealed amen when jesus christ was revealed ayo and the jews have had this or the gentiles have had a similar testimony we've had our revivals we've had our miracles our signs and our wonders we've had so many things but now we have christ as the mystery of god revealed we had the revelation of jesus christ in this last days we've had god himself healing this coming down amongst his people healing the sick amen raising the dead they say oh no that was brother brown let me tell you that wasn't brother brandon brother ben was just a man on the stage but there was someone that was greater than that man in the room amen revelation of jesus christ if the jews could have received the day that they were living in but you know it's the people that are living in a dry and dusty time that when the spirit comes if they don't enter into the spirit of that time then they just live out there in the desert land it was a religious desert when jesus came amen and the only water was jesus christ christ was the only hope it's like in the time of ruth there was many women that were gleaning in the field but there was a woman named ruth that discovered a secret her mother-in-law told her a secret she said boaz is up on the threshing floor tonight if you go in there and you lay yourself at his feet and do exactly as i tell you to do and if you tell them spread your skirt over me then he will fulfill the promise upon you so ruth she listened to everything her mother-in-law told her to do she snuck into the threshing floor that night she waited till after everybody was tired and fallen asleep just like her mother-in-law told her to as she went and she laid down a boaz's feet where were all the other women they didn't know the secret they weren't listening to the message they didn't know the time and the hour that they were living in nighttime had come and they had fallen asleep but there was one woman in the land that knew the secret and so she went and she laid down at boaz's feet and when he woke up he was afraid he says who art thou and she says i am thy handmaiden i am thy servant i am the one i am i am your servant and none other i belong to no one else i belong to you i am thine and thine alone o lord and she said and then she said those words just spread your skirt over me oh if the bride of christ if the wise virgins right now amen could rise up out of their sleep and say the same thing lord spread your skirt over me lord fill me with your holy ghost lord it is night out but you know what we know the secret it's a dry and dusty time churches are dying all over the place people are dead in the pews spiritually dead in the pews but there is a wise bride of christ who can stand up and say lord spread your skirt over me lord fill me with your holy ghost lord let my lamp be trimmed lord don't let me die here lord i didn't come here this far just to die as a laodicean but i came to be the bride of christ time of esther she was a jew but she was living in another land and the jews were getting ready to be wiped out and her uncle mordecai said you have a secret you're a jew jehovah is behind you because of who you are because the seed of god is laying inside of you you are a child of abraham therefore you were born for such a time as this and that was the secret that was given unto her and so she knew it'd be certain death to go into the king but she but she knew it was her opportunity as a one chance to save the seed of god they were getting ready to be slain by the enemy and so she went into the the the throne of the king and and she knew that jehovah was behind her and she said if i perish let me perish but i'll stand up for jehovah she knew the secret oh there was many there's many women that had gone in before the king there were many virgins that had gone in before the king but there is one that had a secret she had the secret that mordecai had given unto her the message had been given to her amen and under the power of that secret she went into the throne room amen for such a time as this and the seed was saved there was a time when i think as our brother isaiah was preaching i think it was tamar she knew that the seed must carry on but all physical opportunities that she knew of would pass by she could not see the seed pass on according to the law that there was an inheritance that would fail there was an inheritance they would belong to that seed but that seed that was promised to or was not given to her she said i got to receive that seed somehow i got to receive that seed somehow somehow that seed has to continue on and so she went by a way that seemed like foolishness she went by a way that seemed like uh like wickedness she went by a way that seemed not even right to the man she dressed up like a prostitute and she went to her uh her expected father-in-law disguised and hidden why did she do that it was revealed unto her it was revealed something had revealed unto her to get that seed receive that seed or perish so her father-in-law said unto her what price for this act she said give me your signet and your staff and your bracelets then afterwards when she found that she was expecting was child months later she was getting ready to be stoned getting ready to be burned with fire and she went over to her tent and she had hidden under her bed a a signet and a staff and a few bracelets oh she went to judgment and she was getting ready to be judged by her father-in-law she said but before you stone me before you burn me with fire i have a question i want to ask you whose signant is this whose rings are these whose staff does this belong to when he looked upon her he said she's been more righteous than i for she has made sure the seed will continue on her eye was towards the promise her eye was towards that seed sharia is towards fulfilling the promise of abraham but to continue on the inheritance to make sure that inheritance didn't fall on the ground amen and there is an inheritance in our last day of a filling of the holy ghost of a bride of christ so would stand up that marched to zion singing onward christian soldier marching as to war whose sickness is this where did you get this holy spirit where did you get this life that was within you i went to the what the giver of life i went to the one i found out what the secret was i laid down at his feet lord spread your skirt over me give me your staff give me your bracelets there's got to be a bride there is only one seed that the promises were made to the lord jesus christ but there was a secret that was revealed on that last sunlight those last days of the jews that roman soldier put the seer side and the spear into the side of christ outflow of blood water and spirit and that there would be a bride to the second adam amen and even though time was put on pause for the jews there was a mystery that had to be revealed time of daniel been prophesied there's 70 weeks left but in the midst of the last last week something's going to happen amen and we've been on pause for these last 2000 years in the midst of the week we've been on pause as god put the entire jewish nation on pause they rejected their messiah but they did it so god could preserve life so that god could preserve a seed so god could preserve a bride and now that mystery is being revealed that there will be a bride of christ it was that mystery bride that was spoken of hid today all throughout down throughout all the old testament she was that bride of joseph it was that bride throughout on down the one that would inherit the seed there's got to be a bride of christ it was hinted at it was prophesied of it was spoken of on all down through the whole testament but as the jews were put on pause there's a now this 2000 year span of time where the jews wonder what happened to us why have we been in this condition but now as they begin to revive let me tell you the bride's la bet last time the best time just like the jews best time is right now amen so i don't see much happening you know you just got to open your eyes we're living in a day where the holy ghost has been revealed or the power of god has been revealed where the plan of christ has been revealed to where the the bride is to be standing up waiting but it's only to those that know the secret and the secret comes through a message that has been revealed to the bride of christ amen christ is the mystery of god revealed but the second adam had a second bride had her bride which was christ and the bride of christ she goes into the threshing floor she says lord just spread your skirt over me i haven't saw anybody else's household i haven't threshed in anybody else's fields i have i've laid aside all the things of this denomination or this doctrine over here i've lay aside the foolishness of my of these things over here lord i am looking to the promise which is the lord jesus christ there are who is receiving christ when he came 2000 years ago those that were called who is receiving christ right now those that were called amen amen amen amen the seed of god or the kingdom of heaven is like a seed that was put into the ground and man watch it day or night and and then it rises up first the year then the the stalk and then the corn in the air but then as soon as the seed is revealed then the harvest comes as soon as the shuck begins to pull away it ripens in the sun and as soon as it ripens the harvest has come jesus said in matthew 25 let them grow together until the end as the the the servant came and says there didn't you plant good seed in your field where do these terrorists come from and the master said let them grow together till the end but in the last days i'll send out the angels and they'll begin binding the tears and they'll bind them tighter and tighter and tighter and tighter and at the last days the bride will stand alone everybody else will be bound but the bride will stand alone there will be one over here there will be one over there the brother brandon says oh don't look for one big group no it'll be one over here what was he describing he's describing matthew 25 everything else has been bound so now you just see a stock over here a stock over there what what so what are these stocks doing the seat is ripening in the sun amen what are they doing they're listening to the secret they're being ripened they know they've heard the secret they're listening to what their mother-in-law that told them to do amen go put yourself at boaz's feet wait till he until he fulfills the inheritance upon you and our inheritance is the fullness of the holy ghost let me tell you god's people as i said a few weeks ago god's people are always crying out for a partial deliverance for a halfway deliverance for a 50 deliverance but let me tell you god's not interested in any type of deliverance like that god is only interested in a full and complete deliverance god does not make halfway christians god does not make halfway preachers god does not make halfway husbands halfway wives halfway mothers god makes a complete and whole and when you're living in the day of the hour when all things come together all things dovetail all things come to their completion amen the satan is coming to his completion the denominations are coming to their completion their seeds are ripening amen and all the wickedness that has been sowed throughout all the generations are now coming we see them a ripening all around us amen as the seeds of wickedness are are being ripened all around us but so is a bride and we say oh what's going on it feels like i'm all alone but it's prophesied you'd be alone just lay yourself at your his feet they because they that wait upon the lord they're the ones that are going to renew their strengths amen why because that seed of christ continues on spread your skirt over me lord whose signet is this i have the life of christ inside of me amen because in the in the end that is the only thing that will save you is the life of the lord jesus christ amen oh there were many women in the land but those that received the life in every single one of these hidden patterns throughout all the old testament the promise was given to those that received the life amen they're the ones that were saved we have to have the life of christ the full character of christ must be developed on the inside of us why because we're the ones that know the secret we've we've found out what his secret is amen amen just like on the on the reverse side it's like delilah found out samson's secret amen by now that was just the negative but on the positive the bride of christ found the secret amen we are tied to him amen amen why because there is only one man saved that's christ amen he is the one that the promises were made to amen but if we are on the inside of him we shall be saved why as a bride is saved by your husband amen it's not by your theology it's not by your high thinking stop by how much you know it's not by uh how smart and how good you can look but further in this man's side or in this man's side it doesn't matter how much men say about you but are you revealing the life of christ is christ showing on the inside of you amen do you have the attributes of christ showing themselves without you outside of you amen why because when we are called to the day of the judgment only the bride will stand alone everybody else will go to the judgment but those who have the life of christ on the inside amen will be seated with him in his throne amen amen we have his secret amen and who can curse what god has blessed amen who can judge the bride of christ the one that is carrying his child amen amen amen the end time seed sign brother brown preached amen amen let's just stand christ is the mystery of god revealed amen that's just by our heavenly word of prayer heavenly father maybe a mysterious message lord but i just want to get it across lord that vision of there is only one way to be saved lord and that's at the feet of boaz at the feet of christ lord we heard your message father [Music] many they'll say it's by this dogma by that dogma many will say by speaking in tongues when you believe you receive or that the church has power to confirm the holy spirit upon you or when you take this holy eucharist you receive that life [Music] the lord all those things are just passed away we didn't come to thresh in those fields lord there was a secret that was revealed to us [Music] something that nobody else can do we've done all we know how to do lord all we can do is lay at your feet lord say spread your spirit [Music] let your character be upon us that's your life your inheritance live inside of us [Music] as mary said lord final mystery let it be unto me according to thy word lord [Music] i pray father for us i've heard the mystery your word have its way inside of us fulfill your gospel inside of us lord the mystery of the kingdom every characteristic because it's only those that are alive and remain at the coming of the lord [Music] many people think they're alive but that's not the life that we're talking about there's only one life and that is all that we seek after lord we've laid everything else aside lord but those that are alive and remain at the coming of the lord they're the ones that received the secret [Music] we shall rise and renew our up [Music] amen a secret in the bible it's been hidden on down throughout all generations bride after bride after bride after bride those that were given secrets [Music] isaiah to come up finish out the service [Music] we truly thank god for the seed i am one that rests upon that it is the only thing that will take you from earth to glory the seed itself which is christ brother branham said that the foolish virgins was caught out of the same material one just didn't get the holy ghost predestination comes in two two forms maybe three you need a predestined to go to hell you say don't say that but it's true you're either predestined to be foolish versions or you're predestined to be bribed whichever way it is the rain comes the anointing comes it falls and it's going to make you whoever you are and uh you know i thank god for that because knowing your bride you must come to have a revelation of that it's not a hope so it's a no-so and when god has given that to you then you can understand what he's preaching about that that seed is going to bring forth because of the rain because the conditions the weather whether it be snow rain sleet ice sun each each condition you go through it's for your benefit it's going to bring you to your full potential whatever you are and i trust that everybody tonight have a understanding of who they are one thing i know one thing i know about the seed of god and i love this [Music] you know when it came to ruth when it came to tamar you know and others who just was not going to let circumstances keep them back they were able to plow through all circumstances to get the promise and that's just the way the true seat of god is yeah we're going to have obstacles we're going to have rivers to cross and bridges and mountains to climb and valleys to go through but there's a determination in the seed of god to come to perfection no matter what god put us in the worst age ever this is laodicea this is the most wicked age this is where satan amen is god of this age you have an adversary who's come to destroy kill steal and destroy i'm not trying to preach over him last time i didn't say nothing maybe i'm saying too much now but i just want to encourage him to keep moving forward getting into the word because you know it's not how dramatic you bring it it's really what you're saying so i thank god for its grace and thank god for the message tonight and i thank god for the [Music] twist the prophet tongue up you know god says you can't curse him [Music] i place my blessing on them i know they bad [Music] but my grace is you love the lord i just want to thank god for his grace you wouldn't believe how satan valued me coming tonight troy was preaching i asked him to preach you don't need to come you don't need to go you can look at it i said but no i'm going anyhow that's the way you have to do it you've got to press through those crazy thoughts that come through your mind i thank god for allowing me to press through the opposition [Music] amen [Music] [Applause] [Music] and [Music] to the cross [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] please [Music] [Applause] [Music] is [Music] i [Music] amen [Applause] oh [Music] is [Music] oh [Music] with me [Music] it's jesus on the inside working towards the outside making a difference in my life [Music] towards the outside oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] making a difference [Music] [Applause] oh [Music] you
