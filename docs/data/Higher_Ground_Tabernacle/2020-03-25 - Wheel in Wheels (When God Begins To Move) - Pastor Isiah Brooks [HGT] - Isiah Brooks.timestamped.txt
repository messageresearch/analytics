[50:41] actually said to see Aviva when I read
[50:46] Ezekiel those could she be doing Zeke in
[50:49] it it gives me it fascinates me so
[50:53] tsunami machine because Ezekiel was
[50:57] seeing things that ask you is it you're
[50:59] really sure man can only see in the
[51:01] spirit
[51:02] calumny provoked with on this plea hi I
[51:07] know that one occasion
[51:08] you see Ezekiel said that God picked me
[51:11] up by the locks of my hair just looking
[51:14] for is a killer did you material and he
[51:18] took me up he may leave a into a time in
[51:22] my minerals into a period doesn't peel
[51:24] you into the future
[51:25] Dhoni future presents the prison future
[51:28] the future and I could see what all
[51:30] Israel was do is you prefer to squeeze
[51:33] right fizzy now the man who was there
[51:38] with Ezekiel alum TT avec Ezekiel he saw
[51:43] Ezekiel Eli fellowship with media
[51:47] because he killed on the Commission who
[51:49] said I was fellowshiping Ezekiel at the
[51:51] Shakuni God came down in Judah Sandri
[51:53] now the man that was there not long to
[51:57] utila perhaps didn't see what was
[51:59] happening to Ezekiel ' he was now in
[52:04] earth basically P and in heaven
[52:06] mmm mama lucielle mmm oh he brought up a
[52:09] little aloof II into a dimension those
[52:12] intimacy on that he himself could not
