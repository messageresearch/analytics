[19:00] blessing why did Amelia a man know the
[19:03] warning a magic Austria so when the
[19:10] Second Coming is not the end of the
[19:12] world by the end of this general
[19:17] disposition
[19:18] remember that originally salvation is of
[19:23] the Jews try amen jesus said that in
[19:27] John 4 when he met when he met him one
[19:30] other well a man the woman was telling
[19:32] Jesus Christ said look we worship on
[19:34] this month by you Jews say that
[19:37] Jerusalem is a right place where people
[19:38] have to question in there among the many
[19:41] have said that Jesus give me Jesus say
[19:44] the Jews they know hotness because
[19:47] salvation is of the Jews
[19:49] amen amen because they rejected
[19:52] subscribe it was designed our yes amen

[19:59] that's what I'm go to the juice
[20:01] crosswalk demented thank you
[20:06] so we have that blessing now amen
[20:10] so the end of the world that the Bible
[20:15] is talking about here is the end of this
[20:17] chest edges as we have attached a man
[20:20] and us Roger I was telling us the last
[20:23] time the church edges virtual is over
[20:26] and I live in hallways all-time at it oh
[20:29] man
[20:31] no it's somewhat many of these false
[20:33] programs when the normal regulation
[20:35] redness done it normally have some extra
[20:39] time because with our injuries and
[20:42] things during winter school help here
[20:44] we're not limiting time I don't which we
[20:47] called a bright each remember I was
[20:49] telling us amen because the denomination
[20:53] see the dream is a pattern when Jesus
[20:56] Christ came the first time the people to
[20:57] whom he came over the lost sheep of
[21:00] Israel remember when it was physically
[21:02] here he didn't go to check out now
[21:04] doesn't that Canada one who came to
[21:07] Jesus Eric oh hey you see look food this
[21:12] one the children is not meant for dogs
[21:14] yeah it Owen said to be the dogs will
[21:18] eat the crumbs of a man she said I've
[21:22] never found such a fit and a mess right
[21:28] so Jesus Christ came for the Jews the
[21:32] same way when Abraham kid he came for
[21:35] the pentacle star
[21:36] amen amen you know that so problem Oh
[21:42] things are following his ministry I mean
[21:45] he's the best ward daily mass
[21:48] administrator Papa Chak misunderstood
[21:50] yes
[21:51] a man that a name is acting his a
[21:54] student now one day remember my brother
[21:57] came to the coal fields and make those
[22:00] Pentecostal people happy they're
[22:01] everywhere were somewhere a man and the
[22:04] landlady asked him to preach to the
[22:05] story yes sir
[22:07] a man may immediately he finished
[22:10] see doctor they say he had appointments
[22:12] to preach across America ow
[22:14] engage him for the holy man who selects
[22:18] people God sent a men but like a Jews
[22:22] rejected Jesus Christ he also returned
[22:25] his amen amen
[22:27] yes sir maybe hallelujah amen
[22:32] so ready Jesus is coming soon to a this
[22:38] checked out
[22:39] disposition yes sir amen amen amen
[22:44] you seen a gentle disposition if you
[22:46] remember according to the message hunted
[22:49] with a prophetic message the time of
[22:51] Daniel Amen the first time that the
[22:56] Gentiles will contain Jerusalem
[22:59] mahapadma Jerusalem was a time of King
[23:02] Nebuchadnezzar when he went in there and
[23:04] destroy the temple and to the wooden
[23:07] vessels and when Mark
[23:08] amen amen there along the line after
[23:15] Christ came and died we have what we
[23:17] call a check it's or bra ground muscles
[23:20] all the times of the Gentiles as a
[23:26] savior of Revelation the times of the
[23:28] Gentiles the church eat
[23:30] so the changing isn't a generalization
[23:33] is running concurrently it's all ending
[23:35] in latisha misurkin Amen hallelujah so
[23:39] because they require in second is
[23:41] message the small group that came out
[23:44] amen now God is dealing with us what
[23:48] preparing ever amen amen
[23:51] where is the Lord hallelujah so very but
[23:56] before the end on agenda a according to
[24:00] Matthew 24:14 this scripture must be
[24:05] fulfilled said this gospel now if you
[24:08] watch that carefully I'm not a
[24:09] grammarian I'm not an English grammar
[24:12] person English no my native language by
[24:15] the language of instruction by schools
[24:18] in my country amen
[24:20] but if the way this is used is definite
[24:25] amen so this is prophetic a specific
[24:29] gospel so if you if you read Martin
[24:32] 24:14 they say and this gospel of the
[24:36] kingdom shall be preached in all the
[24:39] world for a witness unto all nations and
[24:42] men are in town said this cause full of
[24:46] the kingdom yes sir
[24:47] now I like that I like it with problem
[24:50] interpret that you see that that is why
[24:53] I said the food is for us as a big man
[24:55] it's my special group of people any man
[24:58] because you'll miss it amen
[25:02] so which gospel is Jesus Christ in a out
[25:05] it meant the same gospel that was being
[25:09] preached at that time an what was the
[25:12] one he gave a tortilla the water he came
[25:16] and preached that saved us ma ma say
[25:22] this gospel of the kingdom so if you if
[25:25] you read if you if you read I think
[25:31] Matthew chapter chapter 10 you see how
[25:37] the face how the gospel first wake up
[25:42] the one night Jesus Christ added you say
[25:48] and when he not call unto him his twelve
[25:51] disciples he give them power against
[25:53] unclean spirits to come them out and be
[25:56] a human or sickness is all about our
[25:58] diseases
[25:59] amen now the names of the twelve jump
[26:02] that these twelve Jesus sent forth from
[26:05] this fight and commanded them saying God
[26:08] not into the waves of ejecta and in the
[26:11] city of the Samaritans and I need not
[26:13] see what I was telling you AMA that
[26:15] originally it was meant for the Jews and
[26:19] when if you post at it it meant apostles
[26:23] what we detect us his face when today
[26:25] juicer when they rejected him said now I
[26:28] think the gospel to the Gentiles America
[26:31] Emilia hedge management so that gorilla
[26:34] to the lost sheep of the house of Israel
[26:36] and asking
[26:38] Oh preach saying the kingdom of heaven
[26:40] is at hand man heal the sick cleanse the
[26:43] lepers raise a massive temple yes free
