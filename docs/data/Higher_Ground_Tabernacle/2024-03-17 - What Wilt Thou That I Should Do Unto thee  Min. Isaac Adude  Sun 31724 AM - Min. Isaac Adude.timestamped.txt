[48:39] different than what you all

[48:45] say I won't
[48:48] die amen but I'll be raptured buy and
[48:52] buy because we know the Bible tells us
[48:54] that there will be some of us who won't
[48:56] die
[48:59] but we will be
[49:00] changed amen so if you believe that
[49:02] you'll be a part of those people who
[49:04] want

[49:09] you might as
[49:10] well am you might as well start singing

[49:16] die but I'll be raptured
[49:18] by amen amen we thank the Lord for his
[49:21] goodness and
[49:23] gra amen it's a privilege to stand here
[49:26] before you again this
[49:30] morning amen amen amen let's go straight
[49:33] to the word
[49:35] and open our Bibles in The Book of
[49:39] Mark then we read the verse uh Mark
[49:41] chapter 10 we read the verse 46 to verse
[49:48] 52 uh verse
[49:50] 46
[49:53] 52 U there's a little more base on my
[49:56] think you can turn it
[49:59] on Mark 10 verse
[50:02] 46-52
[50:06] maren the Bible says that and they came
[50:08] to Jericho and as he went out of as he
[50:12] went out of Jericho with his disciples
[50:14] and a great number of people blind bimus
[50:18] the son of uh uh uh timus Sat by the
[50:22] highway side
[50:25] begging
[50:35] and when he heard that it was Jesus of
[50:37] Nazareth he began to cry out and said
[50:40] Jesus thou son of David have mercy on
[50:47] me and many charged him that that he
[50:51] should hold his peace but he cried the
[50:54] more a great dear thou son of David have
[50:57] mercy on
[51:01] [Music]
[51:03] me man it's like what believe Elijah
[51:07] believe say that it's like fire shut up
[51:08] in my
[51:10] [Music]
[51:11] b sometimes you just can't hold your
[51:13] peace you just have to let it
[51:15] go verse 49 the Bible says that and
[51:18] Jesus Stood Still and commanded him to
[51:21] be called and they called him they
[51:24] called the blind man saying unto him be
[51:27] of good Comfort rise he calleth
[51:38] thee and he casting away his garments
[51:42] Rose and came to
[51:49] Jesus amen this is my favorite verse and
[51:52] Jesus answered and said unto him what
[51:55] would thou that I should do unto thee
[51:59] the blind man said unto him Lord that I
[52:03] might receive my
[52:12] sight and Jesus said unto him go thy way
[52:16] thy faith has made thee whole and
[52:20] immediately he received his sign and
[52:23] followed Jesus in the
[52:25] way
[52:31] amen what will thou that I should do
[52:34] unto
[52:36] thee amen let's bow our head father God
[52:39] we humbly come before your throne of
[52:41] grace this
[52:42] morning Lord to say thank you Father
[52:46] Lord thank you for everything that you
[52:47] have done for us Lord Lord thank you
[52:50] Father for this morning of Resurrection
[52:53] father Lord thank you Father for giving
[52:55] us a good heal
[52:58] Lord thank you Father Lord for bringing
[53:00] us to your house this
[53:02] morning Lord we just pray father God
[53:04] that you you you that you open this
[53:07] Bible to us and you explain it to us oh
[53:10] Father Lord we pray father God that you
[53:12] open our understanding oh
[53:14] Lord and you speak to our hearts this
[53:16] morning Father Lord we give you all the
[53:19] thanks Lord I pray father Lord that you
[53:21] help me to be so sensitive to the Holy
[53:24] Spirit Lord that I can only say what you
[53:26] want me to say father Lord in Jesus
[53:29] Christ name we pray amen amen amen you
[53:32] may be
[53:33] seated man this morning we have a little
[53:36] subject that we wanted to share with
[53:40] you amen we we took it out of this
[53:45] verse this question that Jesus asked
[53:51] blus what will thou that I should do
[53:54] unto
[53:55] thee sir amen last time the last time
[53:58] when we preached we preached about uh uh
[54:02] uh the you know joash and
[54:08] Elijah amen when Elijah told him to go
[54:11] get those
[54:13] arrows and errors representing
[54:16] deliverance and he needed to have enough
[54:19] faith for him to take as many errors as
[54:21] he
[54:24] wanted man just to continue on that
[54:26] thought we're going to continue with
[54:28] that as
[54:30] well amen so now God Jesus is telling
[54:32] you what would what what will thou that
[54:35] I should do unto
[54:38] thee what do you want that I do to for
[54:41] for
[54:42] you amen because when we read the
[54:46] Bible the prophet tells us that we have
[54:48] to replace ourselves in the Bible we
[54:50] have to place our names in the
[54:53] Bible amen we read this is a story about
[54:56] the blind body
[54:58] M Jesus asking that question to the
[55:01] blind body
[55:03] M what want me to do for you amen so now
[55:07] this morning we have to take the blind
[55:09] body M out of the picture and put our
[55:11] names and
[55:15] that amen Make It
[55:18] Personal Jesus asking you this
[55:21] morning what do you want me to do for
[55:23] you amen the prophet gave a story story
[55:26] of that man uh uh the prophet gave a
[55:28] story of that young man who was on a was
[55:31] on the board with the
[55:36] captain the captain was
[55:39] sick amen the young man remember the
[55:41] stories remember the the uh the Sunday
[55:44] schools and all the Bible studies had
[55:46] with his grandma and his
[55:51] parents in particular he had one verse
[55:55] that he remembered the
[55:58] amen that that he was told to always
[56:00] replace his name in that
[56:03] verse and then he applied the same
[56:07] Faith amen for the captain's
[56:09] healing he told the captain that if this
[56:12] works for
[56:14] me if this has been working for me every
[56:17] day that I apply
[56:19] it I believe that if you put your name
[56:21] in that verse as
[56:24] well it's going to work for
[56:27] you that verse tells us amen but he was
[56:31] wounded for our
[56:33] transgressions amen he was bruised for
[56:35] our
[56:37] iniquities the chastisement of our peace
[56:40] was upon
[56:41] him and with his stripes we are
[56:44] healed he said Captain if you can only
[56:46] place your name in that
[56:49] verse let's say his name was
[56:53] Isaac amen but he was wounded for the
[56:55] transgression of
[56:58] ISAC he was bruised for the iniquities
[57:01] of
[57:02] Isaac the chastisement of Isaac's peace
[57:06] was upon
[57:08] him and with his tribes Isaac is healed
[57:12] amen and after repeating that
[57:15] verse the captain
[57:18] recovered the
[57:20] captain because he applied the
[57:23] faith in other words he mixed his faith
[57:25] with the word of
[57:28] God Paul tells us in
[57:31] Hebrews he said that when you hear the
[57:33] word of
[57:34] Goden you just don't have to stop by
[57:36] hearing the
[57:37] word but you have to mix the your
[57:41] faith with the word of God that's when
[57:45] you have the
[57:46] results am so now is the
[57:49] question amen Jesus is asking you amen
[57:53] what do you want me to do for you am so
[57:56] your answer has to be mixed with the
[57:59] faith because remember that blind body
[58:02] May the Bible said that he heard Jesus
[58:05] Christ
[58:06] coming and notice that every time that
[58:09] Jesus was going
[58:11] somewhere noices were always going
[58:14] before he
[58:17] arrives remember when Lazarus
[58:20] died the Bible says that Jesus was two
[58:23] miles away from the
[58:25] house amen Mar already heard the news of
[58:29] Jesus
[58:31] coming amen so Jesus was to Miles Away
[58:35] amen so meaning that that blind body
[58:38] M when you heard Jesus was
[58:41] coming Jesus was a little farther away
[58:44] from from where he
[58:46] was amen so notice that that man was a
[58:49] poor
[58:50] man he was a beggar so we we might as
[58:54] well say that he was hungry but time he
[58:56] was was about to ask for God to to to to
[58:59] to heal
[59:02] him amen the prophet said that he was
[59:06] hungry he was
[59:08] skinny maybe skinnier than
[59:11] me amen but he was hungry and
[59:14] skinny so in other words he couldn't
[59:17] have his voice couldn't be loud enough
[59:19] for Jesus to hear
[59:22] it because Jesus is clear saying that
[59:26] Jesus was walking with his disciple and
[59:28] a great
[59:33] multitude amen so he had bunch of he had
[59:36] loud noises around
[59:38] him some people criticizing
[59:41] him amen some people blaming him for the
[59:44] death of their family
[59:46] members some people saying whatever
[59:49] thing that they had to
[59:51] say so everybody was saying
[59:54] something so Naturally Speaking that man
[59:58] did not have the strength in
[1:00:01] him to be so loud that will be know
[1:00:04] surpass all those noises to could get to
[1:00:06] Jesus
[1:00:10] hears that thing that that man had that
[1:00:12] was different than other
[1:00:14] people that had a
[1:00:17] faith that was going behind his
[1:00:21] voice a faith that was above everybody
[1:00:24] else's faith
[1:00:26] that was able to break out the
[1:00:30] barriers go straight to Jesus
[1:00:33] ears Jesus can hear him calling
[1:00:36] him so when Jesus heard the facei of
[1:00:39] that
[1:00:40] man amen Jesus
[1:00:43] stopped amen certainly the disciples
[1:00:45] were asking but well Jesus why are you
[1:00:49] stopping where Jesus might have said I
[1:00:51] heard somebody calling
[1:00:53] me Peter might have said butes
[1:00:56] everybody's shouting
[1:00:58] here I'm right next to you and I can't
[1:01:00] even get a word of anything coming out
[1:01:02] of this
[1:01:06] people Jesus might have to looked at
[1:01:08] Peter and said that this one is
[1:01:10] different this one is
[1:01:14] clear this one is different amen it's
[1:01:17] another
[1:01:19] Channel amen this one is coming from a
[1:01:21] private
[1:01:23] Channel amen it's something that I can't
[1:01:25] answer
[1:01:28] directly and call that that guy go and
[1:01:30] call him amen and they said that every
[1:01:34] once once he was
[1:01:36] called he left everything that he was
[1:01:39] doing amen that's the attitude we have
[1:01:42] to
[1:01:43] have when Jesus calls
[1:01:45] you you have to leave everything that
[1:01:48] you're
[1:01:49] doing you have to leave all and follow
[1:01:52] him you have to leave everything and go
[1:01:55] respond to the
[1:01:57] you have to be like Samuel amen after
[1:02:01] after God called him for the for the
[1:02:02] third
[1:02:04] time he says here I am
[1:02:06] Master speak for thy servant
[1:02:10] hear that has to be our attitude when
[1:02:12] Jesus calls
[1:02:15] us amen when he came to
[1:02:18] Jesus Jesus asked
[1:02:20] him what do you want me to do for
[1:02:23] you I'm pretty sure you stopped me for
[1:02:27] reason I'm pretty sure you had a faith
[1:02:29] for a
[1:02:30] reason amen so when I was reading it I
[1:02:33] started asking
[1:02:36] myself Jesus knows
[1:02:39] everything amen remember we was
[1:02:41] somewhere and people were thinking
[1:02:44] things about him and he was able to hear
[1:02:46] the
[1:02:48] [Music]
[1:02:52] thought the woman at the well Jesus knew
[1:02:55] her life
[1:02:59] amen Jesus knew exactly what that man
[1:03:03] needed amen so why did he ask
[1:03:07] him what do you want me to do for
[1:03:10] you amen think of it think about that
[1:03:13] for a
[1:03:14] minute amen he knew
[1:03:17] everything amen he could read the heart
[1:03:19] of
[1:03:21] men but yet he asked him what do you
[1:03:23] want me to do for you
[1:03:27] amen because if you read the chapter
[1:03:28] that comes after
[1:03:31] that amen that would be Mark
[1:03:35] 11 we read verse 22 to uh to
[1:03:42] 25 amen and the the bible say that and
[1:03:45] Jesus answering sayith unto them have
[1:03:48] faith in God for verily I say unto you
[1:03:51] that whosoever shall say unto this
[1:03:53] mountain be thou removed and be thou
[1:03:56] cast into the sea and he shall not doubt
[1:03:59] in his heart but shall believe that
[1:04:01] those things which he sath shall come to
[1:04:05] pass and he shall receive uh and and he
[1:04:09] shall have whatsoever he
[1:04:22] saith amen the reason is because God God
[1:04:26] gave us power with our
[1:04:30] tongues amen he said that whatsoever you
[1:04:34] sayith amen remember Daniel when Daniel
[1:04:37] when when Daniel in Babylon you know
[1:04:40] when Daniel the the the story of you
[1:04:42] know that the story of the Angel and
[1:04:46] Daniel when the when the angel came with
[1:04:49] an answer to Daniel what what did the
[1:04:51] angel say they said that as soon as you
[1:04:52] open your mouth and started praying
[1:05:00] amen because there is power behind our
[1:05:03] behind our Tong there's power with
[1:05:04] everything that you
[1:05:08] say Amen you have been given the power
[1:05:10] to speak the word and you will see it
[1:05:15] accomplished God told Moses Moses why
[1:05:17] are you
[1:05:18] crying amen just speak amen because
[1:05:22] that's the power of the believer amen
[1:05:25] you have the power to
[1:05:27] speak and change the
[1:05:30] situation you have the power to
[1:05:32] speak and your life will be changed you
[1:05:36] have the power to
[1:05:38] speak and you will receive the healing
[1:05:40] of your body you have the power to speak
[1:05:44] and you will see great things happening
[1:05:46] in your
[1:05:48] life therefore I say unto
[1:05:50] you that what things soever you
[1:05:54] desire when you you pray believe that
[1:05:57] you receive them and you shall have
[1:06:01] them amen the power behind behind your
[1:06:04] behind your
[1:06:07] tongue amen now the prophet says that
[1:06:10] now could you have that kind of Faith
[1:06:17] tonight in God's
[1:06:19] word well Jesus is his
[1:06:23] word could you have that much faith in
[1:06:25] God's
[1:06:28] word just as directly identified for

[1:07:43] years amen I've been going back and
[1:07:46] forth from the hospital to the
[1:07:48] hospital amen I've heard this report
[1:07:51] from this doctor and for the other
[1:07:53] doctor there is no
[1:07:57] all hope is
[1:07:58] gone even now Lord amen whatsoever you
[1:08:03] ask amen God gave you the power to ask
[1:08:06] whatsoever you
[1:08:08] want God gave you the ability to ask
[1:08:12] whatever you
[1:08:13] want that God will give you the desire
[1:08:16] of your
[1:08:18] heart the Bible God Jesus did not you
[1:08:21] know list the number of things that we
[1:08:23] had to
[1:08:24] ask because he knew by listing things
[1:08:27] that we want we had to
[1:08:29] ask someone will come with something
[1:08:32] that's not
[1:08:33] listed and then he will get that as the
[1:08:36] reason that God doesn't list God doesn't
[1:08:38] hear my
[1:08:40] prayers he gave you that he gave you
[1:08:42] that open
[1:08:44] door he gave you that that check that
[1:08:47] the amount is not written on it amen say
[1:08:50] that you write whatever you want amen
[1:08:53] whatever numbers that you want to write
[1:08:56] am you just write it on Amen and you
[1:09:00] will receive it amen but you have to
[1:09:02] have the faith behind
[1:09:05] it amen it's not always what we
[1:09:08] say Amen but do we really believe what
[1:09:11] we
[1:09:13] say Amen have faith and it shall be
[1:09:17] shall be it shall be given to
[1:09:20] you amen but if God is
[1:09:23] God he's just says he just as great one
[1:09:27] time as he is the other
[1:09:31] day amen he doesn't
[1:09:34] fail he's just the
[1:09:36] same amen he can't be great one time and
[1:09:40] not great the
[1:09:42] other he's got to be great all the
[1:09:47] time in order for him to be God Amen he
[1:09:51] has to be
[1:09:53] greaten he has to act
[1:09:56] as I've said many
[1:09:58] times on every case like he acted on the
[1:10:01] first
[1:10:04] case if he
[1:10:06] didn't he did wrong the way he
[1:10:10] acted am if he heal the people in the
[1:10:13] Old
[1:10:16] Testament amen and heal them in the New
[1:10:20] Testament the same as he did in the old
[1:10:23] and the New Testament
[1:10:27] amen and won't heal them
[1:10:32] today then there is something wrong with
[1:10:36] God Amen we all believe that God isn't
[1:10:39] God our God doesn't
[1:10:42] change amen whatever he did back then is
[1:10:45] is able to do it
[1:10:47] today but most of the time we don't
[1:10:49] apply the exact same
[1:10:52] faith we read the word amen but we read
[1:10:56] it as
[1:10:57] stories amen we read it as as if we're
[1:11:00] reading the story of Abraham
[1:11:03] Lincoln am we're reading it as if we're
[1:11:05] reading a story of of some great man in
[1:11:07] the
[1:11:09] past we're reading it as if for reading
[1:11:12] some paper some some some some new new
[1:11:14] new how do you call it
[1:11:19] newspaper but we don't read it and apply
[1:11:21] the same Faith as we are supposed
[1:11:24] to
[1:11:27] amen if you read
[1:11:29] something amen you put yourself in that
[1:11:33] situation and you apply the same faith
[1:11:35] for that
[1:11:37] situation I promise you that you will
[1:11:39] receive the same
[1:11:41] results because if God did it back
[1:11:44] then amen he's the same God to do it
[1:11:48] today if God was able to provide healing
[1:11:51] for the children of Israel in the
[1:11:54] desert that remember that that that
[1:11:57] generation was an ungrateful
[1:12:01] generation compling every chance they

[1:12:09] think about
[1:12:10] it but nevertheless amen amen despite
[1:12:14] their
[1:12:15] weaknesses amen God was able to provide
[1:12:18] healing for
[1:12:20] them despite their
[1:12:22] weaknesses God was able to feed them
[1:12:25] every
[1:12:26] day desite their
[1:12:29] weaknesses God was able to give them
[1:12:31] water from The

[1:12:38] Believer who have the holy spirit inside
[1:12:41] of
[1:12:41] you who has the great one inside of you

[1:12:48] same able to Grant the desire for that
[1:12:51] ungrateful

[1:13:01] same God this morning if we can't even
[1:13:04] go beyond
[1:13:06] that God was able to Grant Satan's
[1:13:11] desires amen God was able to give it
[1:13:14] what he
[1:13:15] wanted when he wanted to go attack
[1:13:18] job he had to first go to

[1:13:46] you can do whatever you want with
[1:13:48] him but don't touch his

[1:14:58] devil he going toess you
[1:15:00] more remember that those Legion they
[1:15:03] went to worship
[1:15:05] Jesus they asking a
[1:15:08] question what you come to torment
[1:15:11] us amen they're having a conversation
[1:15:14] with

[1:15:36] with your
[1:15:40] creator could have that conversation
[1:15:42] with
[1:15:43] Jesus Jesus was as special as he could
[1:15:48] be
[1:15:50] patient they ask a question he will
[1:15:54] respond to them
[1:15:55] amen he will ask them a
[1:15:57] question they will respond to them amen

[1:17:14] the door because Jesus will not come in

[1:21:42] sea amen look at this
[1:21:45] story those unclean
[1:21:48] spirits amen they knew the
[1:21:51] result amen they knew the end of the
[1:21:53] journey
[1:21:57] that they were going to be cast
[1:21:59] away because Jesus says come out of the
[1:22:02] come out of him you un clean
[1:22:06] spirit amen even if they knew
[1:22:09] it they started to negotiate to propose
[1:22:13] better
[1:22:15] terms and Jesus was paion enough to he
[1:22:19] to listen to
[1:22:21] them amen and even grant them what they
[1:22:26] wanted amen so what about
[1:22:28] you amen the bible say that God created
[1:22:31] You In His
[1:22:34] Image and in his
[1:22:36] likeness amen he created you so that you
[1:22:39] can be like
[1:22:42] him amen that's why to save
[1:22:46] you amen he didn't want to send an angel
[1:22:49] to do
[1:22:50] it amen but he decided to create a man
[1:22:54] to create himself a body like
[1:22:58] you Amen to have that personal
[1:23:01] connection with
[1:23:03] you Amen in order for him to save
[1:23:07] us amen amen You Were Made In His
[1:23:10] Image amen but for your
[1:23:13] salvation amen God had to create himself
[1:23:16] a body like
[1:23:19] you Amen to save you amen if you had to
[1:23:23] do all those things
[1:23:26] amen he could have just say a
[1:23:28] word and things would have been
[1:23:31] changed amen but he had to do all of
[1:23:34] this amen being in this
[1:23:37] body the prophet said that he felt
[1:23:40] everything that you
[1:23:42] feeling am every situation that you go
[1:23:46] through Jesus had to go through it amen
[1:23:50] in order for him to understand your
[1:23:53] pain in order for him to understand your
[1:23:57] desire amen he did all of that Amen to
[1:24:01] build a certain relationship with
[1:24:05] you so that you can go to him in
[1:24:10] prayer and he will be given to
[1:24:13] you and he didn't even stop
[1:24:15] there amen but he said that amen he said
[1:24:18] that I will be with you even in
[1:24:21] you in other words amen he gave his
[1:24:24] created himself a
[1:24:26] body he suffered a
[1:24:29] pain he went on the cross to die for
[1:24:32] you and after that amen he didn't leave
[1:24:36] you
[1:24:37] alone he sent his
[1:24:39] Spirit to always be with
[1:24:42] you sent his
[1:24:44] Spirit to intercede for you that every
[1:24:49] time that you have a
[1:24:50] desire every time that you need
[1:24:53] something you can't quite explain it to
[1:24:56] him the holy spirit is there Amen to
[1:25:00] report that to cry to
[1:25:02] God to report that to the
[1:25:05] father in other words the reason you
[1:25:09] have the Holy
[1:25:10] Spirit take whatever you want am to
[1:25:14] explain it to the father in the better
[1:25:16] terms with the right
[1:25:20] words because with this Mortal
[1:25:23] tongue sometimes we just can't explain
[1:25:25] what we're
[1:25:27] feeling sometimes we just can't explain
[1:25:30] we just can't explain what we
[1:25:32] want that's why the prophet says am
[1:25:35] there is no better way to thank god with
[1:25:37] this m with this Mar
[1:25:40] tongue there's just no better words or
[1:25:43] no better things to say I mean you can
[1:25:46] try to say you know with words but that
[1:25:48] would not be
[1:25:50] enough amen sometimes you go to God In
[1:25:53] Prayer
[1:25:55] you praying for
[1:25:57] something but you can't quite explain
[1:26:00] it you don't quite understand what
[1:26:03] exactly you
[1:26:04] want you know that you need
[1:26:07] something and sometimes you even forget
[1:26:10] to ask about
[1:26:11] it God was
[1:26:15] thoughtful he thought about you so
[1:26:18] that's why he sent his holy
[1:26:20] spirit amen to be there to intercede for
[1:26:23] you
[1:26:25] Amen to take your
[1:26:28] desires to take your
[1:26:30] prayers amen and to bring it to the
[1:26:33] father amen so that you can so that you
[1:26:35] can have whatever you
[1:26:38] desire amen and now he's asking
[1:26:41] you what do you want me to do for
[1:26:45] you amen you have that
[1:26:48] opportunity the same one that joas
[1:26:51] Haden Elijah told him go get the
[1:26:56] arrows amen get as many arrows as you
[1:27:01] want amen because of the lack of
[1:27:04] faith he only took

[1:27:09] for you as
[1:27:11] well what do you want me to do for
[1:27:14] you amen you're not answering to
[1:27:18] me amen but answer to
[1:27:21] him amen because he's the one asking you
[1:27:24] [Music]
[1:27:25] what do you want me to do for you Amen

[1:27:30] said that you have to replace yourself
[1:27:32] in the Bible put yourself in the
[1:27:36] Bible amen originally this question was
[1:27:39] asked to the blind body
[1:27:42] M but when you put yourself in the
[1:27:45] Bible you replace blind the blind Body
[1:27:48] by with by your

[1:27:53] you
[1:27:55] what do you want me to do for
[1:27:57] you amen there is no limits to the
[1:28:01] answer it's everything that you ever

[1:28:29] him in a
[1:28:36] cage he can't
[1:28:39] fly he don't need
[1:28:42] Wings if you got him in a
[1:28:45] cage amen he says that that's the way a

[1:30:08] Jesus certainly he is amen if the blind
[1:30:13] body May has could trust
[1:30:16] him I can too amen if the woman with the
[1:30:20] blood issue could touch His
[1:30:22] Garment
[1:30:26] amen I can too amen for he's open and
[1:30:31] willing he's begging and
[1:30:35] accepting whosoever
[1:30:37] will let him come and drink from the
[1:30:40] Waters of of of Life freely
[1:30:42] [Music]
[1:30:44] amen amen what we need today is a
[1:30:47] Revival of that
[1:30:51] type hallelujah amen if the blind body
[1:30:54] may could trust
[1:30:56] [Music]
[1:30:57] him so can
[1:30:59] I amen if that woman who was losing
[1:31:02] blood could touch his
[1:31:05] garments so can I amen remember that the
[1:31:09] woman who was losing
[1:31:11] blood the prophet said that that was the
[1:31:13] first that case was not mentioned before
[1:31:16] in the
[1:31:18] Bible but nevertheless that did not stop
[1:31:21] her from receiving what she wanted
[1:31:25] because knew she had such a strong
[1:31:30] faith she knew that once she touch Jesus
[1:31:35] garments the H of His
[1:31:38] Garment she will be made
[1:31:40] home amen it was the same situation with
[1:31:43] the blind body
[1:31:45] M Jesus was surrounded with
[1:31:49] people people touching him
[1:31:52] everywhere even having personal contact
[1:31:55] with
[1:31:56] him other people even being really close
[1:31:59] with
[1:32:00] Jesus touching his hands his feet and
[1:32:03] his his his hair and every part of his
[1:32:06] body but her faith was so
[1:32:09] strong she didn't need to be in contact
[1:32:13] physical contact with the body of
[1:32:15] Jesus she said that even Jesus
[1:32:19] garment even the the ham of His Garment
[1:32:22] just a little bit
[1:32:24] amen that is enough amen for me to
[1:32:27] receive the
[1:32:29] healing amen amen and that Faith was so
[1:32:32] strong by touching Jesus amen that took
[1:32:36] a virtue inside of
[1:32:38] Jesus Amen that took that virtue
[1:32:42] away and to go to apply it for a
[1:32:46] healing the prophet said the Bible says
[1:32:49] after she touched Jesus
[1:32:52] garments Jesus was sick I'm sorry Jesus
[1:32:55] was uh was tired was was
[1:32:58] weak amen so now the prophet asked the
[1:33:01] question he said what is great what is
[1:33:05] greater between raising up somebody from
[1:33:07] the
[1:33:09] dead and healing a
[1:33:12] person amen what is greater because
[1:33:15] remember before
[1:33:17] that Jesus went to the tomb of
[1:33:20] Lazarus amen and called Lazarus he said
[1:33:23] Lazarus come come
[1:33:25] forth amen but nowhere the Bible says
[1:33:27] that after doing it Jesus fell
[1:33:31] weak amen he resurrected somebody who
[1:33:34] was
[1:33:36] dead four
[1:33:38] days his body was already
[1:33:41] corrupted because corruption starts
[1:33:43] after three
[1:33:46] days Lazarus started to
[1:33:49] stink so no way Lazarus could have come
[1:33:52] back to life
[1:33:55] amen but Jesus went there and a single
[1:33:59] call it was a short
[1:34:01] prayer amen he said father I thank you
[1:34:05] because you heard my
[1:34:07] prayer then he said Lazarus come
[1:34:11] forth Lazarus came
[1:34:14] forth amen Lazarus started
[1:34:17] walking am but the Bible says that Jesus
[1:34:19] did not feel
[1:34:21] weak amen but when that woman touched
[1:34:25] him amen he did not touch Jesus
[1:34:28] body amen just the ham of His
[1:34:32] Garment that was able to heal
[1:34:36] her and made Jesus feel
[1:34:39] weak the prophet now said what is it
[1:34:42] what
[1:34:44] happened Jesus said that I can't do
[1:34:47] nothing I can't do anything before the
[1:34:49] father tells me to do tell to
[1:34:52] me the son doesn't do anything before
[1:34:55] the father tells him to
[1:34:57] do so the reason why Jesus did not feel
[1:35:00] weak when he when he resurrected
[1:35:05] Lazarus because the father already told
[1:35:08] him what he was supposed to
[1:35:12] do amen because the father already told
[1:35:15] him amen that Lazarus will
[1:35:18] die amen that you will have to go be
[1:35:22] late four
[1:35:24] days after all hope will be
[1:35:27] gone you will go and you will call
[1:35:29] Lazarus to come back to
[1:35:32] life but with this
[1:35:34] woman amen the prophet said that the
[1:35:36] father did not tell the son what was
[1:35:39] going to
[1:35:42] happen so that's why when she touched
[1:35:46] him Jesus felt
[1:35:48] it amen that took a virtue from
[1:35:52] Jesus in other words
[1:35:54] amen she transformed The Virtue that her
[1:35:57] faith was so
[1:35:59] strong Amen to take a virtue from
[1:36:03] Jesus and to apply it to our
[1:36:06] healing the prophet said that that is
[1:36:08] the same thing that happens to
[1:36:11] church when a preacher stands and
[1:36:13] started
[1:36:15] preaching sometimes they don't know what
[1:36:17] you going
[1:36:19] through they don't know what you're
[1:36:21] going not sometimes but they don't know
[1:36:22] what you're going through
[1:36:25] amen but in order for them amen to say
[1:36:29] exactly what you
[1:36:30] want you need to have a
[1:36:33] faith that will take that
[1:36:36] gift will take that
[1:36:38] virtue and apply it to your
[1:36:42] situation that's the thing that makes
[1:36:44] them feel weak
[1:36:45] sometimes because your faith is so
[1:36:48] strong it will take that
[1:36:51] virtue and apply it to whatever you
[1:36:54] want amen it's your faith that does
[1:36:57] it amen when brother Bram was doing the
[1:37:02] discernment the brother brandham I was
[1:37:04] reading it today this
[1:37:07] morning brother brandham said I wasn't
[1:37:09] because of my
[1:37:10] faith he was talking to a
[1:37:13] sister he said that if your
[1:37:17] faith let him amen tell me what you're
[1:37:21] going
[1:37:22] through then that will happen amen he
[1:37:25] didn't say because of my faith but he
[1:37:28] said that your
[1:37:30] faith will let him amen tell me what
[1:37:34] you're going
[1:37:35] through amen so it is your
[1:37:38] faith that operates the
[1:37:41] Miracles it is your faith amen that
[1:37:44] gives you whatever you
[1:37:46] want it is your faith amen that touches
[1:37:50] God am it's not your simple voice
[1:37:54] am it's not the physical contact that
[1:37:56] you
[1:37:57] have but it is the faith amen if it was
[1:38:01] physical amen then nobody will be healed
[1:38:04] right
[1:38:05] now because we can't touch him
[1:38:08] physically but we have to touch him by
[1:38:11] faith you have to raise your
[1:38:14] faith touch Jesus amen because I believe
[1:38:17] that he is here this
[1:38:19] morning because Jesus always come when
[1:38:22] we call him amen and when we started
[1:38:25] this this
[1:38:26] service we invited Jesus to
[1:38:29] come we call him to be among us we call
[1:38:33] him to hear our
[1:38:35] prayers call him to have the
[1:38:37] preeminence we call him to lead us we
[1:38:41] call him to lead the service so if you
[1:38:44] believe that Jesus is here just raise
[1:38:47] your faith amen let your faith touch
[1:38:52] him
[1:38:54] we let him know what you
[1:38:55] want that's the way you can communicate
[1:38:58] with himen it's with your Fai amen so
[1:39:02] just have faith amen because Jesus is
[1:39:05] here amen if Jesus went to Simon's
[1:39:09] house he knew that he will be mistreated
[1:39:12] at Simon's
[1:39:14] house he went anyway Amen to show you
[1:39:18] that every time you call him he will be
[1:39:21] there amen so what about this
[1:39:25] morning you raised up your voice to sing
[1:39:27] for
[1:39:29] him you responded to the
[1:39:32] service you responded to his
[1:39:35] word amen he's more than able to give
[1:39:38] you what you
[1:39:40] want just apply the
[1:39:43] faith apply the faith for your
[1:39:46] life amen apply the faith for the
[1:39:48] situation that you're going
[1:39:51] through the Bible says Matthew chapter
[1:39:55] 7 said that ask and it will be given to

[1:39:59] you seek and you will
[1:40:03] finden knock and it will be open to
[1:40:06] you amen for everyone who
[1:40:09] ask receives amen and the one who
[1:40:13] seeks finds and those and to the one who
[1:40:19] knocks it will be open amen oh which one
[1:40:24] of
[1:40:25] you if his son ask him for for
[1:40:29] bread will give him a
[1:40:32] stone or if he ask for a
[1:40:35] fish we give him a
[1:40:37] serpent if you
[1:40:40] then amen who are
[1:40:43] evil know how to give good gifts to your
[1:40:48] children amen how much more will your
[1:40:52] father
[1:40:54] amen who is in
[1:40:55] heaven amen give good things to those
[1:40:58] who ask
[1:41:00] him how much more your
[1:41:03] father amen call the B Jesus said that

[1:41:18] better it will give you even more than
[1:41:20] what you're
[1:41:22] asking

[1:46:16] faith amen I believe man said that Lord
[1:46:19] have my
[1:46:21] unbelief amen if you don't have faith
[1:46:24] you can pray to
[1:46:26] God Amen because faith is a
[1:46:29] revelation amen you can pray for to God
[1:46:31] for a revelation and God will give it to
[1:46:34] you so if you need Revelation for your
[1:46:37] healing you can pray to God for
[1:46:39] Revelation for your healing God will
[1:46:40] give it to
[1:46:42] you Abraham did not have faith by
[1:46:46] himself God gave him that revelation of
[1:46:49] Amen so the same God who gave him that
[1:46:51] revelation
[1:46:54] to have to give him faith for that 25
[1:46:56] years of
[1:46:59] waiting God will give you that same fa
[1:47:02] he's the same God who will give you that
[1:47:04] same
[1:47:06] Revelation had to ask for a
[1:47:08] son Abraham had to make his request
[1:47:12] known he said Lord listen here I am I'm
[1:47:15] getting old amen but I don't have an
[1:47:18] hair amen I don't have a son amen I need
[1:47:22] a son
[1:47:24] Abraham asked for it so if you believe
[1:47:27] that you are the Seed of Abraham through
[1:47:30] Jesus amen so you can also ask for what
[1:47:33] you
[1:47:34] want if your father asked for it amen
[1:47:37] and God gave him what he asked
[1:47:39] for so you can also ask for it and God
[1:47:43] will give you what you're asking for
[1:47:46] because he is the same God am he's not
[1:47:49] an he's not an historical God Amen why
[1:47:52] he didn't the past he's going to do it
[1:47:55] again amen the Bible gives keeps a
[1:47:58] record I believe of six women who did
[1:48:00] not who was Barren and God gave them
[1:48:05] children so if you find yourself in the
[1:48:07] same
[1:48:08] situation
[1:48:10] can your name will be under your name
[1:48:13] will be added to that record as
[1:48:16] well and people will be talking about
[1:48:19] you the way they're talking about
[1:48:21] Abraham
[1:48:23] but the Bible gives Bible keeps about
[1:48:25] the record of three times that that God
[1:48:28] had to divide the
[1:48:33] sea for his children to walk on dry
[1:48:37] land he did it with Moses he did it with
[1:48:41] Elijah he did it with elishah amen so if
[1:48:44] you find yourself in that same
[1:48:47] situation ask for it God will do it for
[1:48:50] you and you can add your name on on top
[1:48:53] of
[1:48:54] them amen there are numberous people
[1:48:57] being healed in the
[1:48:59] Bible amen if you need
[1:49:02] healing ask for it God will give you
[1:49:05] healing like we said it the other day
[1:49:09] the book of Acts is the only book in the
[1:49:12] New
[1:49:14] Testament that is not finished with an
[1:49:17] amen am which means that book is still
[1:49:20] still to be written amen you are the
[1:49:23] next writer of that
[1:49:25] book because your

[1:49:35] ask ask for it amen sometimes as a
[1:49:40] father I'm not a father yet but
[1:49:41] sometimes as a father I know it because
[1:49:44] I'm a
[1:49:45] child amen sometimes as a father I have
[1:49:48] my
[1:49:49] parents they will just give you
[1:49:51] something without asking for
[1:49:54] they just say well I thought about you
[1:49:57] and get this new suit and new shoes and
[1:50:02] whatever that's good amen I mean I'll
[1:50:06] receive the
[1:50:07] gift amen but Dad you know sometimes
[1:50:11] it's not really what I
[1:50:14] wanted amen but he will give me a
[1:50:17] gift I said thank you Dad and I will

[1:50:33] tuition amen and as my
[1:50:37] dad even though he doesn't have
[1:50:39] it he's going to work hard in order for
[1:50:43] him to give it to me amen sometimes God
[1:50:46] gives us with you know
[1:50:49] things the difference is when when God
[1:50:52] gives you something you really need it
[1:50:54] sometimes you just don't realize it but
