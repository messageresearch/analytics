that's brother Keith come open with a word of Prayer amen just remember sister just to Ruby's mother sister Ruby in the hospital here men keep her in prayer amen pshh ever wonder what I'm saying when I whisper in his ears it's always god bless you it's good to see you and the same to you they meant had a wonderful eye all started probably back last last Friday maybe before that but at work with a manacle workers had a real radical cancer and radical treatment very invasive and nothing seemed to work he's probably went from 250 one time down to about 134 and you know I always just lift him up to the Lord and just the Lord never showed me to go and pray with him to be alongside him it was very clear that was a Holy Ghost but last week on Friday unbeknownst to me I didn't know I was going downstairs to pray with him but I walked there and the Lord said go in there and sat down and just started talking with him and waited for the not to jump ahead and the Holy Ghost it's led being all utterance what to say it wasn't my words at all and I don't think this man would tell you at all that I was you know being a threat to his personal will but I just asked him to tell me what he thought were this was all going because his cancer was growing he had real bad cancer surgery and that it didn't seem to have an effect and literally opening Milkin lady and wide opening they kind of did wallpaper if you will on the insides of him and I had a couple doctors it was involved with it and he shared with me that he was praying which was really for this guy a big deal and he also said I really have hope that things are gonna be better and I said well and he's gonna go to the doctor on on the next day and I said what do you think the doctors gotta say from your x-rays and he said I think it's gonna get better and I said well can we just lift that up and kind of pray with you and he said absolutely and that was a big big thing because this man doesn't pray and so we prayed and all I can tell you is I went into a Holy Ghost revival I don't know if he knew it or not but there was a man there that's not all Christian or outside his office and and he says Keith it looks like you're having a real wonderful day you're really happy and you know for a person that's not a believer that that's a mr. big words a big testimony I believe that was God and I tried to walk upstairs on my I wasn't sure I was gonna be able to go because I just felt just words won't begin best supply me what I need to say but so I went in the office and sat down and just tried to clock myself well that he was gone next day doctor came back the next day and I you know we just wanted to hear or something because I knew something was had happened and so I went into his office and I said well Harley tell me about the doctor visit and he said well the doctor that was there that's always everything's half he said half cloudy and the other ones the doctors are half sunny type reporter and I it's kind of different Kuki HD I never heard of that before but he said the half cloudy guy was there and he said he reported that the cancer that was in my lung is completely gone and that the cancer that was in his kidney is was 25% reduced so I told him I said you know the devil would Lord just showed me the devil's I'm gonna give up he'll come right back at you and so that we just need to keep walking this together and and it was just beautiful I I gotta just tell you to make sure everybody's clear here in the witness before God this was not done this healing was not done by man it was done by the person Jesus Christ that work was done it was completed and there's you know those people may not ever heard of this the message they have prayed for this man I believe they all had in effect and I just thank God for placing those people in around him and I'll just continue to report the complete restoration and just bringing him more into the fall and not just praying but talking about the word and how it applies to him so good to hear about sister Ruby's mother are being cared for by the doctors and let's just go before the throne of grace lifting her and others up it have need if you have need to show the Lord he knows your thoughts he knows what your needs are before you lifted your hand probably God we come to you in the name of Jesus Christ under the shed blood of the Lamb and we thank you for your grace that wonderful blood we thank you for your wonderful word it was just established before the foundation of the world and we thanked it for the manifestation of your word father we thank you for you are the Jehovah God and the Old Testament manifested in Jesus Christ manifested in the spirit of Jesus Christ and/or your bride your wives Lord we thank you Lord for you work we thank you Lord for hearing the cries Lord go forth to those who are your seed that in the north and the south and the east and the west for drawing them Lord thank you Lord for the testimony Lord that you have been able to place in people's hearts that have seen the miraculous seen the manifestation of your words Lord and I pray father God that you continue to minister to them and show them that you are the deliverer that you are the mighty Conqueror that you've already defeated death hell and the grave and that whatever we bind here on earth and the name of Jesus Christ is bound in heaven and whatever you loose no one can shut that door and we thank you for your loosing the healings Lord for sister Ruby and the brother that we just witnessed about Lord each and every one of us Lord things that we don't even know we need but you Lord are there standing in the gap interceding for us Lord we thank you for doing that father we thank you for placing in us a love or not a love a fleshly love but the love of Jesus Christ and we thank you Lord for as I recall the grip some of the scripture you laid on my heart there last week was that the prayer of faith shall heal the sick and or not that wasn't my faith that was the faith that you gave me the faith that I received Lord healed the second that Lord you raised him out Lord and we thank you Lord for such love Lord you know exactly what it was going to take to bring him around Lord and we thank you Lord even for those or are in awe foremost believe that he was not going to be with us much longer I thank you for the one pound that he gained prior to the lost doctor appointment that one-pound so is precious and made him smile so much Lord but Lord that one pound is nothing compared to what you can give him and we thank you Lord for I pray father god you're just medium tonight Lord and continue to diminished her to him Lord I pray we take these type of opportunities not lightly but we be very sincere in our desire and crying out to God to be placed right where he wants us to be placed Lord I've been so sad that as I cried out to you that there hasn't been more manifestation of your word to seem to be so much there for a while and I just pray father God that it continues you showed me over and over and over since I've started crying out that you've heard the cry you've heard the prayer and we pray father God each one of us have that cry - to do what you'd have us to do and to be where you'd have us being go in the highways and byways and not just sit around waiting for them to come to us father you're the guide ER you're the provider you're the deliverer you're the healer we thank you Lord for this time tonight to receive your words of life we pull on you O Shah TI we desire for you to change us that we'd be not the same as we're earlier came in here and place upon us Lord a burden for the people Lord thinking for how long has it been since we prayed for those who are babies whose lives have been taken through abortion Lord how long has it been since we cried out inside for the abominations father God Oh God have mercy upon us for not crying out for those children they cannot even protect themselves father I pray tonight you'll just intercede wherever Lord's that somewhere save that child the child that's almost ready to go into an abortion Lord Oh God have mercy thank you Lord for hearing our cry lord I pray you stay that abortion that that not be preceded and you put a wall of fire on those children Lord and keep them from their lives be taken and I pray it's in some way Lord you can give us a testimony that lives were protected children that were going to be taken were not taken Lord we but we have faith Lord and what we just prayed we have faith that you are

destitute of the things that life demands water food and water shelter steals and according to his words [Music] [Music] [Music] hey we'll understand it better bye and we think the law for His grace and His mercy you may be seated just for the moment my wife was supposed to tell us testimony on what was that today Sunday and somehow it was I guess it was the will of the law for me to tell it so we thank God for His grace in His mercy but on our way out down to Louisville the first play we got on we were already on the runway we're picking up speed and all of a sudden the pilot stopped on brakes as if we had hit something and what had happened some kind of light turn on motor whatever I don't know but it was enough for him to haunt the plane right then so we had to deplane and so it took about two and a half to three hours for them to repair whatever that was wrong so after that time around 9:30 going on 10 we got aboard the plane again and this time even before we got on the runway the plane completely shut down and the emergency lights came on this was one trip I was glad my wife wasn't with me on and I don't I thank you so anyhow the pilot said well we can work through this and he worked through it and all of everything seemed like it started functioning well and so we got on the runway again this is the third time we going up everything looks good we clear the clouds I think it was around the time we loved it off is when we started losing cabin pressure so I looked and I looked down and I thought Lord I said Lord you didn't tell me I was going to die today hey I said to the Lord and then all of a sudden seeing how far we had to fall I didn't mind the dying but seeing how fall the drop was that's my heart stop fluttering a little bit I don't know whether I thought it or I said it but anyway something came perfect love casts out fear and just as sure as I thought it was saying it went away see it was just so much happening the lady the stewardess she's trying to act like she's not nervous and she's carrying on and everybody the body language is telling you she's she's out of control but prior to that prior to that before the everything started this lady was talking to someone in front of me and she looked at me and she says what is dad and she circled my face and I have been listening to prophet of God you know different messages I just was I was in the spirit of the Lord and she says it looks like and she started to say like she didn't say it but she did like that again and she put her hand on my shoulder and say you know thank you you're different you're different she said that and then that's when the trouble started all of a sudden the pilot call her back there and I don't know I was just smiling and praying and after that whatever left me she came back and I'm she said thank you I said all I c-can't be all right now I say it's gonna be all right and she said thank you thank you and then she went back again and started talking to everybody else but she couldn't keep her eyes off me she kept looking at me now I don't know what all she saw I think she saw the light of God I really do believe it because I told her you know when I told it was gonna be all right I said I'm a Christian you know what I mean and so she said we're gonna land we're gonna land you know you gotta brace yourself she teaching us how she said landing but she teaching us how to crash but they can't say we gonna crash they have to say we're gonna land so anyway she's teaching us how how to do everything and you know the Lord blessed because whatever the pilot did he got us in a place where everything then fall out and all that stuff so she said I don't know where we're gonna land but we got a land and and she said I'm and I'm looking at the wind and I see all the snow and ice you know so anyhow I wasn't worried God knows I wasn't because once the Lord gave me peace I was okay and after I told her we was okay then somewhere in this cuz everybody was trying not to get excited I think the stewardess was more excited she says we train for the stuff of which thing we know how to have she's trying to convince herself and I think everybody knew that so everybody else was quiet and I don't know what they were doing in the back of me but nevertheless a man when she found out that we were gonna land in Des Moines she was going to Des Moines the product out it under control and we're gonna land so now we don't need all of the fire trucks and all of the stuff that you just said all the thing and see we did we had no idea to had call on the fire trucks but she told us you know way of speaking and she came right back to me again she says thank you I really appreciate you so God showed her something and I'm thankful for that I told her I was a Christian you know when we got out there into into the what you call it terminal yeah she said it again and so I was gonna try to witness to her more but I think she's just too nervous to hear anything cuz she still was pressed but God God gave us peace and then there's one guy he was on there's a big guy he was up in first class he said where are you going I said I'm going to Louisville Kentucky he's a man and you gonna get back on another plane he said I would be calling me a cab on hooba I said it doesn't matter I said we gotta die anyway I said if it whether it be a plane or a car and God call you number that's it he probably he looked at me I don't know what he was thinking after that statement but nevertheless God prayer because my wife was feeling something and she was praying and then also brother Brad Burgess had called me prior and said that he was praying as well so there are prayers going up that I didn't even know nothing about for those of you who got anointed to pray during that time we appreciate your prayers God is good to us you know but I tell you what he has never failed me cuz he could have had me hysterical he could have had me just but soon is that perfect love casts out fear and you know what it didn't come from outside outside in it was from inside out and I thank God for that experience Amen cuz sometimes the enemy try to get to you worried do you have it you know do you do you have it like the Bible saying do you have it exactly like you know enough to make a rapture because I believe the rapture is at hand and I want to make sure I got what it takes to take a translation you know I just been listening to different messages letter stand and this is one of the things that God has given me to speak upon tonight those of you who may may know may not know I won't be here the Sun Sunday I've got to go to to Manitoba Canada up there to take care of some things and while there the pastor asked me in a minister so I would be ministering I'm not going to preach I'm going to settle some things with the couple there and so anyway anything to bring peace God's will be done Joshua please we're going to come from two passes of Scripture Joshua one six through nine and Ephesians 1 5 through 13 one amazing thing astounding things that I found in Louisville if you ever go down that way and you want a church to go to Brad Burgesses Church I would recommend he's a real godly man the house was full evening service full and you know what he said to me he said even on Thursday nights is full and I'm talking about 300 people are more gas and he said you know he doesn't even have trouble with people coming to church so I've got to get with him to find out what he's doing Lord God that sounds so good but they do believe in the Holy Ghost so and the Holy Spirit showed up praise the Lord Joshua 1 6 through 9 be strong and of a good courage for unto this people shalt thou divide for an inheritance the land which I swear unto their fathers to give them only be thou strong and very courageous he didn't just say courageous he said very courageous that thou made observe to do according to all the law and I'm gonna put it here to observe and do all according to the message which Moses my servant commanded thee which Elijah o brother branham my servant had commanded thee turn not from it to the right hand or to the left that thou may prosper whether so ever thou goeth this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth but thou shalt meditate therein day and night that thou may observe to do according to all that is written therein for then thou shalt make that way prosperous and then shalt thou shalt have good success I have not I commanded thee be strong and of a good courage as' chorus choose me be not afraid I like that neither be thou dismayed for the Lord thy God is with thee whether so ever thou go it it fees is 1 5 through 13 now he even he's emphasizing this and here it is these people are following the law is that right but Joshua the Holy Spirit a man is taking them over Ephesians 1 5 through 13 it is so important that he says observe it look at it study it meditate on it day and night amen and to do what not to gain just knowledge knowledge is good but it's no good if it's not applicable if you're not going to apply it it ain't gonna do you no good that right if he's just 1 5 through 13 haven't predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of His grace wherein he have made us what accepted in the beloved in whom we have the redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sin according to the riches of His grace wherein he have abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he had purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of time he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him now he's telling us a great thing here Paul is explaining some great mysteries here amen and by the grace of God amen we are part of it in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will his will not yours or mine is right that we should not be pray be the praise of his glory who first trusted in Christ that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in Christ in whom he also trusted after ye have heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation in whom also after that ye believed ye were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise father God we come before your Lord as humbly as we know how we thank you for your grace and your mercy we thank you for being so good to us O Lord you've been better to us than we've been to ourselves words cannot even express our gratitude Lord sometimes my body faints father when it comes to worship and praise because there is no expression that we can make Lord to let you know how much we love and care and thank you for your Redemption Lord bless the service tonight in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated I'm gonna be doing a lot of reading but I just want by God's grace your attention and trust by God that he will take the Word of God and really put it into your hearts in such a way that you'll leave here different lead tonight I entitled this message don't fear the battle and you know because a lot of time we we think that we're in control sometimes we forget it's God in control sometimes we forget is not by power not by might but by his spirit sometimes we forget is that him that will it no he that runneth but God who shows mercy so I thought by God's grace if I could just get us to see the way God allowed me to see how perfect his plans are and you and I must realize Amen this that God plan is not based upon somebody's theology God's plan is based upon his own purpose in his own will when we talk about predestination I think sometimes we forget what predestination really means but it means to be for Dane by a divine decree or purpose it means to be anointed and appointed to do God's will and his purpose so we realized that okay we established that by God's grace oh now we must realize that whatever God has spoken out of his mouth cannot come back boy what's ever written in the word the Bible says heaven and earth will pass away but the word of the Lord shall stand and if you can see yourself tonight as bride that means God has given you that revelation not in your head but in your heart so if you can see that tonight then you need to come to a place of rest that he that began a good work in you is faithful to complete it you're not the completing portion of it God completes you is that right but I look at this now because you you've got to understand that God Joshua let's start with the scripture here with Joshua and when Joshua is the type of Jesus it's a type of the Holy Spirit we realize a man that here God had already chosen Moses and God told Moses what his calling was even though Moses refused at the beginning because he felt inadequate to do God's work but we find out that that it wasn't that God that Moses was adequate it was that God made him adequate it was because God stepped into Moses and that's why Moses was able to do what God wanted him to do likewise you and I must understand even though we are the thoughts of God even though we have God has predestinated us when we come into this dimension we cannot do what God wants us to do until the word in us is quickened you see what I'm saying in other words Jesus though he was the word he was not only the word he was God but that same word needed to be filled it needed to be quickened by the spirit that we call father is that right it took the Holy Ghost to come down and declare this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased to dwell in so we realized by God's grace it was after being Jesus ministry started he went into the wilderness and you and I know that no natural man could fast 40 days and 40 nights without the help of the Lord or leadership of the Holy Spirit so we realized amen being children of God being attributes of God we didn't know this you are the mystery of the whole entire Bible Christ in you the hope of glory Ephesians picks it up Paul who was a prophet of God was able to pick it up and he's now showing the Gentiles where they fit in in the plan of God right amen the world at large and did meet making it different whether he was an MRI da Canaanite ax here a parasite or whatever knew that the Jews worship did you hold of God they saw him on display they felt his wrath they knew his kindness toward Israel y'all remember that email and you see but Israel needed to keep in mind who they were because it was the enemy that kept up occupying their minds with with nonsense you understand me that's why God said it to Israel when you go through the land don't look to the left nor the right you just keep straight so you said well what do you mean brother Brooks you got to understand that the whole principle of the Bible is the thought of God his old theme he's the theme of everything right and if we could follow him we can go back to Genesis and I love Genesis because Genisys does something there in Genesis that is out of the context or seem to be something that God put a little delay on it to to make something seen in other words God could have created Adam and Adam and separated them so they could both be seen but there was a mystery in the mind of God that he wanted to put on delay right that if you look at it Adam was actually made on the sixth day and before the sixth right in the sixth day between the sixth and the seventh if I could say it like that Amen God divided something I could say like this he he ripped that seal open and in opening that seal which which was Adam which was a man under the sixth seal was revealed his bride who she was is that right and so Adam was the only one that could actually tell Eve where she came from hallelujah Amen because Adam was in the image of God he was literally God on earth so Adam said to Eve you're born of my bone and flesh of my flesh in other words you're not a chimpanzee you're not a monkey you're not a ring thing you came from me it was God's expression free expression of himself that at the end right but the sixth seal between the sixth and the seventh seal which you see the seventh seal was a day of rest right in between the sixth and seventh seal God was going to unveil his bride a mystery that he held from the beginning of time even heaven didn't know what God was doing hmm so you see we were we're right here and I want to take my time because you and I we ought to be just shouting the glories of God because first of all if you bribed your bride and if you're not you're not and only god knows who that but if you can gather within your heart and mind that you came from God and you go back to God you've got something that most people don't have we don't fear the bottom we're not fearing the battle the battle is going to come and the battle is now but you don't feel Lord I'm gonna be lost don't fear the battle because you cannot be lost those who work with God in the beginning cannot be lost he said you didn't choose me I chose you that's what he said he said Israel I didn't choose you because you look so wonderfully and we're so beautiful and great in number matter of fact you were small in number few in number I chose you now that that gives me something to know that God chose me the perfect God chose me so therefore his choice of choosing me is perfect his choice of choosing you is perfect right iris all in the word with brother branham called this message he called it the Feast of the Messiah and when I saw that the Feast of the Messiah I saw what Jesus was leading the people up to all along and when he began there and Saint John since he says I am The Living bread which came down from heaven If any man eat of this bread he shall live forever and the bread that I give is my flesh which I give for the life of the world now watch this because he's going to go down here and he's gonna say a few things amen they kind of throw the Jews off because they can say well our Father did eat manna in the wilderness and Jesus got an answer for them because you realize amen this was still a tight right let me put it this way God is a God of amor faith and in the Garden of Eden how did God stand where was he because you know God is in all you know he's always a part of the drama the very theme of the whole Bible is God or Christ however you want to put it but he didn't create the Garden of Eden and leave himself out right now he shows himself he meant in such a way he's working with Adam as a man but he also working has the Tree of Life but as the Tree of Life he's just standing there is that right cuz brother Balaam said the tree of life is a person said it was Jesus Christ God in our favor he stood there as the Tree of Life remember that God is a God that doesn't force you to do anything he always gives you a choice and that was the thing that he gave to Adam and Eve a choice now you said well what do you mean let me say it like this it does not say that II was instructed by Adam take not to eat up of that tree but she was in Adam when God spoke that's why the Word of God when it comes to you and strikes the seed is somehow sounds familiar it makes sense because in Adam was Adam and she heard what God said it Adam even in that fall so when God separated Adam and Eve amen even Adam was on one Accord there was no sin there was no confusion and you say well how could she understand her husband if he didn't tell her what the law said the same way Adam understood God when it came to naming the animals they were one spirit is that right oh come on somebody when Jesus talked with his disciples he said you know it all things no so you and I must understand this mystery is deeper than what you can imagine it takes us the revelation of Jesus Christ this is why it's so important to get the Holy Ghost because without the Holy Ghost you can't channel into the beginning and you'll never understand the ending it is the Holy Spirit who is God himself once he's he's in you you become as he is and you understand all things you might say well oh Lord I don't understand in your soul your soul knows the truth then he go on the Jews therefore strong among themselves saying how can this man give us his flesh to eat then jesus said unto them verily verily i said to you except you eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood he have no life in you didn't it funny because the bible said if G if Adam and Eve had Pro take up the Tree of Life they would have lived forever there's only one eternal life it shows that Jesus Christ he is the same tree of life and because he could not offer life if he wasn't like who so who whoso eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood heavy eternal life and I will raise him up at the last day now she's the same thing so eating over here in Genesis it's the same thing is eating over here it means to partake to protect that word to eat up that word and he said what do you mean but we realized by God's grace or when he says now you eat it you partake of it that's why we understand the Serpent's eat because there was another tree the tree of good and evil and that was the tree in which they ate off and put took of and we are evidence that they did it because of our lives right because of our struggles let's move on so whoso eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood have eternal life and I will raise him up at the last day whoso a brother didn't they eat manna in the wilderness but that was just a shadow in a tight because you realize they said the matter means what is it but we're not saying what is it because now we know what it was cuz Jesus says I am the head of what is it and we have a I am because of the manifestation of the real bread of life hallelujah Oh somebody help me here so when you and I realize a man that this whole feeling of power God when you realize that this whole entire Bible and the theme of this Bible the principles of all of this was to bring and manifest the coming of the Lord and the expression of the Jesus Christ in bride for Jesus didn't said unto them very well I said you except ye eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood ye have no life in you now what is the son of man it is the purpose of God God wanted to be a son in order for him to be a son he had to create him a body of a man and when he created the body of a man he did step into that man God Himself the Bible said the fullness of the Godhead bodily dwelt in him that was the difference between any ordinary man because every son of man at some point in time was full of God that's why they call him the son of man because he was a prophet not D prophet but a prophet and Jesus Christ comes along and he is the son of man which is the prophet of all prophets because son of man is another term you just what you say you would say is God in man form that makes him a son amen so whosoever eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood have eternal life and I will raise him up at the last day but my flesh is meat indeed my blood is drink indeed he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood dwelleth in me and I in him as a living father have sent me and I live by the father so he that eateth me even he shall live by me now understand what I'm saying now Jesus Christ he's got up amorphic he from a tree to a man right and you know then he comes along he says I was that water was he the water he said it was so he was he said I was that rock was he that rock he was that rock cuz he said he was hallelujah now he says I'm the brain hallelujah and don't you know you couldn't know Jesus when he would get his disciples together and have a communion he was letting him know where they came from whoo hallelujah that's why he took one loaf of bread on eleven and you heard me say before he broke it in pieces and he gave each one eat it all up in other words don't waste any of this because it's life in it hallelujah and he but that was an innate reform that was in a ceremonial phone when we do that here that's why I love communion it's in a ceremonial phone but in reality you are protecting of God and God is for taking of you in that day you know that I'm in the father the father's in me and I am in you you are taking of him he's protecting of you and you having communion Oh somebody help me it is the greatest love affair ever just in a ceremonial part of communion because those fragments are now is that right the Bible said he's he's gathering everything isn't that Colossians he's going to gather everything in heaven and in earth that that which is he is part of him what is he doing he bringing everything back to one loaf one body that's why he's a man does not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God why because the word becomes the Living bread and you must eat of the bread you can't be in the message if you don't even study it you must read it amen because it's been instructed by John eat the whole book you must study it you must eat it you must observe it like the commission was given to Joshua that Commission is given to us hallelujah whoo see they had the natural and we have the spiritual listen what brother William says in Redemption Redemption in completion completeness he says now that bread never did cease it went all the way through the journey for them that's right and was perfect type of Pentecost in us that was in the natural the bread never did cease it stayed the same bread until they entered the promised land is that right the church was inaugurated at at the day of pentecost and when the believer was up there and there came how to sound like a rushing mighty wind feel the house where they were setting the same Holy Ghost that fell then Falls now it will play it will go plumb on from that time to the end time it'll go right on through it's our bread the Holy Ghost is our bread they were fed with natural bread we are fair with spiritual bread is that right he said what do you mean remember brother Branham said the very same camel that Rebecca watered remember there's two things she watered she first water Ella easier therefore you must continue to keep the message alive and how do you keep the message of life by watering it anointing it proclaiming it you can't be the same of it you understand me because if you're saved you're refusing Ella ease of the water the second thing that she wanted was the camel itself and brother Mel said that camel is the Holy Ghost the very beast that took any easier - Rebecca is the same beasts that take Rebecca to Isaac so how do you order the Holy Ghost but praise my Thanksgiving by shouting you keep the Holy Ghost alive you cannot be ashamed but the Holy Ghost if God wants you to say hallelujah in the grocery store you gotta say it hallelujah if God wants you to shout on the speed you must shout hallelujah that's how you order it by allowing him to have his way hmm the church jesus said I am the bread of life that come from God out of heaven they said how father's eaten manna in the wilderness hallelujah for space of 40 years they said their one their every one day yes sir but he that eats my flesh and drinks my blood has everlasting life and I raised him up in the last day I am the bread of life that comes from God hello you must understand that everybody has not eaten up eating the same bread bread in itself in in term it could be cabbage meat is his food and God had the profit to store up food and the food was thrown up on tapes and books hallelujah because he knew there was a famine coming in the land see that's why the Bible said if you meditate on if you study it and do an observant you'll be like the widow woman that woman a man who only had a little bit of meal in all your left and he lied to came and said give me and make me a cake first I understand me she prospered because she kept her faith alive brother M said when she started the fire she got two sticks together and she formed that old rugged cross and she set some fire to it y'all hear me salvation is not watered down it must be fire in order to cook this word in order for this word to be digested it must have fire this messaging did it's a lie and I'm so glad by God's grace amen that we are the people that God has ordained to keep it alive hello is that right God ordained Eliezer to keep it alive when Israel was up on Mount Carmel when Israel had died almost most of them was worshipping Bale Eliezer came and said it's time for a showdown hallelujah my god is the same he's Hebrews 13:8 he's the same yesterday today and forever he's a God that changes not and he do not believe in the idolatry is that right oh that's on the Lord's side let him come over here he said let the God that is God let him answer by fire hallelujah they built seven altars is that right they built it up hallelujah and they started a man with faith and virtue and knowledge and went all the way up hallelujah but and then the Bible said he took the water now that's the strange thing let me tell you something we say he's water in a thirsty land and that's what my god he is he's water in a thirsty land you thirst for God study a word read your earth and I guarantee you he'll give you something to drink pour in all that water the question is they was in a family hadn't rained and where did that water come from up on the mountain where did it come from the same place that Ram came from that he was still Jehovah Jireh the same place the round came from with with with Abraham is the same place that water came from who somebody help me here so we realized by God gracious it but if you eat my flesh and drink my blood has everlasting night and I raise him up in the last day come on somebody now The Living bread is back the Son of Man the same one that told those Pharisees if you eat my flesh and drink my blood the same one came in the endtime hallelujah closed and rolled it meant in a in a prophecy garment hallelujah and he said except you eat my flesh and drink my blood you have no life in you but this time in what literal Braille it wasn't something made at home it wasn't something cooked in the man-made oven hallelujah but this bread came down from Helen he said I came from God and I go back to God hallelujah amen and so now we're eating up the real son of mayhem in world foam hallelujah but that same word is quickened by the Holy Ghost and when it's quickened by the Holy Ghost it brings light to your soul feasting this supposed to be a feast a real feast when you're in a feast the only time you might get sad is when you overheat hallelujah but when you own a feast and all that y'all know how y'all we do and some of us this deer goes to the all-you-can-eat hallelujah you see all that good food and you say to yourself I'm not going to get any of that chocolate cake but somehow the vibrations of that chocolate can't keep coming to you and eventually if you stay there long enough you find yourself at the counter I'm just gonna get me a just a little piece hallelujah but that is the way when it comes to how many y'all have ever read the word you studying you feel so good and all of a sudden you get tired and you don't want to go to sleep because it's really good and all of a sudden something allows you to read something else and it quickens you and all of a sudden you eating more than when you thought you're not ready to go to bed now you can't even go to sleep that's the way it is with God hallelujah oh my god you and I must understand when God sent the prophet of God he was making his last move toward the Gentiles and it may look like we're out of step or out of time but we are exact to where God wants us to be y'all hear me and I want to say this by the by God's grace we're looking at all of these things that are happening amen in the United States and all over it's all over the world people are totally insane did you know brother Branham said it would be he said the only people that will have their sanity is the bride of Jesus Christ and folks it is that way now don't say it's bad like it was inside of my we have passed that time it's the darkest before darling that's where we are we're right at the break that they break hallelujah now watch this because your glory or the glory that shall be revealed in you cannot be expressed until it's darkest before dawn it has to be a night time a time where the darkness seems to overshadow everything is that right it doesn't matter how black the sky years when no Stars gonna shine they gonna shine and so God shows their wickedness the most wicked is aged the darkest shade the darkest time ever he didn't even let the Prophet remain here is that right you say find that scripture Lee because when Rebecca saw Isaac he's a step top back he stepped off the scene y'all understand I'm saying Rob because now it was a relationship between Rebecca and Isaac and Rebecca the Bible said it was it was him immediately y'all knows the truth when we saw this message it was actually love at first sight we couldn't get enough of it we stayed up all night talking about it even we had to go to school and go to work yeah it was love at first sight hallelujah and the thing about it is you know what did we do we we we we went into Oz extent is that right and what Isaac stint was who's his mother's 10 the old-time way the way that was a foul datian the solid way and that's why we do what we do but how come how come you do it he was ordained to do it he was predestinated to do it he was chosen by God elected by God to do it you can't help it is that right sometimes we don't you know we feel a little bit like Jeremiah I ain't gonna preach my MA I can't I'm tired I'm really stubborn make me stick people I can get you know I'm quitting some preachers know what I'm Tom I know you get so wearing is so tired you want to retire but there's no retirement in this you know that's the way Jeremiah felt he's like oh my god you tricked me you told me I was going to be turned down and crushing down and building up but you didn't tell about all the suffering you didn't tell me he was gonna beat me you didn't tell me he was gonna throw me in jail you didn't tell me to go do all this stuff to me it is what it is and God came through anyhow and I am so thankful for G when you and I realize that God is doing a great thing and we must understand that when we're feasting on the bread of the Lord we must understand is finished hello God didn't give them bread undone the bread was well cooked hello it didn't need anything added or anything taken from it it was already perfect y'all hear me the bread the word the message is perfect is all ready cooked the only thing we need to do is partake of it when you are in a feast let me say it like this if those who are chosen and elected by God will always understand that they are nothing god don't care about you he needs your house you should work yeah Paul says I count everything dung it's not I that live sheet that I had died I don't live anymore it's not hard that live but Christ that lives in me let me tell you something there is no way that Christ can live in you and nobody knows it you ought to know it if no one else knows it only brothers the other day with how I was preaching how they were slouching in the chair and all that first off I don't want know about a thing I pick I'm saying your body language tell god what you what you're saying what you're doing your body language will express your appreciation before God you can't slouch in church you gotta you gotta be governing when the boss says lift your hands and praise when you laugh I catch myself sometime and I lock my head when you lock your hands that's the enemy he's trying to keep you from your locking something up in you something is happening on the inside of you and your outward expression is you're expressing it that's what I'm saying don't do it because something's happening in you and I find that that's why I was praying for the sister and she had her hair like this I said no no no sister I said do this raise your hand because that's surrender there's a spirit now that's locking hear something that's telling you or doing something that's keeping something from being released unto the Lord so when you see yourself walking down you gotta unlock it's habit it's something we do but we don't realize that something is making us do that y'all remember just the other day when she went with us and how the spirit broken things started happening because we didn't realize what what we were doing God is really sensitive to that and I wouldn't have said nothing but I'm getting closer to God when finished at lettuce here listen phiston bread I want to say these things when finished and later see later see an age according to revelation 10 the mystery of all the Bible would be gone to what the bride is that right listen close now uh-huh bride called out by the word Christ Himself calling out the bride making plain 13 and 8 Hebrews 13 and 8 that he's the same yesterday today and forever does the same is the same he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also luke 1730 also Malachi 4 Hebrews 4 and 12 all the scriptures that promise this is to be between the sixth and the seventh seal and the sixth and the seventh trumpet do we realize what we're saying brother Branham said there's only one truck well something left the only thing that's left there's one more thing left before the bride takes off because between that six and seven all the mysteries are revealed remember he comes to the seventh seal and the Bible tells us that at that time it was a space of a half-hour how did her so many people try to explain that and brother Branham comes right in the word and tells you that that half-hour is not only just given to the Jews but it is the going away of the bride so in that sense out of silence it is the catching a way of the bride because no man know the day nor the hour brother Adam said but when Jesus rose from the dead he received it why would he received it because he's the one that's coming back for us he knows the date right is that right the young man who was coming back for the bride on the ranch and then he went his father that came back for her it was he came back for her he knew the day he knew the time he knew the hour guess what and so did she hello she knew it she stood there the same day in the doorway waiting that's the mystery and without the Holy Ghost you will not see his coming that's why you've got to have the Holy Ghost it is the sense of that that de bras got when dangers around they know how to get away from the wall the Holy Ghost is your heavenly sense will tell you amen you and I will know is that right because the Bible said that he will not come to us as a thief in the night but without the Holy Ghost you're gonna be distracted so many things go come your way you and I must learn amen to get free all over again hallelujah it's okay listen he goes on he said the Pentagon Sophie's finishes at the period of the trumpet seventh trumpet for the next is the coming of the seventh seal for the next is the mystery of the coming of Christ also the trumpet is sound for the Jews and what people didn't know that experience Lee and people call it I want to use that name but people fail to see that when Jesus at the opening of the seals when when when when it's summer when it thundered and seven thunders uttered their voices they fail to see that was Christ look it up brother Brown said the seventh seal is Christ hmm hello and they failed to see that when with that thing that happened out there in in Arizona and New Mexico whoever it was and the angel came down and picked brother Branham up and this is the way it was a pre rapture you asked me because where and how did this man be caught him into a constellation swiped off the earth nobody knew where he went he was gone and he said he was caught up into a constellation of angels not in the natural because the natural man couldn't go there no flesh and blood shall enter into so just in a moment stop you said God came dude he could do it if God can raise up Lazarus and caused him to live and die again if God can take Enoch and translate him if God can take Elijah and transform him Transplant him on the Mount of Transfiguration God could do that too but the reality of it was so that hold that perfection of God the seals that's what that's why problems it'll give you route during faith it is here so you can see it's like Adam Santa eat you're balding my bone and flesh of my flesh you were protected by me somebody help me here oh Jesus darling vindicated y'all hear me Christ the world has been thoroughly vindicated brother Branham couldn't have been just anybody his ministry declared that he wasn't y'all hear me see the Holy Ghost come to vindicate your bride i'ma say it again the Holy Ghost comes to vindicate that you are bride if the Holy Ghost that you have is not vindicating your bride something's wrong you understand me the Holy Ghost and i'ma tell people just like a trying to tell the folks I'm not saying you're not saved I'm not saying you haven't come up to faith the virtue but did you know the Bible said if you like any of these you will for you will forget that you have been once purged from your sins so the back and forth and back and forth could be just one thing missing and the Bible says that you are brother said a man is as weak as his weakest link as strong as its weakest link whatever the link is where you weak you gotta fight you gotta fight oh I got a few things here ah I'm trying to hurry so I won't miss nothing listen coming from where what shall I do with Jesus called Christ he is thoroughly a vindicated he is thoroughly identified the word of this hour the promise of this hour now understand if brother Branham has been thoroughly vindicated there Mars and they have to be a Rebecca somewhere and repair was thoroughly vindicated you say how because when she met Isaac she was wearing the jewels that Isaac's it come on ma and listen whether you realize it or not these are jewels these virtues are jewels in his spiritual form and you and I must understand that when we when Isaac when we meet him at that finality and that 1/2 hour of silence that time oh my god remember I told you in the sixth seal brother branham actually equated or brought it out that the great earthquake I'm thinking is six a fifth but he brought out that when that great earthquake took place how Jesus was raised from the dead and the Saints rose up and he brought it back to the earthquake that we're getting ready to have in California and everybody's looking around like what I told people I said you ain't stirred up something's wrong with you Washington State can have an earthquake a few weeks ago and ain't nobody stirred up that's too close to home that's like moving one pedal before the final pedal pebble huh and to know that every conglomeration everything I just heard a man say don't you know the United States will no longer remain the United States as it is because somewhere in the scripture she disappears revelation 13 tells us brother Elm tells us when that earthquake happens the islands going somewhere just disappear the whole mess will change America will never be on the topic bottom just as much as Sodom and Gomorrah just as much as Canaan I mean all the other cities Capernaum is what I meant to say yeah all those cities just like they once were on top like Egypt once was on top but because of their sins where are they now you got to dig me so many meters down justifying a city and where he we are here this is lemon read on not the promise of Luther our that was it then that was a word in the former reformers age as you all who have heard the seven seals when the reformer age went out the beasts with the with the face like a man organization issued but this is the face of the eagle the beast that went to make the challenge today and who would dare to say that wasn't the inspired Word of God is that right you said what do you mean brother branham challenged him or they challenged brother branham they had that secret meeting god told him about it told him where everybody was going to be sitting is that right he preached they made it on the path back to 38 and everything else and he said to those men he said if you want to think however he said it you come stand by my right side a man why he knew that's where the angel was standing and they knew that's where the angel was standing he said nobody move and he says I thought so yeah then get off my back what was it it was the Eagle challenging the Beast of the system hallelujah and guess what he won ha it was ordained so God knew from the beginning of time that meeting was going to take place hallelujah and just like that when when our challenge come you don't have to fear the battle Elijah didn't feel all those Baylor worshipers mattify he brought the challenge all of them hallelujah the God that is God let him ask about fire see you and I don't have to fight we don't have to run listen let me hurry up cousin kids turn oh my you know people don't see brother banner being the messenger of this hour then unless you can do about that I wondered and if you've done your best to share with people and they don't see it ain't nothing you can do about it none of us can save it save anybody but being I've having eyes to see the Bob you if you can read it you bless if you can hear it you're blessed think about it when God called Abraham I'm almost done when God called Abraham fifteen and one says and these things the word of the Lord came unto Abram in a vision saying fear not Abram I am that shield and that exceedingly great reward I love it why amen Bible said that Abraham looked for a city whose builder and maker is God he was the same way with brother Adam like brother brand my brother brother man was like him Lord I seen Billy Graham building I see all robbers building and Lord look at my little tent God said what it is to you I am your portion that's what he was telling Abraham Abraham I will make you a wealthy man but don't forget I am your portion hallelujah don't you see this oh my every time I think about that it does something to me hallelujah I may not have a fine car fire I may not own nothing but the Lord is my portion you understand he turn arises my portion being with him in that city is my portion hallelujah you know all that he has is my portion what is a mansion that means nothing but when I got God is my inheritance y'all know what I'm saying he is my inheritance all at all the omnipotent the creator of all things that the writer of this Bible the you name he is ooh think about it even when it came to Hagar and Ishmael remember Sarah running him out and they were in need let me tell you someone you in need God is your portion if you just seek the Lord the Lord will fight your battles ooh Oh mine and here was oh this is what I love about it when Hagar was crying out to the Lord God didn't say hey God I heard your cry y'all read it you know what he said I heard the cry of the baby I heard the cause I heard the crying child he never said I heard you hear I heard the crying child that was a child but he was thirsting for something and God said I'm gonna come down and bless him anyhow is that right people think that none of those Ishmael I sayin ain't gonna be saved yes they will because the Bible said every Kidron every tongue and every nation God had to work something through him thank God for that hallelujah Jesus because it mean reality spiritually we were the wild man hallelujah is that right even when Moses he said Moses fear ye not stand still and see the salvation of the Lord which he will show to you today for the Egyptian who you have seen today ye shall see them again no more hallelujah what did Moses do did he fight those Israelites did he fight those Egyptian hallelujah all he had to do is stretch out the rod all he had to do was to keep the word straight hallelujah and God fall for him hallelujah Lord of God there is no fear in love but perfect love casts out fear because fear hath torment he that feareth is not made perfect in love hallelujah you don't fear the battle huh David says all you uncircumcised philistine you go bring a challenge to the Almighty God davidon look at the challenge being unto him he realized your challenge in the garden is I am I don't care that the god the devil of cancer the devil the tuberculosis the devil of high blood pressure I don't care what it is hallelujah my God is the conqueror he's always been the conqueror he said I fight your battle hallelujah he's the one that's doing hallelujah we we don't have to be afraid of it is that right David said he's my buckler and my shield I'm hiding behind the shield of God is that right the boss said he'll hide me in the shelter of his wing [Applause] I'm almost done don't fear the battle hallelujah and why won't to ask something why did he just see these things because they was not elected why didn't he eat chips and see these things because they was not elected God told Abram ham before it happened get it you see you sleep in church God told Abraham before it happened did not God tell you God has already told us what's going to happen he told us the beginning and the ending and I already told you how can you come out as a loser when God didn't already showed you what the end of the book is and call upon : that's what possible y'all don't understand you're more than conquerors because Christ is already conquered for you you're more than conquerors don't fear the devil always work you Steven God told Abraham before what happened your seed will sir join in Egypt for 400 years and I bring them out that's the reason they seen it because they were elected to see it there the election Israel was elected to see the sign of God and they went out of Egypt where the unbelievers punished were perished and today God is calling his elected the spiritual seed of Abraham by the faith that he had in the Word of God don't you see the spiritual seed today that don't see that that don't see the elected church intellectual church it sees the word and is being called from those big denominations into the presence of Jesus Christ was that clear did you get it alright we'll go further the elected only can I read one more God told him way down in Egypt I give you that land but he didn't say I go out there and sweep it all out and garnished the houses and hang up the curtains and everything you all just move in no no they had to fight for every inch of ground they took that's right fighting and take it by every fight every inch but he said every that's the problem everybody wants some yards he say inches little by little you come to the devil little by little everywhere the sole of your foot land that's Poe's possession footsteps in possession that's the same thing it is today divine healing me loans to us the Holy Spirit belong to us it's our property hello is our property but you'll fight every inch of it yes sir brother foot steps in possession just keep fighting take it the devil says the day of miracles has passed say you were lying God said he's the same yesterday today and forever take it over every your footsteps that's possession that's right oh I have so much more but I out of my upper cut but I will say one more thing in i'ma let you go and Nehemiah I love Nehemiah cuz they they they knew they were they were they were already predestinated you know Ezra Nehemiah and all of them Daniel they knew after 70 years was up they were going to be set free and then God anointed Cyrus Oh a man see that's what we don't we missing that you know but that's the truth how how they took a last Trump they took Trump and they put sours and Trump on the same coin because they're the Jews and not a spiritual they took they know that Trump when Trump announced that they were now a nation it was legally legally signed all right that Israel not only just a nation but they got land that's the same thing Cyrus did and when Cyrus did that he released those Jews to come back to rebuild Israel and the temple hallelujah and that's exactly what's happening now they making coins they're doing all the things and their purpose is to rebuild that temple now understand if they're in the process of doing that don't you know that that our our translation is right on the edge right on the edge and what people don't realize is that Trump must do what he's doing in all he's either disturbance he's disturbing everything but all of this disturbance is is to run the Jews back home and bring the bride together see they've been wrong with all because you know I think the United States we we still hold such majority of a large amount of Jews they need to go home and if God has to collapse the economy to get the Jews back at home that's what he's gonna do whatever he does it's gonna run them home and he's gonna run us home but our home is gonna be all our needs cry out to God hallelujah and at that time the third pole was coming to his full face then when we have a Mount Zion showdown because that's when the church will declare they are God they're the Queen of Heaven but here is that little group following the messenger of Elijah with a double portion of his spirit brother Wendell said I believe during that time he said limbs will be regrown I got the coke huh hallelujah not tomorrow is now and you lies about what we do now what are we doing what are we supposed to be doing we supposed to be preparing ourselves we didn't heard from the rancher son he done told us he gonna marry us and we need to be working toward our garment what is your garment yeah those virtues because that's what brother Don said the only thing you're not going to carry with us is character and that character won't be your own it will be the character of Jesus Christ and this is the expression of His divine nature hello you love the Lord Nehemiah and then it says you know what we gonna fight we gonna build us wall but I'm gonna have a weapon in my one hand and I'm gonna have an instrument of work in my other in other words I ain't afraid of the enemy and while he's preparing to come to fight me and tear me and stop me I'm gonna keep building this wall while the devil is trying to stop me from building I'm gonna keep on building but I'm gonna keep on fighting and I'm not afraid of the battle don't fear the battle the battle is not your said the Lord less than you know I meant no harm all I'm saying is people of God is getting so late and I think you know the more you pull from God you don't have to feel it the Bible says a sacrifice of praise God God loves sacrifices of praise and so you know that what you need to do because I'm gonna tell you something if we set still we get sleepy we'll get you know the devil of fairness and but when we get and they start praising God the blood thought it flowing and God stars anointing and then you'll see God come in in a mighty way he's not pleased with lukewarmness he's not he's not pleased with us being cold he won't fire in this place and in order for father come you got to bring your own link don't wait on nobody else bring your only I'd rather see one person then you know then nobody's hardly saying nothing and I know God wants the fruits of your lips praising while you can because one of these old days you know this lips gonna be sealed you can't praise him in the grade you gotta praise him now we don't know the next time we're gonna be afflicted or whatever and can't get up a king saying that and all we can do is moan mmm I was up there there I'm like Lord you didn't tell me I was gonna die today but you know what I said I started singing and praising God cuz if I'm gonna go down I'm going down with a praise that lady look at me like I'm crazy I was spouting loud and I don't know where how my face look to her but I was just smiling because I realized one thing I had it right whichever way it would have gone out with I would've had it right he came on the scene God is so good to us in moments like thee I'll sing out of song I'll sing so to Jesus in moments like these I lived on my head I'll lift up my hands to you singing it [Music] oh my lord we love you tonight we praise you because you're worthy of all praise at this moment we'll take up our tithes and offering my mother my father my sister let's say you get here oh he's everything to me yes he's it oh he's everything to me eat my father mother my brother everything to me he a boy they're everything to me mother mother he a man brush up his man just e.g the holy honor every [Music] majesty okay name authority Oh Flo promise true to his old so exhaust my knee fire I'm Gloria ah Christ Jesus Turkey Oh worship His Majesty Jesus who died oh Jesus who died now glorified [Music]
