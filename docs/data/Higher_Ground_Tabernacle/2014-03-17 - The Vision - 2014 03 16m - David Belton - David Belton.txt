amen so if we we from South Carolina Isaiah said and we uh have a wife lovely wife and three wonderful Sons the Lord blessed us with amen we're just living by the mercy and grace of God we appreciate God's mercy and Grace and his loving kindness toward us amen so uh as we stand and honor the reading of the word greetings from the Saints back home moment we Pastor assembly there New Covenant gospel

author and the finisher of our faith Lord and as we come this morning Father we don't even know what you have in store for us but you promis whever two or three are gathered you will be in our midst Lord you taught us how to pray when you walked here on Earth in flesh 2,000 years ago you asked us to pray Our Father who are in heaven give us this day our daily bread so we are asking you to give us this day our daily bread because we need this bread each and every day Lord for Spiritual strength so Lord we we pray that you have that on way search our hearts anything is not like you we pray that you rooted up in the name of Jesus Christ we pray that nothing hinder the moving of your spirit Lord oh God and we pray for each and everyone that's here and those that had a desire to be here and somehow didn't make it Lord we pray for your people around the world we give you all the praise the glory and honor in the precious name of Jesus Christ we pray and we thank you amen amen as we we enter into Book of Proverbs 29 and Proverbs 29 and verse Verse 18 Proverbs 29 Verse 18 where there is no vision the people perish but he that keepeth the law happy is he may the Lord add a blessing to the readings of his words you may be seated amen say where there is no vision the people perish but he that keepeth the law happy is he amen we want to speak a little on the vision amen the vision amen you know you could study you can have 50 sermons amen you could study for days and weeks yes sir we just want God's inspiration amen we want the Lord to have his way we can have we could have many notes yes sir we could have quotes we could have many scriptures written out amen but we just want God to be on the scene to bless our hearts to meet our every needs amen cuz that's what it's all about it's not about our own thoughts but his thoughts it's not about our own ways but his ways it's not our own will but his will amen amen so so pray for us this morning amen we're glad to be here we've been having a wonderful time in Fellowship amen it's been joyous to be here amen so so here we see that in the word of God we we we read that in the Amplified and they they interpret it in Hebrew the meaning of without a vision the people perish I left my little Amplified Bible back there on the desk but it it says uh without a Redemptive Revelation the people perish amen so we must understand Redemption amen cuz we are in Redemption amen praise the Lord aren't you glad and redeem it means to buy back oh praise the Living God so so Christ Jesus God through his Mercy knew that the law required a Kinsman amen so with that God there was a lamb we know slain before the foundation of the world to redeem us back to buy us back so here God first amen had the vision amen when he was Elohim before he was even God he was Elohim self-existent always was so in his mind he had a vision he had a Redemptive plan he had a Redemptive Vision amen and in Christ The Mystery of God revealed we know as the prophet taught us God wanted to reveal himself in Christ he wanted to get the prence out of our life and restored the kingdom to his rightly position amen so the vision is on a she glad amen my I get excited so what do we see here see we know way before what the 1920s I believe when television came out that's then but God had Vision way before that amen or they call we call it hell Vision praise the Lord so what do we see as as we look into the word of God even uh there in the book of Isaiah and Isaiah 6 he saw a vision he saw a vision of of how it was and how even he described said how even the seams one of the seams took a live coold and touched his tongue and he said Wars me a man undone a man with unclean lips the vision had an effect on isah oh and when you see this Vision it has an effect on you hey man was oh bless his wonderful name so what do we see we see that uh that even habca habaka said and that word vision and habaka it means the same thing in um uh Proverbs 29 habaka said in habaka 2 and one I will stand upon my watch and I will watch what he's saying to me and he said write the vision make it plain upon tables that he may run that RI it for the vision is yet for an appointed time but at the end it shall speak though it t wait for it it will surely come it would not ter so even habca and if you notice from habca 2 Paul got the revelation of that in Hebrews 10 uh verses 37-39 and Paul called now habac called division it but Paul came and called that Vision Christ amen so the vision is Christ amen Hallelujah and Christ is the anointed word amen Christ is the very Heart Of God oh so it's God's desire oh I'm I'm glad to be a part of his his vision his eternal thoughts amen you know God have eternal thoughts and he have created thoughts Elohim so I'm glad to be a part of his eternal thoughts you were chosen in him before the foundation of the world so when you see the vision you must run that word run it means to make haste don't it It Don't Come Easy you don't come half stepping it means to make haste it's a matter of life and death once you see the vision and back then they had to write it on tables of stone they had to write it uh large and clear on tables of stone that when people walked by they saw it clear it was no in other words you didn't had to figure it out it was so plain and and now he's showing us plainly division amen remember the Lord Jesus said many things I could tell you not can bear them now but the time come in that day now the prophet interpreted that he said that day is this day I will show you plainly of the father I will show you show you plainly of the word of God so the word of God is being made plain amen right division make it plain upon tables and now he's writing that Vision plain Upon Our Hearts amen not with ink but by the blood by the spirit of Christ oh he's making it he's writing that Vision in our hearts it's read in our hearts we are reading the pists known and read of our men and what it it's the word quicken in our hearts aren't you glad the letter kth but the spirit giveth life you know some people criticize me cuz I love the spirit I love the spirit quicking word amen amen the is the blood of Christ by the spirit praise the Lord I I don't you know he call us to be on fire brother brandham said never let this revival Fire Die there's somebody that's going to stay on fire for God Amen praise the Living God you must be the Revival I tell people don't look for the Revival I'm the Revival ammen the Bri Revival is on now don't wait on the squeeze the squeeze is already on anyway it's gradually happening it could take a year it could take five years it could take 20 years but the squeeze is on and it gradually tightens down amen praise the Living God I want to tell you the squeeze is on you see what's happening out there amen Kenneth Copeland Roman Catholic Church all those things the the four blood moons all those things we're not setting the date it could be 20 years from now but one thing we know the squeeze is on now another thing we know that BR reviv is on now remember invisible Union yes sir the move is on now for the BR amen back then when this five planets lined up it was the bride in her emphasis St but now stage of maturity that's where we're at praise the Living God so the vision is being made plain amen we have to move at the vision we can't sit still it's time to be desperate or perish cuz there's coming forth something with the Lord and if we don't be desperate it'll pass through us it's a matter of life and death the token must be applied you know we preach back home a little message call it's house cleaning time I told him I said that's what I need to tell you this morning from the holy ghost that there's house cleaning time everything got to be clear you you can't have any alts in your heart if you have any alts against your parents against the preach against anyone your boss man whoever you got to get it right you got to forget all those things you have to you can't even enter into this if you can't get those things right because forgiveness is the foundation of Faith amen faith is based on forgiveness so it have to be a Clear Channel if if it's not clear you can't even hear from God it'll pass right through you so it's important that we lay the foundation amen it got to be laid right you know I believe the whole word of God is deep from from Genesis to Revelation from Calvary to now it's all deep because the foundation must be deep Jesus say he that digs the foundation in Luke 6 he must dig deep first amen so praise the Living God and the spirit of God searches the Deep things of God bless this wonderful name praise the Lord so what do we see we who were he out HED out just like Israel we were hewed out by a prophet a Vindicated Prophet regardless what anybody else say I thank God for Elijah amen I thank God for Malachi 4 He Man it came to turn our hearts back to the origin of Faith aren't you glad amen you know I was in a Baptist Church didn't know what a prophet was didn't know who Elijah was but they taught us as as young people read MTH Mark Luke and John so here in Matthew I was it stayed in my mind Matthew 17: 10 and 11 here I'm in a Baptist Church looking for Elijah yeah looking for Elijah to come didn't know who it was going to be but one of the brothers had witnessed to me hold up a church a book he said you remember the Bible said Elijah should come F first come and restore all things I said yes he said this is him that all it took because that what I was looking for amen I didn't know who would be amen Mary knew in her heart when she read Isaiah 7:14 when she read that something came over her she kept wondering and she puted it in her heart amen but one day click amen that's what made the difference and she said be it unto me according to Thy word aren't you glad see that's the secret as the word was in Mary so shall it be in you aren't you glad and when the Holy Ghost Quicken that word it gives you you a Clear Vision of what it's all about so I thank God for this Redemptive Revelation amen the gospel didn't come in word only but in power Amen in demonstration and the prophet wanted to say not just demonstration he said but the Holy Ghost In Action upon the word of God amen amen and oh God and think of that if God could have call give us anything better to defeat the than his word he would have so the word of God shall and will defeat the enemy any time any place anywhere even on his own ground ammen because Jesus Christ he conquer death H in the grave now I love the brag on the Lord Jesus Christ amen don't you he went down into hell he he I believe he's a gentleman yes sir he may have knocked on the door but he took the keys of hell and death you know the prophet said he slapped him and said give me those keys said I'm the boss amen so the devil don't even have the keys to his own house and amen he don't have the keys to his own house and you don't even have to argue with the devil you know when Satan went he went to Michael disputing the Lord's body amen CU see Michael H has a is a sign one of the works of Michael is he have authority over the resurrection power Satan didn't go to Gabriel he didn't go to Wormwood he went to Michael disputing of Moses body but Michael didn't even argue with him he just told him the Lord rebuke thee ammen so you don't have to argue with the devil Hallelujah I said you don't have to AR with the devil amen just tell the devil it's written tell the devil the Lord rebuke thee serve noce on the devil amen why we have authority amen the bride don't have to resume we have the actual Authority praise the lord we who are in Christ we have to act your Authority we don't have to beat at the air amen when the Lord Jesus was on the cross in St John 19 he verse 30 when he say it is finished it's done he spoke this day he spoke of all of it when he say it is finished you know in Hebrew that word it is finished that phrase it is called the Victor's cry oh she glad Hallelujah the Victor's cry why because the Victor Cried Out amen praise the Living God see the devil is a liar Satan is defeated the devil never going to shake your hand and tell you good game a good fight he's a s loser he walk away sad because he's a soul loser amen but praise God I'm glad to be on the wiow side amen I'm glad I took side with Jesus Christ is by his grace cuz he chose me amen so we're on the winner side we in The Winner Circle AR you glad amen praise the Living God amen I don't know if I'm going to get into my M praise the Lord so what do we see a prophet is a Divine interpreter of the word of God he's the mouthpiece of God he he he brings God on the scene to the people we know a priest takes the people to God but a prophet brings God to the people oh praise the Living God you know in the old test test up before the blood of Christ and even now as the prophet taught us he said now notice we know the different angels have their works the cherums of course we know Michael is Christ in Angelic Rim Revelation 10:1 Michael that's Christ when Danel prayed for 21 days Gabriel came Gabriel said I heard you when you first prayed but the this demon now and the Prince of Persia withstood me in that Dimension but Michael came and helped me out to get the Revelation to Daniel and make Daniel understand the vision but then we see that Cher uh wormwood controls the waters Gabel mainly Gabriel always to deal with Israel but Gabriel announced the first coming he will announce the second coming but what do we see but then now the cherums they guard the way of the throne but now the serams they have a different work they're burners at the altar and the seams take a sinner's prayer because a sinner is is too dirty to enter into the presence of God so that seram takes the the sinner's prayer and presents it to God but now we as Sons Daughters of God we don't need a Ser from to work for us anymore you Born Again In Christ you could talk to God yourself amen that's what the blood is done you can talk to God yourself but you must be on speaking terms you can't live any kind of life you got to be on speaking terms first with God and you can talk to him yourself that's the authority amen and the prophet taught us he's a he asked the question who have more Authority that's the Angels who are sitting in the presence of God or a sinner a son and daughter of God saved by grace he said Son and Daughter of God saved by grace have more Authority than the angels of God who are in the presence of God we have more Authority am but what did he say he said but they afraid to use it you see oh we must recognize who we are amen it's truth you know and we know the highest order is God revealing his word through a prophet Amos 3 and 7 Malachi 45 and 6 Revelation 10: 7 but we see Israel Israel had Grace first even in Egypt Grace came to him but Israel as the prophet taught us the greatest mistake Israel ever made Israel chose law of Grace they wanted to put their own self some work in it amen but they had nothing to do with it that's right cuz God had already promised amen he' already promised Abraham that your seed shall sojourn in a land a Strange Land for 400 years and afterward I will deliver them he' already gave the promise to Abraham say Abraham if you count the Dust encounter the Stars so should I see you oh God you're stars of God you know you know I could have been a basketball star I had it all the way could have made Plenty Money playing basketball but I'm glad to be a star of God aren't you glad hey man you got movie stars you have Hollywood stars you have football Stars basketball Bas all those stars but you're the greatest star because you're stars of God Amen I'm so glad where was thou when I laid the foundation but we can say I was there I was with him I was in his thoughts I was a part of God am and the greatest thing I cannot be lost no more than God himself could be lost because I know who I am amen you got to see who you are the one little boy remember the story the one little boy walked up the step when he walked up Faith virtue knowledge Tempest pris God really kindness he seen himself in the mirror amen but the other little boy was psyching himself out trying to anyway he was afraid he was walking through the graveyard he was among the dead walking through the graveyard he was trying to pych himself out that he was not afraid but he was afraid and God come to take away our fear Hallelujah to show us who we really are amen Heen that we could that as our brother quoted this morning one could put a th a flight two could put 10,000 oh look how many in here we could put many Devils on the r right now don't you know the devil is afraid of you remember the sto Prophet told the story about the the devil that was booing to this guy this brother he the more he booed he got smaller the more the devil boo him he got smaller but then later he decided to boo back amen so when he boo back he got bigger the devil got smaller he booed the devil got smaller yeah he realized something and then as the prophet went on to say he said the devil is afraid of that blood and that word keep in mind the devil is afraid of that blood and that word he he's afraid of it so Satan is more afraid of you than you think he is all these things though a thousand may fall at your side in 10,000 at your right hand none of those things will come near you because you're protected by the blood the blood you know is our protection amen amen I'm glad for the blood oh there's power in the blood and the blood never loses it power it puts every demon on the run it conquers every sickness amen amen it because all sin praise the Living God nobody can curse you because you're in the blood some preacher in time past may have called you serpent seed May told you you've never amount to anything may call you a Judas but you can rise above all of that you don't have to receive those negative thoughts praise the Living God you can cast them all down and recognize Who You Are praise the Living God bless his wonderful name we see that even uh we see that the power of the blood is is so great even in the natural even when you eat food the food is is transformed into blood you are what you eat that's why it's Propet you have a right eating habit I'm not here to teach Health but you know Health to me mean more than all the money in the world good health cuz you can have all the riches in the world and bad Health don't profit I rather have good health than all the money in the world praise the Living God but here a few years ago several years ago we took a little course in uh Medica University and one one thing stood out to me we had to be certified to remove as baset from from so here this professor was teaching he showed us [Music] Al that was a a disease lung as basis and it's worse when a person have as basis and smoke cigarettes it's devil worst but but anyway he said what happens he showed it on a microscope and he said now these white blood cells when when when any foreign object comes in the body those white blood cells they are at tension they're watching and when a foreign object comes to the body those white blood cells Rush that foreign object to protect the rest of the body so it would not spread so it builds a wall around that affected area and then but what happens is when the foreign object comes they're like soldiers but they the form changes of those the white blood cells form changes to swords shape of swords and go after that object I said man how Mighty God is amen man and you know the prophet told us brother Bram he said now notice he said those white blood cells are God's Army he said when you see the white PFF it represents many of those white blood cells has given their life for the body to save the body amen Christ gave his life to save the body he sent the sword of the word for protection of glad amen you see how powerful God is my he's so powerful and they said the while the white blood cells are going to fight that area then the red blood cells are sending messages to the brain produce more white blood cells hallelujah hallelujah oh god there are more with us than with them hallelujah we're Victorious amen we cannot be defeated we've got the power in the name of the Lord amen hey we can boast in the Lord amen we're not boasting in ourselves we're boasting in the Lord It's he that doeth the work Jesus said not I that doth the work the flesh has nothing to do with it but my father that dwelleth in me he doeth the work amen it's not by might nor by power but by my spirit said the Lord he is doing the work we just have to realize it's him doing the work we just have to year to him hallelujah praise the Living God you know the prophet said I'm afraid we're getting too me too many to church and not to Christ This is not enough if you're a church member something is wrong amen I'm not a church member now I'm a member of the body of Christ but I'm not a church member not a church members didn't made it if you go back in the numbers the church members didn't make it in the promised land amen the church members heard the shout yes sir the church members is called out assembly yes the church they were called out but remember we know Redemption comes in two parts yes sir out of and into amen that's right that's right he said we're getting them to church and not to Christ amen we're getting them to the prophet but not to Christ now I believe Malachi 4 I know the word is right sir but we've given them to a prophet and not the Christ it's the truth now amen but John now John had the spirit of Elijah and John said Behold the Lamb of God now the Lamb of God today Hallelujah is the word the revered word we're not feasting on the words of a man but we're feasted on the bleeding body word of the son of man Jesus Christ Christ amen so John being a prophet a true Prophet a scripture Prophet pointed the people to Christ the anointed word and the prophet taught us he said the Messiah is the word of God in full amen amen so the Messiah is on us now amen amen praise the Living God that's why the seals had to be open not just six Seals All Seven Seals had to be open amen amen because the seven seal is the coming of the Lord amen we in this dispensation here the coming of the Lord in this it was the coming of the Lord in Genesis right with Adam and Eve in Genesis 18 it was a coming to Abraham and Sarah in Exodus 3 there there was a coming I've heard their cries I've seen their Affliction and I am come down to deliver them so there was a coming of the Lord amen but now in this end time course it was a coming 2,000 years ago amen but now there's a coming and this coming is a three-fold coming amen first Thessalonians 4 shout the Lord himself so descend from heaven with a shout what's a shout in the prophet is it it's a message to what to gather the bride so the Lord himself shall come with a shout now we're not we know the litc coming is different I believe in the litc coming I believe in those bloody hands and those nail scar side I believe in it we'll see that throughout eternity yes sir but the voice the voice of our Angel is Christ in you the hope of glory and then the trump it calls us to the feast in the sky now we're not going to the to the to the marriage right we're going to the supper amen that's why the prophet spoke the invisible Union of the r of Christ showing that there must be an invisible union now Christ in you that's the invisible Union which takes you to the marriage supper and who all going have that Christ in them they will be the son you know you know there's you know one's called the lamb supper that we're going to but then those that are left behind will not rejoicing in us but those that are left behind will be the supper which is called God's supper so it's two different suppers so if we eat the book it shows that we're going to that wedding supper the supper of the Lamb I'm looking forward to that that's my vision you know some people are throwing canned goods under the house waiting on the Great Tribulation that's where their faith is that's not wrapped in faith I believe amen if I need something he's going to anoint me to speak it that's wrapped in faith cuz God going to allow the third po manifestation in your life my now I'm getting this afternoon message I had it this afternoon message but God knows all things we love the Lord so what God is doing he's calling just like God called a nation out of a Nation you know people say what they want to say this message is real and my heart is in it and whether many falling here and there and departing from the faith and falling away that's Bible that's it's written that it will happen we search our hearts examine ourself make sure you know where you stand look to Christ the anointed word it's very it's very important you know a heart go out for those Lord have mercy but while while there's still time we got to examine ourself Prophet said he said you need a shaking now he said I need a shaken down he said together we'll make it by the grace of God Amen so we're looking at his grace oh God it's a serious hour it's a serious hour so the churches to call out assembly the church heard to shout but we must be baptized by the spirit amen by one Spirit we're all baptized in that body members in particular of the body of Christ that's where we must have the token that's why the prophet said the highlight of my entire Ministry should have follow those S he said that's the highlight of his entire Ministry is that token that's something that's that's the essence right there that's the he's saying that's the essence of why why I came it's for you to receive the token M wow when I see the blood I pass over you the death angel and he said the last plag to hit the church is spiritual death you know I I'd ask the church and I've asked a few other churches honestly I asked them a question if there was a scale from 1 to 10 for you to determine one one is near zero which is freezing cold and 10 means on fire for God whichever is harder white heart or red white heart is harder than red heart and you you on a scale you you don't have to say it but you as an individual where will you place yourself on that scale now if you say five then I'm going tell you that's lukewarm it and God is through you out of his mouth you see are you a 10 plus where you on the scale or you are one see where's your life where's your heart where's your Zeal where is it are you still on fire when you first come in but because of Trials because of tests because of baners you allow the devil to fame you and cool you off but where are you at see we must be on fire for God Amen we should we should blow up the scale amen hallelujah amen amen I'm glad to be on fire for God we got to be on fire for God you know one thing about being on fire for God the devil is afraid of fire amen I said the devil is afraid of fire Hallelujah you know why he's afraid of fire because it reminds him of his [Music] future Hallelujah he know in Revelation 20 and 10 he that's why he believes and trembles he's afraid he's afraid so it reminds him too much say I'm going safe around that brother say he's on fire I'm going safe around that brother he's on fire see why it reminds him of his his future so if the devil ever try to remind you of your past you just remind him his future and he'll leave you alone a while amen if not that tell him he not going back far enough before the foundation of the world h Hallelujah I was in his mind praise the lord we rejoicing don't you love the Lord amen bless his wonderful name see John recognized who he was he recognized and that's why the prophet he not only say if the bride recognized who she is the rapture will go but he said if the bride recognize who she is she will be an invincible Army uncapable of being defeated amen we're victorious in Christ amen and that's what the devil can't stand he hates that all hell is against that Revelation Christ in you the hope of glory all hell is against it when you catch that personal revelation of who you are and who Christ is Christ is the anointed word I'm so glad we can Rejoice Even in our trials we can rejoice and I love it like one brother say say it one thing about these trials and tests is this I'm going to say it like this it's an open book test I see glad amen bless this wonderful name so the last play to hit the Church of spiritual death many are dying many are 100 below zero you cannot let Revival FES die Revival what it does a Revival it stirs up the lake it washes all the trash out aren't you glad the Revival wash all the thresh out out our lives amen it cleans us up praise the Lord it look like it's had more water but now it's washing all the trash out I'm so glad him Revival one of the men of God in the days of old described the the Revival as an interruption from Heaven oh praise the Living God hallelujah I'm glad he interrupted me I was on my way to hell I was very religious I was very religious but I was on my way to hell but there there came an interruption from Heaven that came in the eagle stream heyen I heard from my theophany aren't you glad I heard from my word body praise the Living God and I left the dead thing oh praise the Living God Amen bless his wonderful name one remember the policeman they said could you tell us where where's the wax Revival he said you standing in the middle of it it's in me hallelujah amen we heard a zuu Street Revival but what about the brother Revival you should tell them I am the BR Revival why don't you greet your neighbor you got to really mean it now but why don't you greet your neighbor and tell them I am the brid's Revival amen that's how it should be we are the bronze Revival I'm not looking for the bronze Revival amen I said I'm not looking for the broze Revival the brze Revival is on now amen praise the Living God God Amen bless his wonderful name that's why the prophet cried out didn't recognize in your day in his message he said created me a Revival oh God make me to hunger to thirst to be do be more willing to do your will more humbler more consecrated servant he said that's what we need our prayer let he said let me be the Revival Revival in me the Revival in you see that's how it should be amen bless his wonderful name it's stimulation from the revelation of the word and I'm influenced by the star you know I I said now the prophet spoke influence so many times I want to I want to see what more what what it say and I never really looked up that word so in a a Webster it's called a Webster collegate dictionary encyclopedia anyway I looked up in there that word influence it stood out to me and I had to keep reading it I said my I can't believe this but that word influence there is defined as fluids released from the heavens from the Galaxy fluids released from the Galaxy to come upon humans to cause the different actions in their life I said M I said that that word is something and then I thought about we had a seven star that came and influen US aren't you GL in the spirit oh aren't you glad amen but you know we don't stay at the seventh star you know that because remember in the Holy place it was Seven Stars there were seven candlesticks but now in the most holy place is that day star Christ is called the day star he's called the pillar of fire so every age had a star influencing them spiritually speaking but it only came to that we may thought because the Bible said now that we have a sure word of Prophecy the day has gone and the day star has has risen in our hearts now now we learn in science or that the day star is called the sun actually but you know the prophet a message it is the rising of the sun see the prophet had his ministry was in stages said at evening time he came out at evening time they shall be light but and then later he began to preach at the Midnight Hour but then at the end of his ministry he preached on the rising of the Sun so it so his ministry changed from the eite message to the rising of the sun amen amen yeah the same word the same same word but it was stages from from evening time to midnight to rising of the Sun so by the time in 65 what is it it is the rising of the sun 64 what was it good morning arise shine Shalom to who the bride amen oh bless this wonderful name cuz now the Evening Sun cannot ripen the sea right so the ministry had to change so the Sun could rise to ripen the seed in our hearts by the Holy Ghost amen bless this wonderful name so I'm glad for almighty God oh bless his wonderful name it's the quickening power to the Sea it's the Dynamics in the mechanics Dynamics alone alone will not work it must be the Holy Ghost upon the word Jesus said the words that I speak unto you they are spirit and they are life you know I want to take out my my my phone so I can see the time they got my jacket that's why I brought my phone because I I noticed yesterday it wasn't a clock so I brought my phone and put it on silence so I can keep up with the time youall got me now I'm not Al I'm not Al you all have such a that's wonderful see sometime you think you have to go over seas for a pool we appreciate the pool honestly I don't say that for flatter it's the truth it's wonderful wonder that that means more as as Proverbs 17 says it's better a dve morer than a house full of strife in other words a little people than a a crowd strife and eny so thank God for your spirits it's a fire I've GR in churches where it's hundreds and 100 so quiet where Jesus is hallelujah amen amen now some worship God inside if they want to that's fine yeah now we know there was a time when the prophet had there when it was time for deserting now the sister coming out Hallelujah you know she missed her heill another one came up bubbly buba dancing he said that was the time but the one came up rly she re he but now when the word is coming forth that's difference there's a Hallelujah there's a glory amen when the seals were open amen the Hallelujah went up the glories went up JN to they hurt me heaven they hurt me in Earth they hurt me in other dimension amen worth is the Lamb to receive power and glory and wisdom amen because John recognized the lamb amen and only the lamb is worthy Michael couldn't even open his ears only the lamb the lamb tore off the seals I see the lamb took the book and tore off the seals and the lamb s it down to Revelation 10:7 amen Revelation 10:1 Michael is Christ came down in that form but the lamb is on the throne making intercessions for you and I so we have to watch the manifestation and the changes of his name because the word interpreted is the manifestation of the name of God am when he went to Abraham in Genesis 17 he went to him as aedi the strength Giver cuz he told him to be perfect and Jesus told us to be perfect so El sh eyes on the scene to make us perfect aren't you glad to bring us to maturity he went to Moses he said by my name Jehovah was I not made known to Abraham because why now he come to redeem amen oh praise the living god Jehovah JRA Jehovah Shalom Jehovah Ro Jehovah RI amen praise the Lord Jehovah s Jehovah Shalom Jehovah n Jehovah sh why he changes names to show the different manifestations of his word oh I'm so glad and I love the greatest name that's above every name they recognize that name in heaven they recognize that name in Earth they recognize that name under the Earth that name Jesus amen and there still power in that name demons Still Tremble at that name Deliverance comes at that name hey man there's still power in that name that's right the devil's afraid of that name when the demons come after you you use that name and you plead the blood and you watch those demons leave they must leave they must OB that name amen praise the Living God and the thing about it you a m Jesus Christ I said you are M Jesus Christ your name is on the checkbook I said your name is on the checkbook it's not Jesus and his wife is Jesus or amen you know [Music] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah you know at the bank when his when his the husband and both name and both have to but it's all Hallelujah your name is just as good on the checkbook so write the check whatever you need write the check the bank of Heaven is responsible and the dead is paid on Calvary so write the chat you know the prophets is two kind of people some that he one have faith write the check and no money in the bank the other one have money in the bank and don't have the faith to write it he said but if you ever get the two together Hallelujah I believe it's together right the check Hallelujah there's is anything too hard for the Lord heaven will not go bankrupt so write the check what are you waiting on ask God for big things I'm going tell you I don't go and ask God I just want a little no I'm telling you I ask God for big things amen spiritually physically materially naturally everywh and good health I ask them for all things because the Bible tells us with God there's nothing impossible so how are we going to exhaust him how why would we limit God no I don't ask him for little things I I'm telling you I ask God for big things Hallelujah you got to ask him for big things now in the flesh I may go and see see all this wonderful food and load up my plate and can't eat it all that's that's long out but you can't be long outed with God I'm telling you you cannot be long eyed with God praise the Lord in the flesh you can be long ey but it's good to be greedy spiritually Hallelujah H one day I was at the buffet the food was so good I told my wife I said boy I ought to pray that that I be Anointed with the spirit of a hog so I can so I can eat up off the food but I didn't pray that far praise the Lord but with God we can never ask him too much you know those even Gideon he asked the Lord something that you know you know as we study the scriptures I know you do they ask God for big things and he did amen God is real and he want to show himself more and more real to us I want to I want to read read something um so much I know I won't be able to read all of these but see we're not we're not dumb driven cattle have to be begged and persuaded uh why don't the pastor after why don't you come to church and Pat you up we don't need that we need we don't need the patting up now it's time to throw away the pacify it's time to throw away the diaper can you imagine a a 15y old boy walking around with the bottle can you imagine that no it's time for us to grow up it's later than we think misery love company and long as the devil would try to hold you in those room oh so and so did that but that was 10 years ago you you have the same story have you forgiven the brother for doing that to you have you forgiven the sister and they are living that all those years and bringing everybody they came with it and you know it's terrible when are you going to let it go and move on some someone done lied on you and you living way back there and you bound many are bound right in their mind in bondage because of what somebody said about them or said to them you I preached the same way back home it's the truth cuz people are bound like that and they they they have been wounded no doubt you give time for the wounds to heal but 10 years and 15 and 20 years no no something else wrong you want pity now you understand you know I had someone to tell me the Lord was doing different works and one guy come to me and said Brother David he said don't pray for me he said I'm on disability I'm receiving a disability check and if you pray for me I know that I'll be healed it'll cut my check off but see God could have given a better job you remember the one that was begging arms Peter and John said look on us s go Have I None but I give thee in the name of Jesus Christ rise up and Mar amen he went forth probably made more money with the job than he was on disability we don't want things handed on the silver stoon we won't appreciate it as much notice all right but all this Mysteries revealed only as he promised to his Bri prom what mystery Christ The Mystery of God reveal amen hell is against this truth of revelation of this mystery see hell is against it but the bride is standing on it amen that's her stand why do you hunger Hallelujah why do you thirst is the father trying to reveal this hidden secret to you you see why there's a hunger and thirst it's the father trying to reveal this hidden secret to you but you let so many things get get it out of you you let your job you let your wife you let your husband you you let your children you let the cares of the world you let some Pastor or some preacher you let somebody else get that out of you but when you know that way down in your heart you're thirsting and hungry it's gone trying to reveal it to you see the Revelation the last day is here do you see so that's why you hunger and you thirst because it's God trying to reveal and see God said I call you no Jesus said I call you no more servants because a servant knowth not what his Lord doth but I call you friends and a friend don't weigh thoughts true friends is both ways you don't weigh thoughts around one another you know have to say I wonder she I read a quote or she I call the prophet name I'm just saying but God the Bible say Abraham was called the friend of God why God say shall I from Abraham what I'm about to do so he reveal himself and his secrets to his friends so we are his friends he's not AF afraid to call his brother that's when God is dealing with you before anything can happen out here to make you be a Christian something has to happen in the heart to turn you to Christianity that's right it's election God does that that's how he so it's a blessing that we thirst and hunger after righteousness praise the Lord praise the Lord I'm I'm about to close is out but uh what do we see the Revival is the moving of the spirit it what it does it brings souls to Christ it brings us back to a spiritual condition one of the meanings of Revival it means to bring back to conscience you know the prophet said it like this he said we don't remember he said our minds were were black La it but God come in this end time to us to take away the spiritual Amnesia aren't you glad because people get spiritual Amnesia through through Battles Through Wars harm between two opinions tra but then you have to take a for meor places that's why the Lord on the road to em May you had to take them back to the places and then their eyes will open then they recognize so anytime the enemy try to get you into AIA State that's the best way amen right even if you have to as the psalmist said in Psalm 77 even if you have to call back a song of remembers the devil show bring you those songs when you in the world those who in the world he'll take you way back and and and sing that song to you and he could sing he'll sing it right in your ear and try to take it how much more a song that brought you if you don't have nothing else to tell tell how you was lit amen you know I remember when we come in singing a song I'm so glad that the Lord brought me out and how did you feel when you come come out to witness I'm running for my life and then you have to ask the question like Paul said you run well but now what has hindered you you know thank God he sent a prophet thank God for this message hold on on fire for this message and you see them today they they don't want anything to do with this message it's sad what about the songs you s Hallelujah I'm glad he brought me out we still glad he brought us out cuz we still here we hadn't found anything better amen because because it's the stimulation from the revelation of the word of God amen hallelujah oh bless his wonderful name I love this wine this the best wine amen when I was in the world we we played a lot of basketball and one of the one of the guys he and I we didn't like to drink we didn't like marijuana none of that stuff we rode with the guys who did so they would pass the B around and we we turn it up quick and pass it it would pass the marij one around honestly we would take it I was say pass it make it look like with the crowd we go to nightclubs I order seven of on ice now I was no angel but I would order I would sneak to the bar in order to set them up on ice because I couldn't stand this stuff and besides that my father was an alcoholic he passed away 2008 the alcohol destroyed his heart ate up his heart but I was able to win him to the Lord before that and uh but I saw alcoholism gr up in my home it destroyed my home my family with my father I always loved him never disrespected he brought violence all and so anyway I didn't want anything to do with I I see right first hand and um so and he drunk enough for both of us anyway so I didn't I I wanted nothing to do with it but but yet I was right there with the guys and one thing I didn't like when they said let's get some Thunderbird wine oh boy CU I got sick I would get sick when I cried and you know and I realized I said if something caused me to not even remember how I got home something was wrong when I come home I leave with hundreds of dollars and when I come home had no money I was the type that bought all the beverages for the guys I may have one cup in my hand the whole night where they drinking up everything but but yet it took a toll on but then when I start drinking wi amen I'm not glorifying the devil this the wine I should have been drinking all along amen amen and this wine you have no hangovers amen you don't have to wake up the next morning with a headache and and mix up a egg a raw praise the Lord I'm I'm just happy yall bear with me my father I'm so thankful this the best thing that ever happened to me is coming to Christ because I you know it's no it's no is no uh nothing in my own self you look out there and you say I could have been I don't never look down on anyone I don't think I'm better than anyone else we had a sng in the olden days don't look down on a man unless you're picking him up I believe that because it's the grace of God even Paul warned us he said we as Gentiles we were we were a wild Olive PRI he said we were grafted in so we can't rejoice and look down and boast in ourself because he said remember remember we came from there wild Oliver we didn't even seek after God as the as Hosea said I was found in them that sought me not a people that didn't even seek after me they shall be called the Sons and Daughters of God that's the grace of God he said remember Israel was blinded in part why for you and I Joseph said you know have to we it happened deserve life I'm glad Elijah thought he was the only one left no Elijah I have a Remnant I have 7,000 heyen oh and not only Israel but we that's why when the seal when the fourth seal we under the fourth seal so when the fourth seal was open amen I have some the prophet said you went beyond the curtain he said there were Millions that's few out of six point something billion right Millions is true but he said I see I see you over there praise the Lord I seen you over there I was one of them that said we arrested on Us heyen Praise the Lord he said this message for my congregation only now his congregation is all those that follow this message so we're serving a living Christ we have the devil's answer now we're not just saying that we're not just beating at the air we have the devil's answer he said well what's his question he's saying where's Christ you can tell a devil Christ is in me amen praise the Living God Amen it's time we we've taken too much off of Satan we have authority and power we can serve notice on the enemy amen it's the truth so influence or fluids released from the Stars it says fluids released from the stars that come upon humans to cause different actions in their life even in the moon when there's a full moon they say more crime is done doing a full moon a full moon you know these these things how there's no coincidence the Bible said when he created the uh when the Lord created the the son he created for in the moon and the stars it was for signs and for seasons and for days and for for years and for months so these things and and here he say he tell Psalm 147 say he tell us the number of the Stars he calleth them by where were you and the sons of God shouted together the sons of God shout uh shouted for Jo amen Satan wanted to wanted to wor be worshiped and be above the St God of God Jesus in MA numbers 24:17 even balam prophesied of a true Prophecy of the Lord Jesus the star shall rise out of Jacob he's the chief star amen he's the day star he's the chief star what happened when the Lord Jesus was born what happened three stars lined up to represent him why God declares himself in the heavens on Earth what happened 1963 cloud of so he declar himself in the heavens and it has an influence it has a major effect on the earth and upon his people put that those stars of the Moon the changes of the moon what happened representative the ages so God is real God is real so here in closing we see that redemption in two parts out of the law Us in ja the law told us we were in see the law told us that we were wrong but Grace said I was wrong Grace come to call us to repentance to say I was wrong and Grace say I forgive you amen I'm glad for Grace I'm glad glad for Grace we have a message of Grace that say I forgive you that say that you The sinless Virtuous wife of the Son of God to say you mis's Grace you mis Jesus Christ to say you're free Amen to give you Jubilee cuz where the spirit of the Lord is there's liberty so we have a message of Grace amen amen Grace has come to us I'm so glad you know I say a lot of times you hear uh youth meetings and you hear the young people just being hammered you're this you're that you're that telling them all their own but they already know that but Grace comeing tell you how to get out of it see not just tell you you're in it they know they in it but we must tell them how to get out of it they said what must we do to be saved and Peter told them what they must do to be sa saved he didn't tell them what they need to stop doing to be saved he told them what they need to do to be saved when you tell them what they need to do to be saved then they'll stop doing what they doing not to be saved you understand when the Lord Jesus came in Jerusalem many of them asked who is this they should have been saying here he is amen so when you see the vision you'll say here he is is Christ the anointed one it's all that the prophet spoke of is happening it's right Among Us so here it is here's the vision and the vision is made plain amen so we must walk in the vision and just like their Vision the vision had an effect on Isaiah the vision had an effect on Daniel this Vision has an effect on us so we must make haste and make our call in election sure because without a Vision the people perish so I thank God for the vision aren't you glad for the vision I'm glad for this Vision bless is one of Fame there's a deep call to the Deep I'm glad that by his grace he calls me to respond it's only by his grace only by Grace we can enter and by the blood of Jesus Christ we can enter Because the enemy once you're washed in the blood and once you're sealed in Satan is sealed out amen so we appreciate God's Amazing Grace for opening our eyes he said blessed are your eyes for you see and your ears for you hear for even many prophets sought diligently concerning the grace of God and even Angel's desire to look upon the things that we see God chose us for this last age because this is the greatest age for the people of God the prophet said no other age he wanted to be in but this age if God would have showed him all down through time he said he would have chose this age still because this is the greatest age God chose the you to be in this greatest age so you are very special it's the grace of God let us pray our heavenly father we love you we praise you Lord the enemy is only a bluff we see already he he rode with a a bow without an arrow Lord God without you we're no match with him but with you we're more than a match so Lord we must be fortified and stay fortified behind the word of God Lord bless every heart here Lord continue to bless the pastor and his wife and family Lord we can say like Moses said we're not leaving a hoof behind Hallelujah all that the father has given shall come hallelujah oh God because we've applied the token and the blood cannot lose its power hallelujah oh God we look to you right now oh God God thank you for all things thank you thank you for your spirit thank you for each and everyone Lord we appreciate you in all things in the precious lovely name of Jesus Christ we pray and we love you and we thank you father in Jesus name amen if anyone desire prayer you can come do God
