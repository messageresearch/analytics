blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men but the blasphemy blasphemy against the holy ghost shall not be forgiven unto men and whosoever speaketh the word against the son of man it shall be forgiven him but whosoever speaketh against the holy ghost it shall not be forgiven him neither in this world neither in the world to come contrary either make the tree good and his fruit good or else make the tree corrupt and his fruit corrupt for the tree is known by his fruits oh generation of vipers how can you being evil speak good things for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh a good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringing forth evil things but i say unto you that every idle word that men shall speak they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment can we say amen to that man for the words for excuse before by thy words thou shalt be justified and by thy words thou shalt be condemned amen
