[0:47] [Music]
[0:52] trust the lord it's been good to
[0:53] everybody in my absence
[0:56] amen amen the more
[1:00] that i surrender
[1:04] the lighter my lord
[1:09] the more
[1:12] [Music]
[1:20] the more that i will humble myself the
[1:25] more
[1:26] you lift me up and
[1:29] every day i live
[1:32] lord i love you
[1:41] [Music]
[1:58] the more that i could humble myself
[2:14] [Music]
[2:34] the more

[2:49] once again once again
[3:10] the more that i can
[3:19] [Music]
[3:31] no
[3:37] [Music]
[3:55] hallelujah
[3:58] amen
[4:00] yes it gets easier as we surrender to
[4:05] god
[4:07] as we stand right into the word of god
[4:12] we know we're living in the last days
[4:14] and i'm gonna keep
[4:16] saying those kind of things to always
[4:19] remind
[4:21] us not just you but me too
[4:25] of the hour that we're living in
[4:29] uh everybody claims to see it
[4:35] but there are so many who think they see
[4:40] they forget that we're in an hour that
[4:43] the lord said that you have eyes to see
[4:45] and can't see and you'll have ears to
[4:47] hear
[4:48] and you won't be able to hear
[4:52] and in all of that it is the lord's
[4:54] doing
[4:55] it's not my doing and no one else is
[4:57] doing
[4:59] how god can speak to some and then hide
[5:02] himself
[5:04] in the same sentence or statement
[5:07] but i'm so glad to be here tonight to
[5:10] see and understand the moving of god
[5:14] to know the hour that we're living in in
[5:16] the old house and see
[5:17] how serious excuse me it is
[5:21] only god can help us in this day
[5:26] we have a great adversary
[5:29] and we must not all we must never take
[5:32] him for granted
[5:33] we must always understand it was god who
[5:35] made him
[5:37] so even in his evil he's perfect evil
[5:41] don't underestimate your enemy and the
[5:44] only one who
[5:45] can defeat him is the perfect god
[5:48] so um with all that being said i
[5:51] i thank god for the opening of the word
[5:54] and all that god is doing and has done
[5:56] for us
[5:58] we had a wonderful time there in guyana
[6:02] the lord richly richly blessed words
[6:04] cannot express or explain
[6:06] we did have one soul who gave his heart
[6:09] to the lord as
[6:10] i preached he said the fire of god just
[6:13] came
[6:13] all over him from his head to the bottom
[6:16] of his feet
[6:17] i didn't have to beg he came willingly
[6:21] and was just seeing the urgency of the
[6:24] time
[6:25] and he wanted to be immediately baptized
[6:28] and we accompanied the brother to
[6:31] baptize him i thought it was only
[6:32] appropriate to let the pastor baptize
[6:34] him
[6:34] even though my desire was to baptize him
[6:37] but uh either way he's out of a sin he
[6:40] was born in
[6:41] and the young man is really fired up
[6:45] so pray for him he also won a witness to
[6:48] the place he when she came from
[6:50] which is a pentecostal church so pray
[6:52] god give him an open door
[6:55] give him strength by god's grace
[7:00] amen as we turn to
[7:03] genesis 5 22 and i want to say that trip
[7:07] was worth it if it's
[7:08] just one soul but we ministered at a
[7:12] church there
[7:13] uh in guyana um and over 5 000
[7:18] something people listened in uh people
[7:21] from canada people from
[7:23] uh trinidad and other places were all
[7:26] tuned in
[7:28] i have that recording i sent it to a few
[7:30] people if you want to listen or
[7:32] see what god was doing there you i could
[7:34] always send it to you
[7:37] genesis 5 22
[7:40] it was something that i was not
[7:41] expecting i didn't know they had
[7:44] a means of doing that so that was one of
[7:47] those sporadical things that happened
[7:49] and so by god's grace we're we're happy
[7:52] to
[7:56] know thing my son said to me he says
[8:00] daddy
[8:00] those people really love you over there
[8:03] so don't be worried about home just
[8:04] enjoy yourself
[8:07] so i i was surprised he said that but he
[8:10] did
[8:11] it was a word of encouragement
[8:14] and that that was god speaking to him
[8:17] because i was
[8:19] couldn't get my mind off of here
[8:23] genesis 5 25 what did i say
[8:27] genesis 5 24 excuse me
[8:30] and enoch walked with god and he was not
[8:35] for god took him
[8:39] one more scripture second corinthians 12
[8:42] and three
[8:43] for those of you who may see the
[8:46] condition of my eye
[8:47] i did not get punched in it or anything
[8:50] uh
[8:50] we had a doctor's appointment i just got
[8:52] an injection
[8:54] and i thought it was quite rough today
[8:58] my eye says he was rough but i thank god
[9:01] for the victory
[9:03] amen we we're fine and it's one of those
[9:06] things that i have to deal with until
[9:08] jesus completely heals me or
[9:09] give me the grace to receive that
[9:11] healing i believe that
[9:14] i'm not giving up on it and i believe
[9:16] god has heard my prayer
[9:19] yes second corinthians 12
[9:23] and 3
[9:29] let's start at the second verse i knew a
[9:32] man in christ above
[9:33] 14 years ago whether in the body i
[9:36] cannot tell
[9:37] whether out of the body i cannot tell
[9:40] god knoweth such and one caught up to
[9:43] the third heaven
[9:45] and i knew such a man whether in the
[9:47] body or out of the body
[9:49] i cannot tell god knoweth how that he
[9:52] was caught up into a paradise
[9:55] and heard unspeakable words which is not
[9:58] lawful for men to
[10:00] to utter amen and i was such
[10:04] one will i glory yet of myself i will
[10:08] not glory
[10:09] but in my infirmities let us pray father
[10:12] god we thank you for your grace
[10:14] we thank you for your mercy and your
[10:15] grace we thank you for being so good to
[10:18] us we pray that you will give us grace
[10:20] tonight oh god open up your word
[10:22] that we may hear and understand and lord
[10:25] will be careful to give you the praise
[10:26] glory and honor
[10:28] in jesus christ's name we pray amen
[10:31] we you may be seated we entitled this
[10:33] message
[10:34] uh uh dimensional strength but
[10:37] i would like to flip it around and just
[10:39] kind of call it ascension
[10:41] uh the last time i was here we talked
[10:43] about ascension that is to
[10:45] move up higher into a position into a
[10:47] place
[10:48] that god has established us we know by
[10:51] god's grace
[10:52] um as we are we're not the beings that
[10:56] god intention
[10:57] intended for us to be uh because of the
[11:00] fall and the things that
[11:01] uh uh transpired in the garden of eden
[11:05] will now
[11:06] uh bearing the uh the
[11:09] the sins of our fathers uh but by god's
[11:12] grace god is
[11:13] more than just he's more than fair
[11:16] and he's most of all merciful um
[11:21] you know god gave me a song today i
[11:22] wasn't in a place to write it down and
[11:24] so
[11:25] it left me but the thing that was so
[11:27] beautiful too
[11:28] in that song it was more less on a hymn
[11:31] style but
[11:32] it uh talked about how beautiful god is
[11:35] and
[11:35] how wonderful he is if the lord give
[11:38] gives me that song again i will write it
[11:40] down
[11:41] but nevertheless i i was thinking about
[11:43] that all day on how
[11:45] beautiful god is um
[11:48] i i can't imagine what he looks like in
[11:50] his
[11:51] natural body but uh in his spirit um
[11:56] you hear that you've heard that song his
[11:58] beauty is beyond description
[12:01] and the more i fall in love with him uh
[12:04] the more i see
[12:05] him for who he really is and the more
[12:09] i desire to be like him you know we look
[12:12] at this thing and we
[12:14] uh think about how and i mentioned this
[12:17] the last time how
[12:19] great the fall was and how um
[12:22] tremendous it was and we never think
[12:25] about it but
[12:26] it was it really was we we think about
[12:28] it was like
[12:29] it happened and god moved on but you've
[12:32] got to realize how painful this was
[12:34] god has feelings and even though he knew
[12:37] what was going to take place he could
[12:39] feel you know the the pain
[12:42] of disappointment and failure um
[12:46] we must understand by god's grace that
[12:47] god knows we're going to fail
[12:49] in our in ourselves but we know it
[12:52] affects him
[12:53] uh and and we know that through our sin
[12:55] you know he feels every blow
[12:57] um that we we give him daily we let's
[13:00] not forget
[13:01] amen that jesus christ amen is the one
[13:04] who's
[13:05] who who was crucified for us and our
[13:07] sins
[13:08] are was placed upon him and so therefore
[13:11] until it's all finished he is uh
[13:14] standing
[13:15] in the gap he's our perpetuation he's
[13:18] our mercy seat he is our
[13:20] he's our bloody lamb he's you know he's
[13:23] the god who can feel and be
[13:25] touched by our infirmities
[13:29] the thing that gets me is that we've
[13:31] spoken on this uh before
[13:33] but somewhat in a different way we've
[13:35] said how enoch walked with god and i
[13:37] love that because
[13:39] that's all god says
[13:43] and we would have never known that enoch
[13:45] built the pyramid had it not been for
[13:47] brother brandon
[13:48] and that comes by faith now we don't
[13:51] know how it all happened and how god did
[13:53] it
[13:54] but we know that enoch was responsible
[13:57] for the great pyramid it doesn't matter
[13:58] who the archaeologists
[14:00] give credit to we know the truth
[14:03] now the thing that gets me is because
[14:06] enoch typed the bride
[14:08] and that's all god said
[14:13] he never told us the story of enoch
[14:14] before
[14:16] he walked with god all we know is that
[14:19] there was a point in time
[14:21] enoch and god connected
[14:26] and that's all that's recorded enoch was
[14:29] a man like you and i
[14:30] none of his failures was ever recorded
[14:35] and the bible says it all have sinned
[14:38] and come
[14:38] short of the glory of god so we
[14:40] understand that even enoch and his own
[14:42] walking with god had failures just like
[14:44] us
[14:45] because by god's grace he is a type of
[14:47] us
[14:48] and we know by god's grace that noah is
[14:50] not
[14:52] because noah had to work for his
[14:53] salvation
[14:55] he had to build he had to help he had to
[14:57] go in there and build a knock for 120
[14:59] years
[15:00] but enoch all he did was walk
[15:03] all he did was commune with god all he
[15:05] did was connect with god
[15:06] and the bible said because he did that
[15:08] he was found not he was just he ascended
[15:12] he was translated amen and was found not
[15:17] now even in the in this great message of
[15:19] grace
[15:20] we must understand by god's grace that
[15:23] god always tests and tries us why
[15:26] because we're sons and daughters of god
[15:29] we must understand the test and the
[15:31] trials are going to come
[15:33] the bible said if god doesn't try you if
[15:36] he doesn't test you if i could say it
[15:38] like that
[15:38] then you're none of his he spanks those
[15:41] he's chasing those
[15:42] whom he loves and so we must understand
[15:45] that
[15:45] every day is not some shiny day in some
[15:48] rainbow of colors
[15:49] we have some rough times hallelujah
[15:53] amen but paul says you know he gives us
[15:55] a view of something
[15:57] and before the message came in this hour
[16:00] we didn't understand what paul was
[16:02] talking about you know
[16:03] i can remember even in the denominations
[16:05] how we uh
[16:06] tried to ration our lives and try to uh
[16:09] understand
[16:10] you know what paul was talking about
[16:12] caught up into the third heaven we
[16:13] didn't even know there were three
[16:15] i didn't even know there was a third
[16:16] heaven and we we tried to place where
[16:18] that would be
[16:20] amen and you know when you think about
[16:22] it you you i can remember i could see
[16:24] the faces right now some of the
[16:25] ministers that we
[16:26] we talked about or listened to as they
[16:28] conversed and talked
[16:30] about how you know uh this thing was
[16:33] was with paul and they thought it was so
[16:36] great
[16:36] but now if you tell them the story of
[16:38] william branham they don't want to hear
[16:39] it
[16:40] but you see if there's an alpha there
[16:42] must be an omega
[16:45] and and all paul was doing to his day
[16:48] and age
[16:48] was telling them his experience
[16:52] and in his experience he could not say i
[16:55] saw you over there
[16:58] and if he did it's not written
[17:02] but when it came to william branham in
[17:04] his because he was the omega
[17:06] the things in which paul could not utter
[17:09] the prophet of god did
[17:11] because uh paul was the first angel to
[17:14] the church
[17:16] and william branham was the seventh
[17:18] angel to the church
[17:20] and we know at the voice of the seven
[17:22] angels the mysteries of god should be
[17:24] completed
[17:26] and so we understand by god's grace that
[17:28] the mystery of god
[17:30] is so beautiful that's all i was
[17:32] thinking about
[17:34] so beautiful
[17:37] words cannot express how beautiful it is
[17:41] and and all the time we think that we're
[17:44] messing up
[17:45] we have no idea we're right in the the
[17:48] the step of the word
[17:50] because you don't you're not the one who
[17:52] orders your steps
[17:58] he orders your stamps and so paul was
[18:02] saying listen i can't tell you about my
[18:04] experience other than what i
[18:05] what it is and paul was almost like
[18:08] bashful
[18:09] if i could say it like this he was
[18:10] reserved because he said i knew a man
[18:14] using i think the third person or the
[18:16] second person he
[18:17] he used as if there was someone else
[18:19] outside of himself that told him a
[18:21] testimony but the testimony was all
[18:23] about him
[18:26] brother bradham said i was caught up
[18:29] he said i laid up on my bed and i'm
[18:31] saying these things because
[18:32] i want you to understand he said i laid
[18:34] there and all of a sudden i was
[18:36] right above just by the ceiling or
[18:39] somewhere up in there
[18:40] and i was in another dimension now i'm
[18:43] saying that for purpose
[18:48] because we we in our minds we've always
[18:51] thought heavens were
[18:52] a million miles away and all of a sudden
[18:55] the rapture is going to take us and
[18:56] we're going to
[18:58] go at the sound or the speed of the
[19:00] light to get there
[19:02] in the moment of a twinkling of an eye
[19:05] when in reality it's just a dimensional
[19:07] way
[19:09] we don't know how far away that this
[19:12] dimension
[19:13] was in the time of of paul
[19:16] because i want you to understand that
[19:18] they were dimensions
[19:20] even in the creation of god seven i
[19:23] believe it was
[19:26] and these dimensions were out of order
[19:30] that's why the bible said that the earth
[19:32] was void
[19:34] and then god spoke by his word and
[19:37] placed everything in order
[19:39] understand because of the fall it
[19:42] distorted the dimensions again
[19:45] that's why god said amen that hell was
[19:48] not made or created for the sons of god
[19:52] but because of these things amen because
[19:54] of the the fall of man everything has
[19:56] been out of order and remember brother
[19:58] brethren said that even hell and earth
[20:00] is blending
[20:03] into each other now i want to tell you
[20:06] this and maybe you're not aware
[20:08] but there is another blending but it's
[20:11] heaven and earth
[20:13] amen and that's what god was showing
[20:18] by way of paul and by way of william
[20:21] branham
[20:21] that something is moving and it's moving
[20:25] into a way a place
[20:27] that one day it's just going to take
[20:29] another step
[20:31] we sing it my theophany is always
[20:34] calling me yeah
[20:35] because one of these old days we'll take
[20:37] another step
[20:38] now understand i'm going scripture
[20:41] because enoch
[20:42] walked with god step by step
[20:45] by step by step and that step took him
[20:48] to a place
[20:51] that he was found not he didn't go by
[20:54] chariot he didn't go by whirlwind
[20:59] he went by a step
[21:02] so you and i must understand how
[21:04] important it is for us to walk with god
[21:08] says of god i'm trying to tell you
[21:10] whatever it is that's
[21:12] blocking your walk with god you've got
[21:14] to get rid of it
[21:17] this is a dimensional thing this is a
[21:20] thing that
[21:20] that god will allow us to happen to
[21:23] happen you don't believe it is so
[21:25] because remember amen this thing after
[21:28] let's just jump a little bit
[21:29] because when jesus was raised from the
[21:31] dead
[21:33] first of all marry them saul wanted to
[21:35] touch him he couldn't he says i must
[21:36] have sinned
[21:37] to my father right he went there he
[21:39] placed the blood on the on
[21:41] on the mercy seat he came back down mary
[21:44] and all of them touched him
[21:46] in that glorified body jesus
[21:50] walked through the door he didn't jump
[21:53] through
[21:54] he didn't propel himself through he
[21:57] walked through
[21:59] it was something about that dimensional
[22:01] thing that had taken place
[22:03] with him that made him such a
[22:05] supernatural man
[22:07] but at the same time he was so
[22:09] supernatural
[22:11] but yet he still was a man
[22:14] he could eat bring me some fish
[22:18] right he was able to eat he was able to
[22:20] drink but he was just
[22:22] a god man he was the first of his
[22:26] kind hallelujah
[22:29] he said that's why the bible said i call
[22:32] you now
[22:33] brethren we're the brothers so if we're
[22:37] born
[22:38] of god and we're born in the same like
[22:40] manner
[22:41] then the potential of what jesus was and
[22:44] is is within us
[22:47] all right now let me move on everything
[22:51] that is real
[22:56] is made of these dimensions
[23:00] and what dimensions you're speaking of
[23:04] uh i'm dealing with water light
[23:08] in time
[23:12] and each cannot do without the other
[23:19] interdependence
[23:21] what is light without matter to shine
[23:24] through
[23:26] you know god said let there be light but
[23:28] if there was nothing there
[23:31] what would you see if there was
[23:34] something to see
[23:36] but because of matter we can see purple
[23:39] chairs
[23:41] gold legs yellow walls
[23:44] and all of these things are reflections
[23:47] of light
[23:49] their composition make them reflect
[23:52] different colors
[23:54] and god is the one who composed it
[23:57] you understand me so matter needs light
[24:00] and light needs matter
[24:02] now we understand time and time is the
[24:06] only thing that really
[24:07] gets on our nerve
[24:10] annoys us because we hate being late
[24:15] you know what i mean time is is such an
[24:18] essence in this particular generation
[24:20] because
[24:20] everything is moving so fast
[24:25] but can you imagine what it's going to
[24:27] be like
[24:29] without time
[24:32] nobody will be rushing there won't be
[24:34] any watches
[24:37] and no matter where you go or whatever
[24:40] you think
[24:41] you'll be on time
[24:45] it's just so beautiful because you got
[24:48] to understand this
[24:50] when these things were interrupted it
[24:53] was
[24:54] everything moved out of its position
[24:58] and only thing that could bring it back
[25:00] into play
[25:01] was jesus christ himself because he
[25:04] conquered depth
[25:05] hell and the grave and what else did he
[25:07] do
[25:09] he moved paradise
[25:12] into his proper dimension
[25:16] and that dimension was the sixth
[25:18] dimension which was under the altar
[25:21] and so you and i must understand that
[25:23] when we're born of god
[25:25] we we are translated into the real
[25:27] dimension
[25:30] that we're supposed to live in
[25:33] you say well why would you say that
[25:35] because brother branham gave a specific
[25:37] word he says
[25:38] i saw you there you were there in
[25:42] that dimension before you came here
[25:46] hallelujah do you understand i don't
[25:48] have to
[25:49] i believe it and so you guys say well
[25:52] what about times
[25:54] even so you got to realize that
[25:57] something
[25:58] took place when jesus conquered death
[26:01] hell in the grave
[26:02] a mighty thing took place i'm jumping
[26:05] but i need to
[26:07] something took place that we did not
[26:09] understand and i'ma tell you something i
[26:10] read the scriptures so many times
[26:12] psalm 24 7-10 it says lift up your hands
[26:16] o ye gates
[26:17] and be ye lift up the everlasting doors
[26:19] and the king of glory shall come
[26:21] in who is this king of glory the lord
[26:25] strong
[26:26] and mighty the lord mighty in battle
[26:29] lift up your heads o you gates even
[26:32] lift them up to your everlasting doors
[26:35] and the king of glory shall come in and
[26:38] the thinking says
[26:39] who is this king of glory the lord of
[26:42] hosts
[26:42] he is the king of glory and after that
[26:45] it says salah
[26:46] that means to meditate on it what was it
[26:49] we didn't understand that scripture i
[26:51] didn't
[26:52] i thought it was a beautiful part of of
[26:55] of the psalms you know
[26:56] what nice poetry you know what i'm
[26:58] saying
[26:59] it it it didn't have a i didn't have a
[27:01] revelation of it
[27:02] but it's in the message we understood
[27:06] that this scripture
[27:07] was referring to the resurrection of the
[27:09] old testament saints
[27:11] and we did not even know before this
[27:14] message that there had been a
[27:15] resurrection
[27:17] we didn't we did not know when when we
[27:21] read the scriptures and they said
[27:22] the graves were open and the saints
[27:24] walked around in the city and
[27:25] we didn't know we couldn't tie it
[27:28] together
[27:29] hallelujah but god took a prophet and
[27:32] let us see
[27:33] it meant that there was a resurrection
[27:36] and these people right now
[27:38] hallelujah is in their celestial bodies
[27:42] is that right paul explained it to me in
[27:45] the fifth chapter 15th chapter
[27:47] corinthians he said there's celestial
[27:49] bodies in their terrestrial bodies
[27:51] there's corruptible bodies and they're
[27:53] incorruptible bodies
[27:55] but these incorruptible bodies shall put
[27:57] on uh
[27:58] these corruptible bodies should put on
[28:00] incorruptible bodies hallelujah and he
[28:02] called them celestial
[28:05] hallelujah that means there's a heavenly
[28:07] body for me
[28:08] it's the same thing god told abraham
[28:11] abraham look at the sands of the sea
[28:13] one of these old days that they won't be
[28:16] just stand on the sea
[28:17] but there'll be stars in heaven you see
[28:20] what we're living in right now is the
[28:22] most important time
[28:25] you if you're going to be a christian
[28:27] you got to walk by yourself
[28:30] you can't allow other christians to
[28:32] influence you in the wrong way
[28:35] jesus christ himself must be your only
[28:38] lover
[28:39] y'all understand me you can love your
[28:41] friends but when it comes to the word
[28:44] right because one thing we must
[28:46] understand
[28:47] sometimes you can fellowship too much
[28:52] it's the truth you say it's that's not
[28:55] yes
[28:55] because there are times i'm talking
[28:57] personally there are times god would be
[28:59] calling me to
[29:00] pray or to read or to study and somebody
[29:03] ring up on the phone
[29:04] you want to do something
[29:07] y'all you know it's right god just tried
[29:10] you and you just failed
[29:14] we do it but when god moves on your
[29:17] heart
[29:17] and then to read to study to pray you
[29:20] must say
[29:21] no to whoever it is calling
[29:24] and it's okay to tell them i've got an
[29:26] appointment with jesus
[29:29] because god is moving on you he's trying
[29:31] to get your attention
[29:33] so that you can understand his love
[29:35] toward you
[29:38] am i making sense we're talking about
[29:41] connection
[29:42] and you and i must understand that in
[29:44] this day and time you must have
[29:46] connection
[29:47] that's why so many people come to church
[29:49] that's why so many people are not here
[29:51] they're not connected
[29:53] some people may be working that's okay
[29:55] i'm not working with those but i'm
[29:56] talking about those
[29:57] who had rather stay home and listen to
[30:00] this message
[30:01] on the youtube or whatever when they
[30:03] could have been in the presence
[30:05] hallelujah youtube is okay but it's
[30:07] nothing like being in the presence
[30:11] hallelujah and that's what people do
[30:14] right they come along and say i love the
[30:16] lord you can't love god if you don't
[30:18] know him
[30:20] and how can you say you know him when
[30:21] the bible says forsake
[30:23] not the gathering of yourselves in the
[30:26] day when you see the day approaching
[30:28] come together the more and that's what
[30:31] gets me when i see the empty chairs
[30:33] i know these people are not seeing the
[30:36] time we're living in
[30:38] god is moving people and he's changing
[30:40] character
[30:42] he's changing character this is not a
[30:45] time
[30:45] of being famous well known and all that
[30:49] that's
[30:49] nonsense the only person you want to be
[30:52] well known to
[30:53] is christ himself
[30:56] connected you you know we've we've
[30:59] i've preached a message like that one
[31:01] time before and we work with connection
[31:03] being connected you know
[31:05] can you hear me now you know nothing
[31:06] like when your phone go bad
[31:08] right you can't holly and i i said to
[31:10] the lord the other day i said if we
[31:12] could love you like
[31:13] the people of their phones and connected
[31:14] with you like we connected with our
[31:16] phones
[31:17] we won't have no problem with the devil
[31:21] hallelujah you don't think god wants you
[31:24] god warns you peter
[31:27] you got to walk circumspectly you got to
[31:29] be careful because satan desire you
[31:32] to sift you as wheat what was that that
[31:35] was a warning from god
[31:37] and the holy spirit when you're
[31:38] connected he will warn
[31:40] you hallelujah
[31:47] heaven is not one million mile
[31:50] you like miles away you know the
[31:52] probably god told us that
[31:54] i got a quote on it but i'm not it's not
[31:56] necessary see
[31:58] now you you got to understand amen that
[32:00] a lot of times people think that god
[32:02] that heaven is so far away
[32:04] and i ask you if it is where is the
[32:06] kingdom of god
[32:09] the bible says the kingdom of god is
[32:10] within you
[32:12] you can't get no closer than that
[32:17] but look what deuteronomy 30 and 14 says
[32:20] but the word is very
[32:22] nighty in thy mouth and
[32:25] in thine heart that thou mayeth do
[32:28] it so god didn't write it on tables of
[32:31] stone
[32:31] up in the heavens anywhere or you know
[32:33] we didn't have to go to egypt to read
[32:35] the pyramid and
[32:36] we don't have to be astrologists or
[32:38] understand the bible by the stars
[32:40] god put the bible in you this is why he
[32:42] says
[32:43] eat the book eat the book this is why he
[32:46] told israel
[32:47] eat the lamb because the lamb was the
[32:49] type of the book
[32:52] don't leave nothing eat the bitter and
[32:55] the sweet
[32:56] hallelujah and right now they they
[33:00] we must eat in haste because we've
[33:02] wasted a lot of time
[33:05] right israel had to eat in haste because
[33:08] that was the moment of the exodus
[33:10] and if you can't see that we're living
[33:12] right in the moment of this exodus
[33:14] something's wrong with your eyes
[33:17] i know the devil he's tricking us he's
[33:19] trying to do everything he can to keep
[33:21] us
[33:22] uh not focused but don't worry
[33:25] he can never win
[33:28] and you could never lose hallelujah
[33:31] he can never win i say it again and you
[33:34] can never lose
[33:35] because you got to understand who's
[33:37] orchestrating this this drama
[33:39] the scene has already been set
[33:42] everything is in order
[33:43] the the maestro amen is front of
[33:46] everything
[33:47] and he's the one who changes the music
[33:51] hallelujah but understand it's already
[33:55] written
[33:58] it's already on the sheets
[34:02] and there's no one in this orchestra
[34:06] that's going to change the sheets
[34:09] because god has already selected those
[34:11] who he wanted in the orchestra
[34:14] and you and i must understand that every
[34:16] minister
[34:17] amen that is of god ordained of god is
[34:20] now
[34:20] trying to get the people back to god
[34:23] because we've allowed liam to see it to
[34:25] influence us
[34:27] in such a mighty way now understand i
[34:30] thought i didn't understand this for a
[34:31] long time i
[34:32] i thought i understood it let's put it
[34:34] this way
[34:35] the bible says heaven and earth shall
[34:37] pass away
[34:39] but my words shall never pass away
[34:42] and i didn't get it every time i saw
[34:45] that
[34:46] i would see this
[34:50] but it's not this it's him
[34:53] god can never pass away he is the word
[34:57] in the beginning was the word the word
[34:58] was with god and the word was god
[35:01] everything that that that that
[35:03] everything changes but god
[35:07] you understand me although eden was like
[35:11] heaven to eat adam and eve
[35:12] it changed
[35:16] if everything's going to change every
[35:18] day changes
[35:19] hallelujah but the word which is god
[35:22] himself
[35:23] can never change every time i think
[35:27] about it
[35:27] it does something to me because it takes
[35:30] it higher than just a written word
[35:33] hallelujah it's god can never change
[35:37] he never fails he never changes
[35:42] talking about moving higher this is why
[35:44] i said my mind our minds
[35:46] must be elevated now let me tell you one
[35:48] thing i love about this great grace of
[35:50] god
[35:50] is that you can't change yourself
[35:53] but god has every change that needs to
[35:56] be made written for you
[36:01] that's powerful folks y'all i feel like
[36:04] shouting up here
[36:05] because i realize that who orders the
[36:08] steps of the righteous
[36:10] god orders the steps of the righteous
[36:13] hallelujah that means you don't even
[36:15] have nothing to do with it
[36:19] hallelujah you understand me you know
[36:22] let's go to jonah
[36:23] if jonah had anything to do with it he
[36:26] would have never ran
[36:29] but god knew jonah was going to run to
[36:32] nineveh
[36:33] god was steps ahead of him you
[36:35] understand me
[36:36] god made the boat
[36:40] waited for jonah he couldn't just get on
[36:42] any boat
[36:43] he had to get on that boat hallelujah
[36:46] had already prepared
[36:48] uh uh the the fish for him
[36:51] and already prepared nineveh
[36:54] when jonah when the well spit jonah up
[36:56] hallelujah
[37:01] you know those people you know they
[37:02] repented
[37:05] and it just amazes me just a few days
[37:07] ago this man was swallowed by a whale
[37:09] and was spit back
[37:10] up you know people take those things for
[37:14] granted
[37:15] but what if god was actually typing
[37:18] something
[37:19] nothing happens by coincidence what if
[37:22] god was using that little scenario
[37:24] to basically tell us that that's time to
[37:26] preach to nineveh
[37:27] because there's got to be somebody and
[37:29] none of it was a wicked place
[37:32] nineveh amen was full of pro just like
[37:34] los angeles and everything else
[37:36] full of drugs and everything else is
[37:38] worshiping and everything
[37:40] oh it's the truth i tell you what folks
[37:43] when i went down to north carolina there
[37:45] at the airport i could not believe the
[37:47] way those people were dressed
[37:49] honestly i i i was raised in south i
[37:52] know what north carolina used to look
[37:54] like
[37:55] but i tell you what if god ain't right
[37:57] he is right always right
[37:59] we're living in a generation of
[38:00] adulterers
[38:02] i need it would have been against the
[38:05] law in my day to walk around with
[38:08] those things on i couldn't believe it
[38:11] i had no choice but i thought to myself
[38:15] lord have mercy that's why i was praying
[38:17] lord have mercy young girls
[38:19] lord have mercy everything is just
[38:21] revealing it was terrible
[38:23] it was terrible i'm like wash me lord
[38:26] cleanse me
[38:27] you know because we're looking at the
[38:28] time and you say now wonderful
[38:31] excuse me we must understand
[38:34] that god is doing some great things
[38:38] hallelujah
[38:41] and as i said you know when god began to
[38:44] pray
[38:45] sometimes we when we begin to pray we
[38:47] think sometimes god doesn't hear our
[38:49] prayer
[38:49] but i'm gonna tell you something let me
[38:50] ask you there is nothing that can hinder
[38:52] your prayer
[38:55] he said well how can that be because god
[38:58] if god said you are justified as though
[38:59] you've never seen it in the first place
[39:02] and if you already accept it in the
[39:04] beloved the blood holds
[39:06] stands for you don't get me wrong
[39:09] because
[39:09] you got to understand the true believer
[39:12] when they make
[39:12] wrong they make it right
[39:16] immediately when when you know sometimes
[39:18] you know we get a little stubborn but
[39:19] god keep working on us until we get it
[39:22] but the truth of the matter he knows
[39:24] you're going to confess it he knows
[39:26] you're going to make it right
[39:27] this is why he gives you the holy ghost
[39:31] it's not you accepting god it's god
[39:33] accepting you
[39:37] amen daniel prayed did he not and we
[39:40] understand by god's grace when daniel
[39:42] prayed
[39:43] amen god heard him the first day and
[39:45] sometimes
[39:47] we carry on you know what we really
[39:49] don't trust him like we say we do
[39:52] because honestly if he doesn't answer
[39:54] expediently
[39:55] we feel and you we let the devil torment
[39:58] us with it
[39:59] god didn't hear you or you sinner you
[40:01] ain't right
[40:02] he brings all of those things to your
[40:04] mind and you know what we
[40:06] i'm not when i say we i'm not here
[40:07] talking about everybody but we have a
[40:09] tendency
[40:10] of believing the devil's lies over god's
[40:12] truths
[40:14] may god have mercy on us and he still
[40:16] have the patience
[40:17] to wait till we wake up right
[40:21] oh yes you say well brother looks what
[40:23] i'm saying let me tell you something
[40:24] god wants us to be so in contact with
[40:27] him that even if our best friend say
[40:29] something wrong
[40:30] we can correct him
[40:34] you think peter wouldn't come close to
[40:36] god
[40:37] and peter thought he was doing it right
[40:41] right oh lord you're not going to die
[40:43] but it's already written he was
[40:45] and then god jesus turned right to peter
[40:48] says satan
[40:49] now what did was jesus looking at he was
[40:52] in another dimension he could see what
[40:54] was influencing peter
[40:55] he wasn't calling peter satan you think
[40:58] he was going to make peter
[41:00] and peter be satan you think he was
[41:01] going to make him the the
[41:03] the chief preacher on pentecost no
[41:07] he saw the anointing that was working
[41:10] with him
[41:11] now every anointing is dealt with
[41:13] differently
[41:14] is that right oh it's the truth we think
[41:17] oh it's a devil it might well be a devil
[41:20] anything that is the lies of a devil
[41:23] right
[41:23] and remember the young man the man who
[41:25] says you know you know he
[41:27] he he he tried to exercise his wife and
[41:29] said come out of her satan
[41:32] and it almost calls for for divorce
[41:35] ah yes it was satan it was the devil
[41:39] anointing her but that was not god's way
[41:43] of casting him out see that's the thing
[41:46] we feel like words can just do it but
[41:47] god
[41:48] you don't always do it that way
[41:50] sometimes just to touch
[41:52] sometimes a laying of hands right
[41:55] sometimes words sometimes action and
[41:57] what the prophet told him to do
[41:59] go buy her some flowers
[42:02] right bring some love in this picture
[42:05] and it changed things
[42:07] see so what i'm trying to say is in
[42:10] order to be elevated in order to
[42:11] continue on
[42:12] we must be connected with god in such a
[42:14] way that we can understand what god
[42:17] wants
[42:17] us to do in certain situations that will
[42:19] give him glory
[42:21] because all of this is about giving
[42:23] glory to god
[42:25] your life you have none forget it
[42:28] get over it your life now is given to
[42:31] christ
[42:32] at least that's the way it should be
[42:34] he'll never take second place
[42:36] he'll never take third place he only
[42:38] will take first place
[42:40] and you and i must understand he must
[42:42] come first he's going to keep
[42:44] driving you he's going to keep putting
[42:45] you on your knees he's going to keep
[42:47] doing what's necessary for you your eyes
[42:50] to open
[42:51] to see that he must be first and when
[42:54] you realize he's first
[42:55] then you'll understand why what it was
[42:57] all about his love towards you
[43:03] this is a beautiful situation amen
[43:06] and so we understand that this is what
[43:08] what could only restore
[43:10] see the purpose of this message and the
[43:13] open book is to return a man
[43:16] is to bring heaven and earth back
[43:19] into a perfect union
[43:24] and we saw it we didn't understand it
[43:26] when jesus was there to be baptized by
[43:28] john
[43:29] and and and the voice of heaven the dove
[43:31] descended and the voice of heaven said
[43:33] this is my beloved son
[43:35] in whom i'm well pleased to dwell in we
[43:37] didn't understand heaven and earth was
[43:39] kissing
[43:40] that was a kiss that was a union he was
[43:43] the first man
[43:44] amen that literally brought earth and
[43:47] heaven
[43:48] together and now this is why the holy
[43:51] ghost comes
[43:52] the holy ghost come to bring heaven and
[43:54] earth together
[43:55] back to that place before the fall
[43:58] hallelujah
[43:59] that's why the prophet god kept telling
[44:01] us it's not just jumping it's not just
[44:02] shouting
[44:03] it's life and once we are surrendered
[44:06] the more that i surrender
[44:07] the light of the lord the more i
[44:10] surrender
[44:10] i find out that this is what he's been
[44:13] wanting me to do all along
[44:14] surrender my will to his and once we get
[44:18] to that complete surrender
[44:20] you become invincible omnipotent
[44:24] you and god becomes what and at that
[44:28] time he could use you
[44:29] just the way he used adam before he fell
[44:34] hallelujah but the only way the only way
[44:37] to bring this back to a unity we needed
[44:40] an
[44:40] alter unadulterated word
[44:44] person that's how you phrase it
[44:48] unadulterated word person we needed that
[44:52] that's where jesus comes in he's the
[44:54] only thing the only one
[44:56] that could restore back to god what the
[44:59] first adam fell to
[45:01] you heard me say that last week or the
[45:03] last time i was here that's why he says
[45:05] father
[45:06] not my will but thine be done
[45:09] that means jesus could have he
[45:12] could have said lord i don't want to do
[45:14] it
[45:15] but he failed to do it he looked at us
[45:17] and he saw the cause
[45:19] and the bible said he set his face like
[45:21] a flint
[45:22] in other words he wasn't going to take
[45:24] nothing the devil was saying
[45:26] i was telling this the other day i said
[45:28] you know what many times you don't know
[45:29] what you can take and what you can bear
[45:32] but i found out the devil is a liar he
[45:34] called those things that are strong
[45:37] weak because they looked at jesus he was
[45:39] weak
[45:41] they looked at him and they saw him he
[45:43] wouldn't open his mouth when they spat
[45:45] on him
[45:46] they he they slapped him they they they
[45:49] did it
[45:50] they blasphemed him and he wouldn't open
[45:52] it but in the eyes of the public
[45:54] that was weakness can you imagine what
[45:57] rome this is your king
[45:58] what is that huh
[46:01] but you don't understand when you are
[46:03] sold out to god
[46:06] when god is the center and the strength
[46:08] of your life
[46:09] you become a real lamb
[46:12] when they mock you when they curse you
[46:14] when they say things to you
[46:15] that that's not not appropriate you can
[46:18] still keep your mouth shut
[46:20] you say i can't do it yes you can if you
[46:23] were in him you did it then
[46:24] and can do it now oh i gotta say no
[46:28] you don't as long as you gotta say it
[46:31] god gonna keep bringing it to the place
[46:33] you could get to a place where you said
[46:35] i don't have to say it and i won't say
[46:37] it
[46:38] they call that weakness they call love
[46:42] weakness compassion weakness i'm talking
[46:45] about message people
[46:47] people who ought to know better but we
[46:49] our mouths
[46:50] places us in bondage because we don't
[46:53] know how to keep them shut
[46:54] we don't know how to stop talking when
[46:56] god says
[46:57] don't talk a wise man knows not know how
[47:01] not to talk
[47:02] james said if you can't even brighten
[47:03] your tongue your religion is in vain
[47:07] you have no covering you feel like you
[47:09] got to say what's on your mind
[47:11] that's the problem say what's on jesus
[47:13] mind and you'll be okay
[47:15] but when you're saying what's on your
[47:16] mind that is the devil influencing you
[47:19] keeping you from your perfection you've
[47:22] got to suffer people
[47:24] and god is not going to bring forth
[47:26] goats out of this
[47:27] all lambs the lamb book of life
[47:30] not goats sheep and goats are separated
[47:33] at the at the second
[47:34] uh the last generation uh resurrection
[47:38] am i making sense revelations 21 3 says
[47:41] and i heard a great voice out of heaven
[47:43] saying behold the tabernacle of god is
[47:46] with man and he will dwell with them
[47:48] and they shall be his people and and god
[47:51] himself
[47:52] shall be with them and be their god now
[47:54] when is that going to take place not
[47:55] when you get over yonder
[47:57] over there not over there here
[48:01] it must begin here you are the
[48:02] tabernacle of god
[48:04] you and i are the people that god has
[48:06] purchased his blood purchased
[48:08] you uh with his blood you're the ones
[48:10] who god is now
[48:11] infusing himself into
[48:17] glory to god what are you saying whether
[48:19] you see it or not i'm moving up higher
[48:23] i'm not the same man i used to be and
[48:26] one of these old days
[48:27] this old model will put on immortality
[48:30] hallelujah oh we'll be changing the
[48:33] moment of between the night
[48:34] why because the inner man is moving up
[48:37] higher
[48:38] this whole flesh amen will will be
[48:40] changed hallelujah
[48:41] because of the inner man hallelujah
[48:44] right now the inner man in this flesh
[48:47] are not
[48:48] compatible and so therefore you got to
[48:50] kill him
[48:51] you got to shut him up you got to put
[48:53] him down amen so that the inner man can
[48:56] grow
[48:56] and that's what paul said we must grow
[48:58] up into him
[49:00] our goal is to be just like jesus
[49:04] more than just a song oh i want to be
[49:05] like him no sir you've got to know and
[49:08] know that you want to be like him
[49:09] from your heart and not from your head
[49:13] hallelujah if you want to be like him
[49:15] you would be just like him
[49:16] like i said you're the purpose god has
[49:19] put you that has the purpose
[49:20] the whole thing like i said everything
[49:22] that's moving for the bride is moving
[49:24] for you
[49:25] you know and you know you know i've seen
[49:27] myself in esther
[49:28] and i've seen myself in gideon and how
[49:31] gideon says lord
[49:32] i don't heard of many things told i've
[49:34] seen what brother branham did in his age
[49:36] and everything else we know those things
[49:37] are true but if god be with us we'll be
[49:39] the miracles
[49:41] and i understand one thing the upper
[49:42] hand that we got
[49:44] because we understand it ain't just the
[49:46] anointing
[49:48] brother brandon says it's the right
[49:49] anointing anointed one is the end time
[49:52] he says it's the right anointing but the
[49:55] difference that makes the difference
[49:57] between you and us
[49:58] them and us is the word you understand
[50:02] that's being anointed
[50:04] hallelujah janice and james was anointed
[50:07] they did just as much as moses did
[50:11] hallelujah but it was a moses anointing
[50:14] that ate and swallowed up theirs so you
[50:17] got to understand
[50:17] you and i must understand at the end of
[50:19] the day it doesn't matter
[50:21] how anointed men are and it's just the
[50:24] truth
[50:26] even in our ranks we see the deed of the
[50:28] nicolaitans
[50:30] men anointed men controlling god's bride
[50:34] where
[50:35] that's wrong we're not here to control
[50:38] you
[50:39] we're here to lead you god is the
[50:42] controller
[50:43] and when you get men who usurp their
[50:46] authority to control you by their own
[50:48] power it's what the ephesus age hated
[50:53] the deed of the nicole agent became a
[50:55] doctrine and then you had
[50:57] bishops and kings and all that stuff
[50:59] don't you see that same spirit
[51:01] is anointing the people around the
[51:03] message there are no great men among us
[51:07] no great preachers brother i'm saying it
[51:09] does not matter
[51:10] how much word you understand how great
[51:12] your revelation
[51:13] he said that's not it it's your
[51:16] character
[51:18] it's your character and when you see
[51:20] people i don't care if they got
[51:22] thousands of followers listen that's
[51:24] nothing lucifer had more than that
[51:27] and i'm going to tell you something
[51:28] there's not a preacher like lucifer
[51:31] nobody can preach like him they
[51:34] understand me
[51:34] when it comes to the anointing and the
[51:37] dynamics and
[51:38] the theatrics and the drama he can do it
[51:41] watch the preachers out there in the
[51:43] world
[51:45] intellectuals influenced by their words
[51:47] and how they articulate
[51:49] what does that have to do with god he's
[51:52] simple
[51:55] but powerful everything he preached is
[51:57] simple
[51:58] but truth but they don't want the
[52:01] simplicity
[52:02] you start preaching on people's lives
[52:04] they don't want it that's when you know
[52:06] they don't know god because true
[52:09] believers they don't care how you slice
[52:11] it and dice it
[52:12] they say amen
[52:16] we're going to go up higher we've got to
[52:18] stop looking at all of this stuff and
[52:20] thinking that because people got mega
[52:22] churches and big churches they god with
[52:23] them what y'all
[52:24] talking about there was a great preacher
[52:26] that i know of
[52:27] at the end of the day didn't have number
[52:29] 12 disciples and one of them was the
[52:30] devil
[52:32] and there was no greater preacher than
[52:33] jesus
[52:35] hallelujah his his ministry was far
[52:38] above the pharisees and the sadducees
[52:40] but they had the greater churches and
[52:42] god called them devils too
[52:46] look what happens when people lift folks
[52:47] up oh he had to peel a fire when
[52:49] he the angel in this picture he had an
[52:51] angel with him so
[52:52] what when the supernatural of things
[52:56] deter the bride the bride is not built
[52:59] upon signs
[53:00] she's built upon word
[53:04] that's what's going wrong with people oh
[53:06] where he walked with brother brown
[53:08] what's that got to do with it
[53:10] millions walk with moses and i we don't
[53:12] know how many mark with jesus
[53:17] but it means
[53:21] nothing you say well what do you mean
[53:23] you should oh well they can go all up
[53:24] let me tell you something
[53:25] the bible said to loser for why are you
[53:27] walking up here what you doing now
[53:29] he went on earth he was in a dimension
[53:33] where jesus could see him
[53:35] huh oh i'm walking about what seeking
[53:38] who i can devour
[53:39] and god says have you considered my
[53:41] servant
[53:43] job and the devil says yeah
[53:46] i have and every time i try to test him
[53:49] and try him nothing can get through
[53:51] because you got a wall around him
[53:55] hallelujah that's the way i like it
[53:58] when god the devil can testify that god
[54:00] has a wall
[54:04] the devil said yeah he's your pet you've
[54:06] got to walk around let me tell you
[54:08] something
[54:08] you better understand that god got a
[54:10] wall around you
[54:12] the devil would have ate you alive long
[54:14] time ago had not god been with you
[54:17] people is real this thing is real
[54:22] you know what i'm gonna tell you
[54:23] something i see who i am more now than i
[54:26] ever have
[54:27] and you know what uh it had to take god
[54:31] to show it to me
[54:32] but i'm gonna tell you something the
[54:34] things that i worried about before i
[54:35] left here is not what i worry about now
[54:38] i don't even care what the devil is
[54:41] going to do and he's doing
[54:42] because i one i know one thing for
[54:44] certain there are two influences
[54:47] one is of god and one is of the devil
[54:56] and when you know who you are
[55:01] who are you brother brooks the grass
[55:04] withers
[55:05] and the flowers fade away but the word
[55:08] of the lord
[55:10] shall stand he ain't talking
[55:15] about this only
[55:18] he's talking about you
[55:22] nothing can defeat the word
[55:25] not in this day miss adam the first one
[55:29] she failed she failed
[55:30] but brother i'm saying this bride is
[55:32] ordained to stand
[55:35] hallelujah she cannot fall and no matter
[55:39] what the devil tries to do
[55:41] he cannot she's ordained
[55:45] to trample upon him
[55:48] just a mighty just a quote listen
[55:52] a lot of people don't like this one but
[55:54] i'm going to bring it to you
[55:56] the mighty conqueror 1957.
[56:00] brother brown said a man under pressure
[56:02] is what he
[56:03] is when he's under pressure his
[56:06] real to true characteristics will show
[56:10] when he's under pressure get him all
[56:13] riled
[56:14] stirred up then you'll see the real man
[56:17] come out
[56:19] if he got temper it'll show itself
[56:22] if he's meek and gentle it shows itself
[56:26] put him under pressure once and god
[56:30] puts all of his children on the test to
[56:33] see whether there are
[56:34] any flaws in them and as long as we have
[56:38] these flaws you're going to be tried and
[56:41] tested
[56:42] until you overcome hallelujah you
[56:45] understand that
[56:46] so we understand by god's grace amen
[56:49] gideon
[56:49] didn't understand he was the very
[56:51] purpose of god i'm almost done
[56:54] you're the purpose
[56:57] we're here now to defeat
[57:02] all the enemies of the devil
[57:05] however they come you understand the
[57:08] battles
[57:09] gideon was in a uh uh i don't know what
[57:12] you want to say back since citizen state
[57:14] but he didn't even realize and recognize
[57:16] who he was but god calls him
[57:18] mighty man available who is that but the
[57:20] bride of jesus christ
[57:23] she becomes him that's the only reason
[57:24] why you become a mighty man of healer
[57:27] that's the only reason why he is the
[57:28] mighty conqueror
[57:30] paul said but we're more than a
[57:32] conqueror hallelujah
[57:34] hey y'all don't heard the story the man
[57:36] goes out and he works all day he brings
[57:37] forth the check and he gives the check
[57:39] to his wife
[57:40] who's the conqueror he's the conqueror
[57:43] but she got the check she's more than a
[57:44] conqueror
[57:46] that's how it is with us christ paid the
[57:49] price
[57:50] jesus christ paid all the price for us
[57:53] folks it's just because of the lack of
[57:55] faith
[57:55] in the lack of believing the word of god
[57:58] it's the truth he healeth all your
[58:00] diseases
[58:02] he forgives you of all your iniquities
[58:04] and the bible
[58:05] and the devil makes you say we got you
[58:07] know oh i'm sick that means i got this
[58:09] happen that
[58:10] no no all my disease has been healed is
[58:13] healed
[58:14] all of my sicknesses all my sins have
[58:16] been forgiven
[58:17] not some all so if they're all done if
[58:21] it's all done
[58:22] satan has no right to hold me in prison
[58:26] and the only reason why he holds you is
[58:27] because you're weak in your faith
[58:30] oh ye of little faith he said where did
[58:32] you doubt
[58:33] that's god putting you to the test
[58:37] every time you come to a test every day
[58:39] you come to a test and god is expecting
[58:41] you to win
[58:46] hallelujah
[58:49] there you are
[58:52] you've got to recognize your part in the
[58:54] pride
[58:55] that's the thing a lot of people are not
[58:57] recognizing where we are
[58:58] we're a translation we're at a place of
[59:00] translation now that means we've got to
[59:02] walk with god
[59:03] not company with friends nothing wrong
[59:06] with that if everybody's walking with
[59:08] god
[59:09] y'all understand me hallelujah i know
[59:12] what it's like
[59:13] even when i was in the pentecostal
[59:14] church sometime when it was time to go
[59:16] to church
[59:16] you know what our friend says oh let's
[59:18] go to someone's own let's go eat let's
[59:19] go do this
[59:20] no y'all go ahead i'm going to church
[59:23] but friends do that
[59:25] they miss church because somebody is
[59:27] inspired by the devil and they don't
[59:29] even know it
[59:30] how can you say to go eat or to go
[59:32] fellowship when the word of god is being
[59:35] preached
[59:36] that's the devil you say it is yes
[59:39] it's the devil when the gods worship
[59:42] come together the more
[59:43] not fellowship around the table that's
[59:45] not it it's important to hear the word
[59:47] for your day
[59:48] to understand what god is doing moving
[59:51] this is why god anoints
[59:53] preachers so you can see what his next
[59:55] move is
[59:56] but what if you're not at church you
[59:58] don't get it
[1:00:00] you see the people come to church even
[1:00:02] on sunday they still coming
[1:00:03] half hour late you know if i moved it up
[1:00:05] to 10 o'clock you know what time they
[1:00:07] get here
[1:00:08] 10 30. you can move it all you want to
[1:00:11] it's the devil's it's devils whether
[1:00:14] they believe it or not i don't care
[1:00:15] traditions but it's
[1:00:16] devils those devils are causing people
[1:00:20] to be late and
[1:00:21] i disrespectful and then when when they
[1:00:23] come in
[1:00:24] they expect a preacher to preach how can
[1:00:26] he preach
[1:00:27] when you you you greed the holy ghost
[1:00:31] don't tell me if walking in church late
[1:00:34] doesn't agree
[1:00:34] now there are times you can't help but
[1:00:36] to be late things happen but when people
[1:00:38] are coming in the same schedule i hope
[1:00:42] some i'm listening to me tonight
[1:00:44] because you know the truth of the matter
[1:00:46] is it's evil
[1:00:48] and god is not happy
[1:00:51] he's not they're wondering why things
[1:00:54] happen in deaths and
[1:00:55] all kinds of stuff happening in people's
[1:00:57] lives and you know they don't understand
[1:00:59] they're the corporate
[1:01:02] evil shall not come now your dwelling
[1:01:05] place
[1:01:06] that's the bible
[1:01:16] everlasting life and how i'm gonna read
[1:01:18] this quote number stop
[1:01:20] but when you stay in the kingdom stay
[1:01:23] in the gospel stay right one of these
[1:01:27] days god will
[1:01:28] call you out and set you aside
[1:01:32] adopt you as his son before the people
[1:01:36] and give you something that will shake
[1:01:38] the nation with it
[1:01:40] see what i mean it's the adoption into
[1:01:43] the family
[1:01:44] and my prom my thing is how many you
[1:01:46] know
[1:01:47] is trying to move in that direction
[1:01:50] we've got too many things
[1:01:52] we've got too many things that's
[1:01:55] blocking us
[1:01:58] lay aside every weight and the sin that
[1:02:01] does not easily
[1:02:02] besets you sometimes you gotta walk
[1:02:05] alone
[1:02:06] but i'm gonna tell you tonight people of
[1:02:08] god even to those who are listening
[1:02:10] you better put god first if you don't
[1:02:13] know how to ask him how to
[1:02:16] ask god for his grace and his mercy
[1:02:18] repent before him because
[1:02:19] you know we've been guilty of not
[1:02:22] putting him first
[1:02:24] he's got to come first people he can't
[1:02:27] come second or third he ain't going to
[1:02:28] work with you like that
[1:02:30] you've got to give him all your body
[1:02:32] mind soul your spirit you know i said
[1:02:34] love the lord with all your heart and
[1:02:35] mind
[1:02:36] that still stands and by god's grace if
[1:02:40] you want to see
[1:02:41] yourself elevated you want to see things
[1:02:43] change and happening on the inside of
[1:02:45] you
[1:02:45] you put god first and when you when you
[1:02:47] put him second ask for his forgiveness
[1:02:49] he says lord give me grace
[1:02:51] you know what i mean you gotta put him
[1:02:53] first
[1:02:55] he's the king of kings and the lords of
[1:02:57] lords
[1:02:59] and i say this again this is why i'm
[1:03:01] gonna tell you people
[1:03:02] this is what i see and if i'm wrong lord
[1:03:05] forgive me
[1:03:06] but i see so many people who claim to
[1:03:09] have the holy ghost and
[1:03:10] when you got the holy ghost that doesn't
[1:03:13] mean you don't make mistakes
[1:03:16] but one thing i know about the leading
[1:03:17] of the holy ghost
[1:03:19] the holy ghost will lead you to church
[1:03:24] is that right and brother branham said
[1:03:26] it
[1:03:27] he said even if you don't have a church
[1:03:29] to go to they believe what you believe
[1:03:31] go get a slice
[1:03:34] and some of us are staying home ain't no
[1:03:35] message church around here
[1:03:37] that ain't what the prophet struck
[1:03:39] instructed us to do
[1:03:42] and we so righteous and so
[1:03:43] self-righteous but i'm gonna tell you
[1:03:44] something
[1:03:45] sometimes that simple gospel that some
[1:03:47] of these people preach
[1:03:48] will help you
[1:03:54] yeah people think it's the depth of the
[1:03:56] word let me tell you something who can
[1:03:58] preach as deep as jesus
[1:04:01] huh and he wasn't a screamer and a
[1:04:03] holler like like i am
[1:04:05] he talked with such a low voice
[1:04:10] but when he when he spoke never a man
[1:04:13] spake like this man before
[1:04:17] see it's the anointing that flows with
[1:04:19] the word that makes the difference
[1:04:22] and it doesn't make any difference you
[1:04:24] know i look a thing and i said oh
[1:04:26] even among the message we want to
[1:04:27] entertain us we want all of that
[1:04:31] look how many years we've been
[1:04:32] entertained and what good has it
[1:04:34] has it done still fussing and fighting
[1:04:38] preachers and everything else oh brother
[1:04:39] books don't say that well it's happening
[1:04:40] everywhere
[1:04:43] everywhere but not among the bride
[1:04:48] bride don't fight bride i don't care i
[1:04:51] don't care
[1:04:52] what they claim to be bride do not
[1:04:55] fight bride and i'm gonna tell you
[1:04:57] something bride
[1:04:58] do not try
[1:05:02] to get preeminence
[1:05:05] read your scripture there's a brother in
[1:05:07] the new testament that love preeminence
[1:05:09] i can't pronounce his name
[1:05:11] that's not bride bride walks together
[1:05:15] like sheep walk together we we watch
[1:05:18] each other we help each other
[1:05:21] you know i i was thinking about the
[1:05:22] early church and i'm almost done with
[1:05:23] this
[1:05:24] until we get to a place where we love
[1:05:26] each other don't even say you love god
[1:05:30] that's the bible oh i love the lord and
[1:05:33] you can't stand sister so-and-so and you
[1:05:35] can't
[1:05:35] speak to sister so and so because you
[1:05:37] think you're more righteous than sister
[1:05:39] so and so a brother so and so
[1:05:40] that's nonsense you're the one that's in
[1:05:42] bondage and you're deceived
[1:05:47] you're deceived jesus could have
[1:05:49] fellowship with prostitutes and
[1:05:51] everything else and then we're too
[1:05:52] righteous because we feel like we're
[1:05:53] going to be defiled
[1:05:56] oh my god help us jesus no this church
[1:06:00] this church this des moines church we
[1:06:03] need help
[1:06:05] we need help in this little assembly i
[1:06:07] see so many different cliques
[1:06:10] and they get out there and they
[1:06:11] preaching another message all over again
[1:06:13] gossiping and all that kind of stuff
[1:06:14] they do
[1:06:15] just come out of church
[1:06:19] and you don't think the spirit of god is
[1:06:20] grieved by that stuff and you don't
[1:06:22] think he tells me things
[1:06:24] i'm no great one but i know one thing i
[1:06:26] know when i see unity
[1:06:28] i know what it looks like
[1:06:33] may god help us young brothers those of
[1:06:35] you who are here may god bless you
[1:06:38] may god all of us who here today may god
[1:06:40] bless you and i know those who wanted to
[1:06:42] come
[1:06:42] i may god bless you keep on the firing
[1:06:46] line that's right uh this is a pressing
[1:06:49] time you don't think it's easy
[1:06:51] god doesn't shook us up with this corona
[1:06:55] and we need to understand that's the
[1:06:56] lord's doing
[1:06:58] the devil might have sent it but god had
[1:07:00] a purpose behind it
[1:07:02] and you think this is the worst that is
[1:07:03] to come
[1:07:05] no what is he doing he's trying to
[1:07:08] prepare
[1:07:09] us to connect connect
[1:07:12] the whole time the plagues were falling
[1:07:14] on egypt god had a connection there in
[1:07:17] goshen
[1:07:18] connection trying to get us to see this
[1:07:21] is your last time
[1:07:23] you're not going to repeat this and once
[1:07:24] you die however you die brother adam
[1:07:27] said that's how
[1:07:28] you however you go down is how you go up
[1:07:30] and the character of christ must be in
[1:07:32] you
[1:07:33] press toward it forget about you forget
[1:07:36] about yourself
[1:07:37] let god let go and let god it's not
[1:07:40] worth holding on to
[1:07:41] anything people not this day and time
[1:07:44] not this hour

[1:07:49] enjoyed that song brother isaac
