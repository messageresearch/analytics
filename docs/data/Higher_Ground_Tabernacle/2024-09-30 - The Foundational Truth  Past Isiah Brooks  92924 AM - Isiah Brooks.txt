the help he has helped us and uh down in Iowa City and here in the morning we appreciate him matter of fact we appreciate all our ministers amen we've got some young ones coming up and uh we thank God for them God has been has really used and has been using them in a mighty way see it's not the age wisdom is not not age wisdom is God so you'll know that by the grace of God As We Stand I thank God for my lovely wife I don't want to talk too much cuz I end up crying but I I do thank God for the 47 years we have spent together amen [Applause] and you got to know when you you got a lovely wife and then you got all your children living that's such a blessing amen so you know one thing my mother was good at we we were we were born very poor and uh my father left my my mom with nine children single mom raising nine children I only would see my mother sometimes on the weekend that cuz she worked very hard she was not educated so she had to do a lot of Labor work but one thing that my mother did do she showed every last one of her children how much she loved them and when my mom died not one of my siblings could have ever accused her for not loving them and I pray that God gives me that kind of a record that if the Lord would take me at any time my children would know that how I love them so much so I would die for them readily whether they right or wrong because that's what my god did for me and that while I was yet a sinner Christ died for me as we We Stand First Corinthians the third chapter then we'll go from 1 Corinthians to St John 4 reading from the 10th verse according to the grace of God which is given unto me as a wise master builder I have laid the foundation and another build it thereon but every man take heed how he built it thereon for other foundations can no man lay than that is laid that's right which is Jesus Christ St John [Music] 4 and seven there cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water listen to this and Jesus saith unto her give me to drink I never saw her like I see it now he asked her to give him a drink same chapter let's drop down to the 14th verse but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a wh of water springing up into eternal [Music] life the woman saith unto him sir give me this water that I thirst not neither come hether to draw Hallelujah hallu let us pray our gracious father God we come before you as humbly as we know how there's no hiding place you know how going forth and our coming in you know our thoughts are far off Hallelujah glory to God the only hiding place we find from your righteous judgment Hallelujah is within your dear son Jesus Christ father we pray this morning that you bless each and every one of us give us this grace that we need to make a 100 we realize that everything is forming into a a great uh Machinery but all of these things are being done for your little bride and you said fear not little bride it is your father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom Lord we're resting on that we believe believe that and we receive that bless this congregation people who you purchased by your blood in your name Jesus Christ we pray amen amen you may be seated when I read the message I'm always excited something always get my attention right now I I just feel like flying away honestly I feel so good yesterday I was very tired the day before then I was tired but Prayer Changes Things I think through this journey that we're all taking we learn as we go and in our learning we progress to what we call maturity I don't know whether everybody understand uh the mighty revelation of this message because we've had so many different angles and so much teachings when in simp in Simplicity is God giving his people Grace this Capstone Revelation is greater than all Revelations because it is the unveiling of God male and female hallelujah hallelujah one thing I know if you really take this message seriously you will always want more of him and the more you get the more you want my subject this morning will be the foundational truth I love this because not only was Jesus the Cornerstone but the same Cornerstone became the headstone and to me that is such a complete idea that God is the beginning and he is the ending he is the first and he is the last now when we talk about a foundation it is a basis or groundwork of anything the moral Foundation of both society and religion is that right the natural or prepared ground or base on which structures rest y'all get that word it it rests on the foundation no matter how fabulous a house is built it is no stronger than the foundation of which it's been built if the foundation is no good the house will crumble I know what I'm talking about so we must understand there's only one foundation and that Foundation is Jesus Christ I'm saying this because in order to go forward in this message you must understand that you are beyond the seven Church ages I didn't say it was over I said you're beyond because God in this message took us out of Lea and placed us into what we call the bride age I love this because our covenant is the greatest Covenant ever given to mankind hallu Hallelujah absolutely now the thing that I love is because I read the scripture in John where the Samaritan woman and we know who she is she's well known as a woman who had many husbands Hallelujah but Jesus never looked at her condition y'all hear what I'm saying because before the foundation of the world he knew her can I say it like this there is no trap that Satan can put the seed of God in that God can't get them out of oh my God y'all better hear what I'm saying because I want you recognize the grace of God brother bam said God works on both ends Hallelujah but here was this woman going out to get water and the Lord has already talked and spoke to Jesus and say go stand by the well Hallelujah I got somebody I want you to talk to Hallelujah now Jesus standing by the well you know why I'm preaching this cuz I'm tired of legalism I'm tired of the legalist if you continue as a legalist in hell will you lift up your eyes that's pretty strong isn't it so let me say it again if you continue as a legalist in hell you lift up your eyes if the Pharisees couldn't make it neither will you and the Bible says accept your righteousness exce the righteousness of the legalist of the Pharisees Hallelujah you have no part of me I think I got everybody's [Music] attention if God had been a legalist he never would have talked with that woman don't look at me like y'all innocent what you didn't do in the natural you did it in the spiritual Hallelujah we living in what we call a generation God said it as adulterous generation oh y'all don't like that right but here Jesus said to this woman and y'all know the conversation but think about it if this woman was so defiled if she was so wicked how can she give Jesus a drink of water it was against all Customs it was against all the laws Hallelujah but here was Jesus y'all either come to worship God and if you don't come if you're not here to worship God you we come to worship God this morning I don't need no hindrances you understand me so let's move on and his disciples as brother BR said was standing in the bush standing somewhere watching him and Discerning whether the word is right like some of you this morning morning already Discerning whether the word is Right Hallelujah but I'm going to bring it this morning because we need to know that the grace of God continues it doesn't stop hallelujah hallelujah give me a drink of water then the woman says you you asking me Hallelujah it's not a good thing for a Jew to have fellowship with a Samaritan Lord I'm not going to go this is just a beginning of what I'm trying to say see because whether you know it or not the scripture doesn't say it but there was a deep call in that woman and that deep call got the attention of God Almighty when nobody else knew that this woman was thirsty not for the natural water she was thirsting for the living water and there was only one person who could give that to her and that was Jesus Christ himself what a Time impeccable timing hallelujah hallelujah perfect in itself perfect in itself Hallelujah that God would take somebody like me and cause that person to go to the well I don't know about you I had tried every religion there was but I still was thirsty Hallelujah there was something crying out on on the inside of me there's got to be more that religion oh come on somebody even brother brandom says that that woman had a greater teaching than the Pharisees had Hallelujah because she was able to recognize the Messiah when they they could not recognize the Messiah Hallelujah hallu go get your husband she said I have not his disciple says oh oh he looked like he going missed this one but then Jesus replied you had five and the one that you have is not yours come on somebody maybe you've never been a Methodist maybe you've never been a Baptist maybe you've never been a Pentecostal maybe you've never been a Catholic but I've had all of them as my husband Hallelujah and I didn't realize Hallelujah that I have been married to a sister somebody help me here but here Jesus is introducing a new doctrine Hallelujah a new doctrine something that's greater than the Baptist one that's greater than the Methodist one that's greater than the Catholic one that's greater than all denominations Hallelujah he says listen listen she said my my my my my background is we worshiped God on this mountain and then Jesus said you don't even know what you worshiping yes that that's how it is when you in a system you don't know what your worship be Hallelujah but he said my father seeketh those who will worship me or worship Him in spirit and in truth y'all hear what I'm saying I can be in a cow pastor and worship God I can be in a bank and worship God I can be in prison and worship God hallelujah I have no boundaries when it comes to worshiping God come on somebody if a place it it was significant for the worshiping of God we will be lost cuz where would this place be Hallelujah but God chose a body let me move on see when there's a deep calling to the Deep there is one to respond the Bible said he that cometh to God must first believe that he is God and that he's a reward of them that diligently seek him you can't even worship God if you don't believe he's God you can't have faith if you don't believe he's God hallelujah and Jesus Christ is a revelation not to a group but to individuals this is why you see some people really excited they can't help themselves Hallelujah because they've had that well experience somebody help me here they met a man who said to them give you Waters Everlasting Waters springing up into eternal life come on somebody that means my joy does not have a lid on it I don't have a lid on my joy Hallelujah my life does not have a lid on it the more comes the more that goes brings on more Hallelujah more God more God more power more strength more faith more everything hallelujah hallelujah the word may flesh is who he is he Jesus Christ was to clothe the Elohim [Music] he who was before there ever was a beginning Hallelujah my God is I don't know you understand what I'm saying that's my Foundation That's My Capstone that's my finisher y'all understand me he spoke time into existence so time is under his authority and y'all don't believe me huh Joshua said Sun stand still Hallelujah he was a Son of God but the Son of God had power cuz that power and authority was given to him is that right but the Bible said after which the Holy Ghost has come upon you you shall receive power come on somebody this is not a whole soul this is a no soul Hallelujah before there was nothing and we can't even Envision Envision nothing before he was before there was nothing do you know God created nothing it wasn't nothing than God because if it was nothing before God then nothing would have been God hallelujah but it was God before there ever was nothing you say well what wait wait wait a minute brother so that means that God is the controller of nothing is that right that little woman who had just a few a little bit of meal and a little bit of oil she said if when we eat this we won't have nothing Hallelujah but the God who created nothing say if you would serve me first your nothing will become something and it will never run out Hallelujah that's right you might come to this message as a Christian Hallelujah me you may not have nothing but you got a trust in the god that can take nothing and bring it into something Hallelujah but how I'm going to do this brother Brooks you got to give him first you make him first and God will turn your nothing into something Hallelujah yes sir he's still the Creator he is the inexhaustible founding of Life Hallelujah and we think we know what life is what we experience here is not life it's perversion it's a perversion of Life what we got on the inside is life y'all hear what I'm saying that's real life Hallelujah and this life on the inside is inexhaustable what do you mean without water you can't live wo somebody help me here without water you can't live and that woman Jesus said see that's the problem we we come to Jesus we want to say Lord what could you do for me and Jesus is saying what can you do for me it ain't what God God done did all he's done it all now is our time to serve him hallelujah oh glory is that right remember when when Mary received of God she never left his side when you get the real deal never turn back Hallelujah you'll follow Jesus even un your [Applause] death I'm dealing with the foundation still because I want you to know the foundation is Jesus Christ hallelujah hallelujah what did Jesus say I did not come to condemn you but I came to give you life that you may have it more abundantly remember I said I said this the other day there is now no condemnation to those who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit hallelujah hallelujah so my preaching is not here to condemn you but my preaching is here to convict you yall understand me cuz I can't condemn you God has already pardon you Hallelujah but the word of God is here to chastise you to bring you to a place of change hallelujah hallelujah see the message opens the door for the Believers to receive more God as I said never putting a lid on it we can't it's Eternal it has no beginning it has no ending hallelujah look what the prophet of God is saying what was the Holy Ghost given for paragraph 36 he said notice now what taking place God pouring himself into them now the church has got to be to a [Music] place from Luther Wesley Wesley and the Revival is on the Pentecostal and now into this age listen to what he says and now into this age that we're coming now by the same Holy Spirit just more of it you understand me more of it we got to go beyond the Baptist the Methodist the Pentecostals we got to go beyond that hallelujah it's got to be more and if you hunger and thirst for righteousness God said you will be filled amen amen hallelujah hallelujah when the Methodist got Sanctified that was the work of the Holy Spirit see it was a part of the Holy Spirit they without us are not made perfect says the scripture yall understand what he said the the Methodist can't be made perfect Without You Without You because you received the Capstone you received the the top of the pyramid now I'm coming to this because I'm going to tell you something when you really catch a hold of real Grace you stop judging each other in the wrong way Hallelujah for you for you this morning who's going to lay charge to God's elect it is God who justifies somebody help me here God who justifies you said well I don't know about let me tell you something brother bam said Jacob looked worse than Esau Hallelujah but which was the real seed y'all hear me y'all better hear what I'm saying because whether you realize it or not it's not your behavior it's whether the seed of God is in [Applause] you Hallelujah I'm so tired that's why we're in bondage we're so in bondage because we can't see the grace of God we're selfish with it oh yeah God gives me Grace but I don't know about sister so and so I don't know about brother so and so Hallelujah but the Bible said you make your calling an election sure don't worry about your neighbor you make your calling an election sure let me move on right he says now God as a light has began to shine in the last days listen closely he is expecting us great thing from us because where there is much giving given there is much required so he's going to require much more of us than he did the Lutheran or the methodists because we walk in a greater light with a greater power with a greater witness than they had so let me explain some of your conditions you are like many of us are like Johnny Crow Hallelujah you have been set free and you don't know it you still walking around in circles doing the same things you've always done thinking that God power is not powerful enough to free you but I'm going tell you something God freed me before the foundation of the world hallelujah hallelujah just the other day when brother Danny from Zimbabwe was preaching and you don't have to believe this but a wind came by me and it said to me receive your grace I'm like Lord I thought I received it I thought I had it but you don't know Grace until you have Grace for others Hallelujah you don't know Mercy until you have mercy for others that's scripture you know the man who couldn't have mercy from on the person who owed him was called a wicked servant and was thrown in jail not having Mercy Mercy is when you caught you done you've done wrong and you're caught it's like when the police catch you speeding speed and you say Have Mercy he say I'll let you go this time that's Mercy Hallelujah but Grace is unmerited y'all hear what I'm saying didn't do nothing you did wrong but God uh don't impute it to you we got to push forward y'all understand when I'm where I'm going I'm talking about the foundation if the foundation is solid the house is solid let the winds come let the rains come let them beat upon the house let the flood come you see I'm not saved because of you I'm saved because of him no church saves me so if everybody in this church go bad I'm still saved you understand me it was the blood of Jesus Christ it is a grace of God and I know one thing we've got a lot of life lots a lot of lots lot lot the person lot the lot Hallelujah and what do you mean by that we all want to take the easy [Music] road is that right but Abraham took the rough road come on somebody and because lot took the easy Road he produced Mo Hallelujah and Moab produced Goliath did y'all hear what I'm saying but Abraham wo he produced Jesus Christ Jesus Christ amen let's move on how can we describe Christ there's no words in the English language French German whatever there's no words to describe him I just believe that when we get to heaven we all receive a better language amen something that's going to describe him perfectly turn with me to Revelation 81 you love the Lord I'm people if we can see this thing I can't give you Revelation but I can preach it in the way that you can see it is it true brother brandham said there'll be many there you thought wasn't going to make it amen they're where Heaven A lot of people will be in heaven that you thought wasn't going to make it Hallelujah but there'll be many who you thought was going to be there you know why it wasn't that Grace wasn't given to them they just didn't know how to receive it is that the truth look at all those men who caught that woman in adultery you think they would have clean they they would have cleaved to [Music] Jesus because he gave her grace and I don't know what her what her what their sins were but you think they would have become a follower let me tell y'all something your family is not going to make it if you don't know how to apply Grace husband and wives you're not going to make it if you don't know how to apply Grace if you don't know how to apply Mercy see y'all getting quiet on me now but I'm going tell you that's nothing but the truth hallelujah and remember however you judge each other that same judgment going to come back Revelation 81 and when he had opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven about the space of a half hour Hallelujah is that all right coming from the message Souls that are in prison now paragraph 208 brother bradam said the lamb took his book wi the seven seal just ready for it to be [Music] open The Sixth Seal remember he did the seventh seal from us he he excuse me the seven seal from us we we would have do it we would we yeah we would have done it he would have done it I'm sorry he wouldn't do it sorry these glasses come on when the angel stood day by day telling him y y'all better listen when the Angels stood day by day telling it but then he wouldn't do it on that [Music] one said there is silence in heaven no one knew it was the coming of the Lord somebody help me here you going to believe this or you ain't going to believe it Hallelujah Hall but that cloud was more to that cloud than me the ey and if that be the case he was coming for Rebecca Hallelujah is that right he was coming to make himself known to her oh somebody help me [Music] here hallelujah hallelujah things were so secretive see what we don't understand there was such a silence because what you going to say how can you explain Christ in a few words eternity in a few words how how can you do it you you you can't so you keep silent because God is going to do something with this bride that he didn't do with the other Church agents Hallelujah every other Church age had a lead to their understanding y'all help me somebody when they learned justification that was it when they learned sanctification that was it when they understood the baptism of the Holy Ghost that was it but oh my god when it comes to the person of Jesus Christ I am the beginning I am the ending I am the first I am the last Hallelujah the more you want the more you get it never stops it cannot stop because it's Eternal oh y'all don't understand me see we living on our privileges we are sitting here not knowing that we're free free and as long as you think in your mind that you're bound and you just been here for a church membership that's all you going to get Hallelujah but the Bride of Jesus Christ is like that person who had the apple pie or the Cherry Pie once he tastes piece of it he isn't there more of it hallelujah hallelujah and the bride no matter how much she eat of this word she wants more she wants more she wants more Hallelujah so you understand Faith makes us relax it doesn't put us in anxiety Hallelujah y'all know what I'm saying because a woman who's trying to produce a baby will never conceive if she's not relaxed oh come on somebody you know brother bam even tell told people go get a go go get a a adopt a child or something so you can so she can relax cuz as long as you on anxiety you can't do it I'm naturally but I'm working with the spiritual too you understand me as long as Satan Got You Under This anxiety you can't produce Jesus Hallelujah you got to relax you got to have faith in God's grace and God's mercy Hallelujah that's why he call it Amazing Grace is that right so you and I must learn to enter into his [Music] rest we want Jesus and Satan just putting it on us cuz he know if he can keep you upset and full of anxiety he's going to stunt your growth those of you who want the Holy Ghost you got to have confidence in what Jesus already done for you Hallelujah go down on your knees or wherever you may be say God you got that gift from me I come to get my gift you don't come in a nervous freny oh no no no no by faith that's your foundation by faith he created the world and by your faith in him God you promis me Hallelujah and I'm resting on your promise hallelujah how many of you can change yourself not one of us can change ourselves but the devil say you ain't worthy to be chained the devil is a liar Hallelujah the woman at the well she wasn't worthy what did she do nothing Grace found her what did Abraham do nothing Grace found him hallelujah what did Moses do nothing Grace found him Hallelujah I don't care if you own drugs I don't care if you're a prostitute I don't care what you are if the seed of God is in you Grace is going to find you hallelujah hallelujah yes sir people think and I I don't want I don't want you to stop coming to church but people have this religious thing if I come to churches I it makes me a better Christian no it doesn't that ain't it have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe that's what makes you a Christian until you you just potential truth makes you [Music] relax you think about brother brandham he's laying on his bed he said I'm getting old now and my I haven't done nothing make you want to run into a wall he done he done he's he's one Millions to the Lord and he says I've better get up from here if I'm going to do some work for godes what did he do in order for God to translate him take him to another dimension he did nothing Grace took him there because you know what brother Bram was weary he was tired and he had already prayed basically Lord give me something and when he least expected it God took him translated him now people can say whatever they want to say whatever it was he was laying on his bed and now in Heavenly places what did he do you understand what I'm trying to tell you his whole desire was to do more for God when your desire is to do more for God God will give you more y'all hearing give me a drink of water see that's the key of getting water us springing up into eternal life you give God then God gives [Applause] you I think that was Kennedy said as not who what you can do for your country but that's what your country can do for you but here God is saying here give me is that right he told that woman give me meal give me bread give me right you give God God gives you more than your religion I know what I'm working with see his revelation of Grace was that no matter how much wrong I have done he still loves me wo when you know God ain't like your old friend that when you messed up one time they didn't want to have nothing to do with you Hallelujah but it's been over and over and over and over again his love never fails Hallelujah when I didn't have a friend to pick me up he picked me up Hallelujah glory to God when I needed comforting he was the [Music] comforter hallelujah how many in here knows you've done wrong at times and God still blessed you absolutely why he still loves you is that right when brother Bram wife died and he had all those deaths coming and and and and the devil told him see the Lord don't God don't love you brother Bram said he was almost ready to believe that he said the devil had a good argument but something struck him Hallelujah though he slave me yeah I trust him Hallelujah the Lord give it and the Lord take the away what are you saying brother Brooks when brother bradam in his mental capacity couldn't even think positive Grace stepped in Hallelujah and gave him scripture oh somebody help me here that in turn gave him strength to defeat the Devil Hallelujah yes sir my Foundation is sure I don't have to worry about this house crumbling my Foundation is sure your foundation is sure if you trust God like you ought to Jeremiah please don't get tired Jeremiah 313 Jeremiah 31 3 you love the Lord I'm I'm I'm trying to drill this in you cuz religious Spirits they don't want to let you go y'all hear what I'm saying I'm going say it again religious Spirits they love to hold to you cuz they know that if you continue that way you're not going to make it that's right am I was telling the church Wednesday we're family you better recognize this and if you can't consider me part of your family you won't be there yall understand me my family is beyond this own natural flesh Hallelujah yall heard me say it many times when when Jes mother Mary came to Jesus and the disciples said Lord your mother and your family is here to see you and Jesus said who is my mother my father my brother my sister but those who do the father's will hello somebody he took it up is that right he elevated the family from the natural to the spiritual and I'm I got to hurry up I got to hurry up I'm sorry I've taken too long listen the Lord ped to me saying yay I have I I have loved thee with the Everlasting Love Therefore with loving kindness have I drawn thee Hallelujah y'all understand me you hear the word he he drew you with loving kindness oh come on somebody you say I don't understand that but brother brandham said when God uh drove the Jews back to their Homeland he said it was tender hand of Jehovah I don't care how I got here I got here he had to beat me a little bit but I got here you understand what I'm saying Isaiah 43 5-6 you love the Lord hallelujah hallelujah I want to emphasize this you cannot remain where you are and expect to make a rapture yall understand what I mean by that I believe in election but I also believe in inspiration and I believe that the elected vessels of God are being inspired with the time that we're living in and and and and and the time of desperation and the time of of trimming the lamps however you want to put it but something on the inside keep telling me that there is more to this message than we've seen amen amen amen yes sir and I got to have it people are barely making it as Christians and you call that this is it we can't even compete with Uzu Street and this message is greater than a y'all hear what I'm saying you can you can lay back in your easy chair but there something happening and you better ask God what it is because we're getting ready for a translation let me read this fear not for I am with thee I will bring thy seed from the East and gather thee from the West I will say to the north give up and to the South keep not back bring my sons from far and my daughters from the end of the Earth so let me say something to y'all because sometime we we judge in the wrong way Jacob had to meet Esau and because God had cast Esau away God still dealt with Esau is that right and God softened Esau's heart when it came to Jacob you understand me it wasn't Jacob who had such an evil spirit about Esau it was Esau who wanted to kill Jacob so you understand what I'm saying you going to either be Abraham seed or you're going to be the seed of [Music] Hallelujah you're going to either take the hard way God told brother Brandon because you have chosen a harder way I've given you a huge portion hallelujah what I'm trying to say is this even if there's a lot of lots in here you still need to love and fellowship amen it was Lot who left Abraham not Abraham who left lot Hallelujah I feel like shouting right now but I got a I got a whole my fear not for I am with thee I will bring thy seed from the East and gather thee from the West I will say to the north give up and to the South keep not back bring my sons from afar and my daughters from the ends of the Earth Hallelujah now word is gone out you say well all that a word has gone out this is this is us too not just Israel but it it deals with us as well you said well that deal with the Dead the living too where the carcass is that's where the Eagles will be gathered Hallelujah I want to say this and I I didn't get to my scripture but because of time but remember in the in the beginning God gave adam a covenant is that right and that Covenant was conditional don't eat of the tree nor do you touch it Hallelujah and he told Adam be fruitful and multiply is that the truth then he came to Noah he gave Noah a covenant be fruitful and multiply Hallelujah but something changed when it came to Abraham hallelujah hallelujah God tically begins to say you are going to have seed and thy seed shall possess the Gate of their enemies Hallelujah your seed though they start off as the dust of the earth one day will become the stars of Heaven Hallelujah he did not give Abraham a covenant of conditions he gave Abraham a unconditional Covenant Hallelujah and he said your your seed sh I don't know about you but I am part of the shell hallelujah it's not by power it's not by mind but it's by my spirit say the Lord I'm almost done here can I say it like this go look cuz I can't read it because of the time but if you go in in the Book of Matthew you see it start off with Abraham the lineage of Jesus [Music] Christ I love this gu what who was in there Tamar ruthu right we had some pretty perverted women up in there in the lineage of Jesus Christ Hallelujah you can look at it all you want to but those women represented us hallelujah this is the only generation that comes in the full manifestation of producing Jesus Christ himself you hear what I'm saying thank you Lord we don't stop I love this because even when we get to heaven and we have our Feast for three and A2 years it ain't all over yet Hallelujah the Bible said Jesus himself will come on a white horse with the host of Heaven I don't know about you but I'm in the number will come down to earth and we rain A Thousand Years glory to God we are judg brother B said we'll build houses it's going to be sweet if this little 70 or 69 years of mine seems like a long time I can't imagine what a thousand years is going to feel like my Foundation your foundation and the Bible said that Foundation stands sure the Lord knows them that are his and from Abraham to Bram somebody help me here glory to God just like Abraham had a number William Bram had a number and the number can not even be counted glory to God of he said are all these Broms he said no but these your converts to Jesus [Music] Christ and the Covenant I said the Covenant that God gave Abraham he also gave it to William Bram somebody help me here he said to the prophet of God as I was with Moses so will I be with you is that right and in that message brother Bram said God oh God said to brother BR I'm not looking at your mistakes looking at the commission hey somebody help me so that applies to the bride too God ain't looking at your mistakes he's looking at the [Applause] commission Hallelujah glory to God hallelujah glory to God absolutely glory to God oh my like I said he's laying on the couch Hallelujah and God gave him a glimpse of the future I don't know about you but I receed my glimpse of the future I was there he asked Joe were you there where were you when the sons of God shouted and jumped for Joy somebody help me I was there you were there and because of a prophet I'm certain I was there Hallelujah why because you believe this message and when you believe this message the grace of God is upon you hallelujah oh my God you understand me this Covenant is greater than Adam's Covenant this Covenant is greater than Moses Covenant this Covenant is greater than your's Covenant somebody help me here this is the greatest Covenant you say what I'm saying you hear what I'm saying we heard from God and God said to me you're so Justified as though youve never sin in the first place hallelujah what are you talking about brother I have always been hid in him no condemnation to those who walk not after the flesh but the spirit Hallelujah and when you got the Holy Ghost you going to walk after the spirit you say well brother Brooks I fail but when you get the Holy Ghost you going to get up Hallelujah cuz the Bible says a just man though he falls seven times in a day he gets up you might see me fall but did you see me get up Hallelujah I'm going to get up cuz that's part of my Foundation Hallelujah the race is not given to the Swift nor is it given to the strong but it's given to those who will endure Hallelujah y'all know what I'm saying I'm made like job I'm going to wait till my change come I'm made like job though he slay me yet I trust him hallelujah oh Lord that's why some Christians when things get hard they want to turn back on God you just being tested you're being tested this ain't no time to quit you being tested and it ain't by the devil God God God don't pick a fight just for you have you considered woo Jesus Hallelujah but God know you're going to come through Hallelujah is that right how many of y'all remember the message Snow White Dove brother Bram said that Dove finished he was all beat up he was wounded he was Bloody but he made it [Applause] home I don't care the condition I might be in but I'm going to make it home Hallelujah y'all hear what I'm saying the Bible says and I'm closing what who shall separate me from the love of God hallelujah you can't do it the devil can't do it mama can't do it Daddy can't do it nobody can do it the pope can't do it the priest can't do it the Elder can't do it nobody guess what I can't even do it I can't even do it is that right you said what a minute brother I'm closing Peter said I don't sham God so much I denied him three times I cursed at with it as well I'm no good he felt pretty bad Hallelujah but see God loved Peter and when that time for the outpouring they say go get Peter let me tell y'all something before God pours that y'all y'all believe we going to get a a measure of of anointing before the Rapture and before God does that he going to get everybody cuz brother brand said when that evening tide began to roll in he said all of those backsliders going to come back Hallelujah glory to God see you don't know what God is doing but God said I'll never lose one I don't know about you I'm pretty happy Hallelujah Jesus thank you Lord when we love him we do all to we can do to obey him you don't say oh he love me and I could just do whatever I want no no no it doesn't work that either when you love him you let the water of the word wash you when you love him you let the water of the word feel you when you love him you let the word create in you him somebody help me here you going to go through some battles let me I'm closing on this scripture the Bible says the suffering of this world cannot be compared those of you who think you're having a hard time you're not in Alliance then are you no is getting ready to cut your head off Hallelujah they're not dragging you through the streets by horse horse carriages are they hallelujah what what hard time Paul said this light light tribulation this light that we like a feather on your back you know I knew that word right dipla feather but you know the thing about it is people and I'm closing I'm trying to I'm really trying to encourage you and I'm trying to break this religious thing we got going on it's like walking a child walking you don't don't you don't spank a child because he he falls when he's trying look Beyond people's faults and see the heart of the people hallelujah as they're mature they pick themselves up Hallelujah but you know if we constantly criticize each other you put bitterness in people hearts and you they mistaken that is being Jesus no Jesus is a comforter the said if you see your brothers overtaken and thought go to him in meekness to restore him Hallelujah God didn't say go tell your neighbor run and tell that that's not God and whenever the enemy gives you that inspiration to gossip about your brothers and sister no it's the devil because the Devil comes to steal kill and destroy he comes to separate the house because a house separated can't stand you love the Lord people we got to love each other you won't make it without it I'm not saying you're not saved I'm just saying you won't make a Rapture without Divine love Hallelujah your foundation is love and faith brother said love and faith are twins Hallelujah stand please amen I'm going to sing this song and I trust you sing it with
