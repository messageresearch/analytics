[0:01] you know I don't necessarily need the
[0:04] Thunder and the lightning but I do like
[0:06] the
[0:07] rain and you know de Mo need
[0:11] rain amen and I'm looking at this rain
[0:14] and I'm trusting we get our portion this
[0:17] year we've been in a drought for about
[0:19] three years I think it's been and you
[0:22] know and uh kind of like it was in the
[0:25] time of
[0:27] Elijah but when it began to rain it
[0:30] poured
[0:31] amen amen and Revival was
[0:35] on so we just thank God for his grace
[0:39] let us turn to Matthew the 13th
[0:43] chapter and
[0:46] uh I was a boy I played in the rain I
[0:49] walked in the rain I just uh and I'm
[0:52] trusting by the grace of God that the
[0:54] supernatural
[0:56] rain will rain in this place this
[0:59] morning
[1:02] we have been uh there's no way that I
[1:05] can complete this message on this
[1:07] morning but by the grace of God we'll do
[1:10] as the Lord would have us Matthew the
[1:13] 13th
[1:20] chapter I don't know why I flip through
[1:22] my Bible when I know where it's at I'll
[1:25] just go from one page to the
[1:27] next Matthew 13 we're going to begin the
[1:30] 11th
[1:32] verse I'm so glad everybody is really
[1:35] happy and excited this morning amen
[1:38] because one thing for certain we're
[1:41] living I think about this all the time I
[1:45] I look at uh people and almost they're
[1:47] afraid to say I'm
[1:49] blessed but I'm saying to every man
[1:51] you're blessed as long as you living on
[1:53] this Earth and not in Hell amen hello
[1:58] amen you're living
[2:00] on Earth and not in hell because we
[2:04] realize amen things can be a lot
[2:07] worse than what they are amen but I
[2:11] thank God oh Lord every day I really
[2:15] appreciate the Lord Jesus Christ for his
[2:17] mercy and his grace amen I don't deserve
[2:20] it people of God I just you know
[2:24] sometimes I stand in this pull pit
[2:26] Feeling So
[2:27] Unworthy uh to be I mean anything for
[2:30] God uh more or less a leader and I don't
[2:33] say that uh uh lightly I I really mean
[2:37] that from the depths of my heart I'm
[2:40] just a man uh saved by the grace of God
[2:44] whom God in his mind thought it to be
[2:49] so and I appreciate the Lord
[2:53] Jesus uh for that and uh I just want to
[2:58] uh live so God can use it
[3:01] Matthew 131 through the 13th verse
[3:12] please and the disciples came I'm sorry
[3:15] and he answered and said unto
[3:17] them because it is given unto you to
[3:20] know the mysteries of the kingdom of
[3:23] heaven but to them it is not
[3:27] given for whosoever ha
[3:30] have to him shall be
[3:33] given and he shall have more
[3:36] abundance but whosoever hath not from
[3:40] him shall be taken away even that he
[3:44] ha therefore speak I to them in Parables
[3:50] because seeing they see not and hearing
[3:53] they hear not neither do they
[3:58] understand will would like to entitle
[4:01] our message the power of
[4:05] light or let there be light however you
[4:08] want to uh see it this
[4:11] morning but let us
[4:13] pray Heavenly Father God we come before
[4:16] you right now as humbly as we know how
[4:18] and we thank you for being so good to us
[4:22] we thank you for being better to us than
[4:24] we have been to ourselves and father we
[4:27] realize this morning that that you are
[4:31] the ultimate of all things and before
[4:35] there were anything made that was
[4:37] made Lord you were here and Lord we
[4:41] thank you right now for this
[4:44] understanding that you have given unto
[4:45] us we appreciate you father there are no
[4:48] words that can express our gratitude and
[4:52] Lord we just thank you here this morning
[4:54] bless each and every heart Enlighten our
[4:57] hearts and our souls and father father
[5:00] we will be grateful to you Lord and
[5:01] we'll praise you oh God because you're
[5:04] worthy of all praise in Jesus Christ's
[5:06] name we pray amen you may be
[5:10] seated we want to read this scripture
[5:13] because the scripture whether you
[5:15] realize it or not is actually dealing
[5:19] with
[5:20] light light is
[5:23] something even though we see it we say I
[5:27] saw the light you are actually a seeing
[5:30] the effect of light because no man can
[5:33] truly see light you see the effects of
[5:38] light and that's why even God said no
[5:41] man have seen me at any
[5:43] time you see except the son he knows me
[5:47] because he knows who he is God even as
[5:50] brother brandham said has always veiled
[5:52] himself and there's a reason why I mean
[5:55] we see what we call the pill of Fire or
[5:58] the pillar of light but we must
[6:00] understand that that is the clothing of
[6:02] God it is in the inside of that light
[6:07] which is is God so we're looking at the
[6:11] scripture here and we find out that um
[6:15] Jesus disciples had asked them why he
[6:19] speaking
[6:21] Parables and uh he said because it's not
[6:25] given to
[6:26] everybody to see or understand
[6:30] now you can look at something with your
[6:32] natural
[6:33] eye and yet not comprehend what it is or
[6:37] even understand it so he's not talking
[6:40] about seeing with your natural eyes he's
[6:43] working with the
[6:44] spiritual and we find out by the grace
[6:47] of God one thing that really struck and
[6:50] stunned me when God opened the scripture
[6:52] to me that he said those who have will
[6:57] be given more abundantly now he's
[7:00] working with
[7:02] seed he's working with seed and those
[7:05] who have seed those who have that in
[7:08] them they will have and they will have
[7:11] more abundant amen now he comes along
[7:14] and he said but those that have not you
[7:16] see because really when you realize and
[7:19] recognize the seed a serpent uh H uh
[7:23] they have gifts and and they're able to
[7:26] do things by faith and and God is saying
[7:30] uh listen but they have
[7:33] not and even those who have not I'm
[7:36] going to take away from
[7:38] them what they've
[7:40] got because what they have is not really
[7:44] theirs and he goes on to say because I
[7:49] have ordained them in a way that they
[7:55] see but see not hearing
[8:00] hear not in other words I've ordained
[8:03] them to be in the position that they're
[8:07] in they cannot
[8:10] comprehend
[8:13] me but it is given to you than you Lord
[8:17] to understand to
[8:20] comprehend who I
[8:24] am now we realize our
[8:27] god let's turn to let's just turn to
[8:30] Jude and I don't want to go too far with
[8:32] this but I want to kind of touch cuz
[8:33] we're going to be dealing with there's a
[8:35] natural light there's a cosmic light and
[8:37] there's Eternal
[8:39] Light hello and uh now Jude when I when
[8:44] I was reading this I thought Lord but
[8:47] but but uh you know the fire that
[8:50] destroy uh those the Lake of Fire is is
[8:53] not it's not Eternal it's Everlasting as
[8:56] brother brandom said and and and here in
[8:59] Jude the 7th verse it says even as Sodom
[9:02] and Gomorrah and the cities about them
[9:04] in like manner giving themselves over to
[9:07] fornication and going after the strange
[9:09] flesh or set forth for an example
[9:13] suffering the Vengeance of Eternal fire
[9:16] now you know I was thinking many times
[9:19] when I read the scripture suffering the
[9:21] Vengeance of Eternal fire as if it was
[9:24] something separate from God but you see
[9:27] God is the Eternal fire
[9:29] amen basically he could have said
[9:32] suffering the Vengeance of God or
[9:34] suffering the Vengeance of the Lord
[9:36] Jesus
[9:37] Christ right and and when I began to see
[9:41] that I thought well Lord is that right
[9:44] yes because the Bible according to
[9:46] Hebrews 12:29 said God my God or God is
[9:51] a consuming
[9:53] fire they don't burn amen
[9:57] eternally but they they do they are
[10:00] destroyed Amen in an ET Everlasting fire
[10:05] or time period rather so when God began
[10:08] to uh give me understanding and and
[10:10] listen to this now I want you to
[10:12] understand that God is identified with
[10:16] fire and light
[10:18] amen right because wherever there is a
[10:21] fire there's
[10:23] light and wherever there's light there's
[10:25] a
[10:27] fire so we realize by the grace of God
[10:31] Amen that light and fire goes together
[10:34] now we sing that song I Saw The Light No
[10:38] More darkness no more night that's a
[10:40] beautiful
[10:41] song but you see there are so many
[10:44] people amen who sing that song who have
[10:46] never seen the
[10:50] light spiritual light is something that
[10:53] opens the mind to seeing spiritual
[10:57] things that are not visible to the
[10:59] Natural Eye we might call it faith faith
[11:03] is something that as the scripture calls
[11:06] it Abraham called those things that be
[11:08] not as though they were spiritual amen
[11:12] sight God promised me I believe the
[11:15] promise so it is a reality to me even
[11:19] though you don't see it with your
[11:20] natural eye you know it's yours Heaven
[11:23] belongs to me amen hello amen amen I've
[11:28] never seen it as with my natural eye but
[11:31] Heaven is re reality to me because I see
[11:35] it spiritually in other in other words I
[11:39] understand
[11:40] it now we realize by the grace of
[11:44] God even in the Bible according to St
[11:47] John 1 it
[11:48] says basically it talks about4 about
[11:51] Jesus Christ Not only was he the life
[11:56] but he was the light of men amen and in
[11:59] that word word work when light is
[12:02] working understanding as youve heard me
[12:04] say he is the understanding of what a
[12:07] man is supposed to be a God man Jesus
[12:11] was 100%
[12:14] plus right he was God man as brother bam
[12:18] said he left a a being he was all space
[12:22] and time and whatever you want to say
[12:24] however you want but you got to realize
[12:27] nothing only exists
[12:30] in time and
[12:32] space people say well God made something
[12:34] out of nothing only because you couldn't
[12:36] see it but something always existed and
[12:40] that was God Amen yes sir see so nothing
[12:45] is something that we're working with
[12:47] only in
[12:48] this feel taste smell see sound whatever
[12:53] you know I mean the natural
[12:56] senses so when we realize a man
[13:00] that we are living in a spiritual world
[13:04] Amen now there those that are born
[13:07] again must be spiritual now God and I'm
[13:11] almost jumping in a way but let me I
[13:13] I'll say it again that's why in the
[13:16] beginning when there was Darkness and
[13:17] Light amen uh basically mingling
[13:20] together God separated
[13:23] it the Bible said he
[13:25] divided light from the darkness and I'm
[13:28] going to give back to that in just a
[13:30] moment usually we don't see light we see
[13:34] we see with
[13:36] it right if there was the absence of
[13:39] light here you couldn't see even though
[13:43] you got
[13:45] eyes it is the light that causes you to
[13:50] see right y y'all hear what I'm
[13:53] saying and I want you to understand that
[13:55] we are creatures of light oh I love this
[13:59] and I'm almost ready to shout
[14:02] already because we came from I'm working
[14:05] with this eternal
[14:07] light we were light in the beginning oh
[14:12] God creatures of light and if he is
[14:16] light and give birth he must give birth
[14:20] to what light
[14:24] amen one of the first thing he said let
[14:27] there be lighten because he was showing
[14:30] by the grace of God is that light was
[14:32] always amen not this natural stuff a
[14:36] light that is
[14:42] Supernatural even in science I said it
[14:45] said light is used for everything from
[14:47] laser to eye surgery now that's the
[14:50] manipulation of light to telephone
[14:53] technology the
[14:55] potential military application of light
[14:58] are straight out of the science fiction
[15:00] and y'all know that's the
[15:02] truth even science recognize the power
[15:05] of light come on somebody I know some of
[15:08] y'all have seen uh Star
[15:11] Trek and when they say Be Me Up Scotty
[15:14] what comes down light and that light
[15:17] amen transformed that individual what
[15:21] what happens that individual becomes
[15:23] part of that light and he travels with
[15:26] that light and then they able to operate
[15:29] that life so much so to that that
[15:32] individual can come back to the natural
[15:34] form oh sound like a Rapture to
[15:38] me now we look at this thing and we must
[15:42] understand this is why it's so important
[15:44] that you and I separate ourselves from
[15:48] all Darkness amen if you are children of
[15:51] light you are the Conqueror amen of all
[15:56] Darkness amen y'all hear me
[16:00] now and within a decade light listen I
[16:03] love this when I when I read this it
[16:06] said within a decade light may be the
[16:08] preferred weapon for zapping hostile
[16:12] missiles out of the
[16:16] sky come on somebody light has always
[16:20] been the
[16:23] weapon they science just catching up
[16:26] with
[16:27] it but it was light amen that destroyed
[16:31] Lucifer come on I want you to understand
[16:34] let me back it up here because I want
[16:36] you to realize Amen in the beginning
[16:38] there was only one
[16:41] thought and that
[16:43] thought consisted of many
[16:47] thoughts and many thoughts the many
[16:49] thoughts from that thought was only
[16:53] thought by God
[16:55] am Lucifer was the first of all God's
[17:00] creation that thought differently from
[17:06] God y'all hear what I'm saying that's
[17:10] why when it comes to this message we
[17:11] don't have a thought
[17:13] coming our thoughts must lined up with
[17:16] his thought oh come on
[17:18] somebody otherwise we find ourselves
[17:22] thinking outside of God's thoughts which
[17:25] got Lucifer in
[17:27] trouble
[17:32] this is what science
[17:34] says light can even
[17:36] become the preeminent power source for
[17:40] long distance space
[17:45] travel I'm excited cuz light
[17:49] is the
[17:52] power for space
[17:55] travel the spaceship will have an ultra
[17:59] thin sail to catch the wind of light
[18:04] being from an etern earth based laser in
[18:09] theory such a craft could accelerate
[18:12] into a sizable fraction of the speed of
[18:15] light without carrying
[18:18] fuel oh my
[18:21] God come on somebody you said what do
[18:24] you mean what does that have to do with
[18:26] me this is what's happening God was so
[18:29] change us amen hallu that we'll change
[18:33] we'll travel faster than
[18:35] light why because we are light
[18:40] amen light is the only thing that can
[18:42] travel through that wall without
[18:45] interfering with the
[18:47] wall That's why Jesus was able to walk
[18:50] through the oh wall
[18:54] my
[18:56] amen oh my look at the more you look at
[18:59] the topic the more you realize that our
[19:02] lives are built around light without
[19:06] light we could not even
[19:09] exist take away the Sun and we're
[19:12] dead hello not just us all botney life
[19:17] must animal life everything that you say
[19:20] lives must have
[19:24] light without the light amen there is no
[19:27] photosynthesis
[19:29] now come on somebody light and I I've
[19:32] I've discovered this myself by just
[19:35] reading and I find out amen that our
[19:38] whole system this whole world system
[19:41] actually have a a a a system that
[19:44] protects this world in other words it
[19:46] when something from space or wherever
[19:48] comes in that's not supposed to come
[19:51] amen storm clouds come a battle come a
[19:55] fight come Amen to destroy amen every
[19:58] and everything that would literally
[20:01] pervert this
[20:02] world
[20:04] Amen and try to balance it back
[20:07] out just like your
[20:10] body what happens amen when some germ
[20:14] comes into your body that's not supposed
[20:15] to go what happened your body turns up
[20:18] the
[20:19] temperature the fire burns hotter and
[20:22] the purpose for that is to kill off the
[20:24] germ come on somebody I mean god is
[20:27] perfect in all things
[20:29] and if you get an eternal fire this
[20:32] eternal fire is able to kill death
[20:35] itself hallelujah amen I'm trying to
[20:38] slow it
[20:40] down because I want you to realize amen
[20:43] that this thing goes into a
[20:47] place as I said scripturally we
[20:53] are I could have said we are just we're
[20:57] light
[21:01] and actually you know
[21:04] uh this light is to illuminate let's
[21:07] work with the spiritual now this light
[21:09] is to illuminate our minds it is to
[21:13] Enlighten our minds it is it is our
[21:15] guidance it is our
[21:18] inspiration they that are led by the
[21:21] spirit of
[21:22] God truly they are the sons of
[21:26] God now we realize
[21:29] amen that when God said in in the in
[21:32] Genesis he said let there be
[21:35] light first of all let me let me let me
[21:38] put it this way the Bible tells us that
[21:41] Jesus Christ is the beginning of God's
[21:45] creation Now I want you to understand
[21:47] what he did Brother B talks about it how
[21:49] he was just Elohim self-existing one and
[21:53] then he basically came down and became
[21:56] the L ghost and and from the L ghost
[21:58] amen he he moved himself into what we
[22:01] call Cosmic light and you understand
[22:03] what Cosmic light is it's your body with
[22:06] petroleum and all the other
[22:08] elements yeah I can read a quote in just
[22:10] a moment but the point is you are
[22:14] light but you are a different kind of
[22:18] light until the Holy Ghost
[22:21] comes now we see in Genesis he said let
[22:24] there be light right and the Bible said
[22:27] there was light and the light was good
[22:31] right and so he separated let's go there
[22:33] first Genesis 1 now like I said I'm just
[22:36] trying to lay a foundation here this
[22:38] morning and by the grace of God we'll
[22:40] try to finish it out whenever the Lord
[22:42] will will end it but my point is and
[22:44] you'll see down the road is that it is
[22:48] important that light and darkness be
[22:56] separated if God sep separated it in the
[22:59] beginning it must be separated in the
[23:04] end right Genesis
[23:08] 1:3 that's why the Bible said you cannot
[23:11] be lovers of the world and lovers of God
[23:14] too God said let there be light and
[23:16] there was light and God saw the light
[23:19] that it was good and God divided the
[23:23] light from the darkness is that all
[23:26] right and then he named the light he
[23:28] named The Darkness the Bible said and
[23:31] then he called the light day and he
[23:34] called The Darkness night
[23:38] amen hallelujah and I think it's in
[23:40] Peter with says now you're not Children
[23:42] of the Night amen you're Children of the
[23:46] day you're Children of the light in
[23:48] other words you are created by light you
[23:51] are The Offspring of light amen you are
[23:55] light so much so
[23:59] just as our
[24:02] father he is
[24:05] light in one place he call he's called
[24:08] the unapproachable
[24:09] light is that all right and we realize
[24:13] by the grace of God Amen when we see
[24:16] God Amen in his
[24:19] Beauty it should
[24:22] always excit
[24:26] us because this message is to give us
[24:29] ident
[24:30] identification remember now we're
[24:32] talking about the Rapture is that all
[24:34] right and brother brandham says it like
[24:36] this he said he talks about the UFOs he
[24:39] said one day the the those lights that
[24:41] you see they'll pick you
[24:44] up ah come on somebody one of these old
[24:49] days the same lights that been appearing
[24:51] all over the world the same light that's
[24:55] above the prophet's head he said that
[24:57] light he said that light one of these
[24:59] old days will pick you up now I don't
[25:02] know about you but I'm ready for
[25:08] it now we look at this thing and we say
[25:10] well brother Brooks where are you
[25:12] working with I'm I'm I'm working with
[25:13] the supernatural I'm trying to get to
[25:15] the supernatural light here but I I I
[25:17] want to say by the grace of God Amen
[25:20] that we are looking at a time amen where
[25:23] there's lot there's only a few people
[25:25] that actually have
[25:27] sight even this message people don't
[25:30] know who they're supposed to be oh come
[25:33] on somebody amen they don't have even
[25:36] though the messages come to bring them
[25:38] an
[25:39] identification they can't seem to
[25:42] separate themselves from the
[25:44] darkness hello and I want you to
[25:47] understand Darkness just doesn't back
[25:50] off Darkness must be
[25:55] conquered y'all hear what I'm saying
[25:57] Darkness must be
[26:00] conquered why because in tight it is the
[26:04] battle that started in heaven where
[26:07] Lucifer amen by his perversion brought
[26:10] in darkness there was no darkness in
[26:13] heaven everything was
[26:17] light oh y'all act like y'all don't want
[26:19] to believe that the Holy Ghost in you
[26:21] ought to wait say Amen to that why
[26:23] because the Bible said in him Christ
[26:26] Jesus God there is no Darkness at all
[26:31] amen so Darkness even came by the
[26:33] rebellion of Lucifer amen and God in his
[26:37] creation working with Redemption allowed
[26:41] Darkness to come oh my God as a contrast
[26:45] so that you can see there's a difference
[26:47] between the light thoughts and the
[26:50] Darkness thoughts
[26:56] amen so
[27:00] oh we're looking at
[27:04] uh the word of God in a way
[27:07] that the world can't see they couldn't
[27:11] see
[27:12] him right they couldn't see him even
[27:16] though they saw
[27:17] him some said this is bebel say hey some
[27:21] say no no no no this guy he he's born of
[27:23] fornication you know they all had their
[27:26] their their their revelation of who he
[27:30] was and then you took a prostitute by by
[27:34] the uh uh well there in Samaria who said
[27:38] we know that when the Messiah should
[27:42] come he should tell us all these things
[27:45] now anybody in their right mind let me
[27:48] tell you something you you know this is
[27:49] what gets me and I'm going to take it
[27:51] like this people I'm going take as long
[27:52] as God lead me this way this is the way
[27:54] I'm going because I I want you to get
[27:55] what I'm
[27:57] saying you take you take people and and
[28:00] and they these theologians who saw Jesus
[28:03] in so many ways and then here was a
[28:06] prostitute why cuz she had her seed yes
[28:08] sir amen she had What it Took and what
[28:12] God was looking for and then she was
[28:13] given
[28:14] abundance we know when the Messiah
[28:17] should come he should tell us all these
[28:18] things now this is what I want to say
[28:20] people arguing about the crowd and the
[28:22] hunting and the crazy stuff in this
[28:26] message they don't see they can't see
[28:30] they never met him there's no way you
[28:34] going to meet God and be concerned about
[28:37] such silly things amen so Jesus ate the
[28:42] corn
[28:44] am
[28:46] amen is that all right he went shopping
[28:49] amen if I could say it like this on a
[28:52] Sabbath day eating corn out of a field
[28:55] which was unlawful why to man kind but
[28:58] to God that was his corn
[29:02] amen God can eat his corn when he want
[29:04] to and there was a law that you could
[29:06] actually go eat corn as long as you
[29:09] don't pack your
[29:11] bags so he wasn't off the
[29:14] word but you see when you when you if
[29:16] you take a Critic and and and if they
[29:18] want to find something they're going to
[29:20] find
[29:24] something hello

[29:29] of God because we're working with a
[29:30] supernatural light right let me let me
[29:34] let me let me move on uh let's turn to
[29:36] St I mean first John
[29:39] please I hope you're being blessed this
[29:41] morning because people if you don't see
[29:45] you know we we think oh I know I'm light
[29:47] but
[29:50] huh is a different
[29:54] thing like brother bham say he said I'm
[29:56] not talking about I'm not talking about
[29:57] this this little this little blessing
[29:59] y'all talking about being in the
[30:00] presence of God I'm talking about in the
[30:01] presence of
[30:03] God he said all these things we're
[30:05] feeling he said that's just His
[30:07] blessings right he said but when you in
[30:09] the presence of God there ain't no
[30:11] jumping there ain't no shouting you know
[30:12] you feel like a dead man
[30:16] fear of the Holy One is is is is so
[30:19] overwhelming he always had to say fear
[30:24] not how many of us been
[30:26] there y'all hear what I'm
[30:28] saying okay 1 John 1 please is that all
[30:33] right 1 John 1
[30:38] 5-7 he said this then is the message
[30:41] which we have heard of him and declared
[30:44] unto you that God is
[30:46] light and in him is no Darkness at
[30:50] all here it is if we say that we have
[30:54] fellowship with him and walk in darkness
[30:57] we lie and do not the
[31:00] truth but if we walk in
[31:03] light as he is in the
[31:07] light in other words if you're walking
[31:10] in the revelation of your day we have
[31:14] Fellowship one with another oh he didn't
[31:17] say fellowship with him he said one with
[31:20] another because when you fellowshipping
[31:22] one with another in the light you are
[31:25] fellowshipping with him amen why we the
[31:28] body of
[31:30] Christ and the blood of Jesus Christ his
[31:33] son cleanses
[31:36] us from all our
[31:40] sin y'all hear what I'm saying and let
[31:43] me tell you something your Cosmic body
[31:45] is death your Cosmic body amen is is is
[31:51] sin oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
[31:56] yeah you say that's beauti body
[31:59] yes I'm telling
[32:02] you seeing is
[32:04] beautiful so we realize amen the Bible
[32:07] said cleanses you from all sin what is
[32:10] he what what is he cleansing you from
[32:12] not in your not in your flesh your flesh
[32:14] is already condemned it is Darkness you
[32:18] can't see God by your flesh it is a holy
[32:22] spirit that reflects itself through your
[32:26] flesh that men
[32:29] yes the light of God is that right this
[32:34] is the message God is
[32:36] light oh I'm telling you you're not
[32:39] getting it I know it I can tell it I can
[32:41] tell it it ain't something deep it's
[32:42] just simple God is light if God is light
[32:46] that means I stay away from all
[32:50] Darkness just a simple as that if he's
[32:53] light and I'm light then I have no
[32:55] fellowship with Darkness amen
[33:03] understand by the grace of God it is
[33:05] the supernatural light that created the
[33:10] natural
[33:12] light right oh it's true the beginning
[33:16] of of the temporal this this natural
[33:18] light was just the beginning of the
[33:20] temporal and material world and put it
[33:24] this way because remember in Revelation
[33:27] the Bible tell tell us that we won't
[33:28] have need of the Natural Light
[33:33] sun it's temporal we won't have need of
[33:37] it he said because the lamb is the light
[33:40] and he will lighten the
[33:44] city Hallelujah come on somebody it's
[33:48] just a lamb you thinking just Jesus only
[33:50] but you better realize it'll be the
[33:52] bride Hallelujah with him because she
[33:55] sets in his throne and the Bible says
[33:58] she comes down with the glory of
[34:04] God the light of God is radiating
[34:07] through her oh my my my my my we have a
[34:13] white rment that are
[34:15] glisten come on
[34:17] somebody amen like brother brand said
[34:19] God light don't shine it
[34:22] glows my ask Moses about
[34:25] it he met the pill fire on top of the
[34:28] mountain come on somebody and when he
[34:30] come down amen they said they couldn't
[34:32] even look at his face amen cuz the glory
[34:35] of God was shining H I Can't Hardly Wait
[34:38] Hallelujah to God takes over this thing
[34:41] amen and I become him and he becomes me
[34:44] amen I'm in him and he's in me
[34:46] Hallelujah that's where we're headed
[34:49] created being created Created into him
[34:53] growing up into him the light of God woo
[34:58] woo now we
[35:01] realize because God is and as I said
[35:04] earlier nothing only existed in the
[35:06] natural it is the only uh uh only that
[35:09] in this which we can uh see tast and
[35:12] that that's what nothing is I used to
[35:15] get confused with that God created the
[35:18] world out of nothing I was how can he
[35:20] create something out of nothing when he
[35:21] was always
[35:23] here but I was getting two things mixed
[35:26] up two Rams
[35:28] mixed up Hallelujah is that right now I
[35:31] I know I listen what he says in Hebrews
[35:33] 11 1-3 I got it here it says now Faith
[35:36] is the substance of things hold for the
[35:38] evidence things are not seen for by it
[35:41] the elders obtain a good report through
[35:44] faith we understand that the worlds not
[35:48] world the worlds were framed by the word
[35:52] of God so that things which do which are
[35:55] seen were not made of things which do
[35:58] appear in other words I mean we're
[36:00] talking about different Realms is that
[36:03] right in other words we we see the the
[36:05] natural thing but there's a spiritual
[36:07] thing that created it yes sir and and
[36:09] the thing that created it don't look
[36:11] like the thing that that it appeared in
[36:14] other words word created it amen word
[36:18] Spirit word created it and it
[36:24] materialized see so so that's the thing
[36:28] that's the only thing that M does that
[36:29] makes Satan in a place or put Satan in a
[36:32] place where he can't be God because he
[36:35] has he doesn't have the ability to
[36:38] create see but God put you in a place
[36:42] where you could create hallelujah amen
[36:46] hallelujah Now 1 + 1 equals two if you
[36:50] can create and Satan
[36:53] can't then who is God which of you am
[36:58] between the two has more Authority and
[37:01] power oh
[37:03] Lord see he might be able to pervert but
[37:06] you can speak a
[37:08] word and because he is darkened he has
[37:11] to
[37:12] flee the Bible said if you resist the
[37:14] devil he will flee from
[37:20] you oh glory to God I I tell you what
[37:24] teaching is hard for me cuz I like to
[37:26] jump
[37:28] but I'm trying to keep my posure here
[37:33] composure you love the
[37:35] Lord now let me get something out
[37:40] here in in the message by faith brother
[37:44] R said the world was not made the world
[37:47] was made by faith things were shaped in
[37:51] existence
[37:54] by faith God just seen
[37:58] the DW drop hanging out there in the air
[38:02] that whatever you want to call it and he
[38:05] just spake and said let there be light
[38:08] and there was light and when he brought
[38:10] the land forth and dried it off and so
[38:13] forth that was all done by an Act of
[38:17] Faith with God the whole world is made
[38:21] by faith amen hello and faith is the
[38:26] ability to see into the spiritual realm
[38:31] oh my and call those things that be not
[38:34] or can't be seen in this world as though
[38:38] they were because they are amen
[38:41] amen they really are but they can't be
[38:44] seen here yet
[38:48] amen
[38:50] am brother brandom says Amen in the
[38:53] message witness and when you get Faith
[38:56] in Jesus Christ
[38:58] working in a perpetual
[39:01] motion in your soul woo now that word
[39:05] Perpetual shook it shakes a perpetual
[39:09] motion in your soul something's going to
[39:12] take
[39:13] place sin and sickness will get away
[39:17] from you Devils will scatter like
[39:21] Roaches on the floor in the summertime

[39:27] never seen that but I have amen amen but
[39:31] roaches done got more Bolder nowadays
[39:33] but anyhow let's move on when we are we
[39:36] see by the grace of God Amen how this
[39:41] light is so
[39:43] powerful how many times you thought well
[39:46] I I can see my way I can go in through
[39:47] this room and even though it's dark and
[39:49] you're bumping up into everything and
[39:51] you think uh why didn't I turn the light
[39:53] on right is how we do it amen because we
[39:57] think that we can make it through this
[39:59] world without having the light turn on
[40:03] as long as your light is not turned on
[40:05] you're going to bump up into the things
[40:07] and some things will cause you to trip
[40:09] and
[40:10] fallen and the light I'm talking about
[40:12] keeping on is Jesus Christ
[40:14] himself is that all right now in the
[40:18] message of angel of of God he says
[40:22] listen I heard something and brother
[40:23] bandam talks about it and I'm thinking
[40:25] now oh my God this the scientists are
[40:28] catching up because they talk about
[40:30] traveling in the light said one day
[40:33] light we'll be able to travel by light
[40:35] but I want you to understand that's how
[40:36] Angels
[40:39] travel huh let me give you an example
[40:42] brother B said I heard something first I
[40:44] saw a light and I thought it was an
[40:47] automobile that turned the corner but it
[40:50] turned but it got brighter and I looked
[40:53] out the door and while and there was no
[40:57] automobile then I heard something coming
[41:00] like this walking and I looked and the
[41:04] light got greater and I just about me uh
[41:09] H H and just above me hung a great star
[41:14] and the light was kind of a more of a
[41:18] green and yellowish shining on the floor
[41:22] and come walking through the light came
[41:24] a man
[41:26] woo that looked like as I said before
[41:30] would have had been 200 lb a huge man he
[41:34] did not have a beard over his faith like
[41:38] Christ picture does who uh who he is I
[41:43] do not know but he had shoulders he was
[41:46] more of an olive complexion he had had
[41:50] dark eyes he walked as close to me as
[41:53] this microphone
[41:55] is H now he's showing by the grace of
[41:59] God Amen this Angel traveled by light he
[42:02] saw the
[42:04] light Hallelujah and if you and I going
[42:07] to travel you're going to travel by
[42:09] light oh I believe that amen that's why
[42:12] he said look up because your Redemption
[42:15] draw nigh Hallelujah who traveled by
[42:18] light to find the
[42:19] Messiah Hallelujah there was a star
[42:22] Hallelujah and there were three wise men
[42:25] who traveled by that light
[42:28] wherever the light would go that's the
[42:29] way in the direction they would
[42:34] follow now I'm coming to something here
[42:36] in just a moment I'm trying to hold it
[42:38] back you know what I'm saying I'm
[42:40] really I'm so enjoying this I don't know
[42:43] whether yall are but I
[42:45] am now when we look at this thing you
[42:48] and I must know by the grace of God God
[42:51] had to bring the law of contrast in
[42:53] order for us to
[42:56] see
[42:57] we showed by the grace of God that the
[43:00] word of God said in Psalms
[43:03] 33:6 by Thy Word by the word of the Lord
[43:08] were the heavens made and all the host
[43:11] of them by the breath of his nostril is
[43:15] that all right now I want you to
[43:17] understand by the grace of God that
[43:19] everything was made if he was the first
[43:21] born of All
[43:25] Creatures there was no
[43:27] seraphim there was no
[43:30] cherubim there was not even a
[43:32] host there was nothing of All Creatures
[43:35] he was the
[43:37] first come on come on think about it if
[43:40] the Bible the Bible said he was the
[43:42] first of our first born of All
[43:45] Creatures there was nothing before him
[43:47] God himself
[43:51] condescended
[43:53] Amen to bring a
[43:55] creation but you see that's why you he
[43:58] can't be second he can't be third he
[44:01] can't be fourth he has to be number one
[44:05] God must be first in your life because
[44:09] he he was first creation he was the
[44:11] creator he was first must be number one
[44:14] amen am I making sense that's why he
[44:17] said you must love the Lord God better
[44:19] than you love yourself with all of your
[44:21] heart with all of your mind with all of
[44:23] your soul amen oh my my my my turn with
[44:27] me now to Romans 9 I know I'm moving
[44:30] slow this morning but I have
[44:32] to Romans
[44:35] 9:20 now you and I ought to be so
[44:38] grateful because we understand this
[44:40] messag we're understanding it it just
[44:44] seem to unfold and unfold and unfold and
[44:46] unfold amen but think about it amen that
[44:50] that one of these old days that same
[44:52] light in you that you can't see we call
[44:54] it quickening power we call it Jesus
[44:58] Christ understand the Bible says it is
[45:01] light how how many of y'all know that
[45:02] light is in you how many of you know you
[45:04] got fire on the inside hallelujah oh
[45:07] yeah when the Holy Ghost come it shall
[45:09] baptize you with
[45:12] fire Holy Ghost and Fire on the day of
[45:15] Pentecost the Bible said those lick of
[45:17] fire appeared above their heads but that
[45:20] same lick that was above their head was
[45:22] in their soul
[45:25] amen is that right right the candles Li
[45:28] sticks could go out they could the fire
[45:31] outside on the outside where their
[45:32] sacrifice could go out but that light on
[45:35] the inside that fire that was in the
[45:38] kind of Glory Not only was it consuming
[45:41] but it was giving
[45:43] life it transformed a rod changed it
[45:49] amen to a bing limb that brought forth
[45:53] Almond's
[45:55] fruit that's same life right now on the
[45:58] inside of you is changing you from that
[46:01] Old Wicked nature that you used to have
[46:03] thank you Lord right so that you can
[46:05] bring forth Hallelujah the very fruits
[46:08] of
[46:11] God Romans
[46:13] n beginning at the 20th verse is but n
[46:16] oh man who art thou that thy rep is
[46:19] against God shall the things formed say
[46:22] to him that formed it why hast Thou made
[46:24] me thus how many times we've done that
[46:27] oh not what I verly you know you anybody
[46:30] with common sense ain't going to shout
[46:31] or speak evil of some people well I'm
[46:34] angry with God stay away from me see I
[46:37] don't even understand that concept being
[46:39] angry with God that's almost like a
[46:41] little roach or Little Ant screaming up
[46:43] to me says you know I'm angry with
[46:47] you
[46:48] huhuh huh but my point is
[46:51] this God covered his
[46:54] grounds so what if you were so messed up
[46:57] in life wh what if you had every you've
[47:00] done everything in the world everything
[47:02] that God told you not to do and yet he
[47:05] gives you
[47:09] Grace what would you be would you rather
[47:11] be a Pharisee who really thinks he's got
[47:14] it all together who's lived by the law
[47:17] like Paul said I'm
[47:18] blameless there's no reason why I
[47:20] shouldn't go to heaven cuz I've done
[47:22] everything he said
[47:24] do give me Grace amen
[47:28] give me the grace of
[47:31] God as a faulty man I'll take his
[47:38] grace the Bible said there is none
[47:40] righteous no not
[47:43] one so no matter how well we we we fix
[47:47] ourselves to
[47:48] be there is no way by the grace of God
[47:54] that you are you could ever marit heaven
[47:58] if it wasn't for the seed of God in you
[48:01] what you have would be taken from
[48:05] you that's it that's it amen so let's
[48:09] move on by the grace of God he says
[48:10] listen who's going to
[48:12] reply against God shall the thing formed
[48:15] say to him that formed it why has Thou
[48:17] made me thus have not the PO of power
[48:20] over the clay of the same L to make one
[48:23] vessel unto honor and another unto
[48:25] dishonor I'm so glad God didn't make me
[48:29] Pharaoh I'm so glad that he didn't put
[48:32] me in the lineage of the popes
[48:34] yes come on I'm so thankful amen that he
[48:38] didn't allow me to be
[48:40] Judas oh y'all come on somebody or a
[48:46] can what about us sister
[48:49] Jezebel we all bore the nature of the of
[48:54] this world but God changed us
[48:56] transformed us translated us into the
[49:00] kingdom of God Amen and that's what he
[49:03] says listen the Kingdom of Heaven and
[49:05] the kingdom of God the kingdom of God
[49:06] includes everything the Kingdom of
[49:07] Heaven includes
[49:16] Heaven blessed is the nation whose God
[49:19] is the Lord and the people that whom he
[49:21] have chosen for his own
[49:24] inheritance woo can I shed some light on
[49:28] this that's the scripture I'm reading
[49:31] you the scripture and God is saying
[49:33] you're blessed because you are my
[49:37] inheritance that's the light of the word
[49:39] it understanding amen that I am an
[49:41] inheritor of God Amen inheritance of
[49:46] God oh I'm going to get to some oh Lord
[49:50] Psalm 271 and what I'm talking about a
[49:52] supernatural light I'm talking about the
[49:53] Holy Spirit I'm talking about God and
[49:55] you know we look at the Holy Ghost is
[49:56] something or something and we fail to
[49:58] see how powerful the Holy Ghost is right
[50:01] we see we fail to see amen what does
[50:04] Holy Ghost is and that it's not just
[50:07] something that's just
[50:10] ordinary it's
[50:12] extraordinary because it is God
[50:16] hallelujah you got to realize amen that
[50:18] what we talk
[50:20] about when we talk about God we we're
[50:23] talking about the Creator and that's
[50:25] what our little Minds allow us to forget
[50:27] sometime the creator of all things you
[50:30] know I G given this illustration long
[50:32] time ago how often time we say we got so
[50:35] many problems and we fail to see that
[50:37] God can solve
[50:39] them right amen and we think about oh my
[50:43] God you know he's too busy how can he be
[50:45] too busy he's still hold in the universe
[50:49] everything that you can see God still is
[50:50] in control of iten right the prophet of
[50:53] God said he can and the word of God
[50:55] tells us that he even knows the numbers
[50:57] of hairs on your
[50:58] head he knows amen every time the flee
[51:02] blasts his
[51:03] eye now he he's so under control he
[51:06] knows everything and my point is how
[51:09] come you feel like he doesn't know what
[51:11] you're going through he does he ordained
[51:14] it the footsteps of a righteous man are
[51:17] ordered by the lord well God I fail
[51:19] today do you think God was
[51:22] surprised oh God I I didn't I didn't
[51:25] mean to do it he know that why you tell
[51:27] him that but he loves to see repentance
[51:31] amen God loves that Hallelujah God loves
[51:35] to see repentance he even given a
[51:37] parable he said what if a father and I'm
[51:39] just paraphrasing this Parable says
[51:42] would tell his sons he said go do this
[51:44] and one voluntarily said yes I'll go do
[51:46] it he said then the other one says no
[51:48] dad I'm not going to do it he said but
[51:50] the one who says I'm not going to do it
[51:52] repents and the one who says I'm going
[51:55] to do it don't he just don't he he just
[51:58] doesn't get to do it now he said which
[52:00] one of them did my will the one that
[52:03] says oh I'll go do it and didn't do it
[52:05] or the one who said I W won't do it and
[52:06] went to do it that's not
[52:10] hard many times amen we fail God but
[52:15] weent we repent and then we go do the
[52:18] thing that we said at one point we
[52:20] weren't going to do
[52:23] am I was telling the the young people in
[52:26] Sunday school this morning you know I I
[52:28] tell you what I I used to be afraid of
[52:30] the Holy Ghost hello cuz I didn't
[52:33] understand it and in the Pentecostal
[52:36] they jump and shout and jerk and scream
[52:38] and many times I thought they were in
[52:42] pain not knowing and understanding it
[52:45] but I told him I said once you get it oh
[52:47] my God you wish you had gotten there
[52:48] before then see it just it's it's
[52:51] something of another world Hallelujah
[52:54] come on somebody it's true
[52:58] amen did I finish reading what I was
[52:59] reading yeah what if God willing to show
[53:02] his wrath and to make his power known
[53:04] endureed with much longsuffering the
[53:06] vessels of Wrath fitted to destruction
[53:08] and that he might make known The Riches
[53:10] of his glory on the vessels of Mercy
[53:12] which he have a for prepared unto Glory
[53:15] this wasn't something that God decided
[53:17] to do just now before the foundation of
[53:21] the world this is light I'm working with
[53:23] light I'm working with light in your
[53:26] soul and if you could take it anden
[53:28] you'll find an illumination going on
[53:30] you'll find something happening on the
[53:32] inside of your soul when you recognize
[53:34] that you just didn't happen to be
[53:40] here sometime we think and I've seen
[53:44] people carry on as if they had something
[53:46] to do with their
[53:48] salvation because of this idea you
[53:52] didn't do nothing you didn't even seek
[53:55] God it was God who sought you you
[53:57] Hallelujah so where is the
[53:59] self-righteous thing come in I I don't
[54:01] know it's only because people are
[54:04] ignorant to what light is and what the
[54:07] whole Plan of Salvation is all
[54:11] about
[54:12] Hallelujah is that all right the Bible
[54:15] said according to Psalm 271 the Lord is
[54:18] my light and my salvation Whom Shall I
[54:24] Fear wait a minute I'mma read that again
[54:28] the Lord is my light in other words he's
[54:31] my understanding he's my Revelation he's
[54:35] my God he's my healer he's my deliverer
[54:39] he's my everything I if I'm in the light
[54:42] I can see all that he
[54:45] is my salvation Whom Shall I Fear not
[54:49] when God right with me he said I'll
[54:51] never leave you nor will I forsake
[54:54] you that's the light of God
[54:56] that's a revelation of what his promised
[54:59] well Whom Shall I Fear Shall I Fear the
[55:01] boss man policeman president Pope
[55:07] Council of churches oh come on somebody
[55:10] Whom Shall I Fear the Lord is what the
[55:14] strength of my life without him I have
[55:16] no strength he is the strength of my
[55:18] life of whom shall I be
[55:24] afraid you don't think light has
[55:27] power the Bible said amen that when the
[55:30] light shine on Saul he
[55:33] fell fell from his Hearts hallelujah
[55:37] amen and when he fell from his Hearts
[55:40] guess what the light was so powerful it
[55:42] blinded
[55:43] him
[55:45] light hello who art thou Lord I am
[55:52] Jesus see listen when you really come
[55:56] into the light you really understand
[55:58] what you have but the problem is there
[56:00] so many of us don't know what we got oh
[56:03] I got the Holy Ghost but what is it who
[56:06] is it what does that mean hallelujah
[56:09] it's more than enough Amen to for the
[56:12] holy GH oh I I got the Holy Ghost
[56:13] because I come to church I got the Holy
[56:15] Ghost because I sing gospel songs I got
[56:17] the Holy Ghost what what does that mean
[56:19] to you it means amen if I've got the
[56:22] holy ghost in my soul that means I am
[56:25] him and he is me amen we're
[56:30] won that's why Paul wasn't afraid of
[56:33] death he knew where the light was he was
[56:35] a dwelling in the light he was abiding
[56:37] in the light Hallelujah and because of
[56:39] that he knew he could never die because
[56:42] death had no power over light as
[56:45] Darkness has no power over
[56:49] light but is a bad thing when you think
[56:51] you're in light and you're in darkness
[56:54] the church world all have no idea
[56:55] they're in darkness they think they're
[56:57] walking in the
[56:58] light see that's how we ought to be so
[57:01] appreciative of what God has given to us
[57:04] tell you what if any of us miss it it
[57:06] won't be God's fault hallelujah our
[57:09] attitudes is the reason why God answers
[57:11] and when he
[57:12] doesn't attitude toward the word come on
[57:14] somebody there Nothing But The Truth
[57:17] Listen that was Old Testament was David
[57:20] was saying this thing amen and what he
[57:23] wasn't you know uh like we are
[57:27] it was God with
[57:29] us but now is God in us amen hallelujah
[57:34] Psalms 119 105 says the word is a lamp
[57:38] unto my feet and a light unto my pathway
[57:41] in other words I get my direction my way
[57:44] of walking my way of talking my way of
[57:46] living by the word of God it is my light
[57:49] it is How I Live it is why I live it is
[57:53] the reason I live
[57:55] amen
[58:00] 119 and 130 says the entrance of the thy
[58:05] words giveth light it giveth
[58:09] understanding to the
[58:12] simple
[58:14] confusion will have no place in your
[58:17] life if you relied on the
[58:22] word huh because the word is light
[58:27] is that all right I don't know how long
[58:29] I've been gone but I'm I'm I just want
[58:32] to I want to I'm I'm sharing this
[58:33] because understand what the Bible says
[58:36] not the World At Large think they really
[58:39] have the
[58:40] gospel but they got another
[58:43] Jesus and the Bible says according to 2
[58:46] Corinthians 4: 3-4 it says but if our
[58:48] gospel be hid it is hi to them that are
[58:52] lost in whom the god of this world have
[58:57] blinded their minds because of their
[59:01] minds they cannot see even though they
[59:03] looking right at it they see you they
[59:05] see us they see it but they can't see
[59:08] because their minds are blind their
[59:11] minds are
[59:14] darkened of them which believe not lest
[59:17] the light of the Gospel the Glorious
[59:19] gospel of Christ who is the image of God
[59:22] should shine unto them in other words
[59:24] God purposed it
[59:27] God purposely blinded them for your
[59:34] sakes is that all
[59:36] right he purposely blind them and you
[59:39] know what we look at things like I I
[59:41] don't know I don't know what it is that
[59:43] we we can't seem to love him like we
[59:46] ought
[59:49] to but when you realize amen that God
[59:52] purposely blind like this Gentile age
[59:55] like he did the Jews for
[59:58] you it ought to do
[1:00:02] something and you and I who was in here
[1:00:04] worthy of this message you deserve it do
[1:00:07] you I mean come on now were you living
[1:00:09] so righteously out there in that in that
[1:00:12] in that denominational church out there
[1:00:14] or out there in the world that God says
[1:00:15] oh you deserve this come on
[1:00:17] in you didn't stop for God God stopped
[1:00:22] you and when you and I realize amen the
[1:00:25] light of this thing what is God trying
[1:00:27] to do produce a Love in Your Heart
[1:00:30] toward
[1:00:32] him even towards yourself because many
[1:00:35] of us are sometime disgusted with
[1:00:38] ourselves but it's not yourself that
[1:00:40] you're disgusted with you're disgusted
[1:00:43] with your
[1:00:45] Cosmos and that's not you amen amen
[1:00:49] because your Cosmos is
[1:00:51] perverted and your soul is converted
[1:00:54] amen
[1:00:57] see what I'm saying it's your Cosmos
[1:00:59] that you're upset with but God fixed
[1:01:02] that for you he condemned
[1:01:06] it I'm so glad that he's so condemned
[1:01:09] that we won't carry it with us all this
[1:01:12] sin and unbelief that's in this old
[1:01:14] flesh this old enemy of mine amen it
[1:01:17] will be down it will be destroyed
[1:01:20] Hallelujah and when the fire of God
[1:01:22] finish we'll be
[1:01:24] pure
[1:01:28] is that all
[1:01:29] right now we look at this thing he says
[1:01:32] if it be here is here to them that are
[1:01:35] lost and and and and and I'm going to
[1:01:37] say something to you because a lot of us
[1:01:39] don't realize
[1:01:41] this the Bible says according to Psalm
[1:01:44] 27:1 except the Lord build a
[1:01:47] house they labor in
[1:01:49] vain that building now I want you to
[1:01:53] understand there are denominational
[1:01:56] people who could put us to shame with
[1:01:58] the way they
[1:02:00] live but they're living it by law they
[1:02:03] living it by human effort believing it's
[1:02:06] the Holy
[1:02:08] Ghost oh oh yes and they can outlive us
[1:02:13] morally probably more
[1:02:15] clean in appearance oh come on and you
[1:02:18] don't have to say Amen but but it's true
[1:02:21] anyhow but you see it ain't it they're
[1:02:24] building the house
[1:02:26] they're the ones who are trying by human
[1:02:29] effort psychology whatever it is and
[1:02:31] they're looking pretty good is that
[1:02:34] right I I I don't have that quote with
[1:02:36] me but brother say you can pay your ti
[1:02:38] go to church you can do everything a
[1:02:39] Christian could do and he said can you
[1:02:40] still be
[1:02:41] lost as far as the East is from the
[1:02:45] West it ain't about your ability here
[1:02:47] it's about God Amen and his whole
[1:02:50] purpose now I love this because he said
[1:02:52] I have lost none so why should I be up
[1:02:55] said oh I'm going to be lost I'm going
[1:02:57] to lie I'm going to die oh no the light
[1:02:59] is I cannot be lost the light of the
[1:03:03] revelation of this message is the
[1:03:04] rapture can't take place except it go
[1:03:06] with me I go with it I'm part of this
[1:03:09] whole thing yes sir oh my people I I I
[1:03:14] just it was hard
[1:03:19] to except the Lord keep the
[1:03:23] city The Watchman
[1:03:27] waketh in
[1:03:28] vain now you go to Second Peter and you
[1:03:30] don't have to turn there first 2 Peter 1
[1:03:32] 3-10 and it tell add to your faith
[1:03:35] virtue knowledge Temperance y'all done
[1:03:36] heard the statute of a perfect man is
[1:03:37] that right what did Brother brandham say
[1:03:40] in that now if you've been like me if
[1:03:42] you were like me when I first heard that
[1:03:45] message I was trying to add you know oh
[1:03:48] I can't do this I can't do this and I
[1:03:50] shouldn't do this and you know just
[1:03:52] trying to keep myself from and that will
[1:03:54] run you plum crazy
[1:03:58] hello y'all hear what I'm saying but
[1:04:02] then one day I heard that message and
[1:04:04] you know what the prophet of God said
[1:04:07] you don't add to it it will add to
[1:04:11] you and I got to
[1:04:14] shout hallelujah amen I began to praise
[1:04:17] God because I realized when the storms
[1:04:20] come that's the rain I need to make me
[1:04:24] grow when the Sunshine it is the Sun
[1:04:27] that I need to make me grow when the
[1:04:30] lightning strike one of my limbs and
[1:04:33] turn me or cuts it off I realize that
[1:04:37] God is pring me Amen to make me bear
[1:04:40] more
[1:04:42] fruit come on
[1:04:44] somebody and when you see those things
[1:04:46] amen amen it gives you Joy to know that
[1:04:49] God is working on your behalf no matter
[1:04:52] what it looks
[1:04:54] like Hallelujah
[1:04:56] yeah he God Amen you know brother BR
[1:04:59] talk about transform and deform he said
[1:05:02] he said there's some some weeds that
[1:05:04] actually grows around and connects and
[1:05:05] pull a real fruit tree into a place or
[1:05:08] position it ain't supposed to grow but
[1:05:09] he said it's still a fruit
[1:05:15] tree oh Lord ain't God good to us I'm
[1:05:18] trying to get where I want to go I'm
[1:05:20] trying to get there how much time I
[1:05:23] got amen so let's look at this and and
[1:05:26] I'm saying that because I know my
[1:05:27] brothers and them got to go back to iow
[1:05:29] will say I don't want to keep them too
[1:05:30] long we look at this thing you and I
[1:05:32] must
[1:05:33] realize amen that the the Bible says for
[1:05:37] thus hath the Lord said unto me go set a
[1:05:40] Watchmen let him declare what he see now
[1:05:45] a Watchman nowadays would be a preacher
[1:05:47] right the prophet of God is going off
[1:05:49] the scene and we know what he was not
[1:05:52] only was he the evening light but God
[1:05:54] used him to reflect the evening life but
[1:05:56] God also used him as a day
[1:06:01] star hello God used him in other words
[1:06:05] the day star was reflecting in him why
[1:06:08] would you say that and I'm jumping here
[1:06:09] just to throw something out at you
[1:06:11] brother brandham kept saying the
[1:06:14] scientists say it's 3 Minutes to
[1:06:17] Midnight why would the evening light
[1:06:19] messenger tell you it's three minutes to
[1:06:23] midnight he was telling you the season
[1:06:26] was
[1:06:27] changing now amen the day star is
[1:06:32] shining I'm haing to this generation who
[1:06:36] are in this total
[1:06:38] darkness that the sun is about to shine
[1:06:42] hallelujah amen so now he's haing the
[1:06:45] coming of the son is that right he
[1:06:48] preached the message it is the rising of
[1:06:50] the sun now you must realize the sun
[1:06:54] don't rise without a
[1:06:58] battle Hallelujah and then the prophet
[1:07:01] preached a message on the wings of a
[1:07:04] snow white
[1:07:05] dove oh my God and he said though the
[1:07:09] dove was wounded it made it home in
[1:07:13] other words it got the message over and
[1:07:15] because the message is over the children
[1:07:18] of God will catch it and that same D
[1:07:21] that same me would make sure they get it
[1:07:24] home amen
[1:07:26] now you got to realize amen that if
[1:07:28] three minutes to midnight was before he
[1:07:30] died or went off the scene you got to
[1:07:33] realize now it's about the breaking of
[1:07:35] dawn yes
[1:07:37] siru and if it's a breaking of dawn
[1:07:40] there is the greatest battle ever fought
[1:07:44] amen amen hallelujah and that greatest
[1:07:47] battle that ever fought is when the
[1:07:49] darkness began to press itself against
[1:07:53] the light come on and what are you
[1:07:55] feeling in your mind right now Darkness
[1:07:58] amen pressing you on a daily
[1:08:02] basis trying to do what defeat you it
[1:08:06] cannot defeat you because you're the
[1:08:10] light is that right Jesus said ye are
[1:08:13] the lights of the world there was a time
[1:08:15] he said I am the light and as long as
[1:08:17] I'm in this world I am the light and
[1:08:21] guess what he says we must work while
[1:08:23] it's day because when the night cometh
[1:08:27] no man can
[1:08:29] work and brother Bram said at that time
[1:08:32] when no man can work he he says they
[1:08:34] will refuse or they will kill you even
[1:08:37] if you go to pray for
[1:08:42] someone he's telling us amen these dark
[1:08:45] Forces are gathering themselves against
[1:08:48] who the Lord and his Christ Hallelujah
[1:08:51] but what they fail to see is that the
[1:08:54] law of light
[1:08:56] will never be defeated can never be
[1:08:59] defeated because it is
[1:09:04] God the Watchman says the burden of Duma
[1:09:09] I look up that word Duma and it meant
[1:09:12] like uh silence or Edom or it was
[1:09:16] actually came from the word Esau the
[1:09:19] burden of Duma he calleth out to me out
[1:09:22] of Sea Air Watchman what are the night
[1:09:26] Watchman what of the night now what at
[1:09:30] what point in time this is night this is
[1:09:33] the age of Darkness this is the God
[1:09:36] Satan is the God of this evil age which
[1:09:38] mean he is the darkness that's
[1:09:40] overshadowing everything except the
[1:09:44] bride right he's got the church World
[1:09:48] brother bam showed us that through the
[1:09:49] vision he's got the church world but
[1:09:53] right now we are are in a
[1:09:57] battle and it is light against Darkness
[1:10:01] amen come on somebody but there is
[1:10:03] coming a break of day oh Lord have mercy
[1:10:07] think about it Joshua said Son stand
[1:10:10] still that I might defeat my enemy come
[1:10:14] on Amen and when when there was a break
[1:10:17] of day you and I must realize amen that
[1:10:19] the Bible tells us that Jacob wrestled
[1:10:22] with the angel all night amen and there
[1:10:25] was coming a break a day and the angel
[1:10:27] said let me go J says not so till you
[1:10:30] bless me
[1:10:31] hallelujah hallelujah and that's how the
[1:10:34] Bride of Jesus Christ is right now I'm

[1:14:36] I now we look at this thing and I'm I'm
[1:14:38] trying to close just just a moment just
[1:14:40] give me one more
[1:14:42] moment because I want you to realize God
[1:14:44] even showed it he showed it that when
[1:14:46] Egypt was in Blackness when Egypt was in
[1:14:49] such a dark place amen there was still
[1:14:53] light and go
[1:14:55] Hallelujah I don't care how dark the
[1:14:58] world is because I am a recipient of his
[1:15:01] light I'm in the light I'm walking in
[1:15:04] the light there's light in
[1:15:08] goam you got to realize amen if there is
[1:15:11] no other light is in me yes sir amen I
[1:15:15] know the truth the truth know
[1:15:18] me Hallelujah come on somebody I was
[1:15:21] telling somebody the other day yesterday
[1:15:23] I think it was I said brother brandham
[1:15:25] was living right now he'd
[1:15:27] die he couldn't take
[1:15:30] it he could not take the
[1:15:34] filth y'all hear what I'm saying what he
[1:15:36] saw in his day was wicked to him can you
[1:15:39] imagine what he would be going through
[1:15:42] he really would be out in the mountain
[1:15:46] somewhere now I want you to understand
[1:15:48] that that wasn't brother Brandon's
[1:15:50] feeling about things that was the god in
[1:15:52] him oh Lord almost
[1:15:56] intolerable of the things he saw in that
[1:15:58] day what is he thinking
[1:16:01] now what on Earth is he thinking
[1:16:06] now we a mature audience I was at a
[1:16:10] store where I don't care Walgreen or
[1:16:12] wherever I was and and all of a sudden
[1:16:15] my eyes hit the Sports Illustrated and
[1:16:18] it was just it was you know how they put
[1:16:20] them all by the counter they used to
[1:16:21] have them in the back now they put them
[1:16:22] up there with the canyon all that and
[1:16:24] and I didn't lust no no no I was bars in
[1:16:26] Noble I was trying to get a a a
[1:16:29] book it's called Starts with Food anyway
[1:16:32] but nevertheless they had these women
[1:16:35] and I wasn't lusting God allowed me to
[1:16:37] see it was just for a moment but I put
[1:16:40] it this way they were wearing fig leaves
[1:16:43] the little what all they call it that
[1:16:45] brother Brown say Kini
[1:16:49] beini they were leaves they literally
[1:16:51] were shaped like
[1:16:53] leaves and I thought if I had a mature
[1:16:55] audience I would bring it I thought but
[1:16:57] no I don't want to touch
[1:16:59] that you know because that thing has
[1:17:03] Spirits y'all hear what I'm saying my
[1:17:06] point is by the grace of God people we
[1:17:08] are living in a day how can people
[1:17:10] reject this message when few years ago
[1:17:13] that kind of a thing would have been
[1:17:14] unheard of and I remember those kind of
[1:17:17] books and things were consider
[1:17:20] pornography now they're right there on
[1:17:23] the shelves people we're here yes sir
[1:17:27] we're here am the Rapture can take place
[1:17:30] at any time hallelujah amen and you
[1:17:33] don't think these blood moves mean
[1:17:35] something you know God got scientists
[1:17:38] working on our behalf yes sir it's the
[1:17:43] truth brother B talks about the car uh
[1:17:45] the astronauts when they landed on the
[1:17:47] moon and all these kind of things and
[1:17:49] you know how that typed out the church
[1:17:51] and everything else and then people say
[1:17:52] well they didn't go to the
[1:17:53] Moon
[1:17:55] well according to the prophet of God
[1:17:57] they did cuz it was a type of the
[1:18:00] Bride Hallelujah but one day we'll go to
[1:18:04] a world amen amen that won't be just
[1:18:09] rocks oh I've got some more stuff but I
[1:18:12] I tell you what I we'll just finish it
[1:18:13] this evening it's just I don't know
[1:18:15] whether I just pray God that give you
[1:18:18] understanding give us all more of
[1:18:20] understanding that if we are children of
[1:18:22] the light and we're going to travel by
[1:18:24] light light and if there's no darkness
[1:18:27] in him he cannot pick up
[1:18:30] Darkness that's one of the reasons why
[1:18:32] your body will be
[1:18:34] changed no flesh and blood will enter in
[1:18:37] there that's right amen and you have to
[1:18:40] be changed your Cosmos everything about
[1:18:42] you must be changed in order or suitable
[1:18:46] for the light that will transport
[1:18:50] you creatures of
[1:18:52] light all right creatures of light the
[1:18:55] transformation and you see what brother
[1:18:57] how can it be let me put it this way in
[1:18:59] closing on this
[1:19:01] part the Bible tells us that Jesus Took
[1:19:03] Peter James and John up on the mountain
[1:19:05] that we call Mount
[1:19:06] Transfiguration now there was no man on
[1:19:08] earth that could have been they say
[1:19:11] according to English no such thing but I
[1:19:13] like saying it more
[1:19:16] perfect than Jesus Christ
[1:19:19] himself and here he was born of a body
[1:19:22] without sin there was no sinful element
[1:19:26] in
[1:19:28] Jesus now the only thing I I I say it
[1:19:32] like this is that I don't understand
[1:19:35] that how Jesus himself could have aged
[1:19:38] but he did in his
[1:19:43] flesh but even
[1:19:47] so he did not have to
[1:19:49] die to be
[1:19:53] glorified
[1:19:55] H he
[1:19:57] stepped out of prayer or whatever he was
[1:20:00] going through there and when they woke
[1:20:03] when they awaken they saw him two who
[1:20:06] had already gone
[1:20:08] on Moses and Elijah and Jesus standing
[1:20:11] up there just as glorified or more
[1:20:14] glorified than Moses and
[1:20:17] Elijah the light was bright as the
[1:20:19] Noonday sun and the word of God said out
[1:20:22] of that light come this is my my belov
[1:20:25] son hear ye
[1:20:29] him now the Bible said he
[1:20:33] sh it was
[1:20:36] glowing right and then when it was all
[1:20:38] over they saw
[1:20:42] Jesus and all I could think about is
[1:20:44] that Moses and Elijah went back to where
[1:20:46] they were in
[1:20:49] him here they were standing there and
[1:20:51] all of a sudden they disappeared where
[1:20:53] did they go
[1:20:57] Jesus Christ was the Moses Jesus Christ
[1:21:00] was the Elijah oh my and Jesus Christ is
[1:21:04] you
[1:21:09] amen that's where we
[1:21:13] are that's where we are and you and I
[1:21:17] must Realize by the grace of God that
[1:21:20] light must increase it must increase it
[1:21:23] must grow stronger long when we were
[1:21:25] babes like the like the morning sun we
[1:21:28] didn't have straight but there come a
[1:21:29] time when the sun itself become in its
[1:21:33] full strength amen and so must the s o
[1:21:36] NS Sons and Daughters of God must come
[1:21:40] into their full strength amen when they
[1:21:43] come into their full
[1:21:44] strength it's around about Harvest
[1:21:50] Time the light must increase the
[1:21:53] darkness must vanish you love the Lord
[1:21:57] let's stand I I just trust that somehow
[1:21:59] God allow you to see if you are children
[1:22:01] of the light your children of the day
[1:22:04] all Darkness must flee as our brother
[1:22:06] said Accord and he it was perfect he
[1:22:08] said it like this you know in in the
[1:22:11] book solom The Songs of Solomon he said
[1:22:13] you know the Shadows flee
[1:22:17] away and this bride like Enoch P
[1:22:23] me must not reflect a
[1:22:30] shadow hello
[1:22:32] somebody must not reflect a
[1:22:36] shadow the sun must hit her so
[1:22:40] perfectly that that building and the sun
[1:22:44] must be one no
[1:22:47] Shadows may God help
[1:22:50] us rightous father God we come before
