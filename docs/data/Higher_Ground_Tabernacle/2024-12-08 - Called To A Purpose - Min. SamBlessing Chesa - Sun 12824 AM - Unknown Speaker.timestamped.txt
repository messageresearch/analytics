[57:49] read i' would also like to read in
[57:51] Ephesians chapter 2 and verse 10
[57:59] for we are his
[58:05] workmanship created in Jesus Christ unto
[58:08] good
[58:10] works which God ha before ordained that
[58:14] we should walk in
[58:18] them amen amen for a short time this uh
[58:21] morning we want to speak on a subject
[58:23] called called to a purpose
[58:33] amen amen in the book that we read
[58:36] um in Jeremiah God told
[58:40] Jeremiah that before you were formed in
[58:42] the belly of your
[58:45] mother I knew
[58:47] thee before you were
[58:49] born before you were even
[58:53] conceived I knew of your existence
[58:57] and I ordain thee to be a
[59:01] prophet unto the
[59:03] Nations so Jeremiah became a prophet
[59:06] before he was even
[59:09] born and that's the purpose that he was
[59:12] called
[59:13] to and God gave him and called him to
[59:16] that purpose before he was even
[59:20] born and we know that does not apply to
[59:22] Jeremiah
[59:25] only appes to each and every one of the
[59:27] children of
[59:29] God before you were born on this
[59:32] Earth before you were even
[59:36] conceived God already knew
[59:39] these and he already had a purpose for
[59:43] you amen amen so for you to know your
[59:47] purpose you have to go to the
[59:50] maker
[59:51] Lord what's my purpose nowadays they
[59:55] tell you you can can become whatever you
[59:59] want but no you were not supposed to
[1:00:01] become whatever you
[1:00:03] want you were supposed to become what
[1:00:06] God wants you to
[1:00:08] be because he is the one who has a
[1:00:10] purpose for
[1:00:12] you you just didn't come to leave grow
[1:00:15] pay bills and
[1:00:18] die but he has a special purpose in your
[1:00:24] life in I know my redeemer
[1:00:28] believeth paragraph 27 the prophet of
[1:00:31] God says and god did did not make you
[1:00:34] and
[1:00:37] I just to see if he could do
[1:00:41] it he made us for our
[1:00:45] purpose therefore there is a purpose of
[1:00:48] us all being
[1:00:52] here you are not here just to be another
[1:00:55] human
[1:00:59] you are here because that God made you
[1:01:01] for some
[1:01:04] purpose amen amen you are not here just
[1:01:08] to eat the food that God
[1:01:12] growed you are not here just to leave in
[1:01:15] the house that men
[1:01:19] made or to wear the clothing that
[1:01:21] somebody else fashioned
[1:01:26] here for a specific
[1:01:29] purpose no matter how little you think
[1:01:31] you
[1:01:32] are no matter how big you
[1:01:36] are you you are
[1:01:39] important or how unimportant you
[1:01:45] are you are here to serve a
[1:01:50] purpose amen amen that's the word of God
[1:01:52] telling us you did not just come here to
[1:01:55] live and
[1:01:57] die you have been
[1:02:00] predestinated you have been called to
[1:02:03] fulfill God's purpose in your
[1:02:06] life amen amen you know when you buy
[1:02:09] something from the
[1:02:12] store something that you have to put
[1:02:16] together you can sit and you say I'm I
[1:02:19] went to
[1:02:21] school I have five degrees
[1:02:26] but you sit there and you spend five
[1:02:28] hours trying to figure out which piece
[1:02:34] goes all you need to do is go find the
[1:02:37] user
[1:02:40] manual and within 15 minutes you will be
[1:02:44] done because the user
[1:02:47] manual was made by the manufacture of
[1:02:50] that
[1:02:54] device so instead of spending 5
[1:02:58] hours if you follow the user
[1:03:02] manual yourself a lot of
[1:03:05] time because the person who rather use a
[1:03:10] manual is the one who created the
[1:03:13] device knows goes
[1:03:18] where God is the one who has your user
[1:03:22] manual he knows what goes where
[1:03:27] he knows where you are supposed to
[1:03:30] be that's why David say see the Lord in
[1:03:34] all your
[1:03:36] ways and he will direct your
[1:03:40] paths it doesn't matter how smart you
[1:03:42] think you
[1:03:44] are if you walk out of
[1:03:48] purpose if you walk in the way that God
[1:03:50] did not mean for you
[1:03:56] you will not
[1:03:57] succeed you might not understand what's
[1:04:00] going
[1:04:02] on all you have to do approach the one
[1:04:05] who made the user
[1:04:08] manual your user
[1:04:10] manual and if you follow
[1:04:12] it you work in his
[1:04:15] purpose and you will work in the way
[1:04:17] that God intended you to
[1:04:20] be we thank God for the use
[1:04:23] manual hallelu when we look into that
[1:04:27] word of
[1:04:28] God he tells us what we need to
[1:04:33] do amen amen in the Bible read of
[1:04:38] David David had a
[1:04:42] purpose when God was done with
[1:04:46] Saul he he told the prophet
[1:04:49] Samuel and he say stop mourning over
[1:04:54] Saul I'm done with
[1:04:56] him but I have a special
[1:05:00] person that I have to be
[1:05:03] anointed a special person who has a
[1:05:08] purpose to be a
[1:05:11] king and Samuel went to the house of
[1:05:15] Jesse and he says I have a word from the
[1:05:18] Lord that in your house there is a
[1:05:23] king and Jesse was right there
[1:05:27] he says I have a lot of young
[1:05:29] boys called all his
[1:05:32] sons and he says here they are pick your
[1:05:37] choice and Samuel the prophet he was
[1:05:39] right
[1:05:40] there with a horn of
[1:05:43] oil he went to
[1:05:46] elab no oil could come
[1:05:49] out he came to the Second
[1:05:52] Son no oil could come out
[1:05:56] he came to the third
[1:05:57] son no oil could come
[1:06:00] out because the first second third
[1:06:03] fourth that was not their
[1:06:06] purpose amen the purpose of being a
[1:06:09] king God had predestinated
[1:06:13] someone the fifth brother
[1:06:16] came the oil did not come
[1:06:18] out six seventh
[1:06:21] came nothing came
[1:06:23] out Samuel will said something is
[1:06:26] wrong God never
[1:06:28] lies why is there no King
[1:06:32] here then J says like
[1:06:34] oh there's another young
[1:06:38] boy who's in the back of the
[1:06:43] Wilderness who's hurting
[1:06:46] sheep see Jessie did not even consider
[1:06:52] David he did not even consider him to be
[1:06:54] a king
[1:06:58] amen amen but God he does not look at
[1:07:01] the stature of a
[1:07:03] man Hallelujah he looks back into this
[1:07:06] back part of his
[1:07:08] mind what he has predestinated for you
[1:07:12] then he says just call him up and then
[1:07:15] they called him from coming from heading
[1:07:16] the
[1:07:17] sheep and then as soon as heed
[1:07:21] there the oil of own started pouring out
[1:07:23] oil
[1:07:25] and they anointed David to
[1:07:27] be because that was his
[1:07:30] purpose no one else could come and stand
[1:07:33] in his
[1:07:35] place God does not have a replacement
[1:07:37] for
[1:07:39] you hallelujah hallelujah so when David
[1:07:42] was anointed right
[1:07:46] there his own family didn't even
[1:07:49] consider
[1:07:51] him but God considered
[1:07:54] him so people around you might not even
[1:07:57] consider
[1:07:59] you say he's just a useless
[1:08:01] bom but God does not look at you like a
[1:08:04] useless
[1:08:05] bom he that's my
[1:08:08] child that's my
[1:08:10] son that's my daughter and I have a
[1:08:13] purpose for
[1:08:15] him and David after that he went back
[1:08:19] into the
[1:08:20] Wilderness back where he was hurting the
[1:08:24] Sheep he was not even trained to be a
[1:08:29] soldier cuz he was just a red little
[1:08:31] fellow nobody considered
[1:08:34] him but his older brothers were in the
[1:08:37] Army but whilst he was
[1:08:40] there already anointed for his
[1:08:44] purpose the devil tried to attack
[1:08:49] him but your purpose will protect
[1:08:53] you hallelujah hallelujah he was
[1:08:55] anointed to be a
[1:08:57] king oh there's a lion that
[1:09:00] came to steal one of his
[1:09:03] sheep he went and he killed that
[1:09:06] lion there is a bear that tried to come
[1:09:10] to steal some of some of the
[1:09:12] sheep he killed it he had to overcome
[1:09:16] why because he was a king there is no
[1:09:19] lion that could eat
[1:09:22] him there is no bear that could eat him
[1:09:26] up because his purpose was not yet
[1:09:30] fulfilled in God's plan he was supposed
[1:09:32] to be a
[1:09:35] king nothing was going to happen to
[1:09:37] David until he became a
[1:09:41] king his anointing his purpose was
[1:09:44] protecting
[1:09:47] him so whatever purpose you have on your
[1:09:52] life will prot you
[1:09:55] Satan cannot do you no
[1:09:58] harm because your purpose is protecting
[1:10:01] you there is no sickness that can take
[1:10:04] you

[1:10:10] you so long you have breath in your
[1:10:14] body so long you are still
[1:10:17] alive you have a purpose in your life
[1:10:20] because as soon as you are done you
[1:10:23] won't stay one second longer
[1:10:26] God will take call you back
[1:10:28] home so you are seated right there this
[1:10:31] morning you got breath in your
[1:10:34] body I'm here to tell you that God is
[1:10:36] not here down with
[1:10:39] you he has a purpose in your
[1:10:41] life so you got to know there is not
[1:10:44] enough demons in
[1:10:46] hell that can stop the God's purpose in
[1:10:49] your
[1:10:51] life hallelujah hallelujah oh just turn
[1:10:53] around and tell your neighbor God
[1:10:56] purpose I got a
[1:11:00] purpose so David was sent by his
[1:11:04] father him say go give your uh your
[1:11:06] older brothers
[1:11:09] food even if he was although he was even
[1:11:11] anointed to be a
[1:11:14] king they didn't even consider him
[1:11:16] worthy to enough to go to the
[1:11:21] war say he just a small boy what is
[1:11:23] going to do
[1:11:25] but God was seeing
[1:11:27] differently and when David came he
[1:11:29] brought the food to the
[1:11:32] brothers and while he was there before
[1:11:34] he went
[1:11:36] back he had a voice that was in the
[1:11:41] valley that was blaspheming against the
[1:11:43] name of the
[1:11:45] Lord he says what did I
[1:11:50] hear what's that and they said oh is
[1:11:54] this giant
[1:11:56] that's coming up yelling and throwing
[1:12:00] threats to the children of
[1:12:02] Israel and as soon as Goliath would
[1:12:05] start yelling and
[1:12:08] shouting they would all run in
[1:12:11] caves and try to hide
[1:12:14] away but when David heard it he says but
[1:12:18] hold up I got the Blood of Abraham
[1:12:21] flowing in my
[1:12:23] vein I have a promise
[1:12:26] that I am going to possess the gates of
[1:12:28] all the
[1:12:30] enemy hallelujah hallelujah and he
[1:12:33] remembered that I have a
[1:12:36] purpose I've been anointed to be a
[1:12:39] king so I'm not going to die until I
[1:12:43] become a king that's why he went up to
[1:12:47] Saul and he says I want to go fight
[1:12:51] him he just didn't say I want to go
[1:12:53] fight him
[1:12:55] but he says what's going to be done for
[1:12:57] the person who's going to
[1:13:02] [Music]
[1:13:05] win because he already knew he was going
[1:13:08] to
[1:13:09] overcome he knew his PO purpose was
[1:13:12] protecting
[1:13:14] him and they were told oh he will he
[1:13:16] will get the uh the King's
[1:13:19] Daughter whatever else he was going to
[1:13:21] get he says I'll
[1:13:23] go and he did not
[1:13:26] hesitate and he ran towards
[1:13:29] Goliath if you read your Bible your
[1:13:31] Bible tells you he did not
[1:13:34] walk he ran towards
[1:13:39] go he knew victory was
[1:13:42] certain victory was
[1:13:46] sure because it does not matter how much
[1:13:49] Weaponry Goliath Hado

[1:14:09] life he said listen a be tried to
[1:14:13] come I killed it a lion tried to come I
[1:14:18] killed it so what is
[1:14:20] gol he's just another beast and he ran
[1:14:24] towards
[1:14:26] swung that
[1:14:28] slingshot and he let that stone
[1:14:32] out what was he standing
[1:14:35] on he was standing on his
[1:14:38] purpose he knew he was called to a
[1:14:42] purpose to be a king so his
[1:14:46] purpose was a hedge around
[1:14:48] him his purpose was protecting
[1:14:53] him and he killed Goliath
[1:14:56] it does not much
[1:14:58] matter how many arrows Goliath was going
[1:15:00] to throw at
[1:15:04] David they were not going to
[1:15:08] work because nothing was going to happen
[1:15:10] to
[1:15:11] David until he became a
[1:15:14] king nothing will happen in your
[1:15:17] life until you fulfill the purpose God

[1:15:34] out until you have
[1:15:37] accomplished God's purpose in your
[1:15:40] life amen amen we take a look at
[1:15:44] Jonah Jonah was a man under
[1:15:47] purpose he tried to run
[1:15:50] away and he was right there in the
[1:15:53] boat and the storm
[1:15:56] started and they're trying to figure out
[1:15:58] what's going
[1:16:01] on but he kept on seting that he knew he
[1:16:03] was the
[1:16:07] culprit then he says hold

[1:16:12] me I'm the reason
[1:16:14] why cuz he knew he was trying to run
[1:16:16] away

[1:16:21] from God will always catch up with
[1:16:23] you you either do it God's
[1:16:28] way easier way or you try to run away
[1:16:32] and do it your
[1:16:34] way but he's going to catch up with you
[1:16:38] anyways and he says I'm the
[1:16:40] fall throw me in the in the in the
[1:16:44] ocean come on Jonah you aown

[1:16:57] in he didn't want to be the one to blame
[1:17:00] for
[1:17:03] that and they threw him
[1:17:06] overboard he knew he was on
[1:17:10] purpose there was not enough
[1:17:14] ocean that could drown
[1:17:16] him until he had accomplished God's
[1:17:20] purpose which was delivering God's word
[1:17:22] to n
[1:17:25] so he me out there and he knew God was
[1:17:29] going to protect him he knew his
[1:17:33] purpose was going to protect
[1:17:36] him there was no
[1:17:39] substitute it to
[1:17:42] be amen so he they put him in
[1:17:46] there and God created a
[1:17:49] fish that came to swallow
[1:17:52] him even if Jonah was in the wrong
[1:17:59] hallelu it doesn't matter what you have
[1:18:02] done it doesn't matter how many sins you

[1:18:18] you amen amen there is not enough
[1:18:23] Devils that can take you out until your
[1:18:26] purpose is
[1:18:28] done we look at
[1:18:31] Esther she knew she had a
[1:18:34] purpose she knew that she was the one
[1:18:36] who was supposed to save the
[1:18:39] Israelites she said although there is a
[1:18:41] decree that's made
[1:18:45] out that if the queen goes into the
[1:18:50] king without being
[1:18:52] summoned she could be killed
[1:18:55] but she fasted and
[1:18:57] prayed and she got up
[1:19:01] realizing I have the purpose to protect
[1:19:05] my amen she stood up and she went
[1:19:10] in fing Against All

[1:21:04] weapon is not going to

[1:21:27] Lord that weapon is going to
[1:21:30] work but not against me but it is

[1:22:53] us until
[1:22:54] that
[1:22:56] purpose that God has put us here
[1:23:00] for has been made
[1:23:03] manifest no no matter how much trouble
[1:23:06] we
[1:23:08] have how many heartaches or Sorrows that
[1:23:11] we go
[1:23:13] through all of these
[1:23:16] reasons they will not affect
[1:23:18] you they will not overcome you until
[1:23:22] God's purpose is fulfilled
[1:23:25] hallelujah hallelujah there is no pain
[1:23:27] that's going to take you
[1:23:30] out there is no sickness that's going to
[1:23:32] take you
[1:23:34] out until God's
[1:23:36] purpose has been
[1:23:39] fulfilled amen
[1:23:41] amen in
[1:23:43] Isaiah the word of God
[1:23:46] says the word of God when it is
[1:23:50] spoken it does not come back to God
[1:23:53] voice
[1:23:56] after it is
[1:23:58] accomplished that which he sent it out
[1:24:02] for God's word will not return to him
[1:24:07] void but after until after it is
[1:24:09] accomplished the purpose which you spoke
[1:24:11] it
[1:24:15] for when he said let there be
[1:24:18] light that voice wasn't going to come
[1:24:21] back to him
[1:24:24] was
[1:24:26] light when he says let everything that
[1:24:29] has let every seed bring forth after his
[1:24:32] own
[1:24:37] kind that word could not go back to him
[1:24:40] until every seed had come
[1:24:48] out and we know a word is a thought
[1:24:53] expressed so before it becomes a
[1:24:56] word it had to be a thought
[1:24:59] first amen amen and we know we were in
[1:25:02] the back part of God's
[1:25:05] mind we are God's thoughts
[1:25:09] expressed so we are the
[1:25:12] word God made
[1:25:14] manifest because he thought about you
[1:25:16] before the foundation of the
[1:25:19] world and he made you
[1:25:22] manifest so you are the word of God and
[1:25:26] the word of God cannot go back to him
[1:25:30] without accomplishing his
[1:25:32] purpose he will make sure it has to
[1:25:35] happen you you are the word of God you
[1:25:38] are not going to go back to
[1:25:41] God until you have
[1:25:43] accomplished the purpose that God
[1:25:46] brought you here
[1:25:48] for amen amen cuz we are the
[1:25:52] word god
[1:25:55] of so we are the word made
[1:25:58] manifest and the word never ever
[1:26:02] fails so you can never ever
[1:26:06] fail so it doesn't matter what comes to
[1:26:09] me I know it's working for my good I
[1:26:13] don't care how much depression comes to
[1:26:15] me I know it's working for my good I
[1:26:19] don't care how much anxiety comes to
[1:26:21] me I know it's working for my good
[1:26:25] I don't know how many Ops can come
[1:26:27] against
[1:26:29] me they will not
[1:26:31] Prosper because God will protect you
[1:26:36] your
[1:26:37] purpose will protect you you remember
[1:26:41] job job had a
[1:26:43] purpose he was the one who had to catch
[1:26:46] that
[1:26:48] Revelation that I know my
[1:26:53] redeemer there was no
[1:26:56] sickness there was no
[1:26:58] trial that was
[1:27:00] enough take job
[1:27:03] out because he wasn't going to
[1:27:06] die until he said I know my redemer
[1:27:12] lives Satan went to God or rather God
[1:27:16] told
[1:27:17] Satan he says have you considered my
[1:27:21] servant and Satan says
[1:27:24] what else could you
[1:27:27] expect you have given him everything he
[1:27:31] needs you have put a hedge around
[1:27:34] him I got a question how did Satan know
[1:27:38] that job had a hedge around
[1:27:41] him because before he had that
[1:27:43] conversation with
[1:27:46] god he tried to go t
[1:27:49] job but because of that hedge
[1:27:54] dirty hands
[1:27:56] on and then God had to give him
[1:28:00] permission to go pass that
[1:28:04] hedge for him to touch job amen am so
[1:28:08] you have a hedge around
[1:28:10] you you have God's protection
[1:28:14] around Satan cannot do nothing to
[1:28:17] you unless God allows
[1:28:21] it unless God permits it
[1:28:25] and for God to permit it he already
[1:28:28] knows that you are going to overcome
[1:28:30] it because all things are working
[1:28:33] together for your
[1:28:34] good he will never give you a trial you
[1:28:37] cannot
[1:28:39] overcome he wants you to overcome it so
[1:28:43] you can come out with a
[1:28:45] testimony so you can say I know my
[1:28:49] redeemer you can say I know Jehovah
[1:28:54] he will allow you to get
[1:28:57] broke so after he provides for
[1:29:01] you cat that
[1:29:03] Revelation I know my God he's a
[1:29:07] provider Hallelujah he will make you go
[1:29:10] through
[1:29:12] battles and he will come and he will
[1:29:15] fight those battles for
[1:29:17] you and after you have gone through
[1:29:20] them you say he is my Jehovah sh
[1:29:24] he is the god my
[1:29:28] banner and you can say he's I can say he
[1:29:32] is Jehovah
[1:29:33] Shalom he's the god of my
[1:29:37] peace because he promised me
[1:29:39] peace the Bible says peace that pass all
[1:29:44] understanding peace that passes all
[1:29:48] understanding say peace that makes no
[1:29:53] sense promised that to
[1:29:55] you hallelujah hallelujah so long you
[1:29:58] work in your
[1:30:00] purpose nothing can do you no
[1:30:03] har hallelujah hallelujah how many
[1:30:05] believe they have
[1:30:08] a amen amen Jesus had a
[1:30:12] purpose one day he went to a
[1:30:16] synagogue and they gave him the scroll
[1:30:18] to
[1:30:20] read and as soon as he got there
[1:30:24] they gave him the
[1:30:26] scroll and he opened it up to the book
[1:30:29] of
[1:30:31] Isaiah let's go to Luke 4
[1:30:35] ver and as they gave him the
[1:30:38] scroll he didn't look for any other
[1:30:42] word he didn't start reading in the
[1:30:44] beginning was the
[1:30:47] word he went
[1:30:51] right to where his purpose was
[1:30:55] verse 17 says and there was delivered
[1:30:57] unto him the book of the prophet
[1:31:00] Isaiah and when he had opened the book
[1:31:03] he found the place where it was
[1:31:06] written the spirit of the Lord is upon
[1:31:10] me because Heath anointed me to preach
[1:31:13] the gospel to the
[1:31:16] poor he has sent me to heal the
[1:31:20] brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to
[1:31:23] the captives
[1:31:25] what was he doing he was reading out his
[1:31:28] purpose to the
[1:31:30] people he's saying this is why I was
[1:31:34] born I was born to heal the
[1:31:38] brokenhearted I was born to set free the
[1:31:42] captives and recovering of the sight of
[1:31:44] the
[1:31:46] Blind and to set at Liberty them that
[1:31:49] are
[1:31:51] bruised verse 20 and he closed the
[1:31:55] book and he gave it again to the
[1:31:59] minister and he sat down and the eyes of
[1:32:02] them all that were in the synagogue were
[1:32:04] fasten on
[1:32:07] him and he began to say unto
[1:32:10] them this day this scripture is
[1:32:13] fulfilled in your ears what was he
[1:32:17] talking about he was talking about his
[1:32:20] purpose he's saying this is my purpose
[1:32:24] this is why I was
[1:32:25] born to come and deliver and set you
[1:32:29] free hallelujah hallelujah he said I
[1:32:31] didn't come for the
[1:32:33] Pharisees the Sadducees the
[1:32:35] self-righteous
[1:32:37] people I came to preach it to the
[1:32:40] poor I came to preach it to the
[1:32:42] blind
[1:32:44] brokenhearted if you have ever been
[1:32:47] brokenhearted Jesus came for you if you
[1:32:50] have ever been
[1:32:52] captive Jesus came for you because he
[1:32:55] says that was his
[1:32:57] purpose and there was not enough
[1:33:00] Devils that could stop his
[1:33:03] purpose the purpose the reason why he
[1:33:05] was
[1:33:06] born was so he could go to
[1:33:09] Calvary be that ultimate
[1:33:13] sacrifice where he would pay for your
[1:33:17] sins and bring you into your purpose so
[1:33:21] his purpose was to bring you your
[1:33:25] purpose that's why when he was in the
[1:33:27] garden of
[1:33:29] GS Lord if this pass if this cup could
[1:33:35] pass I
[1:33:39] would but
[1:33:43] nevertheless according to your
[1:33:45] will I will
[1:33:47] go why did he go he had a purpose he had
[1:33:52] you on his mind
[1:33:54] you saw you seated where you were
[1:33:55] sitting 2 years
[1:33:58] ago and he says because of my
[1:34:01] son because of my daughter I have to
[1:34:04] walk all the way up to
[1:34:07] Calvary and God left
[1:34:10] him Jesus was God and
[1:34:13] man he was not 50% man 50%
[1:34:18] God because if he was half man and half
[1:34:21] God
[1:34:24] he wouldn't be able to say I know what
[1:34:25] you're going
[1:34:28] through because he W feel everything
[1:34:30] that a man is going
[1:34:33] through but also he wouldn't be powerful
[1:34:36] enough to overcome what he were going
[1:34:40] through so the prophet of God says Jesus
[1:34:42] was a 100% God 100%
[1:34:47] man he was man enough to go each and
[1:34:50] everything you go through
[1:34:55] that's why he says I
[1:34:56] know whatever you going through he says
[1:35:00] I know the Bible tells us that there is
[1:35:04] no
[1:35:05] temptation that a man will ever go
[1:35:07] through that Jesus did
[1:35:09] not so whenever you kneel down in
[1:35:13] prayer you pray to God you can say Lord
[1:35:18] you know what I'm going
[1:35:20] through you know how it feels
[1:35:23] feels
[1:35:25] sick how it
[1:35:27] feels to go
[1:35:29] without so please come in my
[1:35:33] situation and he knows how it feels to
[1:35:36] be
[1:35:38] rejected he was rejected by his own
[1:35:41] father and his father left him God left
[1:35:45] him when he went to Calvary he was not
[1:35:48] man
[1:35:50] God he was only man
[1:35:54] because God cannot carry
[1:35:56] sin so
[1:35:58] rightous he had to leave
[1:36:01] him and when he walked that road via d
[1:36:05] Roa all the way to
[1:36:07] Cal caring your sins and my
[1:36:11] sins he was a man so when he says I
[1:36:15] know he knows what you going through if
[1:36:19] you're going through
[1:36:21] depression he went through depression
[1:36:24] if you're going through
[1:36:25] anxiety he went through anxiety he knows
[1:36:28] what that feels
[1:36:30] like if you not feeling
[1:36:32] well he knows exactly how it feels to be
[1:36:37] sick if you are
[1:36:39] broke and you are going
[1:36:42] without he knows how it feels to be
[1:36:46] broke through each and everything you
[1:36:48] can ever go
[1:36:50] through so when you are praying to God
[1:36:54] say Lord imagine if it was
[1:36:57] you what were you going to do was you in
[1:36:59] my
[1:37:01] situation and he will come to your
[1:37:04] rescue because he's been through that
[1:37:07] route he's been through that rout and he
[1:37:10] went all the way to
[1:37:12] Calvary as a man bearing your
[1:37:16] sin all the sins you
[1:37:19] committed he died for
[1:37:21] them your iniquities you
[1:37:24] committed he died for
[1:37:27] them the sins you are going to commit
[1:37:30] tomorrow he died for
[1:37:33] them he just did not die for
[1:37:35] them but he wiped it
[1:37:39] clean so Satan does not have the
[1:37:42] right to come and accuse you to say you
[1:37:46] did this two
[1:37:48] years you can tell him I never did it in
[1:37:50] the first
[1:37:51] place Christ came to die for
[1:37:54] me and he set me
[1:37:56] free the chains of my
[1:37:59] past cannot hold me
[1:38:02] anymore why because Jesus had a purpose
[1:38:05] to set me
[1:38:06] free and he was not going to leave this
[1:38:10] earth until he had accomplished his
[1:38:13] purpose hallelujah hallelujah when he
[1:38:15] was lying on that
[1:38:17] cross his hands
[1:38:20] outstretched he had you on his mind
[1:38:24] he had me on his mind and he cried out
[1:38:27] with a loud
[1:38:28] voice it is
[1:38:30] finished my mission is
[1:38:33] finished the purpose I've been born for
[1:38:35] is
[1:38:36] finished hallelujah hallelujah your
[1:38:39] troubles are
[1:38:40] finished your sickness is
[1:38:43] finished why because he accomplished his
[1:38:48] purpose there was not enough devils in
[1:38:51] hell that could stop
[1:38:54] him pilot was not
[1:38:57] enough pilot was not
[1:38:59] enough to stop him the Pharisees were
[1:39:03] not
[1:39:03] enough to stop him Judas was not
[1:39:07] enough to stop him because he had you on
[1:39:12] his mind hallelujah hallelujah he had to
[1:39:15] accomplish that
[1:39:16] purpose there were so many scriptures in
[1:39:19] the Old
[1:39:20] Testament that had to be fulfilled
[1:39:24] so nothing could happen to him until he
[1:39:27] fulfilled all those
[1:39:29] scriptures nothing can happen to you
[1:39:33] until you
[1:39:34] fulfill all the scriptures that talk
[1:39:36] about you Hallelujah hallelu when the
[1:39:39] scripture says you are a mighty
[1:39:41] conqueror you are not going to die until
[1:39:45] you become a
[1:39:46] conqueror you are not going to die until
[1:39:50] you possess the gates of all the en
[1:39:54] because that's your
[1:39:56] purpose nothing can take you out until
[1:39:59] you fulfill God's
[1:40:02] purpose Hallelujah when he was on that
[1:40:04] cross he cried it is finished I have
[1:40:09] done it I have accomplished that
[1:40:12] purpose and he gave up The
[1:40:15] Ghost and he
[1:40:17] died oh and they took his body
[1:40:20] down and they didn't even have a grave
[1:40:23] for him
[1:40:26] then they did not even believe he was
[1:40:28] going to
[1:40:31] resurrect they started
[1:40:34] crying we thought he was going to
[1:40:36] deliver
[1:40:40] us and they said our hope is
[1:40:44] gone but he was right there his purpose
[1:40:48] on the Earth was
[1:40:51] done but he still had another purpose to
[1:40:53] go to
[1:40:55] hell hallelujah hallelujah when he said
[1:40:58] it is finished he says it is finished
[1:41:01] here on
[1:41:02] Earth and they took his body
[1:41:06] down they didn't have any place to put
[1:41:10] him and under
[1:41:13] inspiration they didn't know what they
[1:41:14] were
[1:41:15] doing but they borrowed a
[1:41:19] grave have you ever heard of a grave
[1:41:22] being borrowed
[1:41:26] well if you take my
[1:41:28] grave then when I die where am I going
[1:41:30] to
[1:41:32] go they borrowed the grave of Joseph of
[1:41:38] ARA and he gave it to
[1:41:40] them they didn't know what they were
[1:41:43] doing it was a prophet prophetic
[1:41:47] gesture the
[1:41:50] borrowing means you have to return it
[1:41:54] so they borrowed the tomb of Joseph of
[1:41:57] Aria because they were going to return
[1:42:00] it to
[1:42:01] him hallelujah hallelujah so Jesus was
[1:42:04] laid in a border of
[1:42:08] grave tried to seal him
[1:42:11] in and they put a
[1:42:15] rock on the opening of the
[1:42:18] grave and they put a Roman soldier
[1:42:21] there yeah his disciples are going to
[1:42:23] try and steal his
[1:42:25] body and say he
[1:42:27] resurrected but did he know his mission
[1:42:30] on Earth was done but there was another
[1:42:33] mission he was supposed to go
[1:42:36] accomplish so whilst his body was laying
[1:42:39] in the
[1:42:40] grave he had another place to
[1:42:44] stop and he walked down to
[1:42:47] Hell hallelujah hallelujah and he came
[1:42:49] knocking on the
[1:42:51] door he came knocking on
[1:42:54] and they said who is it they said it's
[1:42:57] it's Jesus and all hell started
[1:43:01] trembling if you can put up the
[1:43:04] atonement paragraph
[1:43:07] 87 he knocked into
[1:43:09] hell and he went in there and he started
[1:43:13] looking for
[1:43:14] Satan Satan where are
[1:43:16] you because remember he had to
[1:43:19] accomplish his
[1:43:21] mission the prophet of God say

[1:43:28] he is boss now he reaches
[1:43:32] over grabs that key of death hel of the
[1:43:36] side and he took it away from

[1:44:59] purpose on
[1:45:00] Earth and he he accomplished his purpose
[1:45:02] in
[1:45:04] hell and he took those keys so Satan no
[1:45:09] longer have power over
[1:45:11] death Satan no longer have power over
[1:45:16] hell so all the people that had been
[1:45:18] under
[1:45:20] Satan God took those keys
[1:45:23] Jesus took those kills and he overcame
[1:45:27] him so Satan cannot kill
[1:45:30] you until your purpose on the earth is
[1:45:33] done because he does not have those
[1:45:37] rights he does not have those
[1:45:40] keys Christ took them away from
[1:45:43] him and he rendered him
[1:45:46] powerless amen and when he accomplished
[1:45:49] his mission in
[1:45:51] hell it was stand for him to rise up
[1:45:54] again it was time for him to get out of
[1:45:57] that b of

[1:47:02] Hallelujah early Sunday
[1:47:05] morning there was an
[1:47:07] earthquake the Earth couldn't hold him
[1:47:10] anymore oh and that stone rolled
[1:47:13] away and he came out
[1:47:16] Victorious the Virgin born son of
[1:47:20] God he had overcome death hell and the
[1:47:24] overcome each and
[1:47:26] everything and he became
[1:47:29] Victorious he got the
[1:47:31] victory so you can get the
[1:47:34] victory he accomplished his purpose so
[1:47:38] you can accomplish your purpose
[1:47:40] hallelujah hallelujah if he overcome
[1:47:42] death hell and the
[1:47:44] grave you can overcome it
[1:47:47] too There Is No Death that can hold you
[1:47:51] down there is no no sickness that's
[1:47:54] powerful enough to hold you down if you
[1:47:59] Rose up you can also rise up I don't
[1:48:03] care what situation you are in I got a
[1:48:06] word for you this morning you can rise
[1:48:09] up cuz you are walking in your
[1:48:12] purpose when you are in your
[1:48:16] purpose nothing can stop you hallelujah
[1:48:20] hallelujah because God does not look at
[1:48:22] you
[1:48:24] he looks at the
[1:48:27] lamb in the book uh in the message
[1:48:30] job paragraph
[1:48:32] 24 the prophet of God says that's the
[1:48:35] way it is
[1:48:37] today we guilty
[1:48:40] unworthy and should
[1:48:42] die we are not worthy of
[1:48:45] leaving we are not worthy to come to
[1:48:50] Christ we are not worthy to ask for
[1:48:55] anything but God never looks at your
[1:49:00] unworthiness Hallelujah he doesn't look
[1:49:03] at your
[1:49:04] fault it says he looked at the
[1:49:07] lamb now if he can find no fault in
[1:49:11] Christ then you are
[1:49:13] free he died in your
[1:49:16] stead amen amen now if there is any
[1:49:19] fault with him
[1:49:22] you are not free yet back in the Old
[1:49:26] Testament when someone committed a crime
[1:49:28] or if they
[1:49:30] sinned they would try to find a
[1:49:32] blameless
[1:49:36] lamb to offer to go offer it as a
[1:49:41] sacrifice so that it cover their
[1:49:45] sins listen the blood of the
[1:49:48] Lamb did not erase the sins
[1:49:52] just covered
[1:49:54] them and they would it would ease their
[1:50:00] conscience but right after leaving the
[1:50:03] temple if he goes and
[1:50:06] sin to find another one to come
[1:50:10] back because the blood of that
[1:50:12] lamb didn't do you no
[1:50:15] good because the life of man is
[1:50:17] here and the life of an animal is here
[1:50:21] so a lower life
[1:50:23] can help
[1:50:25] you amen amen that's why God had to give
[1:50:29] his perfect
[1:50:31] sacrifice CHR on a
[1:50:34] purpose to come and redeem you it says
[1:50:37] he examines the
[1:50:40] lamb you say I'm not worthy to walk out
[1:50:43] of this
[1:50:47] wheelchair that's right you are not but
[1:50:50] God doesn't examine you
[1:50:53] he examine
[1:50:55] Christ and if he is
[1:50:58] worthy then you can walk so when the
[1:51:01] priest was examining the
[1:51:04] lamb the L was dying in the stad of the
[1:51:07] person who who brought the
[1:51:12] lamb when the priest would look at the
[1:51:15] blameless
[1:51:18] lamb lamb is the Lamb is blameless
[1:51:22] you become
[1:51:24] blameless because the lamb died in your
[1:51:28] stead hallelujah hallelujah the prophet
[1:51:31] of God is saying God looked at the lamb
[1:51:35] not you so he was looking at
[1:51:37] Christ not you so when God when Jesus
[1:51:42] died on
[1:51:43] Calvary he was the blameless
[1:51:47] lamb remember pilate
[1:51:49] said I find no fault in him was not just
[1:51:53] his
[1:51:54] saying he was fulfilling
[1:51:57] scripture because the Lamb of God had to
[1:52:00] be
[1:52:02] examined the reason why he had to be
[1:52:06] blameless so that you could be
[1:52:09] blameless amen he says it depends on
[1:52:11] what you think about
[1:52:13] it you say brother brandham I'm an awful
[1:52:17] woman I've lived
[1:52:20] illegally I've even broken my marriage
[1:52:24] vow I've done this and Mr Bram I tell
[1:52:29] you I've been a
[1:52:31] drunker I've done this he says no matter
[1:52:35] what you done God never looks at
[1:52:38] you he looks at the lamb amen he looks
[1:52:42] at that Bloody
[1:52:44] lamb and he has already accepted the
[1:52:48] lamb so if he has accepted the lamb he
[1:52:50] has accepted you
[1:52:54] so you are
[1:52:55] free God cannot see
[1:52:58] you he sees the
[1:53:00] lamb the lamb he sees the lamb that dies
[1:53:03] in your
[1:53:04] St hallelujah hallelujah that's enough
[1:53:07] to make a fellow
[1:53:10] shout so whatever you have
[1:53:13] done God does not look at you he looks
[1:53:17] at his bloody lamb
[1:53:20] jist who died on Calvary
[1:53:22] and when he sees that he
[1:53:25] blameless he doesn't even have to look
[1:53:27] at you he because the lamb is
[1:53:31] blameless you are
[1:53:32] blameless you haven't done it in the
[1:53:34] first
[1:53:36] place Hallelujah hallu so you've been
[1:53:39] set
[1:53:40] free to walk into your
[1:53:43] purpose that you were born
[1:53:45] for and your purpose will protect you
[1:53:50] hallelujah hallelujah and remember all
[1:53:53] things work together for
[1:53:56] good for them that love the Lord you
[1:53:59] might say I don't understand
[1:54:02] it but the word says it's working for
[1:54:04] your
[1:54:05] good say I don't understand why I'm
[1:54:07] going through
[1:54:09] this but it's working for your
[1:54:12] good say I don't understand why I'm
[1:54:14] going through this
[1:54:17] breakup but that breakup is working for
[1:54:19] your
[1:54:21] good might not understand and say why am
[1:54:23] I being
[1:54:26] rejected it's working in your
[1:54:29] good it's not a rejection but it's God's
[1:54:34] redirection what you thought was a
[1:54:36] breakdown is God break making you have a
[1:54:42] breakthrough because if you are working
[1:54:44] in per if you're walking in your
[1:54:47] purpose everything is working
[1:54:50] out for your good
[1:54:54] stand amen
[1:55:04] amen how many believe that this
[1:55:08] morning you have been born with a
[1:55:10] purpose you were just not born to leave
[1:55:13] and die
[1:55:16] each God predestinated
[1:55:18] you so you could reflect him
[1:55:22] so you can be a reflection of
[1:55:25] Christ that's your purpose he wanted to
[1:55:29] brighten this last
[1:55:31] day that's your
[1:55:33] purpose amen amen whatever you
[1:55:36] did doesn't
[1:55:41] account if you confessed
[1:55:43] it he doesn't look at it remember you
[1:55:46] have to confess it
[1:55:48] first he doesn't look at you he doesn't
[1:55:52] look at what you
[1:55:53] did he looks at the
[1:55:55] lamb look at
[1:55:57] Abraham Abraham was a
[1:56:00] liar but in the book of
[1:56:02] Hebrews when his name was written in the
[1:56:04] Hall of
[1:56:09] Fame he says it was he was
[1:56:13] faultless he was
[1:56:15] blameless look at
[1:56:17] David David he committed a
[1:56:20] sin and committed another sin to cover
[1:56:22] that
[1:56:24] sin but because he was a man after God's
[1:56:27] Own
[1:56:28] Heart when his name was written in the
[1:56:31] book it says he never done it in the
[1:56:34] first
[1:56:35] place Sarah doubted
[1:56:38] God but her doubt was not accounted
[1:56:42] for it says she was judged
[1:56:45] Faithfully she never doubted God but
[1:56:49] Although our minds know that she laughed
[1:56:54] does not look at that he looks at the
[1:56:57] purpose because your purpose will
[1:57:00] protect you and it will carry you
