chapter 7 verse 1 and the Lord said unto Noah come thou and all thy house into the ark for thee have I seen righteous before me in this generation let's turn to Matthew chapter 24 I don't know much verse 37 won't cut it will read 37 through 39 but as the days of Noah were so shall also the coming of the Son of Man be glad mmm I live in Monte Vista Don Perez in the days of Noah that were before the flood they were eating and drinking and marrying and given in marriage until the day that Noah entered into the ark and knew not until the flood came and took them all away and so shall also the coming of the Son of man be I want to preach this morning on the call of the Spirit may God bless the reading of his words you can have your seats brother branham told a story about an eagle that an eagle egg that was put under a chicken the egg Ligeti loved elective and we're all familiar with the story how a farmer had found an eagle egg and come on and he put it up under his chicken and that chicken took care of that eagle egg and the eggs hatched all the eggs had and the chickens were quite comfortable in the in the barnyard they would scratch in the manure pile eating bugs they were comfortable they were chicken but the eagle did not feel comfortable mainly tobacco he seemed like he was out of place and he thought he was a chicken and he did his best to act like a chicken and to live like a chicken but there was a problem he was not a chicken so he could never be satisfied no matter what he did no matter how many bugs he ate no matter how many chicken revivals I had competitive failure he could not be comfortable he passes on because he was not a chicken one day mama knew she had another egg she come flying over the hill screaming Keo Junior where are you no junior where are you and she went right over the chicken yard if this you play and she screamed junior like eh shivers went through his mind he never heard the voice before but there was something in that voice said he news but I've watched laughing he knew the eagle sound canoodling there was a deep call in his heart I've been hung girl and she said come up here mama I don't know how to get up she said you're an eagle baby he said I never used these when Diwali comes and so he started flapping his way lazy before pieces in he was a little clumsy at first CPR but he got up to the fence line man clearly that he faced only she says you gotta come up I come on tail call he started flying away my uncle says he got up over the bar he was feeling good but she said come upon taco and pretty soon the wind Carter here pay Lu then she found her god-given place visa sown on rocky job now the potential was always there donated his own she was always an eagle but she was awakened by the ego it was the spirit that was hunting her and that's the way it is we were born in this world we live like the world we did we were sitting on the lookin for God the very nature of man is to look except the father is like this and he's looking for the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit daughter of God preparing us for us in the days of Jesus there were millions we're looking for a deliverer but when the deliverer que las carreteras vineyard they rejected him along because they were looking for something else there was millions but he only reveals himself to 12 and one of those are a devil InnoCentive Lakatos he see notice this they were those who were looking for his appearing D LaMacchia V Sookie who got me kept on this on Apollo Bible said as many is believed ordained to eternal life ee o the Pharisees read the same Bible every church denomination reads the same Bible is Lucy say but the priests were trying to serve God according to their works mailing the law but God ReWalk God revealed himself the fishermen may just have little memory shell they call him a friend of sinners he or not believe he was sure he revealed himself to prostitution even ask him why are you always eating with the publican gmm people participated why didn't he reveal himself to KF s evilly why didn't he come to care for society he never did it in the puffy but he did reveal himself to a prostitute in prostitution this is hard to comprehend hundred and twenty believers in some tents so fan out of the Ionians of Israel are just a few if your name is not on the book of lies don't only but only for this you cannot respond to the words you look upon what is it this amazing the priest calls Jesus the devil ELISA Qatar pleases you and legibly they read their Bible is only let they paint their paths of B look they went to church and they call Jesus the devil is roughly Syrian people here come a harlot walking down the road and when he said told her her life she said we do with Messiah would come tell us these things shows see in those priests was no predestinated every policy the prostitute there was a prius related syria being supported is beyond she was an eagle to begin a global small how to make you shout notice this every age God sends his word you don't suck us to over supper and that word is like the lights wearing a party early possible and it quickens the seed the Electra spawned Elizabeth upon but the note I left walk away knows me and God is searching now it's recession and God is calling his electability modest hauling his elect is drawing them there are some people who will never be saved yet result in films are movie the Bible tells us in Jude 1:4 that these are men ordained to condemnation Oh Daniel a poem Denison and they would not believe though Jesus walked on water Yonkers is real messy though he spoke to storms and stopped enough to pay the Tom paid and he even told the rich young ruler he said they will not believe even if one is risen from the dead when Lazarus was raised from the dead they wanted to kill Lazarus that's your Bible they would not believe though one was risen from the dead you need puck Walker that's not a people this is hard to understand they could look at the miracle spheres we got big volume you'd still not believe in equality they were all dying the condemnation blew me up on Tennessee their brute beasts made to be destroyed brother madam said there will be millions for Dane to condemnation when I'm with ya Bianca don't can you say man now brother branham said you are blessed if there's a hunger in your heart we have been these hunger thirst after righteousness for they shall be your blessed because there's a call in your life of all that the father has given me will come bucyk anabel medina won't lose ones in it that will come and no man can come to me except the father draw why should you fail will I clear and I will not cast him out in this for a boy if there's a pull in your heart for more God it is God dealing with you if you ever had a thought of coming to God it's less I mean if you're the most blessed person that ever walked on the face of the earth longer could be because the Holy Spirit is calling you you ought to be the most thankful person you look on this song when you can believe God loves you when you can fear the Lord but you can cut the church who believe rich we got the word with music wow you ought to be the happiest person knowing that you're not ordained to condemnation okay soon as I may feel that you are deign to eternal eye or banana people and that your name is written on the line I know II think he believed what God is passing to the lady looking for young people daughters of God willing I think the family of God who felt good they feared assisted you just like Ruth from weeks Ruth is a Moabite hoodlum women she's a reject God in His grace had heard his bluff before normally leaving up into the land of Moab spirit land than to be de moi she lost her husband LF L do so Naomi lost her husband no she is at a crossroad you know that cross road was good not bad services cross road it didn't the best to see what kind of decision we're going to make walking this is your she could have went home to her family more she could follow that road that led to God he was a shoemaker when she came to the decision she said you're gonna be my god your people will be my people when she went down that road Naomi going to people that she knew nothing else I loved who had a religion she knew nothing else it was right about the time of barley harvest wheat harvest was Pentecost she came in and barley harvest and it don't can she went by the end of the harvest she was redeemed and if she was married did she become a mother in Israel and if you die man and the Bible said she happened to walk right into the field of bull ass Louis was the lord of the harvest his eyes looked out and seen a male white woman he sees your damsel is this they said all she came from the world she's just a worker just a worker tell you what he calls his workers who said don't touch you keep your hands off you make her let it come back to this field I want you to drop hit balls of grain to her special it's just like a meeting the Holy Ghost drops handfuls of grains to encourage us to keep us in the field of bones [Music] this field has everything you need the end of the story is beautiful enough entities probably because she marries boys I'll surely love you naughty boy and how do poems come open me up take boys it was even your baby out of open come Jessie it was evening David produced a lineage that led all the way to crises that feed up God has led you to himself jigs up on jury I'd remember aren't you happy for the leader shuffled off and Holy Ghost is pulling us his penis that to you listen whether you're a prostitute - same with the tree a drunkard to say I'm a sinner I'm so empty sure whatever it may be God is calling you soon as I better come yeah yeah he says in the scripture see let us reason together though your sins be scarlet they will be as white as wool you have a desire for God because your name is on the book he's not really busy anointed only and God this is about you and God is that people do fool not about a church not about a doctrine organization it is about you and a personal relationship with God is so real AJ the end to the heart that seeks him he'll meet you in your kitchen you'll be chillin in the garden but won't want a dog listen when you're washing your laundry love Eve when you drive in the work looking for you God will meet you in the words of Pohnpei they'll call you bubbly raise your silly movie this message is calling the elect we feel the pole in our hearts is know is a heavenly calling you don't all that touches your lapel and I just come out of Genesis chapter 7 verse 1 is regeneration is where the spirit told Noah come down is the idea Noah into the ark song laughs you know the story of Noah is criticized surveillance probably they criticize the size of the arc in chemo she only laughs how did all the animals fit on that Ark do this anymore and how did they breathe and how did they get rid of the waste the waste of the animals how did they dispose of the waste disease on big and so the scientists criticized the story but you know Jesus said as it was in the days of Noah so shall it means that we could have become little Jesus see the story of Noah this is really a little annoying but you know the problem with the scientists available work is on this is they're looking at it from an intellectual standpoint Pirogov a complaint in Excel but the whole story is supernatural put this growl is so natural and it is super [Music] super natural connects when we live by faith don't matter how the animals breathe put a prophet in the belly of the whale Jesus believed that story too God could have fed those animals he who broke in fed 5000 myth young leaves and he took care of everything that needed taken care of him at heart he's funded it was super can you say Amen the Bible also says when Jesus descended into hell after they crucified him John will fill up how many knows that but he will to help us Jonah was in the belly of the whale for three days coming from the puzzle and what did he do he preached to the souls in prison either pre-show salmon that would not repent in the days of Noah could say like this is all depends upon people don't know the story of Noah was true can you say man and so in the days of Noah it only jeweled annoy it was a day like this day the Spirit of the Lord said I will not always strive with man in his pages in your VP but his day shall be a hundred and twenty years old a long song and that man had corrupted his way among the earth along my victim Bible said his thoughts were continually evil a liability case upon say that violence had filled the land he loved asleep if you'd only be and God and seemed that he could do no more with man did yoga Dakini fit our premium Victor look the Bible said Noah found grace in the eyes and a God who no ever because God is searching looking for somebody who chef sir this word stand in this generation and stand for God he pulled up with this young orphan senior out of the millions God found Noah he didn't even know God sent Noah warning a drop of a novella he said the end of all flesh has come upon a reticule I found a picture Noah sees a vision in the way of univision and when he sees the vision in love he sees an ark love loves a great mammoth vessel vastly go and he sees how to make it and build it I love you come on the vehicles truth it does and what it is it is a way for people to escape his appearance Truman the judgment God is gonna send on the earth this is Munky two different ways because mercy always goes before judgment must be like let me sit before God brings judgment he always sends a message of grace and other sacred universe which is more you don't what to do so massage the glass but it's it's only to those who want mercy if it was you us this one grace mercy of God so God gives him a lot of time I don't Julia I've been able to do Tom now know what the Bible says in Hebrews eleven lability don't it would let Noah by faith built this Ark we know apples - laughs powerful so God says it's gonna rain it had never rained in the history of mankind in every popular evolved on his brother Noah by faith look out know if I laugh I saw the storm clouds he saw the judgments of God coming his heart began to beat with God he knew that there was something coming every Texas tyranny no one was looking into the unseen realm no God no I was in tune with God he believed God's Word he that before the rain started home don't you and by faith he prepared an ark people articles through the Bible said Noah moved with fear Eli because it you know we have for you a clue and you know you can't fear unless you have faith I'm what you see because the fear of God is the beginning of wisdom I still I can't deduce it Lucas why would you here because you believe what a reverential fear Lord I believe your word I don't know what rain is but if you said it's coming I believe it you say judgments come and I believe know begins to prepare himself put yourself for Noah shoes we're living in the last days and the Bible tells us the signs of the time either people followed this but face must have works properly so face must have action until night if you believe God you can't stay as you are you'll pick up your hammer and nails and go to work we'll go to action Noah build an ark no apples peel out to the saving of his household we can't be selfish gooeys when we give our hearts to the Lord it is to the saving of our home your saving of our children the saving of our branches Noah sells his farm in the way I won't do so and he takes the money and he begins building they aren't the ones that comes to me laughs and I want you to notice something those first believers was his children Lamia quarreled annoyed because they saw faith in Hashem and I don't believe it was the preaching so much that convinced them if but they saw by his life he believed television we should be casting out everything that besides us every sin ready and as he began to build that Ark he sold everything you know that's the first thing Jesus said you've got to forsake everything chewed up on the officials in order to walk with God lost haven't you and as they saw their dad moved with fear he's on all the sudden that faith jumped off of Noah onto his sons why don't you get discouraged you just keep working on the hard buckle your children are watching you children are watching you your family is watching you if I'm Eva Sylvain you just do what God tells you to do a Jew before don't you soften your faith because of unbelief [Music] where do we begin with the rudder in the blue it was in the steering wheel there is no way to humanly govern this how do we build it Papa this is a God constructed art it must be built according to the instructions before sweet and God's church is not built by man is filled with the Holy Ghost it will take us to the new land watch the instructions and the materials they set out yeah no there's there's a bunch of Oaks here on this part of the property besides video and there's hardwoods over here hardwoods yeah ash maple new blog basically and he said no no no not according to what it's like a sponge if we build a boat and cut it down another tree we're gonna get the pitch out of the tree it produced the Holy Spirit he took the life out of that tree warded off this tree go for what sucks it in into what big affair why did you come here this morning just soak it in [Music] [Music] [Music] when they pull it in it makes it as hard as steel I imagine many of boat makers were saying that man is nuts he lost his rocker sit on my belt but I want you to notice God knew exactly what he was talking about now the word pinched in the Bible is an interesting word it's not like because the word pitch in Genesis songs is the same word used in Leviticus still mm okay is it only before atonement and so the words are the same I'll only mostly men so when they poured the pitch upon the Ark of his armies dude it's still like inside and out meaning there was an atonement that stood between them and the judgment the penile yells on for a lesion there is an atonement that stands between you and the wrath of God you are seal the ll did you [Music] [Music] there's the ark last was like the Tabernacle in the wilderness it had three levels love upon evil and the third floor in it was the first floor was creeping things super musically the second floor was fowls of the air 740 police were knowing his family alone noise - and in that floor there was a window in Familia V infinite and in that window the light and power in a glass your soul girl if they were discouraged hearing the screams outside walk under that light if Bibble got bit they cannot look sideways no little cop which really got the old we get discouraged when we look at each other no keep your eye single their souls I hope you know 120 years saw something Noah kept the faith no I got the love we all start out strong but we got to withstand the test of time Manu Duval his beer no offence criticism no IFIF I know I received rejection that one city lollipop certainly many came a mock spread all around the pond you was warning his age no way dude I felt feel so nice time is running out Luthor now pretty tall God is going to destroy the earth survived appeal that there you know what brother branham said Noah stood in the door of the ark come on boy it's a hard day's work yeah pisses you know I would stand in the door of the ark in the evening time no I probably don't you strong cool yeah loctifas a people getting home from work in is all you can hear people say you know Christianity is so detrimental like Lucas unease it's the love of God nothing I will do do you say how could God destroy the world come with Jupiter mom but I want you to see his love for 120 years before he's destroyed it makes available dude you also see what you read if you reject an opportunity of life rulership in opportunity dude what more can be done a know we stood in the door of the ark I don't know it didn't you that's righteous and then he began to prophesy he loves apple for today there will be something come that you have never seen before I think assistive yankin every time if you ever he will begin to prophesy it shall come to pass all the wicked will be washed away he pulling me salsa all sassy and did you know the ark was a sign you here see this mammoth structure it caught the attention of the entire world yes think of it as people in the evening would go to the tavern or they bar a loose rock on usually don't leave I'll be sitting on their barstool look out the window you're putting out on the hill yonder was an article in there far enough look we begin to preach to them you know you're wrong you know so he try to drink another one turning on the TV just to forget about it yeah our course assignment lots of men and women least so many fast seeing that sign and senior did you know that enoch built the pyramids so Fukuoka our coastal a parameter and Enoch was known in that time he know keep it cool niels it when Enoch disappeared no Isola and it was a sign to Noah he lost Roanoke III lose the pen simple no no no doubt that Noah's message in Enochs message correlated together we talk about astronauts walking up in the air when the doctors role in the earth will be destroyed again why and the spirit is crying come Holy Spirit is crafter the prophetic ministry the Bible said God not willing that any would perish make believers from hanging around they are everybody is watching all the sudden there's a strange atmosphere people brother branham told a story about a horse he's 12 did you see father Brennan was in the field with his daddy plowing phlebotomy people on the shore Vicks and he said all the sudden essaouira started snorting that did you cool Lucy by local mafia and brother branham said what's wrong with the horses Disick wafak said is there a coyote up there that the yeah pickles loads he said No he said there's a storm coming no young brother branham said but there's no clouds falling upon us it's typically Sonny Mays yeah literally he said his dad wiped his sweat off his forehead said you got a lot to learn that's it you drop all the horses have an instinct from God let me see following this weather you can see the storm or not voila God gives a warning to LA I felt and they'll head to the barns assure the world evil evil and brother branham said if God will give a horse enough sense to get to the barn he'd rip into me I saw what about us as sons and daughters of God don't mean if that God would speak Jubilee little girl and not only that but give us a place to wrap your hopes up if the name of the Lord is a strong tower just a young boy a young security you know there was a tsunami tsunami and they saw the elephant's run to high ground is on Felicity for Lanka in Thailand the Buffalo run to the high grade Montelongo Monty so there's an instinct in an animal notice in Genesis 7 1 / Martino Genesis estate and the Lord said unto Noah a judge come down and thy house into the ark feel great that me saw also the loss now notice this this is in captor 7 this is only a beautiful thing when the door looks good up on the final call is made what's good tell me I failed it be I'm gonna come down into the earth yeah I want you to notice something here's your rule and I think it's Rosa see all the sudden the birds begin to fly in you cool is local monster awfully you can imagine how eerie this was is the people like dimande and there's all four kinds of bird yes and they're flying toward the ark and they heavily on played on us something supernatural see naturally then they would see turtles donkeys and animals two by two all of them are being pulled in they are don't played on us and everyone is sitting there saying what is rabbits are going to do a little a penny more and so some people in order not to be afraid when they pop up they're trying to laugh it away this able to be gushy but you know God makes a way for those that want to be saying it was like a Jew hater Josh I'm a like coming in one by one you didn't uh something is pulling them make a choice believe that did I like our little Eagle story wanna at least obviously Bigler and you come here this morning because something is pulling your eyes something is draw me come except the father continue I believe that pole in your heart for God I'd like to is the same thing those camels I'm sure this is Shamu I know the sudden God speaks to know and said geez no time is over Noah steps into the ark after everything come in no I don't see them now and he says this is your last sign three four billion mama I want to mention son is here that Ark was so big is it - it people ego that art could not hold the entire world fifty thousand if we pop on Danielle Dumont on see God knew that Judas of it but it was available Mississippi available this point God knew only eight souls and those animals would be in their junior Lakers did he made it just big enough he left me that feels he go for all of those that he foreseen this way like you levy yeah he offered it to everybody mail I feel Filipino in the book of Revelation it tells us how big the city is you think more long you know there's somewhere where your name is on a mailbox yeah I've gone to prepare a place for you I'm coming again to receive you but you know the whole world ain't gonna be there God invites the whole world but he knows who will and who he knows who those that are gonna receive him so it's just big enough for God and his children go make sure you're there make sure you come while God is calling I feel good you look good job man as the people watching the strange sign there's almost a Noah screams this is your last time this is his last sermon in the door let me tell you Jesus said I am the door and the door of salvation was opened that you cannot measure that door and God is crying come down and that aren't his Christ and when the last animal come in it off get it done you money don't think we know all of Noah's family we didn't clap I need in the way don't they know what turned this back Noah and all of a sudden the door by itself everyone got shivers when the last one came in luckily dummy it don't play God the Bible tells us in Matthew 25 that when the wise fool a virgins win in love girl if users God there will be a time where God shuts the door you're on told you were filming and the opportunities if there's a speck of God in your heart you need to come while he's calling now Jesus said as it was in the days of Noah she's really remember so sure that we in the coming of the Son of Man you do man showing that Noah's days would repeat again in our days more concretely don't do noise no the half-way believers the Saudis don't wail they were scared of a pill and they said you know we'll stay close to the ark because no is a good man and but Noah couldn't shut the door the Bible said he shuts the door no man can okay so the halfway believers turn around before diesel I couldn't sleep that night they're nervous and the next morning they wake up and so they're like oh there was no and then the second day there was no rain but third day there was no and everyone just went back to their normal I hate cyclically don't love you know my but on the seventh day they heard thunder in the distance they saw lightning on the sky dark clouds of judgment begin to roll in and all the sudden it started raining and the borderline believers took off running to the ark and they're screaming and the rain is getting heavier the sewers are filling out the sewers are filling up everything bit houses begin to wash away school houses begin to wash away because these churches begin to wash away poor running out to the high heels waters gushing river people are losing their babies and their families the people are screaming they're gone there was a lot of those that made their own boats yeah baby one day though trying to get all just swallowed their bonus waters grew higher you find as it keeps rising people screaming and there say hear the wrath of God outside of the Ark is all don't really care but every every inch of that Ark has patrol men between them and the judgment of God and they're saying popper you sure it's gonna hold he said it's it's going to hold we survived in you I did it exactly to the world and all of a sudden I hear creaking and all the sudden they aren't breaks loose and the waters that was judging the people is lifted no above the judgment he lives on the way it stands between you and God

terrific judgment and God is calling us out of every denomination because man main boats won't hold us currently back to freedom and only the Bible says there's one church and it's the church Jesus
