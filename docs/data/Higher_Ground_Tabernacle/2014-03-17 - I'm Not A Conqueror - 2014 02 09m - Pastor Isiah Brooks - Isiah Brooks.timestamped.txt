[0:02] Remember I preached a message not long
[0:05] ago on power of thought or the power in
[0:11] thought. And so by the grace of God, we
[0:13] just want to uh work with the thought
[0:17] this
[0:19] morning. And I trust that you will never
[0:21] forget this
[0:22] subject. I'm not
[0:27] conquer. I want you to think about that.
[0:29] I'm not a conqueror. I know what some of
[0:32] y'all are thinking, but that's why I
[0:34] entitled it, I'm not a
[0:38] conqueror. First John 5 and
[0:43] four. Whatsoever is born of
[0:46] God overcometh the
[0:49] world. And this is the victory that
[0:51] overcometh the world, even our faith.
[0:57] First John
[0:58] 5:5, "Who is he that overcomemeth the
[1:01] world, but he that believeth that Jesus
[1:05] is the son of
[1:08] God?" 1 John 4:4.
[1:13] Ye are of God, little children, and have
[1:17] overcome them, because greater is he
[1:22] that is in you than he that is in the
[1:27] world. Let us pray. Heavenly Father God,
[1:31] we come before you, Lord, as humbly as
[1:33] we know how. We thank you for being so
[1:37] real to us. We thank you for allowing
[1:40] us, oh God, to see another day. Without
[1:44] you, Lord Jesus, we are nothing. And so
[1:47] therefore, Father God, we surrender all
[1:50] here this morning. We give you the
[1:52] praise. We give you the glory. We give
[1:55] you the honor, oh God, in your name,
[1:58] Jesus. We thank you. Amen. And amen. You
[2:02] may be seated.
[2:08] First of all, I'd like to say, you know,
[2:11] basically what is a
[2:13] conqueror? A conqueror is a
[2:15] victor. Uh to conquer or to get or gain
[2:19] by
[2:20] force, to win by
[2:25] fighting. And often time we go
[2:28] throughout the
[2:29] day perhaps believing that we are
[2:33] conquerors. But you cannot be a
[2:37] conqueror without the conqueror
[2:40] on the
[2:43] inside. Listen, the Bible tells us that
[2:46] the only reason why we are
[2:52] victorious is because the victor is on
[2:56] the inside.
[2:57] If the victory is not on the inside, you
[3:00] are not victorious.
[3:03] This is not a mind over matter
[3:06] battle. This is not something that you
[3:09] feel that you can do. This is not
[3:12] something that you can hope to do. Uh
[3:16] because without
[3:18] Christ, it's impossible.
[3:21] Jesus Christ is the only one. Amen. Who
[3:25] conquered it all. Death, hell, and the
[3:30] grave.
[3:32] And so we realize, amen, that we may see
[3:36] ourselves as
[3:39] conquerors, but the only reason why we
[3:42] are is because of his faith, not
[3:48] yours. Your faith couldn't even heal a
[3:52] toothache. But when his faith is in
[3:55] you, all things become possible.
[4:00] Now we look at this thing and you and I
[4:02] must be careful in this day. Uh because
[4:06] God has called us to a time when gold is
[4:09] to be tried in the fire.
[4:13] But you see there is a fool's
[4:16] goal. Something that looks really good.
[4:20] It
[4:22] shines perhaps better than true gold,
[4:26] but it's not the real thing. Amen. Amen.
[4:29] Now, according to the message, he that
[4:32] is in us, in you, the man goes on and
[4:36] say, he's just talking. He says, I
[4:38] climbed down in a mine the other day,
[4:42] way in the top of the mountains on the
[4:45] Arizona, Mexico line. Brother Saltman
[4:49] and I uh sitting there was up there
[4:52] together and I got in there and dug out
[4:55] a bunch of what it looked just exactly
[4:59] like gold. But the only way you could
[5:02] tell it isn't gold. It shines better
[5:05] than gold. It shines and gold does not
[5:10] shine. It
[5:12] glows. What is called is fool's gold.
[5:16] It's not even worth as much as the rock
[5:18] that is in is called iron
[5:22] pyite. You see, I think the scientists
[5:25] claim that the waters and the leaking
[5:28] ashes and things never got there quite
[5:32] enough to harden it and bring it into a
[5:36] place to make it gold. In other words, a
[5:39] man fool's gold had all the
[5:43] potentials of being gold, but it
[5:46] wouldn't go through the full process for
[5:49] whatever reason. It didn't go through
[5:51] the whole process that gold must go
[5:54] through in order for it to be gold.
[5:58] Hallelujah. It shines better, but it
[6:02] don't have the chemical in it.
[6:07] Amen. See, it doesn't have the chemical
[6:10] in it. Amen. It looks good. It looks
[6:12] like a Christian, but it doesn't have
[6:15] that chemical in it. Amen. And that
[6:18] chemical must be God.
[6:21] Right? And that's just the way a lot of
[6:24] Makebelie Christians is. See, it shines
[6:28] and it likes Hollywood, but the church
[6:31] glows with the gospel.
[6:35] Is that all right? Now, you and I must
[6:37] know that we have to go through tests
[6:39] and trials. Is that all right? And the
[6:43] worst thing that we can go through is
[6:45] anything that's going to deal with us
[6:47] flesh. Is that all right? Thank you,
[6:52] brother. Tests and
[6:55] trials are what we
[6:58] are built for.
[7:01] It is a thing that brings us into a
[7:04] place where the chemical can be added.
[7:09] Is that right? You see, I thought when I
[7:12] was first born of God and you know, I
[7:14] thought, praise God, it was all over.
[7:17] But I didn't know that I had to grow and
[7:19] mature. I didn't know that fiery trials,
[7:23] even though the Bible says, "Think it
[7:24] not strange when fiery trials come upon
[7:28] you." Why? What? Why is it coming? It is
[7:31] coming to these trials come to test you,
[7:34] to try you and to make sure you you you
[7:38] you are real. Go.
[7:42] And they say, "Think it not strange. Oh
[7:44] my God, what is happening to me?" Now
[7:46] the world the world consists of lust of
[7:51] the flesh, lust of the eye, the pride of
[7:54] life. But I want to take it to a another
[7:57] level. The world consists of
[8:01] everything basically that God
[8:05] [Music]
[8:06] created in this so-called
[8:09] cosmos. I mean in other words, amen. The
[8:12] world consists of of of all the uh uh
[8:17] elements, the wind, the rain, uh uh
[8:22] snow, whatever. uh you think about it
[8:25] the sun it it all consists of that uh
[8:29] and you I better uh you'll explain it in
[8:32] just a moment you see because without
[8:35] these heavenly elements I mean actually
[8:38] the world in itself uh could not operate
[8:40] the way it is or the way it does so it
[8:44] consists of all these things and I'll
[8:47] prove that in just a moment now we look
[8:51] at this thing and but the worst part of
[8:53] this whole thing is
[8:55] you brother said you are your greatest
[8:58] enemy. This not might not be a
[9:01] hallelujah shouting message but I pray
[9:04] that God would give you the
[9:05] understanding of what I'm trying to say
[9:07] to you this morning. Without God you'll
[9:11] never be a conqueror.
[9:16] Hallelujah. See, because we are looking
[9:19] at a time, amen, that we are we are are
[9:23] are are fighting fa we we haven't even
[9:26] overcome the flesh enough
[9:30] to work with all the other elements.
[9:34] Hallelujah. See, you know, once
[9:37] conquering
[9:39] self, you become as God.
[9:44] And this is why Paul writes, not that
[9:48] we're a
[9:50] conqueror. We're more than a conqueror.
[9:55] See, I'm not just a conqueror. I'm not
[9:58] just barely making it. I'm not just
[10:01] getting alone.
[10:03] Amen.
[10:04] But it's like a a a a compare a a
[10:08] airplane to a to a to a a
[10:12] a
[10:15] spaceship. There's no
[10:17] comparison. That's like putting a horse,
[10:20] you know, in a race with an
[10:24] automobile. It can't win that horse.
[10:27] Even though the automobile has
[10:30] horsepower, but it's got more horsepower
[10:33] than the
[10:35] horse. See? So you you you you look at
[10:38] this area that we're living in and and
[10:41] you see that the Christian are truly
[10:43] underprivileged Christians.
[10:49] That's what UPC stands
[10:53] for or children, however you want to put
[10:56] it. Amen. So don't belong to that
[11:00] organization. So you and I must realize
[11:02] by the grace of God that there's
[11:06] something that God is trying to get us
[11:09] to see. Now, Brother Brandon talks about
[11:12] the token, and I'm I'm almost jumping
[11:14] here, but you and I must realize without
[11:17] it, you're a failure.
[11:21] And the prophet of God goes on to say
[11:23] that you and I were born failures to
[11:27] begin with. But that's not the purpose
[11:31] for which we were born. We were not born
[11:35] to be failures. We were not born to be
[11:38] losers. We were not born to be quitters.
[11:41] We were born to be conquerors. More than
[11:45] conquerors.
[11:53] First of all, I'm working with self now,
[11:56] flesh to man. For all that is in the
[11:59] world, the lust of the flesh and the
[12:01] lust of the eyes, and the pride of life
[12:03] is not of the
[12:06] father, but of the
[12:08] world. 1 John 2:15, love not the world,
[12:13] neither the things that are in the
[12:14] world. If any man love the world, the
[12:18] love of the father is not in him.
[12:24] Back it up. All that is in the world, it
[12:28] starts off with what? The lust of the
[12:32] flesh. That doesn't mean, amen, that
[12:34] this lust has to be something sensual.
[12:39] But it could be
[12:40] anything that you allow your spirit or
[12:44] your soul man to cater to the flesh.
[12:46] This man rules you
[12:51] when this man's supposed to be dead.
[12:54] Love not the world. See, because in
[12:57] reality, Adam never had problems with
[13:00] his flesh till after he fell. The world
[13:04] wasn't a problem.
[13:06] Adam controlled the world, but after the
[13:09] fall, the world controlled
[13:12] Adam. Oh, come on, somebody.
[13:15] Can we not see where God is trying to
[13:18] take us beyond the flesh
[13:22] into a perfect man?
[13:26] Now, the ultimate goal of a Christian
[13:30] ought to be that the soul prosper, not
[13:35] the flesh. Amen. Oh, I've got to be in
[13:37] this and I've got to be this and I've
[13:38] got to be that and I've got to have
[13:40] this. That ain't it.
[13:42] The sole purpose is that your soul
[13:46] prosper. Now, I say this by the grace of
[13:50] God that you might
[13:51] understand what it means. Add to your
[13:55] faith virtue.
[13:57] That That's your soul prospering. Amen.
[14:01] Amen. Knowledge, temperance. And that's
[14:04] what Peter said, right? Amen. This is
[14:06] your soul prospering. Amen. Right. And
[14:10] he said, "As your soul prosper, I pray
[14:13] that you prosper as well."
[14:16] See, God don't forget about you, but
[14:18] he's what he's doing, he's trying to get
[14:20] us to put things in priority. Amen. Put
[14:25] the spiritual things first. Seek ye
[14:27] first the kingdom of God and his
[14:30] righteousness and all these things will
[14:33] be added. Amen.
[14:36] Soul prospering. Amen. Add to me
[14:39] temperance, Lord. Amen. Add to me these
[14:43] virtues, Lord. You see, can you add
[14:45] them?
[14:47] Only God can do this.
[14:49] So, looking, let's move on.
[14:53] Because I want you to understand prosper
[14:55] in such a way that God have supreme
[15:00] authority within
[15:03] you. You don't even have a say so
[15:07] but that God would have supreme
[15:10] authority. You'll never be able to
[15:12] conquer the world until you allow the
[15:14] Holy Spirit to conquer you. Amen.
[15:19] Huh?
[15:20] You'll never be able to conquer the
[15:23] world until
[15:25] God conquers you. And you must allow him
[15:29] to conquer you.
[15:31] You say, "Well, what do you mean?" It
[15:33] must be a willing sacrifice.
[15:37] God ain't going to beg you. He ain't
[15:39] going to beat you. It must be your will.
[15:43] Amen.
[15:44] Surrendered to his will. Is that the
[15:46] scripture? Amen. Jesus could have ran
[15:49] from the
[15:51] garden, right? But he said, "Lord, not
[15:55] my will." See, thy will be done. Now,
[15:59] I'm telling you is in your mind. The
[16:02] only reason why we're not more than a
[16:04] conqueror right now is because we have
[16:07] been hindered by the thoughts
[16:10] that are in our minds.
[16:16] Bible says, "Stand fast, therefore in
[16:18] the liberty wherewith God hath made us
[16:21] free and be not entangled again with the
[16:25] yoke of bondage." Huh? That means it's
[16:29] possible that a Christian can be
[16:33] entangled with the yoke of bondage.
[16:37] Oh, come on, somebody. It's the truth.
[16:40] You can allow the world to conquer
[16:48] you, but that's not God's will. Now,
[16:51] this perfect will, God's perfect will is
[16:54] that we be successful in this thing.
[16:58] Come on, somebody. Hallelujah. If you're
[17:00] successful with God, he'll give you
[17:02] anything you desire.
[17:04] That's the word. The Bible says, Amen.
[17:07] that he'll give you the desires of your
[17:10] heart. Amen.
[17:12] Oh, come on, somebody. Now, the one
[17:16] thing that God do not like is lazy
[17:19] Christians.
[17:22] Yeah. I figure I'll throw this one in on
[17:25] you because we have to fight the spirit
[17:28] of laziness. All of us. Hello. All this
[17:33] is Leo. All we have to all fight lazy
[17:38] spirits.
[17:40] Listen what brother says. Amen to Billy
[17:49] Paul. He said at the end of our days as
[17:52] he raised from the dead so will we also
[17:54] who are in him. I can't get my boy up at
[17:59] mornings. He looked like he just got his
[18:02] day and night turned around. I said,
[18:04] "Billip, you'll never be no account
[18:07] laying there like that. Get up. If you
[18:10] do not more than go out and wash your
[18:13] teeth and go out in the yard, look at
[18:17] your car, and come back and sat down and
[18:20] read. Don't lay in the bed. No good
[18:26] laziness."
[18:29] Amen.
[18:30] God have mercy on the lazyarted
[18:32] Christians become no good. Know so much
[18:37] about it and tell so little to other
[18:39] people about it.
[18:42] Amen. Know so much about it and tell so
[18:45] little to other people about it. That's
[18:47] a lazy Christian.
[18:50] He said, "Daddy, I just can't get up
[18:53] early." I said, "Look, Billy, one of
[18:55] these days, you ain't going to have no
[18:57] daddy to take care of you. Daddy's going
[19:00] to be gone one of these mornings. You
[19:03] come in the room and look, perhaps, and
[19:05] daddy will be laying there, and you'll
[19:06] shake him, but he won't wake." I said,
[19:10] "Then they'll haul me down this little
[19:13] old church in the box. You'll pass by
[19:15] and your handkerchief in your hand,
[19:17] crying, looking."
[19:21] Amen. God have mercy.
[19:28] Come on, somebody. You can't depend on
[19:30] mom and daddy now. Amen. Uh-uh. No, it
[19:33] ain't going to work. Mm- looking down
[19:36] saying, "That's my old daddy. I wish I
[19:38] had listened to him." I said, "But
[19:41] remember, this is the punch. This is the
[19:43] punch." He said, "But remember, Billy,
[19:46] I've always been a early riser."
[19:49] Hallelujah. Blessed trumpet sounds. I
[19:54] will come forth in the first
[19:55] resurrection. I believe in rising early.
[19:59] Hallelujah. Some glorious day by the
[20:02] grace of God. I believe this gospel that
[20:05] I preach. I believe is honest true. Now
[20:09] what is he saying? He's basically saying
[20:11] that the resurrection that happened in
[20:13] the early morning.
[20:16] What happens if you're being lazy?
[20:21] He gets and he says Elijah's robe don't
[20:25] have an uncertain sound.
[20:29] Is that all right? That's in the message
[20:32] uncertain sound. Now, Revelations 3:21,
[20:35] let us turn there. I hope you don't mind
[20:37] me taking my time this morning. I really
[20:39] want to make it clear to you this
[20:40] morning by the grace of God. Amen. That
[20:43] the only way you'll be more than a
[20:45] conqueror, you've got to have the
[20:48] conqueror on the inside. Amen. It ain't
[20:50] you. It ain't me. It's the conqueror.
[20:53] And the point is, I was thinking about
[20:55] this. I said, Lord, how often time we
[20:58] get down on our knees and don't pray
[21:00] through or pray up. Y'all hear what I'm
[21:04] saying? Listen, he said, brother said,
[21:07] listen, when you got to pray until
[21:10] something changed and you'll know the
[21:13] change,
[21:16] huh? What you how virtues and knowledge
[21:19] and tempers and longsuffering, all these
[21:21] things, how are they going to be in you
[21:24] when each one of these things are
[21:25] victories? God just don't drop them in
[21:28] your lap. You've got to fight for it.
[21:36] Traumatized. Trauma. Trauma. Ask a baby
[21:39] if he could talk when he first born what
[21:41] he felt like when he was coming through
[21:42] that ch uh
[21:45] channel. Huh? Ask a baby when his head
[21:49] is squeezed out of
[21:51] shape. Huh? He doesn't give
[21:55] up. He keep pushing. And that's how a
[21:59] true believer is. We're pressing into
[22:02] another realm. We're pressing into
[22:04] another world. And you got to keep
[22:06] pushing. I don't care if it feels like
[22:08] you're about to go crazy. It feels like
[22:11] the pressure is everywhere. But you got
[22:14] to keep pushing.
[22:16] That's it. Amen.
[22:20] You know you can't stay here. Amen. That
[22:23] baby know you can't stay in that womb.
[22:28] You know you can't stay here.
[22:31] What are you going to
[22:32] do? You got to become more than a
[22:35] conqueror.
[22:36] We can't just be going on like we barely
[22:39] making it. Oh God, I I don't know and
[22:41] this and that.
[22:43] That's the tune Satan want you to sing
[22:45] and that's the music he's been playing.
[22:48] Hallelujah. But God is saying, "Wake
[22:50] up." Hallelujah. Dust yourself from the
[22:52] dust, Zion. Amen. This is a new day.
[22:56] You know what do I think about this? God
[22:59] have confidence in all of us. That's why
[23:02] he chose us.
[23:04] He don't care about your failures. He
[23:06] want to see victories.
[23:09] Right,
[23:10] Samson? Amen. Come on, somebody. Samson
[23:14] was a failure after one thing, after
[23:17] what? The lust of the flesh got him.
[23:20] Beautiful women. Whatever your problem
[23:23] is. But it was at the end that Samson
[23:26] realized his purpose. We're at the end
[23:29] of this thing. Somehow we must realize
[23:32] what our purpose is.
[23:35] Our purpose is to declare that Jesus
[23:37] Christ is the same yesterday, today, and
[23:40] forever. and that he's living in you and
[23:43] you and you and you and you and me. The
[23:46] world must see
[23:52] this. Him that overcometh will I grant
[23:54] to sit with me in my throne even as I
[23:58] also
[23:59] overcame. Oh, come on. Come on. Come on.
[24:02] Amen. You say overcome. Like I said,
[24:04] self is your biggest enemy. You you
[24:07] you the overcomer. You overcome. Amen.
[24:11] By the grace of God.
[24:13] It goes on and says Revelation 21:7, "He
[24:16] that overcometh shall inherit all
[24:18] things, and I will be his God, and he
[24:20] shall be my son." Now, what do you mean?
[24:23] I'm saying overcome the world, you
[24:25] inherit all things. The moon, the sun,
[24:30] the stars. Amen. All things. Hallelujah.
[24:35] Whatever constellation that's out there
[24:38] is yours. Amen. Is that right? And
[24:40] you've heard me say this before. Brother
[24:42] Bam said, "You can live so close to God,
[24:44] he'll take you places." Hallelujah. If
[24:47] there are other places that he can take
[24:50] me, I want to go. Amen.
[24:55] Oh, no, no, no. I'm more than a
[24:57] conqueror. Romans says 8:37, they in all
[25:00] things we are more than conquerors. How?
[25:04] Through him. Through him that's trying
[25:07] us. No sir. Through him that loved us is
[25:12] already fixed. He's already loved us.
[25:15] He'll never change his mind about loving
[25:18] us.
[25:22] Hallelujah. But we must come to that
[25:24] place where we can say like St. John
[25:27] 10:30, I and my father are
[25:32] one. Come on, somebody. You say, "Well,
[25:35] what do you mean that Holy Ghost living
[25:36] on the inside of you?" Amen. And you
[25:39] know it, right? You're dead to yourself.
[25:42] That's the only way he's coming. You're
[25:44] dead to yourself. And he comes to occupy
[25:47] you.
[25:52] St. John 17:22. I hope y'all don't mind
[25:54] this. And the glory which thou gavest
[25:58] me, I have given them, that they may be
[26:02] one, even as we are one. See, that's
[26:05] what makes you more than a conqueror.
[26:07] Oh, come on, somebody. Amen. I love this
[26:10] this morning. He said, "As it is
[26:13] written, you going to suffer."
[26:16] Amen. Hallelujah. There's no way out of
[26:19] it. Oh, God. You thought you was invited
[26:21] to a picnic or something. This is a war.
[26:24] Amen.
[26:25] Right now you are engaging in a war
[26:28] between Mount Zion
[26:31] and the world
[26:34] as it is written for thy sake we are
[26:37] killed all the day long we are counted
[26:40] as sheep for the slaughter nay in all
[26:43] these things we are more than conquerors
[26:46] through him that love us it may look
[26:48] like I'm a failure at times but I'm more
[26:51] than a conqueror hallelujah I I get sick
[26:55] in my body, but I'm still more than a
[26:58] conqueror. Why? Because greater is he
[27:02] that is in me than he that is in the
[27:04] world.
[27:06] Oh yes, I'm
[27:09] persuaded. I'm persuaded. You know what
[27:12] it means? I'm convinced. There's no
[27:15] doubt in me. Amen. I'm convinced.
[27:18] Amen. Amen. Neither death nor life nor
[27:23] angels nor
[27:25] principalities nor powers nor things
[27:28] presence nor things to come. Come on
[27:32] somebody look at Sam. He was betrayed by
[27:36] delight but it worked in his favor.
[27:40] Hallelujah. When the devil comes and he
[27:42] puts you in a trap, God will always work
[27:45] it in your favor. Amen. Amen.
[27:51] Always that same trap led him to his
[27:55] purpose. And sometimes you think the
[27:58] devil is getting the best of you and you
[28:00] fail to see is moving you into your
[28:02] purpose.
[28:05] Hallelujah. He's moving you into your
[28:07] purpose.
[28:09] God ain't
[28:12] stupid. He knows what he's doing.
[28:15] Hallelujah. But you got to trust him
[28:17] with all your heart. Hallelujah. Lean
[28:19] not to your own understanding. You must
[28:22] trust him with all your heart.
[28:25] Hallelujah.
[28:27] Ain't God good? Oh, think about a
[28:30] people. Amen. Nor height, nor depth, nor
[28:33] any other creature shall be able to
[28:35] separate us from the love of God which
[28:37] is in Christ Jesus our Lord. What?
[28:39] Nothing. Paul says nothing. Nothing this
[28:42] world can present.
[28:46] You say, "Well, what do you mean,
[28:47] brothers?" I'm going to tell you
[28:48] something. When those Old Testament
[28:50] saints was lo when they died, they
[28:53] didn't go straight to heaven. They went
[28:54] to paradise.
[28:56] Come on, somebody. They didn't have the
[28:58] real sacrifice.
[29:00] But God loved them.
[29:03] Hallelujah. God loved them. And when the
[29:06] true sacrifice came, what did God do? I
[29:10] must go by paradise. I must swing by
[29:12] there and lock the doors and take them
[29:15] up higher. Hallelujah. Come on,
[29:18] somebody. And you got the real thing.
[29:20] You got the real thing.
[29:23] What are you talking about? You look at
[29:25] this thing, you say, "Well, brother,
[29:27] listen. When you more than a conqueror,
[29:29] you a conqueror, you're sitting in
[29:30] heavenly places." Amen.
[29:34] Oh, I got to break it down now. Let me
[29:36] say it like this. God is obvious to
[29:39] those who can
[29:41] see. Huh? Come on, somebody. God has
[29:44] always been in your life and you didn't
[29:46] know
[29:47] it. Come on, somebody. He created you.
[29:51] He was the one that took that those
[29:52] germs and that egg and put it together.
[29:54] He's the one that called you by name.
[29:57] Come on, somebody. You didn't know him,
[29:59] but the Bible said he formed, he
[30:01] fashioned you. Even when you was in your
[30:03] mother's womb, you still didn't know
[30:05] him, but he loved you anyhow.
[30:08] Hallelujah. Even in the times when you
[30:11] were going through trials and tests, out
[30:13] there as a sinner, bullets flying over
[30:15] your head, he still loved you. He was in
[30:19] your life and you didn't even know it.
[30:21] Amen. Amen. See, I know what I'm talking
[30:24] about. Thank you, Lord. I've had to run
[30:26] from bullets. However I escape, God
[30:28] knows. Amen. But God, let me put it this
[30:31] way. Amen. He was loving me even when I
[30:33] didn't even know it. And now that I know
[30:36] him, hallelujah.
[30:38] Oh my God. See, he's obvious. He said,
[30:41] "Even nature declare of me." You don't
[30:43] have to look far. He said, "If you want
[30:45] to know me," he said, "I'm neither even
[30:47] in your mouth." Hallelujah. Come on,
[30:49] somebody.
[30:52] I was thinking about this the other day
[30:53] and I says, "Lord, it's amazing." You
[30:55] know, and I I think I might have voice
[30:57] it here somewhere. I talked about my
[30:58] children and my grandchildren and all of
[31:00] that. And I got so excited. Amen.
[31:02] Something made me feel like something
[31:04] eternal. And I thought, "That's it." I
[31:07] said, "I can never die as long as
[31:08] they're
[31:10] living." There's always a part of me
[31:14] living. Hallelujah. A lot. That's how it
[31:17] is with God. He's eternal. Amen. And you
[31:20] he you'll never die. Amen. Cuz a part of
[31:24] him is in you.
[31:26] Woo. Come on, somebody. You had
[31:28] representation and didn't even know it.
[31:30] You should have been dead long time ago.
[31:33] And your representation was the thing
[31:34] that kept you. Amen. Hallelujah. Come
[31:37] on, somebody. It's nothing but the
[31:39] truth. The Bible tells us, Amen. The
[31:42] world is not even worthy of us. Yes. And
[31:45] the devil saying, "You ain't worthy of
[31:46] the world." Hallelujah. I might be poor.
[31:50] I might be destitute. And at the end of
[31:52] the road, I might have to live in
[31:53] somebody's cave. Hallelujah. But still,
[31:56] I'm more than a conqueror. Hallelujah.
[31:59] Why? Because when you conquer this
[32:01] world, you've conquered everything Satan
[32:04] designed. Amen. Amen.
[32:09] Everything. Everything. Is that all
[32:11] right? The world is not worthy. They
[32:14] wandered in deserts and mountains and
[32:16] dens and caves. You know, they probably
[32:18] say those old pitiful little Christians,
[32:19] you know, they ain't got much. And look
[32:21] at them. They look so bad and horrible.
[32:23] I wonder what they said about uh uh uh
[32:26] Lazarus when he was laying at the rich
[32:28] man table. They probably looked at him
[32:29] and wagged their heads at him and felt
[32:31] so sorry for. Hallelujah. But what they
[32:34] didn't realize, Amen. Amen. That Lazarus
[32:36] was laying there, but he was more than a
[32:38] conqueror. It looked like Satan was
[32:40] getting the best. It looked like death
[32:42] got the best of him. But when he died,
[32:45] the Bible said he was in the bosom of
[32:47] Abraham. Hallelujah. It doesn't matter.
[32:51] Amen. How it looks what you're in
[32:54] this world. Look at Brother Brandon died
[32:56] in a car accident. looked like, amen, he
[32:59] was finished. All kinds of lies went
[33:02] after him and said basically, amen, God
[33:04] punished
[33:06] him. Hallelujah. But what they didn't
[33:09] understand, the Elijah had to decrease.
[33:12] Hallelujah. So Jesus Christ couldn't
[33:15] increase. He saw it death before it ever
[33:18] came.
[33:19] [Music]
[33:21] Hallelujah. Come on, somebody. But what
[33:24] was it? He had surrendered his life. You
[33:27] you say, "Well, brother B, let me tell
[33:28] you how simple the test is." Brother
[33:30] Brandham talks about how that he and his
[33:32] brothers were up in the mountains and
[33:34] they were up there hunting and things
[33:36] like that and a big snowstorm was
[33:38] coming. A big snowstorm was coming.
[33:42] Y'all remember that? Amen. And brother
[33:44] Brandham talks about it. He said, you
[33:46] know, for years he said, I prayed there
[33:48] were burden on his life and he didn't
[33:50] know what the burden was. He said, but
[33:53] there was times that some of his
[33:54] brethren would ask him, "Go kill me
[33:56] this. I want a moose. I want a this. I
[33:58] want a that and I want." And he said
[33:59] he'd go out there hunting and he'll
[34:01] bring them things
[34:02] back. But he start feeling bad about it
[34:05] and he promised God he'll never do it
[34:07] again. He said he searched himself.
[34:09] Lord, have I offended someone? I
[34:11] thought, Lord, how often do we do that?
[34:13] Have I offended anyone? Did anyone did I
[34:16] say the wrong thing? Did I act the wrong
[34:17] thing? Lord, show me what I make it
[34:20] right. That's the point. I'll make it
[34:23] right. Oh my god. He said all of a
[34:26] sudden the storm they heard on the radio
[34:28] this week's blizzard was coming and he
[34:30] encouraged the brothers to leave and
[34:31] stuff like that. But anyway, y'all know
[34:33] the story, those of us who listen to the
[34:35] message. Amen. We find out by the grace
[34:38] of God, he comes and all of a sudden the
[34:40] storm the the the the slee and
[34:42] everything is falling and it's and and
[34:44] everything. He had a little wimpy
[34:46] sandwich that had gotten wet by the rain
[34:47] and all of that. He thought he'd eat
[34:49] that. Then he heard a
[34:52] voice say turn
[34:54] around. Now it didn't mean run from the
[34:58] storm. It mean meant turn. That's that.
[35:03] In other words, brother Brandham, in
[35:05] this age, the bride will not run from
[35:08] the storm. She's got to turn into the
[35:12] storm. Amen. Come on. She walks into the
[35:16] storm even though she realize it will
[35:18] cost her her life. Maybe.
[35:24] He said, "Lord, I might die. This might
[35:26] be my end, but nevertheless, I'm going
[35:29] to do what you say do." Amen.
[35:32] Come on, somebody. Oh my my
[35:37] my listen. He goes on now and he talks
[35:40] about how the Lord spoke to him and told
[35:42] him to speak to the storm. He began to
[35:45] speak to the storm. The storm
[35:47] disappeared. Now you think this is
[35:49] glorious. This is glorious. But this is
[35:50] the this is the big part. If you read
[35:52] that story, you think, "Wow, he spoke to
[35:54] the storm. The storm disappeared. He He
[35:57] had proof that it was coming. People saw
[35:59] that it started. It stopped. What a
[36:02] mighty
[36:03] God." Brother Adam goes on to tell you,
[36:06] he said, "I didn't do
[36:07] that." He said, "But it was the God in
[36:10] me." You hear what I'm saying? It wasn't
[36:12] human flesh that spoke to the storm.
[36:17] But let me read this. I done took you to
[36:18] where I want you to want to take you.
[36:20] And he goes on and talks about those
[36:22] things now. And he goes on, he says,
[36:25] "And I sat down there and I just put my
[36:27] coat on like this or my shirt over the
[36:30] scope again, sat down and I thought,
[36:32] what am I doing here? Why would I come
[36:34] back up here?" And I just waited a few
[36:37] minutes. And I started to get up again
[36:39] and I just as plain as I ever wanted to
[36:41] hear a voice say, "I am the creator of
[36:45] heaven and
[36:47] earth. I make the wind and the rain."
[36:51] Come on. Amen. Am I the only one that's
[36:54] that's shooting past Mars right now?
[36:59] Listen what he says. He said, "I am."
[37:01] And you got to understand, he's saying,
[37:03] "But I'm in you. I created all of this."
[37:06] You got See, your mind is blocking you.
[37:08] You can't just stop with the bird brain.
[37:11] You can't comprehend this with your
[37:13] head. It must be comprehended by your
[37:15] heart. Faith must enter into you right
[37:18] now in order for you to understand what
[37:20] he's saying. Listen, he goes on to say,
[37:26] listen, I I'm I'm I'm probably too
[37:29] excited. I am the creator of heaven and
[37:30] earth. I made the wind and the rain. I
[37:33] took off my head and I said, "Great
[37:35] Jehovah, is that you?" He said, "I was
[37:38] the one who made the wind to cease upon
[37:41] the sea. I was the one who made the
[37:44] waves to go down. I created heaven and
[37:47] earth. Was not I not the one that told
[37:51] you to speak to those uh uh those uh for
[37:54] the squirrels and they came into
[37:57] existence? I am God. Now when I that
[38:00] when a voice speak to you, watch the
[38:03] scriptures. If it's not scripture, you
[38:06] leave it alone. I don't care how plain
[38:08] it is. You stay away from it. I said,
[38:11] "Yes, Lord." what he said. Speak to
[38:13] those winds and that storm and it'll
[38:15] give a go
[38:17] away. Now this Bible lay before me which
[38:20] my life in that I raised up and I said I
[38:22] do not doubt your voice Lord. I said
[38:25] clouds, snow, rain, sleep, I resent your
[38:29] coming
[38:33] in the name of Jesus Christ. Go to your
[38:36] places. I say that the sun must come out
[38:39] immediately and shine for 4 days till
[38:43] I'm hunting trip is over and I leave
[38:46] with my brethren. Now listen what he
[38:49] stopped the storm so that he could
[38:51] complete his hunting
[38:53] trip. God didn't tell him nothing about
[38:55] the hunting trip. God told him to speak
[38:58] to the storm. But he included
[39:03] Hallelujah. Y'all think I'm crazy, but
[39:06] I'm going to tell you something. Brother
[39:08] Connelly, y'all don't mind. Let me pause
[39:10] here. Brother Connelly normally uh helps
[39:13] me with my
[39:15] snowblower. Well, we last last year, I
[39:18] forgot to get it cleaned out. Y'all
[39:19] remember how it was how it was
[39:21] when y'all cleaned it the last time?
[39:22] Well, I had done already tried it early
[39:24] in the year and I says, "Lord," I said,
[39:25] "If ever I needed my snow glories now."
[39:28] I said that's more snow than we've had
[39:29] in a long time and I can't operate this
[39:31] thing and I'm not going to bother
[39:32] brother
[39:33] Con. Amen. I went in there and I got I
[39:36] said oh I said you going to
[39:38] start. See sometime you got to talk to
[39:40] things like they're human. You going to
[39:43] start. Now I had done read I went on the
[39:46] internet and I read where they said you
[39:48] know if you got any kind of machine and
[39:50] such and you don't clean it out and it's
[39:52] got this corn stuff in it it's going to
[39:54] clog up and this and that. I done read
[39:56] all of that just the other day. So in my
[39:58] mind, I'm thinking it's probably like
[39:59] syrup or manasses in there and it ain't
[40:02] going to
[40:03] start. And I thought, "No." I said to
[40:06] God, I said, "Lord, if you can say I can
[40:08] move a mountain, surely I can move this
[40:10] this machine." Hallelujah. I gave it a
[40:14] little juice, juice, juice three times.
[40:16] It wouldn't work. It just
[40:18] smoke. But that was evidence. That was
[40:22] some evidence. Amen. It was some
[40:24] evidence. this thing going to start. And
[40:26] then so anyway, I got to this thing and
[40:28] I thought, "Oh, Lord," I said, and I I
[40:30] was out there shoveling all that stone
[40:31] with my I didn't mind cuz I needed to
[40:33] exercise anyhow. And I thought, Lord, I
[40:35] said, "But when I finish, I'm going to
[40:37] cut this thing on even if I'm just going
[40:39] to let it run till it's
[40:42] clean." I went in there and something
[40:45] says seven is completion. Give it some
[40:48] juice. You know how you give it the
[40:49] little juice? Seven times. I went 1 2 3
[40:51] 4 5 6 7 boom. It didn't happen. Some say
[40:54] three is perfection. So I had to do it
[40:56] three times. Three * 7 21. Come on
[40:59] somebody. Amen. And that third time I
[41:02] hit the seven. That thing
[41:05] said, it worked. Then I thought, why
[41:08] should I finish this thing with my
[41:10] shovel? I got the rest that machinery. I
[41:13] went listen. I felt so good. I did my
[41:15] neighbors
[41:17] yard. Hallelujah.
[41:20] I said, God, you're real. But watch
[41:22] this. Now, in my working, it was I was
[41:25] sweating and and it got so hot. I had my
[41:27] my glasses on the on on top of the hood
[41:30] and I'm driving off. Amen. Cuz you know,
[41:33] I'm going off for the moment and my
[41:35] glasses on top of the the the hood. Uh
[41:37] you know, and and and something say
[41:39] drive slow. And I didn't know why. I was
[41:41] and I thought, well, yeah, that's right.
[41:42] Where are my glasses? So, I'm on my way
[41:44] and here's a guy, y'all know my little
[41:47] circle. Here's a guy standing I'm not,
[41:49] you know, in his truck. He's looking at
[41:51] my glasses. Now, how he saw my glasses
[41:53] on the hood, I don't have no idea, but
[41:56] he follows me to my house. He said,
[41:57] "Sir," he said, "you glasses are up on
[42:01] top." I said, "Thank you." I knew
[42:04] something was going on wrong here. But
[42:05] anyway, they could have slid in the
[42:08] street. I mean, they could have been
[42:09] torn
[42:10] up. So, I thanked him. I says, "Now,
[42:12] God," I said, "Some people may not
[42:14] believe this, but I'mma praise him for
[42:15] this anyway." I said, "Cuz you worthy to
[42:17] be praised." Amen. Amen. You have no
[42:20] idea what that did for me yesterday.
[42:25] Huh? It made me know that this message
[42:28] I'm preaching is right on course. Amen.
[42:31] The same God that stopped the wind was
[42:33] the same God that started my snowblower.
[42:36] Amen.
[42:41] Hallelujah.
[42:43] Now I'm feeling pretty good folk. Amen.
[42:47] Now I'm welcome to this thing. And he
[42:49] says, "Listen." And he said, "Listen."
[42:51] As I spoke, he said, "I do not doubt
[42:53] your voice, Lord." I said, "Cloud, snow,
[42:56] rain, sleep." What? He said, "I do not
[42:58] doubt your voice, Lord."
[43:02] That same God that talked to William
[43:04] Brandham is still talking to his
[43:05] children. Amen. Amen. Come on, somebody.
[43:09] Still talking.
[43:13] Hallelujah. Come on, somebody. Now, you
[43:15] look at this. He said, "Listen, in the
[43:17] name of Jesus Christ, go to your place.
[43:20] I say that the sun must come out
[43:21] immediately and shine for 4 days till
[43:23] the hunting trip is over and I leave
[43:24] with my brethren." I was just gushing.
[43:27] Uh it was it was just gushing. Just
[43:30] going whoosh like that and it started
[43:33] going whoosh and then woo, you know,
[43:36] stop. I looked I stood real still. My
[43:39] brethren up there wondering what was
[43:42] happening and the sleet and the rain
[43:44] stopped. There came a wind whirling down
[43:46] through the mountain. Lifted up the
[43:47] clouds. One went this way, east, north,
[43:50] west, and south. And within a few
[43:52] minutes, the sun was shining nice and
[43:54] warm. That's true. Now, that's God. See,
[43:58] I picked up my gun, wiped off the scope,
[44:01] started walking back to down to the
[44:03] hill. Amen. Now, there's a lot to this,
[44:05] but I wanted to get to this one
[44:07] place because I want you to understand.
[44:10] Amen. Now he's gone and he's going to
[44:12] find out that other people saw it coming
[44:13] and things like that. Now the whole
[44:16] point behind this was this. He was
[44:18] feeling this heavy burden. And whenever
[44:20] you got a burden and you can't get rid
[44:21] of it, there's something God is trying
[44:23] to get over to you. Amen. When you done
[44:25] tried every door, you done sorted. You
[44:27] done sought God. There's something he's
[44:29] trying to minister to you. So what
[44:31] happened is he says, "Listen, as he was
[44:34] out there, here come these
[44:36] three
[44:40] deer." And he said they were no long no
[44:42] farther than 30
[44:44] ft. He said in 3 seconds I could have
[44:47] got all three of them. I'm going, "Wow,
[44:49] that's pretty
[44:51] fast." He said, "But there was something
[44:53] that made me know." He said, "I can't do
[44:55] that." Now when you make God a promise,
[44:58] he going to test you on that.
[45:01] Hello somebody. Hello. He said, "I can't
[45:04] do that. I promise God." Even though he
[45:06] had promised those brothers he'd get
[45:08] them. He says, "No, I can't do it." He
[45:10] said, "And then this the deer walked
[45:13] closer." Ain't that like the devil? The
[45:15] whole time walk up even closer now and
[45:17] said, "And and and the whole time,
[45:19] Brother Brandon think to himself, you
[45:20] can't get away even if you try. I know
[45:22] that." He said, "But go ahead on deer
[45:24] and and enjoy your life." He said, "And
[45:27] when those deer went into the room uh in
[45:30] the woods, he said all of a sudden the
[45:33] voice of God came to him and said, "You
[45:35] remembered your
[45:36] promise." Think about it. God sets you
[45:41] up to see whether you're able because
[45:43] you got to be like him. If he's a
[45:46] promisekeeper, you must be one, too.
[45:50] God keeps all his promises. And if you
[45:53] going to make a promise, keep it because
[45:55] that's how your father is. Amen.
[45:59] Oh, come on. Y'all got quiet on that
[46:02] one, but it's true. He said, "Because
[46:04] you kept your promise, I will keep
[46:11] mine."
[46:15] Listen. Great is he that is in you. I
[46:17] hope I'm not going too long because I
[46:19] want you to realize, Amen. In order to
[46:21] be, as I'm going to say this again, more
[46:23] than a conquered folks, religion ain't
[46:25] going to get it. You got to have a true
[46:27] born again experience, you got to have
[46:29] God on the inside of you. So much so,
[46:31] Amen. He's supreme. You're not even you
[46:34] just a shell. You just Anybody in here
[46:36] working toward that? Come on, somebody.
[46:38] That's what we want. Yeah. What good is
[46:40] it? If you got all of this and not God,
[46:44] it means nothing. It's going to perish.
[46:47] You know that's what that's what Solomon
[46:48] you know if you want some sense if you
[46:50] want to understand life read the songs
[46:52] of Solomon and go to the end of it and
[46:55] see what he come concludes with this is
[46:58] the conclusion of the
[46:59] matter fear God and keep his
[47:03] commandments
[47:04] everything else is
[47:06] vanity everything else is going to fail
[47:09] you everything else is going to pass
[47:14] away think about it all Those demons
[47:17] that rule your life, when you die, you
[47:19] know what they're going to do? Go to
[47:20] somebody else. They're not going to be
[47:24] faithful. But one thing about God is
[47:26] when you die, he goes with you.
[47:29] Come on. The Bible said, "Amen. The
[47:31] spirit of God rested on the bones of
[47:33] Elijah." Quicken in power. Hallelujah.
[47:37] I'll go wherever. This is what he said.
[47:39] He said, "Lo, I'll never forsake you.
[47:41] I'll never leave you. I will always be
[47:43] with you." That's even when you go down,
[47:47] he goes with
[47:49] you. Thank God because that's the only
[47:51] way we get
[47:52] up. Amen. He said, "Greater." He said,
[47:56] "Listen, he that is you is greater than
[47:58] he that is in the world." We can't
[48:00] understand that yet we say we believe it
[48:04] and we know it's true, but we really
[48:07] don't understand
[48:09] it. Greater is he that is in you than he
[48:11] that is in the world. What is it in you
[48:13] that's greater? It's Christ, the
[48:16] anointed. God that was in Christ is in
[48:19] you. And greater is he that is in you
[48:22] than he that is in the world. Oh, come
[48:24] on, somebody. Let put it this way.
[48:27] Greater is he that was in Joshua than
[48:31] the son. Amen.
[48:36] Greater is he that was in David. Amen.
[48:44] Huh? than Goliath.
[48:48] Oh, let me bring it to your day. Greater
[48:50] is he that is in you, Amen.
[48:55] than the squeeze. Amen. Greater is he
[48:58] that is in you than the World Council of
[49:02] Churches, Greater is he that is in you
[49:06] than any atomic bomb.
[49:12] See, when you got him in there, you got
[49:15] the creator of all things.
[49:20] Is that right? It's not you thinking and
[49:23] what you think about this. It's what he
[49:27] says about it. See, it ain't what you
[49:29] thinking. It's what he says about it.
[49:32] Right? Then if he is in you, he's
[49:35] absolutely would not deny what he said.
[49:39] If he's in you, he's in you. How he's
[49:42] going to deny what he said? Say to this
[49:45] mountain be thou move and it has to be
[49:47] moved. Huh? Whatsoever a man desire and
[49:50] believe in his heart, ask and believe in
[49:52] his heart, he shall receive it. Is that
[49:55] the word?
[49:56] If you delight yourself in the Lord, he
[49:58] said, I give you the desires of your
[50:00] heart. Why? Because he knows you're not
[50:03] going to ask for the wrong thing. And he
[50:05] knows you're not going to ask to consume
[50:07] it upon your own lust.
[50:10] We got situations. It's true. Let me let
[50:13] me put it this way. It's It's like It's
[50:15] like Samson and Delilah. Amen. You got a
[50:18] choice. Samson was unequally yolked with
[50:20] his
[50:21] wife. Come on. You going to either
[50:23] change her or she going to change
[50:26] you. Come on, somebody. Is that the
[50:29] word? Oh, y'all done got crazy. Amen.
[50:32] You know, what I mean got quiet. I
[50:35] didn't mean to say crazy. But my point
[50:38] my point is that you and I must
[50:41] recognize, Amen, that we
[50:45] are God's representation.
[50:50] The bride of Jesus
[50:53] Christ, I put it, Jesus is the fullness
[50:56] of the Godhead bodily. Amen.
[51:00] And the bride is the fullness of Jesus.
[51:04] There's no other way.
[51:06] You and I must recognize and listen like
[51:08] I tell you as long as your mind is your
[51:11] mind you'll go nowhere. Amen. That's why
[51:14] he said let this mind be in you that was
[51:17] also in Christ Jesus. Your mind is your
[51:20] hindrance. You've got to get in prayer.
[51:22] You got to die to your mind because your
[51:25] mind will make you schizophrenic. Your
[51:28] mind will make you doubleminded. Your
[51:30] mind will make you unbeliever. Your mind
[51:33] will make you fearful. Your mind will
[51:35] make you scared. Your mind will make you
[51:38] feel like a loser.
[51:41] Your mind. But in God's mind, the mind
[51:46] of God, Jesus said, "I and the father
[51:49] are one." He spoke that. When you see
[51:52] me, you see the father. Hallelujah. He
[51:55] spoke that. Amen. It was
[51:58] reality because he thought like God.
[52:03] When you go on your jobs, you think like
[52:05] God.
[52:07] Come on. When you go to the grocery
[52:08] store, you think like God. Come on,
[52:11] somebody. And understand the devil is
[52:13] always going to target you. He might not
[52:15] target nobody else in that store, but
[52:17] when he when you comes in, light comes
[52:19] in a dark room. He recognize you by the
[52:21] light, and you don't even know the light
[52:23] is shining.
[52:27] Hallelujah. Is that all right?
[52:38] Let me just jump to this and I'm gonna
[52:39] let you go. I'll finish this as you
[52:41] brother talks about it all the time. All
[52:44] the time. All the time. And this thing
[52:46] has got to become a
[52:48] reality. It can't become human effort
[52:51] because of something that's particular
[52:53] like you and I said many I think the
[52:55] minister said last week. Amen. When it
[52:57] law, when it becomes law, then you're
[53:01] lost. It must be grace. It must be God
[53:05] coming in you. And don't get me wrong,
[53:07] he that knoweth to do good and doth not
[53:09] to him is sin. But my point is, you
[53:12] don't rely upon your ability to to to
[53:16] get you into heaven. Now, okay, I quit
[53:18] smoking. I quit drinking. I quit. I
[53:21] quit. I quit. I quit. You see, you don't
[53:23] even need the Holy Ghost to quit.
[53:29] Hello. And that's what I I don't you
[53:31] know that the law applies. That law
[53:33] applies no matter who you save or not.
[53:36] Resist the devil and he'll keep
[53:39] you. Like I said, Amen. It's just like
[53:41] this. I said, you know, you say, "Well,
[53:43] Lord, I want to stop craving sugar."
[53:45] Well, stop eating
[53:50] it. Come on. Because you got to realize
[53:53] if you're craving sugar, there's
[53:55] something on the inside asking for it.
[53:58] There's a deep call. In other words,
[54:00] there's a spirit of some sort in you
[54:02] that's asking for it. I looked it up on
[54:05] the website.
[54:07] Little
[54:08] demons. Parasites is what they are. In
[54:11] you calling for the sugar and you think
[54:14] you just want it,
[54:16] but they've been living in you so long
[54:18] till you don't even know it. Oh, come
[54:20] on. Amen.
[54:23] That's what it is.
[54:26] And eventually these same parasites kill
[54:29] you. All kinds of conditions come by
[54:32] these
[54:35] parasites. Candidas is what they call
[54:38] like
[54:41] candy, but they're in you and your
[54:44] government did it. But my point is, if
[54:47] it's calling, if it's calling, that
[54:49] means there's something on the Is that
[54:51] right?
[54:53] And you respond by going to get what it
[54:55] wants. And sugar craves sugar. The more
[54:58] sugar you eat, the more you want. Am I
[55:02] Hello. Hello. Y'all don't get mad with
[55:04] me. I try I'm not trying to take your
[55:06] candy away. But my point is, Amen. You
[55:09] must understand, Amen. that whenever
[55:12] something's calling for something is
[55:14] because something is inside calling for
[55:16] it.
[55:18] Whether it's darkness, whether it's
[55:20] light, Amen. If is calling, if you're
[55:22] craving, whether it be lush, whether
[55:24] that means there's a something inside
[55:26] there calling for it.
[55:30] And when you go for it, that means
[55:32] you're satisfying this thing that's in
[55:35] you that's not even you.
[55:38] It's just a squatter. Hallelujah. in
[55:41] your life and the only way you could
[55:44] ever conquer it is to stop resisting.
[55:49] But you say, "Oh, brother Bruce, how can
[55:51] I resist it?" Stop.
[55:56] Just stop. But you going to suffer? Yes,
[56:00] your mind battles will be great, but
[56:03] remember after three days, it's got to
[56:06] die. Amen. If you can conquer it for
[56:09] three days and take it to the seventh
[56:12] day, it's complete. Amen. They say
[56:15] that's how you develop a habit. Do it
[56:16] seven days and you got it.
[56:23] Y'all hear what I'm saying? So when you
[56:25] look at this thing, you must understand,
[56:27] amen, that God is saying, listen, if you
[56:29] crave it, there's something in you
[56:31] craving for God.
[56:33] The only way that you can crave for God
[56:35] is that God is inside craving, pulling.
[56:39] Hallelujah. I want more. That's why the
[56:42] word of God said, "Grow up into him."
[56:44] That means you got a life on the inside
[56:46] that wants God. And God said, "All you
[56:49] got to do is pull for it and I give you
[56:51] more." El
[56:54] shoo. He said, "And listen, I believe
[56:57] this with all my heart. If Shakespeare
[57:00] is in you or
[57:02] Beethoven, he said if Beethoven is in
[57:05] you, you got you'll be a
[57:06] composer. You have to act like Beethoven
[57:09] even when you don't want to. You might
[57:11] not look like him, but you'll have his
[57:13] mannerism. You'll have his things that
[57:15] he likes, the things that he don't like.
[57:17] You'll know Beethoven better than
[57:18] anybody else would.
[57:22] Hallelujah. So if Christ is in you,
[57:27] [Music]
[57:32] What you going to crave then? What is
[57:35] that deep going to call for?
[57:38] What is that? Now if he's sunshine and
[57:40] he represent the sun, what about it?
[57:42] What about it? What about it? The son
[57:44] give life to everybody.
[57:46] Everything. Come on, somebody. Amen. So,
[57:49] so is the son of God. So is a daughter
[57:51] of God. If you truly a son and daughter
[57:53] of God, you give life. Amen. You give
[57:57] life.
[57:59] Amen. Come on, somebody. Now, look at
[58:02] this. I'm going to say it this say it
[58:03] back to you. You know what a sacrifice
[58:04] mean? It means to be devoted and
[58:09] dedicated. And if we're going to be
[58:11] living sacrifices to Christ, we must be
[58:13] devoted and
[58:15] dedicated. Hello,
[58:17] somebody. Oh my my my I'm I'm going to
[58:19] close here. But you understand what I'm
[58:21] working with. Amen. And the Bible said,
[58:23] "If my gospel be it, it is here to them
[58:25] that are
[58:27] lost." Remember the story that brother
[58:29] brother Craig told the other day when he
[58:31] was here, how brother Bannon was
[58:33] wandering around, he didn't know he had
[58:35] lost his
[58:37] way. He lost his way because he thought
[58:39] he was a guy. And if you think you
[58:42] something, you've lost your way.
[58:47] Huh? And you're sure to be lost pretty
[58:50] soon. Amen. They call it the death man
[58:52] walk. How do you know you in a death man
[58:55] walk? Because you come back to the same
[58:57] sin that you once conquered.
[59:01] You in a death man walk, circling around
[59:03] the block, but coming right back to the
[59:05] thing that you once conquered. Hello.
[59:10] You've leaned upon your own
[59:11] understanding. You thought you can do
[59:13] it. Now you're at a place right now in a
[59:16] storm in your life and you need God.
[59:19] Hey, but there is a lifeline. Amen.
[59:25] We don't have to have our heads hunk
[59:27] down and you know, we're going to have
[59:29] problems and we're going to have
[59:30] troubles and we're going to have things
[59:31] that we dislike. Amen. But you got to
[59:34] become more than a conqueror. And the
[59:36] only way that you can become more than a
[59:37] conqueror, you got to first conquer
[59:39] yourself. By the grace and help of God,
[59:42] and that's on your knees. People don't
[59:44] want to pray through, but I'm going to
[59:45] tell you something. That is the only
[59:47] token life. I don't want to get ahead of
[59:48] myself this evening, but that is the
[59:50] only token life. You can you can sing,
[59:53] you can shout, you can preach, you can
[59:55] dance, you can run, you can interpret,
[59:57] you can do all these great things and
[59:59] still not have that life in you.
[1:00:04] The only way that you're going to have
[1:00:06] this life is when you see Beethoven in
[1:00:08] you. Amen. Put it this way. Jesus Christ
[1:00:10] in you, the supreme God living and
[1:00:13] working in you. Your everyday craving is
[1:00:16] bread. Bread. Give us this day our daily
[1:00:19] bread. What bread? I am the bread. He
[1:00:22] said, "I want you every day. Give me
[1:00:26] your daily bread."
[1:00:28] Y'all hear what I'm saying? It must You
[1:00:31] must become overwhelmed. You must become
[1:00:34] over uh consumed in your desire for God
[1:00:37] to be more than a
[1:00:39] conqueror. Am I making sense? Best
[1:00:43] stand.
[1:00:49] You know, I I I want to say this,
[1:00:53] people, and don't get me wrong, easier
[1:00:55] said than
[1:00:56] done. You must
[1:00:59] labor to enter into the rest of God.
[1:01:02] But, but this age that we're living in
[1:01:04] has made us
[1:01:05] lazy. We don't read our Bibles. We don't
[1:01:09] pray. We don't hardly listen to the
[1:01:11] message. I can always tell because of
[1:01:13] this response to the
[1:01:14] people, you know, and we've got so we've
[1:01:18] got this thing so given to us. I I mean
[1:01:21] to whom much is given, much is
[1:01:24] required. And per p personally, I
[1:01:26] believe there'll be more people in those
[1:01:28] foreign countries that'll make a rapture
[1:01:30] than in the United
[1:01:31] States. I believe only a few will come
[1:01:34] out of this place. You know why? Because
[1:01:36] seem like those other people, other
[1:01:38] places are more sincere than what we
[1:01:39] are. seem like they seem to be more
[1:01:42] dedicated. Of course, I'm not living
[1:01:43] there. I don't know. And I know the
[1:01:45] demons in America ain't nothing to play
[1:01:48] with. Yeah. You got to be on the top of
[1:01:51] the line to whip them devils. Y'all hear
[1:01:53] what I'm saying? You got to be a totally
[1:01:55] yielded vessel to whip the devils in
[1:01:57] this this United States. I say that to
[1:01:59] us because a lot of time, most of us,
[1:02:01] we've lived with these things and we
[1:02:03] fail to see that this thing is there to
[1:02:05] hinder you.
[1:02:07] Woo. But Paul Paul wrote us a perfect
[1:02:09] word. Nothing. And who shall separate us
[1:02:12] from the love of God? No matter what
[1:02:14] trick the devil brings to us, God will
[1:02:17] always see us through. Y'all hear what
[1:02:20] I'm saying? God going to see us through
[1:02:22] people. But you, we've got to do
[1:02:25] something about what we believe. We've
[1:02:27] got to do something. Uh we just can't
[1:02:30] keep it to ourselves. We got to do
[1:02:31] something. and and and and and and this
[1:02:34] is what I'm working with by the grace of
[1:02:35] God that you and I must understand. If
[1:02:38] we the liars of the world, the Bible
[1:02:39] said don't put it under a bush. Don't
[1:02:41] hide it. Be a fool for Jesus. Let the
[1:02:45] world know you're
[1:02:47] crazy. Is that all right? Let them know
[1:02:50] you're
[1:02:52] crazy. They going to call you crazy
[1:02:54] anyhow just because you follow Jesus.
[1:02:57] Let the world know you're crazy. Let's
[1:03:00] bow. Father God, we come before you as
[1:03:04] humble as we know how. Lord, we thank
[1:03:05] you for your grace. We thank you for
[1:03:07] your mercy and the love. Father God,
[1:03:10] you've been better to us than we've been
[1:03:11] to
[1:03:12] ourselves. Lord, we pray, Father God,
[1:03:14] that the people will come to see that
[1:03:16] no, I'm not a conqueror. I'm more than a
[1:03:20] conqueror. Oh God, that takes us to a
[1:03:22] different level, Lord. And because of
[1:03:25] that, we got you on the inside, Lord.
[1:03:28] We've seen the dead raised. We've seen
[1:03:30] the eyes of the blind open. Lord, we've
[1:03:33] seen cancer healed. We've seen all kinds
[1:03:36] of things done by you, Lord. You're
[1:03:38] obvious because you're the healer. Even
[1:03:41] the healer, those who are in hospital,
[1:03:44] they may think it's the doctor, but we
[1:03:46] know who the healer is. And those who
[1:03:48] are delivered out of insane and silent,
[1:03:50] Lord, we know who the deliverer is. Oh,
[1:03:54] Father, there's only one healer and one
[1:03:56] deliverer, and that's you, Lord. And I
[1:03:59] pray, Father God, that you will have
[1:04:00] mercy of the people, that you will
[1:04:02] become more obvious to us, Lord, that we
[1:04:05] be mindful that you are everywhere, in
[1:04:09] us, above us, and through us. You're all
[1:04:12] in all. Grant it, Lord, in Jesus
[1:04:15] Christ's name we pray.
