[31:47] particular message,
[31:54] the more I see God,
[31:58] &gt;&gt; the more I I think to myself,
[32:02] &gt;&gt; what is man
[32:04] &gt;&gt; that thou are mindful of him.
[32:10] I marvel.
[32:13] &gt;&gt; Uh to me uh the condition of man
[32:20] &gt;&gt; make God just that much greater.
[32:24] &gt;&gt; A holy God,
[32:26] &gt;&gt; a powerful God,
[32:29] the only true living God.
[32:32] &gt;&gt; Yet he would take interest in us.
[32:35] That amazes me.
[32:38] And you know, I love the way God works.
[32:42] He He doesn't work like men.
[32:45] &gt;&gt; He works like God.
[32:48] And what we the way we think
[32:52] is not the way he thinks.
[32:56] And so I'm so grateful tonight
[33:00] to understand the God of William
[33:02] Brandom.
[33:04] or may I say Elijah
[33:09] &gt;&gt; because we got to understand tonight
[33:13] that there are many gods
[33:16] and there are many Jesuses.
[33:19] But God said in the last day
[33:22] he would come as the son of man.
[33:27] And in that ministry,
[33:30] &gt;&gt; God revealed to us who he is.
[33:33] Otherwise we would be Baptist,
[33:38] &gt;&gt; Methodist,
[33:39] Pentecostal,
[33:41] &gt;&gt; Catholic, whatever. We would be some
[33:43] kind of denomination.
[33:46] But then we came to understand that God
[33:48] in his word
[33:51] as we stand, let us turn to Acts 1 and8
[33:58] which is a familiar scripture.
[34:01] Excuse
[34:07] me.
[34:10] &gt;&gt; My My eye is a little bloodshot up here,
[34:13] so don't uh
[34:15] &gt;&gt; it's what happens ever so often.
[34:20] &gt;&gt; I I Excuse me. I'm almost I'm almost at
[34:24] the end of my journey,
[34:27] &gt;&gt; but I still have to get these
[34:28] injections.
[34:31] But my eye has improved tremendously. So
[34:37] that nobody but Jesus.
[34:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. So let us turn to Acts 1 and8.
[34:46] But ye shall receive power
[34:49] after that the Holy Ghost has come upon
[34:52] you.
[34:54] &gt;&gt; And ye shall be witnesses.
[34:57] &gt;&gt; Excuse me. I like that. I like that
[34:59] word. Ye shall be witness
[35:03] unto me both in Jerusalem
[35:06] and in all of Judea and in Samaria
[35:10] &gt;&gt; and unto the uttermost parts of the
[35:13] earth.
[35:15] And we know what a witness is.
[35:18] Someone who's been there, who was there
[35:22] when it happened.
[35:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Second Chronicles, please.
[35:30] We're going to start at the 32nd verse.
[35:33] &gt;&gt; Excuse me, the 32nd chapter. Forgive me.
[35:44] Beginning at the seventh verse,
[35:50] it says, "Be strong and courageous.
[35:55] Be not afraid nor dismayed
[36:00] &gt;&gt; for the king of Assyria,
[36:04] &gt;&gt; nor for all the multitude that is with
[36:07] him in him.
[36:10] &gt;&gt; For there be more with us
[36:14] than with him.
[36:17] &gt;&gt; With him
[36:19] &gt;&gt; is an arm of flesh,
[36:22] &gt;&gt; but with us
[36:24] is the Lord our God
[36:26] &gt;&gt; to help us
[36:28] &gt;&gt; and to fight our battles.
[36:31] &gt;&gt; And this is where I got love. And the
[36:33] people rested
[36:37] themselves upon the word of Hezekiah,
[36:40] the king of
[36:44] Let us pray. Our gracious father, we
[36:48] thank you for your grace and your mercy.
[36:51] We thank you for being so good to us.
[36:55] &gt;&gt; Lord, you have been better to us than we
[36:57] have been to ourselves.
[37:00] And Lord, we just pray tonight
[37:03] something will be said in this message.
[37:06] Bless your people. Strengthen them in
[37:09] their faith.
[37:11] Give them the courage and strength
[37:14] to go further and to go on.
[37:17] Help us now Lord Jesus
[37:20] because we are nothing without your
[37:21] guidance.
[37:23] You are our leader.
[37:25] &gt;&gt; You are our head. You are our Lord. And
[37:30] we pray that you would lead us and guide
[37:32] us into all truth. And may we obey you,
[37:36] Lord, not out of fear, but because we
[37:40] love you. Have mercy upon us now. In
[37:44] your name Jesus Christ, we pray.
[37:47] Amen.
[37:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:48] &gt;&gt; You may be seated.
[37:50] &gt;&gt; I think I it just something that really
[37:53] uh in while I was praying
[37:56] &gt;&gt; uh struck me uh
[38:00] &gt;&gt; and I I need to say this
[38:04] when it comes to the Holy Ghost.
[38:07] Uh we may you may not get a a a
[38:10] sensation
[38:12] the first
[38:15] but somewhere in in your life
[38:19] &gt;&gt; God will v visit you
[38:24] &gt;&gt; and the best way I would say
[38:28] uh that a man has the Holy Spirit
[38:34] &gt;&gt; is when he comes to his rest.
[38:39] You understand what I mean? You're no
[38:41] longer struggling
[38:44] on whether the blood is powerful enough
[38:47] to save you,
[38:51] but you have taken the simplicity of the
[38:53] gospel
[38:55] and you have applied it to your life.
[38:59] And that rest, remember, that's what
[39:02] Jesus promised
[39:05] in Hebrews. It says you'll labor
[39:08] or enter into
[39:11] my rest
[39:13] and that laboring is against unbelief.
[39:17] But if God said it,
[39:20] that's enough.
[39:23] There is nothing you can do other than
[39:25] to receive the word, believe the word,
[39:30] and act upon it. Matter of fact, brother
[39:32] Brandham said it like this. He said,
[39:35] "Even if you don't have a baby,
[39:39] adopt one."
[39:42] He said, "Adopt one."
[39:44] &gt;&gt; If you don't have the Holy Ghost,
[39:47] confess that you have it.
[39:50] &gt;&gt; Keep on confessing it. Keep on believing
[39:52] it. And then God will bring it to pass.
[39:57] See,
[39:58] &gt;&gt; it is important
[40:00] that we have the strength of the Lord.
[40:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:05] on the inside of us.
[40:08] When I worked with the characteristics
[40:11] of God or the divine nature,
[40:16] I was actually uh uh working with his
[40:19] strength
[40:23] whether you thought about it like this
[40:24] or not.
[40:26] But the very divine nature that God is
[40:28] trying to place within us,
[40:32] &gt;&gt; it's the same nature that said, "Let
[40:34] there be."
[40:38] There's only one nature of God.
[40:42] &gt;&gt; And that nature he poured into Christ
[40:45] and then Christ poured into into the
[40:48] church.
[40:50] IT'S NOT DIFFICULT. GOD IS always
[40:52] revealed in simplicity.
[40:56] But we make things difficult
[41:00] because WE FEEL LIKE WE'VE got to have
[41:02] something to do with it.
[41:05] And at the END OF THE DAY, YOU HAVE
[41:08] NOTHING TO DO WITH IT.
[41:11] GOD IS IN CONTROL OF EVERYTHING.
[41:16] &gt;&gt; Is that right? THE PROPHET OF GOD SAID,
[41:19] &gt;&gt; "You can speak in tongues, you can
[41:21] dance, you can shout,
[41:24] &gt;&gt; you can GIVE TITHES, YOU GIVE ALL OF
[41:26] THOSE THINGS,
[41:28] BUT IF YOU DON'T have the Holy Ghost,
[41:31] if you have not come to your REST
[41:35] AND believe that Jesus Christ
[41:38] took your sins away,
[41:41] he is your perpetuation.
[41:44] He is YOUR ATONEMENT."
[41:46] HALLELUJAH. HE IS THE LAMB OF GOD
[41:50] THAT TAKES AWAY YOUR SIN.
[41:52] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. SIMPLE
[41:55] &gt;&gt; BUT POWERFUL.
[41:58] &gt;&gt; Because a lot of times people think is
[42:01] how much message you can quote.
[42:04] You are deceived.
[42:07] Because the devil can outquote you.
[42:11] And there is no way he can be saved.
[42:14] Y'all hear me? AND THERE'S NO WAY THE
[42:16] DEVIL CAN BE BORN AGAIN.
[42:19] &gt;&gt; Because if he's born again, then he
[42:21] becomes A SON OF GOD. HALLELUJAH.
[42:25] &gt;&gt; BUT YOU CAN BE AS DUMB AS A ROCK BUT
[42:28] FILLED WITH THE HOLY GHOST
[42:31] and you are bride.
[42:33] Amen.
[42:36] &gt;&gt; Within that
[42:39] revelation,
[42:41] &gt;&gt; you have strength.
[42:43] AMEN.
[42:44] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[42:45] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[42:45] &gt;&gt; NO FALSE DOCTRINE
[42:48] &gt;&gt; WILL EVER GET YOU
[42:51] &gt;&gt; IF YOU TRULY HAVE THE HOLY GHOST
[42:54] within you. You may not even BE ABLE TO
[42:58] QUOTE THE BIBLE
[43:00] OR EVEN QUOTE EVERYTHING BROTHER BHAM
[43:02] TELLS YOU,
[43:04] BUT YOU IT AIN'T YOU. IT'S A GOD IN YOU.
[43:09] AND GOD KNOWS HIS WORD. WHEN IT'S
[43:12] PREACHED RIGHT AND WHEN IT'S PREACHED
[43:14] WRONG. HALLELUJAH. IT'S NOT EVEN YOUR
[43:18] INTERPRETATION OF THE MESSAGE.
[43:23] AMEN.
[43:24] &gt;&gt; Cuz God's word needs no interpretation.
[43:29] &gt;&gt; But we need revelation.
[43:34] Having the strength of God
[43:39] &gt;&gt; is having God set on the throne of your
[43:41] heart.
[43:44] &gt;&gt; Then he becomes king.
[43:48] &gt;&gt; Is that all right?
[43:51] And when we think about strength,
[43:54] &gt;&gt; it is the capacity
[43:57] of an object
[43:59] &gt;&gt; or substance
[44:01] &gt;&gt; to withand great force or pressure.
[44:08] Sometimes people think that having big
[44:10] muscles is being strong.
[44:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But you got to realize that
[44:17] many people have big muscles.
[44:20] and they're not strong.
[44:22] &gt;&gt; And you can take a thin man with hardly
[44:25] no muscles,
[44:28] &gt;&gt; right?
[44:29] &gt;&gt; Who can whip a man with big muscles,
[44:32] right? Because he knows how to place HIS
[44:35] STRENGTH.
[44:37] COME ON, SOMEBODY.
[44:39] &gt;&gt; And strength, when it comes to strength,
[44:42] &gt;&gt; it's here.
[44:44] &gt;&gt; It's what you receive in your mind.
[44:48] IF YOU BELIEVE you can do it,
[44:51] you can do it.
[44:53] &gt;&gt; IS THAT RIGHT? THAT'S THE BIBLE. ALL
[44:56] THINGS ARE POSSIBLE
[44:58] to them that believe.
[45:01] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[45:03] &gt;&gt; AND THIS IS WHERE STRENGTH COMES FROM.
[45:06] LIKE I READ THE SCRIPTURE WHEN IT CAME
[45:09] TO HEZEKIAH.
[45:10] HEZEKIAH SAID THAT THE ARMY THAT'S
[45:13] AGAINST US, THEY'RE THIS FLESH.
[45:17] THEY MAY HAVE A GREATER NUMBER
[45:20] than what WE HAVE IN THIS BATTLE.
[45:24] HALLELUJAH. BUT THE BATTLE IS THE LORD.
[45:27] MY STRENGTH OR OUR STRENGTH IS NOT FLESH
[45:31] AND BLOOD.
[45:33] BUT OUR STRENGTH COMES FROM THE LORD.
[45:37] HALLELUJAH.
[45:38] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[45:38] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[45:39] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[45:39] &gt;&gt; WELL, YOU SAY, "WELL, WHY ARE YOU
[45:40] PREACHING THIS?
[45:42] WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS COUNTRY IS GOING
[45:44] TO TURN INTO."
[45:46] HALLELUJAH. BUT YOU BETTER KNOW WHAT
[45:49] YOU'RE TURNING INTO. HALLELUJAH. IS THAT
[45:52] RIGHT? BECAUSE IT TAKES THE STRENGTH OF
[45:55] THE LORD ON THE INSIDE
[45:58] TO KEEP YOU FROM BECOMING WHAT THEY ARE.
[46:03] HALLELUJAH. YOU SAY, "WELL, WHERE DO YOU
[46:05] GET THIS FROM, BROTHER BROOKS?" THE
[46:07] BIBLE EVEN SAID, "AS IT WAS IN THE DAYS
[46:09] OF SODOM,
[46:11] is that right? AND ABRAHAM AND ALL OF
[46:14] HIS HERDSMAN
[46:17] IS THAT RIGHT?
[46:19] &gt;&gt; LOT'S HERDSMEN WERE ONCE CHRISTIANS.
[46:23] &gt;&gt; BUT ONCE THEY WENT DOWN TO THE CITY,
[46:27] THEY ALL CHANGED.
[46:29] &gt;&gt; AND THE ONLY RIGHTEOUS LEFT IN THE CITY
[46:34] WAS LOT AND his family
[46:37] minus his wife.
[46:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:39] &gt;&gt; Minus his wife.
[46:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. AND SHE MAY HAVE BEEN A
[46:45] CHRISTIAN,
[46:47] BUT SHE DIDN'T HAVE THE STRENGTH WITHIN.
[46:51] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND THIS STRENGTH COMES BY
[46:54] THE FEAR OF GOD.
[46:56] &gt;&gt; AND THE BIBLE SAYS THAT THE FEAR OF GOD
[47:00] IS THE BEGINNING OF WISDOM and
[47:01] knowledge.
[47:03] HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. SHE IS WITHIN
[47:06] YOUR HEAD.
[47:08] SHE HEARD THE WORD. WHATEVER YOU DO,
[47:11] DON'T TURN AROUND. DON'T LOOK BACK.
[47:15] HALLELUJAH. Y'ALL HEAR WHAT I'M SAYING?
[47:17] BUT THE STRENGTH OF GOD WAS NOT IN HER.
[47:22] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. BUT IT WAS IN LOT.
[47:26] Y'ALL UNDERSTAND ME? AND BECAUSE OF THE
[47:28] INWARD STRENGTH,
[47:31] &gt;&gt; he was able to escape.
[47:36] &gt;&gt; Now, his strength didn't last but so
[47:38] long.
[47:40] But it was long enough to keep him from
[47:42] going into the fire
[47:45] because after they escaped,
[47:48] &gt;&gt; he got drunk.
[47:51] &gt;&gt; Is that all right?
[47:52] &gt;&gt; I mean, same thing with Noah,
[47:54] HE
[47:55] &gt;&gt; HE GOT DRUNK AFTERWARDS.
[47:57] &gt;&gt; AND WHENEVER he he you know, YOU GET
[47:59] DRUNK.
[48:01] THAT'S SOMEWHERE YOU'VE GOT BECOME WEAK.
[48:04] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. YOU'RE NOT IN YOUR FULL
[48:06] STRENGTH.
[48:07] IS THAT RIGHT? AND I'M TALKING NATURALLY
[48:09] AND SPIRITUALLY.
[48:11] YOU'RE NOT IN YOUR FULL STRENGTH. AND
[48:14] THE DEVIL CAN GET YOU TO DO THINGS THAT
[48:16] YOU WOULD NORMALLY NOT DO.
[48:19] HALLELUJAH. But the Bible says ye shall
[48:22] RECEIVE POWER.
[48:25] AND BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID NOT NOT JUST
[48:28] POWER. HE SAID THAT WORD MEANS
[48:30] AUTHORITY.
[48:33] Now I I I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE YOU'RE NOT A
[48:35] MANAGER.
[48:37] MAYBE YOU'RE NOT A BOSS ON THE JOB.
[48:39] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. BUT ONE THING I DO KNOW
[48:43] &gt;&gt; THAT WHEN YOU BECOME THE BOSS,
[48:45] &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T ASK THE QUESTIONS. HALLELUJAH.
[48:48] YOU TELL THE PEOPLE WHAT YOU WANT TO BE
[48:50] DONE.
[48:52] HALLELUJAH. AND THE ONLY QUESTIONS THAT
[48:54] THEY ARE ALLOWED TO ASK
[48:58] IS, can you explain that more?
[49:02] &gt;&gt; RIGHT.
[49:04] BUT THEY MUST DO WHAT YOU SAY DO
[49:07] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE YOU ARE THE person in authority.
[49:10] &gt;&gt; WHAT WE DON'T REALIZE IS THAT EVERY
[49:13] DEMON, EVERY DEVIL IS SUBJECT TO US.
[49:20] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[49:21] &gt;&gt; BUT IF YOU FAIL, FORGET IT. IF YOU FAIL
[49:24] AND FORGET IT, IT'S NOT NOT IN YOUR
[49:27] HEAD.
[49:29] It has to be in your heart.
[49:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[49:33] &gt;&gt; And when it's in your heart, God will
[49:36] reign in you.
[49:39] &gt;&gt; He will be Lord in you.
[49:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[49:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[49:44] &gt;&gt; Now, Satan comes by surprises sometimes.
[49:48] He will be.
[49:50] Hallelujah.
[49:52] Matter of fact, I had an incident today.
[49:55] Amen. And I almost lost control
[49:59] in the way of anger.
[50:02] But then the Lord checked me
[50:06] and and call me on now.
[50:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[50:10] &gt;&gt; Y'all looking at me like I don't know.
[50:12] Y'all don't even know what I'm talking
[50:13] about.
[50:15] Simple to you.
[50:18] &gt;&gt; But it's simple enough to be be used.
[50:22] Hallelujah.
[50:24] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm not a good hunter
[50:27] or I'm not one that know, you know, can
[50:29] just use any kind of rifle.
[50:33] that if it's new to me, you're going to
[50:36] have to explain it to me more than once.
[50:42] &gt;&gt; And that's what my friend did. He
[50:43] explained it to me.
[50:47] If I had it, oh, you I know you got it
[50:49] now.
[50:51] But the point is,
[50:53] &gt;&gt; I had a Kodak moment.
[50:56] &gt;&gt; Three deer
[50:59] &gt;&gt; lined up like a pitcher.
[51:03] You hear what I'm saying? One here, one
[51:05] here, and one here.
[51:11] &gt;&gt; I had the opportunity
[51:14] &gt;&gt; to TAKE ALL THREE OF THEM DOWN. NOW, IF
[51:16] I KNEW what I was doing,
[51:20] IT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED.
[51:22] BUT WHEN I WENT TO FIRE the uh uh the
[51:26] rifle,
[51:29] &gt;&gt; it went click.
[51:32] &gt;&gt; It jammed.
[51:34] &gt;&gt; And I'm thinking, "Oh,
[51:37] &gt;&gt; how did he say undo this?"
[51:40] Make this thing work.
[51:43] It's freezing cold. It's freezing cold.
[51:45] I am in authority,
[51:48] power, life and death in my head.
[51:52] And because I DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO WORK
[51:54] IT,
[51:56] my whole little click
[51:59] here went wow.
[52:03] See, that's what happened to us.
[52:06] We don't know how to handle the word.
[52:10] &gt;&gt; And when it jams
[52:13] or something, make it jam.
[52:15] We don't know how to unjam it. You hear
[52:18] what I'm saying? Because once THE WORD
[52:20] GOES OUT, IT CANNOT COME BACK FOR
[52:25] IS LITERALLY GOING TO ACCOMPLISH
[52:26] WHATEVER YOU ASK.
[52:28] WHATEVER YOU PUT IN THE RIGHT FOR
[52:30] WHATEVER REASON.
[52:32] HALLELUJAH. IT WILL KILL THE ENEMY every
[52:36] time.
[52:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:40] &gt;&gt; But the strength has to be inward.
[52:44] Well, I came to conclusion I'm not a
[52:46] hunter.
[52:50] &gt;&gt; Especially in the cold weather.
[52:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[52:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[52:58] &gt;&gt; You love the Lord.
[53:00] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm I'm I'm I'm speaking these
[53:02] things because
[53:04] I personally
[53:06] &gt;&gt; saw something within myself.
[53:09] &gt;&gt; You see, everything works together for
[53:11] the good.
[53:12] And when you fall short, God, that's God
[53:15] speaking to you.
[53:18] &gt;&gt; There's nothing wrong with being wrong.
[53:22] &gt;&gt; The problem comes in when you don't want
[53:23] to be right.
[53:27] &gt;&gt; Because when you're wrong, you're going
[53:29] to try your best to make things right.
[53:32] Hallelujah.
[53:33] &gt;&gt; Y'all understand what I'm saying?
[53:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. So that's that's even even
[53:40] sometime when you try to think make
[53:41] things right, it doesn't go the way you
[53:44] want it to go.
[53:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[53:48] &gt;&gt; But you make things right
[53:51] by way of confession.
[53:58] &gt;&gt; Can I say it like this?
[54:01] &gt;&gt; You dealing with a lust spirit.
[54:06] You can't say, "Lord, forgive me of my
[54:08] known and my unknown."
[54:16] &gt;&gt; You got TO YOU GOT TO NAIL THE THINGS.
[54:20] IT IT HURTS.
[54:22] SOME OF THE THINGS WE DEAL WITH HURTS TO
[54:24] ACKNOWLEDGE,
[54:26] BUT YOU GOT TO ACKNOWLEDGE IT.
[54:30] I'VE HAD TO ACKNOWLEDGE IT.
[54:32] SOMETIMES I CAN HARDLY GET MY TONGUE TO
[54:34] SAY IT.
[54:40] &gt;&gt; I'm so glad some of y'all know what I'm
[54:41] talking about.
[54:43] &gt;&gt; BUT ONCE you say it,
[54:45] &gt;&gt; IT EXPOSES THE DEVIL
[54:48] and then God goes after it.
[54:53] Thank you, Lord.
[54:54] &gt;&gt; Second Chronicles
[54:56] 32,
[54:58] please. I'm sorry.
[54:59] &gt;&gt; We just read that. All right.
[55:01] So, let's go to Matthew 6.
[55:08] &gt;&gt; I try every day
[55:12] &gt;&gt; to allow God to rule me.
[55:15] &gt;&gt; I don't mind being ruled by the word.
[55:20] I want the word to rule me.
[55:24] I don't like myself being over the word.
[55:28] You understand what I'm trying to say?
[55:30] I want the world word to rule me so
[55:33] much.
[55:35] I want to be like Paul said
[55:38] I am a prisoner of Christ.
[55:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[55:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[55:42] &gt;&gt; Now because you're behind the bars
[55:45] doesn't mean you don't have a desire to
[55:47] do something.
[55:49] But there is a there's a boundary. There
[55:51] is something that keeps you from going
[55:55] beyond that. THAT'S THE HOLY SPIRIT.
[55:59] HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. THAT'S the kind
[56:01] of strength you have within.
[56:06] &gt;&gt; Remember I was talking the other week
[56:07] about the rainbow.
[56:10] &gt;&gt; And brother and brother Bradam said he
[56:11] saw two of them.
[56:14] And he said they looked like they were
[56:16] they were moving. It was alive.
[56:19] And he was going up to see this thing.
[56:23] And he said something made him stop.
[56:27] He couldn't go. BUT SO FAR, GOD MADE HIM
[56:31] STOP. That's the kind of That's THE KIND
[56:33] OF CONTROL
[56:35] I want God to have over ME THAT IF I'M
[56:38] WALKING IN A WAY THAT'S NOT RIGHT OR
[56:41] EVEN IF IT IS RIGHT WHEN HE WANTS ME TO
[56:44] STOP, I WANT TO HAVE THE ABILITY
[56:48] SENSIBILITY
[56:50] STOPS.
[56:56] &gt;&gt; Matthew 6
[57:00] My thought is this
[57:02] &gt;&gt; and I'm going to always be like this.
[57:05] &gt;&gt; What good what good would it do you
[57:08] &gt;&gt; to know all the mysteries
[57:12] of what William Brandon brought what God
[57:15] did through him. What good will it do
[57:18] you if you don't have the life?
[57:24] &gt;&gt; If Christ is not in you.
[57:27] You're wasting your time.
[57:30] You're fooling yourself.
[57:32] &gt;&gt; Your goal and my goal is to make
[57:35] ourselves ready.
[57:37] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[57:38] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[57:38] &gt;&gt; And you're going to have failures.
[57:41] You're going to fall. YOU'RE GOING TO
[57:43] STUMBLE. WHATEVER IT IS, YOU MIGHT HAVE
[57:45] TO CRAWL SOMETIME.
[57:48] HALLELUJAH. BUT IT OUGHT TO BE IN YOUR
[57:50] HEART, IN YOUR HALLELUJAH. THAT YOU HAVE
[57:54] A GOAL.
[57:56] TO GO. HE DID NOT PRESS TOWARD THE MARK
[57:59] OF A HIGHER CALLING IN CHRIST JESUS.
[58:04] IT DOESN'T
[58:05] &gt;&gt; I DON'T MEAN TO SOUND SELFISH,
[58:08] &gt;&gt; BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT EVERYBODY
[58:10] ELSE IS DOING.
[58:17] AMEN.
[58:18] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[58:19] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[58:20] &gt;&gt; And this is between you and God.
[58:23] people. It's got to be a personal thing.
[58:27] But understand, the grace of God got you
[58:29] covered.
[58:31] You go, you might MESS UP GETTING THERE,
[58:34] but the grace of God HAS YOU COVERED.
[58:37] NOW, THAT'S NOT GOING TO WORK FOR YOU IF
[58:39] YOU DON'T BELIEVE IT.
[58:42] HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. YOU GOT TO
[58:43] BELIEVE THAT THE GRACE OF God
[58:47] takes you from glory to glory.
[58:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[58:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, come on. Show me a
[58:54] perfect man in the Bible.
[58:57] There is nothing but one that was Jesus
[59:00] himself. And the Bible said all sin and
[59:04] come short of the glory of God.
[59:08] It's been grace in the beginning
[59:11] in THE END.
[59:12] HALLELUJAH. THAT IS YOUR STRENGTH.
[59:16] WHEN THE DEVIL SAVES YOU NOTHING, LET
[59:19] HIM KNOW I'M COVERED BY THE BLOOD.
[59:22] IT'S NOT EVEN WHAT I THINK ABOUT ME.
[59:25] IT'S WHAT HE THINKS ABOUT ME.
[59:31] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[59:31] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[59:32] &gt;&gt; Tell the devil, I know what God thinks
[59:34] about you.
[59:38] &gt;&gt; And I think the same thing.
[59:41] &gt;&gt; You a devil. Nothing but a tormentor.
[59:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[59:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[59:47] &gt;&gt; He rules in his kingdom.
[59:51] want him to rule.
[59:55] &gt;&gt; I was thinking about a young man today
[59:58] when I was in the apostolic church
[1:00:01] &gt;&gt; and his last name was Hooper.
[1:00:04] We used to call him minister
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; and he would walk from his from college
[1:00:11] &gt;&gt; some down sometime to the church and
[1:00:14] some people thought he was crazy but he
[1:00:16] was one of the most
[1:00:18] sanctified Christians I had ever seen
[1:00:21] and known.
[1:00:24] Now he wasn't in this message that I
[1:00:26] know of but he was always quote
[1:00:30] &gt;&gt; add to your faith virtue.
[1:00:34] knowledge, all
[1:00:36] &gt;&gt; he would always and and he just throw
[1:00:38] his hand some like like he'd throw his
[1:00:41] hands up in the air like this like God
[1:00:43] is just pouring something in him.
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; Wonderful man. And I was wondering
[1:00:48] whether he was still living or not, you
[1:00:50] know, but he was such an example
[1:00:54] &gt;&gt; because he would walk the street
[1:00:57] witnessing to people AND THE HOLY GHOST
[1:00:59] would hit him.
[1:01:03] He didn't care.
[1:01:06] &gt;&gt; And they knew him in college
[1:01:10] as a Christian.
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; Y'all hear what I'm saying? He might
[1:01:14] have been a oddball, but he was a good
[1:01:16] oddball.
[1:01:18] &gt;&gt; And God ruled that man's life.
[1:01:24] &gt;&gt; Matthew 6.
[1:01:29] I wonder where he's at today, but he may
[1:01:31] be in glory already.
[1:01:36] &gt;&gt; Matthew 6:10,
[1:01:39] &gt;&gt; it says, "Thy kingdom come,
[1:01:42] &gt;&gt; thy will be done
[1:01:45] as it is in uh in earth as it is in
[1:01:49] heaven."
[1:01:52] &gt;&gt; Now I'm gonna say it. Thy kingdom come.
[1:01:55] So when the kingdom come, that's the
[1:01:57] Holy Ghost in you. That is the Holy
[1:02:00] Ghost in you. And the Holy Ghost in you
[1:02:03] in this earth is placed in you. So that
[1:02:08] the will of the heavenly
[1:02:12] is done in you
[1:02:14] because you on earth his will that means
[1:02:17] control.
[1:02:19] Hallelujah. EVERYTHING IS CONTROLLED.
[1:02:22] Everything is consumed.
[1:02:25] BY GOD'S WILL.
[1:02:27] &gt;&gt; THERE'S NO BREAKING AWAY FROM IT.
[1:02:30] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. OH, BUT LOOK WHAT JUST
[1:02:32] HAPPENED. Everything is moving by the
[1:02:35] power of God.
[1:02:37] HALLELUJAH. WHETHER IT BE GOOD OR EVIL,
[1:02:41] GOD IS STILL IN CONTROL.
[1:02:44] AND IF WE COULD GRASP THAT AND REALLY
[1:02:47] PLACE THAT WITHIN OUR HEART,
[1:02:50] THEN WE CAN SAY NO WEAPON FORMED AGAINST
[1:02:53] ME.
[1:02:56] AND IF THAT DOESN'T WORK, YOU WORK WITH
[1:02:58] THE SCRIPTURE, AMEN, THAT THE FOOTSTEPS
[1:03:01] OF A RIGHTEOUS MAN
[1:03:04] BY THE LORD.
[1:03:06] And every time we we hear that, we think
[1:03:09] that everything is going to run
[1:03:10] smoothly.
[1:03:13] lead you in the way and you're not going
[1:03:14] to have no stumbles and no falls, no
[1:03:18] trips. And when I look at the righteous
[1:03:20] men of the Old Testament,
[1:03:23] it was up and down. They were failures,
[1:03:26] but they knew how to get up. They knew
[1:03:29] how to cry out for mercy. They knew how
[1:03:32] to say, "Lord, forgive me."
[1:03:35] Now, come on, somebody. The Bible said
[1:03:37] that Abraham staggered not at the
[1:03:40] promises of God.
[1:03:43] Hallelujah.
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; And and and we saw what he did IN THE
[1:03:46] OLD TESTAMENT.
[1:03:48] HALLELUJAH. But in the New Testament,
[1:03:50] there's no charge. You do nothing. And
[1:03:54] you being Abraham's seed, YOU GET THE
[1:03:56] SAME TREATMENT. HALLELUJAH. WITH ALL
[1:04:00] YOUR FAILURES, THERE WILL BE NO CHARGE
[1:04:03] AGAINST YOU.
[1:04:07] NOBODY CAN CHARGE YOU.
[1:04:11] THAT'S WHY PAUL SAID, "WHO SHALL LAY
[1:04:15] to God's elect?
[1:04:17] &gt;&gt; There's no charge."
[1:04:20] YEAH. The devil said, "You're bad."
[1:04:21] You're not bad.
[1:04:24] EVEN THE PROPHET OF GOD SAID, "EVEN
[1:04:27] CALLED OUR CHILDREN BAD
[1:04:31] CHILDREN IN THIS WORLD.
[1:04:35] HALLELUJAH.
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; And the blood keeps us all.
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:45] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:04:47] &gt;&gt; Luke 17:21.
[1:04:55] Listen,
[1:04:58] if you're not careful,
[1:05:01] &gt;&gt; the devil almost convinced you the
[1:05:03] rapture that took place and left and
[1:05:04] left you behind.
[1:05:10] Don't tell me the devil don't talk to
[1:05:11] you like that. Cuz he talks to me like
[1:05:14] that. AND I SAY, "YOU'RE A LIAR. I'M
[1:05:17] DEAR HERE."
[1:05:20] AND I know my God ain't going TO LEAVE
[1:05:21] ME BY. YOU GOT TO TALK TO THAT DEVIL
[1:05:24] like that.
[1:05:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:32] &gt;&gt; You love the Lord.
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; If you don't know nothing about God,
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; the one thing you need to know about him
[1:05:39] is that he's dwelling in you.
[1:05:43] &gt;&gt; Cuz he said in that day you'll know I'm
[1:05:44] in the Father. Father's in me and I in
[1:05:47] you. And as long as he's in you, the
[1:05:50] rapture had to take place.
[1:05:53] Amen.
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:05:55] &gt;&gt; Luke 17.
[1:05:56] &gt;&gt; Luke 21.
[1:05:59] &gt;&gt; Neither shall they say, lo here
[1:06:02] or low there. For behold, the kingdom of
[1:06:06] God,
[1:06:07] wherein
[1:06:09] you
[1:06:11] thy KINGDOM COME, THY WILL BE DONE IN
[1:06:16] EARTH AS IT IS IN HEAVEN. THIS IS YOUR
[1:06:18] FOCUS.
[1:06:20] YOUR FOCUS SHOULD BE LORD. YOUR KINGDOM
[1:06:23] HAS COME TO ME.
[1:06:26] LET YOUR WILL BE DONE IN THIS EARTH
[1:06:30] AS it is in heaven.
[1:06:32] WHATEVER the cost,
[1:06:36] &gt;&gt; your will be done.
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:06:40] Hallelujah.
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:43] &gt;&gt; Luke 12, please.
[1:06:47] 32.
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; A lot of times people don't even realize
[1:06:55] why God be roadblocking them.
[1:06:59] Especially Especially if they don't have
[1:07:01] the Holy Ghost. God going to roadblock
[1:07:04] you.
[1:07:06] You know why? Because he wants you to
[1:07:08] put him first.
[1:07:11] He don't mind blessing you. But you got
[1:07:14] to put him first.
[1:07:16] But rather seek ye the kingdom of God.
[1:07:18] That's what it reads.
[1:07:20] &gt;&gt; All these things shall be added unto
[1:07:22] you.
[1:07:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. You get the kingdom
[1:07:27] inside.
[1:07:29] YOU CAN ASK WHATEVER YOU WILL AND IT
[1:07:32] SHALL BE GIVEN to you.
[1:07:34] That's the Bible. FEAR NOT THE FLOCK.
[1:07:38] DON'T BE AFRAID, for it is your father's
[1:07:41] GOOD PLEASURE
[1:07:43] TO GIVE YOU THE KINGDOM.
[1:07:46] SO YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO BEG FOR IT. If
[1:07:48] you REALLY KNOW IT'S YOURS,
[1:07:51] &gt;&gt; YOU GO GET IT like like the angel said.
[1:07:56] Here's the book.
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; Come and TAKE IT.
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:08:02] &gt;&gt; DON'T TAKE THE BOOK.
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND AND WHEN YOU TAKE IT
[1:08:07] OUT, YOU EAT IT ALL UP. YOU INGEST IT.
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; This book becomes you.
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; YOU BECOME THE BOOK.
[1:08:16] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH.
[1:08:17] &gt;&gt; AND THE STRENGTH OF THE BOOK IS NOW IN
[1:08:19] YOU.
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; Oh yes.
[1:08:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; See, when the king is on the throne of
[1:08:30] your heart,
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; he gives you inner strength.
[1:08:36] I have not yet seen a weak king,
[1:08:39] especially when he's sitting on his
[1:08:40] throne. There's something about that
[1:08:42] throne.
[1:08:45] Now, when do you overcome?
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; You overcome
[1:08:49] when you receive the Holy Spirit.
[1:08:53] And he said it,
[1:08:55] if you overcome,
[1:08:57] I'll let you sit in my throne even as I
[1:09:00] have SAT IN MY FATHER'S THRONE.
[1:09:03] WITH
[1:09:05] IS IN YOUR HAND.
[1:09:08] GOD IS IN YOUR HAND.
[1:09:10] OR CAN I SAY IT IS IN YOUR MOUTH.
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; AMEN. HALLELUJAH.
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; Cuz when Jesus CAME RIDING ON a horse,
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; he was the scroll.
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:09:28] CAME OUT OF HIS MOUTH.
[1:09:31] HALLELUJAH. WAS THE POWER AND THE
[1:09:33] STRENGTH
[1:09:35] TO DESTROY THE ENEMY. HALLELUJAH.
[1:09:37] HALLELUJAH. AND RECOGNIZE THIS.
[1:09:40] &gt;&gt; YOU ARE THE BODY OF CHRIST.
[1:09:43] DO YOU HEAR what I'm saying? IF YOU OPEN
[1:09:46] YOUR MOUTH, DON'T SPEAK IT IN VAIN.
[1:09:52] IT HAS TO.
[1:09:54] AMEN. HALLELUJAH. WHY? BECAUSE YOU'RE
[1:09:57] NOT RESTING.
[1:10:01] GOD was defeated.
[1:10:08] [Music]
[1:10:10] New hope of glory.
[1:10:13] Hallelujah.
[1:10:14] First John 4
[1:10:18] and four. First John 4 and four.
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; How many of y'all believe this?
[1:10:24] Amen.
[1:10:25] &gt;&gt; If you really believe that you're a true
[1:10:27] child of God,
[1:10:28] &gt;&gt; sometimes you just got to meditate on it
[1:10:32] and in your mind think within yourself
[1:10:34] how
[1:10:35] I DON'T KNOW, BUT HE SAYS it
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; and therefore I'm going to act upon it.
[1:10:42] I'M GOING TO BELIEVE IT. HALLELUJAH.
[1:10:45] HALLELUJAH.
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; RIGHT. First John 4.
[1:10:51] Ye are of God, little children.
[1:10:55] Now, did you hear what he said? Ye are
[1:10:57] of God. He didn't say ye are of the
[1:11:00] devil. He say of
[1:11:03] little children
[1:11:05] and having overcome them
[1:11:09] because what greater in
[1:11:13] you
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; than he that is in the world.
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; You know, I worked AT ONE TIME. GREATER
[1:11:19] IS HE. WHO IS HE?
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; GOD HIMSELF
[1:11:24] HIMSELF.
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. CHRIST HIMSELF. THE REAL
[1:11:28] HOLY GHOST. THE ONLY HOLY GHOST.
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; Y'ALL HEAR WHAT I'M SAYING? THE ONE WHO
[1:11:33] CREATED EVERYTHING.
[1:11:35] HOW CAN HE THAT IS SO GREAT
[1:11:39] DEFEATED BY HIS CREATION? IT'S
[1:11:42] IMPOSSIBLE.
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. THE DEVIL COULD
[1:11:46] NEVER HAVE POWERS ENOUGH DESTROY.
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; THE BATTLE HAS ALREADY BEEN FOUGHT,
[1:11:53] BROTHERS.
[1:11:55] I LOVE IT. JESUS WENT DOWN TO HIS
[1:11:58] TERRITORY.
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:12:01] &gt;&gt; YEAH. He whipped HIM ON THIS SIDE OF
[1:12:03] EARTH, TOO.
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THE DEMONS WERE SCREAMING
[1:12:08] WHEN JESUS WAS WALKING AROUND.
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:12:12] THEY THOUGHT THEY HAD DEFEATED HIM.
[1:12:14] BUT ALL HE DID WAS GO DOWN TO HELL
[1:12:18] AND SHOW THE DEVIL who's the real boss.
[1:12:22] He went DOWN THERE. HE TOOK THE KEYS OFF
[1:12:25] THE GRAVE.
[1:12:26] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. I LOVE THE WAY BROTHER
[1:12:28] BRANDHAM SAID IT. THE KEYS OFF HIS SIDE
[1:12:34] the door in his face.
[1:12:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; GOD.
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH.
[1:12:43] &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE GOD THAT'S IN YOU.
[1:12:46] &gt;&gt; DON'T LET THE DEVIL KICK YOU AROUND.
[1:12:50] Kicking him around.
[1:12:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:55] &gt;&gt; Coming from a quote,
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; fellowship with God through
[1:12:59] reconciliation,
[1:13:02] 1958, January 20.
[1:13:08] He said, "Fellowship.
[1:13:10] God wants to fellowship with man always
[1:13:15] wanted to do it. The Old Testament, all
[1:13:19] of it was full of of the shed blood.
[1:13:24] And without the shedding of blood, there
[1:13:27] is no remission of sin.
[1:13:30] Where there's no remission of sin,
[1:13:33] there is no fellowship.
[1:13:35] You got to get away from sin before you
[1:13:39] can ever have fellowship with God.
[1:13:42] Now, he ain't talking about drinking and
[1:13:44] smoking and all that kind of stuff.
[1:13:46] He talking about unbelief. Sin is
[1:13:49] unbelief.
[1:13:51] Hallelujah. You got to get away from sin
[1:13:54] before you can ever have fellowship with
[1:13:56] God.
[1:13:58] Because God can't fellowship with sin.
[1:14:02] So you're born a sinner, saved in
[1:14:04] iniquity.
[1:14:08] Come to the world speaking live.
[1:14:10] &gt;&gt; And how can you ever do it?
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; You just might as well quit right now to
[1:14:16] begin with.
[1:14:18] You can't do it within yourself. But
[1:14:21] there is one God to bring you to
[1:14:24] FELLOWSHIP
[1:14:26] BACK. Not only to fellowship,
[1:14:30] RELATIONSHIP WITH GOD,
[1:14:32] TO MAKE YOU SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF GOD
[1:14:36] FOR FOR THAT PURPOSE. HE DIED FOR THAT
[1:14:39] PURPOSE. NOT ONLY JUST FELLOWSHIP, BUT
[1:14:42] RELATIONSHIP,
[1:14:45] RIGHT? COME HERE, PROVE HIMSELF
[1:14:48] EMMANUEL,
[1:14:50] OMNIPOTENT.
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; I LOVE THAT WORD OMNIPOTENT. ALL
[1:14:53] POWERFUL.
[1:14:55] ALL POWERFUL.
[1:14:57] HALLELUJAH.
[1:14:59] &gt;&gt; EMMANUEL,
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; GOD WITH US,
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; OMNIPOTENT, ALL POWERFUL.
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. And when omnipotence speaks,
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; THE MIRACULOUS HAPPENS.
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; WHAT IS THE WORD
[1:15:13] GOD SPOKEN? HALLELUJAH. LET ANY MAN OR
[1:15:17] WOMAN, ANY promise of God, WHEN A SPEAKS
[1:15:23] FROM THE BIBLE,
[1:15:26] WILL TAKE place
[1:15:29] seed set root in the heart of a man or
[1:15:32] woman.
[1:15:34] [Music]
[1:15:36] IT'LL PRODUCE JUST EXACTLY
[1:15:39] WHAT THE PROMISE IS because it's the
[1:15:42] word of the omnipotent.
[1:15:45] He said it has to
[1:15:49] hallelujah.
[1:15:49] &gt;&gt; YOU GOT TO BELIEVE IT. IF GOD SAID WITH
[1:15:52] YOUR HIS STRIPES YOU HEAL,
[1:15:55] going to give you pain. HE GOING TO
[1:15:57] BRING SOMETHING. BUT WHAT ARE YOU GOING
[1:16:00] TO DO? Believe the devil's lie.
[1:16:04] I BELIEVE WHAT GOD SAID ALREADY.
[1:16:07] &gt;&gt; AND BROTHER BEN TAKES IT ALL THE WAY
[1:16:09] BACK TO 200,000 YEARS AGO.
[1:16:12] 4,000. HOWEVER YOU WANT TO PUT IT. THE
[1:16:15] LAND WAS SLAIN.
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. The Bible said
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; he was bruised for our iniquity. The
[1:16:25] chastisement of our peace was upon him
[1:16:27] THAT WITH HIS STRIPES WE WERE HEALED.
[1:16:31] Do you believe that?
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; Well, I believe it so much that one day
[1:16:35] I'm going to change
[1:16:37] from mortal to immortality immortality.
[1:16:41] I'm going to put on my my imort immortal
[1:16:44] body.
[1:16:46] MY HEALING DON'T STOP HERE.
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; HE'S HEALED MY SOUL. SO I KNOW HE CAN
[1:16:53] HEAL MY BODY. HEAL MY SPIRIT. SO I KNOW
[1:16:57] HE CAN HEAL MY BODY.
[1:17:00] HALLELUJAH.
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; Now he's working on my mind, too.
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; I'm trading that one in.
[1:17:08] I take his mind and he can have
[1:17:12] the Lord. Second Samuel, please.
[1:17:15] &gt;&gt; Samuel
[1:17:19] having that strength. And let me tell
[1:17:21] you like this. If you don't read your
[1:17:24] Bible and if you don't listen to these
[1:17:26] messages, you're going to be weak.
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; That's your food.
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; That's the vitamins
[1:17:36] that God sent down here for you.
[1:17:40] &gt;&gt; Y'all hear what I'm saying? And I don't
[1:17:42] mean hearing it with your head, hearing
[1:17:44] it with your heart, receiving it in your
[1:17:47] soul,
[1:17:49] thinking about what is said and applying
[1:17:52] it to yourself.
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; Second Samuel 22
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; beginning at the 33rd verse
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; down to the 43rd.
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; God is my strength and power.
[1:18:12] And he maketh my way perfect.
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; God is my strength and my power.
[1:18:20] And he maketh my way perfect.
[1:18:23] Make my way perfect.
[1:18:26] Hallelujah.
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; How do you think Job was considered
[1:18:31] perfect?
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; It was only by the sacrifice he made.
[1:18:37] the lamb that he that he made the the
[1:18:40] altar. That's what made him perfect and
[1:18:44] he constantly did it.
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; God wouldn't have been able to really
[1:18:50] talk to Adam and Eve and have fellowship
[1:18:51] with them had not slain that lamb.
[1:18:56] The lamb,
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; the blood of the lamb
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; is what bridged that breach temporarily.
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; The blood OF JESUS CHRIST
[1:19:07] IT'S THE ONLY THING THAT BR YOU KNOW
[1:19:08] BINDS a bridge,
[1:19:12] A PLACE OF FELLOWSHIP, A PLACE OF
[1:19:14] RELATIONSHIP.
[1:19:16] HALLELUJAH. Y'all hear what I'm saying?
[1:19:19] Even Paul said, you can understand all
[1:19:22] mystery. And this is what my head. You
[1:19:25] got people say, "Oh, HE AIN'T DEEP
[1:19:27] ENOUGH." BUT LET me say it like this.
[1:19:29] ARE YOU WALKING IN the light
[1:19:32] as he is IN THE LIGHT? HALLELUJAH. YOU
[1:19:36] UNDERSTAND ME? WHAT IS THE LIGHT OF GOD?
[1:19:39] IT'S A REVELATION THAT GOD GIVES YOU
[1:19:43] to walk in. HALLELUJAH. WHAT IS THE
[1:19:46] REVELATION HE GAVE YOU?
[1:19:49] GOD SHALL MAKE HERSELF READY.
[1:19:52] NOTHING ELSE.
[1:19:54] GOD MAKES HERSELF. THIS IS A WEDDING
[1:19:56] SITUATION.
[1:19:58] HALLELUJAH. IT AIN'T ABOUT JOBS AND ALL
[1:20:01] THIS OTHER KIND OF STUFF. EVEN THOUGH WE
[1:20:03] KNOW WE HAVE TO DO IT, BUT YOUR WHOLE
[1:20:06] FOCUS SHOULD BE MAKING YOURSELF READY.
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; And with all these mysteries, if we
[1:20:17] don't have love for nothing,
[1:20:22] nothing.
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And don't tell me love ain't
[1:20:27] being tested.
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; Mine is.
[1:20:32] I'm just letting I'm just being honest,
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:20:37] If a person is the enemy, it doesn't
[1:20:39] bother you.
[1:20:41] &gt;&gt; But it's always somebody that you love.
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; That's what brings the firemen,
[1:20:51] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; Let's move on. He maketh my feet like
[1:20:56] hind's feet
[1:20:59] and sitteth me upon my high places.
[1:21:03] Have you ever seen
[1:21:06] goats or deers
[1:21:08] in high places and you wonder how on
[1:21:12] earth did they get
[1:21:15] the rocks and the cliffs and all this
[1:21:17] thing? And they walk on them like it
[1:21:20] just
[1:21:22] to them it is
[1:21:25] because OF THE WAY THE FEET ARE MADE.
[1:21:29] Hind's feet.
[1:21:32] Hallelujah. And the Bible said he maketh
[1:21:35] my feet like hind feet.
[1:21:38] That means you can climb up high.
[1:21:42] You can reach those levels. I don't care
[1:21:45] where the storm the the the the the
[1:21:49] BOULDERS ARE.
[1:21:51] HAVE YOU EVER seen it? THEY THEY'LL LEAP
[1:21:53] RIGHT UP THERE
[1:21:56] AND YOU'LL never see THEM TUMBLE LIKE
[1:21:57] THAT. jump on that and catch it and move
[1:22:01] on to the next.
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; He teaches my hands to walk.
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; That means you don't know how to
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:22:19] &gt;&gt; And why is he teaching you?
[1:22:22] &gt;&gt; Because they're going to be war.
[1:22:25] Amen.
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; THE POINT IS,
[1:22:27] &gt;&gt; YOU DIDN'T COME HERE FOR a picnic.
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; You came to prove
[1:22:35] &gt;&gt; that you're not from Satan's Eden.
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; WE ARE COME FROM GOD. WE GO BACK TO GOD.
[1:22:44] HOW THE WORLD is being shaped.
[1:22:50] GOD IS SHAPING A BRIDE.
[1:22:56] REMEMBER, YOU'RE NOT THE WORLD.
[1:23:02] CONTRAST.
[1:23:04] HALLELUJAH.
[1:23:06] WE'RE RIGHTEOUSNESS. WE ARE UNRIGHTEOUS.
[1:23:11] UNHOLY.
[1:23:13] YOU UNDERSTAND ME?
[1:23:14] THERE MUST BE A CONTRAST,
[1:23:18] NOT THE SAME. BUT WE MUST BE DIFFERENT.
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; THIS IS WHAT GOD is teaching us.
[1:23:25] Teaching us how to what? War. He teaches
[1:23:28] my hand to war. Hallelujah.
[1:23:31] Fifth 35th verse.
[1:23:33] &gt;&gt; He teaches my hand to war. So that a bow
[1:23:36] of steel is broken by thine arm.
[1:23:40] Hallelujah. Thou hast also given me the
[1:23:43] shield of salvation.
[1:23:45] Thy gentleness have made and thy
[1:23:48] gentleness have made me great.
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; Shield of salvation. Amen.
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; And that's you look at it, you're like
[1:23:56] no, it it means that you are protected
[1:24:00] by the revelation
[1:24:02] of your salvation
[1:24:04] and no errors CAN PENETRATE.
[1:24:09] NOTHING CAN DESTROY IT.
[1:24:12] THAT'S WHAT I'M talking about. That
[1:24:13] rest.
[1:24:17] Hallelujah.
[1:24:19] IT'S UNEXPLAINABLE
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; because you don't even know HOW IT GOT
[1:24:24] THERE.
[1:24:25] WHERE DID GOD GIVE ME THAT REVELATION?
[1:24:31] And how come he gave it to me?
[1:24:35] &gt;&gt; I HAVE FAULTS LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE.
[1:24:38] BUT THERE'S A REST IN meal
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; and it's a peace.
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; No matter what I go through,
[1:24:47] the devil can't take that from me.
[1:24:51] &gt;&gt; Like I told somebody, the only only
[1:24:54] person that could ever tell me that I'm
[1:24:56] not bride
[1:24:58] is Jesus himself.
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; And he ain't going to tell me that cuz
[1:25:04] he's the one that told me that I was.
[1:25:08] Hallelujah.
[1:25:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; Thou hast also given me the shield of my
[1:25:15] thy salvation
[1:25:16] &gt;&gt; and thy gentleness. 26.
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; Thou has enlarged my steps under me.
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; So that my feet did not slip.
[1:25:28] Hallelujah. That's another thing. As we
[1:25:31] grow in grace,
[1:25:33] the place we used to stumble,
[1:25:36] we don't stumble.
[1:25:39] But that's growth that don't happen
[1:25:41] overnight. I wish
[1:25:46] for years
[1:25:47] BEFORE
[1:25:51] I got an answer.
[1:25:52] [Music]
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; But the next thing I know, it's gone.
[1:26:00] And he didn't even knock on my door like
[1:26:01] the UPS or whoever.
[1:26:05] It was gone.
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; Somebody know what I'm talking about.
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; I love this part preached this one time
[1:26:20] on the army of of David.
[1:26:24] He said, "I have pursued my enemy
[1:26:28] &gt;&gt; and destroyed them
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; and turned not again until I had
[1:26:32] consumed them."
[1:26:34] Y'all hear what I'm saying?
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; So when you praying, you don't turn
[1:26:40] around. Oh, God didn't hear me
[1:26:43] [Music]
[1:26:44] whether I fell or whether I feel it or
[1:26:46] not.
[1:26:48] I will keep cons going after that enemy
[1:26:51] until he is completely done away with.
[1:26:54] HALLELUJAH. I'M NOT GOING TO
[1:26:58] TELL. IS THAT RIGHT?
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:27:01] &gt;&gt; We must come to a place
[1:27:04] as a bride of Jesus Christ
[1:27:07] where Satan
[1:27:08] &gt;&gt; and his temptation
[1:27:11] will know not know what to do with us.
[1:27:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; HE GOING TO THROW EVERYTHING at us.
[1:27:18] It won't bother us.
[1:27:21] &gt;&gt; Y'all hear me? I DIDN'T QUOTE THAT
[1:27:23] VERBATIM, BUT that's what brother said.
[1:27:26] WE WILL come to a place where Satan
[1:27:29] won't have he won't have no nothing. HE
[1:27:31] WON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH US.
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HIS WAY OF TEMPTING US WILL NO
[1:27:38] LONGER PREVAIL. AMEN.
[1:27:41] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THAT'S WHAT I'M PRESSING
[1:27:44] TOWARD. YOU SAY, "ARE YOU THERE YET?"
[1:27:46] NO.
[1:27:47] I'M ON MY WAY. I'M ON MY WAY.
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; I'M ON MY WAY.
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:27:57] &gt;&gt; NO. You said, "Well, wait, brother. Let
[1:27:59] me tell y'all something.
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; I know there's a growth in me.
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; It's the growth of the Holy Ghost.
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; Right. More strength, brother, more
[1:28:11] power,
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; more authority.
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. that I see in myself.
[1:28:19] &gt;&gt; But thou has girdled me with the
[1:28:20] strength of battle,
[1:28:25] &gt;&gt; them that rouse up against me, has thou
[1:28:27] subdued under my under feet.
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; Thou has also given me the neck of my
[1:28:32] enemy,
[1:28:34] that I might destroy them that hate me.
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; Are y'all taking this down? misly
[1:28:41] understanding
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; that no matter what your enemy is,
[1:28:47] no matter what they are,
[1:28:50] &gt;&gt; you are victorious.
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; No matter what demon come your way, God
[1:28:55] has given you the victory
[1:28:57] and you just got TO GO TAKE IT.
[1:29:00] I GOT TO GO TAKE. YES, YOU GOT TO FIGHT
[1:29:02] FOR IT.
[1:29:04] Everybody's fighting.
[1:29:07] Amen.
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; You got to fight.
[1:29:11] Hallelujah.
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:13] &gt;&gt; He said, "Then I did I beat them as
[1:29:15] small as the dust of the earth."
[1:29:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:22] &gt;&gt; 45th 30. Yeah. I did stamp them as the M
[1:29:25] of the street
[1:29:28] [Music]
[1:29:30] and then spread them abroad.
[1:29:35] I that's that's some beat.
[1:29:39] That's a whooping.
[1:29:42] Amen. I stopped them till they became D.
[1:29:47] &gt;&gt; David didn't play.
[1:29:50] You love the Lord. And and this is you
[1:29:53] know we read these things and it seemed
[1:29:56] LIKE SOME DRAMA BUT NO GOD IS
[1:29:59] ENCOURAGING YOU
[1:30:01] what the strength in you is capable of
[1:30:05] doing.
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT PEOPLE DECLARE
[1:30:13] they they are.
[1:30:17] They can't overcome you
[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; because of the king that's in you.
[1:30:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; 1 Chronicles. I'm almost done.
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; 16.
[1:30:36] I'm trying to give you a word of
[1:30:38] encouragement. People,
[1:30:40] all of us are fighting,
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; but you got to have something to work
[1:30:44] with.
[1:30:47] The first attack is on you in your mind.
[1:30:51] As I spoke a couple of weeks ago, the
[1:30:54] first thing the devil tried to get you
[1:30:55] to do is reason.
[1:30:59] Then he attacks your worthiness.
[1:31:02] You're not even worthy.
[1:31:05] See, he he's always against the word
[1:31:08] because he's right and he's wrong.
[1:31:12] I'm not worthy. But he made me worthy.
[1:31:16] I take what he says,
[1:31:21] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; Seek the Lord and his strength.
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; Seek his face continually.
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; Remember his marvelous works that he has
[1:31:39] done,
[1:31:40] his wonders,
[1:31:42] &gt;&gt; and the judgments of his mouth.
[1:31:45] Have not God been good to you?
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; Every one of us have testimonies in it
[1:31:54] &gt;&gt; of what God has done.
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; Think about those things
[1:32:00] cuz even when he was good to you, you
[1:32:04] never was worthy of it.
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; I I can say that for myself.
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh ye seed of Israel, his
[1:32:14] servant,
[1:32:16] ye children of Jacob,
[1:32:18] his chosen one.
[1:32:21] Amen.
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; It ain't good enough to hear the
[1:32:23] preacher say you're chosen.
[1:32:25] &gt;&gt; If you don't believe,
[1:32:28] let the devil know I'm chosen.
[1:32:32] I'm I'm the real chosen one.
[1:32:35] &gt;&gt; I don't know what they talking about on
[1:32:36] television,
[1:32:39] but I'm the real thing. You got TO LET
[1:32:42] HIM KNOW. I KNOW Y'ALL THINK, BUT I TALK
[1:32:44] TO THE DEVIL LIKE THAT.
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; I do.
[1:32:52] &gt;&gt; That's right. He talks to me and I'mma
[1:32:53] tell him to
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; especially when he don't get away like I
[1:32:57] told him tell him to do.
[1:33:00] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; Listen what brother saying. I'm
[1:33:04] &gt;&gt; I think I'll close on this.
[1:33:07] This is from Patmas vision. You heard
[1:33:10] this.
[1:33:12] What I'm trying to say people, if you
[1:33:14] got the Holy Ghost,
[1:33:18] &gt;&gt; let use him.
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; Or better yet, let him use you.
[1:33:25] &gt;&gt; You say you got it.
[1:33:27] &gt;&gt; Let him use you.
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; Don't be ashamed of what you possess.
[1:33:33] &gt;&gt; Let him use you.
[1:33:36] This is what we're here for.
[1:33:38] If anybody going to see Jesus or Christ,
[1:33:41] they're going to see him through you.
[1:33:45] &gt;&gt; We got millions of church people,
[1:33:48] but we don't have millions of anointed
[1:33:50] ones, truly anointed by the Holy Spirit.
[1:33:55] That's not ashamed of what they believe.
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; Right. Okay. The Pat vision paragraph
[1:34:02] 215.
[1:34:04] What happens
[1:34:06] when two omnipotence meet?
[1:34:09] &gt;&gt; When God and man's come together,
[1:34:13] two,
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; something's got to shake.
[1:34:20] Whatsoever you say with that creative
[1:34:24] power of of omnipotent power of God
[1:34:28] knowing that he promised it
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; and he said it in his word.
[1:34:36] It creates a power
[1:34:38] out yonder
[1:34:41] bring things things to pass
[1:34:44] things that is not
[1:34:46] it makes
[1:34:49] &gt;&gt; them as though they are
[1:34:52] because two omnipotent
[1:34:54] have met there he stands oh isn't he
[1:34:59] wonderful
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; let me tell y'all something brother
[1:35:04] could have went out there and said
[1:35:05] Listen, I want three squirrels today
[1:35:10] and he wouldn't have gotten nothing.
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; But omnipotent told him
[1:35:16] omnipotent spoke to him and said, "How
[1:35:18] many?"
[1:35:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Somebody says
[1:35:25] the other day uh when I was in Iowa
[1:35:27] City,
[1:35:28] &gt;&gt; I testified about how the Lord blessed
[1:35:30] me.
[1:35:32] &gt;&gt; That would have been my second house.
[1:35:35] how God cleared the records for me.
[1:35:40] And one brother who
[1:35:42] had just talked to his wife about my
[1:35:45] testimony, not saying who the brother
[1:35:47] was.
[1:35:49] And then I come down there and I'm
[1:35:50] testifying
[1:35:52] what he just testified
[1:35:54] to his wife about. And then he says to
[1:35:57] me after service, "My wife and I want a
[1:36:00] new house."
[1:36:02] I said, "Well, God spoke to you.
[1:36:06] &gt;&gt; Go get it."
[1:36:13] &gt;&gt; I don't understand it.
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; Cuz God can speak through a man from the
[1:36:18] book, giving you your answer,
[1:36:22] and you let the devil reason it away.
[1:36:30] All things are possible
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; to them that believe.
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; And just like I told him, I told my wife
[1:36:38] or somebody I was talking to when it
[1:36:41] comes to taxes.
[1:36:43] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "Go fish."
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; And we know these things happen.
[1:36:50] One situation happened.
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; Even in in in in Guyana,
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; man didn't want his wife to go to
[1:36:57] church.
[1:37:00] He threw her keys in in in the river or
[1:37:02] whatever it was.
[1:37:04] She went fishing
[1:37:06] or he went fishing.
[1:37:08] &gt;&gt; Yeah. And the first fish he caught he
[1:37:10] brought it
[1:37:12] she got the fish and there was the keys
[1:37:17] and he said
[1:37:19] he WAS TRYING GOD.
[1:37:21] DID YOU KNOW THAT MAN was converted
[1:37:25] because he came to find out that God is
[1:37:28] real?
[1:37:31] &gt;&gt; When two omnipotent and you ARE
[1:37:35] you are BECAUSE THE WORD SAYS YOU ARE.
[1:37:39] BUT YOU GOT TO BELIEVE THAT YOU ARE.
[1:37:48] &gt;&gt; Come on somebody.
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; It's the truth. Here
[1:37:53] was Peter.
[1:37:55] &gt;&gt; Was he a failure?
[1:37:58] &gt;&gt; He cursed.
[1:38:03] &gt;&gt; He didn't. I'm not one of them.
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; I don't know him.
[1:38:09] But it wasn't about whether Peter knew
[1:38:10] him. He knew Peter.
[1:38:14] They said, "Yeah,
[1:38:15] &gt;&gt; YOU YOU CAN'T DO YOU can't you can't
[1:38:17] strip election away.
[1:38:20] When God has elected YOU TO BE BRIDE,
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH, IT DOESN'T LICENSE US TO
[1:38:25] SIN.
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; BUT WHEN WE DO,
[1:38:29] &gt;&gt; HE JUSTIFIES US."
[1:38:34] OH,
[1:38:34] &gt;&gt; it's the truth. Wasn't
[1:38:41] that Peter at the gate and said silver
[1:38:45] such as I have rise up
[1:38:50] &gt;&gt; too omnipotence.
[1:38:57] &gt;&gt; Okay, let me read this last scripture
[1:38:58] now.
[1:39:00] 1 Chronicles 29.
[1:39:09] 1 Chronicles 29:12-14.
[1:39:15] both riches and honors comes of thee,
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; and thou reignth over all,
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; and in thy hand is power and might,
[1:39:28] and in thy hand it is to make great
[1:39:33] strength unto all.
[1:39:36] Let me tell y'all something. When y'all,
[1:39:39] I'm g tell you how to how
[1:39:42] it works. Now, whether God
[1:39:45] it it's all according to his plan too.
[1:39:50] &gt;&gt; But first of all, can I illustrate it
[1:39:52] like this?
[1:39:54] &gt;&gt; Your husband coming home, been on a long
[1:39:56] trip
[1:39:59] and you come to you come to the door
[1:40:02] with a rag around your head
[1:40:06] and your cleaning clothes.
[1:40:12] He opened the door. There's no fragrance
[1:40:15] coming through,
[1:40:17] &gt;&gt; no food prepared.
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:22] &gt;&gt; And you want HIM TO SAY,
[1:40:24] &gt;&gt; "OH, HONEY,
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; I missed you."
[1:40:30] &gt;&gt; No. Nm.
[1:40:33] &gt;&gt; He's disappointed
[1:40:35] because he's been gone
[1:40:38] &gt;&gt; and he wants a real homecoming.
[1:40:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let me tell you something,
[1:40:44] sisters. You got that food ready
[1:40:49] right there.
[1:40:52] So when he comes through the door, he
[1:40:54] smells it before he gets in there.
[1:40:59] Dressed in a nice something. You don't
[1:41:02] have to be like you're going to a party
[1:41:04] dress.
[1:41:08] And for those of you that wear a little
[1:41:10] cologne, put it
[1:41:16] I'm telling y'all something.
[1:41:20] &gt;&gt; Better listen to I'm I'm a man.
[1:41:23] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:41:24] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:41:25] &gt;&gt; THE ATMOSPHERE.
[1:41:26] &gt;&gt; ATMOSPHERE.
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; You can almost say, "Honey,
[1:41:31] &gt;&gt; since you've been gone, I realize I need
[1:41:33] something."
[1:41:37] He gonna pull it. He gonna give it.
[1:41:42] I'm telling you the way a man thinks,
[1:41:44] you better listen to me.
[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; Is that all right?
[1:41:50] &gt;&gt; It's the protocol.
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; When you want something for God,
[1:41:57] you don't you don't come to the husband
[1:41:59] and say,
[1:42:02] "Listen, since you've been gone,
[1:42:05] this broke, that broke THIS REPAIR.
[1:42:10] NO, NO,
[1:42:12] &gt;&gt; you mention none of that at FIRST
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE YOU WANT YOUR FELLOWSHIP WITH
[1:42:17] HIM TO BE SWEET.
[1:42:20] That's how it is IN PRAYER.
[1:42:23] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. YOU PUT SOME
[1:42:25] LOVING ON THAT MAN. SAY, "HONEY, you
[1:42:27] don't know how much I MISS YOU.
[1:42:30] I THOUGHT ABOUT you all day, every day."
[1:42:33] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:42:35] Amen.
[1:42:38] Y'all think I'm playing. I'm serious.
[1:42:41] &gt;&gt; I'm real. I'm real.
[1:42:43] &gt;&gt; Right. That's how you talk with Jesus.
[1:42:47] &gt;&gt; When you want something from him,
[1:42:50] &gt;&gt; love him. Love on him.
[1:42:53] &gt;&gt; Worship him.
[1:42:55] Worship him. Hallelujah. You say it
[1:42:58] ain't scripture. It is scripture.
[1:43:01] Even when it come to Esther, she put ON
[1:43:02] THE GARMENTS. HE BOUGHT HER.
[1:43:07] THAT special garment and you think he
[1:43:10] didn't notice it.
[1:43:15] That's what you do.
[1:43:18] You talk to Jesus, tell him how much you
[1:43:21] love him and really mean it and oh Lord,
[1:43:25] and then you hear him say,
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; "Is there something that you need?"
[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; You say, "That ain't scripture."
[1:43:34] It's scripture.
[1:43:36] &gt;&gt; When that woman came to Simon's house,
[1:43:38] she pulled that alabaster box all on his
[1:43:41] feet.
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; She started crying. DIDN'T SAY A WORD.
[1:43:49] He knew what you
[1:43:52] He's the same yesterday.
[1:43:56] WORSHIP HIM. DON'T BRING YOUR HONEYDEW
[1:43:59] LIST FIRST.
[1:44:05] AMEN.
[1:44:06] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:44:07] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:44:07] &gt;&gt; And then you done worship him. You
[1:44:09] you've gotten the Holy Spirit and and
[1:44:12] you could ask whatever you will.
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:18] &gt;&gt; HAD IT RIGHT. SAID THAT AIN'T NOTHING
[1:44:20] BUT the truth.
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; SHE WAS ALREADY IN THE atmosphere
[1:44:28] &gt;&gt; and God dropped it.
[1:44:31] He's the same yesterday, today, and we
[1:44:33] just don't know how to approach it.
[1:44:36] Say, Lord, teach me how to approach it.
[1:44:40] Teach me how the things that you like
[1:44:42] for me to do and like for me to say.
[1:44:45] Hallelujah.
[1:44:48] Hallelujah. You love the Lord. Okay, let
[1:44:50] me finish this. 1 Chronicles 29 12 14.
[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; But riches and honor comes of thee.
[1:45:00] And thou reignth over all, and in thy
[1:45:03] hand is power and might,
[1:45:06] and in thy hand it is to make great, and
[1:45:10] to give strength unto all. I want my
[1:45:13] portion. Now therefore, our God, we
[1:45:17] thank thee and praise thy glorious name.
[1:45:22] But who am I? And what is my people that
[1:45:26] we should be able to offer so willingly
[1:45:30] after this?
[1:45:33] &gt;&gt; This is it.
[1:45:34] &gt;&gt; For all things come of thee,
[1:45:38] and of thine own have WE GIVEN THEE.
[1:45:42] &gt;&gt; I DON'T HAVE NOTHING. MY PRAISE IS
[1:45:45] YOURS. EVERYTHING I GOT. HALLELUJAH. YOU
[1:45:49] GAVE ME AND I'M GIVING IT BACK TO YOU,
[1:45:52] LORD. I DON'T EVEN KNOW.
[1:45:54] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HOW is this?
[1:45:58] &gt;&gt; HOW IS THIS?
[1:46:01] EVERY AND EVERYTHING I OFFER IS what
[1:46:04] you've given me.
[1:46:06] &gt;&gt; That's right. It's yours.
[1:46:10] &gt;&gt; But I give it back to you.
[1:46:13] You gave me these testimony. That's why
[1:46:15] I try to tell people give your
[1:46:17] testimony.
[1:46:20] When we had that testimony service,
[1:46:23] y'all have no idea what that did for me.
[1:46:26] Hallelujah. I was just in a state of
[1:46:29] mind. Lord, I'm working hard. I'm doing
[1:46:32] all I can do, Lord, for you.
[1:46:35] WE HAVE GOOD SERVICES, BUT I DON'T SEE
[1:46:38] WHAT YOU'RE DOING. AND THEN ALL OF A
[1:46:40] SUDDEN, we had a testimony service and
[1:46:43] different ones were telling the
[1:46:44] miraculous that God had done.
[1:46:47] It lift me up.
[1:46:50] It made me see that the labor is not in
[1:46:53] vain.
[1:46:55] &gt;&gt; Not the glor. IT AIN'T GLORIFYING ME.
[1:46:57] IT'S GLORIFYING the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:47:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:03] &gt;&gt; You love the Lord.
[1:47:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. We'll just stop there.
[1:47:11] &gt;&gt; Let us stand.
[1:47:15] [Applause]
[1:47:19] Just got to praise him.
[1:47:22] &gt;&gt; The devil say you you you hypocrite.
[1:47:26] Call me what you want, but this
[1:47:28] hypocrite going to praise him.
[1:47:32] That's all I got to say. Whatever you
[1:47:35] want to say about me, devil, that's
[1:47:36] okay. But I know what he given me, and
[1:47:39] I'm gonna give it back to him.
[1:47:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let me tell you something.
[1:47:43] Y'all, some of y'all don't want to
[1:47:44] dance.
[1:47:46] You don't know how good it is to have
[1:47:48] two feet to dance.
[1:47:51] &gt;&gt; You don't want to clap your hands.
[1:47:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:55] &gt;&gt; That's the man who ain't got no hands.
[1:48:01] We got so much to thank him for.
[1:48:04] Hallelujah. One thing I know about the
[1:48:06] Lord,
[1:48:08] if you're not ashamed of him, he will
[1:48:11] not be ashamed of you.
[1:48:13] &gt;&gt; And he will bless you even when you
[1:48:15] don't ask him to.
[1:48:18] You love the Lord. Let that inner
[1:48:20] strength of the Holy Ghost flow through
[1:48:24] you. Let it be your prayer, Lord. Let
[1:48:27] this inner man reflect itself to the out
[1:48:32] that that not only do pe can he said let
[1:48:36] your light so shine
[1:48:39] that men may see your light and glorify
[1:48:43] the father
[1:48:45] which is in heaven.
[1:48:47] That's what we're here for.
[1:48:50] Let's pray. Father God, we come before
[1:48:52] you as humbly as we know how.
[1:48:55] &gt;&gt; We thank you for your grace.
[1:48:57] We thank you for your mercy, Lord. We
[1:49:00] just thank you for all that you
[1:49:02] everything that you have.
[1:49:04] There's nothing that I can claim. I'm no
[1:49:07] creator, Lord God, outside of what you
[1:49:10] have given me.
[1:49:13] But I pray, Lord God, that you give us
[1:49:16] the grace and the mercy to allow your
[1:49:19] Holy Spirit to consume us to rule over
[1:49:23] our lives.
[1:49:25] We want you to be Lord.
[1:49:27] &gt;&gt; Oh God, help us now.
[1:49:30] &gt;&gt; Father, look beyond our faults
[1:49:32] &gt;&gt; and see our needs tonight. We give you
[1:49:35] praise. We give you the glory. We give
[1:49:39] you the honor. Every one of us in here
[1:49:42] have fallen short of the glory of God.
[1:49:45] And without your mercy and grace, we
[1:49:48] would be all hell bound. But thank you
[1:49:50] Jesus for just being so real to us,
[1:49:54] allowing us to see
[1:49:57] and understand what our mission is in
[1:50:00] this world. Bless us now. Help us
[1:50:03] achieve what you have have set in order
[1:50:07] for us.
[1:50:09] We'll be careful to give you the praise,
[1:50:12] glory, and honor. In Jesus Christ's name
[1:50:15] we pray.
[1:50:17] Amen. Amen.

[1:53:04] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[1:53:09] So, I just wanted to give a little
[1:53:11] praise report.
[1:53:18] &gt;&gt; So, this prior week, we had a couple of
[1:53:21] tests in our classes.
[1:53:27] &gt;&gt; And one of the classes I was really
[1:53:29] struggling with,
[1:53:33] &gt;&gt; it was the day before the test. I was
[1:53:44] It was around the same hour that I
[1:53:46] prayed that everything started making
[1:53:48] sense.
[1:53:53] &gt;&gt; And so afterwards I took the test.
[1:53:57] Turns out I got the highest score.
[1:54:04] more than us.
[1:54:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you, brother.
[1:54:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:11] &gt;&gt; Let's sing this song.
[1:54:15] It's not by power.
[1:54:18] It's not by
[1:54:19] [Music]
[1:54:22] my spirit,
[1:54:24] says the Lord.
[1:54:27] It's not by might.
[1:54:30] is not by power
[1:54:33] but by my spirit says the Lord.
[1:54:40] This mountain
[1:54:42] shall be removed.
[1:54:46] This mountain
[1:54:48] shall be removed.
[1:54:52] This mountain
[1:54:54] shall be removed
[1:54:58] by my spirit, say the Lord.
[1:55:03] It's not by might,
[1:55:06] it's not by power,
[1:55:10] by my spirit, says the Lord.
[1:55:15] He's not by might.
[1:55:18] is not by power
[1:55:21] but by my spirit says the Lord.
[1:55:27] All this mountain
[1:55:30] shall be removed.
