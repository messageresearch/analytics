[Music] it might give us a little bit of joy a little bit of happiness [Music] i think about the uh the names of jehovah that's what our brothers say jehovah is my provider and we enjoy him being our providers [Music] and that was a great thing but there at the end of the old testament [Music] a new revelation was shown revelation of jehovah's [Music] the name of that city will be jehovah sharma you know [Music] the presence of the lord will be there we'll never leave you nor forsake you amen i claim that right now foreign we'll start at the 20th verse now this 33rd chapter of exodus there is a lot in this chapter and he said thou cast not see my face for there shall no man see me and live and the lord said behold there is a place by me and thou shalt stand upon a rock and it shall come to pass that while my glory passeth by thou put thee in a cliff to the rock and will cover thee with my hand while i pass by my grandpa i'll take away my hand and thou shall see my back parts but my face shall not be seen. let's just spy our heads and word of prayer heavenly father we just approach unto you in all honor and praise [Music] giving you the preeminence we just humble ourselves this morning knowing [Music] no strength in our own selves or is this good no other place that we could go to but lord will we come to you father and we hide ourselves in your sight in the name of jesus christ amen i mean amen you can be seated moses here when you're reading in exodus chapter like i said there was a lot going on in this chapter and when you get to when you read in the beginning of the chapter is speaking unto moses and he says i want you to leave here i want you to go up into the place that i'm going to show you your sins have done too much your inequity and all these things have separated me us from you he took the uh the tabernacle that was in the middle of the people and he took it he took it outside of the camp went who was really interested in jehovah and it was at that time where joshua began to show monaco his true nature when he left the the tent or the tabernacle or he left the the city behind it he left all of his people behind they said wherever the tabernacle the lord goes so he left the people behind and went to the tabernacle and there he says wherever that presence is that's where i'm going to be and when jehovah began to tell moses i am not going with you i'm just going to send my angel before you then don't even send me i'm gonna stay right here because laura it's in your presence oh don't just send a messenger lord don't just send an angel to go with us but if your presence does not go with us then we don't even want to go it's a mighty statement let's see we would give up our inheritance we would give everything up and in verse 14 jehovah said it to him we can enjoy the revelations of god we can enjoy the worship of the lord we can enjoy praise in his name and we like and that's what moses was experiencing here is jesus it's a little hiding place and what i'm going to do moses is i'm going to take you i'm going to place you inside this hiding place and if you just place yourself in this hiding place in the side of the rock then i will cause all my glory to pass by thee i will place my hand on top of you and my presence that would kill you we've sickness has come upon us whatever it is maybe we get discouraged in our lives and we just can't heal ourselves we just can't deliver ourselves no matter what happens we just can't forgive ourselves we can't even wash ourselves we get down to a place in our lives where we just need christ it's just like you know like think about the president of the united states no matter how how great you think you are or maybe the president of your company where you work no matter how great you think you are you just get in the presence of these mighty men that are around you just let the president of the nation or the president of your company come back you would begin to feel a little small and that's just a little thing compared to the presence of jehovah where if our prison system has a place called death row but they have a hope in themselves that one day they're gonna get out to death for them to hide if you were to take their story of their sins to practically any person throughout the nation or throughout the world those persons would look at those people's sins and judge them and say you are awake you are deserving of death and if god was to show up at their cell door nervousness when they would begin to see the purity and righteousness of god how righteous god is and how the wickedness of what they had done to god's creatures of how they had who could stand in god's presence but there is a little rock over here over next to jehovah he said there's a little rock by my side there's a little place where the rock was smitten and it's in that smitten rock you can hide yourself this is when god created the heavens and the earth he placed adam and eve there in the garden of eden he was cast out of the heavens and he found himself cursed in the earth and so he clothed himself in the beast of the earth and this beast came into the garden of eden we call him the serpent as he came into the garden of eden god had his son there jude but when god decided to separate eve from adam that he smoked adam on the side and that little it caused a little crevice there in the side of adam [Music] throughout history one to the other in a marriage ceremony she came out of him she will come back to him and when she clings to him she'll be sick i think anybody that any teenager or young man young woman your parents say feed you they clothe you they give as you begin to mentally you begin to leave your parents behind and you begin to look for a mate throughout history christ was placed upon the cross it's the rock that was that was spoken of in exodus it is that roman soldier put that spear blood [Applause] blood water and spirits you remember the story from matthew chapter 25. in matthew chapter 25 the there's the story of uh the man that was planted in the field and he went there and he and he built a really nice vineyard let me tell you there wasn't anything more that he could do for that vineyard than anybody else could have done he created a more beautiful vineyard than anybody else ever could have created a prettier field and he went and he sowed his own seed in that field but then as the parable goes that while men slept and and then i will send my angels jesus christ told us he told us to count the costs if you're ever going to be a christian if you're ever going to decide to follow christ jesus said you must first count the costs find out what it's going to cost follow christ and see if you're willing to pay that price or not you're gonna have to lay down the things that you're thinking otherwise you're never going to be a successful christian the most miserable christians i know are those that try to stay on the fence they want to before the presence of the lord begins to withdraw himself and you can't get yourself into the presence of the lord anymore of the world he also counted the costs he carried the cost of what it would cost of putting his bride in the earth blessing of planting his seeds down in the clay of the earth and just like adam and eve when eve was separated from adam he said the theme of it was gonna be the beast at the beginning the same bride that fell at the beginning she was separated from adam but now there is a bride of christ at the end time she has left the side of christ she was separated from jesus christ on the cross she found herself in the field of the earth around her is growing the the tears the weeds of the world men and women that are have given themselves over to obese nature where the bride of christ is uh trying to be filled but the whole time we're surrounded with those that are being filled with the evil spirits [Music] there is a holy spirit that has promised to the bride of christ and to everyone that rejects the holy spirit there is an unholy spirit to anoint them to accept the beast's nature but if you once accept that holy spirit he will live inside of you and cause you to reject that nature of the beast and to give you an opportunity give that an opportunity to return back to the site of christ when christ was put on the cross nailed there in agony [Music] god catches the revelation of jesus christ she runs back to his side as quick as she can she catches the revelation of that beast's nature inside of her except for through the lord jesus christ lord place me there lord let me hide myself from there i used to be inside of him but i was pulled out of the side of christ don't do this and don't do that don't do this entering into the presence of the lord jesus christ you know in in his presence there is no law it is presence there is no uh no rules no ordinances we leave those things behind when we receive the holy ghost why because we you receive the holy ghost you are receiving amen the law was given unto us to keep us and to hold us you are receiving you reject him and receive christina why because once you experience the presence of the lord that presence of the lord is something that you can never forget it causes you to become a fool for you don't chase after money or careers or different things we might all have our little bank accounts and our jobs and our careers and things because we have one goal as the bride of the lord jesus christ we have to get into his presence moses was given the vision of an of a promised land and it wouldn't be a land of slavery and so i said i'm just going to send my messenger to show you the way hello it's at that time that moses said everything's got to stop yes everything's got to halt we're not going to go one more step lord just kill us right out here in the wilderness because if your presence doesn't go with us we don't want to go at all god was looking for that statement sometimes god has to get us into these places where if we've been dilatory to seek his face and then all these other things will be given unto you but it would say if we seek our careers we seek our investments our jobs we where he can leave you behind [Music] and let you sit there outside of the presence until you begin to appreciate your husband your creator photo creator i think every single one of us if we ever found ourselves in a place and maybe you're there right now where it's been a while since you've enjoyed the presence of the lord god has his ways where he'll withdraw himself [Music] to see if you really value his presence how much do you really value his presence how much do you really need when jehovah began to reveal himself to the children of israel he kept revealing his names you know i think they had nine names of jehovah that were revealed unto israel the first one is jehovah jiren where he said i will be your provider if you cling to yourself inside jehovah i will provide all of your needs i i will just be your healer that's where we live right now [Music] that we begin to forget what it's like to live in his presence when jesus christ came and walked on this earth there's and they say why are you here what are you going to do to me don't cast me out or like in the case of the legion don't look at the and so god let the the the unclean spirits be cast out into the pigs oh do you appear those unclean spirits are still here and they are still afraid of the presence of the lord jesus christ but i want you to know it says the scribes and the pharisees were filled with unclean spirits but there is no record that those unclean spirits ever cried out why because they felt comfortable where they were there is no record that those unclean spirits ever cried out because they were comfortable there they were afraid because they knew they weren't going to be cast out that's the power of the spirits of religion you ought to run to the lord jesus christ as fast as but when in exodus chapter 33 verse two y'all jehovah is speaking unto moses he says and i will send my angel before thee then verse 3 says unto a land flowing with milk and honey for i will not go up in the midst of thee for thou art a stiff-necked i don't know what it felt like to be moses right there it caused moses to go take that tabernacle that was in the midst of the congregation i'm sure the people begin to wonder what's going on all the tents were surrounding the tabernacle there everybody's going about their daily business and they set the tabernacle back up on the mountains off on the out on the distance and as he and as he began to set the tabernacle back up on the mountainside there that's the presence of the lord that used to be in the midst of the camp now showed up on the outside it says and moses took the tabernacle he pissed it without the camp a far off from the camp i kept the distance and he called it the tabernacle of the congregation so those that were seeking the presence of the lord had to leave the city behind and to go out to the mountains now look here in verse 8 university and it came to pass that when moses went out under the tabernacle all the people rose up and it came to pass as moses entered into the tabernacle the cloudy pillar descended it stood at the door of the tabernacle and the lord talked unto moses and watch what the people's express spirit experience what the people did as soon as they saw the presence of the lord outside of the camp it says that all the people saw the cloudy pillars stand at the tabernacle door and all the people rose up and worshiped it every man in his tent door the bible says that when he saw the presence of the lord leaving the uh at that camp outside the door that he ran out there and he stood at the tabernacle door where the presence was at the base of the mountain and that's when moses went into the tabernacle being to speak to jehovah began to tell jehovah you brought me out here remember at this time he says i am and that's when he got the promise down there in verse 14. moses in verse 15 he tells jehovah if thy presence go not with me then carry us if you don't go with us we don't even want to go one step from here you know that same thing is reenacting itself in every church across the nation you see people are supposed to be christians instead of loving the presence of the lord jesus christ they'll worship there at their at the door of their house but they have no testimony of the presence of the lord ever being at their house i can't stand a moment lord without you holding my hand i can't even walk without you holding my hand i need the lord every moment every hour i you know don't just say oh i i set my angel before you the lord if your presence is not here i cannot even go in a step further every single one of us has a duty to jesus christ not my brother not my my i am the one that needs to find you as my provider i am the one that needs to discover you as my healer i am the one that needs the presence of jehovah in my life all right we've got to come to the place where we've grown up long enough even my own children they have to come to that place they've grown up in my household well they're going to come because christ is coming back soon he's going to find out what you've been growing in your garden whether you are growing the the plants of the lord love joy peace you're in this in this nation we have a a plague going across the nation of all these hatred men towards their brothers where all the democrats hate the republicans and the republicans hate the democrats the right wing versus the left-wing a lot of the conspiracy theories their whole purpose and destiny is to bring you into a place of fear and hatred to challenge your emotions [Music] but you know there's wickedness in high places in jesus day and when jesus christ washed on the earth he had a right to be upset at the roman government for the things that the roman government was doing upon the jewish nation but he spent all of his focus and energy was on what was going on in the church amen we have to be filled with the holy ghost brother bran i'm set up i don't know why they spend all this money on the military making i know a secret weapon he says to spend all money to develop these secret weapons they have a better weapon than the russians just put me in charge to the military let every member of the military be filled with the holy ghost they said you'd never have to fire another bullet you wouldn't yeah it's a sad leave your mother and father is the archives of the united states washington d.c thick glass it's a piece of paper 240 years ago they probably spent millions of dollars just building a case to protect it one of these days you won't even be able to find the ashes because it was never the constitution in the first place it was a spirit of blessing that was upon this nation but that spirit is lifting there's hatred men for their brothers you know that hatred has always been here but it's been given a license to run all over the place have fervent love one to another if it was my servants would fight she said amen amen you know the law has its place it exposes the beast's nature inside of us we read the ten commandments when you see those commandments they come against you so you no longer [Music] let's turn her to romans chapter 13. we gotta leave these things behind and find the presence of god ourselves romans chapter 13 verse 10. love worketh no ill to his neighbor therefore love is the fulfilling of the law la murray don't like and now knowing the time and now it's high time to awake out of sleep for now our salvation is nearer than when we believe [Music] let's cast off the works of darkness and let us put on flesh to fulfill the lust thereof amen i wish i could tell it to the people storming the capitol capital but they won't receive it it doesn't matter what side of the political spectrum you're on right or to the left where they go the left is going to go where they go but the bride of christ will be saying close to the rock place for me lord let me hide myself amen amen amen let's just stand i remember when peter was them and the disciples were speaking i said something to jesus saying should we call down fire out of heaven remember in a time when elijah was surrounded by the enemy's and so the disciples were speaking to jesus i don't remember the exact parable [Music] of should we call it on fire out of him [Music] you don't know what spirit is causing you to say those [Music] what we have seen these last few months in our nations [Music] and i've seen many a christian [Music] has already been prophesied the direction it's going to go yeah we can do our things make our voice heard but ultimately me we have one nation and it's a heavenly nation [Music] we know where this country is [Music] to rise up sodom and gomorrah and apologize to them you [Music] healings [Music] we're here to cling to christ our fighting is on our knees our fighting is in the way the spirit leads us [Music] a nation has been promised [Music] it's a draw from that land right [Music] [Music] like we had never fallen [Music] [Music] and all the foolishness of this world will pass away but let me tell you we can draw from that nation right now [Music] when we are in the presence of the lord [Music] you just can't seem to rise yourself up the enemy has you surrounded me you've stumbled you've fallen [Music] then just start looking at that nation oh [Music] i have one more scripture right here [Music] he's talking about the tabernacle there that where the jews are worshiping here it is jesus christ has been dead and risen again for 20 30 years when this is written the jews are still going on worshiping at the temper at the temple in jerusalem not knowing that that the the sacrifice is christ was christ upon the cross [Music] not even knowing that the presence of god had departed from them that's when saint paul wrote this verse you see he's telling the jews there the in the hebrews or the not the jews he's telling the the christians there amongst the hebrews [Music] he says we also have an altar [Music] think about it oh the levites would eat the sacrifices the israel would bring their lamb and have a sacrifice there and they will partake of the sacrifice [Music] has been removed from jerusalem [Music] they had to leave that religion behind and go inside the camp [Music] [Music] without [Music] [Music] by him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to god continually [Music] as the fruits of our lips giving thanks to his name [Music] we're to see a lot of disappointing things in the upcoming years [Music] as the systems of government around us stumble and fall [Music] foreign [Music] whether they be right or wrong [Music] are designed to get into your emotions [Music] bring you down through fear hatred [Music] [Music] heavenly father i we just pray unto you [Music] i know many listen to me grew up in the congo i here grew up in the united [Music] [Music] not a country of this world [Music] have been offered to us in the name of jesus christ and the cleft of the rock lord place for me lord let me hide myself indeed for i need thee lord every hour [Music] lord i want to see your face lord if your presence doesn't go [Music] [Music] [Music] our brother would god [Music] oh [Music] i'll turn it back the world beyond [Music] oh [Music] so i am turning back [Music] me still [Music] me still i will fall no turning back [Music] yes [Music] yes [Music] the world [Music] you can take this world but give me jesus i'll turn it back [Music] yes [Music] me [Music] no turning back turning back all turning back [Music] this morning [Music] do [Music] you
