[47:20] bless this word
[47:22] Sanctified to our hearts
[47:27] is
[47:30] a pleasure
[47:32] or any worldly pleasure but we come to
[47:37] hear from you
[47:38] the Living Word Lord
[47:41] behind the veil yeah
[48:22] in the name of the Lord
[48:25] amen amen
[48:27] it was a song
[48:31] man amen I like to say tonight
[48:35] that often time we failed
[48:39] who we really are the difference
[48:43] because of the pool of the world
[48:47] because of its influences of course this
[48:51] is in fiance we sometimes forget
[48:56] in my time with the Lord last week
[49:01] the Lord showed me I had forgotten one
[49:03] thing
[49:06] that mattered really matter important
[49:10] would change my life
[49:23] when God began to show me the love that
[49:26] he had for me
[49:31] it has been overwhelming it
[49:35] is something do I need this
[49:47] thank you
[49:54] when you really see the love of God
[49:57] as I expressed uh Sunday in a small
[50:01] portion
[50:04] how that God so loved us come on June
[50:09] now I'm not talking about
[50:12] those who want to pretend to be
[50:14] Christians
[50:16] but I'm talking to Christians
[50:20] uh you know the prophet of God taught us
[50:24] there are three kinds of Believers
[50:28] the believer the make-believer and the
[50:33] unbeliever
[50:35] uh but you need to know who you are
[50:39] and a True Believer
[50:42] says Amen to the word
[50:45] hallelujah the True Believer comes to
[50:49] understand who he is
[50:53] and when it comes to the love of God
[50:57] I I think about his goodness
[51:01] I think about all that he has done
[51:05] you know it's always good to talk about
[51:08] God to other Christians
[51:11] because sometimes other Christians can
[51:14] say things
[51:15] that could really bless your soul
[51:19] I was talking with a precious brother
[51:23] and we were talking about the Seal of
[51:26] God
[51:27] and he was saying you know it was
[51:30] amazing
[51:32] how in the olden days
[51:40] uh once the king put his seal on
[51:43] something
[51:45] the law in itself could not be changed
[51:49] well you know I had heard that
[51:52] I have preached that
[51:55] but there was something that I left out
[51:59] because brother Branham says that we the
[52:03] bride
[52:05] do some silly before the foundation of
[52:09] the world
[52:11] and in the King's day no matter what
[52:15] arrives
[52:19] he could not even change his own laws
[52:24] so those of us who have the Seal of God
[52:29] God cannot change his laws
[52:35] right and this is the reason why
[52:39] brother Branham teaches us that the true
[52:43] bride of Christ is Justified as though
[52:47] she's never sinned in the first place
[52:50] we are about our father's businesses
[53:02] amen we know that God speaks
[53:12] [Applause]
[53:22] that has been the problems with many
[53:27] people they're two corners
[53:32] but when you come to church you're not
[53:35] coming to see flesh
[53:38] even Peter said
[53:41] we don't know Jesus after the flesh
[53:44] anymore we know him after the spirit
[54:04] it doesn't matter what position they may
[54:07] have going to church when you discern
[54:10] the spirit
[54:13] you see of God or not
[54:15] Hallelujah and we Fellowship in the
[54:20] spirit
[54:20] so understand
[54:22] when you become a Christian you're no
[54:26] longer a fleshly man
[54:28] you are a spiritual man
[54:36] that you've never seen William Bradley
[54:44] on the inside
[54:46] Hallelujah is that right the real you is
[54:51] on the inside
[54:54] Hallelujah that's why I read that
[54:57] scripture
[54:58] a body thou hath prepared um
[55:02] Hallelujah because when the carnal man
[55:06] uh when he saw Jesus
[55:09] he saw a Man from Nazareth
[55:13] and and that's the scripture says can
[55:16] any good thing come from Nazareth but
[55:19] what they didn't understand
[55:21] he didn't come from Nazareth
[55:24] he came from God
[55:27] so anyway let's move on
[55:29] a body that I have prepared and so
[55:33] understand
[55:34] the whole purpose of God
[55:37] was to multiply himself
[55:41] God become man
[55:45] and so God became man in Jesus the
[55:50] fullness of the godhead bodily
[55:53] in here
[55:56] you might say well that was Jesus well
[55:59] let's come to our day we had a man by
[56:02] the name of William Bradley is that
[56:05] right and God brought him to a maturity
[56:09] in other words the divine nature
[56:12] dwells in that man
[56:16] and he God used him as a wave sheep
[56:21] y'all know what I'm talking about to
[56:23] show that there were others to come now
[56:26] I don't know about
[56:29] but I'm one of them
[56:32] Hallelujah and he came to make us see
[56:36] that this world in itself is just
[56:42] fertilizer
[56:46] I wanted to say the other word
[56:48] but it's just manure amazes
[56:52] and you and I have been planted
[56:55] in this manure don't don't sit there to
[56:58] bring forth
[57:00] the best we could bring forth
[57:04] and this is why God shows us
[57:08] to be planted in the worst age ever
[57:14] Hallelujah in other words the more
[57:18] potent the manure the the foreign
[57:57] and I can't tell you the paragraph
[57:59] somehow I don't have that on there
[58:03] but here he says you don't know Christ
[58:06] by Hallelujah
[58:11] you don't know Christ by dancing in the
[58:15] spirit
[58:17] that's an attribute you don't know
[58:21] Christ by knowing him he said excuse me
[58:24] you know Christ by knowing him as a
[58:27] person
[58:28] let's come into your heart
[58:31] in the form of the Holy Ghost
[58:34] and taken your sins away
[58:38] and planted
[58:42] in a resurrected Lord Jesus Christ
[58:46] did you hear that now he said an undying
[58:50] faith
[58:51] not in yourself
[58:54] Hallelujah but in a resurrected Lord
[58:58] Jesus Christ
[59:08] but find a new book to change
[59:14] from the creature that you once won
[59:18] he said that's how you know him
[59:21] Hallelujah he said then you dance in the
[59:24] spirit I love you don't see on this then
[59:27] you can clap your hair
[59:29] or whatever emotion that the Lord put
[59:32] upon you know
[59:34] that's afterwards
[59:37] but you can have that without having him
[59:50] and you know it is
[59:52] what kind of life it makes you live
[59:56] [Music]
[59:58] you have the believer
[1:00:03] and how do we tell the difference
[1:00:06] between the trees
[1:00:14] Hallelujah
[1:00:17] am I too loud oh too fast okay
[1:00:23] my wife be looking out for Frank
[1:00:27] he says uh it makes you live family
[1:00:30] listen what the word says here
[1:00:32] by the love
[1:00:35] and the faith that's in your heart to
[1:00:38] him
[1:00:42] and until
[1:00:43] you can see the love of God for you
[1:00:48] you'll never be able to
[1:00:50] give the love of God to others
[1:00:53] y'all better hear what I'm saying
[1:00:57] because he loved you he loved me
[1:01:02] unconditionally
[1:01:04] what are you talking about see that's
[1:01:07] what Abraham coming it is
[1:01:15] but the True Blood of Christ does not
[1:01:18] take it for granted she doesn't live to
[1:01:22] be saved
[1:01:23] she lives because she is saying
[1:01:27] hallelujah y'all understand me because
[1:01:30] listen
[1:01:31] if you're trying to escape Hell
[1:01:35] by becoming a Christian you're not a
[1:01:39] Christian yet
[1:01:41] oh
[1:01:43] yeah man that's the truth see because
[1:01:45] you have the wrong motive
[1:01:47] you have the wrong objectives
[1:01:51] Hallelujah you gotta love God would it
[1:01:55] be a major the first commandment is what
[1:01:57] love the Lord thy God
[1:02:00] with all your heart with all your mind
[1:02:03] with all your soul
[1:02:04] it's about loving God
[1:02:07] if you love me he said you will keep my
[1:02:11] Commandments
[1:02:13] it's not what I'm scared to go to hell
[1:02:20] Hallelujah
[1:02:44] and if you're Abraham's child
[1:02:47] you have Abraham's faith
[1:02:50] for that's what make him a servant of
[1:02:54] Christ
[1:02:56] Hallelujah is that all right now one
[1:02:59] thing I love about this word
[1:03:02] because it corrects us
[1:03:04] and a lot of times people don't like
[1:03:07] corrections
[1:03:08] but I come to the word for Corrections
[1:03:12] God to tell me what I'm doing wrong
[1:03:17] y'all hear what I'm saying I tell people
[1:03:20] I don't want no trouble at the river
[1:03:23] is coming down
[1:03:31] not because I fear him but because I
[1:03:35] love him
[1:03:38] amen
[1:03:40] Hallelujah
[1:03:45] coming from
[1:03:47] the message his unfailing Word of
[1:03:50] Promise
[1:03:53] paragraph 57.
[1:03:58] the word always correct the error
[1:04:03] and if you people could only see it
[1:04:06] today
[1:04:08] the word corrects the error
[1:04:12] the whole thing is becoming an error
[1:04:16] but God's word is what is right
[1:04:20] he said Heaven and Earth will pass away
[1:04:25] we shall not passion
[1:04:28] you know why we fail God at times
[1:04:41] he is God Amen he's the only potentate
[1:04:48] only Authority
[1:04:51] rules
[1:04:53] [Music]
[1:04:54] is that right like I said the other day
[1:04:58] I said even the devil has to ask for
[1:05:02] permission
[1:05:03] Hallelujah is that right even when the
[1:05:07] devil wanted those demons wanted to go
[1:05:10] into into those pigs
[1:05:17] they had to ask for from permission
[1:05:20] when Lucifer or Satan
[1:05:23] walk the heavens and God was there he
[1:05:28] had to ask for permission
[1:05:31] Hallelujah to go down and temp job
[1:05:36] and God no knew that job was a True
[1:05:40] Believer
[1:05:43] he knew he was God hallelujah
[1:05:47] see that's when God brings a test when
[1:05:50] he know that you know that he is God
[1:05:53] hallelujah because when you know that he
[1:05:56] is God
[1:05:57] you stand on his words
[1:06:04] amen you think about Paul
[1:06:06] when that angel said
[1:06:09] don't jump out of this boat
[1:06:12] in order for you to remain safe
[1:06:17] you got to stay on the ship
[1:06:20] can you imagine
[1:06:21] and you saw a little probably had little
[1:06:24] life jackets or something you know
[1:06:25] something to help him out but if you if
[1:06:29] you get off of this boat
[1:06:33] why because I'm on it and whatever God
[1:06:37] is
[1:06:39] safety yeah
[1:06:41] Hallelujah
[1:06:43] what about the Hebrew boys
[1:06:50] and they knew they couldn't afford to
[1:06:52] bow down to nothing else
[1:06:58] when you are afflicted with sickness
[1:07:01] yes the devil had to go to God
[1:07:24] anytime you act against the the promise
[1:07:28] of God
[1:07:29] you are now an unbelievable
[1:07:36] when you come up for prayer he said God
[1:07:40] will allow the anointing to fall
[1:07:44] his presence
[1:07:47] and then afterwards he will allow the
[1:07:50] devil to make you sicker
[1:07:53] Hallelujah but what do you believe
[1:07:56] if you say oh I'm getting sicker
[1:08:00] at that moment you are a non-believer
[1:08:04] [Music]
[1:08:05] hello
[1:08:18] [Music]
[1:08:35] that's nonsense it's nonsense when you
[1:08:38] delivered you're going to be tempted
[1:08:41] that's why the Bible says you're not to
[1:08:44] Temptation
[1:08:45] Hallelujah Jesus was tempted but he
[1:08:50] didn't yield Hallelujah
[1:08:53] [Music]
[1:08:54] the damn shame you ain't delivered
[1:08:56] because you got the battles in your mind
[1:08:58] the devil is alive
[1:09:09] won't forget it
[1:09:12] I don't care how much holios you got
[1:09:15] the flesh never forgets
[1:09:20] and that devil will come and try to
[1:09:23] deceived to make you disbelieve the word
[1:09:28] so he can hold you in captivity
[1:09:35] Hallelujah but if you're true see
[1:09:38] you don't give up you're coming again
[1:09:41] Hallelujah is that right Hallelujah
[1:09:45] because one thing of a true seed
[1:09:48] run from the battles
[1:09:55] oh my what are you saying see when you
[1:09:59] realize you're the temple you understand
[1:10:02] God ain't just in heaven but God is in
[1:10:05] you
[1:10:06] Hallelujah David recognized that God was
[1:10:10] with him
[1:10:18] Hallelujah y'all hear what I'm saying if
[1:10:21] that's what he told Brother Branham if
[1:10:23] you want the people to believe
[1:10:26] what things become possible
[1:10:29] y'all hear what I'm saying God In the
[1:10:32] Flesh now that he's gone God wants to
[1:10:36] occupy your flesh
[1:10:40] he wants you as the temple of God
[1:10:43] hallelujah is that right and the word
[1:10:47] let me finish this quote please
[1:10:52] and the word that is prophesied for this
[1:10:54] day correctly
[1:10:57] era of this the day he said you
[1:11:00] understand the word itself corrects the
[1:11:05] people today
[1:11:26] [Music]
[1:11:40] that's the message
[1:11:44] Hallelujah
[1:11:47] oh
[1:11:49] see that's an error and the word comes
[1:11:52] back who directs that error by
[1:11:56] identifying itself
[1:11:59] the hour and the time of the hour
[1:12:02] now we know those things are true
[1:12:07] in other words if you had been in the
[1:12:10] Pentecostal age
[1:12:19] all of that steel is okay
[1:12:22] we have come up higher
[1:12:31] what God wants to see tonight
[1:12:34] he wants to see amateur Gods he wants to
[1:12:39] see Messiah
[1:12:40] obviously
[1:12:41] not bad just words
[1:12:47] we need the mechanics and the Dynamics
[1:12:52] Hallelujah
[1:12:53] we'll pass the intellectual Revival
[1:13:00] he wants to talk through your eyes he
[1:13:04] wants to walk through your eyes he wants
[1:13:07] to do everything he can through you and
[1:13:10] by you Hallelujah
[1:13:15] it's not on your own accord
[1:13:17] Jesus said I can't do nothing
[1:13:20] unless I see the father show me I'm one
[1:13:22] because it's the number you see so
[1:13:24] everything is being led by the spirit of
[1:13:26] God but if you don't have the spirit of
[1:13:29] God you can't be led by this time
[1:13:32] not in the proper way
[1:13:35] see man is designed even in the his
[1:13:38] makeup
[1:13:40] and I know we know this
[1:13:44] really Express this to you
[1:13:46] when God designs
[1:13:49] the temple on Earth
[1:13:54] he was actually designing that Temple
[1:13:58] according to the way man is made
[1:14:01] Hallelujah
[1:14:04] in other words
[1:14:06] the four living creatures Hallelujah
[1:14:11] amen God at the throne room is that
[1:14:15] right
[1:14:17] Hallelujah and we have the heart that
[1:14:21] actually have four chambers
[1:14:23] but we didn't know where the throne room
[1:14:26] was
[1:14:27] until brother Branham that even the
[1:14:30] science is safe there's a place in your
[1:14:34] heart by the size of a pinhead yeah
[1:14:38] where there are no blood vessels
[1:14:41] and the problem God says that's where
[1:14:45] God dwells
[1:14:47] Hallelujah so when we say fill me up
[1:14:51] Lord
[1:14:53] God need to do is feel you
[1:15:17] they say we're going to be the greatest
[1:15:19] of all he Powers
[1:15:21] [Music]
[1:15:29] is that right is that right because
[1:15:33] really the scripture says we have the
[1:15:38] mind of Christ but until you believe
[1:15:41] that you gotta see that the mind of
[1:15:45] Christ is already in you
[1:15:54] [Music]
[1:16:15] that demon gonna rule them
[1:16:20] right some of y'all may have not seen it
[1:16:23] but even in the coldness of the winter
[1:16:28] here in Iowa Iowa you'll find people on
[1:16:32] the outside
[1:16:36] but smoking a cigarette
[1:16:41] they'll have no control
[1:16:43] and all I can think about
[1:16:45] the devil can't control a man like that
[1:16:49] what about the Living God
[1:16:53] hey that's what God wants this is good
[1:16:56] dreams he wants to control us
[1:17:01] Paul said I'm a prisoner of Christ I
[1:17:03] want to be a prisoner
[1:17:07] of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:17:09] let me go on so we got the four living
[1:17:12] creatures the heart has four chambers
[1:17:15] and in the midst of those four chambers
[1:17:17] it's a space where there are no blood
[1:17:20] vessels
[1:17:21] brother Adam said that this was a throne
[1:17:24] room
[1:17:25] Hallelujah that's where God dwells then
[1:17:29] you have the 24 elders
[1:17:32] and then you got those 24 ribs
[1:17:35] that protects us the heart
[1:17:37] and the 24 Elders are 24 tribes
[1:17:42] the 12 tribes excuse me of Israel what
[1:17:45] did they do they protected
[1:17:48] hallelujah what is the 12 apostles do
[1:17:51] they get they protect the Ark of the
[1:17:53] Covenant the real one
[1:17:55] Jesus Christ so much so we call it the
[1:17:58] apostolic Doctrine
[1:18:00] Hallelujah is that right yeah so the 12
[1:18:04] 24 ribs
[1:18:59] [Music]
[1:19:04] where God take that anger
[1:19:07] ignorance
[1:19:09] the laws of denominationalism
[1:19:14] we depended on his grace
[1:19:34] [Music]
[1:19:38] she was not beating the company to see
[1:19:41] the go to see the king
[1:19:44] everybody
[1:19:48] kill you but as amen
[1:19:56] [Music]
[1:20:15] you know the keys
[1:20:31] Hallelujah amen see but we forget
[1:20:37] we forget
[1:20:38] I'll never leave you
[1:20:41] um
[1:20:45] because we often go by our feelings
[1:20:56] Faith call those things
[1:21:03] [Applause]
[1:21:04] Hallelujah education
[1:21:10] to our newcomers
[1:21:11] you're going to have some opposition
[1:21:14] but know you the king's daughters and
[1:21:17] sons
[1:21:22] hallelujah amen I mean David just had a
[1:21:25] one stone but he used it wasn't nothing
[1:21:28] yeah
[1:21:32] when you when you when you ask God for
[1:21:35] anything
[1:21:36] believe that he is given to you you
[1:21:40] can't let circumstances change your mind
[1:21:47] those are the things that amazes me um
[1:22:13] [Music]
[1:22:23] back to the Sons and Daughters of God
[1:22:35] put things under our feet
[1:22:39] but you gotta know who's in the house
[1:22:43] [Music]
[1:22:44] Hallelujah
[1:22:48] so we know that
[1:22:50] brother random said that now
[1:22:54] we come to the eye age which is the
[1:22:56] intelligence age which is
[1:23:02] the intelligence but understand we have
[1:23:06] the mind of course
[1:23:08] Adam had the mind of Christ
[1:23:15] anymore because God had already named
[1:23:18] them
[1:23:19] he caught the thought of God
[1:23:22] name those atoms uh animals according to
[1:23:25] the thought of God
[1:23:30] and when you this is why it's so
[1:23:31] important to pray well of course it was
[1:23:33] important because in your prayers
[1:23:36] God will take you somewhere
[1:23:40] Hallelujah the creation of man was in
[1:23:43] the image and likeness of God
[1:23:47] created a spirit man
[1:23:50] this was the true image of God
[1:23:55] this man was created as an amateur God
[1:24:01] he was God of the Earth but there was
[1:24:04] still a greater God there was God
[1:24:08] hallelujah amen right so the man in
[1:24:12] Genesis 1 26.
[1:24:14] it was his theophany
[1:24:17] is that right
[1:24:21] to rule those animals
[1:24:25] be seen by the natural eyes
[1:24:30] to move those animals animals the way he
[1:24:32] won he wanted to so
[1:24:36] Hallelujah and then God took that man
[1:24:39] and put him in flesh yeah and he stood
[1:24:43] like a tree like the prophet said
[1:24:48] in there
[1:24:57] will have authority
[1:25:00] still had rules Adam didn't make a
[1:25:04] mistake
[1:25:05] Adam willfully said
[1:25:07] he was going to do it because he said
[1:25:12] this um
[1:25:18] will leave her mother and father
[1:25:22] to her husband there was no such thing
[1:25:26] as a mother and father
[1:25:28] could not have been a mother and father
[1:25:32] McCain
[1:25:35] we would have been just sisters and
[1:25:37] brothers
[1:25:39] and that's what we'll be after the
[1:25:42] Fallen
[1:25:54] that's the way it was supposed to be
[1:25:57] Hallelujah
[1:26:07] the very designer man
[1:26:11] showed what God intent was
[1:26:14] in the beginning
[1:26:17] he will he he would Tabernacle in the
[1:26:20] body
[1:26:23] God himself
[1:26:25] Hallelujah had not if Adam had not
[1:26:28] Fallen
[1:26:30] we would all come in a different ways
[1:26:35] but Jesus Christ the second Adam
[1:26:42] he was a word
[1:26:58] put everything back in Hallelujah
[1:27:12] now I'm gonna tell you something
[1:27:14] brother had definitely a unique gift
[1:27:17] foreign
[1:27:45] so you gotta understand
[1:27:47] what God is doing God is now identifying
[1:27:52] himself
[1:28:06] this is where God is bringing us
[1:28:21] hallelujah amen
[1:28:33] [Music]
[1:28:42] [Music]
[1:28:52] a party
[1:29:00] and in turn this would give will will
[1:29:02] birthday
[1:29:10] if that's not right
[1:29:12] because when the foolish virgin came to
[1:29:15] knock on the doors
[1:29:19] and they knew they couldn't get it
[1:29:23] and you know what the wise version told
[1:29:25] him yeah
[1:29:44] Hallelujah amen and when you knock on
[1:29:47] the door and here's the door
[1:29:50] opens the door and invite you here
[1:29:54] so the open door hello
[1:30:06] that's why brother Branham says I must
[1:30:09] lay in the presence
[1:30:15] don't let it become common to you
[1:30:19] whatever you do don't let him pause
[1:30:25] is this okay
[1:30:27] Hallelujah man so you understand where
[1:30:30] I'm coming from
[1:30:33] mature I mean
[1:30:35] Mark 11 17. you don't have to turn there
[1:30:39] but when Jesus was rebuking them in the
[1:30:42] house of God in the synagogue
[1:30:53] my house should be called The House of
[1:30:55] Prayer
[1:30:58] you that was just in Shadow and type
[1:31:02] supposed to be called the house
[1:31:07] but we find out that even in this
[1:31:09] message
[1:31:15] people get scared to say that let me
[1:31:19] tell you it ain't the message
[1:31:21] it's the thieves
[1:31:24] is that right people have gotten filthy
[1:31:28] rich
[1:31:29] [Music]
[1:31:32] okay
[1:32:11] that's just the way they are
[1:32:13] and it's not right people is it bad
[1:32:15] corrector think about what this message
[1:32:18] could do
[1:32:19] if the preachers would get together
[1:32:24] in such a way we will take care of the
[1:32:28] Ministries
[1:32:38] but the commission has never stopped
[1:32:42] Hallelujah is that right is it right he
