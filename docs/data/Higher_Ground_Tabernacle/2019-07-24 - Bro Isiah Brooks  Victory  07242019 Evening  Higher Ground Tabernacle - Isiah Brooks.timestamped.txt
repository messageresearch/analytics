[18:47] man that trusted in him and that
[18:53] wonderful let us go to I'm sorry let's

[19:20] understand that they that seek the Lord
[19:25] shall not want for any good thing Psalms
[19:31] 59 it is a battle it is times are hard
[19:38] but you know what God never for circles
[19:41] he never will forsake us whether you
[19:45] feel him or not he sees everything the
[19:48] Bible says that he even knows the hairs
[19:50] that's on your head
[19:51] I appreciate the Lord Jesus amen in the
[19:57] midst of my trial
[19:58] and in the midst of my test I can still
[20:01] praise the Lord
[20:03] Psalms 59 16 through 17 but I was seeing
[20:09] of the power of that power yeah I was
[20:12] sing aloud of thy mercy in the morning
[20:14] but thou has been my defense and refuge
[20:19] in the day of my trouble unto thee O my
[20:24] strength will I sing for God is my Rhett
[20:27] my defence and the God of my mercy
[20:33] that was pretty father God we thank you
[20:38] for your amazing grace we thank you for
[20:42] being so good to us
[20:44] you have been better to us and we are
[20:47] into ourselves and Lord there are no
[20:50] words to express our gratitude we thank
[20:54] you for the victory or God in my
[20:56] brother's sean's it was life the Lord we
[21:00] thank you for how you had him sitting up
[21:02] eating and breathing and different
[21:05] exercises they gave him Lord and what a
[21:08] good report father just we pray we know
[21:13] that you've answered our prayer and
[21:15] father we do see the sweet victories we
[21:18] pray tonight that you continue to
[21:20] strengthen his family and bless Lord God
[21:23] our brother Conley sister Lord
[21:27] strengthen her body and lord I pray that
[21:30] you would quicken something in her soul
[21:32] that she would desire salvation how
[21:35] mercy upon us Lord we are a needy people
[21:38] and father we pray that your mercy and
[21:41] grace be upon us in Jesus Christ's name
[21:43] we pray amen you may be seated
[21:52] I really feel that often time we don't
[21:58] get the victory that we would get from
[22:04] the Lord because of our attitude God
[22:10] cannot operate and worry he only
[22:14] operates by faith and the Bible says
[22:17] without faith it's impossible to please
[22:19] God as I was stuttering studying today I
[22:25] ran across the scripture also in Psalm
[22:29] 71 and 7 it says I am as a wonder unto
[22:35] many but thou art my strong refuge Allah
[22:40] I like that people may understand not
[22:45] understand my my disposition and and
[22:49] they may wonder how I can go on and I'm
[22:52] not perfect in that way I'm just saying
[22:55] many don't understand the smiles and the
[22:59] joy that I have especially unsaved
[23:03] people but they fail to see that they
[23:05] there is a refuge it's not that the
[23:09] storms are not raging is that I have
[23:12] found that hiding place and that is
[23:16] trusting God it says let my mouth be
[23:21] filled with I praise and with I honor
[23:25] all the day as I was thinking about the
[23:32] time and error that we're living in this
[23:34] is the finale this is it there's not
[23:40] coming something greater than that fact
[23:44] we are in the place of God's judgement
[23:47] when time will be no more we're at the
[23:51] end of it and to know that God has given
[23:55] us grace to even consider our plans ever
[24:00] coming to pass it's okay we supposed to
[24:05] work we
[24:06] supposed to continue but in the midst of
[24:09] all that we plan to do we must realize
[24:13] that this may not happen Christ may come
[24:19] before it's all over and we with that
[24:23] attitude
[24:25] God can further our progression in
[24:30] whatever field of life we may be in
[24:34] because we are aware that everything
[24:38] else is temporal there are two forces at
[24:42] work and these forces are have been
[24:46] battling from before time we call it
[24:51] good we call it evil you and I must
[24:54] understand that there are two kingdoms
[24:58] there's a Satan's Kingdom and there's
[25:03] God's kingdom and these two kingdoms
[25:06] have thought before time but you know
[25:11] you and I must understand that these
[25:14] there's one of the one of these kingdoms
[25:17] cannot continue one kingdom is eternal
[25:21] and the other one a man has been
[25:25] everlasting but it comes to an end it
[25:29] has range Satan has has deceived mankind
[25:34] for thousands of years
[25:38] he was put it this way even Eve was no
[25:42] match for the devil it was had you
[25:47] understand that now had he gone amen to
[25:50] Adam it would have been a masculine part
[25:54] of him it would have been a different
[25:56] story but but Eve because of her makeup
[25:59] was basically the weaker vessel now you
[26:04] said why are you saying this because
[26:06] amen we understand that Satan at this
[26:10] point in time appears to have dominion
[26:13] Satan has no dominion now not to the
[26:19] belief
[26:20] but to the world he dominates everything
[26:24] the governments are in Satan's control
[26:28] y'all know that right even at the time
[26:32] when Jesus was being tempted in the
[26:34] wilderness Satan offered Jesus the world
[26:38] if you bow down to me I will give you
[26:42] the whole of the kingdoms and of course
[26:45] Jesus Christ who is the son of God who
[26:49] is God who was the fullness of God amen
[26:52] understood that he was not here to
[26:55] accept some handout but the the world at
[27:00] large the universe everything that had
[27:02] fallen had to come by way of this battle
[27:05] and this battle had to be fought and the
[27:09] victory was sure to be won
[27:11] you understand me so we know that Jesus
[27:15] Christ knew that that at some point in
[27:19] time Satan was going to lose everything
[27:22] he thought he had and everything that he
[27:26] thought he had would be returned back to
[27:29] Jesus and Jesus Christ would reign
[27:32] forever there is a kingdom and the Bible
[27:35] tells us that the kingdom of God cannot
[27:38] be moved you have heard me say at times
[27:43] that because of the fall we understand
[27:48] the fall the battle started in heaven
[27:50] and we understand by God's grace that
[27:54] the battle was brought from heaven down
[27:56] to earth and Eve and Adam open the door
[27:59] and I took that battle and when that
[28:02] battle began to rage it raised in the
[28:04] mind of men the greatest battle ever
[28:07] fought is in the mind of the man why
[28:11] because he has to make a choice between
[28:15] two he must choose faith or reasoning
[28:19] and this is why you can see why
[28:23] Satan's science has become God because
[28:28] this is Satan's Eden he actually
[28:30] introduced science to Eve
[28:33] because you must understand that the the
[28:37] reproduction of mankind was not supposed
[28:40] to come by way of sex it was to come by
[28:43] the spoken word of God which would have
[28:46] been by faith God would have told Adam
[28:49] and Eve what he wanted and they would
[28:52] have produced what they wanted what he
[28:55] wanted you understand me
[28:57] but he taught Adam and Eve science by
[29:01] way of sex if you do this you plant the
[29:05] seed here and you'll bring forth the
[29:06] crop right so I'm saying all of that to
[29:10] say that since that fall science science
[29:14] watch it from Genesis all the way up to
[29:17] now when the serpent seed began to
[29:19] multiply they'd get deep they built
[29:21] buildings they had the music they had
[29:23] all of these great things and Here Come
[29:25] Nimrod and then he what did he he was a
[29:28] reflection I was Satan was trying to do
[29:31] build his kingdom on the earth right and
[29:35] then what God did he comes down and he
[29:38] confuses them rod and then he also what
[29:41] separates the whole entire world for the
[29:45] purpose of his gospel you understand me
[29:50] because as long as they were united man
[29:53] could do anything that he imagined to do
[29:57] that's the word his imagination became a
[30:00] reality he was just that smart he was
[30:03] just fallen he meant from amen a perfect
[30:09] state so he had a good mind he had good
[30:12] imagination and Satan was gonna make
[30:14] sure and then this this thing that's
[30:17] Lucifer amen was trying to develop and
[30:20] and and and bring about what happened so
[30:25] I'm coming to this in just a minute so
[30:28] you must understand from that point on
[30:30] Satan had the keys of death hell and the
[30:34] grave and he conquered by that people
[30:38] fear death right they filled here filled
[30:41] his fear feared hell and and so he ruled
[30:46] I fear and you can see that that's what
[30:49] he did look at Nimrod Nimrod was a
[30:51] forcing system it was a system Amen that
[30:54] went out to conquer right it's the same
[30:57] thing in the church ages the white horse
[31:00] came out it looked like an angel it
[31:03] looked like God it looked like Christ
[31:05] and the whole time it was the Antichrist
[31:07] going about to conquer what was it what
[31:11] was it over here the conquering in the
[31:14] conquest was in the natural but now
[31:16] Satan over on the other side began to
[31:19] conquer in the spirit the understanding
[31:23] and he was bringing this thing to a
[31:25] place where he would be crowned king Oh
[31:29] somebody help me here see and what well
[31:32] you and I must understand Amen that God
[31:36] allows Satan do a lot of things only for
[31:39] his own glory he said why why didn't you
[31:42] know the brother Adam he brings it out
[31:44] he said before God could be a healer
[31:46] there had to be somebody sick before God
[31:48] can be a deliverer there had to be
[31:50] somebody that needed deliverance
[31:51] so we realized Amen all of these things
[31:54] that Lucifer would do by way of men is
[31:59] that right
[32:00] he is the god of this world he is the
[32:04] one a man that that chooses his
[32:08] leadership's his leaders gotta raise him
[32:13] up but Lucifer chooses them and you must
[32:16] understand a man that that his whole
[32:18] plan is to do what he said in his equal
[32:21] I believe he said you know I would have
[32:23] sin and I say I will my throne above the
[32:26] stars of God as Isaiah but nevertheless
[32:30] brother Brown said he did just what he
[32:34] said he was going to do he conquered man
[32:37] and now we are living in an age where
[32:40] Satan is being worship hello how do you
[32:46] know you worshipping the devil when you
[32:50] off his word I'm saying again Satan how
[32:55] do you know when you're worshiping the
[32:57] devil is when you off the word
[33:01] as long as Eve stayed with the word she
[33:06] was worshiping God but the moment she
[33:09] added aloud the devil to take away it
[33:12] was no longer a worship of God it was a
[33:15] worship of the devil came by reasoning
[33:18] is this right now I will say this by
[33:21] God's grace amen coming from the
[33:23] adoption for where the RAM said now this
[33:26] may just choke you to death but did you
[33:30] know that men that our sons of God are a
[33:34] mature God's how many ever know that how
[33:38] many know that Jesus says so the Bible
[33:42] said did you did not your laws say
[33:44] itself that ye are gods and if you call
[33:48] them gods which God said in Genesis 2
[33:50] that they were gods because they were
[33:53] had full dominion over the Dominion of
[33:57] the world he give him dominion over all
[34:00] things and he lost his God ship he lost
[34:05] his sonship he lost his domain and Satan
[34:10] took over but brother we are waiting for
[34:15] the manifestation of the sons of God who
[34:19] will come back and take it over again
[34:23] waiting for the fullness of time when
[34:26] the pyramid gets up to the top when the
[34:29] full sons of God will be manifested and
[34:32] when God when the power of God will walk
[34:34] out hallelujah and will take every power
[34:37] that Satan's got away from him yes sir
[34:41] it belongs to him and understand that
[34:47] his domain only it's powerful in this
[34:53] dimension since Calvary there's a time
[34:59] before Calvary he kept us in captivity
[35:02] but the Bible said that when Jesus a man
[35:05] rose from the dead he led captivity
[35:08] captive and gave gifts unto me
[35:12] hallelujah he freed all of those who his
[35:17] blood had purchased somebody help me
[35:20] here she because what the devil didn't
[35:23] understand is that no matter how much he
[35:25] put us in the grave he could not stop
[35:28] the kingdom of God he could not stop the
[35:32] Empire in which God was building Oh help
[35:36] me here because you must realize Amen
[35:39] that god we don't know what it was like
[35:41] we can't remember but before the fall
[35:43] there was an empire that God had oh yeah
[35:48] he was king of kings he was a Lord of
[35:51] lords hallelujah and Lucifer was his
[35:54] right hand man
[35:55] but the Bible and the Bible tells us
[35:57] that Lucifer wanted a greater Kingdom
[36:00] than Micah the Word of God says it made
[36:03] and what happened so if Lucifer one of
[36:08] the greater kingdom that means Micah had
[36:11] a kingdom hallelujah and we know that
[36:14] Mike is who Christ
[36:17] perhaps that's his that was his name
[36:19] during the time because as God unfolds
[36:22] himself he changes his names hallelujah
[36:26] that's why the foolish virgin won't be
[36:29] able to get in because when God changes
[36:32] his name they won't know what it is
[36:35] hello brother BAM said a knock on the
[36:38] door Jesus Jesus Jesus and he said they
[36:42] won't get nothing hmm.you they all L
[36:47] know him L know him L know him but
[36:49] that's not the name is gone by neither
[36:51] is there salvation under heaven given
[36:55] among men whereby we must be saved in
[36:58] that that name Amen is under heaven but
[37:02] what God is finished redemption that
[37:07] name will change now we don't know what
[37:10] it is yet but the bride will know whoo
[37:15] [Music]
[37:16] hallelujah now the Jews will have to
[37:19] know that name because that's the
[37:22] Redemption day but when redemption is
[37:25] for the bride she receives a new name
[37:29] hello somebody you see we must
[37:32] understand that no matter what we go
[37:35] through why are you saying it like that
[37:37] brother Brooks remember so you can
[37:39] understand there was an empire and it
[37:40] still is an empire there's still little
[37:42] great Kingdom and there still you know
[37:44] warfare is that right hit men went
[37:47] Daniel prayed God said I sent my co down
[37:49] there and he fought for you 21 days war
[37:53] was going on in the unseen when Saul
[37:57] Samuel died Amen in the Witch of Endor
[38:00] called him up called her up what was
[38:02] Samuel he was a prophet hello
[38:06] so all of that he's feeling prophet
[38:09] she's nothing not even death hell and
[38:12] the grave can stop God's Word from
[38:15] coming to pass hallelujah you said we're
[38:22] brothers what are you saying don't you
[38:23] understand we do not go through the
[38:25] white throne judgment we don't be judge
[38:27] you know what we have a we have a
[38:30] ceremony listen to the six healed we
[38:33] have at least 60 or 50 whichever was he
[38:35] said listen he said it's not a judgement
[38:38] when I found myself climbing up those
[38:39] those are ivory steps he said it was not
[38:43] like a judgment it was a ceremonial of
[38:45] for rewards that's what we go through we
[38:49] go before him to receive our rewards
[38:52] you're in heaven already he's not gonna
[38:55] kick you out Oh somebody help me oh my
[39:02] listen so you must understand no matter
[39:05] what you go through Christ has already
[39:08] delivered you somebody help me sir true
[39:14] if your name was written in the book
[39:17] before the lamb that in the blimp of the
[39:19] life before the world began if you were
[39:22] saying before then if he was sealed
[39:24] before then you were delivered before
[39:27] the end you was healed before this
[39:30] y'all understand me everything was done
[39:33] before you got here that's what makes it
[39:38] so real because I was perfect back there
[39:42] therefore I'm perfect now in the eyes of
[39:45] God I'm perfect
[39:47] no matter what it looks like no matter
[39:49] what the devil calls you no matter what
[39:51] you look like
[39:52] that's not the way God said you are
[39:55] blood wash bride justified as though you
[39:59] never sinned in the first place now if
[40:02] we can live like that we'll put the
[40:05] devil on the run our problem is that we
[40:10] always let the guilt consciousness and
[40:11] God says listen the Holy Ghost and
[40:13] supposed to take away the guilt
[40:15] consciousness what you feeling guilty
[40:17] about the Word of God said you were
[40:19] tricked into it you didn't mean to do it
[40:22] in the first place I received that now
[40:25] you got to receive it so when the devil
[40:30] comes you accuse me so that I can't get
[40:33] victory he is a liar you got to take the
[40:36] word of today and give it to him
[40:39] that's the key sword come on somebody
[40:41] the King sword is just not this even
[40:45] though this is the word it's a
[40:47] revelation of it and that came to
[40:50] Malachi so when you realize the
[40:53] revelation of the Lord that is the King
[40:56] sword upon this rock I'll build my
[40:59] church and the gates of Hell shall not
[41:01] prevail against it and no use in being
[41:06] sad you got the victory when God has
[41:10] challenged our chosen you for battery
[41:12] you might as well shout and have a good
[41:14] time now it's easier said than done but
[41:17] you can get in that channel may be said
[41:20] I encouraged myself in the law whoo yeah
[41:25] hallelujah coming from the power of
[41:27] anything we know as a message called the
[41:29] power of the devil
[41:31] but there's a message 1955 he said he
[41:36] he's called in the Bible Jehovah Jireh
[41:39] y'all know that name Jehovah Jireh means
[41:43] the Lord
[41:43] provide him n he said I'm so glad
[41:46] tonight to know that he still
[41:48] jehovah-jireh
[41:49] no matter what the circumstances is God
[41:52] will make a way he makes a way of escape
[41:57] he says say to me pin you in a corner
[42:00] with the cancer God will make a way of
[42:02] escape Satan they pin you down under a
[42:05] car God will make a way of escape say to
[42:09] me take your family away from you but
[42:11] God will make a way of escape
[42:13] God has away so it doesn't matter what
[42:17] it looks like how the victory look like
[42:20] Satan's got the vintage Satan has no
[42:22] victory because at Calvary he stripped
[42:25] him of every victory right the Bible
[42:30] says him he won't run a race you gotta
[42:32] run it lawfully Satan is sneaky he's a
[42:35] thief he's a murderer he doesn't ever
[42:39] play fair so God stripped him everything
[42:44] he thought he wrote what God took him
[42:46] back you didn't do it right
[42:48] how can he do it right he's a deceiver
[42:52] now a lot of times people think that
[42:55] we've got to have these great great big
[42:57] mountainous faith when Jesus said that
[43:00] if you have the faith of a mustard seed
[43:02] that must have seen as I as thoroughly
[43:04] as pure can't be hybrid it's it can't be
[43:07] mixed with any other kind of seed that's
[43:10] what he says it's one of the smallest of
[43:12] all the seeds that's all God needs you
[43:14] to have just a little bit just a little
[43:17] bit that cannot be changed just a little
[43:20] bit I like saying that just a little bit
[43:24] that's up that's right see God takes a
[43:27] little speck of faith and if you hold on
[43:30] to it he'll bring you out that's what he
[43:34] said
[43:34] ministry explained that's what he said
[43:36] if you got just the little grain of
[43:40] faith that's genuine mustard seed faith
[43:43] that won't move stay with it he'll bring
[43:46] you out he says that it shall be even as
[43:49] I was with told Moses is that fair
[43:53] enough
[43:54] that's what I say in the name of the
[43:56] Lord Jesus
[43:57] not as I claim to be anything myself I'm
[44:01] the least among you and I do not say
[44:04] that to be humble I say it from my heart
[44:08] that's brother been saying that but you
[44:12] see what made him great because he saw
[44:14] himself as the least and he says well
[44:17] I'm not saying this and then just trying
[44:22] to be humble but it is true and so when
[44:26] I read that I said that is so true if
[44:29] God can get a man or woman who can see
[44:32] themselves as the least of all he can be
[44:35] used by God it's those who are puffed up
[44:40] those who think they're great that's why
[44:42] God can't use you the way he wants to
[44:44] but he looking for somebody who's with
[44:48] you
[44:48] you know I'm nothing Lord like a
[44:50] preacher when the man the public in the
[44:52] end and then and they are sinner was out
[44:55] there the sinner excuse me there a
[44:56] Pharisee said you whatever he was he
[44:58] would say all God having that done this
[45:00] and having I've done this and having
[45:01] I've done this and here was another man
[45:03] of public of the sinner smoke his breath
[45:05] rest and say lord have mercy on me and
[45:09] Jesus said which one left out justify
[45:12] the man who knew he needed mercy mmm no
[45:17] help me in Jesus amen
[45:18] listen sweet victories I love this
[45:22] remember I'm not going to quote it all
[45:24] but let me let me just quote this part a
[45:28] marvelous thing that I've ever seen in
[45:30] my life
[45:31] it's the greatest hour of my life is
[45:33] when I get against a wall that I can't
[45:38] get over it under it or around it that's
[45:41] right and then I trust God and he opens
[45:45] the way and I go through the thing God
[45:48] takes you through it then when you can
[45:51] when you come out of the other side it's
[45:54] like Samson when you kill the lion y'all
[45:57] remember that Samson killed this lion
[45:59] and then later on he comes back by the
[46:02] lion and the lion has a honeybee hide in
[46:07] it
[46:08] hallelujah and he
[46:10] rolls in and gets the honey y'all know
[46:12] the story and he tells his wife about
[46:15] what took place and how she betrayed him
[46:17] and all that but here I thought that's
[46:19] it when this enemy comes in like a flood
[46:22] the Lord will always lift up a standard
[46:25] against him and he will make your
[46:28] greatest battle think about it here was
[46:30] Samson a young boy a young man you know
[46:34] not big in stature with huge muscles and
[46:36] my brother seems like a right a
[46:39] little small fella amen that's what made
[46:42] him so what made him a Wanda how does a
[46:44] little fella
[46:45] a man can lift up the gates of Gaza how
[46:48] he can kill a lion hallelujah with his
[46:51] bare hand it rips his mouth open how was
[46:54] it it wasn't Samson it was the anointing
[46:58] that drop on him and that's what brother
[47:00] Byrne said he's in there with that
[47:01] anointing come upon you you ought to be
[47:04] able to recognize you have the ability
[47:07] to defeat your enemy you've got the
[47:14] ability to defeat your enemies when they
[47:16] kill the lion and he got the sweetness
[47:20] honey he ever eat out of that old
[47:22] carcass of that lion I thought that's
[47:25] right every victory should end up in
[47:28] sweetness real sweet stuff when you know
[47:32] that you got that victory only because
[47:35] of God's anointing and God helped you
[47:37] out of it hallelujah how could we keep
[47:39] our mouth shut
[47:41] how could we not praise God when we see
[47:44] that God has given us everything we ever
[47:47] had when the Spirit of the Lord shows up
[47:55] hallelujah huh whoa watch out devil
[47:58] you're in for a big battle now is that
[48:01] right and that's what David rested upon
[48:04] he read he said is that right now I
[48:07] noticed my hair with oil my cup runneth
[48:10] over surely goodness and mercy shall
[48:12] follow me not sometimes but all the days
[48:16] of my life and when when Goliath came
[48:19] back he understood just another sweet
[48:22] victory
[48:23] yeah is that right he was dis anointing
[48:26] I'm talking about will not allow you be
[48:29] afraid it won't let you get nervous
[48:31] it won't make it there's no fear when
[48:35] you are in the presence of the Lord
[48:37] you understand me in the presence of the
[48:40] Lord the Bible said there's fullness of
[48:42] joy hallelujah there's a strength in it
[48:45] hallelujah David wrote about it tell me
[48:47] all of the great men of God knew about
[48:50] the anointing of the Lord hallelujah is
[48:56] that right and David respected that even
[49:00] though saw wasn't the right kind of king
[49:01] he said all my god what have I done have
[49:04] cut the the garment of the anointing of
[49:07] the Lord he knew God wasn't known had I
[49:10] known that that man at time hallelujah
[49:12] and you have to be careful is that all
[49:15] right listen think about it what I'm
[49:20] talking about when I when I'm talking
[49:21] about for sweet victories we're in the
[49:23] heat of the battle you got to learn how
[49:25] to start praising God in the meat this
[49:27] of it
[49:27] if you can't praise him you go and pray
[49:31] you understand me don't let the devil
[49:34] enjoy sadness in your life oh I just
[49:38] can't harlot make it and oh this is
[49:39] overwhelming and oh you are glorifying
[49:42] the devil you're letting the devil you a
[49:48] son of God you don't know me
[49:54] shake the devil of you know he can't
[49:58] understand when he see he can't get next
[50:00] you when you see your joy lever dropping
[50:02] you drop to your knees and pray keep him
[50:06] out of your life keep that devil out of
[50:09] your life you're here to worship God and
[50:11] not him you ought to tell her that when
[50:13] you're not getting no praise today y'all
[50:17] understand me you're not getting no
[50:19] praising and I'ma show you you're not
[50:21] gonna get any mmm yes sir there Moses
[50:27] think about it taking the rock this is
[50:28] what I love about it for a long time you
[50:30] always saw Moses Amen and he's he speaks
[50:33] to the rock and there's a time he smoked
[50:35] the rock you know and
[50:37] my mind never went to this forum this
[50:39] place you know always saw them people
[50:41] like alright move over let me drink some
[50:45] it wasn't like it was a Gaza it was a
[50:49] river there were millions of people that
[50:52] was sad one time water at one time they
[50:55] drank till they couldn't drink no more
[50:57] that's what we need in this church we
[50:59] need a Gaza hallelujah a Holy Ghost gosh
[51:02] Amen that'll come in and put a party
[51:06] first in here hallelujah
[51:10] well when the Spirit of the Lord shows
[51:12] up that's what I'm talking about
[51:13] hey man it's not it you could sing but
[51:16] when the Spirit of the Lord shows up
[51:17] there's a difference you can preach but
[51:20] when the Spirit of Lord shows up
[51:21] hallelujah
[51:22] there's a different story when the
[51:24] spirit of Lord shows up hallelujah david
[51:28] says listen you didn't talk all that
[51:30] noise but I want you to understand that
[51:34] Goliath represented the devil he was the
[51:38] king if you want to say of the
[51:39] Philistines he was a big man they may
[51:44] have had a king but he was just a
[51:45] figurehead you understand me and when
[51:51] the devil comes you gotta go you got to
[51:52] go after him he said brother you don't
[51:54] challenge know when God anoints you you
[51:58] you don't you don't challenge him on
[52:00] your own you get before God let God
[52:02] anoint you that's when you start
[52:06] speaking because then it's no longer you
[52:08] it's God speaking through you we're no
[52:11] match for the devil but oh we got a big
[52:14] brother that is Moses taking that rod
[52:17] and judge his judgment stick going forth
[52:20] to the rock and then Stuart God on the
[52:22] rock and he smoked the rock and when he
[52:24] did the waters gushed forth not a little
[52:27] bit stream like you see the artist draw
[52:30] the picture I could drink y'all
[52:33] understand me he said I could drink that
[52:35] drink dry if I was thirsty
[52:37] but look enough water came out of it
[52:40] water two million people plus camels and
[52:44] animals that they had come forth with
[52:46] gushers hallelujah he's at a beautiful
[52:49] type of them when
[52:50] jesus said in the wilderness that he was
[52:53] a rock that was in the wilderness I
[52:54] never I said think about here Jesus
[52:58] preaching and he's preaching to the
[53:00] people there in Jerusalem
[53:02] and where he says Nicky I am that rock
[53:04] humanly said it I am that bread he just
[53:07] did you stayed in my mind just there I
[53:09] am that rock and that brand listen but
[53:11] now these people may have meditated only
[53:13] brother Adam said he said all of a
[53:15] sudden when they saw Jesus they ran a
[53:17] hose out of the Hosanna blessed is he
[53:19] that comes they knew he was that rock
[53:22] and they understood that rock brought
[53:24] forth water he meant to feed millions oh
[53:30] that's what I'm talking about and we had
[53:33] like Jesus can't hand our problems shame
[53:36] on us
[53:38] hallelujah what is your problem - what
[53:40] they had huh come on somebody
[53:45] amen rebellious people and he still gave
[53:49] him water rebellious people and he still

[53:54] still kept their clothing rebellious
[53:57] people and they still never had to
[53:59] change shoes 40 years yeah somebody help
[54:05] me here 40 years and if God did that for
[54:08] the rebels what will he do for those who
[54:10] will obey oh what is the rock huh that
[54:18] rock has been washed by the same waters
[54:21] or waters by the word they have to cry
[54:24] out says if they hold their peace the
[54:27] rock will immediately cry out and let me
[54:31] tell you something it may look like a
[54:33] rock don't have life but if you don't
[54:35] cry out gotta put life there hallelujah
[54:39] somebody help me here oh not later oh
[54:42] when they needed some water only thing
[54:44] they had to do was go was to speak to

[54:48] they went and hunted and they found in
[54:50] the cleft Oh Lord he said don't you
[54:52] understand what the clefts of the rock

[59:16] eating off those things that he knew
[59:17] that God could not continue on moving

[1:00:35] by his voice how do Christian work by

[1:00:46] sword comes out of his mouth his voice
[1:00:50] his words is to what this is the thing
[1:00:53] that destroys and slayed the enemy now

[1:02:38] powerhouse I didn't say brother Brooks
[1:02:41] is I said the church every one of us in
[1:02:44] here has the ability to change things if
[1:02:48] God is in you you don't need me it's him

[1:03:04] takes your faith even though Jesus is
[1:03:07] here you've got to believe you love the
[1:03:17] Lord I've come down to the end of my
[1:03:19] message but you know the thing that I'm
[1:03:22] trying to get us to see is that we need
[1:03:26] to hold out here
[1:03:28] lift up your head don't let the devil
[1:03:32] have you looking like they're all
[1:03:34] worried worried is not virtue and God is
[1:03:37] trying to get us to have virtue this is
[1:03:41] why this is not a mistake your life
[1:03:43] right now the way is playing it's not
[1:03:45] some mistake it's God I know it's hard
[1:03:50] to believe but God knows what's best for
[1:03:53] us you want to be just like him but he
[1:03:56] need you to prove to him that you trust
[1:03:58] him you know you think about it as a man
[1:04:05] Jesus understood Calvary he understood
[1:04:08] the pain that he was going to go through
[1:04:10] and he instilled you know what he did
[1:04:13] when he said Lordan father not my will
[1:04:15] but thine be done he gave his full life
[1:04:18] he put such a everything he had he
[1:04:21] trusted in the word he trusted the word
[1:04:25] because the worse and I will not leave
[1:04:28] your soul in hell he trusted the word
[1:04:30] and he knew that he was gonna live again
[1:04:33] because he trusted the word he knew he
[1:04:37] had to die but he trusted the word and
[1:04:40] in spite of all the pain he went through
[1:04:43] he never lost trust in the word my fact
[1:04:47] even when the word did God didn't
[1:04:49] respond to him my God my God why has
[1:04:54] thou forsaken me
[1:04:56] he still trusted him and his last words
[1:05:01] were it is finished Oh hallelujah
[1:05:06] you understand me pain and suffering is
[1:05:10] a part of this whole program he's
[1:05:12] loading as he's making us he's changing
[1:05:15] us from glory to glory don't refuse the
[1:05:18] makers hands what we need to learn how
[1:05:22] to do its praise God in the midst of our
[1:05:26] troubles that's what David said I'm
[1:05:29] gonna praise him I'm gonna saying I'm
[1:05:30] gonna sing praises I'm gonna dance I'm
[1:05:32] gonna do whatever is necessary because I
[1:05:34] want you to know I trust you and when
[1:05:39] you come to a place and you trust God he
[1:05:41] comes to the rest of you right Oh Lord
[1:05:45] don't you see what's goin down down
[1:05:47] there in Babylon
[1:05:48] God said I've been watching it all the
[1:05:49] time oh is that right wormwood says Lord
[1:05:53] send me and I'll turn the world upside
[1:05:56] down yeah no no a man differently just
[1:06:00] came in says no this is my job I'm going
[1:06:04] myself hallelujah in there is that right
[1:06:07] brother God said God got caught for
[1:06:10] the boat hallelujah jumped on it well it
[1:06:13] rolled on down down the hallelujah
[1:06:17] think about it sometimes he wants to
[1:06:21] come in personally to vindicate his life
[1:06:25] to you don't don't don't get messed up
[1:06:30] like I said if Satan has come and pin
[1:06:33] you on the car taking your family
[1:06:35] whatever he's doing I I know this this
[1:06:39] word is powerful uh-huh
[1:06:42] hello I heard a brother talk about this
[1:06:45] too the other day which is so true think
[1:06:47] about how confused Mary and Martha men
[1:06:50] would have been must have been when
[1:06:54] Jesus told them that this sickness that
[1:06:59] Lazarus had is not unto death and then
[1:07:02] he dies Hey and then he dies and then he
[1:07:16] didn't come when they wanted him to come
[1:07:19] sometimes God just don't come because
[1:07:21] you wanted to God don't have no brats
[1:07:26] he has obedient children
[1:07:34] t-those and they didn't take no they
[1:07:38] didn't have no bad attitude either
[1:07:40] married um what is that master that no
[1:07:46] matter what you've done already
[1:07:47] you steal my master my brother been dead
[1:07:50] for days in the grave but you steal my
[1:07:53] master hallelujah no matter what I go
[1:07:57] through how much does how much pain
[1:07:59] how much heartache family and everything
[1:08:01] else brain he's still my master Alleluia
[1:08:08] and because of that attitude
[1:08:11] I still wonder I don't know God hadn't
[1:08:13] revealed that to me but I want to know
[1:08:15] how did Mary and Martha roll that stone
[1:08:18] away it doesn't say but it said they
[1:08:22] rolled a stone away it takes faith I've
[1:08:29] been there I've seen how at the door and
[1:08:31] I seen how big the stone would would
[1:08:33] have been and I'ma tell you something
[1:08:34] you have had to have some muscles on you
[1:08:37] to rock left going in would have taken
[1:08:38] more than two and it took more than two
[1:08:40] people to roll it up there you
[1:08:42] understand me
[1:08:43] so whatever action God calls for you to
[1:08:47] do it's gonna always take your faith to
[1:08:49] move it it's already there for you
[1:08:53] the victory is yours but what if David
[1:08:55] would have shot you don't looked at the
[1:08:57] size of the lies like oh my goodness how
[1:08:59] in the world I'm gonna defeat this guy
[1:09:00] no he cared nothing about his size or
[1:09:04] the size of his weapon huh
[1:09:08] he went after him let me tell you
[1:09:10] something there's more of us and there
[1:09:14] are them open their eyes Lord let them
[1:09:19] see this army let them see this this
[1:09:21] Empire let them see this host of angels
[1:09:23] that that has been ordained to fight for
[1:09:26] the bride of Jesus Christ may we see a
[1:09:28] man we're never alone we never will be
[1:09:30] alone hallelujah it doesn't matter
[1:09:35] listen to me tell y'all the way system
[1:09:37] is going most of us go be kicked out of
[1:09:40] our houses and everything else will he
[1:09:43] still be your master
[1:09:47] when they if if I know the six heel is
[1:09:51] not something we will experience but we
[1:09:53] come right up to this thing and we don't
[1:09:56] know how much but brother branham calls
[1:09:58] it a squeeze right but the great great
[1:10:02] stuff that's carrying on with with the
[1:10:03] world whippin it whippin the demons and
[1:10:05] devils and breaking them and splitting
[1:10:07] them apart now we're not a part of that
[1:10:09] but my point is how far do we go up but
[1:10:13] the man who said even some of us might
[1:10:14] even be martyrs I heard that the other
[1:10:16] day I'm like what well the truth of the
[1:10:18] matter is there are those overseas that
[1:10:20] are that believe this message that have
[1:10:23] had to die for it but my question might
[1:10:28] look I look at this thing and I said oh
[1:10:30] my god what on earth are we thinking
[1:10:35] personally I don't want to be a martyr I
[1:10:39] want to live it and if I have to be
[1:10:44] glory be to God you understand me I'm
[1:10:47] still in the bride I'm still gonna
[1:10:51] praise him I'll come on somebody
[1:10:54] you saw all problems I mean I ain't got
[1:10:56] enough money to pay my bill and all the
[1:10:58] colors so why you ain't the only one the
[1:11:03] devil didn't isolate your problem I've
[1:11:08] been there I've had to live for a week a
[1:11:11] week you know people think I'm rich
[1:11:15] today I ain't rich not like that I do
[1:11:18] have a million dollar check but it's
[1:11:21] written in Jesus name Amen and only to
[1:11:31] make a heaven could cash it so one day
[1:11:33] I'm cashing it in but y'all must
[1:11:36] understand Amen these trials that we're
[1:11:39] going through don't they God picking on
[1:11:40] you you ask God you said Lord I want to
[1:11:42] be just like you and that's what it
[1:11:45] takes because all of us we messed up
[1:11:49] this world has messed us up we born in
[1:11:51] sin we got so much darkness and things
[1:11:53] around us we don't even know it's there
