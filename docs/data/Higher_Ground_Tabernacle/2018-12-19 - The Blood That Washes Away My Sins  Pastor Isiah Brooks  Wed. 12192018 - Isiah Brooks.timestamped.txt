[19:03] everybody being out of the house out to
[19:05] the house of the Lord tonight it god is
[19:07] so good to us a man we just I know we
[19:13] had had the things of God you may be
[19:15] seated just for a moment we had you
[19:17] praying for sister Zaius but anyway we
[19:24] talked about giving it a oxygen water
[19:28] instead but anyway she passed on
[19:30] Saturday and they have her funeral on
[19:33] Saturday down in South Carolina a close
[19:37] friend of mine just died on last week as
[19:39] well so it seems as though I've had
[19:42] about three people close friends you
[19:47] guys remember brother Samuel feels he
[19:51] died about a month ago and I just got
[19:54] the report from England yes he died inez
[19:59] son just called me and told me I said
[20:02] did you go yes brother forgive me I
[20:06] would have come I want to try to anyway
[20:08] but anyhow I wasn't the will of the Lord
[20:11] for me to go I just felt bad because I
[20:14] would have loved to try to encourage her
[20:17] his wife
[20:19] she's a beautiful sister but anyhow it
[20:24] just seems like things are happening now
[20:26] a couple of deaths were did take place
[20:29] down in in Iowa City as well but you
[20:37] know when you one person you can't be it
[20:39] everywhere so we love the Lord we thank
[20:44] God for His goodness and you know I just
[20:47] want to say that people of God we are
[20:50] in a dangerous time in a time where we
[20:54] must recognize as a dangerous time Satan
[20:59] is very busy and it is his job he does
[21:04] he a really good job yeah like the
[21:09] sisters say he's a good adversary but
[21:13] he's only working according to God's
[21:16] plan that's the thing that I really
[21:20] appreciate God for because Satan can't
[21:24] do us those who are chosen and elected
[21:28] by God he can't do us any harm
[21:34] hallelujah
[21:36] once you have come into Christ you have
[21:40] passed from death unto life as we stand
[21:46] let us have take two passes of Scripture
[21:49] I've just been thinking about this a lot
[21:51] and I don't know it's just I just want
[21:53] God to have preeminence tonight thank
[21:57] you brother and I apologize for my wife
[22:04] not being here but she really really was
[22:08] really tired tonight and her days are
[22:11] very full and packed some of us may not
[22:15] know but she has to keep Chicanos
[22:18] children during the day plus do
[22:19] homeschool with Esther and then and
[22:22] she's got a little Maya there to pray
[22:29] for her Isaiah 1:18 Romans 8:31
[22:37] I trust by God's grace that will bless
[22:42] tonight this message may be simple but
[22:46] it's powerful to me
[22:52] Isaiah 1:18 come and let us reason
[22:58] together saith the LORD though
[23:03] be as scarlet they shall be as white as
[23:08] snow and though they be red like crimson
[23:12] they shall be as wool Romans 8:31 what
[23:22] shall we say to these things if God be
[23:28] for us who can be against us Heavenly
[23:36] Father we come before your Lord we thank
[23:37] you for your amazing grace Lord you're
[23:41] so good to us we thank you for
[23:44] everything
[23:45] we thank you for the times that you
[23:48] allow us to stand we thank you for the
[23:51] times you allow us to fall we thank you
[23:54] for the times that you allow us to get
[23:56] up from the fall because we realize Lord
[24:00] Jesus that all things work together for
[24:03] the good of them that love you and those
[24:07] who are called according to your calling
[24:10] father we realize Lord Jesus that there
[24:14] is total victory in you there is no
[24:17] failure in you you're the only one Lord
[24:20] that have lived a perfect life but by
[24:23] your grace we are accepted in your
[24:25] beloved son Christ Jesus we thank you
[24:29] for your glory we thank you for your
[24:32] goodness and we pray father God that you
[24:35] have preeminence here this evening in
[24:38] your lovely name Jesus Christ we pray
[24:40] amen you may be seated when reading this
[24:48] should I think I when the last time I
[24:49] preached I kind of mentioned it before
[24:52] something or I've been talking to
[24:54] someone I have not seen it in the way
[24:56] that I've seen it before I was thinking
[25:01] about the way we were and I am so
[25:09] grateful to God that he's the only one
[25:11] that could make it so my subject would
[25:17] be the blood that washes away my sins we
[25:25] talk about the blood a lot and it took
[25:30] us a profit to Dhin tell us that the
[25:33] blood and the life of the blood are two
[25:40] different things because II
[25:45] if I had a cruise of Jesus blood in my
[25:50] hand it would do me no good because all
[25:58] that I would I would be holding in my
[26:00] hand would be only the chemistry of it
[26:05] but there's a difference between the
[26:07] chemistry of the blood and the life of
[26:10] the blood when I thought about the blood
[26:15] the blood fixes everything
[26:18] doesn't matter how broken it is doesn't
[26:22] matter how dirty it is it doesn't matter
[26:26] amen if it's been lost a hundred years
[26:30] or 90 years and you get save all 90
[26:32] woman the blood takes whatever sin
[26:38] you've ever committed and dispels it to
[26:44] a place where there is no evidence that
[26:46] it ever existed God did it I couldn't
[26:55] have done it you couldn't have done it
[26:57] but God did it when we confess our sins
[27:06] we trust that the blood would cleanse us
[27:10] because the Bible said if we confess our
[27:12] sins he is faithful and just to forgive
[27:15] us of our sins and to cleanse us from
[27:18] all our unrighteousness but understand
[27:23] when the blood cleanses you he doesn't
[27:25] leave a stain it is totally annihilated
[27:32] or gotten rid of once it's confessed and
[27:37] placed under the blood there is no
[27:40] evidence that you ever did what you did
[27:44] and that's why brother Branham tells us
[27:48] that when God justifies us it is by the
[27:52] blood he can justify us and that
[27:56] justification is in a way
[27:59] you've never seen before
[28:03] you never did it because there is no
[28:06] evidence we said what can wash away my
[28:11] sins nothing but the blood of Jesus
[28:16] nemanja we're not talking about the
[28:19] chemistry we're literally talking about
[28:23] the life I thought about it I said you
[28:27] know we talk about the blood veil
[28:30] because understand the veil is there is
[28:34] the chemistry but behind the chemistry
[28:38] in that chemistry was a life in that
[28:43] life was God's life in the law the
[28:48] Misses law he says you know what the
[28:51] blood of Christ does too to confess sins
[28:54] you women could you imagine having a
[28:57] wash table full of bleach and take that
[29:00] little eyedropper full of ink and you
[29:03] drop it this ink down into the wash
[29:06] trough full of bleach what happens to
[29:09] the ink the ink becomes bleach what
[29:12] happened it doesn't hurt the bleach a
[29:15] bit it just takes on and becomes bleach
[29:19] that's what confess sin does when is
[29:24] confessed upon the blood of the Lord
[29:26] Jesus Christ it changes color and
[29:30] becomes righteousness for you willing to
[29:34] acknowledge it and accept God provided
[29:37] way for you to be saved there's nothing
[29:40] like it friends T and that's the
[29:44] privilege that we have because of the
[29:47] blood of Jesus I don't think we preach
[29:50] enough on the blood because we get into
[29:54] this element where we think omit our
[29:56] righteousnesses of ourselves but
[29:59] remember that the righteousness that we
[30:01] are we have is of God and God alone God
[30:06] is the only one that could really
[30:07] produce righteousness our righteousness
[30:11] as the scripture said is like
[30:13] filthy rags understand this that without
[30:22] the blood because of sin there was been
[30:30] no way that you and I could ever be
[30:32] united to with God again I'm gonna say
[30:35] that again there was a time that that
[30:39] man was United with God whatever God
[30:43] thought he thought it whatever God
[30:46] wanted him to do he did it they were in
[30:49] such harmony there was in such a union
[30:53] because it was so because Adam had God
[30:58] spirit that right Adam Amen
[31:05] did not bypass his theophany he knew but
[31:13] because of sin something was separated
[31:17] but when he was in that body that was to
[31:22] last and live forever he knew and had
[31:26] the mind of God there was a union there
[31:30] was a Holy Spirit but when the breach
[31:35] came because of the way King God
[31:42] required blood ha because life is in the
[31:50] blood
[31:50] ah you see that's why when it came to
[31:57] the goats and it came to the sheets and
[31:59] when it came to the pigeons think it
[32:01] lives a consecrated life if I want to
[32:04] say it like this it was their nature
[32:06] that God was pleased with at the farm
[32:10] animals changed the lion became vicious
[32:18] the tiger
[32:20] vicious the bear became vicious man
[32:22] became vicious and the only way that God
[32:27] could could could could cover his anger
[32:31] I'll put this way God could judge this
[32:33] thing he had to give them a substitute
[32:36] and that substitute was to sacrifice our
[32:40] innocent lamb
[32:43] thank God God became the innocent lamb
[32:47] because the natural lamb though he was
[32:51] innocent his life was not compatible
[32:54] with man his life could not come into a
[32:58] man the blood could not mix you could
[33:03] never put a lambs blood in a man and
[33:06] expect him to live so God had to create
[33:11] a blood he had to create a man he had to
[33:15] create a lamb in the image of a man
[33:19] hallelujah
[33:21] and in that lamb that lamb had to have a
[33:24] special kind of blood and that blood was
[33:27] the kind of blood that blood within that
[33:33] blood it was the kind that could heal
[33:35] that that in that lamb a meant there was
[33:40] qualities he meant that that was in that
[33:43] lamb that was able to literally erase a
[33:50] man's old life and give him a new one is
[33:55] that what the Bible says if we are in
[33:57] Christ the Bible said we are a new
[34:00] creature in Christ all things have
[34:04] passed away
[34:05] God has gotten rid of the old things
[34:08] behold everything else has become new
[34:12] there's a process to salvation brother
[34:16] let me put it like this he said like the
[34:18] sinner comes in and listen to the gospel
[34:22] he began to realize condemnation he's a
[34:26] sinner he realized that in the water
[34:28] separation is the Scarlet someone died
[34:32] for him an innocent substitute
[34:34] to bring him into fellowship in
[34:36] relationship with God again he realized
[34:39] that he's out of the way by preaching of
[34:41] the word I say the gospel yet it is its
[34:45] simplicity preached in the power of the
[34:47] blood is the greatest drawing card the
[34:50] world has ever known but people don't
[34:54] preach it anymore it's all fashion but
[34:57] when you can tell a man there is a blood
[35:00] there is a cure there is a solution to
[35:03] your problem and God is able to wash you
[35:06] whiter than snow really wash you whiter
[35:11] than snow he can literally get rid of
[35:15] all of your sins your mama says your
[35:18] daddy and everybody else who have seen
[35:21] if you only believe God can choix shooo
[35:27] whiter than snow what a drawing card if
[35:33] the drunkards could really know that
[35:35] there is a power hallelujah that can
[35:39] change their whole entire life and bring
[35:43] them smacking new think about it how
[35:52] that blood is able to do that this is
[35:56] why I said don't don't just drop a few
[35:58] drops Lord let me plunge beneath the
[36:01] flood wash me clean is that what the
[36:06] Bible says Lord wash me I believe us I
[36:09] said wash me clean there is a life they
[36:18] can take us back to the beginning they
[36:22] can literally treat change you and
[36:25] transform you to one day you'll find
[36:29] yourself in a place that never knew seen
[36:37] God is trying to perform in his church
[36:40] and the church is trying to perform by
[36:42] Creed's
[36:43] and to can't work together you got to
[36:48] get rid of the Creed and get Christ here
[36:51] how can you do it when he sees the blood
[36:55] when the blood has been applied with the
[36:58] sincere heart and I had lead upon Jesus
[37:02] Christ in a heart that's true before God
[37:05] to confess his role and be born of the
[37:08] Holy Spirit
[37:10] then the works of God would follow as he
[37:13] said it would do yeah the church want to
[37:16] perform through their crease and see how
[37:19] many members they can get God wants to
[37:22] perform through the power of the blood
[37:25] to get Christians born again see if we
[37:29] can really take on the blood God can
[37:32] give us a full justification if we
[37:35] really take on the blood it is the blood
[37:37] that was sanctify you hallelujah it is
[37:42] the bleach that sanctifies the ink is
[37:45] that right the eat does nothing it is
[37:48] the bleach that breaks the ink up it is
[37:51] the Holy Spirit is a God is a blood in
[37:53] that the life in that blood that does it
[37:57] does work it is God's working if it's
[38:01] really the blood it is the blood that
[38:06] brings you to the baptism of the Holy
[38:08] Ghost not by power not by might but by
[38:12] my spirit saith the Lord
[38:14] it is the blood that brings you to a
[38:17] healing it is the blood that brings you
[38:20] to a deliverance not you but you got to
[38:25] realize what's behind the blood I'll
[38:28] tell you God it was
[38:35] when he Jesus stood there at the bank of
[38:38] the Jordan River and the pillar of fire
[38:41] came down like a dove and that Holy
[38:44] Spirit says I am well pleased to dwell
[38:49] in you it was God's light that was
[38:53] dwelling in that body hallelujah
[38:57] but you gotta understand when Jesus laid
[39:00] handle to shake it wasn't the lid that
[39:02] him it was the blood it was gone in the
[39:06] blood it was God behind the veil that
[39:10] ride could Jesus said I can't do nothing
[39:14] except my father showed me brother
[39:20] Branham said Jesus never hear one person
[39:22] it was God in him doing the healing
[39:25] hallelujah is that right I want what
[39:30] scripture that is I think is in Jeremiah
[39:33] one of those scriptures I can't recall
[39:35] I'm Intertek put it down but I didn't he
[39:37] says Lord everything we we give to you
[39:40] you gave it to us everything is yours
[39:45] how can we both the bride
[39:47] there's no postie there's no raggedy
[39:51] also what if I can say him you can't I
[39:54] didn't give me this voice he gave me
[39:58] this voice hallelujah oh there's no
[40:03] boasting there's no bragging the Lucifer
[40:06] should have known that everything he had
[40:08] God gave it to him so God has a right to
[40:11] take it from him no boasting in each or
[40:16] ability it's God's ability
[40:20] hallelujah it's like the same once now
[40:24] it might be Randi other might be white
[40:26] or yellow why came bowls against the
[40:29] other one they didn't give themselves
[40:31] that the same Sun Shine on the same
[40:35] flower and yet God has determined what
[40:38] color it should be
[40:45] he said oh if we could understand that
[40:52] the life of the blood we sing you know
[40:56] this power in the blood
[40:58] Allu power in the chemistry power in the
[41:03] blood that same power was released on
[41:08] the day of Pentecost the very life of
[41:11] God and that life amen
[41:15] it's for every true believer have you
[41:18] received the Holy Ghost since you
[41:20] believe hallelujah right justification
[41:25] sanctification baptism the Holy Ghost
[41:28] and then brother Brennan said it brings
[41:30] a big srew for the Holy Ghost himself
[41:32] the very person Oh y'all hear what I'm
[41:36] saying not just a little bit of him but
[41:39] the very first son Jesus hallelujah
[41:43] y'all understand me when he said the
[41:45] very person that means the fullness of
[41:47] the person it's now in you O God's
[41:53] divine nature that all right this in the
[41:59] beginning when the world had his birth
[42:01] when God pulled back the water first off
[42:05] the earth like he did the waters from
[42:07] the mother's womb there was a world born
[42:11] yes and people began to live on it when
[42:14] God put them on there and then they
[42:17] began to sin and it was baptized by
[42:20] immersing in the days of Noah then it
[42:23] was sanctified by the blood of the
[42:25] creator dropping upon it and now that oh
[42:30] holy holy the blood dropped in Jerusalem
[42:33] on Calvary the blood dropped the blood
[42:37] dropped and it's sanctified the whole
[42:40] world hallelujah that's powerful
[42:44] happy dust of the earth was sanctified
[42:47] when the blood of Jesus TRUCKING
[42:50] hallelujah Wow understand me
[42:58] oh well but the blood was dropped in
[43:02] Jerusalem
[43:03] you know what Jerusalem meaning here in
[43:05] Hebrew city of peace who God brought
[43:10] peace in Jerusalem
[43:11] and that peace read throughout the whole
[43:13] Wow that's just the way the gospel
[43:16] spread one drop in the world or the
[43:21] earth was never the same
[43:25] whoo now do that we come through
[43:30] justification to believe God you were
[43:33] baptized unto repentance or to remission
[43:36] of your sin you confess your sins before
[43:38] God he forgave you for it and you were
[43:41] baptized to show that you have been you
[43:44] have been forgiven confessing to the
[43:46] people showing to the world that you
[43:49] believe that Jesus Christ died for you
[43:52] he took your place and now you stand in
[43:55] his place he become you that you might
[43:58] become him hallelujah
[44:01] see that's what I'm trying to say the
[44:04] blood took your place think about it
[44:07] it wasn't the chemistry it was God fail
[44:11] behind that blood that literally took
[44:14] your place talking about a perfect
[44:17] substitute well a perfect example of
[44:23] divine love hallelujah like brother said
[44:28] when Adam and Eve fell it was God
[44:31] Himself that walked through the cool of
[44:34] the evening he was the one that came to
[44:37] fix the problem hallelujah
[44:42] oh is that all right then the
[44:44] sanctifying power of God cleanses all
[44:46] the habits out of your life well let me
[44:49] say it again

[44:53] let God come in and clear all of those
[44:56] bad habits out of your life you used to

[45:28] gone sanctify you hallelujah then that's
[45:33] it the blood has sanctifying power its
[45:38] power in the blood to sanctify you to

[45:46] that's why we say Lord forgive me that's
[45:48] why we said Lord deliver me that's why
[45:51] we say God I want to be like you so the
[45:53] sanctifying power the blood will come
[45:56] and sanctify us and clears us to make us
[46:00] right for heaven whew in the sanctifying
[46:05] power the blood of Jesus Christ comes
[46:07] into your life and takes all the things
[46:09] away from you if you happen to say
[46:11] something not wrong quickly say wait a
[46:14] minute
[46:14] pardon me I didn't mean to say it like
[46:16] that see that's the devil got a trap set
[46:19] there but you've got to grace to come
[46:21] back if you are real Christian
[46:24] hallelujah
[46:25] you got the grace to come back if you
[46:28] are real did you know don't you know God
[46:31] sets you in a trap
[46:32] he always said traps for you see how
[46:36] well you're going to come out of it
[46:39] hallelujah I can go down I can go down
[46:42] the line to show you where God and trap
[46:43] people see god knows what they going
[46:46] into and gotta let him go right on into
[46:48] already why cuz God loves it he loves
[46:52] the glory of it he loves the praise of
[46:55] it he loves to see his people overcome
[46:57] how by his blood he goes on to say when
[47:09] the millennia is over
[47:10] God is going to give a world the world a
[47:14] baptism of fire it's going to blow the
[47:17] whole thing up the heaven and the earth
[47:19] will be on fire Peter says so and the
[47:22] thing will have a baptism of fire
[47:24] innovation of the whole thing and then
[47:27] there'll be a new heaven and a new earth
[47:28] see then when when then that's when
[47:32] we're weird well righteousness that's
[47:36] where we are see we have become from
[47:38] mortal beings from time beings to
[47:41] eternal beings when the Word of God is
[47:44] in our soul and we become sons and
[47:47] daughters of God with the attributes the
[47:50] gene of God in us to be sons and
[47:52] daughters of the father God in heaven
[47:55] crying I'm a father my God my God in my
[47:59] father's house you understand me oh I
[48:03] can't explain this but I say it like
[48:06] this
[48:06] every y'all heard me talk about
[48:08] communion that's to me I see a great
[48:09] revelation in that loaf of bread in that
[48:13] loaf of bread I see God and when God
[48:16] breaks up those feet pieces
[48:18] I still see God but the difference is
[48:20] that I see God take on an identity of
[48:23] persons but one person fragmented one
[48:29] body one people hallelujah
[48:31] made out of the same stuff sister you
[48:34] can't be eternal unless you're part of
[48:36] eternity you've got to be a part of
[48:39] eternity that's what this message came
[48:43] to do I did defy us and where we came
[48:47] from why we in this Jam and widely why
[48:49] we in this mess I love God you know what
[48:53] I don't know the Bible even don't even
[48:55] tell us where Adam was when he messed up
[48:57] but you think God didn't know it God set
[49:01] the trap he allowed it to happen he knew
[49:07] he was going to fall that was his whole
[49:10] program
[49:11] he saw it before it happened but he also
[49:15] fixed it before it happened hallelujah
[49:18] because the Bible said he put our names
[49:20] in the lamb look alive before the
[49:23] foundation of the world in order for him
[49:26] to be just he had to fix it hallelujah
[49:33] see we talked about eternal gods or the
[49:37] turn of God who created blood to live in
[49:40] oh not just any blood it wasn't part of
[49:47] Mary and it wasn't part of Joseph now
[49:51] we're getting ready the world is getting
[49:52] ready to celebrate Christmas now they're
[49:54] coming to realize that Christmas was not
[49:56] in December everybody's coming to know
[50:00] the truth it ain't gonna stop because
[50:03] the truth of the matter is you're
[50:04] dealing with a spirit they a worship so
[50:09] they go continued 25th of December they
[50:12] may even go be become more lavish with
[50:16] with a way of worship you just never
[50:18] know what they're gonna do but you know
[50:20] anybody with their right mind know that
[50:23] if the shepherds were abiding in the
[50:25] field they weren't in the snow and if
[50:28] there was animals in that pen they had
[50:31] hay and I believe Jesus would have had a
[50:36] little bit more clothing than swaddling
[50:39] so you and I must realize that the world
[50:42] got it all mixed up look at history look
[50:45] when a lamb can only be born in the
[50:48] spring that's true now how far one of
[50:56] people want to go that they say well you
[50:58] know the Prophet did and I said well I
[50:59] don't know why you did it but my
[51:02] conscience won't let me y'all can do
[51:04] what you want to do it justified any way
[51:07] you'd like to but in my soul I think
[51:10] I'll stay with what I understand cuz if
[51:14] you don't do something with faith it's
[51:16] sin anyway if it's not a revelation it's
[51:20] sin anyway and we are not supposed to
[51:23] follow the traditions of a prophet it is
[51:26] the word he's bringing oh I got a
[51:28] powerful quote yeah I'm gonna use it
[51:32] it's coming whether it's gonna help
[51:37] people are dying I don't know but I'm
[51:40] gonna tell you something the bride of
[51:41] Jesus Christ will be without spot
[51:43] wrinkle or blemish that's right
[51:50] she's not going to be an odd dollar to
[51:53] worship her and expect to make heaven
[51:56] idols
[51:57] out out out is that right look in the
[52:02] scripture every time Israel had to cross
[52:04] over they had to sanctify themselves
[52:06] they had to get rid of everything
[52:09] everything before they cross over and
[52:12] before you cross over whether by rapture
[52:14] or death you're gonna have to have
[52:16] everything out it's a truth sometime my
[52:23] bride now if you're gonna be bride
[52:24] everything got to be going that's the
[52:27] power of the blood so there's no excuse
[52:29] I couldn't do it if the power of the
[52:30] blood is there that's the power of the
[52:32] blood will bring you to that revelations
[52:38] welcome father unto him that loveth us
[52:40] loved us and washed us from our sins in
[52:43] his own blood the word wash is actually
[52:47] loosed loosed us from our sins in his
[52:49] own blood
[52:51] isn't that wonderful but we are but you
[52:55] what are you spiritually minded did you
[52:58] catch it it was his own blood that
[53:01] loosed us completely from our sin
[53:05] you saw what do you mean brother words
[53:07] let me say it like this if you justified
[53:10] you can still sing if you're sanctified
[53:13] you can still see it even if you've been
[53:17] baptized with the Holy Ghost you can
[53:19] still sin but when the person of Jesus
[53:22] Christ comes into you he said you can
[53:25] neither be barren nor can you fall why
[53:32] cuz you did you rot it
[53:35] you're not even gasps you're not alive
[53:38] you are not alive that's what Paul said
[53:40] it is not on that limb but Christ Christ
[53:44] that live how can I see the from day
[53:48] know his cries that live he's seeing
[53:56] through my eyes he's hearing through my
[53:58] ears he's speaking through my lips he's
[54:01] praising through my mouth
[54:03] I'm doing nothing but watching him use
[54:06] my body
[54:13] did you watch did you catch it it was
[54:17] his own blood that loosed us completely
[54:18] from our sins it was not human blood it
[54:21] was the blood of God Peter called it the
[54:23] blood of Christ Paul called it the blood
[54:26] of the Lord and the blood of Jesus not
[54:28] three persons but one blood one person
[54:30] there is that revelation again one God
[54:34] that omnipotent Jehovah God came down
[54:37] and made himself a body by means of the
[54:40] virgin birth and in dwell it and that it
[54:44] might be the blood of God that would
[54:45] free us loose us entirely from our sins
[54:52] and present us spotless before himself
[54:55] with exceedingly great joy hallelujah
[54:58] you said what do you mean brother if
[55:01] that's what people don't understand that
[55:02] portion of adoption will come and it
[55:05] will totally bring you to a perfect
[55:08] place of perfection we are different
[55:11] creature this age is different from all
[55:14] the others we have a higher calling and
[55:19] I'm calling it to be the real reflection
[55:21] of Jesus Christ hallelujah all of his
[55:28] bone and flesh of his flesh he's mine
[55:30] let this mind be in you that was also in
[55:35] Christ Jesus we've got to be different
[55:37] but the blood power the power of the
[55:41] blood is loved and able to present you
[55:45] faultless go present you faultless it
[55:52] Fox Oh God
[55:53] it works the things I used to do I don't
[55:56] do them all the praises I used to go I
[55:59] don't go no more hallelujah I'm not what
[56:02] I ought to be all right it goes I'm not
[56:06] what I used to be I'm not what I want
[56:09] out to be wanna be I ought to be y'all
[56:11] know how it goes I never can get this
[56:13] straight but brother madam says just
[56:16] because of that
[56:17] gave that testimony and that was proof
[56:19] that she passed from death unto life
[56:20] she's all the journey and every believer
[56:23] that's been watching the blood is on a
[56:26] journey hallelujah the church the body
[56:33] of Christ is us own body you said what
[56:37] do you mean that's why brother Branham
[56:38] says now the bride of Jesus Christ
[56:40] basically she comes he gets to a place
[56:42] where God gives her a blood transfusion
[56:44] a blood transfusion
[56:46] that means no longer blood if it's no
[56:51] more your blood that means you don't
[56:52] have to be sick there's no sickness in
[56:56] the blood of Jesus everything that's in
[57:03] this that's the only way you're not
[57:06] gonna strike will see rapture because
[57:09] the blood the power of the blood will
[57:12] quicken this body and bring it to an
[57:16] important allottee that's the only way
[57:18] and if you don't let the blood have his
[57:21] way you're gonna be in trouble hmm
[57:24] what do you mean Israel would justify
[57:28] Amen when they put the blood on the
[57:30] doorpost of their little that was just
[57:31] the chemistry and then they were
[57:33] baptized by Moses in the in the in the
[57:35] Red Sea but they didn't let the blood
[57:38] continue they got out there murmuring
[57:41] complaining and of God and fussing and
[57:43] fighting and not nothing could please
[57:45] them but see one thing about the blood
[57:47] you got to submit to it hallelujah when
[57:51] the power the blood is there is there to
[57:53] bring life to you to change your life
[57:56] did you hear what I said in the
[57:57] beginning it is able to switch
[57:59] everything to change all these years of
[58:03] sin into nothing it is the net the thing
[58:06] that could bring nothing to nothing
[58:09] hallelujah it is a thing that could take
[58:11] away all your guilt all your sin all
[58:14] your shame Oh tell me about it Rahab can
[58:23] tell you about it
[58:24] if she was here she could tell you I was
[58:26] a streetwalker I was a prostitute
[58:29] hallelujah
[58:30] but I've heard about God I heard about
[58:33] what he did
[58:34] they took the blood and put the dope on
[58:37] placing on the dope was in the little I
[58:39] don't know him but whatever he is I hope
[58:43] he's seen me somehow over here in
[58:45] Jericho hallelujah you don't think so
[58:48] that was a deep call to the deep is that
[58:51] right because we have said we have heard
[58:55] 40 years ago I heard about it still
[58:59] believe no God is God when you destroy
[59:03] Jericho have mercy on me hallelujah and
[59:07] those sponsors okay take that red ribbon
[59:10] take that rope and hang it out the
[59:12] window
[59:13] so now if you don't do what we tell you
[59:14] if you don't follow the instructions if
[59:16] you don't apply the blood if you don't
[59:18] apply the token
[59:19] we're not guilty if you get killed in
[59:21] the matter hallelujah and real houses
[59:24] all not just me but my family is well
[59:28] hallelujah time me and my family well
[59:31] you better put that token out there
[59:33] because when I see the Blood I pass over
[59:36] you it's no more the chemistry let me
[59:39] share like this when I see the life of
[59:42] Christ I will pass over you Oh Lord of
[59:56] God I wonder if you note the salutation
[1:00:08] of the first age and when those windin
[1:00:12] then notes that one to this age just put
[1:00:16] them together these things says he that
[1:00:18] holds the seven stars in his right hand
[1:00:21] and walketh in the midst of the churches
[1:00:24] these things says there first and the
[1:00:27] last watch was which was dead and is
[1:00:30] alive this is a one and the same person
[1:00:34] and he is letting us know that the
[1:00:37] church is his as the seed of the fruit
[1:00:41] is in the midst of the fruit so is he
[1:00:44] the Royal seed in the midst of the
[1:00:46] charge and as the seed alone has life in
[1:00:50] it so is he the author of life to the
[1:00:54] church
[1:00:55] his walking signifies his his son Turing
[1:01:00] care for it
[1:01:01] he is the chief shepherd watching over
[1:01:05] his room that is his right for he bought
[1:01:09] that church with his own blood that
[1:01:12] blood is the blood of God the one who
[1:01:15] owns the church is God very God he is
[1:01:19] the first and the last
[1:01:21] that title spells eternity he was dead
[1:01:25] and is alive he paid the price so he was
[1:01:29] sole owner of the temple of God he rules
[1:01:33] it whoa he rules it he is worshiped in
[1:01:38] it he resents anyone taking over his
[1:01:41] lordship and authority hallelujah no
[1:01:45] doubt the reason he introduced himself
[1:01:48] to each age as deity is to warn and
[1:01:51] comfort the people he warns the false
[1:01:54] vine and he comforts the true vine this
[1:01:57] is the only true Almighty God hear him
[1:02:02] hallelujah is life it's the blood it's
[1:02:06] the power
[1:02:07] hallelujah it transforms how to do it it
[1:02:11] changes everything that it touches
[1:02:15] hallelujah you hear me you know what I
[1:02:22] tell you what I don't know where the
[1:02:25] donkey's can talk but that one that rode
[1:02:27] Jesus on his back I'm sure he felt
[1:02:33] pretty good that's proud was the only
[1:02:36] person ever rolled him and he never felt
[1:02:38] a burden who he had to feel good I heard
[1:02:43] a preacher says you know he was smiling
[1:02:44] and grinning so much just somebody had
[1:02:48] to tell him it ain't about you boy is
[1:02:50] about the man is riding you hallelujah
[1:02:53] see sometimes we got to be careful the
[1:02:56] Holy Ghost me feelings
[1:02:57] good about you is about the God in you
[1:03:04] ain't God good to us that blood lives it
[1:03:08] must live it must live hallelujah and
[1:03:12] God that life won't live through us
[1:03:15] that's the whole purpose to show that
[1:03:19] God has children that's just like him is
[1:03:24] that right oh my for animal life could
[1:03:28] not come back upon the human being when
[1:03:30] the blood was shared the life went out
[1:03:32] of course because it was a unit and when
[1:03:36] the life blood was gone from it the life
[1:03:39] being different from the blood that the
[1:03:41] blood is the chemistry of the life but
[1:03:44] the life is something different from the
[1:03:46] blood but the life is in the blood and
[1:03:49] the animal's life could not come back
[1:03:53] upon the worshiper when he shed his
[1:03:56] blood of the Lamb he had to apply the
[1:03:59] chemistry because the life was gone and
[1:04:01] could not come back in that amazing so
[1:04:05] therefore the sinner could not change
[1:04:07] there was no change in that what the
[1:04:10] Bible says all those millions of animals
[1:04:13] lives given blood shed everywhere
[1:04:16] sprinkled on the utensil sprinkled on
[1:04:19] the believer but he could never change
[1:04:21] the belief because it was just the
[1:04:24] chemistry it was just a token it was
[1:04:27] just something that God gave as a
[1:04:29] substitute to the real thing
[1:04:31] but the real blood of Jesus one drop of
[1:04:34] blood will change you through it the man
[1:04:43] who created the Moon the Stars the
[1:04:44] heavens that gave you breath that's who
[1:04:47] I'm talking about that's why there
[1:04:49] anything too hard for God remember the
[1:04:53] proper God in Africa doesn't boy was so
[1:04:56] so I was a default they even had him on
[1:05:01] a chain hallelujah he was deformed he's
[1:05:05] all twisted up and everything and here
[1:05:07] was through an interpreter he heard him
[1:05:09] and what the healing and things that
[1:05:11] I was doing and all of a sudden he got
[1:05:13] faith his brothers got faith and all of
[1:05:15] a sudden hallelujah that man
[1:05:17] straightened up and was running
[1:05:18] everywhere thank you ha
[1:05:22] was it the prophet of God no that life
[1:05:25] was beyond him hallelujah
[1:05:27] you understand me we talk about a
[1:05:29] presence when God comes in here you
[1:05:32] understand that's life that's the
[1:05:34] creative power that means you can get
[1:05:36] anything from God but the problem is we
[1:05:39] don't recognize his presence but he
[1:05:42] comes in here because you can't feel
[1:05:45] them in case him and see him you think
[1:05:47] that God is not Ava in the stillness of
[1:05:50] the night guard performs huh but we got
[1:05:55] too much Pentecostalism in us we got to
[1:05:58] feel it you know a thunder gotta come Oh
[1:06:00] some got a wave of something no sure if
[1:06:03] I don't feel him his word is still his
[1:06:05] word his word said I'm healed I'm here I
[1:06:09] don't have to feel heal I'm here I don't
[1:06:16] feel it when you your feelings you
[1:06:17] weight resting on your feelings man
[1:06:19] feelings become before your faith no
[1:06:22] faith comes before your feelings that
[1:06:28] right see the animal had no soul so he
[1:06:31] couldn't come back on us God had to take
[1:06:34] someone with a soul and God became the
[1:06:38] soul of Jesus is that right now I'm not
[1:06:42] gonna be too much longer but I want to
[1:06:44] bring this towards people because I want
[1:06:46] you to understand and then that you and
[1:06:48] I are now becoming the real what we
[1:06:51] supposed to have been in the beginning
[1:06:53] this is what a new birth is all about
[1:06:56] you get a second chance see the new
[1:07:00] birth is really not new it's only new
[1:07:02] here but in the mind of God he saw you
[1:07:05] that way there you not birth like here
[1:07:11] there God spoke you and you were there
[1:07:14] hallelujah it's here you've given birth
[1:07:17] we call it a new birth because we were
[1:07:19] born in the Adamic nature
[1:07:22] without the nature of God we became
[1:07:24] group beasts we became a relatives to
[1:07:27] the serpent hallelujah and therefore God
[1:07:30] said you must be born again if you're
[1:07:33] going to come back I've got to make a
[1:07:35] way for you to come back you don't God
[1:07:39] can change things John God took a little
[1:07:43] girl by the name of her Desa I often
[1:07:46] raise my uncle hallelujah nobody newer
[1:07:51] Polly ever especially in Babylon but
[1:07:55] then God turn the whole thing around

[1:08:03] was a chosen vessel
[1:08:04] she was anointed and appointed I like
[1:08:07] that to be queen don't you see what I'm
[1:08:11] saying
[1:08:12] if you are the vassals of God if you
[1:08:15] have been appointed and anointed if you
[1:08:18] have been chosen to be in the New
[1:08:21] Jerusalem part of it
[1:08:23] oh hell can't stop you if you have been
[1:08:28] appointed to make a translation if God
[1:08:32] has said this one and this one and this

[1:08:36] don't care what the death eater brings
[1:08:39] he have no authority over you no that's
[1:08:45] the power of the blood because the power
[1:08:47] of the blood is God it's not a second it

[1:10:01] element that was in the chemistry it was
[1:10:03] the life that was in the chemistry we're

[1:12:38] 1955 for the medicine the doctors told
[1:12:41] him he was going to die because of other
[1:12:43] of the guns and he said but that God
[1:12:47] says man what you talking about he said
[1:12:48] your life just started so no matter what
[1:12:52] the devil said it was what is what God
[1:12:55] says is that right
[1:12:57] remember the little the girl I think the
[1:13:00] baby that the old couple was in the
[1:13:02] hospital and-and-and-and and here was
[1:13:04] the prophet of God a man had prayed for
[1:13:06] the baby and no couple said praise the
[1:13:08] Lord God don't heal my baby in that
[1:13:11] little nurse he said a late third and
[1:13:13] teens
[1:13:14] come on says sir in other words I mean
[1:13:19] she says yes he's dying why would you do
[1:13:22] that say you know never in the history

[1:13:53] god of this earth if you can believe the
[1:13:55] Bible says whatsoever you ask and
[1:13:57] believe it you shall have it
[1:14:03] hey if you can't believe for divine
[1:14:06] healing how can you have a faith that's
[1:14:08] gonna translate you the same God the
[1:14:12] same blood the same power of the blood
[1:14:14] would transform me we renew my mind
[1:14:18] cause me to think like him act like him

[1:14:30] God's how I'm a closed on on these two
[1:14:34] quotes brother well say Satan's power is
[1:14:38] limited faith power brings to pass God's
[1:14:43] reveal revelation god help those who
[1:14:47] cannot act and help themselves now he
[1:14:51] goes on says God's revealed when God
[1:14:53] revealed to you that you're gonna be
[1:14:55] well that your hope that whatever the
[1:14:58] case might be
[1:14:58] the devil I don't care if he send your
[1:15:00] temperature up to the skyrocket or
[1:15:02] whatever he does to you that means
[1:15:04] nothing because he's just a liar and the
[1:15:08] moment he can get you to believe his
[1:15:09] line report he got you is that right oh

[1:15:15] people who was healing in the first time
[1:15:18] they had felt a pain oh I must have lost
[1:15:20] my healing what common stuff is that you
[1:15:25] base your healing on feelings feelings
[1:15:30] has nothing to do with what faith
[1:15:34] produces it's a revelation that God
[1:15:37] gives you and you walked in that
[1:15:39] revelation and it has to happen
[1:15:42] Abraham you're gonna have a child
[1:15:44] absolutely how come God said so brother
[1:15:49] Adam you said she was gonna have Joseph

[1:16:04] was coming I just told you he was coming
[1:16:06] five years after that last baby girl for
[1:16:10] the five years he had Joseph he said if
[1:16:13] you God reveals something to you and you
[1:16:16] believe it no matter how long it takes
[1:16:18] it has to come to pass you gotta be
[1:16:23] somebody bride must be revealed to you
[1:16:27] boom he said listen Satan power is
[1:16:31] limited

[1:16:35] revelation God help those who cannot act
[1:16:38] and help themselves the old dishonouring
[1:16:41] God

[1:18:54] yourself that's when God can use his
[1:18:57] power why why people just let the blood

[1:19:21] power listen he said this little girl
[1:19:23] amen these two little girls Amen one was
[1:19:26] mentally ill and she wanted healing and
[1:19:29] didn't get a prayer card so they went by
[1:19:31] where brother Branham stayed and was
[1:19:32] hoping that some if he came by the
[1:19:35] shadow of the Prophet would heal them he
[1:19:39] said that wasn't so make no make-believe
[1:19:41] faith he heard them crying he went to

[1:19:48] healed he had a vision she was healed he
[1:19:51] wouldn't screaming she shook up the town

[1:21:03] of God and every one of us deserve hell
[1:21:06] hello we sit in here by the grace of God
[1:21:10] and that's by the blood hallelujah and
[1:21:14] none of us worthy to make heaven not

[1:21:23] the blood of Jesus Christ he took your
[1:21:26] sin any perfect he took your judgment he
[1:21:29] took your sin I was thinking about that
[1:21:30] today I said every slap he got that was
[1:21:33] me I should have gotten when they
[1:21:36] knocked him when they spit in his face
[1:21:37] that was me I deserved that
[1:21:42] it's what I deserve I deserve to be
[1:21:45] crucified hallelujah let me take some
[1:21:52] all of us deserve hell in his worst
[1:21:57] whatever we deserved it when Paul says I
[1:22:01] was the cheapest of sinners Paul wasn't
[1:22:03] making up nothing to flatter anybody
[1:22:04] with Paul knew his liar and he knew what
[1:22:07] was in his heart see a lot of time we
[1:22:09] look at people and and what looks on the
[1:22:11] outside
[1:22:12] God don't look at that he sees that too
[1:22:15] but God looks at the heart
[1:22:16] it is the heart is where God's judgment
[1:22:19] starts hmm it's the heart I don't care
[1:22:23] what it looks like to me there's a lot
[1:22:25] of people that go people don't think
[1:22:26] that was in heaven oh they go to be and
[1:22:28] had another come be in heaven but they
[1:22:30] never got their heart right they won't
[1:22:32] be there you got to get your heart right
[1:22:36] and the thing that date that Satan will
[1:22:38] do to you by way of pride he would keep
[1:22:40] you from getting your heart right God
[1:22:43] that blood is there to cleanse that up
[1:22:45] not to let us stay there say it's a
[1:22:47] covering God don't cover sin no more God
[1:22:49] washes it he gets rid of it
[1:22:54] and that's what the blood of Jesus
[1:22:55] Christ come to do only the Bible said
[1:22:57] only the pure heart shall see God let's
[1:23:02] stay as we raised our hands before you
[1:23:13] Lord you see us clearly Lord you said
[1:23:18] even in the dark places it's light to
