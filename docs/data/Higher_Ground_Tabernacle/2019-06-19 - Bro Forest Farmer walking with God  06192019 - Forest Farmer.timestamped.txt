[21:25] [Music]
[21:40] [Music]
[21:48] could I go bless y'all it's good to be
[21:59] with you all again I'd told brother
[22:03] Isiah weave together in a meeting I did
[22:08] brother Frank craters him and my son was
[22:12] preaching and I told him I said I want
[22:15] to get up and visit with y'all sometimes
[22:17] didn't knowing be twice just this quick
[22:20] but just really enjoyed the spirit among
[22:26] y'all you can be seated for a few
[22:28] minutes first off I want to thank you
[22:33] all for sharing your pastor with us up
[22:36] there and Lord willing you are coming to
[22:39] Arkansas here in a few days we're
[22:44] looking forward to it I'll put it like
[22:48] that it just really enjoyed his ministry
[22:51] and you know tonight I'm not a pastor
[22:54] and I won't bring you a pastoral message
[22:57] you've got a pastor to do that but just
[23:01] a little something on my heart maybe
[23:05] encourage y'all a little bit and you
[23:08] know we've all got potential you know
[23:16] the scripture tells us that that if a
[23:18] man says on to his brother raca
[23:23] and you know that's not a word we use
[23:25] all the time so I got to looking it up
[23:28] and it meant of no value said if a man
[23:32] would say to his brother that you're of
[23:34] no value you don't have any potential
[23:37] that he'd be in danger of hellfire I I
[23:40] don't want to fit that category because
[23:43] I believe that we've all got potentially
[23:46] minoo eyes reading a story here the the
[23:52] life story of a general and he was
[23:57] telling that when he was the the lowest
[24:01] grade officer with a commission but
[24:05] there came a time in his life that he
[24:08] they had a need to use him in a capacity
[24:13] that normally would take either a
[24:15] captain or a lieutenant colonel much
[24:19] higher rank that than the lowly
[24:21] lieutenant that he was but the man that
[24:26] placed him in that position to do that
[24:29] job saw the potential that laid in the
[24:33] man and when he went into the job just
[24:37] fulfilled that position flawlessly until
[24:40] they got another high-ranking officer to
[24:43] step in and take that and you know I I
[24:47] think that we could apply that to our
[24:49] lives - if we would our children our
[24:55] little babies know more about trust in
[24:59] the Lord and following the leadership of
[25:02] the Lord
[25:03] but then the denominational pastors know
[25:06] out just because of the word that's been
[25:10] waved over and the presence of the Lord
[25:13] that they've learned to recognize I'm
[25:18] sorry I I'll have y'all stand back up
[25:20] for just a second but I'd like to read
[25:23] two scriptures in Genesis five and and
[25:27] of course we all understand brother
[25:30] Branham talking about it especially
[25:32] through the the seals and and then
[25:36] right on up to the rapture of how that
[25:40] Enoch was our type of the bride for
[25:44] today they you know true enough that
[25:47] Noah a win across the flood but he said
[25:51] that that represented that those that
[25:53] would go through the tribulation but
[25:56] there was a greater type that was given
[25:59] to us and that was a neat of Enoch
[26:01] because he was and then he was not and
[26:05] the Lord took him away and you know I
[26:08] found I I know that there's 12 or 13
[26:13] different places that brother Branham
[26:15] makes reference of that that he uses the
[26:18] term that even if he could not have the
[26:22] faith that Enoch had to just walk with
[26:26] God and then to walk home with one place
[26:33] pardon me not one place but several
[26:36] places brother branham's speaking of
[26:38] Enoch he said that Enoch just walked so
[26:41] far with the Lord that he didn't want to
[26:44] go back home I like that but him being a
[26:51] type of our rapture and brother Branham
[26:56] said that that was the fulfillment for
[26:59] our day of those who are alive and
[27:03] remain I like that if you'd read with me
[27:08] in verse chapter five and verse 22 and
[27:13] Enoch walked with God after he began
[27:17] Mathu Scylla 300 years and he begat sons
[27:23] and daughters and all the days of Enoch
[27:26] were three hundred sixty and five years
[27:29] and Enoch walked with God and he was not
[27:34] for God took a men may the Lord had his
[27:40] blessings to his word and y'all could be
[27:43] seated
[27:44] Minoo we've we've often thought and you
[27:49] know
[27:50] random said something that that is
[27:53] really peculiar and that being that
[27:58] Enoch walked with God he says a number
[28:01] of times for 500 years and wouldn't it
[28:05] be something that time could be
[28:07] accounted to a man that he wasn't even
[28:09] on the face of the earth but that he
[28:12] walked with God and you know it sounds a
[28:15] whole lot to me about life it was that
[28:18] that when the gourd wanted to speak to
[28:20] job then he said joke gird up your loins
[28:23] I'm going to talk to you like a man and
[28:27] then he asked him the question said
[28:29] where was you at when the sons ago and
[28:32] what would it be if God could account
[28:34] time before there ever was time to us of
[28:38] walking with Him but that's kindly were
[28:42] I just like to take a text for just a
[28:45] little bit in and y'all pardon me I'm
[28:48] not used to to using these iPads and all
[28:54] but I may just quote a couple of
[28:58] scriptures to you I know that clifford's
[29:01] already told y'all about me being healed
[29:04] and I thank God for that you know
[29:07] sometimes I feel like that God loves me
[29:09] more than he does anybody else but I
[29:13] think we all Lord a feel that way you
[29:16] know I was the boy that was supposed to
[29:18] be crippled all of his life I'm the boy
[29:21] that had a hundred pounds was supposed
[29:23] to be getting around on crutches but the
[29:26] Lord had something other to say about
[29:28] that you know a winner when mom and dad
[29:32] had four of us kids and and they still
[29:36] wanted another one why I don't know the
[29:39] way that us four was but at any rate
[29:41] that's what they did and and then on
[29:44] spiritual food and due season my mother
[29:46] stepped up in the prayer line there and
[29:50] there was a lady right ahead of my
[29:52] mother and brother branham spoke to her
[29:56] and he said first of all he said you've
[30:00] got a lady's problem and said you're
[30:02] real nervous and your
[30:04] just that age to be nervous and said you
[30:11] have a ladies trouble a female trouble
[30:14] he said and there's another desire that
[30:16] you have you you want the Holy Ghost he
[30:21] said do you believe that if I lay hands
[30:23] upon you the Holy Ghost will come
[30:26] she said yes sir he said you believe
[30:28] that she said yes sir
[30:29] so he steps down any praise for it and
[30:33] he said something along the line of Lord
[30:36] I lay my hands upon this woman in the
[30:38] apostolic form and pray that she would
[30:41] receive the the Holy Ghost and then he
[30:45] tells her he said now just go your way
[30:47] rejoicing it's the children's bread now
[30:50] and about that time my mother stepped up
[30:55] and he said you had a real funny feeling
[30:59] when I said female trouble did you cuz
[31:01] that's what you had well I I'm not real
[31:06] good at English but I do know that had
[31:08] is passed in and he said just going away
[31:14] praising the Lord and I've heard on one
[31:19] of the tapes you could hear my mother in
[31:21] her kentucky english just real faintly
[31:24] saying thank you Lord Jesus now we read
[31:31] in the book of Genesis about how that
[31:34] male chassidut come to Abraham and Sarah
[31:37] and said according to the time of life
[31:40] and all of us that are adults wait but
[31:44] we understand that cycle of life of
[31:46] fertility and that and we know that it
[31:51] happened back there but I want to tell
[31:53] you what I've seen in my life because on
[31:56] July the 17th of 1965 the prophet of God
[32:06] told her that's what you had and
[32:09] according to the time of life on April
[32:12] the 28th of 1960
[32:17] my baby brother was born nine months and
[32:22] ten days later according to the time of
[32:26] life and then you want to tell me that
[32:31] rain cloud was rocket smoke get out of
[32:33] here you tell me how a rocket can blow
[32:37] up and perfectly form the image of the
[32:40] hoffmans head of Christ at 33 and then
[32:43] we'll we might have something to start
[32:45] talking about amen
[32:49] but but you know what we a lot of times
[32:53] I think if we're not real careful we're
[32:57] prone to just write everything off and
[33:00] saying well you know that was true in in
[33:05] brother branham's ministry or that was
[33:07] true in Moses's ministry let me tell you
[33:11] something Moses has fulfilled his time
[33:15] the prophet of God fulfilled his time
[33:19] what he told us when he was here
[33:21] preaching the gospel to us was that the
[33:24] devil couldn't take him off the face of
[33:27] the earth until God accomplished what he
[33:31] desired out of his life amen
[33:35] but now they have gone on but it is
[33:38] become our time now we've had
[33:42] instruction given unto us and we're I'd
[33:48] like to take this text from is the
[33:51] scriptures that we just read of walking
[33:54] with God now I every one of us in here
[33:58] we felt the presence of God we know that
[34:01] there's been times that you knew that
[34:04] you was absolutely walking with the Lord
[34:07] brother Isaiah several years ago I I had
[34:11] been on a missions trip and I was I'd
[34:15] come back into the States and it was a
[34:17] week later and brother Wendell Martin
[34:20] from down here at Pawnee Oklahoma called
[34:22] me up and he said brother force how are
[34:24] you doing I said man I'm doing great I
[34:30] said
[34:31] right now brother Wendell I feel like I
[34:34] just stepped out of the pulpit and it's
[34:37] been a week since I left them I said but
[34:42] you know what ain't sure that I'm
[34:44] content to live any other way you know
[34:51] when you get those highs but we was in
[34:54] if we was in a meeting here three years
[34:58] ago four years ago out in New Mexico
[35:04] brother Manuel Salazar hey and the
[35:08] Saturday night of the meeting III mean
[35:10] the the meetings kicked off our
[35:13] Wednesday night meeting what was what
[35:16] you expect for Saturday night or Sunday
[35:18] morning and and and it just the whole
[35:21] meeting went that way and on that
[35:25] Saturday night it was just like a wave
[35:29] that swept through the building the
[35:33] brother that was speaking he had had
[35:35] something that was binding him up a
[35:37] little bit and he jumped up any hollered
[35:40] he said I'm free and when he did you
[35:43] could tell that he was how long he
[35:46] stayed free I don't know I don't care
[35:49] but right then he was free and then just
[35:53] a few minutes later he was skipping
[35:55] across the platform hollering I'm going
[35:58] in the rapture I'm going in the rapture
[36:01] I'm going and it was just like a you've
[36:05] stood out in the ocean and you get up
[36:08] about chest deep in the water and those
[36:10] big waves come up and it'll just lift
[36:13] you up but that's what it felt like and
[36:16] just a wave and then another wave and
[36:19] another wavin and there was a minister's
[36:22] wife that was setting it back a good
[36:26] ways back that she thought she was
[36:29] leaving right then and she didn't want
[36:32] to leave her little boys she turned
[36:34] around and grabbed him by the hand it
[36:36] was that real I did not expect to get
[36:39] back home
[36:44] at two o'clock the next morning we drove
[36:49] through a little town about four miles
[36:51] before we get to my house and my wife
[36:53] said forced I'm disappointed I said
[36:56] sherry how in the world can you be
[36:59] disciplined she said I didn't think we'd
[37:02] make it I've heard my mother and my
[37:06] daddy talk about when they were going
[37:08] home from the prophet of God preaching
[37:11] the seven seals that they did not expect
[37:14] to make it home because the nearness of
[37:17] the coming of the Lord was so present
[37:20] with them during those services they
[37:23] didn't think that they'd ever make it
[37:25] 300 miles back home from Jeffersonville
[37:27] I know that feeling now all those that's
[37:34] went on before they fulfilled their time
[37:38] but church now it's our time there's a
[37:42] sister used to sing a song said this is
[37:44] my time this is the end time I can't
[37:47] think of another time that I'd rather
[37:49] live I gotta let my light show can't
[37:53] wait til tomorrow I gotta let my little
[37:56] light shine cuz this is my time you
[38:04] remember the prophet of God when he was
[38:06] preaching the message greater is He that
[38:09] is in you and he told the story about
[38:13] being out in Colorado and the storm blew
[38:19] up and they is forecasted in and he told
[38:22] of all the brothers that was out there
[38:24] with him and some of them said that they
[38:27] didn't think that their truck would get
[38:29] out if it came of snow and brother
[38:32] Ibrahim told him he said if you're gonna
[38:33] go just go on and he said now you
[38:36] brothers that stay he said I'll try and
[38:38] stay here and hunt with you he said but
[38:41] I'm telling you if it ever starts
[38:42] snowing he said when you see the first
[38:45] drop of snowfall at all get back to camp
[38:50] he said I've seen it in 15 minutes that
[38:53] didn't be snowing so hard that you can't
[38:55] hardly see your hand in front of your
[38:57] face
[39:01] and so he's up there hunting by yourself
[39:07] by the grace of God I've been allowed to
[39:10] go up in there and he said it looked
[39:17] down couldn't even see the bottoms no
[39:19] more because it was snowing them clouds
[39:22] just a whirling and twisting and sleet
[39:24] blowing and there it was the blizzard
[39:27] forecast for several days a big blizzard
[39:30] coming brother Thomas here brother Tom
[39:32] Simpson coming down from Canada heard
[39:34] the forecast he was advised not to go
[39:36] through that part of the country because
[39:38] this forecast said it'd be a blizzard
[39:41] were you at brother time I think yeah
[39:43] that they're right here and he the the
[39:47] blizzard was coming everybody had done
[39:49] set in for it
[39:50] well I put my gun back under my shirt
[39:53] like this my red shirt started walking
[39:56] down the mountain as I started I got
[39:58] about half a mile from the saddle and oh
[40:02] my the big drops of snow like that and
[40:05] the wind twisting up on that mountain
[40:07] and blowing I couldn't see the bottom no
[40:11] more I can see about 20 feet in front of
[40:14] me or 30 and I known to come right back
[40:17] down this little what we call little hog
[40:19] back a little ridge and then come off to
[40:22] the creek and then I known to follow the
[40:24] creeks and where to go if it got real
[40:27] bad and so then I started down and I got
[40:31] about half way down and something said
[40:34] to me just as plain as you hear me stop
[40:38] and go back well I thought what was I
[40:44] thinking about maybe it's just my mind
[40:46] and I just couldn't make another step
[40:51] forward and he goes on to talk about
[40:57] David woods said David had fixed me a
[41:01] sandwich that morning I think he tried
[41:03] to get even with me for fixing his daddy
[41:06] one one time of onion and honey that's
[41:08] all that we had so so he fix me
[41:11] a balloon you know I don't know what all
[41:13] it was wrapped in there but I had it in
[41:16] my shirt and it done got wet through my
[41:18] shirt and I thought I'll just stop and
[41:21] eat this and maybe I'll it'll be alright
[41:24] then so I pulled out the sandwich about
[41:28] ten o'clock and I started to eat the
[41:29] sandwich and as eyes eat the sandwich
[41:31] I thought now I'll be all right and I
[41:35] started to move on but something said go
[41:38] back where you came from go back through
[41:43] that storm a half a mile or more back up
[41:47] the mountain and into that dark timber
[41:51] where you can hardly see as far as that
[41:54] organ but I'm getting to be an old man
[42:02] and I've been a Christian now for
[42:06] thirty-three years and I know no matter
[42:08] what how ridiculous it seems mind the
[42:13] Lord and do what the Lord says now
[42:20] tonight we could stand here and give you
[42:23] testimonies of what I've seen the Lord
[42:25] do brother Isaiah could do the same
[42:27] thing we could have a test I couldn't
[42:31] hear what the testimony was but I'll
[42:33] find out later we could all give
[42:38] testimonies of what we've seen the Lord
[42:40] do and most of it is because that
[42:45] somebody minded the Lord no matter how
[42:49] ridiculous that it seems amen and I
[42:55] turned him went back to the saddle
[42:57] feeling my way back over sleep getting
[43:00] harder and harder getting darker and
[43:02] darker and I sit there and just put my
[43:05] coat up like this or my shirt over the
[43:08] scope again set down and I thought what
[43:12] am I doing here
[43:13] why would I come back up here and I just
[43:17] waited a few minutes and I started to
[43:20] get up again and as plain as I'd ever
[43:23] want to hear of
[43:25] I said I am the creators of heaven and
[43:28] earth I make the winds and the rain I
[43:32] took off my hat now this is that same
[43:37] prophet that would stand there and time
[43:40] after time the the Lord would discern
[43:43] things through him and you recall him
[43:47] the film there what was it the thirteen
[43:50] or fourteen different things that he
[43:52] tells that lady standing there and he
[43:59] says I said great Jehovah is that you
[44:03] you know sometimes the enemy wants to
[44:06] beat us up because we'll know that the
[44:09] Lord speaking to us and will question
[44:13] even a prophet great Jehovah is that you
[44:18] he said I was the one who made the winds
[44:21] to cease upon the sea I was the one who
[44:25] made the waves to go down I created
[44:28] heavens and earth was not I not the one
[44:32] that told you to speak to those four
[44:35] squirrels and they come into existence I
[44:38] am God now when a voice speaks to you
[44:43] watch the scripture if it's not
[44:46] scriptural you leave it alone I don't
[44:49] care how plain it is you stay away from
[44:52] it
[44:52] I said yes Lord he said speak to those
[44:57] winds in that storm and it'll go away
[45:00] now this Bible lays before me which my
[45:05] life is in that Amen I raised up I said
[45:10] I do not doubt your voice Lord I said
[45:16] clouds snow rain sleet I resent your
[45:23] coming now
[45:28] you get out of here you know sometimes
[45:34] people try and prove who they are but
[45:37] when a man really knows who he is
[45:40] when a man really knows that he's got
[45:43] the word of the Lord for somebody he
[45:45] don't have to pump up nothing he just
[45:48] stand there and speak what the Lord has
[45:51] said he said storm I resent you being
[45:57] here you're coming in the name of Jesus
[46:04] Christ go to your places I say that the
[46:08] Sun must come out immediately and shine
[46:11] for four days till our hunting trip is
[46:14] over and I leave with my brethren and it
[46:17] was just gushing just went like that and
[46:23] it started to go going then it went stop
[46:32] I stood real still my brethren up here
[46:37] was wondering what was happening and the
[46:41] sleet rain stopped and there come a wind
[46:44] whirling down through the mountains
[46:46] lifted up the clouds one went this way
[46:48] east north west and south and within a
[46:51] few minutes the Sun was shining nice and
[46:55] warm
[46:55] that's truth God knows that's truth I
[46:59] just stood there looking around with my
[47:02] hat off looking I you say I got numb all
[47:07] over I thought the very God of creation
[47:09] it's all in his hands what's he telling
[47:13] me and I picked up my gun wiped off the
[47:18] scope started to walk again going down
[47:22] the hill and something said to me why
[47:27] don't you stroll with me through this
[47:30] wilderness walk with me and I said yes
[47:37] Lord with all of my heart
[47:41] it would be one of the greatest things I
[47:44] could do was walk with you so I put my
[47:49] gun over my shoulder and I started
[47:51] walking down through that never I acts
[47:54] late in it virgin timber walking through
[47:58] there and as I did walking along down
[48:01] through these game trails I felt like I
[48:04] believe I'll go up to the place where
[48:07] yesterday was our anniversary and I'll
[48:10] stand there with just a few minutes just
[48:13] as a little salute to me to where it's a
[48:18] little bunch of quaking aspen trees up
[48:21] on the little nob and I said I believe
[48:24] I'll walk up there just as a salute to
[48:27] our anniversary and then I'll go back
[48:30] down this other side in those dark
[48:33] timbers and walk around and go over
[48:35] around by towards corral Peaks and come
[48:39] down that way just walking and rejoicing
[48:43] I was saying father I know that you are
[48:47] walking with me what a privilege there
[48:51] is nobody greater I could be walking
[48:54] with the berry God and that warm
[48:58] sunshine and then if you drop down just
[49:03] a few paragraphs to 1:29 brother branham
[49:07] starts talking about that that as he was
[49:10] thinking about sister median talking
[49:13] about how that she had work around the
[49:15] house and he'd tell her just come here
[49:17] and sit down next to me and so he said
[49:22] well a seat going up here she gets time
[49:27] to do her work going along there
[49:30] thinking that now remember I laid this
[49:32] Bible up here so you'd see that I'm
[49:36] before the word as I was walking along
[49:39] something happened to me I started first
[49:45] I was thinking about when I taking her
[49:48] up on the honeymoon up here she was a
[49:51] pretty little black headed brown-eyed
[49:54] girl
[49:55] I was lifting her over these logs you
[49:57] know and and everything and trying to
[49:59] get her up there this place where I
[50:01] killed some bear and I wanted to show
[50:04] her one and so where I got the these
[50:07] bear and she had on my cowboy boots and
[50:10] that's been about 22 to 21 years before
[50:13] that 22 years I believe it was ago we
[50:17] were married in 1941 and I was picking
[50:20] her up you know over these logs and I
[50:23] thought now poor little fella putting up
[50:26] with me she's done done turned gray yeah
[50:29] I thought well I'm sorry I'm reading so
[50:33] much but just bear with me here a second
[50:36] well and I went brother branham clears
[50:39] his throat and and I hadn't shaved for a
[50:42] few days and I found out I was great too
[50:45] and I seen my beard sticking out here
[50:47] gray and I thought oh boy you're just
[50:50] about finished now see you you're going
[50:53] to do anything you better hurry up
[50:55] you're getting old to see and so as I
[50:59] went along like that something taken
[51:03] place all of a sudden in every motion
[51:08] and principle I was a boy I thought as a
[51:15] boy
[51:22] you know brother Ritchie's telling me
[51:24] here a little bit ago that you just
[51:26] turned 71 and I told you didn't look or
[51:29] act like it and you don't but you also
[51:33] told me that you remember when you turn
[51:35] 40 you know I don't walk as fluid as I
[51:39] did when I was 40 years old anymore but
[51:45] brother Brennan said something happened
[51:47] to me
[51:48] and he said in every motion I was a boy
[51:56] again I thought like a boy in every
[52:10] motion in principle I was a boy I
[52:15] thought as a boy and I had my head down
[52:19] I looked up and just as plain as I ever
[52:23] saw her there she stood sister meaty
[52:26] before me with her arms out and I
[52:30] stopped I rubbed my face I looked I said
[52:33] media is that you honey I looked here I
[52:39] thought now what's happened and I
[52:41] thought yes I'm walking with him
[52:49] anything could happen when you're
[52:51] walking with the Lord when you're
[52:55] walking with him somebody that you've
[52:59] been praying about that you get you've
[53:01] been trying to get hold of and they've
[53:03] been running away from him won't answer
[53:06] your phone call you say whatever you
[53:08] want to about it but I'm a witness of it
[53:11] because I was on a lake down in Arkansas
[53:13] that a couple of young men that I was
[53:16] trying to get a hold of been trying to
[53:18] reach him brother Isaiah for three years
[53:20] and one of them I've been out fishing
[53:22] with him and when I was out fishing it
[53:25] but he was on one side of a brush pile
[53:27] knives on the other was fishing a creek
[53:29] for crappie
[53:30] and the crappie we got it by my Hathor
[53:33] little bitty fellas but they had some
[53:35] big uns
[53:36] down there where they was that and man I
[53:38] set the hook on it and squalled my
[53:41] dragon I got his head up on top of the
[53:43] water and I said he'd go about pound and
[53:45] a half and I said hey look - here here
[53:48] comes a pretty good brilliant or what he
[53:52] comes running around there and he looked
[53:54] out there and he said oh brother farmer
[53:57] he said them's just the little in debt
[53:59] here so I'm out here fishing on the lake
[54:07] by myself a cold front bloating you
[54:10] couldn't hardly hire a hit and finally I
[54:12] got one little in that God and I took
[54:16] him off and I threw him back in the
[54:17] water and I said feller go tell your
[54:19] grandpa come up here and talk to me and
[54:22] you know III went to fishing a little
[54:24] bit and boy I set the hook on one and he
[54:28] squalled my drag and I got his head up
[54:31] on top of the water and I talked to
[54:34] myself sometimes fishing well well and
[54:36] bless it wherever I go you know I take
[54:38] my business partner with me I like
[54:41] having him with me you know and I said
[54:44] looky here here comes a pretty good and
[54:46] when I did my mind went back to fishing
[54:49] with them boys back four or five years
[54:52] before that as soon as I got that fish
[54:54] in I throwed him in the lab well I
[54:56] jerked off my cap and I went to pray and
[54:59] I said Lord you know I've been trying to
[55:00] get a hold of him for for these last
[55:03] three years and he won't even answer my
[55:06] phone call I went on fishing fishing I
[55:09] finished out my fishing trip caught a
[55:12] master fish I got up to the boat ramp
[55:15] when I did I run into a a Pentecostal
[55:18] preacher and talked to him for a little
[55:20] bit actually the way I got started
[55:23] talking just I'm sorry y'all he had a
[55:29] name on his boat and it was
[55:33] quote-unquote the visitation
[55:39] I said sir how did you come by the name
[55:43] on your boat he said well I'm a minister
[55:46] he said I pastor the the first United
[55:50] Pentecostal Church and Olive Branch
[55:51] Mississippi I said okay he said
[55:54] sometimes when I just really need to get
[55:56] away said I'll take the boat out and go
[55:58] fishing and if anybody calls looking for
[56:01] me my wife tells them he's out on
[56:02] visitation I said yeah I like that
[56:10] so we talked there for a few minutes and
[56:13] I got in the truck and pulled my boat
[56:17] out of the water and I was about thirty
[56:20] minutes on my way back home and my
[56:22] telephone rung and I didn't know the
[56:25] number not well this might be a real
[56:27] estate agent calling me with some work
[56:30] that there won't done because that's the
[56:32] work I was doing a mostly for real
[56:35] estate agents I pulled over on the side
[56:38] of the road and I answered it and it's
[56:39] one of them boys that I've been trying
[56:41] to get ahold of for three years he said
[56:44] poor farmer how you doing I said I'm
[56:46] doing fine I said but I don't know how
[56:48] you're doing I said son I just called
[56:51] your name out in prayer standing out in
[56:54] a boat it ain't been two and a half
[56:56] hours ago he said brother farmer I got
[57:01] to get back to where I was with the Lord
[57:03] at one time I said son I want you to
[57:06] know something if there's a desire in
[57:08] your heart to get back to where you was
[57:12] with the Lord there's a place in the
[57:14] arms of the Lord Jesus that was
[57:17] tailor-made for you you know brother I'm
[57:22] talking about that you hug your your
[57:23] sweetheart up to you and there's nobody
[57:25] else that can fit that print I want you
[57:28] to know that the bride of Jesus Christ
[57:30] that's been embraced in the arms of the
[57:33] Lord Jesus there's nobody else that can
[57:36] fit that print like we do oh I'm telling
[57:41] you he's a known time of God yes he is
[57:53] he said yes I'm walking with him and it
[57:58] changed then and I was back an old man
[58:01] again and the vision was gone from me
[58:04] and I stopped put it over my heart and I
[58:13] said Jesus my heart has been so burdened
[58:15] for years I don't have to tell you that
[58:18] I'm burdened I've repented I've repented
[58:20] I've done everything I know and why has
[58:23] it this burden doesn't leave me and I
[58:26] just started walking on as it was a
[58:29] climb this little knob just about 30 or
[58:32] 40 yards in front of me
[58:33] I started up this little Knoll and begin
[58:36] to feel real weak and there was a little
[58:39] quaking aspen out ten inches through a
[58:42] come-up made like a L and then went up
[58:46] again and I just got up there and I felt
[58:49] so weak and I was staggering it I I just
[58:52] I had my cap back on again and I just
[58:55] laid my head up against like this fit me
[58:57] just right to lay my head right here
[59:01] against that little quake and a slight
[59:04] this it's really a poplar it looks like
[59:08] a birch see and it I just laid against
[59:11] there and I was just standing there with
[59:14] my head down that warm Sun hitting me in
[59:16] the back and I think the very God that
[59:20] departed that rain and that wind and I
[59:22] heard something going Pat Pat spat and I
[59:27] thought what's that the water was all
[59:30] blowed off the Sun was out uh what's
[59:33] that spat and I looked down and it was
[59:35] water from my own knives cutting down
[59:38] through the gray beard and dropping off
[59:40] on the dry leaf that God had dried up
[59:43] laying before me
[59:44] and I just stood there like this just
[59:47] against the tree but in my hand this
[59:51] hand down my head laying against the
[59:54] tree my hand on the rifle sling like
[59:56] this standing there crying and I said
[59:59] god I'm not worthy to be your and I said
[1:00:03] I'm sorry I
[1:00:05] made many mistakes I I didn't mean to
[1:00:08] make mistakes Lord you've been so good
[1:00:11] to me my eyes closed
[1:00:12] and I heard something going stomp stomp
[1:00:16] stomp stomp I raised my eyes and
[1:00:20] standing right in front of me come three
[1:00:22] deer and I thought there's brother Evans
[1:00:25] one brother woods one and there's the
[1:00:28] three deer see just what I'm looking for
[1:00:31] now the rain dried up I reached to get
[1:00:34] my rifle I said I can't do that I
[1:00:38] promised him I promised God that I
[1:00:41] wouldn't do that see I promised him I
[1:00:44] wouldn't do it and something said to me
[1:00:46] but there it is and I thought yes that's
[1:00:52] what a man told David one time God
[1:00:55] delivered him into your hands you know
[1:00:58] King Saul and Joab told him said kill
[1:01:00] him there he lays and he said god forbid
[1:01:03] that I'd touch his anointed and those
[1:01:05] deer stood there and looked at me and I
[1:01:08] thought they can't get away there's no
[1:01:11] way for them to get away they're not
[1:01:13] thirty yards from me I got this rifle
[1:01:15] standing here and there's three deer no
[1:01:18] I can't do it I just can't do it
[1:01:22] it was a doing two big fawns and i i i
[1:01:24] just couldn't take the rifle i said i
[1:01:28] can't
[1:01:29] i never moved i just stayed there i said
[1:01:32] i can't do it because i promised god I
[1:01:35] wouldn't do it though then brethren they
[1:01:38] they don't need them deer see I I can't
[1:01:42] do this I just can't do it and that
[1:01:46] don't come walk now listen there'd been
[1:01:49] a hundred men shooting at them up there
[1:01:51] for four or five days scary the first
[1:01:54] sign of red and I had on a red shirt red
[1:01:57] cap first sign they're gone but they
[1:02:00] were standing there all three of them
[1:02:02] looking right at me I said mother take
[1:02:07] your babies and go out in the woods
[1:02:09] you're in my hands your life is in my
[1:02:13] hands I ain't going to hurt you I
[1:02:15] promised God that I wouldn't see
[1:02:18] and she walked closer she would look at
[1:02:22] me all of them walk closer till they
[1:02:25] come so close they could eat out of my
[1:02:28] hands nearly they and the wind blowing
[1:02:32] right on me so she turned around walked
[1:02:36] back a little piece all three of them
[1:02:38] and here she come back again walked
[1:02:41] right up to me I never moved I just
[1:02:44] stood there I said going out into the
[1:02:47] woods I love it to live see your life is
[1:02:52] in my hands but I spare you you couldn't
[1:02:55] get away you know you could I can kill
[1:03:01] all three of them and just about well
[1:03:03] one second three seconds anyhow just as
[1:03:07] fast as I could fire and they couldn't
[1:03:09] get away standing right by me and I said
[1:03:12] I spare you go on and live and I stood
[1:03:15] there and they went walking on went out
[1:03:20] into the woods I wiped my face like that
[1:03:22] and just then something happened a boy
[1:03:27] spoke out just as clear right out of
[1:03:30] them blue skies not a cloud it had all
[1:03:34] been within just a little bit of time
[1:03:37] and a voice spoke out and said you
[1:03:40] remembered your promise didn't you I
[1:03:42] said yes Lord he said I remember mine
[1:03:46] too
[1:03:46] I'll never leave you nor forsake you the
[1:03:52] burden left my heart it hasn't been
[1:03:55] there since may it never be again never
[1:04:01] again then I come to Tucson strange
[1:04:05] thing I have never had so much happening
[1:04:10] since I've come down I I believe it was
[1:04:14] God holding forth a tower
[1:04:16] I believe the time is now at hand for
[1:04:21] something must take place if we could
[1:04:25] only receive this truth now just a
[1:04:31] moment
[1:04:31] if
[1:04:32] we could only realize what this
[1:04:35] scripture means he that is in you is
[1:04:40] greater than he that's in the world we
[1:04:47] can't understand that yet we say we
[1:04:50] believe it and we know it's true but we
[1:04:54] really don't understand it
[1:04:57] greater is He that's in you greater is
[1:05:06] He that's in you than he that's in the
[1:05:11] world what is in you that's greater it's
[1:05:18] Christ The Anointed God that was in
[1:05:23] Christ is in you greater is He that is
[1:05:32] in you than he that in the world
[1:05:38] then if he is in you I said here a
[1:05:46] little bit ago that we could stand and
[1:05:48] give testimony still daylight in the
[1:05:51] morning not I'll tell you this much
[1:05:54] starting about the middle of January
[1:05:58] brother Isaiah when I was on my way out
[1:06:01] to harmony in the desert when I met you
[1:06:05] out there from then until about the
[1:06:09] middle of March I believe if I had
[1:06:12] somebody to write it down in a book I
[1:06:14] could write a book on what I'd sing the
[1:06:17] Lord doing too much time you say all
[1:06:21] brother farmers that that's really good
[1:06:24] it ain't me doing it it's him
[1:06:28] see if a man tries to take your glory
[1:06:32] from the Lord won't share his glory with
[1:06:35] it brother Isaiah continued of time
[1:06:38] after time after time of what you've
[1:06:40] seen the Lord do we go into a foreign
[1:06:42] country brother Isaiah we see the Lord
[1:06:44] do so much more
[1:06:46] but I believe it's because of the
[1:06:48] expectations of the people and also that
[1:06:52] we dedicate ourselves but I have found
[1:06:55] that if we would dedicate ourselves here
[1:06:58] in the States
[1:06:59] the way that we do when we go on a
[1:07:01] foreign trip that the Lord will do just
[1:07:04] as much for it whether it's in our
[1:07:06] Arizona or wherever you're at have you
[1:07:11] ever noticed that the Lord Jesus when he
[1:07:14] gave them instructions he told them
[1:07:17] beginning at Jerusalem when your endued
[1:07:21] with power beginning at Jerusalem I like
[1:07:25] to ask people every once in a while
[1:07:28] where's your Jerusalem when you're
[1:07:31] filled with the Holy Ghost the prophet
[1:07:33] of God told us we've got everything that
[1:07:35] lays within us already when he gives you
[1:07:38] the Holy Ghost to take a rapture right
[1:07:41] then when you're in dude with power
[1:07:44] where's your Jerusalem at whenever that
[1:07:47] starts the prophet of God said somebody
[1:07:49] asked him a young man said should I go
[1:07:51] to a seminary said no he said go out
[1:07:54] your candles lit he said while that
[1:07:57] fires burning don't let it die out amen

[1:08:04] a second it's no it's not you anymore
[1:08:09] living it's him
[1:08:12] living in you see it's not you're
[1:08:16] thinking what you would think about this
[1:08:19] it's what he said about this then if he
[1:08:26] is in you he absolutely would not deny
[1:08:31] what he said he couldn't do it but he
[1:08:36] would keep what he has said and he is
[1:08:41] trying to find that person that he can
[1:08:46] vindicate himself through God is trying
[1:08:53] to find that person
[1:08:57] that he can vindicate himself through
[1:09:03] you know tonight I'd like to ask you why
[1:09:07] can we not just humble ourself about
[1:09:11] like that young Mary that when the angel
[1:09:16] spoke to her and said something that was
[1:09:20] so fantastically strange there's no way
[1:09:26] that this has never happened but because
[1:09:30] it lined up with the word when Isaiah
[1:09:34] said that a virgin shall conceive that
[1:09:37] when the angel came to Mary and told her
[1:09:40] that be this on to you this is this is
[1:09:46] going to be that Mary said be it unto me
[1:09:50] you and I have had an angel through the
[1:09:54] message of the hour to come and tell us
[1:09:57] that God is searching out for some
[1:10:00] person that he can vindicate himself
[1:10:03] through can we not just raise up our
[1:10:07] hands tonight and say Lord be it on to
