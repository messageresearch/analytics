[41:40] just get right into the word of god
[41:41] thank you musicians
[41:45] we always appreciate you so if the enemy
[41:48] ever tells you differently he's a liar
[41:50] you know
[41:51] but we always appreciate you
[41:58] god is good to us
[42:01] and we thank the lord for his goodness
[42:02] and his grace and
[42:04] we're trying not to be long with just
[42:06] god communion tonight and
[42:08] my wife brought it to my attention this
[42:11] is the last communion we're gonna have
[42:14] before the new years
[42:17] i wasn't even thinking about it things
[42:20] have gone
[42:20] by so quickly and i appreciate her
[42:24] reminding me i said hon i didn't
[42:26] remember myself
[42:28] i just knew we were having communion so
[42:30] i thank the lord for his goodness and
[42:32] his grace and
[42:34] i'm so glad to see everybody just
[42:35] overwhelmed with joy
[42:38] if i can't get it i can speak it
[42:45] keith is back there jumping
[42:48] you can't see him folks but he's jumping
[42:52] god is good to us amen hallelujah
[42:56] we we touched on a little something this
[42:58] morning and we'll try to
[43:00] finish it up we were talking about in
[43:03] christ
[43:04] amen he is our only place of worship
[43:08] and you know a lot of times people think
[43:11] it's just the presence of the lord and
[43:12] i'm not talking about
[43:13] his presence i'm talking about himself
[43:17] you know because a lot of times you know
[43:19] he can come and shower down on us but
[43:22] you know we want the rain cloud we want
[43:24] the whole thunder we want the whole
[43:25] voice we want everything that he
[43:27] possessed
[43:28] in us by god's grace amen so let's just
[43:32] turn
[43:33] by the grace of god amen to
[43:36] a passage of scripture here and as we
[43:39] said it's only in christ
[43:42] but we want to ask that you turn with us
[43:43] colossians 3 17 and we're not going to
[43:46] be long
[43:47] we appreciate the lord jesus christ and
[43:49] everything that he's doing for us
[43:52] everything that he's done for us we know
[43:53] that trying times we are in a time where
[43:59] there are a lot of tribulations and
[44:01] trials
[44:04] but we know that we must be tried in the
[44:06] fire this is all part of his process
[44:09] and you know i'm not going to murmur and
[44:11] i'm not going to complain
[44:14] about what he's doing because i can see
[44:16] the finished product
[44:19] you know what this is my only earnest
[44:21] desire to
[44:22] to be able to be transformed into his
[44:25] very image and likeness
[44:27] and we all are trying but we realize
[44:30] amen that the work that god is christ
[44:32] christ has begun in us he will complete
[44:34] it it's nothing we can do
[44:36] and uh we thank god for that let's turn
[44:39] to colossians 3 17
[44:41] and read there it says and whatsoever
[44:43] you do in word or deed
[44:45] do all in the name of the lord jesus
[44:48] giving thanks to god
[44:50] and the father by him
[44:53] and many people reading the bible may
[44:55] not understand that scripture but
[44:57] we know that according to the book of
[44:59] acts jesus said that all power
[45:02] i believe that's the first chapter in
[45:04] heaven and earth is given unto him
[45:06] and so we understand what he means and
[45:08] what paul is writing
[45:10] when he say giving thanks to god in the
[45:12] father by him
[45:14] because if you have the revelation of
[45:15] who jesus christ is
[45:17] you understand that he is the father in
[45:19] creation son
[45:20] and redemption and the holy spirit in
[45:23] the church today
[45:24] so let us pray father god we thank you
[45:27] for your grace we thank you for your
[45:28] mercy
[45:29] we thank you for being so good to us
[45:31] lord
[45:32] you have been better to us than we have
[45:34] been to ourselves
[45:35] and we pray father that you bless lord
[45:38] the service
[45:39] uh this evening as we surrender it all
[45:41] to you to your glory lord in jesus
[45:43] christ's name we pray amen
[45:46] you may be seated this is why we baptize
[45:50] according to matthew 28 19
[45:54] and and we take it all the way down to
[45:56] acts 2 and 38
[45:58] and for those who may be listening uh we
[46:01] are not jesus only
[46:03] but we understand the the oneness of god
[46:06] in a different way than most people do
[46:09] it is a true revelation how that god can
[46:12] be in christ
[46:14] amen but the bible said god was in
[46:16] christ reconciling the world
[46:18] unto himself and showed us that the
[46:21] fullness of the godhead bodily dwelt in
[46:23] jesus christ
[46:25] so we know that the bible also says no
[46:28] man have seen
[46:29] god at any time except the son he has
[46:31] declared him
[46:33] but when we see jesus we see him
[46:37] and so we notice by god's grace as we
[46:40] said today
[46:41] that there is no salvation in
[46:44] any other other than the name of jesus
[46:46] christ
[46:47] amen that's the bible we showed that
[46:50] there is no salvation in churches
[46:52] you say what do you mean there is you
[46:54] know because you're a baptist doesn't
[46:56] mean you're saved
[46:57] because you're a methodist doesn't mean
[46:59] you're saved because you're
[47:00] pentecostal doesn't mean you're saved it
[47:03] doesn't mean you're saved if you even
[47:04] consider yourself
[47:05] message it's whether you have applied
[47:08] the blood of jesus christ
[47:10] because without the blood there is no
[47:11] remission of sin
[47:13] and we understand the bible said he
[47:15] shall save you from
[47:16] your sins not she and so when you talk
[47:19] about
[47:20] the church we're talking about a female
[47:22] a she
[47:23] but it's he he he lamb
[47:27] not she lamb amen amen he was a ram
[47:31] amen uh caught in the thickets is that
[47:34] right
[47:35] and he was a ram amen there on calvary
[47:38] but we we know by god's grace amen that
[47:42] we need to understand what it is what he
[47:45] is in order to understand where we're
[47:47] going
[47:48] right because the bible says all will be
[47:52] deceived except those
[47:53] who are whose names are written in the
[47:56] lamb's book of life
[47:59] and understand so there is only one life
[48:01] and that is the lamb's book of life
[48:04] that is the lamb's life and his life is
[48:07] the
[48:07] is the life of the father is that right
[48:10] because jesus said amen according to
[48:13] uh john 10 30 i
[48:16] and my father are one
[48:19] now we understand that there is only one
[48:21] place
[48:22] and as we said it cannot be a
[48:25] denomination or
[48:26] organization and i'm not saying you know
[48:29] not to go to church because you need to
[48:30] go
[48:31] somewhere but you need to go somewhere
[48:34] where people are preaching the word
[48:36] and understanding is the word of god
[48:38] that you go
[48:39] to receive not the creeds not the dogmas
[48:44] all right not the man-made stuff amen
[48:47] but you must
[48:48] understand that you have come and you go
[48:50] to work go to the church to hear the
[48:52] word
[48:53] to feed on the word to consume that word
[48:55] because it is the word that is going to
[48:58] bring life to you
[48:59] right as we said this morning amen by
[49:02] god's grace that
[49:03] god has a certain place uh a certain
[49:06] place that he even met
[49:07] abraham and abraham worshiped
[49:11] and all through the testament amen and
[49:14] his promised word will be interpreted
[49:17] uh in you by him i like that
[49:21] so you got to understand when when god
[49:23] said the virgin shall concede
[49:26] i believe it took like 400 years before
[49:28] that come to pass
[49:30] but when it did come to pass mary did
[49:33] not have to work at it
[49:35] she was the promised word and that word
[49:38] quicken
[49:39] brought forth a virgin and that virgin's
[49:42] name was mary right the angel came and
[49:46] visited marion's told her
[49:48] that she would be that she would
[49:51] conceive
[49:52] and that child that she would conceive
[49:55] would be emmanuel we would call him
[49:59] jesus now according to
[50:02] isaiah isaiah he called him emmanuel
[50:05] which means god is with us
[50:08] and that's what i don't understand if
[50:11] emmanuel is god
[50:15] with us then who was that called jesus
[50:18] amen he was god with us
[50:22] but god just don't want to be with us he
[50:24] wants to be
[50:25] in us that is its whole purpose
[50:28] to be in us and when god is
[50:32] in us then he can begin to do the work
[50:35] that he had thought of in his mind
[50:38] before the foundation of the world this
[50:41] is why paul
[50:42] says it's not i that lives
[50:45] but christ that lives in me
[50:49] is that all right so we understand him
[50:51] in the word that he promised to fulfill
[50:53] in the
[50:54] the day that you're living in you will
[50:57] be
[50:57] a written epistle of god right
[51:01] of all men right that's what he's
[51:04] talking about
[51:05] it's not talking about you uh living in
[51:07] noah's day
[51:09] nor was that epistle nor was that word
[51:12] moses in his day was that word jesus
[51:15] in his day was that word now there's a
[51:18] day
[51:18] that we call the bride age where we must
[51:21] be
[51:22] just like him doing the same signs
[51:25] the same wonders hallelujah and having
[51:28] the same
[51:28] personality and characteristics
[51:32] of jesus christ himself is that right
[51:35] not what you claim but what god does
[51:38] through you will speak out louder than
[51:42] anything
[51:42] you could claim i like that it's not
[51:45] that i'm claiming to be a christian
[51:47] i'm living it hallelujah that is what we
[51:51] call
[51:52] a testimony when somebody can say
[51:55] man that guy is really a christian you
[51:57] know i
[51:58] tried him and i know he's a christian
[52:01] hallelujah is that right oh it's the
[52:03] truth
[52:04] shadrach meshach and abednego daniel
[52:07] amen what did he say
[52:09] daniel god is god
[52:10] [Laughter]
[52:13] why and he saw that daniel amen
[52:16] were and the hebrew boys in their day
[52:19] was
[52:20] willing to sacrifice you understand me
[52:23] they themselves became the sacrifice
[52:27] to prove that the invisible god that
[52:29] they worship
[52:30] was real and that he's alive and well
[52:35] he smoked he spoke of this age and what
[52:38] would
[52:39] be now see the believer of this age has
[52:42] to believe this
[52:44] and what he promised today you
[52:46] understand me
[52:47] just the same as they had to come into
[52:50] the ark
[52:50] to be saved go out of egypt to be saved
[52:54] they have to come into christ to be
[52:56] saved now
[52:58] into the word message
[53:01] that he's the same yesterday today
[53:05] and forever it's not just claiming it
[53:07] you've got believe it
[53:09] and receive it it's christ only christ
[53:12] alone
[53:13] that's the only place of worship right
[53:16] amen and once he comes into you then you
[53:19] yourself
[53:20] become an idol
[53:23] hallelujah right you become a troll
[53:27] trophy of christ hallelujah
[53:31] you love the lord and his word see
[53:34] you won't have to interpret it he will
[53:37] interpret it through you
[53:39] what you are doing what he promised to
[53:42] do
[53:43] the church that follows him would be so
[53:45] much like him
[53:46] until the people will know
[53:49] amen it won't be any guesswork
[53:52] it's like when god birthed the new
[53:55] testament
[53:56] church and peter and john
[53:59] when they were questioned about healing
[54:01] a man at the gate of call
[54:03] beautiful they said they perceived
[54:07] those priesthood that they were both
[54:10] ignorant and unlearned men but they take
[54:13] notice that they had been with jesus
[54:17] what what was it they were ignorant
[54:20] unlearned
[54:21] but others could see they had been with
[54:24] jesus
[54:25] why because they were doing the same
[54:28] things
[54:29] that jesus was doing silver and gold
[54:32] have i none
[54:33] but such as i have what was it they were
[54:36] the
[54:36] living epistles of their day they were
[54:40] joel two in action y'all understand me
[54:43] and that's what god wants us to be now
[54:46] we
[54:46] are enoch enoch was the bride of jesus
[54:50] christ
[54:50] in type you all agree with that and the
[54:53] bible said by faith
[54:55] enoch was translated that he should not
[54:57] see death
[54:58] and was not found because god had
[55:01] translated him
[55:02] amen but this is the key to it
[55:05] for before his translation
[55:09] huh before his translation i'ma say it
[55:12] again
[55:14] it wasn't that at his translation
[55:17] it was before his translation he had
[55:21] this testimony
[55:23] y'all understand me and right now this
[55:26] is before
[55:27] because we haven't been translated yet
[55:29] this is before
[55:31] the before is now that you and i
[55:34] are to have a tr uh uh testimony
[55:38] that others can see that we're different
[55:42] they might call you holy rollers they
[55:43] may call you fanatics
[55:45] they may call you all kinds of name but
[55:47] one thing for sure
[55:48] while they're calling you all of these
[55:50] names you have a testimony that you're
[55:52] walking with god
[55:54] but without faith is impossible to
[55:56] please god
[55:57] or to please him for he that cometh to
[56:00] god must believe that he is
[56:02] and that he is a reward of them that
[56:04] diligently seek him
[56:05] how many all really believe he's god see
[56:08] what i'm saying you got to believe he's
[56:10] god people
[56:11] and if he's god he has the supreme
[56:13] authority over
[56:14] all things he's omnipotent y'all
[56:17] understand me
[56:18] he's the only potent kate he's the only
[56:20] power amen that we need to look up to
[56:24] hallelujah you love the lord
[56:27] amen we read this earlier like we said
[56:29] we're not going to be long but see all
[56:30] the epistles written in our
[56:32] and we are our epistles written in our
[56:35] where heart see we come to this building
[56:39] but this building really is not the
[56:40] church
[56:42] you are the church of god right
[56:45] you are where you you're the place in
[56:47] your heart right
[56:48] is where god wants to abide
[56:51] hallelujah when god abides in your heart
[56:55] that means the strong man is in the
[56:56] house
[56:59] and when the strong man is in the house
[57:01] the devil can knock
[57:02] all he wants to but he can't whip the
[57:04] throat the strong man
[57:06] y'all understand me in your heart he's
[57:09] your shelter
[57:10] in your heart he's your buckler in your
[57:12] heart he's your sword
[57:14] in your heart he's your defense in your
[57:16] heart
[57:17] he's your protector in your heart he's
[57:19] your shelter
[57:20] in your heart he's you're all in all he
[57:23] will be
[57:24] to you whatever you allow him to be
[57:28] never limit the god that's in your heart
[57:33] [Music]
[57:34] it's so easy to put him in heaven but he
[57:37] ain't in heaven
[57:38] he's here hallelujah
[57:41] you understand me he's on the throne of
[57:44] your heart
[57:46] we forget he's there sometimes we forget
[57:49] he's there but he never leaves you
[57:50] he said i'll never leave you nor will i
[57:52] forsake you
[57:54] and what's so awesome about it he sits
[57:56] on his throne
[57:57] and then you have the angels there
[58:00] guarding you protecting you
[58:02] amen right because you must always
[58:05] remember
[58:06] that the covenant in which he has given
[58:08] to us is
[58:09] unconditional this is the day of grace
[58:15] it doesn't mean we you know it doesn't
[58:17] give us the right to just go do whatever
[58:19] we want to
[58:19] but we know that when we do make
[58:22] mistakes
[58:23] we already have an advocate hallelujah
[58:27] hey i'm so thankful that when god saved
[58:30] me it was once and for all
[58:33] god doesn't have to resave me
[58:36] he saved me once and for all he saved
[58:39] you
[58:39] once and for all now
[58:43] the bible says for as much as you are
[58:45] manifestly declared to be the epistles
[58:47] of christ
[58:48] y'all know what that means that means
[58:50] that you are manifested
[58:53] you have declared your life is declaring
[58:57] what you are the manifested
[59:00] epistles the living word of christ
[59:03] manifested ministered by us written not
[59:06] with
[59:06] ink but the spirit of the living god not
[59:09] in tables of stone
[59:10] but in fleshly tables
[59:13] of the heart is that all right
[59:18] are the living bible right and this is
[59:21] what god is trying to tell us we are the
[59:23] living bible
[59:24] amen what does that mean manifested
[59:27] displaying
[59:29] bringing it to a place where it's
[59:30] clearly seen
[59:32] all can see who you are and what you are
[59:35] right
[59:36] what is holiness what does holy mean
[59:38] being holy
[59:39] but being holy not doesn't mean just
[59:41] just just uh
[59:42] uh declaring it it means doing
[59:46] things right
[59:49] it means to do things right to to to be
[59:52] a sacrifice
[59:53] means to give up that which is most
[59:56] precious to you
[1:00:00] can we do it
[1:00:03] y'all hear me giving up that thing which
[1:00:06] is most precious to you
[1:00:09] that's the way god works that's the way
[1:00:11] he operates
[1:00:12] but understand that if you give it up
[1:00:14] he'll give you more
[1:00:17] is that right abraham
[1:00:20] i need you to leave your country abraham
[1:00:23] the bible said didn't even know where he
[1:00:24] was going
[1:00:26] but he sacrificed he took his family and
[1:00:29] all
[1:00:29] and what happened to abraham in the end
[1:00:32] abraham becomes the father of nations
[1:00:35] right amen when it comes amen to
[1:00:39] sacrifices god told abraham to sacrifice
[1:00:42] his son
[1:00:43] right the most precious thing
[1:00:47] now even though abraham had lived with
[1:00:49] his wife and everything but to have a
[1:00:50] son meant that
[1:00:51] his generation was going to continue and
[1:00:54] god says sacrifice him
[1:00:56] god abraham moved at the fear of god
[1:00:59] i've seen movies
[1:01:01] where they had abraham almost fussing at
[1:01:03] god
[1:01:04] that's not real that's not the way it
[1:01:07] was
[1:01:08] because abraham was like a lamb right
[1:01:11] he followed through with god even though
[1:01:13] he didn't even know
[1:01:14] the end result but he knew that that
[1:01:17] same
[1:01:17] god amen that was able to change him
[1:01:20] from
[1:01:21] uh old to young was also able to raise
[1:01:24] up his son
[1:01:26] hallelujah is that right see and you
[1:01:29] know
[1:01:29] a lot of times people think well my
[1:01:30] reasonable service your reasonable
[1:01:32] service is doing just right
[1:01:35] you know i mean you and i can't repay
[1:01:37] god for anything he's done
[1:01:38] now i'm just talking but we can't repay
[1:01:40] him how
[1:01:42] if you had a thousand hands to praise
[1:01:44] him and clap it still wouldn't be enough
[1:01:47] you can't repay him but your reasonable
[1:01:50] services tried to conduct
[1:01:52] with all your with all that's in you
[1:01:54] conduct yourself as a christian
[1:01:57] the bible says don't even don't even
[1:01:59] suffer for being an evildoer
[1:02:01] if you suffer let it be for the name of
[1:02:03] jesus christ
[1:02:05] in other words you're going to give up
[1:02:07] what all of your bad habits
[1:02:09] you say i quit
[1:02:12] now you got to understand that has a
[1:02:14] confession confession has to come out of
[1:02:16] your mouth first
[1:02:18] then god can work with it god want to
[1:02:20] hear you say it
[1:02:22] god want to hear you declare that you're
[1:02:24] giving it up
[1:02:25] and it may not happen right then but god
[1:02:28] has heard your request
[1:02:29] and god will see to it that it
[1:02:32] disappears from you
[1:02:34] is that all right let me say it like
[1:02:36] this then god will call for an
[1:02:38] allegiance
[1:02:42] he won't self-sacrifice
[1:02:45] because when you self-sacrifice yourself
[1:02:47] you're showing you're giving god your
[1:02:49] ultimate allegiance
[1:02:53] i'll say that again self-sacrifice it's
[1:02:56] when you
[1:02:56] because when you self-sacrifice you're
[1:02:58] giving god your ultimate allegiance
[1:03:02] you know it's easy to sacrifice somebody
[1:03:04] else
[1:03:05] but when it comes to self-sacrifice
[1:03:08] that's something else because even when
[1:03:11] it came to job
[1:03:13] you know the devil says lord i cause him
[1:03:15] to curse you to you
[1:03:16] through your face and and god says yeah
[1:03:20] but i know job
[1:03:23] i trust job i have a uh uh uh trust in
[1:03:26] him
[1:03:27] and said listen devil you can do
[1:03:29] whatever you want to do
[1:03:31] but don't take his oil in his wine
[1:03:33] that's all i say
[1:03:35] i don't care what i go through just keep
[1:03:38] that holy spirit in my
[1:03:39] inside let the oil and the wine stay
[1:03:42] here
[1:03:42] you can go i can go through whatever as
[1:03:45] long as i know that god is with me
[1:03:48] but lord don't make me feel like i'm
[1:03:50] alone
[1:03:52] don't leave me lord you know you know
[1:03:53] david said lord whatever you do don't
[1:03:55] take your holy spirit away from me
[1:03:58] you see but david didn't understand that
[1:04:00] once the holy ghost is in there he never
[1:04:02] leaves
[1:04:03] you know paul says i am crucified with
[1:04:05] christ nevertheless
[1:04:07] nevertheless i live yet not i but christ
[1:04:10] liveth in me
[1:04:11] and the life which i now live in in the
[1:04:13] flesh i live by the faith of the son of
[1:04:16] god
[1:04:16] who loved me and gave himself for me do
[1:04:19] y'all understand what
[1:04:20] what i'm working with let me put it this
[1:04:22] way you come through out of the outer
[1:04:25] court you come into the inner court now
[1:04:26] you're into the holies of holies
[1:04:28] you shut the veil behind you people
[1:04:31] won't ever see you again
[1:04:32] if you stay there the only thing they'll
[1:04:35] ever witness is the shekinah glory
[1:04:38] that's permeating out from that place
[1:04:43] you understand me when you hide in
[1:04:45] christ
[1:04:47] that means they see you
[1:04:50] no more all they see is christ
[1:04:54] and that is the way god wants it to be
[1:04:57] in our lives
[1:04:59] hello god is able
[1:05:02] this is the whole purpose of calvary
[1:05:06] is to bring us back to that place when
[1:05:09] we were hidden
[1:05:10] in christ from the beginning
[1:05:13] right and then paul says listen i do not
[1:05:17] frustrate the grace of god
[1:05:19] for as righteousness come by the law
[1:05:21] then christ is dead
[1:05:23] in vain so let's not frustrate the grace
[1:05:25] of god
[1:05:27] bringing it bringing him back into a law
[1:05:29] like your
[1:05:30] dues and your don'ts is going to save
[1:05:32] you
[1:05:33] i'll say i'm not going to frustrate the
[1:05:35] grace of god because i realize
[1:05:37] righteousness don't come by the law
[1:05:40] y'all understand me see when you when
[1:05:42] you can realize amen
[1:05:44] that you are set free god don't justify
[1:05:48] you as if you never sin in the first
[1:05:50] place every time you sin that's once and
[1:05:52] for all
[1:05:54] but it's so difficult for us to
[1:05:56] understand amen
[1:05:58] how the law of life works
[1:06:01] when the law of life is working in you
[1:06:03] you don't have to do anything
[1:06:05] it's the law of life that's working it
[1:06:08] destroys the darkness in your life not
[1:06:11] you
[1:06:12] brother i'm saying you keep drinking you
[1:06:14] keep drinking you keep drinking
[1:06:16] and that life in you will keep pushing
[1:06:18] out keep pushing out
[1:06:19] keep pushing out see if we we're just
[1:06:22] responsible
[1:06:23] for eating the word staying in the
[1:06:26] presence of god
[1:06:27] and god is responsible for bringing the
[1:06:30] change
[1:06:31] because the bible says no man can add
[1:06:33] one cubit
[1:06:35] to his statue right galatians 6 15-16
[1:06:39] for
[1:06:40] in christ jesus neither circumcision
[1:06:42] availeth anything
[1:06:44] nor uncircumcision what but a new
[1:06:46] creature
[1:06:48] that means your religion means nothing
[1:06:51] whether you be gentile or jew
[1:06:53] circumcised on the eighth day nicodemus
[1:06:56] you must be born again
[1:06:59] see what i'm saying so all of those
[1:07:01] things mean nothing the only thing that
[1:07:03] god is interested in
[1:07:05] as far as you and i are concerned is to
[1:07:07] see
[1:07:08] a new creature where all things are
[1:07:12] passed away
[1:07:12] and behold all things become new that's
[1:07:15] what our aim is
[1:07:16] to make sure we have become new
[1:07:19] creatures
[1:07:20] in christ right for as many as walk
[1:07:23] according to the rule peace be unto them
[1:07:26] and mercy and upon the the
[1:07:29] upon the israel of god you see what i'm
[1:07:31] saying
[1:07:32] as many as walk according to this rule
[1:07:35] what rule
[1:07:36] the rule of becoming a new creature
[1:07:39] in christ a new creature
[1:07:42] not a patched up jaw a new creature
[1:07:47] hello you love the word second
[1:07:49] corinthians 5 17 i'm just going to go
[1:07:51] through a few scriptures here
[1:07:52] because i know that today has been long
[1:07:54] we've got the
[1:07:55] your communion still but let me read
[1:07:57] this uh beginning at the 17th verse of
[1:08:00] the fifth chapter of second corinthians
[1:08:02] therefore if any man be in christ he is
[1:08:04] a
[1:08:05] new creature all things are passed away
[1:08:08] and behold
[1:08:09] all things are become new the scripture
[1:08:13] cannot lie this is a
[1:08:16] is an experience that every believer
[1:08:20] must have and all things
[1:08:24] of god who have reconciled us to himself
[1:08:28] by jesus christ and have given to us the
[1:08:31] ministry
[1:08:32] of reconciliation let me ask you how do
[1:08:35] you know you're a new creature
[1:08:37] is when your appetite changes
[1:08:40] maybe you as a hog right but now you are
[1:08:44] dove
[1:08:46] right but your desire is to eat dove
[1:08:48] food
[1:08:50] you understand me that's how you know
[1:08:52] you change
[1:08:53] when you want the word when you hunger
[1:08:55] and thirst for righteousness
[1:08:57] you're changed a devil cannot hunger and
[1:09:00] thirst for righteousness
[1:09:02] a devil doesn't care but when you hunger
[1:09:06] and thirst for righteousness that means
[1:09:08] something is
[1:09:09] inside of you pulling for some food
[1:09:13] a baby something has been born in you
[1:09:18] and so now you're searching and you're
[1:09:20] looking for those things
[1:09:21] that's going to make you grow and mature
[1:09:24] is that right
[1:09:28] and all things are of god who have
[1:09:29] reconciled us to himself by
[1:09:31] jesus christ and has given to us the
[1:09:33] ministry of reconciliation
[1:09:35] to which that god was in christ
[1:09:36] reconciling the world unto himself
[1:09:38] not imputing their trespasses unto them
[1:09:41] and have committed unto us the word of
[1:09:43] reconciliation
[1:09:44] now we are ambassadors for christ
[1:09:48] as though god did beseech you by us we
[1:09:50] pray you in christ's stead be reconciled
[1:09:52] to god
[1:09:54] for he have made him to be sin
[1:09:57] for us you can't get through that who
[1:10:02] knew
[1:10:02] no sin that we
[1:10:05] might be made the righteousness of god
[1:10:09] in him and made being made
[1:10:12] is a process you understand me
[1:10:16] we become the righteousness of god
[1:10:20] hallelujah amen amen amen go
[1:10:23] uh turn to james now because i want you
[1:10:25] to understand uh what we go through
[1:10:28] james 1 12-15 says blessed is the man
[1:10:31] that endured temptation for when he is
[1:10:33] tried he shall receive a crown of life
[1:10:36] which the lord had promised to them that
[1:10:38] love him
[1:10:40] you will have to go through temptation
[1:10:42] and trials there's no
[1:10:44] other way remember revelations three
[1:10:46] when you've been called
[1:10:47] in in in the book of in laodicea was
[1:10:50] called to be what
[1:10:52] tried in the fire gold tried in the fire
[1:10:56] of all the ages god is calling gold
[1:10:59] and gold represents deity tried
[1:11:02] in the fire and how do we
[1:11:06] we hold fast to him right let no man
[1:11:09] say when he is tempted i am tempted of
[1:11:11] god for god cannot be tempted with evil
[1:11:14] neither tempted he in a man but every
[1:11:17] man is tempted when he is drawn away of
[1:11:20] his own lust
[1:11:21] and enticed so there is something that's
[1:11:23] not dead yet something or spirit that
[1:11:27] you have allowed to enter in
[1:11:28] amen and uh god said when you're drawn
[1:11:31] away is your own thing that's happening
[1:11:33] but by god's grace amen god is more than
[1:11:36] able to kill the enemy
[1:11:38] right then when lusts have conceived it
[1:11:40] bringeth for sin
[1:11:41] and sin when it's finished it bringeth
[1:11:43] forth death
[1:11:45] so understand what what death is he's
[1:11:47] saying you're going to die
[1:11:49] it means at that moment you're separated
[1:11:51] is that right
[1:11:52] but brother adam said when that nature
[1:11:54] chur turns from
[1:11:55] amen a lamb to a goat say he doesn't
[1:11:58] leave you he just goes off on a limb
[1:12:00] until you repent and then that goat
[1:12:03] nature moves away
[1:12:04] and then the lamb nature comes back so
[1:12:07] it's just that
[1:12:08] separation that he's speaking of and
[1:12:10] that temporary
[1:12:11] that's a temporary separation until you
[1:12:13] repent of your sin and make things right
[1:12:16] you love the lord amen i've got one more
[1:12:18] scripture to your mind
[1:12:20] and i go back to uh romans 12 1-2 i
[1:12:24] beseech you therefore brethren
[1:12:26] by the mercies of god that you present
[1:12:27] your bodies a living sacrifice
[1:12:30] wholly acceptable unto god which is your
[1:12:32] reasonable service
[1:12:34] and be not conformed to this world you
[1:12:36] know why i said he said reasonable
[1:12:37] service because a lot of times people
[1:12:39] say
[1:12:39] i don't do this and i don't do that and
[1:12:42] i don't do this and when you
[1:12:43] when you go on that tangent that kind of
[1:12:46] a thing
[1:12:47] you develop a self-righteousness
[1:12:50] you forget that your righteousness is of
[1:12:52] god hallelujah
[1:12:54] amen you say well i i you know
[1:12:57] i i ain't never smoking i i i've never
[1:13:00] drank
[1:13:01] but see that's still the grace of god
[1:13:03] there's a lot of people who've never
[1:13:04] smoked and never drank and still sinners
[1:13:07] right but you got to understand that if
[1:13:10] god gives you grace to
[1:13:11] overcome something it's it's so that you
[1:13:14] can give grace and mercy to others
[1:13:17] right we're here as testimonies that's
[1:13:19] why it's always good to communicate one
[1:13:22] with another
[1:13:22] because we can then in turn strengthen
[1:13:26] your brother or your sister is that
[1:13:28] right
[1:13:29] not looking down even the bible says
[1:13:31] when you see your brothers doing wrong
[1:13:33] be careful the attitude
[1:13:34] that you have because if you're not
[1:13:36] careful the thing that he's doing wrong
[1:13:39] will come upon you
[1:13:40] so god doesn't like those things we must
[1:13:42] always judge
[1:13:43] righteously and that righteous judgment
[1:13:47] is with grace
[1:13:48] mercy and truth and be not conformed to
[1:13:51] this world but be
[1:13:52] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[1:13:54] that you may prove what is the good and
[1:13:56] acceptable and perfect will of god
[1:13:59] that brings you right into the holies of
[1:14:00] holies
[1:14:02] because that is the perfect will of god
[1:14:05] for all day
[1:14:06] a transforming people a transformation
[1:14:09] among people
[1:14:10] that brings them back to the state of
[1:14:13] being
[1:14:14] that they were before the fall
[1:14:17] that's the purpose you and i are it
[1:14:20] we're the ones i'm so glad i'm one of
[1:14:23] them
[1:14:24] we're the people that god has chosen and
[1:14:26] elected to go into the holies of holies
[1:14:29] right and and so we ought to be excited
[1:14:32] about it
[1:14:34] you know it's amazing because
[1:14:37] it's amazing because esther and i'm
[1:14:39] closing but you know you think about a
[1:14:41] little esther who
[1:14:42] who nobody who even knew who she was
[1:14:46] you know and yet and still god knew
[1:14:50] and can you imagine i'm telling y'all
[1:14:52] whether y'all know that or not
[1:14:53] the people in that over in that country
[1:14:56] uh you you rarely find an ugly one
[1:15:00] it's the truth persians were beautiful
[1:15:02] people
[1:15:04] did y'all know that they were beautiful
[1:15:07] i mean
[1:15:08] i won't go into that but they were very
[1:15:09] beautiful people and to find an ugly one
[1:15:12] was
[1:15:13] was a strange thing and so what they did
[1:15:16] they went and they
[1:15:17] went and they sought for the most
[1:15:19] beautiful ones
[1:15:21] right and esther was one of those
[1:15:24] right and so but she didn't believe it i
[1:15:27] mean you know it wasn't like
[1:15:29] esther was the prettiest of all it she
[1:15:32] may have been
[1:15:33] according to the king's eyes but there
[1:15:35] were beautiful women
[1:15:36] everywhere and if you know women they
[1:15:39] always compare themselves to each other
[1:15:42] and perhaps esther felt like unworthy
[1:15:44] just to be there
[1:15:45] but nevertheless it wasn't what the king
[1:15:48] was looking at
[1:15:49] see that's what we must understand we
[1:15:51] may not have all the fancy faint dangles
[1:15:53] and
[1:15:54] all of the things that goes with the
[1:15:55] glorified church of this world
[1:15:57] but we know one thing is what we're
[1:16:00] trying to do is catch the eye of the
[1:16:01] king
[1:16:02] and as long as we catch the eye of the
[1:16:04] king we don't have to worry about nobody
[1:16:06] else because no matter how simple esther
[1:16:09] looked
[1:16:10] she was the one the king eyes caught
[1:16:14] right and so she was chosen
[1:16:17] and i can't imagine when the king began
[1:16:20] to call on her
[1:16:23] and then call on her again and the next
[1:16:26] thing you know esther was
[1:16:28] his wife understand people
[1:16:31] when god calls and he brings you into
[1:16:33] this place
[1:16:35] there is no way there is no getting away
[1:16:39] you understand what i mean there is no
[1:16:42] getting away
[1:16:43] once you have made the connection with
[1:16:45] him the word
[1:16:47] it pulls you into him
[1:16:51] it pulls you into him and i say to you
[1:16:54] tonight
[1:16:55] don't fight the pool just let god pull
[1:16:58] you into him
[1:16:59] at his own pace at his own time
[1:17:02] don't frustrate it just know that god
[1:17:05] has chosen you to be his queen his wife
[1:17:07] his bride
[1:17:09] and understanding this is all in christ
[1:17:12] this is all in christ i'ma say it again
[1:17:14] it's
[1:17:15] all in christ it's not in your laws it's
[1:17:18] not in your rules
[1:17:19] it's not in your regulations it's not in
[1:17:21] your creed or your codes not even your
[1:17:23] organizations your denominations
[1:17:25] it's all about christ in you
[1:17:31] that's what paul says christ in you
[1:17:35] the hope of glory and now we're going to
[1:17:38] change the order of our service
[1:17:41] we appreciate you and i trust that
[1:17:44] something was said to encourage you
[1:17:46] and to let you see the day that we're
[1:17:49] living in
[1:17:50] and i don't know i i everybody must
[1:17:52] struggle with their flesh
[1:17:53] i do but you know in my soul
[1:17:56] i know what i want i know what i want
[1:17:59] and i
[1:18:00] i refuse to give that up i refuse to
[1:18:03] give that up
[1:18:04] we all make mistakes we do but when your
[1:18:07] soul is crying out for god that means
[1:18:09] god is going to respond
[1:18:11] and that's what we need to do just wait
[1:18:13] for god wait on him and wait for him
[1:18:15] he has never failed us yet amen and as
[1:18:19] we change the word of our service
[1:18:21] we're going to go and not compete we ask
[1:18:23] our solely to come
[1:18:25] lead us in a few songs amen as i prepare
[1:18:28] ourselves
[1:18:30] i am so grateful that god has brought me
[1:18:33] another year another year he has brought
[1:18:37] me
[1:18:38] uh into a place
[1:18:42] where i can worship and serve him
[1:18:45] and uh know that i am worshiping him
[1:18:49] in spirit and in truth to me that is
[1:18:52] amazing
[1:18:54] i'm not smart enough to know i don't
[1:18:56] have the intellectual
[1:18:58] capital capabilities of being able to
[1:19:02] determine what is and what is not
[1:19:04] but i thank god for the leadership of
[1:19:06] the holy spirit
[1:19:08] he has led
[1:19:24] [Music]
[1:19:31] it is
[1:19:38] he makes all things beautiful
[1:19:46] in his time
[1:19:52] oh lord please show
[1:19:55] me every day
[1:20:00] as you're teaching me
[1:20:04] your way that you
[1:20:08] do just what you
[1:20:12] say in your
[1:20:16] time
[1:20:19] [Music]
[1:20:27] in your time
[1:20:33] you make all things
[1:20:47] [Music]
[1:21:13] time
[1:21:18] in his time
[1:21:24] he makes all things beautiful
[1:21:30] in his time
[1:21:35] oh lord please show me
[1:21:39] every day as you're
[1:21:43] teaching me your way
[1:21:48] and you do just what
[1:21:52] you say in your
[1:22:00] amen we appreciate the lord jesus
[1:22:06] amen we're going to
[1:22:14] read the scripture but before i read i
[1:22:18] just want to pray over the bread by
[1:22:21] god's grace
[1:22:26] let us pray father we thank you for
[1:22:29] this time of communion the last
[1:22:31] communion of
[1:22:33] this year 2020 lord things have traveled
[1:22:37] and moved so quickly
[1:22:40] and father we know that it's pressing us
[1:22:42] closer to your coming
[1:22:45] lord we anticipate your coming and we
[1:22:47] pray by your grace that you are
[1:22:49] counters worthy to escape this place
[1:22:54] lord bless the family of god
[1:22:57] no matter where they may be we pray that
[1:23:00] you bless the bread that we
[1:23:02] are now about to break how it represents
[1:23:06] your body lord broken for us on calvary
[1:23:10] we're getting ready to participate in
[1:23:11] the drinking of wine which is
[1:23:14] a symbol symbol of your blood that shed
[1:23:17] on calvary
[1:23:19] this is what we do lord to honor you
[1:23:23] you told us to always remember
[1:23:25] hallelujah
[1:23:26] and father god we will always remember
[1:23:28] you
[1:23:29] bless lord the servants the bread the
[1:23:32] wine
[1:23:34] in jesus christ's name we pray amen
[1:23:42] and when he had given thanks he break it
[1:23:44] and said take eat
[1:23:46] this is my body which is broken for you
[1:23:49] this dude in remembrance of me and after
[1:23:52] the same manner also he took the cup
[1:23:54] when he had sup
[1:23:55] saying this is the new testament in my
[1:23:58] blood
[1:23:59] this do ye as often as you drink it in
[1:24:01] remembrance of me
[1:24:03] for as often as you eat this bread and
[1:24:05] drink this cup you do
[1:24:07] show the lord's death till he come
[1:24:10] wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread
[1:24:12] and drink this cup until
[1:24:13] of the lord unworthily shall be guilty
[1:24:16] of the body and blood of the lord
[1:24:18] but let a man examine himself and let
[1:24:20] him
[1:24:21] eat of that bread and drink of that cup
[1:24:24] for he that eateth and drinketh
[1:24:26] unworthily eaten and drinketh damnation
[1:24:28] to himself
[1:24:29] not discerning the lord's body for this
[1:24:31] cause many are
[1:24:32] weak and sickly among you and many sleep
[1:24:36] for if we would judge ourselves we
[1:24:39] should not be judged
[1:24:41] but when we are judged we are chastened
[1:24:43] of the lord
[1:24:44] that we should not be condemned with the
[1:24:46] world
[1:24:48] wherefore my brethren when you come
[1:24:49] together to eat tarry one for another
[1:24:52] if any man hunger let him eat at home
[1:24:55] that you could come together not
[1:24:58] together excuse me
[1:24:59] under condemnation and the rest i was
[1:25:01] set in order
[1:25:02] when i come those who are participating
[1:25:05] may come out
[1:25:14] [Music]
[1:26:05] [Music]
[1:26:28] when he had given thanks he break it and
[1:26:30] said take eat this is my body which is
[1:26:33] broken for you
[1:26:34] this student remembers of me let us eat
[1:26:50] [Music]
[1:26:56] [Music]
[1:27:13] after the same amount he also took the
[1:27:15] cup when he had stopped saying
[1:27:17] this cup is the new testament in my
[1:27:19] blood this do e is often that you drink
[1:27:21] it
[1:27:22] in remembrance of me
[1:27:33] [Music]
[1:31:19] [Music]
