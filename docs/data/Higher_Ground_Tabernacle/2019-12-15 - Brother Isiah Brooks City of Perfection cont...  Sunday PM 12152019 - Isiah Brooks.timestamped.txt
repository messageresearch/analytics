[30:37] glad to be a Christian money can't buy
[30:41] Oh
[30:44] and that song it's amazing when you're
[30:50] little I remember as a child that was
[30:53] one of my favorite songs in the Baptist
[30:56] Church and I don't know whether it was
[30:58] cause they March the other way but I
[31:02] love that song so much that even as a
[31:06] child I was seeing that song so every
[31:09] time I hear it it just brings fond
[31:11] memories and I can see those old Baptist
[31:13] sisters as they walked and they twist
[31:15] with those big old hats yes one Lito
[31:22] days we will be marching right on in
[31:25] there we're gonna we gonna start the
[31:28] service again with the same Scripture
[31:31] ibaka - I love this word it's amazing
[31:38] you know how in case you see how Noah
[31:42] must have felt having a mega church and
[31:46] it drops down to eight Amen even the
[31:53] even animals knew better they did least
[31:56] came to church they did go to church but
[31:59] you know human beings it's amazing how
[32:02] they just don't get it it's got to be
[32:05] Grace and we appreciate the Lord a
[32:10] backhoe - two through four and the Lord
[32:14] answered me and said write the vision
[32:17] and make it plain upon tables that he
[32:21] may run that readeth it for the vision
[32:25] is yet for an appointed time
[32:27] but at the end it shall speak and not
[32:31] lie though it Terry wait for it because
[32:35] it was surely calm it will not tarry
[32:39] behold this soul which has lifted up its
[32:42] not upright in him but the judge shall
[32:46] live by his faith I love that because I
[32:52] don't know how to live by my own I
[32:54] really mean here father God we come
[32:58] before you we thank you for your grace
[33:00] and your mercy we thank you for being so
[33:02] good to us Lord you have been better to
[33:05] us and we have been to ourselves and we
[33:09] pray father God that your perfect will
[33:11] be done here this evening we thank you
[33:14] for those souls that did come out this
[33:16] evening to hear your word bless them in
[33:19] a special way father we'll be careful to
[33:22] give you the praise glory and honor in
[33:24] Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may
[33:27] be seated
[33:39] sometimes I'm thinking I'm I told my
[33:43] wife I said I trust and hope that's
[33:45] really getting over I believe the word
[33:50] and I think about when God told Noah
[33:55] then a flood was coming no I had no book
[34:00] to read
[34:02] there was no seminary or any place that
[34:05] Noah could go to get this information
[34:08] so where did Noah get this information
[34:12] we find out that God by way of thought
[34:18] drops into your heart revelation and
[34:24] when that revelation strike you've got
[34:28] to move the thing about revelation is
[34:33] that everybody doesn't receive it at the
[34:35] same time and sometimes you may be the
[34:38] only individual that catches this
[34:41] revelation but when that revelation
[34:44] strikes you is not dead is active the
[34:50] reason why it is God in the form of
[34:54] Revelation see we think revelation is
[34:56] just something for some thought but in
[34:58] reality it is the mind of God dropping
[35:02] into your soul causing you to act as he
[35:07] would act revelation like the prophet of
[35:10] God said when we get over there we're
[35:12] going to see how valuable revelation was
[35:15] because revelation is God that's the
[35:18] only way that Abel would have understood
[35:21] God he had perhaps Adam and Eve as
[35:25] parents who could have told him about
[35:27] what took place but deserts a make you a
[35:30] believer when you hear the word that is
[35:34] not what it's when God quickens that
[35:36] when that revelation becomes real to you
[35:39] when it opens up a window of eternity
[35:42] and then you'll be able to see what he's
[35:44] talking about
[35:46] it's more than just a letter it becomes
[35:48] life and we we're talking about a city
[35:54] of perfection you and I can't make that
[35:58] city as we are we all come short of the
[36:03] glory of God and even when the lamb
[36:06] opened the book remember there was only
[36:09] one who was worthy to open the book John
[36:12] wasn't worried that Jeremiah wasn't
[36:14] worthy none of the prophets of old were
[36:16] worthy the 24 elders amen saw the lamb
[36:20] and they threw their crowns off they
[36:22] fell on their faces because they
[36:26] realized they were not worried that John
[36:27] wept because he understood that he
[36:30] wasn't worthy and there was only one
[36:32] word and that was a Lamb of God so we
[36:36] understand by the grace of God this
[36:38] message that we have amen is not based
[36:41] upon worthiness it's based upon His
[36:45] grace is that right because we see in a
[36:49] Cariah that the whole Kent headstone
[36:51] comes down crying grace grace we
[36:55] understand grace and understand grace is
[36:59] a revelation hallelujah Oh glory to God
[37:04] as we said this morning we are here to
[37:08] express something you know if Noah had
[37:13] gotten a real revelation from God and
[37:15] set down on it we would have never had
[37:19] anybody to be saved because the flood
[37:22] would have consumed everything in
[37:25] everyone but once the revelation struck
[37:28] him he couldn't explain to anybody he
[37:30] had never seen rain himself but he knew
[37:34] it was going to happen and by revelation
[37:37] no doubt God showed him but how can you
[37:39] explain something supernatural to a man
[37:42] that's natural and he moved with the
[37:46] fear of God because amen he became the
[37:50] expression of God's thoughts you
[37:54] understand me
[37:55] he literally became the expression
[37:59] God's Word for his day and that's where
[38:04] I'm trying to get the people to see that
[38:07] God did not call us to be religious he
[38:10] did not call us to become a church God
[38:12] called us to be the expression of the
[38:15] word for our day if we come short of
[38:20] that it shows that we are not the word
[38:24] right because the word is active it is
[38:27] alive it moves it lives it literally is
[38:31] the thought of God behind veils whoa
[38:36] expressing itself genuine Christian
[38:40] faith moves with reverence and fear they
[38:46] cannot even explain it but it's like
[38:49] something that jumps in them and
[38:51] operates itself through them what would
[38:55] make a young girl by the name of Mary
[38:57] say to to the angel be it unto me
[39:00] according to thy word understanding that
[39:06] because she allows this to happen
[39:08] persecution is on the way see there's no
[39:11] way that you oh Lord
[39:13] I choose to walk with you but understand
[39:15] when you have made that choice to walk
[39:18] with God Amen you have made that choice
[39:21] to suffer with God because he said if
[39:23] you suffer with me your reign with me
[39:26] and I believe with all of my heart every
[39:30] one of us has to make that choice in
[39:32] this day look at us amen we're not a
[39:36] make a Church we're not even what you
[39:40] would call a regular Church but neither
[39:45] was Noah and we we understand by God's
[39:50] grace that Noah was the own wasn't the
[39:52] only one building building ships there
[39:56] were other ships that were built you
[39:58] said well how could that because
[39:59] remember when the original come forth
[40:02] there's always a copycat
[40:04] there's always somebody saying well you
[40:07] know I can do that or I can do a better
[40:09] job or if it does happen
[40:11] want to be prepared understand by God's
[40:14] grace science is trying to outrun the
[40:18] judgment of God they're literally trying
[40:21] to find other worlds and other places to
[40:25] build other kingdoms but they failed to
[40:28] see the Bible said the heavens and the
[40:31] earth will pass away there's no safe
[40:34] place on earth
[40:35] to escape the wrath of God but there is
[40:39] a place hallelujah but the place in
[40:43] which we're speaking of is in a duct
[40:45] another dimension hallelujah but is real
[40:48] is that right will we talk about God
[40:53] allowing genuine faith to strike a
[40:56] person it anchors within that person's
[40:58] heart so much so that if it's real if it
[41:02] when it's real it doesn't matter if a
[41:04] person is in a wheelchair they're
[41:06] getting up y'all hear me what about a
[41:09] person who's never seen never had
[41:12] eyesight but when the revelation strikes
[41:16] them all of a sudden their eyes come
[41:18] open we can't explain it because it's
[41:21] supernatural but his faith is something
[41:25] that's given to that individual
[41:28] hallelujah is that right as I was
[41:31] talking to her brother the other day
[41:33] what's called what what what faith did
[41:36] that did Lazard have when he was dead
[41:39] there was nothing that Lazarus could do
[41:42] he was there wherever he was he we don't
[41:46] know but never didn't have ears to hear
[41:49] in the natural he didn't have eyes to
[41:52] see in the natural but when Jesus said
[41:54] Lazarus come forth you see something
[41:58] about faith you must understand that
[42:00] faith is not a thing faith is God it is
[42:06] a person it is God acting on his behalf
[42:09] when God said do something he doesn't
[42:13] leave it up to you to do it God does it
[42:15] himself
[42:15] God rewards us for allowing him to use
[42:20] our bodies woo somebody help me here
[42:24] yeah
[42:25] you saw what do you mean brother a
[42:28] genuine faith as I said Amen and I'm
[42:31] talking about
[42:32] what's happening today because we've got
[42:34] so many people in the message and
[42:37] they're failing to have this genuine
[42:41] faith to press on and to move toward
[42:45] perfection this is our move this is our
[42:48] grace that God has given us time and
[42:51] there's a lot of us time to come into a
[42:54] perfect statue of Christ is that right
[42:57] yeah man and you must understand that
[43:01] except the Lord builds the house the
[43:04] laborers lavery in main.c is God
[43:08] building you not you building you is
[43:10] that right in the message statue of a
[43:13] perfect man brother man said you don't
[43:14] add to it it has to you and God knows
[43:18] the path is that right if the vow said
[43:21] he's our Shepherd and the Shepherd knows
[43:23] the path in which he leads you
[43:26] everybody's path is different but
[43:29] there's only one door one entrance into
[43:31] that place where we are going amen
[43:34] Strait is the gate and narrow is the way
[43:36] that leadeth to eternal life and only a
[43:40] few be that find it this is why I'm
[43:42] screaming you know because I see things
[43:47] I feel things I can't even explain
[43:48] things that are going and it I can
[43:51] imagine I'm nobody I'm no great one but
[43:54] one thing I do know and I believe from
[43:56] the depths of my heart is that we're not
[43:58] far from a translation I believe that
[44:02] with all my heart and I think people are
[44:05] looking in the wrong place for the wrong
[44:07] symptoms you know what what we should be
[44:10] like brother man said he talked about he
[44:12] said if you want to know where the time
[44:13] where time is he said watch Israel
[44:16] hallelujah and I'm gonna say when you
[44:18] know if you can if God said watch Israel
[44:21] what about the bride you understand me
[44:23] amen he gave us a preview of the rapture
[44:28] he gave us a preview of all of the women
[44:31] a brides that were going to march before
[44:33] that that counsel that that's that that
[44:37] judgment seat
[44:38] right he sold us amen all of those women
[44:42] marching amen and how one became worse
[44:45] than the other he said Miss America was
[44:48] the worst of all hallelujah and he threw
[44:52] up his hand he was grieved by what he
[44:54] saw it is always this Oh my mind my
[44:58] message my preaching has produced then
[45:02] all of a sudden he heard a little tune
[45:05] onward Christian soldier marching
[45:09] has the one wall he saw that little

[47:24] order for that child to make it out

[47:58] millionaire or any kind of other heir
[48:01] you know what your vision supposed to be
[48:04] your vision is to be just like Jesus
[48:07] whoo somebody help me in pulse it I'm
[48:10] fighting everyday
[48:12] I'm designed everyday I'm pressing
[48:15] toward the mark my mark is to be in the
[48:18] very Express image of Jesus Christ is
[48:21] that right father
[48:23] I wouldn't they be one even as we are
[48:25] one Lord I am in you you are in me and I
[48:28] into him hallelujah the whole Godhead in
[48:32] the body of Jesus Christ God coming down
[48:36] like I said last night it's not like
[48:39] he's throwing something up something
[48:40] outside of himself no sir
[48:43] God comes along and he puts himself into
[48:46] you hello somebody you understand me
[48:51] and therefore when God is in you God
[48:53] does the same thing he did yesterday and
[48:56] he will do forevermore is that right see
[48:59] the word for your age must be expressed
[49:02] that's what made brother Branham who he
[49:05] was
[49:06] everybody claimed to have been Elijah
[49:09] but everybody couldn't produce the life
[49:12] of Elijah there was only one
[49:15] hallelujah and he says listen he said if
[49:18] you don't believe me for what I profess
[49:20] to be what about the works hallelujah
[49:24] and you can see that even as Jesus
[49:26] Christ Jesus Christ was the expressed
[49:28] image of God he was God in manifested in
[49:33] the flesh he was the fullness of Godhead
[49:35] Pilate he was the only one that didn't
[49:38] have a measure of faith hallelujah but
[49:41] every man has had a measure of faith
[49:45] right and so you got to understand by
[49:48] God's grace if God puts a teaspoon of
[49:51] himself and you you just as a potent as
[49:54] the ocean every ingredients in that
[49:57] teaspoon is in you that's in the ocean
[50:00] hallelujah that's why he said these
[50:02] signs shall follow them that believe how
[50:05] could you be the bride and you have no
[50:06] signs following how can you be the bride
[50:12] and you declare there's no space and
[50:15] room for gifts of God when Rebecca got
[50:20] to Isaac she had all the gifts
[50:23] hallelujah
[50:24] she may not have been using them but at
[50:27] the same time she was able to display
[50:31] what she had you understand me
[50:34] you and I must understand by God's grace
[50:36] amen when we talk about perfection we're
[50:39] talking about totally yielding and dying
[50:41] that is the law of this dimension you
[50:45] cannot live unless you die
[50:48] I heard the prophet of God say something
[50:51] today that I'd never heard before he
[50:53] said you know what even the clouds must
[50:56] die I said what yes the clouds even die
[51:01] and they cry about it
[51:04] hallelujah we call it rain but in order
[51:08] for that those those clouds must die it
[51:11] must be changing to rain then when rain
[51:14] comes down amen it resurrects again
[51:18] and start all over the process yeah
[51:21] everything must die in order to live got
[51:26] a plate we must die right in here the
[51:30] Holy Spirit is identifying within us
[51:33] every little thing that we ought we
[51:35] ought to get rid of and you and I must
[51:38] continue to pray and ask for his mercy
[51:40] His grace hallelujah is given to us is
[51:43] how us is part of our inheritance but if
[51:47] you don't use it that's like a pardon a
[51:51] pardon is not a pardon accepted being
[51:53] received as a pardon if you don't use it
[51:55] you don't have it God has given us mercy
[51:58] and grace for us to use it hallelujah
[52:02] glory to God it's not just sitting up on
[52:05] the Shelf to sit with that's mercy and
[52:07] that's grace no it's given to us God
[52:10] knows this this this evil age he knows
[52:13] what it's gonna take to overcome it
[52:15] blessing it's a man that overcometh
[52:18] hallelujah y'all hear what I'm saying
[52:21] and you and I cannot overcome it without
[52:24] the mercy and grace of God hallelujah
[52:27] you saw what do you mean brother let me
[52:30] say like this because we all we up with
[52:34] people somehow we we like to get into
[52:36] this ritualistic type of worship yeah
[52:41] that's the kind that God hates what if I
[52:46] came to you and and every time I talk to
[52:48] you I'm telling you the same stuff you
[52:54] would say what you know you would get a
[52:56] little irritated right because all
[52:59] you're gonna that's all you can talk
[53:00] about we're not there's tons of things
[53:03] that you can be we could be talking
[53:05] about all you're doing is talking about
[53:06] the same stop over and over again and
[53:09] guess what all those things were already
[53:11] taking care of a long time ago and while
[53:13] you keep bringing it up yeah I
[53:17] understand what I'm saying and you know
[53:19] God don't like that repetition type of
[53:21] stuff he don't mind he wants you to pray
[53:24] everyday he wants you to fast whenever
[53:27] you can he wants you to be consecrated
[53:29] but God wants you to talk
[53:31] to him give us this day our daily bread
[53:34] Lord God wants you to really be able to
[53:37] talk to him you know what I'm saying how
[53:40] many times you go to God in prayer and
[53:43] all you do is go to praise Him what we
[53:49] always asking for stuff he knows what
[53:53] you need sometimes we need to just go in
[53:55] says lord I just thank you you're so
[53:58] good I'm telling you I've been there you
[54:01] tell him I getting up off the float
[54:03] drunk you get up drunk cuz he give you a
[54:05] lot of wine when you start doing that
[54:07] you please God amen when you just go to
[54:10] God in prayer just to thank him it's the
[54:13] truth Jesus Christ was not just a mere
[54:19] man he was God expression he was not
[54:22] only man but he was God and that was
[54:26] expressed through this veil we called
[54:30] Jesus and you got you and I must
[54:33] understand amen it was the reflection of
[54:36] the word for that day a virgin shall
[54:38] conceive right we saw him in a manger we
[54:42] understand those things but as he began
[54:45] to grow and mature we seen more God
[54:48] hallelujah it was fantastic when he
[54:51] turned the water into wine it was
[54:54] amazing when he walked on on the Sun on
[54:57] the Sea of Galilee hallelujah but the
[55:00] most amazing thing that Jesus ever did
[55:04] in his day in time was that he died and
[55:07] he rose again hallelujah and when he
[55:12] rose again he preached they'll say
[55:14] didn't yes he did he preached and he
[55:18] told them hey men on the road to Emmaus
[55:21] I'm the man he went through jettisoned
[55:24] him brought him all the way up
[55:25] throughout the province and he preached
[55:27] he preached the same Jesus but he come
[55:31] back with a greater message the Lamb
[55:34] that was dead is now alive hallelujah
[55:37] don't you worry little flock it is a
[55:40] father's pleasure and good will to give
[55:42] you the kingdom
[55:44] see that's what we fail to see it ain't
[55:46] your will is his will to give it to you
[55:48] that's why you have a will to do it god
[55:53] for that eh
[55:55] to what make the age see God's promises
[55:58] for that age you understand me what good
[56:02] is you know I always tell people I said
[56:04] them if this is where God want us to be
[56:06] in this little place that's ok but I'd
[56:08] rather have something where I could
[56:10] where it can be seen because the Bible
[56:12] says you know your city that sits over
[56:14] here they cannot be here but back in
[56:16] here we see look like we hide from
[56:18] something and every almost every message
[56:20] I've ever ever met the church I've ever
[56:22] gone through they be somewhere that you
[56:24] came fighting them hallelujah it's
[56:29] important that we understand that in age
[56:32] it is that's true too but God amen love
[56:35] to have a place where people can see it
[56:38] it's on both sides folks it's natural
[56:41] and spiritual hallelujah so you must
[56:47] understand by God's grace amen when God
[56:49] is doing something we must understand
[56:53] amen it is a written word right you said
[56:58] what what do you mean brother when even
[57:00] when Jesus Christ was born he born he
[57:02] was born at a busy time that he actually
[57:06] attracted people hello there was a light
[57:10] it attracted to people Amen that was in
[57:14] the city even though there were many
[57:17] that didn't see it but those that
[57:18] elected they saw here's a child angels
[57:23] even said Amen this child is born in
[57:26] Bethlehem ain't preaching on freedom
[57:28] Christian but my point is is that when
[57:32] God shines a light he wants it to be
[57:35] seen hallelujah a spirit of God and when
[57:43] I when I come to this place I want you
[57:45] to understand the Spirit of God when is
[57:47] it written like brother I'm said he said
[57:49] it's the Spirit of God upon the written
[57:51] word trying to find somebody to reflect
[57:54] itself to this a
[57:57] to prove that he's the same yesterday
[58:00] today and forever
[58:04] hallelujah somebody is he's looking he's
[58:07] looking he's looking he's looking and
[58:08] limitary something it will not be that
[58:10] many people in this age that's why it
[58:15] just makes me nervous when everybody and
[58:17] I don't like this collective thing I
[58:19] don't like the collectiveness about what
[58:22] we call the message hallelujah because
[58:25] when we call it the message what are you
[58:27] saying because we have 1/2 hours our
[58:30] song service is it because Amen we we
[58:36] quote the Prophet well what makes it a
[58:39] message church what makes it as a
[58:42] message church is when the message is in
[58:45] the church when God is in the
[58:47] individuals that's what makes it
[58:52] hallelujah you see what I'm saying it is
[58:55] the same thing you sure well what makes
[58:57] McDonald McDonald the golden arches
[59:05] hallelujah
[59:06] there's some symbol up there saying this
[59:08] is McDonald if that's the way the church
[59:11] has become we must have certain pictures
[59:15] up and everything else to symbolize we
[59:18] are the message that is not the
[59:21] reflection in with God is looking for
[59:23] he's looking for a life that reflects
[59:26] him is wrong with those things but what
[59:29] good is to have all those things if
[59:31] there's no life there that's all I'm
[59:36] saying
[59:36] I get in trouble for saying stuff like
[59:39] that cuz people misunderstand me
[59:41] but I really don't care I know who I am
[59:44] when you come to know who you are you
[59:46] don't care you understand me Amen you
[59:50] become that very mouthpiece of God you
[59:53] become the very very very expression of
[59:55] God and then regardless of what people
[59:57] say what people think you know what God
[1:00:00] wants to be done with the word
[1:00:03] hallelujah God wants that word to be
[1:00:06] lived not just preach
[1:00:11] way that you can preach this to live it
[1:00:13] that is the message that God wants
[1:00:16] hallelujah come on somebody it's true
[1:00:20] they could even tell who Jesus was until
[1:00:23] Judas kissed him
[1:00:29] hallelujah
[1:00:30] so you got to understand it goes beyond
[1:00:33] there are people who are blind and I'll
[1:00:36] never see but there are those that we
[1:00:39] must live this life for so that they can
[1:00:42] see hallelujah listen the prophet of God
[1:00:46] goes and say the real born-again people
[1:00:49] of this age that filled with the Holy
[1:00:51] Ghost is the tide post of the scripture
[1:00:55] that got to be fulfilled in these last
[1:00:57] days is the typos hallelujah we are the
[1:01:02] manifestation but that which had been
[1:01:05] preached by Malachi for in Revelation 10
[1:01:07] 7 how can you prophesy again except that
[1:01:11] life of prophecy is in you and
[1:01:13] understand the prophet of God tells us
[1:01:16] they meant the real Son of Man is to
[1:01:19] Holy Spirit himself he is the true
[1:01:22] prophet he is the true messenger and how
[1:01:26] can you run and tell that if the
[1:01:28] messenger is not in you I'm gonna talk
[1:01:32] about a man I'm talking about the Holy
[1:01:34] Spirit
[1:01:35] I got quotes for those things but my
[1:01:38] point is how come we beat you know
[1:01:40] everybody and it just scares me because
[1:01:42] I know what I'm looking at I know what
[1:01:44] I'm pressing into I know what I'm
[1:01:46] fighting for every day and I think to
[1:01:49] myself you know what's wrong with the
[1:01:51] people why would you accept religion
[1:01:54] right now when you know the coming of
[1:01:56] the Lord is at hand you know he said yes
[1:01:59] you be hot or cold come show me with a
[1:02:03] hot show me where the fire is show me
[1:02:06] where the man of the woman is on fire
[1:02:07] for that show me look at this place they
[1:02:12] just hears everywhere people don't want
[1:02:15] to come to church you know why because
[1:02:17] they've been distracted the fire is
[1:02:20] going down some of them are cold some
[1:02:24] don't have the love of God anymore
[1:02:26] because the Bible said in that last day
[1:02:28] that love of many shall wax cold it's
[1:02:31] true what about you don't let the devil
[1:02:34] put your fire out put another log or
[1:02:37] something on and keep the fire burning
[1:02:40] let them call you phonetic whatever they
[1:02:43] want to call you but don't let the fire
[1:02:45] go out
[1:02:48] that's right we must fulfill this we are
[1:02:52] the top posts is that right we are the
[1:02:55] ultimen it's God's ultimate is that
[1:02:59] right yonder tell me there's nothing
[1:03:01] that comes higher than this group you
[1:03:05] understand me this message is the
[1:03:07] ultimate Christian I don't know how it
[1:03:12] is the ultimate is God's masterpiece
[1:03:16] that's why Amen he's chipping away in
[1:03:19] our lives he's trying to get rid of
[1:03:21] everything that's not like you like him
[1:03:24] he's got to do it that way though it may
[1:03:27] be painful its needful everybody want to
[1:03:36] smooth sailing ah but you chose the
[1:03:40] heart away and just like Peter say Lord
[1:03:47] where else can we go where is this
[1:03:51] message is there anything greater where
[1:03:54] else can we go so you got to understand
[1:03:58] this is what we're winning with a
[1:04:00] dilemma you got to make a choice you
[1:04:03] going to either go forward or you're
[1:04:05] gonna stand still and stand stealing
[1:04:06] beans instead standing still means to
[1:04:09] backslide a lot of times people think
[1:04:11] standing still needs to back up know
[1:04:14] when the car backs not he folds buckles
[1:04:16] his knees and he won't go nowhere
[1:04:19] that's where backsliding is when you
[1:04:22] won't you refuse to progress you've
[1:04:25] refused to go Father
[1:04:27] you understand me oh listen the prophet
[1:04:31] of God which is so true he said this
[1:04:33] real genuine Holy Ghost
[1:04:34] it'll make you do things that the
[1:04:37] ordinary man
[1:04:38] wouldn't do it's a truth
[1:04:42] it'll make you do things that the
[1:04:44] ordinary man wouldn't do hallelujah
[1:04:48] it'll make you a man go places that
[1:04:50] right
[1:04:51] it'll make every man and woman do things
[1:04:53] that they wouldn't ordinarily do
[1:04:56] hallelujah
[1:04:58] why because you got the Holy Ghost in
[1:05:02] you to be your stabilizer Oh Lord it's
[1:05:07] your ink of your soul it is the thing
[1:05:10] that keeps you moving when nobody else
[1:05:12] will go on you got to go home y'all
[1:05:14] understand me hallelujah hallelujah Oh
[1:05:17] as I said the born-again Christian is
[1:05:20] tied to Christ and the Bible and this is
[1:05:22] what I don't understand how people just
[1:05:24] say I'm a Christian and will read their
[1:05:25] Bibles hallelujah I thank God for the
[1:05:27] anointing but I thank God for the word
[1:05:29] that I could read hallelujah is in this
[1:05:33] book I find faith faith comes by hearing
[1:05:35] and hearing by the Word of God
[1:05:37] hallelujah y'all understand what I'm
[1:05:40] saying it's what I feed on it's what
[1:05:43] makes me who I am
[1:05:45] oh my as I said what is a revelation but
[1:05:55] the thought of God dropped into your
[1:05:57] heart I don't know what it means to be
[1:06:00] born from birth but that man who was
[1:06:02] born from birth somehow amen faith
[1:06:05] dropped in his heart I you think he
[1:06:08] could have mustered it up there was no
[1:06:10] schooling that he could have gone to
[1:06:11] mama couldn't explain it to him he
[1:06:14] didn't even know what sight was he never
[1:06:16] had eyesight before her but whatever it
[1:06:19] is I want it Lord and you says his mind
[1:06:22] is mine that's what I'm saying I don't
[1:06:25] know what perfection is I don't know
[1:06:28] what it's gonna be like that over there
[1:06:30] but I believe it and it's mine and the
[1:06:33] faith that God has dropped in my heart
[1:06:36] is taking me there taking you there a
[1:06:40] place we've never been before
[1:06:42] hallelujah but I know it's real it's
[1:06:45] more real to me than this book I'm
[1:06:47] hoping in my head hallelujah I don't
[1:06:50] know how to explain
[1:06:51] but that's like like like our brother
[1:06:53] said there's something that keeps
[1:06:54] holding me something keeps pulling me
[1:06:57] hallelujah something and I can't explain
[1:07:01] it but I do know it's God hallelujah see
[1:07:06] because God when he produces that word
[1:07:08] by thought in you you sometimes say
[1:07:10] where did that thought come from you
[1:07:13] ever seen yourself reading the word and
[1:07:15] then all of a sudden a thought hits you
[1:07:17] and it just doesn't stay in one place it
[1:07:20] kind of spreads out you began to see a
[1:07:24] whole picture of things by one thought
[1:07:26] that's God hallelujah yes and you don't
[1:07:32] even know think about the woman with the
[1:07:34] issue of blood how does she get to you
[1:07:37] see God by his own infinite wisdom and
[1:07:40] knowledge he knew that lady before she
[1:07:42] became what she was yes Wow he produced
[1:07:47] the scene y'all know what I'm saying
[1:07:50] he allowed sickness to strike her he
[1:07:54] prepared the grounds he knew that one
[1:07:58] day Jesus was going to come by that same
[1:08:01] place he saw that woman even when she
[1:08:05] crawled him you understand me she was
[1:08:08] weak and she touched the hem of His
[1:08:10] garment you can't touch the hem of God's
[1:08:13] garment like this you got a humble
[1:08:14] yourself hallelujah and she touched the
[1:08:18] hem of His garment in there and
[1:08:20] something inspired her to do it there
[1:08:23] was nothing in the law there was no word
[1:08:25] nobody told her that no neighbor first
[1:08:29] time ever happening but the revelation
[1:08:32] struck her if I could just but touch the
[1:08:35] hem of His garment I would be made whole
[1:08:37] is that right the problem God said even
[1:08:40] Jesus didn't know what he said who
[1:08:42] touched me because she would be on him
[1:08:47] and touched God somebody help me here
[1:08:51] see that's why I say times God dropped
[1:08:54] things in your mind you don't process it
[1:08:56] you don't say well that doesn't sound
[1:08:58] reasonable more than likely that it's
[1:09:00] not reasonable is God hallelujah
[1:09:05] God doesn't make sense to the natural
[1:09:07] man
[1:09:09] how can a boat made out of shittim would
[1:09:13] go forward scuse me
[1:09:14] how can he be float on the earth float
[1:09:17] in a time of trouble like that to the
[1:09:23] scientific mind it makes no sense how
[1:09:26] can you and I one day will walk through
[1:09:28] the wall it is what it is
[1:09:34] I'm looking forward to the day
[1:09:37] hallelujah you don't have to worry about
[1:09:40] air pollution over there cuz no
[1:09:41] automobiles will be there we're travel
[1:09:44] like a thought
[1:09:45] I believe that hallelujah
[1:09:48] right God need a dedicated channel y'all
[1:09:52] know what a dedicated channel is is that
[1:09:55] person that's gonna keep the channel
[1:09:56] open that channel is only for God hmm
[1:10:01] amen you see that's what brother and he
[1:10:04] described the prophets he said they were
[1:10:06] dedicated channels and I thought to
[1:10:09] myself but I can be a dedicated channel
[1:10:12] you can be a dedicated channel amen
[1:10:16] hallelujah but what about those saints
[1:10:19] that knew that Jesus was coming they
[1:10:21] were dedicated channels they waited
[1:10:24] there amen in that temple day and night
[1:10:27] looking for Jesus how did they know he
[1:10:30] was there somebody had been talking to
[1:10:33] God and God had given them some secrets
[1:10:35] that nobody else knew oh oh praise God
[1:10:41] and when that child came through that
[1:10:42] man who couldn't see with the natural I
[1:10:44] saw him approaching maybe it was just
[1:10:47] his cry I've heard that cry before
[1:10:51] whatever it was he walked over to marry
[1:10:54] him again the prophesy you understand me
[1:10:58] what was it dedicated then afterwards
[1:11:01] you know like I forgot who who who gave
[1:11:04] that testimony said you know that that
[1:11:06] brother Simeon testified all the time
[1:11:08] the Lord then showed me he's coming to
[1:11:11] the temple and I'll be there and no
[1:11:15] doubt they had done heard that testimony
[1:11:16] time and time again but one day
[1:11:19] the testimony became real the reality of
[1:11:23] his vision or dream became real you
[1:11:25] understand me
[1:11:26] so that's what I'm saying as long as you
[1:11:29] testify of who you are I am bride you
[1:11:33] understand me I don't have to figure it
[1:11:35] out he told me I am he gave me that
[1:11:38] revelation oh you said what Brotherhood
[1:11:43] if you've got the revelation why aren't
[1:11:45] you where you should be
[1:11:46] who's to say I'm not I'm called to be
[1:11:50] bride he didn't call me to be a prophet
[1:11:53] you see what I'm saying
[1:11:57] because everybody feel like when you
[1:11:59] bride you supposedly raised in the day
[1:12:01] know is in the body but it's only
[1:12:05] elected those who have been chosen to
[1:12:08] pray for those to raise the dead
[1:12:10] everybody wasn't called to be healers
[1:12:12] and deliveries but you find your place
[1:12:16] in Christ and you maintain your position
[1:12:19] and God will make it happen
[1:12:21] he'll make things happen supernatural
[1:12:26] follows every believer one way or
[1:12:29] another hallelujah Minister true
[1:12:33] everybody people think well we'll have
[1:12:36] the spoken word yes we've got it
[1:12:38] but everybody won't be able to speak not
[1:12:42] ain't gonna use everybody even if it's a
[1:12:47] hundred people God ain't not going to
[1:12:49] give everybody that ability or that
[1:12:52] people it may have them happy they may
[1:12:54] have it but God will not call for
[1:12:56] everybody to be speaking it's given to
[1:12:59] those who he had ordained to do it come
[1:13:03] on somebody it is the truth
[1:13:06] all those disciples every one of them 12
[1:13:09] of them and every one of them had
[1:13:12] different gifts and different abilities
[1:13:15] it was only a few you constantly heard
[1:13:17] of some of them moved into the crowd and
[1:13:20] you never heard about him ever again but
[1:13:23] I guarantee on the other side you hear
[1:13:26] the stories of victory
[1:13:30] I don't care if nobody ever see what's
[1:13:33] going on in my life as long as he does
[1:13:36] you understand me to see me get victory
[1:13:40] amen
[1:13:42] what's the man called die aqua fees
[1:13:45] that's whatever you never heard much of
[1:13:47] him he only spoke God spoke of him one
[1:13:49] time and how that he had the faith of
[1:13:51] God a man when his name wasn't written
[1:13:55] nowhere else I think in the church age
[1:13:57] book is brought out God knows your name
[1:14:02] hallelujah and he knows the faith in
[1:14:05] which you hold praise the name of the
[1:14:07] Lord he needs a dedicated channel he
[1:14:10] needs somebody to say oh god this body

[1:14:16] tongue is yours my mind is yours
[1:14:18] everything about me is your god dedicate
[1:14:22] this temple hallelujah to your glory
[1:14:25] that's what he wants dedicate this
[1:14:28] temple it's amazing when you can come to
[1:14:36] a place where you're so caught up in God
[1:14:38] you just speak what he wants you to
[1:14:40] speak and you say what do you want you
[1:14:42] to say regardless to the opposition that
[1:14:44] it may cause or the stir or whether
[1:14:46] people I was at that funeral I said if
[1:14:48] you want to shoot me that's okay I'm not
[1:14:51] skirt and that's the truth cuz I don't
[1:14:55] love life like that you understand me
[1:14:58] and no doubt some of them people
[1:15:00] probably wanted to stone me but the law
[1:15:03] hold nobody wants to go to jail it was
[1:15:09] okay because you know what I was working
[1:15:11] with the song you know what I told them

[1:15:14] understand I love all of you and the
[1:15:18] Lord flooded the place if hallelujah Wow
[1:15:22] because everybody wants to know if you
[1:15:24] listen a child don't even mind being
[1:15:26] rebuked when they know you love their
[1:15:29] you know and I came to those people in a
[1:15:32] spirit of love I said I'm telling you
[1:15:34] something that your preachers ain't
[1:15:36] gonna tell you but you only get one
[1:15:38] chance at this right all those preachers
[1:15:43] were man it meets
[1:15:44] somebody yelled something at me after
[1:15:47] the funeral I'm walking down now and
[1:15:49] somebody killed so I wouldn't even look
[1:15:52] all that says Lord forgive them yeah
[1:15:57] because it ain't me it wasn't me you
[1:15:59] know they were mad at the word that was
[1:16:01] preached that wasn't me that was God you
[1:16:05] know I want one thing for certain I try
[1:16:08] and I ask God to help me because I'm
[1:16:10] gonna tell you something in my earlier
[1:16:12] Christian walk I didn't witness to
[1:16:14] people like I should have some of those
[1:16:16] people died without knowing the truth
[1:16:19] that's something really bad to hold in
[1:16:22] your conscience and knowing that you you
[1:16:24] tried to tell them what you feared if
[1:16:27] you told them everything they wouldn't
[1:16:29] like your reject you whatever the
[1:16:30] circumstances were but when they die you
[1:16:33] realize it was worth it you should have
[1:16:35] said what you needed to say you
[1:16:38] understand me
[1:16:39] maybe some of y'all having witnessed
[1:16:40] that but I have and that's a horrible
[1:16:44] feeling when somebody died on you and
[1:16:46] you fail to tell them the truth
[1:16:48] I even tell my children I said even if
[1:16:51] you're not gonna live it you ought to
[1:16:52] tell them the truth tell them where they
[1:16:56] can be saved you understand me let's go
[1:16:59] on see God has a man stationed in the
[1:17:03] tabernacle I like the Hat you know when
[1:17:06] in the message Amen toddler seat
[1:17:08] suddenly the secret catching away you
[1:17:11] know the prophet of God talked about the
[1:17:12] girl Amen who who who was chosen by the
[1:17:15] ranch's son but what the girl wasn't
[1:17:19] aware of is that God has stationed a man
[1:17:21] in that place to watch her that's what
[1:17:25] people don't understand
[1:17:26] you have angels watching you there's
[1:17:29] someone station to watch every move you
[1:17:31] make and they are reporting back to God
[1:17:36] what you're doing whether you're
[1:17:38] becoming more like him or less like him
[1:17:40] he's getting the reports you understand
[1:17:44] me amen and guess what when God had a uh
[1:17:50] uh and I like this for this that this
[1:17:53] thing he said now you you've been a
[1:17:56] slave
[1:17:57] a long time and sometimes it makes us
[1:18:00] feel like that right but you were those
[1:18:02] true genuine believers we do we become
[1:18:06] slaves for Jesus Christ hmm
[1:18:11] Paul described he says I am a prisoner
[1:18:14] that means I have no rights I can't do
[1:18:18] what I want to do I can't go where I
[1:18:20] want to go I can't say what I want to
[1:18:22] say I'm a prisoner I'm a slave a love
[1:18:26] slave to Jesus he said you've been a
[1:18:29] slave a long time and I've watched you
[1:18:31] I've had the man standing there to see
[1:18:34] what kind of a girl you was going to
[1:18:36] turn out to be but I see that you kept
[1:18:39] yourself he said at the spare the moment
[1:18:43] see that's how the rapture come when a
[1:18:45] time you least expect it at the spur of
[1:18:48] the moment he shows up that's how he is
[1:18:53] at the spare the moment God shows up
[1:18:58] hallelujah how many y'all have ever had
[1:19:01] God throw a roadblock in your way in
[1:19:08] your mind you allow Satan to put evil in
[1:19:11] your mind and you have every intention
[1:19:13] to do it and God throw a roadblock in
[1:19:16] your way and you walk away and you say
[1:19:19] thank you Jesus hallelujah if you never
[1:19:22] been there before
[1:19:23] ah hallelujah and when I see God do it
[1:19:29] just make you wanna cry cause you didn't
[1:19:32] have the power to protect yourself but
[1:19:34] he protected you oh jesus help me Lord
[1:19:41] think about it that pillar fires in you
[1:19:44] this is what God will see that pillar of
[1:19:45] fire you know there is no way that you
[1:19:47] like I said become a stay on Christian
[1:19:49] with the Holy Ghost on the inside how
[1:19:50] can that be that's the same Shekinah
[1:19:53] glory that kept amen all those all that
[1:19:57] those years after I just for a long time
[1:19:59] how did that bread last forever like
[1:20:01] that hundreds of years Israel work with
[1:20:03] that bread that Brent was always French
[1:20:06] Bob because it was a certain kind of
[1:20:08] glory that kept it fresh it was God
[1:20:10] kept it fresh and as long as you stay in
[1:20:12] the presence of God you'll remain a
[1:20:14] fresh Christian not some stale and
[1:20:19] molded bread hallelujah huh
[1:20:21] you always have life to give hallelujah
[1:20:25] Tama the image of the invisible God
[1:20:27] that's where God wants us God wants us
[1:20:30] to be the his housing he wants us to be
[1:20:33] the image the image of his himself you
[1:20:38] can't see him but then Jesus said you
[1:20:41] know to Philip how can you say when you
[1:20:42] when you show us the father said when
[1:20:45] you see me you see the father that's the
[1:20:47] kind of Union God wants is that right
[1:20:49] that's the kind Keyes's pray father I
[1:20:52] want that kind of Union that you had
[1:20:54] with me to be in them that one day
[1:20:57] they'll be able to see when you say when
[1:20:59] you see me you see Jesus they have died
[1:21:04] and rotted so much to themself all they
[1:21:06] got left is Jesus that sounds hard it
[1:21:11] sounds like it difficult but there is
[1:21:13] there anything too hard for God you
[1:21:15] don't know how to surrender ask God
[1:21:18] teach me how to surrender Lord give me
[1:21:21] grace like I said this morning every sin
[1:21:23] that we do is based upon selfishness I'm
[1:21:28] not talking about the kind that comes
[1:21:29] suddenly and it's called you to do
[1:21:31] something but most of it most of the
[1:21:33] things we do is already thought about we
[1:21:37] call that iniquity and he died even for
[1:21:41] that Christ in you the hope of glory is
[1:21:46] that right we must and I'm closing we
[1:21:50] must allow God to rent every veil tear
[1:21:53] every veil of the flesh veil lust veil
[1:21:56] every veil that seemed to hold us in
[1:21:58] prison we must rip it apart that Christ
[1:22:02] may be seen to us Lord read every their
[1:22:05] rent you see what I'm saying great
[1:22:07] mysteries are great and I'm not against
[1:22:09] that but what good Paul said you can
[1:22:11] understand all mysteries and have not
[1:22:13] charity it profits you nothing until we
[1:22:17] come to a place where we can love our
[1:22:19] brothers and sisters that we love
[1:22:20] ourselves and not only that love the
[1:22:23] angle
[1:22:23] Doce men who you you know you find
[1:22:26] difficult to love you've got to love him
[1:22:28] that's why God put them into your life
[1:22:30] it's your test not theirs we must love
[1:22:34] people that don't mix us make us
[1:22:37] compromise us when we never had God has
[1:22:40] never asked us to love the sin that they
[1:22:42] do but we must love them you love the
[1:22:47] Lord I'm almost done I'm kind of rushing
[1:22:51] but let me hurry by God's grace listen
[1:22:56] he died to reveal himself to us and we
[1:23:01] must die to reveal him to others you
[1:23:06] understand me
[1:23:08] we wanted to be where people said well I
[1:23:10] know that brother's a Christian I know
[1:23:12] that sister is a Christian I've seen
[1:23:14] their lives I know I know I've seen him
[1:23:17] tired I know I seen them tested y'all
[1:23:19] understand me it's like that woman whose
[1:23:21] husband was a drunk of the sheath he
[1:23:23] invited all his friends over says I know
[1:23:25] we're real Christian here let me go fix
[1:23:28] me something to eat she goes and they
[1:23:29] fix him something to eat then when she
[1:23:32] gets it on the turkey I don't want none
[1:23:34] of this mess
[1:23:36] she's definitely wedding an American
[1:23:38] woman she was an American woman
[1:23:48] hallelujah I was somewhere and it's true
[1:23:54] I don't know the whole lyrics of this
[1:23:56] thing with it was a rock and roll thing
[1:23:57] on the on the station and in that saga
[1:23:59] says don't what don't you marry on
[1:24:01] American walk I said even the world no
[1:24:05] not America oh I don't know what the
[1:24:08] whole theory says are you serious but
[1:24:12] anyhow by God's grace we've realized by
[1:24:15] now if she'd been born in America and
[1:24:18] she's a Christian she's no longer
[1:24:19] American woman you understand me
[1:24:22] and I'm telling American woman one that
[1:24:25] not been born again you understand me
[1:24:27] so anyway we must live we must die to
[1:24:31] reveal him to others is that right
[1:24:33] brother and say let us die to the
[1:24:35] traditions and thing
[1:24:36] to reveal him to others she is more than
[1:24:40] just your words everybody could carry
[1:24:42] this Bible I know some of the most meet
[1:24:44] some some mean folks if they still live
[1:24:46] in Apostolic people maybe I shouldn't I
[1:24:51] said the name but it's true you don't
[1:24:53] know what you dealing with until you
[1:24:54] cross the line with them as long as you
[1:24:57] say Amen yes that's true
[1:24:59] hallelujah but it's like rubbing a
[1:25:02] kitten on backwards you want to see the
[1:25:04] lion come out of it you want to see yes
[1:25:09] you don't agree with their level ma you
[1:25:12] don't believe in the next 238 you going
[1:25:14] to hell and what Scripture what word
[1:25:18] ever told you that we are born into his
[1:25:23] body by one spirit and brother Branham
[1:25:26] says every one of us are cuckoo yeah he
[1:25:29] said if God gave those Trinitarians the
[1:25:31] Holy Ghost and gave you one that's the
[1:25:33] Holy Ghost how can you not fellowship
[1:25:35] with one another when God has chosen to
[1:25:38] fellowship with you that's almost a
[1:25:41] quote verbatim but you know what the
[1:25:43] thing is we figured that the only way
[1:25:44] you can get it is this way would then
[1:25:47] wind it brother branham get his Holy
[1:25:48] Ghost and what church he belong to he
[1:25:53] said I didn't join up with none of
[1:25:55] hallelujah he said I was in the Baptist
[1:25:58] Church right Missionary Baptist and when
[1:26:00] they went when when they do our day in
[1:26:02] women preachers I got up out of there
[1:26:05] right and he said it's amazing I said I
[1:26:09] stood in the midst of all of them trying
[1:26:11] to pull them all together
[1:26:14] that's what divine love will do you're
[1:26:18] different but because you're different
[1:26:21] that don't mean you have a right not to
[1:26:23] love that which one that one that is
[1:26:24] different from you hello be not
[1:26:29] conformed to this world but be
[1:26:30] transformed by the renewing of what your
[1:26:32] mind that you may prove what is good and
[1:26:35] acceptable and perfect will of God and I
[1:26:39] believe if a man or woman got the true
[1:26:41] Holy Ghost he will lead them and guide
[1:26:44] them into truth in this day is what God
[1:26:48] requires the men
[1:26:50] this hour is the message of the age and
[1:26:53] God will lead them to this age by
[1:26:56] someone something vision whatever but
[1:27:00] they will come to this if God has
[1:27:02] ordained them to make a rapture you love
[1:27:05] the Lord let's just stop here just
[1:27:09] trying to get us to see that let me say
[1:27:12] it like this and this is what I meant to
[1:27:14] say and all that I've said the word must
[1:27:20] become a voice that walks in the cool of
[1:27:29] the evening the voice of God walks the
[1:27:34] voice of God must return to the
[1:27:38] tabernacle in which it was designed to
[1:27:41] dwell in and when that voice of God that
[1:27:46] life that's off of the tapes that Holy
[1:27:49] Ghost that pillar of fire that Elohim
[1:27:52] however you want to call him whatever
[1:27:53] you want to call him the self existing
[1:27:55] what when he comes he comes into the
[1:27:58] holy place within your heart and that
[1:28:02] voice began to walk and go places and
[1:28:05] you say what are you talk about how did
[1:28:09] you know I was a parson she said I saw
[1:28:13] you coming but weren't you supposed to
[1:28:18] have a briefcase with you say yeah
[1:28:21] station brother branham uh have you ever
[1:28:26] heard of William Branham no I haven't
[1:28:28] but she prayed Lord I'm like that
[1:28:32] Shunammite woman where's that Elisha a
[1:28:36] deep call rung the Bell in heaven heaven
[1:28:40] rung the Bell on earth and began to walk
[1:28:44] hallelujah he understood me that woman's
[1:28:48] prayer held a plane up now I know that's
[1:28:52] true cuz there been times the plane
[1:28:55] should have been gone and I've even had
[1:28:57] them say where we've been waiting on you
[1:29:02] I'm running through the
[1:29:03] terminal Lord hold a plane over the
[1:29:05] plane how many times do they hold planes
[1:29:10] but that day they held it for me huh
[1:29:14] because that was the will of the Lord to
[1:29:17] show me that you're able to hold the
[1:29:19] plane up that same God and still here
[1:29:22] but until you realize the power and
[1:29:24] authority that's in you
[1:29:26] that's why brother ever said like this
[1:29:27] he said that word after which the Holy
[1:29:30] Ghost has come upon you you shall
[1:29:31] receive power he's that that word is a
[1:29:33] thority authority ain't no good for you
[1:29:37] if you don't use it but we're so timid
[1:29:41] with the sword we so timid with the word
[1:29:43] but when you realize who you are you
[1:29:46] know you're the boss of the world you're
[1:29:48] the boss the god and you is the boss you
[1:29:51] must work it as you the boss
[1:29:54] you understand me you don't handle
[1:29:56] things timidly you can say please if you
[1:29:59] want to you know can you move that chair
[1:30:02] for me please but you don't have to say
[1:30:04] please that's your choosing of doing
[1:30:07] that if John is working for you you say
[1:30:10] John give me that chair please or John
[1:30:12] bring me that player chair you don't
[1:30:14] have to say please you understand me you
[1:30:19] are the authority of John and John is
[1:30:22] going to do what you say do it he's
[1:30:23] gonna get fired
[1:30:25] so we God is placed in a position right
[1:30:29] let me ask you a question at what point
[1:30:32] in time Jesus prayed Lord should I curse
[1:30:36] this tree at what point in time did
[1:30:42] Elijah huh it was an inspiration now
[1:30:45] that did come to him because it when
[1:30:47] Elijah called for fire from heaven that
[1:30:50] was an inspiration and you and I must be
[1:30:54] so tuned and channeled into God so when
[1:30:56] God want to use us even in the least of
[1:30:58] things we ought to be available for him
[1:31:00] let's stand I'm trying to get us to a
[1:31:04] place where we understand that we're not
[1:31:06] where we should be and the time is late
[1:31:09] yeah and as long as we watch everybody
[1:31:13] else we'll get nowhere that's one thing
[1:31:16] about a runner he
[1:31:17] looking at what's happening on either
[1:31:19] side of him he's looking at the gold and
[1:31:22] he's moving they tell you whatever you
[1:31:25] do don't look behind you now there's
[1:31:27] nothing wrong with listening sometimes
[1:31:29] you can hear the opponent if you've got
[1:31:31] good ears that he's coming up on you
[1:31:33] that means pick up the space pick up the
[1:31:35] pace but the moment you do this you just
[1:31:38] thrown you where you've thrown your
[1:31:39] rhythm off and your timing and just in
[1:31:45] that little bit of time that God is
[1:31:47] right behind you can jump in front of
[1:31:49] you don't look to the left or the right
[1:31:53] keep your eyes on Jesus
[1:31:56] keep running Saints when the vision that
[1:31:59] made clear to you let him that read it
[1:32:01] run not walk run because understand this
[1:32:06] vision is going to only last for the
[1:32:09] appointed time that means it's coming to
[1:32:12] an end and you and I must understand we
[1:32:15] must be caught up into the vision in
[1:32:17] order for the vision to be caught up in
[1:32:19] us yummy the vision must be caught up in
[1:32:22] us in order for us to be caught up into
[1:32:23] the vision that's what I meant so that
[1:32:25] you can understand by God's grace it's
[1:32:27] nothing but a few of us everywhere
[1:32:30] around the world it's just a few but
[1:32:34] look you're still standing you're still
[1:32:39] standing and in spite of all that you

[1:37:49] battle folks our greatest enemy is
[1:37:53] ourselves you know we can blame it on
[1:37:58] the devil but it's our own ways we have
[1:38:00] to fight our own desires that's what
[1:38:04] makes it so difficult because it's our
[1:38:08] own desires we have to fight against but
[1:38:12] God has already given us all we need see
[1:38:17] that seed in you once it's quickened it

[1:39:15] wide open
[1:39:17] things are getting ready to fly loose
