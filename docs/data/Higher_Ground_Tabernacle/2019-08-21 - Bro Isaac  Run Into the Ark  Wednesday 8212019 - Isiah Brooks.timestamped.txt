[14:29] to sing it because that's the way I feel
[14:31] it that's the way I see it changes
[14:34] changes changes changes you can't be a
[14:37] Christian without changes we'll keep
[14:40] changing until we get into perfection
[14:42] limit you love the Lord we want to
[14:46] welcome everybody tonight we appreciate
[14:49] your coming don't mind you know the the
[14:53] many seats they're occupied even Bobby
[15:00] says the Angels our Lord in camp about
[15:02] us we have a host of angels they look
[15:06] into our services they don't understand
[15:08] salvation so they look and see the
[15:11] response of Christ and him crucified and
[15:16] we realize by God's grace there's only
[15:18] one way to be saved and that is in the
[15:22] name of Jesus Christ we have our brother
[15:25] Isaac he's a young brother he'll be
[15:28] ministering tonight this is his third
[15:30] time ministry I believe in gifts
[15:35] I believe in opening the door for those
[15:38] who say they're called by God the Bible
[15:41] said make your calling and election sure
[15:44] that's the only way that you can know
[15:46] you got to try it and see
[15:48] so I told my brother Isaac I said I told
[15:51] him a lot of things but I'd go back and
[15:53] say you know what get out there and
[15:55] enjoy yourself if you enjoy it you're on
[15:58] the right track
[16:00] sometimes I feel so good I just feel
[16:03] like preaching to myself God is good
[16:07] y'all have joy
[16:10] amen I have a great joy that God has
[16:13] given and I'm not gonna prolong the time
[16:16] because I know they're still in the
[16:19] middle of the week and some of us are
[16:21] tired and some of us may not be tired
[16:23] but those of us who still got to go to
[16:25] work now if God take us all the way
[16:28] through the night you won't be tired
[16:30] tomorrow because it's all God you love
[16:34] the Lord I believe the old-fashioned way
[16:36] folks I can remember the time we used to
[16:39] have church there was no time on it then
[16:43] after you got out of church you talked
[16:45] about the word all day all night and
[16:47] then you foul on yourself and you know
[16:49] we go out to the restaurants at night
[16:50] and then end up three o'clock four
[16:52] o'clock in the morning yeah at Denny's
[16:57] you love the Lord we're gonna ask our
[17:00] brother Isaac to come forth put on the
[17:03] word it's a difficult thing to be a
[17:06] preacher a lot of times people think
[17:09] that you just get up here and just start
[17:10] talking but it means nothing went until
[17:13] God comes on the scene so we asked our
[17:16] brother to come and like I said enjoy
[17:19] yourself let God go and let God have his
[17:22] way let him be the spokesman and we'll
[17:24] be okay
[17:43] god bless you
[17:45] good to be in the house of the Lord one
[17:47] more time you may and we sent God for
[17:51] this opportunity and we thank brother
[17:53] Brooks for this opportunity so we
[17:55] believe that God will be here in God
[17:58] will answer our prayers and God will
[18:00] meet our needs and reign would you
[18:03] please stand and open the Bible in the
[18:07] book of Genesis chapter 6
[18:20] let's pray first your Heavenly Father
[18:24] Lord we thank you for your grace we
[18:25] thank you for the word this opportunity
[18:27] of the word so we ask you a cheese's
[18:30] cause to speak O Lord Lord bless Lord
[18:34] they hear the years old God bless me
[18:37] Lord Jesus club put me Lord out of the
[18:39] way and you speak although Jesus Lord
[18:42] you know the needs of your people Lord
[18:44] meet their need or father we thank you
[18:46] Jesus cross in Jesus Christ's name Amen
[18:49] so we open our Bible in the book of
[18:52] Genesis chapter 6 verse 11 to verse 14
[19:01] the Bible says the earth also was
[19:05] corrupt before God and the earth was
[19:08] filled with violence and God looked up
[19:11] on the earth and behold it was Cara and
[19:14] behold he was corrupt for all flesh had
[19:17] corrupted his way upon the earth and God
[19:21] said unto Noah the end of all flesh has
[19:24] come before me for the earth is filled
[19:28] with violence through them and behold I
[19:31] will destroy them with the with the
[19:33] earth make the an ark of gopher wood
[19:36] rooms shalt thou make in the Ark and
[19:40] shalt pitch it within and without with
[19:43] pitch Amen let's go again and Luke
[19:46] chapter 16 verse 16
[20:05] Luke 16:16 the Bible says the law and
[20:12] the prophets were until John since that
[20:15] time the kingdom of God is preached and
[20:18] every man presses into it
[20:21] amen you may be sitting so in this verse
[20:26] right here the word that I wanna
[20:29] underline
[20:29] is the word crisis and my subject
[20:33] tonight is run into the ark because I
[20:38] believe that we are at the end time and
[20:40] it's time that we need to run into the
[20:43] ark as our safety it's not time to walk
[20:46] it's a time to run because we don't have
[20:49] time so and tonight we'll use the York
[20:52] as the York tonight we usually will
[20:56] represent the Holy Ghost and we need to
[21:00] run so we need to press to receive the
[21:03] Holy Ghost cause the time is at hand and
[21:05] it is so important and for us to be
[21:08] saved and for us to be raptured and for
[21:10] us to meet God we need to have the Holy
[21:13] Ghost and if you and if you notice that
[21:16] in the Bible when God talks about our
[21:19] destruction with no one he first sent
[21:23] the sign you first gave no other sign
[21:26] you know you first gave the people the
[21:28] sign you know we don't know what you
[21:29] know go tell the people go preach the
[21:32] word that I would destroy that the word
[21:34] we thought and now the way the people
[21:38] took the the way the people are took
[21:42] what Noah was saying so that was
[21:45] imparting their salvation because when
[21:48] the word is preached or God is telling
[21:50] your message the way that you are the
[21:52] way that you take the Word of God the
[21:54] way you respond to it that impacts your
[21:57] salvation that impacts your future
[21:59] because you'll notice that when Noah was
[22:01] preaching the word people at the first
[22:04] time I believe that the first time when
[22:05] you preach the word many people believed
[22:07] it but as long as you know no I was with
[22:10] the day was passing years was passing
[22:13] and people now got used to the word and
[22:15] mainly of them know now started to quit
[22:19] no I first when he started to preach he
[22:21] had a big church and make a church
[22:23] because everybody was afraid of the
[22:25] judgement everybody was afraid of the
[22:27] flood but after it no people now thought
[22:30] that God was slack and God promises
[22:32] judgment so he will not fulfill it so
[22:35] now they began not to quit they say well
[22:38] maybe tomorrow we all have a time
[22:40] tomorrow so let's just forget about it
[22:43] tonight so we have to go do our own
[22:44] business we have to go drink we have to
[22:46] go party we have to go do this and that
[22:48] you know we'll have another chance
[22:50] tomorrow but I forget that one day the
[22:53] Noah's sermon was the last sermon for
[22:56] them so in 2 so they had to go into the
[22:59] ark for them to be saved and you all
[23:01] know the story that they didn't go there
[23:04] and God wanted to save people what God
[23:07] wanted to save the entire you mind you
[23:09] mind it so for that you just stood you
[23:12] just don't know I said you know just
[23:14] bring the animals instead of man because
[23:16] men I gave them the warning but any God
[23:19] did they didn't get the warning so if we
[23:21] open our Bible in Hebrews chapter 11
[23:26] verse 7
[23:41] Hebrews 11 verse 7 the Bible said by
[23:44] faith by faith Noah being warned of God
[23:48] being warned of God of things that seen
[23:52] I'm sorry by faith being warned of God
[23:55] of things not seen as yet moved with
[23:59] fear prepared an ark to the saving of
[24:03] his house but by by the which he
[24:07] commanded the world and became her of
[24:11] the rod it became him and became heir of
[24:14] the righteousness with which is by faith
[24:16] so here you'll understand you see that
[24:19] God when Noah was warned by God he took
[24:22] God warning with fear if we consider God
[24:27] warning and he didn't neglect God's Word
[24:29] because he know that as the Bible says
[24:32] if you open your Bible the second Peter
[24:34] 2nd Peter chapter I think chapter 3
[24:37] verse 9 you will see the Bible say that
[24:39] God is not slack according to everything
[24:42] he says God is not said to cause many
[24:45] people now nowadays you know they think
[24:47] that when God says something and if the
[24:50] they does think many people think that
[24:53] when God says something nothing has to
[24:55] happen right there at the same time yet
[24:58] sometimes he has to do but sometimes God
[25:00] is taking you slowly but slowly you know
[25:03] it's now trying to see if you really
[25:05] hold the faith you know trying to see if
[25:07] you really believe the word because
[25:09] you're afraid of the destruction or if
[25:11] you really believe what God said so
[25:13] that's why when people first heard the
[25:17] voice the person first heard the sermon
[25:19] of Noah they was afraid and that's what
[25:21] you know many people believed it but
[25:24] after they saw that you know this
[25:26] message you know Noah was maybe just
[25:28] drank too much and he dreamed about
[25:30] bethought about something that would
[25:33] never happen and then they still not
[25:35] quitting because I when I was when we
[25:36] were coming I'm driving down here and I
[25:39] thought that maybe in that days when
[25:42] Noah was preaching the sky was clear
[25:45] then he never was before you know that
[25:47] for those men who thought maybe the
[25:49] cloud the clouds will be dark and we'll
[25:52] see some signs of the day of the rain
[25:55] and that will help them believe I said
[25:57] maybe the clear that the sky was clear
[26:00] and people couldn't even not have an
[26:02] idea that a flood would come or he will
[26:05] grant and people also was weren't warned
[26:09] by the first coming of Jesus because the
[26:12] Bible says in Isaiah when you read
[26:14] Isaiah he says that Jesus will come and
[26:17] he said about John the Baptist's how you
[26:20] know the highway will be made in the
[26:23] desert and all those stuff and when you
[26:25] read somewhere in the New Testament you
[26:28] will see that people I think the
[26:30] Pharisees came to Jesus they say they
[26:33] asked Jesus to show them the sign not
[26:35] because that here is the fact because
[26:37] people went we are warned because
[26:39] tonight I just want to speak about
[26:42] warning to warn the people because we
[26:45] are really at the end time and people
[26:47] when they were warned and notice
[26:49] something that they were China they have
[26:52] their own conception of the destruction
[26:55] and their own conception of the of the
[26:57] sons that goddess to God has to bring I
[27:00] give an example those people the
[27:02] Pharisees they thought that you know we
[27:04] will have the mountain you know the
[27:06] mountain will be will be cut off we have
[27:11] a highway in the desert and they I don't
[27:13] know what what else they were thinking
[27:14] about but they'll yes the Bible said it
[27:18] but the way God was saying it was
[27:20] another thing that what they were
[27:22] believing so the fact is that you know
[27:25] we we just have to be ready you know
[27:28] when God said we just have to be ready
[27:39] I'm sorry in the Ezekiel when you open
[27:49] it when we open it up when you've
[27:51] Ezekiel we see that music you talked
[27:54] about the the the the judgment also and
[27:57] people with did God told them that when
[28:00] you will seek out to the disciple when
[28:02] you will see these things coming to
[28:04] happen you know leave Jerusalem leave
[28:08] the room and then we noticed that that
[28:10] the people who escaped was there those
[28:14] people who had the Holy Spirit who
[28:17] received God and who received the
[28:19] warning of God and they took it into
[28:21] consideration and we did we know through
[28:23] the history we learned that 1.1 million
[28:27] people was dead why because they didn't
[28:30] take what God is what God promised or
[28:32] they didn't take what God warned them
[28:34] you know in in in practice and today we
[28:37] have so many small scriptures and we
[28:40] have so many things that telling us that
[28:42] we are at the end time that with this
[28:44] time for us to get the whole to receive
[28:46] the Holy Spirit it's time for us you
[28:48] know to put our lives in order it is
[28:50] time for us you know to to forsake every
[28:53] bad thing that we were doing it is time
[28:54] for us to cry unto God you know if you
[28:57] say that you don't have the whole spirit
[28:59] or if you see that your soul is empty it
[29:01] is time for us to come because the Bible
[29:03] said that that promise the Holy Spirit
[29:05] and this the one who's going to give you
[29:07] and the only thing that he has to do
[29:09] that you without you and I have to do is
[29:12] just to go to him and run to him and ask
[29:14] for him because the holy the Holy Spirit
[29:17] is the only thing that will rupture and
[29:19] then that's the only thing that we need
[29:22] to run Tammy that's the only thing that
[29:24] we take us into it and I was reading the
[29:27] people today need to need to see God's
[29:30] judgment as the people of Israel saw it
[29:32] the first time when God talked about
[29:34] when God told Moses that you know this
[29:37] night applied the black because I will
[29:40] pass over and I was the reading and I
[29:42] was doing a Bible study on there and I
[29:44] understand that that time the first time
[29:47] that the death there the Death Angel
[29:49] passed over was d4
[29:51] then the other time because that was
[29:53] real they knew that if they didn't apply
[29:56] the blood there was going to be dead
[29:59] there was going to be killed that the
[30:00] differential will kill the firstborn and
[30:02] they had to make sure that the blood was
[30:05] applied and listen the bag was applied
[30:08] the blood was applied in three place
[30:10] from the top and then the tube the two
[30:13] lentils and I was just trying and I said
[30:16] you know this time they're holy spirits
[30:19] who needs to be able fly in our lives in
[30:21] three places in our body soul and spirit
[30:23] you know in order for us to escape this
[30:26] death danger because God promised we are
[30:28] and in the third Exodus we did those
[30:31] things has to happen again and he said
[30:34] that you know they did the most
[30:37] important thing that he was saying he
[30:39] said that you know during these days
[30:42] keep the living out of the door of the
[30:46] house and when you read the Bible you
[30:49] will under you will understand that the
[30:51] delivered is sin his sin essence here is
[30:55] something that is not sincere and that's
[30:58] why when Jesus Christ was talking and
[31:00] did there the word if you read Jesus
[31:03] Christ they're the only times he used
[31:06] the word living in the in the speech was
[31:08] when he was talking to the Pharisees
[31:10] it's all the people don't be like them
[31:12] why because they thought that you know
[31:14] going to church it's fine going to
[31:17] church you know we're going to church or
[31:18] knowing the Bible knowing all the
[31:20] scriptures is fine but their lives
[31:22] inside of him was not reflecting what
[31:25] what they were reading their life inside
[31:27] was not reflecting the Bible and all the
[31:31] knowledge the head and Jesus told them
[31:33] to be aware of that living because it's
[31:36] not what you know that will make you
[31:38] rupture it's not watching it's not where
[31:40] you go to church that will make it right
[31:42] but it's the life of Christ inside of
[31:44] you it's the Holy Spirit and I believe
[31:47] that the Holy Spirit if somebody has the
[31:49] Holy Spirit you know he has to prove the
[31:51] life of Jesus he has to be like Jesus he
[31:54] has to do everything like Jesus he has
[31:56] to walk like Jesus has to talk like
[31:58] Jesus he has to pray like Jesus yes to
[32:01] read like Jesus and his life has really
[32:04] have to reflect the life of Jesus Christ
[32:07] and that's the time we're living in and
[32:10] today and if we see that we see that
[32:12] many things happen last month I think we
[32:15] heard about the earthquake and all the
[32:18] stuff and I was thinking I said you know
[32:20] the Bible talks about the earthquake at
[32:22] the end time that the earthquake will
[32:24] come and then after that will come death
[32:26] and the judgment the final thing and I
[32:28] said well people decides then every
[32:31] people say that you know this one was
[32:33] different than the other one so why
[32:35] people are still sleeping when they were
[32:39] when they are hearing and seeing all
[32:41] those kind of stuff
[32:42] so it is time for us to get out of sleep
[32:45] you know - it is time for us to run into
[32:47] God - run into the Ark and notice
[32:50] something in the Bible where we read
[32:52] Genesis chapter 6
[33:00] Genesis chapter 16 verse 14 the Bible
[33:06] says make thee an ark of gopher wood
[33:09] rooms shalt thou make the the making the
[33:14] Ark and shalt pitch it within and
[33:17] without with with pitch and notice if
[33:21] you see the the gaffer world the gaffer
[33:23] world if you see the knot the nature of
[33:25] it it's a wood that is pliable it's a
[33:29] wood that you can easily maneuver it's a
[33:32] wood that you can easily you know shape
[33:35] and do things and it is also a wood that
[33:39] has many holes inside and then jesus
[33:43] said and then god don't know and they
[33:45] say pitch it within and without with the
[33:48] pitch and the pitch if you see the pitch
[33:51] represent the Holy Spirit and you know
[33:54] every Christian you for you to have the
[33:56] Holy Spirit you have to be pliable to
[33:59] God you have to be shaped by God you
[34:02] have to be shape when the Bible tells
[34:03] you you know you have to do this and the
[34:06] Holy Spirit tells you you know someone
[34:08] who has the Holy Spirit has to be like
[34:10] this and like this you know you have to
[34:12] be you know is like a lamp like a lamp
[34:15] you know obedia
[34:16] to the Holy Spirit we have to be
[34:18] obedient to the Holy Spirit and that
[34:21] that was that the gaffer would they did
[34:23] I was think they did nature of the gaff
[34:25] wood and that was the only thing that
[34:27] was required to be saved at that time
[34:30] and because I believe that the time of
[34:32] Noah was also a scientific age and
[34:34] people also maybe thought about bidding
[34:37] being big art but mere bigger than what
[34:40] Noah was building with with steel and
[34:45] all those kind of things but that wasn't
[34:48] the thing that was going to save them
[34:51] from the fly God told them to get on
[34:54] Noah
[34:55] the only thing for you to be safe nor
[34:57] the only thing that will save you is to
[35:00] have this gopher wood to use it and to
[35:03] pitch it within and without and this
[35:06] timely that at the end time the only
[35:09] thing that will save you is to have the
[35:12] holy spirit within and without but when
[35:15] the Holy Spirit is within you and
[35:17] without any the outside will reflect
[35:20] everything that is within you because
[35:22] remember Jesus Christ said in the Bible
[35:25] that you know it's when the heart is
[35:28] full then the mouths because you know
[35:30] it's not what what it's not what you eat
[35:32] there they they were not defile you but
[35:37] it's what is inside of you and I believe
[35:40] that someone who has the Holy Spirit
[35:42] inside of him you know outside his life
[35:46] will show that he has the Holy Spirit
[35:49] people will have no doubt that this one
[35:52] ISM is God sent by a person who is God
[35:55] filled he is God filled shock and that's
[35:58] that's what the Holy Spirit does you
[36:00] know with that in the side of you and if
[36:03] you did you see or Stephen Stephen when
[36:07] he was there when was in front of those
[36:09] chief priests and he told them that you
[36:12] are uncircumcised were uncircumcised
[36:14] what because when you see circumcision
[36:17] takes away the the the extra part the
[36:21] surplus it takes away the everything and
[36:24] the Holy Spirit also takes away
[36:26] everything that is outside of the Word
[36:29] of God the
[36:30] holy spirit takes away everything your
[36:32] bad nature everything that you do that
[36:35] is wrong the Holy Spirit would take
[36:37] nothing away and and that's why I told
[36:40] them and I believe that today people
[36:42] needs to be circumcised with the Holy
[36:45] Spirit people needs to be circumcised in
[36:47] their hearts with the Holy Spirit of God
[36:50] and that's why you see that many people
[36:52] are doing things wrong thinking that
[36:55] they're worshipping God by doing those
[36:57] kind of thing I was listening I was
[37:00] reading the news and I found out that
[37:03] last year people went and their worship
[37:06] beyond see I don't know if you guys know
[37:09] them she is she's a singer and they made
[37:11] a church they went to church to worship
[37:13] Him I just want to read whether what I
[37:16] found on internet
[37:17] he said it's become that the title is
[37:21] people are going to church to worship
[37:22] Beyonce in Sainsbury San Francisco you
[37:26] say it's become a well-established fact
[37:29] that beyonce is a higher being worthy of
[37:32] our worship especially after her
[37:34] groundbreaking performance at Coachella
[37:37] earlier in April now San Francisco's
[37:41] Grace Cathedral is using the inspiration
[37:44] that is that is Queen Bee to take the
[37:48] masses to church Devine a contemporary
[37:52] worship service that combines
[37:55] progressive theology and pop music has
[37:58] announced that it will be holding a
[38:01] special much devoted to Beyonce's music
[38:03] and accomplishment on Wednesday April
[38:06] 25th 2018 worshippers will be able to
[38:11] sing along with Beyonce's heat and
[38:13] explore her or her inspirational history
[38:19] particularly how she opens a window into
[38:23] the lives of the marginal marginalized
[38:28] and forgotten a particularly black
[38:31] females as the church describes on its
[38:34] website the mass also includes reading
[38:38] from Scripture by a woman of color and
[38:41] sermon by Reverend Yolanda
[38:43] Norton who also teaches a course called
[38:46] a course called Beyonce and the Hebrew
[38:50] Bible as San Francisco TR Theological
[38:54] Seminary in this year where there's been
[38:57] so much conversation about the role of
[38:59] women of women and communities of color
[39:03] we felt a need to lift up the voices
[39:06] that the church has traditionally
[39:09] suppressed Reverend Jude Harmon founding
[39:13] pastor of divine divine is that the name
[39:17] of the church and director of an
[39:20] innovative ministry for Grace Cathedral
[39:22] talk the 3rd SFGate
[39:28] Herman addressed critics of of the mass
[39:32] adding that Jesus used very provocative
[39:36] images in the stories he would tell to
[39:39] incite people to us hard questions about
[39:42] their own religion or religious
[39:45] assumption those were all those open at
[39:49] 6:00 p.m. and the event begins at 6:30
[39:52] p.m.
[39:53] Devine encourages all attendant to use
[39:56] the hashtag Beyonce mass on social media
[40:00] more information about the Beyonce mass
[40:02] can be found in the vines Facebook event
[40:05] so we see all those things shows that we
[40:09] are at the end time that we don't have
[40:11] time to run or we don't have time to
[40:14] play to play Church no more it is the
[40:16] things that shows that you know we our
[40:19] God is coming soon so it is soon that's
[40:22] why I pray you that you may take this
[40:25] mission my message though broken Eddie
[40:28] as it is but you may take it into
[40:30] consideration as if God will come
[40:32] tonight because we don't know maybe God
[40:35] is coming tonight and if you're not
[40:37] ready brother I'm sorry to tell you that
[40:39] you will not go and this is thing and
[40:41] the thing is that when you see this I
[40:44] look some videos about this message and
[40:47] I saw that people went to church to that
[40:50] tree to worship Beyonce early and many
[40:53] people went there many people when they
[40:57] and I find and I said well now people
[40:59] are getting so called to God and then
[41:02] they are turning their hearts to things
[41:05] that is not real as the same thing as
[41:07] the Bible said that at the end time
[41:09] people will be pleased to listen to
[41:12] things that would satisfy their ears you
[41:14] know instead of going to where God is
[41:16] instead of going to where the Bible is
[41:18] preached instead of going to where the
[41:20] truth is preached and those things shows
[41:23] that we are at the endtime those things
[41:26] shows that it is time for us to run into
[41:29] the ark to ask God because God needs
[41:32] somebody who really need something it's
[41:34] like he's like someone is asking for
[41:37] something and if for example someone is
[41:40] asking for water and if the person is
[41:42] not thirst to drink the water you may
[41:45] give him water will not drink it would
[41:47] drink just a couple a couple couples a
[41:49] couple of times and then lift the water
[41:51] so God now needs someone who's thirsty
[41:53] you really you are really thirsty of the
[41:56] Holy Spirit really hungry of the Holy
[41:58] Spirit and God really sees their hunger
[42:01] inside of you and then it will give you
[42:03] the true food it will give you the Holy
[42:07] Spirit because that's the promise and we
[42:09] are at the end time and as I said that
[42:13] God told Moses he taught it on if you
[42:15] know apply the blood into the day apply
[42:18] the blood because when deandre when the
[42:20] death angel will come he will not see
[42:23] nothing else but the blood and he told
[42:26] him to apply the blood and he told him
[42:28] also you know when you apply the blood
[42:30] just don't stop by applying the blood
[42:32] but you have to be inside of the house
[42:35] you have to be in there don't go out
[42:37] cause the blood will only save people
[42:40] who will be inside and then when you are
[42:43] inside take the lamp eat the lamb and
[42:46] eat the lamb
[42:47] kill the lamb it and and then do
[42:51] everything that the Bible says in Exodus
[42:53] chapter 12 and the Bible and God and
[42:56] when you have the Holy Spirit you have
[42:59] to stay inside of God's kingdom don't go
[43:03] out cause because the blade defends you
[43:05] and I believe that a deferential way is
[43:07] also passing and this time and now this
[43:10] time
[43:10] not only killing the firstborn by this
[43:12] killing everybody would don't have the
[43:14] blood in their own knife the time now
[43:17] the time the you got the Death Angel is
[43:19] passing you know to kill everybody and
[43:21] the differential in this last time he's
[43:24] also seeing the blood of Jesus Christ
[43:26] because Jesus God shed his blood and
[43:29] when he went ape the blood of God was
[43:31] shed you know the blood of God
[43:35] that is the the Holy Spirit for us and
[43:37] the blood of and Jesus square represent
[43:39] the Lamb that that if the chin of Israel
[43:41] was hidden and the Jesus Christ is the
[43:43] Lamb he died it was the lamb and then he
[43:46] we went as the Bible said that the land
[43:48] could not have anything in it that if
[43:52] things in his body and Jesus God would
[43:55] check and he didn't have nothing and
[43:57] also but one thing that I love is that
[43:59] when they when Jesus was crucified
[44:02] normally in the Romans culture what they
[44:05] have if somebody's dead that you
[44:08] crucifying that they take the done the
[44:10] hammer they tried to break the bones and
[44:13] the when they broke the bonds of the two
[44:15] other our prisoner all the two hundred
[44:19] teeth
[44:20] arriving at Jesus Christ instead of
[44:22] breaking his born you know they noticed
[44:24] that this man was already he's already
[44:27] that and then what they did that you
[44:29] they tried their arm what the world yeah
[44:33] their peers him and when they pierced
[44:36] him water and blood came out of him you
[44:38] know one thing is that Jesus Christ
[44:41] bones could not be broken why because
[44:44] the Bible said that the lamb could not
[44:45] have any broken bones and and when they
[44:49] pierced him blood and water came out of
[44:51] him why to make you clean and to save
[44:55] you you know to clean your to clean you
[44:57] from unbelief to clean you from all
[45:00] dirty things that you have to clean you
[45:02] for everything and then to save you and
[45:04] then to feel you're with the Holy Spirit
[45:07] and then Jesus Christ and then Jesus
[45:09] caught when you went out you went to
[45:11] preach he went to preach if you want to
[45:16] preach there the soul that was in prison
[45:18] and when he came out with them he went
[45:20] he was with the disciple and he taught
[45:22] he spent fifth he spent forty
[45:24] sample and then it's all there and he
[45:27] told them to go wait in the upper room
[45:29] and there then then the tenth day the
[45:32] test day that was the day of Pentecost
[45:34] that is 1550 uni there will be filled
[45:38] with the Holy Spirit he told them to
[45:40] wait until they are filled with the Holy
[45:43] Spirit and then leave the room for going
[45:46] to - - to pray and photographer going to
[45:49] serve Him and do other stuff and then
[45:51] and then they were filled with the Holy
[45:53] Spirit and we see that when they were
[45:55] filled with the Holy Spirit they
[45:57] naturally have you know they were
[45:59] changed we see Peter who was who was
[46:02] afraid and who was scared of call
[46:06] preaching about Jesus who even denied
[46:08] Jesus called three times but we see
[46:10] Peter after being filled with the Holy
[46:12] Spirit came out in front of many people
[46:15] and preached they pray the Word of God
[46:17] and if you see acts 2 you see that when
[46:20] he opened he first opened that he first
[46:23] used the key that got Gavin he said
[46:26] repent and be baptized in the name of
[46:28] Jesus Christ and then you will receive
[46:30] the gift of the Holy Spirit and people
[46:32] repented and they were baptized in the
[46:35] name of Jesus squad and 3,000 people
[46:37] were saved at the same moment and this
[46:41] is the same key that people if they need
[46:43] to receive the Holy Spirit and in their
[46:45] words meet their needs to repent and be
[46:47] baptized and then they will receive the
[46:50] Holy Spirit and here is the thing that
[46:52] God says jesus said there's three steps
[46:54] to receive the Holy Spirit this first
[46:56] justification sanctification and the
[46:58] baptism on the wood and then you'll be
[47:00] fitted with with the Holy Spirit and
[47:02] justification what it does is just when
[47:05] someone hear the word of God and you
[47:07] feel that you know I have to make my
[47:10] life I have to may be empty to fix my
[47:13] life with God and you goes to God a
[47:16] review he repents and when you repent
[47:19] God takes away or God erases all his
[47:23] scene that it did before his passing and
[47:27] now the balance now is at zero that
[47:30] don't mean that the thing that made him
[47:32] cause the scene or them down it up if
[47:35] the thing the order life dime
[47:38] kodada made him sin is dead is still
[47:41] there it's like you have let me give an
[47:44] example it's like I have two pens I have
[47:48] two up this is a pen and this is a
[47:50] pencil it's two different things
[47:53] let's say that this one is a sinner and
[47:56] this one is someone when he when he has
[47:59] the Holy Spirit how it will be so this
[48:01] person if you write the day written with
[48:05] the things will be will come will be
[48:07] another color will be blue and then this
[48:10] one will be black and the blue let's say
[48:13] you represent sin because when you write
[48:15] it sin because when someone is not saved
[48:17] the exaction is nature is sin everyday
[48:20] thing that he do is see so for him if
[48:23] this guy chooses to go before God and
[48:28] repent from his sin that will not take
[48:31] they will not take the nature the inside
[48:34] nature of him out already would not take
[48:36] will not kill this name he will just
[48:39] erase God just will just erase
[48:42] everything that was written in the paper
[48:44] on the paper and then if then after if
[48:47] it passes the first step of
[48:49] justification he now arrives a
[48:51] sanctification now God is now killing
[48:54] the nature that will make this pen right
[48:57] blue and then after killing it after
[49:01] killing the predator this person now it
[49:03] will be empty and then after being empty
[49:06] God now we'll put the up the coast
[49:09] I can take it out I'm sorry God now I
[49:12] will take this one and it will put it
[49:14] inside so that you may write blood
[49:17] things and the blood thing represents me
[49:19] let's say you represent the Holy Spirit
[49:21] and that's the same thing with man if
[49:23] you have for example let's say someone
[49:25] he has a spirit of lust and molest and
[49:29] angry and all the stuff and all those
[49:31] kind of scene of drinking and partying
[49:34] and all those things so if it goes
[49:37] before God and you pray God Lord I need
[49:39] you to forgive me Lord I need your grace
[49:41] Lord and I really I really want to
[49:44] change and I need your grace the first
[49:45] step of justification God would take
[49:48] everything that it did before because
[49:51] when we're better it's for the remission
[49:53] of sin for your past sin now we take
[49:56] everything that it did before
[49:58] it will forget it so it will clean it
[50:01] and then the balance is zero that don't
[50:03] mean that then the same nature that made
[50:06] you say damaged you or drink or damaged
[50:08] you smoked or damaged you the other
[50:10] thing is that it's not that just the
[50:13] thing that you did before is now at zero
[50:15] pair the balance now it's easier and
[50:17] then you go to God and you you still
[50:20] pray God now will start out to change
[50:23] your nature but clearly the serpent that
[50:26] is inside of you and then after that
[50:28] after you clean because one thing is
[50:30] that God can never feel a dirty person
[50:33] or a dirty or a dirty vessel so he has
[50:36] first to clean you to make you empty you
[50:39] have first to be empty for God to fill
[50:41] you and then and then after going to God
[50:44] and then you will realize that the
[50:47] nature that you were you you know some
[50:49] you were your past life was that if you
[50:52] smell like a do like a beer or if you
[50:55] smell like a a smoke you know you will
[50:57] have that nature to go drink you will
[50:59] have that nature to go to go smoke but
[51:01] now you will notice that something has
[51:03] changed inside of you that even though
[51:05] you smell that you smell it but you
[51:08] don't have the nature of going again of
[51:11] smoking of of drinking and then after
[51:15] that God is now killing that nature
[51:17] inside of you and then after you are
[51:19] empty
[51:20] God is not will feel you're not with the
[51:23] holy spirit and it fills you with the
[51:25] holy spirit now you become a new person
[51:27] a born again person and that they they
[51:31] dester the three steps that that's the
[51:33] three steps that brings to them that
[51:35] that brings to the holy spirit and
[51:36] notice that Peter say that repent and be
[51:39] baptized and Bill you will be filled
[51:41] with the Holy Spirit that's the key you
[51:43] need the Holy Spirit repent be baptized
[51:47] there be repent be baptized and God will
[51:49] fill you and when we repent he has to be
[51:51] with sincerity you have to be sincere
[51:54] inside of you that God you know I you
[51:57] know I rather if you don't feel me with
[51:59] the Holy Spirit today or tonight you
[52:01] know I rather died I filled me with the
[52:04] Holy Spirit and
[52:05] don't leave the poopit or don't leave
[52:08] the church or don't leave the place that
[52:10] where you will ask until you will be
[52:12] filled with the Holy Spirit needs to see
[52:15] if you really need it or if you really
[52:17] you know you're really thirsty or you
[52:19] really hungry of it because notice that
[52:21] in the time of Noah as I said that many
[52:24] people believe that the first time by
[52:26] God knew God - it took a hundred and
[52:29] twenty and twenty years for the flood to
[52:32] come off or the rent where - to rent God
[52:35] was saying if those person who believed
[52:37] at the same time if they believed
[52:39] because they really wanted to be saved
[52:41] or they believed because they were just
[52:43] scared of and that's what God is looking
[52:46] for God needs you you see the inside of
[52:48] you it really needs you to see that you
[52:51] know here you know if I'm not saved
[52:55] I would they God kill me or save me it's
[52:57] just two things and that's the kind of
[53:00] heart that God is needed not the kind of
[53:02] heart that God is looking for because
[53:03] the Holy Spirit's I said the Holy Spirit
[53:06] it is really important as we say that
[53:09] jesus promised that the Jesus told you
[53:12] know the end time will come and he
[53:14] talked about is it Ezekiel say that you
[53:17] know the death angel will pass and it
[53:19] will kill everybody every person who
[53:21] will always not see and he passed and he
[53:24] cured it and we say that 1.1 million
[53:27] people came and if we open the Bible in
[53:30] Revelation chapter 7
[53:50] Revelation chapter 7 verse 1 into verse
[53:55] 3 and after these things I saw four
[53:58] angels standing on the four corners the
[54:02] corners of the earth holding the four
[54:04] winds of the earth that the wind should
[54:07] not blow on the earth nor on the sea nor
[54:11] on any tree and I saw another angel
[54:16] ascending from from the east having the
[54:19] seal of the Living God and you cried
[54:22] with the loud voice the four and to the
[54:26] four angels to whom it was given to hurt
[54:29] the earth and the sea saying hurt not
[54:32] the earth neither the sea nor the trees
[54:35] till we have sealed the servants of our
[54:39] God in their forehead amen this
[54:43] scripture right here talks about when
[54:47] you see that you read you see that the
[54:50] the wind and there are four angels was
[54:54] on the on the four four corners of the
[54:56] earth and the wind represents wars so
[55:00] wars and then hear that they were
[55:05] decided you know the decision was made
[55:07] that they weren't going to kill every
[55:10] person who was not who didn't have the
[55:12] seal of God but listen another angel
[55:15] told them to stop not to kill but to
[55:18] wait until I had to wait until there are
[55:22] some other people who would need to be
[55:25] sealed who needs to have the seal of God
[55:28] who needs to be sealed in their forehead
[55:32] who needs to be sealed in their
[55:33] foreheads you know for you two to start
[55:36] again or to kill everybody cuz the time
[55:39] was not that it wasn't the time for them
[55:42] to kill and when we see through the
[55:44] history we see that the First World War
[55:47] World War one day the World War one that
[55:51] the end of the World War one till now
[55:53] nobody knows how it stuff it was
[55:57] miraculous and I believe that this the
[56:00] other thing that that this scripture
[56:02] should
[56:03] normally happen in the First World War
[56:05] one because nobody knew how to how how
[56:10] how we stopped it was God God hands who
[56:13] stopped it God so that is so that I have
[56:16] my children who are not sealed yet who
[56:19] don't have the Holy Spirit yet so I need
[56:21] first to fill them with the Holy Spirit
[56:23] you know in order for their in order for
[56:26] the word to be I mean for so that the
[56:27] word be destroyed because God cared
[56:29] about you God cared about God cared
[56:32] about you wanted to see you with him you
[56:35] wanted to help you you know to sup with
[56:37] you he wanted to you didn't want to lose
[56:40] you so that's why he had to stop
[56:42] everything yeah that's why he had to
[56:44] stop the world that's why he has to stop
[56:47] you know the destruction so that you may
[56:49] be saved so that you may be filled and
[56:52] then God gave you now God now he's
[56:55] giving you the opportunity to be fit to
[56:57] be feel please don't reject this
[57:00] opportunity
[57:01] please don't take God as if he's like no
[57:04] God is not like everything that God said
[57:06] no matter how long that thing took that
[57:09] thing came to happen came to pass God is
[57:12] not stuck to his judgment God is not
[57:15] like you say that you know ask for the
[57:17] Holy Spirit and I would give you it you
[57:19] know people ask for the Holy Spirit and
[57:21] they gave the guy gave them the horsemen
[57:23] I ask for the Holy Spirit and God gave
[57:25] me the Holy Spirit many people in this
[57:27] church ask for the Holy Spirit and God
[57:28] gave them the Holy Spirit that means
[57:31] that this promise didn't lie because I
[57:33] experienced their promise and that
[57:35] promise word didn't lie to me was real
[57:37] and then this promise is the same thing
[57:40] if you tonight make a decision now I
[57:44] want to serve I want to serve God Lord
[57:46] Jesus I heard you up I heard I heard
[57:49] your voice and I heard the warning that
[57:51] the earth is now it way that the earth
[57:53] will be now destroyed and the only
[57:55] person who needs who will be saved is
[57:58] the only is the one who will have the
[58:00] Holy Spirit and I found out that myself
[58:02] I don't have the words because now it's
[58:04] the time to be sincere whether you're
[58:06] happy or you don't have it don't assume
[58:09] that you have the thing while you don't
[58:11] have the thing the time is there the
[58:13] door is still open God can see I can see
[58:16] you tonight
[58:17] assuming that you have the thing and
[58:19] then be surprised at the end time when
[58:21] God will call up those who have it now
[58:24] the time is open if you don't have the
[58:26] Holy Spirit if you hear the word of God
[58:28] God is present right now and God can
[58:31] fill you with the Holy Spirit you say
[58:33] that he's going to feel he's going to
[58:34] fill those who will ask for it he said
[58:37] knock and it shall be opened to you us
[58:39] and it shall be given to you seek and
[58:42] you will find and seeking knocking and
[58:45] asking that it doesn't mean that you
[58:47] knock one time and then you go no keep
[58:50] knocking keep seeking if God didn't feel
[58:53] you tonight keep asking keep seeking
[58:55] that's what God needs God needs you the
[58:58] God needs you to keep you know keep
[59:00] thirsting of God every day every day
[59:02] though you have the Holy Spirit keep
[59:05] asking God to refill you with the Holy
[59:07] Spirit to refill you because I want to
[59:09] be more God as long as you know the time
[59:12] is going and you know the end is coming
[59:14] I want to be more God I want to be just
[59:16] like God I want my life to express or to

[1:01:02] we appreciate the Lord Jesus I'm a
[1:01:06] witness
[1:01:09] well I'm one of those people that I'll
[1:01:11] never step foot in Beyonce's Church
[1:01:16] absurd but when we think about all that
[1:01:21] he said tonight well God said through
[1:01:24] him it is time to run I believe it's
[1:01:28] Zachariah says when you see and the
[1:01:30] vision has been made plain let him that
[1:01:33] read it let him run it it's time to run
[1:01:37] earthquakes in divers places Wars rumors
[1:01:41] of wars
[1:01:42] everybody knows something's happening
[1:01:44] even if they're not even you know in
[1:01:47] church and they know people are going
[1:01:50] insane totally insane calling right
[1:01:54] wrong and wrong right I could remember
[1:01:57] the time when I used to work at a club
[1:02:02] and I was alcoholic and God delivered me
[1:02:06] but I had to cry out okay you know III
[1:02:10] couldn't just say Jesus I cried out like
[1:02:14] a madman
[1:02:15] but there I was in that room and that
[1:02:18] wind came and when it passed through me
[1:02:23] I didn't go through no DTS or anything
[1:02:25] like that it was gone
[1:02:29] every time I cried out for something God
[1:02:32] always gave would give it to me he
[1:02:36] talked about the scripture there in
[1:02:38] Genesis y'all know this is a woman's
[1:02:42] world I have nothing against women
[1:02:44] I really don't but the serpent told Eve
[1:02:51] your eyes will be open and he promised
[1:02:55] her that she one day would become as God
[1:02:59] now we understand that the world is
[1:03:02] worshipping women that's a prophecy
[1:03:07] everywhere you go there's the boss not
[1:03:11] no harm no how feeling sisters I'm just
[1:03:15] letting you know that that is that
[1:03:18] inspiration he talks about the third
[1:03:22] Exodus there is an exodus Hollywood no
[1:03:26] the world has spin the fall they all
[1:03:29] kinds of earthquake movies if it ain't
[1:03:32] no earthquake it's an asteroid something
[1:03:34] striking the earth and destroying us and
[1:03:36] bringing us to it distinction when all
[1:03:39] you got to do is read the black book he
[1:03:43] said what are you saying brothers I'm
[1:03:45] trying to tell you no I want to scream
[1:03:47] sometime because I realized Amen that
[1:03:50] people are just not getting it my mother
[1:03:53] was a Christian now used to just feel so
[1:03:56] sorry for because I didn't understand
[1:04:03] how could she live how you lived this
[1:04:04] way I thought it was human effort I
[1:04:07] thought it was something I had to do it
[1:04:11] was like our brother Isaac said when you
[1:04:13] get the Holy Ghost it changes you
[1:04:15] it take away the darkness and brings you
[1:04:18] into light wonderful message brother I
[1:04:22] was blessed today because you know a lot
[1:04:25] of times you think am I the only one
[1:04:27] really seeing it the way I'm seeing it
[1:04:31] look at our United States it's falling
[1:04:34] apart not just our country all the
[1:04:38] countries nation against nation go read
[1:04:41] Matthew 24 it's right in the book
[1:04:45] sincerity about I love this and I'm not
[1:04:48] gonna prolong the time but one thing I
[1:04:51] will say I really enjoyed the message
[1:04:53] brother and it's people like you and
[1:04:57] myself people who maybe not be so
[1:05:00] polished I don't think John the Baptist
[1:05:04] was polish was it
[1:05:05] was he one of those intellectuals that
[1:05:07] had the collar and everything else
[1:05:10] everything in place my fact John was
[1:05:13] like a wild man hallelujah amen eating
[1:05:18] locusts like peanuts and popcorn right
[1:05:24] while here smelly but those are the
[1:05:29] kinds of people that God uses he
[1:05:32] purposely uses people like that because
[1:05:36] of our mind I was thinking Jesus was
[1:05:40] purposely born in a manger over a manure
[1:05:46] pile y'all hear what I'm saying God
[1:05:48] always takes the scum of the earth
[1:05:50] the little people and he hides himself
[1:05:55] in it he took a murder by the name of
[1:05:57] Moses y'all know what I'm saying all I'm
[1:06:00] saying is I know I heard from God
[1:06:02] through a little brother by the name of
[1:06:04] Isaac because it is time to run I come
[1:06:09] to this church almost every day praying
[1:06:11] and crying out not just for this this
[1:06:14] church but for the Christians everywhere
[1:06:17] that God will take the veil off of their
[1:06:19] eyes because many will be left behind
[1:06:22] because they don't see the time we're
[1:06:26] living in the warning has been given
[1:06:29] like our brother saved and at what point
[1:06:32] in time will this thing come I got me a
[1:06:34] message one day that's what that's all
[1:06:36] yeah one day it's going to happen one
[1:06:39] day you love the Lord
[1:06:42] thank you brother appreciate it anybody
[1:06:47] these our prayer

[1:06:57] cancer
[1:06:58] and my the only sister that I have left
[1:07:01] she has cancer as well I've got three
[1:07:05] siblings left and two of them have
[1:07:08] cancer and neither them know Jesus so I

[1:07:23] into hell so I need your prayers that
[1:07:27] God would open those doors for me that I
[1:07:30] might be able to witness to my brother

[1:07:48] to do that go to church that's how I
[1:07:51] don't know I don't but he sees something
[1:07:55] because he told me one time he said
[1:07:58] there's God he admitted there's got to
[1:08:00] be a higher order higher God somebody's
[1:08:02] looking out for you only because I was
[1:08:06] being led by God several times when he

[1:09:45] short of the glory of God we pray father
[1:09:48] God tonight that you would bless each

[1:09:53] are unspoken requests those that you
[1:09:56] know Lord God we pray father that you
[1:09:59] were touched just now made this word
[1:10:01] echo in every heart here tonight that
[1:10:04] when we leave this place when we go home
[1:10:06] we'll remember the things that we've
[1:10:08] been told Lord that you're in the
[1:10:11] business of warning but father you
[1:10:14] always warn the people before you judge
[1:10:16] them granted father grant us grace in
[1:10:20] Jesus Christ's name we pray amen
[1:10:26] yes yes but okay
[1:10:34] I have attached a short testimony so um
[1:10:45] this summer I had some financial
[1:10:47] struggle and I did I never finished to
[1:10:51] pay my tuition at school and he always
[1:10:53] bothered me because I got his new job
[1:10:56] that I had and it wasn't meeting meeting
[1:10:58] the expectation the financial
[1:11:00] expectation of the job and so it was
[1:11:03] just a hard summer for me and just for
[1:11:07] all of us in the house just praying
[1:11:08] praying and we knew the consequences
[1:11:12] that if we don't finish the tuition on
[1:11:14] time then that means you'll add one more
[1:11:18] one more semester or one more year old
[1:11:20] school school year me and John and um it
[1:11:24] was very difficult because I transferred
[1:11:26] from a university in North Dakota to to
[1:11:29] Kirkwood in Iowa and being that at the
[1:11:32] community college you go to Community
[1:11:35] College for only two years but we'll be
[1:11:37] ending we would have been there for four
[1:11:39] years which was not according to our
[1:11:41] plans so I was just praying praying and
[1:11:45] one day oh I had a dream that I had this
[1:11:49] dream that God showed me the first of
[1:11:52] all even about this dream I have a lot
[1:11:54] of dreams but the only concern is that
[1:11:57] my dreams never come to pass so I had
[1:12:00] that really bothered me though because I
[1:12:02] know I heard brother branham said that
[1:12:03] if you have a dream any gift that you
[1:12:06] have give it to God yo usee and so one
[1:12:08] day I just went to prayer and that's all
[1:12:10] God that I dream alive but why do none
[1:12:14] of my dreams never come to pass I'll
[1:12:16] believe rather Brennan said that if you
[1:12:18] have a dream if you dream a lot before
[1:12:20] you sleep make sure you you read the
[1:12:22] word you think about Christ and then
[1:12:23] you'll use that gift and I'm like God
[1:12:26] I'm giving you this gift that you
[1:12:27] putting me use it and the very next day
[1:12:29] as I slept and I night I had this dream
[1:12:32] that I saw somebody that came and gave
[1:12:34] me $2,000 for my tuition and but I was
[1:12:38] afraid to talk to tell people because my
[1:12:40] dreams never come to pass and but I kept
[1:12:43] it in my heart and in the morning I just
[1:12:45] see our mom she's like the
[1:12:47] there is a person that's gonna give me
[1:12:49] $2,000 for the tuition I'm like well I
[1:12:53] had this dream and I saw this person
[1:12:55] coming to give you $2,000 and so that's
[1:12:59] when I taught her this testimony and I
[1:13:01] was able to finish my tuition and John
[1:13:03] was able to finish this trician now we
[1:13:05] had this one more latitude to climb over
[1:13:10] it was registering for classes it was
[1:13:13] very late just like a few days before
[1:13:15] classes start and we knew the
[1:13:17] consequences so brother Jesse Smith came
[1:13:19] and after the service the service in Des
[1:13:22] Moines outside of I told him about it
[1:13:24] I'm like let me just break and he prayed
[1:13:28] for me I told him that according to our
[1:13:30] plans we want to graduate in May but we
[1:13:33] know that if we don't like there is a
[1:13:35] probably 90% that the classes are
[1:13:38] already full because we checked in the
[1:13:40] classes were full and but we still pray
[1:13:43] we trusted God and the next day I told
[1:13:46] him that I'm going to go to school on
[1:13:48] Monday which was then the following day
[1:13:50] so I went to school that day I met with
[1:13:52] my advisor and still he seemed like he
[1:13:56] even seemed like the prayer wasn't even
[1:13:58] answer because the classes were still
[1:14:00] full there was one class that only had
[1:14:03] one person left to be in the class but
[1:14:06] not to brag up on that but I gave that
[1:14:09] class to my brother John so that I can I
[1:14:11] could have missed that class but I gave
[1:14:12] it to him and now I was missing two
[1:14:15] classes but he was only missing one
[1:14:16] class but um I was like we prayed about
[1:14:20] this so I kept on sure I think even the
[1:14:22] adviser said that at this point you know
[1:14:25] it'll be up to the professor so just
[1:14:28] admit you into the class but one class
[1:14:31] was most likely now going to admit us
[1:14:34] because I was behind in the weight these
[1:14:37] three people before me and I'm like hi
[1:14:39] in the world
[1:14:40] are going to happen but still kept on
[1:14:42] trusting God the following day on
[1:14:44] Tuesday because she told me that the
[1:14:47] professor doesn't even see our emails
[1:14:49] she is only going to answer when school
[1:14:51] is back but the following day I was
[1:14:54] driving to work and I had something in
[1:14:56] my life that I need to make right with
[1:14:58] God and in the car I just felt that so
[1:15:00] hard in my life in my heart and I just
[1:15:02] stopped the car and I just asked God to
[1:15:03] forgive me and as soon as I just asked
[1:15:06] God to forgive me something kind of told
[1:15:08] me to check to check in the in the could
[1:15:10] you check my classes and I went through
[1:15:12] the website and I checked my classes I
[1:15:14] so we got the permission to register I'm
[1:15:17] like maybe just maybe they always say
[1:15:20] that so let me try to register if
[1:15:22] they'll let me in and I tried to
[1:15:24] register for all my two classes and I
[1:15:26] got in the world and I texted my brother
[1:15:30] I'm like John try to get into those
[1:15:32] classes maybe they'll let you in don't
[1:15:34] try
[1:15:37] [Applause]
