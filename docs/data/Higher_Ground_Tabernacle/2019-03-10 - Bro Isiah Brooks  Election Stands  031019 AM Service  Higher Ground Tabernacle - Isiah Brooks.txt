ministering to to this evening he's ministering in Iowa City this morning we kind of switched it around for a particular reason but nevertheless those of you who if you come out this evening you'll hear him preach this morning yeah this evening we had a wonderful service on last night it's been a long time since I've seen broken hearts folks weeping at the altar it was amazing the power of God came into the place at the end of the service I said God gave us the answer to all of our problems and I trust by this morning God will bless you we're living in the last days and I'm gonna read the scriptures and then we'll let you be seated good to see you always we're gonna ask that you turn with us to st. John the 6th chapter and then we'll go right to Romans 9 we're gonna finish up the service that we started on Wednesday I believe that you and I must have some assurance amen because times are not getting easier and we know by the scripture things are going to get more difficult there's only one hiding place and that is in Jesus Christ so we it behooves us to refocus ourselves understand what the coming of the Lord is all about we can see as a people that the nation is falling apart I mean spiritually politically you name it everything is chaotic and the Bible said in the midst of confusion there's every evil work so understand that Satan is in the background of all of this on the forefront pretty much so now but let's read the scripture before I go any further we're going to reach st. John the 6th chapter we're gonna started the 37th verse we're so happy to see everybody here this morning and then we'll go to Romans nine Romans and I say John 6:37 through 40 all that the father giveth me shall come to me and him that coming to me I will in no wise cast out for I came down from heaven not to do my own will but the will of him that sent me now mind you Jesus Christ is saying I came down to do the will of my father so if he came to do his will we have come to do his will and this is the Father's will which have sent me that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing but should raise it up again at the last day I love that and this is the will of him that sent me that everyone would see it the Son and believeth on him may have everlasting life and I will raise him up at the last day what a promise Romans 9 10 through 12 I mean excuse me 10 through 18 and not only this but when Rebekah also had conceived by one even by our Father Isaac for the children being not yet born neither having done any good or evil that the purpose of God according to election might stand I'm I read that again that the purpose of God according to election might stand not of works but of him that calleth it was also said unto her the elder shall serve the younger as it is written Jacob I loved but Esau have I hated so we can conclude that God doesn't love everybody like the world says what shall we say then is there a righteousness of God god forbid for he saith to Moses I will have mercy on whom I have mercy I will have mercy and I will have compassion of whom I will have compassion so then it is not of him that will it nor him that runneth but of God that showed mercy for the scripture says unto Pharaoh even for this same purpose have I raised thee up that I might show my power in thee and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth therefore hath he mercy on whom he will have mercy and whom he will he hardeneth pray father God we come before you Lord we thank you for your grace thank you for your mercy Lord you've been so good to us we pray Lord God this morning that your have died non-weight and the Lord will be careful to give you the praise glory and honor in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated one thing I like to really open up with so that we can know that the change is the changes that are now taking place things that we may not be aware of but one of the things that they're they are put that they have our government has put forth it's what they call a law that will stop men from criticizing others law that will that you and I can no longer preach against Muslims or or any kind of other religion because basically everybody's right in their own eyes but my point is is that you must understand that the told move is being legalized or brought to a place where the bride will eventually be persecuted she will come under fire because you are known as extreme religious people and you must understand that if God is is doing something if Satan is doing something then God is doing something as well while the world is going into a free fall as far as sins and laws this this nation has almost become lawlessness a nation of lawlessness and you and I must understand that God has principles and God has laws but even grace has laws because the Bible says shall we continue in sin that grace may abound god forbid what good it would it be to play football if there was no laws laws in football makes the game exciting boundaries basketball if there was no laws in basketball you can do whatever you would want to do to make the goal kick am an Indian or whatever you will say and and and and and and and they go go if but it would take away from the game we we think that grace is something that has no boundaries as you know but grace has boundaries there are laws and grace that you cannot cross grace a man should never become disgrace you understand what I'm saying and I often time we think that because we got grace we can live any kind of way to do whatever we want to and God is going to say oh it's okay no but the Word of God shall shall we continue in sin that grace may abound god forbid one thing I love about the Word of God because often time people say well you know you don't have to do all of that and they failed to see that you do the Bible says follow peace with all men and holiness without do y'all think God joking no man shall see God my message is election stands part two one thing about election it will the power of God that is released if I could say like that in in the in the in the in election because you got to understand you didn't know you were elected but something was released to you something God gave to you to make you know you were alerted all of us are sinners and without election you still would be but you must understand that if God doesn't come to a place and draw you to an intention of who you are you would never know who you are a word yeah you and I must understand that election comes to bring the change if I said in that we were all sinners we all were the children of Wrath but in the mind of God there were those who have been chosen from before the foundation of the world those who God would call for purpose think about it God told Israel you will be in Egypt for 400 years but I'm going to send you our deliverer and God didn't just go down the line of people and says eenie meenie miney moe no sir God in his mind knew that when he was going to sin a deliverer he understood and knew the makeup of Moses knew the mistakes of Moses hallelujah but there's something about election when God elects you to do anything there is no one else that can take your place hello Moses was a murderer but God elected him to be a prince he was an a wealthy man matter of fact he was an orphanage and often raised in Pharaoh's house and God chose him to be a great leader see because before God can lead you to do anything you must become nothing god don't use these people who oh I'm great I've done this and all I've done that remember him and Jesus said there be meaning that will come in that day saying Lord have I not done these things these mighty works in your name and God would say depart from me you workers of iniquity I don't even know you I'm gonna say some things here this morning and I hope they help you one thing about it when God saw us we were like a dirty glass he saw the glass he picked it up that's justification and from justification he brings you into sanctification the glass doesn't wash itself the one who picked the glass up the justifier he washes the glass the glass doesn't feel itself up the justifier the one who picked it up sanctified it and then put it into use hallelujah it is the individual is the person Christ Jesus that brings the work of grace in your life grace is not earned grace is not earned it's not you can't you can't map it it it is God's own favor toward you is that okay the thing that I love about it is that you know within yourself and you've heard me say this before many of us from our youth knew that we were different we didn't understand it why why am i different why I do two evil things doing evil things bother me when I have friends that it seems like it it does just just doesn't bother them Wow because election you had any representation of God only inside of you hello and because of that you thirst for righteousness prophet God said there's two kinds of people there's a people who can see and don't even care about it there's another group of people who sin and don't want to sin and that's those are the ones that God comes to give grace to if you are a person and you enjoy living simple and then righteously then more than likely you will never be saved but that individual don't he be a sinner aches in his heart because he can't control himself here's the fact that he's a liar he hates the fact that he's a thief he hates the fact they meant that he's one that just do things that he has no control over it but thought that is the man or woman that God can see remember the Bible said when God had Jacob and Esau God had already determined which one he was going to love he knew amen who and what they would turn out to be who they were and what they would turn out to be way before they became what we call beings in this dimension it was a world given before they were born Jacob I love and Esau I hate and Esau amen looked like he was the good guy and Jacob was sasai stir hallelujah but the difference between the two was that one had representation and the other one didn't it ain't always a good guy Amen that that looks good from the appearance of from our eyes it's what's on the inside hello you and I must understand a man that what God does or what he will do he will bring uh-uh went when you are chosen and elected he will make everything persistently place you now what are you saying brother Brooks see that's why the bride needs to squeeze she is the bride but she's left her first love now you said what do you mean see we look at later seeing said or later she left her first love but look at what we're doing don't you know a starchy church means is Ichabod the Lord has departed don't you know when you feed on filth is Ichabod in your life the Lord has departed don't you know when you've got bitterness in your heart the Lord has departed ah because you change your nature from a lamb to a wolf and only the Dove will abide with the lamb somebody help me here so you're wondering why you're having so much troubles and so many trials in your life is because God has stepped away it doesn't mean you're not elected it doesn't mean you hasn't it's not chosen but until you repent and turn back to that lamb's nature the Dove is looking at you from afar off hello somebody now I know you haven't seen and they had an experience with God in a long time and it ain't God's fault it's your own hello Scotty it doesn't mean that God won't use you God wants to use you but we must repent we must turn back to God as his Lord for give me for the nature that I have been displaying and this nature is not of you is that right there's only two natures one is of God and one is of the devil is that right listen but see God is willing to show mercy to the vessels of Honor it is God's mercy it meant that brings us into a place where we realize we cannot do anything without him that's what the devil loves to see you frustrated and angry and all this kind of stuff and really raring it you know railing and everything you because he knows when you can get you into that atmosphere the Dove is like and you're no longer you're no longer reflecting Jesus Christ come on somebody right but I want you to understand in all of that election stance God has said I will not lose one and no matter what you go through see I love it this way because your salvation in my salvation it's not in my hands it's in the hands of God but one thing about God he gives a space to repent that whether we repent and how quickly we repent we determine how quickly you become you get back into the presence of God if you've lost your joy hello Inca ba the lord has departed y'all here because you gotta realize it man the Bible said in the presence of the Lord there is fullness of joy grieve not the Holy Spirit whereby you were sealed unto the day of redemption is that right the Bible says stand fast therefore in the Liberty where with Christ have made us free and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage see what I'm sorry it is the devil's business to uh uh enchain us to yoke us up hallelujah with something that is not God oh come on Samson was he like elected chosen by God to do the will of God he failed God he had weaknesses but he still served the purpose of God but God had to put him in a position hello where he could look to order here for which cometh his help God had to put him in a place to make him remember what he was called for and that's the problem in man we have forgotten that we came here in this dimension to do the will of God is that right Jesus came to do the will of God you and I have come to do the will of God not what we want to do it is what God wants us to do hallelujah and you see we get confused we forget the cares of this world distracts us sometimes we think we're immoral in this flesh hallelujah we just think we're going to live forever in this dimension but we're just strangers pilgrims passing through but there is a work to do hallelujah I was thinking about that and I said oh god have mercy how many souls have I led to the Lord in this barren in the space and time that I've been a Christian or have I been so concerned about me me what I want from God we we we feel God sometimes is unfair because you know we won't God give me give me this give me this let me ask you what have you given God hallelujah we've come to serve God Jesus could have been rich he could have been wealthy but he forsook himself his desires foxes have holes birds have nests but the Son of man have no place to lay his head hallelujah he in the natural could have gotten married but he didn't because of you and I you and me he knew that we was going to need him hallelujah he didn't come to build a natural Kingdom his kingdom was spiritual he knew that his children would be spiritual hallelujah and he also knew that he would have children because the Bible said all that the father has given me will come you understand me when we talk about election amen we talk about the choice of God for an individual it is God who chooses you me and you don't choose God God chooses you some I said when I came to Jesus only because God drew you to him you don't automatically thirst for righteousness God put that first in your heart hallelujah it is God and Humanite must not just take advantage of grace the way we have we take advantage always grace it is Grace but like I said grace have longs is that right did you not know it meant grace can give you such a Liberty you feel like you can send whatever you want to do but you know there is a crossing line there are boundaries that's place and if you cross that line don't you understand you're in trouble in that right let me say it like this when I came to the Lord Jesus or when God called me I knew that was my last call I knew it and I did everything I could do to make my election sure but there were those who get into a place Amen they don't understand Amen that God has limits and some time we failed to see did you know that you know brother Branham said it like this he say God will allow a man to sin but when God tried to make him repent and he won't repent God allows that demon to torment him hello in other words you become so bound up by this thing that was pleasure it doesn't become pleasure anymore you become a slave it torments you why because you know what you're doing is wrong but you can't help but to do it and until you come to a place when you get tired and sick and tired and sick and tired of it God is gonna allow that demon to constantly torment you hello I know this ain't what you maybe wakes expecting this morning but I want you to understand Amen that this election stands it gives me such a and assuring such a strength to know that in all of my failures God is going to bring me through you and I must understand him and that grace is always right you can't merit heaven neither can you merit God is that Alright you see not what you do is what you believe you know that first of all the Bible said he that cometh to God must believe that he is God and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him now believe that he is God is where I meant how many you really believe that he is God now I may ask you a question is there anything too hard for God huh see all things are possible to them that believe oh let me see it like this if you and I want a revival from God we must change our nature hallelujah God came fellowship and he will not fellowship with the devil God needs you and I to humble ourselves and shorten Lord return return that Lamb nature back to me you know when it comes to a last nature he's willing he's ready they meant to really to to surrender everything hallelujah yeah come on when you know when you got the real Holy Ghost a man can spit in your face and he won't slap him back ain't that enough to shout about come off the real character of Christ will produce a nature in you that will not retaliate hello is that Jesus on the scene come on somebody oh that way you know we love that quote all that was in God God poured it into his church poured it into Christ and all that was in Christ he poured it into his church he did where's that cup that's full of Christ well as that body has fallen Jesus see that was the difference between those on the zouzhen Street and what we're working with now those people were lambs they were their nature was a nature of humility they didn't care whether they were rich or poor hallelujah they didn't care whether they have shoes on their feet hallelujah a food on their table they still trusted God and sometimes we can't trust God until the refrigerator is full it's the truth you and I must understand that grace will always be right when you can't do something when you seem like I can't overcome this that's where grace steps here that's when you see you need to say Lord I know I'm called according to your purpose this is something that should not be in my life and I cannot overcome it but I know the overcomer see you gotta talk to God you gotta let him know Lord you are my shepherd Oh Super Ball corner Zachariah God come down giving us grace grace hallelujah I won't his grace hallelujah but I also know that even in His grace I have to be careful you can't handle your brothers and sisters anyway and think well we're under grace the Bible said what would you do to the least of these you've done it unto me hallelujah if I mistreat amen brother Isaac oh or Keith or or anyone in here rich or anyone don't you understand it's not that I'm mistreating them I'm doing it unto Christ and for every sin there's a just recompense Oh somebody's God why am I going through this examine yourself and see whether you be in the faith where have we gotten off I'll tell you what we've gotten off we've gotten off with our attitudes we come in here like we are doing a service to God into his gates with Thanksgiving interest cars with praise and we come in here I thought to myself it's just a funeral service well as everybody dragging in here and then why is everybody even so sad and you wearing wore out hallelujah you got to come in here even when you don't feel like it and give him a sacrifice of praise hallelujah why because you have a revelation that the devil cannot stop the grace of God you have a revelation that God in you is going to complete the work in you and you have a revelation by God's grace that I am so justified see that's the revelation of this word and if you can believe these things and work with it you will be a happy camper hallelujah the devil loves to see your smiles turn into frowns hmm he comes to take that gentle nature from you y'all remember when you first met God how sweet you us every day you heard the angel singing huh hardly nothing could good next to you huh you couldn't help but tell somebody about Jesus hallelujah now the devil got us in in a condition a lot of us not all of us but some of us a war was me a brother said that the other day he said brother I'm working so much he says um I'm living the dream you see what I'm saying the dream is so beautiful after all hey and you gotta work did you know working like we work is a curse it came by the fall that because this you working you gonna sweat you got a job and you a blessed child of God listen you are blessed child of God you're not ordained he meant to just continually work in a place that makes you sweat now you say brother Brooks you better explain that word to me cuz it shows up joseph was chosen of God and when he was in prison he had to sweat he had to fulfill the curse don't come on somebody but God didn't let him stay there and we have the anointing of Joseph and Joshua you can do better God can give you better but you gotta believe that the world is on your side no job is supposed to have you in prison because he only strongly said free is free indeed but you gotta ask God he said if you ask him and believe that you shall receive it it will be given to you don't tell me it can't happen I remember when I was a young kid Mary and everything else and I drove one of those cars but one of those kind but it got me from A to B I was scared to go to C though but it got me to where I needed to go and you know B listen I didn't have to ask the manager nothing when you live right with God God live right for God God will make the boss favor you oh come on somebody the owner of the company came out there and he said at the eason who caused that out there and he's got to stop the car I say that's mine he said all know you can't park that in the front of my building man fact I gotta do something for you hypnotism that man gave me a $30,000 increase as my wife bought my first house and the first new car promoted me didn't even have to ask for it Oh somebody help me here don't tell me when you are in the favor of God that God won't exalt you the Bible said if you Harbor yourself not talking about election now tell me somebody whoever in the Bible that was elected and when God found him he did not leave them until they were exalted hmm hello you can go we have for one from the prostitute or a princess y'all hear me I'll think about it look at Jacob a shyster get no one everybody running he had to go through that sweating period he had to work for his father at all 14 years but that's not where God left him before he knew it that old Jacob became a prince and all he had to do was wrassle with the angel look at her Desa a common girl but because she live righteously before God God took her from a common house and put her into a palace if you don't have no faith to believe it you won't get it you know you say but I believe when you the bride of Jesus Christ God will transition you and take you from glory to glory to glory I ain't nothing that's a good thing to say but when it comes a God wants to do something for you you need to let go and let God oh I can't do that you can do all things all things through Christ who strengthens you hallelujah glory to God remember I told you when God gives you a job and that made comes to fire you you need to ask him did God tell you to do that put some fear in him so I know God get y'all don't tell cup for yourself see that's why you get fired but you need to say God gave me this job and if God gave me this job you better be careful you listen because it is it ain't gonna make no difference if he gonna fire you fire so but you need to put some God in there we leave God out of the equation then you kept God in the equation hallelujah and look what God did for Daniel you must keep God in the equation you predestinated no matter who you are if you are promised a janitor whatever if God want to raise you up he can do it but you got to know I'm chosen and God gives a thirst in your heart to do something different what do you think the thirst came from it comes from God and nothing no weapon formed against you shall prosper am I just kind of my mind I just believe that I'm chosen by God and I believe at the end of the day my enemy will be my footstool that's the word I came you came in this age so that God could manifest himself in you to bring your enemy under your feet and ain't what I do is Who I am Oh what about it's not about that it's Who I am you know David understood all the mistakes she did you know what David said his mercy endures forever David said his mercy is renewed every morning great is thy faithfulness it's not your faithfulness is his faithfulness but once you come to a place that you have recognized God is being God and you know who you are hmm live like a king son did you know that election is grace it is election is up grace hallelujah because you weren't in some kind of contest before God it says well Lord you know if I go down to Laodicea I'll be able to do it just just like you want me to do it you know you weren't in like some kind of fashion show oh no God saw something and you want you know what I know what you know what he's all right he saw himself in you hallelujah don't you understand God one day wanted to be a carpenter so he made you a cop in town Oh Lord God wanted some day to be a housewife so he made you a housewife oh come on that's why we supposed to live holy and godly no matter what position we're in did y'all know that if you live godly on your jobs that your jobs will flourish and then because of its flourishing you will - is that right no matter what Joseph put his hand to it prospered and because it prospered Joseph prospered y'all believe that I believe I believe that how many got no it's the truth you're going a restaurant ain't nobody there as soon as you come in there everything floods in grocery store you go to the counter nobody's there look behind your whole lot of people because you're blessed and everywhere you go it becomes blessed you don't even see it but if you care in the right atmosphere you'll you're like light in the darkness hallelujah and how you walk amen every bit of darkness has to separate itself from you because you're the light of the world I'm preaching something that's not in my notes but I want you to understand who you are and because you have been chosen and elected of God you do not have to back down off the devil he is defeated and it was your daddy who did it all you got to say devil you better remember daddy my daddy the delegate be redeem you know that like I was saying is Wednesday I said remember now when Satan when Ellen he failed Jesus God or the voice of God however you want to put him when when the voice of God walked in the cooler evening the voice of God went to Adam and Eve the serpent was in the background right he brought the bloody coats a man to Adam and Eve he never gave one to the serpent the serpent will never see the power of the blood whew somebody help me hey man the serpent will never see Calvary in the light that it should be seen in hallelujah people say well you know we don't need that oh bloody mess no more I need it like I said the other day the blood is the only thing that can hide you from God it is veils you when God doesn't see you he sees the blood and when I see the blood I'll pass over you not what I see you is when I see the blood I'll pass over you that's why the devil do not want you to get the Holy Ghost word Holy Ghost y'all hear what I'm saying you got to have the Holy Ghost to make a rapture hallelujah I'm not talking about an intellectual Holy Ghost I'm talking about Holy Ghost that changes your nature answer your faith virtue knowledge temperance bring you into the full statue of Christ that kind of the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost amen that may she was slave for Jesus Paul call it a prisoner for Christ hallelujah even makes you different from everybody else oh that's just it's just a fun Nanak she don't have to do all that look at that brother you know every time he's talking he's talking about Jesus what else is there to talk about hallelujah don't they make you sick with all the dirty jokes and filthiness make them sick with Jesus make him roll him hallelujah is that all right I know some of y'all don't like Cologne and some of y'all don't like perfume but you know there are some things I like hello now you might think this out of place but you know I've worked in places and and you know all of a sudden of a female comes up and and that that Cologne a perfume is really nice and you know what I look around and I first led a normal Christian and I said well what kind of I asked him for me now I want my wife to wear that hallelujah and she does and she likes it Oh y'all y'all you see let me tell you something you say those perfumes got spyridon with cast the devil out of them you do it with your food perfume ain't evil maybe they what they do with it at the beginning but God was the one who brought perfume in Israel was the sweetest smelling people ever it was the eases that we're stinking hell about it but Israel was a clean nation they had to wash they had to sanctify themselves and perfume themselves you know they couldn't even come into the presence of God without washing up is that right listen it makes no sense God told him sanctify yourself before I let you cross the muddy Jordan if this okay it's simple but I'm gonna tell you something I learned and I have learned that we have been receiving such an intellectual riddle revelation in this message and all this has been producing is division but you get somebody and bring them to Calvary and let them get a real baptism of the Holy Ghost y'all yummy it'll make them love the enemy y'all hear them saying it'll stop all the fussing and the problem is I'm not saying that we don't have the Holy Ghost but some of us have grieved God and he's up here and you wondering what's wrong with my life why is it so chaotic it's because you have done something that caused that Holy Spirit to be grieved now I don't have to wonder what it is you know what it is and you know that you're gonna have to repent to get him back hello it doesn't mean you're lost because God will make you repent hallelujah the Bible said eat I'm almost done election hath obtained it that means election got it election made it write it election possessed it if you are if you are elected no matter what condition you are in now it's going to make it happen think about it you know I think about Rahab excuse me no it's not Rahab but we want to talk about I think about Tom when when Israel was going through this hardship and he went down to Moab right and and and and they didn't even know what what was going on but you know they only was elected she was chosen God wanted to write some script and had written some script but she didn't know she was in the book yet but God sent her through our time of sweating and tears and crying and a season of hardship you and I must go through it there's no way around it you got to suffer the Bible said that Jesus learned his obedience do the things in which he suffered see because when you suffering that's when the devil say you don't have to do this you know you hear is you trying to serve God and you going through all those suffering man go do what you won't go get you a beer I hope I'm just not talking to somebody you know the devil tell you no go get something man you need to feel good relax let off the pressure but don't you realize it man that is the devil talking you and I must understand but when you are under pressure and everything is going wrong and you still can hold your holiness you still can continue to be sanctified you still can be pure before God and then that's when God smiles on you LR is that Alright when Joseph knew he had a vision and a dream he knew what God had said about him and all of his life looked like it was chaotic and when he thought he was doing good here comes part of his wife y'all think you're gonna listen let me tell you something every time you make a step forward Satan is waiting for you he's dare to take keep you there or to make you go backwards you will get rid of him until we're in glory oh I was that devil leave me alone he's faithful Satan is he's gonna torment you cuz he's a domina how many y'all going to agree amen the greatest battle ever fought is in your mind you think the prophet of God when he spoke that he was just trying to find a subject to preach God showed him that in this day the greatest battle ever fought is gonna be in your lying what is it what I do good or will I do evil constantly fighting against the wealth the demonic power of this age oh let me read this in and I read this last service I I was here just a moment so I want you to read this i'ma read this coming from the second coming and then i'ma closing just a bit I know I'm keeping you a little longer than normal all the sins of all the ages is settling down into this generation of people that we live in now all the weaknesses from our fathers of inbred traditions is fell in sicknesses and diseases and breaking out like has never been known in all the world all all of the weaknesses all of the sin everything that have come before us is now settling in this age see what you battling against how on earth are you going to overcome without the Holy Ghost hallelujah you living right and Here Come a generation of sin attacking your children hello what you gonna do about it you got to know that no matter what it is not to put it's not to stay you must pray against that but it doesn't mean it's not gonna come all of the weakness I don't know what I'm talking about when I look at my children I see my sisters and my brothers my cousins and everybody living in them and without the Holy Ghost they're gonna live in you too but listen if the devil is pouring out all of his evils what is God doing there's an outpouring for you but you gotta change your nature you gotta say Lord not my will but thine be done you've got to get to a place where you humble yourself and said fought God strip me of all my rights yeah you know a lamb is shared by the shepherd to that lamb is completely naked and that's what we must do let God shear us of all from all our little ideas our thoughts are those rights and all the things that we think we we should have a hold on to let me tell you something you you when you came to Christ you you sir supposed to have surrendered all and that's why a lot of people don't get the Holy Ghost because they don't surrender all hello now and then I believe that Satan which was prophesied would go with like a roaring lion in the last day to destroy mortal life spiritual life and everything that he could I believe that if if he's all dumping all of his evil y'all know what dump is that means to take it all and just do dump it it's not a sprinkling it's a dumping that's why sometimes you seem like you're bout to lose your mind you know maybe some of y'all don't go through battles like that because y'all so sanctified and holy y'all come up in here like you're all guy got it all together and I know better well cuz we still in the flesh we still flesh Barrow's hallelujah hallelujah don't act like you got it together when you need mercy you need my when you need grace you need grace we are here because we all are needed people suppose we come up in here Leon you don't want everybody to feel like you've been living you know with angels singing and playing up the hearts been all day every day no you're gonna battle in this day you gonna have some hardships you gonna have some pain unexpectedly hallelujah everything is poured into this age you gonna go through some jokes periences is that right even when one battle is over here come another Here Come another here come another and one is washed in the other and sometimes he said loud hallelujah but joke kept his integrity Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away blessed be the name of the Lord in other words Oh didn't go to church with a sad countenance he went there to worship and the praise God in spite of it all and when his friends turned against him he said wild I know one thing I know my Redeemer liveth see job understood his frailties that's why he offered up sacrifices unto the Lord and when you know your frailty that's when you offer up sacrifices unto the Lord Lord I think your lord I praise you you give God the glory you offer up spiritual sacrifices with your lips not cursings that's why you be careful on what proceeding out of your mouth right all that negative stuff coming out of your mouth is influencing your own atmosphere it is the very thing that's hindering your prayer hello I'm almost done if y'all want to I don't know how he's gonna minister this evening but I know it's gonna be good I'll be in your seat two of you not here is that okay I want you to realize that I'm closing I went in a different direction but somebody need what's being said because we are full of so much stuff that when we get before God we feel nothing and we know God ain't feelings but it's bad when you don't feel nothing and you know that you're not in a place to feel nothing anything rather and what's going to happen you and I must clean out the flues we got too much stuff blocking the Spirit of God believe you elected believe that God chosen you I don't care what you're going through don't believe the devil's lie like you're gonna miss the rapture now don't believe it don't believe it that God God don't care look what I'm going through God does care he cares for you he he want to see you as an overcomer because that's what paul said I'm the inspiration we're more than conquerors and that's what you gotta believe it I don't care like they said if that cat was running after that little mouse is that right and that little mouse a man was running any tripped up in on the table and fell into a glass of wine he fell in that wine he got a little stimulated he slid out of that glass where is that cat and I think that's what we need to do we need some stimulation to make take the fear way of the cat hallelujah you know we're two of them aus or rat amen the cat is the monster but you need to reverse that hallelujah you need to make that cat know if there is a monster you are the monster to the cat I can't fix your problems only God can fix them until you learn that you understand what I'm saying I am a pastor I try to lead and the way God wants me to leave lead but when it comes to problem solving he's the problem solver when it comes to fixing prob cuz he God can even fix your problem if you don't believe he can fix it is that right I'm a closed on this he said to marry him you know lazarus' not dead he sleeps and if you can believe it I'm going to show you the resurrection why because I am the resurrection and this is what people don't understand that's why devil put situations in your life and it looked like it's impossible for God to undo it now how you gonna get out of the grave if God can't heal you how do you think of resurrection that's going to occur if you can't have the faith to believe that God can heal hello you gotta believe God can do that before you can get up he told Mary Martha knew better than seeing God Jesus Christ do all kind of miracles but this one thing they had never seen Jesus Christ raised the dead that has been dead for days for days how many of your situations look like they dead rotted and stinking and you there says see it's dead you know there's impossible for any good thing to come out of it well let me say it like this you got to die before anything good come out of you so you got to understand him and all things are possible to them that believe but if you don't believe where God don't work the way he used to you just told you just made God a liar the Bible said Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever I don't even need no Matt no man to lay his head on me you don't need me to lay up my hand on you when God heals which he has already God delivers which he has already 2000 years ago he delivered you 2,000 years ago He healed you hallelujah 2,000 years ago amen he died that you might have joy but you'll never get healed or delivered until you believe it's for you salvation must come that way as well so shall they fear the name of the Lord from the West and his glory from the rising of the Sun when the enemy comes in like a flood the Spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him three weeks ago four weeks ago how long ever been if God had not moved on my wife to call it at the ambulance I would have been dead more than likely because they gave me an injection in my eyes this eye right here and the injection I had allergic reaction to it shot my blood pressure up to 204 for 147 they couldn't get it down they gave me about five nitroglycerin pills one after another and they wouldn't even move I didn't I don't fear death because when God saved me he took that from me but the pain oh my god I had never in my life experienced pain like that let me tell you something when pain come and it's so bad all you want is release you almost sign your house away just to get it undone you really y'all know what I'm trying to say it was the worst I had my arms my I thought I was having a heart attack but all of the pain was in my back and I asked the nurse I said can that be she said yeah say instead of being in the front it can be in the back and it was just like I thought I was gonna explode I can't explain it all I know is the pressure level was beyond the pain level was beyond anything that I had ever previously registered and it was so bad like I said had not my wife I couldn't sit down I couldn't do nothing there was and and and I couldn't even you know you know it's bad when your pain is so hard you can't even cry no tears nothing you just gotta bear it but my god came in and when I left that hospital they they couldn't say well we can't add none to your medication because you don't need no new medication your record they asked me what gave me such a thin sheet we don't have nothing you're perfectly well yeah well the perfectly healthy the doctor said there's nothing there my cholesterol wasn't high you know what I'm saying God worked a miracle you know how he worked that miracle because people were praying my wife calling me they got on the 911 that's what happened i'ma tell you Satan wanted to take me and God said no that's what prayer does prayer will shake the walls hallelujah Peter J McDonald locked up in the prison they went yeah yeah but then all of them went to praying and shoot the jailhouse that's what I'm but you see they had the right nature they had something that God could come down and unite with that's the thing when your nature is not what God he can't come down and unite with you it's gotta be I live in a dog it's gotta be compatible when you get right with God God will answer your prayer but if God you've got the devil got you always upset always fired up you know all of that forget it he's defeating you and he's got a bigger bomb ready for you down the road hallelujah you know I look at my daughter now you know the way she'd gone I said to the Lord I said that's my fault had I been spiritual enough had I been doing the right things y'all understand me see you got to walk right with God Satan when Satan comes and he just come to your house amen and just play with you like a boss of the cat a cat with a mouse you know Lee when that happens something's not right you got to examine something here come on somebody I'm not afraid but whatever I can do to undo that it's done what is it always anxious always going through so much people got your own edge and the nature of God is gone hello a pastor goes through it he's human I worry about things I shouldn't be worried about that's why this I was bleeding in the back thinking I'm all right and stress is eating me up come on somebody you came through you could try to fool semi-desert your body gonna talk to you am i ashamed yes because I thought I was connected but somewhere the connection was broken I said was broken I said was broken I had to go down last night was such a revival for me I had to go down memory lane and search out in my heart and says God forgive me Lord forgive me cleanse me Lord do this that and the other and he came on the scene now the devil is in trouble you want God to work for you you got a clean house you got to go through your heart and find out what's in there that's hindering the move of God because God wants to move for us People of God I'm telling you that's what the solution is it is what we have done not what God has done God has done everything he can for us but because we take the grace of God and misuse it we are having troubles and I'm going to tell you something when you let Satan in your house because you're not praying and reading your Bible and studying when he comes in he's like a man that he's gonna wreck your home hello he's a thief he's a robber and he had coming to your house and run havoc in there hallelujah you understand me I know what I'm talking about when I was a boy my house my momma sir partners was broken into and I came home from school and and and somebody had broken come in my house our house had broke our dishes and you know written all on our walls and ripped our couches up ripped our matches up had clothes everywhere and this net the other and in something as a little boy something say look in the closet and here I was trying to pull the closet door open and as I pull with something pulled back but I was too young and dumb to fear how to pull that door open and Here Come that the person who who did this to our house yeah we called the pod in call the police and my mom didn't call the police guess what it was an old friend who had become jealous of what God had blessed us with hello somebody but you see God will expose the devil I don't care how he tried to hide he can't hide from the bride of Jesus and you got to take inventory and you got to look within yourself and says Lord what have I done or what I've had I have not done how come the devil is it's moving in my life the way he's moving hello and if you can search yourself then God is ready to hear you repent he's here to serve you he's a right now God and God wants all of us to be on track don't think because Amen you've done all these things and you come short of the glory of God at this point in time I'm not elected no sir that's one thing the devil cannot deceive me on I don't care how long it take but before I get out of here I'm gonna be perfect just like he is I am already inside but I won't be inside to be manifested on the outside you love the Lord God is good to us amen just as I am please those of you who can make it out this evening you won't be disappointed I know the Lord had really really bless this is the first time that Craig had didn't preach for us on a Sunday and so therefore I thought it would be a blessing for the church down there and God knows what he preached last night I wish everybody could hear there the whole world my family everybody could have heard that message it was wonderful it's just perfect timing just watch it [Music] me too Oh [Music] [Music] - whose birthday cleanse each Oh God like [Music] just as I am the dolls are bad with me come with me [Music] five-o [Music] I am dead [Music] [Music] my eye [Music] Oh God [Music] to be like Jesus to be like you Oh [Music] [Music] this will be like walk like oh gee [Music] Oh Oh [Music] love like Jesus to love [Music] Oh [Music] you love the Lord to not like it to love like in all [Music] my [Music] No I want to say this morning we're living in dangerous times it's sad because no matter where you go you find the church really cool at all people who had what's a fire in a seal no longer have been fired we we don't even realize it's Satan Satan according to Daniel Obama said equal to we're of the same town and that's what's happening and you're the product you're allowing safe to do it it doesn't necessarily have to be for you I believe that God gave us the right armor for this battle and I believe by God's grace that we can show Satan in his own Eden that we are the conquerors I don't believe in submitting ourselves to his thoughts and his pressure and I believe that Paul said we're more than conquerors I believe that I've seen how God heal and delivered so many things so many people even myself what I'm gonna tell you what I'm after more than anything I want the very nature of Christ to live completely in me I'll not be satisfied with religion that's what brought me here because when I heard the word I saw that this word offered to me more than just religion and offered me life and I can tell you know I am NOT the kind of person I used to be I'm father of the road but I want to see the completion of Christ I want to see a divine love because you know the Bible says you can have faith to move mountains you have money to you enough money to feed the poor you can even give your body to be burned and don't you know Christians are doing it but they don't have divine law and the Bible says that's your covenant divine love every age produce what they were supposed to do that right Ephesian was a church age of faith is that right and they each age and you and I we will not you know how people die says well you know well we innocently their brother kind of we don't even have brotherly kindness there's a lot of us amen that's lacking brotherly kindness how are you going to explain if you want and you know what it ain't God is you you're the one who's refusing to let God make love to you because if you let God make love to you and woo you he will break you on down he'll make you a person that can let someone scream and howl at you and you can love them anyway don't you ever think that you're gonna make heaven without the blood producing Christ the blood must be manifested the life of Christ must be manifested in you now oh I believe God sent a prophet understand millions died in the wilderness because they believed God sent prophet they missed the pillar of fire they missed the Christ Joshua and Caleb saw the Christ they knew it wasn't Moses it was the power behind him and that's what you and I must have we must have the power behind oh yes gosh in a prophet but he was only a prophet cuz God made him woman he never did one miracle it was God in him you and I must understand by God's grace he came to show us that that's saying God can live in us this ain't no one-man thing this is a body thing and you know what even down in and I said I down in in our Iowa City that we got a sister when she comes in she sits back in her chair like that and she chews her gum just disrespectful not to me she can pop it and blow it if she wanted but what kind of thing in that is in the presence of God and you got the Holy Ghost people come in church they cross their legs like they're in a social club what respect is that you know I don't understand it because I am i'ma tell you y'all listening hear my voice cuz the same voice if you don't listen will torment you if you miss it because I know what I'm saying we got respect God if you want something from God you got to be obedient you got to come in and do what God wants you to do you can't just come in here and have your own way and think you could just enter the house of God in a kind of way and it's gonna be accepted that's why so many of us leave out here the same way we came in don't blame the preacher it's your approach you approach God the wrong way you won't get nothing my mother was an illiterate woman couldn't read or write but she knew how to pro approach God and God blessed her with the Holy Spirit think how much you will know intelligence and all that and you know all these mysteries now people are so mystery there so they just mysterious they just I can't even say the word but may God help us all because I'm gonna tell you something you do not want to wake up one day and find out that you have been deceived that's the worst thing that can happen to a Christian so [Music] there's nothing too hard for God all that we come before you and we pray for our system Lord you made you know everything that works and things that don't work you raised a man from the dead that have been dead for teens rod it's thinking and here is our sister Lord Jesus faithfully comes to church only Lord read your word and studies with her husband it's been a mere picture of your bride Lord that's what she really is and father we don't deserve anything from you but we come humbly because your word said we can do it you said father we come before you approach your throne Lord believing that we shall have what we asked for touching and agreeing father I touch and agree Lord with our brother Connelly Lord Lord and we pray right
