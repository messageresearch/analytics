[0:00] cup there's nothing like drinking out of
[0:03] a dirty glass
[0:04] or cup so if god is going to use you he
[0:08] wants the inside cleansed
[0:10] and therefore if the inside is cleansed
[0:12] the outside is going to take care of
[0:14] itself
[0:16] amen this morning we showed you about
[0:18] the two trees
[0:20] we showed you how it was in the
[0:22] beginning
[0:23] and when god made uh nature or created
[0:26] nature nature he
[0:28] he created male and female and believe
[0:32] it you would not
[0:33] believe it or not it also uh
[0:36] this also applied to trees
[0:39] flowers everything
[0:42] male and female it was showing god's
[0:45] nature
[0:46] we talked about this morning where god
[0:48] wants to restore
[0:50] us where god wants where we're headed we
[0:52] must have a vision the bible says
[0:54] without a vision of people perish you
[0:57] see and you can't have a vision without
[0:59] a prophet
[1:00] amen because it's that prophet who's
[1:02] ordained
[1:03] to bring the vision to the people so
[1:06] let us read genesis 3 and 9
[1:11] and the lord god
[1:16] and the lord god called unto adam
[1:20] and said unto him where
[1:23] art thou
[1:26] let us pray heavenly father we thank you
[1:29] for your grace and your mercy
[1:32] we thank you for being so good to us
[1:36] we thank you lord for being our all in
[1:38] all and we appreciate everything that
[1:40] you have done for us
[1:42] and everything that you are doing for us
[1:45] it's so wonderful lord to know that you
[1:48] are eternal
[1:50] you are a god that cannot die
[1:54] you are the alpha and the omega the
[1:57] beginning and the end
[1:59] a god who had no beginning and has no
[2:01] ending
[2:03] we don't have to worry about the work
[2:07] not being
[2:08] completed because you completed this
[2:12] work before the foundation of the world
[2:15] and the bible tells us that you placed
[2:17] our names
[2:18] in the lamb's book of life before
[2:22] the world began for this we thank you
[2:25] lord
[2:27] because we realize oh god you master of
[2:29] the universe
[2:31] you are the sweet eternity
[2:35] that we're looking forward to spending
[2:37] with
[2:39] bless the service bless the peoples
[2:42] hearts and minds
[2:44] god give us what we stand in need of and
[2:47] we'll be careful to give you the praise
[2:49] glory and honor
[2:50] in jesus christ's name we pray amen
[2:54] you may be seated one of the things that
[2:56] i learned
[2:57] and heard by way of listening to
[3:01] [Music]
[3:02] the restoration of the bride tree
[3:07] uh brother branham began to tell us that
[3:09] there is
[3:11] a law or there are laws
[3:14] that uh make things work the way they
[3:17] work
[3:20] there is a law that the fish uses
[3:25] not consciously he is not at a drawing
[3:29] board
[3:30] trying to figure out the math to how to
[3:34] hold his breath as long as he does
[3:38] or how to swim to the top or sink to the
[3:41] bottom
[3:43] it's a law that's in his genetics
[3:46] or in his genes that seem to enforce
[3:52] the things that he needs to be done
[3:55] in order to survive
[3:58] uh and that is the same way with birds
[4:03] birds don't have to go to school to
[4:05] learn how to fly
[4:08] but they need to know how the law works
[4:13] and i don't know the bird language but
[4:14] i'm sure mama and daddy just
[4:17] knows how to tweet just right in order
[4:20] for that bird to understand
[4:22] that he must let go and let god
[4:26] because as long as the bird is afraid to
[4:28] fly
[4:30] he never will fly the reason being
[4:34] because he thinks
[4:35] flying is something that he really has
[4:38] to do and learn himself
[4:40] but the only thing that the bird has to
[4:42] learn is to let go
[4:44] and let god the element of flying
[4:47] is already in him the ability to do it
[4:51] is
[4:51] already in him he was born that way
[4:55] the burden itself could never be a fish
[4:58] and the fish could never be a bird
[5:00] because they are operating by two
[5:02] different laws
[5:04] so is it with every animal they have
[5:07] laws that they
[5:08] that are within them that god put in
[5:11] their nature
[5:12] and in that nature god operates in them
[5:15] to do and perform
[5:18] as he would uh according to his plan
[5:22] so is it with mankind when god created
[5:26] us
[5:27] we were under the law of life
[5:31] that's all we knew we didn't know evil
[5:35] we didn't know how to do evil it wasn't
[5:38] in our genes to do evil
[5:41] but we learn how to do evil
[5:45] by way of the knowledge the tree of the
[5:47] knowledge of good and evil
[5:49] now we know that when adam fell
[5:53] he because he was the amateur god of
[5:57] of the earth all of his kingdom all of
[6:00] his
[6:01] uh subjects were fallen to
[6:05] and you know that's how it is even in
[6:07] any battle
[6:08] if you can get to the king you have
[6:11] already
[6:12] destroyed the host and um you know
[6:15] that's how it was in the battle of the
[6:19] garden of eden
[6:20] when lucifer and uh in the form of a
[6:24] serpent
[6:25] uh fought and they battled in a
[6:28] spiritual way
[6:30] first of all and we find out that
[6:34] the the serpent won and of course this
[6:37] whole earth
[6:39] and his atmosphere became
[6:43] the property of the devil
[6:48] and that's why we wrestle now
[6:51] not against flesh and blood but we
[6:53] wrestle against
[6:54] principalities and powers kingdoms and
[6:58] rulers
[7:00] because of the fall satan has been able
[7:02] to
[7:04] take those demons that once was angel
[7:06] and
[7:07] give them territories where they can
[7:10] rule and reign
[7:12] but they rule and reign according to
[7:14] their own will
[7:16] yet and still god takes that will
[7:20] and work it toward our good now
[7:23] the bible according to joelle tells us
[7:26] that
[7:28] god promised to restore
[7:32] but before i go there i want to say that
[7:33] here in the beginning when
[7:35] god was questioning adam adam
[7:38] where art thou and that's basically the
[7:41] question
[7:43] that every sinner or every man should
[7:46] always
[7:48] answer you need to know where you are
[7:52] and adam a man knew that he wasn't in
[7:55] the same place he was
[7:58] before the fall he understood that
[8:01] something drastically had happened
[8:04] and now he's experiencing the absence
[8:07] of god now we didn't know
[8:10] what that felt like until we saw the
[8:13] second adam
[8:15] when he was on the cross and god had
[8:18] separated himself from him
[8:21] brother bannon said that that that was a
[8:23] time that was really
[8:24] hard for him because he had never been
[8:26] out of the presence of god
[8:29] but he became our sin that we might
[8:32] become
[8:33] the righteousness of god and so god
[8:36] could not fellowship with darkness god
[8:38] could not
[8:38] fellowship with sin even though his son
[8:41] jesus
[8:42] was made sin he separated himself
[8:47] and there jesus died as a man
[8:50] and he cried out and he cried out with
[8:53] anguish
[8:56] my god my god
[8:59] why hast thou forsaken me
[9:02] you see in this term
[9:06] god forsook adam but in the beginning
[9:10] the first adam forsook god
[9:13] but you see they had fallen
[9:18] one fell because of the flesh
[9:22] and the other one surrendered
[9:25] amen because of the sin that the first
[9:28] adam
[9:29] committed now we are at a place when you
[9:33] say restore what do you mean
[9:36] god's word cannot come back void and i
[9:39] know you hear me say this all the time
[9:42] but the earth still need to be
[9:44] replenished
[9:46] the earth has never been replenished
[9:49] with the sons of god
[9:52] and when god gave adam the first adam
[9:55] that commandment or that word
[9:57] he wasn't talking about the serpents he
[10:00] was talking about replenishing the earth
[10:03] with sons of god those who would be
[10:07] in the very image and likeness of the
[10:09] first adam
[10:10] before the fall now it took the second
[10:14] adam to come along because
[10:15] the first album was was made earthly but
[10:18] the second adam was
[10:20] from heaven and the bible said the
[10:22] second adam
[10:23] was the very lord himself
[10:27] so god came down clothed himself in
[10:30] human flesh
[10:31] understand to restore us
[10:34] hallelujah see mankind
[10:38] will not uh they do not go to hell
[10:42] because of the sin they commit it's not
[10:44] because of murdering
[10:46] lying and thieving they go to hell
[10:49] because
[10:49] they refuse to accept the moment
[10:53] they refuse to accept the pardon
[10:56] hallelujah
[10:57] now think about it uh how god works
[11:01] uh god is always giving
[11:05] he gives when you're a sinner he gives
[11:07] when you're a saint
[11:08] he's the one that takes care of the
[11:10] whole thing
[11:12] and when it comes to restoring
[11:16] everybody likes that
[11:19] to be restored even as you grow older
[11:23] you wish you could be restored
[11:28] did i use that that you used to have
[11:32] amen we long for it we do all kinds of
[11:36] things
[11:37] wanting to be restored we take pills we
[11:39] use creams we
[11:40] do exercise we do everything but
[11:43] none of that works there's only one
[11:47] place or one way to be restored
[11:49] and that's by god no man can add a cubic
[11:52] or statute to himself
[11:55] even though we like to be mightier or
[11:57] greater uh
[11:59] it takes god he's the only one he's the
[12:02] creator he is
[12:03] the very life now
[12:06] when it comes to fellowship we
[12:07] understand according to
[12:09] the message but it wasn't so from the
[12:11] beginning
[12:13] brother branham said jesus he was
[12:14] crucified for our sins
[12:17] and raised for our justification then
[12:20] through his
[12:21] righteous blood we are cleansed
[12:24] that god could come into us and
[12:27] fellowship
[12:30] god making his own way back to
[12:32] fellowship with adam's children
[12:35] as he did with the adam before the fall
[12:39] now god made the way made his way back
[12:43] adam couldn't find his way he was lost
[12:46] think about what i'm saying here god
[12:48] took his time
[12:50] to make him make the way back for us
[12:54] right and we are redeemed
[12:57] from all the curse of the fall
[13:02] and now we have the earnest of our
[13:05] salvation
[13:06] i want you to really take take this at
[13:08] heart
[13:09] not just in your mind we are redeemed
[13:13] from all the curse of the thought
[13:17] now if we are redeemed from all of the
[13:20] curse of the fall
[13:21] that means every sickness every ailment
[13:25] whether it be spiritual or whether it be
[13:28] natural
[13:29] is a lie amen amen
[13:32] hello and at some place in our lives
[13:36] we're going to find out that even old
[13:40] age is a lie
[13:44] there was no such thing as aging before
[13:47] the fall
[13:48] and i believe right in that revelation
[13:52] a translation is going to take place
[13:56] hallelujah because we're not supposed to
[13:59] be old
[14:00] we're not supposed to be crippled we're
[14:02] not supposed to be afflicted
[14:04] we're not supposed to have any of these
[14:06] things that were caused by
[14:08] sin hallelujah
[14:12] but the trouble is that we always have a
[14:15] tendency
[14:16] to lean to our own understanding
[14:20] that's the affliction of the fall
[14:24] your reasoning your thinking
[14:27] to make you the devil make you think you
[14:30] have a right to think
[14:32] when it comes to the word of god but
[14:34] when it comes to the word of god
[14:36] you have no thought coming amen
[14:40] the prophet god said it like this i
[14:42] trust that the church will understand
[14:44] this
[14:45] that we have no right to use our own
[14:48] thinking about things
[14:52] i'm going to read that one again i trust
[14:55] that the church will understand
[14:57] this that we have no right to use our
[15:00] own
[15:00] thinking about things when we become
[15:03] christians we totally surrender every
[15:06] bit of our mental power to god
[15:09] and follow after his leading amen as
[15:12] long as we try to go after our own
[15:15] feelings
[15:16] then we are using the fallen state of
[15:20] the being
[15:20] [Applause]
[15:22] amen hello think about it
[15:26] i told you just a week or so ago it was
[15:29] when
[15:30] when the devil made eve think
[15:33] she had a thought her reasoning
[15:37] right that ability of her will
[15:41] and she chose her will over god's will
[15:45] that's what your thinking does it causes
[15:48] you to take your will
[15:49] over god's will seek god because
[15:53] listen he said and as long as we try to
[15:56] go after our own
[15:57] feelings then we are using the fallen
[16:01] state of the being
[16:02] because god led adam before the fall
[16:06] and after the fall adam wanted to lead
[16:09] god
[16:10] that's why the bible says the children
[16:12] of god are those that are led by the
[16:14] spirit
[16:15] amen hallelujah not leading the spirit
[16:18] but led
[16:19] by the spirit now god provided adam away
[16:23] but he didn't want that way he wanted to
[16:26] make himself a religion
[16:28] and as we see that he wanted to do it
[16:31] himself
[16:32] he wasn't willing to wait on god and say
[16:35] lord
[16:36] you led me before this and now
[16:39] i'm fallen i'm lost now help me
[16:42] and show me how to get back to you lord
[16:45] he said we we or we would not have
[16:49] we wouldn't have never had all this
[16:52] trouble
[16:52] we've got today think about it all adam
[16:56] had to do was repent
[16:58] it would have changed the whole scene
[17:01] but he didn't
[17:03] because at that point in his life his
[17:06] will
[17:06] was in control and if a man would just
[17:09] come
[17:10] that close to god that when you're lost
[17:13] don't try to find your way back just
[17:16] surrender to him
[17:18] and he will lead you back don't try to
[17:21] figure it out
[17:22] that's the mental powers and that's what
[17:26] we do
[17:26] we try to figure it out and that's the
[17:29] mental how i'm gonna do this one plus
[17:31] one is two
[17:32] no no no no let go and let god
[17:37] hallelujah amen think about it people
[17:40] we're doing the same thing as a as a
[17:42] bird would do trying to
[17:44] mathematically or scientifically uh
[17:47] uh uh figure out how he fly
[17:51] you know all i know is that they enjoy
[17:53] it
[17:54] and one thing i love about the eagle the
[17:56] eagle learns how to take
[17:57] advantage of the nature hallelujah
[18:01] you don't hear you don't see an eagle
[18:03] flapping his wing till he just said
[18:05] i can't go any further no he learns how
[18:08] to catch the wind
[18:10] and that wind represents god he learns
[18:12] how to move into the spirit of god
[18:14] and let the spirit of god takes him as
[18:16] high as he can go
[18:19] and that's what we must learn how to do
[18:21] learn remember i told you this morning
[18:23] you got to learn how the law works
[18:27] in a christian and brother branham said
[18:30] it like this
[18:30] let go and let god amen hallelujah
[18:35] now we understand by god's grace amen
[18:38] that
[18:38] when the man fell he fell
[18:42] and he fell into his own system
[18:45] and as we described it some time ago he
[18:48] he fell into his own system of
[18:51] multiplying
[18:52] and this is why we had such overflow of
[18:56] people on the earth god wanted them to
[18:58] multiply
[18:59] but he never intended for the
[19:01] multiplying to be a problem
[19:03] but you got to understand even in
[19:05] science they said a man needs so much
[19:07] space
[19:09] in order to be in be sane
[19:12] and if you put him in such a close uh
[19:15] proximity amen is he's liable to lose
[19:18] his mind if
[19:19] it lasts too long for so long and y'all
[19:22] know how it is we
[19:23] with this covet we thought if we stay in
[19:25] the house another day
[19:28] or if we be confined to this math and
[19:31] mask another day
[19:34] sometimes i almost had anxiety attacks
[19:37] in those in those department stores
[19:40] just trying to breathe you see we we're
[19:43] not
[19:44] creatures like that we're not supposed
[19:46] to be that way we
[19:47] we we've been set free one of the things
[19:50] about the cowboy movies i used to love
[19:53] is when those horses when they were you
[19:56] know
[19:56] running and galloping you know you know
[19:59] in in
[20:00] in their herds and and just carefree and
[20:03] you know the the what they call the hair
[20:04] the mange you know
[20:06] just blowing in the wind and many times
[20:08] i could see myself
[20:11] carrying on like that now i'm a dreamer
[20:13] so that's okay
[20:14] so anyway you you see that's the kind of
[20:17] freedom
[20:18] i don't believe when we get to heaven
[20:20] amen we're going to see
[20:22] any restriction signs
[20:27] you know don't enter here don't you no
[20:29] no no
[20:30] we'll have such a mind where mine will
[20:33] be so connected
[20:34] with him he will know he won't have to
[20:36] say
[20:37] anything he will hear us according to
[20:40] isaiah the bible said here hear us
[20:43] before we even speak amen
[20:46] hallelujah you know what that means
[20:49] that's amazing to me
[20:51] that he can hear me before i speak now
[20:54] he's always been able to do that
[20:55] but there are going to be such a
[20:57] connection
[20:58] that when we need some how many times
[21:00] that happened to you even now
[21:02] you need it you never asked for it and
[21:04] you got it
[21:06] but he he caught your thought he knew
[21:08] your thought from afar off
[21:10] and you said you know how did you know
[21:12] how did this happen
[21:14] he heard you when you thought it and he
[21:17] blessed you with it
[21:18] and if that be the case what about when
[21:20] you ask him for it
[21:22] amen the church was in the first age
[21:25] already a fallen woman now we're talking
[21:28] about restoring
[21:30] and you understand that ah e typed out
[21:32] the church
[21:33] she had fallen right she was seduced
[21:36] and adam willfully sinned and what
[21:39] happened there
[21:40] amen we find out by god's grace god took
[21:42] a lamb
[21:43] slew the lamb amen as an atonement for
[21:46] them
[21:48] now we know that each jehovah had a
[21:50] bride jesus had a bride
[21:52] and brother branham tells us like before
[21:54] jesus can get to his
[21:56] own church his bride that the serpent
[22:00] the devil had already entered in and
[22:03] paul even says in corinthians he says
[22:06] you know
[22:07] uh you know it it it it behooves me
[22:11] you know i'm i'm afraid that even as
[22:14] the serpent beguiled eve you soon to be
[22:18] beguiled
[22:19] you know in other words he saw a spirit
[22:22] that was not of god a spirit that acted
[22:26] like christ but was not christ
[22:29] he called it the antichrist spirit
[22:31] because it was to take
[22:33] the church away from the word and bring
[22:36] them into a system
[22:38] and paul said amen that even before
[22:40] jesus could get to her
[22:42] she was already into a system and as
[22:45] satan had begotten eve before adam
[22:48] even now has satan seduced the church
[22:51] the bride of christ before the marriage
[22:53] supper of the lamb
[22:55] and what specifically was in her midst
[22:58] that caused the fall what but
[23:01] revelation 2 6 the deeds
[23:04] of the nicolaitans in other words
[23:08] another man's voice
[23:12] right because that's what happened in
[23:13] the garden of eden
[23:16] eve took on another man's voice
[23:20] instead of listening to her husband
[23:22] voice who which was adam
[23:24] who spoke the word of god she listened
[23:27] to the serpent
[23:28] and the serpent was an upright creature
[23:31] like a man
[23:32] right we know these things amen already
[23:36] see the deeds of the nicolaitans already
[23:38] that first age had turned from following
[23:41] the pure word of god
[23:42] they turned from god demand of a church
[23:45] absolutely dependent upon him depending
[23:49] entirely
[23:50] upon god to fulfill his word
[23:53] from from start to finish apart from
[23:56] human government
[23:57] you say what weather's had happened
[23:58] before yes
[24:00] the same thing happened to israel when
[24:03] they had samuel
[24:05] they were a real ephesian church they
[24:07] had a prophet
[24:08] amen and the word of god came and samuel
[24:11] never asked him for
[24:12] anything i mean he it was just amazing
[24:14] he just delivered the word of god
[24:16] they were free but what did they do they
[24:18] saw the neighboring churches
[24:21] they saw and looked around them and said
[24:24] we
[24:24] want a king and listen
[24:27] samuel took it personally and god said
[24:30] don't take it personally samuel
[24:32] they did not reject you they rejected me
[24:36] now let them know now when they get this
[24:38] nicolaitan
[24:41] when they get this king i want you to
[24:43] know amen what he's going to do he's
[24:46] going to use this
[24:47] their sons and their daughters and he's
[24:48] going to put them in slavery
[24:51] right he's going to give them a hard
[24:54] time
[24:55] guess what the people say okay
[24:58] but we still want a king
[25:01] now that's crazy to me right
[25:05] i mean but that's exactly where the
[25:06] church ages went to
[25:09] paul said beware of these people beware
[25:12] of the false brethren
[25:14] paul said you will allow them to slap
[25:16] you
[25:17] and still serve them paul says listen
[25:20] i'm trying to tell you
[25:21] that this thing that comes in the name
[25:22] of jesus christ is not christ
[25:25] it's come to deceive you now we didn't
[25:28] know
[25:28] throughout the church ages until the
[25:31] seals were open
[25:33] until the first seal came and we thought
[25:35] we saw this white horse
[25:37] that throughout the ages historians
[25:39] thought it was jesus
[25:41] and then we come to find out it was not
[25:44] it was the antichrist spirit
[25:46] posing as the word of god
[25:49] and listen it deceived the people
[25:52] and throughout the ages as it continued
[25:55] to deceive the people
[25:57] it changed horses hallelujah
[26:01] or the color of the horse same horse but
[26:03] a different ministry
[26:05] hallelujah and that horse at the end
[26:08] became a a
[26:10] horse that was a mixed horse and it had
[26:13] on it
[26:14] death see the breaking of the word is
[26:17] going to always lead to death
[26:20] and understand amen when it comes in it
[26:22] comes like
[26:23] like like that paul and the rest of this
[26:25] apostle says it comes in like an angel
[26:28] of light
[26:29] like a great revelation hallelujah
[26:33] but if you don't stay with the word of
[26:35] god
[26:36] amen you'll never be restored
[26:39] hallelujah it always comes in with a
[26:41] system touch not taste not hand a lot
[26:44] see what i'm saying but a true seed of
[26:46] god
[26:47] when they're born again is the holy
[26:50] spirit
[26:51] that leads them and guide them into all
[26:53] truth
[26:55] hallelujah there were certain things no
[26:57] man had to teach me
[27:00] the holy spirit taught me don't get me
[27:02] wrong
[27:03] god has teach us but he's the teacher of
[27:06] the teacher
[27:07] he will tell you he is the amen how many
[27:10] times you've heard preacher come in here
[27:12] and preach the word of god you know it's
[27:14] true and you never heard it before but
[27:16] something comes out and says amen why
[27:19] it's because god
[27:21] knows his word and he's going to always
[27:24] amen his word and so he puts the amen
[27:26] like i said the amen put the amen in you
[27:29] so you can
[27:30] amen all right so we're at this place
[27:33] and and here brother branham uses a
[27:35] message
[27:36] a scripture coming out of jesus 20 one
[27:39] through seven
[27:41] and i'm going to read it and abraham
[27:44] journey from this toward the south
[27:46] country
[27:47] and dwelt between kadesh sher and
[27:49] sergeant and gyro
[27:51] and abraham said of to sarah's wife she
[27:54] is my sister
[27:55] an abimelech king of gareth sent and
[27:57] took sarah
[27:58] what was happening here first of all
[28:00] abraham had no beingness being where he
[28:03] was
[28:04] he was he was going on in a place where
[28:06] god said don't go
[28:07] he went anyway yes no does it sound
[28:10] familiar
[28:14] abraham used his own will
[28:17] his own will got him in trouble and he
[28:20] goes to this egyptian king
[28:22] right abimelech sees now watch this now
[28:25] because
[28:26] this is after a transformation
[28:30] abraham and sarah is no longer
[28:34] abram or sarai they have been
[28:37] physically changed to a young man and a
[28:40] young woman
[28:41] and they go down there and this king
[28:44] looking through the window
[28:46] seeing this man riding with this
[28:48] beautiful woman
[28:49] she had to be beautiful because this
[28:51] king had already a heron
[28:53] and evidently she outshined whatever he
[28:55] had
[28:56] and he says oh my i gotta have her
[29:00] right not knowing abraham
[29:06] weak in his flesh
[29:10] you know he had to know he wasn't
[29:11] supposed to tell his wife
[29:13] what he told her tell her
[29:16] tell the king you're my sister
[29:20] cause if you don't he's gonna kill me
[29:22] and he's gonna marry you
[29:25] i still want to talk to abraham when i
[29:27] get there i want
[29:28] i don't want to talk to him what was in
[29:30] your mind you did that
[29:32] i know you was afraid but come on bro i
[29:35] shouldn't have said it like that but
[29:36] come on brother
[29:40] hey i still that still gets me it still
[29:42] gets me
[29:43] but nevertheless let's go on by the
[29:45] grace of god
[29:46] god intervened don't you
[29:50] understand when satan is there to take
[29:53] you out spiritually
[29:54] see the devil has boundaries he can't
[29:58] cross up
[29:59] he can't cross you up is that right
[30:02] and brother said once you come into
[30:04] christ and that seed germ comes and
[30:06] it's quickened he said god closes the
[30:09] womb
[30:09] he seals it up no other man can enter in
[30:14] no other doctrine nothing that can
[30:15] defile the wound or the
[30:17] other or the pregnation that you have
[30:19] nothing can stop it
[30:22] god will intervene and god told
[30:25] abimelech like listen here
[30:26] by way of dream that that's my servant
[30:29] he's a prophet
[30:30] and that's his wife don't you touch her
[30:32] you better return
[30:33] and abimelech says lord you know i'm a
[30:35] righteous man god said yes i know
[30:37] you are a righteous man that's why i
[30:39] came to help save you
[30:43] and if you want this thing to follow
[30:46] through
[30:47] not only i want you to give abraham
[30:50] his wife back but i want you to give him
[30:52] so many so many of this and so much of
[30:54] this
[30:55] and so much i want you to pay him for
[30:57] lying to you
[31:01] because that's what abraham did abraham
[31:03] lied to him
[31:04] i want to pray you know i still don't
[31:06] get i don't you know
[31:07] but you got to understand abraham had an
[31:09] unconditional covenant
[31:11] in the eyes of god abraham was still
[31:13] pure
[31:14] you know what i'm saying he did god
[31:15] didn't see his faults
[31:17] but he covered them he covered them
[31:21] hallelujah and abraham left gorilla
[31:26] far more a rich man far richer than he
[31:28] was when he first entered in
[31:31] don't you see that that every true trial
[31:35] makes you richer amen
[31:38] and closer to god than you were before
[31:41] you started
[31:43] hallelujah and guess what the god will
[31:46] even make the devil bless you
[31:48] amen amen
[31:52] hallelujah yes hallelujah and so you say
[31:56] what do you mean
[31:57] he uses the same passage of scripture
[32:02] in restoration of the bride tree
[32:06] telling us that god is going to restore
[32:10] you
[32:11] even though you have come into a
[32:13] position of egypt
[32:15] where it it it appears that you're not
[32:19] abraham's wife but nothing can change
[32:22] that
[32:23] you are the bride of jesus christ
[32:27] and though we walk in this egyptian
[32:30] territory
[32:31] god has already set a law amen y'all
[32:34] understand me
[32:35] touch not amen do not
[32:40] write do my prophets no harm
[32:43] touch not my anointed y'all understand
[32:47] me
[32:47] that's not just for a preacher or a
[32:50] prophet
[32:51] that for every saint of god that's been
[32:54] blood washed
[32:55] and united with christ huh the mystery
[32:59] of this whole thing
[33:00] and this is what has been heard from the
[33:01] first from the beginning of the year
[33:03] of the ages the mystery that was hidden
[33:06] from not only the jews but
[33:07] hidden from the gentiles the gentiles
[33:10] always looked like
[33:11] dogs they were called dogs right
[33:13] remember the time when that woman says
[33:15] lord
[33:16] you know have mercy on me and you know
[33:18] he he wouldn't even
[33:19] he not lord but he said thou son of
[33:21] david she said it first
[33:23] have mercy but she was a gentile amen
[33:26] she would
[33:26] he she would he was not a a son of david
[33:30] to her so
[33:30] you got to understand in order to give
[33:33] get god's attention
[33:34] your protocol must be correct
[33:37] hallelujah right he's not the son of
[33:41] david to us
[33:42] he's lord hallelujah and so
[33:46] when when it comes to him responding
[33:49] he couldn't respond until she said lord
[33:52] and then jesus turned and said but it's
[33:54] not neat for me to give the children's
[33:56] bread to dogs and guess what
[33:58] see when you want god and you want him
[34:00] as bad like you know what
[34:01] you don't care if he tells you to go dip
[34:03] down into a hog pin
[34:05] pray there put your nose in the mud
[34:09] right you want him that's all that
[34:12] matters you want him
[34:14] she wanted him she she needed a blessing
[34:16] and when she called
[34:17] he called her dog she says she humbled
[34:20] herself
[34:20] she didn't puff up you know what i mean
[34:23] oh lord
[34:24] and here in america you deal with an
[34:26] american woman whoo
[34:28] you betting that dog she'll tell you a
[34:30] thing or two
[34:31] right but she humbled herself
[34:34] and said lord even the dogs desired a
[34:38] crumb from the master table
[34:41] now you know that had to move him that
[34:43] had to move him
[34:45] right oh that had to move him
[34:49] because that's what i say lord even the
[34:51] dogs deserve
[34:53] listen if i can't get a loaf of bread
[34:56] give me the crumbs
[34:57] i eat the crumbs hallelujah because the
[35:00] crumbs just as powerful as the loaf
[35:03] hallelujah so what god did the mystery
[35:06] of this whole thing
[35:07] was that he set us in predestination
[35:10] a lot of churches today don't believe in
[35:12] predestination but
[35:14] predestination and election is my thing
[35:17] it's my heartbeat it's the very ink of
[35:20] my soul
[35:21] amen because i realize i can't do it
[35:25] and if if i'm not predestinated i'm
[35:27] wasting my time
[35:29] if i'm not chosen and elected i'm
[35:30] wasting my time
[35:32] but the bible said he called me
[35:35] that's how i know he called me to this
[35:37] message he called you to this message
[35:39] he chose you look at the millions or the
[35:42] thousands of people
[35:43] that would we rejected this thing but
[35:45] somehow
[35:46] you connected with it
[35:49] hallelujah predestinated there's the
[35:53] mystery
[35:54] he before christ or anything else was
[35:57] ever on
[35:58] earth you see his great mystery
[36:01] that he chose the bride knowing eve
[36:04] would fall
[36:05] from disbelieving the word knowing that
[36:08] she would fall
[36:09] but he would choose a bride that would
[36:12] not
[36:13] fall that would would hold to that word
[36:17] regardless of what all the rest of the
[36:19] world
[36:20] had to say about it they were hold to
[36:23] the word
[36:24] they are predestinated to stand there
[36:26] the adoption of children by jesus christ
[36:29] predestinated the church to that great
[36:32] glorious
[36:33] stand y'all understand me and others you
[36:36] can't even stand like that
[36:38] unless he's predestinated you to stand
[36:41] that's why you can't do things that
[36:43] everybody else does
[36:44] that's why you even though you falter
[36:46] you fall you come
[36:47] short but in your heart you believe it
[36:49] with all your heart
[36:50] that's that's the stand people that's
[36:53] that's something
[36:54] that god put in you amen that it
[36:56] determines who you are
[36:58] no turning back because you can't turn
[37:00] back
[37:02] there is no way out of it just pull me
[37:05] on lord
[37:06] yes sir now you see his secret what to
[37:10] do
[37:10] to restore from fallen eve as she was
[37:13] pre figured
[37:14] of the church and notice now as god
[37:17] opened up the side of adam ooh i love
[37:19] this part because
[37:20] you know i love this part as god
[37:24] opened up the side of adam and took out
[37:26] eve
[37:27] by his own flesh and blood and divided
[37:29] his spirit from masculine to feminine
[37:32] to feminine and then put it in eve took
[37:34] the real from under
[37:36] his side and made eve out of it so
[37:39] god did the same thing taking out of the
[37:42] side of christ
[37:43] blood and water and christ is the word
[37:46] and taking the word and making up his
[37:49] church
[37:50] eve see back to himself again redeemed
[37:53] by the blood that was to come
[37:55] from his body you see it now see see
[37:58] this is god's great mystery now being
[38:01] unfolded
[38:02] that been hid since the foundation of
[38:05] the world
[38:06] but prefigured it all the way down
[38:09] that's why i brought out this morning at
[38:12] the end of the message
[38:13] the two trees which was the one tree
[38:17] right because when we think about the
[38:18] tree of life we just think about one
[38:21] tree
[38:22] but the tree of life in order to
[38:23] multiply had to have
[38:25] a feminine hallelujah
[38:28] and adam and eve represented the
[38:30] feminine the masculine the feminine
[38:33] hallelujah they were the reflection of
[38:36] the tree of life
[38:37] before they fell y'all understand me
[38:41] right it was after the fall eve became
[38:43] the tree of death
[38:45] because the bible says you know if a man
[38:48] amen that's
[38:49] conceived of a woman this is just a few
[38:52] days
[38:53] few days hallelujah
[38:57] but you see now our birth don't it
[38:59] doesn't come by a woman anymore
[39:02] amen hallelujah when you're born again
[39:06] you're born again of jesus christ amen
[39:09] hallelujah it's a man that brings life
[39:12] because that's where the bloodline
[39:14] is hallelujah so i'm talking about
[39:17] enforcing
[39:18] so you got to understand everything is
[39:20] under law
[39:21] all nature is under law and god has a
[39:24] law of enforcement
[39:26] within every gene with every that little
[39:29] life
[39:30] that you can't see under the microscope
[39:33] there is a law
[39:35] you know we're trying to you know
[39:37] scientifically get into that
[39:39] and nanos and nano technology and all
[39:42] that these little
[39:43] little computers on the inside of your
[39:44] blood but god had that long time ago
[39:48] and you see what it is amen in there
[39:51] you know whenever you get sick that
[39:54] little computer kicks out the sickness
[39:56] go to battle for you
[39:57] right so you got to understand amen god
[40:00] already had that
[40:01] but in the natural show you got so let
[40:04] me better explain myself i'm excited i'm
[40:06] trying to
[40:06] not be so long but here it was god even
[40:09] in his nature
[40:11] took that sun the s-u-n and made that
[40:15] sun
[40:16] lord over the earth in the natural
[40:21] that sun regulates everything
[40:25] and the moon which is the bride or the
[40:28] wife of the sun
[40:30] regulates the night and the sun
[40:33] represents jesus christ
[40:37] regulates the whole thing amen
[40:40] right
[40:46] you know it's amazing because
[40:50] that sun no matter how
[40:53] the earth disappear and the earth
[40:56] represents
[40:57] you know the church and
[41:02] it's amazing how those two work together
[41:04] but anyway let's move on
[41:06] it's just the world excuse me and then
[41:09] the earth represents the world and when
[41:10] that when that earth
[41:12] moves out of the way of the sun it gets
[41:15] cold
[41:16] season changes everything dies
[41:21] right but there's a law
[41:26] no matter how messed it up messed up the
[41:28] winner brings it
[41:30] no you know what i mean you know i mean
[41:31] you look at some of those trees during
[41:33] the wintertime
[41:34] you think they could never live again
[41:36] they look pitiful
[41:38] they're naked kind of like the church in
[41:41] the wintertime naked
[41:44] you know but at the same time when that
[41:47] sun start approaching
[41:49] it doesn't matter where that life in
[41:51] that germ is
[41:53] it makes it happen y'all heard me preach
[41:56] this i think before one time i was
[41:57] walking
[41:58] and here was a blade of grass coming
[42:00] through a cement block
[42:03] and i thought to myself that's amazing
[42:07] that the power of the sun penetrated
[42:10] that
[42:10] cement or well however it did it and
[42:13] made the life of that little weed or
[42:16] whatever it was come out
[42:17] now if god was mindful of a little weed
[42:21] what about the wheat hallelujah
[42:24] no grave can hold my body down you
[42:27] understand me
[42:28] if i die if they burn me if they cremate
[42:31] me
[42:31] it doesn't matter if they scatter my my
[42:34] my ashes to the dust
[42:35] when god said come hither
[42:38] i don't care where if part of me is in
[42:40] japan pod might be in russia
[42:42] i don't care where it is you say why do
[42:45] you say it like that because
[42:47] god will take the very same elements he
[42:49] made you with and bring you back
[42:51] together
[42:52] because that is what a resurrection is
[42:55] the same stuff
[42:56] coming up again hallelujah you
[42:58] understand me
[42:59] so this message is a restoration message
[43:02] we thought
[43:03] pentecostal was restoring us but this
[43:05] message is restoring us
[43:07] to the very prince of the very power
[43:10] and amen from which we fail
[43:14] and god is enforcing it amen hallelujah
[43:18] you know we could get lazy on the job
[43:20] and god said but don't you worry
[43:21] satan think he's got us because he's got
[43:24] he's got this dollar towards
[43:26] this lazy spirit on us you know but you
[43:28] don't worry
[43:29] you know israel had the same same thing
[43:32] happening with them
[43:33] and then just before the exodus like i
[43:35] said this morning
[43:36] god had to put the pressure oh you don't
[43:39] have to worry about praying
[43:40] god's gonna make you pray he gonna put
[43:43] cause he knows
[43:45] even david had to go through trials and
[43:47] tests and you know
[43:48] david was a prayer warrior and when he
[43:51] fell and kept falling at times and
[43:53] things listen he says i
[43:54] look toward the hill from which cometh
[43:56] my help my help coming from the lord
[43:59] david knew how to turn toward the lord
[44:03] when he saw that he could not help
[44:05] himself and let me tell you something
[44:07] that's exactly what god will bring you
[44:09] amen if you think that you the control
[44:12] of your life
[44:12] god says that's human thinking
[44:16] you can't control none i'm the
[44:18] controller and all you and i must learn
[44:20] how to do
[44:21] is let go and let god and what we do
[44:24] instead of doing
[44:25] how you know brothers how do you know
[44:28] when you when you're not when you're you
[44:29] you're in your human element when you
[44:34] worry
[44:39] says satan has robbed you of the
[44:41] privilege
[44:42] of being a son or daughter of god we
[44:44] have a right
[44:45] this morning by the holy spirit to
[44:47] enforce the claim of god bring
[44:50] them back whether it be your children
[44:53] whether it be your loved one whether it
[44:54] be your daddy whether you be your father
[44:57] whoever whether it be you we have the
[45:00] right we have the authority
[45:02] amen to speak it and talk like we know
[45:05] what we're talking about
[45:08] amen you'll never hear policeman says
[45:11] would you please stop
[45:15] that's not the language of a policeman
[45:17] he says it with authority
[45:19] stop and you better stop
[45:24] consequences if you will come upon you
[45:27] if you do not right see he said if you
[45:30] if he's afflicted you and made you sick
[45:34] we have a right before god to enforce
[45:36] the laws of god
[45:37] by his stripes we are healed amen bring
[45:41] him back
[45:42] turn him loose you're taking him out
[45:45] yonder of death
[45:46] and we claim him bring him back
[45:50] now that's the enforcement restore it
[45:53] back to his natural condition again
[45:56] a man is sick baby is sick woman is sick
[45:59] see
[46:00] they're out of their natural condition
[46:02] then we have a right to enforce
[46:04] our claim what are you saying
[46:08] anytime we can see and recognize someone
[46:12] being out of their natural condition we
[46:14] have a right to enforce it
[46:17] we as children of god but you got to
[46:19] believe it
[46:21] you can't go up there and hope that god
[46:23] will
[46:24] heal them i was telling the brother the
[46:28] other day i said you know just like a
[46:30] lot of people
[46:31] they say it took us five hours to cast
[46:33] that demon out
[46:36] you ain't never seen jesus take five
[46:38] hours
[46:39] and another brother branham never took
[46:41] five hours
[46:44] that's the pentecostal i don't mean no
[46:47] harm they've seen too many movies
[46:49] that's hollywood speak the word
[46:54] because brother said when you repeat
[46:55] yourself like that
[46:57] he said it diminishes and decreases your
[47:00] faith
[47:01] when you see it that devil knows it too
[47:03] he'll let you holler there holler at the
[47:05] whole time
[47:06] by the time the end of the day you've
[47:07] got you've dropped from faith to hope
[47:11] that he doesn't move by hope only by
[47:13] faith
[47:15] right jesus told that man amen who had
[47:18] the episode episode
[47:20] epileptic come out
[47:23] and the devil threw that boy all over
[47:26] the place
[47:27] and jesus said oh my goodness he's
[47:29] getting worse
[47:30] no he stood there and waited now you
[47:33] you're done with your drama get out
[47:36] because the devil he just loved drama
[47:40] he loved drama just stay and wait he's
[47:43] got to go the word has been spoken
[47:49] yeah they're out of their
[47:52] natural condition then we have a right
[47:54] to enforce our claims
[47:56] not our claims it's our claim because
[47:59] god gives
[48:00] it to us it's like if you got somebody
[48:02] in your house and you don't want them in
[48:03] there
[48:03] get out they said no i'm not going oh
[48:06] you going
[48:07] if i've got to call the police you going
[48:10] if i've got to call the enforcer you're
[48:12] getting out of my house y'all understand
[48:13] me
[48:14] so it is with the spiritual
[48:17] if you know he want to move the devil
[48:19] call on the enforcer
[48:20] it's the holy spirit it's god he's there
[48:24] for you
[48:24] asks whatsoever you will and it shall be
[48:27] given
[48:29] that's the word not all claims is our
[48:32] claims because god
[48:33] gave it to us by his stripes we were
[48:35] healed
[48:36] he was wounded for our transgressions
[48:38] with his stripes we were healed
[48:40] now we have a right to enforce the law
[48:43] the lawgiver
[48:44] the holy spirit himself is here the
[48:47] agent
[48:48] of god to see that is done that way
[48:52] you believe in the holy ghost the holy
[48:54] ghost is
[48:55] is more than a feeling it's more than a
[48:58] shout or
[48:58] dance or singing it's god
[49:02] hallelujah is that all right
[49:06] you and i must learn amen how to cope
[49:08] with the word
[49:09] now i'm going to have to hurry up
[49:10] because we we uh
[49:13] uh want to understand what this enforcer
[49:16] is
[49:17] he said now he was and i'm going to stop
[49:19] here and then we're going to
[49:21] uh the communion service because i want
[49:23] you to understand by god's grace i know
[49:25] i'm cutting this short but i have to
[49:26] because
[49:27] you know i want us to understand that
[49:30] when we talk about enforcing
[49:32] we're not talking about our natural
[49:33] muscles
[49:35] we're talking about letting go and let
[49:37] god
[49:38] um i mean you know when
[49:41] when queen esther couldn't do it herself
[49:44] she went to the king
[49:48] she had authority but she knew that
[49:51] haman was a little bit more
[49:53] than she could handle and she needed the
[49:56] king's help
[49:57] you understand me and so when you see
[50:00] things that are really difficult for you
[50:02] amen and you can't sing you got to go to
[50:05] god in prayer
[50:07] if the people could understood where
[50:08] prayer takes you right
[50:11] amen brother i said when you travail it
[50:13] means that you travel
[50:15] yes sir and when you travel somehow you
[50:18] see that thing you asking for
[50:20] become visible to you you get up and say
[50:23] praise god he answered prayer
[50:25] it's a revelation and you can't explain
[50:28] it but that's the kind of way it happens
[50:31] when you when you all of a sudden
[50:33] something happens and you
[50:34] your prayers seem to be over that means
[50:37] god just answered
[50:40] you ever been there you just praying
[50:42] praying praying all of a sudden boom
[50:45] yeah the weight of it is gone everything
[50:48] is gone why
[50:49] because god just answers your prayer
[50:51] then you get up and says hallelujah
[50:53] thank you
[50:53] you know you don't get up like i wonder
[50:55] did he answer no he just answered
[50:58] amen know how he works he has spoken a
[51:02] word and put a law with the word and and
[51:04] the law is his
[51:05] own law his own life behind it
[51:08] that's the reason he swore by himself
[51:10] there's none uh
[51:12] greater you know uh and i hope uh
[51:15] you know we we look at things and we say
[51:17] lord
[51:20] one thing about um i hope she don't mind
[51:22] me using i won't go into detail
[51:24] but sister chapels always amazes me
[51:27] and and one of the things i i love about
[51:30] her is
[51:30] her disposition you know and but
[51:34] one thing she had will always
[51:37] stick in my heart when she was going
[51:39] through the troubles with her daughter
[51:42] and it was the love of god that wouldn't
[51:46] let her
[51:47] release you know sometimes we want to
[51:49] give up but she was a prayer warrior i
[51:52] mean
[51:52] you could see that the fervency that she
[51:55] had and
[51:57] and look at it now
[52:00] look what god has done
[52:03] you know we've seen it work you know
[52:06] married and got a good husband and you
[52:08] know
[52:09] amen and uh you know
[52:13] and just like that i don't know exactly
[52:16] when
[52:18] but i believe sister god gonna give her
[52:21] a harsh desire
[52:23] i believe that with all my heart
[52:27] i do and i'm believing with you on that
[52:29] i'm looking forward to seeing
[52:32] glory to god it's perseverance it's
[52:35] literally
[52:35] taking god and his wife says lord you
[52:37] promised not that you're being
[52:39] disrespectful
[52:40] he loves it when you take his word and
[52:42] says lord but you said
[52:46] he loves it he loves it
[52:49] and by his own death burial and
[52:51] resurrection he proved his law was right
[52:54] you understand me he was dead
[52:57] and the bible said that he that god
[52:59] would not let his body see corruption
[53:01] and it didn't and he rose on the third
[53:04] day not an old man a new man
[53:08] hallelujah restored back to his youthful
[53:12] state
[53:14] wherein that only his disciples could
[53:16] not believe they did not recognize him
[53:19] because he died an old man looking
[53:21] looking like an old man over
[53:22] over what 70 years old 50 whatever it is
[53:25] they said
[53:26] you know when he was talking about
[53:27] abraham i was before abraham and they
[53:30] said but you're not a man what 50 what
[53:32] happened how many years it was
[53:33] but anyway they saw him as an old man
[53:36] but when he rose again
[53:41] they didn't recognize how on earth did
[53:43] they come to know who he was
[53:45] by the nail prince hallelujah
[53:49] i mean even tom says i wouldn't believe
[53:51] it i ain't gonna believe it unless i can
[53:52] thrust my hand
[53:54] into his hands and into his side jesus
[53:56] said look at me thomas
[53:58] comes at all my lord and my god but
[54:01] blessed are you
[54:03] blessed is the man who've never seen yet
[54:06] believe
[54:07] oh my brother jim is feeling pretty good
[54:12] up here
[54:14] amen and by his own death burial and
[54:16] resurrection he proved his law was right
[54:18] see
[54:19] you destroyed this body i'll raise it up
[54:21] again in three days
[54:23] i personally pronoun i'll raise it up
[54:26] again in three days
[54:28] i'll bring it up just destroy it and see
[54:30] what happens
[54:31] for he knew the law of god he knew what
[54:34] it was
[54:35] he knew it had to work according to the
[54:38] word
[54:38] he know that the word of god had been
[54:40] spoken through a prophet
[54:42] and said i'll not suffer my holy one to
[54:44] see corruption that settled him
[54:46] that settled it then the law of god has
[54:49] got to work by the word we're coming
[54:52] down to a great thing in a minute see
[54:54] where the law of god word the law of god
[54:58] is his word
[55:01] see so i'm gonna leave it right there
[55:05] if the word says so that's exactly what
[55:08] it means
[55:10] you don't have to argue with it you
[55:11] don't have the reason
[55:13] you take god at his word and says lord
[55:15] this is your word
[55:17] and i'm standing on it he'll make the
[55:20] impossible possible
[55:22] let's stand
[55:27] there are some things
[55:31] i may not know
[55:36] there are some places
[55:40] that i cannot go
[55:47] but there's one thing
[55:50] oh then i'm sure of
[55:57] my god is real for i can feel

[57:24] him in my soul

[57:35] the service into our communion service

[58:04] years i thought
[58:06] years ago 1977 when
[58:09] i saw my first uh ufos didn't know what
[58:12] they were
[58:14] but i did tie them into the rapture for
[58:16] some strange reason i wasn't even in the
[58:18] message
[58:19] but i remember screaming and jumping on
[58:21] the side of the road lord whatever you
[58:23] do
[58:24] don't let let me miss the rapture and
[58:26] then it was in the early 80s god brought
[58:28] this message to me and
[58:30] answered my prayer but
[58:34] uh you know so i know that people are
[58:37] saying well the lord is delaying is
[58:39] coming
[58:41] they're way behind if they only knew
[58:44] that he's come
[58:47] in such a special way but a secret way
[58:50] and now he's transforming us
[58:52] bringing us together and i was thinking
[58:54] as i read the scriptures about how
[58:57] you know the dead in christ should rise

[1:04:08] from the first
[1:04:09] corinthians we'll start at the 23rd
[1:04:12] verse read on down
[1:04:17] [Music]
[1:04:18] paul is writing to the corinthians
[1:04:21] church
[1:04:23] and he says for i have received of the
[1:04:25] lord that which also i delivered unto
[1:04:27] you
[1:04:28] that the lord jesus the same night in
[1:04:30] which he was betrayed
[1:04:32] took bread and when he had given thanks
[1:04:35] he break it
[1:04:35] and said take eat this is my body which
[1:04:38] is broken
[1:04:39] for you this dude in remembrance of me
[1:04:42] after the same manner also he took the
[1:04:44] cup
[1:04:45] when he had sup saying this cup is the
[1:04:47] new testament in my blood
[1:04:49] this do e as often as you drink it in
[1:04:51] remembrance of me
[1:04:53] for as often as you eat this bread and
[1:04:55] drink this cup you do show the lord's
[1:04:56] deathly comes
[1:04:58] wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread
[1:05:01] and drink this cup
[1:05:02] of the lord unworthily shall be guilty
[1:05:04] of the body and blood of the lord
[1:05:06] but let a man examine himself so let him
[1:05:09] eat of that
[1:05:10] bread and drink of that cup for he
[1:05:14] that eateth and drinketh unworthily
[1:05:15] eateth and drinking damnation to himself
[1:05:18] not discerning the lord's body but this
[1:05:20] caused many of us are weak and sickly
[1:05:22] among you
[1:05:24] and many sleep for if we would judge
[1:05:26] ourselves we would not be judged
[1:05:29] but when we are judged we are chastened
[1:05:31] of the lord
[1:05:32] that we should not be condemned with the
[1:05:34] world
[1:05:35] wherefore my brethren when you come
[1:05:37] together to eat
[1:05:39] tarry one for another and if any man
[1:05:42] hunger let him eat at home that you come
[1:05:46] not together
[1:05:47] under condemnation and the rest will i
[1:05:49] set an
[1:05:50] order when i come
[1:05:53] for those who are participating you may
[1:05:55] come up front
[1:06:08] [Music]
[1:06:30] do
[1:06:35] let's pray father we thank you for the
[1:06:37] breaking of the bread
[1:06:39] we realize this is a symbolic lord of
[1:06:42] your body
[1:06:44] we pray father god as each one of us
[1:06:48] for taking this lord we are declaring
[1:06:52] that we are part of the bread that has
[1:06:54] been broken
[1:06:55] part of your body lord baptized in your
[1:06:58] precious name and filled
[1:07:00] with your holy ghost thank you father
[1:07:03] god
[1:07:04] bless these participants if there is
[1:07:07] healing
[1:07:07] needed we pray that they heal the bodies
[1:07:10] if they're strengthened
[1:07:11] they need strength in their spirit we
[1:07:13] pray that you do that
[1:07:15] whatever we come short of we pray that
[1:07:17] you would bless us lord
[1:07:19] in jesus christ's name we pray amen
[1:07:29] [Music]
[1:08:06] when he had given thanks he break it and
[1:08:08] said take eat this is my body which is
[1:08:11] broken for you
[1:08:12] there's two remembers of me let us eat
[1:08:27] [Music]
[1:08:36] do
[1:08:38] [Music]
[1:08:44] even though we take this communion
[1:08:47] none of us are worthy in ourselves
[1:08:51] to partake of the body of christ
[1:08:54] it is his grace and his mercy but is it
[1:08:58] at this time that god gives us the
[1:09:01] time to look into ourselves
[1:09:04] and if there be any shortcomings any
[1:09:06] faults or
[1:09:07] anything of that nature which i know as
