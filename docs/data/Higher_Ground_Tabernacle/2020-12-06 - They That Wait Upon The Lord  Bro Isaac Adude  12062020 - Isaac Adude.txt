songs of Zion Lord giving us oh Father God this grace to be in your house this the prophet says that the biggest mistake that the Devil Makes is to let one of your children Lord to enter this house oh

Father God that you strengthen me father and Lord you speak through me Father Lord as I always say help me to be so sensitive to the Holy Spirit to go wherever father God you will lead me Lord we thank you Father God we thank you for your presence this room and we ask you father God to continue to be with us Jesus Christ name we pray amen amen let's open our Bibles in the Book of Psalms read the verse [Music] 23 then we go to Isaiah Psalms 23 he only has four verses the Bible says unto thee lift I up my eyes oh thou that dwellest in the heavens Psalm 123 sorry PSM all right Psalms 123 I'm sorry the Bible says unto thee lift I up my eyes or thou that dwellest in the heavens behold as the eyes of the servants look unto the hand of of their masters and as the eyes of the maiden unto the hand of her mistress so our eyes wait upon the Lord Our God until that he have mercy on us have mercy upon us oh Lord have mercy upon us for we are exceedingly filled with contempt our soul is exceedingly filled with the scorning with the scorning of those that are a and with the contempt of The Proud you know I I love the verse two as David wrote it he says behold as the eyes of the servants look unto the hand of the master the eyes of the maiden onto the hand of her mistress so our eyes wait upon the Lord Our God until he have mercy upon us you know I love how he say that we wait upon God until so there is no time limit you have wait upon the Lord until he gives you whatever you ask for amen let's go to um Isaiah chapter 40 read the verse 29 to 31 yeah Isaiah chapter 40 29-31 actually let's start from verse 27 27 to 31 the Bible says what sayest thou the Bible says what sayest thou oh Jacob and speakest oh Israel my way is hid from the Lord and my judgment is passed over my passed passed over from my God has thou not known has thou not heard that the Everlasting God the Lord the creator of the ends of the Earth fth not neither is weary there is no searching of his understanding verse 21 verse uh 29 he says he giveth power to the Fain and to them that have no might he increases strength verse 30 even the youth shall faint and be weary and the young men shall utterly fall if you notice the Bible when the Bible uses the word youth it means strength but here the Lord is not talking about our natural strength no he's talking about the strength that he will give to people you know who will wait upon him so that strength doesn't matter how old you are you know he will make make you do something that the young cannot do verse 31 it says but they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength they shall Mount up with wings as eagles they shall run and not be weary and they shall walk in [Music] our let's pray Dear God we come again father Lord to you lord lord as the prophet says every man can turn the pages of this book but nobody can give the understanding Lord we pray that you be with us Lord and you help us father God to understand father God this Jesus Christ name we pray amen you may be seated this morning my subject will be they that wait upon the Lord because as David said in Psalms 1123 it says that we have to wait upon the Lord until you know let me let me read it again I fell in love with this scripture you know he says that we have to wait upon the Lord our God until that he have mercy upon us you know we have to wait upon the Lord Our God until you see your prayer being fulfilled you know you ask something through from God you ask something to God you know you are in need of something you ask God you have to wait upon it you know it doesn't matter how long it takes you have to wait you know last Sunday we preached in I City and we started this sermon I entitled it um stand still and see the salvation of the Lord so now we try to uh continue with you know cuz waiting you have to have faith to wait patience you have to have faith you know that's why the Bible when when when I think Paul who I forget who wrote it that when he said that you have to add upon Faith you know faith is there the foundation and you have to add upon it you know you have to add virtue knowledge Temperance and then you have to add patience godliness you know your patience has to go along with faith you know you ask something from to God you know you prayed all night long you know you have to wait up you have to wait on him you know you have to quieten yourself and wait until God gives you whatever you ask for and for you to wait you have to have you have to have faith you know you have to trust the Lord you know God said it I believe it that settles it the prophet says I spoke somewhere the other night and said and said what if the disciples had waited nine days and said we'll accept it by faith that we got the Holy Ghost and go on they wouldn't have had it see they stayed there until they knew it was there you know something had happened something that they could put their hands on say this is it just like Noah could say this is it you know just like Moses could say with a stick in his hand it you know the disciple had to wait you know Jesus told them to wait until you know they be filled with the spirit from high and the prophet says that if you go to God and and you come to the Altar and you asking God to save you or to fill you with the Holy Spirit Prophet said that you don't have to leave the altar until you are filled with the Holy Spirit when God tells you you have to wait until know you have to wait until it might take 40 years it might take 25 years it might take two days it might take a minute or a second but you have to wait until you see whatever thing that you had uh accomplished you know this morning when I was uh meditating you know I fell on the spir I fell on the uh the the story of Gideon you know you have to see that Gideon God called a man of of a great Valor but you see that Gideon the first thing that he had to do it was to destroy the sin that was in the camp went to the temple and destroy the the the uh the altar of Bale you know and then after that he had to fight you know there was a fight that was about about to happen but you see that Gideon even though the Lord called him a might a man of great Valor or Mighty Valor inside of Gideon gide had fear you know if you read the uh the chapter six of Judges I think about around verse 37 to 40 you know you will see that Gideon asked the first sign to God the first sign you know God if this you let this happen you know God showed him that it was him but yet Gideon saw that but he didn't trust God in full you know he didn't trust he didn't fully trust God you know he asked God for the second time you know God God God told him you know God gave him again that sign but yet even though God gave him two sign you know gide Gideon didn't really trust God you didn't fully trust God but the Lord saw you know the Lord saw the heart of Gideon and God wanted to help him you know if you read the verse the chapter 7 verse 10 to uh uh 11 this is after Gideon asked the the signs to God the two signs he asked him two signs and he asked him two signs and God gave him the two signs but here in verse 10 of chapter the Bible says this is God talking to Gideon let's read from verse n the Bible say and it came to pass the same night that the Lord said unto him arise get the down unto the host for I have delivered it into hand now here here is verse 10 the Lord is telling him but if thou fear to go down go thou with uh forah thy servant down to the host you know here the Lord is talking to a man who asks him signs you know the man God showed him the sign you know that he was with him you know God showed him the signs the two signs you know that I will fight this battle with you yet the Lord felt fear the lord smell fear to in Gideon's to Gideon you know the Lord saw that Gideon still you know Gideon you know was fear you know didn't believe he didn't fully believe you know sometimes as a man you know sometimes it happen that even though you see you know all the words being fulfilled but you still have that doubt you still have that fear but here is the Lord helping Gideon to overcome that fear because you can't go in the battle with that fear you know you have first to overcome it you know you cannot surrender yourself you cannot fully surrender yourself with that fear you know you cannot wait upon the Lord with fear you cannot believe in God With Fear so the verse 11 God says the Bible says and thou shall hear what they say and afterward thou sh shall th th hands be strengthened to go down unto the host then went he down with furah his servants unto this the outside of the Armed of the Armed men that were in the host to and and there Gideon showed that he was fearing because he took his servant and he went with him but there when they went you know God told them to hear whatever the the the the en the enemies will say so there when they went there you know a man had a dream you know he was telling them a dream he was telling the the enemies the dream and amongst them somebody was interpreting that dream and when Gideon heard that dream you know there at that point where Gideon really understood or he had faith in God that God would fight our battles if you read the verse 15 of the same chapter the Bible says that and it was so when Gideon heard the telling of the dream and the inter the interpret and the the inter interpret interpretation thereof that he worshiped and returned into the host of Israel and said arise for the Lord has delivered into your hand the host of median you know though Gideon was though Gideon had a fear on him but God helped him to overcome the fear because God was about to do something great with him then after that the Bible tells us about how many people Gideon had in his army you we first see that Gideon recruited 30 thou I mean 30,000 uh uh men 30,000 32,000 soldiers you know who had to fight against 1 135 135,000 million 135,000 you know at that point you know if you do the math you see that the ratio was 4 to1 so which means that uh which means which means that one soldier from the of the Gideon's Army had to fight had to kill four enemies you know but the Lord said that Gideon this is not enough this is not my plan you know though the ratio is 4 to1 after the battle you'll say that we did it with our own hands the Lord said ask them you know who is thinking about their life their family their children and everything and everything else you know and 30 and and 32 3 I mean and 22,000 soldiers wears up their hand they say that no we can't fight because we're thinking about our family if you going in a battle with god fully in you know you have to you have to made up your mind you there no turning back you know once you accept to to carry that cross you know you have to go until the end and and and 22 soldiers and 22,000 soldiers returned you know and and and G Gideon stayed with 10,000 soldiers that had to fight 135 135,000 soldiers you know now the ratio is 14 to one so which means that one soldiers one soldier of Gideon had to fight 14 other soldiers but the Lord said I'm not yet I'm not satisfied with this number you know I want you to give them more test you know I want you to form their character because character is not a gift you know character is a victory you know you have to fight for it you know you have to you have to fight for it you know you have to pass the test you know for you to form that character and the Lord told Gideon to say go to the river you know and let them drink water and those who will drink water with their hands you know those one will be selected to for the for the fight for the battle and those who would do with their tongue like the dog does you they would go back they would go to their home and there you know we see that you know uh 9,700 people failed that test and Gideon here stayed with 300 men you know who had to fight 130 135,000 soldiers so now you know if you don't have faith you know this seems this is impossible you know nowhere you'll see that 300 men we have to fight with 135,000 men out other the soldiers you know now here the ratio now is now four 450 to one the test is getting harder you know now Gideon you know those soldiers have to learn how to trust God more you know now this Soldier has to understand that it's not by their own strength they to wait upon the Lord you know which means that one soldier had to fight 450 other soldiers you know which seems impossible you know which is impossible but we know that the Bible says that with faith nothing is impossible everything isoss to them that believe so but now so gon instead of letting those 300 men fight together you know because we know that when there is Unity there is more strength you know when when people are united said no let me make this harder again you know he divided this 300 men into into three companies so 100 men has to go this way 100 had to go this way and the other 100 had to go that way you know which mean that 100 men had to fight 45,000 soldiers 45,000 which makes it harder again you know but Gideon had to trust the Lord you know Gideon had to wait upon the Lord you know God had to build the faith into Gideon you know and they went there and they fought this battle and they overcame you know nowhere with Gideon strength he had to fight that battle he had no strength to fight it you know by what needed you know he needed experience God you know he needed to have experiences with God you know that experience that will build up his faith he can go and trust God and fight this battle you know you see David with sa when go when Goliath came to to challenge them you know according to the Bible that Saul was the nearest man who was supposed to fight Goliath because the bible say that Saul was the tallest man you know among them all you know that's why he was chosen as as a king you know was the tallest man in Israel you know so you know so was lacking something you know he was lacking experience with God no faith he had no faith to go fight against goath he had fear you know David who was way smaller than sa you know he had experiences with God so when he went to sa you know David was able to tell so his experience that he had with God those experience to BU build up his faith and he went and he fought against and he fought against Goliath you know we need fa you know we need to wait upon the Lord you know you see Moses you know God told him to to go he had the promise of the Lord he had the word of the Lord to deliver you know his people you know Moses Tried by by himself you know he couldn't because he had fear you know he ran he ran from Pharaoh you know Moses was waiting an experience he wanted to have an experience with God needed that experience from the back of the desert you know and once the lord gave him that experience and once the Lord met him you know Moses went to fight Pharaoh with the stick you know the prophet said that people could have asked Moses Moses where are you going you know Moses answered was I'm going to conquer you people will ask him what are you going to conquer with you know Moses tell tell them with this stick you know that sounded crazy you know you know that is crazy you know you're going to conquer the greatest army in the world with a simple stick you know they have those armors they have those weapons you know they have those arrows but you going to conquer them with the stick but people didn't see what was behind the ve you know Moses had an experience to B himself on you know Moses waited on the Lord and he had the word of the Lord conquer you know because the Lord will be with him and we see that Moses went and Moses conquered you know you might go through something you know that seems to be impossible it's nowhere to find it you know nowhere to find the solution you just have to have faith you know you just have to trust God you just have to wait upon him you know the Bible says that day that wait upon the Lord they shall renew their strength you know even though you don't have strength you don't have strength you know even though you don't have faith you know wait upon him you know go to God and pray you know he will renew your strength the Bible says in Romans 8: 26- 27 8 Romans 8 26- 27 you know as God you know knew what Gideon needed you know Gideon needed a word of comfort you know to help him build up his face you to help him worship God and to go to fight to go and fight you know here's the word that that is that will Comfort us you know Romans chapter 8 verse 26 to 27 the Bible says like was the spirit also help with our infirmities for we know now what we should pray for as we are by the spirit itself make us intercession for us with groanings which cannot be Ed you know when you feel weak you know you're trying to pray but there's no words coming out of your mouth you know you're so overwhelmed with trials with troubles you know you feel weak you you know you don't have the to pray you know you have to know one thing you know the holy spirit is doing the work interceding for you you know verse 27 the Bible says and he that searches that searches the hearts knowth knowth uh what is in the mind of the spirit because he maketh intercession for the S according to the will of God you know God the Holy Spirit Jesus is interceding for you you know things that you can't pray you know words that you can't pronounce you know the problems that you can't explain because it's so hard and you know you can't just explain it you know you lacking words to to tell in the cross you know you have to know that there's somebody interceding so fear not God is with you stand still because God cares for you you know it's like Moses you know when those children of Israel you know there so Pharaoh coming after them you know Moses had the word of the Lord you know to comfort the the children of Israel to say that Fe not stand still and know the salvation of the Lord is here you know those Egyptians that you seeing you in a few minutes you will see them no more you know because God is about to fight our battle and if you read the entire chapter you know you read the chapter the that chapter and the previous chapter before you know you will see that the God you know tell Moses and he said that Moses with this with my strong hand I deliver you you know which means that God will have God himself will fight it for you you know with his strong hand God will deliver you know one time I preached about the Redemption by Blood and by power you know that that is the Redemption by power of the Lord God himself will come down you know to fight for you you know after God saved you from from from sin you know that is the Redemption by Blood you you will still have trials you will still have things to to fight you know God now will have to redeem You by his with his power which means that himself will come down to fight your battle he will have Victory you know we see job we see the the trial that job's had you know that help us to understand how to wait upon the Lord you know when all his wife you know his friends you know was coming against him you know telling him to forsake his God you know job had to wait upon the Lord you know he told them I know one thing that I know my redeemer living one day you know though this body you know though this body you know you know though this body forsake me you know though everybody forsake me you know my faith is on God you know my my my I still believe in God you know sooner or later you know I know God will come to my rescue it didn't matter how long job had to wait you know God you know he still had faith and God came to his rescue you know go God told Abraham God gave Abraham a promise I will give you a child but God didn't tell him when it will give him a child Abraham had to wait upon the Lord you know as the prophet say that you know 10 years after Sarah asked Abraham when is that child is going to come you know Abraham said that God said it you know we just have to believe it one day that child will come you know it doesn't matter how long we can wait you know we stay we just have to have faith you know something amazing with God you know God tested Abraham's Faith you know because if you see you read the the Genesis chapter 20 you know verse 17 to 18 you'll see that God you know before that God gave the promise to Abraham Abraham was waiting for a child but here in Genesis 20 verse 17 to 18 you know the Bible says that so Abraham prayed unto God and God healed ab and his wife and his made servants and they bear children now Verse 18 the Bible say for the Lord had fast uh for the Lord had fast closed up all the wombs of the House of ab because of Sarah Abraham's wife so now here Abraham who God first promised to give a child God didn't give him a child yet you know he was waiting on God to give him a child but here is the same God telling Abraham to go pray for ab to have a child you know Abraham didn't ask Lord to say but Lord you know what AM is going to say you know my myself I prayed to you to to give me a child you didn't give him you didn't give me first I hear you telling me to to go pray for somebody to have a child you know Abraham didn't care about all of that because Abraham knew one thing that that the Lord said it you know I'm pretty sure the Lord said it and I believe it you know it doesn't matter how long I have to wait you know God will give me a child so I'm going to pray for him you know with the same faith that I have you know and God's going to give him a child we know that the Bible tells us Abraham to wait about 20 or 25 years and finally God gave him a child and I usually say that if Abraham you know ask God for a child God after a year God gave him a child you know that that verse or or that experience will not impact many people as that experience is impacting people now because the longer God you know the the longer God takes to answer the great is the testimony behind it you know that testimony helped many people down the [Music] road you know we see that people who was Barren you know there saw that Abraham had to wait for 25 years you know both of them passed the menopause age but God had to renew them you know and God gave them a child you know we see the prophet for 40 years the prophet had to pray God to deliver him from from gastritis you know for 40 years the prophet was praying God you know to deliver him from that sickness you know but we see that the same Prophet you know was there praying for people you know who were receiving their healing at the same place at the same second you know we see the same Prophet who saw a man a child you know who had a car accident and his body was all over the places you know he prayed for that man you know and and that and we see people saw the body coming you know coming together and built again one one body you know we see the same Prophet you know speaking the word you know stopping the storm calming the storm you know giving give giving head ride you know the salvation of of of his children you know giving life back to the to the fish you know we see the same Prophet praying for blind men and they recover their sight but here is that same Prophet you know struggling with the Sickness years you know never one time we heard in the tape the prophet complaining about what the Lord was doing to him you know he mother so so a dream his mother so a dream about six Dov you know coming to to sit on his chest you know the prophet told him you know I'm waiting for that seventh when that seventh will come that's when the healing will be you know he waited for so long but yet never one time the prophet disbelieved God you know never one time the his faith decreased you know he was there believing in God and after that and then 65 1965 you know toward the end of his of his life you know God gave him his healing you know he saw the seventh day of coming and he was healed you know it didn't matter how long that Prophet had to wait God gave him his healing you know and with the inspiration of the Lord you know the prophet was inspired to add the last verse of this song of on the wings of the do says though I have suffered in many ways you know I cried for healing both night and day you know by faithful by faith was not forgotten by the father above you know he gave me signs on the wings of the dove you know I prayed for healing both night and day but my faith was not forgotten by the father you know you praying for deliverance both night and day you know you praying for your family to get together both night and day you pray for God to help you in the situation that you are both night and day you know you praying that God can help you to overcome this trial both night and day but I want to tell you something that that faith is not forgotten by the father is not for by father you know it's in God's Journal you know it's in God's book you know he knows the exact time that God has to show up you you know she prayed both night and day that Jesus can come and heal his brother Lazarus Lazarus was sick she waited for Jesus to show up Jesus show up Lazarus was di Lazarus passed away still Jesus didn't show up after four days you know Lazarus began to rot you know then here's Jesus showing up you know for Martha it was too late but for Jesus it wasn't too late you know for Jesus he was on time as if Lazarus was alive because he knew that nothing is impossible to him you know he knew that everything was possible you know but when Jesus showed up you know he spoke the word and Lazarus and Lazarus came back to life you know you might seem that it's too late for God to act you know you might seem that you know your situation you know is too late you know everything is done you know that situation is not not too late for God you know God has a time that he has to show up you know a you know the prophet talks about her you know she compared herself to to the sh woman you know she was Barren she prayed for God to give her a son God gave her a son now that son backl but you know that that son didn't believe in God you know that son back said you know she she she prayed for God she prayed God you know God didn't save her son at that time now her son is sick you know she was praying God God didn't heal her son you know she kept on praying God God didn't hear her son now her son now is going to hell you know she was still praying her son was not was not unable to speak you know she kept on praying you know those passing through those experiences you know never one time her face their fith decreased you know she still had Faith you know she waited upon the Lord you know she prayed you know though her sons you know couldn't say nothing you know her son seeing Darkness you know you pray but yet but by then the Sovereign God you know gave her a gave her a vision you know gave her a dream you know of a man of Elijah you know who will come you know God didn't tell her when that Elijah will pass by that had to go out know to wait for that Elijah she didn't care how long she would wait you know she had to wait until she saw that Elijah pass she had to wait you know an hour passed by that Elijah didn't pass she said that you know one thing for sure I'm pretty sure the Lord spoke to me you know I have faith that I saw the Lord you know I don't care how long the Lord will will help me wait you know God will pass I will see that Elijah pass by passing by you know she waited until that Elijah passed you know she was waiting you know her faith had to stop the plane you know her faith had to take the the prophet who was inside of the plane to lead that Prophet to tell him to get off the plane you know to lead that you know take your right take your left go straight you know go this way and that Faith LED that Prophet until that Prophet passed by and when she saw that Prophet she said that this is Elijah and she called him and after that the Prophet The Prophet enter his house you know the prophet asked him to pray ask her to pray you know the prophet when she prayed the prophet said that you know that was the honest prayer that the prophet you know that the prophet heard it was simple but sincere prayer and when the prophet pray for his child you know the prophet says that Lord you led me this far Lord I want you to heal this this child you know this child this child this son you know who couldn't say a word you know the first word that the child that the child saw the first word that the child said mom mama I see light you know that was God saving that that child that was God saving that son you know why because it took the faith of a mother you know to pray for her son you know he took the faith of a mother you know to pray for her son and that mother had to wait upon the Lord you know she had to wait until she sees the mercy of God she wait until she sees the mercy of God being fulfilled she didn't matter how long she will wait you know she knew one thing God said it she believed it and that settled the situation you know God promise you that he will take care of you you know God promis you that he will fight all your battles you know God promised you you know to have faith in him you know it doesn't matter how long you have to wait you know it doesn't matter you're going you're going about you know you're about to die you know you're going to it's the end of your journey keep believing in God you know no matter how long it takes you just believe it because God says it and it will settle the situation you know the children of the Hebrews children you know there before the fire far reface you know they trusted God they stood for the word and they you know leading they were going to the fire what they say you know even though we are even though this fire consume us but yet we will never bow our knees to this before this statue you know even though you know even though this sickness kills me you know yet I will never fail you know to trust God I will still trust his word because I know what the God is able to do you know those children you know they trusted God you know those children they had faith in God and right there in the fire you know the Fourth Man Came In The Fire you know right there in the fire you know the fourth man turned the AC and they were there you know if you're going through something you know you just wait upon the Lord you know it doesn't matter how long you wait how long you wait you know the Bible says that day that wait upon the Lord they shall renew their strength they shall Mount up you know they shall Mount up as eag know God will give them wings to fly and this problem that it seems to be like a high mountain you can't you can't you can't climb you know you will see it from the 's point of view you know you will see it from the point of view you know when the Lord will help you overcome it you I love the song that says Lord don't take away this mountain before me Lord don't take away this stumbling block before me but Lord I want you to give me strength to climb up this to give me cl this mountain you know I don't want I
