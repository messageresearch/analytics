somewhere listening for my name remember your heart has to be right first amen and your robe has to be white amen before you be able to listen to your name when God calls you amen uh without taking too much time let's open our Bibles in the book of First Kings uh we read the chapter 18. verse 19 to 21 then we'll jump to verse 39. First Kings chapter 18 verse 19 to 21. I mean it's a familiar uh story of the Bible you managed to show down that the prophet talks about in multiple messages amen First Kings chapter 18 verse 19 to 21 the Bible says now therefore send and gather to me all Israel unto Mount Carmel and the prophets of ball 450. and the prophets of the grooves 400. which eat at Jezebel's table so in total amen Elijah was facing 850 Prophets so Ahab sent unto all the children of Israel and gathered the prophets together unto Mount Carmel and Elijah came unto all the prophet and said how long hard ye between two opinions if the Lord be God follow him but if bald then follow him and the people answered him not a word amen if we jump to verse 39 the Bible says that and when all the people saw saw it they fell on their faces and they said the Lord he is God he is the god the Lord he is the god amen let's bow ahead father Galway come before you Lord this evening Lord just to say thank you Father Lord thank you Father Lord for everything that you have done for us Lord thank you Father for the grace of God that you give us Lord Jesus every morning Father Lord Lord we we're here father God just to talk about you Lord and to spend to have a really great time with you father that's why we pray O Father Lord that you have the first place of God and you calm down no father Lord and you take me out of the out of the way Lord Jesus and you speak to your people this evening father Lord I pray father Lord that you help me to be so sensitive to the Holy Spirit Lord so that I can say exactly what you want me to say Lord I thank you Father give you all the glory and honor in Jesus Christ's name amen amen this evening I have a really uh small subject that uh I would love to share with you that we entirely if the Lord be God man that's what we'll be talking about this evening if the Lord be God Amen here the Bible talks about talk you hear the Bible he's talking about Elijah a man he had to prove to all those 850 prophets that God was the was the only true God it meant because Elijah knew the God that he was serving and he believed that that God will show up remember if we go to uh uh Genesis chapter 3 uh we'll see that the same thing kinda happened to Eve amen both of them knew the god that they were serving both both of them they they had the word of the Lord brought both of both of them they do they didn't have the promise of God but you'll see that one failed and the other one succeeded if we go to uh Genesis chapter 3 amen will uh from verse 1 to verse 7 we'll do a little study on that before I go to my uh subject and when you hear you understand you read uh Genesis chapter 3 verse 1. amen here the Bible says that now the serpent was more saddle than any abyss of the field which the Lord God had made and he said unto the woman yea has God said You shall not eat of every tree of the garden amen here if you understand that you will see that the devil here Satan misquoted the Bible amen this is not what God said because if you because here apparently he thought that he was quoting Genesis chapter 2 verse 16 or 17. there you will you will see that God told the woman to eat of every tree of the garden but the tree of the of the wisdom of of Good and Evil but here when the Devil comes to the woman amen he said that God said that you shall not eat of every tree of the garden Amen in other words he was checking to see if the woman knew exactly what God Said Amen he was checking to find out if the woman a man knew or had a knew the word that she was about to quote here in verse 2 the Bible says that and the woman said unto the serpent we may eat of every tree we might we may eat of the tree of uh uh we met eat of the fruit of the Trees of the garden but of the tree about of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden God has said that you shall not eat of it neither shall ye touch it lest I die amen here the woman understood that the devil misquoted the word amen now she comes by correcting the devil about you know am I saying exactly what God Said Amen the woman quoted the word amen she knew the word that God said amen she had the knowledge of the word it meant by having the knowledge of the word it's not everything that God requires amen God requires us to have the faith Amen in the word that we speak amen you can't say something amen for it to come to pass I mean you have to have the faith Amen to bring that word to pass so the devil here he understood that just misquoting the word amen he will not accomplish whatever he had in mind amen so now he said that well let me change a little bit let me change the side of the tactic amen let's bring because here he came just by misquitting the word and he says that this didn't work so now he comes back in verse 4 of that same chapter he says that and the serpent say unto the woman you shall not surely die amen now he's bringing the woman to join him to start doubting the word of the Lord amen he said because God said that you will surely die amen the Devil comes back and he added the nut saying that you shall not surely die amen but because God is keeping something from you verse 5 he says that for God does know that in the day that you should uh you eat thereof then your eyes shall be open and you shall be as God as God knowing good and evil so here he comes and he says that well if you eat from this tree you will be equal to God Amen you'll be able to do the exact same thing that God did amen you'll be able to create your own word you'll be able to speak amen and then to speak the word and and the light will come and do exactly what God said you will have the same someone to believe God's word it's reasoning am I the only thing that will fail the word of God to come to pass is reasoning so that's why he came and he brought wisdom to the woman Amen to help her to push her to reason even about the word of God Amen so now here in verse 6 and 7 the bible says that and when the woman saw that the treat was good for food and that it was pleasant to the eyes and the tree to be desired to make one wise she took off the fruit thereof and did it and gave also unto her husband with her and he did it also and to the verse 7 and The Eyes of them both were open and they knew that they were naked and they still a fig lives together and made themselves and made themselves aprons so here verse 6 you'll understand that when the devil came with that word without knowledge amen you will see that the woman he met the woman the woman before she ate or before she sinned the devil had to convince her that whatever she was about to do was right amen because that is exactly what the devil does Amen before he makes you do something wrong and when he will come and start to show you examples and look at it when your pastor did this that means that this is right if I look at the guy that you you take as your your example your Mentor amen look at he did the exact same thing that means that you know it's right and you can do the exact same thing amen that's what that's how the devil came to the woman to to make her believe that whatever she was about to do was right and then after that before and then after that it made you realize that the woman saw that the food was good that the tree was good for food and pleasing to the eye you know it made that sin to become beautiful and that in order for her to have wisdom she had to eat of that tree for her to have the wisdom so the devil came to her and made it made it to be like you know it's a must it meant for you to have wisdom for you to be like God you must eat this fruit of this fruit Amen in other words if you don't eat of this fruit you will never be like God you'll never be equal to God you will never be able to create you'll never be able to Amen to do the uh what God Said Amen you have to eat this it's a must for you to have the wisdom Amen in the Bible says that the woman fell to it immensely ate it amen amen the Bible said that's why Elijah knew the exact word of the Lord amen Elijah knew the god of the Old Testament and he knew that as long as I keep the faith amen God will still come God will come and will prove these people wrong the prophet says here he says that but today the people if they don't get everything they ask for the first time they pray they seem to think that he's dead that God is dead what we need is men and women today of girl and spirit men and women who are determined to hold on till they see a God that really leaves come into action that will not take no for an answer amen there there are determined to stay with it if they are sick and the doctor has said that they can't get well yet something within them tells them that they are going to be well hold on no matter what takes place have uh uh have you joined the churches of the denominational denominational world after you have uh uh accept all your strength from walking uh from place to place and you still can't find relief there is still a God that answers prayers amen and saves from sin amen there is still a God Amen after you have tried him and you have prayed amen you come to God so many times every night amen the prophet said that just keep the faith amen it's not an attempt to forsaken to say that God can't hear my prayers even even though amen that's what the Bible says that that's song that we sing for even though it's four days late a man just keep believing amen God is coming Jesus is coming amen Martha knew that he was late amen but that Lazarus says dead amen but Allah she's already dead remember when she saw Jesus amen that renewed her hope amen she knew that even though four days that has already gone amen by when Jesus will come when Jesus was so up amen the miracle will come amen that exact same thing that amram amen and and your quebe the Father the parents of Moses amen the prophet says that these people amen they've been going to the mountain every night to pray the Lord that God can send a deliverer it seemed like they were praying a god of History amen because it's been 400 years that God is not God was not answering to their prayers I mean it's been 400 years they've been praying for a whole 400 years Lord come and Deliver Us Lord come and set us free amen by be looks like God will sign Island to them he looks like God turned their back to them amen the prophet says that these two parents amen they kept their faith every night they were going to the mountain and prayed the Lord and said Lord send your delivery Lord come and set us free Lord come and Lord hear our prayers amen but after 400 years came to pass amen God came down amen God came to prove that he's the same God because he believed that The God Who visited Abraham amen as Melchizedek amen The God Who visited Abraham as the son of man amid that same God Amen will come to visit them that same God will bring Amen to deliver that they've been looking for amen they knew that The God Who visited Isaac amen The God Who came to Isaac amen the God who showed up when Jacob was in need and when when death was knocking at his door it meant that God who came back Amen to save him from his brother amen they believed that that same God Amen will come and set them free they had to keep their faith amen because if the Lord is God Amen he would do the exact same thing that he did yesterday amen as long as you believe if the Lord is God Amen he will do that amen that's why tonight we'll be talking about that if the Lord is God Amen he will do the exact same thing that he did amen Elijah told them if the Lord is God Amen if you notice that God has done exactly Amen to the details about everything that I said you have to follow him amen you have to serve him amen and God did the exact same thing Amen in verse 39 the Bible says that they all believed in that God Amen they all started to serve God they all started to Amen to to follow that God Amen today we have to raise that God of History amen you have to raise the god of Israel to your praise and crisis amen you have to bring that God of Israel to the present time amen like Abraham did amen he knew that God came to said amen God came to help Isaac amen he knew that God came to set uh Jacob free amen he knew that God came and he fought for them before amen he knew that that same God Iman is able to come to the present crisis and set them free amen he had to have the faith amen that's the fifth that Joshua had amen when he went to the Jordan before the Jordan River amen because the Bible says that they crossed in April meaning that in April amen they have so many rings that the Jordan Rivers becomes full the Bible says that they crossed a flood stage meaning that it was impossible to cross it unless it's a miracle it meant by he remembered that God of History he remembered that God of Moses he said that the God Amen of Moses Who The God Who was with Moses amen with him we cross the Red Sea amen it's the same God today even who will help us even to cross this this Jordan River amen Jordan Joshua taught the children of Israel he said that this morning when he woke up he told them he says that today God is about to do something great just follow the leadership he said that everybody go behind the ark amen go behind the Levi amid the Levi when you will see them amen go behind them and start following them amen because when they will place their first feet amen when they will press their feet in the water and when God will divide this water into amen and they did the exact same thing and God divided that Jordan River amen because you say that the Bible repeated that same story amen the Bible says that uh the the god divided a river or a sea four times in the Bible the first time most with Moses amen God told Moses Moses why are you crying just speak the word amen because I am the same God if the Lord is God Amen he will do this Moses why are you crying speak the word amen Moses spoke the word amen and the Jordan and the Red Sea was divided amen when it came to Joshua before Jordan River amen he said the same thing Amanda I will do great things today Joshua just follow the ark it may just follow the leadership of the Lord amen you will see the great result amen he followed the leadership of the Lord and the Jordan River was divided amen when he came to the time of Elijah amen he was standing before the Jordan River amen with the mantle amen he says that he said he talked to Elijah he said that Elijah asks whatever you want amen God will give it to you amen he divided that that Jordan River amen and then the fourth time when Elijah was coming back amen after Elijah was raptured Elisha was coming back Elijah said that where is the god of Elijah amen he called the god that God of History him and he called the god of History Amen to his present crisis amen saying that God you have done this with my mentor amen God you have done this with your Prophet before me amen that you are still the same God Amen who can do the exact same something tonight amen you are still that God Amen who can set this uh who can divide this River this tonight amen Lord I need you to come am I the same way you showed up when Moses needed you amen the same way you showed that point Elijah needed you him at the same way you showed up when Joshua needed you Lord I need you to be the same God Amen who can show up today because I need you Amen to set this damage to divide this Jordan River amen that's why you had to cry where is the god of Elijah amen because he believed that the same God was with Elijah amen that same God is with me this morning amen he said that be that same God is here so let him do the exact same thing that he did amen if we believe that that same God Amen who walked in the Old Testament amen that same God Amen who walked with Jesus amen is here tonight amen we have to cry to that same God Amen to do everything that he said he was gonna do amen we have to cry to the same God Amen to be our Jehovah Jireh this evening Amen to provide to all our needs Amen to come and to answer to all our questions it meant to come and to heal the sick amen to come and to bless us amen because he is the same God and he will keep his word if the Lord be God we're all the Miracles amen if the Lord be God where is it meant how can you show how can you prove it to someone who doesn't believe that God is God how can you prove it that God is God Amen how can you tell them that I serve the true God when you don't have any experiences amen how can you true how can you say how can you prove to them that I saved I served the Living God that you have to follow that same God Amen that God has to do the exact same thing if the Lord if the Lord be God where are all the Miracles the prophet says in the message lifting up out of history paragraph 77 and 75 he says that let me let me more say today my brother and sisters in this present day when Christ is and when cancer is eating the world the world up and diseases of all kind the same historical God that cleansed the leper he'll be sick and raise the dead it's the same God today amen he's waiting anxiously anxiously for his people to call him on the sin of action it meant the same God Amen who healed laid the leper amen the same God who healed the sick the same God who raised the dead amen is the same God tonight amen but he's only waiting anxiously Amen to the people to bring him up Amen to call him on the scene of action today amen he said that a paragraph 76 it says that the one who could forgive a harlot for committing adultery seven times in a day amen he who could cleanse the Violet sinner amen and make them white as Lily amen that same God of History lives today it meant to clean every black and heart of sin and unbelief amen that same God is the same God tonight it may that same God Amen is among us because he said the word two or three amen are gathered in my name I will be there Amen to gathered in Jesus name amen is just to gather and Let Jesus be the center amen of your Gathering amen when your thoughts amen are in Jesus amen that's when it's gonna show up amen and wherever God shows up amen the prophet says that people have to know that God is there that's why Gideon amen when all the Malachite and all the the jebusa was coming and taking everything from them and he said that if God is with us where are the Miracles amen because he knew that when God is with him amen amen things happened many knew that when God is with them amen those people will know that God is with them amen and they will be afraid Amen to come and to attack them amen because God is the god of the miracle and may God be the god that will serve him and he's the god to do great things that's why Gideon said that if God is with us amen where are all the Miracles if God is with us why the devil is not afraid of us amen because notice that the children are after when the children of Israel cross the Red Sea amen they went to Jericho amen when they were talking to rehab Rahab told them he said that we have heard what God has said what God has done for you in Egypt amen therefore they have heard from afar it meant everything that God has done for them and the people in the city fear the name of the Lord amen because God was with them all the nations were shaking amen every time the children of Israel was going where they were going to the battlefield amen as long as they had the ark with them that those enemies they knew that as long as the ark is with Israel Israel will never lose not even one bottle amen because they knew the name of the Lord amen they knew that God was with them amen and God what is their strength amen and if God is with us this evening where are all the Miracles amen if God is with us where are all the experiences amen how long has it been since you had an experience with the Lord amen and you claimed that God is with you amen if God is with you where is he it man show me that God that you serve it may show me that God Amen that you pray every night show me that God that you go tell the people that I'm a Christian where is he at amen how can you show it to me I don't want a dead God I don't want a god of History amen but I want a prison tense God Amen that's what when he sent Moses to the children of Israel he said that Moses tell him Moses said but Lord if they ask me who sent me what can I say to them amen God told them he said God told him he said that God tell them that the I am has sent me amen the I am he's not a god of Israel anymore amen but he is the god of the present tense amen Moses knew that at every time and any moment it meant that I will call on the name of the Lord God will show up because he said that I am the I am amen that's why when he came to the Red Sea amen he spoke to the red cmn and the Red Sea was divided amen that's when when when the children of Israel didn't have something to eat amen he spoke to God in the manner and food came down amen because he was serving the god of the present time amen he was serving the I am God Amen and we have to serve that same God amen that's why Elijah told them if the Lord be God you must follow him amen you must serve him if the Lord be God let him do the exact same thing amen he is the I am he is the Beast of God of present time amen is not a god of the past amen whatever he did in the past amen as long as you have that same Faith amen God would do it amen it doesn't matter how the situation is terrible him and it doesn't matter if the situation is getting worse I mean it doesn't matter even if there is no hope like Brother Sam preached it on Sunday amen as long as you believe that God of the present time amen as long as you believe the I am amen he will come amen the prophet preached it he said that raising God out of History amen you take him out of Israel and you bring it to your present tense amen you bring it to your present time amen you will see the miracle amen whatever he did in the Old Testament it meant he can do it today amen whatever he did with Jesus amen he can do it tonight whatever he did with the prophet amen he can do it tonight as long as you have the faith amen that we praise we pray that God if the Lord be God let him be let him do the exact same thing tonight amen the prophet says in wisdom versus faith for a paragraph 1 14. he says that now what started it man here is talking about Genesis chapter 3 he says that now what started it says the reasoning started it see faith has no reason you don't reason at all am I you believe when you prayed for and accept God's word for healing don't reason with your feelings amen don't reason with nothing else there is no reasoning to it God said so and that settles it in a minute that you reason on God's word then you're losing faith see don't have don't don't have no yes no's maybe so stay right with it see Eve had the right approach amen because she knew the word amen she could she was able to quote that word that's what the prophet says that Eve had the right approach but she listened to his reasonings amen the first uh paragraph one one hundred and seven he says that there is just so many people today that has the right knowledge that knows that this word shall be God's word and it is God's word but they stand and let some Seminary students reason them out of it away from the holy spirit away from the things of God reasonings were to cast them down amen he said that there is no reasoning that's why he says that in your soul amen there is only place for one thing amen it's either Faith or doubt amen you can't have the both together amen you must have one either you have faith or you don't have it at all amen and we're not supposed to reason with God's word amen whatever God says amen you have to believe it amen and when you believe it even you have to act upon it amen if God Jesus tell the the that man that sick man he says that take your bed and start walking amen he acted appointed him and he took his bed and he started walk he started to walk he met the prophet told that blind man go and Proclaim and go and testify that I can see amen even though it was still blind at the time and when he went and he did the exact same thing and days after him and God gave him the healing Amen to stop proclaiming it meant no place for reasoning amen stop proclaiming amen when the angel came to Mary and he said that you will be covered by the year but but the Holy Spirit and you will have a child amen Mary didn't wait for symptoms to come to show up before she started to testify amen she went straight the Bible said that she left with haste even she went to Mary and to tell her it meant exactly what the Angela said because she believed it amen because she knew that this is the word of God Amen she knew that this is God's word and I have to believe it and it is true and he will come to pass amen and that word came to pass amen she didn't wait it's like that song that says that amen I can't keep it to myself amen I have to testify even though I say that I can't testify for God Amen by this thing is so great amen the word is so great that I can't keep it to myself that I have to go tell the good news yeah that's what Mary said that's what Mary did amen she went when she received that word and the good news it man she rose up the Bible said that she rose up with haste and then she went to testify and when she wants to testify amen the Bible says that it went at the sound of her greetings amen the baby that was inside of Elizabeth he started to leap for Joy the dead baby that was inside of Elizabeth amen at the sound of Mary's greetings amen when she say that that baby inside of me will be named Jesus amen that baby started to leave for Joy amen she knew that baby knew that the Lord was God Amen and I can be raised up again even though I'm dead I mean if God is if the Lord be God let him do the same thing for your situation amen whatever needs you have a man just call on that God Amen bringing in that present time amen you understand that when God gives Sarah and Abraham a baby after 25 25 years amen after them it meant many cases in the Bible those same chances happen again amen the Bible tells us about about I believe seven women who were Barren after uh six women were Barren after Sarah amen all of them they had to think about the same God Amen you will see that Rebecca after that the wife of Isaac amen she was Barren for 20 years amen Isaac went to prayer and he said that the god of Abraham Lord if you did it with my for my father amen and I believe that you are the same God to do it for me amen if my mom amen was buried for over 25 years amen you gave me Amen to them I believe that my wife amen will also be able to conceive amen after she was buried for 20 years and the Lord showed up and God gave her twins amen you will see that spiritual Jacob's wife him and after Isaac image she was also bearing for 14 years amen Jacob went to God and said that Lord I believe that you are the god of Abraham and Isaac amen if you give to my father's imminent children it may not believe that you can give me a child amen I believe that you can give to my wife a child amen he believed in that same God Amen and God gave him amen and God gave him a child amen you will see Hannah after that amen she started to pray and say Lord we usually pray the god of Abraham Isaac and Jacob amen all three patriarch amen amen all three of them amen they didn't they were bearing amen their wives were bearing amen you give them children it may not believe that you are the same God I believe that you are the god that God who will give me a child amen she prayed and she had faith and God showed up amen and God gave her a child amen you see that the white the mother of Samson amen the Bible said that she was bearing amen she prayed to that Lord word it meant to say that God if you did this in the past amen I believe that you are the same God Amen to do this today amen he said that if Lord be God Amen you I believe that you would do this for me too and God gave her Samson amen you have the sun of my woman amen she was also bearing amen she prayed to God and God gave her his son amen and when Zechariah came amen when Elizabeth and zakara came amen when the angel appeared to them you see that zakira doubted didn't forgive him from the for that amen because he knew that God has already done this in the past amen so you have no reason to doubt amen because that same God will be your present God will do that same thing in the present time amen that's why the angel punished him because he was not supposed to die to doubt amen God gave them the prayers they may God answer to their prayers amen the Bible says in Luke chapter 1 amen uh if I still can't remember that verse in my Luke chapter 1 the Bible says uh verse 13 the Bible said that by the angel said unto him fear not zicarious for that prayer he's heard and thy wife Elizabeth shall bear the son and thou shalt call his name John he said that fear not for the prayer he's heard amen you've been praying for a long time amen that God is not a god of ministry book amen he's the I am so therefore don't fear because he hasn't heard your prayer amen and the baby is coming amen fear not even for your your prayers your prayers are heard do not fear it man it doesn't matter if the situation I mean it's getting worse just don't fear amen because your prayer is heard amen God is not a god of History amen he's the present tense God amen he's the I am in Paul and Silas after after amen after the earthquake came and it set them free from the prison amen that God that good The God when he came to them he told them Paul and Silas if the Lord be God amen let him give me the same experience that he gave you what shall I do to be saved amen if that same God is real amen let me have that same experience let me have him at the Salvation amen Paul told him believe in the Lord God and you will be saved you in the house amen Paul never told him to quit smoking amen Paul never told him to quit drinking Paul never told him to to quit him and the sins that he was doing mayor Paul told him to believe amen because he knew that believing it meant faith is the key that unlocks all the doors amen faith is that thing that God requires that's why Paul said that you have to add to that Faith virtue amen you have to add to that Faith amen faith has to be the foundation of everything it may believe in the Lord God and you will be saved you are in the house amen and God is God tonight amen if the Lord is God why he did for others he'll do the same for you amen as long as you apply that same Faith the prophet says he said oh Brethren our religion is not a friction he said our religion is not a friction it's not some Santa Claus story it's a real living Jesus don't be afraid to put him to the test on his word amen he said that don't be afraid to put him to the test on his word because he will keep his word because he will keep his word then that's right he will keep his word I mean our religion is not a friction I mean it's not a science fiction story that people try to imagine and to create those stories in the Bible I mean it's not some Santa Claus stories it meant some lies and and some things that they make it just to make people believe amen but it's something real I mean it's something that happened amen it's something that took place amen it's real it meant to you for you to experience that same God Amen you have to put him to test amen you have to put him to tell him you have to test his word amen you have to do it that's why Elijah said that amen amen if the Lord be God Amen you will follow him amen Elijah came to them amen to ask the Lord to prove to them that God was God Amen he came to a showdown amen the Bible he said that Elijah told them to put 12 barrels of water in my 12 barrels amen is equal to 504 gallons of water amen it's a lot of water amen amen God had to burn that sacrifice in that water amen and God came to God did that amen Elijah had the faith amen because he knew it meant that same logos amen who was the pillar of fire that created the universe amen he knew that that pillow fire that spoke to Moses on that burning bush amen he knew that the same pill of fire that led the children of Israel out of Egypt amen he knew that that same Pillar of Fire that stood between Pharaoh's Army and the God's children amen before the Red Sea I mean he knew that that same Pillar of Fire that descended and and at the Tabernacle and talked to Moses amen he knew that that same Pillar of Fire amen will come down and will consume this burnt offerings amen will come down and will consume this word offering amen he had to have that Faith him and he believed amen the same God who showed up amen before when his people needed him the most amen he's the same God that will show up right now amen he had to have that Faith him and he had that Faith his faith amen was anchored in Jesus his faith was anchored in Jehovah amen and his faith didn't move amen that's why it didn't matter no matter how the quantity of the water amen he knew that God will still come amen that fire will come amen that fire will consume the offerings amen and the Lord showed up amen if the Lord is with us where are all the Miracles amen if the Lord is with us where is he it if the Lord is with us amen why are we still struggling amen we have to have that faith amen we have to have the faith imagine if we believe that God is with us is you God is God is here tonight amen whatever it needs that you have in your heart amen God will provide amen as long as you believe amen if you believe that God is with us whatever it needs that you have amen God will provide to win amen whatever questions that you have amen God will answer to it whatever prayers amen that you have been praying for it doesn't matter how long it has been amen God if you believe that God is Lord if you believe that the Lord is God Amen he will do the same thing amen he will do the same thing he did it with the woman who was losing blood even she had Faith even the prophet says that even though she didn't have any promise to lean on Amen but she had faith and with her faith she got her healing amen that's why you will see that when Jesus turned to the crowd amen Jesus felt that something had happened amen Jesus felt that amen amen another virtuous came out has come out of him amen that's what he turned he said that who touched me amen you will see that that same Jesus amen he spoke he said that Lazar has come in my Lazarus live again amen by the prophecy that when he spoke to Lazarus he didn't The Virtue didn't leave Jesus but the virtue left Jesus when that woman touched her amen because she had that Faith Amen to take the gift that was in Jesus amen to apply it to her situation amen she had that Faith to move that gift of healing that was in Jesus amen to apply it directly Amen to her presence to her present situation amen that's why Jesus felt that virtue come out of him amen because the father didn't tell him that that thing was supposed to happen Jesus didn't know amen that's where one eternity started to look in the crowd it meant to see who has touched him amen because that theachiman was not a simple church amen that touch was a touch of faith it means that touch was a different touch I mean it was a different kind of touch that could take the virtue that was in Jesus Christ amen to give her healing amen and she touched the the the Hem of His Garment imagine even yeah I had Jesus but she only touched the Hem of His Garment amen that touch was so powerful that made Jesus weak amen when Jesus looked in the crowd that Jesus knew exactly who touched her amen because something amen was going on in that woman amen Jesus felt that presence a man of faith and when he turned and he said that woman thy faith has healed you amen he didn't say that my face Jesus didn't say that my garment has healed you amen Jesus didn't say that I have healed you but he said that your faith has healed you amen as long as you have faith amen the prophet says that that Faith you can't apply it in the church service that Faith you can't apply it whenever in every moment amen that would take the gift of God Amen and I will lead it to your situation and you will have and your faith will give you the result amen your faith will give you the healing your faith amen will bring the Jehovah Jireh amen that Abraham has been talking about amen that Faith your faith will bring that God to your situation amen that God will provide right amen because when Abraham was going up in the mountain even the people didn't know that Abraham was prophesying because he said that the son of me were going to pray to worship and we will come back amen because Jehovah Jireh will provide for himself his sacrifice amen and he did provide for himself a sacrifice amen that Jehovah Jireh he's alive he's not dead amen the tomb is empty amen we don't serve a dead God Amen we serve a God who is alive amen but we just have to believe him and we just have to apply that faith amen we just have to apply it amen it's okay to test God amen amen uh uh uh what's the name of that short guy in the Bible the New Testament will climb the tree Zacchaeus he tested God Amen he said that if the god that my wife has been talking to me about if truly he is a true God he will know whatever I am amen he will know what I am it may he healed himself so that Jesus couldn't see him amen by Jesus amen knew exactly was it where's Zacchaeus Was amen he knew exactly where it was Zacchaeus Was Thinking his heart amen that's when when he came to where he was him and he stopped the exact same place where he was he lifted up his head and he says Zacchaeus tonight I'm gonna go and eat with you amen that was able to change his heart amen because he knew that that God nobody knew what I was thinking about amen by God himself knew amen and he started serving God amen if the Lord is God if the Lord be God Amen let him do the exact same thing that he said he was going to do amen if the Lord be God this morning this evening amen he will do the same thing we just have to have faith it may just have faith in his word amen it doesn't matter if the situation is getting worse of course the situation will always get worse amen the situation will not get easy imagine wait when the darkest is the when the darkest night amen that's when the morning comes amen amen Peter amen he was there by fishing for the entire night amen he didn't have didn't get anything amen the story tells us that Peter amen his mother-in-law was sick amen he had some tax money that he was supposed to pay amen if he didn't have that money if he didn't have the money that night and when he had to spend his entire life in prison amen he didn't do he didn't know where what to do amen he was in need of their money amen he wasn't that time that Peter couldn't find anything I mean it wasn't that time in that desperate moment that Jesus showed up and he said Peter I know that you've been fishing all night I know that you've been to that same place all night but I am sending you back Amen to go to that same place that you have been looking for money go and Cast Your Nest and this time it'll be different amen Peter looked at him and said but God I've been fishing this for my this entire night I've been to that same place I've you know Peter because Peter only knew two two things amen he knew how to fight and he knew how to fish amen because that's what he grew up doing amen he knew exactly if the moon is if the moon is full image that means that I will fish a lot if this happens I mean that there is there will be no fish amen he said about Lord the weather has not changed amen but because you said so amen by that word amen I will go back and I will go cast my neck because I know that you are the Living God and this time it'll be different amen he went back and again God's word and when he casted his nest amen and he had those fishes that he's been looking for at that word Lord whatever you say at that word because you said so amen this Bible is full of promises amen you just have to take one promise amen you don't need many of them amen you don't need 10 promises you just need one promise amen that you can lean on you just need one promise amen that's the body as Paul says in Hebrews chapter 4 he says that you just take one promise of the Lord and mix your faith without promise amen and you will see you you won't come short of it it may you take one promise and mix it with your faith you will see the result amen if we can do the same thing tonight it may not believe that God will come and God will give us whatever we need amen God will give us our prayers and may God will answer to our prayers amen because he is the Jehovah him and he is our healer image he's our protector amen he's a he's the Jehovah that strengthen us amen he is our father when we're fatherless amen he comes and he comes he's a counselor amen he come and he sent the Holy Spirit to be with us to always be with us amen that the holy spirit is that he's the the intercessor between between us and the God Amen if that Holy Spirit the prophet says that if you pray and you end your prayer in Jesus name amen he says that it's like Jesus himself going and praying for you amen it's just Jesus himself going and talking to the father and we know that every time in the Bible that Jesus prayed amen his prayers didn't go in vain amen God always came amen God always gave him whatever he was asking for amen if you pray today just pray in Jesus name just pray in Jesus name Jesus will take your place and pray for you amen and you will see the result amen you just have faith and you will see God God will show up because God is never late amen he's always on time the prophet says that he never misses not even one of his appointments amen he knew that going to to uh uh uh to the house that he will be mistreated but he went anyway he meant to show us that he will never miss an appointment amen even though he knows that he will not be welcomed even though he knows that he will be mistreated as long as you invite him to come amen he will always show up amen because he says that he doesn't want to give to his children amen a reason to doubt Amen to give him a say the Lord this man in the Bible called you but you didn't go in and God always go amen that's why whenever we call him wherever we'll call him amen God will always show up but for him to bless you there is a condition you have to make him feel welcome that's the key for him to bless you man that's why most of the time we call Jesus Lord come in the service and Lord come and man that fellowship with us the prophet said that God will always come but when he comes what we do we put him in the corner amen we put him somewhere nobody's taking care of him amen we put him somewhere no nobody's washing his feet we put him somewhere nobody even amen would notice he notices him amen he said that he will come with the blessings amen and he will look and were given to someone who will take care of him amen he will come with the blessings amen he will give it to someone who will take care of him amen that's what when we pray God I invite you amen you have to make sure that you take good care of him for you to be blessed amen God bless you we can't stand and song leader can come and give us a song amen Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus there's just something
