father lord is face to face with you may you speak to those jaws of clay we ask jesus christ [Music] amen um we just have a few announcements before we continue with the song so um we have a reminder of the family camp that's happening in michigan that is going to be the weekend of the um running from thursday the 12th till sunday the 15th that's that weekend in michigan so those who are still willing to go still open you can talk to brother isaiah and hear more of the details and then the following two weekends or the following three weekends which is the 29th of august these are special meetings in iowa city that's going to be on the saturday of the 28th and the sunday the 29th so on the sunday the 29th we are not going to have a service here in des moines we are all supposed to go and support our brothers so we can fellowship together in unity the bible says behold how good and how pleasant it is for the brethren to dwell in unity so i believe it will be a wonderful time of fellowship in the presence of the almighty god that will be um the church's fifth uh church anniversary so they'll be having brother ben and rod coming down for the special meeting so the saints from here in des moines it will be good for us to go down the in fellowship with them saying amen so let's just keep the series of meetings that's laying ahead of us in prayer amen let us sing this song as the deer painted for the water you know i started seeing this scripture differently when i realized that it's just not thirst the tea is just not rushing to the water for thirst but when it is hurt it runs through the water because that's where he knows he's going to get his salvation it knows that's when he's going to get healed after it's been ravaged by those wild dogs and everything it runs so there's a different kind of thirst because it's a life-saving thirst so if we have that kind of thirst knowing that whatever has touched you whatever has harmed you if you run to christ is that living waters that can save you amen the dear panted for the water so my soul [Music] longest [Music] [Music] blessing that christmas one more time oh yes as the day and that fall the water sold my soul [Music] desire [Music] may my spirit [Music] oh lord you're my friend and you are my brother even though you are a king yes lord i want you more than the other [Music] my strength and my shame you are lord does my spirit [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] and my ship to you alone does my spirit [Music] is [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] shall be amen let us write this song it says you are my strength strength like no other amen it is our hope hope like no other is our joy you are my strength shrank like no other strength like no water riches to me to your wall my swing shrink like no water [Music] in the fullness of your grace in the power of your name you left me up oh lord you'll lift me in the fullness of your grace in the power of your name you left me yes you'll lift me up [Music] you are my hope [Music] like no one [Music] you are my [Music] [Music] rich has to be in the fullness of your grace in the power of your name you left me up oh lord you'll lift me up your grace in the power of your knee you left me up oh yes lord love stronger than mountains deeper than an ocean [Music] stronger than mountains [Music] lord you lift me [Music] in the fullness of your grace in the power of your name you'll lift me you lift me up i'm feeling love stronger than mountains deeper than ocean reaches amen this is unfailing love is unfailing grace amen that reached out to you and me that's why we can stand justified because of his grace let us sing this song how great our art is ready amen [Music] i'll [Music] my soul my savior god [Music] [Laughter] [Music] yes [Music] god [Applause] i go [Music] [Music] hallelujah [Music] [Music] i my [Music] [Music] amen we're serving the only true and living god amen we surely thank god for his grace tonight we thank god for everyone here we're just going to get right into the word of god thank god for the musician song leader and all that works the pa system and all that good stuff so we thank god for his grace and his mercy god is good to us and uh we heard from my brother keith today he's taking a little rest some things uh he had to deal with physically so nothing major but it was necessary that he would miss tonight to regroup and recuperate from i guess the battle that he's now going through of course we know victory is ours and uh we thank the lord for that i'm just going to preach on a real simple subject tonight the power of prayer and uh we're going to ask that you turn with us to matthew the sixth chapter and then we're going to also preach excuse me on ephesians 1 1-6 amen the lord is surely good to us matthew 6. uh we're going to um uh take the scripture according to matthew 6 and it's always good to see brother abraham amen the father of faith amen we always uh say to our children one day those names going to kick in god has a purpose for naming us what who and what he names us amen so matthew 6 1-11 take heed that you do not your arms before men to be seen of them otherwise you have no reward of your father which is in heaven therefore when thou doeth thine arms do not sound a trumpet before the as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets that they may have glory of men verily i say unto you they have their reward but when thou doeth arm let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth the dying arms may be in secret and the father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly and when thou prayeth thou shall not be as the hypocrites are for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets that they may be seen of men verily i say unto you they have their reward but thou when thou prayeth enter into thy closet when thou has shut thy door pray to thy father which is in secret and the father which seeth thee and shall in secret shall reward thee openly hallelujah let us pray i'm sorry let's go to ephesians 1. just that quick ephesians 1. hallelujah thank the lord for his goodness and his grace and surely god has been good to us ephesians 1 we're going to begin at the first verse there paul an apostle of jesus christ by the will of god to the saints which are at ephesus and to the faithful in christ jesus grace be to you in peace from god our father and from the lord jesus christ blessed be the father excuse me blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who have blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ according he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world and that we should be holy and without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he have made us accepted in the beloved let us pray our dear heavenly father we thank you for your amazing grace we thank you for being so good to us lord and we thank you lord for keeping giving us what we stand in need of daily lord father you are awesome there is no god like you and we thank you father for choosing to share your eternal life with us truly we are unworthy creatures but we thank you for you not only being our maker our creator but also our salvation and we thank you father tonight bless the service in a special way as we commit the service into your hands in jesus christ's name we pray amen you may be seated this might seem like a simple subject but you know when it comes to prayer a lot of christians have problems praying it truly is not a difficult thing but we make it difficult prayer comes as easy as it is to communicating with human beings we talk to them they talk to us we call that communion we fellowship and sometimes we share our most intimate secrets with what we call friends prayer in itself when it comes to the new testament you'll find out that in the old testament you didn't find too many people praying the only time that they would pray was most of the time when they were in a desperate need when something was going wrong because you got to realize throughout the history of the jewish people they put all the prayer on the priest kind of like what people do to preachers now pray for me but we find out that it had become such a tradition uh among the jewish people they didn't even know how to pray and if you can follow me by god's grace you'll find out that prayer became traditional you know uh bringing it to to the jewish people you'll find out that they thought that god was only in that building and of course when they brought in the sacrifice you know the priest was there to pray for them and and you know do all of the you know works of it all the incense that represented prayer they symbolically would wave it over the people and wave it everywhere and so every time they had a need they would go to the priest but there were times when they didn't have a priest to go to and it was really god using those situations to show that prayer could be prayed anywhere sometimes people love praying standing sometimes they love praying kneeling sometimes they love praying walking sometimes people sing in prayer sometimes they you know like david he's song in prayer yeah thanksgiving and all of that and we realize by god's grace amen that prayer is in order for god to heal you it must be sincere he's not particularly care he's not particularly caring about how long you make it he wants you to be direct specific and he also wants you to have faith in your prayer and that he will answer your prayer when we talk about abiding in faith it means to continue without change so when you ask god for anything you can't go back and forth no matter how the conditions changes you must stand steadfast and so prayer like i said is is communing with god that's the whole point behind prayer is to share intimacy of intimate things or intimate thoughts or feelings with god and that's what we call communion communing with god is that all right as i said when it comes to prayer it's not the condition or the position you stand on kneeling is actually the condition of the heart this is what god looks at and some so sometimes when we we pray and and we've gotten into traditional things sometimes we get to praying and we gotta almost pray a sermon god is not interested in that and one thing for certain we forget that god already knows what you have need of and so we must realize amen by god's grace amen i don't think i finished matthew but anyway matthew 1 uh 1-11 we're going to we're going to go through that let's go back there because i don't want the devil to steal nothing from me all right that was matthew 6 and we again we began to to to read part of it but we didn't finish it all and we stopped at the fifth verse right that god once you go into your closet god will come around and i'm sorry fourth verse let's start at the fifth and without praise thou shall not be as hypocrites are for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the in the corner of the street that they may be seen of men verily i say unto you they have their reward and oftentimes we find even in the christian we find that people pray like that you know most churches you know your preachers almost have to tell them that's not necessary pray direct it doesn't take 30 minutes 15 minutes 20 minutes to do what you got to do pray direct because that's what god is expecting right we're not here to be seen of men we we want god to hear our prayer and this is what you know it's just something that people do and they it makes them look spiritual i don't know whether they intentionally do it but but they do it but the proper way of praying is first to acknowledge god and the bible said he that cometh to god must first believe that he is and that he is a reward of them that did until they seek him i was looking uh just the other day and just in awe and i'm thinking how great god is and he's so great i can't even comprehend them and i look at the stars and i look at the moon and i look at the sun and since i've been born every you know they're still in the same place doing the same thing and i've changed but they have not they still doing the same thing that they uh were created and purposed to do and i think about god how can anybody think that there is no god when things are so great around us you know what we can't heal nothing you know i mean we can't even deliver ourselves right everything is in the hands of god we used to sing that song everything's moving by the power of god and that's true i mean we see the chaos of of our country our nation and not just here all over the world guess what everything's moving by the power of god the word of god has spoken these things and they must come to pass you know what it is we must find our purpose where we where we stand and what we should be doing in this hour and often time that comes by prayer right because you remember even in daniel's time daniel began to pray and read the scrolls and by doing so he came to know his day this was my time to exit but oftentimes people don't know who they're praying to it's true you know they they don't they they say they're praying to god but they don't even know god they don't know who god is right and how can you com pray to him if you don't know who he is he's more like an idol to you but our god is a living god in acts 17 23 it says for as i passed by and beheld your devotion i found an altar with this inscription to the unknown god whom therefore ye ignorantly worship him declare i unto you see and you got to understand these people amen was so superstitious because remember in the 22nd verse paul says i perceive that ye that in all things you are superstitious you know and people find that you know they like that in the in you know you dream of dreaming you know what i mean or you see something that everything must be brought back to the word there's nothing wrong with dreams but sometimes people think that dreams they take their life you know direct their lives and in some cases they do but not in all cases everything must come back to the word of god right some people are so superstitious even in christians you know they're afraid of the black cat and you know don't step on my foot and you know all that kind of nonsense but they do it and and it's all because it's a an excessive fear uh that they have of gods like god is is here to destroy you he's going to judge you and he's going to kill you and he's going to send you to hell amen and you don't even know him see but let me say one thing about god my god gives every opportunity to every man to know him hallelujah and god never sends a man to hell man sends himself there by refusing uh what god's plan is you know we we you know sometimes you you hear people pray pray and of course we don't we don't have that here i don't believe but you know you have to almost go get a dictionary to understand the words that they're talking about and of course as if god is like that god is not like that and we're going to get there in just a moment god is simple right he gave us a simple language called english and we can talk to god like help me lord that's prayer when it's a sincere heart like i said prayer is communication to god you know prayer uh done by those who trust the power of the word and thought see you can't you pray to god and you don't trust his word you might as well forget it right you got to understand that you got to pray and your prayer must be according to the word and you must trust him right when jesus taught this to people because just to show you how corrupt prayer was and i read you the scripture how corrupt it was in that day when the pharisees or sadducees whoever they were in the marketplace they would pray oh lord this that and i'm gonna go to another scripture there in saint luke where the man says lord you know i've been this and i've been dead i mean and god said which one came out justified the man who smoked his breast is the lord i'm not even worthy to call upon your name see in order to pray to god my god you got to first know what he is and who he is let me tell you who he is he's god of all things he's the creator of all things amen he's the only potentate y'all understand me he's the king of kings and if you go back into revelation you'll find out the other kings had to bow to this king amen and that's what we are we must understand in order to approach god we must learn how to we must learn how to be clothed in humility god don't owe any of us anything amen you know i you know i hate to hear people say well god is not fair hallelujah who made you judge of god [Music] we ought to be so grateful amen that god has given us life i'm so glad god didn't make me a dog or a cat or a rat or a roach you understand me god made us in his image and his likeness that alone he deserved praise look at it jesus taught the people to say what uh the lord's prayer and and you say well what do you mean brother brooks listen like i said prayer is is is uh how can i say it it it composes of four things i know for certain adoration contribution thanksgiving and supplication you know what he says what do you mean brother books well uh when his disciples asked him how to pray he told him how to pray amen now we don't have to say that prayer verbatim but he showed us the order in which we should pray and a lot of times we go to god and says lord you know i need this i need that i need that and you're approaching a king even the natural man knows how to approach a king you're not going to approach a king and get some kind of results from that king if you don't come with the world right protocol first of all you've got to come with adoration you've got to tell the king how great he is and what he's done for the kingdom and what he's done for you hallelujah right you gotta let him know you re you recognize who he is oh come on you know i think it was abigail when you know her husband was the fool right and when she saw david she knew david was coming she didn't she didn't remain in her rags she went and changed her clothes i called them the garments of praise she went and changed her clothes came back and she she got all of the tithing all of the everything she can grab get it all and she met david and the first thing she she began to do was worship david he praised him she adored him she gave him alteration and and you know she confessed forgive my husband he's his his name is neighbor and that name means food right she she humbled herself in humility right because she knew david had a right to kill him and he had a temper here he had protected their land and everything else all those years now you got to understand folks david typed out god amen is that right somebody told me a little thing the other day and i thought that's awesome what if a man come to you and he says listen i have a job i i i want you to do i'm going to provide this job i'm going to provide the uniform the strength the days whatever i'm going to give it all to you and you know when when it's time to collect the money just give me 10 percent you can have the rest now i don't know nobody in here who wouldn't say i do it and that's exactly what god does he gives you strength he gives you the ability to work he gives you the hours to work he gives you everything and all he asks for when your check come is ten percent amen and we want to hold back on god huh come on what do you think the judgment will be when god sees that you have held back the ten percent help us jesus but god is good to us isn't it yes even you know like i said there are christians who do not even know who who they pray to just like that unknown god you'll be it's amazing how many christians say they worship jesus christ and yet jesus christ is still unknown because let me tell you something the only way that you can know him is to know his word amen he's known by his word his character everything he he is is in this word amen you don't read his word you don't know his word you don't read and study his word you have no intimacy amen hallelujah is that right because he told it uh even israel meditate on it meditate on the word when in other words keep it in your heart and your mind so it will be quickened into you right so you understand what i'm saying that's why practicing christianity is doesn't work if the word of god doesn't quicken in you to take control of you to make you do it it's basically vain it's the word that lives not you paul said it is not i that live but christ that lives in me so when christ lives in you that the word is active in you and it's subduing all of your enemies hallelujah let's turn to saint luke please 11 11-1 prayer is not difficult we make it difficult enter into your closet now some of us don't have a big enough closet but regardless reality he says enter here you understand me because a lot of times we think god is here he's in heaven the word of god says no no no he's not thee he's even in you he's now you even in your mouth we are the temple of god we are the temple of god and god is not far from us that we can't reach him or talk to him we don't have to have a 9-1-1 line you and i become one with god right now i'll say it like this even when jesus wasn't it was in the garden of gethsemane you think god was in heaven looking down at him like oh my poor boy he was in him man no flesh could have done what he did you understand what i'm saying the crucifixion in itself yeah there was a time that god left him but he left him amen when jesus said oh my god my god why is thou forsaken me now we don't know exactly when he left but when he became sin god had to depart you understand what i'm saying not not like we think the party is but that's the problem god said jesus took calvary as a man so we got to understand but he prayed you understand me he prayed and the bible said he prayed vehemently so much so amen the sweat of his brow became like drops of blood you know what i mean now he taught his disciples how to pray but do you think he was quoting our father who was in heaven no no no no he was direct he no no doubt what he was saying he knew the beating he was going to get he knew the heart the things that were going to take place and no doubt he directed those things at god he as a man talked to god directly and told god whatever he told him one thing he said lord let this cup pass for me he did not want to do it but the bible said at a point in time an angel came and strengthened him by way of prayer god never lets you fight the battle alone hallelujah you stay in god god will stay in you abide with me and let my word abide in you right amen we'll get there in a moment right let's go to saint luke the 11th chapter we're going to begin at the first verse and it came to pass that as he was praying in a certain place when he ceased one of his disciples said unto him lord teach us to pray as john also taught his disciples to pray see they didn't even know how to pray they've seen the pharisees and the sadducees of whoever they saw the republicans whatever however dramatic they were but in them something made them know that was not the way to pray and sometimes we do it i like to pray out loud i do but sometimes we i've heard people pray like god was dead he couldn't hear me and it's not because of your loud speech that he hears you like i said it's the condition of your heart right you say what do you mean i'm going to skip a lot of this but let me say like this it's like hannah hannah wanted a child and her husband couldn't give her one and she went into desperation she began to fast pray and when she was praying she went into the church the synagogue right which wasn't allowed for women to do that but she went in there and prayed and when you know when uh eli saw her he thought like what's wrong with her because she looked like she was out of order women had their place in that day but she was so desperate she wanted a child right and she was so drunk in the spirit that eli saw her mouth moving and no words coming out you understand me so sometimes your mouth can move but you're not praying with your mouth you're praying with your heart and when you're praying with your heart god has to hear you right and she began to pray and and then you know the prophet thought she was drunk see that shows you god don't show the prophet everything the prophet thought she was drunk she says oh lord my lord don't don't look at me like a daughter of a liar no i have a petition oh my god i have a need my sorrow my pain has driven me to this point hallelujah and then she told the prophet what god what she wanted and god spoke to the prophet said give her that son you see what i'm saying god always hear a repentant heart sometimes people think well you know the bible said god don't hear a sin of prayer well the moment you repent you're no longer a sinner see but if your intent is to say it's the sin and continue to sin god will not hear you and i always tell people i said don't you understand you can't hide nothing from god god goes into the depths of your heart and see the very intent of your heart before you open your mouth so why god didn't answer well why weren't you honest yes you know and this is this this is one of the ways people pray well lord i really want a new job and and i i just heard this so don't think i'm throwing off on anybody you know i i just heard this so i need a new job uh um but you know i want more time that ain't the reason why that ain't all the reason why right you want more money be directly god cause if he just give you a job don't be dissatisfied you want more money and you want a new job you got to be direct with god y'all know what i'm saying i'm sorry bro i didn't it just came out of my mouth but my point is you know when you ask god direct for what you need and want that's how god will answer even though he know you haven't been true true with everything you're feeling he wants you to tell it just the way it is right hallelujah it's funny to me because i didn't expect it to come and he said unto them when ye pray in our father which art in heaven hallowed be thy name if we could really see what the scripture is saying here because we always want to put him in heaven and paul said we are in heavenly places in christ jesus right it's somehow we want to distant him and if you've got the holy ghost you you shouldn't distant god he said i'm in you i'll be with you always into the earth i'm going to be with you i wonder i just wonder i would have loved to hear the prayer of jesus i would have loved it just to see how he prayed i'm sure he didn't say oh heavenly father distance no god was with him god was in him and i don't know how he did it but i know one thing he knew god wasn't far off y'all understand me whenever you're praying and god seems to be far off you are misunderstanding your understanding theologically is something wrong because god is never far off you understand me oh i got to pray up here no no no that's what the bible said who going to bring him down he's in you and you must pray like he's in you hallelujah you understand me and when i say this because you know we first must understand we must hallow his name and a lot of time we don't hallow his name we don't call on his name enough we don't listen the sinners use his name more than we do even though they use it in vain and you know mockery and stuff like that but we need to exhort the name of jesus and even in prayer thy name you listen to david when he sang and what he he always exalted the name of god always and then when you start praying don't go selfishly now i'm not talking about a time of desperation when you got a desperate prayer you're going to pray desperately right and and so when you when you understand what god is doing you got to understand amen that when you pray and you're praying that god is is doing a great work and god is doing a great thing for you you understand you connected with god he said ask what show whatsoever you will now how many of y'all believe that and it shall be given to you i i even in this prayer i'm thinking about how you know situations provoke you to pray did y'all know that hannah had a situation that was uncontrollable she wanted a man a baby and her her other her husband's other wife was making mockery of her right so what i'm trying to say is sometimes god will put you in a place he'll provoke you to pray but he can't get you to pray he'll make things happen just to get you in a place of desperation hallelujah now none of us none of us here tonight amen want to miss the rapture none of us but sometimes you know what i'm saying and like like i was discussing this with somebody else the other day that might have been my son but he was listening to the greatest battle ever fought and brother branham used ezekiel and saying god will only mock those that sigh and cry and and because he asks how many in here might have been my wife how many in here who you say you got the holy oats and everybody raised their hand basically and he says but are you signing and crying see you might have some but you ain't got enough you understand what i'm saying because your love for the world or your people amen must come out of you you know what i mean like esther esther saw she had a love amen for the people and she says listen if i perish let me perish but what we're going to do is fast and pray we're going to consecrate ourselves three days and three nights without food or water because we're going to bring our petition before the king see that's how it is when you're really desperate for god to answer your prayer listen you don't you you we don't want to wonder we want to know and and that's me i was telling my wife because i'm going through so many changes right now in my person and i said you know what i'm i'm fighting to be dead i want to die i want to die completely to myself and now that i want to i see so much of myself huh and i hate that but you know what i'm a winner he made us a winner right the bible said he has given us all spiritual blessings in christ jesus hallelujah i don't care how many times i stumble and how many times i fall i have a goal and that's making a rapture he placed that in my heart and there ain't no way of giving that up god help us right and he goes on to say listen one of his disciples said unto him lord teach us to pray and as john has also taught his disciples to pray like i said prayer have been so corrupted and a lot of time they thought prayer was uh you know the more you can give god the easier he would listen to you you know like if you were rich you got prayers through if you were poor well too bad for you but that's not the way it was god heard yeah i think about that man at the pool of bethesda he couldn't even get into the pool and brother branham said he was not the worst in conditioned person there but he had to be praying something on the inside he may never ordered his mouth but something touched god that made jesus christ go by that pool and of all the people that were there he chose that man to heal huh who prays pray something else and you don't like i said you don't even have to open your mouth you don't need to let the devil know what you're talking about come here here in your closet shut the door [Laughter] lord i'm feeling pretty good tonight hallelujah look what he says uh you know you know even even like i said um when it was demanded can you imagine this man says listen i don't try and every time i try the thing that i see about this man he had perseverance he wouldn't quit he abided in the faith he knew that that angel would come down and at some point in time it was going to be his day now think about the power of of this man's prayer whatever he was doing pulled the angel out of the water [Laughter] holly is that right because only god could heal and he here pulled him out now he's in the flesh the same angel that was in the water comes along and healed him he didn't have to walk in the water the angel walked to him which was christ himself think about it and when you can't get to a place and can't get into a place don't be discouraged god is on your side if you can really stay within the word believe the word take the word at its value god will never forsake you nor will he leave you yes yes you know i love how the psalmist said if i make my bed in hell thou art there oh if i fly to the most part of the earth you know if i go about up there thou out there that's a man with a real revelation that understands amen who who god is i believe that's what we we know but you know what as we learn we ought to share it with other people because once you understand that you know what i learned i think i told brother troy this the other day i think i've been telling everybody because when brother uh enoch out of all of the in a enoch blessed me and enoch said that he had been abused uh you know bullied is the word he said he used he said he's been bullied all of his life growing up in the message and in hardships and things and then find it out he was dyslexic and then on top of that amen he he come to a place amen that you know it was many times of discouragement right and the times when he fully wanted to give up and there was always something there and then they found out he was disliked they they showed him how to work it and now he's teaching doctors medical doctors that's what he said he said now he look back and he can say every prayer he ever prayed god answered see let me tell you something you either believe it or not god always hear your prayer the prayer of a righteous man availeth much hallelujah and when you pray but you gotta understand it's always in god's own time hallelujah you know when when you talk about thanksgiving i always love that scripture uh enter his gaze with thanksgiving it enter his courts with praise and you know when you when you do that you know you you're really making god feel good do you know that i mean when you think about a king and you're coming in there he's sitting in his chair however you want to look at it and you come in there worshiping him and that's one of the things i liked about the uh 10 commandments you know when uh when when uh they came in with all of the the the what you call it they done won the battle and joseph coming in and and that narrator like about he's been rallying it all rallied it off like i'm like i can see myself before god you're going to rally it off all the victories you ever won there'll be somebody to rally it off said he says that old windbag but the thing it was a good thing it was a it was a worship it was a praise and guess what everything joseph had attained by way of war and victory became the glory of sethi you understand me so i say this all that we win every battle we win becomes the glory of god because he is the king of kings hallelujah you know we can't allow ourselves i said to come into a place of uh pride for prayer because you find that god don't hear that it doesn't matter if you unless your your heart has to be right clothed in humility right humble before god and and one thing for certain whenever you pray even from this pulpit you must pray unto the lord and not to the people right that's why i don't like praying in public because there's always that battle somebody's listening to your prayer and you feel that enticing spirit that makes you want to switch channels you forget you're praying to god but you want to say it good enough so the people say oh you know he could pray that has nothing to do with prayer god didn't hear one eye order of that when it's not done in the right spirit hebrews like i said six and eleven like i said it said but without faith it's impossible to please him so all your prayer means nothing if you don't pray in faith for he that cometh to god you know every time i think about that and i i just i just want to i just want to ask him you know joshua how did that inspiration feel you you you all you knew was moses pretty much but you had a greater revelation that the god of moses was god you understand me because when he said son stand still the bible says never had had the creation hearkened to the voice of a man i don't know the scientific stuff behind it but one thing i know it stood still yes sir y'all understand me now you say well what do you mean brother books i'm saying if god could use joshua in a way like that under the blood of bulls and goats what about us who's under the blood of jesus christ oh we're coming to a test right now we're not what we're going through ain't nothing but we're getting ready to go through a real test and god is going to prove to you to to you whether you believe the word or not huh it's coming to that time listen and you know what you're not going to have more than likely you know i'll put it this way you're not going to have these times you know to pray like you want to especially not out loud you know what i'm saying you're going to have to go into your closet because they're going to forbid you to pray so you better know what you got amen right make a joyful noise unto the lord all ye land serve the lord with gladness come before his presence with singing know ye that the lord he is god it is he that have made us and not we ourselves we are his people and the sheep of his pasture enter into his gates with thanksgiving unto his core into his courts with praise be thankful unto him and bless his name for the lord is good his mercy is everlasting and the truth his truth endure to all generations [Music] the greatest compliment i think jairus could have given jesus was lord i know what it means to be a ruler i say to my servants do this do this do this do that and they do it he didn't even have to pray basically he says lord i know who you are you know the lord said he knows everything we need he knows he says listen i know who you are all i need you to do is speak the word if we come to god like he is god and he is rewarded of them that word diligently means you don't give up you are a constant right it's like blind baltimore's amen when they told him that that was the son of david and all the people around him saying shut up shut up shut up he says not today if that be the son of david hallelujah i'm going to cry the loudest louder listen jesus never heard his voice but he felt the pull you see what i'm saying you want god to fill the pool and when god fills the pool you gets this attention amen hallelujah is that all right now they say they didn't pray but let me say about the woman at the well she had to do something amen jesus was a prophet the holy spirit tells jesus go by samaria and jesus said to his disciples i have a need to go by there i don't know what she was doing maybe that night that night she couldn't take it maybe that night she was fed up we don't know what was in her mind but when you say a need to go by that means desperation something was getting ready to happen that's not written there hallelujah and jesus i've got to go there to rescue her y'all understand thee so when you're the seed of god god will never let you go god will never see you fail or completely whatever he will always be there i have need to go by whoo that lady that that lady went down in history she shook up a town just with her testimony hallelujah the one thing i loved about her though she believed the word she may have been backslidden but she believed the word she was tired of religion don't you get tired of religion let me tell you something religion will hinder your prayer right because religion will make you think you're not worthy to pray if you're under the blood you've got every right to pray hallelujah and let me say it like this if you've made a mistake the holy ghost is obligated and he will make you know you made a mistake and you need to get it right remember when the prophet of god lied joseph tell him i'm not here he did he was a man he lied his wife told him bill you know that he right and you know with that sensitive heart he had he must have felt like his whole heart had dropped to the floor he went and got because he tried to pray and hear the word you hypocrite right because he knew better the scripture says if you have an art get it straight if there be anything that's in your spirit that's going to stop your prayer make it right lay it down then come back to the altar that's what he says because a lot of times people don't say well god is not answering my prayer because you're not being earnest and true amen but when you honest and true god will answer every one of your prayers he may not answer it the way you want it but he will answer it you love the lord he said like i said you know it doesn't necessarily i'm just i'm going to be working on this for a while because i'm enjoying it and it just won't be my last this this is the beginning of something because i'm really learning something myself now we know by god's grace that prayer doesn't have to necessarily be long i can remember i'm telling you many times we're about ready to rack and we say jesus the car stops like almost on a dime anybody know what i'm talking about i didn't even say lord help me because he heard it it was in the name of jesus i didn't have i didn't have time to say all the words that i needed to say y'all understand me hallelujah think about it when it comes to religion like uh uh the old testament saints thought you had to be so pure and clean before god could hear you now i don't know jesus busted this uh the pharisees it says you know you you white is supplica you you you clean the and wash all the tombs and then you know you and the other one put him in and you're dead men's bones now listen to this now everybody trusted in them their prayers weren't going nowhere no wonder everybody was so sick and afflicted god wasn't hearing it because the ones who they trusted in was corrupt their prayers were corrupt and that's why they hated jesus because all he could do sometime he'd go in his closet open his eyes and boom there it was a person was healed or he says rise up and walk what where did this authority come from it came from the god that you're supposed to be worshiping amen right god hasn't changed he's the same god i believe with all my heart the closer we get to god the more we'll see the supernatural of god because jesus christ cannot change hallelujah i believe amen within my heart amen that everybody in this fellowship when we all we need is one amen and i'm going i'm getting there no matter what it costs you see and i'm not just praying for me i'm praying for everybody i just believe amen that god has something special hallelujah what you're going to say about the thief of the cross and everybody have their opinion about it but god heard this man's prayer the blood hadn't even been on the altar yet god heard his prayer he was a man i don't know what he was prior to that but you know what happened he humbled himself he clothed himself in the military and he was able to see and recognize we're guilty that's what he said listen you and me we're guilty we deserve this but this man i find no fault here was a thief examining the lamb and he says listen he's not worthy of nothing wrong no ill say he's done nothing can you imagine here he is on the cross worshipping the lamb and didn't even know it amen but oh lord when i go into thy kingdom remember me and jesus said you'll be with me this day in paradise i don't know how happy people were in heaven but when he got there i think he was about the happiest one ever [Laughter] knowing that he was hanging right over hell and god snatched him out see that's what i'm saying prayer in itself when you trust god see but the thing is you got to trust him you must trust him you must trust him turn with me now to matthew 5 6 please you love the lord i'm not going to be too much longer i'm just this is just a a prelude or something that i want to get into um because i really do believe that once this church began to pray like we ought to god will answer he's going to answer in a mighty way you know and that's that's what i believe and when i say church i mean wherever whoever its prayer is the key right because remember god didn't even send the deliverer to e israel until they got into the prayer mode when the task masters got hard on them they began to pray and they failed to see at that time that they were very they were in the scripture god had promised a deliverer after 400 years and they were there they were that generation so i want you to understand we're the generation that's going to see a change of the body we're the generation we've got to go through all that we've got to go through but it's all right as long as you trust him and abide in his word is okay this little suffering and things we're going through and we must all go through it everybody's got their own battle and i'm gonna tell you something you wouldn't want mine and i said like this i don't want yours every man must carry their own cross hallelujah i can't judge your situation and you can't judge mine because i believe with all my heart at the end of the day it's like a what you call those paintings yeah say it again mosaic you got all those little pieces together and once you put them together it's a beautiful artwork that's the way i see it that's the way i see it and now one piece is the same not one piece there's always variations in him hallelujah glory to god i believe in prayer but like i said the condition of the heart you cannot approach god and think he's going to answer your prayer if you have some bitterness in your heart anything like that that's going yeah you got to go get it right he's already answered it but you got to correct that right he the bible said he knows what you're going to ask before you ask so uh but but there there is like you said a provided way a way that he has provided for us before we can approach you can't approach can you imagine coming up before king and you all you got on his rags you're dirty and you're filthy right that kick you out you wouldn't even get close to him right like brother adam said you go into a law firm and you know you're on trial and you say to the judge what's happening judge they're going to kick you out you may not even have all the evidence everything you need to defend yourself but your approach is disrespectful right one of the things i i tell you what if you listen to brother branham when he prays he always talk about calvary he always talk about the blood of jesus you gotta you you're praying and you're not even talking about the blood of jesus you forget it you're not even approaching him right because the only way we can get to him is through the blood matthew 6 5-8 god be with us and when thou prayeth thou shall not be as the hypocrites are for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets that they may be seen of men verily i say unto you they have their reward but thou when thou prayeth enter into thy closet and when thou hath shut thy door pray to the father which is in secret and thy father which is see it in secret shall reward thee openly but when you pray use not vain repetition as the heathens do for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking be not ye therefore like unto them for your father knoweth what things you have need of before you ask hallelujah and he goes and he goes on and says after this manner therefore pray ye our father which art in heaven see you acknowledging him that he is your father we're talking about spiritually you know a lot of time for years when he would go and say give us this day our daily bread i thought it was natural i mean you know every time i prayed i saw a loaf of bread in my mind god is my witness to the truth the bottom two right but he's talking about spiritual food and due season the bread of life give us this day our daily bread our daily revelation what we need to make this journey huh now i'm going to say something to you all of you before i stop do you think god is creating us and making us into his very image to just take us to heaven no no no no we must show who we are on earth before we get to heaven it's not going to be an open show but remember jesus said in his own words there coming a time if you would say to this mountain be thou move it shall be done that's where he's bringing us into that adoption into that place where the word you become the word and the word become you right that god tabernacling in your flesh you have union you're union with him you're you're you're one and i know to the world this is sound blasphemy but this is what god is doing by way of this message and he took us out of organization and denominationalism so there'll be nothing hindering the growth of his children he set us free right hallelujah almost done after this man of therefore pray ye our father which art in heaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven and his kingdom has come yes and his kingdom is in you that's what the bible says it's not a meat and drink it's in the holy ghost right give us this day our daily bread listen and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors you can't go no further till that is done lead us not into temptation and i always thought you know for a long time god was leading me into temptation no no no no no he's keeping you from temptation basically that's what he's doing he's providing eyes to see that when you come into an area you can recognize the sin god is leading lambs right but deliver us from evil for thine is the kingdom the power and the glory forever and ever now god will bring you into places but let me say well okay brother but if if he's not leading us the bible says that god led uh is jesus into the into uh into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil now he put the devil there but he didn't lead him into temptation he knew the temptation would be there you understand me see don't make god evil the bible says god don't tempt and neither is he tempted so what you're going to do with that scripture you got to figure it out there's a revelation here right that god allows you to go places even though he knows the tempter is there but he's not doing the tempting the devil is so if you understand there's only two powers god power and the devil's power and if you recognize the true scripture you understand that now since calvary the devil has no power so you and i must understand that we've got all the power that we need we just need to tap into it and this power come by way of our earnest heart this is my favorite scripture out of all the scriptures in the world oh in the bible only the pure and hard shall see god and i know i can't make my heart pure but i know the purifier i know the god who can the god who will and he's protested made destinated us to do so amen is that right because the bible said only he can present us faultless before the throne of god [Laughter] and we are accepted in the beloved you believe those scriptures so when you are accepted and to be loved that means that you are everything in this book is at your hands not just at your hands but in your hands you got we got to believe in people and if there be any unbelief we must say lord remove the unbelief because the unbelief is sin and and i don't understand how he works completely you know but like he said who shall know the mind of god but one thing i know he's given us the mind of christ and the mind of christ was to be obedient to every word let's stand thank you just keep on praying for the lord is nigh just keep on praying hear hear your cry for the lord has time and his word is true don't keep on praying he'll answer you church keep on praying for the lord tonight just keep on
