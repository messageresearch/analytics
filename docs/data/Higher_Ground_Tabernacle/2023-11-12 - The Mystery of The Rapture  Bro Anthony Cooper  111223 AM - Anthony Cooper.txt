[Music] I'm not going to say much at all but by the grace of God we were so [Music] blessed thank God for allowing us to [Music] he brother we've known for years as I stated last he and I had lost contact with each other when we saw each other earlier we were young [Music] men uh so uh and think about this Liz Paul had uh a night of worship in Atlanta Atlanta and had not that happened we would have never reconnected so that was amazing those things like and I was struggling about going I'm so glad I did and I trust that our brother would have his Liberty this morning we're not going to let time hinder us so we want God have his way amen I told him morning anytime he get something from [Music] God preach it here my door is wide open and if you don't call me then I'm going to call [Applause] him let's say Lord Lord bless brother go wonderful to be in the midst of people that love the Lord I was standing there and I can feel the your praises going up into heaven last night I shared with you that we started in heaven heaven is not a strange place to us we even read the scripture said that when God came forth we came forth with him am Hallelujah Hallelujah Jesus said no man ascended up into heaven except he that came down from heaven so even though you're on the earth you have an Heavenly [Applause] connection amen amen amen I to was uh struggling to go to the the meetings ingia but somehow I made it through get past my own personal [Music] feelings andent I thought it would have been a service but it turned out to be a concert I'm saying Lord what am I doing here and then when I saw brother Brooks I said no I know the reason for me being here but even though we were young men there was a burning in our heart for all that the prophets have said to come to pass so I have decided and I know brother Brooks have made the same decision that we should sweep it to the resurrection and we today we are here now our hair is gray our voice remain the same because the voice do not grow old it's just the outside shelf but God hadn't for me to recognize him minute I saw him because out of all the ministering Brothers is the only one that I felt a kindred spirit and a and a connection that I know is of God but God kept us separate from each other but until the appointed time you'll had to be here to raise your voices to heaven to make all that the prophet said come to [Music] pass [Music] amen there's some there's some things that I may Rec uh recapt for those of you that were not here last [Music] night but all together I believe that you will be blessed by God's grace so I want to invite you to [Music] oh okay here we oh yeah 1 Corinthians 15 yeah 1551 behold I show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last Trump for the trumpet of God shall zound and the dead shall be raised Incorruptible and we shall be changed for this corruption shall put on incorruption Amen and this Mortal shall put on [Music] immortality so when this corrupt this corruptable shall put on the put on incorruption this Mortal shall have put on immortality amen then shall we brought to pass the saying that is written death is swallow up in Victory father we have read portion of your word we just ask that you would come unto us Lord through the office of the Holy Spirit and provide us with a [Music] content to the Tex we have read give us dear God edification that we may understand your word that we would understand how to glorify thy wonderful and holy [Music] name and provide us with the confidence that on that day that we can stand before you and say we have not returned on to Divo but we have accomplished that sent us to Reser gr this God and we and receive honor and glory for thyself we ask it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen May hallu amen is an an an encouraging Soul amen amen and I thank God for you being here is a blessing to me to see that you're here because you love the Lord amen amen amen you could be make the decision to go to be go any any any place else or do anything else but you decided to be here I appreciate you for being here now last night I was so excited that I forgot to introduce my family and there some of you here that here this morning it was not here last night amen so I want to take this time introduce my lovely wife [Applause] thank God she has been a blessing to me for 44 years bless all Lely three of them are here today [Applause] well [Applause] my and of course the one that holds up my hand me man that I can continue to fight this battle her name is [Applause] Charity feel I thank God but the family that God has given me and I thank them for being here to continue to encourage me to press the battle amen oh Hallelujah you sang a song earlier that about the Rapture saying that you were prophesying and [Music] something because the Rapture is very real the scripture that I have read speaks about putting on immortality but before we can put all immortality we have to be conscious of immortality but God had to send us the manifestation of the word amen he's not just a prophet Prophet he's much more than a prophet This Is He To Whom It is written I set my angel before your face to prepare your way for [Music] [Applause] immortality last night I was saying that when we came here born of a woman F we were placed in the systems of the world we had to go to school if not no the legal system within investigate while we are not in school these are all the systems that God did not set up but we were subjected [Music] to nevertheless God realized what we were subjected to so he had a s Elijah to prepare us to meet him in there it's just that Mal I don't call him a prophet because he's much more than a prophet those who see him as a prophet they he is a prophet to them he is a prophet to them but I see him as a manifestation of the word of God Amen because for him to be a manifestation of the word of God to say to you and I it is possible to become the [Applause] word oh Hallelujah but before that can happen we have to be conditioned away from the systems of the world God understood that we need to have a renewing of our minds because the systems of this world have conditioned our minds to think a particular way and not the way of God so malach took the word and and and and and planted in the field of the World Around the World this message have gone around the world to every country that there is so they would know that Jesus Christ is [Applause] Lord but you see like Peter said we are a pecular people amen amen oh Hallelujah here we go now when when Malachi 4 begin to spread the seeds of the word of God around the world there were good seeds it was it was the word of God planted in the hearts of the people am but it was only a planting it was not a harvest and after he have planted the enemy came and planted also he planted tears but you have to understand what is a tear amen Jesus said he could only tell then by the fruits so we look at the fruit to see what it produced then we know what was [Music] planted after Mal Malachi 4 was called home and going back into Glory there was another planting and we know it was the planting of the S by the serpent SE the Bible the Bible is not out of season or it's the word of God is still in effect to this day amen you look at the first time the seed that was planted other than the word of God was planted by the serpent himself amen and how did he plant the seed with a quote Yeah the Lord has said amen today they said the prophecy 58 years later there is nothing we just became Experts of what he said amen we could not it did not produce anything beyond that it made us intellectual wanted a spiritual being God said let us make man in our own image it was the only time that God turn to say let us let's come into an agreement in order to make a spirit man amen hallelujah and the reason why that we have to plant the word of God because the word of God has transforming [Applause] [Music] power it was the word of God that transform the universe that was void amen it was transforming power they said let there be light and transform Darkness into light it was not a quote and God decided that he would predestinate us not to quote we are predestinated to the word with transforming power amen oh Hallelujah hallu you see but Adam lost is been restored to us we are connected to Adam even though that we are the Seventh Generation we still connected to him so we so God had to show show us that the reason for the message the message came for us to put on immortality before we can put on immortality our hearts had to be turned to our fathers we have to have the right heart and our fathers had the right heart so in order for us to have the proper effect for the word to have effect we don't want to have the word of no effect we want to have an effective word we have to have a change of heart I share with you this morning behold I send you Elijah the prophet before the coming before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and He will turn your heart so we have to have a single heart one heart many of us one heart turn to our fathers plural and the Heart of of the children sorry that the heart the heart of the father turn to towards the children and the Heart of the children to the to their fathers Le he come and smite the Earth with a curse so we want to know who are the fathers what type of heart do they have amen do you love him amen oh hallelujah thank you Jesus now we know that Adam had fellowship with God on a daily basis is that right in other words God created Adam for the purpose to have with him that he could talk to Adam and Adam could speak back to him the angels of heaven created to worship God but Man was created to fellowship with God Abel understood that what caused the infraction that brought about a separation or or even broke the fellowship with God Amen to restore that Fellowship it would take God's life God innocent life would have to be shed Amen in order to restore the fellowship that man had with him amen and he demonstrated that by slaying a lamb that the blood of the Lamb can come back upon him because the the life of Innocence is in the blood it's been even John the Baptist said Behold the Lamb of God take away the sin of the world so he had to die with a sacrifice zth had the testimony of Adam the knowledge of Abel to live a life without unbelief Z understood With God all things are possible Enos inos in when the the multiplication of the sons of man on Earth and their corruption and sinful nature and how they transgress against God by making Idols of iron brass wood and stone which did not worship these Idols he know witness these things and begin to pray follow the name of God okay had the benefit of Adam testimony of his great grandfather the knowledge of Abel's sacrifice and death the understanding of all things of possible and and the prayer life which was ins inspired wisdom and understanding with knowledge and wisdom and knowledge and understanding he reigned over the sons of men spirits and demons and led many sons of men to the service of God all the days of their life you understand was taking place every generation was getting closer mahel Mel the son of aan Canan the Canan grew up under the influence of his father aan and live his life in the service of God all the days of his life every generation was having an influence of the other that's why we were charged to train up your children in the way they should [Applause] go they would depart from it that's where it came from Jared Jared Also Serve Also Serve God all the days of his life and he had a son Enoch Enoch Hallelujah Enoch Enoch was blessed with a good fortune of having his the for his forefather Adam but the fellowship of God and the privilege the knowledge of Abel's sacrifice and his understanding for the restoration of fellowship with the Lord God Z life of no unbelief inos pray life I can an inspiration of wisdom knowledge and understanding and with that wisdom is it sest he event some of the spirits of of of men bearing in mind that Enoch Soul was wrapped in the instructions of God and caus Enoch to walk with God amen and walking is Walking with God is predicated upon your soul being wrapped with the instructions of God last last night I explained to you that your soul is the mystery of God that he hid within you you not you you don't even know that in you is the hiding place for God's [Music] mystery even Jesus had to be predestinated amen because he was the first born of many Brethren he had to be an example to us amen and even though he was born of a virgin he still had to subject himself to the ministry of John John said Why come down to me when I need to be baptized of you suffer it to be so done it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness so he subject himself because he was showing obedience Amen to the word he was baptized with the Holy Ghost as he was walking out of the River Jordan is in that moment he realized that the Holy Ghost when pass his flesh when pass his Spirit into his [Applause] soul and with the quickening spirit of the Soul the soul cannot remain in the subconscious because the the life of the spirit have not enter into the soul and cause the soul to move from the subconscious to the consciousness of the Mind amen amen that was the mind of Christ amen am he knows what to do with the word that's in him amen and the word that was in him was onto us a childish a son is given the government shall be upon the shoulders his name shall be call wonderful C the Mighty God the Everlasting father the Prince of Peace he knew the contents of his own soul so when when Satan showed him the kingdoms of the earth and say you can have that all of it all you have to do is B don't worship God God don't bow down to No One others bow down to him amen amen amen Jesus knew that every knee shall bow and acknowledge that he is Lord so Jesus had to tell him thou shall not tempt the Lord th it is important you to know who you [Applause] are that's why he he sent Elijah the prophet because we just if you only see him as a prophet we are denying that the man man estation of the word of God manifest in day we're not talking about 2,000 years ago we talking about our day and he was the wave to show the power that you would have he was showing that he's not the only one the others are coming and you're here you're here to claim your [Applause] [Music] inheritance do you love him I decided to share some things with you last night that we blessed with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ understand that Jesus was not born Jesus Christ he became the [Music] Christ while he was walking out [Applause] River now the scripture is saying according as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy yes Without Blame before him in love having predestinated used onto the adopt unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to his good pleasure amen so we were predestinated as Jesus Christ was predestinated [Music] oh Hallelujah to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein we will accepted in the Bel in whom we have Redemption through his blood amen the Forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace amen our predestination is the grace of God to us amen am we in here abounded towards us in all wisdom and prudence amen have been made known unto us the mystery of his will according to the good pleasure which he had purposed within himself so that means that God will has to be made known to you I said God's will have to be made known to you is already already written in you you you just need to be conscious of what's in [Applause] you amen that in the thisp sensation of the fullness of times that he may gather together in one all things be in ch so that means that you have to be in [Applause] [Music] Christ it's not good enough to be in the message brother you got we have walk around this this for for 58 years and around we go where we go they don't know but God who would make his mystery well known to us know the Des the in [Applause] [Music] Christ oh we to say that is in Christ we have obtained an in inheritance being predestinated oh predestination let us know the inheritance God have for you so that the whole thing is you're not here by happen stance you here by divine [Music] order hallelujah hallelujah remember that your your Holiness is in Christen that means you be as holy as God himself is holy Jesus ask us to be holy even though Father in heaven is holy now he wants to gather all things that's which is is which is in

existence you understand what you place here on this Earth why are you here at this particular time you're not here 200 years ago 2000 years ago you're here now Hallelujah God placed you at the fullness of time for the restoration of Adam the restoration of Adam is tied to you what am I saying I'm saying the fellowship with God that Adam had carries to you it mean God wants to have fellowship with you but to have fellowship with him you have to put on immortality how do you put on immortality you have to know what is mortality to put it on you have to know where to get it put it on oh Hallelujah everything is TI to your soul the baptism of the Holy Ghost comes to bring the immortality that's in you to the consciousness of your mind when the when the immortality of the soul the contents of it is consciously in your mind you have put on [Applause] immortality the word of God is Immortal and you become the word of God you put on [Applause] immortality will pass away but my word will never pass away because the word is [Applause] Immortal understand immortality is a restoration [Applause] for those of you w your lastu I don't want you to miss anything amen but as I did them last night I do you the same thing I read the first verse after I do that you're going to stand to your feet and find Proverbs 8 and begin to read about [Music] yourself Proverbs 8 20 and 22 the Lord possessed me in the beginning of his way before the about you have to understand the deity is ordained to you so let's I want you to read aloud to yourself but the 22 verse here a minute wait a minute you're doing it again like last night you're just reading it because you could you know how to read where is a confidence you the Lord possess me you are the possession of God so then why are you sheepers about it you must be bold God possess you possession of God and act like it talk like it speak it hear yourself say it go ahead the Lord what a minute do you understand what happened

God is being fulfilled in such Simplicity eyes have to be anointed to see the Fulfillment of the [Music] word9 yeah 29 go ahead [Applause] you understand you were brought up with him do you understand that you read you are reading the record that you were with God before the foundation of it says that you were daily his Delight God was delighted in you why was God delighted in you God was delighted what caused him to be delighted in you he said that that did you came up when he came up why did you come up with you know with him what was it all about he was thinking the thought and he was expressing that which he [Applause] thought when he think the thought let there be light you spoke it let me just quickly read something to you I think it's in re let's go re Revelation the first chapter amen amen manyen oh yeah it say here and his feet like onto fine brass is that right and as as if burn in a furnace his voice as the song of many Waters and a and water is a type of the word it was you and I as the manifestation of the word speaking the thoughts of Our Father God thought it you spoke it I made [Applause] manifest God understood that you were subjected to the systems of this world and because you were because of your Amnesia you don't even remember speaking the world into existence and creating things that's that's in this world you created the creatures of the sea at least you spoke the word for for their creation you spoke the word for their creation you spoke the word for the creation of the the Beast of the field and you spoke the word for the creation of the birds of the air you don't remember doing that but that doesn't mean that you didn't do it and though the serpent SE triy to fill you with quotes of what God Said like serpent did Eve you have to prove that you're not like Eve am the difference between you and Eve is that your [Music] predestination thank you Lord your predestination made all the difference I say last night your predestination is God justification of you that you should be blessed with all spiritual blessings there is nothing that you should not have God even said that you have dominion what is Dominion the power of the spoken words the prophets prophets cuz the prophet is only that the word came to him but Malachi thought was the word himself and he said let there be a squir on the BR and there was right I give you salvation spoke the word for the Salvation of righteous before the doctor's [Music] hand touches my wife let the tumor be gone sun come out and Shine for 4 days power over the [Applause] elements I

amen amen and to see yourselves in the scriptures don't allow the things of this world to distract you from receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost Fire you don't want the Holy Ghost on your flesh you don't want the holy ghost in your spirit you want the holy ghost in your [Applause] soul that subconscious begin to overflow and travel through your spirit to the consciousness of your mind that the mind of Christ can take place in you hallu it is my desire for you to see yourself as the reality of the word I can only have that desire it's up to you to see yourself in the reality of the word you'll be able to do Mighty exploits be able to raise the Dead for 2,000 years ago they're waiting on you to come to that reality and to do Mighty exploit you created the universe and don't think it rubbery because you have to understand there is a Oneness because he said in that day when the word becomes a reality to you you would understand that the father was in Jesus Christ that Jesus Christ was in the father and that Jesus Christ is in you and when you have the mind of Christ you will recognize that you are in him and you would know that by the contents of your own soul the contents of your soul is your true [Applause] identity oh my no Enoch was the seventh generation from Adam and we are the Seventh Generation from Jesus [Applause] Christ you to understand all things have to be made known to you because all things were made by [Music] you I'm talk I'm speaking to you as you are in Christ am the reality of it must come with the baptism of the Holy Ghost in your soul that you don't get puffed up and start thinking I did this and I did that it was not so in the beginning amen we were in [Music] unison hallelu when the Rapture the Final Phase of it we will see that we have the same body as Jesus Christ had after his [Applause] resurrection I don't want I don't want to to have no water L but [Laughter] l oh Jesus amen but I thank God I have waited 28 years to see this day to me 28 is the time of life it's time it's time amen for your life to come forth but I I just want to strike something amen well I want to go back to to the text is it the Corinthians 15 is that yeah Corinthians some more amen said behold I show you Mysteries is that right amen we shall not all sleep but we will be changed Amen in a moment in in a twinkling of an eye for the last Trump shall Zone how do you know today is a sing of the last drum the last Trump The Trumpet Of God has to bring edification to your mind like we were saying last night the Commandment was given for for the for the angel of the Trump of God to make Daniel understand the message that was given to him and you have to understand the message that's given to you it takes the last Trump the Trump of God the prophet is gone between the last Trump and and and Mal the serpent seed came and S tears we just thought the tears was just a word in the in the Bible I we we thought the tears was a word in the Bible failing to realize that the tears is quotes to try to to convince you that is something wrong with you because you don't believe all that the prophet say but you need to understand who you are in [Music] Christ the Ser SE could not do that it takes an individual in Christ to show you how to be in Christ how the mind of Christ possible in you it takes someone to step forward and say you are a mystery of [Music] God it's not about learning all the quotes and they even claim to be floating on the quotes we want to be anchored in Christ Hallelujah Jesus said the two SE will be so close if it were not for predestination they would have deceived you God predestination of you prevented you from being dece oh Hallelujah it is the grace of God oh my Now understand that this corruption because it came through the desires of the flesh it became corrupted we were supposed to come by the spoken word amen and God sent a prophet to speak the word like he said Isaiah to speak the word for the manifestation of Jesus Christ oh hallelujah amen and once we we understood because Malachi 4 brought it to our attention that there has to be another Ephesians but we have to understand what is an Ephesian and Ephesians is the predestination of God made manifest Paul Paul didn't know he was predestinated he didn't even know God he thought he did until God introduced himself to Paul and Paul was shocked that God knew him and call him by his name he blew his mind understand God you know me who are thou Lord it is I Jesus amen he had to go down to Arabia for about 5 years or so is that right to to try to understand what he learned on gel and his experience on that day it took him 5 years to have the understanding when he got the understanding he said I didn't go up to J to to Jerusalem to those that were Apostles before me I didn't seek their approval amen he was so sure where he stood he say if an angel come down from heaven and say anything different I say let that angel he was that sure he don't need the approval of men approval from heaven I speak to you Gentiles in so much as I am the Apostle of the Gentiles I magnify my office oh Hallelujah he's that sure that's why I wanted you to speak the words with confidence be sure of your Christianity [Music] hallelujah oh my now this Mortal has to put what immortal but they can't put on [Music] immortality as long as the corruption is Al oh hallelujah hallelujah oh my my amen thank oh hallelujah amen oh yeah Colossians 3 amen Colossians I just want to just want to share something with you and and and release your little amen so that you get go on I know it's already 12:00 in and you and you probably start thinking that you need something to eat I think so oh yes thank you go to 33 for you are dead and your life is with Christ in God but you you have to die Paul say I Die daily that Christ may live it is not I that live it it is Christ that liveth in me Hallelujah as long that's why sanctification is such a prerequisite to the baptism of the Holy Ghost sanctification allow to go P your flesh and pass your spirit to go directly into your soul when you bring your human spirit in subjection to God's word is not your it's not your opinion but I feel this no you're not dead yet but I think you're not dead yet am you don't know how I feel you're not dead yet Jesus struggled he even spoke to the Tempest and show his power he healed the blinded ey make the dumb speak the cries walk but In The Garden of Gethsemane he said let this cup pass from me but in his second consideration he decide to surrender not my will but thy will be [Applause] done he was showing even in his lowest point in his own Humanity he could surrender hallu to the word of God you do the same there is power in surrender Your Surrender helps you to put on immortality immortality is Dominion because when you said when you were in in immortality you you said let you be light and the light is still present to this day and how many how long ago you that was spoken but because it was spoken by immortality in immortality it remains Immortal imortal God said to Adam the day that you eat is the day that you die Adam lived 930 years after eating of the the fruit of so God wasn't talking about physical death amen it was talking was what that day that Adam ate he lost his immortality amen he did it to demonstrate that God would make a way for Eve forever because she was born of his bone and flesh of his flesh because of his love for Eve he had to make a way for her to be restored so he placed his seed in her so God would not destroy her because his seed was now in her and if if God destroy her God would also destroy his seed made it possible for her life to be Satan get cocky proud Satan sat get cocky get proud cuz he know had a place to hold man hostage in the grave when John sent his disciples to Jesus to ask him are you the one that is to come or should we look for another he said told him take wait here a minute amen and he healed the sick and he raised the Dead the dumb speak the death here and he preached the gospel to the poor but he did to John's disciple he made them witnesses to him so they went back to John as Witnesses of Jesus Christ [Applause] when John heard it John got a confidence that he never had before he said oh death where is that thing where oh grave where is their victory cuz he knew that the resurrection of the life was on the [Applause] earth and to see that he the resurrection of Life first born of you and I amen Hallelujah and we will also have cuz he even said because I live you shall live also oh Hallelujah I I got to cut it off at some I got to oh hallelujah amen so you have to understand that you are the resurrection and the life as the scripture said you are dead your life is hid in Christ in God like I was saying last night in heaven you are in God on Earth God is in you oh Hallelujah amen I'm not young they used to be but I guess I got amen you all forgive me but got I got to amen I got to pause here for me amen got to pause let's pause let's just bow our heads the word pray Heavenly Father we just trust that the words that were spoken here today really bring about a change in the minds of those that hear it let them not be distracted by the things of this world let them see that the purpose for their life is not necessarily success of invisible the Rich Young Ruler was very successful in this world Jesus said what does it profit a man to gain the whole world and suffer the loss of his soul what is the loss of the soul the intent of that God of God's intentions for that life not to be made manifest for the soul to be void of manifestation because of the things that they gather in this world but let us wash our eyes eyes with Isa that and that we may see that which God has ordained for you and I let us take hold of our inheritance that we may be able to stand before God knowing like Paul said I fought a good fight I have finished my course so therefore live in heaven is a Crown of Life the crown of life is not for Paul only but for us that love his appearing and we thank God to be to place Us in this day to receive the message of Mal sent to us from God the message don't belong to God it don't belong to Mal the message belong to those that received the message because they are in possession of it and they're here to make it [Music] manifest so God's word did not come to this earth void so father keep us under the wing of protection suffering no harm or [Music] danger accidents or sickness any
