[34:28] walking amongst each other while they're
[34:30] marching
[34:32] back
[34:47] the anthem of the united states of
[34:48] america
[34:51] as good as the rest of the songs they
[34:53] sang once
[34:57] when they sung that song
[35:00] played that
[35:14] they took off
[35:26] the sacrifices that we take for granted
[35:44] to celebrate a day back in 1776
[35:54] when a group of men gathered together
[36:09] stating that these united
[36:23] and these men as they signed this
[36:25] declaration
[36:28] were signing their own death warrants
[36:37] and that declaration that they signed
[38:03] therefore he deserves all the glory yeah
[38:04] no he he deserves all the honor he may
[38:07] reach to do we deserve all the praise
[38:09] he deserves us to come in here with
[38:11] reverence
[38:14] to stand up on our feet
[38:44] to reach down into our own hearts and
[38:46] disciples
[38:51] he is the one that wrote the declaration
[38:56] whether you will be free or not poorly
[39:27] psalms 23.
[39:31] we're going to read
[39:37] read a statement by a great warrior
[39:40] on
[39:48] now as we're going to read all six
[39:50] verses of psalm 23.
[39:54] foreign
[40:06] he did not write this at the beginning
[40:07] of his journey
[40:15] he did not write this as a young man
[40:17] standing in the field as a shepherd
[40:35] [Music]
[40:43] as he looked back to the grace of god
[40:46] that followed him all the days of his
[40:48] life
[40:59] he was able to describe that journey in
[41:01] six short verses
[41:07] and through this you can see that our
[41:08] lord deserves all the glory
[41:14] verse one starts without sin
[41:17] the lord is my shepherd i shall not
[41:19] want.
[41:22] he maketh me to lie down in green
[41:24] pastures
[41:27] he left me beside the still waters
[41:32] he restoreth my soul
[41:35] he layeth me in the past of
[41:37] righteousness
[41:43] though i walk through the valley of the
[41:44] shadow of death
[41:47] [Music]
[42:01] he prepares a table before me in the
[42:03] presence
[42:09] my head with oil you want to eat my tent
[42:11] my cup runneth over in my coop
[42:15] surely goodness and mercy shall follow
[42:17] me all the days of my life
[42:21] and i will dwell in the house of the
[42:23] lord
[42:28] just before we sit down let's let's turn
[42:30] over to psalms
[42:35] psalms 107.
[42:39] verse 42 and 43.
[42:45] king david again
[42:50] begins to write and he says
[42:54] the righteous shall see it and rejoice
[43:09] even they shall understand
[43:30] [Music]
[43:38] we've been called into your presence
[43:42] every one of us having an opportunity
[43:43] second autonomous opportunity to
[43:46] whatever to bring whatever we will
[43:48] present unto you
[43:51] lord i just pray father
[44:03] for we going to give you all the glory
[44:05] and the honor and the praise
[44:17] in the name of jesus christ we pray you
[44:19] send yourself
[44:20] amen
[45:02] david as he wrote those six short verses
[45:08] every verse from that song
[45:11] was based upon an experience that he had
[45:14] back in his life
[45:44] young man
[45:46] we have older men
[45:49] there's all of you we have young women
[45:52] we have older women
[45:54] we have um
[45:56] children sitting here who have not gone
[45:58] through some of the deep trials of life
[46:04] but yeah they themselves have also gone
[46:07] through trials
[46:10] every single one of us has our life
[46:12] experience
[46:21] it doesn't mean that you're going to
[46:22] have an easy
[46:26] life every single one of us goes to
[46:29] those times
[46:33] where everything seems to begin to fall
[46:35] apart
[46:40] where you find yourself in places that
[46:42] you don't want to be uh
[46:46] you find yourself experiencing things
[46:48] that you wish you didn't have to
[46:49] experience
[46:53] and you look up and you begin to look at
[46:55] the promises of the scriptures
[47:00] and you say lord i need a
[47:02] fresh experience of those promises
[47:08] when you look at a promise in the
[47:09] scripture
[47:12] it seems like it's just a little bit out
[47:14] of your reach
[47:17] and you you wish there was something you
[47:19] could stand on so you could get up there
[47:20] and reach it
[47:37] god's children get to those places
[47:41] and it's not a strange thing that god's
[47:43] children get there
[47:45] this shows
[47:46] the shows um
[47:51] the bible is full of stories
[47:56] of men and women that are put in tight
[47:57] places
[48:02] where their own bodies were failing them
[48:17] or things that they wanted to do
[48:21] they wanted to go to the right
[48:24] parties
[48:25] but god told them to turn around and go
[48:27] to the left
[48:30] i like to think about jonah
[48:48] when he first began to it's not that he
[48:50] didn't know jehovah
[48:53] jehovah
[48:54] he was a man that knew jehovah
[48:59] it's not that he didn't know the
[49:01] scriptures
[49:03] oh no no he knew the scripture
[49:07] and it's not that he didn't know the
[49:09] voice of the lord
[49:12] because not only did he know who he was
[49:20] and he knew that he was a prophet
[49:22] ordained of the lord
[49:26] and he knew the voice of jehovah
[49:28] couldn't see
[49:31] but when their voice came to him
[49:35] and told him to go to the right
[49:38] what
[49:40] he turned around
[50:10] until you begin to turn around and look
[50:12] down inwardly in your own lives
[50:16] and as soon as you begin to consider
[50:18] your own ways
[50:20] and your own thoughts
[50:24] becomes
[50:38] we get down to those times in our lives
[50:44] god likes to put you in a certain place
[50:50] and sometimes he'll just remove his
[50:53] presence away from you
[50:58] you say god will do that
[51:01] yes god will do that
[51:04] you'll be going along for for a while in
[51:07] such a path for so long
[51:12] just enjoying the blessings of the lord
[51:18] and join the presence of the lord
[51:32] and the blessings are flowing down
[51:49] where did the presence of the lord go
[51:53] you open your bible and you're just like
[51:55] i i don't even know where to read
[51:57] it
[52:01] and you you go to the altar in prayer
[52:06] it seems like the windows of heaven are
[52:07] closed
[52:12] how did i get here
[52:15] how did i get to this place
[52:19] why why is like a jesus set on the cross
[52:24] my god my god why has that happened
[52:29] you know god's children get to those
[52:41] you're harping against the cry out for
[52:42] just a moment in the presence of the
[52:44] lord
[53:07] [Music]
[53:09] that's what samson sung as he is slaving
[53:25] he didn't give all the glory and the
[53:27] honor unto the lord inaudible
[53:31] he had forgotten where his his power
[53:33] came from
[53:36] and the very thing that gave him that
[53:38] power
[53:55] the moment he woke up he says i'm going
[53:57] to go out and win the battle just like
[53:59] i've always wanted
[54:03] to come when the enemy began to afflict
[54:06] him they can't leave
[54:10] he went to break those ropes that were
[54:12] tied his arms behind him
[54:17] [Music]
[54:19] every time he'd been tied up in the past
[54:22] yeah
[55:18] and the victories that he is to win
[55:22] now he is the one that was being
[55:23] overthrown
[55:28] as he was slaving away for the enemy a
[55:31] community
[55:32] [Music]
[56:14] begin
[56:16] [Music]
[56:27] where you begin to neglect the power of
[56:29] god
[56:33] you begin to neglect the the times you
[56:35] have in prayer
[56:39] you can begin to neglect the sacrifice
[56:41] of prayer
[56:59] [Music]
[57:02] to gain respect back for the presence of
[57:04] the lord
[57:09] when david was a man like that
[57:14] you know there is a reason that he is
[57:15] able to write the things that he wrote
[57:20] but in every trial that he had been
[57:22] through you know
[57:24] passing
[57:55] that he knew what his duty was and the
[57:57] power of god behind that company
[58:03] and that the power of god would win the
[58:04] battle for him
[58:48] unto the man whose soul needs to be
[58:50] restored
[58:55] and doesn't know that the lord is the
[58:56] one he needs to seek after and
[59:00] eternity
[59:02] ask anyone who's been a christian long
[59:04] enough
[59:09] who's been into the deep trials of life
[59:12] [Music]
[59:15] and tell you what do you do when you get
[59:17] to those places
[59:22] and they'll tell you an experience about
[59:24] how their entire body was failing
[59:44] and then they'll tell you a story
[59:48] about how the presence of the lord came
[59:49] into the situation
[59:54] that's how they took that situation they
[59:56] just put it upon the altar
[1:00:11] [Music]
[1:00:53] and no matter what you do you just can't
[1:00:55] seem to get to get the victory
[1:01:02] when you think back that there was a
[1:01:04] time when you were young
[1:01:08] there was a time when you were well yeah
[1:01:12] there was a time when you didn't have to
[1:01:13] worry about this
[1:01:18] there was a time where you didn't have
[1:01:19] to worry about this part of your body or
[1:01:21] that part of your body
[1:01:53] and we have a restoration that has been
[1:01:55] promised to us
[1:01:59] one of these days in a moment in a
[1:02:00] twinkling of an evening
[1:02:03] i'm gonna be changed
[1:02:06] and this mortal body
[1:02:10] shall put on immortality
[1:02:14] oh abraham experienced it
[1:02:18] experienced since a young man he'd never
[1:02:20] have been able to have children
[1:02:25] and then he had grown old
[1:02:28] and as he was an old man now
[1:02:32] god came into the place
[1:02:35] don't restore them back to a young man
[1:02:38] all over again
[1:02:42] and then god restore his ability to have
[1:02:44] children
[1:02:51] [Music]
[1:03:06] [Music]
[1:03:42] when the enemy is all around you
[1:03:46] that god prepares him a table
[1:03:51] where he can eat and drink
[1:03:54] and have supper yeah
[1:03:56] uh
[1:04:11] i don't know if i can find this real
[1:04:12] quick
[1:04:15] but in the back of my bible
[1:04:19] there's a place called the maps
[1:04:24] like and you know
[1:04:27] i don't know if you can see this
[1:04:31] but on this map right here yes you'll
[1:04:34] see
[1:04:36] the pink section
[1:04:40] is a section that shows about a thousand
[1:04:43] miles of geography
[1:04:49] it goes pretty much the entire middle
[1:04:52] east there
[1:05:06] the promised land is only like half an
[1:05:09] inch
[1:05:14] of this little pink area
[1:05:18] now this peak area is describing
[1:05:25] the the the middle east in the year
[1:05:28] 700 b.c
[1:05:38] and it shows the the the the boundaries
[1:05:45] of where the syrians had taken over
[1:05:48] almost the entire
[1:05:54] from the middle east all the way across
[1:05:56] down into africa and egypt
[1:06:01] on
[1:06:02] africa at this moment in time
[1:06:07] the map maker here has a little area
[1:06:10] around jerusalem
[1:06:16] it's just about two miles square
[1:06:19] [Music]
[1:06:21] do do miles uh okay
[1:06:24] it's a little circle that has no
[1:06:26] peakness in it at all
[1:06:56] and as they were marching and conquering
[1:07:40] and they had jerusalem completely
[1:07:42] surrounded
[1:07:46] and in the midst of this time
[1:07:51] it's the time of king hezekiah
[1:08:32] we have taken over every capital that
[1:08:35] you even know about news about concrete
[1:09:03] whatever the prophets of jehovah
[1:09:29] all that was left was this little walled
[1:09:31] city of jerusalem
[1:09:44] but then came a prophet of the most high
[1:09:46] god
[1:09:58] don't you fear
[1:10:00] nepal
[1:10:14] his eyes
[1:10:26] every every city within 500 miles of
[1:10:28] them any direction
[1:10:35] now the enemy had come and surrounded
[1:10:37] their cities
[1:10:41] but jehovah says i will fight
[1:11:16] trying to get out of there
[1:11:18] a stampede uh they marched they ran they
[1:11:22] fled they ran as fast as they could have
[1:11:52] now when a people has experienced
[1:11:54] something like that they call it
[1:11:58] experience they get they are to get to a
[1:12:01] place
[1:12:04] where they they trust in the lord so
[1:12:06] much
[1:12:11] it's like the time when peter
[1:12:14] had was uh was uh peter was going to the
[1:12:17] city of jerusalem to come
[1:12:33] so he went back to jesus jesus and jesus
[1:12:37] said uh
[1:12:39] you know gave him the little story about
[1:12:41] the taxes
[1:12:44] he said so that we don't offend these
[1:12:47] people
[1:12:52] so that we can pay this tax so we don't
[1:12:53] have money for it
[1:12:57] i want you to go get your fishing pole
[1:12:59] and go down to the river
[1:13:16] and inside the mouth of that fish
[1:13:20] there will be two coins for the taxes to
[1:13:22] pay the taxes one coin for me and one
[1:13:24] coin for you you are do do uh do uh
[1:13:29] do ps uh
[1:13:37] i'm sure he's thinking lord this seems a
[1:13:39] little strange
[1:13:44] it seems a little odd
[1:13:47] but he had seen enough
[1:13:51] it had enough experiences with the lord
[1:13:56] he had seen his god in battle enough
[1:14:08] that there was just something deep down
[1:14:09] inside of him yeah there's just protect
[1:14:11] your shoes or paw paw or
[1:14:39] when he saw those coins
[1:15:03] they come to those places where they
[1:15:04] just trust the lord is
[1:15:22] 107 verse 43.
[1:15:28] and it said whoso is wise and we'll
[1:15:30] observe these things
[1:15:37] even they shall understand the
[1:15:39] lovingkindness of the lord
[1:15:46] in psalms 107.
[1:15:51] there's four stories in here
[1:15:56] and each story is a story about someone
[1:16:03] who went through a deep trial passes
[1:16:09] to a point and they got to a point where
[1:16:11] they couldn't help themselves
[1:16:19] and somehow they got themselves into a
[1:16:21] situation
[1:16:24] where they could no longer help
[1:16:26] themselves
[1:16:30] and they got to a place where the only
[1:16:31] thing that they could do if
[1:16:45] talks about the children of israel
[1:16:49] in verse 3 it says and he gathered them
[1:16:51] out of the lands
[1:16:55] from the east from the north
[1:17:00] it says and they wandered in the
[1:17:02] wilderness
[1:17:06] they found no city to dwell in
[1:17:09] village
[1:17:12] verse 5 says hungry and thirsty their
[1:17:14] soul fated in them
[1:17:19] now think about they left egypt
[1:17:23] they were in slavery
[1:17:26] but at least their food was provided for
[1:17:28] them
[1:17:55] some of them are thinking maybe we
[1:17:56] should go back and trust in the
[1:17:57] egyptians
[1:18:02] we are in the midst of the camp there's
[1:18:04] always that witness
[1:18:08] they'll stand up and say no
[1:18:24] but the god
[1:19:04] they left the wilderness behind he's
[1:19:06] only seen
[1:19:18] and now
[1:19:21] all they realize that all the glory and
[1:19:23] the honor and the praise
[1:19:28] belongs under jehovah
[1:19:31] oh they couldn't sing that song when
[1:19:33] egypt was feeding them
[1:19:49] onto verse 8
[1:19:51] it says oh that men might praise the
[1:19:53] lord for his goodness
[1:19:57] for his wonderful works
[1:20:01] because he satisfies the longings
[1:20:06] he fills the hungry soul with goodness
[1:20:12] he does that saints he faces son he does
[1:20:14] that you face him he puts us in these
[1:20:17] places in our lives
[1:20:26] do we have a deep desire for something
[1:20:30] or
[1:20:58] it talks about those that are
[1:21:00] uh in prison or in sickness
[1:21:06] it says such a sit in darkness in the
[1:21:09] shadow of death
[1:21:18] [Music]
[1:21:19] says in verse 11 because they rebelled
[1:21:22] against the words of god
[1:21:41] oh
[1:21:43] they did something they shouldn't have
[1:21:44] done visa vision
[1:21:46] [Music]
[1:21:48] has brought them into afflictions
[1:21:52] and they deserve it
[1:21:55] and you can blame people for their
[1:21:57] trials
[1:22:02] because they deserve it
[1:22:05] but then when you begin to look inwardly
[1:22:07] regardless
[1:22:48] because when you think that you're
[1:22:49] standing in your own strength
[1:23:05] when we get to those places in our lives
[1:23:07] where we've done things that we ought
[1:23:08] not to do
[1:23:15] and we begin to pay the price for our
[1:23:17] own iniquities
[1:23:21] and the the payment for our iniquities
[1:23:23] comes back to us
[1:23:27] for the words that we said that we
[1:23:28] shouldn't have said
[1:23:30] since
[1:23:41] [Music]
[1:23:45] but when we begin to pay the price for
[1:23:47] our attitudes
[1:23:50] attitude then we begin to look up to the
[1:23:52] lord
[1:23:55] cry out to god for help
[1:24:00] and that's where it says verse 12.
[1:24:05] therefore he brought down their heart
[1:24:06] with labor illumina
[1:24:11] they fell down and there was none to
[1:24:12] help them
[1:24:37] [Music]
[1:24:47] oh that men would praise the lord for
[1:24:49] his goodness
[1:24:52] for his wonderful works
[1:24:53] amen
[1:24:55] for he has broken the gates of brazil
[1:24:59] he's
[1:25:00] cut the bars of iron
[1:25:04] people get to those places in their
[1:25:05] lives
[1:25:08] sometimes even because they deserve it
[1:25:37] and anybody that's been a christian long
[1:25:39] enough
[1:25:42] can't think about the sins that we've
[1:25:44] committed
[1:25:49] iniquities that we've committed
[1:26:21] fable brother brandon preach that sermon
[1:26:25] perfect strength
[1:26:32] by perfect weakness
[1:26:42] [Music]
[1:26:47] there was times he prayed for the sick
[1:26:52] and he didn't feel like praying for the
[1:26:53] sick yeah
[1:27:00] there's times he got there to preach
[1:27:02] sermons yeah
[1:27:44] would you pray for me
[1:27:48] and you reach out your hand and you pray
[1:27:49] for him
[1:27:53] and the next sunday they come to you
[1:27:57] and they say brother when you pray for
[1:27:59] me god healed me
[1:28:00] [Music]
[1:28:04] i thank lord despite of my own weakness
[1:28:11] make me a feminist despite my own
[1:28:26] even they will understand
[1:28:44] i love reading the psalms because i love
[1:28:46] reading about king david
[1:28:54] he was a man who had been through a lot
[1:28:55] of deep trials
[1:29:00] when you begin in the first and second
[1:29:03] verse
[1:29:06] he says i waited patiently for the lord
[1:29:09] and he inclined unto me and heard my
[1:29:10] cries
[1:29:15] amen he had a need but he waited
[1:29:17] patiently
[1:29:21] he had a need but he prayed in
[1:29:30] and then god in verse two he says he
[1:29:32] brought me up also out of the horrible
[1:29:34] pit
[1:30:15] withhold not thy tender mercies from me
[1:30:17] o lord
[1:30:20] let thy loving kindness and thy truth
[1:30:22] continually preserve me
[1:30:30] i want you to notice there are the
[1:30:32] tender mercies and the loving kindness
[1:30:39] i know i've preached on these before
[1:30:43] but david spoke often about the loving
[1:30:46] kindness and tender mercies of the lord
[1:30:52] and the uh when i was
[1:30:54] preaching on that several years ago
[1:31:00] i was looking down at what those words
[1:31:02] actually meant as you see the component
[1:31:09] and i was looking at the root words of
[1:31:11] what was david expressing when he said
[1:31:13] the loving kindness of the lord
[1:31:19] now if god has loving kindness
[1:31:23] yeah we know that he does
[1:31:26] and that he's given his loving kindness
[1:31:28] to us
[1:31:31] that belongs to us
[1:31:34] it's an inheritance for us
[1:31:37] and it's as i said in the beginning it's
[1:31:39] one of those promises that we can reach
[1:31:41] out and grab a hold of someone
[1:31:49] [Music]
[1:31:53] david had a faith here that god wouldn't
[1:31:55] withhold it from him
[1:32:08] is something that god has
[1:32:16] and so when god looks at us
[1:32:20] an emotion comes over him
[1:32:24] and that emotion is loving kindness
[1:32:28] and when he looks it up on us with that
[1:32:31] emotion
[1:32:34] it puts god in action
[1:33:06] you pick them up off the ground
[1:33:12] you feed them
[1:33:14] but then you go a little bit further
[1:33:16] than that
[1:33:17] [Music]
[1:33:20] you bring them to your house
[1:33:23] you let them live in your house
[1:33:26] and become part of your family
[1:33:31] you let them be your co-worker at work
[1:33:54] [Music]
[1:34:02] and you pick them up and put them on the
[1:34:04] rock right by your side
[1:34:06] [Music]
[1:34:09] and you make them a brother or a
[1:34:10] companion
[1:34:14] even when they don't deserve it ma'am
[1:34:16] call in the indesign
[1:34:39] and then walk away from us if we if we
[1:34:42] said why you do new well he picks us up
[1:34:44] and he adopts
[1:34:59] [Music]
[1:35:05] oh you're more than just a son or a
[1:35:07] daughter to me
[1:35:10] it comes in this last day and reveals
[1:35:12] unto us
[1:35:39] you
[1:35:43] well he has doesn't give us just love
[1:35:44] and kindness
[1:35:47] loving kindness and tender mercies
[1:35:56] as david was saying in verse 11 there
[1:35:59] become david this is the only verse he
[1:36:01] said lord withhold not thou tender thy
[1:36:03] tender mercies
[1:36:08] loving kindness and thy truth
[1:36:10] continually preserve them
[1:36:15] let's turn over to uh psalms 51.
[1:36:18] i don't know
[1:36:19] how
[1:36:29] or no uh psalms 103 psalms
[1:36:41] now we're all familiar with psalms 103.
[1:36:46] david here is rejoicing
[1:36:50] his heart is overflowing with praise to
[1:36:53] the lord
[1:36:56] and he is in such an attitude of worship
[1:36:59] and praise
[1:37:03] he begins to speak to his soul
[1:37:06] to his mind and to his body
[1:37:10] he says bless the lord oh my soul
[1:37:13] and all that is within me bless his holy
[1:37:15] name
[1:37:18] beneath bless the lord o my soul and
[1:37:21] forget not all of his benefits
[1:37:28] verse three who forgiveth all thine
[1:37:30] iniquities
[1:37:46] oh what are these tender mercies
[1:37:49] we know what the loving kindness is
[1:37:52] we know this
[1:37:52] is our inheritance
[1:37:54] something that he gave to us
[1:37:58] that he crowned us
[1:38:02] he gave to us an inheritance and as a
[1:38:04] crown
[1:38:09] the tender mercies of the lord
[1:38:30] but it's the type of crescent that a
[1:38:32] pregnant woman does
[1:38:36] when you see a woman that is pregnant
[1:38:38] she puts her hand upon her belly
[1:39:25] it because it don't fall in knee and you
[1:39:26] say this she holds in her arms she
[1:39:29] nurses it to help and he said
[1:39:32] and that emotion that that mother has
[1:39:35] towards her child is
[1:39:49] [Music]
[1:40:06] foreign
[1:40:20] and when he looks upon us and he has
[1:40:22] those emotions
[1:40:26] those emotions cause actions
[1:40:31] actions towards us
[1:40:33] that when we get to those areas in our
[1:40:35] lives
[1:40:39] or we go through our deep trials
[1:40:43] or deep desires of life
[1:40:48] we have the
[1:41:19] amen amen
[1:41:21] and whosoever whosoever is wise and will
[1:41:23] understand these
[1:41:26] comprehensive shows
[1:41:28] even they will understand the
[1:41:29] lovingkindness of the lord
[1:41:43] it causes the faith to rise up in your
[1:41:45] hearts
[1:41:47] like when peter was looking it was great
[1:41:50] went to go get that fish
[1:41:54] trying to show him something that down
[1:41:56] there
[1:41:57] said you know i don't think i will
[1:41:58] supply
[1:42:10] to go do something that will make you
[1:42:12] trust in me
[1:42:17] from psalms 107.
[1:42:21] those that have gone to those deep
[1:42:22] trials
[1:42:25] the last story there in psalm 107.
[1:42:35] it's uh written there in
[1:42:38] today
[1:42:43] verse 23
[1:42:46] talks about those that go down to the
[1:42:48] sea and ships
[1:42:53] they do business in the great waters
[1:43:00] they they see the works of the lord and
[1:43:02] his wonders in the deep
[1:43:05] wine

[1:43:08] don't resume now watch and
[1:43:11] verse 25 describes something that god
[1:43:13] does now
[1:43:18] he command us
[1:43:20] and raise us the stormy wind
[1:43:22] is
[1:43:30] now he's talking about the men in the
[1:43:31] ship here in verse 20
[1:43:34] [Music]
[1:43:36] and the ship
[1:44:04] it says as they go down again their soul
[1:44:06] is melted because of trouble
[1:44:14] their soul is melted because of trouble
[1:45:04] they're going up i've been in a boat
[1:45:06] like this on the great lakes
[1:45:10] and the waves came in
[1:45:14] and we're in this little sailboat
[1:45:18] and we went up and up and up on the wave
[1:45:23] and then all of a sudden you crest away
[1:45:24] and you start going down
[1:45:42] because you're going up for several
[1:45:44] seconds
[1:45:47] and now you're going down for seven
[1:45:49] years
[1:45:53] i think oh lord those ways to just crash
[1:45:55] right over and let me be done
[1:46:23] then they cry unto the lord in their
[1:46:25] trouble
[1:46:29] he brings them out of their distresses
[1:46:33] he maketh the storm
[1:46:37] so the waves thereof are still
[1:46:51] so he brings them to their desired
[1:46:53] heaven
[1:46:57] oh the men that would praise the lord
[1:46:59] for his goodness
[1:47:01] for his wonderful works among the
[1:47:03] children
[1:47:06] let them exalt him also in the
[1:47:08] congregation
[1:47:12] praise him in the assembly of the elders
[1:47:16] verse 42

[1:47:34] whosoever whosoever is wise and will
[1:47:36] observe these things
[1:47:41] even they shall understand the loving
[1:47:42] kindness
[1:47:46] these are the people that will come to
[1:47:47] this understanding
[1:48:16] where your parents feed you
[1:48:19] and provide for you

[1:48:27] sicknesses of life
[1:48:30] maybe you haven't experienced the deep
[1:48:32] sicknesses that come in life
[1:48:37] but the day will come where you grow up
[1:48:39] and you leave your house
[1:48:43] and trials begin to come it is important
[1:48:47] but it's at those points where you begin
[1:48:49] to realize

[1:49:41] almighty god
[1:49:44] and it's when you get to the end of that
