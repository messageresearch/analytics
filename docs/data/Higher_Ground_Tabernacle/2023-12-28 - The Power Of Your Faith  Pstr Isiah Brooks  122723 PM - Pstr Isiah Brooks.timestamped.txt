[49:12] we thank you for your

[49:17] mercies uh that you have given unto us
[49:20] we thank you for this time of worship
[49:23] praise and hearing of your word
[49:26] father give us
[49:28] Grace oh God to receive your word that
[49:31] it bring forth 100f
[49:35] life you be all the glory in your name
[49:38] Jesus Christ we pray amen you may be
[49:45] seated I entitled this
[49:48] message the power of your
[49:51] faith but I feel like it should have
[49:53] been
[49:54] entitled
[49:56] the mercies of of of of
[50:00] David uh we we we want to deal with that
[50:03] this
[50:06] evening but we we also want to to
[50:09] understand that no matter how much the
[50:12] Bible promis
[50:15] you if you don't believe it if you don't
[50:18] receive
[50:19] it it's not applicable to
[50:23] you you must apply it
[50:27] and this could only be the word can be
[50:29] applied only by
[50:32] faith now we are at the end of the
[50:36] journey and we know and
[50:39] realize that this is the last Church
[50:43] age there's not coming
[50:46] another the only the other the the age
[50:49] that uh comes after
[50:52] this is that Eternal age
[50:57] is the age of the
[51:00] Millennium but faith is the only
[51:04] thing that will get us out of
[51:08] here and we must
[51:11] understand that faith is the only thing
[51:13] that pleases
[51:15] God faith is not something that you can
[51:18] go buy from a
[51:21] store something that your preaching can
[51:24] give you
[51:26] the bible say that faith comes by the
[51:30] hearing hearing of the word of
[51:33] God it is a gift given to you by
[51:37] God the revelation of God in
[51:41] you is the unconditional Covenant of
[51:46] Abraham the unconditional Covenant of
[51:48] David and his
[51:53] seed it's is is is what we call an
[51:56] extending extended
[52:02] blessing the blessing remains with
[52:05] us the blessings holds us the blessings
[52:10] keep
[52:12] us like the Bible says it's not by power
[52:17] it's not by might but it's by my spirit
[52:20] say the
[52:22] Lord the thing that was happening with
[52:24] us
[52:26] now is that we are pretty much
[52:30] resting between
[52:33] revivals or at the end of
[52:37] Revival the the Pentecostal
[52:40] Church have had their great
[52:44] Revival and we know that when when the
[52:47] prophet of God was here was a great
[52:51] Revival but that
[52:53] Revival what we
[52:56] from we talk about what it used to be
[52:59] like and how God used to
[53:03] move but right now we must
[53:07] understand that the bride in
[53:10] herself must have a
[53:12] Revival now some people say that we are
[53:16] already in the bride's
[53:18] Revival and in some some expect that is
[53:22] true but the is of that that
[53:26] Revival brings you to a
[53:29] place this
[53:31] revival brings you to a
[53:33] place where you and I are in the very
[53:38] image of
[53:40] God every Revival before
[53:43] us could only give them a
[53:47] partiality of of an image the fullness
[53:50] of the image wasn't
[53:52] there even though the potential was
[53:54] there
[53:56] it was not yet time for
[53:59] it the seals had to be
[54:01] open is that right the son of man had to
[54:05] be on the
[54:06] earth the Thunders of God had to be
[54:10] unfolded and there had to be a bride
[54:12] that would
[54:15] receive seed that was planted Now
[54:19] understand this when the prophet of God
[54:22] was here he was sowing the seed
[54:27] but what the people were looking at they
[54:30] were looking at the
[54:32] seed as though it was a
[54:35] harvest Hallelujah it was not yet
[54:38] Harvest even though he preached the
[54:41] Harvest the Harvest was somewhat
[54:44] prophetic because there was a CR that
[54:47] was to come Hallelujah bilig sold his
[54:52] seed so his seed now we see those
[54:57] seeds manifested Hallelujah William Bram
[55:01] saw his seed Mal sold his
[55:05] seed was not his seed he only sold the
[55:09] seed of God it wasn't a hybrid seed it
[55:13] wasn't a mixed seed it was a pure seed
[55:16] of God we must understand Hallelujah
[55:21] when that seed was
[55:23] swn it was on good ground hallah in this
[55:29] generation The Pride will bring forth
[55:36] 100f this will bring for
[55:40] 100 because she had a pure word a whole
[55:44] seed not a half seed not a seed tampered
[55:48] by man
[55:50] hallu SE that God
[55:54] sld
[55:56] and what did he
[55:57] do he came to
[56:02] extend the blessings of
[56:05] David Hallelujah am and I tried to tell
[56:08] you this in just a moment remember he
[56:11] preached a message testimony on the
[56:15] sea during that time everybody was
[56:18] talking about the
[56:20] Revival what they just had with Jesus
[56:23] you see what I'm saying the walk the
[56:25] dumb talk the
[56:27] Blind and why why Christ slept in the
[56:32] boat
[56:34] came
[56:35] hallelu amen and the
[56:39] disciples that was in the boat forgot
[56:42] that Jesus was on the
[56:45] inside somehow they forgot who he
[56:48] was Hallelujah so when the storm
[56:53] increased y'all better hear what I'm
[56:54] saying
[56:56] when the storm
[56:58] increased seemed like they were
[57:01] blinded to their
[57:03] commission y'all hear what I'm saying
[57:05] because they were
[57:07] commissioned Hallelujah to pray for the
[57:10] sick dead to preach the
[57:13] gospel and and and he told them that
[57:17] every demon would be subject to them
[57:21] even so if you should drink any deadly
[57:24] things it shall not harm you Hallelujah
[57:28] we as Believers know that the Devil
[57:31] comes to
[57:33] steal and destroy Hallelujah so anything
[57:38] that comes your way to kill you to steal
[57:42] from you or to destroy you it's nothing
[57:44] but the devil and if you that you can
[57:47] have the I sight to see the enemy a far
[57:52] off you can then stand your position
[57:55] position Hallelujah and speak to the
[57:58] storm the stor must obey Hallelujah
[58:02] because when that storm
[58:05] increased the sails
[58:08] broke the ORS
[58:10] broke water start coming into the
[58:14] ship Jesus went and I mean Peter went
[58:17] and shook
[58:19] Jesus and woke him up but that's the
[58:22] truth if he's asleep your boat you need
[58:26] to wake him up Hallelujah shook him and
[58:31] said car thou not that we
[58:33] perish Hallelujah let me tell you about
[58:37] my God he never sleep no he Slumber
[58:42] Hallelujah they were looking at a man he
[58:45] was more than a man Hallelujah and when
[58:49] they awakened him the Bible said he
[58:51] stood on the H of the boat spoke to
[58:57] the and he said just a few words he said
[59:01] peace be still Hallelujah you see those
[59:07] things were
[59:09] actions and they were receiving the
[59:13] blessings of
[59:16] David y'all better hear what I'm saying
[59:19] he was called the son of David
[59:22] Hallelujah And that son of David carried
[59:25] the blessings of David
[59:28] Hallelujah but this was not just the son
[59:31] of David Hallelujah this was the son of
[59:35] God it wasn't just the Son of
[59:38] God he was God hallelujah and when the
[59:43] storm
[59:46] ceased they said to
[59:50] themselves what kind of man is this
[59:55] that even the wind and the Sea
[59:59] obey brother said they got it
[1:00:02] wrong he said they had it wrong no man
[1:00:06] can stop the sea no man can stop the win
[1:00:10] was God in the man Hallelujah he was
[1:00:14] more than a man because God was in him
[1:00:18] and the Bible said in him the fullness
[1:00:20] of the godhead bodily
[1:00:23] dwell
[1:00:26] move
[1:00:27] on you got to have
[1:00:29] faith and what's moving our way
[1:00:33] now will
[1:00:35] require perfect
[1:00:38] Faith what we're going to
[1:00:41] embrace in 2024 we have no
[1:00:46] idea we don't know what that kind of a
[1:00:49] darkness
[1:00:50] is hallelujah when the whole world
[1:00:55] it has become
[1:00:58] lawlessness and they work by the
[1:01:00] imagination of their
[1:01:03] mind Hallelujah the only light
[1:01:07] left in this world is the bride of
[1:01:11] Christ the only in the only sness in
[1:01:15] this
[1:01:16] world are those chosen to be lights of
[1:01:20] the
[1:01:21] world Hallelujah but the good part about
[1:01:25] this we don't have to
[1:01:27] worry we don't have to
[1:01:30] frat Hallelujah because the Bible said
[1:01:33] the Zeal of the Lord of host will
[1:01:37] perform
[1:01:38] this
[1:01:40] hallelujah oh
[1:01:42] yes when we talk
[1:01:44] about the
[1:01:46] government and y'all know how it is
[1:01:49] when women when y'all get
[1:01:52] married y'all take that ve
[1:01:56] and you put that Veil on that man's
[1:01:59] shoulder that means he's your your
[1:02:02] government and you are relinquishing
[1:02:05] your
[1:02:07] headship and you're transferring your
[1:02:09] headship over to
[1:02:12] him and he is
[1:02:14] saying in receiving it I will take care
[1:02:18] of
[1:02:19] you I'm going to protect
[1:02:22] you Hallelujah I will see that you have
[1:02:26] no
[1:02:27] need for
[1:02:29] anything is that the truth the Bible
[1:02:31] said he will supply your
[1:02:33] needs now you he can't Supply your needs
[1:02:37] if you don't believe he
[1:02:40] can Faith is the only thing that moves
[1:02:44] God if you believe his
[1:02:47] word he would fulfill his
[1:02:50] word
[1:02:52] amen I may have testified of this
[1:02:55] before but I grew up pretty
[1:02:58] poor my mother was illiterate couldn't
[1:03:00] read nor
[1:03:02] right but she was a
[1:03:05] Christian and there were times we would
[1:03:07] come short when it comes to
[1:03:10] food Hallelujah but I could remember one
[1:03:15] day because my mama knew I love to
[1:03:19] eat and she said
[1:03:21] Junior don't worry about it
[1:03:25] God show me he's going to supply our
[1:03:27] needs God will bring some kind of
[1:03:30] somehow God will bring some
[1:03:32] food I know this might sound crazy to
[1:03:35] some of
[1:03:37] you but it was I was getting ready to go
[1:03:40] outside
[1:03:42] play and when I went
[1:03:44] outside there on the back
[1:03:48] porch was about three to four bags of
[1:03:52] groceries Hallelujah
[1:03:54] it was one of the first
[1:03:56] Miracles I seen my mom spoke it
[1:04:03] and and to this very
[1:04:06] day we I never knew who brought the
[1:04:11] grocery hallelujah amen you know a
[1:04:15] little story that this one man was was
[1:04:18] uh making fun of this
[1:04:22] Christian almost in the same like
[1:04:25] man she needed some some groceries of
[1:04:28] some
[1:04:29] sort and the man heard the Christian
[1:04:33] praying and he said I'm going to fix
[1:04:36] her I'm going to go and buy some
[1:04:39] groceries and I'm going to knock on her
[1:04:41] door and give her the
[1:04:44] grocery and so when he knocked on the
[1:04:46] door to give her the
[1:04:49] groceries she said praise the Lord
[1:04:52] praise God for bringing me Fe this
[1:04:56] grocery he said God didn't do
[1:04:59] that he said I did it she said the devil
[1:05:03] might have brought it but God sent
[1:05:07] it
[1:05:10] Hallelujah that's right see it God will
[1:05:15] provide is that right come on it's the
[1:05:19] truth God uses the devil

[1:05:55] defeated his enemy in so many you know I

[1:09:06] sent a Prophet by his
[1:09:10] house even in David's
[1:09:13] judgment he was wise enough to know that
[1:09:16] he did not want to fall into the hands
[1:09:19] of
[1:09:20] man I got to have
[1:09:22] judgment the Judgment of God because in
[1:09:26] the Judgment of God I can receive Mercy
[1:09:31] I can receive Grace Hallelujah but when
[1:09:34] man wants to judge you he'll send you to
[1:09:38] hell when he himself need to be
[1:09:42] there it's the
[1:09:47] truth amen it's so
[1:09:51] amazing how that people don't know how
[1:09:53] to give Mercy mercies and Grace to their
[1:09:54] loved
[1:09:57] ones even to their
[1:09:59] enemies when God gave us mercy and
[1:10:02] Grace when we were his
[1:10:05] enemies before you became saved before
[1:10:09] you became a Christian you was the enemy
[1:10:11] of God and God even when you was a
[1:10:15] sinner gave you grace and mercy that's
[1:10:18] the only reason why we're
[1:10:21] here yes sir
[1:10:24] Hallelujah the mercies of the Lord is
[1:10:27] extended to the House of
[1:10:30] David whether be jew Gentile or
[1:10:34] Greek all
[1:10:37] mankind
[1:10:38] Hallelujah it used to be just to the
[1:10:42] Jews but since
[1:10:44] Calvary it's to the whole
[1:10:47] world than you Lord
[1:10:49] whosoever believeth in
[1:10:51] me though he would there
[1:10:54] yet shall he live Hallelujah I'm feeling
[1:10:58] good
[1:10:59] tonight Hallelujah Luke please Luke
[1:11:04] 126 28 I've got to tie
[1:11:07] this verses of David into Jesus
[1:11:12] Christ yes it's
[1:11:16] amazing
[1:11:18] luke6
[1:11:19] Luke
[1:11:21] 28 and in the sixth month
[1:11:24] the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto
[1:11:27] a city of Galilee named
[1:11:34] Nazareth now let me tell you something
[1:11:36] about
[1:11:37] Nazareth the name Nazareth means to be
[1:11:41] separated crowned and
[1:11:45] Sanctified but when Jesus came it was
[1:11:50] wicked Hallelujah so much so when the
[1:11:54] disciples heard that
[1:11:56] Jesus came out of
[1:11:59] Nazareth he said can any good
[1:12:02] thing come out of
[1:12:04] Nazareth Hallelujah but there was a good
[1:12:11] thing
[1:12:12] Hallelujah you were in
[1:12:15] Nazareth Hallelujah come on somebody but
[1:12:19] the point is I can't express you know I
[1:12:21] mean the thing is
[1:12:24] there was a
[1:12:26] virgin espoused to be a man to a man
[1:12:28] whose name was
[1:12:31] Joseph of the House of
[1:12:34] David and the Virgin name was
[1:12:38] Mary got to hear what I'm
[1:12:41] saying because this the mercies and
[1:12:45] Grace travel hundreds of
[1:12:49] years Through
[1:12:51] Time a B on a man named
[1:12:56] Joseph and a woman named
[1:12:59] Mary we've celebrated this Christmas
[1:13:02] thing you got to realize what was taking
[1:13:06] place God was positionally placing his
[1:13:10] seed hallel to make change in the world
[1:13:14] y hear what I'm saying blood of Jesus
[1:13:17] Christ is not here just to be another
[1:13:20] church she came here to bring change
[1:13:25] Hallelujah every time God did a major
[1:13:28] move it was to bring a
[1:13:32] change whether it be good or evil God
[1:13:35] always bring
[1:13:37] change Hallelujah now we in the Bible
[1:13:41] says and the angel came unto
[1:13:44] her and said Hail
[1:13:47] Mary thou that are highly
[1:13:51] favored is that right and the prophet of
[1:13:54] God said we're liken unto
[1:13:57] Mary Hallelujah so you must understand
[1:14:01] you are highly
[1:14:04] favor he said the Lord is with thee
[1:14:08] blessed are thou among
[1:14:11] women Hallelujah and as I preached on
[1:14:16] Sunday brought forth a
[1:14:21] child which means that the of God's
[1:14:24] bread she comes out of
[1:14:27] Nazareth with a bad reputation she had
[1:14:31] there even no matter how Wicked the
[1:14:34] world
[1:14:39] is somebody help me here but in this
[1:14:44] light it is a
[1:14:46] church God is
[1:14:48] producing and the same Christ Jesus that
[1:14:52] was born in a
[1:14:54] Manger as a baby must be born in the
[1:14:58] manger of your
[1:15:01] heart but once he's born he doesn't stay
[1:15:05] a baby he grows he
[1:15:08] mates Hallelujah he gets to the place
[1:15:13] where he's able to rightly divide the
[1:15:15] scriptures is that right because even at
[1:15:19] the age of
[1:15:20] 12 Jesus was preaching to the sadu
[1:15:26] could understand his widom because his
[1:15:31] wisdom wasn't given to him by
[1:15:34] man a theology
[1:15:36] school a do of
[1:15:40] divinity the thing he had that they
[1:15:43] didn't have was that God was his
[1:15:46] father with the bride of
[1:15:49] Christ have a
[1:15:51] teacher Holy Ghost he is the one that
[1:15:54] gives us
[1:15:55] Revelation the one that gives us
[1:15:58] understanding when we
[1:16:06] speak
[1:16:09] blesss
[1:16:11] Hallelujah Luke Luke

[1:16:33] you to understand when I get in that
[1:16:36] mode but I
[1:16:38] try I'm a junkie when it comes to the
[1:16:42] anointing oh my goodness praise the Lord
[1:16:45] for his
[1:16:47] goodness St Luke
[1:16:52] 13
[1:16:53] and his father
[1:16:55] Zacharias was filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:16:58] and prophesied
[1:17:02] saying blessed be the Lord God of Israel
[1:17:05] for he have visited and redeemed his
[1:17:07] [Music]
[1:17:10] people and have raised up an Horn of
[1:17:13] salvation for us in the house of his
[1:17:16] servant
[1:17:20] David as he spake by the mouth of his
[1:17:23] holy prophets which he have since the
[1:17:26] world
[1:17:29] began Hallelujah now now here it is I
[1:17:34] think it's in in Genesis
[1:17:36] 3:18 it talks about the seed your seed
[1:17:40] shall bruise the head and his seed shall
[1:17:43] BR and what was it prophesying
[1:17:47] of we we didn't know that that seed
[1:17:49] would be called the son of
[1:17:52] David we had no idea here the scriptures
[1:17:56] is taking us
[1:17:58] back he said this thing has been spoken
[1:18:00] by the holy
[1:18:02] prophets since the
[1:18:06] world Isaiah spoke of
[1:18:10] him Enoch preached about it y'all hear
[1:18:13] what I'm saying it just never ends it's
[1:18:16] from Genesis
[1:18:19] ration you can find Jesus Christ in the
[1:18:22] word

[1:18:26] there Hallelujah is that right Noah he
[1:18:29] was in Noah was in Moses Hallelujah that
[1:18:33] same
[1:18:35] life Hallelujah though it be
[1:18:39] imparted Hallelujah that's what the
[1:18:42] scripture said that what was done in
[1:18:44] part is done away with why because we've
[1:18:48] got the full love Hallelujah we got the
[1:18:51] whole thing
[1:18:53] we're not boasting it's
[1:18:57] reality hallelujah hallelujah thank you
[1:18:59] Lord they hated
[1:19:01] Jesus because when he said I and the
[1:19:03] father
[1:19:05] one they thought he was
[1:19:08] blasphemed Hallelujah and they wanted to
[1:19:11] Stone him and he said why why do you why
[1:19:14] do you seek to Stone
[1:19:16] me he said because you being a
[1:19:20] man making yourself God

[1:24:07] let me move on let's read the prayer of
[1:24:11] David answer from the
[1:24:13] Lord second
[1:24:15] Samuel 78-
[1:24:21] 29
[1:24:26] you love the
[1:24:29] Lord I see what David
[1:24:34] said 2 Samuel
[1:24:40] 718 then went King David in and sat
[1:24:45] before the Lord and he said who am I oh
[1:24:48] is that right who am
[1:24:50] I oh Lord God and what is my house that
[1:24:55] thou has brought me hither
[1:25:04] to and this was yet a small thing in thy
[1:25:07] sight oh Lord God but thou has spoken
[1:25:11] also of thy servant house for a great
[1:25:13] while to come and is this the man of man
[1:25:17] oh Lord
[1:25:21] God
[1:25:29] and what can David say more unto thee
[1:25:32] for thou oh Lord God knowest thy
[1:25:37] servant ET for thy word's sake and
[1:25:41] according to thy own heart has thou done
[1:25:44] all these great things to make thy
[1:25:46] servant know
[1:25:51] them
[1:25:53] wherefore Thou Art great oh Lord God for
[1:25:56] there is none like the neither is there
[1:25:59] any God beside thee according to all
[1:26:03] that we have heard with our
[1:26:05] [Music]
[1:26:13] ears and what one nation in the earth is
[1:26:17] like Thy people even like Israel whom
[1:26:20] God went to redeem for people to himself
[1:26:24] and to make him a name and to do for
[1:26:26] your great things and Terribles for thy
[1:26:29] for thy land before the people which
[1:26:31] thou redeem to thee from Egypt from the
[1:26:35] Nations and their
[1:26:51] gods
[1:26:55] list because he's confirming this is
[1:26:57] what he's going down in his prayer he's
[1:27:00] going through events you know he doesn't
[1:27:03] name them all but he's generalizing and
[1:27:05] basically saying God it's you who am
[1:27:14] I you have done all of
[1:27:17] this Hallelujah listen what he says in
[1:27:19] the 24th verse but thou has confirmed to
[1:27:22] thyself thy People Israel to be a people
[1:27:25] unto thee forever and thou Lord art
[1:27:28] become their
[1:27:36] God oh now Lord God the word that thou
[1:27:39] has spoken concerning thy servant and
[1:27:42] concerning his house establish it
[1:27:44] forever and do as thou
[1:27:51] said
[1:27:57] what is David doing he's taking the word
[1:28:00] and he's bringing back it back to
[1:28:03] God it and now as you said it let it
[1:28:09] be see that's how we have to approach
[1:28:12] God if you saw how God if you can see
[1:28:16] how David began to pray he started in
[1:28:21] humility
[1:28:23] he humbled himself before
[1:28:25] God yes and then he exalted
[1:28:29] God and then he he said God you have
[1:28:32] kept every promise
[1:28:35] Bally but now there's another
[1:28:38] promise that's laying here that we need
[1:28:40] you to bring to
[1:28:43] pass hallelujah oh my God 26 and let
[1:28:48] thaty name be magnified forever saying
[1:28:51] the Lord of host
[1:28:52] is the god over Israel and let the house
[1:28:55] of thy servant David be established
[1:28:58] before thee
[1:29:09] amen now I'm going to say this because
[1:29:13] of the world you know how the world is
[1:29:15] Israel and all of the
[1:29:17] stuff but throughout all
[1:29:20] ages tried to anoun
[1:29:24] them they can't do
[1:29:27] it cuz the blessings of the Lord is with
[1:29:31] them let me bring it down to the to the
[1:29:33] church
[1:29:35] now spiritual
[1:29:37] Israel and they've tried to destroy the
[1:29:41] church throughout all the ages the real
[1:29:48] Church
[1:29:50] hallu you'll
[1:29:53] know persecution is coming
[1:29:57] again amen hallelujah and even as the
[1:30:00] world turn against the the
[1:30:04] Jews
[1:30:07] Christians amen because the world don't
[1:30:11] want any morals
[1:30:14] anymore hallelujah amen and we are the
[1:30:17] salt of the
[1:30:19] earth because of your living
[1:30:23] God can't destroy the
[1:30:25] Earth but once the salt is taken
[1:30:32] away God will then have
[1:30:35] the the the space to
[1:30:43] move but let me say this to so you can
[1:30:45] see how blind the world will

[1:31:05] party is that right because they thought
[1:31:09] they were thinking they had defeated
[1:31:13] God true that's the word amen but you
[1:31:15] got to understand they're looking at
[1:31:18] Moses and Elijah as though they're the
[1:31:19] evil
[1:31:20] ones because
[1:31:24] they and they're believing that they're
[1:31:28] right that's what they did with Jesus

[1:35:22] whether you want to believe it or not
[1:35:24] Hallelujah your first world was in your
[1:35:27] mother's
[1:35:28] womb is that right God gave you eyes God
[1:35:33] Gave You mouth God gave you y know you
[1:35:36] didn't even need it there so you will
[1:35:41] Beed in your's
[1:35:43] womb come Hallelujah that's why you must
[1:35:48] be born
[1:35:49] again when you're born again
[1:35:52] formed
[1:35:55] inion
[1:35:58] Hallelujah to God Amen praise God
[1:36:02] hallelujah hallelujah that's right
[1:36:06] Hallelujah that's why we got to work
[1:36:08] these
[1:36:11] Supernaturals we're Bor
[1:36:16] Supernatural see what I'm saying let's
[1:36:19] move on so David wins addition no
[1:36:21] victories over the
[1:36:24] Philistines
[1:36:26] thees over the over the
[1:36:30] malachit over the
[1:36:32] orites and the King had I can't even
[1:36:36] pronounce it
[1:36:37] right am
[1:36:39] zah after which they
[1:36:41] become
[1:36:44] tributaries in other words David
[1:36:46] conquered so much till the the the the
[1:36:48] the little countries around him began to
[1:36:50] bring Tri to
[1:36:54] himid most
[1:36:58] important but that he made Jerusalem the
[1:37:01] capital of
[1:37:06] Israel
[1:37:10] understand Hallelujah and whether they
[1:37:12] like it or not it's still here you say
[1:37:16] wait a minute brother how can it be
[1:37:19] because this is just a
[1:37:22] reflection of what over
[1:37:24] Y what you cannot see is that the real
[1:37:29] Jerusalem is above it it's in another
[1:37:35] dimension Hallelujah is that right the
[1:37:39] Bible said when John saw the bride saw
[1:37:42] the New
[1:37:45] Jerusalem coming down out of Heaven is
[1:37:49] that right where he set it's going to
[1:37:53] set there where the old one
[1:37:57] is and who's going to take it away then
[1:38:01] hallelujah oh glory to God you think you
[1:38:05] love the
[1:38:07] Lord First Chronicles give me some more
[1:38:09] scripture just a little bit more
[1:38:14] timeon Hallelujah am the blessings of
[1:38:19] David my God
[1:38:26] God now I'm talking about Jesus Christ
[1:38:29] now not the David of the Old
[1:38:32] Testament but the son of David of the
[1:38:34] New
[1:38:35] Testament son of
[1:38:38] davidy
[1:38:43] on Hallelujah now therefore thus shall
[1:38:47] thou say unto my servant David
[1:38:52] thus said the Lord of host I Thee from
[1:38:55] the Sheep coat even from following the
[1:38:58] sheep that thou should be ruler Over My
[1:39:01] People
[1:39:05] Israel now you got to remember that the
[1:39:08] angel of the Lord brought this
[1:39:14] scripture because the same
[1:39:16] David David had to deal with same David
[1:39:21] had to deal with Hallelujah the same God
[1:39:26] is talking to him
[1:39:29] Malachi and have been with thether
[1:39:32] soever I have been with thee whether
[1:39:35] soever thou has
[1:39:37] walked and have cut off all thine
[1:39:39] enemies from
[1:39:41] thee and have made thee a name like the
[1:39:45] name of
[1:39:47] great in the
[1:39:50] Earth Hallelujah also I will ordain a
[1:39:53] place for My People
[1:39:56] Israel plant them and they shall dwell
[1:39:59] in their
[1:40:00] place and shall be moved no
[1:40:04] more neither shall their children of the
[1:40:07] wicked waste them
[1:40:09] anymore as at their
[1:40:12] beginning and since the time that I
[1:40:15] command the judges to be over My People
[1:40:19] Israel moreover I will SED all thine
[1:40:23] enemies
[1:40:24] am furthermore I'll tell thee that the
[1:40:26] Lord will build thee an
[1:40:29] house and it shall come to pass the days
[1:40:33] be expired that thou must go to be with
[1:40:36] thy
[1:40:39] father that I will raise up thy seed
[1:40:42] after
[1:40:43] thee th
[1:40:45] sons and I will establish his
[1:40:49] kingdom he shall build me in
[1:40:52] house establish his throne
[1:40:54] [Music]
[1:40:56] forever but then after
[1:40:59] Solomon Jesus even said what man what
[1:41:02] what house can you build
[1:41:06] me I don't I don't
[1:41:09] dwell in buildings that are made by
[1:41:12] man's
[1:41:13] hands is that right when it came to
[1:41:17] Jesus God said give me a
[1:41:19] body that's my
[1:41:23] and know ye not ye are the temple of
[1:41:28] God glory to God yes
[1:41:35] Jesus he shall build me a house and I
[1:41:38] will establish this house forever amen
[1:41:40] talk about God
[1:41:45] Jesus I will be his father he shall be
[1:41:49] my son amen amen and I will not take
[1:41:52] away my Mercy away from him amen as I
[1:41:55] took it from him that was before
[1:42:03] thee but I will settle him in my house
[1:42:05] and in my kingdom forever and his throne
[1:42:08] shall be established
[1:42:14] forever now I'm going to read this last
[1:42:17] part I'm going let you
[1:42:19] go
[1:42:22] that's what people don't
[1:42:23] understand the Key of David was not on
[1:42:26] his
[1:42:27] pocket hand but it was on his
[1:42:31] shoulder Hallelujah and that key that
[1:42:35] shoulder represented his strength and
[1:42:37] his
[1:42:40] power should be called
[1:42:46] wonderful what I'm saying glory to God
[1:42:50] but it is his
[1:42:51] shoulder he carries
[1:42:55] me he that had the Key of
[1:42:58] David this of course this is in your the
[1:43:01] church ages this beautiful phrase
[1:43:04] follows and comes out of the preceding
[1:43:10] phrase he that is true
[1:43:13] Christ perfect realization contrast with
[1:43:16] partial
[1:43:19] realization
[1:43:22] here it is Moses was a prophet of
[1:43:25] God but Jesus liken unto
[1:43:30] Moses David a man after God's Own
[1:43:33] Heart was king of
[1:43:36] Israel Jesus is the great
[1:43:42] David of every God now David was born of
[1:43:46] the tribe of Judah out of no priest came
[1:43:52] yet he ate of the
[1:43:58] shoad
[1:44:00] enemy establishing
[1:44:03] the as king he sat on the
[1:44:07] throne he was a wonderful type of
[1:44:10] Christ now it says in Isaiah
[1:44:16] 2222 key of the House of
[1:44:19] David lay upon his
[1:44:22] shoulder so he shall open and none shall
[1:44:25] shall
[1:44:27] shut
[1:44:29] open the spirit uses this Old Testament
[1:44:34] reference the Lord Jesus Christ and his
[1:44:37] ministry in the
[1:44:39] Church of David signify at that time is
[1:44:43] mere
[1:44:46] Shadow which is now fulfilled in Jesus
[1:44:49] Christ standing in the midst of the the
[1:44:50] lamp
[1:44:53] stand to our Lord after he
[1:45:01] resurrected
[1:45:03] pilgrimage but what does this key
[1:45:07] signify the answer lies in the position
[1:45:10] of the
[1:45:11] key it is not in his hand it is not worn
[1:45:15] around his
[1:45:16] neck is not placed in the hands of
[1:45:19] another man
[1:45:21] the verse could not be saying that he he
[1:45:24] alone was the use of the that
[1:45:29] key for he alone opens and
[1:45:33] shuts no man has the right but Jesus
[1:45:37] himself is that right but where is the
[1:45:41] key it is on the
[1:45:43] shoulder what does shoulder have to do
[1:45:46] with
[1:45:47] it 96
[1:45:49] says
[1:45:51] and the government shall be upon his
[1:45:55] shoulder but what does that
[1:45:58] mean answer is this the Pras government
[1:46:02] upon his
[1:46:04] shoulder wony of the
[1:46:11] East when the bride has been committed
[1:46:13] to the
[1:46:15] groom she takes off her
[1:46:18] veil over the groom shoulder
[1:46:21] [Music]
[1:46:23] signifying that not only is she under
[1:46:25] his
[1:46:28] Dominion that she has transferred her
[1:46:31] rights to
[1:46:32] him that he is the head but also he bear
[1:46:37] the
[1:46:38] responsibility and the
[1:46:40] care and that he and and he
[1:46:44] alone no one else no other man other
[1:46:48] power right
[1:46:52] responsibility and that belov is the Key
[1:46:56] of
[1:46:56] David God being
[1:46:59] Sovereign Knew by Divine
[1:47:03] decree
[1:47:06] his chose her did not choose him called
[1:47:11] her she did not come to her
[1:47:14] own
[1:47:16] for her in his own
[1:47:19] blood for
[1:47:25] herly committed to
[1:47:27] him
[1:47:32] ACBL Christ is the head of the
[1:47:35] church call Abraham
[1:47:38] Lord is
[1:47:44] happy she obeys for that is her Delight
[1:47:48] Hallelujah but have been but have been
[1:47:51] heeded this
[1:47:53] truth have they esteemed his person who
[1:47:56] alone has the full sov authority over
[1:47:59] his
[1:48:04] church I say no for every age church has
[1:48:09] been governed by
[1:48:15] hierarchy Apostolic
[1:48:18] succession closing the door of Mercy and
[1:48:20] Grace To whom it
[1:48:24] will and instead assuming love and
[1:48:27] responsibility of the
[1:48:29] church it it has had with mercenary lust
[1:48:33] prayed upon her and destroyed
[1:48:38] her in
[1:48:41] luxury poor Church fed on husk of
[1:48:47] abuse not one age did any different
[1:48:54] each bound itself to
[1:48:57] organizations put the
[1:49:00] government Church to that
[1:49:04] government let the people rise
[1:49:08] up and they were brutally
[1:49:13] suppressed every denomination has has
[1:49:16] the
[1:49:18] same every denomination that it has the
[1:49:21] key to the government of the
[1:49:24] church every denomination claims that
[1:49:27] it's open is the open
[1:49:31] door not true it is Jesus and Jesus
[1:49:37] alone he sets the members in the
[1:49:40] church them with their Ministries he
[1:49:49] put
[1:49:51] she is she is his solely
[1:49:57] property and he has no other one but
[1:50:01] heru I'm coming to the end what a far
[1:50:05] cry from the reality of the church
[1:50:08] age we
[1:50:10] live one day
[1:50:12] soon these men that even now purpose to
[1:50:15] speak for the church will be rising up
[1:50:19] in the a community
[1:50:24] move to place a living Antichrist in the
[1:50:28] head of their organization which
[1:50:31] disposes the Lord and we will find him
[1:50:34] we and we will find him Christ outside
[1:50:37] the
[1:50:47] church and that's Revelation three
[1:50:52] process behold I stand at the door and
[1:50:57] knock
[1:50:59] Voice open the door I will come into him
[1:51:04] and will St with
[1:51:07] him but let me say this our Lord is not
[1:51:14] defeated claim open the door to
[1:51:18] God
[1:51:22] Liars all that the father has given him
[1:51:24] will come to
[1:51:27] him him and no wise will be cast
[1:51:31] out he will lose none of
[1:51:35] them John 6
[1:51:39] 37-39 and when the last and when the
[1:51:42] last elected members to the body of
[1:51:45] Christ comes
[1:51:48] in Lord
[1:51:51] here the Key of
[1:51:53] David not David the king
[1:51:59] Israel and is not Jesus Son of David
[1:52:03] according to the fact that he was set
[1:52:05] upon the throne of David in the
[1:52:13] Millennium Hallelujah and Reign and rule
[1:52:16] over his
[1:52:18] inheritance
[1:52:20] surely so the Key of David
[1:52:23] signifies that it is Jesus who will
[1:52:26] bring in the
[1:52:29] Millennium he who has the
[1:52:32] keys death and hell will raise up his
[1:52:35] own amen that they may share in his
[1:52:38] reign of righteousness upon the
[1:52:48] Earth sorry
[1:53:00] how wonderful our Lord has all the
[1:53:06] answers in him are the promises of God
[1:53:11] fulfill truly by being in
