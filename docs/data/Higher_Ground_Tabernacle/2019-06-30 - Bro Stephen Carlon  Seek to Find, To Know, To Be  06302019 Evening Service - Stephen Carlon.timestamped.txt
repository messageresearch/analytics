[10:31] heaven right and so lord help us women
[10:34] when are this old body of ours tries to
[10:37] voice our voice our spirit you know it's
[10:41] amazing to think that we have a choice
[10:43] since of God to enter into the hope of
[10:46] joy of the world or entered into the joy
[10:49] of the Lord and it's amazing because I
[10:51] one time when I was in temptation and
[10:53] the Lord's I just heard the Lord say
[10:55] anchor into the joy of the Lord and it
[10:58] was just so convicting and it was like
[11:01] all everything just connected this all
[11:02] through the scripture to think that the
[11:04] joy of the Lord is our strength and then
[11:06] our ultimate reward is well done my good
[11:08] and faithful servant enter into the joy
[11:10] Lord forever and they're just all gives
[11:13] me goosebumps just know because I think
[11:14] saints of God the ultimate reward that
[11:18] we have is to get to the entry to the
[11:21] joy Oh Lord forever so to think that we
[11:24] choosing to enter into the joy of Lord
[11:27] for our strength and and for our delight
[11:30] that's our world daily reward amen amen

[11:38] all rested up and ready to dive in the
[11:40] Word of God amen

[11:48] what the Lord has for us this afternoon
[11:50] and so glad for the rich start us out
[11:53] with a testimony oh thank you in case I
[11:56] leave the pulpit

[12:12] praise God I also wanted to say you know
[12:14] I was talking to it that was it was it
[12:16] you were the rich we were talking about
[12:18] just all the different the buildings
[12:20] that y'all been in and just thinking
[12:23] about the hotel and then and then
[12:25] thinking about the Upper Room counting
[12:28] how it was it was one time that we were
[12:31] waiting for the lady to unlock the door
[12:34] to the church and tree nodding his head
[12:37] remembers that and we get up there and I
[12:40] think I could prob sometimes I felt like
[12:42] I could see my breath in there was that
[12:43] cold in the winter and I was just I was
[12:48] thinking oh Lord
[12:49] you know just to think that they were
[12:51] they were just just you guys are all
[12:54] praise in a way anyways no matter what
[12:56] what the cost and to think that there
[12:58] was a mega church oh my oh I'm not on
[13:03] okay thank you to think that that you
[13:09] know here in the midst of you know
[13:12] having a little corner and a mega church

[13:17] satisfied - praise the Lord and preach
[13:19] the word and listen and and to endure 40
[13:23] degrees I had to mean about 4045 degrees
[13:26] in there and by the end the service had
[13:29] probably got up to about 55 degrees so

[13:42] afternoon for their brother Jim and the
[13:46] Troy and his family it was just good to
[13:48] spend time I just ice like I said before
[13:51] it's just it's nothing when you can't
[13:52] spend time with a little bit of
[13:54] fellowship so we want want to always I
[13:59] was to do that I remember when I was at
[14:01] Honduras
[14:02] on a missions trip and I just conveyed
[14:04] that to the church you know and I said
[14:06] you know there was some young young men
[14:08] and I said oh I just love to take you
[14:09] fishing I'd love to just go fishing with
[14:11] you and well they heard that and I got
[14:13] my wish more than I probably asked for
[14:15] cuz here we go out in a rowboat boys at
[14:18] way and there was seven of us in a
[14:20] rowboat going on in the ocean at about
[14:22] nine o'clock at night and we were rowing
[14:25] out to the ocean for a boat about 40
[14:29] minutes and you know I'm thinking oh man
[14:31] who police if we sink we don't have life
[14:33] jackets wouldn't have anything you know
[14:35] it's just and I can't see anything in
[14:37] the water I could step on an urchin or
[14:39] huette whatever but you know we just we
[14:41] just endure it and we have a really good
[14:43] time and it was a good time of
[14:45] fellowship and it was just it just made
[14:47] me think more I'll understand more what
[14:49] the disciples went through a little bit
[14:50] on the sea so I'm just thankful for the
[14:55] fellowship around the world and anytime
[14:56] we can get a fellowship with a sense of
[14:58] God amen praise God amen
[15:04] so let's turn in our Bibles let's try um

[15:20] there there's oh we can just we get you
[15:24] out in one verse for a month of this one
[15:30] let's just start out with verse one
[15:32] Psalm 34 verse 1 why don't we all just
[15:36] let's just read it together starting in
[15:38] verse 1 I will bless the Lord at all
[15:41] times
[15:42] yeah let's to see you not say it out
[15:43] loud his praises shall continually be in
[15:46] my mouth
[15:46] my soul shall make her boast in the Lord
[15:49] the humble shall hear thereof and be
[15:52] glad o magnify the Lord with me and let
[15:56] us exalt his name for together I sought
[16:00] the Lord and he heard me and delivered
[16:02] me from all of my fears let's just ask
[16:05] the Lord's blessing on his word and I
[16:07] Heavenly Father we just thank you that
[16:10] we can come once again this afternoon
[16:11] Lord the feasts at your table Lord O

[16:19] brothers and sisters Lord we thank you
[16:20] Father for that Lord bless your word
[16:22] tonight Lord just may we be able to all
[16:24] be quickened by your Holy Spirit Lord
[16:26] this the seed that's going forth we just
[16:29] ask see be with us now in Jesus Christ's
[16:31] name Amen amen you may be seated
[16:34] I sought the Lord and he heard me and he
[16:36] delivered me from all my fears you know
[16:39] it's amazing how when you're when when
[16:43] you get to be 35 for the rich one day
[16:47] you'll get there that's giving no when I
[16:52] feel like it's Satan tries to mask you
[16:56] know like brother Branham says Satan
[16:58] doesn't change he just changes the way
[17:00] he comes you know and fears fears change
[17:02] and and how that you know it'll be just
[17:05] a little bit of just uh maybe just an
[17:08] uninsured Ness and really it comes down
[17:10] to fear and how that when we seek the
[17:13] Lord I really wanted to just preach out
[17:16] and I'm seeking to find to know and to
[17:19] be seek to find to know to be is that
[17:24] that we're finding rest you know we're
[17:26] all finding rest from everything from
[17:29] her from from fear from lack of peace
[17:32] from from the the the craziness of life
[17:38] I remember one time I was preaching up
[17:41] at Honduras I was just thankful the Lord
[17:43] could just provide for me to even go and
[17:45] it was up in the mountains drivin our
[17:48] drive in the mountains just beautiful
[17:49] the churches to a parked right on the
[17:51] edge of a Vista and you just look over
[17:54] the valleys you just think they would
[17:55] never have any problems here and I was
[17:59] praying and I just felt like the Lord's
[18:00] telling me preach on and quietness and
[18:03] confidence show me your strength and I
[18:05] say they don't need that they already
[18:06] have quietness here they don't need that
[18:08] and you don't hear after the service
[18:11] saying well yeah that was just a big
[18:12] struggle right you know for them housing
[18:14] for them wow what is it for us and we're
[18:18] we're not on the mountaintop we're not
[18:19] living on the mountaintop so just to
[18:22] know that that when we seek the Lord we
[18:28] have
[18:29] we have that rest where that piece you
[18:31] know be still and know that I am God and
[18:33] you even get to that point of stillness
[18:35] is seeking right what is it what does it
[18:39] mean the main goal of our lives is to
[18:43] know him and to be known of him right
[18:46] the Lord Lord I've done all these things
[18:48] in your name I never been depart from me
[18:51] you workers of iniquity I never knew you
[18:53] so it's that seeking and did to get
[18:58] ahead of myself
[18:59] it's what's so wonderful about seeking
[19:01] the Lord is we have the best example of
[19:04] what seeking should look like because he
[19:07] sought us first right and so what out
[19:10] what a wonderful beautiful Savior we
[19:12] have that sought us out and so that we
[19:16] could see that example that as David
[19:19] said in Psalms 139 well though I made my
[19:22] bed in hell you're there with me and you
[19:26] know how hard it is when you're
[19:27] following a loved one into the hell of
[19:30] their lives and how uncomfortable it is
[19:33] to seek after them and to think wow the
[19:36] Lord did that for us and oh we have the
[19:39] benefit that we're when we seek after
[19:41] him it's only the uncomfortability of
[19:44] our flesh that we have to deal with
[19:46] rather than that we are are going into a
[19:50] place that is uncomfortably bad it's a
[19:52] it's such an uplifting and just like
[19:55] I've heard some some old gospel singers
[19:57] say he's been better to us than we've
[19:58] been to ourselves amen
[20:03] well my favorite scripture verses Psalm
[20:06] 17 15 I I will see your face in
[20:11] righteousness I will be satisfied when I
[20:13] awake with eye likeness and I will hold
[20:18] thy face and righteousness excuse me I
[20:20] will be satisfied when I awake with eye
[20:22] likeness and that's my heart and I know
[20:24] that's each one of your heart tonight
[20:25] it's to one day we'll wake up and
[20:28] instead of looking in the mirror and it
[20:30] would just say oh dear there is Stephen
[20:32] again well praise God I'm a son of God
[20:35] on the inside to say will awake with his
[20:37] likeness amen
[20:41] him all that he is his kingdom his laws
[20:44] his commandments his precepts as
[20:46] judgments everything of his likeness
[20:48] Amon gallo Sevilla Keith did you are
[20:53] seeking to find and to know and to be we
[20:57] know it's not of works are seeking lest
[21:01] any man should boast
[21:02] but it's a but it also says ask seek
[21:06] knock write and you shall find
[21:10] so it's this it how how do we do this
[21:13] because again it's works versus faith
[21:16] right but yet it's interesting because
[21:19] we if we can dive into the meanings of
[21:22] things um seek as Darach and in the
[21:25] Hebrew and it because and first you need
[21:31] eyes to see so it's there's um there's
[21:37] an also word means it means to gaze upon
[21:40] her to be seen to appear then you need
[21:43] light to make things visible so you
[21:45] notice how even in Genesis when in order
[21:48] for us to even see him just the beauty
[21:51] of everything was was played out in
[21:52] exact the right order I'm even him
[21:55] ordering everything to be made the first
[21:57] thing he did or if he said let there be
[22:00] God and we would say ok I can't see a
[22:04] thing I can't see my hand in front of my
[22:06] face where are you we would we wouldn't
[22:09] know where he was so the first thing he
[22:10] did was say let there be light and so
[22:15] that that we could see the first thing
[22:16] is that manifestation of him as light
[22:19] and it's and so to think that he put
[22:22] himself there so we can be seen and I
[22:25] always like to break it up you know let
[22:26] which is we were talking about this
[22:28] little means to not prevent her forbid
[22:30] there you know on space time and matter
[22:33] be exist light God and everything that
[22:38] is him and so and then you need and you
[22:43] need light to make things visible so we
[22:45] can't see the invisible God without his
[22:48] light
[22:48] you know spiritually I mean I we could
[22:51] say but then also to think that you know
[22:53] isn't it
[22:54] and how this the sunlight actually lit
[22:57] physical little manifested the Sun and
[23:01] the light in the light of the eye so
[23:03] when you know how to think that you know
[23:05] again this is God it's a great drama so
[23:07] he's he's doing the set design he's
[23:08] doing the lighting and he's he's putting
[23:10] him right there for us is that he he's
[23:20] I'm sorry I'm just trying to get my
[23:21] thoughts together please forgive me
[23:23] is that everything thought out the word
[23:26] even in seeking is the word behold just
[23:29] like David said in Psalm 17 is that ever
[23:32] thought about that is like what we look
[23:34] at is what would become so you think
[23:36] well seeking isn't is just digging in
[23:38] the dirt for nuggets but even thinking
[23:40] about that we're we're beholding his
[23:41] face you know just like we were talking
[23:43] about in this room this morning David
[23:46] said you know the Lord said unto me seek
[23:48] my face and and I said unto Him Lord I
[23:52] fit my thy face I will seek and it's
[23:55] interesting that there's the beholding
[23:57] that beholding cuz you think about what
[23:59] is it what are the two words there be
[24:01] which is exist and hold
[24:03] so we exists holding and then amazing so
[24:07] each one of us tonight our existing
[24:10] while holding what are we holding that
[24:12] that that treasure in earthen vessels
[24:14] we're holding or holding him so we're
[24:17] beholding him looking in it but we're
[24:18] also existing while holding and that
[24:21] wonderful justice just to see that that
[24:23] the part of it and in beholding leads to
[24:27] becoming right just like the the the
[24:30] name of our text to know to seek to find
[24:33] in to know and to be because we don't
[24:36] want to just know we want to we want to
[24:38] become so that's so wonderful as again
[24:42] we're how we said that will hold I face
[24:44] unrighteousness ugly satisfied when
[24:46] I wake and their likeness becoming him
[24:49] and and so even the thing about was
[24:52] becoming its its exist coming it's so
[24:55] it's we're coming to him and he's coming
[24:57] to us and it's this wonderful wonderful
[24:59] interaction and this in the seeking to
[25:03] see to see to gaze to behold to look
[25:06] upon
[25:07] you become what you behold what does it
[25:10] mean to seek the Lord to read your Bible
[25:13] pray study how long do we study for how
[25:18] long we pray for how long do we how long
[25:21] what would it take Joel to really seek
[25:25] the Lord is there different ways to seek
[25:27] Him how do we find him if we are even
[25:31] asking the question it brings us to more
[25:36] into knowing to think that we're even
[25:37] asking that question and I remember
[25:42] there was a time in my life that the
[25:44] Lord she would just keep saying me
[25:46] Stephen seek me Wally maybe he found
[25:48] seeking me while I may be found seek me
[25:50] while I may be found seek me while I may
[25:52] be found and I would just hear it all
[25:54] the time I was like all praise God
[25:55] because that's his he's calling so that
[25:59] means that he can be found and that's
[26:02] that's a wonderful thing we're not we're
[26:03] not on a wild goose chase chase like in
[26:05] the supermarket at Costco we have what's
[26:08] called the treasure hunt and if you ever
[26:10] go to Costco which I'm guessing you
[26:12] probably do you guys have a Costco
[26:13] around here that they always move things
[26:15] around so then that way you look you buy
[26:17] other things while you're looking for
[26:19] that thing and and it's called the
[26:21] treasure hunt but sometimes it just
[26:22] turns into a wild goose chase
[26:23] but we know with the Lord it's something
[26:27] that we can find every time amen let's
[26:30] go to Psalms 119
[26:48] and let's just read a verse 2 blessed
[26:51] are they that keep his testimonies and
[26:54] that seek him with the whole heart so
[26:57] it's it's the ship she also says he know
[27:01] that scripture the
[27:03] Sikma shall find me when they seek for
[27:05] me with their whole heart so to me our
[27:09] heart is such an interesting place
[27:11] because you think about it it's the it's
[27:14] the betting round for for whatever it is
[27:18] that we're or positioning yourself and
[27:20] how can I say this simply did you know
[27:22] that you're the heart is the seat it's
[27:24] the chair of your craving so this was
[27:26] your heart that this is the place where
[27:31] where whatever you put in that you'll
[27:34] crave so if all of a sudden I put in if
[27:38] I put in in Apple products and I put it
[27:41] on on the seat of my heart what am I
[27:44] gonna crave boys and young lady Apple
[27:49] products a computer products technology
[27:51] all of said I'm gonna crave and I mean
[27:53] look for everything because I've and
[27:56] I've done it mechanically you can do
[27:58] that you can like I'm Stefano's and I
[28:01] can't remember who else in the scripture
[28:02] addicted themselves to the Word of God
[28:04] because in and they mechanically did
[28:06] that so if I decided to put something
[28:08] else I can't believe I'm not feedback
[28:11] and getting feedback they're close to
[28:12] the but if I put the Word of God now in
[28:15] my heart what am I gonna crave yeah
[28:19] that's right and his word right how can
[28:21] I do that though without craving
[28:23] something in the beginning if I just
[28:26] what if I just craved air because
[28:29] there's nothing in there but something
[28:31] will always want that spot and no that's
[28:33] a throne it's a and it's also what's in
[28:36] charge so if I'm craving if I'm craving
[28:39] computers and gizmos and whatnot now
[28:41] it's going to tell me to spend my money
[28:43] on this right so I've had this before
[28:46] where I've and I hope you can learn from
[28:49] my mistakes is that I've spent lots of
[28:51] money on things that I craved that I
[28:53] don't want anymore and I remember I had
[28:56] over 300 CDs
[28:58] of all this contemporary Christian music
[29:00] that I would never listen to anymore and
[29:02] I was probably at 15 bucks a CD so
[29:05] you're looking at over over $4,000 worth
[29:09] of stuff where I could have just had a
[29:11] really nice guitar or something or a
[29:13] piano instead or maybe bought Bibles for
[29:16] for missions or something but but we but
[29:20] that's what your heart is it's a seat
[29:21] and it's a place of it's a it's a seat
[29:24] it's a place where where it sits tears
[29:27] of the whole body and as well as the
[29:31] tongue but then but then whatever you
[29:33] crave is now is now is now what you're
[29:38] gonna find everywhere what's you're
[29:40] gonna see everywhere how many has ever
[29:42] gotten a new vehicle before if you
[29:46] notice that as soon as you bought that
[29:47] vehicle
[29:48] you saw it everywhere and you're like
[29:50] wow everybody's just as soon as I bought
[29:53] that car everybody else is buying that
[29:54] car and yet why because now you own it
[29:58] and it's this ownership that now you're
[30:01] in the seat of that vehicle and now you
[30:03] see it everywhere and so now you're not
[30:05] even seeking it and you're finding it
[30:07] because of the ownership you think about
[30:11] that how that when we have the word of
[30:12] God in our heart and we have we have it
[30:14] on the throne of our heart all of a
[30:15] sudden we start seeing it and everything
[30:17] we and it's just so wonderful because
[30:19] almost like oh that makes sense and that
[30:21] makes sense but what if no I decided to
[30:23] put I decide to put you know technology
[30:26] in there too and and then I decided to
[30:29] put you know something else in there and
[30:32] and movies and whatnot now now I'm not
[30:36] gonna be able to find whether it's God's
[30:39] word of the Bible or not because I'm
[30:41] gonna be like well is it and this is
[30:43] where you hear conversations where it
[30:45] gets confusing what well it's really not
[30:46] a Salvation issue movies you know and I
[30:48] have my Bible and I have my booot movies
[30:49] and I have all you know all these these
[30:52] technology and I've got you know my all
[30:54] this stuff and it's not really you know
[30:55] and you can see there's confusion why
[30:57] because they have more than one thing on
[30:59] the seat of their heart so they're
[31:00] craving everything at the same time and
[31:02] it's it's like well those people you see
[31:04] in the line that the place and they have
[31:06] way too many options they're never going
[31:08] to find what they're looking for because
[31:10] there's too many options
[31:12] so I hope that's a good example of the
[31:15] the heart and how that it's a seed of
[31:16] cravings and that we're that that's why
[31:21] we have to keep our heart with all
[31:22] diligence right you know cuz Satan's
[31:24] gonna leave a peck Oh what's this
[31:25] package on my on the seat of my heart
[31:27] and oh you know all of a sudden some
[31:30] video game or something at that you know
[31:32] I I had a big problem with eating games
[31:35] when I was growing up and it was it was
[31:37] stealing away my soul and I finally just
[31:39] wrote out in a letter to the Lord I
[31:43] would never own a video game system
[31:44] because I I would just play for hours
[31:48] and hours sometimes you know 9 hours a
[31:50] day and it was it was I had made it the
[31:53] seat of my cravings so just just to know
[31:58] that we have we have our whatever we put
[32:01] on our heart it's like putting it on our
[32:02] radar all of a sudden we we hone in on
[32:04] those things right and so to be careful
[32:08] what we put in there let's go to a good
[32:10] example of this in process of how that
[32:13] works the mechanics of putting something
[32:15] we could say that this is delight let's
[32:19] just say this you think the light is not
[32:21] this what this it looks like if I go
[32:23] like this and I set this down here does
[32:26] that look like delight you would think
[32:28] it wouldn't be but what it is is we'll
[32:32] see it in let's turn over to Isaiah 58
[32:39] because sometimes we don't feel
[32:43] especially when we're going through
[32:46] process of things we don't feel like
[32:49] seeking the Lord like we should perhaps
[32:51] sometimes I know that this was something
[32:55] that when the Lord was dealing with my
[32:56] heart where I was really coming into
[32:57] Christ this is something that really he
[33:00] just showed me and I thought oh my
[33:01] goodness so I was wondering like lord I
[33:03] want to seek you more but I don't feel
[33:05] like I have that want to to do it so
[33:07] there's something that you can do you
[33:09] can choose that will bring that that
[33:12] craving for it
[33:15] so if you look to that go down to the
[33:18] end down to verse 13 and this is this is
[33:22] wordy so we're kind of especially for
[33:25] the young people
[33:25] we'll just we'll just go through in
[33:28] simpler terms at the end but it says if
[33:30] they'll turn away thy foot from the
[33:31] Sabbath from doing that pleasure on my
[33:33] holy day and call the Sabbath to the
[33:35] delight the holy of the Lord honorable
[33:37] and shall honor him not doing thine own
[33:40] ways nor finding thine own pleasure nor
[33:43] speaking thine own words then thou shalt
[33:47] delight thyself from the Lord and I will
[33:48] cause thee to write upon the high places
[33:50] of the earth and feedly with the
[33:52] heritage of Jacob their father for the
[33:54] mouth of the Lord has spoken it so it's
[33:57] he even though you never hear the word
[33:58] seeking there you're you're hearing a
[34:01] dedication to greater to greater greater
[34:08] oneness and intimacy and a delight in
[34:10] the Lord and so if we look in verse just
[34:13] to break it down for the young people is
[34:15] it what what Isaiah the Lord is saying
[34:18] through Isaiah and there is he's saying
[34:20] if the if you turn away yourself from
[34:24] doing what you want to do and instead
[34:27] choose what God wants when shoot choose
[34:29] to put put what God wants before what
[34:33] you want then all of a sudden you'll
[34:35] want it and it'll be like a delight to
[34:38] you and you think really you can
[34:41] actually just choose and say Lord I just
[34:43] want your way but that's all that's all
[34:46] I want I don't I don't really love to do
[34:48] it yet but I do want your way and then
[34:51] all of a sudden then it says then then
[34:54] you shall delight yourself in the Lord
[34:56] oh wait it just said before if it says
[34:59] and call the Sabbath a delight like call
[35:02] church a delight
[35:03] call rest and him a delight and just
[35:06] start speaking it did you know you can
[35:08] make yourself like vegetables if you
[35:12] don't like vegetables you can make
[35:13] yourself like it so if you know grown
[35:17] people that I'll just say I've just
[35:18] never I just never liked vegetables and
[35:22] they still don't like vegetables because
[35:25] they keep telling themselves they never
[35:28] have liked vegetables and they keep
[35:29] selling themself they never liked
[35:31] vegetables but it's what they call it
[35:33] they're calling a delight or not delight
[35:35] and amazing so that's amazing how like
[35:38] there's some things that I know that
[35:39] lord
[35:39] telling us whether it's something that
[35:41] in our childhood like well I've always
[35:43] just done that because it's for my child
[35:44] and I don't want to give that up or oh I
[35:46] just you know I just had at our time a
[35:49] hard time you know getting into that
[35:51] thing in the Lord you know I just I'm
[35:52] really uncomfortable with that guess
[35:54] what
[35:54] 30 years later you're gonna hear over
[35:56] here that same person saying yeah I'm
[35:57] still really uncomfortable with that
[35:58] because they keep calling it what it is
[36:02] rather than what they want what they
[36:04] desire in their heart to be and so let's
[36:06] like that if we call it a delight I love
[36:10] going to church we're not being a
[36:11] hypocrite because we have a want to love
[36:13] going to church even if there's
[36:16] something that they're not saying yes
[36:17] let's go to church but it's amazing
[36:20] because did you know young people that
[36:22] even today my body said boy it sure
[36:25] would be nice to just take a nap in the
[36:27] pastor study and just maybe just call
[36:29] brother Troy and just say can we just
[36:31] have a church service at 5 o'clock or
[36:35] that lunch was something else but it
[36:37] sure just made me tired I think I'll
[36:39] just go to sleep you know I think I'd
[36:41] like to do that better
[36:42] but there's something on the inside of
[36:46] us that wants to call it call that no we
[36:49] don't we don't want to really want to do
[36:51] that we want to come to church and
[36:52] praise the Lord and hear more about him
[36:54] and we start calling that and we say I
[36:56] like doing that and one thing that I do
[36:59] actually for living I'm just on the side
[37:02] is I'm a tune pianos so but it's amazing
[37:06] how that Satan comes in and he does
[37:08] something is he takes anything that's
[37:11] that's righteous I'm sure for the try
[37:14] could she could speak better than me on
[37:16] this since he was it's been fresh in his
[37:17] heart but is that he tries to pervert it
[37:20] even by trying to call it over you I'll
[37:23] be on the way to a piano Ching I'm
[37:25] providing for my family I love doing
[37:26] this and I'll send out here you have to
[37:28] go to a piano tuning instead of being
[37:30] with your family you don't really like
[37:31] doing piano tuning to you I was like I
[37:34] know if I do wait what was that
[37:36] where'd that come from and I just had to
[37:39] say although that's an I love piano
[37:41] tuning what's wrong with me why am I
[37:43] even feeling this way is again he was
[37:45] trying to put that that dislike for
[37:47] piano tuning in my heart because he
[37:51] doesn't want me to be a provider for my
[37:52] family
[37:53] because he doesn't want me to be a
[37:54] testimony to go pray for somebody when I
[37:56] when I when I've got an opportunity to
[37:58] pray for someone who I'm tuning pianos
[38:00] is he's trying to he's trying to call
[38:02] things over us while we're all we're
[38:04] seeking the Lord and while we're doing
[38:05] the function that we're supposed to be
[38:07] doing not to get our topic but it's just
[38:09] that we have that that those things that
[38:12] are righteous to do in that seeking and
[38:15] that he's trying to bring us off-track
[38:16] amen
[38:17] and so for us to call it over our lives
[38:21] to say I love seeking Lord I'm preaching
[38:24] to me tonight Wow praise God
[38:26] is to say I loved spending time in
[38:28] prayer just to call it out call it out
[38:30] to to bring the mic to - it's that
[38:34] sacrifice of praise right it's a
[38:36] sacrifice um there's a there's a really
[38:39] good quote brother Brahma talks about he
[38:41] says we're kings and priests unto our
[38:43] God right and he says he says he says so
[38:48] we give our sacrifice of praise he says
[38:49] you say well I'm too tired he says do it
[38:52] anyhow he says the devil will tell you
[38:54] that until it takes you to hell so he'll
[38:57] steal tell you you're too tired to
[38:59] praise the Lord and he said he'll tell
[39:01] you that until it takes you to hell I
[39:03] thought wow - think that he's calling
[39:05] that over us as worth wanting to seek
[39:07] the Lord like all you're too tired he's
[39:09] trying to speak that over us when we're
[39:11] seeking Him for us to know that just
[39:15] that's just the devil let's turn over to
[39:19] Psalms 105
[39:32] we're seeking the Lord right now praise
[39:35] God
[39:46] o give thanks unto the lord call upon
[39:49] his name make known his deeds among the
[39:51] people sing unto him sing psalms unto
[39:54] him talky of his always wonderful what
[39:56] wondrous works they go for the rich
[39:59] glory ye and his holy name let the heart
[40:02] of them rejoice
[40:04] seek the Lord let the heart let don't
[40:08] prevent her forbid that heart from
[40:09] seeking from from from rejoicing and
[40:13] from seeking the Lord so seen as trying
[40:14] to prevent or interrupt us from seeking
[40:17] the Lord and from rejoicing the Lord
[40:20] we don't rejoice in modern culture at
[40:23] all we don't
[40:24] it's-it's to unpriced it fall it's too
[40:26] undignified we never you know unless
[40:28] we're at a football game or a basketball
[40:30] or some kind of sport or some kind of
[40:32] worldly where there's stars involved and
[40:36] it's amazing how it's like we don't you
[40:38] know the word the rejoice actually means
[40:40] to leap for joy to think that and you
[40:43] notice how if you ever just love for joy
[40:45] just to try it you would actually feel
[40:47] more joy and that there's something that
[40:50] comes with the mecanics bringing the
[40:52] dynamics there's you know that there
[40:55] even in the the occult they can do
[40:57] things physically to invoke spirits and
[41:00] we won't get into that but to think that
[41:02] we can do things physically to bring
[41:04] down the Lord didn't have its the praise
[41:06] of his people and we know that prayer
[41:08] changes things we know that that's when
[41:10] we seek the Lord like I said we when we
[41:12] seek him with a whole heart that that we
[41:15] will find him another thing that I that
[41:18] I really want to highlight is that what
[41:21] Satan has done try to do it for me it do
[41:24] not for me for him is that to try to
[41:27] make what isn't the wrong meaning behind
[41:30] seeking the Lord the whole heart it's
[41:33] like oh well Steven that's going to take
[41:34] years you know because you have two
[41:37] hundred ninety seven thousand chambers
[41:38] in your heart and you know it's gonna
[41:41] work on you for both 37 38 mm somewhere
[41:45] on there yours and then pretty soon
[41:46] you're gonna build a sequel or if your
[41:48] whole heart verses to say Lord here's my
[41:51] heart in an instant and say Lord I don't
[41:55] want anything but what you want for me I
[41:57] give you my whole heart now I'm seeking
[41:59] you with
[42:00] that's seeking the Lord of your heart
[42:02] how long did that take boys maybe five
[42:06] seconds yeah there you go three seconds
[42:08] it's as easy as surrendering yes all the
[42:11] way that's it that's why it says today's
[42:13] the day our salvation not to this this
[42:17] age this eon of time is the day is the
[42:20] time of your salvation it's because it
[42:23] can happen in a decision for now and
[42:26] that's why how brother Graham said that
[42:27] there's a spirit behind there's an evil
[42:29] spirit behind wait just keep waiting
[42:32] just you know one more day and so did
[42:35] something the trickery is oh I want to
[42:37] wait I want to seek the Lord oh the Lord
[42:39] it's gonna take me years for for me to
[42:41] find you because I have to see with you
[42:43] from with my whole heart and I know I'm
[42:45] not there I'm saying yes all the way but
[42:47] I know I'm not there and to get us
[42:49] misconstrued undermine to say but we can
[42:51] seek the Lord right now with our whole
[42:53] heart just by saying Lord whatever it is
[42:55] in a way just take it away I don't want
[42:57] it
[42:57] and sometimes he'll take us through
[42:59] their prophets of that process but in
[43:01] that process we will continue to find
[43:03] him I know and even in that scripture I
[43:07] Lord was just when I was first really
[43:10] starting over with the Lord and really
[43:13] understanding what it means to love the
[43:14] Lord when I was 23 years old and he
[43:16] challenged me what does it mean to love
[43:18] you Lord and I had no idea and I just
[43:21] said lord I wanna know you and I said I
[43:24] know you I know that I love you because
[43:26] I'm not going to hell but how do I know
[43:28] you - where I can love you like what you
[43:31] know like brother Brown says or someone
[43:33] says you know even if I went to hell I'd
[43:34] still love you guys I don't have love
[43:36] for you I said Lord how do I do that and
[43:38] I just I just heard read your Bible and
[43:40] pray first thing every day
[43:43] okay I'll do that and it was such a
[43:46] challenging question of the Lord put him
[43:48] in heart I was just his seeking me out
[43:50] and so and then every day I would get up
[43:53] and you know I read my Bible and pray
[43:56] and sometimes I would do it until 4:00
[43:57] o'clock and bro and the afternoon Excel
[44:00] put it off and I would be just miserable
[44:02] all day cuz I didn't get time with the
[44:04] Lord and it was he was starting to work
[44:06] in my heart just a little bit every day
[44:07] just at line upon line and and and but I
[44:12] still it was still blank words on a page
[44:14] Shh and I just want to say that
[44:16] especially for the youth but for all of
[44:17] us is that there's so many times where I
[44:19] would just read now just see how I got
[44:22] to start over okay again it's that
[44:24] seeking and then your brain just oh you
[44:27] know it's things to do I got a theater
[44:28] one on the way tomorrow and Oh what was
[44:30] that okay lord I got a CQ I got to know
[44:32] who you are so I can love you and and
[44:34] it's the seeking right and it's that
[44:37] we're it does that work but it's because
[44:39] it's it's something we put in our hearts
[44:41] right and so I remember I was living
[44:43] with a friend just this is all sneaky
[44:46] the devil is a friend of mine a brother
[44:49] in Christ his brother was an unbeliever
[44:52] he came to live with him he had brought
[44:54] in a TV in and when he left he left the
[44:57] TV so we had about three or four
[44:59] channels the news in a couple shows and
[45:01] we would just sit around and watch TV
[45:04] because I was already in there so why
[45:06] not just hit the power button and so I'm
[45:08] so I have TV and I have the Bible in my
[45:11] heart so I have these two things sitting
[45:13] in my heart right on the seat of my
[45:16] heart and I just was blank words on a
[45:18] page but then all of a sudden I me and
[45:21] Nate looked at each other we're that
[45:24] we're saying we're becoming TV junkie we
[45:29] know better than this so we just got rid
[45:31] of the TV and all of a sudden went from
[45:33] I can't hear his voice I can't read the
[45:36] word to all of a sudden I remember it
[45:37] the first thing I read were read where
[45:39] it was like reading it again for the
[45:41] first time and it was it was John
[45:43] chapter one and it was like it was like
[45:46] starting all over again and it was just
[45:48] reading in the beginning was the word I
[45:50] was thinking was the word and the Word
[45:58] was with God and the Word was God and I
[46:02] had that realization right there Saints
[46:04] I'm reading God what does that mean that
[46:08] means God's come becoming a part of me
[46:09] and it was you know 23 years old I've
[46:13] been the goody two-shoes at church and
[46:14] yet there was still iniquity in my heart
[46:15] there still I didn't have that love for
[46:18] the Lord to keep me and to have that
[46:19] delight in the Lord it was just all duty
[46:21] and the Word was God and it was I was
[46:27] just thinking
[46:27] I read a psalm 139 how great are the
[46:30] thoughts you think of us how great are
[46:31] the Sun some of them if I could number
[46:33] them there would be more than this and
[46:37] much of me a little old me that you
[46:41] would think of thoughts of me more than
[46:42] the sand I thought wow and you know my
[46:45] mind's imagining all the sand in the
[46:47] world thinking every one of those
[46:49] represents a thought they things towards
[46:51] us he was starting to knit my heart and
[46:54] love him and it was just those in that
[46:57] seeking it was just about a month and a
[47:00] half and all of a sudden just getting
[47:02] all all the other voices and the seeking
[47:05] began to happen and there's nothing no
[47:08] one can take that away from me amen
[47:13] Isaiah 55 verse 6 says seek the Lord
[47:16] while he may be found James chapter 4
[47:18] verse 8 he says let's just go there
[47:23] James chapter 4
[47:35] we're getting these nuggets word we're
[47:38] getting our miners hats on and we're
[47:40] getting our our excavation picks out and
[47:44] bingi in those nuggets I'm in verse 8
[47:48] draw nigh to God and He will draw nigh
[47:51] unto you cleanse your hands you sinners
[47:54] purify your hearts you double-minded be
[47:57] afflicted and mourn and weep
[47:59] let your laughter be turned to mourning
[48:00] and let your joy to heaviness humble
[48:04] yourselves in the sight of the Lord and
[48:06] he shall lift you up so you'd see that
[48:10] there's a there is a purging that comes
[48:12] with that that that's seeking because
[48:15] cleanse your hands you sinners it's just
[48:17] like when we go to the table to eat to
[48:20] feast at the table we cleanse our hands
[48:22] first because we don't want to go in
[48:24] there now
[48:25] being you know eating and now defiling
[48:29] ourselves while we're eating and so many
[48:31] people we know this in churches on these
[48:34] days they say you don't cleanse your
[48:35] hands you sinners you have to do
[48:37] anything you don't have to God wants you
[48:40] to be happy be happy rather than saying
[48:43] oh be afflicted and mourn and weep and
[48:46] let your laughter be turned to mourning
[48:48] and your joy to heaviness humble
[48:50] yourselves no it's it's it's let's have
[48:54] a rock concert and let's make you feel
[48:56] really good about yourself while we're
[48:58] talking about Jesus and it's there's no
[49:00] no wonder that they can't find the Lord
[49:02] because there's no they're not doing any
[49:04] of their prerequisites a God requires to
[49:06] seek the Lord they're saying you can
[49:08] have as many affections on the sit on
[49:09] the seat of the throne of your heart as
[49:12] much as you want and you'll still find
[49:14] the Lord because you said take you know
[49:16] what just say take me as I am Lord
[49:18] there's no there's no transformation
[49:21] it's it's some there's a Christian a
[49:24] contemporary rock Christian radio in her
[49:26] town and it's they they say you see you
[49:29] know encouraging music and it's safe for
[49:31] your kids to me when they've just even
[49:35] saying that on there I'm saying the
[49:37] world is wrong with this and rezzing
[49:39] they're right they're encouraging people
[49:41] but they're not transforming anyone it's
[49:44] just all encouragement it's all pound
[49:45] back it's it's it's giving a man a fish
[49:47] rather than teaching him
[49:49] to fish it's it's nothing that's
[49:51] sustainable it's you know and that's why
[49:53] I love what brother Paulo Fontaine says
[49:55] he says Christian or Christian
[49:58] contemporary music says Lord help me to
[50:00] get there help me to get there I'm not
[50:02] there help me to get there and Bride
[50:04] music says I'm already there so we see
[50:08] that we want to have that heart of it
[50:10] now that we've we've mourn and I've been
[50:11] afflicted and and in that seeking and
[50:14] humbling ourselves and he shall lift you
[50:16] up and Norma's notice the pre-law Saints
[50:19] have got it you see that is in verse 10
[50:21] he shall lift you up
[50:22] remember in Isaiah 58 or did it say
[50:25] there I will cause you to ride upon the
[50:28] high places of there for the mouth do
[50:31] you know the boys what that means and
[50:33] Lydia is that in in the land where
[50:37] Isaiah was from there was these leaves I
[50:41] can remember that if there is I've X or
[50:43] what but they would they were little
[50:44] antelope like creatures and they would
[50:47] they would live like up on the top of
[50:49] the mountains and God made their feet so
[50:52] special that they can they can their
[50:54] hubs are like rock-climber hubs and and
[50:57] they can they can just climb up the
[51:00] sides Mountain
[51:00] maybe you mom and dad can look it up but
[51:02] they can they can go from the the base
[51:04] where they actually have to come down to
[51:07] drink water and and to find grass to eat
[51:10] but then when they see when the enemy is
[51:13] coming and for them they just run up to
[51:16] the mountain and no animal can follow in
[51:18] there because it's just steep cliffs so
[51:20] they just actually go back and forth
[51:21] read read read read read read
[51:22] they go all the way up to the top of the
[51:24] mountain and they can just prance all
[51:26] the way up and just be and gonna be
[51:28] completely fine
[51:29] because they are equipped to be able to
[51:31] get up there and away from the enemy and
[51:33] now to be able to be right on the high
[51:36] places of the earth and it's something
[51:38] that God has equipped them with and how
[51:40] that when we have the right equipment
[51:42] that God gives us you can keep us away
[51:45] from the snare of the Fowler and it be
[51:46] kept from all that and our enemies and
[51:48] bring us up into a high safe place away
[51:51] from that and isn't amazing how the
[51:52] seeking the Lord actually has has a it's
[51:57] like a side effect of all of a sudden we
[52:00] get lost in him and all of a sudden now
[52:02] we don't
[52:03] we don't have all the even though there
[52:05] that enemy is following us pretty soon
[52:07] they can't find our address they can't
[52:09] get to us because we're so we're so
[52:12] buried in Christ that that just like you
[52:14] know program says you can't you can kick
[52:16] a dance get take a dead man all you want
[52:19] to but he's not gonna do anything
[52:20] because we're we're dead to this world
[52:23] and so that we're bury our life is hid
[52:25] with Christ in God and so that you know
[52:27] that that how many of those wolves could
[52:30] be snapping and snarling at the base
[52:31] that Mon and they're on top of the
[52:33] moment they can't even hear the wolf
[52:35] anymore
[52:35] because they're safe amen that he'll
[52:38] lift us up amen
[52:41] Psalms 27 one thing have I desired a
[52:44] Lord that will I seek after that I may
[52:48] do well in the house Lord all the days
[52:50] of my life - what again
[52:53] behold - seek to behold the beauty of
[52:57] the Lord and to enquire in his temple
[53:00] I'm just going to go through a few of
[53:03] these you know how to turn that if you
[53:05] don't want to uh second chronicles 7:14
[53:06] if my people which are called by my name
[53:09] shall humble themselves once again and
[53:12] and pray and seek my face and turn from
[53:16] their wicked ways then will I then will
[53:19] I hear from heaven and will forgive
[53:21] their sin and will heal their land
[53:24] hear from heaven forgive their sin and
[53:26] heal their land
[53:27] I think it's interesting that we have
[53:29] Facebook these days because the Lord
[53:32] said seek my face and the world is
[53:38] setting up you can see everyone else's
[53:40] face will give you me will even call it
[53:43] Facebook rather than rather than seeking
[53:47] his face book amen it's it's it's
[53:51] amazing Hall sometimes it becomes so
[53:53] obvious when it's just this it's this
[53:56] this time and it's amazing it's a trap
[53:58] it's such a trap and you yet you notice
[54:05] how it swims right
[54:06] there's evil who else is seeking first
[54:11] Peter 5:8 be sober be vigilant because
[54:13] your adversary the devil as a roaring
[54:15] lion walketh above
[54:17] seeking whom he may devour so he's also
[54:21] seeking to so as amazing gods in seeking
[54:24] again like that for that seat of craving
[54:26] a seat of affections is that in then
[54:29] Satan seeking who one is the one is to
[54:32] lift us up and one is to devour us just
[54:35] like those wolves at the bottom of the
[54:36] mountain so that's why we have to be veg
[54:39] so vigilant Psalms chapter 10 verse for
[54:42] the wicked through the pride of his
[54:43] countenance will not seek after God God
[54:48] is not in all his thoughts wow that just
[54:53] it struck me I never read that before
[54:55] really I never really read it to think
[54:58] that you and you have the righteous and
[55:00] you have the wicked right and the wicked
[55:01] will through the pride of his
[55:03] countenance will not seek after God I
[55:05] will say pride is God repellant because
[55:10] he OCE you see what does it say Oh
[55:12] God resisteth the proud but giveth grace
[55:16] to the humble
[55:16] and then it's that pride is God
[55:19] resistant Psalms 40 verse 14 let them be
[55:26] ashamed and confounded together that
[55:29] seek after my soul to destroy it let
[55:32] them be driven backward and be put to
[55:33] shame that wish me evil was John chapter
[55:37] 10 so I wanted to-- to write over that
[55:44] last one is you see again that david is
[55:48] acknowledging those that are seeking
[55:50] seeking after his soul to do what to
[55:52] destroy it so let's imagine that one you
[55:58] put you put this you put the lord and
[56:00] the word on on your heart and it comes
[56:04] as beautiful birth of becoming and and
[56:07] this beautiful beholding the beauty of
[56:09] the lord and and and awaking in his
[56:12] likeness versus this destroyer when he
[56:17] seeks after us that it just it's just to
[56:21] make us completely utterly in chains and
[56:23] to end thereof is completely destroyed
[56:26] utterly
[56:28] for us to be so vigilant that we that he
[56:31] doesn't come in to destroy us John
[56:36] chapter 10 the thief cometh not but for
[56:40] to steal and to kill and to destroy I am
[56:43] come that they might have life and that
[56:45] they might have it more abundantly
[56:48] why did God want to be sought after why
[56:52] did God make it a seeking thing what if
[56:54] he just said this everything who I am
[56:57] and he crossed the sky instead of clouds
[56:59] was everything who God is and you could
[57:01] just look and you could just point and
[57:03] then be like magnifying and then and
[57:06] everything of God was there all his
[57:08] attributes you could see in 3d you see
[57:10] everything and just perfectly just like
[57:12] golden nuggets and jewels and and just
[57:14] beautiful everything it was right there
[57:16] all the time every day and the reason
[57:19] why is that when there's no seeking
[57:23] there's no perceived value and he knew
[57:26] that we really like that there's no
[57:28] craving to know there's that when a
[57:32] thing is sought after it becomes a
[57:34] higher value to us it's where Steve yet
[57:37] we value it so much higher when it's
[57:40] harder to find there's more value when
[57:43] it's more rare it's more value so you
[57:45] think about the times up sometimes it's
[57:47] rare in our lives where we see we have
[57:49] that was just wonderful nuggets all of a
[57:51] sudden you know like we're just trying
[57:52] to understand something and then all of
[57:54] a sudden oh there it is and go oh I
[57:56] struck a nugget
[57:57] I was hitting earth which you know the
[58:00] world the world the world I'm just
[58:01] trying to get everything out of the way
[58:02] and everything just get all the the
[58:04] worldly dirt out of the way and all of a
[58:06] sudden we find that one nugget and we
[58:07] just say oh there's that gold not have
[58:09] struck gold where as if it was all gold
[58:12] we just be like well where's the other
[58:14] stuff yeah it will just be all just just
[58:17] excavation product wouldn't be anything
[58:21] to us but because it's hard to find then
[58:24] it's a more value and and when we have
[58:26] to give up everything you heard about
[58:28] people who have the gold rush of 18-49
[58:30] and people would move all the way across
[58:33] the country you know on on a mule or on
[58:36] a horse and they'd be right all the way
[58:39] and so many people didn't even make it
[58:41] and they get there and they don't find
[58:43] anything and they were the reason why
[58:45] California became so big and so huge as
[58:48] you read history is because of all the
[58:50] the history of people looking for that
[58:53] goal to strike it big but to think that
[58:56] because it it was hard to find it became
[59:00] so much more valuable we look in the
[59:04] examples in scripture the Wiseman sought
[59:08] for Jesus was it wasn't it about three
[59:10] years three and a half years that they
[59:13] sought they saw the star in the east and
[59:14] they they travel and he traveled and
[59:16] then and they they finally got to him
[59:19] but they haven't been to ask around and
[59:20] then look it wasn't just that you know
[59:23] they were looking at the star and all
[59:24] something here baby crying and all of a
[59:27] sudden oh well it was on our own
[59:29] backyard well let's you know let's have
[59:32] a barbecue no it was something that they
[59:33] were looking for and seeking it was a
[59:36] high value to them what about people in
[59:44] the Bible that partially seek God do you
[59:46] remember anybody in the Bible young
[59:48] people that that partially sought God
[59:50] but didn't really seek him with her
[59:52] whole heart what about the what about
[59:55] the rich young ruler remember he went to
[59:57] see Jesus and he saw Jesus and he said
[1:00:00] good teacher what must I do to be saved
[1:00:03] because he wanted to be saved and he
[1:00:05] said go so all you have and give it to
[1:00:08] the poor and your shell of riches in
[1:00:11] heaven and he wouldn't he wouldn't seek
[1:00:15] any farther he stopped right there why
[1:00:18] remember this the chair he had treasures
[1:00:22] in his heart and and maybe he had the
[1:00:25] the commands because he says I made all
[1:00:27] the command and so he had the
[1:00:28] commandments and his treasure and said
[1:00:30] he'd give up your treasure and you can
[1:00:32] have everything it was that was the one
[1:00:34] thing in his heart that he had to give
[1:00:36] up and he says and what does the
[1:00:39] scripture say it sat on him because he
[1:00:40] had much much wealth and so he stopped
[1:00:44] his seeking right there it's whenever
[1:00:46] God pulls on your heart and you're just
[1:00:49] oh but
[1:00:51] ooh such and such as coming under burro
[1:00:53] I was I went to camp one year and it was
[1:00:55] you know there singing I surrender all
[1:00:58] and I'm standing there I'm like but that
[1:01:01] movie is coming out in two weeks that I
[1:01:04] really want to see eyes I can't
[1:01:07] surrender and it was I almost stopped
[1:01:09] and I said god I don't want and seaton
[1:01:13] would come along and say well what are
[1:01:14] you gonna do tomorrow when you know
[1:01:17] you're not gonna feel like serving God
[1:01:18] and I wanted God so bad but I said you
[1:01:21] know the Lord just show me Steven don't
[1:01:24] worry about tomorrow sufficient of the
[1:01:27] day is the evil thereof say yes today
[1:01:29] and I'll take care of you tomorrow
[1:01:31] so now that so so we don't see him with
[1:01:35] that partial heart amen what time to be
[1:01:39] surprised start at 3:00 how am i doing
[1:01:41] on time am i right okay
[1:01:44] praise God Jeremiah 29:13
[1:01:48] and ye shall seek me and find me when
[1:01:50] you show search for me with your heart
[1:01:53] aim in you ever notice the the the
[1:02:00] epiphany or the the para mountainous of
[1:02:03] a prospector for the gym you see you'd
[1:02:07] like that they almost
[1:02:09] Pitta mies is this crazy old prospector
[1:02:12] and I want you to see the type as you
[1:02:15] see this create he's he's digging for
[1:02:17] gold and he finds nothing for 20 years
[1:02:18] and he says he comes back into town for
[1:02:21] what more supplies and easily he's he's
[1:02:25] covered in dirt what is he covered in
[1:02:27] the signs of seeking and you look at him
[1:02:31] and and he's he's got he's got old
[1:02:34] glasses because he wants to make sure
[1:02:35] you could see and he's been looking
[1:02:37] encouraging for to try to find the gold
[1:02:39] down there he's probably got so much
[1:02:40] sand in his eyes he had to wear glasses
[1:02:42] and now his kids and glasses are covered
[1:02:44] in dirt and he's he's got dirt in his
[1:02:46] beard he got dirt everywhere and he's
[1:02:48] coming back into town and everybody
[1:02:49] laughs at him and he's but yet he's
[1:02:51] coming into town to to just do one thing
[1:02:54] to get more prospecting materials and
[1:02:56] more blasting dynamite and so he can get
[1:02:59] back out to his dig because he's digging
[1:03:01] for gold and he just
[1:03:02] he just has something deep calling into
[1:03:04] the deep on the inside to find that gold
[1:03:06] and his you'll find that his life is
[1:03:08] wrapped up in his treasure and he he
[1:03:13] smells like seeking he's sweat and dirt
[1:03:17] and maybe a little gold dust on his
[1:03:19] clothes and you look at that and I say
[1:03:23] lord I pray that people would see in me
[1:03:25] the viable prospector a Jesus prospector
[1:03:29] they'd say Oh what in the world is he
[1:03:32] doing in there he what is he doing and
[1:03:34] oh I'm reading my Bible I'm enjoying the
[1:03:38] Word of God you want to sit down with me
[1:03:40] you know but for different than a
[1:03:42] prospector that we're finding gold every
[1:03:45] day but we're seeking Him and we're
[1:03:47] seeking him or finding him and our life
[1:03:49] has wrapped around that seeking seeking
[1:03:51] to know him and seeking to be known of
[1:03:54] him well what is a prospect you know
[1:03:58] people what is a prospector where on his
[1:03:59] head a helmet and then what's on the
[1:04:05] front of his helmet usually a light bulb
[1:04:07] and remember that thy word is a lamp
[1:04:09] unto my feet a light unto my path and so
[1:04:12] we have their word we're seeking him and
[1:04:15] so when I always I was and I heard this
[1:04:17] from Dwight annuity he says when you go
[1:04:19] up he says when I get on my knees he
[1:04:21] says I grabbed my Bible and he says and
[1:04:23] I get on my knees with my Bible and I
[1:04:26] get a notebook and I find the will of
[1:04:28] the Lord and so that in that seeking it
[1:04:32] wasn't just this picture of of just
[1:04:34] someone alone just like this yes it's
[1:04:41] not just what the pictures say is that
[1:04:44] that word is a lamp unto my feet and a
[1:04:46] light unto my path so in that seeking
[1:04:48] this is our prospecting light and that
[1:04:52] we're it's it's as our we walk forward
[1:04:55] in this life and our decisions and we're
[1:04:57] seeking him saying lord I want to know
[1:04:59] where you want me to go well right there
[1:05:02] I remember had a lady but working and
[1:05:03] she was just not doing good things at
[1:05:05] work and I thought man I should probably
[1:05:06] tell someone tell my boss about her you
[1:05:10] know I just went to proverbs and it says
[1:05:11] discover not a servant to their master
[1:05:15] I said okay Lord but it was light unto
[1:05:17] my path because I was wondering should I
[1:05:19] take this path to tell to tell uh my my
[1:05:22] coworker and also my turn to don't tell
[1:05:25] on her and she ended up getting leave
[1:05:29] they let go or she she let herself go
[1:05:32] so it just the Lord just gave me wisdom
[1:05:35] so again a light on her path for our
[1:05:39] path amen praise God
[1:05:50] and yep we can't we can't talk about
[1:05:53] seeking until we talk about faith
[1:05:55] because we're seeing into the unseen
[1:05:57] right if we you notice how some people
[1:06:00] seek the Lord only in the scene and then
[1:06:03] as soon as the their first trial and the
[1:06:05] Lord pulls back from their life Lord
[1:06:07] where are you I can't see you anywhere
[1:06:11] my life forget it I give up I can't seek
[1:06:13] you I can't even find you I had a friend
[1:06:16] that I worked with and that's coming to
[1:06:18] find out that's why he left Christianity
[1:06:22] because he kind of got on the world a
[1:06:24] little bit and kind of went back to
[1:06:27] trying to seek the Lord uh he says I
[1:06:29] didn't really hurt anything I didn't see
[1:06:31] anything and that's when I started to
[1:06:33] look into evolution and I thought I was
[1:06:35] okay and I was able to witness to him
[1:06:39] and give him a Bible and but it was
[1:06:41] interesting as he was looking for a
[1:06:42] tangible God in that moment and he
[1:06:44] didn't find him so then he didn't seek
[1:06:48] him anymore
[1:06:49] and so for us to realize that we have to
[1:06:52] look through the eyes of faith when we
[1:06:54] seek Him it's that it's it's in faith
[1:06:56] that we seek Him and that it that
[1:07:00] because with all of faith it's
[1:07:01] impossible to please him for he that
[1:07:02] cometh to God must believe that he is
[1:07:05] how can we seek Him if we don't know
[1:07:07] that he is and that he is a rewarder of
[1:07:09] them that diligently seek him hey man I
[1:07:14] just want to read that one more time
[1:07:15] Hebrews 11:6 but with all faith it's
[1:07:16] impossible to please him we always hear
[1:07:18] that part but for him that cometh to God
[1:07:21] again that becoming must believe that he
[1:07:26] is not was there will be only but that
[1:07:30] he is right now showing himself to us
[1:07:34] and that he is a rewarder of them that
[1:07:36] diligently seek Him amen
[1:07:38] you know the tool of diligence in
[1:07:45] delighting to do something it's amazing
[1:07:47] how that do you think about diligence I
[1:07:49] love all the word delight at diligence
[1:07:52] because what what is it about if you if
[1:07:54] you look D and light D actually means
[1:07:58] another word for D actually means pull
[1:08:00] from draw from
[1:08:03] and then light so we're actually pulling
[1:08:06] from light when we when we when we when
[1:08:10] we delight ourselves on the Lord we're
[1:08:11] pulling light from the Lord and that
[1:08:15] wonderful we're pulling on him and that
[1:08:17] it's as I think that's so wonderful
[1:08:18] we're diligence we always thought of
[1:08:21] diligence which is hard-working man and
[1:08:23] just he used to you know brunch it and
[1:08:25] he worked and he rented and they came
[1:08:27] home but it's it actually has a
[1:08:29] connotation of loving work
[1:08:31] loving to do something diligent to clean
[1:08:34] the bathroom could be just enjoying
[1:08:37] enjoying hard work to clean the bathroom
[1:08:39] rather than just in the end for us to
[1:08:43] keep our heart with all diligence
[1:08:44] it doesn't mean oh I got to do this
[1:08:46] because God wants me to do this I got to
[1:08:48] keep no nothing else on my heart no it
[1:08:50] means I really love keeping this heart
[1:08:52] clean and ready for the Lord and to keep
[1:08:54] that board in there I just love this and
[1:08:56] for us to come into church and delight
[1:08:58] and being in church we're saying I just
[1:08:59] love this it's something that whit's is
[1:09:01] treasure to us part of me I hope this is
[1:09:12] all right saints of God because I was
[1:09:15] talking for the blot saying he was
[1:09:15] saying you know we should enjoy
[1:09:17] ourselves in church you know this is a
[1:09:20] time of just of and just enjoyment to be
[1:09:23] able to enjoy our time in church and
[1:09:25] lastly in closing Christ our example
[1:09:29] again you saw us first
[1:09:31] why just show us it's not us and our
[1:09:34] works in that sorry excuse me to show us
[1:09:37] it's not us and that our works that
[1:09:39] brings us into salvation but His mercy
[1:09:42] and grace and all his credit all the
[1:09:44] credit belongs to him it also gives us
[1:09:47] the love crave to reciprocate the
[1:09:49] seeking because why don't we sing the
[1:09:53] song we so we it's his love and makes us
[1:10:04] love him back and it delighted him as we
[1:10:10] see in the Psalms 139 again you look at
[1:10:12] that seeking chapter it's all about
[1:10:14] Christ
[1:10:16] his thoughts of us and his seeking after
[1:10:18] us no matter where we go he found us
[1:10:23] amen amen praise God Amen well I hope
[1:10:30] that's a blessing to you tonight i I
[1:10:33] just love this because you know when we
[1:10:35] seek for something and I love it that
[1:10:37] when God has an answer right away
[1:10:39] and we're not when I'm in that moment
[1:10:41] sometimes it's not all of it I'm sure
[1:10:43] each one of you could say that like the
[1:10:45] Lord why why is this happening and yet
[1:10:48] when we can wait when you have that
[1:10:50] moment of waiting and have that season
[1:10:52] of waiting and then he gives us the
[1:10:54] answer it's just oh that's wonderful
[1:10:56] and now that I'm a parent I completely
[1:10:59] understand if I give everything to leave
[1:11:01] iron Hosanna right away they just ask
[1:11:04] for something else right away and then
[1:11:05] would be always and why can't we end
[1:11:07] them complaining and they were just be
[1:11:08] constant complaining and why can't have
[1:11:10] everything all the time every every time
[1:11:12] you I asked for it immediately within a
[1:11:14] second and that and and then it comes
[1:11:17] this entitlement to like why doesn't God
[1:11:19] give me something in 2 seconds and and
[1:11:21] verses just say dad knows I'm Way and
[1:11:25] dad knows I asked I don't know do it and
[1:11:27] then I want to do it more for him right
[1:11:29] there so for us to be able to come to
[1:11:31] the Lord and say Lord I've asked you I
[1:11:33] know you'll do it I'm resting in that
[1:11:35] and there's that's that's the wonderful
[1:11:38] part because you can see that some of
[1:11:39] the delights in the Lord that's faith
[1:11:40] that he is and that he heat that we
[1:11:43] trust him
[1:11:44] amen amen praise God why don't we sing a
[1:11:48] song do you guys know that song some
[1:11:51] trust in chariots we trust in the name
[1:11:53] of the Lord our God
[1:11:53] oh this is such a good song for the rich
[1:11:57] you're gonna help me I'm not sure if
[1:12:04] y'all know this but we'll give it a try
[1:12:13] it goes some trust in chariots we trust
[1:12:18] in the name of the Lord our God oh dear
[1:12:21] now I don't know the verse I'm a piano
[1:12:22] player and not a song leader and
[1:12:24] sometimes but the course goes we trust
[1:12:27] in the name of the Lord our God again
[1:12:31] what should we trust we trust in the
[1:12:34] name of the Lord our God his love never
[1:12:38] fails his love never fails his ways

[1:13:53] the rich but Shing but wasn't for the
