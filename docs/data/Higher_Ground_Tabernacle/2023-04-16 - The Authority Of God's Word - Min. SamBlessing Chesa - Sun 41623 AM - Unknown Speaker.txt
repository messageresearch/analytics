Eternal grace and mercy God thank you we approach Eternal Grace [Music] knowing that in this place oh God that's where your presence is you'll provide a place of worship knowing that your God who never misses an appointment but look at each and every one of your children and they're coming out to reach out to you Monday because they know you're the only one who can supply the universe your disciples ask who else could we turn to but you alone you're the one who saved our souls [Music] and we owe you our everything your word is everything you see men shall not live by bread alone but by each and every word that proceedeth foreign [Music] let us open our Bible to the Book of Genesis in chapter one uh Genesis chapter 1 and verse one Genesis in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth and the Earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep is the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters it is and there was life amen you can take the comfort of your seeds you can sit down it's me and the translator will remain standing amen [Music] you can open our Bibles to the Book of John chapter 1 and verse 1. [Music] the Bible says in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God [Music] we're just trying to fix this amen amen Satan was trying to fight us but we are modern conquerors anyway in the Book of John chapter 1 verse one delivered the Bible says in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God did you the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made for a short time this morning I want to speak on the authority of God's word hallelujah hallelujah when we read in Genesis chapter one it says the world was empty there was nothing in it but that's when God spoke about it and he said let there be lie what created that life it's the word of God the spoken word what created the Earth it was the spoken word the mountains we see the mountains the beautiful Grand Canyon Grand Canyon to the Montana and all the mountain ranges we see they were created by the word spoken word now we realize that a word when it is spoken it carries the same Authority as the person who has spoken that word in John the Bible tells us that don't they live for the genre in the beginning was the word and that word was with God and that word was God amen amen so when God said let there be it's okay those words carry the same Authority as God himself because it's God who had spoken those words someone comes and tells you would be a command very good the first thing you're going to ask is who say that however where you're gonna act on that word depends on the person who has spoken if your co-worker comes to uh if your co-worker who's at the same level with you comes and tell you to do something you say okay I'll do it when I'm when I when I have available time but when your boss comes to tell you to do something you should do the exact same thing you make it a priority because although it might be the same words that's spoken you attach the authority of that word to the person who has spoken foreign when the president speaks currently president Paul that word has Authority the whole law enforcement the police the police have to enforce the police say to say they do have unforces all the law enforcement has to enforce it uh the police result because the law that's been passed out carries authorities authority of the Judiciary whoever passed it but we know we have a greater Authority than all of them remember our almighty God who spoke the word he was the word and that word was him in Isaiah foreign amen that word has made the Layman to walk said by all Africa that same word has made the blind eyes to see said that same word has caused cancers to disappeared that same word has caused tuberculosis to clear out said dead people have raised the more songs why is because God has spoken that same word has saved you and me said it does not matter what you were doing it does not matter what sin was binding you but when you heard that word of God it had enough power enough authority to set you free yeah it does not matter what chains were binding why because that word has the same Authority as God himself hallelujah hallelujah so all you have to do is take God and His words do not worry to say I don't know how this is that's not your problem just take him at his words he is responsible for making it come to pass regarding they were told that they were going to have a baby Baron for 25 years they did not worry how that was going to happen they just believe the word of God in that word he said parole was responsible to transform them was responsible for quickening Sarah's dead woman you see a promise of God because it's not your problem you don't have to worry about the technicalities God is responsible for his own responsibility all you have to do is realize she was not responsible for that happening all she just had to do was believe the words me if we are just like Mary this one it wasn't one some called married to my town and say Lord whatever you say about me get unto me according to them Gary I don't know how it's going to happen you might not know that medical knowledge themselves I have no idea uh [Music] thank you they are waiting for you to claim them all you just have to do is believe it hallelujah hallelujah so you say you look around whenever whatever promise you need open your Bible be read it stand on the head um God we serve a god of reputation he has never failed he is jealous of his reputation so if you take him at his words why is he gonna start failing on you he has a reputation ever since the Earth was created God will do it for you because there is nowhere that God speaks you ever go back to him hey man amen it has to come to pass this there's a scriptures that say the angels of the Lord in capital round those that fear Him yeah that's a promise if you believe it it happens to you how many accidents have you survived accident how many things could have happened to you but did not happen to you do you think that is that's God's word protecting you have Angels surrounding you yeah because you believe the word because you fear God um there is one sister out there in Africa she used to go to church on Wednesday evening and uh it was dangerous the area where she was walking and that place was well known to be they had the robbers and the murderers they said people never crossed or walked around that area at night but this sister was faithful message she never missed a single service it pays to be faithful to God God sees you each and every of your effort and this happened for so many years she used to walk by past and people knew that that's what she was doing it and they wondered why why she wasn't being attacked then one day a certain gentleman approached her yeah why is who is the man who is walking with you at night when you're coming from she says I go by myself person so these robots these murderers every time she used to pass by this bridge they will see the sister if why I said sir walking with a giant and they could not attack her because she was walking with it and they thought maybe it was someone she was walking baby she had no clue what was going on and she says I'm by myself but no she was not by herself that was God's angels protection [Music] [Music] do you remember the story of jobs Satan when God was having a conversation with Satan Satan say to God you have a hedge around job I cannot attack you because you have a hedge around him this was not God saying that this was Satan so you tell me how did Satan know that there was a head he did more come on because he once tried to go and he could not touch him because God was protecting him and this hedge is nothing else but God himself he is just believe his word and on the Promises of God the moment you realize that that word the same as God himself that's what the Bible tells foreign dwelling bodily in Jesus Christ so he was Authority walking on two feet if we read out if we open our Bible to the Book of Luke Luke Chapter 5 and verse we see a sin when Jesus was walking not yet his disciples operate he said unto Simon uh sorry yeah go ahead now when he had left speaking he said unto Simon launch into the deep uh and let down your nets for a draw a uh verse five verses sank and Simon answering said unto him we have toiled all night and have taken nothing nevertheless at that word I would let down the net you see why they did not know this man in the Konichi Pakistan but they had seen his track record Open the Eyes of the blind heal the sick when Simon Peter heard what Jesus said Jesus told him throw your nets into the water for you to catch fish I believe Peter could have risen I've been fishing all night and they came and they filled Bots these ships began to sink this was a miracle why because Peter Pierre recognized the authority accepted it and he believed it and a miracle happened to him these nets were breaking which means they had never broken before First Catch of their lives so you see the word of God caters for each and every need you have in your life not just to save you but it's for Providence this was their job if they couldn't catch fish they were not going to feed their families we see the word of God was giving them privacy it was giving them their livelihood so if you believe the word of God did you even in your work remember I can Elevate you God can give you a promotion that you have never seen promotions [Music] that word has authorities to bring you up hallelujah hallelujah in other word the prophet of God well the Apostle says God this is Lord we have feast all night we are fishermen we know our business and there is just simply no fish out here I would imagine he said in his heart this is Peter now we fish through these Waters there is but Jesus but if Jesus said let them down because Jesus is the same yet today yesterday and forever he can do it for you if you stand on his words he can make his promises come to pass him he prefer promise uh he just stand on his words give you results in your life amen amen the prophet God says now maybe you went to every doctor in the season is on the we don't know what's wrong with you or maybe they've even found what's wrong with you and they'll tell you that there is no medical Realms to cure you if this is nothing in the world that can do for you it is but like what we say the other times you have to refuse that report and say I don't care what your reports I respect you respect you've gone to school for ten years but the word of God says hallelujah hallelujah and his experience yeah his certain experience because back throughout all eternity if you have two options to have a doctor who has two years experience dockyard experience to do so to do a heart surgery on you uh uh in operation the curl a doctor who has 45 years experience to perform the same surgery if you had an option to choose it was here whom are you going to pick two years doesn't experience the experience of 45 years experience I don't even have to ask for someone who has more experience someone who has a track record of never failing but why is it when a doctor tells you something prefer to believe who has never ever failed and he has an experience that stretches all the way back to Eternity [Applause] but just like Peter but this [Music] [Music] anxiety is [Music] he can take you out of it amen amen the Bible says many other afflictions of the righteousness but it does not end right there is a bad God delivers them out of them they delivered characters that's a promise that's in the Bible so I come through to an Affliction Lord this is all where are you I'm waiting for my salvation I'm waiting for my freedom I'm waiting for my [Music] his word has Authority he has never failed we serve a god of reputation reputation he is jealous of his reputation he will never let his people to be different Universe no matter what that is in Matthew chapter 8 and verse 5. this is when Jesus was walking into Captain he was approached by a centurions we all know this scripture verse 5 says and when Jesus was entered into kapinal verses they came unto him a centurion beseeching him and saying Lord my servant lied at home sick of the palace tormented and Jesus said unto him I will come and heal him the Centurion answered and said Lord I am not worthy thou should have come under my roof but speak the word only and my seven shall be here the word was not opened yet to the Gentiles at this time Jesus was only giving the word to the Jews of an outside Faith Message he had heard of Jesus and he had seen Jesus Healing The Sick casting out demons and he realized that this man has authorities there was something different about this and he acknowledged The Authority that Jesus the word of God will never have effect in your life if you do not acknowledge it is the promises of God will never work for you unless you accept them and you acknowledge them for your life it does not matter how good it looks like that person you have to be willing to step into that promise remember the last time we talked about the 10 spies and Joshua and Kayla the promise was laying there go take the land but if they were not going to go fight they were not going to get that promise promise but Joshua and Caleb they accepted it he's not accepted he say this is our promise foreign I used I never caught it in the first uh in verse 9. until I read it another time he did not say for I am a man of authorities when I these people listen to me because I'm a man of authority he says for I'm a man under a man this is why when I tell my servants to do this they will do it myself so he was not speaking of his own authority he was speaking of the Roman government authorities he says from I'm a man under the Roman government authorities I speak to my servant because they listen to me could so he recognized that Jesus was on another different level he was under Authority the authority of the father daughter such that when he will speak take a seat belt and cast out demons they would recognize that authorities Miracles would happen because he was under authorities so if you and me so see we are under the authority of Jesus Christ [Applause] it is not your Authority but it's Christ's Authority that's working so that's why when you speak When you pray situations have to change the situation demons have to flee the demand you are free because you are foreign well the sons of skeva wanted to chase away demons and they said in the name of Jesus that Paul preaches he says the sons of didn't know this Jesus that Paul was speaking about it this demon said Paul we know Paul Jesus we know but who are you or how much audacity you have oh communities who create you might be shouting the name of Jesus as loud as you want yellow knowledge but if you are not under the authority those demons are gonna fold their hands and ask you if the Monday Jesus we know but who are you amen amen so we have to know they work on it and have to make sure that we submit ourselves under the authority of Jesus Christ amen amen and we will be able to operate under that rotation in verse 13. Jesus said unto the Centurion and as thou has believed and his servant was healed self same hour yeah why his servant was healed because he recognized the authority of Jesus Christ amen amen in the Queen of Sheba the prophet of God he said I'm a man and Authority it is which means that he had a hand men under him he said I'm a man under Authority and I say to this man go and he goes this man come and he comes to say those people are under my authorities and I didn't even thought myself worthy to come to you none of my nation [Music] husband or wife is sufficient if there is none of them there a senior person just raise up your hands he is sufficient always just wherever you are believe it it is a finished work hallelujah hallelujah if you believe him at his words that's a finished work it is that word has Authority just the same as he has that's why the disciples were on that boat set back and Jesus had told them I will catch up with you later when they saw him walking on the water we don't view uh marches you know they couldn't believe it they thought it was a ghost but Peter real when they realized that it was Jesus said Lord if it is he didn't say if it is notion me to come uh he was going to defy the law of buoyancy he was not going to sink uh [Music] say that if you you cannot walk on water if you get on water you will see people lose but Paul Peter said Lord say bid me to come a priorities in your face Jesus said come he confidently got out of that boat affected confidence he knew that he was going to walk why because Jesus amen amen so you just say Lord you don't need much I just need your words because your words can make me the five laws that that exists that say cancer cannot be healed concerned defying the laws of buoyancy but then he started looking at the weights that's the first mistake he did that fit he should have kept on looking at the words because Jesus was the world who said the spoken word so he should have kept his eyes on the world he made that mistake and he started it's like no way I could be walking yeah but he did the right thing Lord please save me the Bible did not tell us how far he was away from Jesus but the Bible tells that instantly he held his hand and he saved him it does not matter where you are cry to the [Music] and if we amen right amen amen that was Mary in the New Testament she was carrying the word you and me in this last day we have to become the world hallelujah hallelujah brother sister just believe that right Lazarus he was dead for four days he was having a good old time in heaven already they say if someone goes to heaven they never want to come back on Earth was a rich man he had stuff to enjoy here anyway he was already in heaven but he heard a voicemail he had to stop the fellowship he was having he was probably talking to Father Abraham he says hold on your situation what a situation your dad situation hopeless situations if you take him at his words why can't he do it for you God do the same thing for you Brothers amen amen because he's the same yesterday that word made sure Jesus could not stay in the grave I figured as you couldn't preparations that word my Holy One shall not see corruption had enough power to raise Jesus from the dead they sealed him in a tomb Allah but that word had enough power and resurrect him the same word give the same spirit that was in Jesus if that same Spirit dwells in you see the memories sufficient powers to bring you from death to life it doesn't matter where you are buried hallelujah hallelujah it doesn't matter how dead your spirit is that word except for all that made Jesus come back to life he affect the revenue Not the Same Spirit said mummies right get down nothing can hold you back no spirit that can hold you yeah by the speaking perfectly No Grave can hold you back if it rolled away the stone for this is no demons are powerful enough to hold yourself be responsible irresponsible and powerful enough to raise you up take you out of your Affliction take you out of your sins please amen amen the prophet of God says in expectations he says and I'll say this God keeps his word every time that he said and every promise he keeps every word that he said and every problem it says if you take the right mental attitude foreign the word of God will defeat the enemy definition anywhere in uh anytime the word of God will defeat the enemy any place anywhere anytime it doesn't matter where you are it doesn't matter what time it is open that word claim it for yourself all I just need is one the word Lord speak the words I had this one testimony one of the brothers were hunting with the prophet and the prophet told his brother that you are going to shoot your dear uh he said you said what yeah I'm going to shoot a deer uh he let the other brothers go and hunt and he went to sleep under a tree and he says if the prophet said I'm going to shoot a deer you know I don't have to go looking for it he went and he slept under a tree then he woke up he said something was sniffing at his toes he got up and he shot it I don't have to go around beating pushes and all that yeah God's word has that power that dear that I'm supposed to shoot is going to come to me promises have enough power to bring your desires to you that may never vote foreign [Music] idea because God has never failed Through the Bible from Genesis 1 to Revelation chapter 20. he has never ever failed why should he start failing on you take him on his word and rest the prophet of God he says nearly everyone that really truly serves God meets them kind of times sometimes you wonder how you're gonna get the kids some shoes for school how are you going to make this bill and that bill come over he says don't worry there's only one thing you need to do yeah rest on his promises I've never seen the righteous foreign foreign before God sends a message he has to prepare a people who can receive that message and it's this last day that you and me towards the more can accept the message amen that message it's a massage did not come from Jefferson that message came from God and that message has enough power to translate your body that message the um that message has enough power change hallelujah hallelujah amen so you and me we gotta become the word he came down to his bride I say sonipus in Isaiah 9 6. unto us a child is born and to us a son is given the government shall be upon him what is government means Authority The Authority is on his shoulders his shoulder is on his body his shoulder is his body Isaiah is telling us that yes the government shall be upon his body and we know who the body of Christ the body of Christ his authority is on you and me Hallelujah in the thinking man's field of the Prophet that God says and later on we got through the sermon yeah and we went out west new and when the Angels up of the Lord appeared out there for the Seven Seals and it went up in the air which is he says which we have the picture amen this is the this is the picture of the clouds there he was standing still wigged with that same supreme authority uh La Plante he is the head of the church he is the head of the body there is nothing like him anyway hallelujah hallelujah that that cloud says representing the white wig representative representing Authority representative he says he's the head of the body and his authorities upon his shoulders so his authority is on the bride so the authority of the word on the Christians the same Authority that says that same Authority is on you this morning everything that was in God was poured into Christ according to the church hallelujah hallelujah so when God the country before the foundation of the world he had that power he kicked Lucifer from Heaven on that Easter uh Easter Saturday is somebody back when Christ went to hell he had that same power that was in God and he kicked Satan in hell that same power remember we can kick Satan on this Earth all his devices all his powers despite however way he might try to come to us we might try to come and afflict you Hallelujah the prophet of God said the prophet is going to come a time in lorento when you're going to say brother I give you Reigns he says the brother will come to your brother and say my farm my crops are dying out yeah this is going to come in time when you can speak and you say brother dear friend I give you rain shall we keep on saying this coming a time we are at the end of time I'm here to tell you that this is the time brother I give you your healing rather you receive your heart's desires Satan you go back to the peaceful house where you belong now what because Christ has trusted his bride I have a confused us on a crisis trusted his Christians Hallelujah and so if God has a covenant with you that says if you did this I will do this he did not say your Covenant because we always failure but he says I will do it you speak the word I will perform it hallelujah hallelujah why do you get to speak because he's trusted you without us we are under Authority the word of God has Authority the same Authority that went to create the whole earth Mountain and Valley
