[5:33] into that part of my life where I see
[5:36] more people that I know you know leaving

[5:45] the past six months you know it's just
[5:47] you know but that's that's the time we
[5:51] live in you know but there won't be any
[5:54] more there it won't be any more tears
[5:59] let's sing childhood a child of the king
[6:03] you know I know I've told you this
[6:06] before but that's a song that's very
[6:09] near and dear to me because sister Kathy
[6:12] I don't know something happened with her
[6:16] the Holy Ghost came down on her one time
[6:18] when she was singing that when she was
[6:20] when she sang that line his royal blood
[6:25] now flows through my veins
[6:27] no she just praised the Lord so I think
[6:30] of that every time I sing it oh yes oh
[6:35] yes I'm a child of the king royal blood
[6:44] now flows through my veins and our who's
[6:51] Richard and while now can sing praise
[6:56] God praise God I'm a child of the king
[7:02] oh yes oh yes I'm a child of the king is
[7:11] royal blood now flows through my veins
[7:16] and ah who's Richard and bile now can
[7:23] sing praise God praise God praise God
[7:29] praise God praise God praise God I'm a
[7:35] child of the king do we really get what
[7:40] that privilege is to say were a child of
[7:44] the king the king Almighty the Lord of
[7:48] lords the great I am the creator of the
[7:51] universe you know oh my it's a it's
[7:55] something that we have to almost set
[7:57] down to meditate on to really catch it
[8:00] almost you know and then we then we
[8:01] can't get it all you know and that very
[8:04] moment that we go to glory all of a
[8:07] sudden we're going to know we're gonna
[8:09] know in a very full way what that really
[8:11] meant
[8:12] and that's something that you know I
[8:15] think about a lot we're because whatever
[8:18] we can think about glory is better than
[8:20] what we can think about because we've
[8:22] never been there
[8:25] that sing we fall down we fall down we
[8:35] lay our crowns at the feet of Jesus the
[8:44] greatness of mercy and love at the feet

[9:33] love at the feet of Jesus we cry holy
[9:41] holy holy we cry holy holy holy we cry

[10:05] think about that day also that day where

[10:15] just want to make it I don't you know
[10:18] you don't have to give me a lot or name
[10:19] your Lord but you know and then I got to
[10:21] think I know I'd like to have some
[10:24] crowns to lay back at his feet because
[10:26] that that's going to be our privilege to
[10:29] do that it's going to honor him let's

[22:17] he's north and the other one is south
[22:21] amen praise the Lord we love the Lord
[22:23] turn with us the idea of the 14th
[22:26] chapter
[22:26] oh I just pray that God would give me
[22:30] the grace to give to the church this
[22:37] evening what he showed me it's it's a
[22:40] revelation I shared it with the brother
[22:42] the other day at the time of the
[22:44] inspiration and he really was blessed by
[22:48] it I is something that I've seen that
[22:52] I'd never seen before it's simple really
[22:54] simple but it's powerful once you see it
[22:58] just given by God and I trust it somehow
[23:02] he would bless you and he blessed me and
[23:05] I know by God's grace I'll never be the
[23:08] same simple simple simple but really
[23:12] powerful
[23:14] Isaiah 14:13 through the 15th first love
[23:19] the Lord everybody there 14 starting at
[23:29] the 13th verse for thou have said in
[23:31] thine heart I will what you didn't take
[23:35] notes that I will a sinner to heaven I
[23:38] will exalt my throne above the stars of
[23:41] God I will sit upon the Mount of the
[23:44] congregation in the side of the north I
[23:47] will ascend above the heights of the
[23:50] clouds I will be like the Most High
[23:54] I think that's five times Satan said
[23:58] these things in his heart yet thou shalt
[24:02] be brought down to hell to the sides of
[24:06] the pit it's so amazing what these
[24:11] scriptures are saying or this particular
[24:13] scripture is saying to us and by God's
[24:17] grace I trust the Lord will give me the
[24:18] grace to bring it out that is very
[24:21] father we come before you we thank you
[24:24] for your goodness we thank you for your
[24:26] grace we thank you for your mercy and
[24:28] your father I pray that somehow you
[24:31] would reveal yeah I can't do it Lord
[24:35] it's you that bring revelation to your
[24:38] people help us now Lord as we minister
[24:42] this to your people I believe it feel
[24:43] will for us to do this otherwise we
[24:46] would not even attempt to be sober so
[24:48] God have thine own way in Jesus Christ's
[24:51] name we pray you may be seated
[24:54] I am titled this message the will of man
[24:59] versus the will of God when the Lord
[25:05] showed me this thing I just couldn't
[25:08] believe that I've been reading so many
[25:09] things about the will of man what we
[25:12] choose to do you know and never thought
[25:16] about where it all began we know that
[25:20] God put us on a free moral agency and
[25:24] evidently all of the angels are that way
[25:27] too
[25:28] but when I thought about the will when
[25:34] we talk about will it means the power of
[25:36] choosing one's own actions or they act a
[25:40] process of using or certain one's choice
[25:45] wish or desire or to submit against
[25:49] one's will
[25:50] it is a purpose or determination even
[25:54] holiday or stubborn determination a
[25:57] willfulness to have the will to succeed
[26:01] and we understand that when we talk
[26:03] about a will you know a lot of time we
[26:07] say you know that person is stubborn you
[26:11] can say whatever you want to say to him
[26:13] or her and they still will not do what
[26:17] you asked them to do and what it is
[26:19] they've made a choice to assert their
[26:23] will over yours and when we think about
[26:26] the wheel we understand that Lucifer had
[26:30] a will and we don't know how long he
[26:34] served God until this evil was found in
[26:39] him but I want you to understand that
[26:41] his will to do evil was carried on to a
[26:48] third or whatever more angels of heaven
[26:50] and they all began to refuse to do what
[26:54] God's will was whatever it was now my
[26:58] thought was that Satan introduced what
[27:01] we call selfishness the angels in heaven
[27:06] all was one family was one church was
[27:10] one body if you want to see it like that
[27:12] and they always concerned about God's
[27:14] will not their own and we understand
[27:19] that when Satan's began to think of what
[27:22] he wanted to do versus what God wanted
[27:25] him to do it literally polluted heaven
[27:28] and there in heaven only the Word of God
[27:32] is exalted we understand by God's grace
[27:35] that when Lucifer began to do what he
[27:40] did as I said
[27:42] was like Lebanon 11 amen
[27:45] a portion of heaven and God had to cut
[27:49] that piece of leavening out and and well
[27:53] and they these angels that were will for
[27:56] self will became angels of disobedience
[28:00] and they were cast down to earth now
[28:05] selfishness is when one devoted is
[28:09] devoted to or caring only for oneself
[28:12] remember me said I will I will I will
[28:15] and maybe he thought about this or not I
[28:18] don't know of the other angels but one
[28:22] thing for certain God caught it in his
[28:25] heart before it was ever expressed now
[28:29] God was not ignorant God knew exactly
[28:31] what he was going to do before God
[28:34] created the angel we understand that God
[28:37] created vessels of Honor and vessels of
[28:40] dishonor or the venom basically talks
[28:43] about Lucifer in the sense that he
[28:46] really wasn't part of the family
[28:50] remember the scripture says if they
[28:52] would leave out from you they were not
[28:55] of you in the beginning now we're not
[28:58] talking about like I said a little SETI
[29:00] when somebody left us you know no we're
[29:02] talking about if they would leave the
[29:04] Word of God then that declares that they
[29:07] really were not part of you now we look
[29:10] at this day and it comes right on down
[29:11] and Lucifer comes and he's working with
[29:14] Adam and even he works with eat because
[29:17] a many understand Adam was the very word
[29:20] he was the original net
[29:21] it couldn't be hybridized and we know by
[29:25] God's grace that here Lucifer comes down
[29:27] and let me say like this before
[29:30] Lucifer thought came out in in how can I
[29:37] say it
[29:37] Lord Hawk in Lucifer when he thought
[29:41] these things as I said but before he
[29:45] thought what he thought there was no
[29:48] other thoughts available with but God
[29:51] and nobody knew of a rebellion nobody
[29:55] no angel in heaven ever thought about
[29:57] disobeying God in the no angel he was
[30:01] the first one that disobeyed God and and
[30:05] and and now he's contrary to the word
[30:08] and and he's spreading his lie among the
[30:12] Angels and God allowed it ha because God
[30:17] knew that those fallen angels would be
[30:20] used for this day and other days but
[30:25] here we find out by God's grace that
[30:27] here the devil comes along and not God
[30:29] tell Adam and Eve whatever you do this
[30:32] is my thoughts stay with my thoughts do
[30:38] my will and you'll be okay the day that
[30:42] you eat of this tree you shall surely
[30:45] die
[30:46] don't touch it and others don't even
[30:50] have fellowship with it and see you and
[30:53] I we thought for a long time that this
[30:55] tree of the knowledge of good and evil
[30:57] was just a tree and we didn't know that
[31:00] that word the tree in Genesis was just
[31:03] symbolic it was a symbolism of a person
[31:06] that God created was raised up himself
[31:09] and we realized Amen that when Lucifer
[31:12] in the form of a serpent and when I said
[31:14] like that he he possessed the serpent he
[31:17] talked to the serpent and the serpent
[31:19] was an intelligent being brother Adam
[31:22] said the only difference between that
[31:23] serpent and Adam was that the serpent
[31:25] did not have a place for the soul and we
[31:28] really had he didn't he had a place for
[31:30] the so but he had no soul so we realized
[31:33] by God's grace that this devil was able
[31:36] to talk to this being amen and we find
[31:39] out that this being was able to talk to
[31:43] Adam and Eve now you got to realize a
[31:46] man that he talks to Eve and he gets eat
[31:49] to think off of the word I'm gonna bring
[31:54] it he gets Eve to think off the word and
[31:58] when she began to think off the words
[31:59] she did what began to process her
[32:02] thoughts and her thoughts became
[32:05] reasonable see that reasoning is
[32:09] something else her thoughts became
[32:11] reasonable surely and that's why the
[32:14] devil says surely you will not die when
[32:18] God had already said to her the day that
[32:20] you eat of the street you should surely
[32:22] die right and so now she he's doing the
[32:26] same thing to her that he had done to
[32:29] others and and you know he himself
[32:31] believed his lie he believes it to this
[32:35] day
[32:36] and we realized Amen that he he said
[32:39] well what do you mean brother burrows
[32:41] understand that here was he Adam as well
[32:44] who stood face to face with the Tree of
[32:48] Life talked to the Tree of Life
[32:51] walk with the Tree of Life in the cool
[32:53] of the evening fellowship with the Tree
[32:55] of Life you got to understand that the
[32:58] tree of life was not a tree as we look
[33:00] at as the oak or pine the Tree of Life
[33:02] with Jesus Christ himself because you'll
[33:05] find out a man like I said the Bible
[33:08] said the voice of God walked in the cool
[33:10] of the evening you've never seen a voice
[33:11] walk unless the person that divorced is
[33:15] walking a man so we find out a man that
[33:18] Eve stood face-to-face with the tree of
[33:21] life he fellowship but for whatever
[33:23] reason that day she listened to the
[33:27] serpent right and we find out because
[33:31] she listened to the serpent she now
[33:34] leaned to her own understanding and her
[33:37] own understanding brought death right oh
[33:42] you said well that was he what about
[33:44] Judas who fellowship with Jesus what
[33:46] about three and a half years face to
[33:48] face the same tree of life and he leaned
[33:51] to his own understanding why because it
[33:54] was selfishness selfishness was the
[33:59] thing that made Lucifer fall he only
[34:03] considered himself he only thought about
[34:06] himself he only was concerned about
[34:09] himself whether you realize it or not
[34:11] he's still the same way he has not
[34:15] changed he will cause you to lie steal
[34:18] cheat to promote himself it's not you
[34:23] but he will use you to make his program
[34:26] work it's all about Lucifer he has no
[34:30] love
[34:31] he has no care it's all about the devil
[34:35] all right
[34:36] because remember even in the book of
[34:38] Revelation he raised up all these
[34:40] nations and everybody's looking at this
[34:43] man say is this the man now you don't
[34:47] use me in devil and a I'm going I'm lost
[34:51] hallelujah now I realize that God's Word
[34:54] is true right you know the scripture
[34:56] said if the blind lead the blind they
[34:58] both should fall in a ditch I'm bringing
[35:01] this because we realized that every deed
[35:06] where this lying cheating stealing it's
[35:09] based upon selfishness hello it's a
[35:15] selfish thing and you never think about
[35:18] nothing else at that point in time but
[35:20] yourself you're not in concern or
[35:23] considering him in the harm and the
[35:25] danger and everything else and then it
[35:27] brings a punch someone else you're just
[35:29] trying to protect yourself hallelujah is
[35:33] that right that's what Jesus said if a
[35:35] man tries to save his life he shall lose
[35:41] it
[35:41] it's only when we're willing to lose our
[35:44] life we can gain it back is that Alright
[35:49] well you saw it what about Ananias afar
[35:52] who supposedly was at one of the
[35:54] greatest if not the greatest because
[35:56] that's when it all started
[35:57] Pentecost to revive or when people
[35:59] raised from the dead rise in divine or
[36:01] anything else and then they stand before
[36:03] the Apostles and said you know we show
[36:05] this thing for this is such-and-such
[36:08] money and so we given you such and such
[36:10] money and God says why did you lie to
[36:12] the Holy Spirit she it was selfishness
[36:15] and then Peter said was it not yours you
[36:18] could have sold it for whatever prize
[36:20] you could have kept the whole thing you
[36:22] didn't even have to tell me you know you
[36:24] sold it and you didn't have to give me
[36:26] anything why would you and your wife
[36:28] said about and conspired to lie see what
[36:34] it was selfishness
[36:37] and it was silly forgive me it didn't
[36:40] make any sense had a nicer fire doesn't
[36:43] make sense to me because they meant they
[36:46] didn't have to do anything but you see
[36:48] they wanted to be in the light of men as
[36:50] doing a good deed right oh they gave so
[36:54] much money you know but in the eyes of
[36:56] God they lied because they said they
[36:58] sold it for that's $100 but they took
[37:02] 21:24
[37:03] get him 87 no this is how we this is how
[37:05] much money we got forward they wanted
[37:08] the appearance of giving all when they
[37:10] did not give it off you understand me so
[37:14] we look at this thing as your what do
[37:16] you mean brother it's your will that's
[37:20] in your way and that's how come you and
[37:23] I must die to our will well whose will
[37:27] are we going to live by the Word of God
[37:29] the Word of God is the will of God and
[37:34] we must never allow ourselves a men to
[37:39] override the will of the word whenever
[37:41] we allow ourselves to override the will
[37:44] of the word it becomes sinful right
[37:48] because we want we understand listen
[37:51] what John 8 and we didn't understand
[37:54] harm how could I said I was talking
[37:55] about origin and we understand Amen that
[37:57] Lucifer was at the beginning he was up
[38:00] in heaven right he was wherever God was
[38:04] but then he was cast out of heaven all
[38:06] him and his angels that followed him
[38:10] right they were cast out so now they're
[38:13] in a place that is beneath right so
[38:17] Jesus explains to us and he said ye are
[38:21] and he talking to the Pharisees and
[38:22] Sadducees in John 8 23 24 he said unto
[38:26] them ye are from beneath I am from above
[38:30] ye are of this world I am not of this
[38:34] world
[38:35] I said therefore to you that ye should
[38:38] die in your sins
[38:39] but if you believe not excuse me that I
[38:44] am he you should die in your sins and I
[38:49] was thinking about that and
[38:51] I thought isn't that right no wonder the
[38:53] prophet of God said God will stand with
[38:55] us now because we stood with him being
[38:58] everybody did not believe but Lucifer
[39:01] put out everybody did not see it the way
[39:05] Lucifer saw it there were many angels
[39:07] that believed that God was God and His
[39:12] will was the perfect thing to do
[39:14] hallelujah and because he men they
[39:16] believed that his will was the perfect
[39:18] thing to do they did not fall huh have a
[39:23] choice just like you and I have a choice
[39:26] right but they knew that this was
[39:30] correct the Word of God whatever Elohim
[39:34] say do it right listen Jesus goes on and
[39:41] it talks about our kingdom our kingdom
[39:43] you must understand that this is why we
[39:46] are here today and that is to do the
[39:49] will of God for today
[39:51] right not build an ark right you know
[39:57] you know what we're here to do the will
[39:59] of God for today no matter what we must
[40:03] go through we must do his will right
[40:07] jesus answered in john 18 he said My
[40:11] Kingdom is not of this world if if my
[40:14] kingdom were of this world then would my
[40:16] servants fight that I should not be
[40:18] delivered to the Jews but now is my
[40:21] kingdom not from hence he said now it is
[40:24] not from hints and so therefore I must
[40:27] be delivered unto the Jews otherwise my
[40:30] kind would defend me
[40:32] Pilate therefore said unto Him art thou
[40:34] a king then and jesus answered now say
[40:39] it that I am a king to this end was I
[40:41] born and for this cause came I into the
[40:44] world that I should bear witness unto
[40:46] the truth every one that is of the truth
[40:49] heareth my voice hallelujah
[40:53] so now Jesus is trying to explain and
[40:56] he's trying to tell these people there
[40:58] is a truth and there is a lie right the
[41:01] the lie came from that one that is be me
[41:05] the truth comes from the one that is
[41:08] from above and we realized by God's
[41:11] grace Amen you sure what do you mean
[41:13] because Jesus even explained my words
[41:16] are true Oh
[41:18] as I think about Jesus enough I don't
[41:20] want to get ahead of myself because I
[41:22] really want you to catch it just
[41:24] meditate on this
[41:25] I can't explain it but I'm trying by
[41:28] Scripture what this means to me
[41:30] because I realize when we say I
[41:34] surrender all we're literally saying I
[41:38] surrender all my will
[41:43] I'm surrending all my will if I find
[41:47] that my will is contrary to the word I
[41:49] surrender hmm that's what I want I want
[41:54] I want to surrender all my being to to
[41:57] the will of God for this day right
[42:02] listen the Bible according to
[42:04] Philippians 2:4 thrace's look not every
[42:06] man on his own things but every man also
[42:10] on the things of others what is the
[42:13] scripture telling us that we are so we
[42:16] are not to live for ourselves we are to
[42:19] live for others and I thought about that
[42:22] us and how many Christians are really
[42:24] living for other people we're so
[42:27] concerned about our selves and what it
[42:29] what's going to make us right or
[42:31] comfortable or whatever the case may be
[42:32] and that's not what God wants I'll go to
[42:36] that in just a minute let this mind be
[42:38] in you which was also in Christ Jesus
[42:41] who being in the form of God thought it
[42:44] not robbery to be equal with God this is
[42:46] what I look at looking at but made
[42:49] himself of no reputation and took upon
[42:51] him the form of a servant and was made
[42:54] in the likeness of man God God humbled
[42:59] himself to his own will he was a god man
[43:07] he really could have turned the stone
[43:10] into bread huh he could have done a lot
[43:14] of things amen but his will God's will
[43:17] for him
[43:18] was not to perform for others he came to
[43:24] do one thing and that was to prove that
[43:28] he was from the truth and to prove to
[43:32] mankind this is what you should be but
[43:36] because of Satan's lie you have passed
[43:40] your theophany and now you are in the
[43:42] situation you're in now because of a lie
[43:46] a lie that was believed by Eve
[43:51] hallelujah you understand me
[43:54] the reason why we are who we are right
[43:56] now is because somebody told a lie and
[44:00] was not willing to obey God Lucifer
[44:05] himself because he believed the lie
[44:07] could not affect mankind until he made
[44:09] mankind believe the lie what was the lie
[44:15] surely you will not die you break one
[44:22] word you're not going to die oh that
[44:25] scene ain't so bad huh and that's the
[44:29] way the devil makes us reason when God
[44:31] says is bad the day you should sin the
[44:34] day you will die did they die absolutely
[44:37] they die is that Alright but it was
[44:43] God's will
[44:44] amen to show what a man's purpose for
[44:47] for him in this world and that was they
[44:50] know you be a God I made you that I made
[44:53] Adam a god of this earth amen but God
[44:56] being that he was a god he was to be my
[44:59] servant huh yes and Adam was perfect
[45:04] until he allowed the light to take him
[45:07] and when I say this he loved his wife so
[45:09] much so he purposely did what he did
[45:13] plunged us all into what we call a life
[45:17] of lies everything you see around you is
[45:21] a lie Satan takes education and he blows
[45:25] it up why why he pushes that that
[45:28] reasoning in a new
[45:30] to process this and process that and
[45:32] come up with your own conclusion about
[45:34] certain matters and that's death leave
[45:38] Matt to your own understanding is that
[45:42] right that's what I did she leads her
[45:45] own understanding and when she did the
[45:47] by say listen we all take knowledge to
[45:50] the Lord in all our ways yay
[45:53] you may not even know how to read all
[45:55] right but if you acknowledge God he will
[45:57] direct your path huh that's the only way
[46:01] we are supposed to live it's not by
[46:06] education in science is by the will of
[46:09] God who being in the form of God thought
[46:13] it not robbery to be equal with God but
[46:15] made himself of no reputation and took
[46:18] upon him the form of a servant and was
[46:20] made in the likeness of men and being
[46:21] found in fashion as a man he humbled
[46:24] himself and became obedient to death
[46:28] even the death of the cross we look at
[46:31] the sting as well what are you saying
[46:33] you and I have no idea the battle that
[46:35] Jesus had in the Garden of Gethsemane
[46:37] the Bible said it was so intense the
[46:40] sweat of his brow was like blood drops
[46:43] of blood hallelujah he was really doing
[46:47] what moving himself out of the way
[46:50] because I'm gonna tell you something God
[46:53] left him with his own wheel God will
[46:58] give you the Holy Ghost but God will
[47:01] give let you still have your own will
[47:04] mmm and what happened he understood his
[47:08] purpose for coming and he wanted to do
[47:10] the purpose listen even Jesus declared I
[47:14] can do nothing except I see my father
[47:16] doing it I'm not gonna get out of that
[47:19] man listen he went to the the Pool of
[47:21] Bethesda hallelujah and we don't know
[47:26] how many people were there sick and the
[47:29] Prophet God said the man with the bed he
[47:31] wasn't he wasn't the sickest of all of
[47:33] them but God told him this is the one
[47:35] what was that a test this is the one I
[47:39] want you to pray for he prayed for the
[47:42] man take up your bed
[47:44] walk hallelujah he didn't look like a
[47:47] great Messiah then when hundreds of
[47:49] people no doubt was sick there and only
[47:51] one man got healed that day hallelujah
[47:56] what about Lazarus when last when he
[47:59] found that lad was sick and he was a
[48:01] prophet of God Jesus Christ deep prophet
[48:04] amen hearing about Lazarus dying all
[48:07] these things and you know here he was he
[48:10] couldn't move he couldn't move and you
[48:12] you don't think as a man his heart went
[48:14] out philosophers Oh did but he knew
[48:18] though the power healing was in him he
[48:21] could not move until he seen it
[48:23] till he heard it right you know we
[48:27] wouldn't have understood that until God
[48:29] sent us a prophet and we saw how he
[48:31] moved out of the will of God is that
[48:34] right remember when he healed that baby
[48:36] or he God told him where the house was
[48:40] and you know what the wife was wearing
[48:41] but the man's wife was wearing with the
[48:44] look Baal would be wearing everything
[48:45] else and he got ahead of God he got
[48:47] ahead of the vision and then when he
[48:50] prayed for that baby
[48:52] amen being ahead of the vision the baby
[48:54] got sicker and looked like he was going
[48:55] to die the probably God had to ask God
[48:58] to forgive him from moving so fast you
[49:01] see no man gets the glory hmm so that's
[49:05] why I believe that the third pole is God
[49:07] alone nobody will get the glory right
[49:11] you know how we do all brother so-and-so
[49:14] pray for me and when you do that as a
[49:16] prophet of God said most people look at
[49:18] the brother instead of God hallelujah
[49:22] lean not to your own understanding
[49:24] that's what he's gotten I listen to you
[49:26] today and we find out amen but this
[49:28] thing that God is doing now no man will
[49:31] be able to get the credit because it'll
[49:32] be God alone Satan won't imitate this
[49:36] one hallelujah but when a man is
[49:39] involved Satan can duplicate it he can
[49:42] make it look right hallelujah oh my when
[49:47] God began to work and he is working
[49:49] why because I thought to myself Lord how
[49:52] simple how simple this is seeing that
[49:56] the will of man is the
[49:58] thing that's really hindering the bride
[49:59] of Jesus Christ God say get down on your
[50:03] knees and pray and your will say I don't
[50:05] feel like it hallelujah or your will
[50:09] might say you know I'm so tired I sleep
[50:11] I pray I'll sleep a little bit now wake
[50:13] up and pray mmm you said brother ones
[50:16] how you know that I've said it I've done
[50:19] it
[50:20] hallelujah amen I'm a man and I've seen
[50:24] my will when God began to deal with this
[50:26] I'm like oh my god how many times have
[50:29] my own wheel got in God's Way hallelujah
[50:37] think about it God will always test you
[50:40] in your will because he told Nathan go
[50:43] tell Dave now Nathan has already told
[50:46] David David you want to build this
[50:47] temple do what so ever that's in your
[50:50] heart God comes back to Nathan said nah
[50:53] uh-uh
[50:54] David has too much blood on his hand now
[50:59] you go back and tell David that no he
[51:02] won't be the one to build the temple
[51:04] it'll be his son Solomon now you know
[51:07] the scripture tells us that they said
[51:09] now for promised prophet prophesied
[51:11] something and is wrong you don't have to
[51:14] believe him and you know the devil was
[51:16] fighting Nathan but guess what he
[51:19] humbled himself went back to Nathan and
[51:22] begged back to David and told David
[51:24] listen I was wrong I prophesied I said
[51:29] David whatsoever I don't hard do it and
[51:33] God says not so mmm that's a real man of
[51:36] God when you can submit to the will of
[51:38] God no matter like brother Brown said
[51:40] even though if you feel like you're
[51:41] skinning yourself do what's right what
[51:46] about John when God told John you go
[51:49] tell Herod over there you don't got your
[51:53] brother's wife and that's not your own
[51:55] y'all knew he was gonna be killed how
[51:59] many of us would have done that but you
[52:03] see when you see you have to do with the
[52:06] shepherds they do
[52:10] what about Jeremiah who preached all
[52:12] those years to do Israel and no one is
[52:14] really one gonna repair look at his Iike
[52:19] what he had to do and disease that I
[52:21] looked in the wall and what did I see
[52:23] you know you you understand me what I'm
[52:25] trying to say is that God would test
[52:27] your will huh
[52:31] he told Peter listen Peter said Lord if
[52:34] that be you you said that's me made me
[52:38] come
[52:38] he said come he tested his will don't
[52:43] ask God for something if you're not
[52:45] willing to go all the way with him right
[52:48] always allowing your will to the Word of
[52:51] God and you will always come out right
[52:55] proverbs 3:5 through asia's trust in the
[52:58] Lord with all thine heart lean not unto
[53:01] thine own understanding in all that ways
[53:05] acknowledge him and he shall direct thy
[53:08] paths you know how this message came I
[53:11] was talking to a brother I said brother
[53:13] I am trying my best to serve people to
[53:19] get out of the way so that I can live
[53:22] for them not not realizing what I see I
[53:24] had just that's it and then thoughts
[53:27] start coming he's all my good you don't
[53:30] know what you just see huh trust in the
[53:36] Lord
[53:36] right be not wise in their own eyes fear
[53:39] the Lord and depart from evil see what
[53:42] it is Lucifer was wise in his own eyes
[53:46] oh I believe that he could turn back the
[53:50] hands of time and change the things he
[53:53] would probably try to do it but you know
[53:54] what he can't he was literally made and
[53:58] God knew he would do it and he had all
[54:03] was appointed to be the adversary of the
[54:08] Living God
[54:13] it really blesses me I don't know what
[54:16] I'm getting it over to you all I know is
[54:18] that your will in my will must die
[54:22] Matthew 6:9 through ten said after this
[54:25] manner therefore pray ye because they
[54:27] wanted to know how to pray why didn't
[54:29] Jesus say well I tell you what the story
[54:31] you pray Lord blessed me with a million
[54:33] dollars he never said nothing about
[54:37] these things because he realized that
[54:40] God is gonna automatically give you the
[54:42] things that you need in this world is
[54:44] that right considered a lily he said
[54:47] consider the sparrow he said those are
[54:50] the things that the father do you know
[54:52] and we find out amen that he gets this
[54:55] and he says after this manner therefore
[54:57] pray ye our Father which art in heaven
[55:00] hallowed be thy name
[55:03] see that's positionally placing God thy
[55:05] kingdom come thy will be done in earth
[55:09] as it is in heaven
[55:11] huh Lord I want to do what you want me
[55:16] to do in earth as I would do in heaven
[55:20] what were you do in heaven if God says
[55:23] say jump fifty times you jump into time
[55:26] before you know it Wow
[55:29] there ain't nobody in heaven no angel
[55:31] disobeying God God give God got rid of
[55:33] all the troublemakers and now he's given
[55:38] us the Holy Ghost because the Holy Ghost
[55:41] is the thing that caused I don't know
[55:44] how can I said Jesus Christ the God in
[55:46] him may him completely obedient how can
[55:51] God fail his own word he came he lived
[55:55] it and that's the thing Adam would not
[55:57] Adam willfully sin
[55:59] there was no temptation he willfully sin
[56:03] and when you got the Holy Ghost it is to
[56:08] kill your desire that God's will will be
[56:12] done throughout your life that's what we
[56:15] got it for we didn't get it to jump
[56:18] shout and do all these things we came to
[56:20] live the word to make the world see that
[56:24] God is still God and then a
[56:27] people a man who's still living the word
[56:30] hallelujah we'd rather die hallelujah
[56:34] then the break the word that's the way
[56:37] it should be we have to die to our
[56:42] what's up will I think about Peter Peter
[56:47] was self-willed before he got the Holy
[56:49] Ghost he was ready to cut that man's
[56:51] head off hallelujah good thing he ducked
[56:55] and Peter got the ear right but look at
[56:59] the will of God the will of God says no
[57:02] Peter puts it back on look like that man
[57:07] with the file downs the old Lord thou
[57:08] art God he didn't he didn't I often
[57:12] think is that the same soldiers said
[57:14] that they said it at the foot of Jesus
[57:17] this is truly the son of God if that be
[57:21] him I don't know he may have been the
[57:23] same one that God put the ear back on
[57:25] and then he saw Jesus and heard him say
[57:27] Father forgive them for they know not
[57:29] what they do y'all understand me this
[57:32] whole world is alive and God who is
[57:35] Jesus Christ can he's the only one that
[57:37] could bring us to truth and the bow
[57:39] ended and we realized what is truth thy
[57:43] Word is truth his word is truth the
[57:46] truth about us is that we're fallin sons
[57:50] of God we were not created for this we
[57:55] were created for the world to come you
[57:57] say well brother books what are you
[57:59] saying I'm being recreated you're being
[58:03] recreated into the image and likeness of
[58:05] God hallelujah to me amen this what
[58:09] we're now experiencing it's the greatest
[58:11] creation of all you saw what do you mean
[58:14] the Bible said the first Adam he
[58:16] produced his own image that image
[58:19] brought about a death hallelujah but the
[58:22] Bible said the second Adam who's Jesus
[58:24] Christ and then he comes around and he's
[58:26] a quickening spirit and guess what he
[58:29] produces himself that's why God stepped
[58:31] out of the church ages hallelujah this
[58:34] is a new creation hallelujah this is
[58:38] Jesus Christ creating him
[58:40] if you want to put it that way the Bible
[58:42] said God Jesus Christ the beginning of
[58:45] creation huh
[58:48] we God men he saw what do you mean this
[58:52] creation is greater than the first Adams
[58:55] creation because this creation will will
[59:03] bypass death who eternal life brother
[59:10] branham saying is living for others you
[59:13] said well what do you mean think about
[59:15] it
[59:15] ruth types us out Naomi and Ruth and
[59:19] Ruth says unto Naomi your people is my
[59:22] people your God is my God where you die
[59:25] I'll die where you're buried I'm buried
[59:27] I want to die yourself she was willing
[59:32] to die to all of her more bite his
[59:35] teachings her family was dead to her her
[59:39] culture was dead to her her City was
[59:42] dead to her she died to everything to
[59:46] follow Naomi and this is what we must
[59:49] understand we must die to all our Crees
[59:52] died to all our fears died to everything
[59:56] that will hinder you from following
[59:59] Jesus Christ
[1:00:00] everything amen it's just your will you
[1:00:03] got to say lord help me here I need to
[1:00:06] die to this I need to die to that I need
[1:00:08] to die and as you as you die to yourself
[1:00:11] then what happens they meant didn't you
[1:00:13] see a real rotting come in then what you
[1:00:16] mean then after a while there will be no
[1:00:18] desire to do those things anymore help
[1:00:22] me Lord but the Rebbe said he died to
[1:00:27] reveal himself to us now let us die to
[1:00:31] self to reveal him to others now you
[1:00:35] can't have your own wheel cairn on a man
[1:00:38] and call yourself a Christian people see
[1:00:41] that ugly side of yourself
[1:00:43] if that's the Christian I'd only have
[1:00:45] nothing to do with not having a
[1:00:46] Christian that's just your wheel they
[1:00:48] don't understand the battle that we have
[1:00:50] but one thing for sure God will test
[1:00:53] your will
[1:00:55] so how was Peter change Peter was
[1:00:58] changed right because we realize we saw
[1:01:01] Peter when Jesus was being betrayed
[1:01:04] Peter and the restaurant
[1:01:06] ran and Peter did not in three times why
[1:01:09] he did not want to die but we find out
[1:01:13] when Jesus come back to Peter and said
[1:01:15] Noah Peter you got to go back Peter
[1:01:18] immediately went back why because he
[1:01:21] didn't want his will to be seen he only
[1:01:24] wanted the will of God Lord if it's my
[1:01:26] time to die I'm going to die in that
[1:01:29] powerful that's powerful it's all will
[1:01:32] it's all what you will to be right and I
[1:01:38] earnest desire is to be like Jesus so
[1:01:43] we're going to be tested people we've
[1:01:45] got to be tested and listen I want you
[1:01:47] to think from now on after tonight I
[1:01:50] want you to think when something is
[1:01:51] required of you to do or to say Lord
[1:01:55] move my will I don't care you got to say
[1:01:59] it to a brother say it if you gotta say
[1:02:01] it to a sister say it whatever you need
[1:02:03] to do to fulfill the will of God do it
[1:02:08] well I will get my feelings hurt who
[1:02:10] cares about your feelings he that's
[1:02:12] selfishness that's not God selfishness
[1:02:17] because the Word of God must come first
[1:02:20] not your will selfishness we're all
[1:02:24] guilty hello
[1:02:26] I know this ain't okay I got to
[1:02:30] everybody else it's the truth I know you
[1:02:35] said it inside but it's okay none of us
[1:02:37] like I said the pot cake called a killer
[1:02:40] black cuz we are in the same condition
[1:02:42] we need the mercy and grace of God now
[1:02:49] the first thing in this message he goes
[1:02:51] now the first thing I want to say is
[1:02:53] Jesus never lived for himself his life
[1:02:57] was spent for others that's perfectly
[1:02:59] eternal life huh when your life is spent
[1:03:02] for others when you say you go to church
[1:03:04] and you do good things that's fine but
[1:03:07] when
[1:03:07] you live your life to yourself you
[1:03:10] haven't eternal life eternal life is
[1:03:13] living for others it proved it when it
[1:03:16] come in the Lamb of God he lived and had
[1:03:19] eternal life because he did not live for
[1:03:22] himself he lived for others and you
[1:03:25] receive eternal life by receiving that
[1:03:27] day and you don't live for yourself
[1:03:30] no more you live for others someone said
[1:03:33] how can you stand letting some anybody
[1:03:35] call you such bad names you don't live
[1:03:38] for yourself you you you live for others
[1:03:41] that you might redeem that man you
[1:03:44] become sons and the trouble of it is the
[1:03:47] church has been forgot they were sons
[1:03:50] you're a son you're taking Christ's
[1:03:52] place you're a son so don't live for
[1:03:55] yourself live for others oh my he said
[1:03:59] well brother branham I can live for this
[1:04:01] brother because he sure is a nice man
[1:04:03] that's not it live for that man who
[1:04:07] hates you live for that person who would
[1:04:10] kill you if they could that's what they
[1:04:13] don't that's what they done to him they
[1:04:16] killed him and he died that he might
[1:04:18] save them that's eternal life when you
[1:04:22] that's in your bosom
[1:04:24] your faith in heaven then but you
[1:04:26] sacrifice your own things
[1:04:28] give them up like the Sheep gives up
[1:04:31] wool you look off to water Calvary I
[1:04:34] hope this helps you to get in place
[1:04:37] that's what the tabernacle that's what
[1:04:40] all people has to God got to do is find
[1:04:43] out what you are and what's the purpose
[1:04:46] see Church isn't going to church just to
[1:04:49] play music sing songs church is a place
[1:04:51] where correction judgment begins at the
[1:04:54] house of God we must reckon ourselves
[1:04:57] dead and alive to Christ then he made
[1:05:01] the way that we could sacrifice
[1:05:03] ourselves to his service to follow him
[1:05:06] if we follow him we lead the life that
[1:05:09] he lived that's wonderful jesus said and
[1:05:14] spoke of it let me just give you a few
[1:05:16] quotes quotations on it listen close
[1:05:19] don't miss it
[1:05:20] Jesus said at that day
[1:05:21] he would separate the people like the
[1:05:24] sheep and the goats he would say to the
[1:05:27] ghost stand on the on the left side and
[1:05:29] to the Sheep stand on the right side and
[1:05:32] he said to the goats depart from me
[1:05:34] because I was hungry you didn't feed me
[1:05:37] I was in prison you did not visit me I
[1:05:40] was naked and you clothed me not I was
[1:05:43] thirsty and you gave me no drink I was
[1:05:45] sick and you didn't visit me so depart
[1:05:48] from me see what I'm saying see what
[1:05:50] your will would get you your will gets
[1:05:54] you in trouble with God when you don't
[1:05:57] listen to him
[1:05:58] then what happened why just like I said
[1:06:00] one time up a long time ago I think it
[1:06:03] was I had like $50 of whatever God said
[1:06:05] give that man $50 I said that's all I
[1:06:07] have and he responded that's all I asked
[1:06:09] you to give God tells you to give
[1:06:17] something you're not gonna get something
[1:06:19] in return you ought to know the voice of
[1:06:21] God by now now you're not giving it to
[1:06:25] get nothing in return but understand
[1:06:27] brother Brennan said God will not old
[1:06:29] any man anything if God tell you to do
[1:06:34] it don't worry about it he gonna come
[1:06:36] back you'd be surprised I've seen him do
[1:06:37] it many times and on the ship he said I
[1:06:41] was hungry you fed me I was naked and
[1:06:43] you gave me clothing I was sick and you
[1:06:45] missed you ministered to me and notice
[1:06:48] don't fail to get this church keep this
[1:06:51] in your heart forever
[1:06:53] it was so unconsciously done the people
[1:06:57] don't do it for line-of-duty a man that
[1:07:00] gives you something another because he
[1:07:03] ought to do it a man that feeds you
[1:07:05] because he ought to do it he's got a
[1:07:08] selfish idea it should be your very life
[1:07:12] your very action it was so surprising to
[1:07:16] these sheep that they said Lord when you
[1:07:19] when were you're hungry and we wouldn't
[1:07:22] feed we feed you and when were you
[1:07:24] hungry and we fed you when were you
[1:07:26] naked and we gave give you clothes when
[1:07:28] were you thirst and we give you drink
[1:07:30] when were you sick and we gave we
[1:07:32] minister you he said it was so automatic
[1:07:35] out of love just your life lived in them
[1:07:38] God let the people see what Calvary did
[1:07:41] for us so automatically when you win
[1:07:45] were you Lord we never knew that she'd
[1:07:48] look what Jesus turn is saying in so
[1:07:51] much as you've done it unto the least
[1:07:52] you did it unto me
[1:07:54] she unselfish life not the second
[1:07:58] thought not to think about it but you
[1:08:00] are so dead to the things of this world
[1:08:03] and so live in Christ and so walking on
[1:08:05] the highway that these things are just
[1:08:07] an automatic thing you just do it not
[1:08:11] saying well now the Lord would Lord want
[1:08:14] me to do that it's not that you just put
[1:08:18] just part of him his life is in you and
[1:08:22] you act the way he acted do you get it
[1:08:26] see it's the way he acted he never even
[1:08:29] thought about his reputation we went
[1:08:31] down the Simon house and a woman a man
[1:08:33] was there even coming here Fame woman
[1:08:35] came he goes oh my god I can't let her
[1:08:37] touch me they know they looking at me
[1:08:39] I'm trying to win nice old but you see
[1:08:41] he knew that was the will of God he said
[1:08:43] still and let that woman do what she
[1:08:45] needed to do regardless to what the
[1:08:48] others thought all right it was
[1:08:51] automatic that message is dead that day
[1:08:54] on Calvary she that's what I just read
[1:08:56] from listen but the Bible said according
[1:08:59] to John 1:12 2:13 but as many as
[1:09:01] received him to them gave he the power
[1:09:05] to become the sons of God even to them
[1:09:08] that believe on his name so what is it
[1:09:10] to become the sons of God to become a
[1:09:12] son of God is to become a man or woman
[1:09:15] that is now transformed from selfishness
[1:09:18] from cell to Jesus Christ servant
[1:09:27] unselfishness is where we come from
[1:09:31] selfishness to unselfishness right even
[1:09:35] to them that believe on his name which
[1:09:37] were born not of blood nor of the will
[1:09:40] of God or of the flesh nor of the will
[1:09:43] of man but of God born of God that means
[1:09:47] in
[1:09:47] you must become God you borning him your
[1:09:50] son of God you act like him you walk
[1:09:52] like if you talk like him most of all
[1:09:54] obedient like you hope you being blessed
[1:10:00] see the first act of sin was by the will
[1:10:03] of man that write Genesis 3 a says and
[1:10:07] they heard the voice of the Lord God
[1:10:09] walking in their art garden in the cool
[1:10:11] of the evening of the day and Adam and
[1:10:13] his wife hid themselves from the
[1:10:15] presence of the Lord God amongst the
[1:10:17] trees of the garden and the Lord God
[1:10:20] called him to Adam and said unto Him
[1:10:22] where art thou and he said I heard thy
[1:10:25] voice in the garden and I was afraid
[1:10:27] because I was naked and I hid myself and
[1:10:30] he said who told thee that thou was
[1:10:33] naked has thou eaten of the tree whereof
[1:10:35] I commanded thee that thou should not
[1:10:37] eat and he and the man said the woman he
[1:10:41] never answered the question correctly
[1:10:43] the woman whom thou gave it to be with
[1:10:47] me she gave me of the tree and I did eat
[1:10:50] let me go back where of I command is he
[1:10:53] and he said who told you that I was
[1:10:55] naked has doubt oh you say yes but one
[1:10:58] lie leads to another right it was his
[1:11:01] will that woman didn't make him do what
[1:11:04] he did his will he could have told her
[1:11:09] no I'm not going to do it but you see
[1:11:13] his will right and the woman dog gave me
[1:11:18] she gave me to eat and I did eat so he
[1:11:22] he roundabout confess it and the law
[1:11:24] said that the woman what is this a dog
[1:11:26] has done it and the woman said the
[1:11:28] serpent beguiled me and I did eat what
[1:11:30] she was honest he tricked her but she
[1:11:33] listened right and so therefore he
[1:11:37] walked with her intelligence because she
[1:11:39] is and so is the man and he work with
[1:11:42] that intelligence so much so that they
[1:11:44] thought that God didn't mean what he
[1:11:47] said and that's how a lot of Christians
[1:11:50] will end up in hell because their hear
[1:11:52] this message and they say to themselves
[1:11:54] but I've been a Christian all my life
[1:11:56] and I mean I could go back in the
[1:11:59] scriptures and the Jews could have said
[1:12:00] the same
[1:12:01] I've been at you all my life ever since
[1:12:03] Abraham coming in Moses gonna tell me I
[1:12:06] gotta kill the lamb and put it on a
[1:12:08] blood on the doorpost and little I have
[1:12:09] been on you I've been doing all those
[1:12:10] sacrifices before the Lord and
[1:12:12] everything else a million why do I have
[1:12:15] to put blood on the doorpost of the
[1:12:16] little but if you had did not put blood
[1:12:18] on the doorpost a little guess what your
[1:12:21] firstborn died Jesus came back and said
[1:12:24] the same thing to the Pharisees except
[1:12:26] you believe that I am he you should
[1:12:28] likewise die in your sin mmm that's the
[1:12:32] truth but he he was born this in
[1:12:37] Galatians 4:23 says but he who was a of
[1:12:40] the bonds woman was born after the flesh
[1:12:41] but he said another free woman was born
[1:12:44] by promise right see that's the only way
[1:12:47] we are born again it's not about your
[1:12:49] wheel it's not by the will of you all I
[1:12:51] want to be saved only God can give you
[1:12:54] that desire to be saved the Bible said
[1:12:57] Jesus said no man can come unto me
[1:12:59] except my father draws him right so you
[1:13:04] got to understand that predestination
[1:13:05] and promise goes together a little bit
[1:13:09] brother amen uh you know I love that
[1:13:12] because when you predestinated to a
[1:13:14] promise there is no way you can get
[1:13:17] outside of the promise God promised it
[1:13:20] you said what do you mean brother Brooks
[1:13:21] the Bible said Jacob I love and II so I
[1:13:24] hate huh was there anything that was
[1:13:27] going to change that and God said no
[1:13:30] it'll be the younger son amen that will
[1:13:33] actually be the one that I'm going to
[1:13:35] bless did it happen
[1:13:37] absolutely it meant God promised that
[1:13:39] Jacob was going to get the birthright
[1:13:41] did it happen absolutely it was a
[1:13:44] promise before the boys were even born
[1:13:47] he had already promised the one who was
[1:13:49] going he was going to bless
[1:13:50] hallelujah I don't care how what kind of
[1:13:53] family you came out of I hope y'all know
[1:13:56] what kind I came out of you but your
[1:13:57] mouth would be you know a man but
[1:14:00] nevertheless amen we know that in all
[1:14:03] that love and Mauri
[1:14:05] that I was born under God saw a seed
[1:14:08] hallelujah and that sea was promised a
[1:14:11] man to come to life in this day that you
[1:14:14] with me
[1:14:16] that's you and I in you I you now must
[1:14:19] understand
[1:14:21] predestinated and promise is by the will
[1:14:23] of God oh my god even with my mom and
[1:14:28] dad had me and they birthed me that was
[1:14:30] the will of God
[1:14:31] hallelujah see coming all the way up
[1:14:34] here amen in doing what God when we knew
[1:14:36] is the will of God
[1:14:37] there's no way in my thoughts I could've
[1:14:40] ever thought about Iowa hallelujah
[1:14:43] uh-huh I always got Iowa and Idaho mixed
[1:14:46] up I thought this is the land of
[1:14:47] potatoes huh but God knew what he was
[1:14:51] doing I can't make nothing happen but he
[1:14:55] can but now I realized that my will has
[1:15:00] hindered a lot of things I'm blaming
[1:15:03] nobody but me hmm hallelujah Philippians
[1:15:09] 1:21 of mine give me a few more minutes
[1:15:11] according to my earnest expectation in
[1:15:13] my hope that in nothing I shall be
[1:15:15] ashamed but that with all boldness as
[1:15:19] always so now also Christ shall be
[1:15:22] magnified in my body whether it is -
[1:15:25] whether it be by life or death oh my god
[1:15:30] for to me to live is Christ and to die
[1:15:33] is gain
[1:15:34] oh that's Paul's attitude you know Paul
[1:15:38] how many times they thought he was dead
[1:15:41] three times Paul got right back up and
[1:15:43] kept working in the work field uh-huh Oh
[1:15:48] stoned to death commotion oh my god you
[1:15:54] talking about a real warrior amen and he
[1:15:57] didn't care he was determined to do the
[1:16:00] will of God hallelujah
[1:16:03] and then when Paul could have got out of
[1:16:06] his situation Amen when they were gonna
[1:16:09] take in the wrong Paul says uh-uh
[1:16:11] the Holy Spirit has shown me I gotta go
[1:16:13] preach to this man and you're not going
[1:16:15] to deter me no sure they look Paula like
[1:16:19] a insane man
[1:16:22] and they took Paul to Rome it
[1:16:28] as a oh death where is your sting see he
[1:16:32] was so confident in me that he was in
[1:16:34] the will of God he had no space and no
[1:16:37] place to fear death hallelujah
[1:16:42] first Peter for once and for say for as
[1:16:44] much being as Christ hath suffered for
[1:16:46] us in the flesh arm yourself likewise
[1:16:49] with the same mind for he that have
[1:16:52] suffered in the flesh have ceased from
[1:16:54] sin that he no longer would should live
[1:16:57] the rest of his time in the flesh of the
[1:17:00] lust of men but to the will of God
[1:17:04] hallelujah ye would him say Paul says he
[1:17:07] Peter said listen this is the key your
[1:17:10] wheel vs. God's will and you will to the
[1:17:13] realtor to live amen for God and not for
[1:17:17] yourself
[1:17:18] hallelujah is that right look at the
[1:17:21] rich young ruler the original ruler was
[1:17:23] called to preach call to follow Jesus
[1:17:26] but he was selfish because God said go
[1:17:29] sell all that you have and follow me
[1:17:32] hallelujah and God didn't require you do
[1:17:35] no more than what he asked his other
[1:17:36] disciples to do they left everything
[1:17:38] because people said Lord we've left
[1:17:40] everything we've never family what shall
[1:17:42] we get huh so God is requiring the same
[1:17:46] we gotta leave everything to follow
[1:17:48] Jesus right and look at the risk of
[1:17:52] roulette beginner today he got what he
[1:17:54] wanted he got more than he ever had his
[1:17:57] old ma let me kick my legs up I'm gonna
[1:17:59] retire this year I got bonds and
[1:18:02] everything else filled up and everything
[1:18:04] else I'd be looking pretty good stock
[1:18:06] market is looking good everything is
[1:18:07] looking good
[1:18:08] and God came to you food yo so is
[1:18:15] required of you today see so all of this
[1:18:19] you know you fall in your own wielder
[1:18:21] team all this thing someone said what
[1:18:24] will again what it was a prophet of man
[1:18:26] I think I saw him if you gain the whole
[1:18:27] world and lose your soul what will it
[1:18:30] profit a man well it's probably you and
[1:18:33] me why because you gain it and that's
[1:18:35] what that's what the devil thought if I
[1:18:37] disobey if I go my own way I'm going to
[1:18:39] gain I'm gonna sin I
[1:18:42] going to do this I'm going to do that
[1:18:44] see what your will would take you your
[1:18:46] will will always take you out of the
[1:18:48] will of God it's alright to suffer you
[1:18:59] think because you do the will of God
[1:19:01] you're not gonna stop you who suffer
[1:19:02] especially in your mind cuz your devil
[1:19:05] gonna say well you know you want to do
[1:19:11] I'm not following your will
[1:19:14] your will is the problem today and
[1:19:16] you're not going to will your will on me
[1:19:18] I'm following Christ that he no longer
[1:19:23] should live the rest of his time in the
[1:19:25] flesh to what the love of me loves of
[1:19:29] the flesh let's see i proud of life all
[1:19:32] of that came from the devil but to do
[1:19:36] will of God for the time pass of our
[1:19:38] lives may suffer for the time passed of
[1:19:42] our life may suffice us to have brought
[1:19:45] the will of the Gentiles when we walked
[1:19:47] in lasciviousness lost excess of wine
[1:19:50] reveling and banqueting and abominable
[1:19:52] idolatries wherein they think it's
[1:19:54] strange that you run not with them
[1:19:56] through the same excess of riot speaking
[1:20:00] either of you that's what people saw
[1:20:01] ain't none to him he lived such a boring

[1:20:21] going to church again and I said why
[1:20:23] don't you come go with me
[1:20:24] haven't heard another peep hallelujah
[1:20:28] you see people are watching they always
[1:20:30] watch hallelujah
[1:20:33] beloved think it not strange concerning
[1:20:35] the fiery trial Willis to try you as
[1:20:37] though some strange thing happened unto
[1:20:39] you but rejoice in so much as ye are
[1:20:42] partakers of Christ's suffering but then
[1:20:44] when his glory shall be revealed ye may
[1:20:47] be glad also with exceeding joy if he be
[1:20:50] reproached for the name of Christ happy
[1:20:52] are ye for the spirit of
[1:20:55] Laurie and and if God rested upon you on
[1:20:58] their part he is he was spoken up but on
[1:21:00] your party is glorified but let none of
[1:21:03] us of you suffer as a murderer or as a
[1:21:06] thief or as an evildoer or as a busybody
[1:21:09] in other men's matters yet if any man
[1:21:11] suffer as a Christian that him not be
[1:21:13] ashamed but let him glorify God on this
[1:21:16] behalf for the time has come that the
[1:21:19] judgment of must begin at the house of
[1:21:21] God and if it first began at us what
[1:21:24] shall the end be of them that obey not
[1:21:26] the gospel of God what is the gospel of
[1:21:29] God it is the Word of God and if the
[1:21:33] righteous scarcely be saying where shall
[1:21:35] we share the ungodly and the sinner up
[1:21:38] here is this okay we must die to our
[1:21:42] will folks and he and I Paul says listen
[1:21:45] I die daily you got the Holy Ghost I
[1:21:49] believe but it's dying to your will on a
[1:21:51] daily basis and how do you do that you
[1:21:56] go to the man who can change it you go
[1:21:58] to the one who could kill it and this is
[1:22:01] what I say if God led Jesus the Calvary
[1:22:04] and slaughtered him there God can scroll
[1:22:06] to you every day amen
[1:22:10] you love the Lord one more spirit I
[1:22:11] believe I got a few more things I want
[1:22:13] to say and it won't take too much longer
[1:22:14] but I want to read it and then I try to
[1:22:17] hurry through it Matthew 26 36 446 then
[1:22:20] come of Jesus with him into a place
[1:22:22] called Gethsemane and Senators disciples
[1:22:24] sit ye here while I go and pray yonder
[1:22:27] and he took with him Peter and the two
[1:22:29] sons of Zebedee and began to be
[1:22:31] sorrowful and very heavy then said he
[1:22:34] unto them my soul is exceeding sorrowful
[1:22:36] even unto death tarry here and watch
[1:22:40] with me and he went a little further and
[1:22:42] fell on his face and prayed saying O far
[1:22:45] o my father if it be possible let this
[1:22:47] cup pass from me nevertheless not as I
[1:22:50] will but as doubt will he see god never
[1:22:54] took his will from him he could have
[1:22:56] said no I don't I don't want to go I'm
[1:22:58] not gonna do this but he submitted to
[1:23:02] the will of God because that was his
[1:23:03] purpose we must submit to our his will
[1:23:07] in our day
[1:23:09] and the only way you could none as noise
[1:23:10] well you got to study his word and
[1:23:12] understand what God is doing in this
[1:23:13] hour there's no other way how you gonna
[1:23:16] know what God want you to do if you
[1:23:18] don't read it study his word is that
[1:23:21] okay listen and he went a little further
[1:23:24] and fell on his face and prayed saying O
[1:23:26] my father if it be possible let this cup
[1:23:28] pass from me nevertheless not as I will
[1:23:31] but as thou wilt let me come and he
[1:23:34] cometh unto his disciples and finding
[1:23:37] them asleep and said unto Peter what
[1:23:39] could you not watch with me one hour and
[1:23:41] that's what's happening to the people
[1:23:43] now at a time that we ought to be
[1:23:45] praying with sleeping alright what is
[1:23:48] that you will fight it fight it he went
[1:23:56] away again the second time and prayed
[1:23:57] saying O my father if this cup may not
[1:24:00] pass away from me except I drink it thy
[1:24:04] will be done except I drink it thy will
[1:24:06] be done and he keeps saying this because
[1:24:08] he understands this Cup is built it's
[1:24:11] gonna be rough right and you now must
[1:24:14] understand by God's grace this is not
[1:24:16] the easiest age my favorite Brown said
[1:24:19] this is the worst age ever don't you
[1:24:22] know that God Satan is really the god of
[1:24:25] this evil age it is called an evil age
[1:24:29] because the now Satan is gone getting
[1:24:32] ready to be crowned look at our
[1:24:35] politicians you can't tell me those guys
[1:24:38] are got the Holy Ghost or anything
[1:24:40] nothing close to it I don't care how
[1:24:42] religious they had you know King was
[1:24:45] religious and a lot of the things that
[1:24:48] they're doing they don't even know that
[1:24:49] God is making them do it
[1:24:51] God said even the leaders of the world
[1:24:54] God would put a spirit of surrender when
[1:24:57] they were surrendered to the Pope
[1:24:59] willfully I think
[1:25:05] big broadcasts ongoing now talk about
[1:25:07] you know the Pope being the greatest man
[1:25:09] and I think the Catholic Church got 1.8
[1:25:12] billion a million people I don't know
[1:25:14] what it is being in the weather I don't
[1:25:16] know what it is but my point is is that
[1:25:18] not the scripture the Bible said he
[1:25:21] would cause all whose names are not
[1:25:25] written on the land book of life to
[1:25:27] worship Him there is no greater Church
[1:25:31] in today's world the Catholic Church
[1:25:34] let's be real is the greatest and the
[1:25:36] biggest church in today's world put all
[1:25:42] the Protestants together they still came
[1:25:44] out number the calories hmm these are
[1:25:49] all brother birthday no Kelly yes I used
[1:25:52] to date a girl who was Catholic and when
[1:25:56] I told her mama that Peter was not too
[1:25:58] rough you know she did she went in her
[1:26:01] kitchen with a not got her knife ran me
[1:26:04] chased me out of the house who real
[1:26:08] Catholic mm-hmm yeah did I get out I got
[1:26:26] out I know how to see in the first hand
[1:26:35] and it wasn't even is message yet mm-hmm
[1:26:38] oh lord have mercy see people have no
[1:26:42] idea was locked up right now because of
[1:26:45] the law they don't know it never
[1:26:49] repented that's the mystery of her
[1:26:50] because it's the same old Roman spirits
[1:26:53] raised up in a church they people they
[1:27:00] ignore the history and think that that
[1:27:03] sleeping giant is no longer and she's so
[1:27:07] peaceful in that look at it the Bible
[1:27:09] says
[1:27:09] she's gonna win the kingdoms by flattery
[1:27:11] oh you're my brother why don't you come
[1:27:15] back home
[1:27:19] how long follow he's the most the man
[1:27:27] god help us
[1:27:28] I'm just saying it only because God has
[1:27:30] given me eyes to see and this so-called
[1:27:33] girl I did not marry because I was
[1:27:36] against that way back when before I knew
[1:27:38] this message I saw that I studied those
[1:27:43] things and I didn't know the fullness of
[1:27:46] it like I know now but I see and I see
[1:27:49] even clearer now what that's all about
[1:27:52] she controls everything you see these
[1:27:55] old great countries like they big and
[1:27:57] bad let the Pope go over there and they
[1:27:58] settle down you said how do they settle
[1:28:01] down you gotta understand he has the
[1:28:04] most powerful spirit of darkness in him
[1:28:07] he said it can't be so sweet and nice
[1:28:10] but so was the serpent to Eve he was
[1:28:14] sweet and nice and he calls death y'all
[1:28:18] see I hope they'll be up there looking
[1:28:21] down not here here but anyway let me
[1:28:24] move on he goes on and he says listen he
[1:28:28] watch and pray that ye enter not into
[1:28:30] temptation this indeed is a The Fearless
[1:28:33] indeed willing but the flesh is weak now
[1:28:36] he tells us that the flesh is weak you
[1:28:40] can't think that your flesh is going to
[1:28:42] stand under pressure it will not without
[1:28:45] the Holy Ghost your fret your flesh is
[1:28:47] not going to stand hallelujah is that
[1:28:51] not what God tells the devil tells you
[1:28:53] all God said God let me try let me try
[1:28:56] job let me try them I know that every
[1:28:59] man loved his flesh hmm let me just
[1:29:02] touch it and I'll tell you what I get
[1:29:04] him to turn from you hmm and that is
[1:29:06] nothing but the truth if you're not a to
[1:29:09] seat of God your flesh is going to be
[1:29:11] touched
[1:29:11] is that right oh yeah brother Bela said
[1:29:14] doing that trial in the tribulation a
[1:29:16] period he said there will be humans
[1:29:18] people walking and walking around alive
[1:29:23] with flesh-eating diseases huh
[1:29:28] the Bible said death will flee from them
[1:29:31] what
[1:29:32] putting on the only movies about zombies
[1:29:35] oh it's real we've not seen that but
[1:29:39] it's real and what's happening now is
[1:29:41] those Hollywood movie stars are tapping
[1:29:43] into that RAM and basically showing us
[1:29:47] how wicked is going to be who want to
[1:29:50] live and stay here amen who want to
[1:29:52] write oh my god no take me long you may
[1:30:00] have we said that when brother BAM said
[1:30:01] that hell is blending into this
[1:30:03] dimension it's nothing but the truth
[1:30:05] these little toys and things that these
[1:30:07] kids are playing with one time which
[1:30:09] scared me half to death
[1:30:11] hallelujah I remember that if a baby I
[1:30:13] had not seen brothers Barney and saw
[1:30:15] bugs bunny hopping around it was scaring
[1:30:17] them now they got all kinds of creatures
[1:30:19] out there and these kids they won't know
[1:30:21] why because the seed of God is becoming
[1:30:26] spares scarce who's ruling this world
[1:30:34] this is Satan's Eden and you must
[1:30:37] understand there more serpents now than
[1:30:40] ever before when God said he's going to
[1:30:43] destroy this earth and only a few make a
[1:30:45] rapture that means we back in the days
[1:30:47] of Noah and all eight souls were saved
[1:30:52] all the rest of them were surplus
[1:30:56] hallelujah two million perhaps came out
[1:31:00] of Egypt and to me all of them were
[1:31:02] serpents except to Joshua and Caleb
[1:31:09] I'm telling you problem people hear the
[1:31:12] word they cannot hear but we still have
[1:31:16] to do his will we still gotta preach it
[1:31:18] as if they would receive but we know the
[1:31:21] Word of God like Jeremiah knew it
[1:31:23] they ain't gonna hear you you're gonna
[1:31:26] preach all that time and ain't gonna
[1:31:28] hear because they've gone beyond mercy
[1:31:29] and grace anyway let's move on I read
[1:31:35] where life is living for others and I'm
[1:31:37] just gonna go ahead and move on that's
[1:31:39] got one more quote and I'm gonna read
[1:31:40] that he says listen now the first thing
[1:31:42] I want to say is Jesus never lived
[1:31:44] himself himself he's his life
[1:31:46] spent four others that's perfectly I
[1:31:49] think I had that quote already eternal
[1:31:50] life when you say you go to church and
[1:31:52] you do good things that's fine but when
[1:31:55] you live your life to yourself you
[1:31:57] haven't eternal life eternal life is
[1:32:00] living for others it proves if when you
[1:32:03] come to the Lamb of God he lived and had
[1:32:05] eternal life because he did not live for
[1:32:08] himself he lived for others and you
[1:32:11] receive eternal life by receiving that
[1:32:13] day and you don't live for yourself no
[1:32:16] more you live for others see and that's
[1:32:19] the whole key to eternal life but it's
[1:32:22] not something you can do well this is
[1:32:24] what I ought to do it's not a duty I got
[1:32:29] to do this I gotta do that it's not a
[1:32:32] duty it's so automatically done and
[1:32:35] that's what I'm praying for
[1:32:37] Lord let it be automatically done don't
[1:32:40] let me think about what I gotta do just
[1:32:43] let me do it and you said what do you
[1:32:45] mean a situation arose in my house the
[1:32:48] other night
[1:32:50] and my wife was already in her she said
[1:32:54] I don't know but I saw something that
[1:32:57] clicked and it helped me understand that
[1:33:01] you know sometimes when things are asked
[1:33:03] of you to do it may sound really stupid
[1:33:06] and ridiculous it makes make the person
[1:33:09] there's asking you a question like why
[1:33:12] would you ask me to do it but you never
[1:33:14] know that's just a test well what what
[1:33:20] is it that you wouldn't do for a brother
[1:33:22] and a sister how are we supposed to do
[1:33:25] all those things that we're comfortable
[1:33:27] with that's okay
[1:33:29] no sacrifice comes in there hello
[1:33:33] remember the parable about the man he's
[1:33:35] not knock knock his friend knock knock
[1:33:37] knocking knocking knocking open up I
[1:33:40] need some things from you and the man
[1:33:43] finally got up because it was a friend
[1:33:46] and the Bible said this man didn't feel
[1:33:49] God he just did it because it was friend
[1:33:51] this man was knocking and he needed
[1:33:53] something and he gave it to him
[1:33:54] right he said but what about God how
[1:33:59] many how much God
[1:34:00] willfully give us he doesn't say any
[1:34:03] more if you do this I'll do that
[1:34:05] this unmerited love this is grace I'm
[1:34:08] gonna do for you even if you don't do
[1:34:10] for me and that's the way we are to be
[1:34:16] when God said do this we do it don't
[1:34:19] think about it people just do it you
[1:34:23] find out it'll work out better right oh
[1:34:27] I've done things a man just so
[1:34:30] sporadically I mean just automatically
[1:34:32] if I say it like that and then after I
[1:34:34] do it the devil say you so why did you
[1:34:39] do this and why did you do that when you
[1:34:41] know you're gonna need this what I'm not
[1:34:42] tomorrow is not promised to me
[1:34:45] ten days down the road is not promised
[1:34:48] to me I might die before then let me
[1:34:51] take every day we'd stayed by you know
[1:34:53] day at a time huh oh it's the truth
[1:34:58] because I tell you what you'd be so
[1:35:00] concerned about thirty days down the
[1:35:02] road and you may not live 30 days just
[1:35:06] do and serve God day by day is not God a
[1:35:10] supplier well I got situation now
[1:35:16] financially and I don't say this ain't
[1:35:18] asking and all I'd say just pray for me
[1:35:20] but I'm not worried you know why because
[1:35:23] I know God is gonna fix it he's done it
[1:35:25] every year y'all know what I'm talking
[1:35:27] about now thanks ty my mom you know
[1:35:31] never had their times before I was
[1:35:33] worried Oh God we're and just say how
[1:35:37] you're not worried but I can't sleep
[1:35:38] right but now when you know that you've
[1:35:42] done the will of God you rest all you
[1:35:46] can do is ask God and believe God is
[1:35:48] gonna supply it and he'll do it I've
[1:35:51] seen him do it too many times
[1:35:53] is that right I've seen him do it and
[1:35:56] you know I look at things in us as you
[1:35:58] know what I said even even uh this thing
[1:36:02] that God showed me about his will I came
[1:36:04] to explain it I'm trying to tell you now
[1:36:05] just trust that your militate and ask
[1:36:07] God what is brother Brooks saying if you
[1:36:09] don't fully understand because it's such
[1:36:11] a powerful revelation it should change
[1:36:13] your heart
[1:36:14] it did mine you know and it's like okay
[1:36:22] no I'm not too tired to do this this
[1:36:28] brothers in need the sisters in need why
[1:36:32] did God have them call me you understand
[1:36:35] me it's like okay I'm a part of the body
[1:36:38] and I can't function because I don't
[1:36:42] feel like it you know I mean it's just
[1:36:46] like okay now Lord what is this it just
[1:36:48] it just be of service be of service when
[1:36:51] God calling you move at his request one
[1:36:56] of the things that I'm up close on this
[1:36:57] and I will always remember or the colony
[1:37:01] when one of the sweetie kids got sick
[1:37:05] you know he didn't raise his hand say
[1:37:08] brother Brooks can I do this or you just
[1:37:11] oughta bet I saw a man and just at the
[1:37:15] elder just move you know never thinking
[1:37:19] about himself being sick or getting sick
[1:37:21] I don't know what but whatever that was
[1:37:23] in him that drove him a man to clean up
[1:37:26] it was driving everybody else to get out
[1:37:30] [Laughter]
[1:37:34] it was I'll never forget it I saw God in
[1:37:40] action that's all I'm saying
[1:37:41] simple as it was I saw God and I think
[1:37:47] that's the way God wants us to respond
[1:37:49] when we are finding our brothers and our
[1:37:52] sisters in need
[1:37:52] don't question don't ask just it just do
[1:37:56] that's the Holy Spirit lead you to do it
[1:37:58] just do you love the Lord I I don't know
[1:38:01] where I got it over I just pray that God
[1:38:04] gave me this and I think to me is one of
[1:38:06] the greatest messages I've ever came
[1:38:08] across yet is so simple but it's God's
[1:38:13] will his will is the reason why we say
[1:38:19] today because he connected his will with
[1:38:22] God's me if that makes sense
[1:38:24] those gospel you look at brother Branham
[1:38:26] all of the licks he had
[1:38:28] get through this ministry he tells us
[1:38:30] about it on the snow white dove he said
[1:38:32] yes the dove is wounded but the message
[1:38:36] got home Oh every time I hear that it
[1:38:38] makes me want to cry because he had to
[1:38:40] go through so much and you think that
[1:38:43] this man didn't have his own will he
[1:38:46] proved it to us many times but one thing
[1:38:50] I know about him he was he was so
[1:38:52] willing to to make things right when he
[1:38:54] made things wrong and just to say how he
[1:39:02] allowed us to see that God's will come
[1:39:05] first in spite of friends because you
[1:39:09] know how his friend preaches they
[1:39:12] convinced him to go preach in India or
[1:39:14] Africa when he should have been India
[1:39:16] forgot which way it went and he caught
[1:39:18] of me but almost died the age of the
[1:39:21] Lord told him Billy Paul said the angel
[1:39:24] the Lord told you daddy you better do
[1:39:26] what they the Lord say do he did just
[1:39:28] the opposite and he almost died he paid
[1:39:31] for it even though God blessed see God
[1:39:35] may still bless you but his purpose is
[1:39:38] to teach us how to obey his regardless
[1:39:44] to the circumstances or anything that
[1:39:46] may come upon us what's going to happen
[1:39:48] is if the law tarrying we're right under
[1:39:50] the squeeze and and they says you deny
[1:39:52] this message oh I'm gonna shoot you I'm
[1:39:55] gonna blow your brains out what you
[1:39:57] gonna do throw my brains out I can't die
[1:40:02] anyhow I know who I am
[1:40:04] I know who I am you must know who you
[1:40:07] are that's the only because if you know
[1:40:10] who you are then you can press toward
[1:40:12] that mark you can push forward amen and
[1:40:15] ask God cuz see when you came to it you
[1:40:17] gotta ask him he's the only one to do it
[1:40:20] no man can add a cubit to his stature
[1:40:21] lastania but you know God can do it and
[1:40:26] I am depending on the Lord and I can't
[1:40:29] eat I just I just know that something
