he's mine jesus today is mine i told satan together beyond call jesus today oh jesus is mine amen amen amen i trust everybody has that same testimony amen god is still amen rich in mercy and i'm glad to know that he is has more mercy for me i know that the musicians and others secular musicians had to take a various trips you've eight voyaging so i'm going to a wedding this is some person is going to preach results and others i don't know but we're glad to have everybody here by the grace of god if i've never been sure of anything there is one thing i'm sure of yeah and that this message is 100 percent right i am grateful to the lord jesus christ for giving us grace and mercy psychiatrism seeing what time we're living in my joy is increasing every day to know that it's almost over but i'm not going to have you standing too much longer measuring puffs i ask that you turn with us to revelations the fifth chapter we're going to read the thirteenth verse revelations the third chapter and we're going to read the fifth chapter apocalypse and then we're going to back it up to the at the fifth chapter the tenth verse then we'll go to revelations eight and one in our last scripture matthew 24 24. trust that god will allow us to speak for him this morning revelations uh 5 and 13. and every creature which is in heaven and on earth and under the earth and such as are in the sea and all that are in them heard i saying blessing and honor and glory and power be unto him that sitteth upon the throne and unto the lamb forever and ever and has made us unto our god king and priest and we shall reign on earth it is we're now asked to turn with us to revelations eight one and when he had opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven about the space of a half hour continue on two more scriptures revelations 22 16. i jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in the churches i am the root and offspring of david in the bright and morning star one more scripture and then you can be seated matthew 24 24 matrix for there shall rise false christ and false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders in so much that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect hallelujah let us pray father god we come before you thank you for your amazing grace we thank you for being so good to us father we ask that you give us the grace this morning completely out of your way we are at a time where we must come to see that we basically are getting ready to engage into a more intense but i thank god because the lord has equipped us to do so the we know by god's grace that god has given us uh his greatest weapon tree jude sonama the number one weapon tree is his word and of course the second is prayer because we realize that prayer changes things amen i believe that this is the season that the bride of jesus christ shall try out we have watched seasons come and go this season but i believe this is the season measure quakers say that god has allotted to the bride of jesus christ could you accord to make sure she's ready when we talk about trial we must realize uh it is to celebrate a victory celebrate or someone great in the roman empire and they would have a great celebration of triumph and so basically that's where that word triumph come from and you know i know you say that one day we'll see that same type of marching in conjunction because brother branham tells us that when jesus conquered death hell in the grave that the old testament saints lisander nonsense that in the preview of the bride la vision she was marching at the tune on with christian soldiers [Music] she had triumphed and she was marching upward but in this march they don't sit man there were a few that were getting out of step yeah and the prophet of god screams in line stay in line and at that time he woke up from the vision now we're living in a time where satan job is to distract you hallelujah and so therefore we must come to know our purpose to the greatest of all animals just just completely undetermined know their purpose is objective trees know their purpose lizard is connects their objective right and once a tree is quicker it lost an application and brought to life it killed on you this stays within its purpose i want to say to everybody here this morning hallelujah to become a true christian it is amazing whether we realize it or not but those of us may see who are true seed of god it's you were born into this world victorious victoria hallelujah and how'd that happen is that christ paid be the debt because we were all born sinners that's considered to sneak out christ paid the debts he gave us the liberty to find that purpose [Music] they would be offended hallelujah and what they failed to see monk devoir is that there is no way you could come behind yourself hallelujah because throughout all of the years i've lived before becoming a christian avon i did not even know who myself was hallelujah and that is the way it is it's it comes to life without jesus christ son jesus you will never come to know who you are hallelujah you love the lord i'm taking the scripture is it true what jesus says i am the root just an offspring it gives us understanding who we really are the kingdom some exactly because remember in the parables about the seed there was one seed that had no roots and but because jesus is the tree of life and he declares that he is the root of the beginning and he's also the offspring of it is that right we know the word of god that age had to die in order to bring forth of its kind in the process of this tree maturing to a place we call it the pentecostal place and they thought they were the seed and they were not the seeds a messenger that came to define given us who we are and why we are different from all the rest hallelujah and we could never ever say that we are the same to some remember hallelujah we came by the same life but we have come to a place where c because when we were planted we were planted by the good sower is that right the bible says there was a good sower from [Applause] which means one just defeat a messenger that would come from god that would separate the wheat from the test this message is the very thing separates us from the wheat and because it is [Music] so when we do fail hallelujah he triumphs y'all understand me because the bible says that not only does we triumph in him he comforts he knows what you're going through jesus hallelujah you love the lord amen second corinthians the second chapter in the 14th verse not really no you just think this is a hard time because then i want to say so i have to say it you you you ask a woman when she's going through having a baby when the when the when the pains first start every woman is different some people feel more pain than others but you know i was with my wife when she was in labor with my family and there was no way i could comprehend her pain hallelujah but one thing i i could tell my intro is that when the when the labor pain got harder yes i can remember souvenirs when she was shaking her head like this is a theater and it was basically she was saying i can't take it no more y'all understand me now i'm not trying to scare my sisters god was you were going to die see when the seventh seal was opened let's that was our victory seal that was our completion that was our victory seal that was powerful completion hallelujah and and and brother branham said he saw it he love you but he couldn't interpret it up with hallelujah but one thing i know about god the prophet said that god will interpret the scripture himself and you and i must understand we are the interpretations of brother how can that be because the prophecy hallelujah when god begins to reveal to you those questions christ was on the scene disciples the son of man i'm good hallelujah what are you saying occasionally only the true bride of christ i understand who malachi 4 is hallelujah by way of who you are is that right you must come to know by revelation you are the bride of jesus christ hallelujah the 14th verse look at those embassy now thanks be to god which always causes us to triumph in christ and maketh manifest the savior of his knowledge by us in every place for we are unto god a sweet savior of christ in them that are saved and in them that perish as trophies of christ's victory and through a spreads and make evidence the fragrance of the knowledge of god everywhere hallelujah because that bread would get old but in the holy of holies that bread super never grew old jesus it was always fresh why because it would represent it the eternal life of god it represented the eternal body of god oh my god help us here so what are you saying god leads us into is that right even when you feel like you don't know which way to go that's the footsteps of a righteous man by god is that right amen you take for example when gideon was really perplexed and we ministered on this a little bit the other day but gideon was really uh upset he could not understand why he was suffering so much understand the very altar of god because they couldn't do it hallelujah because they had nothing to sacrifice hallelujah it got so bad the enemy was taking everything away from them everything but they're like the very life uh that they possessed hallelujah and gideon's saying where be this god i hallelujah is that right and when he spoke those words you see gideon at that time did not know his purpose but his purpose was not only to conquer his enemies but to prove that god was living with him this is the bride's portion we did not come to be a denomination we did not come to be an organization we did not even come to be a group hallelujah but we are a one-man army jesus christ is still the same christians today and we just like the methodists just come limit to these just like all of the other ages become listed they miss the move of god because of their doctrines and all of these isms hallelujah but let me say it like this this one the message was brought to us i'ma say that again the message was brought to us not to fight with our brothers you can't change what is there more tear is pray for those that despitefully use us quiet now we understand amen you see because brother branham said it like this you see that power without character la poisson character satanic is satanic hallelujah and we've had that for a long time can produce that kind of a thing is that right i know a brother whose mother was a hindu and even in her ministry people were healed so you see it ain't about healing only it's not about casting out devils it's not about speaking in tongues because the tales can do all of that it is the same thing that falls on the table and also it falls on the way hallelujah but the difference between the tear and the weak is where the terror come from and where the weak come from you understand what i'm saying you and i must understand that spirit of causing people pain because it gives you pleasure that is not of god um coming from the papa's vision department paragraph 151 brother benjamin said when the first church age started it was ephesus and paul paul the angel of that church launcher city one of the stars there were seven stars which means seven angels even seven messengers uh and now we know what paul said paul said except a man preached the gospel the difference between christ and the antichrist christopher because the antichrist will always get away but from the original word hallelujah and so it wasn't like paul was cursing them as a pacquiao and of course you know jesus uh was the lion of the tribe of judah you know i loved that every time i said the lion of the tribe of judah something just kind of leaps on the inside of my heart which is christ hallelujah now i'm gonna go go to matthew 13 just a moment do everybody get what i'm trying to say let me say it as directly as i possibly can when you are wheat uh uh uh you were predestinated to be that is it and some of us can see things that others can't let me say this like somebody told me the other day they just wanted to come get them say the turtle a turtle can stretch his neck but there's another animal that can stretch their neck too and that's the giraffe you see the giraffe and you know the one thing about a giraffe he has to keep his head up because when he lets his uh uh head go down it cuts off his circulation blood circulation and if he keeps it down there long enough he'll faint [Music] hallelujah it can remind me of some of us god has somebody else to eat the bottom we have been ordained to eat the top in some aldonee and as long as we keep our hands up not only will we be able to feed ourselves hallelujah faith is a revelation the fortunes you know and and you know i'm going to say this because and i don't say this to be a prideful person but when i was in high school you know i took the air force uh rotc program philly program the air force and in that program i became the lieutenant colonel that's when i had a little something and then when i graduated from high school i graduated the highest honor it may not seem like that now because i've gone through some hard times and i made history in columbia south carolina they had me on the television set this was a time uh before getting my results back they were asking us a question you know if you make it to the air force academy academy um would you really be happy about it and i said no it's not if i make it i will be accepted and my friends thought i was really stupid mr out of that group there's a group that was accepted it was a faith it was a revelation i didn't know how i just knew it was going to happen and it did it and i'm not going to go through the rest of the story is really rested but the point is i did get there that's how faith is is when you confess it just confess you can have hallelujah and that's what satan do uh that's what god does it's good jeremy gives you some kind of vision in your mind where you know it's real it's going to happen you love the lord let me move temptations knowing that of your faith you say god i want to be just like you listen take your hands off get out of his way let god perfect you listen go through what you've got to go through all thank give thanks he is virtue does not come by la la virtue easy facile it's not something given to you easily you've got to fight for it but go listen to it and i'm going to tell you you've got to be really careful with your attitude toward the world because you have no idea when you project the wrong attitude at a time when god says that's enough you've got to be really careful hallelujah because god is not in the begging business another power will put forth he for uh uh another power will put he forth unto them saying the kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which soweth good seed in his field which was a type of the nature of god and then the other seed i'm sorry then the other seed hallelujah had the nature of the devil hallelujah now you must understand both of these seeds were in the same field they went to the same church they heard the [Music] you understand me uh you say well brother books what's the difference they were all anointed by the same anointing hallelujah is that right you say well brother books what is going on we've had a lot of people following this message the back slide is one thing to denounce it is another thing you know another one at the end time paragraph 233 he said no you go back and then and try to live again they leave it and they go back and try to live again you left it never does it is impossible for those which were enlightened and didn't move on the word as it came to pass he said they are dead they're gone and the thorns and the thistles which is nigh unto rejection who's in is to be burned don't laugh you ought to thank god hallelujah because all of these things must happen hallelujah the separation must happen hallelujah what causes you to be magnetized to the word um hallelujah you see what i'm trying to get you to see is that excuses you need to be about your father's business you need to define your purpose and your purpose is to prove i say it again that jesus christ is the same yesterday the day and forever hallelujah the very mind of christ must be formed in you for me and that is something that you can't do hallelujah he's got to do it but he can only do that when he personally fell to the wheat oblay what season you're in he said that's the point we're trying to get over to you point you know we look at this thing and uh we must understand that this thing is uh oh we sing that song everything is moving by the power of god and i can't help but to think about brother branham in that region of the laws a burning and we look at this thing it says well god sent a prophet it's foreign not because of your goodness not because you was a nice person not because you did not bear the image of the children of the wrath because you had representation [Music] i will remain god's business see we go to uh uh a pray on this law i was just teaching on that the other day we go to pray and we've got all of these voices running through our minds a lot of times we pray and because we've got memories it comes along i mean well he did me this way oh yeah she did me that in my face well with that kind of thought don't even think you're getting anywhere with god [Music] is he came before god he lived in the event he was a sinner who had never been forgiven before in his life that's not the bride hallelujah one thing about the bride of jesus christ you understand me you say well what do you mean because when jesus on the cross father forgive them but they know not what they do hallelujah that was placed into his dna you hear what i'm saying and if you're born of the same seeds hallelujah but he says lord oh not these things to their church that was not amazing that was christ in the man that's the way the bride operates it comes like you're liposuction hallelujah you gotta shut the devil down whenever he comes to your mind shut him down in your mind shut him down don't vote if you can't use the word bring a song to victory hallelujah power power wonder working power in the blood hallelujah give the devil a headache hallelujah migraine headache hallelujah you need to shout out loud and um let god let the devil know you are on the battlefield you know it's like when jesus said law in the word of god it says lead no the word of god is saying lord whenever i'm placed in a position where there's temptation give me strength to overcome amen now jesus was led into the wilderness jesus said the devil god didn't lead him into temptation those can know when he falls by his own lust hallelujah he's tempted by his own loss hallelujah if you don't have nothing inside to lust yes second corinthians 10. and we hear these scriptures all the time give me five more minutes we started a little late uh we were having problems there with the system there it's okay you just got one service so y'all can service uh most movies last longer than i preach young i'm just saying you know he said boy he's up there a long time man it's true we we watch a movie and and a commercial come on we won't even go to the restroom for the weapon of our warfare are not carnal but mighty through god to the pulling down of the strong holes casting down imaginations every high thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of god to the pulling down of the strongholds no and having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience when your disor your obedience is fulfilled you love the lord there's a quote i'm trying to find and it's a real good one just give me a minute do you want me let me let me read it here uh just wanted to leave you see brother bram says hey uh can you read my writing amen no man can come to me except my father draws him. and all the father has given me then brother adam says in the root you're in the root you were in the root those are the ones that his father has given him and the root will come to me [Music] see you get it oh how we should love him praise him to see the fruit of the spirit divinely in the last days and the bright tree elaborate brightening in the time he says what listen he says what is the fruit did you say he said the word la pagoda for fruit for the season that's what denomination far more advanced than i am brother brother been gone ever since 1965. but before he left up amen that still was yet to be placed and then he came with the capstone message and this message is different from pentecost yes we agree [Music] [Music] was composed of mostly the pentecostal everybody move with the pill of fire they were left behind you said well what do you mean brother brooks that's why their message can never perfect us hallelujah they had a message they could literally go down into the spirit realm they had those who had uh and healing of them even went into this uh different kinds of discernments so it's not like malachi 4. you know they would say somebody's in the audience is sick somebody in the audience got a headache they always generalized it but god pinpointed hallelujah and that was god he was the only one that could do it hallelujah it wasn't william branham it was god in the man hallelujah now all of us will agree on that that god used him hallelujah to show himself and you know they these kind i've got i i know they have exclusive success now i know y'all gonna run and get some peaches but the point is that peach was just exactly what i expected it to be said exactly it didn't taste like salad it didn't taste like coconut orange um [Music] because that seed had to be perfect words understand me but why why paul's church could not take a rapture because it was not the sea it was not the rapture times [Applause] hallelujah lord of god hallelujah oh lord in this last quote coming from the seed of discrepancies uh paragraph 21 he says now he said the seed of god that's the most the word that they're living in you understand me even when it came to luther it was still the word of god wesleyans were the word of god pentecostals were the word of god and they all manifested exactly what the words say they would manipulate exactly hallelujah but this bride is supposed to be an invincible bride mountains this does not come by religion it doesn't come by joining the church by being a member of somebody else's family hallelujah but it does come back by being a part of christ the problem that god says there's only going to be a few to make it hallelujah now if the christian you may not see the of the kingdom has become the seed of god that's the most then there must be the word of god the word of god manifested in the age that they're living in kill you for the promised seed of that age was promised you are promised you were the promised seed that god's promise would come you're judging me i understand what i'm saying so because i've got to make sure i've got the character that he's looking for hallelujah he's coming you know i've got him yeah i'm ready whatever i gotta go through let me go through it let's see what i gotta suffer but when he comes i want to be a i want him to say well done well done hallelujah you understand me we gotta focus satan has us so distracted hallelujah don't you know your life is not even promised right now just right now are you ready because listen there's nothing you can say or do you want this this death strikes you oh you're not ready are you ready see that's the part satan hides from us there in south africa you understand me and these men were no two not so much older than i am of age believe us in the message as we say all we can do is trust that the character of christ on earth during the time of space they were here okay i'm closing i'm saying the word of god manifested in the age that they're living in for the promised seed of that age god gave his word at the beginning came that's good on the scene and he was the seed of god yes the jew the word of god for that age hallelujah do you understand what's happening now let's go for components it's not only that if they don't hear what brother branham says but the transition is if they don't hear what you say because now you're the voice of god you're the ones that's crying out to the nations if there is such thing as preaching to the souls that are imprisoned now you're the one you understand me so in closing if we're not sighing and crying for the abominations done in the city i'm just going you know we don't even sign cry after our kinfolk like we ought to see you get it brother says those are the only kind that's going to or you [Music] understand your position about position you understand stan if i don't like esther if i don't cry behind this decision many souls because we failed to tell them amen god is rich in mercy i trust that what was said has penetrated your hearts in some way on mania like i made the statement earlier in the service we come to be changed people we don't heard so many good things of uh in types and shadows and we've had i mean times that was just memorable i still remember uh our new year's service i felt like i was 16. i had a good time i think about how much how much was i changed the bible said would change from glory to glory consumption but we come because we want god to do something in the heart [Music]
