[23:47] do my best to pronounce the where's the
[23:49] way you pronounce them but forgive me if

[24:10] understand me I know that when preachers
[24:15] are preaching often we say that the
[24:16] Spirit has taken over and we speak very
[24:18] fast and
[24:20] the people don't especially those who
[24:21] don't speak their language very well
[24:23] that people don't get anything I try to
[24:26] go at a pace that I want you to really
[24:31] understand what I'm trying to say so

[24:37] little closer to me and hopefully you'll

[24:49] let's turn our Bibles to Acts chapter 10
[24:52] and let's read a little bit about a
[24:56] story of Cornelius Acts chapter 10 if
[25:05] you will let's bow down our hearts and
[25:07] our heads and speak to the author of the
[25:09] word before we read a word precious

[25:23] another shed blood to break the bread of
[25:26] life Lord your words see it there our
[25:31] fathers ate manna in the wilderness and
[25:33] they are all dead but a bread that you
[25:38] will give us when we eat it

[26:01] Jerusalem to Emmaus Lord come and
[26:04] explain your work to us come and break
[26:06] this bread that we'll eat and hang on no
[26:09] more precious father take me out of the
[26:13] way and let your spirit II control this
[26:15] morning like glory divine descent upon
[26:18] this altar and speak to your people Lord
[26:24] keep them
[26:26] hats now to receive your weight that the
[26:30] water not coming from you what are the
[26:32] way in the world we terminate and
[26:35] flourish this we ask in no other name by
[26:39] the matchless name of our Lord and
[26:41] Savior Jesus Christ amen let me read
[26:45] from verse 1 to 6 then I'll jump to 34
[26:54] so there was a certain man in Caesarea
[26:58] Cornelius a Centurion of the band called
[27:01] the Italian band a devout man and one
[27:06] that feared God with all his house which
[27:09] gave much arms to the people and pray to
[27:11] God always he saw in a vision evidently
[27:16] about the ninth hour of the day an angel
[27:19] of God coming in to him and saying unto
[27:22] him Cornelius
[27:23] when he looked on him he was afraid and
[27:26] said what is it Lord and he said unto
[27:29] Him thy prayers and thy arms
[27:32] I come up for a memoria before God and
[27:35] now send men to Joppa and call for one
[27:39] Simon whose surname is Peter he loaded
[27:43] in with one Simon a Tanner whose house
[27:47] is by the sea side he shall tell thee
[27:50] what thou oughtest to do verse 34 then
[27:55] Peter opened his mouth and said of a
[27:59] truth I perceive that God is no
[28:01] respecter of persons but in every nation
[28:04] he that feareth him and worketh rushes
[28:07] righteousness is accepted with him the
[28:10] word which God sent unto the children of
[28:13] Israel preaching peace by Jesus Christ
[28:15] he is Lord of all the word I saw I see
[28:22] you know which was published throughout
[28:24] all Judea and begun from Galilee after
[28:26] the baptism of John who John preached
[28:29] how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with
[28:32] the Holy Ghost and with power who went
[28:35] about doing good and healing all that
[28:37] were oppressed of the devil
[28:39] for God was with him and we are
[28:41] witnesses of all the things which he did
[28:44] both in the land of the Jews and in
[28:47] Jerusalem whom this is new and hung on a
[28:51] tree him door raise up the teddy and
[28:54] shoot him openly not to the people but
[28:58] on but on two witnesses chosen before of
[29:01] God even to us who did eat and drink
[29:04] with him after he rose from the dead
[29:07] and he commanded us to preach unto the
[29:09] people and to testify that it is he
[29:13] which was ordained of God to be the
[29:15] judge of the quick and the dead to him
[29:18] give all the prophets witness that
[29:20] through his name whosoever believeth in
[29:23] him shall receive remission of sins
[29:26] now what was 44 Wow pitaya speak this
[29:30] words the Holy Ghost fell on all them
[29:33] which had the weight amen
[29:37] shall we pray Lord may you bless the
[29:40] reading of that word this we acts in
[29:43] Jesus name Amen let's be seated brethren
[29:50] beloved in Christ today I want to speak
[30:00] to you about a gem of life a bra bra bra
[30:04] Abraham called the gem of life and I
[30:09] want to tackle it from the viewpoint of
[30:12] the new base amen
[30:18] beloved you remember that when Jesus
[30:22] Christ came the first doctrine that
[30:25] Jesus started preaching was about the
[30:29] new base that was Jesus Christ
[30:31] this doctrine a man called Nicodemus
[30:38] went to see Jesus by night he was a
[30:42] Pharisee a scribe and notable religious
[30:46] leader of his day and as it
[30:52] he began to talk to Jesus he says told
[30:56] him something that marvelled him in John
[30:59] 3 Jesus told him that except a man is
[31:03] born again that man cannot see the
[31:06] kingdom of God
[31:09] Nicodemus was taken aback how can an old
[31:14] man like me be born again am I going to
[31:17] entice second time into the womb of my
[31:19] mom to be born again Jesus said oh let
[31:26] me use my African expression say oh you
[31:31] mean you are a ruler of Israel and I'm
[31:36] telling you at least and you don't
[31:38] understand me what did I begin to speak
[31:40] to you about heavenly things said verily
[31:43] verily I say unto you the Prophet told
[31:48] us at the very very least absolutely
[31:52] absolutely I say unto you except a man
[31:57] be born again he cannot see the kingdom
[32:02] of God beloved and I want to say this I
[32:06] don't know how many of us have paid
[32:08] attention to Rev run's message number
[32:11] brands message is not only a mess is not
[32:14] just a conglomeration of mysteries Rob
[32:20] ROM came with a single purpose Amen that
[32:26] Christ who live in a believer again as
[32:32] it was a pentacles amen brother and
[32:36] there is a process but with God s that
[32:43] hallelujah so brethren the bronze team
[32:47] if you read his message carefully one of
[32:50] the longest messages broblem ever
[32:52] preached was the spoken word is the
[32:54] original seat now if you study this
[32:57] message carefully
[32:58] LeBron was trying to tell the people
[33:00] about how that gem of life must come
[33:04] into their hearts
[33:07] amen and now how Jim must be water to
[33:10] grow to reproduce Christ amen so
[33:16] brethren why is it that when Jesus
[33:18] Christ came he started talking about
[33:20] this doctrine about new Beth because you
[33:23] are the Old Testament it was on the
[33:25] doctrine
[33:25] amen beloved it is because the master
[33:31] physician had come umbrella and if you
[33:34] are 65 you are sick and you visit a
[33:36] hospital what the doctor must do is to
[33:39] diagnose what that ailment is if that
[33:43] doctor does not diagnose that other
[33:44] ailment is and he gives or prescribes
[33:47] any medication for you you are better
[33:49] off not taking our medication a good
[33:53] physician will always tell you how the
[33:55] problem is hey I can see your prep the
[33:58] blood pressure is up this way I can see
[34:00] your sugar level he stays I can see a
[34:02] tumor form in some way something he has
[34:04] to be able to diagnose why you are not
[34:08] feeling well Jesus Christ came the whole
[34:13] human race was sick and true from the
[34:19] Garden of Eden people didn't understand
[34:21] exactly what the problem was
[34:23] why is it that every generation gets
[34:26] further away from God this has been how
[34:29] a lot I mean when you when you met your
[34:32] parent when you were growing up our
[34:34] parents who tell us oh in our days this
[34:36] is my father would not accept this in
[34:38] his house you all know that yeah but
[34:42] anything at all goes you can weigh
[34:46] anything you can dress anyhow and
[34:48] anything at all is accepted Alleluia
[34:51] so every generation is getting further
[34:55] and further away from God so Jesus came
[34:59] out with the diagnosis diagnose the
[35:03] problem and the diagnosis was our death
[35:06] the way we came into this world is the
[35:10] cause of our problem so jesus said the
[35:14] only way the only prescription the only
[35:18] medication
[35:19] I can prescribe for the human race that
[35:21] would totally kill us of our ailment is
[35:25] to be born again hallelujah
[35:30] unfortunately this terminology born
[35:33] again has been misunderstood and has
[35:36] been bastardized by Christendom
[35:38] everybody has his own interpretation to
[35:41] it when you go to church and minister
[35:44] lays hands on you start speaking
[35:46] alababama in unknown tongue then you are
[35:49] born again among the pentacle star amen
[35:51] I'm on message believers when you read
[35:54] Marella brands message and you believe
[35:57] it you are born again so a lot of
[36:01] interpretation there is no time for me
[36:03] to get into that interpretation I want
[36:06] to hit on the key things amen
[36:08] so brethren there was something wrong
[36:11] with the way we came into this world if
[36:15] you if you go back to Genesis from the
[36:19] beginning everything that God created
[36:23] everything that God made a man was by
[36:26] the spooking way so everything that is
[36:31] original is by the spoken word amen so
[36:40] man or men
[36:45] we are today we all know we didn't come
[36:48] by the spoken word rob rom said we came
[36:52] by hybridization hallelujah
[36:57] we are hybrid and that is why us in
[37:01] every generation we are getting weaker
[37:04] and weaker and weaker hallelujah take a
[37:10] hybrid corn grow it maybe the first year
[37:14] you get what you are supposed to get
[37:16] from your harvest but you cannot replant
[37:19] that watch what you go from your field
[37:22] dead following here
[37:23] I mean farmers here know what I'm
[37:25] talking about an Iowa is full of
[37:26] confirming sue you can replant it Amen
[37:31] when a donkey and a horse is cross it's
[37:35] called the offspring is called a mule
[37:37] and that meal is important it can't
[37:40] reproduce itself because it's a hybrid
[37:45] so the reason why the human race cannot
[37:49] produce reproduce God on earth we cannot
[37:51] because the humans humans were created
[37:54] in the image of God from the beginning
[37:56] so if we were created in the image of
[37:58] God then we are supposed to reproduce
[38:00] God but the hybrid cannot reproduce
[38:06] itself that is why we continuously
[38:11] hybridized hybridized we have become
[38:14] weaker and weaker and far and far away
[38:17] from God hallelujah
[38:21] so Jesus Christ came with this
[38:23] prescription he said there is a simple
[38:25] cure for your problem new base in a new
[38:31] birth no no other prescription can work
[38:36] pray for long hours is good but it will
[38:39] help you amen unless you are born again
[38:44] so absolutely absolutely except a man be
[38:48] born again he cannot see the kingdom of
[38:51] God you want to see the kingdom of God
[38:54] what you require the prescription my
[38:57] sister is to be born again
[39:01] hallelujah so how do we get I mean how
[39:06] do we get reborn how do we get this new
[39:11] base ready I'm saying this morning that
[39:15] the mysteries that are contained in this
[39:18] message are good I had somebody the last
[39:22] time I went I wasn't somebody said we
[39:23] should go deeper one of the preachers
[39:26] who preach was talking about how we must
[39:29] that ministers are preaching too many
[39:32] shallow things on us go deeper the
[39:34] deeper things are good I have nothing
[39:35] against them but if Brahm said if you
[39:38] don't get your ABC right I can't teach
[39:41] you algebra you first have to get you a
[39:46] 1-2-3 well known then when I tell you
[39:49] that 2x minus 3b plus 6x is equal to
[39:54] then you can solve that equation isn't
[39:57] it
[39:57] so how can I be teaching simultaneous
[39:59] equations and teaching you complex
[40:01] numbers and all this mathematical stuff
[40:03] if we don't have your ABC right ready so
[40:09] I'm saying that at the core of the
[40:10] message that we believe is a new bed and
[40:12] a baptism of the Holy Ghost and broblem
[40:15] clearly says that in the message but it
[40:18] doesn't come so because people are so
[40:20] fixated about mysteries that they don't
[40:22] see that well now you can know all the
[40:25] mysteries in the world that's why Paul
[40:28] said that you can preach all the
[40:29] mysteries you don't know all the
[40:30] mysteries if we don't have charity you
[40:33] have nothing that's it very so it is not
[40:42] about the intellectual knowledge of this
[40:45] message because how many teams do you
[40:47] have to play to know everything
[40:53] you paint there is just one prescription
[41:00] new base and if you strive for that and
[41:04] achieve that all other things shall be
[41:07] added okay
[41:08] amen so brother let's look at the
[41:11] natural birth
[41:13] we're all born the Bible says in C we
[41:18] worship in iniquity whether we were born
[41:23] because of the world we were born we
[41:25] came forth with an evil nature that is
[41:28] inherent in us ran away you were born
[41:31] all the bad things that you ever did
[41:34] nobody taught you how to do it it meant
[41:40] if you ever stole nobody taught you how
[41:43] to steal mother sister if you ever
[41:48] fornicated nobody taught you how to do
[41:50] that it is the way you were born is an
[41:54] evil leader that makes you to do that
[41:58] now if you look at the Bible even in the
[42:03] Old Testament right from the beginning
[42:05] Jesus Christ or God was portraying this
[42:10] change of nature to us now if you take
[42:14] the life of someone like Jacob for
[42:16] instance brother Brahm use him as a type
[42:18] if we look at the life of Jacob you
[42:21] realize that Jacob was born as a planter
[42:24] a deceiver and that's the life that he
[42:26] led the Seavey's brother went to Laban
[42:28] the same level when he was coming back
[42:32] to his leg he started praying say Lord
[42:36] I've lived led this life for long
[42:38] let something happen and God came down
[42:42] he recognized the presence of God
[42:45] wrestle with God hallelujah all the
[42:48] angel of the Lord hallelujah the angel
[42:50] touch is heap amen and his life was
[42:55] changed his life was changed to the
[42:59] extent that when he went to Joe to Egypt
[43:01] and Joseph was telling him that tell
[43:04] Pharaoh that you are Shepherds oh don't
[43:09] tell it tell him that you are I think
[43:11] your Shepherds noting that you had
[43:13] cattle or something like that
[43:14] yeah because Egyptians don't like that
[43:17] profession when Pharaoh came he didn't
[43:21] he didn't tell a lie he told favor the
[43:23] truth of who they are even listen to the
[43:24] son that's how change
[43:26] he was so in in the Old Testament there
[43:29] were types let me ask you God once
[43:34] change a king from a king to a beast who
[43:44] did that
[43:45] God how did he learn how to kill grass
[43:49] like like a cutter like cutter God he
[43:54] grew close like a beast who did that God
[44:00] after the 7 years were accomplished King
[44:03] Nebuchadnezzar was changed back to a
[44:05] human being who did that God amen
[44:14] so God has been exemplify has been
[44:17] typing we can see that shadows in the
[44:19] Old Testament but there is no time for
[44:21] me to bring this to you let's get to the
[44:24] point so physically for a child to be
[44:26] born a seed has to be planted in the
[44:30] physical wound of the woman by a man is
[44:35] all right now
[44:37] you realize that if the man is impotent
[44:43] or if there is something wrong with the
[44:47] womb of the woman conception cannot take
[44:50] place
[44:51] nature cannot be born amen
[44:55] so in planting of a seed two great
[45:01] requirements number one the seed must be
[45:04] a good seat Nomar to that ground on
[45:08] which the seed is to be planted must be
[45:10] good ground if any of these two things
[45:14] are no good you can't have a crop the
[45:18] seed cannot dominate is all right good
[45:25] so brethren the man who plans this seed
[45:30] as I said earlier must be a career of a
[45:34] viable seed now things
[45:39] Charlie now the seed that is planted in
[45:45] a believer is the Word of God when he
[45:48] goes looked after it is dead the proble
[45:51] of the sewer Jesus Christ interpreting
[45:53] the Bible said the seed is the word of
[45:56] God and that seed is planted in the
[46:02] human heart but you know we have four
[46:05] kinds of hearts we have the stony had a
[46:08] rocky heart we have the wayside hat we
[46:12] have the tawny heart and have the
[46:14] feather hat hallelujah
[46:16] unless that seed falls on the fourth
[46:19] kind of arts amen so brethren the word
[46:23] that you are hearing from here is a
[46:28] viable seed now if the believer City
[46:33] here doesn't have the fourth kind of art
[46:36] hallelujah doesn't have the feta hat
[46:40] that a seed who fall on that seed will
[46:42] be of no effect it doesn't matter how
[46:46] much the sewer plants the seed will be
[46:49] of no effect
[46:52] amen think I mean these things the
[46:56] natural we know table is the spiritual
[46:59] some couples cannot have children
[47:02] it's either way either the man has a
[47:06] problem with his seed or the woman has a
[47:08] problem with the womb and we know by
[47:11] this message that the wound a spiritual
[47:13] wound which we receive the seed of God
[47:15] is the heart hallelujah so brethren for
[47:22] one to have the new bed amen seed must
[47:26] be planted inside you and this seed
[47:30] problem said first comes to the womb of
[47:33] the mind then from the womb of the mind
[47:36] it drops into the heart hallelujah the
[47:40] spirit comes to water it and it breathes
[47:43] for food is that right Amen so beloved
[47:48] in Christ it's very important that
[47:53] we are sure that that seed is viable the
[47:58] seed cannot be a denominational seed I'm
[48:01] talking to each other and you know but
[48:03] it's not seen it's not a viable seed it
[48:05] can't reproduce Christ to reproduce
[48:08] denomination I are you following good so
[48:14] barren you realize that Oh manner of
[48:24] problems now physically the woman's womb
[48:28] has all manner of fibroid is one of the
[48:31] things like that he chokes it doesn't
[48:34] allow the seed to germinate it may be
[48:37] the same way the spiritual heart has all
[48:41] manner of difficult guts SM often an
[48:43] ally who talked about the conditions on
[48:46] the heart lay down but for now I want to
[48:49] emphasize on the career of the seed the
[48:57] career the seed is very important this
[49:02] message is a message where people I mean
[49:07] people have grown to the point where
[49:11] they don't to listen to anybody anymore
[49:14] they think that they come leaplet caves
[49:17] and by playing clips and living right
[49:20] that is it but that cannot give you a
[49:24] new bed that is not how God ordained it
[49:28] now if you watch the scripture that will
[49:31] just read an angel appeared to Philip
[49:37] but God has no ordained angels to preach
[49:41] his word so how did the angel do the
[49:45] angels sent an angel up not to Philip to
[49:49] Cornelius the angels and Cornelius to go
[49:53] fetch the man that is a carrier of the
[49:55] viable seed really so it doesn't matter
[50:01] it doesn't matter how religious you are
[50:04] how good a believer
[50:06] you are I remember when I used to preach
[50:12] to my mom you know when I went you then
[50:13] I lost my mother when I used to preach
[50:15] to her I might now tell me that look
[50:17] I don't jealous anybody I don't kill I
[50:21] don't commit adultery I don't do this I
[50:25] live well so I'm already a child of God
[50:27] I said mom it's not about that you can
[50:33] live all the good life if you don't
[50:36] receive Jesus as your Lord and Savior
[50:40] the correct way you will be you you I
[50:44] mean you'll be doomed fortunately on the
[50:49] 28th of December oh-wee five children of
[50:56] my mother away we went to the village
[50:58] together and my mother called us and
[51:01] told us that she wanted to be baptized
[51:03] and I said well I don't want to baptize
[51:09] you if somebody is forcing it on you I
[51:11] want I want you to be from your heart it
[51:14] is something that you you really want if
[51:17] somebody is forcing you to be baptized
[51:19] that would not work it's a notes from my
[51:22] own heart but then give she gave us a
[51:25] condition she said she wanted her
[51:28] religious regalia I know my mom belongs
[51:30] to some of these African traditional
[51:32] religion so they have the religious
[51:34] regalia say her religious regalia the
[51:36] one the instrument of divination that we
[51:39] use is with a spiritual leader from
[51:42] where she comes from a hometown so we
[51:44] have to go get that team and Bennett I
[51:50] said no problem
[51:52] I fix I fix generate a 28th this this
[51:58] year for the baptism so I told my fellow
[52:01] ministers in around the country now I
[52:04] mean this is going to be a big thing in
[52:05] my hometown because everybody knows my
[52:07] mother so well
[52:08] how deep she is into this African
[52:10] tradition and religion is getting
[52:12] baptized I'm sure the whole village will
[52:13] gala is an opportunity to preach them
[52:15] and we traveled there on that fateful
[52:18] day we got the baptismal pool set in the
[52:21] house the whole house was full with
[52:24] people over 300 people to witness my
[52:28] mom's baptism fortunate unfortunately
[52:32] somehow the devil father who were not
[52:34] getting water I'll arrange for a crack
[52:40] to bring us water to the house and the
[52:45] truck just disappointed us we went to
[52:49] the Riverside ourselves to look for the
[52:51] water the Pampas not working well it was
[52:53] a hassle all the ministers got into the
[52:55] water we said well I'm going to carry
[52:59] her to the river just to baptize it but
[53:01] because of the people present and the
[53:02] fact that some other people may want to
[53:04] baptize wanted to do it in a house in a
[53:07] pool so eventually we got the water we
[53:11] came it was almost 7 p.m. and we
[53:14] baptized it was a glorious ceremony 3
[53:17] weeks after that she passed away
[53:19] she assented Christ at the knick of time
[53:23] and I'm so grateful to the Lord because
[53:29] I had prayed for the past 20 years for
[53:31] my mother at the point I got stopped
[53:33] praying for her I said well let the will
[53:35] of God be done I never knew it was going
[53:38] to happen it just happened so don't give
[53:41] up if you are praying for somebody for a
[53:45] person to believe this message for the
[53:46] person to believe in Jesus Christ just
[53:49] keep praying and trust in the Lord God
[53:51] Himself would do it at a nick of time
[53:53] hallelujah so probably I was telling my
[53:56] mum this that it is not about how good
[53:58] you live ready
[54:01] Christian
[54:02] it's not about how good you live you can
[54:06] leave a very good life and still be lost
[54:12] I've talked of ask people do you think
[54:16] that in Jericho there was no vegging
[54:19] child in Jericho ago chose to save a
[54:22] prostitute the irony God chose to save a
[54:30] prostitute because the present you
[54:33] believe his word looting there were no
[54:37] priests in Samaria but Jesus didn't go
[54:41] to the priests he went to the prostitute
[54:44] woman very well look a whole rehab told
[54:51] the two spies he said we have had what
[54:55] your God did to those kids on this side
[54:58] of Jordan and we know that this must be
[55:01] the God of heaven she saved herself and
[55:06] her family very it's about believing in
[55:12] God hallelujah living in God so brethren
[55:19] also saying the angel appeared to me kun
[55:23] Elios but God has not ordained angels to
[55:27] preach his word an angel cannot plant
[55:31] the seed of life in you the reason is
[55:36] that girl's way of reproduction is that
[55:39] that seed must come from the body which
[55:42] body the body of Christ are you
[55:47] following
[55:48] just like the seed must come the natural
[55:50] seed comes from the body of the man
[55:52] hallelujah the spiritual seed turns from
[55:55] the body of Christ to the womb of the
[56:01] heart then conception takes place and
[56:07] Christ is formed in a person don't don't
[56:14] don't miss this now amen when the angel
[56:17] appeared the angel did not send
[56:21] Cornelius the priests in Jerusalem
[56:24] Cornelius knew nothing about what has
[56:26] happened Jesus calm died and resurrected
[56:29] and salvation and everything is being
[56:32] preached now he knew nothing about it
[56:33] all he knew was that there was a true
[56:35] God among the Jews and he wanted to sell
[56:39] this God and he taught by giving arms
[56:41] and praying
[56:42] somehow God here and God did here God
[56:45] will always reward your good deeds
[56:48] I said girl always record the Bible says
[56:53] that if you receive a prophet in the
[56:56] name of a prophet you will receive a
[56:58] Prophet's reward God would never God
[57:02] never forsake you look there was a woman
[57:06] who was dying even burn Abram went and
[57:08] told our woman she had he was in a last
[57:11] stage of tuberculosis TB TB sickness and
[57:14] Brahma and told that she was going to
[57:17] die and I will male somewhere and some
[57:22] people were talking about parabrahmam
[57:24] Hardaway sort of condemning the things
[57:28] that he preaches and the woman was
[57:30] telling them no that's not it what Bob
[57:32] Rahm is preaching is a truth and just by
[57:37] standing for that word bra bra went back
[57:41] and the woman got healed you say oh then
[57:48] God didn't speak to him the first time
[57:50] God spoke to him because I can see a
[57:52] type in the Bible Isaiah go to Isaiah to
[57:56] go and tell King Hezekiah that set your
[57:58] house in order you are going to die as I
[58:02] went to the temple Tim his face look
[58:04] remember my little faithfulness cos and
[58:08] as I again go back and tell him that
[58:11] I've added about 15 more years to his
[58:14] years hallelujah
[58:16] so brethren if you receive a prophet in
[58:20] the name of a prophet the Bible says you
[58:22] receive a Prophet's reward we are not
[58:24] believing on to fables we are believing
[58:27] some
[58:27] that is real so beloved in Christ the
[58:32] angel sent Cornelius to go fetch
[58:35] Peter why because Peter was the career
[58:39] of the seed at the time the angel of
[58:46] told Peter repite at cuarto con ella
[58:49] Cornelius just believe that Jesus Christ
[58:51] has died and resurrected and does it you
[58:53] are saved by rain and that is the
[58:58] problem in this message people are
[59:01] believing in a dead God now this is my
[59:06] point what I want to see that a dead
[59:09] person cannot give you new Beth new
[59:15] birth can only come through the body of
[59:17] Christ a career of the Jim let me put it
[59:25] straight this way
[59:26] brethren brother Brahm is dead Abraham
[59:32] cannot give you new Beth and this is the
[59:37] problem in the message people think that
[59:40] by reading or playing the tapes of a
[59:42] LeBron they have been born again a
[59:46] career of the sea somebody see when
[59:49] brother Brahm came with a message he
[59:51] planted a seed into some people or two
[59:55] into somebody then that somebody or
[59:58] those people who does in whom that seed
[1:00:00] was planted also planted into somebody
[1:00:02] so you must come across he is a
[1:00:05] bloodline so you must come across
[1:00:09] somebody who is in that bloodline to
[1:00:11] plant a seed in you if you do not come
[1:00:14] across somebody like that you'll be lost
[1:00:17] I don't know how to say Claire I again
[1:00:23] read read we listen
[1:00:25] Abraham give
[1:00:30] to Ishmael and to Isaac but Isaac but I
[1:00:37] smell was not a promise eat do you know
[1:00:40] that I was yet it was a son of Abraham
[1:00:46] but don't forget he was also a son of
[1:00:48] the bondwoman Hagar I think gave birth
[1:00:55] to twist this time not two sons from
[1:00:57] different women from the same womb twins
[1:00:59] born the same day but Esau was not a
[1:01:03] promise eat Jacob was a promise seed so
[1:01:17] what if you came across an Esau he
[1:01:19] planned the city you do a son of Isaac
[1:01:26] what if you came across Ishmael can he
[1:01:30] plant the city you did the descendants
[1:01:34] of Ishmael become is your eye part of
[1:01:36] Israel did the descendants of Esau
[1:01:38] become part of Israel so it's a
[1:01:41] bloodline and God always protects that
[1:01:45] bloodline amen
[1:01:50] so brethren it is important that a
[1:01:52] career of the seed plus a living career
[1:01:56] of the seed must plant the seed in you
[1:02:01] it sounds like we say in the Old
[1:02:04] Testament
[1:02:04] LaBarbara who preach and say what if
[1:02:08] Moses had said well in the antediluvian
[1:02:12] destruction God made Noah to come out
[1:02:16] and a cough go far would pitch it else I
[1:02:19] preached it inside and sealed it okay so
[1:02:22] if God is going to rescue my people let
[1:02:24] me also make an AK and put it on a tire
[1:02:26] and let's float in it they would have
[1:02:28] all died in the Nile but yet the same
[1:02:33] God that is continuing the same thing I
[1:02:34] did in the days of Noah deliveries
[1:02:37] people even see the
[1:02:43] problem is that we human beings we
[1:02:48] always believe in a pass the roms are
[1:02:54] the most difficult team for a human
[1:02:56] being is for him to listen to his fellow
[1:02:59] human being to accept the word of his
[1:03:03] fellow human being it's the same problem
[1:03:07] of data and Abraham and Cora has God
[1:03:11] spoken only by Moses very there's
[1:03:18] nothing wrong with reverence my see
[1:03:19] that's what I'm saying
[1:03:20] Bram Browns message is correct and that
[1:03:23] is the reveal word for word II and every
[1:03:29] preacher must tap from that way
[1:03:32] hallelujah
[1:03:33] but I'm saying that the Bible says that
[1:03:37] God has placed in the church apostles
[1:03:41] prophets teachers pastors evangelists
[1:03:45] for what for the perfecting of the
[1:03:49] saints so how do you become perfect and
[1:03:52] if you do not listen to a human being
[1:03:58] but somebody has to breathe that word to
[1:04:01] you but that's somebody can not just be
[1:04:04] anybody that's what I'm trying to say so
[1:04:09] before Jesus Christ left the scene he
[1:04:11] said unto Peter and mattresses they said
[1:04:13] I gave you the keys of the kingdom so
[1:04:19] Peter had the keys of the kingdom so he
[1:04:22] had the authority to open that kingdom
[1:04:25] to Jews to Samaritans and to Gentiles
[1:04:28] the three class of people that were
[1:04:30] existing in those days and we know on
[1:04:33] the day of Pentecost he opened that I
[1:04:35] mean he used that key of the kingdom and
[1:04:37] the Holy Ghost fell upon the people in
[1:04:39] upper room who were all Jews all right
[1:04:43] the same Peter listen Simon Philip had
[1:04:48] gone to Samaria to preach the word the
[1:04:53] people believed there was one Simon the
[1:04:55] sorcerer who was be reaching the people
[1:04:56] who
[1:04:57] everybody thought was just I mean a
[1:05:00] mighty man of God but I cannot to be a
[1:05:04] con man
[1:05:06] so when Philip went there his DS were
[1:05:08] exposed and the people all believe in
[1:05:10] Phillip by watch Philip couldn't pray
[1:05:13] even though he had been to Pentacles he
[1:05:16] couldn't pray for the people to receive
[1:05:17] the Holy Ghost because he was not
[1:05:19] commissioned to do it
[1:05:23] the commission was Peter he has to first
[1:05:28] open the gates of the kingdom to
[1:05:31] everything he had a key to all these
[1:05:34] three groups before others could not do
[1:05:36] it so he sent for Peter and John and the
[1:05:41] Bible says that when they came to
[1:05:42] Samaria they prayed for the people and
[1:05:44] they received the Holy Ghost and started
[1:05:46] speaking in tongues is all right so the
[1:05:50] same way Cornelius was the first person
[1:05:54] among the Gentiles that the holy the
[1:05:56] Holy Ghost fell on and Cornelius I mean
[1:06:02] I see also wise that when the angel came
[1:06:05] an angel from God came to Camille's why
[1:06:08] is that the angel didn't give him the
[1:06:09] Holy Ghost why he wasn't a career
[1:06:18] hallelujah
[1:06:19] so they had to you see God is specific
[1:06:25] well in this is key
[1:06:27] Cole is specific we shouldn't think that
[1:06:29] we can do things anyhow and still be in
[1:06:33] a plan of God
[1:06:34] rain rain it doesn't work that way God
[1:06:36] is specific this message is specific
[1:06:39] sisters
[1:06:39] this message is specific how you must
[1:06:43] dress it specific it's very important I
[1:06:47] know who we are we are in the United
[1:06:49] States of America yeah the land of the
[1:06:52] free so everybody does it's hard for a
[1:06:55] preacher to be hard on setting things
[1:06:57] because I mean people who may just walk
[1:07:00] away a brother preaches hard even if
[1:07:02] they walk away glory to God yeah which
[1:07:08] is hard
[1:07:11] this generation is Evo is our daughters
[1:07:15] enlisting you allow ho a little leaving
[1:07:19] the Bible say living a little living we
[1:07:21] just live in the whole lump
[1:07:24] little tu Allah before I realize it has
[1:07:27] become the norm
[1:07:29] Amen in Africa back in Africa we are
[1:07:34] very hard because this is I see sisters
[1:07:39] wearing this pencil like shoes you know
[1:07:43] issues with pencil and talking to some
[1:07:48] of you before about it the message is
[1:07:51] against it and science has proven that
[1:07:59] it's for your own health especially you
[1:08:01] the young ones science has proved I'd
[1:08:04] even effects the wound conception and
[1:08:06] everything what I'm preaching about so
[1:08:10] success in this message these things are
[1:08:13] not for granted once the prophet of God
[1:08:16] have said it and your preachers are
[1:08:17] telling you you listen to it amen
[1:08:22] so the angel was specific specific he
[1:08:29] didn't say go and fetch John when he
[1:08:33] said go this Peter is a japa he's
[1:08:37] dwelling with analyst I'm a who lives by
[1:08:40] the seaside call him when he comes he
[1:08:44] will tell you what he or test to do the
[1:08:49] angel relieved of all he must do it was
[1:08:52] the duty of Peter to come and tell him
[1:08:55] what he must do and at the same time
[1:09:00] that the angel of the Lord was speaking
[1:09:02] to him every she was appearing to Peter
[1:09:05] - Peter saw all these on clean teens and
[1:09:09] all that said say kill and eat say what
[1:09:14] Rita don't clean say hog or has
[1:09:17] sanctified don't : clean you know Peter
[1:09:20] was still living in his Jewish
[1:09:24] like God God is patient one of the
[1:09:30] virtues isn't it God is very patient
[1:09:34] long-suffering very long suffering and I
[1:09:40] like that
[1:09:41] look at the pictures he has heart for
[1:09:43] the human race if it was any of us in
[1:09:47] his position would have come down
[1:09:48] destroy the whole thing by now
[1:09:51] come on is not pushing our God is
[1:09:56] patient knowing very well that give him
[1:09:58] adequate time everybody has everybody
[1:10:01] can change of course he knows who is
[1:10:04] going to change from the beginning so
[1:10:08] brethren pataki and when Peter came
[1:10:15] Canelo saw him and say wow this demand
[1:10:19] and the angel has directed meet you then
[1:10:22] this man is God in flesh
[1:10:25] you know Gentiles like worshipping
[1:10:28] things Jews who never worship a man and
[1:10:32] that is why they crucified Jesus Christ
[1:10:34] he being a man the kings of God so
[1:10:38] instantly Cornelius when they bow down
[1:10:41] before Peter Peter said rise up
[1:10:42] Cornelius
[1:10:44] I myself am a man like you I also need
[1:10:47] some needed salvation just like you
[1:10:51] amen and the Bible says in verse 44
[1:10:56] that's why I says you pay attention to
[1:10:57] verse 44 he says that while Peter yet
[1:11:01] speak rarely see the spooky wake
[1:11:06] somebody must speak the gospel to
[1:11:09] Cornelius for Cornelius to hear and
[1:11:11] believe before what he before the Holy
[1:11:14] Ghost the new birth and the Holy Ghost
[1:11:16] can come so Brahm is he said while Peter
[1:11:21] yet spake these words the Holy Ghost
[1:11:23] fell on all them which had their word
[1:11:26] which was had their word so a living
[1:11:33] carrier of the word had to go to
[1:11:34] Cornelius house and
[1:11:36] member of the body who had a seed which
[1:11:40] is the word had to go to Cornelius house
[1:11:42] speak the way for Cornelius here before
[1:11:47] the Holy Ghost who come you see God's
[1:11:49] order amen
[1:11:53] so seed has to be planted in him and a
[1:11:58] seed is what brings the change it's when
[1:12:02] a seed that is planted in you is
[1:12:04] nourished by the water of the Spirit
[1:12:08] then Christ is formed in you and when
[1:12:13] Christ is forming you that changes your
[1:12:16] nature your desires are all gone the
[1:12:23] filter things that used to come to your
[1:12:25] mind are all gone there you are now a
[1:12:29] new creature you are not a new being a
[1:12:33] certified vessel that Dow God can use
[1:12:38] hallelujah amen
[1:12:41] sobering until Cornelius came across
[1:12:44] than living witness he could not receive
[1:12:48] the Holy Ghost even though he received
[1:12:52] an angel in his house because I've come
[1:12:55] across people who tell you about how the
[1:12:58] visitations they are receiving in their
[1:12:59] rules
[1:13:00] how angela has appeared to them and if
[1:13:02] become so arrogant by that I don't
[1:13:04] listen to another human being again I've
[1:13:09] seen it it's a lot of witches in this
[1:13:11] message Barry you don't become
[1:13:15] born-again by angelic visitations I won
[1:13:21] I'm saying you don't become born-again
[1:13:22] by what an angelic visitation you become
[1:13:25] born-again by a human being
[1:13:27] speaking the word to you so if a human
[1:13:32] being as I speak that word to you and
[1:13:33] you claim an angel visited you and I
[1:13:35] interchange you I know I'm popular
[1:13:38] minister in my country who said in 1975
[1:13:41] an angel stood behind him and call him
[1:13:43] and gave him the Bible and that's how
[1:13:45] he's changed kid
[1:13:49] his deeds show that he's not born again
[1:13:56] because I'm injured cannot make you born
[1:13:58] again ray green the Ethiopian eunuch he
[1:14:05] was highly educated the right acts I
[1:14:09] think as after each he was here don't
[1:14:13] worship in Jerusalem I was returning to
[1:14:16] Ethiopia was in his chariot he could
[1:14:19] read and he was actually reading Isaiah
[1:14:22] 53 amen Philip came then split on a lot
[1:14:31] led Philip to the child's do you
[1:14:32] understand what do I really
[1:14:33] I like his answer he said how can I
[1:14:38] understand a set em side man explains it
[1:14:41] to me pretty soon new birth cannot come
[1:14:47] by you I mean I some peoples have read
[1:14:49] thousand messages and read five hundred
[1:14:51] messages
[1:14:52] so I'm filled with a word that is not
[1:14:55] that it doesn't come that way so you
[1:14:57] can't sit at home and say you are
[1:14:59] playing games and you know come to
[1:15:01] church to come and listen to a preacher
[1:15:02] and say you have new bed it doesn't
[1:15:05] happen now II Philippe Internet chariot
[1:15:13] and starting from the same screams and
[1:15:16] he was reading that in anak was reading
[1:15:19] preach Christ to him then they came to
[1:15:23] water here's what I hope prevents me so
[1:15:26] Philip myself spoken about baptism so
[1:15:29] here's what help prevents me from being
[1:15:32] baptized the Bible said he went down
[1:15:35] into the water and he came out and he
[1:15:39] was baptized that is how he received his
[1:15:42] salvation amen Gregory in conclusion I
[1:15:49] want to read something to you from hot
[1:15:51] harbor LeBron put it maybe I I didn't
[1:15:56] say it right
[1:16:02] in paragraph 210 of the message the
[1:16:06] spoken word is original seed we Ambrym
[1:16:10] said before the actual spiritual death
[1:16:13] can take place the word has to find
[1:16:18] himself true your mind believe it that's
[1:16:25] why say he died here at my worst and
[1:16:28] believe it on him that sent me has
[1:16:31] eternal life why what was the problem
[1:16:37] with the Jews they say we believe the
[1:16:42] words of Moses and the prophets but
[1:16:45] Moses and the prophets are dead and gone
[1:16:49] here was somebody with them who was a
[1:16:52] living carrier of the word for their day
[1:16:55] they rejected our and believe in the
[1:16:57] history yes it
[1:17:04] I shall not come to the judgment but has
[1:17:08] passed from death unto life see so first
[1:17:15] before my job f can take place
[1:17:18] he said that wet has to find itself
[1:17:20] through your mind because you know even
[1:17:26] the devil before the devil came and work
[1:17:28] on Eve in the Garden of Eden you have to
[1:17:30] work on the mind drop a message into the
[1:17:34] mind of Eve did God said thou shalt not
[1:17:39] eat of every fruit in the garden he said
[1:17:42] no God says that we should eat of every
[1:17:45] fruit but of the fruit that is in the
[1:17:46] mists of the garden we shouldn't touch
[1:17:48] it
[1:17:50] say Oh God knows why because I did I eat
[1:17:54] of nothing you become like God if such a
[1:17:57] pondering but I want to be like God she
[1:18:02] wasn't satisfied with a state in which
[1:18:04] he was she wanted something higher just
[1:18:07] like the devil the devil also wanted to
[1:18:11] hire deeper things isn't it and that's
[1:18:18] how Eve led the whole human race into
[1:18:23] this for by reasoning it out the same
[1:18:27] way for life to come into you the Word
[1:18:30] of God as I'm preaching this morning
[1:18:32] it's been drop into your mind
[1:18:35] amen if you receive it you see the acid
[1:18:39] ADA Barbara Ham finished which I don't
[1:18:40] know which message it was he finished
[1:18:42] which may ask Billy become problem at a
[1:18:45] point was worried that the things that
[1:18:48] he was saying the church was not getting
[1:18:49] it in jeffersonville he was worried that
[1:18:53] even understand how he was saying so he
[1:18:55] asked belief the poor who still alive
[1:18:57] his son Billy did you understand someone
[1:19:01] this morning he say yes dad brother I
[1:19:06] knew it you understand if I are not
[1:19:07] supposed to understand you are supposed
[1:19:08] to believe it where in which
[1:19:14] to believe just believe the word of God
[1:19:16] even when we don't understand it at the
[1:19:18] moment that is spoken to us what we need
[1:19:21] to do is to believe it and prayerfully
[1:19:25] go to study it ourselves
[1:19:27] ask questions you'll come to understand
[1:19:30] it
[1:19:32] progress wonder he said the same as he
[1:19:34] said now remember God never committed
[1:19:38] God never committed his preaching and
[1:19:40] and his gospel to an angel so this one
[1:19:46] I'm taking my message from said God
[1:19:48] never committed his message God never
[1:19:51] commit a his word to an angel
[1:19:55] so message believers and all this
[1:19:57] Pentecostal preachers who talked about
[1:19:59] angelic visitations and all that
[1:20:02] somebody's asked for him is an injured I
[1:20:04] called him it's only the major prophet
[1:20:09] of the day that God deals with that way
[1:20:11] God Himself comes to plant a seed in him
[1:20:13] but Rob Rama said in every age in the
[1:20:16] church ages he said in every age the
[1:20:18] message of God come from one corner from
[1:20:23] one man and from that man the message is
[1:20:27] spread by others who have been carefully
[1:20:29] taught by them but the careers of the
[1:20:33] message are not careful to say only what
[1:20:37] the messenger has said and that's how
[1:20:40] the message gets contaminated diluted
[1:20:43] and as time goes on it becomes
[1:20:45] completely polluted so God didn't commit
[1:20:51] his preaching his gospel to an angel
[1:20:55] how many knows that question how many
[1:20:58] knows that Galatians 1 to 8 said if an
[1:21:01] angel from heaven preach something else
[1:21:04] beside what they preach let it be a kiss
[1:21:09] so the angel is wrong if he is different
[1:21:12] from the word God can you see
[1:21:15] poor Aleppo Apostle Paul was so sure and
[1:21:19] even Apostle Paul I read not you shortly
[1:21:22] before we close even Apostle Paul when
[1:21:27] you
[1:21:27] was caught it was caught himself that
[1:21:29] called him is that right and he was a
[1:21:31] disposition a preacher he was not an
[1:21:36] ordinary preacher like he was on a five
[1:21:39] fold ministry preacher he was at this
[1:21:42] position a preacher he was a first
[1:21:44] messenger to the church ages their fish
[1:21:46] and
[1:21:46] each amen but when the angel of the Lord
[1:21:50] met him when he was genuine from
[1:21:52] Jerusalem to Damascus and I appeared to
[1:21:54] him in a pillar who say who are thou say
[1:21:57] i'm it's hard for thee to kick against
[1:22:00] they provide persecuted now me and all
[1:22:02] you know the story what did they angel'
[1:22:05] do the angel didn't call or God or did
[1:22:08] go to God didn't call Paul and put him
[1:22:10] in a room somewhere and say Paul I'm
[1:22:11] going to teach you because if God does
[1:22:13] that they'll be confusion but they were
[1:22:16] living
[1:22:17] Tereus of the seed already the angel
[1:22:21] died record Paul today he said go to the
[1:22:25] city go and look for on an ass and an
[1:22:27] ass is going to pray for you the scale
[1:22:30] will fall of your eyes you see and I
[1:22:32] will use you for my wake
[1:22:35] so that may Paul to realize that those
[1:22:38] people who he was persecuting we're
[1:22:40] preaching the truth otherwise they'll be
[1:22:42] contradiction among them every one is an
[1:22:46] angel that gave it to me someone who's
[1:22:47] hello as for me I met Jesus Christ
[1:22:49] himself was not on the coefficient in
[1:22:52] Corinthians
[1:22:53] this was am of apollos this was I'm of
[1:22:56] Peter Zampa for that was a confucian
[1:23:02] hallelujah so the angel is wrong if he's
[1:23:06] different from the way God came on down
[1:23:09] below angels and committed it to men
[1:23:12] which were sons you believe it so God
[1:23:16] has permitted his word to sons not to
[1:23:20] angels so I I don't want any angel
[1:23:24] preaching to me I want human beings to
[1:23:26] preach to me now Philip had been up to
[1:23:35] pentacle Jerusalem to worship
[1:23:36] how many says amen to that the inner he
[1:23:40] had been with all
[1:23:41] DDD's and lgd's you know we had all the
[1:23:45] degrees a PhD and masters and everything
[1:23:49] but why didn't he get something he come
[1:23:53] back down studying the prophecy of
[1:23:55] Isaiah
[1:23:56] although an angel director Philip to him
[1:24:00] but the gem of life had to come through
[1:24:04] the body
[1:24:06] Philip oh brother now we are on the line
[1:24:10] where did the gem come from through the
[1:24:13] angel the angel showed him where to go
[1:24:16] an angel is a messenger here is a son so
[1:24:21] Philip is a son right you realize that
[1:24:23] so you need a son of God to plant the
[1:24:28] seed in you that's why I said the career
[1:24:31] of the seed has to be a viable career
[1:24:33] that's why I don't listen to anybody and
[1:24:35] say you are born again and then Philip
[1:24:41] Philip had a gem the message the word
[1:24:45] that's how a child can be born do you
[1:24:50] get that
[1:24:51] Philip laid his hands upon him Philip
[1:24:54] baptized him in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:24:56] there comes for the Spirit of God sure
[1:24:58] now that gem had to come from the body
[1:25:01] what body Christ's body correct and
[1:25:04] Philip was a member of the body where in
[1:25:10] us we are on earth now remember cor said
[1:25:15] that he's never going to leave him so
[1:25:18] without a witness so the body of crisis
[1:25:21] on earth now we are the body and if seed
[1:25:25] will be planted in anybody to receive
[1:25:27] new birth that seed has to come from a
[1:25:31] member of that body otherwise that
[1:25:33] person is actually bringing V amen now
[1:25:38] listen the same thing took place in Acts
[1:25:41] chapter 10 verse 48 Peter was on the
[1:25:45] housetop and Angel directed him to
[1:25:47] connealy us house but where did the word
[1:25:49] come from the body never answer who
[1:25:54] who feel pretty good feel like traveling
[1:25:57] up and injure come and said don't worry
[1:26:00] don't call nothing unclean just go on
[1:26:02] don't think nothing and while Peter
[1:26:05] spake these words not the angel not the
[1:26:11] Cardinal I get in it
[1:26:13] Wow Peter spake these words what he was
[1:26:17] the body he had a word the word took
[1:26:20] hold
[1:26:21] oh brother my angel directed it but the
[1:26:26] life come true the body of Christ
[1:26:33] how many are with me Paul on his way to
[1:26:37] Damascus I'm reading still cutting
[1:26:40] Barbra ham from Prague rap for 390 up to
[1:26:45] 3 up to a run fo fo night I'm going read
[1:26:48] it on your own said Paul on his way to
[1:26:50] Damascus a vision directed him but Anna
[1:26:54] Ananias had the gym had the weight amen
[1:26:58] the Prophet and and I saw a vision that
[1:27:01] said go up there lay your hands on him
[1:27:04] said brother saw the Lord appeared to
[1:27:07] you in the road coming down here how did
[1:27:10] he knew he had a weight the word of the
[1:27:13] Lord came to the Prophet prophesied went
[1:27:15] up there and said he come he he come has
[1:27:20] sent me up here
[1:27:21] I might lay my hands upon you and you
[1:27:23] will be healed and received the Holy
[1:27:25] Ghost receive your sight the scales fell
[1:27:28] off his eyes he rose was baptized the
[1:27:31] name of Jesus went in the name of Jesus
[1:27:34] went to steady angel directed it that's
[1:27:40] right but poor Ananias had the seed jam
[1:27:46] it takes the Spirit of God the seed to
[1:27:50] give life eternal my flower this is what
[1:27:56] is on my heart to tell you this morning
[1:28:00] that the gem of life just like in a
[1:28:05] natural it
[1:28:06] come to the man's body see the woman has
[1:28:10] the egg but there's no life in that egg
[1:28:13] I'll add it by itself cannot reproduce
[1:28:16] it can really produce life had to come
[1:28:19] from the body of the man for that egg I
[1:28:22] mean for the woman to conceive all right
[1:28:25] and I'm saying that that is the same
[1:28:28] thing in the spirit in the spiritual
[1:28:31] realm life has to come through a member
[1:28:35] of the body which body the body of
[1:28:40] Christ and if their life finds a fatter
[1:28:44] heart it will reproduce Christ so
[1:28:49] brother this morning I want you to set
[1:28:51] yourselves it starts at yourself you've
[1:28:53] been receiving seed your life is not
[1:28:58] changing the life is to the same you can
[1:29:05] look back and say I have no heart I want
[1:29:08] to be by what I was I'm not can you
[1:29:13] sincerely look at your past life and
[1:29:16] tell yourself that even though you are
[1:29:19] not yet what you want to be what you
[1:29:21] wear now you can say God in heaven knows
[1:29:25] whether you can't you can't you can
[1:29:28] deceive me by you cannot deceive
[1:29:29] yourself can deceive yourself can you
[1:29:33] look at your life and say what I was I'm
[1:29:35] not if you are still hot away before
[1:29:43] receiving this message and come into
[1:29:45] fellowship I want to tell you this
[1:29:49] morning that there's nothing wrong with
[1:29:50] a seed that has been planted there may
[1:29:54] be everything wrong with the heart of
[1:29:57] which it is falling on the womb of the
[1:30:00] mind on which it is falling as I said
[1:30:05] until the Sun Sun you are not supposed
[1:30:07] to understand it you are supposed to
[1:30:10] believe it all you need is to believe
[1:30:13] this wait don't reason it and if you can
[1:30:19] die
[1:30:20] you see when Paul received this Paul
[1:30:25] said what I was all the knowledge I
[1:30:31] gained another feat of the Miller
[1:30:33] it's a pole attended the most
[1:30:35] prestigious university at a time
[1:30:39] Paul was taught by the most prestigious
[1:30:42] professor of the word at the time a man
[1:30:46] of wisdom he told the other FRC's say
[1:30:50] look if what these boys are doing is of
[1:30:55] God we will be found to be fighting
[1:30:57] against God but if it was if it's not of
[1:31:00] God who come to not remember I think a
[1:31:03] scepter four or five there the man was
[1:31:05] full of wisdom familiar he to import or
[1:31:09] so so so was so sure of what he believed
[1:31:16] he said of his upset as far as the law
[1:31:20] is concerned I saw I'm blameless you
[1:31:23] complete me I followed everything to the
[1:31:28] dot but when I met Christ on the road to
[1:31:32] Damascus after animals have prayed for
[1:31:36] me Oh what I was in the past I consider
[1:31:40] it a stunt I know how Danny's that's C
[1:31:48] cosas del estanque maybe your past life
[1:31:54] you were such a prestigious body held in
[1:31:58] highest US celebrity let me call it ours
[1:32:00] I know how we call them all these nasty
[1:32:02] things from Hollywood we call them
[1:32:04] celebrity there I the nakedness from
[1:32:06] Hollywood is called celebrity he made
[1:32:14] maybe
[1:32:15] a celebrity and you don't want to leave
[1:32:18] that status rather until you consider
[1:32:21] that all that pass all the so-called
[1:32:23] Italy and well lead glory of the passes
[1:32:26] dunk and ten fully to receive this way
[1:32:30] death cannot take place in you those
[1:32:35] things who took the work who took it
[1:32:39] oh this world is choking the wedding us
[1:32:47] very time is fast paint the nomination
[1:32:51] our time is gone this is the time that
[1:32:54] God is dealing only with the bride
[1:32:57] nomination each has been sworn out that
[1:33:02] is why you look at his nominations they
[1:33:04] are getting worse and worse and worse
[1:33:06] look at the Pentecostal movement in
[1:33:08] America it was really on fire and it was
[1:33:13] from this Pentecostal movement that we
[1:33:15] in Africa received a message of course
[1:33:17] the Europeans are brother gospel to us
[1:33:20] during : the colonial days our
[1:33:23] dependence on movement uh sprang forth
[1:33:25] in in Africa came from here now where is
[1:33:30] it all at the Billy gray harms Oral
[1:33:35] Roberts all the things that he did in
[1:33:37] the past where are all these churches
[1:33:38] now they bind hundred million Jets
[1:33:44] that's all that's all the process
[1:33:46] concerned themselves about I had one
[1:33:49] pastor saying that if he takes a
[1:33:51] commercial flight he cannot be in a tube
[1:33:54] of demons so as you see so when you take
[1:33:56] you sit in an economic class and fly
[1:33:59] Delta from here to Minneapolis you are
[1:34:00] in a tomb of demons so he meets a
[1:34:03] private jet where he can pray and be
[1:34:05] with God oh my god that's what the
[1:34:08] Pentecostal movement has become
[1:34:17] that's the truth that's what the
[1:34:18] Pentecostal movement has become they I
[1:34:20] guess because they rejected their
[1:34:22] messenger they did not recognize that
[1:34:25] all their visitation God God came down
[1:34:28] to them Jesus confess to the Jews Rob
[1:34:32] ROM camp came faithfully Pentecost us
[1:34:35] for the way the closest their message
[1:34:37] confess to them they rejected it the
[1:34:41] team they rejected it
[1:34:43] by 1960 we are shown it away all the
[1:34:50] Libra and he demonstrated to them more
[1:34:54] than any of the approaches that that
[1:34:58] cannot be man that was caught because
[1:35:00] they believed in science and
[1:35:02] manifestations indeed but in signs of
[1:35:05] manifestations the prophet eclipsed all
[1:35:07] the oppressors and yet they were jealous
[1:35:09] about him jealous of him so pretty let's
[1:35:13] look at our lives let's look back we may
[1:35:18] not go want to be but the good thing is
[1:35:20] if you are not what you wear that's you
[1:35:23] on a good road if you can look back and
[1:35:28] stealth at yourself you are worse off
[1:35:30] the hot you where you need to go on your
[1:35:32] knees you need to come and cry to God
[1:35:35] now Ram said I didn't say everything but
[1:35:38] Ron said that see the new Beth is saying
[1:35:41] you have to wrestle with God like Jacob
[1:35:46] did and was changed

[1:41:39] [Music]

[1:41:48] [Music]
[1:41:57] [Applause]
[1:42:02] [Music]
[1:42:22] [Music]
[1:42:35] [Music]
[1:42:48] [Music]
[1:42:55] amen I trust everybody was blessed this
[1:42:58] morning the word of the Lord is perfect
[1:43:03] and we thank God that such a beautiful
[1:43:07] picture was given one thing for certain
[1:43:13] we know you got you must be born again
[1:43:15] and I thank God for the brother it was a
[1:43:18] perfect picture it was just wonderful
[1:43:22] because so many people do believe it
[1:43:26] only a preacher to be saved but
[1:43:29] throughout the Scriptures we know that
[1:43:30] God has people in of God you know that's
[1:43:34] that's one of the reasons why God
[1:43:37] doesn't ordain women to be preachers
[1:43:39] they can't carry the see it cannot be a
[1:43:45] correct birth through a woman preacher
[1:43:47] and that's what people don't understand
[1:43:50] it has to be a male it has to be a man
[1:43:53] it can't be an angel and it can't be a
[1:43:56] woman it doesn't matter how it looks
[1:43:59] like oh it's being blessed but looks are
[1:44:03] deceiving the Word of God right says all
[1:44:07] whose names were not written in the
[1:44:09] Lamb's Book of Life was the seed and I
[1:44:15] think God you know it doesn't throw away
[1:44:17] all your experiences but when you have
[1:44:19] an experience every experience must be
[1:44:22] measured back to the word every
[1:44:25] experience and we thank God for that I
[1:44:28] I'm just blessed you know two things I
[1:44:35] want to say is that all of us have needs
[1:44:42] all of us have needs all of us even here
[1:44:46] this morning need more of God I love
[1:44:50] that it's something it ain't the word
[1:44:53] that's the problem it ain't the
[1:44:55] preaching that's the problem it ain't it
[1:44:57] ain't I've seen I've seen people by the
[1:45:00] Word of God that I think it's the
[1:45:03] perfect way it is the only way whether
[1:45:05] it's now or later it is the word that
[1:45:07] brings the birth I've seen preached
[1:45:11] people I've seen in my own when even in
[1:45:14] Lima I seen a man a brother who's gone
[1:45:17] on the glory and I've seen a sister by
[1:45:19] the preaching of the word received the
[1:45:21] Holy goes right in the service you see
[1:45:24] how they know not only did was their
[1:45:26] visible signs but it was also changed in
[1:45:30] their lives one of my precious friends
[1:45:34] with one of her best of friends
[1:45:36] his name was Titus and it was like what
[1:45:39] a month or later he was home to be with
[1:45:41] the Lord a new convert I don't even know
[1:45:45] what he was a whole year old but he knew
[1:45:49] this message was right amen did help me
[1:45:53] or in the witnessing feel but I say all
[1:45:56] of this to say to you by God's grace you
[1:45:59] know if there's something lacking in
[1:46:02] your life you know and like like he said
[1:46:06] about that woo it ain't God's Word yo
[1:46:09] your heart has four conditions or
[1:46:11] grounds that it could be and there's
[1:46:14] only one one ground that's really good
[1:46:16] when that word bring forth one
[1:46:18] hundredfold Amen everybody else was the
[1:46:22] things of the world choke them you know
[1:46:24] their heart was too hard you know just
[1:46:27] this so stings and you know Hollywood
[1:46:31] and all these things you got to forget
[1:46:33] all of that and if you're not willing to
[1:46:36] release all that in the heart in the
[1:46:38] hands of God you'll never be born again
[1:46:40] you'll never be able to change
[1:46:43] everything must die is the Prophet God
[1:46:46] said and rock hallelujah and then when
[1:46:50] you get that born-again experience then
[1:46:53] you grow into the perfect statue of
[1:46:55] Christ
[1:46:56] hallelujah but your God I have you can't
[1:46:59] grow into the statue of Christ without
[1:47:01] the birth first you gotta have it and
[1:47:05] you and I must understand Amen that
[1:47:08] that's what God says like I said no
[1:47:11] aliens transported you into this
[1:47:13] dimension no aliens gonna take you out
[1:47:16] of here
[1:47:17] there's only way one way you came into
[1:47:19] this earth and that was my birth there's
[1:47:23] only one way you going out of this earth
[1:47:25] that's by birth you don't be born again
[1:47:30] you don't see a new life you see a life
[1:47:34] or death but you don't see you look oh
[1:47:37] you said oh god I want to be resurrected
[1:47:39] everybody's going to be resurrected and
[1:47:45] the white throne judgment all Devils all
[1:47:48] demon-possessed everybody that was lost
[1:47:51] will be resurrected that's what you call
[1:47:54] the second resurrection
[1:47:56] thank God about the Lord say blessing on
[1:47:59] the man are those who who are part of
[1:48:01] the first resurrection
[1:48:03] so I say these things by the grace of
[1:48:06] God I'm not gonna beg you to come and
[1:48:10] pray and you know what that's like
[1:48:14] forcing a man and I'm not no but I
[1:48:19] really believe that somebody in here
[1:48:21] this morning should have been up here
[1:48:22] for prayer before he didn't ask for it
[1:48:26] just a weird one but I've and
[1:48:48] now be
[1:48:51] come to the you don't have to come up
