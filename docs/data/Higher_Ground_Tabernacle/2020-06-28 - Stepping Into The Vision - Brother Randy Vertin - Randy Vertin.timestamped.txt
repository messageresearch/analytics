[1:38:48] hallelujah whoa sing from your heart you
[1:38:55] oh my
[1:38:58] I see are you my speed
[1:39:06] [Music]
[1:39:26] you know the Word of God was so old time
[1:39:30] this morning we thank your brother for
[1:39:32] yielding to the Holy Spirit it is truly
[1:39:36] my desire to give God all that I can
[1:39:38] give him we're all faced with trials
[1:39:41] temptations troubles we battle every day
[1:39:45] and some of us all day but we do have
[1:39:49] one that we can turn to and that is the
[1:39:53] Lord Jesus Christ I believe with all my
[1:39:56] heart by God's grace that the Lord is
[1:40:02] soon to come and I know one thing no
[1:40:05] unclean thing is going to enter in we
[1:40:08] can call ourselves bride I mean brother
[1:40:12] Branham and Satan's heating and I wish
[1:40:14] you'd go home and listen to that tape
[1:40:16] Satan's either you should go home and
[1:40:19] listen to it so you'll know that it's
[1:40:22] not brother Brooks it's words sometimes
[1:40:25] we take this message for granted we
[1:40:28] think God gonna just week at our
[1:40:29] ignorance he's not the day of God's
[1:40:32] winking is over you understand and each
[1:40:36] and every one Bible said this is the
[1:40:37] house of judgment right here right here
[1:40:41] this is where you're judged and when you
[1:40:43] don't like the correction of the word
[1:40:45] that means you don't like Jesus
[1:40:48] correcting you amen but the bride of
[1:40:51] Jesus Christ must realize when you come
[1:40:54] here things are going to be said to you
[1:40:56] that your flesh don't like hallelujah
[1:41:01] amen go listen to that message because
[1:41:05] brother Balaam said that is the devil's
[1:41:07] trick to make a lot of Christians
[1:41:10] believe that they are Christians when
[1:41:12] they're not I don't want to be fooled or
[1:41:15] deceived by the devil hallelujah you
[1:41:20] understand me we're living in the last
[1:41:22] days I believe that with all of my heart
[1:41:24] I think your brother you know I don't
[1:41:28] know what it's going to call us people -
[1:41:30] what would what it what is going to take
[1:41:32] to cause people to repent people don't
[1:41:36] know how to repent anymore they don't
[1:41:39] know how to feel sorry
[1:41:40] for their sins they don't know how to
[1:41:42] cry they don't know the only emotional
[1:41:44] things they know how to do is when
[1:41:46] they're eating and having a fun time
[1:41:49] it's true people just don't know how to
[1:41:51] do that anymore they they're so hard
[1:41:53] because unforgiveness unforgiveness will
[1:41:57] harden your heart like a stone so much
[1:42:01] so you won't be able to even hear the
[1:42:03] word of God
[1:42:04] once it's preached I'm gonna tell you I
[1:42:07] don't have nothing in my life right now
[1:42:10] no offenses or anything that I feel like
[1:42:14] I'm justified in not forgiving because
[1:42:19] the Bible said if we can't forgive our
[1:42:21] brothers and sisters God can't forgive
[1:42:23] you you wasting your time trying to be a
[1:42:26] Christian God is real I really feel like
[1:42:32] crying because I realized that the
[1:42:35] people are not getting it there's so
[1:42:37] many of you not getting it and you know
[1:42:40] the worst thing can happen to you is to
[1:42:41] be left behind to know this message and
[1:42:45] to be left behind oh my god have mercy
[1:42:49] think about all of the moments that the
[1:42:52] Holy Spirit tried to touch you try to
[1:42:54] reach your heart try to break that hole
[1:42:57] in your life and you hid you stood there
[1:42:58] and held it with pride because pride is
[1:43:02] the thing that would keep us all from
[1:43:04] making things right with God now I'm
[1:43:07] just gonna give a moment of silence
[1:43:10] I want our brother to pray that play
[1:43:12] that song some more you talk to God we
[1:43:15] gonna spend this time for prayer right
[1:43:17] now just now you speak to God in your
[1:43:19] heart
[1:43:20] because we're living in the last days
[1:43:22] and I tell you I can't even explain like
[1:43:25] the brothers here you see you see
[1:43:31] something don't know how to explain it
[1:43:34] but you know it's there and I do not
[1:43:37] want to get ahead of God I want to be
[1:43:39] right where God is so that when when
[1:43:42] that thing turned the corner I want to
[1:43:44] be able to turn the corner with let's
[1:43:47] pray all of us in your heart just pray
[1:43:49] if you can also speak with your lips do
[1:43:51] it with your lips talk to God just
[1:43:53] father you will be in that vision you
[1:43:57] want to be able to step into that vision
[1:43:59] you want to be part of that vision of
[1:44:02] the Lord Jesus we see how the world is
[1:44:04] entered into their vision Satan's
[1:44:08] inspiration we need the Holy Ghost
[1:44:10] inspiration the inspiration of this
[1:44:12] message living in us right now father
[1:44:15] God have mercy upon us Lord look beyond
[1:44:18] our fall see our knees break up that
[1:44:20] fallow ground like my brother said Lord
[1:44:22] that was you speaking this morning give
[1:44:26] us grace to forgive our brothers and
[1:44:27] sisters give us grace nor to forgive
[1:44:30] ourselves many of us can't even forgive

[1:44:38] and snares of Satan
