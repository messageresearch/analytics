[55:56] who is the image of the invisible god
[56:03] and the firstborn of every creature
[56:08] for by him were all things created
[56:12] that are in heaven and that are in earth

[56:30] and he is before all things
[56:33] and by him all things are
[56:36] uh consists and he is the head of the
[56:39] body the church
[56:41] who is the beginning the firstborn from

[56:53] should all fullness dwell now let us
[56:56] pray
[56:58] father we thank you for your amazing
[57:00] grace
[57:02] we thank you for being so good to us we
[57:05] thank you for being better to us than
[57:07] we've been to ourselves

[57:16] in your name lord jesus we sing in your

[57:20] we preach in your name we live in your
[57:22] name
[57:23] we pray father god that you would
[57:25] receive us tonight
[57:27] and give us the words to utter that your
[57:29] people may be blessed
[57:31] in jesus christ's name we pray amen you
[57:34] may be seated
[57:36] glad to see everybody here tonight
[57:39] on a rainy cold rainy day i told the
[57:42] lord i said lord you know i'm not ready
[57:44] for winter
[57:44] [Laughter]
[57:47] i can't even take 49 59 50 degrees right
[57:50] now
[57:51] and we all know that it's going to get
[57:53] it's going to drop when it comes
[57:56] but you know by god's grace his grace is
[57:58] sufficient
[57:59] and we so thank god for that we
[58:01] appreciate
[58:03] god giving us the grace to live and
[58:06] you know we look at this thing and i
[58:07] wanted to uh
[58:10] kind of uh give a little thought you
[58:12] know
[58:13] working with the new book and uh my
[58:16] subject would be behold the bridegroom
[58:19] cometh i kind of looked and i looked at
[58:23] the
[58:23] scripture today and i kind of looked on
[58:26] the internet to
[58:28] view what the jews would do for
[58:31] their ceremonial wedding the orthodox
[58:34] jews and i was really impressed i was
[58:36] amazed
[58:37] at the way a jewish wedding
[58:40] is constructed some of the things i will
[58:43] bring out tonight but not all but
[58:45] some of the one of the things that i
[58:47] didn't notice is that
[58:49] they had a ceremony where the bridegroom
[58:51] would break a glass
[58:53] he would put the glass on the floor and
[58:54] he would crush the glass and of course
[58:57] it had several meanings to it but one of
[59:00] the main
[59:01] thoughts that caught my mind was that
[59:04] the glass was to
[59:06] end one life like a single life
[59:10] in that life and of course the
[59:13] woman had to break a plate and of course
[59:16] that was to end her
[59:18] life the old life because now they're
[59:20] getting ready to unite as one
[59:23] and they used simple gold simple gold
[59:26] rings
[59:26] which symbolized of course deity but it
[59:29] also
[59:30] had the meaning of a circle or life that
[59:34] that would be enjoined that would never
[59:36] end
[59:37] and and i thought that was pretty good
[59:40] but one of the amazing things was that
[59:42] you know the brethren dance with the
[59:44] brothers and the sisters danced with the
[59:45] sisters
[59:46] and uh they would they would take uh a
[59:49] platform
[59:50] and they would have that the bride
[59:53] stand on that planned four set on it
[59:55] however and then they would lift her up
[59:58] above the head i thought that was pretty
[1:00:00] good
[1:00:02] and uh of course those of us who
[1:00:05] have a little something we can see what
[1:00:07] that mean uh and by the grace of god it
[1:00:09] was a really
[1:00:10] a wonderful thing and i thought to
[1:00:12] myself
[1:00:14] one of the things that that did happen
[1:00:15] that was quite unusual
[1:00:17] was that the bridegroom was the one who
[1:00:20] would put the veil
[1:00:21] over the bride and you know we normally
[1:00:24] in our service
[1:00:26] waiting ceremonies the bride comes in
[1:00:28] with the veil
[1:00:30] but here they lead the bride around
[1:00:33] with the veil on from one station to
[1:00:35] another
[1:00:36] and uh it was to see signify that
[1:00:41] that the groom was no longer interested
[1:00:43] in her
[1:00:44] features he was more in love with her
[1:00:47] character
[1:00:49] and uh i thought that was pretty good
[1:00:52] and you know the thing the thing that i
[1:00:54] also thought about
[1:00:56] is how um they were always giving
[1:01:00] secrets
[1:01:01] or they called blessings and uh
[1:01:04] the the the the bride had to walk around
[1:01:08] the groom
[1:01:08] seven times in a circle now if you're
[1:01:12] spiritual you'll get a little something
[1:01:14] and i thought that was awesome you know
[1:01:17] and
[1:01:18] you know we we know we come through
[1:01:19] seven church ages
[1:01:22] and uh and each parent had the blessed
[1:01:25] blight and it was wonderful and then the
[1:01:27] group
[1:01:28] had to whisper in her ear the contract
[1:01:33] that he had written out for the bride
[1:01:37] and i thought that was awesome because
[1:01:39] my god wrote out his contract too
[1:01:43] when we think about this message and we
[1:01:45] talk about
[1:01:48] uh a wedding and being
[1:01:51] betrothed or engaged you and i must
[1:01:54] understand that
[1:01:56] that's what brother branham did he was
[1:01:59] like eliza he introduced us to isaac
[1:02:02] even before we
[1:02:04] we did see him and he began to tell us
[1:02:08] all of the things that he uh that uh
[1:02:11] isaac liked and of course we fell
[1:02:14] in love with the words of character and
[1:02:16] that's what the bible is
[1:02:18] the bible is is the word of god
[1:02:22] and this word of god is describes the
[1:02:25] character of god and that's what i was
[1:02:28] trying to tell somebody i said
[1:02:30] it's not all the blessings that god has
[1:02:32] given me all the little
[1:02:34] you know things that he's done for me
[1:02:36] and his natural life it's not
[1:02:38] that's not what i have fallen in love
[1:02:40] with i have fallen in love with his
[1:02:42] character
[1:02:43] and that's the thing that i see in you
[1:02:45] know when i
[1:02:46] look at the kind of a man or the prophet
[1:02:48] that that god
[1:02:49] sent and he re god jesus christ
[1:02:52] reflected his character out of him
[1:02:54] it you know and i understand how
[1:02:56] sometimes people can't
[1:02:57] you know distinguish the difference
[1:02:59] between the two but one of the things
[1:03:01] that i i know
[1:03:02] is that uh the way uh the prophet of god
[1:03:04] handled himself
[1:03:06] was the character of christ reflecting
[1:03:08] through him
[1:03:10] because remember this prophet of i we
[1:03:12] know
[1:03:14] in his own nature had a few kinks in
[1:03:17] there
[1:03:18] but we find that god so loved us
[1:03:21] that he sent a prophet after his own
[1:03:24] heart
[1:03:25] someone that could really reflect uh
[1:03:28] christ or through christ could reflect
[1:03:30] himself through
[1:03:32] and and we could see god in in a way
[1:03:34] that denominations and organizations
[1:03:36] could not see
[1:03:38] now we understand that the bible has
[1:03:40] become a new book
[1:03:41] and and the reason why it's become a new
[1:03:43] book to the bride
[1:03:45] is because he's he's he's getting
[1:03:48] uh how could i say it he wants you to
[1:03:50] know him
[1:03:52] we're current in the new book in the new
[1:03:55] message in the word that god has brought
[1:03:56] to us in this day
[1:03:58] we are now beginning to understand
[1:04:01] jesus christ our lord in a way that
[1:04:04] we've never
[1:04:05] known him before now we've known him
[1:04:09] supposedly as a savior as a healer as a
[1:04:11] deliverer
[1:04:12] but i believe that in the portion that
[1:04:15] we're now
[1:04:16] uh uh uh how can i say the portion that
[1:04:19] we're now
[1:04:20] uh taking part of uh we're learning uh
[1:04:24] his what it is to be a husband right
[1:04:26] because the word of god tells us he's
[1:04:28] not only
[1:04:28] our savior our deliverer but he is our
[1:04:31] husband
[1:04:33] and so now we're learning how a husband
[1:04:35] is because remember
[1:04:37] the bible doesn't say where adam was
[1:04:40] when
[1:04:41] eve was deceived but one thing i know
[1:04:43] about my
[1:04:44] husband he said i'll never leave you nor
[1:04:46] will i forsake you
[1:04:48] he's always there to keep us away
[1:04:51] from deception now brother branham had
[1:04:53] actually had
[1:04:55] some uh supernatural events happening in
[1:04:58] his life that he fully didn't understand
[1:05:00] all of a sudden he gradually moved into
[1:05:03] the revelation
[1:05:04] of who he was and what he had come to do
[1:05:07] and the prophet god said uh you know
[1:05:09] whatever it takes i am going to make
[1:05:11] that happen i am going to see
[1:05:13] that my purpose is fulfilled he tells us
[1:05:17] of a time that him when he was in
[1:05:19] slovenia canyon
[1:05:20] and he said while god called me up early
[1:05:23] in the morning
[1:05:24] up there i was up with my hands in the
[1:05:26] air
[1:05:27] praying and a sword came to my hands
[1:05:30] you know that i stood there and looked
[1:05:32] at it
[1:05:34] just natural as my hand is now
[1:05:37] not knowing what it meant and it was
[1:05:40] left
[1:05:41] in it and it was left me with a voice
[1:05:43] that said
[1:05:45] this is the king the sword of the king
[1:05:49] and then later when the angel of the
[1:05:51] lord revealed it
[1:05:52] it was the word in my hand hallelujah
[1:05:56] so if you can tie this particular quote
[1:05:59] into the very scripture
[1:06:01] when john went and took the book
[1:06:05] out of the lamb's hand then you can
[1:06:08] understand that there was a
[1:06:10] a transferring of authority
[1:06:14] all right and the the transfer of the
[1:06:17] authority
[1:06:18] didn't stop with william branham but the
[1:06:20] bride of jesus christ
[1:06:22] is told also to eat this book
[1:06:25] and and and make it part of you
[1:06:29] in other words it's something that you
[1:06:30] must dearly eat it's something that you
[1:06:32] must
[1:06:32] dearly allow to be a part of you because
[1:06:35] in this book there is a transforming
[1:06:38] power
[1:06:39] all right because remember now we're
[1:06:41] we're moving into a place of rapture
[1:06:44] right a changing of the body and the
[1:06:47] word of god is the only thing that can
[1:06:49] change your body
[1:06:50] because the word of god is the
[1:06:52] quickening spirit
[1:06:54] right then the prophet god said
[1:06:56] immediately after that the angels of the
[1:06:57] lord appeared
[1:06:59] and told about the seven trumpets
[1:07:02] or the seven seals that i was returned
[1:07:04] back here to jeffersonville and preach
[1:07:06] the seven seals in there
[1:07:08] and if i ever said anything that was
[1:07:10] inspired it was that
[1:07:12] there were those angels of the lord met
[1:07:14] us and the bible
[1:07:16] becomes a new book there it opened up
[1:07:18] and revealed
[1:07:19] all the things that the reformers and
[1:07:22] things had left
[1:07:23] out it was complete revelation of jesus
[1:07:25] christ
[1:07:26] all together new to us but perfectly
[1:07:29] exactly with the scripture that that was
[1:07:32] the
[1:07:32] word which was all always been it was
[1:07:36] known
[1:07:36] it was so inspired and directed
[1:07:39] so he's saying listen i was learning too
[1:07:42] i was experiencing things i had never
[1:07:44] experienced before in my life
[1:07:45] and i came to see that the revelation
[1:07:48] that i was led into
[1:07:49] goes exactly with the scripture it was
[1:07:51] everything the scripture says
[1:07:53] but understand when we come to the seven
[1:07:55] seals and the seven thunders remember i
[1:07:57] read last
[1:07:58] service amen brother branham said it
[1:08:01] could not be something added to
[1:08:05] it had to be there all along because you
[1:08:08] can't add from the book neither can you
[1:08:09] take it
[1:08:10] away from it you'll be cursed so
[1:08:12] whatever the mystery was
[1:08:14] it was in the book but yet hidden in the
[1:08:17] book
[1:08:18] and so we understand by god's grace the
[1:08:21] world
[1:08:22] seen a lot of manifestations
[1:08:24] pentecostals
[1:08:25] they see the shouting the dances
[1:08:26] speaking in tongues but what they don't
[1:08:29] see
[1:08:29] they don't see the reality of life
[1:08:33] right because remember no matter how
[1:08:35] they appear to be righteous
[1:08:38] the pharisees appeared to be righteous
[1:08:40] but they did not have god on the inside
[1:08:43] matter of fact jesus and john
[1:08:46] told them that they were dead men bones
[1:08:48] they appeared to be righteous and holy
[1:08:50] on the outside
[1:08:51] and see that's what we're looking at
[1:08:53] matter of fact when we talk about the
[1:08:55] organizations and and the denominations
[1:08:58] is harsh to say
[1:08:59] it's really it's really a hard thing to
[1:09:01] say but the prophet of god saw them as a
[1:09:03] dead
[1:09:04] corpse and saw the preachers making love
[1:09:08] to a dead corpse now that was that's the
[1:09:12] eyes of god
[1:09:14] and he talked about you know how that
[1:09:16] that when they then
[1:09:17] they're lost is because they never had
[1:09:20] life
[1:09:22] did you hear what i'm saying they never
[1:09:24] had
[1:09:25] life but those that hear my voice
[1:09:29] he said my sheep heareth my voice and a
[1:09:32] stranger
[1:09:33] they will not follow now the word has
[1:09:36] been opened and what is the word open
[1:09:38] for
[1:09:39] it is can i say it like this the word is
[1:09:42] courting you
[1:09:46] hallelujah and you're courting the word
[1:09:48] he you know he knows you but he's
[1:09:51] he's teaching you about himself and when
[1:09:54] i saw that young man in
[1:09:56] in the marriage of this woman he was
[1:09:58] constantly
[1:09:59] whispering in her ears and understand
[1:10:01] the bible says about god
[1:10:03] whispering secrets into us and this is
[1:10:06] what god is doing he's literally giving
[1:10:08] us the secret of himself
[1:10:10] and he and and in so doing he's
[1:10:12] identifying
[1:10:13] who you are
[1:10:18] because the first human adam ever spoke
[1:10:21] to was eve
[1:10:24] amen and the first thing he told her was
[1:10:28] like you've heard me say
[1:10:29] where she came from you came out of me
[1:10:34] bone in my bone flesh of my flesh and
[1:10:36] all of us know this we've
[1:10:37] heard these things but let me tell you
[1:10:39] something don't you ever let this
[1:10:40] message become common to you
[1:10:43] the worst thing people can do once they
[1:10:45] get married is to make them allow their
[1:10:47] marriage to become
[1:10:49] common once it becomes common you begin
[1:10:52] to have
[1:10:53] problems like they say you're supposed
[1:10:56] to always try to keep the honey on the
[1:10:57] moon
[1:10:59] without the honey on the moon you know
[1:11:01] what you got a moon full of craters
[1:11:05] amen so let's move on
[1:11:08] in the spiritual food industry and i'm
[1:11:10] saying these things because i'm trying
[1:11:11] to get to a particular place
[1:11:14] brother barnum says one day turning to
[1:11:16] the right and he's talking about the
[1:11:18] cloud
[1:11:18] and you wonder why i keep going back to
[1:11:20] the cloud because this thing means a lot
[1:11:22] more to me now than it ever had
[1:11:24] since i've been in this message i see
[1:11:26] something that have taken place that i
[1:11:28] didn't see
[1:11:29] happening before and i see something
[1:11:31] amen that god is moving in
[1:11:33] right now and people in the message are
[1:11:35] missing it
[1:11:37] they think it was just an event and they
[1:11:39] don't understand that
[1:11:41] brother branham constantly kept telling
[1:11:43] us god
[1:11:44] interprets his own word
[1:11:47] hallelujah understand when the seven
[1:11:50] thunders uttered their voices
[1:11:52] the bible had already declared time will
[1:11:55] be no more
[1:11:56] so basically we're at the end of things
[1:11:59] we're at the end of things god
[1:12:00] is interpreting his coming to us we can
[1:12:04] accept it
[1:12:04] or we can refuse it but the bible said
[1:12:07] he will appear to those
[1:12:08] who love his appearing in other words
[1:12:12] you'll get a revelation
[1:12:13] of what this is all about hallelujah
[1:12:17] the word that comes how many people in
[1:12:19] them in denomination organization know
[1:12:22] about what happened in 1963
[1:12:25] matter of fact people who were in the
[1:12:26] message have now downed it and cast it
[1:12:28] away
[1:12:29] not knowing that they have sealed their
[1:12:31] destiny
[1:12:33] and you and i we we've got something
[1:12:35] here and what we need to do is
[1:12:36] really focus on what he's saying to us
[1:12:40] is that right because this message if
[1:12:42] it's not changing you
[1:12:44] something is wrong hallelujah
[1:12:47] the message comes to change you
[1:12:51] right when god told abraham you're going
[1:12:53] to have a baby
[1:12:54] sarah laughed at it hallelujah but it
[1:12:57] could not
[1:12:58] stop god from doing what he said he had
[1:13:00] already pronounced it
[1:13:02] and the word of god cannot come back
[1:13:04] void god said i'm going to have a bribe
[1:13:07] without spot wrinkle or blemish
[1:13:09] it's already out there it cannot come
[1:13:12] back void
[1:13:13] but what we must find out how
[1:13:16] and how god will do this thing
[1:13:19] hallelujah now now watch the promise to
[1:13:22] abraham and sarah
[1:13:24] they had they didn't have to do anything
[1:13:29] for the change to come other than to
[1:13:32] believe
[1:13:33] that the change was coming
[1:13:37] y'all understand me abraham and sarah
[1:13:39] remain the same
[1:13:41] but they had an unconditional covenant
[1:13:47] see this this is not something god wants
[1:13:50] you to be
[1:13:50] uh uh uh ringing your hands with and
[1:13:54] and getting all scared and nervous and
[1:13:56] and you're thinking making you think oh
[1:13:57] how i'm gonna do it well
[1:13:59] let me tell you something to help you
[1:14:01] tonight there is nothing you can do to
[1:14:03] do it
[1:14:05] you can't do it that's why he had to
[1:14:07] come himself
[1:14:09] hallelujah he is the transformer is that
[1:14:12] right when he was at
[1:14:14] lazarus grave amen he told his uh he
[1:14:17] told
[1:14:18] uh mary and martha i am the resurrection
[1:14:23] i am y'all understand me he said i am
[1:14:26] the resurrection
[1:14:27] and that was before pentecost
[1:14:31] but because of election and because of
[1:14:33] the predestinated seed
[1:14:35] and because god had already in his mind
[1:14:38] thought to raise lazarus from the dead
[1:14:40] there was no way nothing could stop
[1:14:42] lazarus from being raised from the dead
[1:14:45] if he had laid in the tomb 14 days
[1:14:49] it still would not have stopped lazarus
[1:14:51] from coming
[1:14:52] to life once the voice was spoken
[1:14:55] y'all understand me and last week was un
[1:14:58] under under
[1:14:59] uh you say the the lambs and the goats
[1:15:02] and now
[1:15:02] the law that's where he was now if the
[1:15:05] law
[1:15:06] under the law jesus who is grace and
[1:15:08] truth can
[1:15:09] raise you from the dead what about being
[1:15:11] under grace and truth
[1:15:14] this should be this is supposed to be a
[1:15:16] time of triumph
[1:15:18] this is supposed to be a time where you
[1:15:20] can shout the victory
[1:15:22] because you know by god's grace you got
[1:15:24] the victory
[1:15:25] you when you get the victory you don't
[1:15:27] have to feel it hallelujah
[1:15:29] victory is victory but you ought to
[1:15:32] rejoice because you have the victory
[1:15:34] because god has promised you the victory
[1:15:37] hallelujah it's what god is doing
[1:15:40] behold the bridegroom coming how many
[1:15:42] people know that
[1:15:44] how many people can see that see when he
[1:15:47] when he actually put his face in the
[1:15:50] cloud
[1:15:51] in 1963 that was only for a special
[1:15:54] group of people
[1:15:56] it was not for the world they couldn't
[1:15:58] see it they wouldn't believe it
[1:16:00] this is his time out for fighting it's
[1:16:03] time out for
[1:16:04] uh striving with one another that's
[1:16:06] nonsense
[1:16:08] it's not based upon how much knowledge
[1:16:10] you have of the message
[1:16:11] it's whether you've got the seed of god
[1:16:13] in you
[1:16:15] that's it paul said you can understand
[1:16:18] all mysteries and have not love
[1:16:23] it profits you nothing that's what god
[1:16:26] wants us to have
[1:16:27] this message is come to to develop
[1:16:30] and mature divine love in you
[1:16:34] you say well brother listen god is a god
[1:16:36] of contrast
[1:16:38] is that right and guess what he puts you
[1:16:41] and
[1:16:41] i in the most evil age ever
[1:16:45] this is satan's eden and god says
[1:16:49] i want to see some divine love
[1:16:52] [Laughter]
[1:16:54] the darkest of any time of every time i
[1:16:57] want to see some divine love
[1:16:59] oh lord i got to have divine love oh
[1:17:02] lord i gotta divine love
[1:17:04] oh you know how we do it you know
[1:17:08] you do a little some nice deed and and
[1:17:10] something in the back your mind is not
[1:17:11] agreeing with your deed
[1:17:14] that's not divine love man he asked me
[1:17:18] for my last dime
[1:17:22] divine love don't care about that being
[1:17:24] the last dime here you go
[1:17:27] is that right just to exemplify brother
[1:17:30] said he saw a man with no shoes he went
[1:17:33] up to the man to measure his shoes
[1:17:36] to see if the man could fit his shoes he
[1:17:38] was going to give the man his shoes
[1:17:42] never thought anything about like i
[1:17:43] don't have another pair
[1:17:47] huh but we would think oh my god this is
[1:17:49] all i got
[1:17:54] but divine love don't think about stuff
[1:17:56] like that hallelujah
[1:17:59] because once you give away good measures
[1:18:02] pressed down
[1:18:04] shaking it's going to come running back
[1:18:06] to you god don't
[1:18:07] how many of y'all know that's the truth
[1:18:09] you give somebody something in
[1:18:11] love and all of a sudden it comes back
[1:18:13] to you and sometimes
[1:18:14] twice as much it always happened that's
[1:18:17] the laws of god
[1:18:19] but let me move on by the grace of god
[1:18:21] talk about divine love
[1:18:22] i'm talking about something that i have
[1:18:24] fret about i fretted about it because
[1:18:26] i'm thinking to myself oh god how in the
[1:18:28] world i'm going to produce
[1:18:29] divine love with all these distractions
[1:18:35] all this stuff about me you know you
[1:18:38] took my distraction plus you got to deal
[1:18:40] with yourself
[1:18:43] except the lord builds the house
[1:18:46] the laborers labor in vain
[1:18:50] god is the builder not you and so you
[1:18:53] and i must
[1:18:54] understand what we must do lord you know
[1:18:56] what i need
[1:18:57] see prayer is essential in this hour
[1:19:01] y'all hear what i'm saying prayer is
[1:19:03] essential you don't have to feel nothing
[1:19:06] don't let the devil trick you he might
[1:19:08] take away the anointing you may not feel
[1:19:10] it but you got to recognize one thing
[1:19:12] god said i'll never leave you
[1:19:13] nor will i forsake you he didn't say oh
[1:19:16] when you feel me to be there i'll be
[1:19:17] there
[1:19:18] no he said i'll never do y'all believe
[1:19:20] that word that's the word
[1:19:23] it has nothing to do with your feelings
[1:19:26] hallelujah glory to god he said one day
[1:19:30] he said talk about the cloud and i'm
[1:19:31] going
[1:19:31] back this because i really want he says
[1:19:33] listen
[1:19:34] he said there was jesus christ just as
[1:19:37] perfect as the hoffman
[1:19:38] ever drawed him he was standing there
[1:19:40] with a white wig on looking back down
[1:19:43] toward the earth
[1:19:44] showing that he is supreme authority the
[1:19:47] heavens declared it
[1:19:48] the bible's declared the message
[1:19:50] declared all the same supreme authority
[1:19:52] with the white wig on
[1:19:54] you see his black beard under many of
[1:19:56] you
[1:19:58] have seen the picture we got it back
[1:19:59] there just turn
[1:20:01] it to the right sideways look at it
[1:20:04] there he is just as perfect as he was it
[1:20:07] was
[1:20:07] it has uh has been uh photographed of
[1:20:10] him
[1:20:11] they they're looking at it from the
[1:20:13] wrong angle
[1:20:14] you've got to turn it in the right angle
[1:20:17] and only the lord god
[1:20:19] can reveal which it is the right angle
[1:20:22] you turn it to your right and look at it
[1:20:25] hallelujah
[1:20:26] now you think about it why was it
[1:20:28] important for god to show
[1:20:30] what that was he could have let it go on
[1:20:32] they could have seen oh he kept
[1:20:33] calling the seven angels he you know the
[1:20:36] and and different one the
[1:20:37] angels of the lord he you know he he
[1:20:39] named it everything
[1:20:40] then all of a sudden boo right
[1:20:44] he saw it was more than that how
[1:20:47] i mean it's amazing how you know so much
[1:20:49] can be in one picture
[1:20:52] hallelujah but you see he's everything
[1:20:55] he was the seven angels yes sir
[1:20:58] hallelujah he was the angels of the lord
[1:21:00] it was god in morphe
[1:21:03] hallelujah and you see when you begin to
[1:21:06] see that he's supreme authority
[1:21:08] hallelujah it makes something happen
[1:21:10] because i want you to understand who
[1:21:12] you're marrying
[1:21:14] i want you to think about this just for
[1:21:16] a moment
[1:21:17] who you're marrying who you're becoming
[1:21:20] part of
[1:21:22] who you are uniting with
[1:21:25] not somebody in the trinity some second
[1:21:27] person or third person
[1:21:29] recognize who god god has chosen you
[1:21:35] yeah whoo i almost fell apart just a
[1:21:38] moment i pulled it back
[1:21:40] my point is this when you realize amen
[1:21:42] that you
[1:21:43] are part of this whole thing and it has
[1:21:46] been
[1:21:46] all about you the whole bible
[1:21:50] has been about you that's why they call
[1:21:53] this book the book of redemption amen
[1:21:56] hallelujah he fell god knew that the
[1:21:59] flesh that we would
[1:22:00] would be clothed in would fall he
[1:22:03] ordained it so it could fall
[1:22:05] because he wanted to love you
[1:22:08] and you know he got to the place where
[1:22:10] he he put laws and rules on
[1:22:12] us to show us that that flesh that you
[1:22:15] got was going to betray you all
[1:22:17] every time you can't have confidence in
[1:22:19] the flesh
[1:22:20] hallelujah it's going to fail you if you
[1:22:23] think you're
[1:22:24] because i'm strong you're not strong and
[1:22:27] any man in their right mind know you
[1:22:29] can't live holy without the holy ghost
[1:22:32] and anyway so he shows you how many
[1:22:34] times he says a just man falls seven
[1:22:36] times in a day and he gets up
[1:22:39] hallelujah david said i'm gonna tell you
[1:22:41] something i've been into a lot of
[1:22:42] situations
[1:22:43] one time i was in a horrible pit but he
[1:22:46] came and he lifted me up out that pit
[1:22:48] placed my feet on a rock see that's how
[1:22:51] it is he'll allow you to even fall into
[1:22:53] a pit and he'll still pick you up
[1:22:55] because of who you
[1:22:55] are and what you mean to him
[1:22:59] god have mercy on us see the word
[1:23:02] prepares his bride
[1:23:03] god prepares his bride and you and i
[1:23:06] come here and we think oh my god i can't
[1:23:08] i don't know you know you think to
[1:23:10] yourself i can see the times
[1:23:12] times are happening things are happening
[1:23:13] i don't know when he's coming
[1:23:15] he's already come he hears he's a hero
[1:23:18] he's
[1:23:19] among us he's supernatural
[1:23:22] he's in spirit we call him the holy
[1:23:25] ghost
[1:23:27] right he's here but he wants us to make
[1:23:30] love to him
[1:23:31] he wants us that intimacy he wants that
[1:23:33] fellowship that's why he said walk in
[1:23:35] the spirit talk in the spirit pray in
[1:23:37] the spirit
[1:23:38] sing in the spirit whatever you do
[1:23:39] spirit spirit spirit
[1:23:41] in that day you'll know that i'm in the
[1:23:43] father the fathers at me and i am in you
[1:23:46] and
[1:23:50] let me get there
[1:23:54] because i don't want anybody to think
[1:23:55] i'm dismissing that we'll meet him in
[1:23:57] the air
[1:23:58] but i want you to understand he he if
[1:24:01] you can get what i'm saying
[1:24:04] he interprets his own word
[1:24:07] you got to go with his interpretation
[1:24:08] and not with what you've been thinking
[1:24:10] in the past
[1:24:12] you can't deny that he came in 1963
[1:24:16] because the bible declared that he did
[1:24:19] but the prophet said we will see him
[1:24:22] right and remember because i'm not going
[1:24:24] to be long but let me say it like this
[1:24:26] remember one of the things that that
[1:24:28] happened in egypt
[1:24:30] joseph and joseph when joseph began to
[1:24:32] make himself known to his brethren
[1:24:35] and you know who his brothers is
[1:24:37] benjamin and and the others
[1:24:39] israel and we know that what happened in
[1:24:42] world war one
[1:24:43] and world war ii and how god in world
[1:24:45] war ii brought the jews back to their
[1:24:47] homeland
[1:24:48] and that was god the great jehovah
[1:24:51] bringing them back on eagle's wing
[1:24:52] prophecy being fulfilled
[1:24:55] now we see the jews are in their land
[1:24:57] most of them anyhow
[1:24:58] but a jew ain't a real jew till they go
[1:25:00] home
[1:25:02] and so when those who those orthodox
[1:25:04] jews that's dead
[1:25:05] and constantly praying and doing what
[1:25:07] they need to do before god
[1:25:08] those are the one god is coming back for
[1:25:12] but if you understand brother barnum
[1:25:13] said when that sixth seal was open
[1:25:16] he said that sixth seal also was open
[1:25:19] and and like like like how can i say it
[1:25:22] the seventh seal was open under the six
[1:25:24] but that seventh seal could not be
[1:25:26] opened until brother branham came
[1:25:29] right that was god's seventh angel
[1:25:30] messenger right but all of the one two
[1:25:33] three four five
[1:25:34] six were open is that right otherwise we
[1:25:36] would not have known the fifth seal we
[1:25:38] would have known the fourth we wouldn't
[1:25:39] have known the others
[1:25:40] but those seals had already happened it
[1:25:42] was history to us
[1:25:44] and then with the prophet of god god
[1:25:46] used him to go back into history
[1:25:48] and showed us what happened through all
[1:25:49] those seals and showed us how they
[1:25:51] overlapped one another
[1:25:52] now there was a time he said i wanted to
[1:25:54] preach the trumpets then brother
[1:25:56] god show brother branham you've already
[1:25:58] preached the trumpets
[1:25:59] because the seven seals to us is the
[1:26:01] seven trumpets to the jews
[1:26:04] so in is saying all of that so when the
[1:26:07] six seals were open
[1:26:08] don't you know over there those jews was
[1:26:11] being there was a manifestation going on
[1:26:13] with them and we don't know what it is
[1:26:15] we weren't there we don't understand it
[1:26:17] but he also
[1:26:18] said just like the seventh seal was
[1:26:21] released
[1:26:22] he said the seven trumpets would have to
[1:26:24] be released too
[1:26:26] so therefore whoever he is moses and
[1:26:28] elijah
[1:26:29] we don't know who they are we don't know
[1:26:30] what's happening there but we do know
[1:26:32] that at some point in time they will
[1:26:34] appear
[1:26:35] now we know this that if they appear
[1:26:38] while you're here
[1:26:40] you miss the rapture right
[1:26:44] because you and i must understand that
[1:26:46] in between the sixth and the seventh
[1:26:48] we the bride is supposed to get out of
[1:26:50] here
[1:26:52] right so this is a mystery that god
[1:26:54] heared he's now
[1:26:56] uh uh uh how i say uh uh loving on you
[1:26:59] loving on us
[1:27:00] trying to get us to see the revelation
[1:27:02] that who we are i'm not talking about
[1:27:04] your flesh
[1:27:05] i'm talking about this inside that you
[1:27:07] that man you that's inside
[1:27:09] is what god is working with right trauma
[1:27:13] is trying to tell you
[1:27:14] that everybody don't get this brother
[1:27:17] brown said a special
[1:27:18] class of people a chosen people and
[1:27:20] elected people
[1:27:21] are predestinated people right and the
[1:27:24] thing about it is you do not have to be
[1:27:26] some great intellectual
[1:27:29] all you have to do is have faith in what
[1:27:30] has been said
[1:27:32] right and god what does god say about
[1:27:36] abraham
[1:27:36] abraham staggered not
[1:27:41] and if you be abraham you stagger not at
[1:27:43] the promises of god
[1:27:44] you don't know how it's going to happen
[1:27:47] and really it ain't your business
[1:27:49] it's about god and what god chooses to
[1:27:51] do
[1:27:52] so anyway he says now listen we meet
[1:27:55] jesus in the air
[1:27:56] before we go home get home that's right
[1:27:59] second thessalonians tells us that
[1:28:01] for we meet him in the air and a
[1:28:02] beautiful type of rebecca meeting isaac
[1:28:05] in the field in the cool of the day we
[1:28:07] meet him in the air second thessalonians
[1:28:09] tell us so
[1:28:10] for we which are alive and remain shall
[1:28:13] not prevent
[1:28:14] or hinder those which are asleep and i'm
[1:28:17] saying something i saw something and i
[1:28:19] hope i can get a chance to read it
[1:28:20] where brother branham said now after
[1:28:22] this word will one day materialize
[1:28:24] itself it will materialize so you got to
[1:28:28] eat
[1:28:29] you got to eat the word and he said
[1:28:32] one day you'll get so to a place where
[1:28:34] it will materialize
[1:28:36] jesus right in front of you this is an
[1:28:39] individual thing
[1:28:43] everybody might see the cloud but when
[1:28:45] it comes to his return
[1:28:47] it will be an individual thing
[1:28:51] he will materialize himself in you once
[1:28:54] you become
[1:28:55] where he desires you to be and who's
[1:28:58] bringing you that
[1:28:59] who's bringing you to that his word
[1:29:02] that's why he gave it to us he gave us
[1:29:04] this word
[1:29:04] so we can have a transformation
[1:29:08] listen abraham and uh abraham and
[1:29:11] rebecca did not walk around with a book
[1:29:13] in their hand
[1:29:14] they just believed god you understand me
[1:29:18] and brother brown said that god suddenly
[1:29:21] changed them
[1:29:24] from old to young hello
[1:29:30] because you got to understand this is
[1:29:31] god's warfare
[1:29:33] he's not going to tell you everything he
[1:29:36] didn't tell the prophet everything
[1:29:39] and when he gets ready to do something
[1:29:40] he's going to do it
[1:29:42] right if you've got a dead loved one
[1:29:46] the prophet god ain't going to say hey
[1:29:48] you know
[1:29:49] susie's coming by your house this
[1:29:51] morning
[1:29:53] no she gonna come and you're gonna see
[1:29:55] it
[1:29:56] right that's what's gonna happen so
[1:29:59] anyway
[1:29:59] we look at these things and we say oh
[1:30:01] brother brooks uh there's something
[1:30:02] wrong knows nothing wrong with me
[1:30:04] you know i look at these things and i
[1:30:05] say to myself you know
[1:30:08] when we begin to really look at this
[1:30:09] world seriously
[1:30:12] we'll begin to see that there it brings
[1:30:14] change
[1:30:15] now i don't know about you there's a
[1:30:17] change happening in me
[1:30:19] and i know it's happening because the
[1:30:20] things that's changing is things that i
[1:30:22] could not have changed
[1:30:23] on my own and we he goes on and says
[1:30:27] listen
[1:30:28] for we which are alive and remain shall
[1:30:29] not prevent or hinder those which
[1:30:32] are asleep for the trumpet of god shall
[1:30:34] sound the dead in christ shall
[1:30:36] rise first we which are alive and remain
[1:30:39] shall be caught up together with them to
[1:30:41] meet the lord in the air
[1:30:43] perfect all these types
[1:30:46] you guys can smile tonight and you can
[1:30:48] say amen if you like it
[1:30:50] therefore the theophany if you have died
[1:30:53] and entered into theophany what happens
[1:30:55] that theophany comes to the earth to
[1:30:57] pick up the redeemed body
[1:30:59] and if you heal on in the air you take
[1:31:01] the body to meet the theophany
[1:31:03] there you are and caught up and go to
[1:31:06] meet the lord in the air
[1:31:07] he said who is this mechadeck but god
[1:31:10] now we see here plainly the complete
[1:31:13] secret of our lives in journey
[1:31:15] and death and where we go after we die
[1:31:18] also predestination
[1:31:20] is in plain view here now listen as we
[1:31:23] teach this
[1:31:23] closely the stages of eternal purpose
[1:31:27] he had his secret has now been
[1:31:30] revealed notice there is still stages to
[1:31:34] to perfection now i'ma stop right there
[1:31:37] he said his secret has been revealed
[1:31:39] and what is his secret he comes back to
[1:31:42] return he comes back for his bride
[1:31:45] hallelujah but he knows he can't bring
[1:31:48] her where he's going
[1:31:50] in the condition she's in so he knows
[1:31:52] that there's got to be a change
[1:31:54] it has to be a change now you know you
[1:31:56] can't think that you're going to just
[1:31:58] you know you go god going to catch you
[1:32:00] in a bar room and rapture you
[1:32:02] it ain't happening right so
[1:32:05] the power of the word must be active in
[1:32:08] your life
[1:32:09] it can't be something just in your head
[1:32:11] it has to be active in your life
[1:32:13] literally changing you from glory to
[1:32:15] glory
[1:32:17] right and that change will continue
[1:32:20] watch as the days go on
[1:32:21] it's literally going to speak uh speed
[1:32:24] up
[1:32:25] and the reason why it's going to speed
[1:32:26] up is because we're going to have
[1:32:28] pressure
[1:32:29] he's going to help us speed up
[1:32:33] right because the squeeze is coming the
[1:32:36] pressure is coming
[1:32:38] and it will help us speed up
[1:32:42] right now we're not like the
[1:32:44] organizations and denominations
[1:32:45] they think that they will be secured in
[1:32:47] their churches
[1:32:48] that's what israel said well you don't
[1:32:50] hear his titus let us go back to
[1:32:52] jerusalem
[1:32:52] let's run into the temple and they
[1:32:55] missed the message of the hour
[1:32:57] jesus said to his disciples when you see
[1:33:00] the the city encamped about with
[1:33:02] with the armies don't go back to your
[1:33:04] house if you're in the field
[1:33:06] stay out there if you're on the mountain
[1:33:07] stay out there never go
[1:33:09] back in and they did right
[1:33:13] and it got so bad the prophet god said
[1:33:15] they were eating their own children
[1:33:18] hello i'm gonna tell y'all something you
[1:33:20] think america is exempt from that
[1:33:23] they know i mean they might be doing
[1:33:25] that kind of stuff now
[1:33:27] this is an evil wicked wicked wicked
[1:33:31] and whatever the devil can get them to
[1:33:33] do he's going to get them to do it
[1:33:36] and a lot of us we don't even think
[1:33:37] about those things and maybe i'm just
[1:33:39] out of my mind
[1:33:40] but what happens to 800 000 children
[1:33:43] that disappear every year
[1:33:46] you know it's something to that but my
[1:33:49] point is this
[1:33:50] they have all kinds of movies zombies
[1:33:52] and all that i don't watch that nonsense
[1:33:54] but my point is this
[1:33:58] they're introducing people into eating
[1:34:02] flesh
[1:34:06] hmm this civilized uh a world
[1:34:10] is now being introduced not you know it
[1:34:13] wasn't
[1:34:13] not enough to just kill each other but
[1:34:16] now they're killing and eating
[1:34:18] now i'm gonna move on because that
[1:34:20] sounds pretty rough
[1:34:21] but my point is folks i just don't trust
[1:34:23] folks
[1:34:26] i don't i don't
[1:34:29] now we see here plainly the complete
[1:34:31] secret of our lives and our journey and
[1:34:32] our death
[1:34:33] and where we go after we die also
[1:34:35] predestination is in plain view here
[1:34:38] now listen as we teach this closely
[1:34:41] maybe y'all don't know but my wife says
[1:34:43] well i'll come back on the bus i said oh
[1:34:45] no you're not coming back on the bus if
[1:34:47] you come back home
[1:34:48] i'll come back and get you if i got a
[1:34:49] i've got a uh you know
[1:34:51] yeah if i got to rent a car y'all forgot
[1:34:54] just a few years ago the man would sleep
[1:34:57] over there in canada at the bus stop
[1:34:59] this man was on something not only did
[1:35:02] he kill the man but he started eating
[1:35:03] the man right on the bus
[1:35:06] this is this is facts man would sleep
[1:35:08] down in
[1:35:09] uh down there in in florida a homeless
[1:35:12] man
[1:35:13] and some man come up and start
[1:35:16] eating all his flesh real people
[1:35:19] it's a reality and when you see things
[1:35:21] like that it's like a like drops of rain
[1:35:23] before the storm
[1:35:25] you do not want to be here if the
[1:35:28] rapture should take place that's why
[1:35:30] people are going to try to kill
[1:35:31] themselves
[1:35:32] and death is going to flee from them
[1:35:35] right let me say it like this if you
[1:35:38] have ever seen
[1:35:40] movies or videos of the holocaust
[1:35:44] and what those germans and everybody
[1:35:46] else did to the jews
[1:35:48] i want you to understand those the same
[1:35:50] demons
[1:35:53] the same demons that's loosed
[1:35:56] y'all understand me that's going to
[1:35:58] torment everybody that misses the
[1:36:00] rapture
[1:36:02] and whatever they did to the jews will
[1:36:04] be like child play
[1:36:06] compared to what they're going to do
[1:36:09] with those who are
[1:36:10] left behind and that's what people don't
[1:36:13] understand
[1:36:14] folks in the message que sera sarah
[1:36:16] whatever would be will be
[1:36:18] if i am if i am predestinated then he's
[1:36:21] going to do it wrong attitude
[1:36:23] wrong you'll miss it a hundred miles uh
[1:36:26] more than that
[1:36:27] if that's your attitude
[1:36:32] to him that knowing that too good and
[1:36:34] doeth not to him is sin
[1:36:37] now we see his plane is the complete
[1:36:39] secret of our journey
[1:36:40] right the stage of eternal purpose he
[1:36:43] had in the secret has now been revealed
[1:36:45] notice
[1:36:46] there is still three stages to
[1:36:48] perfection just like he redeemed the
[1:36:50] world
[1:36:51] same way he redeemed his church he
[1:36:53] redeemed the people three stages now
[1:36:55] look
[1:36:55] first is justification like luther
[1:36:57] preach second
[1:37:00] wesley sanctification right wesley third
[1:37:03] is the baptism of the holy ghost then
[1:37:05] comes the rapture
[1:37:07] right but you see what happened is in
[1:37:10] the pentecostal age
[1:37:12] they they redefined the baptism of the
[1:37:16] holy ghost
[1:37:17] and gave it a false description or
[1:37:19] definition
[1:37:22] everybody thought that they received
[1:37:24] they were receiving the holy ghost
[1:37:25] because they were speaking in tongues
[1:37:27] and the pentecostals became blind
[1:37:31] when they made the evidence of speaking
[1:37:33] in tongues the holy ghost
[1:37:35] and you know what they did they opened
[1:37:37] the door for devils
[1:37:39] because devils amen speak in tongues
[1:37:42] so they were able to filtrate the
[1:37:45] pentecostal world
[1:37:46] by doing so hallelujah
[1:37:50] and look at them now right
[1:37:54] but then god brought a prophet who told
[1:37:57] us amen what the holy ghost is given for
[1:38:01] and what it really is and how to know
[1:38:04] when you got it hallelujah you don't
[1:38:07] need nobody to tell you you got the holy
[1:38:09] ghost
[1:38:09] when you get the real holy ghost you
[1:38:11] know that you know that you know
[1:38:14] hallelujah amen and that's what people
[1:38:17] don't understand
[1:38:18] they said well they got it on the day of
[1:38:20] pentecost but you understand they were
[1:38:21] through jesus for three and a half years
[1:38:23] and you know what
[1:38:24] before they could get the holy ghost
[1:38:25] they had to be sanctified because jesus
[1:38:27] sanctified his eye
[1:38:28] i breathe on you and he sanctified him
[1:38:32] through his breath and his word so when
[1:38:34] they got on
[1:38:35] the pentecost they didn't they didn't
[1:38:36] need to clean up they were already
[1:38:38] cleaned up
[1:38:39] right and then the holy ghost don't
[1:38:41] think god's gonna come into you
[1:38:42] and and you still living unclean no it
[1:38:45] ain't gonna happen
[1:38:47] no help us lord jesus
[1:38:51] now the world how did he redeem the
[1:38:53] world the first way
[1:38:54] y'all know how these things so i'm gonna
[1:38:55] go head on now at midnight and how many
[1:38:57] of y'all know we're beyond midnight
[1:39:01] hello hallelujah when brother branham
[1:39:04] came it was midnight
[1:39:07] is that right but then when he preached
[1:39:10] the dawning of a new
[1:39:12] new uh day star right the rising of a
[1:39:15] sun
[1:39:16] amen he he began to tell us the
[1:39:19] dispensation is
[1:39:20] changing it's no longer midnight
[1:39:25] right it's the dawning of a new day the
[1:39:27] day star the north star that star is
[1:39:29] shining
[1:39:30] but remember before the full day break
[1:39:34] it is darkest before dawn hallelujah
[1:39:38] and then he preaches us and tells us
[1:39:40] there's a man who could turn on the
[1:39:42] light
[1:39:43] what was he telling the bride he was
[1:39:46] telling the bride it's going to get so
[1:39:47] dark
[1:39:47] you are you will be frightened
[1:39:51] fear not little flock it is the father's
[1:39:54] good pleasure
[1:39:54] the pleasure to give you what the
[1:39:56] kingdom
[1:39:58] but he's telling you it's going to get
[1:39:59] so dark
[1:40:01] but don't be afraid there's a man
[1:40:05] who can turn on the light is that right
[1:40:08] the same one who turned it off
[1:40:10] it's the same one who turns it on
[1:40:12] hallelujah
[1:40:14] amen what is it we're coming into the
[1:40:16] very image and likeness of god
[1:40:19] coming into a place we didn't know how
[1:40:21] adam was did we
[1:40:23] but we saw jesus and we didn't know how
[1:40:26] we would be what we saw a prophet
[1:40:29] william branham
[1:40:30] you understand me the dark ages had to
[1:40:32] be
[1:40:33] from from all the way from paul's or
[1:40:36] ephesus age
[1:40:37] all the way up to our age you see it had
[1:40:40] to be dark
[1:40:40] there was real no real vision everything
[1:40:43] had been eaten away by the palmer worm
[1:40:45] the cake worm the locust and the
[1:40:46] caterpillar
[1:40:47] and the word could not be restored until
[1:40:49] god sent the prophet
[1:40:53] y'all see what i'm saying y'all
[1:40:54] understand what i'm saying had not god
[1:40:56] sent him
[1:40:58] we would be in darkness to this day
[1:41:01] because god had already ordained his
[1:41:03] system
[1:41:04] according to amos 3 7 god will do
[1:41:07] nothing except he revealed it to his
[1:41:09] servant as a prophet
[1:41:10] so we needed him and when people when
[1:41:13] people reject
[1:41:14] the messenger they literally willfully
[1:41:17] places themselves back into darkness
[1:41:21] they love darkness that's right the
[1:41:23] bible said evil men love
[1:41:25] darkness more than light coming into
[1:41:28] that image
[1:41:29] you and i can't even fathom it brother i
[1:41:31] can't but i believe it
[1:41:33] i can't imagine amen being just like
[1:41:36] jesus
[1:41:38] in every respect but i believe it i know
[1:41:41] it's possible
[1:41:42] because god says so right
[1:41:45] going on you say well what do you mean
[1:41:48] you're wondering why man is
[1:41:49] is it the way he is because god made him
[1:41:52] that way
[1:41:53] brother said now when when when when he
[1:41:55] made man in the beginning
[1:41:56] he made him superior to anything on
[1:41:59] earth
[1:42:00] he gave him jurisdiction over everything
[1:42:02] on earth
[1:42:03] to control everything he controlled the
[1:42:06] animal life
[1:42:07] he controlled the fowl life the fish of
[1:42:09] the sea he controlled the wind
[1:42:11] he controlled the plant life he
[1:42:13] controlled everything
[1:42:14] man was made a secondary god on earth he
[1:42:17] was given the power to control
[1:42:19] all things all elements on earth that
[1:42:22] was adam
[1:42:23] adam was given these great powers but
[1:42:26] then
[1:42:26] the power that he was given to to make
[1:42:30] himself
[1:42:30] is where he fell so what are you saying
[1:42:33] now
[1:42:34] here it is the seals are open we didn't
[1:42:36] know you know
[1:42:37] i don't know about y'all but i came
[1:42:38] through the domination of churches and
[1:42:40] you know
[1:42:41] you always just hope that god will save
[1:42:43] you
[1:42:45] you know because everything was working
[1:42:47] with law you know what i mean
[1:42:49] if you messed up you was really
[1:42:50] condemned right
[1:42:54] and god came in his last day and said
[1:42:56] that is not how it works
[1:43:00] your covenant is not law your covenant
[1:43:02] is grace
[1:43:03] you got to believe this now you can't
[1:43:06] you can't you can't make heaven
[1:43:08] without believing this because satan
[1:43:10] gonna make you make mistakes
[1:43:11] he'll gonna trip you at times but you
[1:43:14] got to understand with all that tripping
[1:43:16] he
[1:43:16] he he do to you you're still perfect
[1:43:19] he's not the man who's judging you god
[1:43:22] is judging you perfect
[1:43:25] as long as the holy ghost is in you god
[1:43:27] has judged you perfect
[1:43:30] are you ready for heaven right now
[1:43:32] hallelujah
[1:43:34] see and you got to understand amen so
[1:43:36] god we understand that adam could speak
[1:43:38] to the winds and it would stop
[1:43:40] he could speak to the trees and they
[1:43:41] would obey him he could speak to the
[1:43:43] wildlife and it would obey him
[1:43:45] he could speak to the waters if ever
[1:43:47] what he was
[1:43:48] everything obeyed him now you think
[1:43:51] brother man if you think god just got
[1:43:53] this
[1:43:53] in here huh what do you think is in here
[1:43:56] for
[1:44:00] you think god just put it in here
[1:44:06] well i'll just give them this something
[1:44:07] to make them feel good
[1:44:10] fundamental faith the fundamental
[1:44:13] foundation faith
[1:44:14] perfect this is what he put that in
[1:44:16] there so you can know
[1:44:17] when the squeeze comes if you're in the
[1:44:20] image and likeness of god
[1:44:22] everything is at your disposal
[1:44:26] we don't care about the electronics we
[1:44:29] don't care if they can say oh i see
[1:44:30] where he's at
[1:44:32] or he can't run his heat the body of his
[1:44:35] heat giving him away
[1:44:37] that has nothing to do with us that's a
[1:44:40] natural thing they working with
[1:44:42] hallelujah but my father was able to
[1:44:45] walk through doors
[1:44:47] y'all understand what i'm saying he was
[1:44:49] able to walk on water
[1:44:51] he was able to translate philip y'all
[1:44:54] understand what i'm saying
[1:44:55] the bible is real it's it's open to it's
[1:44:58] no longer a history book
[1:45:00] it's a book of instructions it's a book
[1:45:03] that god is trying to get us to see
[1:45:05] and to understand amen what is available
[1:45:08] for you and me
[1:45:10] that's why he has it there now how can
[1:45:13] he
[1:45:13] let this man preach this thing if it
[1:45:15] wasn't for us
[1:45:17] well why you might as well throw mark 16
[1:45:19] out if you're not going to believe this
[1:45:24] this word is real very real hallelujah
[1:45:30] you try it
[1:45:31] ask god you know you you you say
[1:45:34] uh how can i say it all god all the lord
[1:45:38] told
[1:45:39] uh uh in the word says whatsoever you
[1:45:42] say
[1:45:45] [Music]
[1:45:47] do you think you just got to have a
[1:45:48] visitation from the angel every time you
[1:45:50] come to a conflict
[1:45:54] one day one day my little boy isaiah
[1:45:56] like that he was just little
[1:45:58] and uh he was going in the back into the
[1:46:00] in the refrigerator that says no
[1:46:02] don't you go in that refrigerator and he
[1:46:04] said daddy why can't i go in the
[1:46:06] refrigerator you go in there
[1:46:12] from that day on he was able to go in
[1:46:13] the refrigerator why because i realized
[1:46:16] he was mature enough to know what he
[1:46:17] wanted inside
[1:46:21] that's what god is looking for he's
[1:46:23] looking for us to mature
[1:46:26] and stop looking at him to do things
[1:46:28] that we supposed to be doing on our own
[1:46:33] if you led by the spirit you are the
[1:46:36] sons of god
[1:46:39] you say well oh brother listen jesus was
[1:46:41] standing right there
[1:46:43] and he rebuked his disciples because
[1:46:45] they did not rebuke the wind
[1:46:48] they did not rebuke the storm what were
[1:46:50] they waiting on he said i've already
[1:46:52] given you power
[1:46:53] i've given you the authority and here
[1:46:55] you allowing the elements of the earth
[1:46:57] to get the best of you
[1:46:59] peace be still and you need to turn
[1:47:01] around and rebuke them
[1:47:03] for having no faith little faith oh ye
[1:47:05] of little faith where did you doubt
[1:47:08] huh they could say oh we was waiting on
[1:47:10] you jesus and jesus said but i was
[1:47:12] waiting on you
[1:47:14] i've given you the authority to do this
[1:47:16] thing why are you doubting it
[1:47:19] bride of jesus christ god has given us
[1:47:21] so much authority
[1:47:22] and yet we're walking around like
[1:47:24] underprivileged children
[1:47:26] you know what that stands for upc
[1:47:33] that's what we're doing and you know
[1:47:36] that's we're beyond that
[1:47:38] this is not a pentecostal message
[1:47:41] this is a message of authority this is
[1:47:43] the real
[1:47:44] tree putting back the real tree putting
[1:47:47] forth another branch
[1:47:50] you either a branch that's coming from
[1:47:51] the real tree or you're a hybrid
[1:47:53] you got to believe i'm from the original
[1:47:55] branch
[1:48:02] that's what god has come to do he's come
[1:48:05] to get us
[1:48:06] that's why i said don't let it be don't
[1:48:07] think it's not robbery to be equal with
[1:48:09] god
[1:48:10] right don't think he you see that's what
[1:48:12] the devil the devil
[1:48:13] we fear for if i take a challenge if i
[1:48:16] take that on
[1:48:17] then then then i'm almost blasphemy and
[1:48:20] i'm trying to make myself god no you're
[1:48:22] not trying to make yourself god
[1:48:24] it's the god in you that's trying to be
[1:48:26] made manifest
[1:48:29] hallelujah i've seen things i've seen
[1:48:32] things i've seen god talk to me
[1:48:34] and say things and i say it and every
[1:48:36] time i think i can't do it that's when
[1:48:38] god wants me to do it
[1:48:44] oh it's true it's true it's true
[1:48:48] what happened you know it talks about
[1:48:52] when when when god went to get rebecca
[1:48:55] she
[1:48:56] she was blood related to isaac
[1:49:03] somebody help me here you said see what
[1:49:06] made you move
[1:49:07] what made you come to this message
[1:49:11] the only thing you could have why do you
[1:49:12] think he put that in there
[1:49:14] he put it in there and he brought out
[1:49:16] the fact that rebecca was related
[1:49:19] to isaac that's why she moved there was
[1:49:22] something pulling her
[1:49:23] the same bloodline that's what got you
[1:49:27] in the message
[1:49:28] why do you doubt it you couldn't even
[1:49:30] hear this except the blood of christ
[1:49:33] was in you somewhere you represent
[1:49:35] christ
[1:49:36] and he represents you you've got there's
[1:49:38] a relationship here
[1:49:42] he could have gotten another woman but
[1:49:45] he says don't go among the canaanites
[1:49:46] don't get none of that
[1:49:48] go over here where your realities are
[1:49:52] all right the blood and the reason why
[1:49:55] we can hear this message
[1:49:56] because that same blood was applied
[1:49:59] before the foundation of the world
[1:50:02] right now is now expressing what god did
[1:50:05] for you back there
[1:50:07] right god's thoughts don't evolve people
[1:50:10] when god's thoughts see you he sees you
[1:50:14] right he don't see oh the eyes the hair
[1:50:16] no all of a sudden we can't explain it
[1:50:19] but god starts to revolve i got a quote
[1:50:21] on that
[1:50:22] when he see you you say well i was just
[1:50:24] a thought but when you as a thought
[1:50:26] you was in your perfection when he saw
[1:50:28] you
[1:50:33] hallelujah he chose you
[1:50:37] and i don't know why we think you know
[1:50:40] we're still acting strange like we chose
[1:50:43] him
[1:50:44] i came to jesus you came to jesus
[1:50:46] because he called you
[1:50:49] you would have never found your way
[1:50:51] right
[1:50:54] unless the father draw you it's christ
[1:50:57] the spirit
[1:50:58] god drawing you drawing us right
[1:51:02] notice god compromise come pro com
[1:51:05] god promised in his word that he would
[1:51:08] choose his bride
[1:51:09] by his original way he chose
[1:51:12] uh his he chose his see the bridegroom
[1:51:16] he he foretold it by the prophets and
[1:51:19] sent a
[1:51:20] prophet to identify it the prophet says
[1:51:22] standing on the bank of
[1:51:24] jordan behold see you're the messiah
[1:51:26] aren't you
[1:51:27] he said no i'm not the messiah you must
[1:51:30] be the
[1:51:30] messiah but i'm not him but he is
[1:51:33] standing
[1:51:34] among you and his shoes i'm not worthy
[1:51:36] to loosen
[1:51:37] when he comes make himself known see and
[1:51:40] today he is standing among us
[1:51:42] in the person of the holy ghost
[1:51:44] manifesting himself
[1:51:46] more and more coming into his church and
[1:51:49] making himself
[1:51:49] known because him and the bride and the
[1:51:52] groom will be the same
[1:51:54] making himself known and one day you'll
[1:51:57] see
[1:51:57] that one you're filled in your heart
[1:52:00] here it is
[1:52:01] see his identification will become
[1:52:05] personalized before you then you
[1:52:08] and he are one
[1:52:14] did somebody take a flash at this
[1:52:16] ceiling flash
[1:52:17] okay i want to make sure it's not it did
[1:52:20] to me the other day and i'm like wow
[1:52:22] is that real or okay so we look at this
[1:52:24] thing and you say well what do you mean
[1:52:26] you've united by the word and the word
[1:52:30] was in the beginning we'll go back to
[1:52:32] the beginning which is god
[1:52:40] that word means meditate on that
[1:52:43] meditate on that get your natural mind
[1:52:46] out of the way
[1:52:47] and meditate on that
[1:52:50] you're a part of god and you go back to
[1:52:52] god
[1:52:54] oh mercy jesus that's too much to even
[1:52:57] my mind about to explode i mean they
[1:52:58] think about it i'm just not saying these
[1:53:00] things
[1:53:00] but when you think about where you're
[1:53:02] going this miserable
[1:53:04] life that you know how much i hate this
[1:53:06] world
[1:53:07] this miserable life your life ain't
[1:53:09] miserable
[1:53:10] mine is as long as i wear this coat
[1:53:15] my life is miserable
[1:53:18] the inside i've got joy but other than
[1:53:21] that
[1:53:21] this old man if i could peel him off i
[1:53:24] would come on folks you all know he'd
[1:53:26] give you trouble
[1:53:29] you can get in the mirror and grooming
[1:53:30] it and still ain't good enough
[1:53:33] right still ain't good enough but that's
[1:53:36] the way it is
[1:53:37] you can't never satisfy the flesh
[1:53:40] because this flesh represents satan
[1:53:44] you're invited to the word you're not
[1:53:47] united by the word
[1:53:48] and the word was in the beginning will
[1:53:50] go back to the beginning
[1:53:51] which is god and that day you'll
[1:53:54] know that i am in the father the father
[1:53:57] in me
[1:53:58] and i and you and you and me
[1:54:01] you got to know that and that's what
[1:54:04] this bible is
[1:54:05] this word is bringing us to to the
[1:54:07] reality that we are not a
[1:54:09] you didn't get here by chance this
[1:54:11] didn't come by some
[1:54:13] fake mistake false no it was pre-planned
[1:54:16] now this is the part you need to see
[1:54:21] you're at the top of the tree
[1:54:26] you're the crooks you the what's that
[1:54:29] what's that uh word i'm trying to look
[1:54:31] for the the the
[1:54:33] the height of it all you said i i uh
[1:54:36] yeah the pinnacle i don't know about
[1:54:38] that well let me say like this
[1:54:40] after all of that battling
[1:54:43] armageddon all kinds of stuff that went
[1:54:47] on
[1:54:48] then then after all that crazy stuff
[1:54:52] is going on i call it crazy but god in
[1:54:54] his own wisdom made it just that way
[1:54:58] john says behold
[1:55:02] the bride the lamb's wife she have made
[1:55:06] herself ready
[1:55:08] and then when she comes down she's
[1:55:10] descending
[1:55:15] and her glory is the glory of god you
[1:55:18] and i don't even know what that means
[1:55:23] it's more than what we call illumination
[1:55:28] it's the very essence of god his glory
[1:55:31] and every stone in the city has a story
[1:55:35] whatever jewel it may be sapphire
[1:55:38] crystal
[1:55:38] diamond whatever there's a story behind
[1:55:41] it where
[1:55:42] somebody got a victory somebody triumph
[1:55:45] over the
[1:55:46] devil right and you'll go through your
[1:55:49] home and your mansion or whatever it is
[1:55:51] and every little piece of it will tell
[1:55:52] your story
[1:55:57] hallelujah testimony throughout eternity
[1:56:00] you know that
[1:56:01] and the thing that i say is this
[1:56:05] when the lord came in the cloud
[1:56:09] not the way the world thought it would
[1:56:10] be but the way he
[1:56:14] manifested himself the way he
[1:56:17] interpreted his own word
[1:56:20] there's a time he will come and the
[1:56:22] bible said all eyes will see him
[1:56:25] but that is not a good time especially
[1:56:29] for
[1:56:29] the non-believer and the make-believer
[1:56:33] but now he's coming to translate us and
[1:56:35] change us
[1:56:37] the thing that i'm looking for i'm
[1:56:39] looking for the change
[1:56:40] i'm expecting to change and i'm
[1:56:43] realizing that
[1:56:44] god is in me
[1:56:47] he put himself in me he accepted me and
[1:56:50] then i accepted him
[1:56:52] his pregnancy came by his own will and
[1:56:55] not mine
[1:56:57] see because brother said jesus christ is
[1:57:00] choosing his own bride
[1:57:01] just the same as excuse me men choose
[1:57:04] their brides today
[1:57:05] and the bride today does not simply
[1:57:07] decide she is going to take a certain
[1:57:09] man for a husband
[1:57:11] no sir it is the groom who decides and
[1:57:14] chooses
[1:57:14] a certain woman for his bride ye have
[1:57:18] not chosen me
[1:57:20] understand that we hear it all the time
[1:57:23] ye have not chosen me
[1:57:25] but i have chosen you
[1:57:28] [Music]
[1:57:30] now according to the word of god the
[1:57:32] bride was chosen from the foundation of
[1:57:34] the world
[1:57:34] this choosing of the bride was purposed
[1:57:37] in himself
[1:57:39] ephesians 1 9 and in romans 9 11 that
[1:57:42] the purpose of god according to election
[1:57:45] might stand
[1:57:49] this is why i want to encourage people
[1:57:51] you may be at home you may be somewhere
[1:57:54] the bible said when you see the day
[1:57:55] approaching
[1:57:57] come together the more now he just
[1:58:01] god is not just telling you that for no
[1:58:03] purpose he can talk to you at his home
[1:58:05] but god
[1:58:06] loves fellowship he loves to see his
[1:58:09] people gather together
[1:58:12] and i marvel at the people that do not
[1:58:15] come to church
[1:58:16] when they can come to church because
[1:58:19] i think and i think within myself they
[1:58:22] don't see the
[1:58:23] hour we're living in there is no
[1:58:26] way you can see that the time is at hand
[1:58:29] and you fail to come to church like i
[1:58:32] don't understand that
[1:58:33] because i'm gonna tell you something it
[1:58:35] doesn't matter if the majority of the
[1:58:37] people don't come
[1:58:38] the bible says where two or three are
[1:58:39] gathered i'm there in the midst
[1:58:41] wherever jesus is i want to be and
[1:58:44] with all of the lockdown that we've been
[1:58:46] having you think people would have been
[1:58:48] flocking
[1:58:51] but nothing has changed with most
[1:58:55] but i want to encourage the people that
[1:58:56] who've been coming
[1:58:58] you've been you've been you've been
[1:58:59] you've been sacrificing don't stop
[1:59:02] this is not a time to quit god is doing
[1:59:04] something whether you see it or not i
[1:59:06] know he is i believe that with all my
[1:59:09] heart because i know what i'm going
[1:59:11] through
[1:59:11] i've been feeling strange very strange
[1:59:13] for several weeks now
[1:59:15] and i can't even explain it
[1:59:19] but i know something's moving
[1:59:22] and i want to be part of it and i
[1:59:23] believe that i am
[1:59:25] you love the lord i'm just going to stop
[1:59:27] right there
[1:59:28] but he's coming behold the bridegroom
[1:59:31] coming
[1:59:32] i'm a little tired in my body but i'm
[1:59:36] okay
[1:59:37] i'm not sick or anything but i want to
[1:59:40] say by god's grace that
[1:59:42] you and i must understand look up for
[1:59:44] your redemption drawers now
[1:59:46] why are you telling us to look up
[1:59:48] because that's where the cloud was
[1:59:50] look up your redemption draws nine
[1:59:53] don't don't let this hour slip away one
[1:59:56] of the worst things can
[1:59:57] possibly happen to any of us is that
[1:59:59] we're left behind
[2:00:01] and i really believe that if the bride
[2:00:02] if you're bride there's a pool in your
[2:00:04] life right now
[2:00:06] there's a pool people it may be a little
[2:00:08] small little thugs but it's there
[2:00:12] it's there and so take advantage of that
[2:00:16] don't let it die keep moving forward in
[2:00:19] jesus name let's stand
[2:00:26] i'm so glad that god shattered my past
[2:00:31] i'm so glad that my past mean nothing to
[2:00:34] him
[2:00:36] that's that's he's not looking at what i
[2:00:38] used to do or even
[2:00:40] what i used to be
[2:00:43] all that's behind and all he's doing now
[2:00:46] is whispering sweet stuff in my ears
[2:00:50] i don't know whether i had this dream
[2:00:54] last night or this morning because i
[2:00:57] talked with a
[2:00:59] brother but
[2:01:03] that was one of the things that inspired
[2:01:05] this message
[2:01:08] and all i know is that we were preparing
[2:01:10] ourselves
[2:01:13] brother paul was in it his daughters
[2:01:15] were in it
[2:01:17] and we were preparing ourselves for this
[2:01:19] wedding
[2:01:20] and i ain't never seen brother propose
[2:01:22] jumping shouting and dancing and he was
[2:01:24] jumping and shouting and dancing
[2:01:26] and so i i did a little something myself
[2:01:30] but my point is this it was something
[2:01:33] grand it was something really great and
[2:01:35] and all i could hear when i woke up was
[2:01:37] behold the bride
[2:01:40] and that's why i got where i got this
[2:01:42] message from
[2:01:43] because i believe that god showed me
[2:01:45] that
[2:01:46] for a particular reason and i i believe
[2:01:50] with all my heart and i can't say it i
[2:01:51] can't make a person believe the bible
[2:01:53] jesus christ can't get you believe
[2:01:54] nobody can
[2:01:56] but i do know that the hour is late and
[2:01:58] i trust that everybody will
[2:02:00] make sure that their lamps have been is
