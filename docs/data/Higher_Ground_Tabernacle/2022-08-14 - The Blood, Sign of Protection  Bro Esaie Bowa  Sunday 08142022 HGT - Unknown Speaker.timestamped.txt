[53:08] ourselves
[53:10] i'm coming to church to better myself
[53:33] [Music]
[54:29] [Applause]
[55:00] first time we ever had a messenger uh to
[55:02] all the churches to his name ever end in
[55:06] h am abraham
[55:09] abraham has seven letters six men
[55:14] but graham is six letters
[55:36] [Applause]
[55:46] it's the first time we ever had uh a
[55:48] messenger uh uh uh but we haven't had a
[55:51] man that his name is is end with uh
[55:54] abraham
[55:57] and abraham has seven letters
[55:59] graham facility
[56:14] if you count the letters in graham
[56:17] you'll find out it's six
[56:19] eight numbers
[56:20] and six is it's a men's number
[56:26] man was created on the sixth day they
[56:28] said early number of the truth but seven
[56:30] is god's number now come over seven and
[56:32] ten do you see now as you heard it
[56:34] still in your second form
[56:36] i just wanted to underline where the
[56:37] problem is
[56:40] that the church is in the mess
[56:55] there is no way to distinguish the world
[56:56] and the
[57:39] devil avocados do said they more with
[57:41] all his demons
[57:51] and all the flesh has corrupted the
[57:53] voice
[57:54] of this last days
[57:56] as in the time of noah
[58:00] o'brien
[58:00] [Applause]
[58:02] so the god is also redoubling the most
[58:05] soft devil and
[58:20] you stand in the way yes in the time of
[58:22] nowhere
[58:25] you turned in a way now let's let's
[58:27] let's let's hear what the bible is
[58:29] saying what happened
[58:31] in genesis chapter 6
[58:34] verse 11 to verse 13.
[58:36] this says see the bible says this
[58:41] the earth also was created before
[58:43] it take place and the earth was filled
[58:46] with violence
[58:48] and god looked
[59:13] and behold i'll destroy them with the
[59:15] earth
[1:00:09] amen
[1:00:11] amen
[1:01:08] because the blood was on that was on the
[1:01:10] cross was only about five liters
[1:01:13] my brother says
[1:01:16] it's it's been 2 000 years
[1:01:20] old
[1:01:22] the christian don't don't don't need uh
[1:01:24] the chemical blood
[1:01:30] we should need the life that was in the
[1:01:32] blood yes
[1:01:35] and your life is coming back
[1:01:50] the chemical blood
[1:02:59] today people went astray from their
[1:03:01] prayers
[1:03:05] they're pretending as if they're not
[1:03:10] their words speaks more louder than
[1:03:12] their words
[1:03:34] it's a high priest uh uh prayer for us
[1:03:37] his people
[1:03:42] jesus was praying and saying bear father
[1:03:46] i gave them your word
[1:03:49] and the word the world hated them
[1:03:54] from the world
[1:03:56] as me
[1:04:23] because there's nothing that's there's
[1:04:25] something that's not around the gun
[1:04:27] because the world is supposed to hate us
[1:04:31] but if we walk with him
[1:04:34] there's something wrong
[1:04:36] he says you didn't say nastiness
[1:04:38] somebody
[1:04:52] but to keep them from evil innocent
[1:04:54] month they're not from this
[1:04:56] in the super demon like i'm not of this
[1:04:58] world
[1:04:59] you say something
[1:05:01] sanctify them through the truth
[1:05:04] your word is the truth we may first have
[1:05:07] said yes my brothers and sisters
[1:05:09] we're not from this world
[1:05:12] jesus is not of the world
[1:05:14] cosmos because uh the world means cosmos
[1:05:20] and when jesus is
[1:06:02] the
[1:06:44] even though we have good president
[1:06:46] system but the system says satan it's
[1:06:49] it's the devil
[1:06:51] amen
[1:06:57] it's satan who's leading the poor
[1:08:07] that is the intellectual understanding
[1:08:09] of who god is
[1:08:11] intellectually believe god intellectuals
[1:08:15] give the word intellectually
[1:08:18] but there is another phrase
[1:08:21] that's the word
[1:08:37] before separation and you don't force it
[1:08:41] it's it's a life living
[1:08:43] in public that you've been passed
[1:08:46] you've been privatized
[1:08:48] it's just the same life of god personal
[1:08:51] of control nobody to control you or too
[1:08:57] the first view is two faces of
[1:08:59] christianity
[1:09:05] many of us are still in that
[1:09:06] intellectual faith
[1:09:09] i don't want to hurt your feelings
[1:09:13] it's what the lord has put in my heart
[1:09:14] today
[1:10:00] of satan
[1:10:02] foundation justice is based on injustice
[1:10:07] under mercy in uh uh depravity the
[1:10:13] the prevention
[1:10:14] the mercy
[1:10:28] that's the thing
[1:11:06] he will control you by the perversion of
[1:11:09] morals
[1:11:25] uh great nations economic uh economics
[1:11:34] economic they usually have the
[1:11:36] impression of helping those little
[1:11:38] countries third
[1:12:49] so i want to get out of politics
[1:12:53] i don't want to get in trouble
[1:12:59] they say that were you in the religious
[1:13:01] staff for public
[1:13:16] want to show to you injustice how the
[1:13:18] devil is doing things today
[1:13:23] and we see how morals now are bad
[1:13:27] today
[1:13:29] you can see a woman keeper salmonella
[1:13:34] who uh she's walking naked
[1:13:40] it's not new things these things that
[1:13:42] you see along the way
[1:14:10] so there is no sense in people
[1:14:23] because an animal can be there without
[1:14:25] the clothing it's fine
[1:15:09] stored in austin in texas
[1:15:15] they're in australia
[1:15:22] they
[1:15:40] so that to appreciate my masterpiece
[1:15:45] you have to go in naked being naked
[1:15:50] men and women
[1:16:03] men and women taking off their clothes
[1:16:07] just to appreciate that masterpiece
[1:16:14] is here in the u.s
[1:16:18] we have
[1:17:13] and we're living in the way of
[1:17:16] falling dancing
[1:17:21] there is everything that you know is bad
[1:17:25] christians
[1:17:28] are those little
[1:18:10] everything to the children
[1:18:14] all of that is to show that
[1:18:16] before dancing
[1:18:18] living in a certain kingdom
[1:18:24] is governing
[1:18:51] and we have to know where we're standing
[1:18:52] with god amen
[1:18:55] now listen to what the prophet says
[1:18:59] in the message marriage and divorce
[1:19:02] say that if the word is beautiful
[1:19:06] it's july
[1:19:47] um
[1:20:02] and if the world
[1:20:15] is
[1:20:30] beautiful
[1:20:45] of god has to have a good character amen
[1:20:48] where my father yes my brothers and
[1:20:50] sisters
[1:20:53] now when i was talking about uh
[1:20:55] the program
[1:21:12] school
[1:21:14] our little children going to school
[1:21:18] i have to see what's going on
[1:21:21] he says
[1:21:23] this is in 1954.
[1:21:25] see foreign
[1:21:41] call our little children little girls in
[1:21:43] their schools
[1:21:46] who are 14 and 15 years old yeah not the
[1:21:49] catholics
[1:21:50] do we have any 14 or 15 year old here
[1:22:49] among some of them
[1:23:33] you say yeah this is african uh message
[1:23:36] no
[1:23:37] no it's an american he's a brother
[1:23:40] he's an american he's not an african an
[1:23:42] american he's an american
[1:23:44] this is so preached like that they said
[1:24:46] and have meetings with other men and
[1:24:47] prostituting themselves in this
[1:24:50] cities of louisville
[1:24:53] they tell them their moms
[1:24:56] say mom i have class in this time
[1:24:59] teleporter i have this program
[1:25:02] and it's not so
[1:25:04] song you gotta meet with other men
[1:25:08] you go meet with other women
[1:25:24] it's because they presented them a
[1:25:26] social gospel
[1:25:32] where preachers stand and talk about
[1:25:34] little pretty things
[1:26:37] [Music]
[1:26:47] so now how do you expect your children
[1:27:22] but the kid doesn't know the god of his
[1:27:24] father he has to say you the god of my
[1:27:26] father
[1:27:29] because his father doesn't even have a
[1:27:31] god
[1:27:38] satan has multiplied his power
[1:27:44] to the
[1:27:57] now the devil is imposing us seen as the
[1:28:00] as the actual life
[1:28:03] certainly is doing his best
[1:28:08] become a normal life
[1:28:12] and predicate
[1:28:36] [Music]
[1:28:39] he's fighting marriages to destroy him
[1:28:43] because he wrote
[1:28:44] down
[1:28:45] that will leave him
[1:28:47] but there is no marriage
[1:28:50] that means
[1:28:52] you can date whoever you want
[1:28:54] to
[1:29:22] a woman can have five husbands or five
[1:29:25] people that she is official and it's
[1:29:27] official an example she was attached i
[1:29:29] saw an example here
[1:29:36] where a
[1:29:50] and she says that she lives in peace
[1:29:52] with all her husbands
[1:29:54] i said this is nonsense
[1:29:59] and what kind of men can even accept
[1:30:02] such things
