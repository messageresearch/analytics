been here P many times probably dozens of times you probably don't know brother Den right but he and I had a high time yesterday fellowshipping together and uh he just pointed out something that I felt like I needed to share I could tell that enemy was really trying to resist us and and that's when a person gets the Holy Ghost sometimes they think they arrive but it's just the beginning and he pointed out there in Acts 10 how Peter resisted the spirit of God the voice and the vision of the spirit of God to go and to preach to cornelius's house now I don't think probably think we resisted the spirit of God but we have when we've not prayed thy will be done not my will and that's so such a strong Spirit against us and even as I sat out there this morning about the last half hour going

grace in the C of the Rock in your presence oh God [Music] praise amen that's my prayer this morning to be in God's presence amen let's stand and open our Bibles and in The Book of Mark we read we read at chapter 9 verse 16 to verse 29 Mark 9 verse 16 to verse 20 so the story it's uh a man had had a dump spirit and he was brought to the disciples and the disciples tried to pray for him but they couldn't because they didn't have enough faith enough Fai Spirit out amen verse 16 this is Jesus asking the scribes the Bible says that and he asked the scribes what question you with them and one of the multi and one of the multitude answered him say master I have brought unto thee my son which has a dumb spirit and wheresoever he taketh him he teth him and he forth and nashes with his Ste and pth away and I spake and I spake to that disciples that they should cast him out and they could not [Music] so now Jesus answered the Bible says that he answered him and saith oh faithless regeneration how long shall I be with you and how long shall I suffer you bring him to me unto me you know Jesus here is saying faithless generation how long shall I be with you you know because if you read the chapter before before it you you understand that the disciples went out to pray for the sick people you know and they prayed for others and others were healed you but when it came to this you know particular demon they just didn't have enough Faith so in other words that Jesus was trying to bring them into a stage of adoption you know but you know they didn't in other words they didn't have the secret or how to operate you know the Bible say verse 20 and and and the B and they brought him unto him and when he saw him shred away the spirit here him and he fell on the ground and wed for me and he asked his father how long is it ago since this came unto him and he said of a child and often times he has cast him into fire Into the Fire and into the waters to destroy him but if thou can do anything have compassion on us and help [Music] us Jesus said unto him if thou can believe all things are possible to him that [Music] believeth and St away the father of the charot cried out and said with tears Lord I believe help thou my unbelief when Jesus saw that the people came running together he rebuked the fou Spirit saying unto him thou dumb Spirit thou dumb and death Spirit death spirit I charge thee come out of him and enter no more into him [Music] Jes and the spirit cried and ran him sore and came out of him and he was as one dead in so much that many said he is dead but but Jesus still came by the hand and lifted him up and he arose and when he was come into the house his disciple asked him privately why could not we cast him out here as Jesus answered he said unto them this kind can come forth by nothing but by prayer and fasting amen let's bow ahead and pray dear heavenly father Lord Lord we come humbled before before your presence Lord Lord as the song said in your presence that's where I am strong in your presence that's where I belong Lord that's our prayer this morning is to belong in your presence God lord as David could said I rather I rather spend a day in in the presence of the Lord and spend 10,000 years outside of his presence come Lord because you knew that in your presence that's where great things was happening Lord he knew that in your presence that's where his strength was renewed Lord you knew that it's in your presence father God that all these questions Lord are answered Lord he knew that it's in your presence that all these needs were provided Lord we come unto you father God this morning we pray oh Father God that you keep us in your presence Lord we pray that you open our heart father God to receive this word this morning Lord and I pray father God that you help me oh Lord and you put me out out of the way father God and let your Spirit father God speak through me Lord Lord Jesus Christ we I pray that you make me so sensitive to the Holy Spirit God Lord that I will go father God everywhere you sent me to go Lord we pray that you be with us Lord Lord be with our pastor and brother Troy where they are Lord and and and then you bless them too father Lord bless all the he the heart that will hear your word Lord those who are here and those who aren not here Lord let everybody be blessed oh God Lord we pray and ask in Jesus Christ's name amen amen amen you may be seated this morning my subject will be only believe that's all it takes only believe you know as uh as we read here in Mark chapter 9 verse 16 to 29 you will notice that the disciple came to a stopping where they stop you know they couldn't go they couldn't go you know farther because they had an you know they had something in front of them that they couldn't overcome you know this man you know came with his child you know who had a dump Spirit on him and the disciple you know couldn't cast that Spirit out you know because as you know as Jesus said that that Spirit you know those type of demons you know only go they go away you know with by prayer and fasting you know the disciple now when they prayed for the first time you know they saw that they noticed that the demon resisted you know they started to lose Faith you know they began to ask themselves a questions you know you know do we really have the power to cast this demon out you know can we really cast this demon out you know they had everything that Jesus because Jesus was teaching them the power of Faith you know they first went out and they saw the result you know they pray for the Blind and the blind saw you know they pray for people who couldn't speak and they were able to to say something you know they prayed for the sick and the sick was healed they were healed but here he comes this demon you know the disciple just didn't have faith that he required to cast that demon out and when Jesus came you know he just spoke you know he said you demon get out of him and leave him alone and don't don't you ever come back you know and then then that demon went that demon went away you know Exodus 14 verse 13- 15 you know here the Bible is saying that you know that and Moses said unto the people fear ye not stand still and see the salvation of the Lord which he which he will show you today for for the see the salvation of the Lord which he will show you today for the the Egyptians whom he have seen today you shall see them again no more forever the Lord shall fight for you and you shall hold your peace and the Lord said unto Moses wherefore criest thou unto me speak unto the children of Israel that they go forward you know Moses received the word from the Lord you know he had to he had to speak to the children of Israel you know to create in them of the faith you know to be able to walk you know to be able to go forward because the children of Israel Al They sto they had you know they were they wasn't able to to go forward to go uh to go forward because they had an obstacle before them that they couldn't overcome you know when they looked behind them they so Pharaoh was coming and in front of them they saw the Red Sea you know many of them started to cry and and they ran into they ran to Moses they said but Moses look at Pharaoh here's Pharaoh coming you know what are we going to do you know he's so determined to kill all of us you know Moses went to the Lord you know Moses started to cry to the Lord you know and the lord gave him this word of comfort you know to tell the people not to fear you know to hold their peace you know and and then they will see see the salvation of Lord you know in other words Moses God told Moses to tell the people to only [Music] believe and they will see the salvation of the Lord so now here's the verse 15 now God turns to Moses you know he says but Moses why are you crying to me you know you have the power to speak the word and the thing will happen you know God said that wherefore wherefore criest thou unto me you know speak unto the children of Israel that go forward you know God said Moses I gave you the authority to speak the word you know I gave you the authority you know to speak the word and to bring things into existence you know to to speak the word and whatever you say well happen you know look at what I have done with you in Egypt Egypt you know I think through you spoke the word and and I believe I think it was 49 uh uh Miracles and 10 plagues came to came to Egypt miracles you know when Moses was speaking no in other words God was telling me look at everything that you have done or you have said you know but you still don't have that Faith to speak the word you know therefore speak the word and let the people go amen and you know sometimes we can come into you know those situations you know you have faith in God but you know you so trouble with the situation you know you start crying as Moses but Lord look at Pharaoh is coming you know what are we going to do Lord look at the sickness is coming lord the devil I mean the uh the doctor says that I only have a week to leave Lord they say that I can't go any further what am I supposed to do you know God will tell you the the very same thing he told Moses you why criest thou unto me you know speak the word and this sickness will go away you know speak the word and this situation will be over you know speak the word and your and your needs will be provided you know just only believe you know the children of Israel they wonder where where where are we going now Moses you know here is Pharaoh coming and the red to before us where are we supposed suppos to go you know Moses knew that he had a place to go you know he went to the rock you know like this song says you know where do I go when there's no one else to turn to who do I talk to when there's no one when no one wants to listen who do I lean on when there is no Foundation stable I go to the Rock and I know that's stable I go to the Rock I go to the rock of my salvation I go to the stor that the builders rejected because I run to the mountain and the mountain Stand By [Music] Me When the Earth all around me is seeking sand on the solid rock I stand because when I need a shelter and when I need a friend the only place that I can go is to the rock you know and then the song says again where do I hide till the storms have all passed over you know where do I run to when the Winds of Sorrow are threatened are threatening you know is there a refuge in the time of tribulation but when my soul needs consolation I go to the rock you know you might be standing in a point or in a situation you know where you looked on your right you look you look on the right left you know before in front of you behind you there is just no help you know you try to go to your friend for consolation and then you find them you know complaining too you know you want to go this to look for help you just can't get over it you know everybody it looks like everybody's going through the same situation but there is one place that we all can go you know there is there's one place that we all can run to you know it's to the rock you know we all can rock we all can run to that rock you know and we will find everything that we need you know we all can run to that rock you know when The Tempest ra is Raging you know when the winds are blowing you know when sickness is coming you know when this trial is coming you know you just you just find no place of rescue you know you try to go this place that you know you just can't find the comfort that you need you know Jesus is that rock you know you can run to him you know you can go to him and you will find the shelter you know he says that you know heavens and earth will pass away but my word will not pass other words that the word of God is this unshakable Kingdom you know when everything is uncertain you know God's word stand you know when everything is uncertain God's word is still there you know if you can only place your soul into into that rock you know if you can only stand go to that unshakable Kingdom you know when the when the heaven will pass away when the earth will pass away you know you will still be there because you are hiding in that unshakable Kingdom amen David also came to that point you know David also came to that stage you know where he looked at on his right and looked in his left you know he just couldn't find any help you know he looked in the heels he just couldn't find any help and then he was inspired to write these Psalms of 121 you know the Bible says that Psalms 121 [Music] verse1 I will lift up my eyes unto the heels from whence cometh my help my Help Cometh From The Lord which made Heaven and Earth he will not suffer thaty food to be moved because he that keepeth thee will not slumber nor will it [Music] sleep behold he that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep The Lord Is Thy keeper The Lord Is Thy shap right hand the sun shall not smile the by day nor the Moon by Night the Lord shall preserve thee from Evil from all evil and he shall preserve thy Soul the Lord shall preserve thy going out and thy coming from from this time forth and even for forever more you know David may you know probably you know maybe he found himself you know surrounded by by by enemies and he wrote this Psalms you know if you read the verse one of this Psalms you know uh King the way King James you know translated this you know verse James you know it's quite different than you know other translations other translations I mean to me it's more clear because they they they wrote it as a question you know in other words verse one you know David is is saying that shall I lift up my my my KN to the [Music] hills when should my help come and then he answer to those questions that help will come from the Lord you know he's asking himself a question you know should I try you know should I lift my hand my you know my my my eyes to the hills you know where does my help come from you know my Help Cometh From The Lord you know certainly he was surrounded by by by by those you know by enemies you know maybe it was surrounded by Philistines and all all those things all those you know you know but he just couldn't find a way to go you know he just he couldn't find a way you know a place to run you know he was like this you know I'm done today I'm you know my my Army and I will be dead I mean they will be killed you know but he thought about something he remembered something you know that I I can't you know if there is no place where I can get my help you know here on Earth you know there is no Hills that I can run to you know there is no mountain that I can climb and then go and then go [Music] hide but I can still trust God you know I can still trust the Lord because my Help Cometh From Him amen Jeremiah 323 you know here Jeremiah also saying you know being in the same you know context as David you know the bible say that truly in vain is salvation hoped from the [Music] heels and from the multitude of the mountains truly in the Lord our our God is the Salvation of Israel you know Salvation is know as the Bible said that there is salvation is only in the name of Jesus in the name of God you know that's where you can find Salvation you know there is no other name on Earth that somebody can that people can be saved you know there is no other name on Earth that you can pray and then have your answered your prayer being being answered you know it's only in the name of Jesus so when you're going through those situations you know just remember that you can call on you can call on him and he will show up you know when you're going through those trials you know just remember that God is there he just may be waiting for you to call on him you know and then and then it will show up you know sometimes God brings you know those those uh uh uh um tribulations and and you know God bring those situations to us you know to help us have experience have have a daily life experience with him you know because we we we understand that there is so many people who leave off you know their past experience like for from from 40 years or I don't know how how long it was you know but you need to have that daily life experience with God you know I'm going to tell you a story you know it happened 1800 you know there was a man who was you know uh uh he had the hand he was on the the hand car hand car I don't know in French what what's that version those car you know back in back in the days where you had to pump it before it goes you had to go through U it was on the the Tren truck it was going on the on the Tren truck yeah so you had to pump it and then and and then the I mean the hand car will go so the more you pump it you know the the the faster you go so this man was on that hand car you know he was pumping the car and then and then he was he was going you know just when you reach his highest speed this man was shot and he was dead he was killed he was dead so as when he was when he was when he was still alive this man has built a great momentum you know that helped him you know that that kept the the the car going costing you know you know though the man was killed but the car was still going you know it went the car went to the I mean until it reached the next County the next County then he stopped you know people who saw this man on the car from afar you know maybe some of them you know could say wellow this man is going so fast and look at him he's resting you know he's even sleeping feeling the air and all the goodness of of the hand car but they couldn't understand that this man was no longer living but because that man has built a great momentum the car was able to go to Coast until the until reach until reach the next County you know this is the same thing with us Christians you know sometimes we have real real experience with God you know it's an experience that you know that certainly this experience is real you know God has said our word on fire he said our word on fire you know and and then this experience is so real that that you know everything in the Bible marching that you know telling you that this experience is only God you know but but but you just let but for some reason you just let the devil to come to you and then take that you know take that consecrated life off you know out from from you you know because that experience was so real to you and people outside you know they noticed that that experience was real you know people when the devil has already come and and he took that prayer life away from you you know he took that joy of the Lord away from you you know he he took that consecrated life away from you but people you know as you have built a great momentum as that experience has built a great momentum you know it's helping you I mean it's costing it's still costing you know in other words the people from the outside you know they're still thinking that this man is so on fire from God you know this man is still closer to God as he was you know this man you know has he's still loving God as it was but you inside of you you know exactly that the devil has taken that Joy away from you you know you're just leaving off that that you know that old experience you know there is nothing new you know happening in your life you know it's just that influence that people saw you when you had that experience you know you're just leaving all that that they from that experience but in knew you're so certain that you don't have that life anymore you know that's a wrong place to be you know we have to have a daily walk with God you know that experience can ca can help you cating that experience you know that can help you cating and if you don't wake up you know you will find yourself Dead for forever you know if you don't wake up and say Lord Lord help me Jesus you know as this man he said that God I believe but help my unbelief you know you will find yourself that even that little voice that you still have all dead and quiet and there is no hope you know and this stage is the stage where every Christian you know go through you know we all sometimes you know some in some point of our life we went through that experience you know where we were so on fire with God you know God doing great things but somewhere you started eating for you eating from the wrong table you know sometimes you started you know listening to the wrong type of music you know you start hanging hanging with you know wrong wrong wrong friends you know you start eating wrong food you know you let your eyes seeing the things that you're not supposed to see you know you let your ears you know hearing things that you're not supposed to [Music] hear you know slowly you're going away from God you know slowly the devil is coming and he's killing you you know step by step but because when you were in fire on in fire for God on fire for God you know you have built a great reputation you know people who sees you see you you know they think that this is the same brother Isaac you know he's so on fire for God you know look at what he has done look at what God has done through him you know look at look at what what what you know go how God has helped him and how God has you know had made him successful but in you you're so certain that that same God is no longer as it was inside of you because you let something wrong happen in your life you know but you don't have to let it be the you know the same way you know you can still stand up and wake up and go to the rock you know don't get used to coasting you know don't get used to coasting you know it's time to wake up you know it's time to wake up like an e you know an eag it's a it's a it's a it's a bird that can live up to 70 years but there is something that happens when he reaches 40 years or 40 35 to 40 years you know the eagle goes blind you know his b is bent bent and then he you know heavy feathers will start growing we know coming coming from him and he will no longer be able to fly as he used to you know in other words the same Eagle when he was young he was on fire for God you know going flying high and having a great [Music] vision but now he grow is is Growing Old Death is now coming into him so now that the e have to make a choice it's either to die or to have a new birth you know by most Eagles you know they don't accept dying you know what he will do he will fly as high as he can to the Rock and then he will start beaing himself against The Rock you know until it bleeds you know until he breaks his be you know and then it's a painful it's a painful experience that he has to go through you know for that new birth you know he willon beat himself against The Rock you know until his big is his big is until until his big is broken and then there he will wait until we'll have a new B so when he will have that new B he will start now taking those heavy feathers away you know off of him to make him light and then be able to fly as high as he could you know when the cross when the cross will you know will blind his his side you know he won't be able to see he won't be able to see you know the ego will go up on the be on the Rock and beat himself up against The Rock until he bleeds and takes that take that cross away you know that's the same thing that Christian has to dois you know when the cares of Life are come come out blinding your your your I mean your sight you know when sorrow of life you know they're coming to you you know until your soul will start developing this doubt you know you're saying but Lord look at look at the situation that I'm in you know and then and then you I mean your soul develop this doubt and then it becomes so heavy to you you can't fly anymore amen you can't spend those night of prayer as you used to you know you can't no longer spend those consecrated time that as you used [Music] to you know evil present on every end you know you can go to the rock you can go and beat yourself in the rock you know you beat yourself on you know on on God's promise on God promises you know until those promise be becomes yours you know until you break that beak you know until you break those feathers of of of doubt you know until you take the cross away from your eye you know you beat yourself in God's promises you know until you have this new birth you know until this faith will come again to you that you will be able to see to speak the word and things will come no you can go to the rock you know when those Time Of Life come to you you know when the cares of Life come to you you know it seems like you can't go any further you know like the children of Israel the Red Sea before you and Pharaoh coming you know behind you you know you can go to the Rock You Know make those promises of God yours you know as the prophet said that you change the name and the Bible you replace your name and God's promises you know and then and then and then you know some great things will come to you you know because we serve a God who like to display power amen look at the blind you know God was able to to give the man inside when he was a [Music] baby but God had waited you know God was able to do to I mean to give him to give him to give his side when he was baby but God had waited until this blind body grew up and everybody in the city knew who it was because he was there and you know everybody knew he was blind then God came in and and do his Miracle you know because he wanted people to know that you know what he is able to do you know he wanted people to do to know what the face faith in God can what faith in God can do you know this man who was laying at the P ofen for 38 years this man was crying was looking for for for deliverance for for [Music] healing but he couldn't he couldn't go he couldn't go into the pool you know every time he tried to to go to the pool you know somebody was going there before you know every time you know because the pool was his only hope because the angel was coming and then stir that water and the first one and the first person to to go in was here so this man couldn't be he wasn't fast enough to go in he was laying there you know maybe you know maybe it was you know hop place he was like Lord you know I'm going die here if you come and you will find me here because every time I try to run to that pool you know somebody will come will be faster than me and get this cealing Lord I've been here for 38 years I'm still the same you know now I'm smelly and old you know I just I just can't I you know I just can't do it you know my my hair has grow has grown you know my beard has covered all my face you know I just can't walk you know I just can't find the joy that I'm looking for Lord I just can't find the satisfaction that I'm looking for you know it wasn't that time that Jesus walked in you know it wasn't that time that Jesus came to him you know to do a miracle just for one person you know God heard his cry you know God heard his prayer but God was waiting for the right moment you know only believe you know if you have you know things in your life that you want God to come to come in action you know only believe you know it doesn't matter how long it takes you know as we preached last Sunday you know morning will come you know even though Darkness you know it takes you 12 hours you know the the sun will still shine because a real believer When God Says something anything he takes it and act upon it and doesn't f about it you know he doesn't ask any other questions you know it's a God said it I believe it and that settles it you know you can ask him but you know how is God going to do it you know he tell you I don't know how you know why is he going to do it you know but I I don't know I don't know why and I don't know how you know but I know one thing that God said it you know I believe it and that settles it you know Abraham how are you how are you going to have a son that's not a question that I can't answer you know God said it I believe it that sett it Gideon how are you going to fight but you know how are you going to win the battle with L Soldier you know this is a question that I cannot answer you know even myself I don't understand it you know even myself I try to look for an answer for the valuable explanation I just can't find it but God said it I believe it and that settles it Moses how are you going to go and and set the children and and set the children of Israel free you know look at pharaoh and his army you know that is the greatest army in the earth Moses said I don't know he just told me to take my my my my my to take my my my my uh my rod and go you know Moses can you even you can even go buy a gun Moses said but well God didn't tell me to go buy anything you know he just told me to take my rod and then go but how are you going to do it that's not a question that I can't answer you know God said it I believe it that settles it David how are you going to kill Goliath with only five Stones you know look at how he's big and huge you know look at his arm look at his armor you know look at his you know his mask and and everything that he has you know he's so thick that even your stone cannot even go through but David look at how short and skinny you are how are you going to beit how are you going to kill him David said well I don't know I had that same answer you know when the lion died when when I killed the lion you know I tried to ask myself how did this lion die just couldn't find the answer you know when the bear came I try I asked the same question but I just couldn't find the answer but I know something God said it I believe it and th sett it you know people can come to you but look at your life you know how are you going to be saved you know how are you going to receive the Holy Spirit you know it's not your problem to know how it's not your problem to know why you just have faith in God you know you just have faith in God you know you just only believe and you will have this testimony with you you know I don't know about the how you know I don't know about about about the why but I can tell you the when and I can tell you the where you know I can tell you exactly when this happened you know I can tell you exactly when God saved me you know I can't tell you exactly where God saved me but I can never tell you why he saved me or I can never can never tell you how he saved me you know the only why that I can give to you it's because he loved me you know but how he saved me I don't know you know I just knew that I was this guy now I'm no longer the same you know I just knew that I was smoking no now I don't smoke anymore you know I just knew that I was drinking now I don't drink anymore you know I just knew that I had this bad behavior you know now I'm a total new person amen the prophet says that you know sometimes we're just so afraid of our Goliath amen when that Goliath come to you you see the size of the Goliath you know you ask yourself a question how in the world am I going to fight this Goliath know how am I going to kill him you know it's not your problem to know how you know you just believe amen the prophet says that and there he was standing there boasting himself and bragging it seems like the odds is down and then he said that don't have no let don't have no blood shed he said let some man let some men can come come come and fight me and then if it win if I win then you all just serve me and then if you win then we will serve you see when the devil thinks he's got the odds on you that's when he likes to make his br [Music] but he met a wrong man he met the Litt man in the country in the country little sto shored R looking fellow you know he said do you mean to tell me that you the army of the Living God will stand there and let this uncircumcised Philistine defy the army of the Living God why he was shocked at it you know he just in other words he couldn't believe what you know his friends or his brother were doing the prophet said why why because he was a Believer the others were make Believers see he was a genuine believer he said if you afraid I will go fight him see what a challenge for a little guy like that and so he was a Believer and he done exact and he done just exactly what he knew that God would do amen and the size of Goliath didn't Shake David you know David was asking his for his brothers but why are you letting this man defile the army of God you know why but you know this Goliath his flesh will be will be will be the bird's food because I have faith in God the same God that gave me that experience the same God that gives me the daily experience that I [Music] have the same God who will kill this beast and they will serve us faith is by hearing the word the word of the promise The Word of Promise if you don't have a promise then you venture you venture out upon your own faith but if you can't take the promise if you if you can't take a promise of God that's God's promise to you the woman the woman that touched His Garment had no promise of that by her faith without a promise God her her healing now if she could get her healing by by her faith without a promise in what she was doing amen how much more are we to get our our healing by faith in a promise that God is manifesting and Vindicated before [Music] us and he has brought he has brought it to us by by his word come come around and confirm his word you know if that woman she didn't have faith she didn't have any promise you know in other words nobody had this problem that he had he was actually the first one he had no promise to hold her faith to base her faith on but that couldn't stop her because the prophet said that faith has no barrier you know faith will go through any challenge that will come to it you know this woman didn't looked at her situation saying that I have no promise so I can't have faith but she still believed that even though I don't have any promise for this circumstance I can I can as well be the first one to be healed you know for others com com after me she had faith in God you know because worrying doesn't help you you know worrying doesn't change any situation you know but Faith does try to imagine yourself you in prison and they say that you you'll be you'll be killed tomorrow you know even though you try to worry you know you know from that time that the news came to you until the day that you will die nothing will change I mean you can worry as you can and cry and do whatever you can stop eating and not talking to anybody you nothing will change the situation won't change but it just doesn't kill you to have faith in God you know at least the faith in God will change the situation you know you will be you'll be granted the grace you know if you have faith in God you know there are people who have been you know the angel walked in the prison and then they walk free you need an example there is Peter in the Bible you know there is Paul you know just have faith in God you know only believe you know just let off the pressure and let God act just let off the pressure and Let Jesus you know have act you know in closing let's read I'll close with this thought um Romans chapter 8 verse uh Hebrews I'm sorry Hebrews chapter 11 verse I'll start from verse eight and then I will jump out the verses until to famili verse the Bible say verse eight of Hebrews chapter 11 by faith Abraham when he was called when he was called to go out into the into a place which he should he should have receive uh uh in in inheritance and obey I'm Sorry by faith Abraham went when he was called to go out into a place which he should have to receive inheritance obeyed and he went out not knowing whether whether he went by faith he surgeon in the land of promise as as a Str uh uh as in a strange country dwelling in dwelling in Tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob they hars with him of the same promise for he looked for a city which has no Foundation whose Builder and maker is God because through faith also Sarah also Sarah herself received strength and convin and conceived uh and conceived seed and was delivered of a child when she was when she was past age because she judged him faithful who had promised you know I love how the bible say that she judged him faithful who had promised and that faith in God was able you know to strengthen him to conceive seed amen that faith in God you know that Abraham had he was able to see a vision of a city whose Builder was Christ and then he put his Fai he set his faith you know looking for for that City you know going to that City you know verse 13 the bible say that these all died in faith not having received the promises but having seen them a far off but and were persuaded of them and embrace them and confess that there were strangers and pilgrims on the earth for for for they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country a country and truly if they had been mindful of their country from from once they came out they might they might have had opportunity to have returned but now they they desire a better country that is in Heavenly that is in Heavenly wherefore God is not ashamed to be called a God for he has prepared for for them a city you know those they died in faith you know hoping to see that to go to get that to get to that country but they had not received that promise I mean they had the promise but you know uh the Bible say but they have having received but not having received their promises you know verse 13 these all died in faith not having Reed received the Promises by having seen that having seen them from a far off um um you know in other words they saw a vision of that City you know they wanted to get to that City so bad but you know they just couldn't they just couldn't I mean they didn't got they didn't have that you know God didn't give them the grace to to get to that City but they died still believing amen verse 23 by faith Moses when he was born was he was he three months uh uh was he three months of his parents because they saw he was a proper child and they were not afraid of the king's commandment by faith Moses when he was come to years refused to be called the son of the the son of Pharaoh's daughter choosing rather to suffer Affliction with the with the people of God than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season amen the Bible said that choosing rather to suffer Affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season you know because Moses in mind he had that seity in mind and to get to that City you know this temporary pleasures of sin you know was not going to help him you know he had to choose God's side he had to stand on God's promise you know for him to for him you know to get to that City you know verse 32 and and what shall I move and what shall I more say for the time will fail me to tell of Gideon and of Barack and of Samson samon and of Jeff and of David also and Samuel Samuel and of the prophets who through faith subdued kingdoms wrote righteousness obtain promises stal the mouth of lions quench the violence of fire escaped the edge of the sword out of weakness were made strong Works valant in fight turned to fly the armies of the AL the aliens women receive their dead rais to life again and others were tortured not accepting Deliverance that they might obtain a better Resurrection you know in other words because the Deliverance was to deny God then you will no longer be tortured but they had a promise of that City you know to have a better Resurrection you know I have to go through that trial you know I have to have faith in other words I'm not supposed to run away from it you know if they want to kill me let let them kill me you know if I perish let me perish but I will never B Bow Down and Worship this God you know I will never Bow Down and accept your deliverance because I know that I will have a better Resurrection if I stand still verse 36 and others had trial of cruel trial of cruel mockings and and scourings yet moreover of bonds of imprisonment they were stoned they were son a s now word cut cut cut in half you know where they were living you know while they were in life they were tempted they were slain with the sword they wandered about in ship skins and goat skins being destitute Afflicted and tormented of whom whom the word was not worthy that wandered in desert and in mountains and in dens and the caves of the earth and these all having obtained a good report through faith received not a promise but God having provided some better thing for us that they without us will not be made perfect you know what was that promise was Perfection you know what was that promise you know was to go in that you know to go to that City that Christ was the builder you know they had to go through those trials you know they had to stand there you know still believing in God you know some of them were hiden by lions you know some of them were CAU in half but yet they still believe you know but here it says that but even though you know they did all of that you know they will not be made made perfect without us but how are we going to be about how are we going to be be made perfect you know if we have the same Faith as they had amen if we can stand and and you know stand you know and stand still and and and still believe God's promis you know even you know when those hard times will come you know we can stand still and and still believe God's promise you know when they offer us those fake you know when they say that if you don't if you don't deny God you will die you know to get to that City you have to keep your faith you know like Daniel you know if you worship other gods you know they will kill you the Lions the Lions will hit you you know like Daniel still had faith and God was able to close those lion's [Music] mouth you know because they knew something that Resurrection was coming you know it was through that same faith that Joseph you know saw the city you know he he saw the place of resurrection and he told his children that when God will send you a deliver don't let my bones in here you know get my bones with you you know go bury me where the resurrection will will take place you know that's where I want to be you know he had faith in God you know they also this city has a you know in a vision you know maybe you say but well brother Isaac I've never seen that City in the vision you know I've never had a vision you know but you've heard about the city you know you've heard about the city that God who the Christ is the building you know you've heard about the city you know the Golden City you know the Golden Street you know you've
