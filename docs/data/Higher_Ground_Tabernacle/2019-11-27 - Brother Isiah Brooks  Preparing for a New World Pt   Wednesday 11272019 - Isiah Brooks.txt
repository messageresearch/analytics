a new world and by God's grace we'll move on by the leadership of the Holy Spirit I believe we're living in the last days and it's always important to keep in mind why we're here amen and what we're here for so I appreciate the Lord for being so good to us as we stand let us turn to Hebrews 11 and 7 I appreciate all that is done here by God's grace by everybody and their participants anticipating and trying to make the service a successful one we thank God for you we appreciate the Living God I realize that we're living in the last days and we we know that the most important thing that we can do is keep eyes on Jesus Satan is uh is a cruel adversary and he's gonna do whatever he can do to throw us off paths but by God's grace you know if we just continue to love one another and continue to love God brother Brennan they were asked he was asked a question how how to to to make sure I make a rapture and he says read the Bible every day and pray that's as simple as it can get he didn't say you had to belong to this church of that church but if your true believer you read your Bible every day and pray do your best thing doing that anyway keeping God on your mind and in your hearts at all I want to make sure I think it's the January the 19th that weekend we'll be having our brother Andrew Glover come so those of you who know brother Andrew Glover we put it in in stone today if the Lord said Terry will have Andrew Glover here doing that weekend I'll give you further details what we're going to be doing as that day approached by God's grace as far as I know of we don't have any other guest speakers coming by God's grace and I'm gonna make this announcement even Sunday to make sure that people do not invite creatures to preach here if somebody want to come let them come by way of me they can come by way of the internet or whatever because I have all kinds of calls I've got a lot of people calling me people out don't even know you know not long ago we tried to discourage a brother for coming and he came anyway and but anyway some time that's misunderstood and so we're not trying to hurt anybody's feelings or anything like that but if somebody ever gets a notion I know there are those who are not internet who's listening to me so please don't invite anybody without talking to me first because even when it comes to businesses they like to have a background check so that you can understand all brethren are not brethren and we won't mean full of the Holy Ghost you know if you come and preach it come and he's full of the Holy Ghost he won't get an attitude about the way things he thought things may or should have gone so anyway we won't Holy Ghost feel preachers if they in the Lord's will you love the Lord Hebrews 11:7 we're not going to be long tonight it says in the in the King James Version I'm gonna read the amplifier a version - I don't normally read those but it's really nice I like it I like the way it brings things out it kind of helps me get started with the message tonight and it reads by faith being warned of God of things that not seen as yet move with fear prepared an ark to the saving of his house by the which he condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith according to the amplified version it says prompted by faith nor being forewarned by God concerning events of which as yet there was no visible sign took heed and diligently and reverently constructed and prepared an ark for the deliverance of his own family by this his faith which relied on God he passed judgment and sentence on the world's unbelieving when he came an air and possessor of righteousness that relation of being right in to which God put the person who has faith let us pray Lord Jesus we thank you for your grace and your mercy we thank you for being so good to us father we pray that you would cleanse us from all unrighteousness let your perfect will be done tonight as we submit ourselves to you Lord Jesus let your word be spoken give us God and give us grace to move completely out of your way that your perfect will will be done tonight in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated one thing I want to say by God's grace and I know that all of us are aware and we know that God is infinite he cannot lie God speaks anything contrary knows everything right in other words God cannot speak anything contrary and he knows everything just as perfect as the beginning as he is at the ending I'm just giving you a little thought on these things because I was thinking the other day how powerful this book is and you can burn it you can tear it up but it still exists this book is only written in this dimension but the Bible tells us that God's Word is written in heaven so before it came here so that we can see it and comprehend it now understand this this is just a small portion of God this is God redemption plan we don't know what entails us out the redemption is over because remember when Jesus was here the Bible said if they had put in all the miracles that Jesus had done while he was on earth if they had written it in scrolls there wouldn't have been no place to write at all so you got to understand that God didn't tell us everything here there are so many things that even in our lives that takes place miracles and things that nature that there is no book not here but we realized that everything is kept in record in heaven you understand me so what I'm trying to say is he's infinite and a lot of times people don't understand God because they said God created everything well God is perfect all right God is holy so what isn't that evil come by way of God no evil came by way of Lucifer and because God is everywhere understand everywhere by being omniscient that means because he knows everything he knows everything so that places him everywhere is that right I mean God knows everything now he did not create sin in the way we think he did but he allows sin to come by way of Lucifer now you said what do you mean did God know yes he knew but God gives us free moral agency right you can choose good and you can choose evil just as Lucifer did we call him the devil now he's Satan right but everything that was not created in God's perfect will and plan will be done away with all evil and all evil things and everything that comes by evil which is by the way a perversion comes from Satan it is a revelation God is not understood by science and God is not in understood by intellect God comes by revelation when God begins to reveal himself to you that's where God comes from that's how we understand God right upon this rock I'll build my church and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against it that means by revelation as God reveals himself that's why he's real to some and not real to others because some cannot see him because they're trying to intellectually can't conceive him but God is not and he cannot be intellectually conceived he is given his revelation to his own is that right Eluga so you said what what do you mean brother brother brother Brooks I mean if you read this Bible in an intellectual way you'll find a lot of things that seem to be so contradictory like in Genesis when God made man right but they don't understand he didn't make man twice he made man once and he formed the second man out of the dust of the earth which became part of the first man so they went to me and they were one man one man a men stood there in at the often II which we call a word body and the other man was formed the dust was formed shaped around him so what do you mean brother Brooks I'm trying to tell you that God is a man when it comes to his form he is shaped like a man he is a man greater than a man is that right because even in his day I'm coming in just a minute they said to Jesus they accused him say you are a man trying to make yourself God but they had a reverse he was God who was making himself a man just like God is doing now God is making himself a man so let me move on by God's grace God is endless right for example a circle now this is in my notes I'm going somewhere with this uh you know there's no beginning and there's no ending or you can use this infinity sign there is no stopping place I like the infinity sign because right in the middle of the Infinity you see a cross which connects two circles the Alpha and the Omega so when we look and you say well brother what are you trying to say I'm trying to say that we are creatures not of this world right in a man comes from another world come from another dimension come from another place now this might sound quite strange because we know how Hollywood always tap into things and you know about another dimension in another world well that's how the devil is I mean you know he he he taps into things I mean that's what Einstein did remember I told you the last time I preached Einstein says according to relativity you know and the quantum theory that too can exist in the same different places at the same time in other words I can be here on earth and be in heaven too even Jesus said that he said how can a man stand how can the Son of Man be here on earth and be in heaven at the same time if you know you said what what do you mean if I astound understood there was a word body there's another part of you that lives somewhere else hallelujah and we call that the word body we call that that theophany you and I would have been birthed into that had not Adam and Eve sinned because Adam and Eve sinned we bypass out the apne and we began to live like animals we are not animals we were created animals we were created in the form and likeness only because God wanted Adam which was the spiritual man to be able to be in contact with the natural is that right I'm saying all of these things to understand understand that we are preparing to go back to the creature that God intended us to be that's why we do what we do well this is not our home that's why we have a deep call if there's something that tells us there's a better place there's a better home there's something out there I can't put my finger on it but it's I know that I'm not supposed to live this long every man has in him every true Son of God has in them that desire to be greater and if there is a desire for you to be greater or closer to God hallelujah that is what we call the law of God a deep call to the deep yeah man and there's a deed to respond that means there is coming a responding from God because God declared I've never lost one is that right knowing that God put a seed in us I'm coming this way because remember Noah to pay there was a message that came from God right and that message was is going to rain and Noor started preparing that Ark according to the blueprint in which God had given him the Titanic couldn't defeat it can't compare no ship or ocean liner can't compare to what Noah built Wow because Noah built an ark that was perfect right understand Noah's Ark had three levels just just like the three the levels that we must come through in order to be completely safe you must be justified you must be sanctified and you must have the Holy Ghost is that right and remember that Noah's Ark had only one door that means there was only one way to be saved hallelujah you couldn't come to a back door cuz the back door didn't exist hallelujah you had to come through the door which was a type of Christ Jesus said Christ says I am the door I am the way I am the truth I am the life is that right even Jesus said no man can come unto the Father except by me in other words you've got to come through Jesus Christ you love the Lord so you said what are you saying because God had of people that believed that supposing in we're gonna say this and we're going to move on that's supposing there was 8 or 8 so 8 million people in the world that means one out of a million people were saved now you got to understand because God understands everything God saw that only eight souls was gonna say be saved baby no ahead of megachurch he had to be had to been because remember now the earth that that day was not divided there was not an American America there was not a Europe all land was of one mass you find out that after the flood there came a Continental Divide that's when the continents began to drift that's how come you have different people on different parts right and understand this was done after the confusion god order only separated their language but he separated the continents hallelujah so therefore Amen if you if you they always say trace it all the way down I don't care what bloodline there is there's only one blood that came from Adam and Eve and every race on the face of the earth can be traced back to Adam and Eve y'all get me so what are you saying by the books I'm saying those who were truly the sealing sons of God because Adam never produced Amen sons of God after the fall Adam had sons of Adam right because the sons of God were supposed to be made in the image and likeness of God and I'm just recapping everything so that you can understand that's why when women have babies they the babies drop that way that's a sign of the fall right because men we're supposed to be upright Adam was created upright right and as I said by God's grace you got to realize also that in Adam was not created a baby babies only came by the fall so beyond the curtain of time you're not gonna find babies I don't care how many times people say in the news oh my god and they were children and they were babies over there they're lying there are no babies beyond the curtain of time because because behind the curtain of time you come back to the original state that you were supposed to be in before you came here and when you come here when the way we were supposed to come was supposed to be by spoken word and the world would be spoken like it was when God says let us make man right it was a spoken word that produced Adam and Eve and as you said as I said before amen you must understand this is why you have these ten toes it shows that we are trees right and these are the stubs are the roots right God uprooted us and we began to walk right right so you got to understand that over there you will not have any shoes because you won't need any shoes shoes were given to us to protect us from the thorns and the thistles won't be no thorns and thistles over there hallelujah so you say what do you mean brother Brooks you and I we won't have to worry about fashion shows or anything like that there'll be no competition a man everybody will be who they are and what they are you understand me but everybody won't be the same you don't know that there'll be levels levels of success crowns rewards right we won't all wear the same uniform some of us will have if I could say like this put in a natural way some will have more stripes on their uniform than others right showing what you did in this day right like that like the song say no cross no crown and you and I must understand won't be in a jealousy won't be in the competition you see because all of that came by way of Lucifer that's why in his kingdom to this day you have a lot of strife you have competition you have world at kingdoms fighting one another because that was the way it was after the beginning when Lucifer fell to the is that right that's the truth and even as that thought was brought to us which I loved that thought that when Lucifer the one thing that Lucifer I'm sorry the one thing that Adam needed to do Adam needed to conquer the devil right cuz Adam was just like God he was a little God right I'm Tamar we preparing now but this information is important because you got to understand when God open the seals according to the private of God we went back to the position in that day before Adam fail that means all the authority that God gave Adam in that David the fall has now been given to the believer now I say believer but you got to understand that full power and authority only comes to those sons and daughters who are adopted right it doesn't he God don't give that to anybody he give to that person who have come into a full maturity of Christ that's the way it goes so because God can't just give a child anything God looking for mature Christians so that when that time and comes to us Amen well where the word is needed to be spoken we will not speak it until we get a dust settle or we won't move until we get a dust at the Lord see it'll be a time when Lucifer will scratch his head the devil was scratched he's because he won't know what to do with you he won't be able to tempt you break you been you or shake you he will be so confused because you see he wasn't expecting God to reproduce oh he wasn't expected it but if he had always seen what God spoke to Adam he would have known right and God told Adam a mentor about to be fruitful and multiply and as I said before Adam really never did it because after the fall Adam never produced sons and daughters of God he produce hybrids because the sex act brings hybrids hallelujah that's why when we get over there there'll be no more sex hallelujah you have a male body and you have a female body but they're not be anymore reproducing all of God's children will be produced you said you mean killing already there you mean to tell me like the brother said you and I go all of us gonna be on earth that's not what God said see what we don't understand that when God this is just a beginning this was the seed chapter of God exploration if you want to say like that there's world on top of world moves on top of moons planet on top of planet universes own and God is not a for God hallelujah God told us he said listen if you are faithful into little in his world I will make you a ruler of 10 cities think if there was a million people they men who was faithful how many how can 10 cities hello and God don't make little cities hallelujah The Jerusalem is how big it is one city look how big that is that covers half of the United States one city coast-to-coast you know you think about it so I'm saying all of these things ten of those but remember in the world to come there now there won't be no ocean all the land that's going down will now come up right no water other than the life the stream of life the river life that's right the river life that flows beneath the City of God and the throne of God mmm normal ocean so they're going to be laying everywhere hallelujah now how long we gonna all stay here at one time only God knows it's his business but God's intention is not for all of us to stay here so what do you say brother but so you can understand the purpose for which we are here God doesn't give you the spoken word without giving you a work to do is that right he told Adam I'm giving you the word I want you to speak like I spoke I want you to do this and Adam had the ability to say tree B he pluck up move over here when stopped and the wind had to stop right you said what do you mean because Jesus Christ was the second Adam hallelujah was it not true that Jesus stopped the winds and the waves is it was is it not true that Jesus walked on the water is it not true that he turned water into wine hallelujah is it not true he fed 5,000 with a few fish and loaves that's the kind of Adam we supposed to be because the Bible said that in him was the life of man or the light of men in other words in Jesus Christ we saw the revelation of what a real man is supposed to be like the first Adam we didn't see that but in the second Adam which was Jesus Christ himself he was a quickening spirit which was what Adam was before he was formed right and he was Jesus Christ in a body that was laid by God blood cell and everything was made by God none of that was Mary's gene and none of it was Joseph's gene Mary was the first incubator that ever hit the earth hallelujah she only carried Jesus and that's why he never called her mother he called her woman right if he had called her mother he would have been off the word a body thou have prepared for me right that was the Word of God so you said why are you saying that because we must understand that when Jesus Christ came he was the first of his creation he was God right he was the first of his kind according to revelation right he was the beginning of the creation of God somebody help me here so you got to understand now we're preparing to go to a place where only God's will live hallelujah and they will all bear the name of Jesus Christ now the Bible tells us he will receive a new name whenever that new name is we will be the same thing so you so what are you saying brother that is why let's say it like this the character of the thing is what makes the thing the character of a thing is what makes a thing right for example if you saw a cat and that cat had the nature of a dog that cat is no longer a cat it will no longer meow you know what it will do it will bark that cat will no longer be afraid of water that cat will run to the water because it has nature of a dog right so is it with the son and daughter of God though we be born in sin shapen in iniquity coming to this world speaking lies but once you are born of God the nature of God enters into you and you're no longer a sinner you become a son and daughter of God that's where the expression comes from son and daughter of God if I were a dog I produced dog if I'm a cat I produced cat if I'm a car produce car and if I'm on God I produce cars that's hard for people to understand but it is because we are of a fallen nature that's why this world is not ours there's two worlds that we working with and I spoke last week two worlds that we are working with that's the underworld and the upper world one is heaven the other one is Hell Judas came from where the underworld the Bible called him the son of perdition that means he came from hell and he went back to him if you come from God you go back to God that's why many people feel the influence of the upper world which is God they eventually get saved those who feel that pull down into hell that no matter what they see they didn't come from heaven so they can't go there you gotta come from heaven in order to go back to heaven so they pull they pull Amen that the pool is from hell you said what do you mean brother Bruce because see they were once one church all the angels worship God in the in the age of Lucifer he was called the Morningstar he was God's right-hand man but when he rebelled even before he rebelled God said I have discerned that in your heart you said you setting up to rebelled against me now that's what he said I've discerned in your heart that you have said I will exalt myself and that's that that's one of the identifications of a child of Lucifer or a man who's not been born again because they have a tendency to exalt themselves hallelujah and they exalt themselves above the Word of God there was no other reasoning there was no other thought in heaven besides God stars Lucifer was the first original perverted thought and from that dissing God never stopped him because God had something he wanted to allow Lucifer to do you cannot listen what makes a painting it's the background of the pages it's all right it's the truth the cameras that is on is what makes the picture right you can't just put a picture up there with no background right it's what you do for an example let me put it this way what makes the black letters stand out though contrasts of a white page gotcha now you understand so God had to use the contrast in order to make himself seen because no man have seen God at any time but how would we know God had he not brought in a contrast is that right he would have never known how much Adam loved her until she fell then she realized Adam sacrificed his life for her that's when even recognize what real love was all about you don't know how much a person love you until you go wrong with them or they go wrong with you that's how much you know when you're willing to forgive our even even like Adam did risk your life right so you see this is what God did that's why Jesus Christ came he was the fullness of God it's such a great love affair he shouldered and Shannon type in Adam and Eve but that was just a shadow in a type he wanted to show his creation how much he loved them that he would be willing to die himself himself he came to die himself so that his creation his wife who we are could see how much right and not only did he allow this thing that happened but God being a just God has now come to undo everything that Lucifer did y'all see what I'm saying that's why the blood of Jesus Christ is so important the blood of Jesus Christ comes and he justifies and undo everything so nobody came playing God even when they didn't have the blood of Jesus Christ they had the blood of bulls and goats and all those things those things covered you see all he needed to do all God wanted even in that day was his creation not only people to believe that he was the creator because that's where Lucifer deceived the people he made the people think that he was God is that right oh yes exactly what it was how would they have known they should have moved but Lucifer was the covering cherub you understand he was a covering cherub like the bush that covered the fire he was the covering cherub like that like this laughs that covers the real light he blocked everything he was a glorious beauty of so when people looked for God they saw Lucifer is that right jesus said when you see me you see the father see that glory was once with him but he didn't want just that he wanted the real he wanted everything but he failed to see he was just a part of creation he was not God hallelujah and so does you say ll L Li L owe him is that right that's what we are come on yes when he is named before he was Elohim which means self existent one he wanted children he had offspring and his offspring comes under the name L Li Elohim see God has children Oh somebody help me here so you got to understand if God has children he came God is holy that's my god came accepters like this there had to be a blood sacrifice since blood was the thing that caused the fall blood is to Rimini to the fall hallelujah so Christ comes he shares his pure blood right but our inheritance comes by God not just the man the god of the man Oh hallelujah and you got to understand that's why the whole family in heaven and earth is named after him listen with the book of Revelation since now we know what these things and huh I said I've done a lot more capping than I meant to do but my point is we understand that's why the Bible says according to st. John 14 1 through 14 he says let not your heart be troubled ye believe in God believe also in me in my father's house are many mansions if it were not so I would have told you I go to prepare a place for you and like I said many a times when I was in my mother's womb that was a world to me for nine months I had no need of feet I had no needs of a mouth I had no needs of eyes I had no needs of ears none of that in that room why because my mother was my ear my mother was my mouse my mother was my feet my mother was everything I needed and everything I needed she gave it to me right but I was being formed for the world to come after nine months now I'm birth into this world I don't need mama no more from that angle right I need now my eyes to see my gnosis ma'am I either hear I need to feel and see this world for myself I need to make myself around I need to define myself around in this world I learned how to walk I learn how to talk I learned how to run I learned how to jump I learned how to work I learned all those things because the character was in me everything that mama had she gave it and daddy gave it so I have a combination of both of them working in me right it was my inheritance Oh somebody help me here so if that wasn't a natural it is also in the spirit everything that's in God is in me I have the ability you have the ability to do everything Jesus did is that right that's what he said in my name they're cast out Devils you won't be casting out Devils in heaven casting out Devils only in this dimension that right there be no miracles in heaven that's why you've got to be born again now the Holy Ghost must form and shape you and mature you because we are now in the womb of the earth but one of these old days that this womb of the earth is don't give birth to two sons and daughters of God because the Bible said that the whole heaven and earth groaneth and waits for the manifestations of the sons of God it's not just the sons of God manifestation they must see the same God that was in Jesus in you and me that's what they're waiting for not just one or two now they're waiting for the manifestation those genes that generation of Jesus Christ that is now growing and maturing into him let not your heart be troubled in other words this thing is ordained to be so hmm what Jesus Christ predestinated absolutely the Bible according to st. John excuse me Genesis 3:16 3:17 noon that day and that said that the serpent shall bruise the head the heel and the seed of the woman shall bruise the head of the serpent that happened on Calvary is that right Mary said I think in Isaiah 96 that the sons of a son of God God is going to give way to a son of God is that right his name shall be called wonderful counselor the Almighty God the Prince of Peace a virgin shall conceive did a virgin conceived ooh what was her name Mary but Mary was always in the scriptures she just didn't have a name so it's a bride of Jesus Christ we have always been in the scripture but we didn't have a name until now the Bible said the whole heaven and earth is named after him him who Jesus Christ whoa predestinated we can't help be but the way we are is that right come on somebody the Bible said excuse me according to men 325 said five virgins will be wise and Phi will be foolish hmm that means amen whoever belong to the fire is predestinated to be foolish and whoever loan to the wise its predestinated to be foolish 10 virgins you know it's more than 10 y'all know what I'm saying it's just it's just a figurative that they're going to be to two kinds of believers one will be filled with the Holy Ghost and the other one will not be right now look what the prophet of God says in he says listen if we are laden with sin with unbelief because you know sin is unbelief sin is not smoking drinking lion stealing that's attributes of sin he said if we are laden with sin with unbelief with slothfulness we shall not make that rapture we know it Lord so we pray that you burn into us the Holy Ghost down in our hearts oh god said our souls afar with your blessings help us to understand God doesn't call me into judgment without first warning him that was in 1963 so the Bible tells us the coordinates Isaiah 40 and to speak comfortably to Jerusalem and crying to her that her warfare is accomplished that her iniquity is pardoned so what I'm trying to tell you the greatest revelation of this message to me is election that I and you we have been elected and chosen by God before the foundation of the world to be in this day to be called bride right that means if we have been elected and tried we may try to run we may try to hide we may do a lot of things you know brother Brown said like this she said he said it said sometimes it takes a long time for a true son of God to come recognize that he is a true son of God and there are a lot of people that's why you can't condemn them that's why you can't judge them you don't know who's who sometimes they may come to be a son of God on their deathbed but if they're chosen and elected they won't miss it they cannot miss it because God has already determined their destiny right destiny look back to what for knowledge and for another look do an election by the foreknowledge of God because he knows everything he knew you and I would choose to do right over wrong so he calms down and he gives us the grace of God opens our understanding to the revelation of who he is so that we might be saying it ain't about your study in hearing about nothing but the religion of God the mercies in grace of God so I'm comforting you tonight so that you can understand it's not by power it's not by mind but it's by my spirit saith the law hallelujah is not him that will it know he that runneth but God who shows mercy hallelujah it is because God has chosen us because he knew in that battle when Lucifer was up there we chose them to fight with Christ did y'all know that all these demons that we called Mimas used to be in the same church they've fallen angels when God kicked them out that's what they became hello so what are you saying that was the thing that Adam had yet to do he never put the devil under his foot that's why the Bible says until the enemy comes his footstool Jesus Christ is the only one that he did what the first Adam didn't do he conquered death hell and the grave he put everything under him right he Alette captivity captive he gave gifts unto men hallelujah he did everything the first Adam could not do now it is up to you because this is Satan's Eden and is up to us by the power of the Holy Ghost to put Satan under our feet under our control y'all understand me we're not on the ears under our control that is the power of this message you said what do you mean oh you better understand what I'm saying becuase winded serpent came remember brother Brandon had that vision of the serpent and that serpent came out from among the people in the waters how did he find them he didn't grab him he didn't hit him with something he spoke it he bind the serpent by the spoken word somebody help me here why because he was a son that was adopted so therefore every adopted son will have the power to bind the serpent huh that's where we're going it has to be that even when Jesus returned the Bible said out of his mouth Camus a sword a flaming sword it was the Word of God that defeated Satan even in the last battle hallelujah and you and I must understand we have been prepared that's why we're going through all the trials that's why we're going through all the tests that's why we're going through hardships that's why we're going through heartaches and then because God is trying us he's shaking us he's moving us he thought he's won't he don't want nothing to rattle hallelujah he's packing us with his virtues victory after victory at the victory at the old brothers am I going to make it I've already made it you've already mated hallelujah that's what the prophet of God when he went behind the curtain of time he said I saw you there hallelujah and if you have a theophany you will hear this message if there is a word body for you you will hear this message because when you hear this message brother and said you have heard from your theophany that means you are etern somebody help me here that means you are eternal isaiah 55:11 says so shall my word be that goes forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void that's why Jesus in this dimension when he talked to his disciples he said if you say to this mountain if you say to this mountain be thou a moving cast out into the sea what was he what was he working with hallelujah he wasn't training them for this world he was training them from the world to come oh we have no I I don't want to inject my thoughts but I tell you what I got some wonderful thoughts concerning what is gonna be like on the other side of the curtain hallelujah Oh glory to God he's a accomplished that which I please is that right he said you whatsoever you ask in my name believing that you shall receive it as it is given right and if you can speak the word with confidence knowing that it's the will of God you don't have nothing to fear God will back his word every time almost done now it should complex that which I please hit and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it hallelujah and I'm gonna use that script and clothes on it if you are the word you cannot come back to God as a failure because the word cannot come back for you understand say whatever God has purpose you to do in this dimension you got to do it there's no way you can get out of it is that right oh you can run like Jonah but when you run from God you'll find out you right in the program where God wants you to be is that right Jonah thought I'm running I ain't gonna do it ain't preaching out on God says okay I got a will prepared for you by the time I'm done you'll be right and that's how it's been that way for all of us is that right did Jonah do what God said do absolutely and he did it and caused the revival is that right now listen the Bible said he had several stars in his hand and Luther was one of them Luther was a staunch Catholic priest and God started working on Lucifer I mean Luther excuse me he's down Luther could not help it he had to rebuild it was in him to do it and when God opened that word to him the just shall live by faith he became like a house on fire on a windy day nothing can put him out hallelujah it ain't our power is his power God will set you afire you don't set yourself a fire he will set you afire you love the Lord hallelujah like I said and I'm just closing on this God word will not come back void so every seed of God that was of the lineage of the real Adam was packed away in a place called Paradise right we didn't even know paradise existed until Jesus came who was the word we didn't know where they went right but we saw there in the scripture where Abraham was Bear was his and Sarah was bear within his people in his kindred and when I got always puzzled me why would they be buried there because they're not dead they're living when they were buried in the natural they went to their the place of their father you understand me so they were all the Bible said they were all gathered together you can't be gathered together if you did you gathered together because you're living that's why God says I am the God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob is that right but he got to be the God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob and you he must become a personal revelation to you right so you and I must understand we're gathering all this places so after the resurrection when Jesus died and resurrected the Bible said he went into the region of the laws he condemned those who did not believe in Noah because he said listen it wasn't Noah voice that you heard that was my voice through Noah right it ain't we and Brandon's voice you hear is God's voice through his right it wasn't Moses voice you heard it was God's voice through Moses right that's the way God works is that right even Jesus Christ says that he doesn't speak of himself hallelujah he speak of the one that sent him he said I can't even do nothing except the father showed me hallelujah you understand me so it was God in Christ that's the mystery God in Christ not two gods but one God in one body hallelujah but they it's difficult but all I could say like this so is it must be a game God in one body though the one body be millions they have the same Holy Spirit they have the mind of Christ they'll do the works of God see you don't do the works of God when you get to heaven you do the works of God here now you're going to do things up there too right but the thing is in order to go there you must be formed and shaped like a belly baby in his mother's womb formed and shake shaped into the image of God in this womb before you go to that world right if you came from there you'll go back today if you came from hell you'll go back to hell because no matter how religious Judas was he could not come to a place where he humbled himself to get the Holy Ghost right that's what it is so you and I must understand every man and woman who do not come in this day because one time God used to weaken English ignorance about said he no longer wink because the full truth of God's Word has come and there is a word that we're preparing for little by little step by step we'll make this journey hallelujah not by power not by might but by my spirit but if you could come to see who you are then you begin to push and press toward that mom like Paul says and you know I want to say it like this the press that we always think like this it's not that it's yielding your will to God lest an oh oh oh [Music] [Music] [Applause] we are marching to the roof we are marching to the roof where we are we are marching marching marching we are marching marching marching we are marching to the roof we marching oh we are marching to the roof amen you love the Lord anybody is our prayer God is still real is not [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] I had the Saints on every hey are
