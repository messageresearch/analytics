your fellowship with us in jesus christ amen [Music] amen let's turn our bible to the book of jeremiah [Music] chapter 7 verse 1 to verse 14. jeremiah chapter 7 verse 1 to verse 14. and when the bible says the word that came to jeremiah from the lord saying stand in the gate of the lords of the of the lord's house and proclaim these words and say hear the word of the lord all ye of judah that enter the entry in this gates to worship the lord thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel amend your ways and your doings and i will cause you to dwell in this place trust you not in lying words saying the temple of lord the temple of the lord the temple of the lord are this for if you truly amend your ways and your doings if you truly execute judgment between a man and his neighbor if you oppress not the stranger the fatherless and the widow and shed not innocent blood in in this place neither neither walk after after other gods to you to your heart then will i cause you to dwell in this place in the land that i give to your fathers forever and ever verse 8 behold you trust in lying words that cannot profit will will you steal murder and commit adultery and swear falsely and burn incense and to bow and walk after other gods whom you know not and come and stand before me in this house which is called by my name and say we are delivered to all to do all these abominations is is this house which is called by my name become a den of robbers in your eyes behold even i have seen it saith the lord but go ye now unto my place which was in shiloh where i set my name at the first and see what i did to to and see what i did to it for the wickedness of my people israel verse 13 and now because you have done all these works saith the lord and i speak unto you rising up early and speaking but you heard not and i called you but you answered not verse 14 therefore will i do unto this house which is called by my name wherein you trust and unto the place which i gave to you and your fathers as i have done to shiloh the next chapter chapter 8 verse 5 to um to 7 the bible says that why then is this people of jerusalem slid back by a proportion of backsliding they hold fast to see the refusal return i hearkened and heard but they spake not a right no man repented him of his wickedness saying what have i done everyone turned to this out up i mean to his course as the horse rushes into the bottle yeah the stork in the heaven knoweth her appointed time and the turtle and the crane and the swallow observe the time of their coming but my people know not the judgment of the lord we can jump to verse 19 of the same chapter the bible says that behold the voice of the lord i behold behold the voice of the cry of the daughter of my people because because of them that dwell in a foreign country is not the lord in zion is not her king in her why have they why have they provoked me to anger with their craving images and with strange vanities the harvest is passed the summer is ended and we are not saved for the hurt of the daughter of the daughter of my people and my hurt i am black astonishment has taken hold on me is there no bombing gaelic is there no physician there why then is no where then is why then is not the health of my daughter of my people recovered amen we may be seated i mean i actually had another message that i wanted to bring this uh tonight but when i came to the office i was reading my bible and then the lord led me to bring this message so i kind of had like two hours to get ready for it so by the grace of god i pray that god will help me you know deliver everything you give me amen i will entitle it where are you adam or adam where are you amen because if we read in genesis chapter 3 verse 9 to 13 the bible says that and the lord called ed and adam and said unto him where are thou and he said i heard divorce in the garden and i was afraid because i was naked and i hid myself and he said who told thee that thou was naked has thou eaten of the tree where elf i thee that thou should not eat and the men say the woman whom they'll give us to be with me she gave me of the tree and i did eat and the lord said and the lord god said unto the woman what is this that thou has done and the woman said the serpent begotted me and i did eat it amen if we look uh in this chapter of genesis amen in other words it was a judgment you know god was judging adam and eve you know the word before god got judging them but if you read closely you'll under you'll see that adam and eve instead of repenting it meant they didn't repent but they were accusing one another i mean you see that adam was accusing the white uh i mean his wife and the wife and eve was accusing the devil i mean was accusing the serpent amen they were accusing one another none of them was able to uh uh accept what he did none of them was able to say that lord you know you're right we did this this was wrong and now we repent lord we pray that you forgive us amen none of them say that but one all of them wanted to show to god how good they were amen they weren't to say but lord i didn't respect your word but because you gave me this woman amen she's the one who led me to do this and the woman said lord lord i was good i mean if you didn't create the serpent i wouldn't do it amen none of them you know accepted you know whatever they did wrong but because they were under the grace of god and when god was able to give them grace i mean not to kill them because before that god told them that the day that you will eat from this tree that same day that that'll be the day that you guys will die but because they were under the grace because that covenant was under the grace amen god didn't kill them but god provided a way meant for them to leave but then after that you know in exodus chapter 19 then you will find out that that that is where the children of israel rejected grace amen this chose low over grace so now therefore everything bad that we're doing god had to judge them judge them according to everything that they were doing amen amen that's why you see that here jeremiah he's called he's talking to god gave that word to the to jeremiah to go tell the children of israel that you you have done something bad and you have heard the lord but none of you is coming to repent so therefore these are the cursing or these are the you know these are all the curses that will come to you if you don't repent amen you will see that god there is i think i think in jeremiah chapter 4 and when god told them to come back you know to come back to them but they didn't repent but instead they went they make stones or they make gods out of stones and out of trees and they started to worship those gods and all those scenes you know were you know increasing in god's eyes and god couldn't you know god couldn't accept it anymore and then he gave that word to jeremiah to go warn the people of jerusalem to go warn the people of israel that you know this is the sin that you guys have done so now it's time to repent you have to repent but though that were though all of them were warned but none of them you know received those words and then none of them you know came back to the lord and then uh uh uh repented uh because if you read and i think in jeremiah chapter five you know god told jeremiah that if i even found if i found even one one servant or one person who uh who respects the word of god who follows the word of god i will spare the entire city amen but he couldn't find any because all of them they were you know all doing the same things that's why god you know gave this word and then god told them that you know since you guys don't since uh my people don't respect everything that i say to them amen i would do to them the same thing that i did to shiloh amen so now we have to find about what what did god do to shiloh will you find it in first samuel chapter 4 verse 7 to 10. when the bible says that and the philistines were afraid for the saint the goddess come into the camp and they said woe unto us for there has not been such a thing here here here too for will unto us who shall deliver us out of the hand of this mighty god uh these are these are the gods thus smoth the egyptians with all the plagues in the wilderness be strong and quit yourselves like man oh ye philistines that ye be not servants unto the hebrews as they have been to you quit yourself like request yourselves like man and fight and the philistine fought and israel was meeting and deflate every man into his den and there was a very great slaughter for their for their fail uh for the fellow of israel 30 000 foot men i mean if you read in this chapter in the beginning you'll see that you know israel were in the but there wasn't a battle they bottled between israel and the philistines but the thing that happened that the israel were sinning i mean they had those scenes that they didn't confess amen they were doing things that god was not pleased with but when the battle came they thought that well ever since you know where every time we bring the ark every time we fight god god always gives us victory so this will be the same routine so this will be the same god it will still give us our victory amen you'll see that the first before the before getting this arc amen they're starting fighting and then they started there was they were losing the fight so they went back to the city to take the the ark saying believing that god will still be with him but but they forget that their lives were not worthy you know of the their lives were not worthy of having the ark you know with them you know even though the presence of the lord was there but their lives didn't reflect amen the presence of the lord so when the lord came i mean when the ark came all the philistines were trembling all the fields and you know they were afraid because they know what god is able to do amen the philistine didn't deny what god has done to them before amen the first time even told them you know what god has done you know with them you know when what god has done to these the egyptians you know telling them that you know all the plagues and all the curses he sent to uh to pharaoh and his people but though those people you know they had they had the ark they had god between them but their lives were not worthy you know or in other words they had god was there but they didn't welcome god amongst them so god couldn't give them the victory they were looking for amen because god was not there because the people refused to to repent from their sins and they got used to god amen it was like it was like a habit amen every time we go to pray to fight and man we have the ark and we always have victory so this will be the same thing they did it yesterday they thought that you know it'll be the same thing but i forgot one thing that those things had uh uh i had a condition i mean their lives had to be their lives had to be ready first i mean their lives had to be prepared even to have that bottle to go to that bottle amen that's why you'll see that joshua and the others they were telling them that before you fight you have to get you have to be aware you know far from your wife you don't have to you know there are there were certain things that they couldn't do because you know before fighting amen because they had to keep themselves sacred in other words amen and then we see that that's the same thing sometimes with us i mean in the church amen people will come to church and man they think that god is in the church god god is always there when we invite him but by they come you know because god acted yesterday they think that the same god will act today amen of course god will act but first of all we have to look at ourselves first amen we have to look at the condition of our heart first if that god even he's worthy to come and dwell inside of us amen we have first to repent and then clear our life clean our lives you know and then god you know let god wash us amen because you will see that uh the first time god had the passover the children of israel had a passover amen god required moses to tell the children of israel to keep the living out of their homes amen he told he told them to keep those 11 i mean 11 7 i think seven days you know the seven days the 11 had to be uh uh um they couldn't they were not supposed to have the leaven inside of their home amen the living represents sin amen it was something sacred that god was going to do even god was going to save their lives and man in order for god to save their lives it meant their home had to be sacred first amen they had to get rid of all those sins that they was doing that they were doing they had to get rid of you know all the things that was going to stop god from doing whatever he was doing amen that's why you see that in matthew chapter 21 verse 12 to 14 and when jesus was going to the temple and then he saw people selling stuff and you know the church wasn't it was not in order amen the church became a marketplace i mean you saw people changing money all those stuff the first thing before healing the people he started first to you know to uh um i mean to to kick those people out of the the place amen he started to put things in order first and then you will see that in verse 14 after doing all of that amen the bible said that and the blind and the lame came to him in the temple and and then he healed them amen before healing them he head first to put everything in order and when the bible says that and jesus went into the temple of god and cast out all them because they are all them that sold and bought in the temple and overthrew the tables of the money changers and and the seats of them that sold the sold and said unto them it is written my house shall be called the house of prayer but ye have made it again of a den of thieves and then and then verse 14 and the blind and the lame came to him in the temple and healed them amen jesus knew that he had to heal those people jesus knew they had to give side to those blind man but he couldn't do it you know it went those place when that place was not in order amen he couldn't do it because that place didn't receive god in other words that god wasn't among them amen that's why he had first to fix those things before god being there amen you will see the same thing you know with joshua and and joshua and i think i forgot the other uh soldier name who uh took uh i think a quote from um uh uh who took a quote that didn't belong to him i think i can't i can do something there amen amen they had the sin the sin was among them and then you know even though god gave the vision to joshua that none of them would lose their lives but since somebody in between them i mean his life was not in order to go fight amen they started losing their lives because you know something was wrong that's why you see that joshua when he saw that something was wrong he had to stop people from fighting amen and then fix first of all the scene that was between them amen and when the soul and when they killed the uh i think they can and it can when they kill aiken and then you know everything will solve amen you see the same thing came with jesus amen one is so uh when you went to that house where the young lady amen the young girl was was that younger died amen people the crowd was inside there when jesus said to them that this young girl is not dying i mean she didn't die she's asleep even people started laughing at jesus amen in other words that people was were not believing that jesus was able to raise that girl from i mean from the girls that raised raise raise her up amen by what jesus had to do jesus had to kick them out first and then jesus had to tell them to go out first to leave the room so that god will operate amen jesus amen had to tell them first of all amen but everybody in that house had to be in one accord amen everybody in that house had to believe in one thing everybody in that house even had to have one one purpose amen they all have to have one goal that you know of that girl being being uh resurrected amen that's why you see that the prophet said that when the church of god amen will come all united will come and then we'll be all united consecrated in christ amen every sin person that will enter into god's church amen that sin will be called out amen every wrong spirit that will be inside of the church that spirit will be called that why because the people will be all together amen having one purpose amen having one goal without god will be to serve god amen and that's why you see that every time that that jesus and all that every time that god wanted to do something good and then the sin was in the camp and he head first to clean that out first and then the prophet says that that uh it's proved that god is visiting the people today god is in his church trying to purge the thing take help the living out of it he's sending me he's sending messenger uh he's sending messengers uh messengers he's sending messengers he's sending signs and wonders and miracles and everything trying to prove that he loves them and he wants them to clean up get rid of get rid of uh get get rid of this here all this carrying on staying home on wednesday night from prayer meeting to look at this old silly stuff of all of an old woman from hollywood married four or five times and some guy that's uh and some guy that is run some guy that runs with half the woman on the worst on the west coast and who loves lucy's and and and all the things like that and you christian people stay home to see that to see that and stay away from the house of god it shows what kind of a spirit is in you amen the prophet says that here god is god god is trying to take that that spirit out amen god is trying to purge those those things you know out of the church amen because we have one purpose amen the purpose is to make the uh uh to be raptured and before being raptured amen god god will have first to clean up amen all the mess even god will have first to fix everything because that is the same thing that god told moses amen before the the the first exodus he told them he told moses to tell the children of israel to clean the house amen he tell the children of israel amen how to behave amen during those certainly those specific times amen he told the children of israel what to do he told them to apply the blood amen but before applying the blood they have first to take all the leaven out of their homes amen and also we are getting ready for our third exodus amen we are getting ready to be raptured and then the prophet says that before that happens amen three things has to happen first amen god has to send a prophet amen with a message and then god has to vindicate that message you know with the pillar of fire and then god has to give a token amen and then by before doing the amend our house has to be cleaned first amen the prophet here says that notice that the preparation of for his promised land uh for his promised land people know this he did first first he had had he had the people that that he made that he made a land for a land for them he had prepared a land for them and now he sent down there he sent down their preparation for it for the promised land people it was only for those who were predestinated to that promised land bright day and how he done it he sent a prophet with a message identified with the by a pillar of fire and gave a token that they could rest assured that it was right that's right it was her consolation amen and then we see that in our last days amen god did the same thing amen god sent us a prophet amen that prophet was vindicated amen and then god gave us the token which is the holy spirit amen but to receive those who by to receive that sign or to have the holy spirit amen inside of amen we have first to go you know through you know those cleaning period or the the cleaning you know steps with god you know god has to purge us first amen god has to amen take all those livings you know the living out of our out of our homes amen god has to clean us first we have to be worthy amen to be called christian amen we have to be worthy amen to be called a man christian because we see that the first time that that word was pronounced it meant it wasn't called you know but those people were not just regular people amen those people were not just people who were going and drink and smoke and and laugh and do all those stuff amen but those people it meant something in them was was particular even something in them you know made other people to see that these are christ-like amen these these people are behaving like christ amen these people are talking like christ these people are walking like christ amen that's why they were called christians amen that's why amen that's the that's what god you know want us to be that's where you know he want us to be amen to be those people amen who who are the light of the world amen who are the salt who will give to this world the the server amen who will give to this world the taste amen that this word is lost amen that's why you see that god was calling adam saying adam where are you where are you amen where are you i have planes i have plans that i have made for you amen where are you and then in this last time amen after all those sinning has happened after everything that we have done even god is still calling for us amen because we are the sons and daughters of god amen we are those adams amen in this life in this light a hand time and god is calling for us where are where are we amen but now this time that when god is calling for us it's not a time to go before god and start giving you know accusing another or to say the lord because i wasn't in a good church that's why i'm behaving like this oh lord because my my parents didn't believe in the message that's the reason why i'm here amen but god is giving us every one of us an opportunity amen to go before him and to repent even god has given us many opportunity to go before him when he's calling us adam where are where are you amen you have to come to him and say lord hear my lord i'm naked lord this is i did the exact same the thing that you didn't you told me not to do that's why i'm naked i mean it's not a time to go you know starting accusing you know people to say that lord if you give me a good wife maybe i will i could have you know kept the word or i'll be a good husband but lord but but you know it's now a personal time that you have to respond to god amen you'll be judged you know with the thing that you i did you know yourself i mean god is calling adam where are you amen somebody has to respond amen somebody has to tell him you know lord here i am i did this and you know this was wrong and i did it and lord i'm asking for your forgiveness and when the prophet says that the people is just afraid of this new birth that's all they're afraid to come to it because it'll straighten them up it'll make you quit playing bingo quit playing these slot machines it'll make you quit staying home on wednesday night from prayer meeting to watch we love susie that's right it up and all and all those uh uh other crazy things that hollywood has got and them dirty jokes that's that cracked over over there it'll make you let your hair grow out long it'll make you act like like a lady it'll make you it'll make a man quit smoking cigarettes then being in in church as deacons then being in church as deacons it'll make the people quit lying stealing it'll do something for you it'll clean you up and give you a salvation that there is nothing in the world can expand it away from can expand can expanding the word from you because you because you know you were there when it happened yes sir you said that that's why the holy spirit when it comes to us that's what it will do but the sad thing is that people don't want it amen it's like it's like you know in uh uh thinking uh said second kings chapter one amen this king i forgot his name amen that he knew he knew for he knew the king the king of israel he knew for sure that god was there but when he fell down he went to luke we went to bills about amen to get his healing amen and then god sent elijah telling him that why did you what did you have to go there amen did you not know that god is present amen did you not know that god is able to heal did you not know that god is able to fix you amen but therefore since you went to these other gods amen that you will fall down of your bed and then you will die amen god god has provided a way for us god has provided a way amen for our salvation but you'll see that people are trying to take a shortcut or people are trying to go to other gods or to doing something that god didn't prepare oh god he knew taking other route that god didn't provide him amen but god is calling us to go back to come back to him amen because he has good plans he has good things amen here you see that jeremiah is asking why amen why my i the daughter of you know why the people are not healed amen why did the daughters you know are still i mean the daughters of my city i'll see still hurt amen why the daughters amen why the sin is still in the camp amen why you know we don't see you know a god man being manifest in the church anymore amen why the church has become so cold amen why amen we don't see miracles why we don't see prophecies and and why we don't see people being filled with the holy spirit anymore amen why i mean he has to we have to have an answer for it amen and then if you're trying to look at it you will see that somewhere down the line every down the line amen we let the devil come into our house amen we started fellowshipping with the devil amen we see that somewhere you know down the line amen we started amen uh uh um it meant enter entertaining amen the devil man we started entertaining entertaining entertaining amen those bad spirits amen when the first came to our lives we said well i mean this is only we do it just for once and then it'll be gone amen you do it today and then tomorrow if you see yourself doing the same thing and then as long as you don't kick those spirit out amen those spirits will come and then call their friends and call the thing and then they will create you know and a lie and then come and then attack you amen that's the same thing that the prophet says the amen when you being delivered from something and then you don't replace that thing with god amen that same spirit will go out and call seven out of the strong spirit amen come and dwell with you know in you amen but why you know why why we don't see those things anymore why you know the book of acts and everything that god did in the book of acts why we don't see it anymore between us christians amen especially us who are called you know who we say that we have in the we we in the message amen we have believed you know the message of the hour we have all the gifts and everything but why don't we see all those things amen is god dead amen or but we know for sure that god is not dead but that has to mean that you know something is wrong with us amen before seeing those things amen we have first you know to fix ourselves first before it got started acting amen but you know that's what jeremiah was asking why amen he has told the children of israel that god was alive even the children of israel has seen you know god manifesting amen they were in egypt it meant god you know with pharaoh for 400 years amen god showed them the way god showed them that he was still there amen they were there in uh uh in the wilderness amen god showed them that he was still alive but when they get out when they got out of the wilderness amen they went back to their old behaviors amen they crossed they crossed the red sea amen all those children crossed the red sea and after joshua amen they thought that everything was going to be fine but down the line even they started repeating the same mistakes that their father was the fathers were doing amen they knew exactly what god has done to their fathers but the children came back and they started doing the same thing and now here uh jeremiah is he's asking himself about why he meant jeremiah you know found himself you know he said about lord i preached exactly what you told me to tell these people lord i say every word i repeated every word that you tell me to tell these people about why is there about about what about why you know about why there is not but by why the health of the daughters of my city my people is not you know he's not recovered why you know jeremiah you know was asking himself why because he looked at his life amen he looked at his life and he looked at everything that he talked to those people said lord myself i don't blame myself for not saying them anything lord i told them everything that you told me to do you know i tell them everything that you told me to say but why is there no bomb and kill it is there no physician there is there no god who can start healing the people is there no holy spirit who can fill up who can fill the church amen but why why my people is not being healed amen we have to answer to those questions amen everybody every one of us a man has an answer amen for why why those things it's not happening you know somewhere you let one spirit you know i don't know and i don't need to know what spirit but yourself you know amen if you go back to your life and you start starting your life amen you study your life you know how you first started you know when you first got the holy spirit and where and where you are now amen you will see that amen but for most people you know you'll see that when you first got the holy spirit amen you were all on fire amen amen you you know you were going to church every day and praying and reading the bible and studying the word amen you were burning the holy spirit was bending inside of you but after four years after receiving the holy spirit of four years instead of that fire increasing but now you think that that fire is decreasing amen the fire is being oh he's being amen that fire amen there is no room or there is no oxygen for that fire he meant to uh uh uh to burn as as he was supposed to burn that means that something is wrong amen that means that you know there is something wrong something is is to something is wrong that is keeping that fire from burning out amen we have to find an answer for it amen and then after finding the answer we have to go to god and say lord forgive us lord and we come to you lord and repent and then after that you will see god acting again amen and the prophet said that now i believe that we're living in in the days where otherwise in the uh we're living the days that uh the prophecy that the days that we're living in should cause the church to go completely into desperation i believe since the message this morning from god amen that message was a token i mean he said that since the message this morning from god not me i believe he ought to throw the entire congregation into desperation that we have played long enough we went we we've went to church long enough we've got to do something how is it that we can't see other great signs and wonders done on others and what about us what about us it should cause any state of desperation that we are determined that we are determined before god the signs of his coming should bring this entire congregation when we've read it when we've read it from the word the holy spirit has told us go at a certain place such and such such and such things will happen not tell us what it was but he will happen we go there it happens that way the newspapers pocket the magazines package show the picture of it come back here and see those great mysteries hidden in the bible opened us to us on the new fear that we never know before and perfectly blames in the coming of the lord jesus amen you know we have to we have to be in that state of desperation amen the church has to be in that state of desperation where you know you will say to god lord i rather you know if if you don't give me the holy spirit just kill me take me you know take my life away if you don't want to fill me with the holy spirit amen we have to be in that place it means like jacob amen he's so deaf coming to him and says the lord i will not leave you until you change my name amen this has to be the prayer of every one of us amen that lord i will not leave you until you change me lord i will not leave you until something inside of me has been changed lord i'm tired of being this old sinner you know lord i'm tired of being you know this whole christian that people know you know this christian that doesn't go forward and still you know everest is a step in this you know in this situation lord i can't get rid of it lord ever since you know this scene has has it has changed me lord i can't get out of it lord ever since i've been you know in prison lord i can't get away from it lord ever since i've been changed by this behavior lord i can't get rid of it but lord this is the time now is the day this is the hour of my deliverance lord this is the hour where i need you lord to come in me and to set me free from all those spirits you set me free from everybody things that i did amen and then god would do it for us amen as long as we're desperate and not desperate enough amen that's what that's the church that's the thing that the church is missing amen the church is missing desperation amen to come to god as if you're dying tomorrow and when you say that lord this is my last chance lord lord i wanted god lord i want you to come to me and lord i want you to feel me and when the prophet says here my friends i don't i don't want to hurt feelings but i am responsible for a message and that message but that message is come out of this mess and if i ask you to come out where am i gonna take you to would that take you to brotherham tabernacle it is as much as for it is as much fault as any of rest of the rest of them but there is one place i can take you to where you're safe where you're saved and protected from death that's in jesus christ god's place of worship that's the place i'm introducing to you tonight where god put his name where he promised he will meet every person that comes that could come in there he would worship uh he will worship with him and fist with him that's in christ that place is in christ not in no church no tabernacle but in christ he is god's tabernacle he is the place that god came into it they came into himself and came into himself and dwell and dwelt in him this is my beloved son in whom i am pleased to dwell in there is where there's where that is where god the the word god tabernacled uh uh bro his name and placed it upon jesus christ therefore his name was put in a man his son jesus christ in which he tabernacled himself and in that tabernacle amen that's where god wants to bring us amen in his own son jesus christ amen that's that's the only provided way for us amen that's the only place of worship amen that's the only place that we can find our deliverance amen that's the only place we can find the forgiveness of our sins amen that's the only place amen we can find amen the joy that joy unspeakable full of glory amen that's the only place we can find all the blessings amen that's the only place we can find everything we've been looking for everything we've been dreaming of everything that this bible has been telling us about amen that's the only place that we can find it amen everything that the prophet has been telling us about amen amen about that city even if that's sitting where himself is alive about about all the joy man being in heaven we'll be singing and and praising his name and all the glorious things that we have heard amen to find it the only place to find us in jesus christ amen you can't find it outside of him and you have to be in him amen to find it is the unshakeable kingdom amen when the when the earth and heaven will pass away amen his word will not pass away amen his word is the unshakeable kingdom where every one of us has to run into amen that's the only place we'll be safe amen it's like nowhere with the ark amen everybody could have created their own art amen the ark of noah was the only ark where salvation was provided amen to be saved you had to run to this ark enter in there and not no don't go out until until the place is dry amen that's the same place i mean that's the same thing with us amen jesus christ is he is our ark this way tonight tonight amen amen you can go and and people can promise you you know you know happy life people can promise you all the good stuff and man people can promise you a man a happy life you know you will have cars you will have you know homes and you will have houses you will have money and all that by the joy amen is found in jesus amen the true joy him and it's found in him so that's what we have to run into him we have to let him amen come inside of us because he's knocking at the door you know wanted somebody to open his house amen to open the doors of his life so that he can come in amen he's calling us where are you adam adam where are you amen we see that paul said that the nature is groaning looking for the sons of god where are you amen jesus is looking for us where are you adam amen where are you amen i know he's telling us that i know you have sinned i know you have done all those bad things that i told you not to do amen i do i know that you have done you know things that you know you were not supposed to do i know that you know you did everything that you know that i told that i say in my word that you're not supposed to do i know that you've been hanging out with the people or with the things that you were not supposed to do but where are you you know at least you know we have to come to him and show ourselves available amen because he can't force us to do something because if he force us to do it amen he will have he will have to resurrect everybody that he killed in sodom and gomorrah amen to to offer them the same grace amen but he is calling us he's calling us where are we amen we have to respond amen like samuel you know god was calling him samuel samuel him and samuel when he went to a lie amen amen elias told him that this time when he calls you say lord hear am i and speak amen god has been calling us for a long time amen we've been you know hearing god's word in our hearts and man if we come to church every day and we hear god's word about why our lives is not still changing amen why in the church we still have those problems that we're not you know those problems that were not supposed to be in the church amen why in a church there is sealed divisions and people you know these people not this brother not talking to this brother or this sister not talking to this history amen we were called to to a higher purpose amen we are called to a higher purpose we all call amen to do something great amen we are called to be united amen the united bride of christ amen where we all have one common goal is to amen to be the brother of christ is to see him in amen where there is no divisions among us where love abounds amen where love you know is the is the the you know uh uh love is the common you know we love is the coming you know we are all in the common ground which is love amen that's what that's where we need to be amen that's where we need to be amen we asked ourselves why amen why my prayers are not being answered anymore amen why i don't feel god as i used to feeling amen why i feel god has been decent to me these days amen why although they're all those why's a man you are you know you'll see you know the answer i mean sometimes we're just too afraid to go and do a dig a big study of our lives i mean sometimes we're just too scared to go and then and then think about you know what the things that we have done and think about you know why we have caused that spirit that holy spirit to be quiet amen you see that in the message i think the day of the prophet says that the prophet said that wherever the holy spirit left you amen that's the same place he will find you amen you just have to go back to that same place in other words that you have to repent you know that thing that you did that caused the holy spirit to go out or to fly away man you have to repent so that the holy spirit comes back amen wherever that holy spirit left you man that's the same place that we you have to go but you have to know where did the holy spirit left amen and then the only place to find any men is to go to god to to cross himself amen the only place to find a man to go to him himself say lord you know i've done so many things as you know other things that i don't remember but lord here i am lord i'm asking for you to forgive me and god will always forgive us amen if we can stand and [Applause] amazing grace and i'm amazing where it shall always be my son of praise shalom always be my song of praise and he was grace thy [Music] i do not know just why he came to love me so he looked beyond [Music] [Music] amazing grief always be my song of praise grace [Music] i do not know [Music] just why he came to love me [Music] foreign [Music] to view the cross where jesus died for me [Music] he looked beyond [Music] amen god gave us this grace he meant that he wanted to sacrifice his only begotten son he meant to give us the life that none of us was worthy of amen he bled and died he suffered all the pains that we were supposed to suffer and when he took our lives he took our place it meant we were supposed to be the people were supposed to be on that cross crying for life crying for help crying for water he meant crying for somebody to take all those nails away from us but he took our place he went and died for us [Music] and then in return he's only asking us for one thing to accept him amen is not asking us for something that is harder or something you know that he knows that we can't do it but he's only asking us for one thing to accept him amen is only asking us to believe the work that he did for us amen that he's only asking us to accept the blood that is shared on calvary for us amen and we if we accept him he that calvary the sacrifice that was made on calvary it meant something inside of us will change amen because the prophet says that he has never seen somebody going to calvary and come back as he went something has to happen inside of you amen and that thing that has to happen depends on you it depends on your attitude amen you will either be cursed or you will be blessed amen there is only two things everything just depends on your attitude everything depends on the gift if you accept it or you don't accept it and the prophet says that the grace is grace when it's accepted as grace but that same grace becomes a judgment amen if it's not accepted as grace it's been if it's been rejected and when he came for his brothers they rejected him and and then he became a judgment for them amen and then he came for us gentiles and if we reject him it would become a judgment for us but now here he is he's asking us adam where are we amen it's a time where we can go to him and ask him the lord here we are lord lord i know i'm not worthy to be called your son but i know i'm not worthy to be called a christian because my life is not even worthy but i'm not even worthy to call your name because i'm i'm filled with you know bad things and bad spirit and things that you know that myself i'm ashamed of but lord but here i am because you're calling me and then you tell just be honest with you amen that's the only thing that he requires is honest amen to tell him that lord by myself i can't make it oh god but i need you lord i need your help i need you to hold my hand and to help me stand because without you i will fall amen dear heavenly father [Music] but we've heard your word of father god but you know that lord when i came when i was driving down here father god in my head i didn't
