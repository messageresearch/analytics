a little warm in here I know I got a three piece on and that makes it even warmer but by the grace of God we thank the Lord for his goodness and his grace appreciate everything that the Lord is doing for us glad to everybody happy everybody here tonight amen I made up my mind to go that way the rest of my life Hallelujah we'll try not to be long tonight uh we kind of started a little message there in Iowa City and just a little interval something to kind of stick in between what I've been preaching early about the the Order of Things because I really believe that when um the seals were open uh things changed in such a mighty way that I believe that a lot of people have not as of yet understood uh what What's really happening not that I'm some brilliant person but uh I I really see that we're now living in the time of translation and and I know there are certain things that the bride must do the bride makes herself ready and this is the most serious time ever in the history of what we call the bride age because we realize that man brother Branham tells us he said that the the the the the the wise and the foolish versions were made out of the same material but there was a a a a cutting that God used to bring out the bride so we trusting that all of us are bride tonight and uh I believe that there's something pulling on you something that calls you to come out and uh so we hope that that the service tonight will be a blessing to you we're going to read from Ephesians the third chapter uh beginning at the 14th verse Ephesians 3 14-21 and then we'll go to a revelation 1 and 8. uh it's it's a beautiful situation uh what God is doing and uh but at the same time it is a time uh you know if your if your eyes are not set on Jesus it will be a frightening time of time of fear and the word of God said perfect love casts out fear uh in the sense that because we have an assurance and that Assurance is the promises of God and God is never going back on his promises and this is what I love about the word Ephesians 3 we're going to read from the 14th through the 21st verse for this cause I bow my knees unto the father of our Lord Jesus Christ of whom the whole family in Heaven and Earth is named that we would Grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the Inner Man now take note to that strengthen with might by his spirit in the inner man that's important because that's the part of you that God is perfecting that Christ May dwell in Your Heart by faith that ye being rooted and grounded in love that Christ May dwell in your hearts by what faith and faith is a revelation that God gives you because you can't have faith without God giving it to you that ye being rooted and grounded in love faith and twin faith and love is our twins may be able to comprehend with All Saints what is the breath and the length and depth and height now that's amazing and to know the love of Christ which passeth knowledge that you might be filled with all the fullness of God I love that now unto him that is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think according to the power that worketh where in US unto him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages World Without End Amen Revelations 1 and 8. glad to see y'all tonight Revelations 1 8 I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and the ending saith the Lord which is and which was and which is to come the almighty here you find Elohim switching and coming into a natural existence which is which was which is to come and you find out in another scripture in the Book of Revelations he said I am the first and I am the last let us pray our heavenly father we come before you Lord Jesus we thank you for your Amazing Grace we thank you for being so good to us you have been better to us than words can express lord it's every day every day I appreciate your blood I appreciate that place where I can go and ask for forgiveness and ask for your grace and ask for your mercy because Lord without that where would we be thank you Lord Jesus for your Amazing Grace father I pray that you would bless Every Soul here tonight in a special way in your lovely name Jesus Christ we pray amen you may be seated that we preached there in Iowa City the power of His grace brings us to our knees and as I said uh this is uh maybe if you want to say a two-part but I I know one thing about uh Grace his grace brings us to uh his presence uh that is to worship Him because remember in the beginning when Adam and Eve fell it broke uh the the fellowship it broke that that place where we could really worship God it brought in a breach and um but Calvary was our Victory it gave us an Open Door uh to his order again uh we of course uh at the end of all times you and I know that the world is falling apart as as the prophet of God preached it but now we see it more so than ever before in every aspect we find that uh the the the everything is falling apart brother mannum tells us how that things have been so hybrid hybrided that uh uh everything is is out of uh it is it's a it's uh original order but he said now the church though she is hybrid she will not completely Fade Out uh when Jesus come because when he comes he finds the church in a lukewarm condition and we know about the grace of God that the church is supposed to be on fire and this fire is something that only God can light he's the only one that can set you on fire amen but and all of that comes to his grace now none of us Grace is as I said the last time is the uh uh unmerited favor of God it is the thing that God gives us and the reason why he gives us this grace is because we are a part of him amen knowing all things uh he in this message said we didn't willfully just fall into this but we were tricked into it and we know by God's grace that we are now um how can I say it you you save your best for last uh it just what we do I used to run track when I was in high school and when you run a relay you put the fastest man uh really at the end you put him put a fast person at the beginning but you also put a faster person at the end just in case amen someone in between slows it down that one guy at the end can pick it up and bring it to a completion or to a complete Victory and what God has done in this last day he chose us we didn't choose him he chose us but I wonder in in the mind of God he's not surprised but I I just wonder how he's looking looking at us seeing that he sent us a prophet and when brother Brown was on the scene uh the Bride of Jesus Christ was on fire uh but we see as he moved off the scene things took place within the bride and you know it it happens to every Church age uh you know when the messenger is there everybody is on fire then after the messenger leaves we have these Renegade preachers we have people coming in with their own ideas we have people coming amen and miskers growing what what what was previously taught by doing this it literally hybrids the word it brings us down you say well brother Brooks it's not intentional but what we must realize Paul said it like this I must die to everything I thought I knew all of his teachings all of the things that Paul was taught he had to die to it all can you imagine I was telling this to somebody the other day I said here was Paul coming out of a Jewish uh uh tradition uh we want to save Faith but it was their own faith it wasn't the original Faith because had it been the original Faith they would have identified or knew who Jesus Christ was but because of their going down into Babylon when Jesus came they brought some of the Traditions back with them and when Jesus came to Jerusalem he found his own church standing in a place of hierarchy you had the Bishops and you had the Pharisees and the Sadducees and you you you had a church that were ruled by men and not by God and so much so Jesus called them blind lead us and he said if the blind leader leads the blind their boats shall fall in the ditch Hallelujah you and I must understand that the word of God is the word of God it cannot change it will always produce what he said he will produce and if there isn't some if something is hindering the producing of the word it is not God it is our revelation of it or maybe it is something we have added to it because remember amen God says every word is a seed and it's a life seed and will always bring forth of his kind Hallelujah is that right brother random even said he said education is the greatest enemy of the cross of Christianity amen because what we do Amen in our education we try to educate the people into the Holy Ghost that's exactly what the Pentecostals did that's what all the other ages did instead of staying with the blueprint we tried to educate them into the Holy Ghost okay you say well what do you mean they educated them say by saying if you speak in tongues you have the Holy Ghost and nowhere in the word says that you see they added that little thing and that very thing has brought death to the Pentecostal world Hallelujah and whenever we bring our Creeds our darkness and and anything like that into the message it literally brings us back to a place of death now you say well why are you saying it like this because look at the Pentecostals they used to have tongues interpretation of tongues prophecies they had healings they had people that was on fire they had all prayer all night they were they were called crazy because of their love for God y'all hear what I'm saying they were truly on fire but when they began to organize and separate when they began to divide who's right and who's wrong here was a trinitarian he was in Jesus name and God gave them both the Holy Ghost but how do you know that because brother Bradham said so right but they made a difference and when when they divided like that it it it it it it it hybrided the word because God did not call us to be divided matter of fact he taught brother vanon preached a message that the invisible Union of the bride and he talks about how we are to be connected with him not with a society not with the church not with anything that that appears to to look holy right because nothing could look more holy than the Pharisees and the Sadducees Hallelujah but when John saw them he said you are dead men bones he said how would you appear to be white and septica but inwardly your dead men bones Hallelujah and and brother Branham comes along and he tells the Pentecostals you're dead they didn't like the idea of him telling them that because according to their teachings they could shout they could dance they could speak in tongues they could run up and down the aisle but that was not what declared unto them that they had life only the word can give life and they had it for a season but when the light of the word came when God sent Malachi 4. amen and when they refused that word immediately they died and you know I know what I'm talking about now what we fail to see is this is the hour if ever we should stay on the word look into the word read the word meditate on the word and I'm talking about myself this is the hour because the attack is on the word nothing but the word right nothing but the word Paul said I don't have nothing left the only thing I desire is to know him in his suffering and in the power of his resurrection Hallelujah and that's what that's where you and I supposed to be that's where William Branham was that's why nobody could stop him he didn't care about popularity he didn't care whether his teachings were different from someone else why he knew he had truth Hallelujah and he challenged the people if you don't think I'm right show me something different Hallelujah but they knew he was right just like they knew Jesus was right and they did not want to follow him let me let me let me go head on with this see what we don't realize is Satan has raised a war against the bride but his tactic has never changed and his tactic is to hybrid that's all he has to do mix something up with it and make the people declare it is the word when it's not the word Hallelujah now president if you don't hear what I'm saying go listen to condemnation by representation 1960 1123 go listen to what he's saying because you'll realize that this devil is smarter than what you think how do you know you're saying it right brother Brooks because even in this message we have so many fractions of faith of what we believe and my question is which one is right the truth of the matter is they're all wrong the word is right this is why it's so important people you better hear what I'm saying see because that's what it was with the prophet of God and you know people just get so indoctrinated into their faith to win the truth of something comes they can't hear it because it's the previous teachings of what they've had heard that they they just can't separate from it but those who are chosen and elected of God will know that what I'm preaching is truth and I'm not preaching my own thoughts I'm preaching the word of God that William Brandon brought and the truth of the matter is he tried to warn us Amen to stay with that word right he told us that this thing is an individual walk it is not a group session Hallelujah it ain't your Camp it's not because you go to his church or go to that church not even if you go to my church or disassembly that does not guarantee you heaven amen hallelujah he did it at the beginning Satan did what did he do and now in this day he's bringing all of his demonic forces to challenge the bride on the word and you know what she will stand Hallelujah now why would she stand because she realized that the ballot is not hers the battle is the Lord's and she understands amen the grace that has been given to us see when we look at the opening of the word and and as that brother preached uh Revelation 5 when they began to honor God and honor and say Thou Art Worthy Thou Art Worthy they realize that everything that they achieved in this life went back to Jesus Christ and what wasn't it was the grace of God that made them bow to their knees when they realized that honor was given to the lamb they all fell on their faces they threw their crowns off because they realized I'm in heaven but the reason why I'm here is because of the Lamb of God Hallelujah and so many people they don't understand what God is doing when God opened the book of of that that the book of The Seven Seals that that those seals will open that we might come to understand who we are where we came from if you look you mean after the seals were open brother Brandon's message changed completely and he began to direct everything to his bride hallelujah or to the bride of Christ why because the churches had already put him out 1956 he preached a message indictment showing that that was the last year that that if America would not uh repent they would miss their Revival and they they wouldn't repent they missed their Revival you say well that was America but what we didn't see is the influence that America would have on the entire world from that point on why did Brother Branham say that those demons out of the Euphrates went down amen into Hollywood because he understood what if they were going to do and they're still doing it but we're so unconnected to God and and I'm preaching on me because we're we're tuned ourselves into all of this technology I don't know how many hours of the day and we fail to read our Bible we fail to listen to a message y'all better hear what I'm saying what is he doing he's hybriding you he's literally changing your mind amen from the word unto science and we fail to see that these things are good and evil yes there's some good about it but there's some evil to it and that evil is to distract you from the coming of the Lord why because in this hour the bride is to make herself ready how do you make yourself ready not by fear you make yourself by works what do you mean by works working in the word right study prayer fasting whatever it takes you see what brother means I don't have to do all of that because I'm elected that's what the electorate elected elected will do Hallelujah you should have prove that brother Adam talk about it amen choose a govern bride he said that young lady that was in the backyard what's that once that ranch's son said that he would marry her what did she do from that point on she worked she made herself ready she saved her nickels Hallelujah y'all better hear what I'm saying why because we we failed to see it listen to the message brother Benham said it like this and I'm just paraphrasing it but he said what happened to the church they brought in basketball they brought in sports they brought all kinds of activities in and Incorporated it into the church he said they hybrid it and what happened he said it became a mule and a Mew cannot reproduce hello somebody do you understand me every seed must bring forth of his kind and he tells us amen that he preached the message conference a conference with God and that conference is that you get to business with God you get down on your knees until you know that you know that you know that you know Hallelujah you talking it over with him you're telling him all of your evils and all of your troubles and everything that you know to tell him Hallelujah you have a conference with him but how many of you have ever had a conference with God about your soul huh because you were born in the message because you came up in the message don't mean you're in the message the only way you can get in the message is that you're born again you got to have the Holy Ghost on the inside now let me tell you something brother Randall said this is the most evil age ever ever right that means Satan can personate almost everything he just can't live the word he can impersonates your your Holy Ghost but see your Holy Ghost will bring forth holy it's not going to bring forth nothing else he can a person impersonate all of that but brother Brandon said he just can't live the word and I I tell you what I just I just don't know what else to tell people you know the truth of the matter is who you know you can't even get people in this message to the altar no more because they think that they're so self-righteous either that or they're just prideful you know I don't know which it is it might be both but they'll know that they'll need they'll know that that need and they'll know that God is talking to him but instead of responding to the word they'll walk out as if they got it all together But the saddest part of it is when the flood comes when it began to strike home all you're going to remember is all of the chances you had to repent and make things right and you missed it you let it go right so what what happens when brother Branham came what was he to do bring back the unadulterated word now I I got things in my life right now that I've heard him say that says oh God it's me help me straighten me strengthen me amen that I would barking walk circumspectly to the word why it is the only thing that's going to stand we must acknowledge our wrong doings we got people amen still yet that won't do that and what do you think they're going with it every sin will be exposed everything done in the dark would brought be brought to the light but people think God is dead or something they think God don't see you say why are you saying all of this you hear this preaching whether you see it or not that's grace and grace will give you the power to repent Grace will give you the power say yes Lord It's Me standing in the need of prayer now the Bible tells us that they were grounded right in faith and love and I said to myself where is the root where is the ground where is the love y'all better hear what I'm saying this love is not mushy it tells the truth and I find out by the grace of God people don't like truth and don't don't disturb me because I know I got it no no no no no that's one thing the word will do it is a two-edged sword it was come and it will cut you it would go into your secret place it will expose you it will do and let me say it like this that's what I love about the word I don't want to think I'm right if I'm wrong let me read this quote from Brother Branham maybe that'll help you out so you'll know I'm not giving you my own words why is so important I've seen people you know and and I can't say I I've I've I've been squeaky clean because this flesh is something else to deal with but I'll tell you at the times that I know that I've been wrong I will apologize and ask for God God forgive me brother Branham says Amen in the message condemnation by representation paragraph 131 many times I've heard people say then brother Branham because Adam and Eve did the evil hybrid the word of God cause us to get into the con this condition God is unjust if he condemns me I had nothing to do with it I never sinned it was Adam that sin the Bible said I was born in sin shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking lies so somebody represented me I need you to hear that somebody represented me that's right Adam and Eve represented us they basically showed us what we would have done and yes they put us in sin absolutely he said boy Here's a thought it might choke you somebody represented you as a sinner but it was the one that hybrid the word and today if you're expecting the Pentecostal church or the Methodist the Baptist to represent you it's a hybrid word and condemned you're condemned because that Adam condemned you Adam and Eve being one accepted the hybrid form and condemned the world so brother Brandon says like if there is a church and the church is a hybrid Church you're condemned see that's why the Bible said there were seven women and none of them were found faithful which was typing out the church but people we're the Bride of Jesus Christ we are individuals we're supposed to watch everything to make sure things go according to the word when you do that you're bound to get in a lot of trouble then you say brother Brandon why should I where why should God hold me responsible because one man represented me and then I die because that man is sin then I'm a sinner by representation that's right you're a sinner by representation you never he said God don't hold you responsible for being a sinner he don't hold you responsible because you lie and steal anything you do he doesn't hold you responsible for being a sinner he holds you responsible because you don't help yourself there's a wave made for you you reject the way that God laid down that's what God that's what God condemns you for there is a way of Escape Hallelujah he says listen High breeding High breeding he said oh how terrible her breathing here it goes High breeding the people New York the Big molting pot I got hundreds of precious colored friends that born again Christian but on this line of segregation and things that they're talking about high-breeding the people what tell me what's fine culture find Christian colored woman would want her baby to be a mulatto by a white man no sir is not right what white men would want her uh baby to be a mulatto by a colored man God made us what we are let's stay what what God made us I believe it's right now take it or leave it and listen people there were people in in in in Branham tabernacle's family were doing the same thing mixing it but you you see until you understand the depth of that you'll never understand what he's telling us see right now we we know but brother random is talking about is right because they hybrid the corn the hybrid the cow the hybrid the chicken they hybrid everything this is the age of high breeding and everything that Harvard is dead [Music] I'm just saying it takes a revelation and understanding what he's saying I've had people say well you know I think he was Prejudiced and I think doing because of his time oh man is that not the devil he always give us a reason to reason and when we reason we allow ourselves to hybrid and in doing so we bring death to family it's out of order but in this day that come a Spa Royal seed of Abraham that's exactly what it'll be would be a royal bride to the Royal promised son as I spoke last night now he talks about a raw you'll see but let it he's going to Define he's going to bring some things out that will Define what this Royal seed is as I spoke last night it won't be a natural seed it'll be a spiritual seed a church full of the Holy Ghost that's what it is it is not because a group listen it if this church would fill up with with with people it doesn't make it a church until the Holy Ghost comes in that's what it is when the Holy Ghost comes in and you know what people say oh brother books reading the Unholy almost like his old-fashioned the preach on the Holy Ghost no sir brother Benham called this message his holy ghost message it won't change it has to be that way it started out this way it has to end this way and what do we have an intellectual conception of the message and nobody's living everybody's working with works and law how do you know because they can't love each other the Holy Ghost makes you love one another that's exactly what it'd be would be a royal bride to the Royal promised son as I spoke last night it won't be a natural seed it'll be a spiritual seed there is to be a spiritual bride raised up which will be the Royal seed of the royal faith of Abraham royal son she is to come on the seed in the scene in the last day and that time and place is a promise that's given to her Hallelujah oh we should have taken a Rapture by now Hallelujah is that right I mean there's a quote brother Brown said if God can get 10 people on One Accord the Rapture would take place look it up and if that be true what's the problem one thing they're better than the other that's nonsense by one blood are you saved and that's the blood of Jesus Christ Hallelujah is the truth it's the truth we got racism among ourselves what kind of stuff is that and claim to have the Holy Ghost God be merciful to us [Applause] brother but you shouldn't say that well let me say it like this when Peter was caught with the spirit of racism on him and Paul saw him separate himself from the Gentiles Paul rebuked him and said you make the grace of God of none effects it's a lie you've been told and it's a lie that people believe and that's why folks are dead and don't know it in the place is a promise that's given to her according to Malachi 4 scripture there is to rise a message that will shake the hearts of the people right back to the apostolic fathers again wait a minute and we hear that Apostolic fathers again what were they teaching you must be saved you must be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ you must be filled with the Holy Ghost Hallelujah the apostolic fathers preached amen that you've got to have a statue of a perfect man you got to grow up into Christ right they teach taught all of those things and what are we doing with that it's become head knowledge and nobody's just seeking after it I won't say nobody only a few people are looking toward God to bring them into a perfection but in the meantime they're just going to let their flesh rule them right rule them with their temper ruling with their attitudes rule them when they don't come to church what kind of Christian that is huh no church service is there and brother Branham said A True Believer when when the can't hardly wait till the doors open what about that quote True Believer so what makes these other people that's not coming what does it make them I'm just saying that's the message what is it because people have allowed Satan to hybrid them and brother bear said the only way that that could ever change is that you gotta go back to the word where you left it destroyed according to Malachi 4 a scripture right there's a rise a message that would shake the hearts of the people right back to the apostolic fathers again there's a rise one on the scene in the power of Elijah that's right that'll rise on the scene uh a Wilderness man that that'll come out and we'll have a message that'll run right straight back to the word again that's the hour we're living in and he said a spiritual bride yeah so that means they got to be a corner one here somewhere now the power of His grace is that we would not have known this message had it not been for the power of His grace we were all living the way we were living it was God who came to us and it's God who's constantly unfolding the word of God but if we wait and this is what it is see Eagles Eagles feed themselves they know how to feed themselves but we'll wait listen I know people this message don't know nothing about this message they don't I mean they you could ask them a question and they have no idea what you're talking about and here we are about to embrace a rapture huh Embrace The Rapture and how you're going to defeat let me ask you a question when the squeeze come on how are you going to defeat the enemy what are you going to do do you really know what the mark of the beast is because they've disguised this thing so well if you're not careful you'll take it not knowing it and it's almost on us right now it's moving fast I know I'm gonna be finished in just a minute Daniel think about it the pressure he had but he knew he knew who God was right he was all by himself listen he prayed three times a day all by himself it never said the Shadrach Meshach and Abednego was there but he stood there he had his Integrity he knew God and let me tell you something when the pressure comes on if you don't know God you're gonna deny him just like Peter Peter had an intellectual understanding of him but when he got the holy ghost that coward became a brave Soldier Hallelujah that's the only way and what people don't understand is that listen even the devil when it came to job God said you can do anything to job but just don't touch his flesh right don't take his soul excuse me and and and and and and so what did the devil say well skin for skin let me touch him I'll make I'll let him curse you right and the devil let me tell you something I don't care what Affliction you you have God is still God and every every deal worthy of the glory of the honor right of the wisdom everything he's listen why because you'll never understand what he did for you till you get over there Hallelujah when you get over there these little things that we've gone through will become small and you'll understand he was working on your behalf even when you didn't understand it Hallelujah yes let me tell you I look at I look at I look at my children and and all that we raise them up but I'm gonna tell you something they're out there where they are because they've never got the Holy Ghost hello and I find out that these parents in this message are not teaching their children and not trying to get them to the Holy Ghost and guess what the world has a power is going to pull them right on out y'all better hear what I'm saying they could be in the church baptized and everything look all Sanctified but if they don't get the Holy Ghost this age is going to pull you right on out and you know this is a perverted age Hallelujah it'll mix your boys Minds up it'll mix your girls Minds up because that's exactly what they're trying to do it must be like Sodom and Gomorrah it has to be you say well what do you mean what what do you think they're doing it was it was when the sodomites knocked on the political door of lot that's when the fire fell and look what they're doing they're knocking on the door of the political realm oh people help us don't we see the time that we're living in it's the grace of God to give us eyes to see and are hard to understand Hallelujah that's what the program said flee Brothers fleek Hallelujah look what happened to Israel when she didn't obey the word of God she became the Bible said as Sodom and Gomorrah and you say oh brother boots I don't know about that this message people let me tell you something you wake up and smell the coffee because we have a lot of issues in here too Hallelujah let me read this quote I ain't gonna be too much longer because I know it's it's it's mid-service but uh what am I trying to get you to um God took me in such a different way I just got to preach it like you want me to preach it every man and woman down Through the Ages Every Prophet every person has always went upon those principles job stood firm on it the only meeting place of Israel was under the shed blood the only place that Shekinah Glory fell was under the shed blood the only place in Shekinah Glory will come don't let me hurt your feelings Baptist Presbyterian but the only place that the Shekinah Glory Falls is under the blood that's the reason you feel there's a kind of Pentecostal glory is because it's under the blood of the shed blood of the Son of God back into the Shekinah Glory when it comes when he took his own blood and rent the veil into and we come into the presence of God the Shekinah Glory where His blessings oh it makes a new man out of old did you hear what I'm saying so don't tell me you're under the blood and you still the same old man no you've been deceived somewhere you've been hybrid Aaron's left his Rod there one year and it bloomed out and bloomed while it was in the presence of the Shekinah Glory Now where's these people and then when when they do come what do they bring where is the Shekinah where is the anointing where is the power of God every one of us supposed to bring our own link of Fire the house should be burning down when we come together Hallelujah something's wrong don't y'all realize if the Holy Ghost come to a place that is grieved from this place it will not return it might return to individuals but it won't return to this Aaron left his Rod there one year and it bloomed and I don't mean you gotta shout and dance am I the only one that filled this void Aaron left his rod and there was one year and it bloomed out of the bloom and and blue blossomed while it was in the presence of the kind of Glory any man laying in the presence of God's Shekinah Glory would take an old dead sinner dead in sin and trespasses and Bloom him out to a new creature in Christ what are we blooming out to Hallelujah tradition oh let me tell you what Pentecostal people can outshout us they can out dance us oh they can outrun us they can now speak in tongues they still so-called prophesy all of that is still dead have a name that they live yet they did what is this message bringing us to and I don't know maybe I'm losing my mind but I keep saying to God every day I'm going to make it Grace I'm gonna make it I don't care what I gotta correct and help of God but I will not allow this church and nobody else's Church set me in a place where I miss the Rapture you saw what brother was why do you say that because Moses let the people upset him so much to he broke the order of God and suffered the consequences I refuse to be like that for anyone we live and move and have our own being as a certain also of your own prophets have said for we are also his offspring now we are yes we are not trying to de-christianize anybody I'm not saying you don't have the the deceived Gene of God but one thing until the anointing until you get with the man until you get with the Holy Spirit until you get with Christ that seed is just laying there you're the woman he's the man we need his life to live it and that seed has to be quickened for as much there as we and listen brother random said listen he said this the atmosphere has to be a hot one it can't be lukewarm it can't be cold it will not bring forth amen but do you think people think about that they come they bring their ideas they come with their what you call those magnifying glass and want to see everything every move the preacher makes every word he says they want to judge everything and everybody and they don't understand that's not their business Only God can judge us but we'll find that people don't realize what they're doing I'm almost done this is my last scripture acts 17 29 30. for as much then as we are all the offspring of God we ought not to think that godhead is like unto gold or silver or stone or Graven by Art of man's devices in other words and the time of this ignorance of this ignorance God winked at but now commanded all men everywhere to repent and that's what he's doing and you know what those who know how to repent those who can say Lord cleanse me of everything that's not right I want everything cleansed out of me I want everything I don't care what I thought was right I don't care what I've been taught and thought and all that only you know what is true and let me tell you something if you take that kind of approach God would take you right to the message and show you exactly what needs to be set in order that's God just one more almost one more one more scripture and I'm Gonna Let You Go first John 4 2-4 he said hereby know we the spirit of God every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is of God and every spirit that confesses not that Jesus Christ is coming the flesh is not of God and this is that Spirit of antichrist wherever we have heard that it should come and even now already is in is it in the world and so I'm gonna close on that so you so you'll see where it takes us anybody that's under this message that will allow Satan to make them believe that they cannot come to a perfection that the virtue and the divine nature cannot come to its full purpose a full place in your life if you believe that what brother Branham taught on those things are not correct it makes you an antichrist and let me tell you this whether it be you or whether it be me God's word will not come back void he will have a perfect bride whether it's me or you he's going to have a perfect bride is already in in Emotion amen there are people that are changing from glory to glory their attitudes are changing they're loving God more they're loving people more it's happening whether it be you or not and what's happening too is that the devil is defeating defeating the People by by how can I say it making the word look like is of none effect God is still a Healer he's a steal a deliverer he's still a savior he's still what he was yesterday he's the same yesterday today and forever he's the alpha he's the Omega he's the first he's the last God will not change because he can't amen we're blessed that God sent us a prophet that gave us a word to understand that we're supposed to be changing into the glory of God hello let's stand don't you settle for anything don't you get so busy to your life becomes chaos or chaotic that's not of God right now your life is supposed to be forming and shaping up into the image and likeness of Jesus Christ that's what it's supposed to be and you say well brother you could even get busy with religious stuff too busy to let God work on you too busy to have a fellowship uh and communion with him too busy we do it and we don't understand what the devil is doing he's keeping keeping because God can't come back until the church get on fire to the bride is on fire he said I word that you be hot or cold those are conditions he gave us thank you we got to be on fire just can't this can't remain just a church or some order of a church and and you say what do you mean well that's what a lot of churches have become just to order of it but the prophet of God specifically said if that if that if that vine put forth another Branch an original Branch it would bring forth the same as the first branch and I will not close my eyes I will not close my mind Amen to what I but what I can see and what I what I see you know because it you know it in the early days in the app even in the apostolic age amen they didn't have to wonder who those people was signs and wonders followed them that life declared it their love the Bible said they loved one another that's how they knew and that's what prophet God said he said out of all the gifts if I could just have love I Choose Love over all all the gifts because that's the ultimate of it all and you know it's it's so sad it's so sad it's so sad you know that that you know people Minds have gotten such a place even in this message because we like Israel we thought we couldn't be touched but that same devil that put them in bondage in Egypt crossed over and put them in bondage in the wilderness and instead of trusting God they trust man and those same men amen that Nathan and Korah who was interpreting the word to them caused them to lose their life oh that's what people do but we're in an age now that you can read and study for yourself with the Holy Ghost the holy spirit will show you what's truth and what's not but I pray I'm I'm serious for God things are happening in my life and I'm happy about it do I have failures in my life still yes I have to confess every day uh and ask for forgiveness every day but brother random said Paul had to do it he had to do it and you're going to have to do it but in all of that we know that because of his victory in Calvary we we we we will be made whole because he that begun the good work in US is faithful to complete it let's bow in a word of prayer Heavenly Father we come before you we thank you for your grace and your mercy Lord we thank you for being so good to us we thank you for speaking to us tonight Lord not just to your audience but you spoke to my heart as well and I pray Lord God that you forgive me and cleanse me from all my unrighteousness I pray tonight Lord God that you'll set me on a straight course that the word of God will become my headship the the crown of your glory o my head Lord have mercy Lord God Upon Us Lord in this wicked day that we're living in and things are moving so fast so rapidly amen but but I know father that the bride that you spoke of will be here she will stand and she will uh uh Crest all of the waves that come her way Lord oh God but we don't want to wonder we need you and that's what your Prophet said Lord we see the word but we're waiting on you we see you Lord we see your word but we know we can't do a thing without your quickening power we need that anointing that super anointing Lord that will shake the people back into the proper place help us Lord help us Lord don't let our eyes become dim don't let our eyes become blind but Lord may we continue to see you in your word and continue to move forward father it is definitely a press it becomes difficult see me more and more each day but I pray father God that you continue to be with us because you promised us you'll never leave us nor will you forsake us father we can't make this journey on our own we need you Lord Jesus we need you as our battle like we need you Lord as our army our shield and we need you as our Butler we need you Lord as a whole armor of God we need you Lord help us realize that they were living in draw us closer to you Lord let us

on us all I can see is your servant Paul I get a little small glimpse of what he had to fight through Lord they hated him in there ones that even preached who hated him [Music] help us Lord they deserted him Lord I'm nowhere on that scale of a man or a preacher but I know Lord if I if we stand on the word those of us who are not we have a turn in Attitude [Music] help us God [Music] bring the
