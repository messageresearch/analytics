Jesus amen we so happy to be here in his presence this morning amen let's uh take our Bibles and turn to Luke Chapter 2 amen uh Luke Chapter 2 we'll read verse 46 to verse 49 Luke chap 2 vers 46 to verse 49 the Bible says and Mary said oh was reading the wrong one that's why I was confused all right Luke 2: 46-49 the Bible says and it came to pass that after 3 days they found him in the temple sitting in the midst of the doctors both hearing them and asking them them questions amen this is a familiar story it's a story of Jesus Amen when Jesus um uh during the Passover when his parent lost him amen verse 47 we continue the Bible says that and all and all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers and when the saw him they were amazed and said and and his mother said unto him son why H has thou thus deal with us Behold thy father and I have sought thee soaring verse 49 the Bible says and he said unto them how is how is it that ye sought me me we see not that I must do about my father that I must be about my father's business amen let's turn to John chapter 9 we read the verse one to verse 5 amen the Bible says that and as Jesus passed by he saw a man which was blind from his birth and the disciples asked him saying master who did Sin this man or his parents that he was born blind Jesus answered and Jesus answered neither has this man seen nor his parents but that the works of God should be made manifest in him now verse four Jesus says that I must work the works of him that sent me while it is day the night cometh when no man can work and as long as I am in the world I am the light of the world Amen let's bow our heads father God we thank you for your grace and your mercy Lord we just read your word father we pray father Lord that you come and you explain this word to us father Lord bless our hearts father and bless the service oh God Lord I pray father God that you take me out of the way Lord and you speak to your people father help me Father God to be so sensitive to the Holy Spirit oh God lord to do and say only what you want me to say father in Jesus Christ name we pray amen amen you may be seated so uh this morning we have a little exhalation here that we wanted to amen it's a little bit as a study because reading but uh the the title of it will be the father's business and then the subtitle will be the responsibility of a Believer amen because in because in Luke Chapter 2 what we read here amen if you read the verse 49 the Bible you know Mary and Joseph were looking for Jesus and when they found him they said that we've been looking for you for three days straight amen but when Jesus answered he said that didn't you know that I have to be about my father's business he had a job that he had he had he was supposed to do amen he had a responsibility to fulfill and then in John chapter 9 verse4 amen here's Jesus again saying he said that I must work the works of him that sent me amen while it is day because the night cometh when no man can work amen I must work the works of him that sent me amen so if you are sent by someone amen there is a purpose for which you were sent amen amen you see a prophet a prophet is a me messenger amen and as a messenger he has a responsibility that he has to fulfill amen he has a job or a work that he has to do amen all the prophets of the of if you read the entire Bible you will see that it's not all of them that did the same thing amen every one of them had a certain responsibility amen because in in in in in in the body because the Bible calls us the body Body of Christ in the body you have different parts amen you have the eyes and the job of the eyes is to see amen and when you see you know where to go the hand can never do the eyes work amen the hand job is to touch amen you cannot walk walk with your hands amen that's the feet job amen so the body has different parts amen and no matter how seemingless they seem no matter how meaningless that that part be amen that part has a special a special job amen you have let's say for example for mechanical watch he me a mechanical watch is a watch that does not need a battery but in the mechanical watch you will see the watch has so many Springs and then every little screws in the mechanical watch is important amen if you take any watches if I take off one screw or one one uh one spring or something it will mess up the way I will tell time to to by that to say that all of us we do form a body that we call a Christian body because we know that Christ is the head and we are the body amen and as the body every one of us do occupy a certain position in the body amen some of us are the mouth amen some of us are the eyes some of us are the ears and so forth so we all can not be doing the same thing or envying what somebody else is doing amen if God blesses this brother with this gift amen I have to praise the Lord for the gift that he has blessed the brother with amen and then go to God and ask God what is my job what is my gift amen that is the purpose of the adoption amen when you are adopted amen you have been positionally placed Amen to do a specific job amen so now we have to know what is the job that I'm supposed to be doing amen Jesus said I have to be about my father's business amen he knew what he was supposed to do amen and he said that I must work the works of him that sent me so which means that he had something that he knew that he was supposed to be doing amen let's turn to Matthew chapter 28 amen like like like we said that you know if you've been sent that means that you have something to do amen not just being sent just to go and then just to be hanging around amen Matthew 28: 19 amen this is Jesus speaking after the resurrection amen he met the disciples and now he's talking to them amen he's giving them a Great Commission the Bible says in verse 19 the Bible says that go ye therefore and teach all Nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you and lo I Am With You Always even unto the end of the world amen here's Jesus giving us something to do amen giving us a purpose go ye therefore and teach All Nations baptizing them in the name of the father son and the holy spirit amen which we know that that is those are attributes and the name is the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen but to stick with my subject amen he's giving us a purpose amen this is not only for preachers this is not only for pastors amen but this is for every Believers amen your job my job our responsibilities is to go amen and to teach All Nations and and to baptize them in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen in other words to go and to show them the way Amen to go and to bring them to Christ amen not to bring them to the church because sometimes we make that mistake most of the time amen we bring people to church but we don't bring them to Christ amen but we have to bring people to Christ amen to have their lives transformed Amen to have their lives changed because you can't bring somebody to church amen it's a good thing amen but coming to church alone does not save youen coming to church amen does not guarantee that you saved amen but we have to introduce people to Christ amen bring them to Christ for the Salvation of their souls amen that is the job of the body the prophet says in the message the spoken word and is the Original Seed he says that the seed of Christ must must come through his [Music] body the seed of Christ must come through his body not through a denomination but through a born again seed of the word that it must come through now remember what is it is the seed of Christ Christ seed now is saying that how does the Apple how does the apple tree come amen it comes through the body the seed is through the body and the church is the body of Christ is that right the Bible Church the birth produces this birth produces it says that that's a new birth himself in body so this birth produces himself in the body amen his church is his word amen so that the PE so that people can see the confirmation of Hebrews 138 that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever amen so that people can see the confirmation that Jesus is not dead amen that he is alive and living amen and the only way that they can see it amen it will have to be through you amen it will have to be through me because we are the ones that the the the seed of God comes through amen amen it's the body that produces the fruit amen it's the body of the tree in the body of the tree amen that's where in the branches amen that's where you will see the fruits amen and you you are the branches amen it's through you that the fruit of God is supposed to be produced amen Jesus says that you are the light of the world Amen let your light so shine amen so that people can glorify your father who is in heaven amen so that God can be glorify God to be glorified amen your light will have to shine your Works will have to be seen amen so that God can be glorified amen the Prophet The Prophet continued in s paragraph 790 the prophet he says that although an angel dictated Phillip to him amen but the germ of Life had to come through the body which is Phillip amen here is just the backstory of this amen here the prophet is talking about how philli had to go uh baptize the unic amen he says now that even though although the an angel showed philli where the unic was amen but the germ of Life had to come through the body which is Phillip oh brother now we on the line where did The Germ come from through an angel the angel showed him where to go and an angel is a messenger here is a son amen Phillip had the germ the message the word that's how a child can be born amen philli laid his hands on him Philip baptized him in the name of Jesus Christ there come forth the spirit of God now The Germ had to come from the body what body Christ's body correct and Philip was a member of the body amen so even though the angel is the one who tell Phillip what what to do or could not accomplish the job that philli was about to do amen because to transmit life to transmit to transmit life amen life has to come from a body Amen to another body even though the angel knew what was supposed to happen even though the angel knew what Phillip had to do but the angel could not do it because an angel an angel could not do it amen because it takes a body a a Son of God Amen who has the germ of God Amen to go do that job to go transmit that life amen if we continue the prophet says that now listen the same thing to took place in Acts 10:48 Peter was on the house Housetop an angel directed him to cornelius's house but where did the word come from amen he came from the body amen I feel pretty good feel like traveling on Amen an angel come and said don't worry don't call nothing unclean just go on don't think nothing am and while Peter spake these words not the angel not the Cardinal but while Peter spake this words what he was the body amen he had the word the word took hold amen and Angel directed it amen the angel directed the word word amen but the life come through the body of Christ amen and you are the body of Christ amen the angel can show you what to do amen the angel can direct you where to go amen but the angel cannot do that job because it takes the body of Christ amen it takes a member of the body Body of Christ because the life will go through him and to go transmit that life amen the prophet continues and says Paul on his way to Damascus a vision directed him in other words an angel directed him amen but ananas had the germ amen had the word amen that that Prophet an amen saw a vision that said go up there lay your hands on him and said brother Saul the Lord appeared to you in the road coming down here how did it know amen he had the word amen the word of the Lord came to the prophet amen prophesied went up there and said amen he come and has sent me up here amen I might lay my hands upon you and you will be healed and receive the Holy Ghost amen so that you can receive your sight the scales fell off his eyes amen he rose was baptized the name of Jesus went to study amen the angel directed it that's right but Paul amen had the seed germ so it takes the spirit of God the seed to give life eternal amen and can direct it amen an angel can show you amen but it takes a body amen it takes a Son of God Amen it takes the body of Christ amen to accomplish the job amen when brother Bram was was having the prayer line amen he says that I'm waiting for the end of the Lord to come am at the Angel of the Lord will come amen will make him see Visions amen he will see somebody's life amen he will see the hidden secret but the angel of the Lord amen could not lay his hands on the people so that they can recover or be healed amen the angel of the Lord amen could not lay his hands on the people Amen to give them the Holy Spirit am but he needed a body he needed an instrument he needed something that he could use amen so that's why you see brother Brenham says I am willing to let him borrow my body I am giving him my body amen so that he can borrow it amen to use these hands of mine Amen to use my mouth amen for the benefit of his of his of his kingdom amen so all of that to say Amen that every one of us amen we have a job to do amen and only us can do that job amen nobody else will do that job for us amen us as the body amen we have been given a responsibility to fulfill Amen to be in the father's business Amen to continue what the what Jesus started Amen in Isaiah chapter 22:22 oh first let's go to Isaiah chapter 9 ver6 Amen to be about the father's business amen the responsibility of a Believer amen Isaiah chapter 9:6 the Bible says here amen for unto us a child is born 96 unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder amen let's study this verse amen the government shall be upon his shoulders amen this is talking about Jesus this verse is talking about Jesus amen unto us a child is born a son is given amen that son and child is Jesus Christ and Jesus Christ is not the body Jesus Christ is the head of the body amen he's the one leading the body amen so here the Isaiah he saying this that a child is born a son is given which means it's Jesus Christ the head amen but the government of Jesus amen will not be upon Him amen but will be upon his shoulders amen Jesus is the head Isaiah could have said amen that the government amen should be upon his head the head amen but Isaiah says here that the government should be upon the shoulders amen the shoulders is a part of the body Amen in other words amen you are the shoulders I am the shoulders and Jesus is the head amen so the government am shall be upon the body amen the government has been given to you amen for you to govern amen for you to have AU Authority amen for you to have power amen all of that has been given to the church amen to the shoulders amen if we go to Isaiah 22:22 amen all of that to show us our responsibilities amen Isaiah 22:22 the Bible says here and the key of the house of David will I lay upon his shoulder amen he shall so he shall open and None Shall shut and he shall shut and None Shall open amen the key of the House of David I will lay it upon his shoulders Amen in other words the key of the House of David amen has been given back to the body amen has been given back to you amen he has given you the responsibility Amen to open and nobody will and nobody else will shut amen and to shut and nobody else will open amen so that's why that's why Jesus told Peter amen that I give you the key amen so that everything that you lose on Earth will be loose in heaven amen will be loose in heaven amen and everything that uh uh loose is to and and everything that you will bind on Earth amen will be bind in heaven amen so he has been given to us amen we have been given the responsibility Amen to open and to close Amen to show the responsibilties of the believer the responsibilities of a church amen we heard last Sunday when brother leis was preaching he was preaching about the open book amen notice this when John received the open book The Bible said that he started prophesying which means that when you receive the open book amen you have been given a service to do amen you have been given something to do amen you have been given a responsibility amen so that's why the prophet says here that this seed must come through the body amen and the church is the body of Christ amen and if the body which is the body of Christ which also is represented by a tree or by branches and Tre if it doesn't produce the fruit the tree must be cut amen because we have a responsibility to do we must be about our father's business amen we have to continue the work of our fathers amen let's take the example of the Fig Tree Amen in Mark 11: 13 to4 amen the Bible says here and seeing a fig tree far off having leaves he came happily that he might find anything thereon and when he came to it he found nothing but leaves for the time of felds was not yet and Jesus answered and stay unto it no man eat fruit of thee Hereafter forever amen so Jesus if you read uh uh this if you read entire chapter or the chapter before that you will understand that this is this is taking place early April because it's one week before the crucifixion amen so it's early it's early [Music] spring yeah so uh uh and and then when you study the Fig Tree you will see that most fig trees the first give fruit before before bringing up leaves amen and those fruits would doesn't come early April or early spring amen the fruit happen late spring amen so but Jesus from a far amen he saw this fig tree with with leaves so because the Fig Tree had leaves technically the Fig Tree was supposed to have was supposed to have fruits as well but when he came he found no fruit that's why the Fig Tree was cursed amen because a tree with no fruit the bible say that that fruit will be that that tree will be cut amen so that fig tree amen was out of season amen something was wrong with it in the beginning because according to science according to the the boty man he wasn't supposed to have those leaves it wasn't supposed to have those healthy leaves amen and we all know what leaves represent leaves represent religion amen the Fig Tree amen had leaves which represent religion it meant to hide what was happening underneath amen when Adam and Eve Sinn amen what did they do amen they went and they grabbed the Fig Tree the leaf of the leaves of the Fig Tree Amen to hide themselves to cover themselves amen the feig I mean the leaves represent religion amen and the way and you have religion amen and religion amen is there to hide amen something that's not going right amen it's like a show a public show amen you giving aspect you giving intentions of somebody who is right what underneath you but there is something that's not going right amen so that's why that religion religion will not save you amen religion will never save you amen because you can hide yourself under your religion amen but that religion will not save you Adam and Eve they thought that they will hide their nudity with the leaves amen but they didn't they forgot that the Lea would not be Eternal amen that the leaf were withered amen so that fig Tre amen something was going wrong something was wrong in it in it but it decided to hide it with leaves with religion amen it doesn't matter how hard how hard you hide it the Bible said that we shall know them by their fruit amen the fruit always tells what's underneath amen your fruit that you bearing amen will tell what who you are amen you can have a tree and on that tree you graft up you you have an orange tree Amen on on the orange tree amen the apple tree is grafted amen you graft the Citrix you grabed amen you you you grab the mango amen you will notice that the orange [Music] tree amen will not produce all those fruits amen the orange branches will only produce oranges amen even though the the entire tree looks confusing because many the trees are grafted in but each branches am will produce its original seed the branches the orange branches amen will only produce oranges amen the or the mango branches we only produce mangoes amen and the citric will produce citric amen so we all be we all can come in the same church amen we all can read the same Bible amen we all can say that we have the same Prophet amen we all can meditate on the same message amen but the life that will come out of us amen it will only be what is inside of us amen it doesn't matter the church that you go to amen it doesn't matter who's the pastor amen but what's hiding inside of you amen it's what will come forth amen imagine Judas Judas was going to the best church ever Jesus was his Pastor amen nobody could teach like Jesus amen nobody could change lives like Jesus amen nobody could perform Miracles like Jesus amen but even though Judas was going to Jesus church am when it came time to bear fruit amen every one of them bore what was inside of them amen Judas going to Jesus church amen did not change amen the fruits or the seed that was that was inside amen because if we go back to Genesis 3 amen we will know that there is the serpent seed amen and the seed of the woman amen there are two seeds there are at the seed of Adam and the serpent seed amen and all those throughout the generations amen every seed every man will reproduce What the seed that has inside amen so it doesn't matter how much you tried to cover with your religion but what inside of you will always come amen our sisters in the message amen they think that you know wearing long dresses amen covering themselves or not doing this or that makes you holy it's a really good thing amen but that will never cover that amen that's just covering the outside of you amen but a change has to come from the inside amen same thing with the brothers amen they think that knowing quotes amen knowing the Bible amen quoting the Bible from cover to cover amen will make them something better or will change whatever amen but if inside of you amen there is a seed of God Amen those fruits will have to be manifested amen knowing the word or the Bible cover to cover does not save you if it was the case Pharisees all the Pharisees would have been saved but Jesus called them amen the the race of vipers amen that their father was the serpent amen but they knew the word they knew all the prophecies they knew everything but their fruit was different amen they could tell the word they could preach the word amen but the fruit that they were bearing were different amen so now the question is what kind of fruit are we bearing what kind of trees are we Jesus says I must be about my father's business I must work the works of him that sent me amen he was a tree that was bearing the father's fruit but when we look at ourselves we examine our own lives what kind of fruit are we producing what kind of water are we producing you cannot produce both sweet and salt water at the same time am man a source only has one water that he has supposed to produce amen or it's a cooling spring or you Produce Salt Water what kind of life if people look at you what are they going to say Amen at work when people look at you what are they saying what is your testimony what are you leaving behind you amen because the Bible says that our light will have to shine for our father to be glorified is our light shining amen is our life glorifying the father do people praise the Lord when they see us what kind of tree are we what kind of lives are we living amen it's good to come to church every day it's good to say Amen to the word there's a difference between sympathizing and believing amen most people most Christians we do sympathize with the word but we don't really believe it am you can say Amen to the word so loud but are you really believing it amen is that word changing you or are you just agreeing with it to sympathize amen what kind of tree are we amen you say well brother Isaac I believe the message 30 40 years ago yes that's good but where are you now are you moving forward or are you going backward amen we have to examine Our Lives because it's good to preach my amen it's good to preach Big Stuff amen it's good to preach deep stuff but what is it doing with us amen what's the impact of the word amen what is the benefit are we moving forward amen we're preaching good things amen every day you see people preaching amen you come to church every time you see somebody preaching but what is it doing with us what is this what is still what is there still divisions in the church why this Brothers cannot talk to this brother why is this sister not talking to the other sister amen why there is no Fellowship between us amen why do we have to choose who we're supposed to fellowship with amen if we call ourselves a body amen if we believe that we are one body amen if we believe that Christ is the head why do we choose side why don't we talk to everybody why don't we go and G shake everybody's hands amen we have a lot to think of Amen because time is not going backward amen time is going forward amen and the end is at the door don't wait until you are you laying there on the bed you know about to have your last breath and then you start crying and trying to repent amen the Young Rich ruler amenes Jesus came to him amen he called Jesus amen Jesus showed him the way he refused but then when he went to hell amen he wanted to go back and help and he noticed that he made a mistake and he wanted to go back and help his his amen when the opportunity was given to him he didn't take it amen he thought he had all the time amen we hear death's news everywhere amen people who were not sick and just up and wake up and they're no longer amen you don't know when your last day will be amen you don't know when God will call you home what kind of testimony are you going to leave behind what kind of Life are you going to leave behind amen even though people when people die people always try to say positive things about them which is good but yes but you personally amen when you look at yourself what kind of testimony are you are you going to leave behind amen Jesus says I must work the works of my father when the time is still day because the night cometh and nobody will be able to work amen are you doing the work of your father amen you are doing it somehow because there are only two fathers amen you can only be led by two spirit Spirits there are only two spirits that can lead you it's either the spirit of God or not the spirit of God so which Spirit are you being led amen which Spirit are you H amen the prophet says in the message let your light so shine before paragraph 108 it says that but there is so many that the father has drawn [Music] and are hungering and thirsting to find God and yet don't know where to find him because those who are supposed to be build boards is so muted up smarted up with the things of the world till they can't see where they got anymore where they got anymore than they have got before they come to him amen they live like the world which means amen which means what what the prophet is saying here amen that there are people in the world who are who are thirsty and hungry to find God Amen but they don't know how to do that they don't know the way to find him because the prophet said because it me the Christians who are supposed to be Billboards the Believers who are supposed to be Bild boards they are all mixed up with the things of the world Amen until the those people who are hungry they don't even make the difference between them being Christians and not amen people are hungry people are thirsty amen they want to find their ways to God but but us we're supposed to give that publicity amen we're supposed to give that advertisement amen we're supposed to be Billboards but what kind of message are we transmitting amen as a billboard you have a message amen when you're hungry amen you look for Billboards that says food or restaurant amen then you know that this is where I can find food amen but these people they're hungry the Thirsty of God Amen what is your billboard displaying amen what is your billboard showing what is the message on your billboard amen amen we're all mixed up in the things of the world we giving uncertain sounds amen we're giving mixed mixed sounds and mix mixed Vibes about people say today amen people don't really know if you're a Christian or not amen people they don't even know if you're a Believer amen Sen feel comfortable when they're with you amen they feel comfortable when they're talking to you amen there's something wrong with us amen there's something that we have to change there's something that needs to be changed in US amen the prophet said that they live like the world Amen they talk like the world Amen they sing the same songs the world does amen they're dressed like the world I mean especially in the female sexen and they act like the world they go to the worldly places amen they attend the worldly entertainment amen there is no more difference amen you don't even know how to if you can call them Christian or not amen the first time the word Christian was pronounced amen it's because people saw the life of those people other amen their lives displayed Christ amen the message on their Billboards was clear amen and when people saw their lives and they called them Christian because they were like Christ amen but when people see our lives what do they say can they call us Christians do they even know that we are Christians amen we have we have to change amen we have to take the word seriously it's now becomes a habit to us you know that every Sunday morning I have to go to [Music] church amen every Wednesdays there is service amen it becomes it's a habit now amen we coming to church to show off Amen to show the clothes that we wearing Amen to show the cars that we're driving amen what's the purpose of coming to church why are we coming to church what is a church amen people they don't even know what is the Church Believers who don't even know why they act like that sisters who don't even know why they're supposed to wear long dresses people don't even know why they believe they're unable to tell it to somebody else who doesn't believe like them amen people they don't know their words anymore they don't know the Bible anymore amen we said that we are message Believers yes God sent us the prophet yes yes can you prove it in the Bible that God sent you a prophet no but we just believe because this is what we've heard somewhere no amen this is how we have grown this is how we were raised amen the message or the word has now become like becomes like a a culture or something amen but the word is there to change us amen the word has been given to transform us amen every time you come to church amen you have to feel a difference amen because God is here amen and every time you go to Calvary every time you go to God something has to change amen you don't go out the same person but what has changed in our lives amen what is our testimonies amen you ask your brother where brother what is your testimony you say well brother I believed the message in 1933 or something yes that's good but what is your testimony what is your life saying amen the devil believes the Bible say he believes and he trembles believing is good but what is it doing to you the prophet continue and says here you may never see a vision you may never put your hands on a sick person and fear the charge of the almighty of of of almighty God make a skeleton of a man turned back to life again you may never see him standing Yonder in three or four [Music] rainbows you may never see his image you may never hear his voice but still you can be a signboard that will reflect Jesus Christ by a life that's been so pure and [Music] unadulterated from the world not clouded up with dirty things around your life but a pure thing that it'll cause the hungry Hearts to hunger and thirst to be like you you may you may never see a vision you may never do a single Miracle you may never hear the God's voice amen you may never do something strange that's good but your life has to be pure and un unadulterated amen you can still be a sign board that reflect the life of Jesus Christ amen because to reflect the life of Jesus you don't do you don't need to do Miracles amen you don't need to stand up here and preach amen you don't need to lay hands on people but your life in itself amen can reflect the life of Jesus Amen when Paul and Silas were in prison amen their lives reflected the life of Jesus and that caused somebody else to change his life that Soldier asked what what can I do to be saved to be like you Amen to have what you have amen it caused somebody else to hunger and to thirst to be like them what is our life causing people to do amen is it pushing them to go smoke more and drink more and listen to worldly songs more or is it causing them to come to church to live like they live like a Christian amen we have to examine Our Lives amen this time is a time to examine the lives amen there a time to check our lamps amen do we have oil in the lamp amen because the groom is coming amen we don't have we don't want to wait until we hear the sound and then we go look for oils amen but now it's a time to trim the lamb Amen to add oil amen if you don't have it you say Lord give it to me I need it amen and God will give it to you Amen in closing our read here in the message the unfailing reality of the Living God paragraph 203 amen the prophet says here I've often thought this and we're

never stand a divided church can never stand amen but when we are are united amen we can hold each others by the hand amen those who are strong will hold those who are weak amen and together we can all be strong and move forward amen but sometimes we see people not coming to church do we even take our terms to call them and ask what's going on Amen we have to do better as a [Music] church amen a church is a family amen a family we can have our disagreement it happens we can argue spend one day or two not talking to each other but when the Night Comes we all will come back on the table and

that it will be easy for the logistics amen so remember no service here next Sunday if you come here you'll be the only one there won't be anyone amen amen and um the report on our building fund contribution collection the last collection we had was for the end of J January and our goal every month is to collect $5,000 so the last two the last two months the last two collection the last two separate collections we made in 2023 we were able to reach the $5,000 but the last contribution collection we had uh for January we only made um we only were able to collect 1500 out of the 5,000 we are 3500 short from our goal so February was the month of break and March again we'll be resuming our contributions and if we keep on not making our our goals then we might have to come back and recalibrate um our strategies and our plans so this is just a rem so for March end of March just get ready for the monthly contribution and I believe brother John has a announcement about the Sunday school as well commun um just for Sunday school um we had a couple kids that showed up for for today's Sunday school I did not count the number but not seemed to be the same number that we had we're still missing a couple of the kids that did not show up and I'm not sure if the um from the look of it in the quiz that we had um it appears that most of the kids did not fully read the book of Genesis chapter 29 and 30 so I'm not sure if uh the parents had time to work with the kids on those books but um we don't I did not give a homework for this time because we're going to be looking into a new lesson next time but just make sure that when we give out those homeworks that you guys help the kids with with with with those uh homeworks we put a a message on the church group to remind to remind uh all the parents that there was a homework so just make sure that next time we give it that uh you assist the kids with and make sure that they actually read and um next thing is we so when we split the class with the little kids we're Sister Sister Divine is leading the Sunday school for um for kids about two three years old to like eight something years old and it's happening in the back room there we did um clean up the back room and we repainted the room and the flooring we changed in there so if you have a chance you can go look and so we're trying to make it better uh just to um decorate it much better so that it's more appealing and so we were needing uh we have a budget of $370 that we need to be able to um to get all the the remaining decoration and for for for the back room and so um it's just anybody that has a willing heart uh if you can give it that'll be perfect and for [Music] [Music] carpet so um and I think sister Divine has think she has an update for she Sunday school all right so for Sunday school the kids Sunday school John trans yeah the kids on the school for today um we learned about God creating everything in it with animals people everything and we learned a song He's Got The Whole World he's got he's got the whole world and I have a homework for the kids I'm going to give it to the parents since the kids since they don't know how to read I just have stuff like coloring stuff I'm GNA give it to the parents to give to the kids to color and also to learn one song that we're going to sing next Sunday with them in the Sunday School it's all written on it and if you guys could write the name and the age and dat of birth of those kids on it too today nine kids attended Sunday school I'm going to say their name so the parents are aware of Jasper Jasper Nomi um altes Martha Gloria Miriam Joseph the twin and Joseph the other there's two Joseph yeah yeah there Joseph yeah and that's it amen God bless you and it's it's important that we take Serious the Sunday school for the kids because it's a lot of things that are being thrown to the kids so it's good for them to be learning the word throughout the week they'll be uh and baby and that's all that's in their heads so it's good while they still young to be taught things about the word because the word says if you train a childh the way they supposed to do to come up they will not they will not depart away from it amen so it is very important amen amen um let's continue sing the song as we are being dismissed we can stand up our feet remember just shake someone's hand that you've never talked to before amen your grace and Mery brought me through I'm leaving this more because of you I want to thank you and praise you to your grace and mercy brought me through your grace and mercy brought me [Music] through I'm leaving this moment because of [Music] you I want to thank you and praise you too your grace and mercy brought me through and we are dismiss amen [Music]
