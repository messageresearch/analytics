Jesus Christ is Lord and I want you to say it like you mean it this time Jesus Christ is Lord Jesus Christ that's it one more time Jesus Christ is Lord Jesus Christ amen amen that's a powerful a powerful Revelations that I believe every believer is if you realize that he's Lord and God foreign now I'm feeling real good this morning I really want to do a little dance back there but I knew I had to preaching if this old body is not the way it used to be this is glad to see our brother Justin and his lovely wife questions [Music] you know they're they're real special people to me I love their nature and it's just an honor to uh be the pastor of these two people not excluding any of you but you know it's just some people just impress you more we appreciate them I hope I didn't embarrass them by saying that questions if I'm um but uh we thank God for you all of you I didn't know who all was going to show up because of the snow we've we've canceled at times and I was hoping that you would recognize we didn't cancel this time I'm coming to know the weather now and even though they threatened snow I knew that God would protect us and take us safely back and decided that you were coming and going you love the Lord we have been uh studying news we've been working on the meaning of Calvary [Music] basically taking scriptures from the word and putting on the scriptures from the message you know in reality I hate separating the two yeah because the word of God is the word of God Amen is almost like separating the Old Testament from the new to complete and as you have heard me say the New Testament is the revelation of the Old Testament it's a message of the hour is the revelation of the New Testament and we needed the New Testament and we also need the Old Testament and we definitely need the message of this day you love the Lord everybody um I don't want anybody to think I have favors [Music] um driver we appreciate all our musicians and our song leaders you know amen we appreciate Higher Ground all of you who comes I just feel real good this morning I feel really good this morning I trust that the Holy Spirit Will minister to you today in a special way brother uh John the cooker has been coming to the church basically every day I believe yeah as often as the Lord would allow him [Music] and I have been praying that God will you know stir somebody up for prayer [Music] because we need Revival and you can't have Revival without prayer I asked brother John if he would allow me to come and pray with him during that time and he said yes that's it that's fine yeah and so we have been praying and studying with him for the last two days perhaps that's what I'm feeling the results just for a moment just be faceted for me have uh keeping you um um by the grace of God she deserves and I want to say we we meet at six o'clock whoever want to come that's p.m 9 A.M P.M that [Music] I was going to say this I was hoping that we would have more people today we need some ushers for the church people that would police the area in the back make sure we don't have um strangers coming in making sure that we could keep order in the church as far as deacons are concerned we do need deacons zombies but remember deacons were faithful you understand me it's not like I don't want deacons you know I'm not afraid of you stealing the money like I've heard somebody said I said that's a lie yes we you'll feel good afterwards but we need faithful people is he faithful to come in the church faithful and tired paying um you know what I mean faithful she didn't and those people has to earn that is so if there be anybody here on Seattle currency or anybody on the on the on what you say uh that's true YouTube live streaming please let me know um uh or let us know somehow that you have an interesting and helping out in the church you know that's one thing that denominationals do yeah I understand why they do it is they start anointing sisters as Deaconess is on the The Darkness [Music] that's not the word [Music] so there's a definition yeah in definition uh or qualification that a deacon must meet so we want to stay you love the Lord your spirit because we can do higher higher again if you like [Music] matter of fact matter of fact I wanted to sing that song and he broke out with it I'm like thank you so I can be in the back out of breath and he won't be able to see me back there but nevertheless it was a good song Amen let's stand I'm a little drunk on the holy spirit so this is spelled Miami you know drunk people love to talk holy z boys and family [Music] I want to say to the saints of God it's not about me trusting you it's about you trusting God I'm nobody the same blood of Jesus Christ that saved me it's the same as my blood of Jesus Christ that saves you to remember there was nothing great about me that God saved me I was a sinner and I was one of the worst kinds but God's mercy found me and his mercy and his grace is changing me sargassism and that's why I I feel obligated to tell you the truth of the words in the way that God has shown me so as we stand let us turn to Matthew 12 chapter we're going to read the 38th through the 42nd verse of that chapter and then we're going to see and then we're going to drop down to uh the book of Acts for your your laborers and we're going to read Acts 2 36 through 39. I hope I didn't talk too much but I do want to say people of God I've tried to live my life with me there are no secrets so let's go on and read those scriptures starting at the 28th verse the 12th chapter then certain of the scribes and of the Pharisees answers saying Master we will see a sign from thee is but he answered and said unto them an evil and adultery generation seek after a sign and there shall be no sign given unto it but the sign of the Prophet Jonas in generations for as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's belly so shall the son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the Earth shall rise in the Judgment with this generation and shall condemn it because they repented at the preaching of Jonas and behold a greater than Jonas is here is and the queen of the South shall rise up in the Judgment with this generation and shall condemn it for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon and behold a greater than Solomon is here let's go to acts 36th through the 39th verse foreign therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God hath made the same Jesus whom ye have crucified both Lord and Christ is now when they heard this they were pricked in their heart and said unto Peter and to the rest of the Apostles men and Brethren what shall we do is then Peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy ghosts [Music] for the promise is unto you and to your children and to all that are far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call foreign hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to God if I shut up heaven that there be no rain or if I command the locusts to Devour the land or if I send pestilence among my people is If my people which are called by my name shall humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their Wicked Ways then will I hear from Heaven Hallelujah and we'll get forgive their sins and will heal their land man seem on purpose is pay attention closely to this particular passage now mine I shall be open and my ears attend unto thy the prayers that is made in this place amen let us pray dear heavenly father we come before you as humble as we know how and we thank you for your Amazing Grace we thank you for being so good to us because father you have been better to me and to us that we've been to ourselves there are no words of gratitude there is no words to express our gratitude for its criminal to God Lord we praise you we say hallelujah to your name because Hallelujah is the greatest of all Praises Lord let your Holy Spirit reign in this place destroy the wicked works of the devil and in Your Name Lord Jesus Christ we'll be careful to give you the praise the glory and the honor in Jesus Christ amen amen you may be seated we have been working and ministering uh by the grace of God on the meaning last Wednesday we spoke on another part of that message every believer should come to know what that reason is we also ministered a little bit on to be free and the Bible says he whom the son is set free is free indeed it and I asked the question is it posing Christian what does that mean to be free indeed because that is such a powerful Revelation if we could fully understand what it means to be free you understand me Calvary set us free not partially but holy May complete to use that term free indeed it puts resistance that the statement that was made previously it's true emphatically true Hallelujah so I want to work with the word repentance but the person who brings the offense Hallelujah you are going to do it again amen amen amen when you repent it means that you you do a whole 360. so that's difficulties but you see by the time you repent um we this message that we have in this day as I said previously in many of my services are sermons I have said we come to church to be changed Hallelujah and change can only come about when there is repentance toward God y'all better hear what I'm saying you and I must always acknowledge we were born fairies some of y'all must not think that but yeah we were born fairies we were born in sins you don't have to teach your child even babies who can't even talk knows how to lie they'll cry like they're hungry just to get you to hold them that's the truth why now what we need to see is that when God opened the seals and this new message this new message that that the prophet spoke was in such Clarity so people could hardly believe it Hallelujah the message must be received in order to bring a change in your life the message come to transform you Hallelujah it comes to translate from this Earthly kingdom of God and there are a lot of Christians who have not been translated into the kingdom of God because there is no joy Hallelujah in the Kingdom of God in the Holy Ghost Jesus Christ came to restore it is foreign [Applause] [Applause] [Music] Hallelujah the kingdom is not a place the kingdom is a person is God himself sorry brother gets carried away this woman excuse me forgive me that the seed of God the Jews the head of the serpenter and the serpent would bruise the head of the uh bruise the Christ is healed and that happened at Calvary he said I thought Hallelujah but you didn't see no snakes there you saw me Hallelujah it proves it is the sharpened was a man because it was a serpenter nailed him to the Cross who made mockery of him Hallelujah but that serpent Mr sapona was hidden behind the Flesh of a man Hallelujah well if the serpent was a man and God is amazing have you ever heard of a voice I've heard a man is walking with a voice and you say where is that sound coming from then all of a sudden you see a man coming view hallelujah amen and what we're seeing this morning is that the voice of God walking in the cool of the evening on himself did you remember amen communing with Adam and Adam is that right now if you believe this message the victory of the bloody lamb La Victoria [Music] gave us an inheritance that was always ours he literally put us back into a position with God before the fall I've fallen oh come on somebody that means that Adam [Music] that only can come from God [Music] so the mind of God God is what God wants you to have I don't know it's not your mind it's not your reasoning not your thoughts and I'm gonna tell you something that comes through prayer and Faith yeah yes sir prayer and faith will always work together the prophet of God the prophet of Juror preached the message the unrecognizable of the presence of God or the presence of God unrecognized and it's sad to say that most of us don't even recognize sometimes we think because we don't see him he's not there but that's not what Paul says Paul says in him I live and him and in him I have all beings see there is no hiding place no place if you fully know that Jesus Christ is God that he is the god of the Old Testament and he is the god of the New Testament Hallelujah remember when Jesus was on the scene in The Natural Body they missed him oh lovey monkey they missed him and one great statement that Nicodemus said to Jesus he said Master that's America we know you come from God because only God can do these things at least he recognized no man could do um and he said we know that means he and the board the board he and the Pharisee board knew that Jesus wasn't just an ordinary man right I think even in our day or not my day but the day prior to this one when God occupy the body the form of a prophet they knew he wasn't an ordinary man Hallelujah but they could not perceive it because the Bible said Darkness you cannot comprehend light but because you hear his voice [Applause] because he came in a different way that that was the usual usually that was the way it was with people and to be honest with the majority always thinks wrong he always is the prophecy a prophet that announces coming a lot of people hallelujah is that right I mean Isaiah said behold a virgin shall conceive is that right so John the Baptist says Behold the Lamb of God I knew who Jesus was John pointed him out somebody help me here that's in that day so it is in this case [Music] Hallelujah but but not the fake ones I want the real ones no one says he's the same yesterday the day and forever he's a God that changes my God help us Jesus and we could understand what he's trying to do when God said to Adam be fruitful and multiply um he was expressing God was expressing drinks for me his desire to multiply see in the realm in which he was in which he was in and still is in he was perfect there was no gross to God he didn't have to learn he was God hallelujah but God had attributes and he wanted things that uh in in one of the attributes was that he was a father so he had to have children and in order to have children that meant that God had to multiply himself Hallelujah now he didn't put a holy ghost in us different than the holy ghost that he is Hallelujah [Music] is that right so the Holy Ghost is God he's not the second person Holy Spirit Hallelujah think about it how honorable it is everybody don't get this invitation everybody it's a special class of people yes [Applause] oh almighty God hiding himself in human flesh Hallelujah that's why Jesus says if you believe in me though you were dead yes and he still lives easy and he will eternally forever live Hallelujah and the remedy to coming into this Kingdom it's so simple on the day of Pentecost when Jesus when Peter preached because they said men and Brethren what shall we do because in his ceremony he said God that did you have made the same Jesus died the one that died like a failure the one that the world despises Hallelujah he didn't have any clothes despising and shame Hallelujah and then Jesus said himself and then he goes on to say Hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah but how we going to get there not by might but by false but by my spirit you see I'm on a journey Hallelujah I'm not trying to be the president of nobody's company yo I'm not trying to be some great one in Hallelujah now you having trouble in your life this is what the word says if I shut he didn't say somebody else he said if I shut up Heaven y'all understand Without Rain everything that's living perishes it's what gives life to every seeds Hallelujah every Beast Hallelujah he said now if I shut it up or if I command the locusts to Devour the lands literally saying I'm cutting off your life support [Music] or if I send pestilence among the people uh people say fauci did it is what God allowed it on me he said oh God allowed that God allowed it nothing can pass or come here without passing God first true y'all hear what I'm saying but during that time of pestilence we saw who True Believers were Hallelujah somebody now we we've got to understand that God is in control you know I'm just I'll be licking my tongue but that's only because I'm thirsty you know when you look at foreign amen that's literally watching every move you make dishonest yourself you don't see them but they're there y'all better hear what I'm saying nothing you're doing will not be brought to the light so you gotta make right now can you imagine you know what is going to be on the day of judgments everybody that's not under the blood yes brother thank you everybody it do so that's not under the blood their lives are going to be seen oh my God you're talking about a naked experience just like they stripped him naked he will strip them naked just like they could stripped him naked he will in turn they strip them naked y'all don't believe that that's the Bible see like that's why we gotta be close with his Holiness because that's what the word of God says I do not want to come before naked yes it's on you that means all your religious cloaking it's going to be taken from you and your real heart will be revealed Hallelujah come on somebody but if my people I can't cause nobody here to repentance repentance come from God hallelujah but when my heart is hardened about something I ask God to soften it y'all hear what I'm saying sometimes things get to you and your heart get hard but only God can break up that hardness when your heart is hard he will destroy your heart destroy your children you destroy your marriage because you want repair amen is that right no don't people do this prayer remember tell the insurance man I'm not here for this baby and the angel he launched voices he had to repent he had to make it right in order for that baby to get better somebody help me here don't blame the damn when you know you say Lord happy Mercy he said If my people which are called by my names and seek my face y'all know what that means she turned from their wicked ways I hear from heaven give their sins save the land but it says heal the land because heal the land and save the land [Music] now my eyes shall be open don't tell me God doesn't hear repentance waiting on you Hallelujah is that right think about it no matter how many times Israel fell into adultery or whatever the sin may be as soon as Israel repented so is it with our lives the Holy Ghost justification that kind of justification applies to those who have holy ghosts we indeed means you've got the holy ghosts let me say it again we indeed it's evil just like brothers you did not choose God hallelujah and when you get the Holy Ghost it's not about how loud you can cross hallelujah it's because he's chosen you to give you the Holy Ghost I believe in crying out you gotta go down on your knees yourself you don't think I know what I'm talking about everyone I'm sorry I did that southern thing on you just now let me say it right you don't think I know what I'm talking about you know what I'm saying I mean when it comes to prayer how many of us like going on our knees even at the house the Lord would want you on your knees and you think I could sit up in the chair oh I lay in my bed and prayers you halfway resurrected God didn't stay in the grave he got up out the graves victory was when he stood so let's move on by the grace of God see Israel Israel was so blind they were in bondage and that's the thing they're in bondage I'm under the message and you don't have the Holy ghosts your flesh is still in control somebody help me here yes sir you're still in bondage John 8 31 week 33 yeah you're still in bondage is it free indeed means that God that God filled you with the Holy Spirit now there are no charges and he's Vindicated that you are true son and daughter of God giving you to his holy ghosts there's so many people well I'm in the message I don't need the holy ghost YouTube Hallelujah yes you do and you need the Holy Ghost something that's gonna give you some Joy make you jump out of your seat without thinking about it something that's gonna make you live right foreign you ain't got it like the Bible says or what the people gonna say about me when they're here I know what I'm talking about one of my daughters worked at a Walmart at Walmart and this young man I saw was after her one of the things that used to get me about Skipper's appearance when I would see a nose Jewels I used to instantly get angry when I would see somebody with a nose jewels and the thought thoughts was like go pull it what a dangerous thing that helps in your nose if you're in a fight y'all hear what I'm saying and I went to Walmart I was so angry now I'm a preacher now I'm not talking about when I was a sinner I'm talking when I'm claiming to be Christians I was on the man's job in Walmart none of you have seen me there yeah yeah y'all think I can't get there but I pray God I never once again just so you know it's in my DNA to cross the line is he dead I got all in his face I said everything I could cause I wanted him to hit me first so I could have an excuse to hit him back that was my daughter y'all understand it's something that happens now if it was a son it would not have been so bad but my feet that's the way I was then I've given it all over to the Lord and now but seeing that guy would not hit me I had to walk out of Walmart God said to me the Lord said to me you know you got to make that right huh you know I had to make it right back into Walmart and as that God God for forgiveness I was ashamed of myself and my behavior but he knew I was a pastor but he saw the fury God gave him wisdom because I didn't have any at the moment but what I'm trying to say is Jessica it was a teaching to me that I wasn't dead as I thought I was because and I had to go back and ask that guy for forgiveness see if you got a little something God ain't gonna let you walk away I have a God that can talk about me and that Holy Ghost that you claimed you have absence hallelujah hallelujah then Jesus said to those Jews which believed on him if you continue in my words and ye shall know the truth this is what I love it set you free and you shall know the truth the truth shall make you free hallelujah amen they answered him look how blind they were yeah and you need to repent [Applause] look at what they said we follow brother Branham that's what they said we be Abraham seeds I'm just bringing it to our day this is a great life and we're never in bondage to any man they forgot about Egypt amen they forgot about Persia is only the the best Persia they forgot about you know um you know they forgot about those Nations and those countries and they were so blind because Rome was ruling them let's go home they were in bondage to Rome at that time and they're gonna stand there before the word bondage to any man say it down she shall be made free man most of these people say I thought we follow brother Brandon you don't follow Brothers you don't follow Brothers message people let's put a stain on the prophet's name because of the way they live come on people am I right or wrongful I'm glad I got some on his Hearts here's Resort [Music] yeah people think they could just get away with it and I just feel so sorry you don't know how I pray for this church I pray I need help but I know everybody I really pray not just a selfish God give us a Revival Open the Eyes of the people that we must see how close we are to a Rapture the way you live I don't know the way you live oh we got Grace okay Grace has definitely come down like I said but Grace give you the opportunity to make wrong right I mean our gospels yeah amen can I do a quote here God who is rich in Mercy the other day I would say Lord I need some mercy and I heard he was rich in it so I went and played that day God rich and mercy yes he did a lot of us walk around half unhappy because we don't know if you listen to the message I'm all for that it's just for you today we are told that all you have to do in many places John Church have a Creed or something like that or say a prayer put your name on a book a certain way like that that's all you have to do but that's wrong amen all you got to say is God still a prophet see all you got to say is I'm following the message Hallelujah you've made a Creed out of it more to it than that I'm gonna tell you what Jesus said you must be born again he could care less about your religion of religion he cared about the souls listen what he says here to be a eagle of God you've got to follow the words [Music] you've got to continue and feed upon the world that knocked some of us out day by day Hallelujah now we find them after this time in faith murmuring again continue I tell people you know if you don't like the way I sing come do a better job you don't like the way I preach come do a better job trying to tell the pilot how to land the plane he ain't never had to find lesson in your life [Music] um we sing that song Hallelujah don't let the devil get you down when Destruction come your way that felt pretty good what is it we must learn how to sing Hallelujah I don't know what Peter then was saying when they was amen Elvis didn't know what he was talking about that was the first Jailhouse Rock in the book of Acts Hallelujah now we find them after this time murmuring again because you know what murmuring weakens your face in faith after God who showed you Mercy to them and when they did they were dying on Facebook so you understand when you're murmuring you got bit by a snake spiritually yeah amen you know what brother I'm saying do you say well they deserved it they certainly did anybody that would mistake God's word they deserve to die every one of them deserves desire deserve to die in the wilderness and when they were so sick could do anything about it they were dying by the thousands he made a wave Escape that's what he's doing right now God that's rich in mind that's his way out this is that right you know our age he said repent sir our age repent and be zealous to repent that's the third chapter of the Book of Revelations see he made an antidote for it setting up a brass serpenter oh God in his richer God made a way of Escape drop off your mind so his believing children could be healed brother Brown is not calling looking at himself but his position it's basically the doorway see um because Jesus was standing there and Jesus I am the way and I am the light If any man comes to the father you trying to tell me that's what brother and they it's still unrecognized amen people still can't see it even in the message you know so many people you know they they want to correct brothers and I'm too stupid I'm too fearful bro I'm not I'm not knowledgeable enough I'm not saying as a human being he didn't make mistakes you don't never see me preaching on it Hallelujah y'all hear what I'm saying because you know God ordained all of that amen God ordain every bit of it it may look like it did but God through you above you everywhere God could say stop but he died [Music] we can't break it down I see Jesus every day to leisure amen hallelujah don't get weary just give me 15 more minutes and I'll let you go he said Redemption has two different parts come out of her [Music] and enter into you come out [Music] some people yeah want to bring the world in with them got to come out of the world to enter into Christ there cannot be one thing in your way to really have genuine Faith you must absolutely lead absolutely everything that's contrary to the word of God to enter into faith um now I'm almost done I'm coming to the end of this portion of this message because I really want us to have a revelation if you don't understand it Satan is going to get you at the crossroads if you think because I live right I'm going to heaven if you think you're paying you're tired you know whatever you think that's gonna you know give you uh favor with God and that's going to get you into heaven no you can do all the right things people don't like to hear that there's an impact but this what I'm speaking of is elections God chose me he chose you he justified me he said he might sanctify gave me his holy ghost Hallelujah it was not by works it was by his grace y'all hear what I'm saying now when you know who you are and that you have been chosen to make a Rapture based upon what he did not what you did he became our sin that we might become his righteousness his blood that cleanses us it is his blood that saves us but God who shows oh come on people see this is why people don't have joy because they have been taught amen and they're miserable because you'll never leave it you'll never leave it I'm gonna say it again it's not by your human efforts but you must be born and when he changes your name remember yeah amen amen it's a revelation this is revelation that brings you to a freedom Liberty our freedom when he says a true Christian can do whatever they want to do but they don't do it because they don't want to do it um I believe in growth I believe that every Christian has to grow and because I'm more mature than someone else doesn't mean that I'm better than someone else because we're just the same tree you're in the same tree like I had to learn these processes that were quite painful I've come to to the conclusion that every man saved is truly saved by grace Hallelujah you love the Lord let me finish this let me finish this and by the way I'm talking about in Ephesians he says he talked about our intellectual denominations and so forth all of our education programs has come soon he said it's Jordan This is then we must have have an infusion again we must have an exodus you could stand on the banks of the Jordans Wednesday on uh but but let me say this to you now even though I'm screaming it's only because I love you and I care for you and I know I Fear God that everything I just said to you this morning I have to stand before God I have to stand before God for everything I just said but I wanna I wanna read this quote to you before I let you go there's so much more it's just you know you know we don't even understand our Salvation started way back then even when we were children God Was preparing us for this moment when we didn't even know him he was preparing us why aren't you dead you know how did you escape all of that has been God even when you didn't even know him as God even when you were in the world y'all hear what I'm saying that all of that has been done and that little thing that you have in your heart always recognized him telling you that's God man if you were a serpent Just Dance you wouldn't be here and you could care nothing about God but there is a pool in your life and the pool is not for you to know all the mysteries of William Branham for you to know the mystery of God in you I'm gonna say that again because some of y'all don't agree with that it shows that you're blind and you don't understand what I'm saying if you think all the mysteries of William Branham that's not what saves you Sebastian the mystery of Christ in you that's what you need to know Christ in you the hope of glory I'm not coming against the prophet God as much as I love the Lord Jesus Christ speak evil of William Branham but sometimes I have to say things your attention putting this pitch on the wall and all those kind of stuff all right I have this beach in my house and everything else but I'm gonna tell you something what's greater than that picture is the God above him to keep you going crazy [Music] I'm almost done let me read this code because I want you to make your be aware that everything you say everything you do even the thoughts of your heart remember enough he said you know like in television television has picked up that every time we even move our finger anything nothing's on Capital two members it's on record every word we say is on record now see television has proven that television doesn't manufacture picture it only channels that wave into the television see it doesn't make it
