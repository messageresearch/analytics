[1:18:22] right here in in
[1:18:39] and brother isaiah a wonderful man of
[1:18:42] god
[1:18:43] [Music]
[1:18:47] when i prayed for truth for three and a
[1:18:48] half months
[1:19:07] i said lord if this is not the truth
[1:19:09] send me the truth
[1:19:13] no matter how crazy it is i believe it
[1:19:17] three and a half months later
[1:19:20] within that time range he sent me
[1:19:22] underneath brother brooks
[1:19:26] a man a real serious man of god unknown
[1:19:29] amen so let's get started here everybody
[1:19:33] got their bibles
[1:19:34] their word ready to go amen now this is
[1:19:37] uh a story here that uh you see
[1:19:40] uh sometimes you there's questions in
[1:19:42] the bible
[1:19:46] you read things and you just wonder what
[1:19:48] they mean
[1:19:51] and you gotta wait for an answer from
[1:19:53] god
[1:19:55] i'm a man that has a spiritual shelf
[1:19:57] that can just hold everything
[1:20:01] lord i don't know this and i don't
[1:20:02] understand
[1:20:05] what about this and what about this
[1:20:07] person
[1:20:10] king shelf over here captain shelf
[1:20:15] all right so
[1:20:18] this study came to me a city
[1:20:23] a minister had come to our assembly
[1:20:28] and i was speaking with him afterwards
[1:20:32] and he said unto me he said he said
[1:20:36] uh a certain thing he said a certain
[1:20:37] sentence
[1:20:40] here but he shared this sentence
[1:20:44] and i actually disagreed with it
[1:20:47] [Music]
[1:20:49] and i said no i think it's
[1:20:52] you see and i thought lord why did he
[1:20:55] say that
[1:20:58] and i put it on a shelf
[1:21:02] so i'm going to show you what the lord
[1:21:03] brought off the shelf
[1:21:07] in revelations 5 apocalypse
[1:21:21] and for the sake of time
[1:21:25] and the i don't want anything get lost
[1:21:28] in the translation
[1:21:32] we'll read just a couple verses all
[1:21:33] right
[1:21:35] in revelation 5 verse 1.
[1:21:39] and i saw on the right hand of him
[1:21:46] and i saw on the right hand of him that
[1:21:47] sat on the throne a book
[1:21:49] written within and on the back side
[1:21:52] sealed with seven seals
[1:22:00] and i saw a strong angel proclaiming
[1:22:02] with a loud voice who is worthy to open
[1:22:04] the book and to loose the seals thereof
[1:22:20] was able to open the book neither to
[1:22:22] look they're wrong
[1:22:24] [Music]
[1:22:26] and i wept much because no man was found
[1:22:28] worthy to open the book and to read the
[1:22:30] book neither to look they're wrong
[1:22:36] and one of the elders sayeth unto me
[1:22:40] he said weep not
[1:22:43] behold the lion of the tribe of judah
[1:22:47] the root of david hath
[1:22:50] prevailed to open the book
[1:22:54] and to lose the seven seals thereof
[1:22:59] that has taken place already
[1:23:04] so that would place us in those days
[1:23:10] and if we could go to revelations 10
[1:23:13] verses
[1:23:13] 1
[1:23:17] we'll read two verses and we'll say a
[1:23:19] word of prayer
[1:23:24] and i saw another mighty angel come down
[1:23:26] from heaven
[1:23:30] close with a cloud and
[1:23:46] and he had in his hand a little book
[1:23:48] open
[1:23:51] and he set his right foot upon the sea
[1:23:56] and his left foot upon the earth
[1:24:00] let's say a word of prayer
[1:24:05] dearly father lord jesus lord we surely
[1:24:08] appreciate your lord and we are
[1:24:10] grateful to you lord god we want to
[1:24:11] magnify you today
[1:24:13] and lord we want to lift only the name
[1:24:15] of jesus christ
[1:24:17] lord that is the only name of the heaven
[1:24:19] where might be the same
[1:24:21] saved god i can point to thee and lord
[1:24:23] jesus lord just anoint my brother here
[1:24:26] exactly beside me here god and lord
[1:24:29] knowing me god lord jesus christ
[1:24:30] get beside ourselves your god convey
[1:24:34] your
[1:24:34] thought lord for this morning your man
[1:24:37] the lord may they
[1:24:38] receive it lord with his joy
[1:24:42] and lord bless every soul that gives you
[1:24:44] shall come
[1:24:46] in the name of jesus christ jesus christ
[1:24:48] amen amen
[1:24:50] amen you have received us all
[1:24:53] i explained there last night how i'm uh
[1:24:56] i just stayed i would just say you know
[1:24:58] there's we don't we're taught about you
[1:24:59] know the five-fold ministry
[1:25:02] pastors evangelists
[1:25:09] those sort of brothers and then there's
[1:25:10] that little one that little teacher that
[1:25:12] they
[1:25:13] have and they even even when they break
[1:25:15] it down in the hand you know that you
[1:25:16] know how they go
[1:25:17] and then they say the teacher
[1:25:21] is that one that's just hanging there on
[1:25:23] the edge you know
[1:25:40] i'm trusting everyone's studied they
[1:25:42] they've heard the sermons they've
[1:25:44] heard the message
[1:25:47] and if you're a visitor this morning
[1:25:50] i just the reason i brought those
[1:25:52] scriptures in revelations 5.
[1:25:57] because we want to show a position here
[1:26:01] something that has taken place in time
[1:26:06] the god there was actually an act that
[1:26:08] took place back all the way back in 1963
[1:26:14] there was a man of god here you see
[1:26:17] and if you he felt a poll all the way
[1:26:18] back in 1960
[1:26:35] and he said he said the reason we're
[1:26:37] preaching it he says
[1:26:40] so we can get to see what the spirit
[1:26:42] have to say about it
[1:26:46] and as he preached those sermons one by
[1:26:48] one
[1:26:51] we've seen what the spirit unfolded
[1:26:56] and some people may be uh against or or
[1:26:58] not
[1:26:59] for the the church age book yeah
[1:27:10] you know well the church age book is
[1:27:12] written different than the sermons
[1:27:14] the tapes
[1:27:18] but remember in the very first service
[1:27:20] the revelation of jesus christ
[1:27:23] of jesus christ the man of god said he
[1:27:26] said i'm going to preach this
[1:27:29] you see he said but the book would be
[1:27:31] written out in more
[1:27:33] detail
[1:27:36] amen and all that came up to pass right
[1:27:40] there and then in 1963 now the prophets
[1:27:43] feel the pole there's something huge
[1:27:51] and as the spirit would lead him now he
[1:27:53] come now to the point of the breaking of
[1:27:55] the seven seals
[1:28:22] we're not up in heaven right now but
[1:28:23] we're actually in heavenly places down
[1:28:25] here on earth
[1:28:37] we're still trying to get along with one
[1:28:40] another
[1:29:14] [Music]
[1:29:24] some of the things that the word of god
[1:29:26] would say would take place
[1:29:28] in the time of the open book
[1:29:36] now one of the things i want to talk
[1:29:37] about here is in revelations
[1:29:39] 10 verse 6
[1:29:45] in revelations 10 verse 6
[1:29:48] he says and and swear by him that liveth
[1:29:51] forever and ever
[1:29:54] who created heaven and all things that
[1:29:56] are therein
[1:29:59] are in the earth and the things that
[1:30:01] that there in our and the sea
[1:30:02] later and the things that are
[1:30:07] which are therein
[1:30:10] that time should be no longer
[1:30:17] it's over
[1:30:20] opening of the book marked the time
[1:30:23] or the season that this thing is going
[1:30:25] to end
[1:30:31] in the sixties it only
[1:30:40] [Music]
[1:30:45] god was setting the stage now for
[1:30:47] something great
[1:30:51] there is a promise for the rapture
[1:30:55] there is a promise for the body change
[1:31:00] but the time is over
[1:31:06] it's running out literally we are
[1:31:10] done now i want to
[1:31:14] get into this in i'm going to try and
[1:31:19] do my best here by the grace of god yes
[1:31:22] sure okay
[1:31:23] in ezekiel 1.
[1:31:27] did you know ezekiel 1 if you read that
[1:31:30] whole chapter
[1:31:34] the entire book relieved there are many
[1:31:38] many
[1:31:38] things hidden in that book
[1:31:42] that
[1:31:54] in fact god hand picked this man his
[1:31:56] name was
[1:31:58] ezekiel
[1:32:01] and the very name ezekiel
[1:32:05] you know what the name ezekiel means god
[1:32:09] will strengthen
[1:32:36] the prophet he said he said remember he
[1:32:38] said he said then the bride when he said
[1:32:39] he's the bride would look like it's just
[1:32:41] slugging
[1:32:42] along
[1:32:48] but god will strengthen you
[1:32:51] the bible says to wait on the lord
[1:32:57] my pastor back home was dealing with
[1:33:00] the seven attributes the statue of
[1:33:03] perfect man
[1:33:05] and when he got to the virtue
[1:33:23] you know what patience is all really
[1:33:24] about passions
[1:33:27] have patience with jesus christ
[1:33:32] of christ
[1:33:47] have patience with god
[1:33:52] but in ezekiel now here's how my story
[1:33:54] went okay
[1:33:58] had said this thing to me
[1:34:01] and it didn't set well with me
[1:34:26] i got to sleep in everybody knows
[1:34:29] sleeping in
[1:34:30] like you sleep a little bit longer than
[1:34:32] you should do
[1:34:33] [Music]
[1:34:35] i got a rest and i woke up
[1:34:40] and he lives by a man-made lake
[1:34:44] and
[1:35:38] when i'm driving
[1:35:54] so i saw the name amber amber
[1:35:58] and i went my mind went it write to me
[1:36:01] in the book of ezekiel
[1:36:05] ezekiel saw god the color amber
[1:36:11] yes amen now
[1:36:14] and as we saw like i instantly i was
[1:36:17] like whoa i
[1:36:17] i ran back to brother randy's house
[1:36:22] i sat down
[1:36:38] of why this brother would say a certain
[1:36:40] thing to me
[1:36:42] i'm not condemning this brother i know
[1:36:46] the influences
[1:36:49] amen now so let's run through do you
[1:36:51] mind taking a little trip with me
[1:36:52] through ezekiel
[1:36:55] see what's in there what else is going
[1:36:59] to happen
[1:37:01] now when when ezekiel had come and the
[1:37:03] revelation to come
[1:37:16] and and he caught the revelation of the
[1:37:19] open book
[1:37:23] ezekiel was in captivity as well
[1:37:26] and that open book was sent to him
[1:37:32] amen
[1:37:48] and it was hand delivered to the prophet
[1:37:57] and he ate the book and god said he said
[1:38:01] it's full of woes and lamentations
[1:38:06] there's hard things written in there
[1:38:10] and he said he said i've said this book
[1:38:12] so you can eat it
[1:38:13] that is you don't see the
[1:38:28] so hard i can't even take the mark of
[1:38:30] the beast
[1:38:34] amen now so we see as we as we
[1:38:38] if you when you get home read the book
[1:38:40] of ezekiel
[1:39:10] i see what it's for that day but i do
[1:39:12] not know what it was for this day
[1:39:17] but in chapter five
[1:39:21] at the coming destruction of israel
[1:39:24] destruction israel
[1:39:26] and now remember all the gentiles will
[1:39:28] trod over that holy city for
[1:39:30] three and a half years
[1:39:35] and then in chapter six it shows
[1:39:37] judgment striking
[1:39:50] amen amen now notice here in ezekiel 7.
[1:39:56] it says he says moreover the word the
[1:39:58] lord came unto me
[1:40:02] he says also thou son of man thus saith
[1:40:05] the lord god unto the land of israel
[1:40:10] israel and end the end has come upon the
[1:40:13] four corners of the land
[1:40:19] it's coming
[1:40:31] and after these things i saw four angels
[1:40:33] standing on the four corners of
[1:40:35] the earth
[1:40:40] holding the four winds of the earth
[1:40:44] that the wind should not blow on the
[1:40:46] earth i thank you for
[1:40:48] watching
[1:40:59] but now as we move further in now into
[1:41:01] verse three
[1:41:11] notice the word of god now declares that
[1:41:13] as he's eaten the book
[1:41:15] the end has come he says this
[1:41:22] now remember as as he comes he's going
[1:41:24] to switch from high priest what to judge
[1:41:37] i'll remind you this took place a year
[1:41:39] ago
[1:41:40] one year ago september is when god kind
[1:41:43] of opened this up to me
[1:42:15] [Applause]
[1:42:39] at this time it is over and he says a
[1:42:42] great
[1:42:43] evil is coming
[1:42:46] an evil that can only come from satan
[1:42:48] himself
[1:42:50] does not care about any form of life
[1:43:22] but the judgment strike right away
[1:43:25] in the book of ezekiel it did not strike
[1:43:29] right away there is a time of
[1:43:32] lingering
[1:43:36] because the prophet had called the word
[1:43:38] of god
[1:43:40] he had blasted it out now what will the
[1:43:44] people
[1:43:45] do remember the man that was here to try
[1:43:50] the people
[1:44:02] where they do everything that god
[1:44:04] commanded us to do
[1:44:24] as the time draws closer and closer as
[1:44:26] he says the evil is coming
[1:44:31] he actually tells us what is going to
[1:44:34] happen
[1:44:36] in verse 10 says behold the day
[1:44:40] behold it is come the morning has gone
[1:44:44] forth the rod has blossomed la
[1:44:48] verger flurry and pride had blooded
[1:44:54] the people who received the word of god
[1:44:56] in this day
[1:44:59] have we become puffed up
[1:45:04] and they said that the the phrase now is
[1:45:07] brian pride
[1:45:08] some of you argue do they walk around
[1:45:11] the world in their
[1:45:12] their lives
[1:45:29] the word to me
[1:45:33] has pride butted in our hearts
[1:45:40] simple now
[1:45:44] let's move on here you have one song
[1:45:47] after god pronounces in chapter 7
[1:45:50] that a great evil a great evil great
[1:45:52] evil is coming
[1:46:04] now remember the bible says the judgment
[1:46:07] it must come to the house of god
[1:46:10] first
[1:46:29] and he takes him to the house of god
[1:46:35] he does not take him in our day to the
[1:46:38] vatican
[1:46:52] doesn't take him to the white house
[1:46:56] but he takes him to jerusalem
[1:47:01] the very land that god gave abraham
[1:47:06] the very land that was called the
[1:47:08] promised land
[1:47:11] and that is where the house of god was
[1:47:12] supposed to be set up
[1:47:16] all of israel would come to jerusalem
[1:47:33] and put that blood for a covering of
[1:47:35] their sins
[1:47:38] but even in this day
[1:47:42] as god would take the prophet now to the
[1:47:44] house
[1:47:47] of prophets
[1:48:11] now remember it was not in the house of
[1:48:13] god
[1:48:15] the image was propped out outside
[1:48:19] on the other side so the first thing we
[1:48:21] saw when we come to the house of god was
[1:48:23] that image
[1:48:26] city
[1:48:29] but notice that image was not on the
[1:48:31] east side
[1:48:34] it wasn't on the west side of
[1:48:38] esther it was not on the south side
[1:48:42] but it was on the north side
[1:48:56] and they said like and god calls it an
[1:48:58] image of jealousy
[1:49:01] and the bible said that god will share
[1:49:03] his glory with no one
[1:49:12] let's see here
[1:49:19] he called it an image of jealousy
[1:49:23] saints of god we must be very careful on
[1:49:26] what we lift up
[1:49:31] will there be a man
[1:49:35] whatever the first thing when we come to
[1:49:39] the house of god we must be worshiping
[1:49:41] jesus christ
[1:49:45] on pleasing him or worshiping him
[1:49:49] on glorifying our god
[1:49:53] amen amen okay now and god said that was
[1:49:56] an abomination
[1:49:59] he called that image in abomination
[1:50:03] but you know what he said he said let me
[1:50:06] show you something greater abomination
[1:50:13] and what was worse than that they had
[1:50:15] this image and the people would come to
[1:50:17] the house of god and say oh look at this
[1:50:18] thing
[1:50:36] that the people did not even notice
[1:50:40] that the house of god was blocked
[1:50:45] they could not even get into the house
[1:50:47] of god
[1:50:50] but god said ezekiel break it open
[1:50:53] uh dig through it
[1:50:59] he's going through it easy and he found
[1:51:02] the door
[1:51:06] and god said now open that door and go
[1:51:08] and see something worse than that image
[1:51:10] um
[1:51:14] what i'm saying here excuse me apply to
[1:51:16] our day
[1:51:24] the bible says it just takes a little
[1:51:26] bit of wisdom to rev to understand who
[1:51:27] revelation 17 is
[1:51:33] they foreign who revelation 17 was
[1:51:35] before the malachi 4.
[1:51:42] you know in the book of revelations
[1:51:44] chapter 2
[1:51:46] foreign
[1:52:19] he said he must have been like one of
[1:52:21] those believers
[1:52:23] that lived james too
[1:53:07] because remember he was in the seat in
[1:53:09] the house of satan himself
[1:53:13] antipas means anti-papa
[1:53:18] he was anti-pope
[1:53:23] hey man i like that
[1:53:27] uh praise the lord now so as ezekiel now
[1:53:31] busts through this door
[1:53:36] i want to show you what he finds
[1:53:43] a different way here of teaching by the
[1:53:45] grace of god
[1:53:52] let me find the scripture here in
[1:53:53] ezekiel 8 9.
[1:53:57] now remember he's coming to the house of
[1:53:59] god that was dedicated by
[1:54:01] salomon
[1:54:04] it was broken down
[1:54:13] this is where we're supposed to find the
[1:54:15] very mind of god
[1:54:21] remember if you went to the holy holies
[1:54:23] without them bells and pomegranates
[1:54:27] saying holy holy holy yeah
[1:54:30] and if you forgot to bring the blood
[1:54:34] you were dead
[1:54:38] but as he goes now first into the first
[1:54:41] chamber
[1:54:44] in verse 9. he said unto me
[1:55:08] [Applause]
[1:55:44] and the uniting of christianity with
[1:55:47] babylonians
[1:55:56] he says the net results
[1:56:24] there are actually three i taught a
[1:56:27] study on
[1:56:28] staying away from the appearance of evil
[1:56:32] and the scripture says the appearance
[1:56:39] so it's something we can see
[1:56:42] you don't even have to hear it
[1:56:46] remember the serpent in the garden of
[1:56:48] eden in genesis 3.
[1:56:53] was there an action before he spoke
[1:56:57] that serpent had to move himself out
[1:57:00] from outside the garden
[1:57:04] and he had to make his way into the
[1:57:06] garden of eden
[1:57:35] why is the serpent going into the garden
[1:57:40] the appearance of evil
[1:57:44] you know the prophet of god said there's
[1:57:46] three things that the
[1:57:47] there are deeds and nicolaitans
[1:58:04] he said the first one is they form
[1:58:08] groups groups
[1:58:12] of ministers groups
[1:58:15] you know what that means they've drawn
[1:58:19] their circle
[1:58:26] much like ezekiel
[1:58:31] and the second one is within their
[1:58:35] groups
[1:58:38] the man of god said that they start
[1:58:40] ranking one another
[1:58:47] and this man will preach on a friday and
[1:58:50] this one will never get a friday but
[1:58:52] he'll get a thursday
[1:58:54] or sunday morning saturday morning
[1:58:58] but always saturday service oh selfies
[1:59:03] let the lord lead you and guide you on
[1:59:05] that
[1:59:07] amen i'm going to stop right there
[1:59:13] in the days of the open book
[1:59:19] as this time would linger on but
[1:59:22] continue but as the true house of god
[1:59:25] now notice this was not a babylonian
[1:59:28] church
[1:59:41] he's dealing with the word of god that
[1:59:43] come in this day
[1:59:46] had those that received the open book
[1:59:50] and we see that after god shows him the
[1:59:52] the degradation there in the house of
[1:59:56] god
[2:00:36] in the late 1800s
[2:01:07] and their testimony says it was divine
[2:01:08] intervention
[2:01:13] but even back in the 1920s
[2:01:20] he found out a certain man was a jesuit
[2:01:24] and went to his house
[2:01:28] hello sir well hello
[2:01:33] hey are you
[2:02:09] his whole basement walls were lined with
[2:02:12] files
[2:02:15] file cabinets did
[2:02:31] you were born on such and such and such
[2:02:33] visiting
[2:02:33] [Music]
[2:02:35] you've worked here and here and here
[2:02:38] you've got baptized here and here and
[2:02:39] here
[2:02:41] you're married to so-and-so and so us
[2:02:44] and here's
[2:03:12] what's more scary missing the rapture
[2:03:17] hey man now
[2:03:23] is that okay i'm always trying to okay
[2:03:26] i'm just telling you the
[2:03:53] this is the time notice it says the
[2:03:55] abomination is done in the city
[2:04:00] in jerusalem there are lost people
[2:04:04] in the message there are lost people
[2:04:08] attending
[2:04:17] and the bible says to cry out for the
[2:04:22] people
[2:04:24] and we have to be led of the spirit this
[2:04:26] had to be a leader
[2:04:27] of god and those who died allowed to get
[2:04:32] into that spirit of
[2:04:33] i was like this calling out for your
[2:04:34] brother is
[2:04:47] [Music]
[2:04:51] two times in the message the prophet
[2:04:52] said yeah the prophet
[2:04:54] everybody got he said raise your hands
[2:04:56] if you got the holy ghost
[2:04:58] with memphis he said he said everybody
[2:05:00] raise your hand
[2:05:03] he said now let me test you listen
[2:05:06] he said who here sighs and cries for
[2:05:08] vampires he says how many hands would go
[2:05:09] up then
[2:05:10] [Music]
[2:05:14] god help us god help us say ma'am
[2:05:18] so as we move on here
[2:05:26] i find my spot here
[2:05:30] i want to show you this by the grace of
[2:05:32] god
[2:05:40] you know the prophet of god you know
[2:05:43] there's a way to weaken
[2:05:51] what did they do with our food here in
[2:05:53] america just confess
[2:05:55] they stripped the vitamins and nutrients
[2:05:57] they stripped it
[2:05:59] and that leaves us weakened
[2:06:03] and you can actually do that spiritually
[2:06:05] as well
[2:06:06] you see and then
[2:06:09] uh i'll say like this 1965 does god ever
[2:06:12] change his mind about the words
[2:06:21] and he said he says balaam succeeded in
[2:06:23] weakening israel
[2:06:28] israel he said he weakened their camp
[2:06:32] and you know the bra the prophet of god
[2:06:34] said it was
[2:06:36] the prophet he said it was a doctrine
[2:06:40] he says when some doctrine starts
[2:06:42] certainly
[2:06:54] now what i'll say like this what did
[2:06:57] that brother
[2:06:58] tell me a year ago i'm going to tell you
[2:07:01] what he has told me
[2:07:04] because i'm not saying i'm captain
[2:07:05] discernment or anything
[2:07:08] captain the the sermon
[2:07:24] and the brother was quoting this quote
[2:07:29] and and now remember i came in the i
[2:07:31] came to message 2001 2002.
[2:07:36] i have been serving god as best i can
[2:07:40] for 20 years
[2:07:46] and when we came in i thought i thought
[2:07:49] george w was the guy
[2:08:06] in prosperity kicks
[2:08:11] and i'm thinking lord how much time do
[2:08:13] we have
[2:08:16] and we're talking about how man
[2:08:18] businesses are going well
[2:08:32] we've been looking for him right now
[2:08:48] it could be 500 years
[2:08:51] old it could be a thousand years
[2:08:56] and if i was to say to you today
[2:09:01] we have plenty of time
[2:09:05] you know the prophet said it could be 50
[2:09:07] more years
[2:09:10] i'll be in glory by then
[2:09:18] but what would that do
[2:09:22] to me it felt like he was trying to calm
[2:09:24] my spirit um
[2:09:27] i don't worry about it we i think we've
[2:09:29] been killed plenty of times
[2:09:38] the generation that sees the fig tree
[2:09:41] blooming
[2:09:44] they're all things
[2:09:51] and i disagreed with him i said brother
[2:09:54] i'd be surprised if we had five years
[2:09:58] later
[2:10:01] that was last that was actually a year
[2:10:03] and a half ago that's the
[2:10:04] uno and me and then i let that quote set
[2:10:07] on there
[2:10:10] why did why in fact why did this
[2:10:12] minister say this
[2:10:14] to me because i i i am at the belief
[2:10:18] that this can happen at any moment
[2:10:24] but did you know in the book of ezekiel
[2:10:31] in chapter 12 he says in the word of the
[2:10:35] lord came unto me
[2:10:39] son of man
[2:10:43] he says what is that proverb
[2:10:47] that you have in the land of israel
[2:10:53] saying the days are prolonged
[2:10:57] and every vision faileth
[2:11:05] oh my well you know ezekiel caught that
[2:11:09] revelation he that scroll came down he
[2:11:11] ate it and it's been years
[2:11:16] we got trump in here everything you see
[2:11:21] and if you actually study that chapter
[2:11:26] remember in chapter 8
[2:11:31] of god
[2:11:35] and he actually finds three sets of men
[2:11:40] i'll say like this one set a set of
[2:11:42] women and a set of men
[2:11:45] that has defiled the house of god
[2:11:48] but this saying
[2:12:01] go build your big houses
[2:12:04] whatever you
[2:12:15] if they open books here you live
[2:12:23] you know what the prophet said about
[2:12:24] that because he called it out i'm not
[2:12:26] saying
[2:12:26] that i'm just rea
[2:12:30] he said they built these million dollar
[2:12:32] buildings because they really don't
[2:12:34] believe it
[2:12:37] because prosperity but they forget what
[2:12:46] aids
[2:13:01] when i was standing back there when
[2:13:02] brother brooks was singing the holy
[2:13:03] ghost
[2:13:04] that is more valuable just being
[2:13:08] right there
[2:13:11] in the holy ghost when you receive the
[2:13:14] holy
[2:13:24] when you talk about receiving the holy
[2:13:26] ghost
[2:13:28] you can compare
[2:13:55] [Music]
[2:13:56] see
[2:13:58] i was down at a certain camp and my
[2:14:00] brother had something
[2:14:02] and his voice cracked in this and that
[2:14:04] he's white and people say oh he but you
[2:14:06] know
[2:14:07] that was he's not a good singer
[2:14:10] and my brother
[2:14:37] nothing but divine love
[2:14:43] [Music]
[2:15:04] and the bible said he feared to go to
[2:15:06] death
[2:15:15] amen amen what time is it

[2:21:00] i'm sorry if i'm me
[2:21:04] let's go to 25 there yeah
[2:21:08] now the prophet of god is dealing with
[2:21:09] how we're built we've built three
[2:21:18] he said on the inside that man is called
[2:21:20] spirit
[2:21:24] and he has five senses right that's
[2:21:26] thanks okay
[2:21:27] then he goes the second round then the
[2:21:28] second round jump to number 26
[2:21:32] we're gonna have a little quiz this is a
[2:21:33] little study here
[2:21:37] okay number 26 brother
[2:21:43] let's see oh oh let's start right there
[2:21:45] that's good that's good good swinging
[2:21:46] pop
[2:21:48] does everyone understand this
[2:21:51] you see this is this is visually how
[2:21:54] we're really set up okay
[2:21:56] this is what the word of god brought to
[2:21:58] us
[2:22:00] this is the true understanding
[2:22:03] notice the body realm right there
[2:22:06] this is simple
[2:22:45] and that seed is a predestinated seeds
[2:23:02] brother
[2:23:04] what is this oh guess you see i've
[2:23:07] driven
[2:23:08] i've drawn it out here this is the mat i
[2:23:11] max my art skills out right here
[2:23:14] here we have a a being this is a being
[2:23:19] here's the sinful flesh
[2:23:26] a sinful spirit realm
[2:23:30] but notice
[2:23:39] can you identify this species
[2:23:43] is this space anyone just shoot us a
[2:23:45] shout out
[2:23:47] do you know what this is crazy this is
[2:23:50] an
[2:23:53] animal sassy this is an animal notice no
[2:23:56] soul
[2:23:58] this
[2:24:10] uh dinosaur that's fine too or uh
[2:24:15] name whatever creature starts with d so
[2:24:17] now next slide here
[2:24:19] everybody understand that now that's the
[2:24:21] pattern we're going to go with okay
[2:24:31] [Applause]
[2:24:33] [Music]
[2:24:40] thousands
[2:24:54] brother
[2:24:57] that's it he says now
[2:25:00] the prophet said he says an ignorant
[2:25:03] animal
[2:25:03] not even a soul an animal
[2:25:07] doesn't know right from wrong
[2:25:19] who is this yes use your
[2:25:22] massive theology theological message
[2:25:25] thinking caps here these are two people
[2:25:29] in the bible
[2:25:30] there's two people in the bible
[2:25:34] sinless flesh holy spirit
[2:26:16] next slide brother now look at the
[2:26:18] prophet god
[2:26:20] he had the holy ghost potentially
[2:26:25] he did not have the holy ghost he had a
[2:26:26] place for it
[2:26:32] okay next slide
[2:26:35] who is this
[2:26:38] notice we moved on here sinful flesh
[2:26:42] sinful spirit notice not just faith but
[2:26:46] now we have faith
[2:26:58] this is the unconverted
[2:27:14] next notice here what the scripture says
[2:27:17] there is a difference also between a
[2:27:20] wife and a virgin
[2:27:24] the unmarried woman cares for the things
[2:27:26] of the world
[2:27:27] or sorry for the things of the lord
[2:27:37] that she may be holy in body and spirit
[2:27:41] offended consent due to
[2:27:52] because when you receive the baptism of
[2:27:54] the holy ghost
[2:27:57] john you just got to keep two realms
[2:27:58] clean
[2:28:04] yes next slide brother
[2:28:08] who is this a person
[2:28:21] faith and unbelief dwelling in the soul
[2:28:24] realm
[2:28:42] and as we say we as we teach bible
[2:28:45] studies how did that seed ever get
[2:28:46] through
[2:28:49] he said he got through the prophet said
[2:28:52] to god he said he's
[2:28:53] that that seedline got through the ark
[2:28:55] through the woman
[2:29:00] cain got through eve
[2:29:04] got through to the women he said
[2:29:12] next slide
[2:29:15] next slide who is this
[2:29:20] is
[2:29:24] could you go to slideshow and hit start
[2:29:25] at at a certain location
[2:29:30] oh they're doing the best they can god
[2:29:33] bless them
[2:29:34] okay who is this person
[2:29:37] sinless flesh
[2:29:41] sinless spirit no
[2:29:44] unbelief only faith
[2:30:03] next slide brother next slide
[2:30:07] this is all teaching stuff here next
[2:30:08] slide next slide
[2:30:11] keep going right there no no next slide
[2:30:15] who is this he says
[2:30:44] and notice there is a red seal around
[2:30:46] here
[2:30:50] and not only a seal but there's
[2:30:51] something else
[2:30:53] genetically involved with this person
[2:30:58] genetics
[2:31:10] totally different genetics even though
[2:31:12] there's only one thing different
[2:31:15] you know some forms of cheese are one
[2:31:18] molecule from plastic
[2:31:19] so you could form a cheese that's the
[2:31:22] truth
[2:31:24] this is a holy ghost filled believer
[2:31:25] right here is
[2:31:28] next slide
[2:31:31] why is it so important to receive the
[2:31:34] holy ghost
[2:31:36] because if you read matthew 25
[2:31:40] matthew 25 is the marriage supper
[2:31:46] it's a marriage move
[2:31:50] jesus is coming for a bride
[2:31:55] it's a marriage ceremony it's in
[2:31:56] ceremony
[2:31:58] it's a marriage scene
[2:32:01] and if he's looking for someone like him
[2:32:05] he can only bring he can only marry
[2:32:08] someone of his kind
[2:32:12] of space he can only marry someone
[2:32:14] that's similar in genetics
[2:32:19] he will not choose anyone that's not
[2:32:21] like him
[2:32:46] amen amen and that should
[2:32:50] do for that form of teaching now i want
[2:32:53] to hit one more thing here
[2:32:58] so in the days of the open book
[2:33:01] the baptism the mystery of the baptism
[2:33:03] of the holy ghost the mystery
[2:33:19] but that we know is not a converted
[2:33:21] person
[2:33:23] but why does he give you a new heart and
[2:33:25] a new spirit
[2:33:28] the prophet of god says so eat so you
[2:33:30] can get along with the holy ghost
[2:33:45] well the last things i want to show you
[2:33:46] in this day's the open book
[2:33:52] how many have won a soul to the lord
[2:33:54] this year
[2:34:00] isaiah how about the last two years
[2:34:08] there we go winning three praise god god
[2:34:12] where i'll take this where are the
[2:34:13] droves
[2:34:15] how come there's billions of people and
[2:34:18] no one wants god
[2:34:25] in ezekiel 14. the bible said it would
[2:34:28] be like this
[2:34:30] very very few
[2:34:34] people saved
[2:34:39] it would be extremely tough to save an
[2:34:42] individual
[2:34:42] is
[2:34:56] he says or if i bring a sword upon the
[2:34:58] land
[2:35:02] and say sword go through the land
[2:35:07] so that i cut off man and beast from it
[2:35:10] next
[2:35:22] and notice what the word of god
[2:35:38] though noah
[2:35:52] they shall deliver neither son nor
[2:35:54] daughter even
[2:35:56] fear they shall but deliver their own
[2:35:59] souls by their righteousness
[2:36:02] in the days of the open book it would be
[2:36:05] so bad he
[2:36:31] daniel the one who interceded for his
[2:36:33] people daniel
[2:36:36] job the one that laid the sacrifices for
[2:36:38] his children
[2:36:40] um
[2:36:43] they knew how to get people saved in the
[2:36:45] darkest of times
[2:37:02] but the bible says also we have greater
[2:37:04] more exceeding promises
[2:37:10] the bible says when you read to be
[2:37:12] baptized in the name of jesus
[2:37:13] christ that promise should be to your
[2:37:17] your family vote for me your loved ones
[2:37:21] and to all that are far off
[2:37:26] god will give us what we desire
[2:37:30] i believe i believe
[2:37:58] and the spirit of god said they'll be
[2:38:00] back when the evening shadows fall
[2:38:05] once these things start getting bad
[2:38:10] brother said the other day and it was a
[2:38:13] phenomenal statement he said
[2:38:15] look at 911 he probably told me
[2:38:19] 911.
[2:38:23] church is packed
[2:38:39] only those that have the baptism of the
[2:38:42] holy spirit
[2:38:44] living breathing
[2:38:48] through you will be
[2:38:52] worthy to escape judgment
[2:39:03] [Applause]
[2:39:07] but remember that time that just
[2:39:08] lingered thank you
