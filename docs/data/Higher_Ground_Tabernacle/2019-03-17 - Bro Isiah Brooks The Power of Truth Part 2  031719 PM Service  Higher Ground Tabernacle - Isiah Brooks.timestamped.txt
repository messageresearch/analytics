[1:19] Lord the power of truth there's only one
[1:27] truth and that's God's word amen you
[1:33] love the Lord
[1:41] let us turn to Psalms 33 please
[2:01] while we turning there I just want to
[2:04] say I think sometimes we we forget I
[2:08] forget that service starts in the
[2:12] morning at nine o'clock I am sometimes
[2:15] late so I know sometimes we will be late
[2:17] coming in but it's important and
[2:20] imperative that we try to start service
[2:22] at 9:00 and that means prayer prayer
[2:26] between 9:00 and 9:30 on Sunday mornings
[2:30] and of course that goes for Sunday for
[2:33] the evening services we I feel like
[2:37] we're getting slack and I won't say I am
[2:38] too I have myself but let's try to do
[2:44] what we need to be doing and if we want
[2:47] God to bless us and I know that's a
[2:49] ministry and everybody the whole church
[2:50] can be a part of me that hour half an
[2:54] hour early before service in to pray
[2:59] Psalms 33 and 4 for the word of the Lord
[3:07] is right and all his works are done in
[3:13] truth let us pray Lord we thank you once
[3:19] again for your grace and your mercy we
[3:22] thank you for your goodness and we pray
[3:24] father God that you will be merciful to
[3:27] us forgive us of our sins strengthen us
[3:30] Lord that will be what you would have us
[3:33] to be bless now the saints of God those
[3:37] who come out to the house of God tonight
[3:39] or just this evening we realize Lord
[3:42] Jesus we are a needy people and Lord we
[3:46] we come Lord God because we realize Lord
[3:49] this is the place that we should be you
[3:52] said Lord Jesus when we see that day
[3:54] approaching that we need to come
[3:56] together the more lord help us all that
[3:59] we may see the vision in Jesus Christ's
[4:01] name we pray amen
[4:03] you may be seated we started about the
[4:07] big picture I think sometimes we fail to
[4:09] see the big picture
[4:12] mainly because
[4:14] we were born sinners and most of us
[4:18] really don't think much of ourselves
[4:21] thank God for profit thank God for the
[4:25] word of the hour that God will bring us
[4:28] to a place that we will be able to see
[4:32] what this is all about when we read
[4:37] Genesis we would not have known we I
[4:40] know personally when God dealt with me
[4:43] when I would read Genesis without before
[4:46] knowing the message I just knew that God
[4:48] created Adam and Eve and Adam and Eve
[4:51] sinned and we became sinners never saw
[4:55] the full plan of salvation I didn't
[4:59] understand why it was the drama of
[5:03] Genesis that God when he created out of
[5:06] me what was that all about
[5:08] it took the message it took the revealed
[5:12] word to explain to us what that was all
[5:18] about
[5:18] and how that God in himself
[5:22] had the attributes of being a father and
[5:25] that Adam was his first son if you want
[5:28] to say created son and we didn't
[5:31] understand that Adam was the beginning
[5:35] of the human race and how that you know
[5:39] all of these things took place
[5:40] we didn't realize a man that we were you
[5:43] know I don't know about everybody else
[5:45] but I know even as a denomination
[5:47] denominational Christian I thought that
[5:50] salvation was something that you could
[5:52] really hope for it was never something
[5:55] that was sure you know because we made
[5:58] so many mistakes and people always made
[6:01] you feel like you almost had to work
[6:03] your own soul salvation out you really
[6:06] had to work it you know and you can't
[6:07] make mistakes and I remember when I was
[6:10] in the Apostolic Church how people one
[6:12] lady one girl said to me and she was
[6:14] weeping we had a system there was really
[6:17] manmade and that man-made system was
[6:20] that when we would fall or come short we
[6:22] had to go and confess to the bishop you
[6:24] know close to what they do in other
[6:26] organizations
[6:28] and she said but what if I sin and you
[6:31] know I can't reach the bishop and then I
[6:32] die am I lost I mean that was her
[6:36] mentality and it was not only hers but
[6:38] almost everybody there had this thought
[6:42] in my head I I we got a call the bishop
[6:44] quickly and get it right didn't that was
[6:46] era it was era it was erroneous amen
[6:49] to think like that but that's how men
[6:51] make you feel they take those things to
[6:55] control you with them you know and we
[6:58] find out by God's grace this message set
[7:02] me free
[7:03] it made me free to know that I have an
[7:07] advocate I have one that I can go to now
[7:12] if I sin against you then I'm supposed
[7:14] to make right with you but if I sin
[7:16] against God I'm supposed to make right
[7:18] with God and it was such a freedom that
[7:21] God had given me through this because
[7:24] you see that was just part of the
[7:26] picture when we talk about really coming
[7:30] to see what God did for us we didn't
[7:34] understand even so that we were part of
[7:36] him it took the reveal word it took the
[7:39] message of the hour to unmake us
[7:41] understand that the Holy Ghost and God
[7:43] was the same he understand me it's like
[7:46] you know oh I got the Holy Ghost but God
[7:48] was over here and I just had a hope that
[7:50] Holy Ghost like it was something
[7:52] separate from God and it took the
[7:54] opening of the word the revealed word
[7:56] amen to express to us that no there's
[7:58] only one Holy Spirit and when you get
[8:02] the Holy Spirit amen that is a Porsche a
[8:05] portion of God in you and that same
[8:08] portion of God in you has the ability to
[8:11] do the same thing that's what Jesus
[8:14] Christ says that he in Hebrews 13 and 8
[8:16] said Jesus Christ is the same yesterday
[8:18] today and forever
[8:20] he's a God that changes not hallelujah
[8:24] the power of truth will make you free
[8:29] hallelujah
[8:31] we did not know Amen that the Holy Ghost
[8:34] had three compartments or three places
[8:36] that he could land on we thought when
[8:38] you shouted you spoke in tongues and
[8:41] then you
[8:41] up and down you ow amen you had the Holy
[8:44] Ghost and you were saved you were
[8:46] sanctified and you was ready for heaven
[8:48] but we didn't know that man was a three
[8:51] Pashtu man we didn't understand that man
[8:54] had a how to court he had an inner court
[8:57] and he had a Holies of Holies and we
[9:00] didn't understand Amen that when the
[9:02] Holy Ghost would fall you wanted the
[9:04] Holy Ghost not to fall just on your
[9:05] flesh not to just fall on your spirit
[9:08] but you need a God in your soul it is
[9:11] the soul that God comes to redeem
[9:13] hallelujah and we didn't know that but
[9:17] we solve things we saw that there were
[9:19] people who could shout and dance and run
[9:21] up and down the house yet they could
[9:23] curse they could smoke they could drink
[9:24] they can run around with women and all
[9:26] these kind of things and you know what
[9:28] they still thought they were saved
[9:31] because they spoke in tongues because
[9:34] they said speaking in tongues was the
[9:36] evidence of the Holy Ghost
[9:39] you understand me see how the truth
[9:44] makes you free set you in a place of
[9:49] freedom because you realize that once
[9:52] you are sealed with the Holy Ghost you
[9:55] are sealed to the day of your Redemption
[9:58] we didn't even realize a man that
[10:01] sanctification was a real process we
[10:04] thought Amen once you got baptized in
[10:06] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and
[10:08] you know you felt real good hallelujah
[10:10] clean up a little bit of your act but we
[10:13] didn't know it meant that it was the
[10:15] same Holy Ghost that justified you how
[10:18] many are justified it's the same Holy
[10:21] Ghost that gives you power to be
[10:23] sanctified
[10:24] now the saint of a guy sanctified it's
[10:26] not a a mental conception it is a
[10:30] reality that God cleanses you from the
[10:34] inside out and then he comes along and
[10:37] then what he feels you with his Holy
[10:40] Ghost now you and I know by God's grace
[10:44] we wanted to put everybody out put this
[10:46] way in our way of learning or teachings
[10:49] we thought that Romans nine ten you know
[10:52] if you if you confess with your mouth
[10:53] and 10 nine if you
[10:55] faites with your Mountain believe that
[10:57] Jesus Christ is Lord and you know it's
[10:59] made unto salvation that confession what
[11:02] we didn't believe we did not understand
[11:04] that that's where it began but that's
[11:06] really where it began and you know what
[11:08] it didn't matter what denomination you
[11:11] were in Oh Lord is that right
[11:15] remember the brother just preached
[11:17] brother Craig says did you notice he
[11:20] read a quote where brother Alan said
[11:22] when God healed people called them
[11:25] Christians he never asked what
[11:28] denomination they were in a Christian
[11:32] was a Christian hallelujah
[11:36] I mean it's just like the disciples when
[11:38] they ran up to those people
[11:40] amen who believed in John the Baptist
[11:42] they said have you received the Holy
[11:43] Ghost since you believe they didn't say
[11:45] you weren't believers they wanted to
[11:47] know have you received the Holy Ghost
[11:49] since you believe hallelujah amen then
[11:54] they said well what baptism were you
[11:55] baptized under oh I was baptizing in the
[11:58] Baptist doctrine huh John the Baptist
[12:02] right but there's no God then move on
[12:05] he's no longer allowing you're winking
[12:07] at that you must be baptized well in the
[12:10] name of Jesus Christ for the remission
[12:12] of your sins and you shall receive the
[12:15] gift of the Holy Ghost it set them free
[12:21] is that right so you say what are you
[12:24] saying brother Brooks I'm saying the
[12:26] word of the Lord is right they could say
[12:30] wait a minute I know John was a prophet
[12:32] I was baptized under John and you can't
[12:36] tell me nothing well the children of
[12:39] Israel could have said the same thing
[12:41] when it came to putting the blood on the
[12:44] doorpost in a little I am a Jew don't
[12:48] tell me I've got to slaughter no animals
[12:50] and I don't have to put the blood on the
[12:52] doorposts in the little but you see what
[12:55] it was God's Word is truth God Word is
[12:59] light and God Ward is life and whenever
[13:04] God moves we must move with God
[13:08] God is a progression he never stays in
[13:12] one place even though he's the same
[13:15] yesterday today and forever hallelujah
[13:18] he's a God of the past he's a God of the
[13:21] present and he's a God of the future and
[13:23] he still is the same hallelujah
[13:31] see in this message he says we're we're
[13:35] like a byproduct a created being by holy
[13:41] wedlock who would have thought that
[13:45] that's what it meant to be saved or to
[13:49] be a part of Christ to be wet locked but
[13:52] in spirit we are sons and daughters not
[13:55] just some not some other spirit but the
[13:59] Spirit of the Living God we are in his
[14:03] likeness in his unity in the perfect
[14:06] image of the Living God because we
[14:10] become sons and daughters not separate
[14:13] but the same spirit the same God the
[14:17] same person John in wedlock to the
[14:22] eternal is that all right one thing we
[14:26] do know is that God word is true
[14:31] hallelujah and those who are born of
[14:34] truth love truth and will do truth
[14:39] [Laughter]
[14:41] hallelujah I love that
[14:44] amen how that brother broke up broke
[14:46] that word down the earth last week and
[14:48] says you know how are you offended in me
[14:51] and showed that how how John the Baptist
[14:54] got offended had a a little nervous
[14:57] breakdown right because he did not
[15:00] understand he thought God Jesus Christ
[15:03] was coming to establish his kingdom
[15:05] right there
[15:10] he was going to sweep the threshing
[15:12] floor he was going to work it but eat
[15:15] John was not only looking in his day but
[15:18] he was looking in our day you see what
[15:21] I'm saying
[15:22] and then God Jesus Christ being
[15:24] compassionate says listen there is no
[15:27] greater prophet than John but go tell
[15:31] John
[15:31] he could have rebuked him like you ought
[15:34] to be ashamed of yourself you the one
[15:36] pointed me out now you asking that
[15:39] question he could have done that but
[15:42] he's full of grace and truth
[15:46] and he says no go tell John the blind
[15:49] see the lame is walking the Dom is
[15:52] talking right the captors are being set
[15:54] free let him know that I'm the one
[15:57] that's fulfilling the scriptures that
[16:00] have been prophesied hallelujah is that
[16:04] right because the Bible said Jesus
[16:05] Christ is prophecy hallelujah Lord y'all
[16:11] know what I said this morning y'all need
[16:13] to toss in some amens now even if the
[16:15] word is right the word is right you and
[16:18] I must understand him and when we draw
[16:20] on in heavily well out to the eternal
[16:22] God that's that's a part of him a part
[16:25] of God in flesh I become Brandon because
[16:29] of my father Branham you become part of
[16:32] your father in your mother but in the
[16:33] spirit we become in union with God is a
[16:37] part of God that's the reason that the
[16:39] spirit cannot die he that believeth on
[16:43] me has everlasting life and in that
[16:47] image that he is is on the earth and is
[16:50] in his likeness I raised him up in the
[16:54] last day not a spirit being but will
[16:58] have a body like God's glorious body Oh
[17:02] Lord
[17:03] normal medication normal pain normal
[17:09] sorrow see what we did not understand is
[17:13] that the perfect vision are in the
[17:16] perfect will of God
[17:17] was seeing us in our glorified state we
[17:23] came this way to suffer but then God
[17:27] turn that suffering into his glory
[17:29] somebody help me here see the devil
[17:32] thought that the
[17:35] perhaps we were suffice like a Joe if we
[17:38] suffer amen I'll get them to curse you
[17:42] Oh Joe if you die view it just that let
[17:45] him touch your flesh no no Joe has
[17:49] something on the inside that the devil
[17:52] couldn't touch why because God told him
[17:55] whatever you do don't touch the oil in
[17:58] the wine huh and that's the only reason
[18:03] why we're still protected because God
[18:08] has ordered the devil not to touch that
[18:11] sacred place in us may God help us
[18:19] tonight I'll raise him up in the last
[18:22] day not a spiritual being for we are
[18:26] having a body like God's glorious body
[18:29] the glorified body of the Lord Jesus
[18:32] Christ we raise up in His image and his
[18:36] likeness for I am the Lord and I changed
[18:46] not right
[18:49] that's Malachi 3 and 6 if we're gonna
[18:54] have this church and I talked about the
[18:56] unity this morning if we're gonna have
[18:59] this church full of God we can't be
[19:03] independent we must be unified this is
[19:08] not my work it's not yours it's God's
[19:11] and in order for God to really move in
[19:14] this church we must have a union right
[19:18] hello and this like I was saying this
[19:22] morning you know just like some of the
[19:23] people they had their arms folded you
[19:26] know and then sitting down and blocking
[19:28] God you know it wasn't that they were
[19:30] doing it on purpose but you see
[19:33] sometimes you lock yourself you don't
[19:35] even know what the devil is doing in
[19:37] this enemy come on somebody when we sit
[19:41] here and we all starchy that's not the
[19:44] Holy Spirit
[19:47] that's not the holy spirit that have a
[19:50] starchy not long ago some of the
[19:53] brothers from Iowa City and they
[19:55] probably hear me but anyway ain't
[19:57] calling no names but they were sitting
[19:59] on the net like they was in a lounge
[20:03] protocol
[20:07] you can't come before the king like that
[20:12] you're missing God you're looking at me
[20:16] but you missing God right he's got to be
[20:21] respectful if you don't you know if you
[20:26] don't if you're not respectful to the
[20:28] Holy Spirit how do you expect to receive
[20:30] anything and you know what is difficult
[20:36] for me when I have to talk like this but
[20:38] you know what God don't get me if I
[20:41] don't cuz when he showed me things I
[20:45] must say what he's saying nobody wants
[20:55] to become an enemy but if I can't become
[20:56] an enemy because I tell the truth then
[20:59] that's what it must be for I am the Lord
[21:03] I change not right and you and I realize
[21:10] a man that something has changed in this
[21:13] church it's not the way it used to be
[21:20] the zeal of God is not with the most of
[21:23] us hello it is I mean go and look back
[21:29] and listen to some of those old tapes
[21:31] and hear the joy and the unity we used
[21:36] to have where is it going everybody is
[21:40] because of selfishness everybody have
[21:43] their own agenda but God works in one
[21:47] Accord Ness when they got Israel on one
[21:51] Accord they defeated the enemy and when
[21:55] we can get this little fellowship on one
[21:57] Accord we are we
[21:59] we'll see Jesus that's the truth and the
[22:05] truth will make you free
[22:08] it'll set you free is that right it's
[22:13] just like brother branham said it you
[22:15] know you know let me say like this when
[22:17] you got prophecy and in speaking in
[22:20] tongues prophecy in speaking in tongues
[22:22] will not cross the preacher that's out
[22:28] of order it must wait to the preaching
[22:31] is over and then when that space come
[22:37] they can have it but it could be right
[22:42] the gift could be right but if it
[22:46] crosses the preacher it's wrong right so
[22:52] you and I must understand him and we
[22:54] must work together and it's supposed to
[22:55] be a line line line precept upon precept
[22:58] it's got to be like that only fear the
[23:04] Lord and serve him in truth with all
[23:08] your heart for consider how great things
[23:12] he have done for you and you and I must
[23:19] understand that the truth will make us
[23:23] free set us free whichever way you want
[23:27] to look at it but you're free where the
[23:33] Spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty
[23:35] and you and I need some Liberty in this
[23:38] place hallelujah people say well you
[23:46] don't try to pump me up I've heard
[23:48] brother Branham do it
[23:49] programs that raise your hands presents
[23:52] they clap their hands brother I think
[23:54] say hallelujah what was that you think
[24:00] they would have been running up and down
[24:01] the aisles because of the presence of
[24:04] the Lord but he had to prompt them to
[24:07] even worship
[24:12] help us Lord we like I was saying this
[24:16] morning we've got too much truth to be
[24:20] dead and still out of the millions of
[24:25] people in this world I don't know how
[24:27] many who really believe that Christians
[24:29] gone in the rapture been deceived by
[24:32] Lucifer yet you got the rapture
[24:35] immaterial the thing that's gonna make
[24:38] you have a rapture and we can't be
[24:41] excited while the journey is going on no
[24:44] sir the truth will make you free
[24:48] hallelujah there are no now no
[24:51] condemnation to those who are in Christ
[24:54] Jesus why do you come here condemned
[24:57] when there is no condemnation hallelujah
[25:03] oh Lord
[25:06] the Bible according to 1st Samuel 12 24
[25:09] says only fear the Lord and serve Him in
[25:12] truth with all your heart for consider
[25:16] how great things he have done for you
[25:21] 1st Samuel 12 24 or fear the Lord and
[25:26] that's the problem we don't feel him but
[25:30] don't reverse him like we ought to
[25:32] hallelujah but there should be a fear
[25:35] that should be a reverence amen
[25:37] this should be respecting men that we
[25:39] should have all come on somebody if I'm
[25:42] not careful I'll let it slip I've got
[25:49] I've got to move forward just as much as
[25:51] everybody else hmm
[25:58] serve Him in truth with all your heart
[26:01] for consider how great things he have
[26:05] done for you is that okay now we know
[26:10] brother Branham is a true prophet let's
[26:14] we know he's Malachi for we know that
[26:17] God through him brought forth revelation
[26:19] 10 7 hello somebody
[26:22] Luke 1730 well we don't have no
[26:25] problem with that but you know what when
[26:28] we know that he is due we must allow us
[26:31] we must subject ourselves to the word
[26:34] that was preached whether we like it or
[26:37] not it may hurt but when it's truth you
[26:41] obey it first King 17 17 to 24 says and
[26:50] it came to pass after these things that
[26:52] the son of the woman the mistress of the
[26:56] house fell sick and his sickness was so
[27:00] sore that there was no breath left in
[27:02] him and she said unto Elisha what have I
[27:06] to do with thee o thou man of God
[27:09] I doubt coming to me to call my sins to
[27:12] remembrance and to slay my son now this
[27:16] is amazing because this lady she knows
[27:18] she's not perfect and she says did you
[27:21] come to to expose me to - to show my
[27:24] sins I'll recall them and to slay my son
[27:28] first of all she told Elijah don't give
[27:31] me no no no I'm okay the way I am me and
[27:33] my husband we live together we don't
[27:35] have a son but that's okay that's okay
[27:37] but Elijah says no I want to give you
[27:39] something and so he enquired and I think
[27:43] it was of the the servant said but one
[27:47] thing chief they don't have they don't
[27:48] have a child all right and so God gives
[27:53] this woman a child and brother and says
[27:55] around the age of 12 or whatever it was
[27:57] they were out in the field and he had a
[27:59] sunstroke and he died now this lady
[28:05] wouldn't it be better not to have a son
[28:07] then they have one and he died 12
[28:10] he's just getting annoying hmm so you
[28:15] and I can empathize we can kind of move
[28:17] into the scriptures and see that this is
[28:19] a real painful situation even though all
[28:22] of the expressions are not there and he
[28:25] said to her give me that son and he took
[28:27] him out of her bosom and carried him up
[28:29] into a loft and where he had bored and
[28:32] laid him upon his own bed and he cried
[28:34] unto the Lord and said O Lord like God
[28:36] has thou also
[28:38] brought evil upon the widow with whom I
[28:40] shall join by slaying her son now he's
[28:45] acquired little look but look how he's
[28:47] saying it he cried unto the Lord and
[28:50] says O Lord my god has thou also brought
[28:54] evil upon the widow with whom I sojourn
[28:58] by slaying her son no we just gave her
[29:02] this child no you're bringing he saying
[29:05] evil and he stretched himself upon the
[29:14] child three times and cried unto the
[29:16] Lord and said O Lord my god I pray thee
[29:19] let this child soul coming to him again
[29:22] and the Lord heard the voice of Elijah
[29:25] and the soul of the child came to him
[29:27] and he revived brother Brown said God
[29:30] did not even show Elijah what was
[29:33] happening he did not know and sometimes
[29:39] people think the prophets know
[29:40] everything God don't tell them
[29:42] everything
[29:43] God only tells them what he needs them
[29:46] to know at whatever time they need to
[29:49] know hallelujah
[29:52] and he stretched himself upon the child
[29:54] three times and cried unto the Lord as
[29:57] well so he was in desperation - he
[30:01] really wanted to see this lady blessed
[30:03] he didn't want to bring a curse into our
[30:05] house and the Lord heard the voice of
[30:08] Elijah and the soul of the child came
[30:10] into him again and he revived and Elijah
[30:14] took the child and brought him down out
[30:16] of the chamber into the house and
[30:18] delivered him into his mother and Elisha
[30:20] said see thy son liveth and the woman
[30:24] said to Elisha now by this I know thou
[30:29] art a man of God and that the word of
[30:32] the Lord in the mouth is true hallelujah
[30:38] one incident well two gave her a son
[30:42] raised him from the dead and she says I
[30:44] know that's the point because you see
[30:49] when it came even to Joe Joe says I know
[30:52] my redeemer and God is going to let
[30:55] trials and tests fall upon you until you
[30:59] get the full picture you must know you
[31:04] must know he is truth he is life
[31:08] he is your substance he is your God he
[31:12] is your everything you must know he is
[31:15] your vajura he is Jewish alone he is
[31:19] your only rifle he is all in all you
[31:22] must know and God is going to bring you
[31:25] through those things but that's the
[31:28] whole thing he wants you to see the
[31:30] picture he's your husband he wants you
[31:34] to know him
[31:39] God could just drop it into your senses
[31:42] but there's nothing like experience
[31:48] nothing like it
[31:51] hallelujah Psalm 25 and 4 says show me
[31:54] thy ways o Lord teach me thy paths leave
[32:01] me in thy truth otherwise I wouldn't
[32:04] know which way to go
[32:05] but you must lead me into that truth and
[32:09] teach me this okay when you say teach me
[32:13] that means you gotta go through
[32:14] something but thou art the god of my
[32:18] salvation and on deed do I wait all
[32:22] da-ding that you don't hurry God you
[32:26] can't hurry God you just got to wait
[32:29] hallelujah hey man where this
[32:32] deliverance well as healing whatever it
[32:34] may be you got to wait on God is that
[32:38] right she that's the whole trick you got
[32:40] to understand that God does things
[32:42] according to his own will his own
[32:44] purpose and guess what he's really never
[32:47] late you know how that song say four
[32:50] days late but on time God never been
[32:52] late he's always been on time you may
[32:56] have been early but God has never been
[32:58] late right amen it's not when he raised
[33:02] Lazarus from the dead God knew
[33:06] he didn't even tell Jesus what to do
[33:08] until it was late if you want to put it
[33:12] that way already there by the time Jesus
[33:15] got to the two he had already lived in
[33:18] there for days but those are the times
[33:22] that when it seems like things are
[33:23] impossible that God makes possible he
[33:27] purposed it to look like it become oh it
[33:31] cannot happen what are you talking about
[33:33] yo God your husband your Lord your
[33:37] Savior makes it happen if you have faith
[33:42] to believe say to this mountain is that
[33:45] the word
[33:45] it is absolutely word straight to this
[33:48] mountain thank you Jesus that right she
[34:00] said I know I love that is that right
[34:04] Psalm 16:11 doubt will show me the path
[34:07] of life in that presence is the fullness
[34:09] of joy and at that right hand there are
[34:12] pleasures forevermore hallelujah
[34:17] hallelujah you know I love that because
[34:21] I realize Amen that you know this flesh
[34:24] you can't depend on it this flesh will
[34:26] fail you every time all you got to do is
[34:29] cross at one time and we'll see how much
[34:33] life is still in it here's somebody oh
[34:37] it's true I fight fresh every day I try
[34:40] to kill him every day he comes up I push
[34:42] him back down he comes up a knocking
[34:44] back down why because I don't want to
[34:47] live in the flesh if you live in the
[34:49] flesh you're gonna stop performing the
[34:50] deeds of the flesh right so the best
[34:54] thing you can do is keep him dead buried
[34:56] right so you can walk in the spirit
[34:58] calls it the walking in spirit is life
[35:01] right and the Bible says listen show me
[35:06] the path of life that has he shown it
[35:09] you know the path of life we preach the
[35:12] path of life is that right and in that
[35:15] presence is full full
[35:17] of sadness fullness of joy that but the
[35:23] way people bring it in here they like
[35:25] this Oh Lord them see y'all don't feel
[35:30] without sometimes being up here I see
[35:33] things I feel things I even hear things
[35:35] but I'm gonna tell you something by the
[35:37] grace of God I try to keep God channeled
[35:40] so I won't be distracted you know
[35:43] because I know the enemy but my enemy is
[35:46] not flesh and blood and spiritual
[35:48] wickedness a man leave me in that true
[35:50] teeth before teach me is that right
[35:53] but in the presence in thy presence is
[35:57] fullness of joy and at the right hand
[36:00] there are pleasures worth forevermore
[36:06] so the joy and the pleasure that you
[36:10] have in God is up to you if you stay in
[36:13] this presence it's unlimited
[36:18] y'all know maybe some of y'all may not
[36:21] know but when you go to a bar
[36:24] they put a limit on how much you can
[36:26] drink because they really want you to be
[36:32] able to walk out like you walked in and
[36:36] sometimes when they see that you have
[36:38] gotten over intoxicated they said no mo
[36:41] you may have the money to get it but
[36:43] they won't give it to you they cut you
[36:47] off not with God not with God
[36:53] stimulation he never cut you off you can
[36:56] be filled refill refill refilled you can
[37:01] get as much mini you know what I'm
[37:03] saying
[37:03] you can become so intoxicated with the
[37:06] Holy Spirit
[37:07] he'll never cut you off that's the truth
[37:18] if we're going to be drunk
[37:21] that would be drunk in the spirit and we
[37:25] can't be we can be our Joy's not based
[37:30] upon what people
[37:31] what people think you know none of us
[37:34] should be that way
[37:35] we should our joy is with Jesus and if
[37:39] we could allow our Jesus to fulfill us
[37:42] up then we'll be okay you'll be okay
[37:46] you understand me hallelujah in that
[37:49] presence is the fullness of joy at the
[37:52] right hand there are press this truth
[37:54] this truth will set you free this truth
[37:58] will take away your dead days your dead
[38:02] days and your dying day your sad days
[38:09] right come on you know the world when
[38:13] they get ready to get a little depressed
[38:14] or a little irritated you know what they
[38:16] do all y'all you want a drink yeah come
[38:18] on over today but we failed to do that
[38:22] some of us we failed to do that but he's
[38:29] right there waiting come unto me he's
[38:34] right there waiting this is truth I'm
[38:36] preaching Jesus is never out of reach
[38:39] he's always there he said don't even
[38:43] think I'm in the heavens on some faraway
[38:45] taking a trip he's a nun IV even in your
[38:50] mouth speak him and he'll show up
[38:58] hallelujah
[39:00] I feel like dancing right now let me do
[39:02] a little bit that felt pretty good but
[39:06] my thing is you and I must understand
[39:09] God is real the picture of this think
[39:14] about it we hardly ever think about it
[39:17] and I say we are to include myself but
[39:20] you know what I'm saying is we must work
[39:22] hard in prayer in fellowship to get us
[39:27] on one Accord as long as the devil can
[39:32] keep us divided by families and by
[39:36] distance he has us defeated think about
[39:41] this people of God God planted this
[39:44] church
[39:45] here and we will have to answer for
[39:49] every soul that was not witness to we
[39:55] will have to give an account because we
[39:57] are the light
[39:58] we're the light come on we're the light
[40:01] in this area
[40:02] God didn't set us here it meant for us
[40:04] to just come to church on Sunday
[40:08] mornings Sunday evenings where's the
[40:10] night no most of our works supposed to
[40:14] be darling out there and we were given a
[40:20] cow maybe nobody's come that's okay
[40:23] nor preached how many years 120 and all
[40:28] he got was eight souls but you know Noah
[40:31] had more members than that but as the
[40:34] time goes on church drops people stop
[40:39] coming he preached the same message
[40:41] brother Troy every time I look around
[40:44] he's gonna rain I don't heard that way
[40:47] message how many times you understand me
[40:54] that's the attitude of the people he
[40:58] ain't deep enough but all Nord needs to
[41:01] tell you to get in there off how deep do
[41:04] you want to go how deep can you get when
[41:07] the preachers trying to tell you you
[41:09] need to be born again and you need the
[41:12] purchase of Christ in you too God can
[41:14] seal you up that's the deep part of the
[41:17] message all the other things don't mean
[41:20] a thing until you get Christ in you but
[41:25] you ain't because you can't go in there
[41:27] Old Testament and type this out listen
[41:30] I'm going to preach what he tells me to
[41:32] preach well because I realize they meant
[41:36] that there are many preachers in this
[41:37] message we are not getting people to
[41:39] Christ there are people right now almost
[41:42] saying you don't need the Holy Ghost no
[41:43] more we're in the eighth day and we
[41:45] don't pass through this and we done done
[41:47] that and this and it's just a word
[41:50] hello I want somebody define the word to
[41:54] me the word the Bible said the word is
[41:57] not just letter only
[41:59] is that right Paul said I didn't come to
[42:02] you amen just preaching the word but I
[42:06] came preaching with power and
[42:08] demonstration that was vindication
[42:10] behind the word and if you have no
[42:13] vindication behind the wall it is not
[42:16] the Lord people got all the stuff going
[42:20] on and folks who are so gullible they've
[42:23] been moving right into it because they
[42:25] figure they gotta be deep to be saved
[42:28] Oh God is looking at a broken and
[42:30] contrite spirit that's what he needs he
[42:33] needs somebody Amen who repents as long
[42:36] it's me standing in the need of prayer
[42:40] it's the truth we need more Holy Ghost
[42:44] more spirit in here there's something
[42:49] wrong oh my god I could remember the
[42:53] time even when God first saved me I mean
[42:56] I went to church every day every time
[42:59] they had Church I was I was there you
[43:02] know what I'm saying
[43:03] people said I can go in the detail I'm
[43:05] not bragging on me but the Holy Ghost I
[43:07] knew I needed God I know I knew I needed
[43:10] that atmosphere to stand in this day
[43:14] when you don't get it the Holy Ghost and
[43:16] and you come here and you don't get none
[43:18] you leave out you don't get none and
[43:20] then you go out there to face the devil
[43:21] you already defeated especially if you
[43:26] don't have your own prayer life going on
[43:27] at home
[43:28] I have not yet seen a sad person who has
[43:36] a prayer life I have not seen a creature
[43:41] oh no it's a sign that somewhere your
[43:45] prayer life is not where it should be
[43:47] hmm is that all right because if you
[43:51] seek Him in the morning the Bob said he
[43:52] if you seek him early you you shall find
[43:55] him and that's how it is amen
[43:59] you see people they don't have the job
[44:01] because listen I'm telling you I know
[44:03] what God has been showing me truth
[44:05] you can't blame God for your condition
[44:08] whatever condition you're in
[44:10] it's
[44:11] all salt he has given you everything
[44:14] more than enough that's what the Bible
[44:20] said he is more than able to exceedingly
[44:23] give you a seemingly abundantly above
[44:25] whatsoever you ask or think is that true
[44:28] that's true
[44:30] boom hallelujah
[44:35] don't get me wrong we have our days of
[44:37] battling sometimes Satan just don't let
[44:39] let it come so easy he's always trying
[44:42] to steal your joy trying to take your
[44:44] peace hallelujah but you got to remember
[44:46] who you are
[44:47] hallelujah is that right I think what's
[44:50] cactus great they said when he thought
[44:51] he's smiling and whispered in your ear
[44:53] you a loser I'm gonna beat you and he
[44:57] kept saying that amen until the opponent
[44:59] believe it and when he saw in the eyes
[45:01] of the plummet he knew that all he does
[45:04] is bring the punch oh now he's done why
[45:06] because he had already defeated him in
[45:08] his mind and when the delica defeat you
[45:12] in your mind he knows he's got you
[45:14] already it's just ok but hold I was
[45:20] shaving in iniquity it's ended my his
[45:22] mother conceived me behold that desires
[45:25] truth where in the inward parts not here
[45:31] here in the inward parts and in the
[45:36] hidden part thou shalt make me to know
[45:38] what wisdom who is wisdom but Jesus
[45:43] Christ when God gave Solomon wisdom he
[45:47] was giving Solomon the wisdom of Jesus
[45:49] Christ the wisdom of himself hallelujah
[45:53] and when God gives you wisdom what is he
[45:55] doing giving you the wisdom of himself
[45:58] because there is no other one wiser than
[46:00] God and even Solomon says I'm gonna give
[46:04] you the wisdom love God and keep his
[46:08] Commandments
[46:10] hmm behold our designs of truth in him
[46:14] upon and in the hidden parts now shall
[46:16] make me to know wisdom purged me from
[46:19] hit with hyssop and I shall be clean
[46:21] wash me and I shall be
[46:24] later than snow huh purging is not easy
[46:29] every time I think I proper Janelle I
[46:32] see a scrubbing and a rubbing and a and
[46:35] some action to get it out of you come on
[46:38] so money did you know about God's grace
[46:40] amen in order for Locke to even get out
[46:42] of Sodom Ingemar the angels had to lead
[46:44] him by the hand get out of this place
[46:50] some time God just have to help us we
[46:55] know it we know it's right but some time
[46:57] God have to pull you out
[47:00] maybe I'm just talking about me but I'm
[47:04] gonna tell you something I've had some
[47:05] experiences with God and I'm not ashamed
[47:06] to say it
[47:07] because when God gives me victory I
[47:09] don't care how he has to do it as long
[47:11] as I have the victory make me to hear
[47:16] joy and gladness that the balls with
[47:19] doll has broken may rejoice hide that
[47:22] face from my sins blot out mine iniquity
[47:26] create in me a clean heart O God and
[47:29] renew a right spirit within me
[47:36] mmm this is a part cast me not away from
[47:42] thy presence God took came and cast him
[47:47] away take not thy Holy Spirit from me
[47:54] and God can take it if it's not in the
[47:59] soul if it's just on your spirit if it's
[48:03] just on your flesh but I'm said a person
[48:05] can have the Holy Ghost
[48:06] all this life and still go to hell why
[48:08] because it's just only flesh and on the
[48:11] spirit God needs to be in your soul
[48:14] where the Holies of Holies where the
[48:17] sheriff's rims look and the swept-back
[48:19] wings are there right restore unto me
[48:23] the joy of my salvation David says it so
[48:29] even in the condition listen this time
[48:31] and a man who's not under this
[48:33] inspiration but he knew he was saying
[48:38] he knew salvation had already come to
[48:40] his house but he somehow lost his joy
[48:43] and he says we're storing to me the joy
[48:47] of my salvation and behold uphold me
[48:50] with thy free spirit uphold me you up
[48:56] homie homie yeah listen Jesus said unto
[49:08] them have faith in God for verily I say
[49:13] unto you that whosoever shall say unto
[49:18] this mountain be thou removed and thou
[49:19] shalt cast it in the sea and shall not
[49:22] doubt in his heart but shall believe
[49:23] that those things which he said shall
[49:26] come to pass he shall have whatsoever he
[49:29] said therefore I said to you what things
[49:32] soever ye desire when ye pray believe
[49:35] that you receive them and ye shall have
[49:38] them
[49:39] I'm gonna go back over that one
[49:40] therefore I say unto you what things
[49:42] soever ye desire when you pray believe
[49:48] that ye receive them not that you're
[49:53] going to receive them you received it
[49:56] right then when you asked you got it
[49:59] and ye shall have them right and when
[50:04] you stand praying here's the key because
[50:07] a lot of people don't understand why
[50:09] they prayers don't work when you stand
[50:12] praying forgive if you have aught
[50:17] against any that your father also which
[50:19] is in heaven may forgive you your
[50:21] trespasses so it's when you don't you
[50:25] have something in your art against
[50:26] someone and you haven't made it right
[50:28] hello no matter what you do you tell the
[50:31] truth you make it right because that
[50:35] unforgiving and unconfessed sin is the
[50:39] only thing that a hinder god from moving
[50:42] in the way of your blessing or your
[50:45] prayer you love the Lord I'm almost done
[50:47] just just just bear with me I'm almost
[50:49] done I got one more scripture well
[50:52] we said this morning amen that it's the
[50:55] straight gate understand that this this
[50:58] truth everybody say they got truth but
[51:02] they're those who said well the church
[51:04] was built upon Peter the rock right and
[51:09] and and some said you know the church
[51:12] was built upon Peter some say the church
[51:13] were built upon you know the rod you
[51:16] know you your name is Peter
[51:18] now it's stone but it was not neither
[51:21] that it was truth
[51:25] the revelation see the book of
[51:29] Revelation Amen starts with that
[51:32] scripture where is it the revelation of
[51:35] Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to
[51:39] show unto his servants things which must
[51:42] shortly come to pass and he sent and
[51:45] signified it by his angel unto his
[51:48] servant John who bare record of the word
[51:51] of God and of the testimony of Jesus
[51:54] Christ and of all things that he saw
[51:57] blessed is he that readeth and they that
[52:00] hear the words of this prophecy and keep
[52:04] those things which are written therein
[52:06] for the time is at hand and we know that
[52:11] the true spirit of Jesus Christ is the
[52:14] spirit of prophecy is that right so the
[52:17] revelation of who Jesus Christ is
[52:20] because everybody says oh but he's the
[52:22] son of God watch it it's true but it's
[52:27] false if you believe he's the second
[52:29] person in the Trinity
[52:38] I got the Holy Ghost but it is true but
[52:40] it's false if you got the Holy Ghost and
[52:43] you think that the Holy Ghost is the
[52:44] third person in the Trinity it is not
[52:49] the Holy Ghost you possess because the
[52:52] Holy Ghost can only occupy you upon
[52:55] truth so if there is a spirit there that
[53:01] you think is all holy goes under the
[53:02] Trinitarian doctrine it is not truth
[53:05] because God can only vindicate truth and
[53:08] therefore there is an imposter
[53:12] this is the AC you understand me false
[53:16] doctrine will bring you false
[53:18] experiences it is that the it is the
[53:24] delusion of the devil right that's how
[53:28] the bunch that try the spirits to see
[53:31] whether they be of God if that spirit
[53:35] can acknowledge that Jesus Christ has
[53:37] come in the flesh it will also show you
[53:41] that it is the oneness of God and that
[53:43] God in you listen if you just got the
[53:46] third person in you which is the Holy
[53:48] Ghost where is Jesus and the father
[53:55] jesus said him you got the son you got
[53:57] the father hmm and if I got the son and
[54:03] the father then I know I got the Holy
[54:04] Ghost cuz the Holy Ghost was what Jesus
[54:06] had that was that's what made him the
[54:10] son oh come on son when you and I that's
[54:13] true
[54:14] that's faith you know when people say
[54:17] well we don't need the blood you donate
[54:18] the blood watch it because it's true yes
[54:23] it's false we need the blood but it's
[54:28] the life of the blood we see you can't
[54:32] do away with the blood the blood was the
[54:36] lamb was slain with before the
[54:38] foundation of the world therefore the
[54:41] lamb was slain in the Garden of Eden
[54:45] therefore this lamb was slain on Calvary
[54:48] therefore the lamb
[54:50] while slain took the book out of the
[54:53] right hand of him that sat on the throne
[54:55] it was a bloody lamb you cannot climb
[55:02] this ladder without the blood hallelujah
[55:08] it was the blood that gave entrance for
[55:12] the high priest as well as the priests
[55:14] you couldn't even get into the holy
[55:17] place without the blood and you
[55:19] definitely couldn't get into the Holies
[55:21] of Holies without the blood hallelujah
[55:25] and now you say what do you mean I'm
[55:28] saying it is the Holy Ghost it is the
[55:30] Spirit of God it is the truth of God I
[55:33] don't care how deep your revelation is
[55:35] because all we in this when we done by
[55:37] yarn listen all y'all pillow coasters
[55:40] this net let me tell you something when
[55:43] somebody can produce what brother
[55:47] branham produce then you can talk to me
[55:51] [Laughter]
[55:53] then you can talk to me hallelujah
[55:57] because I'll know that the same God that
[55:59] was with brother branham's with you but
[56:02] no preacher I don't care who it is there
[56:06] is only one Malachi 4 and these
[56:09] preachers under Malachi 4 is only here
[56:12] to resound what he's already sounded
[56:17] when you see these people building
[56:19] kingdoms and things are there sell of
[56:22] their own that's not of God
[56:24] we're not here to separate the bride
[56:26] we're here to bring the unity and the
[56:29] only way we can have a unity is to have
[56:31] a unity of the Spirit and that all slick
[56:34] devil is trying to take the Holy Ghost
[56:36] away from us but that is the only thing
[56:39] that will unite us only thing it is what
[56:44] United them on the day of Pentecost it
[56:46] is the thing that will unite us when he
[56:48] returned hallelujah if that same spirit
[56:52] that being you that that was in Christ
[56:54] Jesus being you
[56:56] as it quitted his body it will also
[56:58] click the nose but you think gonna get
[57:04] you up Jesus Christ was the Lord himself
[57:07] but he need that quickening power to get
[57:10] up out of the grave and you're gonna
[57:15] need it too everybody gonna need it
[57:18] sittin up in these day and message
[57:20] churches for our Lord the teachers then
[57:27] killed the people took away the bride
[57:30] took away the the power of the word the
[57:32] power of the bride which is the Holy
[57:34] Spirit it got listen what have you dumb
[57:37] and uneducated hmm how you going to
[57:41] understand some of these deep things
[57:43] these preachers of bringing and let me
[57:45] tell you something the devil as sleek as
[57:46] a serpent is that right he's using the
[57:49] same coach I'm using it but you know
[57:52] what the devil can't do he can't keep it
[57:53] straight

[58:00] study our word you better look in there
[58:03] and keep praying because I'm gonna tell
[58:06] you something people of God our greatest
[58:09] enemy you know as ourselves of course

[58:21] Eden was between brothers the Battle of
[58:26] Jacob and Esau was between brothers the
[58:30] Battle of Calvary was between brothers
[58:34] did y'all know that Judas and Jesus was
[58:38] from the tribe of Judah they were
[58:41] brothers and your biggest battle in
[58:47] ain't the denominations out there
[58:49] they come in they are coming but you
[58:53] better realize the only spirit yet to be
[58:56] made manifest is Judas himself the 70
[59:00] has already been manifested but the
