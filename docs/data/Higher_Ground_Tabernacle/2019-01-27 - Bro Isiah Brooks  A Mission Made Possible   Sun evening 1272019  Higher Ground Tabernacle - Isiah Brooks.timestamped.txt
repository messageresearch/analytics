[13:55] the word we won't be loaned by God's
[13:58] grace amen it's a little cool in here
[14:01] for you all love the Lord he may
[14:16] hallelujah God is so good to us and we
[14:22] appreciate the Lord Jesus Christ and I
[14:24] think God was a God of humor he loves to
[14:29] do little things to see how we're gonna
[14:32] react
[14:35] so for those of us who may not
[14:38] understand how God feels when he said be
[14:40] hot or cold now we understand by God's
[14:44] grace when God cuts off the furnace in
[14:48] the time of winter you love the Lord
[14:51] he's worthy to be praised and we thank
[14:55] him for it
[14:56] Philippians 4 he's I trust everybody is
[15:01] enjoying their salvation it is given to
[15:05] us to be enjoyed it shouldn't be a
[15:08] burden to us to know that the finishing
[15:12] line is a great finishing line and to
[15:15] know that the work is already finished
[15:18] we're not trying to be saved we are
[15:20] saved and the the the the the the thing
[15:24] that I love about it is that the Bible
[15:27] tells us that the work was finished
[15:28] before the foundation of the world
[15:32] I love it Philippians 3 and then we'll
[15:37] go to Galatians we're going to do a part
[15:39] two of what we did on on
[15:43] Wednesday night
[15:46] I appreciate the Lord for holding up the
[15:48] snow you didn't just give me one service
[15:51] he gave me two
[15:53] they say there's going to it's gonna
[15:55] snow probably around 7:00 or so you know
[15:59] I I just thank God because God has a
[16:01] prayer answering God and you know I want
[16:06] to be able to see every little thing
[16:08] that he does a Stickley in my own life
[16:12] so I can always give him the praise and
[16:13] glory for it
[16:15] because you know he doesn't have to do
[16:16] it but he does all these things for
[16:19] pleasure and then when we see him doing
[16:22] it y'all to say thank you you know
[16:24] praise God let your perfect will be done
[16:26] Philippians 3:13 to fourteenth verse
[16:30] brethren account not myself to have
[16:33] apprehended but this one thing I do
[16:36] forgetting those things which are behind
[16:39] and reaching forth unto those things
[16:42] which are before I press toward the mark
[16:49] for the prize of the high calling of God
[16:52] in Christ Jesus how you doing brother
[16:56] Nehemiah good Galatians please
[17:07] Galatians five we're gonna read the
[17:10] seventh verse ye did run well who did
[17:21] him to you that you should not obey the
[17:24] truth
[17:25] let us pray father we thank you for your
[17:28] grace we thank you for your mercy and
[17:31] Lord you've been so good to us words
[17:35] cannot even express our gratitude toward
[17:38] you there is none like you a God who is
[17:44] so holy that there are no words to
[17:48] express it throughout eternity the
[17:55] Seraphim the Chairman's they all scream
[17:59] out holy and even those words are not
[18:02] significance significant of your
[18:06] excellency but father I just believe
[18:09] somehow when we get there there be a
[18:11] language there be words that we will be
[18:15] able to express unto you Lord God that
[18:19] will give you perfect praise and Father
[18:24] but while we're here let our lives be a
[18:28] praise may it be our lives be examples
[18:34] of your grace may we glorify you in
[18:40] everything we do father we have not yet
[18:45] comprehended all of these things but I
[18:47] know Lord God that the revelation of
[18:50] your truth will continue to reveal
[18:52] itself in us bless each and every heart
[18:56] in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen
[19:00] you may be seated
[19:07] when we see things and I just thank God
[19:15] because God is so good to us
[19:19] oftentimes we we battle mine thoughts
[19:25] and but I think sometimes if we're not
[19:29] careful we'll forget while we're here
[19:35] sometimes we battle things because we
[19:43] allow ourselves to battle them God also
[19:47] ordained battles but we must realize
[19:53] that no matter how the picture looks it
[20:00] doesn't really describe the thing that
[20:02] it really is for an example there was a
[20:07] statue of Jesus Christ that were
[20:11] constructed and built and when this
[20:16] critical this man looked at the statue
[20:19] he was really disillusioned or he was
[20:26] really confused because he thought that
[20:29] the picture did not exemplify the real
[20:33] true preacher pitch of Christ on the
[20:35] cross but there was a man standing by
[20:39] and told him said now I want you to do
[20:43] something I want you to kneel and then
[20:47] look up because that's the way the
[20:50] artist that's the way the sculptor or
[20:53] whatever had made the picture and then
[20:59] when he kneeled and was able to look up
[21:02] he saw all of the agony and all of the
[21:06] pain and everything that went on at
[21:08] kaleri in the face of Christ
[21:11] which brought a conviction to his heart
[21:15] see that's the only way that you and I
[21:17] will ever see Calvary
[21:20] we often forget that our suffering
[21:23] cannot even be compared to what he has
[21:25] suffered and sometimes we look at Christ
[21:28] and we look at his picture and and and
[21:31] for some reason we just don't get it
[21:33] we don't get the full picture of his
[21:36] suffering for us that God would forgive
[21:39] us of our sins we we fail to see in the
[21:42] reason being is because we fail to kneel
[21:45] in order to understand God in order to
[21:49] press through this season you must learn
[21:52] how to kneel you must learn how to look
[21:56] up so that you won't forget your mission
[22:00] so you understand that the suffering of
[22:02] Christ was some little thing it took God
[22:06] in flesh to suffer because no human
[22:10] being could have done it no man made of
[22:13] a woman could have done this and think
[22:16] about every stripe he took was for you
[22:19] not your neighbor you I like to entitle
[22:27] this message similar to the one we did
[22:29] on Wednesday night a mission made
[22:33] possible and the only reason why the
[22:39] mission is possible is because God made
[22:43] the way according to the prophet of God
[22:47] we were not only saved before the
[22:49] foundation of the world but the Bible
[22:51] also tells he also tells us Amen that we
[22:54] were chosen elected and sealed the thing
[23:04] that makes a slow up some time like we
[23:07] know in Galatians they were dealing with
[23:10] the law of circumcision and Paul came
[23:15] along as it's not but who has bewitched
[23:17] you why have you failed to look in the
[23:21] eyes of grace everybody don't see grace
[23:23] you know everybody don't have a true
[23:26] revelation of grace if we had a real
[23:30] revelation of grace we'd be careful on
[23:32] how we judge others
[23:36] we'll be really careful because we'll
[23:38] understand grace is unmerited it is
[23:42] something that God gives us all for
[23:45] nothing
[23:48] because he choose to and we want grace
[23:55] we don't want law we want grace I think
[24:02] I was telling somebody the other day I
[24:04] said you know a lot of people at the Day
[24:07] of Judgment because we be the queen of
[24:09] heaven because we're sent with Jesus and
[24:11] how the Word of God says how will we
[24:13] judge why do you think God takes to the
[24:19] the highest fall of himself and he
[24:24] places it in the worst age ever Laodicea
[24:33] he comes along and he places himself in
[24:37] a people that comes out of the worst age
[24:41] ever because if anybody is going to
[24:45] understand grace it's going to be you
[24:48] and I that's why the scripture calls us
[24:51] Lady Grace and when we come to the
[24:55] judgment we're not one that will be
[24:58] standing there or sitting there sitting
[25:01] everybody to hell will be there standing
[25:05] as Lady Grace you and I would be one who
[25:13] was a lord remember when they gave me a
[25:16] cup of water
[25:18] Lord remember Amen when they helped me
[25:21] when I couldn't help myself
[25:23] Lord remember this one see you and I
[25:30] must understand Amen we're there as a
[25:33] helper he saw what do you mean remember
[25:36] the story I always forget this man name
[25:39] but the Prophet God said that he had a
[25:41] dream and he went to heaven and he
[25:43] couldn't get into the gate and
[25:47] the angel at the gate Gabriel told him
[25:50] says you know what you the only thing I
[25:52] know is I don't I can't find your name
[25:54] on the book so now you've got to go
[25:56] through the white throne judgment and he
[25:58] said as he began to travel he began to
[26:00] move father and father and father he
[26:03] said the light got brighter and brighter
[26:05] and brighter all of a sudden he came to
[26:07] a place and he said the light was so
[26:11] bright and he heard a voice call his
[26:16] name and asked him a question have you
[26:20] ever lied before he said he had to think
[26:25] for a moment and he realized yes yes I
[26:28] have a lie
[26:29] have you ever stolen he said up to that
[26:32] point I guess he thought here but then
[26:33] he found out that there were times in
[26:35] his business actions he weren't wasn't
[26:38] so correct and right and it went on like
[26:42] that and then all of a sudden he said I
[26:44] was just thinking in just a moment time
[26:47] he's gonna say depart from me but he
[26:51] said he heard in the background father I
[27:02] can't think of his name Paul but he said
[27:04] father this man stood for me on earth
[27:07] and today I'll stand with him and he
[27:14] said it was the sweet as far as he had
[27:16] ever heard sweeter than a mother's boy
[27:19] he said hallelujah think about it we're
[27:27] on a mission but if we forget Grace we
[27:32] forget our calling God chose you and me
[27:37] or you and I to run a race in a in an
[27:43] age where it's full of hatred malice in
[27:49] thee where the fruits of the enemy is at
[27:53] its peak hatred on everywhere violence
[27:56] and God takes a individual like you and
[27:59] I to reflect him
[28:01] self in such a wicked age hallelujah you
[28:09] don't even know God until you know love
[28:12] because God is love and I'm not talking
[28:17] about some filial love I'm talking about
[28:20] agape love hello we're on a mission and
[28:29] Paul says listen I'm not telling you
[28:31] that I've comprehended this thing I've
[28:33] apprehended excuse me he said but I'm on
[28:35] my way I'm pressing toward that lock you
[28:39] understand me
[28:40] we're pressing toward it but somewhere
[28:44] down the line we must achieve it it must
[28:48] stop it must come to an achievement it
[28:54] must come to a place where that lock
[28:56] become us and we become the mark that
[28:59] divine love must overwhelm us oh not in
[29:04] just talking speech but let me say it
[29:08] like this all of your worldly knowledge
[29:11] will never accomplish it you can be the
[29:16] smartest man in the world
[29:18] yet be the dumbest hallelujah because
[29:23] education or worldly education doesn't
[29:26] get you anywhere only the knowledge of
[29:30] God hello is the thing that you need and
[29:35] the wisdom with that knowledge you
[29:39] understand me because the Bible said
[29:42] that the fear of the Lord is the
[29:44] beginning of wisdom good understanding
[29:48] of all they that do His commandments and
[29:51] his praise endureth forever
[29:55] imma read another one the fear of the
[29:58] Lord is the beginning of knowledge but
[30:00] fools despise wisdom and instruction
[30:06] hallelujah come on the fear of the Lord
[30:10] is the beginning of wisdom and the
[30:12] knowledge of Holy One is understanding
[30:14] for
[30:15] meaning the days shall be multiplied and
[30:18] the years of that life shall be
[30:20] increased if thou would be wise
[30:22] thou shalt be wise for thyself but if
[30:25] thou Scone it thou alone shall bear it
[30:28] in other words amen
[30:31] you can have the knowledge of a DDD and
[30:33] ldd but what good would that do you if
[30:38] you come to learn all of the the
[30:41] theories of science and quantum theory
[30:44] and whatever more they got out there
[30:46] without God you have no wisdom
[30:51] you just have knowledge and that's not
[30:54] the kind of knowledge God wants you to
[30:56] have this knowledge came by education
[30:59] God knowledge come by wisdom and wisdom
[31:03] come by God hallelujah you see you can
[31:08] be as dumb as a doornail hallelujah but
[31:13] if you have wisdom
[31:15] you know God because wisdom is the
[31:19] beginning the fear of God is the
[31:22] beginning of wisdom scuse me and so when
[31:25] you come to a place and then and you
[31:27] fear God God will give you understanding
[31:30] of who he is you see that's why God took
[31:33] so many illiterate and I'm not pushing
[31:36] illiteracy but I'm trying to tell you in
[31:39] there it is not all that the world
[31:42] emphasizes sometimes we get so
[31:44] distracted because we want approval but
[31:49] the only one that we need approval of is
[31:52] God acknowledge the Lord in all your
[31:57] ways that's why you can have everything
[32:01] set in order you can have the instruct
[32:04] man's instructions on a page but if God
[32:07] takes you a different way you come out
[32:10] better going God's Way then then what's
[32:14] on the page and like are you
[32:17] understanding what I'm saying not
[32:19] pushing illiteracy I think a man if he's
[32:22] got the intelligence to be a doctor or
[32:24] lawyer a president or scientist whatever
[32:27] that is
[32:28] he has a right to achieve in this world
[32:31] whatever he can achieve you see what I'm
[32:34] saying but what will it profit a man to
[32:38] gain the whole world and lose his soul
[32:41] the most important thing in this day is
[32:46] the Holy Ghost which is the wisdom of
[32:49] God it is God hello is that right
[32:54] because I'm going to tell you something
[32:56] with God wisdom you can achieve whatever
[33:02] let me put it this way Daniel was a very
[33:05] intelligent man intellectually wise he
[33:09] was so smart he was the one who
[33:11] instructed the wise men
[33:13] it was his teaching that made them look
[33:16] for star and found the star and followed
[33:20] it Daniel in his day was the wisest man
[33:23] in the kingdom but it wasn't his
[33:27] education where did Daniel contribute
[33:31] his wisdom he gave it back to God even
[33:34] when he interpret the dream is as God
[33:36] you know with all things not Daniel I
[33:39] know it God you know it and everything
[33:43] that I understand has been revealed by
[33:45] you you won't God to work on your job
[33:50] you won't God to work in your school you
[33:54] want God to work in your home wisdom
[33:59] wisdom from God will show you how to
[34:04] make it work hallelujah remember that
[34:08] man bring them say he tried to cast the
[34:13] devil out his wife tried to kiss the
[34:28] deck he that's not how you do it brother
[34:30] he said go get her some flowers go get
[34:34] her something you know she like and then
[34:36] give it to her
[34:37] y'all understand me when you come to a
[34:40] place where all of your
[34:42] education is bouncing off the wall ask
[34:44] God for some wisdom show me Lord how to
[34:48] make it work you don't say oh whether
[34:52] it's on a job with us your boss man
[34:54] whether there's wisdom and the reason
[34:57] why we fall and knock topsails up
[34:59] against the wall because we fail to
[35:01] acknowledge the Lord in all of our ways
[35:02] we fail to ask God for the wisdom we all
[35:09] are brother we're on a mission and our
[35:17] mission let me read this so you can
[35:20] understand where I'm working trust the
[35:23] Lord with all thine heart and lean not
[35:28] to thine own understanding our reasoning
[35:33] will always get us in trouble it will we
[35:39] think like men God don't want us to
[35:41] think like me God wants us to think like
[35:44] him and the only way we can think like
[35:47] him is to inquire here of him his
[35:49] thoughts so he can direct us by his
[35:52] thoughts and not ours who I feel like
[35:57] shouting or if I don't feel God I see
[36:00] God is in the place in all thy ways
[36:04] acknowledge him and he shall direct thy
[36:08] path whether your ways are good whether
[36:10] they're bad acknowledge him and he shall
[36:14] direct your path is that right
[36:19] it's the truth it's the truth be not
[36:23] wise in thine own eyes fear the Lord and
[36:27] depart from evil and whenever we take it
[36:31] upon ourselves trying to figure it out
[36:34] guess what
[36:36] more than likely you're going to come up
[36:38] in such an evil way it's not going to
[36:43] work
[36:43] because you are not your own you bought
[36:47] with the prize and God wants his
[36:50] thoughts to be manifested through you
[36:52] and not yours hello
[36:56] this mind be in you see we're on a
[36:58] mission I'm getting to the point in just
[37:00] a minute because we were with y'all on
[37:03] the individual yes but each and every
[37:07] one of us is supposed to bear the fruits
[37:10] of God's divine nature is that right in
[37:15] other words you're not to have
[37:16] temperance and I have patience I'm
[37:19] supposed to have it all do do you
[37:22] understand what that chart is saying
[37:23] Jesus Christ at one point he was a
[37:26] fullness of God now God has made us
[37:29] individuals the fullness of himself Oh
[37:33] somebody help me here that is divine
[37:36] nature that guy was telling the church
[37:38] earlier I said guess what because you
[37:41] are a poor only Appletree doesn't mean
[37:43] that you're gonna be the biggest apple
[37:45] on the tree every one of those trees
[37:47] every one of those apples amen they came
[37:50] from the same life they hanging on the
[37:52] same tree and there are various
[37:55] differences in those apples one may be
[38:01] bigger than the other one may turn
[38:03] redder than the other one one might have
[38:05] a little more green than the other one
[38:07] but they all apples hello and you must
[38:10] realize by God's grace that that's what
[38:13] we are like I said last week remember
[38:16] those old schools they used to have they
[38:18] didn't have sections everybody every
[38:21] grade was in one building and the
[38:24] teacher if you was on the third grade
[38:25] second grade all the way up to the 12th
[38:28] grade they had to teach all those kids
[38:30] in one class that's how it is in church
[38:35] everybody ain't on in the same grade and
[38:37] you can't expect a third grader to
[38:40] understand what the 10th grade or ninth
[38:42] grader understand but they all are in
[38:46] school and they all are maturing and
[38:49] they all will at some point reached the
[38:51] same level it is okay so what I'm trying
[38:57] to say is this we're on a mission what
[38:59] is our mission i'ma get today in just a
[39:01] moment because if we fail to see we are
[39:05] appointed for a purpose
[39:09] and that purpose is to to reveal Christ
[39:13] not tomorrow today he's the same
[39:17] yesterday today and forever like the
[39:19] prophet of God said we're so keen to
[39:22] look at what God used to do and we know
[39:24] what he's gonna do but we fail to see
[39:26] what he's doing now
[39:27] what is God doing in your life now well
[39:31] you can glorify Him who I tell you how
[39:38] we supposed to handle problems in the
[39:44] Old Testament get Shadrach Meshach and
[39:47] Abednego guess what God planned the fire
[39:52] he set him up
[39:55] but God was on a mission and God through
[39:59] men expresses his attributes here he
[40:06] uses you to express his thoughts for
[40:11] that moment or that time hallelujah and
[40:16] so you got to realize he meant that
[40:19] there was no way Shadrach Meshach and
[40:22] Abednego was going to get out of the
[40:24] fire without going into the fire because
[40:26] that was the purpose of God there is no
[40:30] way you're going to get out of a trial
[40:32] if God has ordained that trial you're
[40:36] going through it but your attitude in
[40:39] the fire we determine how long you stay
[40:42] in the fire when okay you say that's oh
[40:49] let me go to the new Peter James and
[40:52] John thrown into jail hallelujah
[40:56] and while they were under pressure while
[40:59] they were in jail hallelujah
[41:01] they wasn't singing why me Lord whatever
[41:04] I ever done
[41:07] there is no blues singing in heaven
[41:13] there are there is no blues songs hello
[41:19] in heaven and if
[41:22] I in heavenly places there's no glues
[41:26] don't sing the blues God checked me on
[41:31] that I'll sing a song at harming a
[41:36] desert and and I like the song and I
[41:42] really really liked it until I saw a
[41:49] quote a brother branham saying now I
[41:51] remember
[41:52] Amen at that harmony in the desert and I
[41:55] enjoyed it but everybody was crying
[41:59] alright I'm in this trial I'm so back
[42:06] slidden every song nothing was real
[42:11] praise nothing was real glory not dead I
[42:14] thought oh my god and in one man I
[42:17] thought I was the only one thinking like
[42:18] that and one young man at the end of all
[42:20] of the things that's why do we sing all
[42:22] these slow song and he said do we sing
[42:26] all these sad slow songs and everybody
[42:27] leaves do young people leave out I say
[42:29] death exactly right I thought of myself
[42:32] if I went participating I may have left
[42:34] out too you see but it was something
[42:37] gone unawares
[42:41] you cannot convince people of joy when
[42:44] you completely sad yourself your trial
[42:48] is not there to make you sad in all
[42:52] things give thanks your trial is testing
[42:55] you your what you going to every one of
[42:59] us me every one of us everything we go
[43:03] through when it comes down to a trial
[43:05] God want to see if you gonna murmur and
[43:07] complain or will you give him things
[43:11] did you know that's why the children
[43:13] Israel did not make it to the promised
[43:15] land because they murmured and
[43:16] complained everything God did they
[43:20] complain eat enough bread oh I'm thirsty
[43:23] too much meat
[43:26] nothing satisfied there all they could
[43:30] see was the bad part of their trial and
[43:33] they could not even see that their
[43:34] clothes was not wack
[43:36] Oh and their shoes weren't wearing out
[43:40] Satan pointed every bad aspect of that
[43:43] battle to them and all they could do was
[43:45] complain about it and they didn't see
[43:47] the good part that none of them worked
[43:50] for that meet none of them work for that
[43:52] bread hallelujah
[43:54] hey man you see that it's just just no
[43:57] God could not satisfy this is salvation
[44:01] it would have been best if I'd been left
[44:02] out in the world I left out in Egypt
[44:04] then to go through all those trials let
[44:06] me tell you something in this world
[44:08] you're gonna suffer your mines will
[44:11] suffer for Jesus because he's the one
[44:13] that's giving you the positive reward

[45:39] every time God tells you to do something
[45:40] it's not going to be easy he's gonna put
[45:46] an obstacle in your way
[45:50] huh Mary Martha I want you to know I'm
[45:56] putting an obstacle in your way yes your
[45:59] brother has been dead for days he stinks
[46:02] he's rotted but I have a purpose for it
[46:05] I want you to understand by revelation
[46:08] and by sight I am the resurrection and
[46:11] if I'm the resurrection I'm God hmm
[46:16] not resurrection tomorrow resurrection
[46:19] today and I believe that I believe that
[46:22] if we hold faith if we really grab a
[46:24] revelation of faith God can work faster
[46:27] for you huh you don't charge the word
[46:32] when married Martha she could save a lot
[46:36] if you had been there don't you realize
[46:38] we waited on you hands and foot you came
[46:41] to our house we had cooking fried
[46:43] chicken and all kind of stuff right we
[46:46] served you and when when I needed you
[46:48] you wasn't there bad attitude you don't
[46:52] charge God and you know what all she
[46:59] could say is lord if you had been there
[47:02] she she copped off our way of humility
[47:06] lord if you had been there
[47:08] my brother Lazarus would not have died
[47:11] then Jesus was able to talk to her
[47:13] because he saw her with the right
[47:15] attitude guarding talking to you with
[47:16] the bad bad attitude I don't care how
[47:19] faithful you must have the right
[47:21] protocol coming to Christ right am i
[47:25] making sense we're on a mission we're on
[47:28] a mission every trial every test we're
[47:30] going through is to glorify God and God
[47:33] let me tell you like this God do not
[47:36] grade you all occur and he's not gonna
[47:39] promote you until you get the lesson huh
[47:42] he's not like these educational people
[47:46] nowadays said pushing people through
[47:47] school there's no one left behind and
[47:50] they 30 years old and can't read and
[47:52] write no God is not that way
[47:55] you gonna learn it now in my day in my
[47:59] school if you didn't learn it guess what
[48:02] oh you can't spank them
[48:03] those teachers put it on you there was
[48:08] no such thing oh I didn't get my
[48:10] homework where you don't get lunch
[48:12] you're gonna do your homework doing
[48:14] lunch and if you don't forget it all
[48:16] done then you staying after school and
[48:21] if you don't get it done after school
[48:23] after school by the time I'm ready to go
[48:25] early in the morning you better see me
[48:28] in my class you didn't get away with
[48:31] this and they spank you and then sent
[48:34] you home so you need a second I'm
[48:38] telling you - they made you learn now
[48:44] I'm going to and that's the way God is
[48:46] God is gonna make you learn he's God he
[48:50] do love you
[48:51] he care for you and the whole purpose of
[48:54] this whole battle is is to make you like
[48:57] he is you he's bringing you into it Oh
[49:00] Lord I want to be so much like you do
[49:02] you realize you asked him for suffering
[49:04] hello is that what he said you must
[49:09] first suffer with me if you're gonna
[49:10] reign and none of us want to suffer but
[49:15] you're going if you gonna reign you
[49:16] gonna suffer hello and God don't tell
[49:20] you everything right like I tell people
[49:23] I said did you know Jeremiah he went on
[49:25] to say Jeremiah he said I knew you when
[49:27] you was in your mother's womb I called
[49:29] you to be a prophet I called you I knew
[49:31] your name I formed you and God never
[49:33] told Jeremiah how much he was gonna
[49:35] suffer he didn't know he had an idea but
[49:40] he didn't know he's gonna be beat up all
[49:42] the time everywhere he went you know
[49:46] people were gonna stone and do whatever
[49:49] they can Jeremiah lock him up like an
[49:51] animal I just say old Jeremiah I'm
[49:54] calling you but you I want you to
[49:55] understand you're gonna be locked up God
[49:57] don't tell you those things he didn't he
[50:02] didn't tell Moses when you get down to
[50:04] Egypt to deliver the children I got to
[50:06] Janis and jammers they're gonna be
[50:08] waiting on you God didn't tell Moses one
[50:11] thing when it comes to faith God wants
[50:16] you to believe that he is
[50:20] and he is a rewarder of them that
[50:23] diligently seek Him am I making sense
[50:26] now he said this woman who knew she had
[50:31] a need when you know you have a need let
[50:33] me tell you something wait wait it's the
[50:34] saddest thing about it when we come to
[50:37] church we always come to get something
[50:41] but that woman who's a prostitute she
[50:48] may have had it in the back of mine she
[50:50] wanted something but she didn't come to
[50:52] God empty-handed
[50:54] she came producing something she came to
[50:58] church with something she came and then
[51:00] with something to serve God with and
[51:04] we'll come to church and we just want
[51:05] God to give us everything and we don't
[51:07] give him nothing we don't give him
[51:08] praise we don't give him hallelujah you
[51:10] know what I'm saying we I'm saying
[51:11] generally but there are those who come
[51:14] but when you come to church you supposed
[51:17] to bring something with you bring some
[51:19] praise bring some Thanksgiving bring
[51:22] some anointing bring something to give
[51:24] to God and when you bring something to
[51:27] give to God you don't have to open your
[51:29] mouth he would then say what would you
[51:31] have me to do as simple is it you don't
[51:37] have to ask him he already knows what
[51:39] you need but when you come not being
[51:41] selfish you come to give God worship you
[51:45] come to give him praise you come to wash
[51:47] his feet shout who praise God when
[51:50] nobody else is doing it you go get
[51:52] somebody he's the same yesterday today
[51:55] and forever and he see that you are you
[51:58] have you're on a mission every Church
[52:00] time you come to church you ought to be
[52:01] on a mission a mission to entertain him
[52:06] not to be entertained but God going to
[52:12] always put something in your way he's
[52:13] not going to make it easy for you oh you
[52:17] know sometimes our family baby's awesome
[52:19] that cripples you here's a time in your
[52:24] life you got to grow up and be a man or
[52:26] be a woman or whatever it is you got to
[52:29] take the links you got to take the punch
[52:31] because that attitude won't work with
[52:33] God hallelujah when God said cry
[52:37] God's sake grow up and God gonna push
[52:40] you through it even if you don't want to
[52:41] go y'all know what I'm saying let me say
[52:44] it like this I I see no terrible thing
[52:46] in my life I thought it was the worst
[52:47] worst thing I ever seen my brother and
[52:49] his best friend start fighting and my
[52:51] brother I don't know who started it I
[52:53] got down there after that started back
[52:55] in the day when friend's fault everybody
[52:58] gathered around and made sure to fight
[53:00] with fair they didn't break it up
[53:03] because they knew they were gonna need
[53:05] this somewhere down the line you needed
[53:08] to know how to fight I didn't understand
[53:12] the concept my brother kept trying to
[53:14] get out of there my brother said get
[53:16] back in there blood everywhere boys
[53:22] Elementary boys beating each other today
[53:25] bleeding but it took the fear out of
[53:30] them it made them young man and I don't
[53:34] mean no harm when my brother grew up he
[53:36] was a terror
[53:38] every time somebody heard the name
[53:40] Mickey they backed up because they knew
[53:44] he was a hard cider my brother when he
[53:47] was fight he take his shirt off to make
[53:49] sure the enemy had nothing to grab and
[53:53] he went at it youngster but what
[53:58] happened every time I saw him in a fight
[54:00] I saw him as a boy feeling sorry for it
[54:06] thinking my brother's them they were so
[54:08] mean why they doing their duty who but
[54:11] did you know what those two boys have to
[54:13] finish fighting still remain friends
[54:17] needless to say my brother didn't win
[54:19] but God took they took they took the
[54:23] fear out of him cuz the other guy was a
[54:25] little bigger than him you know but my
[54:28] point is there was a lesson in that
[54:30] there was a lesson I didn't have that
[54:32] kind of a conflict I didn't have that
[54:34] kind of fight and then when I got into
[54:36] seventh grade I had three guys jumped me
[54:37] and beat me good bloody for no apparent
[54:41] reason they miss they think they did
[54:44] I was somebody else hello God took care
[54:49] God took care there then came making
[54:57] what it's the truth y'all who believe
[55:02] that I'm telling y'all some even then
[55:04] God was taking hallelujah
[55:07] now let me move on to say that even when
[55:10] I was a sinner if God battled for me
[55:12] what about now
[55:17] even David don't be afraid to pray like
[55:20] David I said God David prayed like this
[55:23] so I'm praying like David avenge me of
[55:26] my adversary huh you say I can't pray
[55:34] like that God said David was a man out
[55:36] there Zhan ha
[55:38] avenge me of my adversary but when you
[55:42] pray like that you got to believe it
[55:43] that God is now working in your behalf
[55:46] and your enemy is under defeated phone
[55:49] hello
[55:50] I don't give is your boss man I don't
[55:53] care who it is you have a right oh you
[56:00] say brother instead ain't right god is
[56:02] love but the Bible says this God hated
[56:09] Esau and he loved Jacob I was trying to
[56:13] tell her brother the other day I said
[56:14] God don't love everybody cuz everybody
[56:17] is not here hello it was God who
[56:26] destroyed those enemies why brother
[56:33] Branham said like this he said listen he
[56:36] said you've seen me in battle he said
[56:38] but you've never seen God in battle he
[56:40] said won't you wait till you see God in
[56:42] battle God will fight for you you put
[56:46] him in the battle you stay behind you
[56:48] let him fight your battle but you gotta
[56:51] believe he's gonna find it I believe it
[56:58] you and I are on a mission and we will
[57:01] not return back to God voice we were not
[57:06] returned back to God defeated God put
[57:09] enemies he put enemies in our way not
[57:12] the countdown to him but to defeat them
[57:15] by way of what path by allowing God to
[57:19] fight your battles you've never seen
[57:21] brother Branham with his fists up like
[57:23] that God told him say listen if you
[57:26] don't move and go out west you're gonna
[57:28] beat this man up gave him a vision
[57:30] brother that'll beat this man in this
[57:32] vision kicked him all down the hill and
[57:34] everything all all over a tree that the
[57:37] man wanted to cut down in his yard and
[57:41] brother Branham didn't want that tree
[57:43] cut down and God said if you don't move
[57:45] you're gonna beat this man just like
[57:47] this you better go out west now when you
[57:49] see this happening when you see the
[57:51] things coming into your heart in your
[57:53] yard move huh Oh what you saying I'm
[57:59] saying right now even with the Holy
[58:01] Ghost if the Holy Ghost didn't stop you
[58:03] and hold you you would be you would take
[58:07] certain things into your hands don't
[58:12] mean you ain't got the holy gold it's
[58:14] just that you got out of the way young
[58:17] it's the truth but our mission is not to
[58:22] reflect ourselves our mission is to
[58:24] reflect Christ it is Christ that you
[58:28] come you are not made for nothing else
[58:30] you might be a a teacher a lawyer a
[58:33] doctor whatever they may be but your God
[58:35] intended you intended for you to be the
[58:39] bride of Jesus Christ for this hour and
[58:41] reflect him home there that's why you
[58:44] must die daily you got to die if you
[58:47] don't pray God killed this old man don't
[58:50] let your lawn to the bar with me
[58:52] throughout the day
[58:53] Oh God have you seen me step out check
[58:55] me and bring me back in it gotta be a
[58:58] constant prayer it's got to be a
[59:00] constant forgive me not forgive me Lord
[59:02] I'm sorry help me Jesus
[59:04] that's daily everyday am I the only one
[59:11] I'm on a mission and I cannot afford to
[59:15] allow the devil to trip me or to hinder
[59:20] me which he can I mean you you basically
[59:24] saw you know God raising up sense and
[59:28] Hort Nazarite from birth and you think
[59:33] it was gonna be easy you and I have no
[59:36] idea the battles that Samson went
[59:39] through oh we can see him carrying the
[59:41] gates of Gaza Gaza however you want to
[59:43] pronounce it
[59:44] hallelujah hoho he took that job born of
[59:47] an ass and he killed was a thousand pal
[59:50] him up I don't know how many pounds he
[59:55] had but the point is it wasn't easy
[1:00:00] it wasn't like he didn't get tired it
[1:00:04] wasn't like that while he was fighting
[1:00:05] during the battle he wasn't asking God
[1:00:07] helped me give me strength gave me
[1:00:09] strength it was constant every every
[1:00:12] battle he calls for constant prayer
[1:00:15] constant calling on the Lord constantly
[1:00:17] a man you can never call him too much
[1:00:25] all of us I said down here and I
[1:00:29] preached the same message we know down
[1:00:32] in Iowa City but I told him I like I
[1:00:33] said like this 20:18 was the worst year
[1:00:36] of my entire saved life I've never had
[1:00:39] so many spiritual battles in my life you
[1:00:44] say what you mean brother books in every
[1:00:47] way financially naturally sexually when
[1:00:55] I got it there sexually about ready
[1:00:58] don't look like no saint to me I know
[1:01:00] what you are
[1:01:02] without the Holy Ghost we all battle in
[1:01:05] the flesh tell me a day you've got that
[1:01:10] goes by where sexual thoughts don't come
[1:01:12] to your mind and then I call you a liar
[1:01:17] it doesn't mean entertain it it's gonna
[1:01:21] come to your mind you got to realize
[1:01:23] that the god of the
[1:01:24] world is about sex God took you and said
[1:01:29] Pete a chaste virgin in the sick dark
[1:01:33] world where everybody is being overload
[1:01:39] with sexual things some of the books you
[1:01:43] go to the store they back then they call
[1:01:46] it pornography
[1:01:48] now they got it on the shelves naked
[1:01:55] women and men and it just grosses me out
[1:02:00] when I see a man with his shirt off
[1:02:02] holding his baby that grosses me I'm
[1:02:07] sorry some of y'all did that but that
[1:02:08] does I don't understand the contact if
[1:02:12] it was a woman that's some different but
[1:02:21] my wife will tell you none of my
[1:02:25] children that I know of have ever seen
[1:02:28] me with my shirt off why cuz you naked
[1:02:39] a loo but anyway that's my wisdom hello
[1:02:45] what are you saying
[1:02:46] children remember things and understand
[1:02:50] everything you do is by inspiration of a
[1:02:53] spirit everything you do and understand
[1:02:58] Amen that nakedness is nakedness
[1:03:00] it doesn't matter brother madam said
[1:03:03] that that there are certain ways we
[1:03:05] should dress in our house we shouldn't
[1:03:07] go certain ways in our own house why
[1:03:12] because of angels we don't see them but
[1:03:19] they see us I just don't go around the
[1:03:24] house certain ways I remember I remember
[1:03:31] one time I took a picture my shirt off
[1:03:34] in my phone and my grandson got my phone
[1:03:39] and they laughing him and his sister I'm
[1:03:44] thinking you know a before and after but
[1:03:50] this one away this was the before
[1:03:51] picture and to me I look gross ah and
[1:03:58] I'm telling you when I realized they
[1:04:01] were looking at my picture I honestly
[1:04:05] felt like I had been raped or molested
[1:04:08] seriously that's how serious I took it
[1:04:10] and I was so angry literally I could
[1:04:16] have done something but God kept me and
[1:04:19] I was about to cry and I said to you I
[1:04:23] said I said to my grandson it's bad
[1:04:25] enough you were looking at it but then
[1:04:28] you show it to your sister hello don't
[1:04:32] you know that imprinted her mind yeah
[1:04:37] maybe I'm too much of that I don't know
[1:04:40] but it's just a way I made
[1:04:48] I just know when I was a child I walked
[1:04:53] in and saw things and those things are
[1:04:56] still in my mind hello
[1:04:59] I didn't understand what I saw but I
[1:05:02] remember seeing what I saw and for some
[1:05:05] reason I automatically knew what I saw
[1:05:08] was not right still in my mind 60 2 3
[1:05:14] whatever years old I got off on that I'm
[1:05:17] sorry but let's move on we are on a
[1:05:20] mission right I don't give me a few more
[1:05:22] minutes I took kind of went off on that
[1:05:24] but give me a few more minutes minutes
[1:05:26] listen you and I must understand we are
[1:05:29] the greatest secret of God it's exciting
[1:05:37] me we are the greatest secret of God in
[1:05:42] this day hello Mary was the greatest
[1:05:52] secret of God in her day if they knew
[1:05:59] she was carrying the Christ child even
[1:06:02] in her pregnancy Satan would have tried
[1:06:05] to get rid of her somehow some way and
[1:06:09] God told her you won't have a child and
[1:06:12] guess what God fixed it and made her rod
[1:06:18] that long distance on a donkey to
[1:06:22] Bethlehem hear them say in the time of
[1:06:30] her expectation
[1:06:31] she had the rydych you understand me it
[1:06:36] wasn't like a Cadillac it was a bumpy
[1:06:39] road it was uncomfortable come on
[1:06:42] somebody my wife Adele you when you are
[1:06:44] not that final stage things becomes
[1:06:47] uncomfortable she rode that that donkey
[1:06:51] and then when she got there exhausted
[1:06:56] and tired and ready for a room and ready
[1:07:00] to lay down and ready
[1:07:02] maybe her feet was swollen or whatever
[1:07:04] the case may be they tell them sorry
[1:07:10] there's no room in the air because God
[1:07:18] had a stable yeah see how God fixed it
[1:07:23] up God had a stable and in that stable
[1:07:32] is what Christ was to be born and she
[1:07:37] could have had an altitude God told me I
[1:07:41] was gonna have this Christ child but how
[1:07:44] can God put me in a manger a stable but
[1:07:50] cows and all of that you know what she
[1:07:54] more than likely never thought about it
[1:07:57] she never do and she probably never
[1:07:59] thought oh the lamb of God is born in a
[1:08:02] stable no no God was not working God was
[1:08:08] doing something that even Mary and
[1:08:10] Joseph didn't understand right because
[1:08:12] when the Shepherd's came and told them
[1:08:15] their experience in the field it is it
[1:08:17] alarmed them not when the wise men came
[1:08:24] pretty much so the same but my point is
[1:08:27] when the Shepherd's came and said we
[1:08:29] have had from these angels and they told
[1:08:31] us the Christ child y'all you and I'm
[1:08:34] saying God unfolded it as they went
[1:08:38] along and that's how most trials are God
[1:08:42] never give you the in until the in comes
[1:08:45] help me Lord let me go back to the great
[1:08:48] secret or mother to go listen brother em
[1:08:51] center like this in crisis the mystery
[1:08:53] God great secret has always blinded the
[1:08:58] wisdom of the world they can't get it
[1:09:02] they just don't understand it Satan
[1:09:06] don't understand it that means you don't
[1:09:10] understand you you don't understand how
[1:09:13] God can give you a zillion
[1:09:15] times of repentance he'd ordered under
[1:09:20] how God can so favor you and you make
[1:09:22] mistakes all the time and then he puts
[1:09:24] himself in you anyway he see your
[1:09:28] attitudes he see and then your makeup
[1:09:30] and how can God who was so holy places
[1:09:33] himself into you and call you his bride
[1:09:38] how he don't understand it you the only
[1:09:44] one that gives him a tips by your mouth
[1:09:51] you tell Satan exactly where you are
[1:09:56] they just don't understand it Satan
[1:09:58] don't understand it none of the rest of
[1:10:00] them understand it but just those who
[1:10:02] are predestinated to understanding how
[1:10:05] God in Christ are one they'll make him
[1:10:09] three every time see they certainly will
[1:10:12] notice next secondly the men of the
[1:10:15] state manifested Christ in you the hope
[1:10:18] of glory the great benefits of God in
[1:10:21] Christ now Christ manifested in you you
[1:10:24] know what you said when I'm saying the
[1:10:26] focus is not on a Christmas tree the
[1:10:28] focus is not on a manger the focus is
[1:10:31] not a baby in a manger
[1:10:33] the focus is Christ in you and you and I
[1:10:37] are so folks of focus on this being
[1:10:41] that's growing up in us like a woman
[1:10:44] would treasure her baby

[1:10:49] that being that's growing up in you
[1:10:51] that's one with you that's Christ that's
[1:10:54] Christ in you and you must feed him
[1:10:57] every day brother Balaam said the Holy
[1:11:03] Ghost feeds off the word and if you
[1:11:06] don't feed him the word every day you're
[1:11:09] going to get weak and when you get weak
[1:11:12] your language is going to change the way
[1:11:17] you see things are going to change your
[1:11:19] vision will become blurred mmm oh come
[1:11:23] on not one negative thoughts should come
[1:11:26] to your mind and if it comes to your
[1:11:28] mind

[1:11:31] let it roots there you're supposed to
[1:11:33] kick out those stocks because just as
[1:11:36] soon as you don't keep those thoughts

[1:12:23] it if you don't meditate on it

[1:12:32] Jesus look what was God wants God great
[1:12:40] secret let me tell you something you
[1:12:43] don't have to let's put it this way it's
[1:12:47] a known fact that most things that are
[1:12:49] healthy to eat is nasty
[1:12:54] it is not appealing to the taste
[1:12:57] hello but the Word of God should be
[1:13:01] appealing it should bring us joy but it
[1:13:05] ain't gonna always be sweet it's gonna
[1:13:08] be some bitterness day Wow because the

[1:13:48] him harder because I realized there's a
[1:13:54] stubbornness there I'm trying to get you
[1:13:57] to break because when you break it's
[1:14:00] gonna be better for you

[1:14:35] what I'm saying but you see we've been
[1:14:37] taught you do not whip a child in anger

[1:14:44] bringing forth a generation that will
[1:14:47] not be used to correction hello is that
[1:14:56] okay
[1:14:57] I'm going on with it but God great
[1:15:00] mystery what the eternal God had as a
[1:15:05] mystery has now unfolded in Jesus Christ
[1:15:09] then given right down to the church what
[1:15:13] was once in God's mine is now in the
[1:15:17] body of Christ Jesus make that's what he
[1:15:21] said this whole message that I'm giving
[1:15:24] you is Jesus making love to the church
[1:15:28] his bride whispering secrets to her how
[1:15:34] you go how you gonna make love with God
[1:15:36] and not read his word or listen to it
[1:15:38] huh this ain't this ain't no yeah we
[1:15:42] don't even understand what he's doing
[1:15:44] he's bringing a real creation a new
[1:15:46] creation
[1:15:47] he's literally pouring his divine nature
[1:15:49] in you by victory victory victory

[1:15:55] if you
[1:15:56] trust in him he will bring you to every
[1:15:59] victory hello he told those children of
[1:16:02] Israel when they were marching around
[1:16:04] Jericho don't open up your mouth
[1:16:09] why no doubt he knew that the journey
[1:16:14] wasn't easy the flesh don't like to be
[1:16:17] corrected and if Satan can just get you
[1:16:22] to say oh I'm walking in my feet hurt
[1:16:26] you see it wouldn't be that you don't
[1:16:29] have a cause because your feet hurt but
[1:16:31] he says don't even say that oh I'm so
[1:16:35] thirsty don't even say that I instructed
[1:16:39] you to walk around and not say nothing
[1:16:42] because just out of your mouth you can
[1:16:47] give the scheme away oh I'm gonna read a
[1:16:52] quote and I'm gonna let you go I read

[1:17:25] he's got one of the memories right make
[1:17:28] you want to do a little judge judge by
[1:17:30] blood transfusion but nevertheless he's
[1:17:33] gifted and it's okay brother it's really
[1:17:36] nice to be that way I thank God I didn't
[1:17:38] have it like that cuz maybe I wouldn't
[1:17:41] be here you say god knows what to do
[1:17:43] with some of us some of us can handle
[1:17:45] that and some of us cannot right I get
[1:17:48] excited when I can say big words
[1:17:50] sometimes I did I didn't even know I
[1:17:52] knew that but anyhow God knows how to
[1:17:56] work with us right but we must be
[1:17:59] consistent supposedly I'm a B student or
[1:18:03] a C student and I want to make an a well
[1:18:07] I must be consistent in my studies
[1:18:10] because I know my level of comprehension
[1:18:13] I can't miss a day of school right and I
[1:18:18] can't miss time of study I must be
[1:18:20] consistent in my study because I have a
[1:18:22] goal I want to make an aim y'all hear me
[1:18:27] that's the way it is with God you got to
[1:18:30] be consistent I have a goal in this
[1:18:34] manifestation of karzai I don't want to
[1:18:37] come up to godliness and stop there not
[1:18:41] even brotherly kindness you know my goal
[1:18:44] is love total divine love operating
[1:18:48] faith and all the other virtues
[1:18:50] everything I do I want it to be
[1:18:53] motivated by God's divine love so I have
[1:18:57] a mission
[1:18:59] I've been ordained for it I've been
[1:19:01] built for it
[1:19:02] so have you you built for it but you not
[1:19:07] must understand there's an old man
[1:19:08] that's gonna always tried to stop you
[1:19:12] it's almost like in the days Amen when
[1:19:15] when Nehemiah and all of them was trying
[1:19:18] to build a wall Hezekiah and y'all y'all
[1:19:20] know what I'm saying they were all up on
[1:19:22] the wall trying to build everything in
[1:19:24] Sanballat was the distraction they will
[1:19:29] have breeds they were people they men
[1:19:31] and when I say that I mean they were
[1:19:33] people and then was half - and half not
[1:19:36] God came camera half he want the home he
[1:19:42] don't want us to be influenced by the
[1:19:44] knowledge of good and evil hallelujah he
[1:19:49] wants us to have the knowledge of him in
[1:19:51] him only the tree of life must live in
[1:19:55] you is that Alright
[1:19:58] he must live that's why he said you must
[1:20:00] God daily all of us got to die in order
[1:20:05] for Christ to live but you must
[1:20:08] persevere you must be consistent
[1:20:11] consisting in your prayer consisting in
[1:20:13] your fasting consisting in your study in
[1:20:16] other words God must become your all in
[1:20:18] all
[1:20:22] Jesus the most brilliant men ever
[1:20:26] surpass Einstein he was infused man fact
[1:20:30] there's a God forgot his name smarter
[1:20:32] than Einstein I can't think of his name
[1:20:34] in a rich he got it smarter than
[1:20:37] Einstein yes but where's Stephen Stephen
[1:20:47] there no Jesus he may have been able to
[1:20:52] look into the future and ohohohohoh
[1:20:54] America you in trouble but what good is
[1:20:57] data which could have done that not down
[1:21:01] in the main but my point is if he didn't
[1:21:03] know Jesus he's not in heaven hallelujah
[1:21:09] but he didn't get there that's smart
[1:21:12] by not reading or studying or
[1:21:16] sacrificing his time huh he had a goal
[1:21:22] and he set that goal in place and he
[1:21:26] worked toward it you don't get your
[1:21:29] master's degrees that your doctors agree
[1:21:31] but not attending school or going
[1:21:33] nowhere to learn more you said I'll go

[1:22:29] my mission and how do I get there by
[1:22:33] carrying my cross by suffering for the

[1:22:44] NOT on a picnic I am NOT amen on it
[1:22:47] don't go to a pair of ease no sir

[1:23:35] I ain't like Paul I have not yet
[1:23:38] apprehended but I press it's difficult
[1:23:43] it's hard but I got my mind set on Jesus
[1:23:48] and I might stumble I might fall but I
[1:23:52] gotta make it if I got an elbow my way
[1:23:55] through every critic through every sound
[1:23:58] barrier you know what brother Adam said
[1:24:00] about the sound barrier
[1:24:01] he said the sound barrier is that space
[1:24:04] between unbelief and faith when you got
[1:24:09] the devil telling you all kind of stuff
[1:24:11] and you and you all I got faith but that
[1:24:15] ain't where you spirit out is that's not
[1:24:17] where you are if you listening to the
[1:24:19] sounds of the devil the words of the
[1:24:22] devil and everything you you you you're
[1:24:24] not dared faith yet huh unbelievers hear
[1:24:29] the sound barriers here and faith is
[1:24:32] here he said faith has no sound barrier
[1:24:38] you don't when you got faith you
[1:24:41] listen nothing the devil saying you
[1:24:44] don't even hear him you ignore him
[1:24:47] hallelujah he's in the back of you not
[1:24:51] the front of you nor even on the side of
[1:24:53] you you ignored that you don't hear him
[1:24:56] you just got your eyes focused right you
[1:24:59] see that's what it was Peter says Lord
[1:25:01] bid me come he asked in faith he walked
[1:25:06] in faith but all of a sudden his faith
[1:25:08] dropped now he's in the sound barrier oh
[1:25:11] you're gonna drown look at the winds all
[1:25:15] the waves did you notice the clouds and
[1:25:19] he took his eyes off of Jesus and he
[1:25:22] began to sink but don't worry
[1:25:24] God has his hand reached out I didn't
[1:25:30] even realize it one day until I heard a
[1:25:32] man preach about it I think it was
[1:25:34] brother cadre digs he said Peter quit
[1:25:38] right at the arm reach of Jesus he began
[1:25:44] to sink Jesus didn't have to say run up
[1:25:47] to and say oh he's still a frog justice
[1:25:49] let me go get him all jesus did was and
[1:25:55] that's what the devil did does he wants
[1:25:59] you to quit right at the moment when
[1:26:01] he's getting ready to pull you up but
[1:26:05] let me say it like this all you got to
[1:26:07] do is says oh lord have mercy on me
[1:26:15] we're on a mission and our mission is to
[1:26:19] reflect Jesus Christ not ourselves they
[1:26:24] ain't no good thing about your flesh
[1:26:25] it's already condemned don't even think
[1:26:29] your flesh is gonna be good
[1:26:30] your flesh is evil and if it gets rule
[1:26:34] is gonna want you to do whatever oh I'll
[1:26:37] never do that don't you ever say that
[1:26:40] because you are capable of doing
[1:26:42] everything anything of the flesh the
[1:26:46] only people that keeps you from doing a
[1:26:48] lot of things is God himself no
[1:26:53] Constitution don't mean a thing

[1:27:21] but it's oh it only goes here sometimes
[1:27:28] to my spirit but never to my soul my
[1:27:33] soul is sealed by God and I'm gonna tell
[1:27:37] you something that's the place Satan
[1:27:39] can't reach me and I don't care how many
[1:27:41] times I fall in my spirit and fall in my
[1:27:44] flesh my soul keeps saying go ahead boy
[1:27:49] go ahead you can make it you got it you
[1:27:53] gonna make it ain't no quitting in my
[1:27:55] soul I can't quit I've come too far
[1:27:58] let's tan oh think about it God
[1:28:05] told Joshua say you gonna go over there
[1:28:07] neck in that uh in that everything that
[1:28:11] you place on your feet is yours but you
[1:28:14] gonna have to fight for it I don't need
[1:28:16] you know Joshua thought oh I'm gonna be
[1:28:17] okay you know praise God I know I love
[1:28:20] the Lord and huh and then what happens
[1:28:22] Here Come a can messin up it je what
[1:28:27] thousands of souls done what in the
[1:28:29] world's going Lord right that's the way
[1:28:33] it doesn't necessarily mean you did
[1:28:35] something wrong maybe somebody else did
[1:28:37] something wrong or maybe no one else did
[1:28:39] nothing wrong and God is just trying you
[1:28:42] at the end of the day you must
[1:28:44] understand God is in control he's in
[1:28:50] control he's got it all under control
[1:28:52] but he wants to see how much do you
[1:28:55] really love me are you willing to go all
[1:28:59] the way with me like you said in the
[1:29:00] beginning huh the children literally
[1:29:04] thought that and then they began to
[1:29:05] murmur and complain about everything God
[1:29:07] said and how did that hold you
[1:29:08] and only two of them came up right be
[1:29:11] that to be one of those two hmm take God
[1:29:15] at His Word love him because people that
[1:29:18] ain't gonna get no better it's not going
[1:29:21] to get better
[1:29:23] maybe this try are you going through my
[1:29:26] dough
[1:29:26] you may come through it but don't you
[1:29:28] understand when that one is over another
[1:29:30] one's coming anybody know what I'm
[1:29:32] talking about you over you overcome one
[1:29:34] here come another and sometimes you got
[1:29:36] three or four I'm coming into one time
[1:29:37] you feel like I'm in jail or I'm in jump
[1:29:48] you don't know what to do with the only
[1:29:50] thing I could tell you when everything
[1:29:51] stopped flowing at you keep your
[1:29:54] integrity
[1:29:55] just keep your integrity maybe that's
[1:29:58] all you got left everything has been
[1:30:01] stripped from you but understand God is
[1:30:04] waiting for that moment to reward you
[1:30:07] why because you saw him as being God and
[1:30:12] he that come to God must first believe
[1:30:14] that he is God and that he is rewarded
[1:30:16] those that diligently seek Him he always
[1:30:19] have a reward for you after the battle
[1:30:22] and when that reward is given to you
[1:30:25] guess what you forget how difficult it
[1:30:27] was hmm it's true every man that receive
[1:30:32] a gold medal he forgets how hard it was
[1:30:36] to get it after he's gotten it he might
[1:30:40] say oh yes it had to work hard but you
[1:30:43] don't remember the pain it's like a
[1:30:45] woman having a baby after she had the
[1:30:46] baby she don't really remember the pain
[1:30:48] in detail she just knew she had pain
[1:30:52] that's how it's gonna be when we get
[1:30:55] over Jana these little things that we've
[1:30:57] gone through you know Paul call and
[1:30:59] light afflictions that's what he said
[1:31:02] but in our lives we don't see it like
[1:31:04] that but Paul said that's like and when
[1:31:09] we get over there praise God it's gonna
[1:31:12] be worth it all telling you don't miss
[1:31:15] the saints of God we're so close to this
[1:31:17] thing don't miss it
[1:31:19] let go and let God have his way
[1:31:22] die to yourself die to yourself come to
[1:31:26] find out what God is doing in your life
[1:31:28] and why he might let you know he might
[1:31:31] be he may tell you ok I'm grooming you
[1:31:34] this I'm grooming if you he made he may
[1:31:35] not but trust him let's get back to that
[1:31:38] Scripture trust the Lord with all your
[1:31:41] heart and lean not to your own
[1:31:44] understanding acknowledge the Lord in
