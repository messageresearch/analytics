thanksgiving i'll [Music] [Music] blessing you with our hands lord prepare me lord to be pure and holy yes lord you're yes with thanksgiving he [Music] let us open our bibles to the book of esther in chapter four as to chapter four and verse thirteen then mordecai commanded to and to answer esther think not with thyself that thou shalt escape in the king's house more than all the jews imagined for if thou all together hold us thy peace at this time then shall their enlargement and deliverance arise to the jews from another place for such a time as this and who knoweth where the thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as this let us take our seeds amen so for a short time this morning i want to speak on this title for this cause were you born of treating me amen in the scripture where we are reading we see a conversation between mordecai and esther they were standing between a rock and a hard place all the children of israel were endangered and it was all in esther's hand she had to make a decision and this decision she had to make was either going to determine if they were going to be destroyed or they were going to leave and modify when we're reading here says for you came to a kingdom for such a time as this uh if we open our bibles to john chapter 18 verse 37 the bible said pilate therefore said unto him i doubt a kingdom jesus answered thou says that i am a king jesus to this end was i born and for this cause came i into the world that i should bear witness and to the truth everyone that is of the truth here with my voice here jesus was telling pilate i have come to accomplish my mission for this cause came i into the world that i should bear witness unto the truth amen and we know that we are christians we have jesus in our heart amen we were born to reflect jesus in our lives amen for this cause were you born you were born on this earth so you could show the world that jesus lives in you jesus said greater works than this shall you do so everything that jesus did he wants to do it within you and me this morning because for this cause that you that's why you and i were born amen we realized this is the best time to live in all the generations and all the ages passed all the saints and all the sages of old wanted to live in this day amen and god is working his bride unreservedly all those saints when they had a preview of today they wanted to live in this day but god did not allow them he said we are the ones who were supposed to live in this last days [Music] he said lord i want to go and live in there god says go that way daniel jesus i have someone else who is prepared for this time and this person is you and me amen we are living in that time where they all wanted to leave [Music] but that wasn't meant for them that was meant for you and we understand we are living in the darkest times they ever was where satan has poured all the hell onto the earth you remember when brother branham went to hell when he was a boy and he saw all those the women who were made up in all that kind of stuff after a few years he started seeing it in person all the spirits of hell has been poured onto the earth once we are walking on the streets we are walking we are seeing health unfair but every time satan brings in a flood god raises a standard amen god always has a witnesses for each and every time so whilst there is hell on earth also tells us that we are living in heavenly places in christ jesus christ so we are not worried about our surroundings [Music] we know that although the world is living in hell at the same time we are living in heavenly places amen how many are grateful for that thank god for the holy ghost we thank god for the word that can lift us up against all these things of the world amen and we know the greater the trial the greater the struggle amen so now it is more visible than it's ever been before because it was fully revealed and the more the more the darker the world is so we know the greater the trial and the struggle is the sweeter and we are privileged this morning to know that you and me we are those witnesses in those in the book of hebrews paul tells us that they without us they are not made perfectly so we are the perfection of all the generations when we cross over yonder they're going to be want to be asking us how did you make it because in his grace that we need to see we noticed as we realized in uh when we were reading in the book of esther she had to make a conscious decision from the decision to go and walk into the king dalai and this was this was against the law to walk into the king without being summoned but she realized that for this cause was i born so she decided to go into the king decided to leave the wall because she saw that's where the deliverance of the children of israel and before she went she got to a time where she had to fast for three days and three nights all the jews don't eat or drink anything because this is a serious matter a man for her to complete the purpose that god had brought her forth a completely disappointed you have to be consecrated to god you gotta know you gotta have a solid relationship with god so leader amen you gotta focus on your prayer life how are you going to know what god is telling you if you don't know how he speaks to you prayer is communication with god you just don't know there and pray and stand up and go you gotta make sure your relationship with the world is strong gotta read your bible you gotta pray listen to those states and studying amen so god can steer you into your purpose so you understand what cause you were born into the world foreign nothing will happen to you until you fulfill the properties that god brought you on this earth and it came to pass when the philistine arose and ran toward the army to meet the philistines david did not walk towards goliath david why because he knew his purpose he knew the cause that he was born for he couldn't see you see david a few prior to that david was anointed to be king david and this was this was god's decision for david to be king he said that so there is no death that was going to touch him until he was king whatever fight he was going to get into he was going to win it shall he was not going to die because his purpose was protecting him the anointing that was on his life was protecting him he could not die until he was king so that's why the bible says david ran towards goliath where all all the mighty soldiers of israel they were afraid of we saw this david was not scared of that he ran towards the enemy because he knew that so long i'm not yet king nothing is going to touch me nothing will there is nothing that can touch you until you perform the purpose that god has on your life that can kill you if you have not performed but god's purpose in your life there's no trial there is no affliction i can take you out because god has a purpose on your life the prophet of god said you will not leave five minutes longer on earth if you are done with god's purpose could you continue god is still working on you amen and we know our destiny is predestinated in the word of god so nothing will happen to us that i miss all we just have to do is stand upon the promises of god and he will deliver us amen all we just gotta do is wait on the promise of god stand flat-footed on this word nothing can shake you nothing can move you amen and while you are standing there you will able to see what's my purpose we all read in the bible of this man called gideon in his own eyes he never saw himself as a warrior in his own eyes he thought the cause that he was born for was to be a farmer but god saw further than that when god was looking at him he was seeing his purpose when the angel approached gideon he did not say you farmer he says thou mighty man of valor but god was seeing him through the purpose that he had for his life and he was saying i'm a coward i'm the least of them all but when the angel came to address he did not see all of that he says thou mighty man of violence so don't look at yourself within your own eyes or what this world tells you that you are look at what god is saying about your life when god looks at you he does not see a coward when god looks at you he sees a mighty man of valor may lost in his word we are more than conquerors ladies and gentlemen and all those battles that you have you will win them because god's word never fails amen so we gotta look at ourselves with the eye of god what god sees us so he thought he was just living on a day-to-day basis living life but god had a spiritual purpose for him his purpose was to possess all the gates of the enemy objective we know he was he was he was being terrorized by the by the philistines after he goes and he farms he is he's a produce and then after he after he harvests it then the philistines will just come and take it away from him but then one day he was just sitting right there the prophet says i know that my god still leaves jose and there's a crisis at hand he increases and then the spirit of the lord came upon him the moment he realized who he was to give him courage that was enough to make him know his purpose that i was born to possess all the gates of the enemy so him just remembering that i'm a son of abraham that realization and the spirit of the lord came upon him you just have to come to that realization of who you are you gotta come to the realization of the purpose that god has on your life but he wants us to be a living tabernacle and he jumped out there and he slew 600 philistines he actually sees some philistines why because he knew that he was an israelite he did not have any military training inaudible but he knew that god's purpose was the objective was going to protect him he knew that god's cause on his life was going to keep him look out there he says the word of god says i shall possess all the gates of my enemies so so long i have abraham's blood flowing in my veins i'm going to get that victory i don't care how the bible tells us that so so long you understand that i'm a son of abraham my purpose is to possess all the gates of the enemy one objective so whatever trial that's coming your way on a politically profitable it's a promise that god gave to abraham and all his seeds so when you stand on that promise god has a reputation of never failing none of his promises when you amen he had a right to his god-given rights he was circumcised the prophet of god says and any man here that's been circumcised by the spirit of god amen he says you are a christian [Music] any of you people that's sick the devil is a bluff he'll rob you he'll do everything he can you don't have to know how to fight but you just have faith and step out anyhow god will give you that victory because you are understanding the purpose he has on your life you just know abraham's promise also applies to you and where abraham that will kill satan every time not sometimes but every time and that's the hardest hitting satan can get when a man will take god at his words no demon can overcome you because you're walking in what god has predestinated for you to do basketball and we know today our purpose is the message of the hour in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god. and everything that was in god he poured it into christ and everything that was in christ he put it into the church he brought it into you and me so that's our purpose the message of the hour christ himself living in us chris remember and we realize every age god sends a message and the message has a jewel effect mercy to those who are accepted in judgment to those who refuse it we saw he did the same thing in the days of noah that told him to build the ark is the same message that brought the flood that destroyed the people who refused judgment remember the message accepted the message of moses and that same message is the one that destroyed pharaoh and his armies it's the message that's going to transform us to get into the rapture but the same message is the one that's going to judge this whole world amen amen so we got to understand and walk into our purpose we are predestinated before the foundation of the world to be sons and daughters of god if you get to understand that you will never live under privileged the rest of your life knowing who you are you don't walk downtrodden but you god had a purpose for them to come out of egypt and go worship him do you have an objective did egypt and nothing was going to stop the children of israel from coming out of egypt for them to go worship god oh here and god had given a promise to abraham that after 400 years your children are going to come out of slavery so when the time was up for them to come out and serve god's purpose objective there was nothing that was going to stop them from coming out there was a promise that they were going to be delivered amen amen and god was coming out to deliver them from the hands of pharaoh when god is coming out to deliver you nothing can stop him because in the word he says father all that you have given to me i've lost none of them and you have been given into the hands of christ he will never lose you christ amen he is the shepherd who will leave the 99 to go pick up that one who is lost amen so we understand pharaoh tried to stop the children of israel from getting out of bondage unfortunately and they were not going to serve god's purpose whilst they were in egypt he had to take them out but we see pharaoh tried to stop them i you see when you try when something tries to stop you from what god is taking out to you said you know that's a victory that's already won because nothing can stop god amen the red sea could not stand in the way of of of of the children of israel when the red sea opened and the children of israel passed israel [Music] you see no doubt can stop god from delivering you the prophet of god says the prophet the prophet the prophet of god he says i forgot the message he says doubt does not hinder god unbelief does not hinder god amen so it doesn't matter what your unbelief is saying or what someone else is doubting so long there's a purpose of god you have to fulfill us you know you are coming out of there if you did it for the children of israel israel god can do the same thing for you too amen so you know nothing can stand before you no fear no depression no sickness can stand before you when you are coming out when god is delivering you to come out and serve his purpose amen so your soul is valuable because you said they had a host of angels that were surrounding them that was more than the the armies of the of the assyrians and this whole host of angels was just there to protect two people he said so it doesn't matter wherever you are wherever you're walking so long you're in the will of god you know that god's fence is around you he's got you protected in one quote the prophet of god said god is anxious to deliver his people on purpose you see anxious means extremely uneasy see you're getting you're getting restless or impatient for something so god is anxious to come and deliver you so when you are in a fortress you are surrounded nothing can break in life god has you protected when you are serving his purpose so when esther walked in to go see the king because she had prayed and she had a purpose that purpose made her to find favor in the side of the king protection affirmative that purpose made her enemy be destroyed instead of her set objective that purpose saved all the children of israel set objective associated because she was walking into what she had been born for pascal she was walking into what she had been called for amen you will not perish until the cause that you were born for is fulfilled as i was saying earlier on the sages and the saints of old community they wanted to live in this day i believe daniel saw the third pull in action i believe he saw the raising of the dead i believe he saw the creation of squirrels i believe he saw the opening of the seven seals amen he saw love amongst the bride of christ and although his testimony was being an alliance then it could not be compared to what he wanted to see if he passed so you you got to realize in what day you have been born in what i going to say to daniel when he asked you when he is going to when he will ask you and say what did you do in lao this year dc and you say nothing and he's like that's where i wanted to leave i would have done something better so we're going to realize in the day that we're living in and the word that god brought into our hands because we are meant to be more than other cameras for his purpose to be accomplished whilst the world is looking at at circumstances around them we just look up above the word of god we are born for such a time like this when moses seen him he had a skin on him look like a man when god was behind the curtains he had a skin on him and god tonight god this morning in his church he has veiled in his church with the skin on him he is still the same god so you and me this morning we are the skin of god we are the ones that are veiling god within us so we gotta walk knowing that we are working with god within ourselves what he did with the apostles peter in them he can still do the same thing with you and me because you see when jesus was living on the earth all the all the miracles he was performing he was doing it by himself but the reason why he died was so that he could come back and do it in all the so when jesus was on earth hell was only was only concerned and looking at one person i believe the demons had to look and say today where is jesus christ [Music] when they came out from the each and everyone was doing the work that jesus was doing and there was more damage to the kingdom of this of satan so imagine today you and me we surrender ourselves and allow the holy ghost jesus himself to come and live within us each because it is jesus himself who is doing the work within you and me jesus so we just gotta understand that the purpose that's what god wants for us to use you to be a skin on him suppose he wants to use your hands he wants to use your feet if it is evil if it is a woman he wants to use your mouth so if you can just surrender and say i'm willing to be a vessel that's surrendered to you you're able to walk into the purpose of your ability to walk into what god had planned for you before the foundation of the world sorry foreign amen it's in this last days with the full revelation of the word and we know we are an invincible army nothing can stand before us amen let us just sing in moments like this we sing out a song in moments like this i sing out a song i sing out a love song to jesus in moments like this [Music] one more time in moments like this [Music] i sing [Music] like this [Music] i lift up my ass singing i'm i love you i
