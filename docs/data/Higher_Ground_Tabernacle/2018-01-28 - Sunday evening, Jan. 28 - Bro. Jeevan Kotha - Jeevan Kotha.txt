Luke's Gospel chapter 15 verse 8 please either what woman having ten pieces of silver if she lose one piece that not light a candle and sweep the house and seek diligently till she find it and when she have found it she called her friends and her neighbors together saying rejoice with me for I have found the peace which I had lost likewise I say unto you there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner that repenteth also if you don't mind John chapter 14 from was one too for peace John chapter 14 he not your heart be troubled he believed in God believe also in me in my father's house are many mansions if it were not so I would have told you I go to prepare a place for you and if I go and prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you unto myself that where I am there ye may be also for whether I go you know and the way you know praise the name of the Lord thank you very much please be seated this evening time I would like to share with you the lost coin the prophet of God preached wonderful messages about the lost coin awarded woman but is the name of the Lord so here if you read in the prophets coat second coming of the Lord he preached in 1957 here he says it's later than we think we don't come to church to occupy pew we do not come to church to hear a good sermon or come to church to hear good music they all got their place but what we better come to church to do is to check up with God I'm a shall weigh our souls in in salvation for the day of redemption is near geez Jesus Christ God's Son likened this he said to a woman in our subject tonight we find this woman her husband had gone and she had lost one of the coins out of her tablet praise the name of the Lord so the Prophet said you know this woman is the church praise the name of the Lord and we are the church we are his people hallelujah thank you Jesus and our husband like Isaiah chapter 55 if 54 verse 5 says here temple 54 verse 5 says for thy maker is dying husband the Lord of Hosts is his name thy Redeemer the Holy One of Israel the God of whole earth shall I be called praise the name of the Lord so you understand now we are that woman and one day she got up early in the morning her husband has gone out on business and when she got up according to the law of Moses the married woman she should have tent 10 coins on her tablet you know even that also the prophet said here is very wonderfully explained it I thank God for him the same message 2nd coming of the Lord today if if a woman is married she should wear a wedding ring as a sign that she's married that to keep other men from having anything to do with her they look and the sees is a married woman in those days they didn't have varying rings they had a tablet they called it tablet they put it on their head it had ten coins and it remained around their head and that was a sign with a sign they were married woman and no man was too full with them no boys was too far flirt with them they were married praise the name of the Lord so I could tell you what each one of these coins means it is placed in there and each coin meant a certain virtue of that woman and first meaning her love to her husband second her plays a virtue to leave clean for him and the third and fourth and fifth so here we see that this woman is the church according the law of Moses if her neighbor come to know that she lost one of her coin from ten tablets and she's in trouble you know and they will go and inform the village leader or a priest or a temple priest and tell it I tell him that you know this woman she lost her coin and something is wrong and and the village priest will come you know village priest or a leader or whatever and a temple priest he will come with the witnesses and see that see that the woman she lost one coin there is no tin tin tablets you know and then they take her out of the town you know and understand stone him stronger you know kill her according to the law of Moses because when she lose her when he wins she lose her one one coin you know out of that tablet you know she becomes a harlot you know and if her husband come you know and find out this is without coin is you know she lost one coin you know and he got a right to divorce her according to the law of Moses you know so same thing you know this woman when she got up early in the morning maybe bit was dark you know and and her husband has gone out you know under she got up early in the morning and she saw one of her coin you know she missed lost you know and what she did you know in in verse 9 says you know and it was 8 either what woman having ten piece of silver if she lose one piece that not light a candle hmm or his candle means huh the SAMS 119 verse 105 says that candle is thy word is a lamp unto my feet and the light unto my path you know praise the name of the Lord the lamb you know it's a candle it's a you know she lit a candle you know and princes brothers and sisters that woman is no one but we you and me we are the we have that woman and today we need to lit a candle every day morning and evening afternoon every time candle is the word of God praise the name of the Lord hallelujah we need to read the Word of God we need to be filled with the holy spirit we need to we need to stay in the presence of God hallelujah we need to worship Him we need to exalt him we need to glorify His name that's the reason you our Creator prison name of the Lord Alleluia so she lit a candle you know and the Lord of God says in in a samson 1820 it say in in the scripture it says in a in the proverbs chapter 20 verse 27 says the spirit of man is the candle of the Lord searching all inward parts of the belly raise the name of the Lord also there is a little scripture in Matthew chapter 5 verse 15 neither do men light a candle and put it under a bushel but on a candlestick and it giveth light unto all that are in the house praise the name of the Lord now you know what is light means it gives the light to everybody in the house praise the name of the Lord so she got up you know and she was afraid she was fearing if her husband come if she if he find out that one coin is lot she you know he will divorce me huh and you know we don't want our husband to divorce us huh we don't believe in divorce huh Oh precious brothers and sisters you know today you know our Creator is our

blood and blood of Jesus Christ on the cross of Calvary thank God for His grace thank God for His mercy now the prophet of God said this is the time huh Oh hallelujah praise the name of the Lord this is the time in the same message called and it was critically getting night remember her husband would return and if he found her with one of those coins out it showed that she had been marked harlot and if she had defied or defiled herself in any way it was seen by the people they brought her before the priests and brought witnesses that she would been found such and the priest seen that she was a married woman took the coin out of a tablet huh and that she had been doing wrong she had made her virtue they took that out if she had been flirting showing that she wasn't true to her husband they took that one out and whatever it was they took it out and when her husband returned he found that she had been marked and he would divorce her immediately and have nothing to do with such a woman he did not want such a woman so it was getting along towards dark when she realized that she had lost something time for her husband to come and it's getting late our husband is coming strength rather don't think oh it's almost 2000 70 years 17 years go you know learn late you know I don't think he's coming you know denomination they don't believe in the rapture they say where is the word rapture

other pastor told me I said brother I I want to say goodbye to that pastor even though I am Christian mission from India you know how is it he believes the message and he's against the course or the Prophet know these codes are the Word of God these courts are from the Bible praise the name of the Lord hallelujah the prophet of God was so humble he always could exalting the name of Jesus Christ praise the name of the Lord so anyhow he was trying to introduce me there to that first I said no brother I don't want to go there because I am a man I like to quote the courts of the Prophet because it's not but the William branham's course it's the courts from the Word of God praise the name of the Lord hallelujah so anyhow I thank God for His grace and mercy the church better be examined

again we love you we thank you in Jesus precious name we pray while I pray well earlier why while the men of God comes here I want to say thank you for your patience and I want to thank the pastor and his wife for taking special care of me since I came and you know there you are a blessed people to have that kind of men of God in your midst I'm not praising him or not I'm not I please her I don't like that but I'm telling the truth praise the name of the Lord it's a genuine man of God with great love of God great love for others praise the name of the Lord hallelujah god bless your love y'all Jesus Jesus is good he's great amen and then we thank the Lord we did come in on it's prayer we didn't come straight through the curtains but we thought because my anyway we thank the Lord for the service Amen I just wanted him to know that we were here and heard every word by God's grace appreciate our brother for being moved by God to come here because some of the things my wife bear witnessed that he was saying the evening I God said the same thing we're just so thankful just to have a witness because now is the time like I was saying now it's the time to make sure you got the Holy Ghost now it's the time to make sure that you have swept the house and all the coins are in its proper place you keep seeking God until God has established those virtues in you that it is not just seen by you but seen by others so we thank God it was so refreshing that scripture that the brother read because often time we forget one corn just one corn missing in the eyes of God you are considered an adulteress hello that's the words of the Prophet that's the word of the word and you want to make sure that all those virtues you understand what I mean people Berlin preached about the true identification of a true church and he showed us all that the true church possessed and I believe that all of us possess something that God wants to use and the only way that he can use it just like I told him down there in Iowa City every vessel was anointed if you was a housewife he was an anointed housewife hello if he was a brick mason or whatever you were a teacher whatever you are you are supposed to be anointed this anointing is not for the preacher only every vessel was anointed and every vessel Amen was anointed by the same oil it wasn't a separate oil for the preacher versus the congregation every vessel in the in beyond the curtain and every everywhere was anointed by the olive oil about all in which they use and I want to say this by the grace of God you know I was telling my wife coming here I said Israel missed it they got the anointing of justification that anointing of justification took it into sanctification there was anointed there remember now David was anointed three times when he was anointed the first time he was King we needed known to the second time he was king we knew was an unguent nor to the third time he was king and that was a process that he had to go through but he was always King was God had decided in his mind who he was he was king you understand me I'm saying you're Queen like the brother said we're the real queen of heaven amen let him anoint you annoying to acknowledge you never get dissatisfied with one an auntie let'em continuously anoint you as brother Branham said let god we need a refilling of the Holy Ghost every day not sometime all the time every day that's what we're preaching because it is that anointing that will attract that anointing yeah if you part of the magnet that means you got you got the Holy Ghost here and the Holy Ghost is down there and there you are and you're not want to be pulled about that magnet because it's coming it's coming it's moving already amen yes and folks who God you know don't don't look at all everybody else you know the prophet of God said it was the Prophet is our and in the Prophet that was there or living a man let me call him doesn't become because he talks about those who escaped that Jewish age and I got him in my mind you know what about the two words that was in the temple when Jesus came you know I'm thinking of Simeon yeah was one and in the sister and he says oh it's always male and female male and female myth husband and wife other than wife bride and Christ bride in Christ so I'm saying all Israel was dead all of Israel was religious but there were two a blind man and they were in the temple praying Lord don't let me die until I see yo massage and that blind man had more sight than the Pharisees and the Sadducees of that day y'all hear what I'm saying I must understand if everybody else is dead and not moving in the spirit you let them be that you just say Lord keep that anointing with me and so let me walk in the spirit keep me in that anointing because that is where all the chords are stolen that's what the virtue is it's not in you as in you know you love the Lord didn't mean to preach but he stirred me up it's his fault we thank God for His goodness glad to be here in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ God has a way of working things out there's a couple of situations that I that I had to do
