[26:11] brought joy and happiness
[26:14] hallelujah you know sometimes we take it
[26:19] for granted but it's a blessing to be
[26:21] able to come to church as often as we do
[26:25] it is such a blessing and I'm so
[26:29] grateful actually I thought it was owner
[26:31] already brother I'm sorry gotta cut it
[26:33] off but he's such a blessing and you
[26:36] know I I just would never want to lose
[26:42] this but we know that it's coming the
[26:45] government one day is going to shut
[26:47] these kind of churches down I don't know
[26:50] whether I'll still be living but I
[26:52] always will be living what I mean on
[26:55] this side or the dimension I don't know
[26:59] but I wonder what it's going to be like
[27:01] to those who had opportunity to come and
[27:04] did not come what it will be like when
[27:08] you really miss having church and
[27:13] fellowship with the saints of God
[27:16] you love the Lord let us turn to 2nd
[27:20] Samuel please will continue to thought
[27:28] God creating himself in you you are the
[27:34] earth you know and God is creating
[27:37] himself in Earth I'll never forget that
[27:41] that scripture will always ring in my
[27:44] heart that will be done in earth as it
[27:47] is in heaven it's so amazing how Satan
[27:52] will cause you to forget sometime the
[27:55] various scriptures that you so treasure
[27:58] because he knows that those scriptures
[28:01] that you treasure those who scriptures
[28:03] that give you strength so he realized
[28:05] that it does it in such a simple way and
[28:11] we we just sometimes forget but I thank
[28:15] God for the Holy Spirit because the
[28:18] Bible says that the Holy Ghost will
[28:19] bring all things back to your
[28:22] remembrance at this time in my life I
[28:26] need only go and not just a live but the
[28:31] brain things back to my remembrance yeah
[28:35] that's why it's important to conversate
[28:39] around the scripture with your fellow
[28:42] brothers and sisters because things that
[28:45] we say unbeknownst are unaware are
[28:51] things that they need when they don't
[28:53] well won't even say is what they need or
[28:56] need it anyway second concept' second
[28:59] samuel 5th chapter we're gonna start
[29:04] reading at the 9th verse 1st verse I'm
[29:08] sorry then came all the tribes of Israel
[29:12] to David unto Hebron and spake saying
[29:14] behold we are thy bone and I flesh also
[29:21] in
[29:22] I'm past when Saul was king over us thou
[29:24] wast he that led it out and abroad in
[29:28] Israel and the Lord said to thee thou
[29:33] shalt feed my people Israel and thou
[29:35] shalt be a captain over Israel so all
[29:38] the elders of Israel came to the king to
[29:41] Hebron and King David made a lead with
[29:44] them in Hebron before the Lord and they
[29:47] anointed David king over Israel it's
[29:50] amazing because I believe if I'm correct
[29:53] David received three great anointings
[29:55] anointed by Samuel anointed again here
[30:01] is king and he's finally anointed and
[30:04] and you look at these things because God
[30:07] is perfect in three and we realize Amen
[30:11] that is a significant that we must
[30:14] understand that David had more than one
[30:18] experience of being anointed sometimes
[30:21] we get anointed by God and we think wow
[30:23] that's wonderful and we always looking
[30:26] back but I believe that we continue with
[30:29] God we get more anointing and you know
[30:34] the Bible says David was thirty years
[30:36] old when he began to reign and he
[30:38] reigned for forty years in Hebrew reign
[30:41] over Judah seven years and six months
[30:43] and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty in
[30:46] three years
[30:47] overall Israel and Judah and the king
[30:50] and his men went to Jerusalem unto the
[30:53] Jaypee sites the inhabitants of the land
[30:55] which spake of the David saying except
[30:58] thou taketh away the blind in the lame
[31:00] thou shalt not come in hither thinking
[31:02] David cannot come in hither you know
[31:06] color you know use the poor people as a
[31:08] barricade you know nevertheless David
[31:12] took the stronghold of Zion the same is
[31:15] the City of David and David said on that
[31:19] day
[31:20] whosoever get it up to the gutter and
[31:24] smite at the Jebusites and the lame and
[31:27] the blind that are hated of David so he
[31:31] shall be chief and captain wherefore
[31:33] they said the Bligh
[31:35] and the lane should not come into the
[31:38] house
[31:38] so David dwelt in the fort and called it
[31:41] the city of David David built around
[31:44] about the meelo and inward and David
[31:47] went on up on and grew great and the
[31:52] Lord God of hosts was with him that's
[31:56] what I like and the Lord God of hosts
[32:00] was with him let's pray father we thank
[32:03] you for your grace and your mercy we
[32:05] thank you for enabling us to be here
[32:08] once again this evening we counted as a
[32:11] privilege and an honor many times the
[32:13] flesh get weary but the Spirit in the
[32:15] soul is is it's ready Lord we thank your
[32:19] father for being so good to us in these
[32:21] last four days as men hearts are failing
[32:24] for fear it's as men began to cool off
[32:27] their steel those who help you have left
[32:30] as a witness there is a bride Lord and
[32:33] there is a people that's fired up for
[32:37] you there is are people that are looking
[32:39] with expectation on the translation and
[32:42] and father we thank you for your
[32:45] perfection we thank you for your loving
[32:47] kindness and your tender hand Lord we
[32:50] would not be here had it not been for
[32:53] you
[32:53] thank you for Calvary thank you for
[32:56] shedding your blood for us thank you for
[32:58] cleansing us daily and Lord thank you
[33:00] for your mercy and grace that seemed to
[33:02] that didn't do it to all generations
[33:05] Lord we thank you for serving a god
[33:07] that's inexhaustible Lord a god of
[33:10] patience and a God of love o God Allah
[33:13] God of vision Lord we think your father
[33:15] bless each and every one of us tonight
[33:18] and we'll be careful to give you the
[33:20] praise glory and honor in Jesus Christ's
[33:22] name we pray amen
[33:24] you may be seated as I was saying this
[33:26] morning how that we look at at a
[33:32] situation and and we see by God's grace
[33:36] that David Osher
[33:43] type of Christ and David didn't want
[33:47] anything in the city that would defile
[33:50] the city and the David that we're
[33:54] talking about is the saying the Lord
[33:59] Jesus and I don't think the people
[34:02] realized what's really happening now we
[34:07] seen the prophet of God go I've seen and
[34:10] there's a place in brother Brendan's
[34:13] life it was so dark the Lord didn't
[34:16] allow him to see any father I think it
[34:19] was even during the time of his thinking
[34:26] that the rapture was going to happen in
[34:28] 1977 many men fell away after the
[34:33] rapture didn't take place but brother
[34:35] Branham never gave us dust at the Lord
[34:38] and one thing brother Branham said he
[34:41] says I'm a preacher and he said
[34:44] preachers do make mistakes he said but
[34:47] when I say dust said the Lord he said
[34:51] that's not me it'll never fail and you
[34:56] and I we have seen this message go
[34:58] through transitions and now we're at the
[35:02] very end of it all we have seen God do
[35:11] mighty things you know as I was studying
[35:17] the Word of God the greatest battle ever
[35:21] fought brother Branham transition the
[35:24] soul in the spirit now if you were not
[35:29] understanding where he was coming from
[35:32] you see God allowed things that happened
[35:34] just so because he knew they were going
[35:37] to come those who would look for fault
[35:40] and what you gonna do with Elijah when
[35:43] he told those people how to worship
[35:45] their God why don't you go cut your
[35:48] swelling to shout scream louder
[35:50] da-da-da-da-da you know but those
[35:53] instructions weren't for the bride
[35:57] and he got him all in the frenzy till
[36:00] they began to cut himself they got so
[36:02] desperate you know wanting to hear from
[36:04] their God and he larger knew they
[36:05] weren't gonna hear from their God the
[36:08] God was dead only one true and living
[36:10] God and there are things in this message
[36:13] it's for the foolish and an unbeliever
[36:16] and there are those things in the
[36:19] message that's only for the bride but
[36:21] the bride knows yeah exactly those
[36:25] things that are said there for her when
[36:29] we look and we see by God's grace that
[36:32] God always furnish manna for his bride
[36:41] you know brother Branham talks about
[36:43] Elisha during the famine and he said he
[36:48] call he said that crow came and he fare
[36:50] Elijah did you know that brother Branham
[36:53] liking that crow as a black man go look
[36:56] it up and he said Amen God used the
[37:00] black man to feed Elijah and you don't
[37:03] believe that but let me say you don't
[37:06] believe it but listen even when Elijah
[37:09] who was how William Branham was in this
[37:12] day God sent them where to the colored
[37:18] people it was the colored people down in
[37:26] there and that's why his mother-in-law
[37:28] got so upset and call those people trash
[37:33] it was more than one reason remember
[37:37] brother Branham said that they were
[37:38] having a meeting and they had it in a
[37:40] certain place and because everybody
[37:42] could come north of the South could
[37:47] comes over in that meeting brother
[37:49] Branham winning he saw the real man and
[37:51] the ambassador he said amen they were
[37:53] they were right he said I even sent down
[37:56] by a colored boy did me and they said
[38:01] William Branham William Branham is there
[38:03] anybody he said he is he
[38:09] so I said all of that you know we don't
[38:12] go with color lines and all these things
[38:14] but brother Brandon brings that out for
[38:16] whatever reason he that's what he said
[38:18] the whole point is is to know that God
[38:23] would take a man that was so great in
[38:26] his time and send him to a place that
[38:31] was forbidden off limit the trash of the
[38:36] earth to learn something about God he is
[38:42] not what we think God has in such a way
[38:47] a meant that if we're not careful we'll
[38:52] miss him usually God shows up in the
[38:56] areas that you least expected and we
[39:01] find out in the day it meant that here
[39:03] God comes along and and you look at
[39:05] these things that's in the scripture and
[39:07] had it not been for a prophet to tell us
[39:10] that every word has a meaning there's a
[39:12] purpose behind every word in this Bible
[39:16] the jots and tittles have significance
[39:20] and we came to know and then that when
[39:23] we study now we come and we work and see
[39:26] these words because before we read a
[39:28] word oh that's what it means but now we
[39:30] know that these words when we have to
[39:32] look them up I mean the definitions
[39:35] literally brings the picture into focus
[39:39] I've read the story before is what I'm
[39:42] trying to say
[39:44] we know how David gets Jerusalem he
[39:48] hires people to go conquer falling
[39:51] building all of that David said on that
[39:55] day who shall get it up to the gutter
[39:58] and I look that word up it means the
[40:01] state or abode of those who live in a
[40:05] degree in a degradation a filthy place
[40:09] of misery a mess of misery
[40:15] he goes on and he tells us he said now
[40:19] those places got to be cleaned up kill
[40:23] it all destroy it all and I thought
[40:28] about that and I says Lord is that the
[40:30] way it is that God is now shaking he's
[40:34] shaking the message with every kind of
[40:36] shaking doctrine ohms and everything
[40:38] else now he's going for the gutter he's
[40:43] going for those that are blind and those
[40:45] that are lame amen they would defile the
[40:52] city you said that in Scripture yes it
[40:55] is revelation 21:27 says there shall in
[40:59] no wise enter into it any thing that
[41:01] defileth neither whose work whatsoever
[41:05] worketh abomination or make a lie but
[41:08] they which are written in the Lamb's
[41:10] Book of Life amen
[41:13] and he told those studies I'll make you
[41:15] captain as you go if you go in and kill
[41:18] everything else and bring me Jerusalem
[41:24] hallelujah and you and I must understand
[41:28] amen even in this day that's exactly
[41:31] what William Branham ministry did even
[41:35] though we're living in a time where who
[41:37] saw the will shall come this message has
[41:41] come to transform you if you come here
[41:44] that you blind you're supposed to
[41:46] receive your sight if you come here Lane
[41:49] used to count supposed to come walking
[41:51] at home is that right that's what the
[41:54] third Pole was a man they walked him to
[41:58] the tip they didn't know how but they
[42:00] walk out and they were made whole
[42:02] what made of home somewhere there is a
[42:06] people that really will is believing
[42:09] this message right remember brother man
[42:13] who said that the last outpouring of the
[42:15] Holy Spirit he said we will have one he
[42:18] said but at that time the door of the
[42:20] Gentiles will be closed
[42:22] help us Lord it won't be all god I want
[42:25] to be better know sure that anointing
[42:28] has come to anoint
[42:29] you to make you exactly who you are and
[42:33] if you are bribed you will be anointed
[42:36] with such an anointing
[42:38] hey man you will become a super man I
[42:40] didn't say a super woman I said a super
[42:43] man ah because the Prophet says she
[42:46] becomes him will be so much like him but
[42:51] right now it's the time of cleansing
[42:55] hallelujah and the cleansing is not by
[42:59] water you can wash yourself with the
[43:02] water of the world every day but that's
[43:05] not the cleansing that God wants to see
[43:08] God wants to see the cleansing by fire
[43:12] because God cannot occupy you is that
[43:16] right he cannot fully come into you
[43:19] until the fire comes and burn all the
[43:22] demons away hallelujah that's why
[43:26] sanctification is not just the answer to
[43:28] the problem you've got to go further
[43:31] with God hallelujah sanctification is
[43:34] your walk with God
[43:36] hello though you'll be anointed you've
[43:40] got to be willing to give it up
[43:43] whosoever will let income you've got to
[43:47] be willing to give up you've got to be
[43:49] willing a meant to be cleansed but
[43:52] because God cleanse you doesn't give you
[43:54] a ticket or seat in heaven it doesn't
[43:58] stop there amen
[44:00] it is God preparing you tearing you for
[44:04] I eat eternal city and in this eternal
[44:08] city and then the only way you can get
[44:11] there you must be fired baptized is that
[44:15] right yeah man brother brother tells us
[44:17] about it and he says I think is even a
[44:20] message countdown how did the world the
[44:22] earth itself has to come stages
[44:25] justification sanctification baptism of
[44:29] the Holy Ghost and this baptism of the
[44:31] Holy Ghost makes room for the Holy Ghost
[44:34] himself is that right oh we thought it's
[44:37] the Pentecostals oh praise God I've been
[44:39] baptized with the Holy Ghost you
[44:41] just begun you just came into life
[44:45] you've just been begotten but you still
[44:49] need a birth you really need a holy goes
[44:52] far baptism right that's where the
[44:58] battle in the mind is because now you've
[45:01] got to kick out all the inhabitants of
[45:03] the land everything that's in your flesh
[45:06] and in your fleshly mind you by the holy
[45:09] spirit must kick them out
[45:12] is that right regardless to the category
[45:16] it falls under there's only three
[45:18] categories of sin that lust of the flesh
[45:21] the lust of the eyes and the pride of
[45:23] life but everything else falls under
[45:26] those three categories and you've got to
[45:28] get rid of it all but how am I going to
[45:31] get rid of it Lord how am I like we
[45:34] always have help me Lord God is the only
[45:38] one that can give you the fire baptism
[45:41] is that John's doctrine or not John said
[45:45] I can baptize you with the holy water
[45:47] hallelujah but he that cometh after me
[45:50] he's the one that can baptize you with
[45:53] the Holy Ghost in fire I can't give that
[45:55] to you brother Branham couldn't give it
[45:57] to you
[45:58] it takes so wholly goes himself to give
[46:01] you the fire baptism hallelujah is that
[46:07] right oh it's the truth
[46:09] I believe in brother branham's day if he
[46:11] could have given everybody the Holy
[46:13] Ghost he would have given it to them
[46:14] that's just how much love he had right
[46:18] but he understood one thing the Holy
[46:20] Ghost is only for the elected seat of
[46:22] God hallelujah
[46:24] oh yes the Pentecostals they out there
[46:27] getting the Holy Ghost some of them but
[46:29] it's only in the spirit so you can't get
[46:32] into the heart because they don't they
[46:33] won't the veil got to be ripped now they
[46:37] need a word that can penetrate to the
[46:40] soul walk and rip the soul apart ah
[46:43] come on somebody even it's gotta be a
[46:46] word Amen they could that can bring that
[46:48] van to a place where God can go in and
[46:51] sit on your throne
[46:54] hallelujah amen and is the soul see
[46:57] that's why God did what he did
[46:59] amen because in the soul brethren said
[47:02] there's only faith and doubt is that
[47:08] right now some people could confuse
[47:11] because their praise he's called the
[47:13] soul the spirit and spirit the soul but
[47:15] the pony is those who are the bride we
[47:16] know who he's what he's talking about a
[47:18] man by faith huh
[47:22] it wasn't by emotions that God Amen
[47:24] created everything it was by faith and
[47:27] faith and doubt is in the soul oh my god
[47:32] if you listen to that message
[47:34] he said if God he said of God if you
[47:36] could let God into your soul faint like
[47:39] that he said you become a solar system
[47:42] you know what a solar system it means
[47:44] the Sun sets right in the middle and
[47:47] controls all the planets controls all of
[47:52] that
[47:52] oh come on somebody this soul when he
[47:55] said that I said okay you become a solar
[47:58] system a solar system and I thought
[48:00] about all of those virtues becoming
[48:01] planets mmm
[48:05] circling you like that yeah and that's
[48:08] all got every one of them in control
[48:11] nothing gets out of order because the
[48:14] Sun has a grip on them hallelujah and
[48:16] that's how it is with a true born-again
[48:19] fire baptized man come to recognize what
[48:23] he possessed see that they were trying
[48:25] to keep that from us I believe that we
[48:28] got something here but we're not really
[48:29] utilizing it we're not allowing God a
[48:32] mentor to touch a function in us
[48:34] hallelujah ha the prophet of God said
[48:37] because of those flus those inlets those
[48:41] inlets are plugged up with all kinds of
[48:44] downton filth and you name it we got it
[48:46] all plugged up and so god can't go in
[48:49] and out like he wants to but he said you
[48:51] got to clean it out hallelujah and you
[48:54] and I we know what I hear issues are we
[48:56] must clean it out let God come in and
[49:00] give you a thorough flushing Holly Nia
[49:04] is more than
[49:06] is more than fasting it's more than
[49:08] anything and then when God comes here
[49:10] you know what he is like a love affair
[49:12] he gets everything out and make sure
[49:15] it's perfected is that's okay
[49:22] now if David didn't let nothing unclean
[49:25] come into the city film and that's what
[49:29] people say people don't understand your
[49:31] word I know people who are in this
[49:33] message who are literally miserable not
[49:37] because they never had an experience
[49:40] they did just what John brother John
[49:42] said they believed the message but they
[49:46] never came into the Holy Ghost hmm and
[49:49] just believing the message is gonna make
[49:52] you miserable
[49:53] why cuz you can't live it you know
[49:56] what's right but you can't do it
[49:59] hallelujah but you need a real Holy
[50:02] Ghost experience beyond amen

[50:06] of times we think oh my god and I was
[50:08] the same way God gave it to me give it
[50:11] to you begging him but it was the wrong
[50:13] kind wrong way

[50:40] you it again but you he means room in
[50:42] you for the gift you got to make room
[50:46] for him
[50:47] Oh help us Lord that's what David he was
[50:52] able to conquer the city he was able to
[50:53] gain the city Amen because
[50:55] amen the Lord of Hosts was with him and
[50:58] like I said this morning we got the Lord
[51:01] of Hosts with us we've got the mighty
[51:03] angel hallelujah who is Christ himself
[51:06] is that right
[51:08] amen that's why he comes again in
[51:10] Revelation amen coming with his horse

[51:19] better here we gave victory day here we
[51:22] went up there hallelujah and now he
[51:24] brings us back he's not worried and
[51:27] concerned about whether the war would be
[51:29] won hallelujah he knows he's got real
[51:32] experienced soldiers hallelujah who's
[51:35] gone through a real boot training in
[51:36] boot camp and everything else knows the
[51:39] devil before he sees it
[51:40] hallelujah I don't know about that spell
[51:43] but people say like they could smell the
[51:45] devil I never smelled him but I'm sure
[51:48] that's not a pleasant thing but
[51:50] nevertheless you and I must run this
[51:52] town instead is that right he's
[51:55] Beelzebub we don't be other above means
[51:58] Lord of the Flies Lord of the dung yes

[52:03] smelling too good setting up on the
[52:05] other hand
[52:06] oh god I'm on the dung oh god help us
[52:09] teeth but anyway that's the way God says
[52:12] he is but you know what we a lot of
[52:15] times people don't even know what that
[52:16] means
[52:17] that means he's Lord of hell that's the
[52:20] dung hallelujah
[52:26] they looked unto Him and we're like
[52:28] listen I sought the Lord called the
[52:30] proverbs 30:4
[52:31] and he heard me and delivered me from
[52:35] all my fear that's what they said fear
[52:39] doesn't harm you as to fear I fear that
[52:41] harms you they look under him and we're
[52:46] lightened and their faces were not
[52:48] ashamed
[52:49] this poor man cry and the Lord heard him
[52:53] and saved him out of all his troubles
[52:57] right they talked about Christ but at
[53:01] the same time you can use that this poor
[53:03] man cry
[53:05] blessed is the poor in spirit all right
[53:08] hey and the Lord her and saved him out
[53:13] of all his troubles the age of the Lord
[53:16] in camping around about them that fear
[53:19] Him and delivering them
[53:23] now we've got an angel y'all believe
[53:26] that like I said he's not just here he's
[53:28] here hallelujah hey man and we
[53:32] we though we'd never see we hardly ever
[53:34] see him he's still here he never went
[53:38] that huh and he's here to help you how
[53:44] many times you've been almost in a wreck
[53:46] in the car stop on a dime who you
[53:49] thought or what you thought stop the car
[53:53] you understand me see so many phenomenal
[53:56] things happen around us and we don't
[53:59] even see it but God has always protected
[54:01] us even when we didn't even know he was
[54:05] protecting us and if he protected us
[54:07] when we didn't know it what about now
[54:13] hallelujah
[54:15] future whom he calls the church through
[54:18] justification and calls it through
[54:20] sanctification then feels it with the
[54:22] Holy Ghost and fire and he took it
[54:24] through a process that he himself the
[54:26] Holy Spirit Himself the son of God could
[54:29] dwell in the human heart now it was to
[54:32] go through that before he can't come
[54:34] into it huh
[54:37] let me read that again he brought us
[54:40] through just sanctification then filled
[54:42] us he excuse me he called the church
[54:44] through justification call it through
[54:46] sanctification then filled it with the
[54:49] Holy Ghost and fire and he took it he
[54:53] took it through a process that he
[54:56] himself the Holy Spirit Himself the son
[54:58] of God could dwell in the human heart
[55:00] now it has to go through that before he
[55:04] can come into it huh so you got to go
[55:09] through it you really want a great
[55:11] experience with God you've got to start
[55:13] battling in your mind you got to fight
[55:15] when the devil brings you down to your
[55:17] faith that right when he says you weak
[55:20] you gotta say you're strong is that
[55:23] right when you said you don't have no
[55:25] knowledge I do have knowledge if I don't
[55:27] know the whole books I know that Jesus
[55:29] Christ is Lord hallelujah amen and when
[55:32] it comes to temperance all I got to do
[55:34] is stand still is that right
[55:36] a many patients oh my God all I gotta do
[55:40] is let go and let God is that
[55:42] amen when it comes to Gotham is all I
[55:44] need to do is follow his thoughts is I
[55:47] ride you just gotta let go let God and
[55:51] when the devil talk bad about drunk
[55:52] brother you said but he's a kind man
[55:54] hallelujah he's a sweet live is that
[55:57] right for the man said if you're gonna
[55:58] say anything about your brother
[56:00] make it good huh it's simple but it's by
[56:08] reasoning we fail and God is saying stop
[56:15] your reasoning stop letting the devil
[56:17] talk to you because I'm gonna tell you
[56:20] something if you think the devil gonna
[56:21] stop talking to you while you livin you
[56:23] wrong
[56:24] he ain't gonna stop talking to you - you
[56:26] did hello and then it when you did he
[56:32] can talk all you what he won't do you
[56:33] won't be able to hear but the devil
[56:36] ain't gonna leave you alone you old
[56:39] devil leave me alone definitely gonna
[56:40] leave you alone
[56:41] his commission is to torment you he's a
[56:44] tormentor he's the thing that God
[56:49] allowed to bring in his opposition you
[56:52] know God needed some money to fight with
[56:54] him he's got God used him hallelujah but
[56:59] God had already told you to balance been
[57:01] walked fought in the features you want
[57:02] it ain't your battle stand stealing the
[57:06] Lord will fight your battle he said

[57:16] back to Israel do you know what what did
[57:18] they do these 40 years when they made
[57:21] their organizations out there instead of
[57:24] going on through led by the pillar of
[57:26] fire then each of the Lord which was
[57:28] Christ instead of going on through and
[57:31] following him in about ten days they've
[57:34] been in the full promise but you know
[57:37] what they wandered in the wilderness
[57:39] Bible said they come to caters Barnea
[57:42] which was the judgement seat and there
[57:45] when the spies come back and talk about
[57:47] the land they said we can't do it
[57:50] hallelujah I don't know what they're
[57:52] talking about
[57:53] God never told them to conquer the land
[57:56] hallelujah God told him to lay it was
[57:58] already conquered wherever you place
[58:01] your feet is yours why they come back
[58:04] said we can't conquer it they had no
[58:06] business coming back with such a report

[58:11] had to do is go and that's what those -
[58:13] when cattle said the Laird conquered

[58:17] let's get some of these grains and take
[58:19] them back they could care less about the
[58:21] Giants that was in the land and that's
[58:23] the problem we can't see the promise
[58:26] because of the Giants in the halls every
[58:30] time you're looking at the Giant you're
[58:31] gonna bring back a bad report hmm my
[58:38] Giants hallelujah my god looked down on
[58:42] Giants Catelyn Johnson said we are more
[58:47] than able to do it
[58:48] so they was looking to God's promise not
[58:52] what the concision
[58:54] not what the circumstances was see
[58:58] that's the problem
[58:59] let me go back on this he said listen we
[59:01] are more than able to do it for they was
[59:03] looking to God's promise not what the
[59:06] circumstances was you see that's how we
[59:09] get defeated we're looking at the
[59:12] circumstances hallelujah some of us Amen
[59:15] travelling as Christians for a long time
[59:17] and all we can do is look at
[59:19] circumstances who you know God doesn't
[59:22] call you but you feel that God gonna
[59:23] fail because you in a mess God don't
[59:26] take but a minute to clean you up
[59:28] everybody have their appointed time
[59:31] hallelujah but God can't move until you
[59:33] stop believing that he can do it if you
[59:36] can't believe that God can change you
[59:37] God cannot change you but if you have
[59:40] faith that God can change you to change
[59:42] your situation no matter what it is God
[59:44] can do it God will do it huh
[59:49] is that Alright every astronaut has to
[59:53] be pressurized whoo we don't like that

[1:00:04] when you know that you have to go
[1:00:05] through it it's like when you're in boot
[1:00:09] camp and
[1:00:10] they take you to the gas chamber and you
[1:00:12] know already they gonna take that mask
[1:00:14] off
[1:00:14] you're not looking forward to it you
[1:00:17] know it's gonna be a painful experience
[1:00:19] something that you've never experienced
[1:00:22] before but you want to be a soldier so
[1:00:26] what do you do you go through the pain
[1:00:29] you go through the gas chamber when the
[1:00:33] window sergeant said take it off you got
[1:00:35] to take it off and they just let you
[1:00:38] stay there just for a moment long enough
[1:00:39] to get your coffin
[1:00:42] [Laughter]
[1:00:43] hallelujah but you have a goal and that
[1:00:46] goal
[1:00:47] amen is to be completely a complete soul
[1:00:50] job you know when it comes to the Word
[1:00:57] of God you got to realize one thing that
[1:01:00] when it comes to God a lot of people
[1:01:02] believe and they don't they fail to see
[1:01:05] they can't hear God's voice if you ever
[1:01:10] put it never said it like this when the
[1:01:13] Pharisees and the Sadducees had come on
[1:01:15] the scene all they knew was what Moses
[1:01:17] said and Abraham is our Father so when
[1:01:22] Jesus came they couldn't hear the voice
[1:01:25] that told Abraham and Moses what they
[1:01:29] knew see I'm the same thing that happens
[1:01:34] here when brother Branham came on the
[1:01:36] scene he came to introduce Jesus Christ
[1:01:38] not himself many times he said forget
[1:01:43] about me you know why I'm saying this
[1:01:45] because people who read the message and
[1:01:47] they look right at it and I've seen
[1:01:50] people say I've had people say to me
[1:01:52] remember when brother Branham said 700
[1:01:55] really he that's what he meant
[1:01:57] said you know is he gonna be around 700
[1:02:00] he just you know kind of backed off with
[1:02:02] a little bit what did you just make my
[1:02:04] prophet do you made him a liar and he
[1:02:08] cannot go against the script he said oh
[1:02:10] he said I didn't even I wouldn't even
[1:02:11] know where he said I knew it was 7,000 I
[1:02:14] don't know why I said 700 but there are
[1:02:17] people and I could call their names move
[1:02:20] in a certain movement that really
[1:02:21] believed that over 700 because
[1:02:23] he said so well what happens when he
[1:02:26] called Peter John we move he said you
[1:02:32] know we follow tradition when we get
[1:02:33] into a place y'all understand what I'm
[1:02:35] trying to say that's why they could not
[1:02:39] believe that Jesus Christ was the
[1:02:40] Messiah because they saw the human part
[1:02:43] of him and when he said I am my father
[1:02:48] one they could not see the human part of
[1:02:51] it and that's what is happening are they
[1:02:54] and when you say things like this people
[1:02:56] think you preach that preaching against
[1:02:58] the Prophet no trying to open our eyes
[1:03:02] because certain things will you
[1:03:08] so you walk out here believing that it
[1:03:11] was 700 instead of 7,000 you have just
[1:03:14] taken away from the word you see and
[1:03:18] people you know all you speaking evil
[1:03:21] about the Prophet that is a devil that
[1:03:25] got people's eyes blind y'all hear what
[1:03:28] I'm saying and I didn't say that that
[1:03:30] came out of my mouth so I believe that
[1:03:33] was the Lord that said that I would be
[1:03:34] afraid to even say such a thing but my
[1:03:36] point is we've got people who are so
[1:03:39] afraid then they they're not secure they
[1:03:42] haven't made their own election sure
[1:03:45] they have they're not sure so they hold
[1:03:48] to what he says and in what he says it's
[1:03:51] true
[1:03:51] but they don't have their own revelation
[1:03:54] you got to have your own revelation you
[1:03:57] got to have thus the Holy Ghost in you
[1:03:58] like he had in him you you can't even be
[1:04:01] a witness you are powerless charged
[1:04:04] without the Holy gold and I find out
[1:04:08] that that's what so many people they
[1:04:10] just get so carried away amen and they
[1:04:13] think your blaspheming or saying
[1:04:14] something even that is a devil that's
[1:04:16] interpreting those things to your mind
[1:04:23] one of these mornings gods achieve
[1:04:27] this astronauts that's climbed to Jesus
[1:04:30] Christ has been in there by the Holy
[1:04:31] Ghost filled with this power one of
[1:04:34] these mornings the whole universe will
[1:04:37] be screaming and wailing and gnashing of
[1:04:40] teeth when they see they've missed it
[1:04:42] when the great Eagle powered by the Holy
[1:04:46] Ghost and fire began to spread her wings
[1:04:49] the astronauts would take off into the
[1:04:52] sky to go to meet the bridegroom and
[1:04:55] when the bride takes off in the
[1:04:58] astronaut power of God Almighty who sent
[1:05:02] Jesus Christ to the earth in the form of
[1:05:05] the Holy Ghost and has brought the
[1:05:07] church through these achievements so you
[1:05:10] understand each level of faith you go up
[1:05:13] it is an achievement you get it my
[1:05:23] brothers and sisters get pressurized the
[1:05:26] pressure won't hurt you when you get on
[1:05:29] the inside and get pressurized get in
[1:05:33] Christ and you won't care what the world
[1:05:36] says they can never hit you anyhow you
[1:05:39] say see how are you talking about
[1:05:44] brother Brooks I'm trying to tell us
[1:05:45] something men it's easy for a man to
[1:05:53] become an air dollar to your husband is
[1:05:58] Jesus Christ and don't you ever forget
[1:05:59] it
[1:06:02] but even when God had done so many great
[1:06:05] things for Peter James and John they
[1:06:07] were like his running partners took him
[1:06:10] up on the Mount Transfiguration they've
[1:06:14] heard all kinds of things
[1:06:16] seeing all kind of things and now they
[1:06:18] see the glory of God Moses in the lodge
[1:06:21] and I still want to know how they knew
[1:06:23] that was Moses in a life how did they
[1:06:26] know that was Moses and Elijah that was
[1:06:32] a revelation wasn't it and here
[1:06:35] they want to build Tabernacles and I
[1:06:38] find that in the message that's exactly
[1:06:41] what has happened we are building
[1:06:44] Tabernacles and every tabernacle is not
[1:06:48] built unto Jesus Christ there are some
[1:06:53] tapping out was built for Elijah it's
[1:06:59] true even though Jesus said right true
[1:07:06] did he say it he said to brother Branham
[1:07:09] Easter seal a true Mount Transfiguration
[1:07:14] experience will only glorify Jesus
[1:07:17] Christ well that's what he said but when
[1:07:23] you preach that people almost get
[1:07:25] offended at that and you know why
[1:07:28] because when they get offended it's ever
[1:07:30] did that they have a different spirit
[1:07:34] can I go on the battle is on
[1:07:37] we don't battle against our organization
[1:07:41] we know where they are
[1:07:43] we better against demons in this thing
[1:07:47] there are no demons in the message
[1:07:49] because they have to be born again but
[1:07:51] they are all around what we teach and
[1:07:54] the whole purpose is to keep this bride
[1:07:57] from being rod but they don't understand
[1:07:59] even the demons don't understand it's
[1:08:02] the seed power it's the power of the
[1:08:05] seed that makes us bride it's not by our
[1:08:08] works it's not by human efforts it's by
[1:08:11] the Holy Spirit on the inside of us
[1:08:13] that's what makes us different that's
[1:08:16] what makes us invincible that's what
[1:08:18] makes us see things that other people
[1:08:21] can't see even among our own and then we
[1:08:25] will be called names and blasphemers and
[1:08:28] things like that because we love the
[1:08:30] Lord Jesus
[1:08:31] like I said when that angel came to me
[1:08:35] vision dream whatever it was I told him
[1:08:39] I could only love the Lord Jesus and
[1:08:41] ever since then things have been
[1:08:42] happening bad things everywhere it's
[1:08:45] been a real flood I'm like do what you
[1:08:47] got to do but I stand on this solid
[1:08:49] Karelia I stand on this solid rock my
[1:08:54] hope is built on nothing less than Jesus
[1:08:56] blood and its righteousness and I dare
[1:09:00] not trust dare not trust nothing oh holy
[1:09:05] lino nothing but Jesus name and his
[1:09:09] righteousness hmm is that what brother
[1:09:13] Branham stood on a man I was telling
[1:09:16] somebody I can't hardly wait this in
[1:09:18] hallelujah will you see I'm gonna see
[1:09:20] him if I'm dead I'm gonna see him if I'm
[1:09:23] alive I'm gonna see him why he's my
[1:09:26] brother the greatest battle ever fought
[1:09:32] she is going on right in here now yes
[1:09:36] sir
[1:09:37] between life and death between sickness
[1:09:39] and health between faith and doubt oh my
[1:09:43] between Liberty and bondage you know God
[1:09:47] sent me here and you know I had to you
[1:09:50] know I told her uh things down there in
[1:09:52] Liberty City I said God didn't bring me
[1:09:54] here and bring you here for me to preach
[1:09:56] to you something that you already know
[1:09:58] and what you need to do is see God and
[1:10:01] not me right if you can see God you'll
[1:10:06] see my purpose but if you can't see God
[1:10:09] you'll never see me I'm gonna go
[1:10:11] contrary to a lot of things you think
[1:10:13] and believe it is what it is because I
[1:10:19] got a single ayah brothers my eyes are
[1:10:22] single hmm there's only one Lord one
[1:10:26] faith in one baptism and I've gotten in
[1:10:30] trouble because people try to deify him
[1:10:32] and do everything else I don't care if
[1:10:33] you're deify brother branham as long as
[1:10:35] you defy me - we're in the same family
[1:10:39] don't make him something amen oh they
[1:10:43] don't hear those quotes that I hear I
[1:10:44] don't listen for just oh let me see now
[1:10:47] I hear things that people just don't
[1:10:49] hear and if the probably God would come
[1:10:52] back in this day he probably died well
[1:10:56] if he see what has happened to what his
[1:10:59] ministry is supposed to produce hello
[1:11:03] it's the truth and you usually are all
[1:11:10] brothers I don't I believe that I really
[1:11:13] believe that because when he left off
[1:11:16] the scene even random tabernacle was
[1:11:18] backsliding
[1:11:20] it didn't look like it in a dress
[1:11:22] perhaps but they were backsliding
[1:11:24] because they didn't love God no more he
[1:11:27] said you've lost your first love now
[1:11:31] people get here little old well we've
[1:11:33] seen that before
[1:11:34] what was that everything was going cold
[1:11:38] way back then so where is it now I'll
[1:11:43] tell you I've traveled and I've seen I
[1:11:46] tell you what like I was telling the
[1:11:48] brothers now I've had preachers come
[1:11:50] back to me who grew up in my ministry
[1:11:52] and now they say brother books I really
[1:11:54] see what she was trying to do I said you
[1:11:56] know what I was trying to do I said I
[1:11:57] was trying to protect you you know I
[1:12:00] wasn't never jealous of your ministry or
[1:12:02] jealous of what you could do but I knew
[1:12:05] what was out there and I was trying to
[1:12:07] protect you
[1:12:08] now you experienced it now you see for
[1:12:11] yourself
[1:12:11] amen that and all of that beautiful
[1:12:15] stuff that they got going out of there
[1:12:17] you better come back to the Holy Ghost
[1:12:19] you better come back to being born again
[1:12:23] huh
[1:12:24] understand all mysteries Paul said and
[1:12:26] you don't have charity it profits you
[1:12:29] nothing hmm God listen what he said he
[1:12:39] goes on and says listen I'm gonna go
[1:12:41] back and read this whole thing it's just
[1:12:42] okay this from the greatest battle ever
[1:12:44] fought he said the greatest battle ever
[1:12:46] fought she is going she is going on
[1:12:48] right in here now yes sir
[1:12:51] between life and death between sickness
[1:12:54] and health between faith and doubt or in
[1:12:57] between Liberty and bondage now he
[1:12:59] covered the whole thing hmm man because
[1:13:06] of you whatever batter you gone through
[1:13:07] is between life and death sickness or
[1:13:10] health faith or doubt or liberty and
[1:13:13] bondage and you got to whip him and
[1:13:15] everyone
[1:13:16] those areas to be completely free the
[1:13:19] battle is on shine your Spears soldiers
[1:13:21] polish up the armor God is getting his
[1:13:24] soldiers ready amen God Ananse his army
[1:13:28] America dresses their soldiers in the
[1:13:31] best that they can have to dress with
[1:13:33] steel helmets Hartman's armors and
[1:13:36] whatever they got armored tanks and
[1:13:39] whatever they go in God dresses his army
[1:13:42] hallelujah what kind of equipment do we
[1:13:45] use the spirit of the sword the Word of
[1:13:48] God amen
[1:13:50] the Word of God is sharper than
[1:13:51] two-edged swords Hebrew piercing even to
[1:13:55] the Sunda the bone even the Merrill of
[1:13:57] the bone even a discerner have the
[1:13:59] thought of the mind the Word of God to
[1:14:02] believe his word that's the way God's
[1:14:05] armor right that right and John 15 said
[1:14:09] of your body me and my word abiding you
[1:14:11] you should ask what you will and it
[1:14:13] shall be done unto you here it is my
[1:14:16] father's glory that you bear much fruit
[1:14:18] so shall ye be my disciples hallelujah
[1:14:23] as father have loved me so have I loved
[1:14:27] you continue ye in my love hallelujah if
[1:14:31] you keep my Commandments and ye shall
[1:14:33] abide in my love even as I have kept my
[1:14:36] father's Commandments
[1:14:37] abide in his love hallelujah you know
[1:14:41] what it's amazing how we don't have love
[1:14:43] it's amazing I've said in services Amen
[1:14:48] with preachers were wrong or said
[1:14:49] something wrong and I said they're still
[1:14:52] huh because I recognize them as soldiers
[1:14:55] of the cross hallelujah I recognize them
[1:14:59] as an auntie preachers hallelujah and
[1:15:03] when it comes a men to us and then
[1:15:05] sometimes somebody say something or do
[1:15:07] something and we ready to quit I've seen
[1:15:10] it everywhere everywhere I go you know
[1:15:21] what it
[1:15:23] this way when it comes to battling some
[1:15:26] people don't even know how to walk they
[1:15:29] have no idea on how to fight and it
[1:15:33] shows people i'ma tell you something if
[1:15:35] you don't have word in you let me ask
[1:15:38] you a question
[1:15:39] knowing the seven seals having a
[1:15:41] revelation of the seers when you going
[1:15:43] through battle which which one of those
[1:15:45] seals you use for encouragement what
[1:15:50] gives you strength it's the depths of
[1:15:53] the word is the word you know where we
[1:16:00] go we're more than conquerors through
[1:16:03] Christ who strengthens us huh we go
[1:16:09] right back to a lot of things Paul said
[1:16:14] you understand me and when it comes to a
[1:16:18] personal revelation of God that's why I
[1:16:22] said when it comes when he becomes real
[1:16:24] to you he's no longer religion you know
[1:16:29] we're supposed to sing folks
[1:16:31] listen and in God he puts up with us
[1:16:34] because the hour of the day the Holy
[1:16:37] Spirit is lifting from the earth and
[1:16:39] that's true y'all know it's true it's
[1:16:42] difficult to pray it anyway it used to
[1:16:44] be but you got to pray that right once
[1:16:47] you get in that channel you alright but
[1:16:49] getting in the channel sometimes can be
[1:16:50] quite difficult right amen
[1:16:53] oh how many of y'all I used too fast all
[1:16:55] the time now I have to bear God you know
[1:16:59] we ain't no being God is actually being
[1:17:01] led by God but there sometimes I just
[1:17:03] want to fast to feel closer because it
[1:17:06] does that's what fasting does for me it
[1:17:08] makes me feel close they seem to shop in
[1:17:11] my spirit mind right but anyhow when
[1:17:17] you're fasting it seems like you know
[1:17:19] who you are you got a purpose right so
[1:17:23] anyway those kind of things you helps be
[1:17:26] now but when we look at this thing we
[1:17:28] say okay God's Word is true it is true
[1:17:31] but understand Jesus this word we've
[1:17:35] never seen it before like this but
[1:17:37] for as he thinketh in his heart so is he
[1:17:42] these virtues are supposed to be the
[1:17:45] capstone basically the pyramid the power
[1:17:47] of God in your heart every thought
[1:17:52] supposed to be thought according to this
[1:17:59] hmm you know you got to die you got a
[1:18:02] rot but every thoughts supposed to have
[1:18:05] faith virtue dogs whatever it's supposed
[1:18:07] to be pure the Bible said in these
[1:18:10] things abide in you according to Peter
[1:18:13] you'll never be barren never neither
[1:18:16] will you be unfruitful you will always
[1:18:19] stand in God and this is an achievement
[1:18:28] and without love it'll never work
[1:18:32] because brother Branham said love is the
[1:18:34] thing that seals all these in you got to
[1:18:39] be born of God for that love to come in
[1:18:42] you and seal you up think about the
[1:18:47] stuff I thought we had a good service
[1:18:48] this morning but where are the people
[1:18:51] guarantee you they sitting down eating
[1:18:53] somewhere huh y'all know we love to eat
[1:18:57] and that's what they doing watching
[1:19:02] something they shouldn't watch whatever
[1:19:04] the case may be the Bible said there are
[1:19:07] Moses and they rose up to play and
[1:19:10] that's exactly what happened to a lot of
[1:19:12] people in the church and you know what
[1:19:15] kills me sometime they people are coming
[1:19:17] to you said brother Prince I haven't
[1:19:19] seen you in a long time you ain't been
[1:19:21] in a long time and in my mind said you
[1:19:23] need to come at least on Wednesday
[1:19:24] you'll see me a little more often but
[1:19:27] all you do is come on Sundays and you
[1:19:29] don't see me in the morning comes you
[1:19:33] know cuz sometimes when I go down there
[1:19:36] I still come up here Sunday evening I'm
[1:19:42] talking about growth I'm coming up
[1:19:45] winning battles when we can't even get
[1:19:48] over these little petty things
[1:19:50] these little personal issues you know
[1:19:54] what what should I'm supposed to do
[1:19:55] brothers sister what will you do an
[1:19:57] evening service I hadn't seen you in an
[1:19:59] evening service and almost since you
[1:20:02] start coming you know that has a two way
[1:20:07] of going you know but I don't bother
[1:20:09] people at least I know where I am but we
[1:20:16] we don't know how to humble ourselves we
[1:20:18] feel feel you know I'm gonna tell you
[1:20:20] all something and like the people who I
[1:20:22] think now for the faithful Todd pears
[1:20:24] here but do you think I'm here for your
[1:20:26] tithing you couldn't pay me enough money
[1:20:31] to be a pastor my wife and I was talking
[1:20:35] about that the other day you either call
[1:20:37] are you insane
[1:20:42] mister truth and somebody sometimes
[1:20:46] people that were like I'm giving my
[1:20:47] little nickel and diming that's going to
[1:20:49] help brother Bruce it's going to help
[1:20:50] you if you don't do it you in trouble
[1:20:58] but we do these things and we said oh
[1:21:01] I'm maturing maturing we're better I'd
[1:21:04] even gone through the principles of the
[1:21:06] word yet you said you have faith and you
[1:21:10] don't even have faith to give 10% it
[1:21:15] ain't just here's everywhere thank God
[1:21:18] for those who are faithful may God
[1:21:21] richly bless you and multiply you a
[1:21:23] hundred folks eriously what we need to
[1:21:29] do is humble ourselves that's what the
[1:21:31] Bible says humble yourselves therefore
[1:21:32] under the mighty hand of God because if
[1:21:35] you think you gonna tell god what to do
[1:21:37] with this program you are absolutely
[1:21:39] wrong god thing you didn't call God like
[1:21:42] I said who's gonna be his counselor who
[1:21:45] came to God in order for God to bring
[1:21:48] recompense give you more money or
[1:21:50] something
[1:21:50] who did that nobody we only love God
[1:21:55] because He first loved us Yemi and you
[1:21:59] know how to be so grateful let me tell
[1:22:01] you something you know I used to
[1:22:04] friend of mine when we was in high
[1:22:05] school he you know during the summer you
[1:22:07] know we used to have those uh summer
[1:22:11] jobs he got the job as a garbage man and
[1:22:15] people was laughing at me working with
[1:22:19] garbage truck then I had more cysts in
[1:22:21] all of us when the summer was over he
[1:22:24] had new clothes and all kind of stuff
[1:22:27] and money yeah he what I'm saying while
[1:22:30] we was laughing at him he suffered the
[1:22:32] reproach because he knew the reward
[1:22:35] so what call me whatever you want to
[1:22:38] call me I know why I'm here and the
[1:22:40] purpose I'm here and there is coming
[1:22:43] everywhere I'll never forget that I
[1:22:49] thought to myself you know next time I
[1:22:51] might try to get on that garbage truck
[1:22:52] myself I never did I just was a milkman
[1:22:56] you know anyway you look at these people
[1:22:59] and you you you and back in the day that
[1:23:02] was good money I don't know how they pay
[1:23:03] the garbage man now but back in that day
[1:23:06] that was they made good money while
[1:23:08] everybody else was laughing at them in
[1:23:09] Columbia South Carolina the garbage man
[1:23:11] made good money very good money mm-hmm
[1:23:16] they wrote them garbage clothes doing
[1:23:17] they doing work but after work they were
[1:23:19] yeah you see what it is brown goes on to
[1:23:24] say in the greatest battle ever thought
[1:23:26] he said if you come you'll keep their
[1:23:28] memories and conscience and everything
[1:23:31] thinking about well I might fail it
[1:23:34] might not be right he said don't you do
[1:23:38] that at all the moment you think it's
[1:23:42] gonna fail the moment you think it's not
[1:23:45] gonna work
[1:23:46] you just messed up doubt has destroyed
[1:23:49] everything and you got to look at
[1:23:53] something like Abraham did and call
[1:23:55] those things and be not as though they
[1:23:57] were
[1:23:58] I don't know how God is gonna do it all
[1:24:01] but I know he's doing it why is he doing
[1:24:04] it because I believe it can be done
[1:24:08] we're taking the land and in a little
[1:24:12] while that divine love is going to come
[1:24:14] and cap everything off and when a dog we
[1:24:17] will take
[1:24:17] skyy hallelujah oh we think we know what
[1:24:24] love is a man brother and his wife said
[1:24:29] bill you preached it but you have no
[1:24:32] idea huh you have no idea
[1:24:37] hmm and brother Brandon said that Holy
[1:24:39] Ghost has it come down from from heaven
[1:24:42] it decreased city by the time it gets to
[1:24:45] us it's just a little little something a
[1:24:47] little shout of something yeah he said
[1:24:49] but that's just a little shadow of
[1:24:51] what's there I told you when I was first
[1:24:55] baptized with the Holy Ghost I didn't
[1:24:57] know whether I I was supposed to kill a
[1:24:58] roach or not I was in love it's the
[1:25:07] truth oh I'm almost done people see your
[1:25:12] word is eternal truth and it's for me
[1:25:15] see he said you throw it throw us out
[1:25:18] everything and open up the channel and
[1:25:21] say god your word is eternal truth
[1:25:25] I love that and it's not for me and
[1:25:28] excuse me and it it's for me it is for
[1:25:31] me if the old church fell in the hole
[1:25:35] well fair yes I can't yet I cannot fail
[1:25:40] because I've made I'm taking the word
[1:25:44] there's a battle and that's the thing
[1:25:47] I'm taking the word I'm gonna hold the
[1:25:51] word and and when does he say he
[1:25:53] promised me I don't know Oh Mary said
[1:25:56] well how could this thing be I don't
[1:25:57] know how it's gonna be
[1:25:59] it doesn't make scientific sense but
[1:26:02] Lord be it unto me according to your
[1:26:05] word I don't know how our translation is
[1:26:07] going to take place there are no
[1:26:08] mathematical equations that's going to
[1:26:11] bring me into a understanding of how
[1:26:13] this body that is Lord will be changed
[1:26:16] to immortality I don't know how we're
[1:26:18] gonna disappear in the twinkling of an
[1:26:20] eye but I pray he promised hallelujah
[1:26:24] images well I don't have the Holy Ghost
[1:26:26] yet but he promised he said if you
[1:26:28] repent and be baptized in the name of
[1:26:31] Jesus
[1:26:31] five you shall receive the gift of the
[1:26:33] Holy Ghost he promised it hallelujah and
[1:26:37] you need to hold him to his promise
[1:26:39] until the change come is that right I
[1:26:42] think brother Keith gave me what about
[1:26:44] that era of deliverance amen how the era
[1:26:48] was scenting and everything else but he
[1:26:50] didn't strike the arrows I think it was
[1:26:51] a shoot the number of hours enough he
[1:26:54] didn't get the victory he only did it
[1:26:55] three times right when he could have
[1:26:57] gotten it seven times
[1:26:59] you could have bring it to a completion
[1:27:01] the thing is we don't strike it love we
[1:27:03] don't strike it enough we might pray one
[1:27:05] time and you don't get rid up our game
[1:27:07] if you don't get rid up our game you
[1:27:10] just keep praying amen it's striking
[1:27:13] that promise and then it took God
[1:27:14] fulfills it that's how you get it but I
[1:27:19] don't pray Oh
[1:27:20] hit it again keep hitting today meant
[1:27:24] until you see the manifestation of what
[1:27:27] God promised you ain't gonna be
[1:27:30] satisfied with singing and showering and
[1:27:32] jumping that's not why I'm here
[1:27:35] I'm here for the image of Christ I'm
[1:27:37] here to see his likeness in me I want to
[1:27:39] see every one of the versions of Christ
[1:27:41] and then manifested and reflected
[1:27:44] through this part about it you said how
[1:27:46] is gonna be that I don't know how but I
[1:27:48] keeps backing and it's backing an
[1:27:50] antagonist amen until God make it
[1:27:52] manifest I don't know what about
[1:27:56] everybody else but our problem is a
[1:27:58] heart condition
[1:27:59] we all have heart conditions here amen
[1:28:02] in the heart the soul lives in the heart
[1:28:07] hmm Emma and you believe him your heart
[1:28:11] hello this is the same prophet amen
[1:28:15] people don't get religion in their head
[1:28:17] by a book knowledge you get religion in
[1:28:20] the heart but an experience in the heart
[1:28:22] and the heart will always agree with the
[1:28:25] Bible but the hair will reason and the
[1:28:29] Bible says we've got to cast down
[1:28:30] reasoning you can't go with your mind
[1:28:34] the devil work in that you got to go
[1:28:36] with your heart
[1:28:37] so her mind would tell her not it is not
[1:28:41] reasonable if these women can do that
[1:28:43] why can't I
[1:28:45] talking about these sisters and that's
[1:28:46] what's happening to sisters right now
[1:28:48] they're called Christians they have good
[1:28:50] and standards in the church they're good
[1:28:53] standing in the community so why can't I
[1:28:56] I am a Christian like they are and if
[1:28:59] they can do that then it's reasonable
[1:29:01] and it's reasonable that I should do it
[1:29:04] cause I do one of them I don't see they
[1:29:08] think I see I'm old fogey see I I don't
[1:29:11] have to do nothing right I'm better than
[1:29:13] they are see see that's the reason if
[1:29:16] it'll get you in bad every time no
[1:29:20] matter what your intellect knowledge
[1:29:22] tell you don't you believe it
[1:29:24] if it's contrary to the Word of God take
[1:29:27] thus said the Lord first they write with
[1:29:30] that no matter and your soul will always
[1:29:32] agree with the word hmm like I said God
[1:29:37] dresses his army with the word right I'm
[1:29:41] almost done the battle is the Lord and
[1:29:45] the victory is ours he chose to mine and
[1:29:51] none of us can get out of it we can just
[1:29:56] ha I don't want the thoughts in my head
[1:29:58] I don't want still coming they still
[1:30:02] gonna come right oh I think I'm gonna
[1:30:05] sleep it off it's still gonna come they
[1:30:09] ain't nothin no way you're getting out
[1:30:11] of it the battle has been set in a ray
[1:30:13] and you got to take your sword and face
[1:30:16] it is that right why do you think this
[1:30:21] message God gave the Prophet the Kings
[1:30:23] sword and then he gave it to us and he
[1:30:27] says it takes a strong hand of faith to
[1:30:30] destroy the enemy hmm not no weak like
[1:30:36] strong strong hand of faith that means
[1:30:40] his influence and his power is coming at
[1:30:44] you in a strong way y'all know what I'm
[1:30:46] saying
[1:30:46] y'all know the battles are different
[1:30:48] they're stronger they're more in the
[1:30:52] influence the way of reasons he's made
[1:30:56] sense for the moment
[1:30:58] you got a step back I heard the song say
[1:31:01] step back and let God do it that's right
[1:31:04] every when you step back and let God do
[1:31:07] it then the word will come because the
[1:31:09] Bible said he will always bring things
[1:31:11] to your remembrance amen it is God as
[1:31:14] the Holy Ghost duty to bring the word to
[1:31:15] your remembers to fight the battle with
[1:31:21] who and when we we come to the place to
[1:31:31] realize that the battles in your mind is
[1:31:33] not they're not coming to entertain you
[1:31:36] they come to kill you the starts of
[1:31:42] Satan
[1:31:42] it received come to kill you it comes to
[1:31:46] steal kill and destroy that Stan so
[1:32:03] losing a little battle during the day is
[1:32:06] not just a little battle during the day
[1:32:09] it's a great battle and you must handle
[1:32:14] every battle as a great battle because
[1:32:17] every battle you win throughout the day
[1:32:20] takes you higher bills character bill
[1:32:25] strain and after a while Amen that
[1:32:28] devilish shake is his it I don't try
[1:32:30] there be anger I know I can't get next
[1:32:32] to him that's right therefore bow break
[1:32:37] his nose if you can break it I love the
[1:32:41] Lord and one thing I know and in all
[1:32:45] that God has done for me nobody can take
[1:32:49] it from me absolutely nobody and when it
[1:32:57] comes to this message I have studied it
[1:33:01] I may not be ingenious to quote it like
[1:33:05] some people but I know it because I know
[1:33:08] him
[1:33:09] have I ever made mistakes I've made
[1:33:11] mistakes but you'll never find me not
[1:33:14] correcting the mistakes of me but when
[1:33:17] it comes to this message see one thing
[1:33:20] about it we're having the Holy Ghost
[1:33:22] Godin gonna let you rest until you make
[1:33:23] things right and what I see spirits I
[1:33:29] see spirits and by God's grace even this
[1:33:34] morning I didn't want to look at the
[1:33:36] people because I felt such a mmm
[1:33:39] I tell you what there's a lot of people
[1:33:42] that needs deliverance in this place and
[1:33:45] you know what people are so proud and
[1:33:47] religious I believe the message you
[1:33:50] don't even believe it if you don't live
[1:33:52] it is that right not hearing acting lets
[1:33:58] believe when you hear and you act on the
[1:34:01] word that you've heard right but when
[1:34:04] you see a person I talking about being
[1:34:06] weak sometimes sometimes we get weak but
[1:34:08] when you see a person in persons you
[1:34:11] know I've been how can I said it it's so
[1:34:15] many situations I've had more situations
[1:34:18] in the last few years that I've had in
[1:34:20] the whole of Iowa Ohio and I want you to
[1:34:24] understand I see now there are people
[1:34:27] there are churches everywhere and people
[1:34:30] do not know Christ
[1:34:35] I've had people
[1:34:37] complain about me jumping I've had
[1:34:40] people clean about complain about me my
[1:34:44] singing you know you're too emotional
[1:34:46] and I've seen him crack down on people
[1:34:48] who blown who went to the same church
[1:34:50] they went up the yeah cam one time and
[1:34:54] said where do you go to church he said
[1:34:56] uh I believe is up there in Ohio I
[1:34:59] thought so you saying just like brother
[1:35:02] Brooks and I heard him I said hold up as
[1:35:04] he he got that he had that before he
[1:35:06] came to me
[1:35:07] don't blame that on me he got the Holy
[1:35:10] Ghost before he got came to me I don't
[1:35:14] want nobody to have my spirit but you're
[1:35:17] not gonna accuse me of giving somebody
[1:35:19] my spirit and me not say nothing I shook
[1:35:23] him up he got quiet no no no no no no
[1:35:27] even even at one time I was in South
[1:35:30] Africa and here I done travel with this
[1:35:32] this evangelist for years and and these
[1:35:35] people who I called him the board of
[1:35:37] bishops a man there in Durban supposed
[1:35:39] to believe this message but I've got to
[1:35:41] check with them before I come in there
[1:35:42] and I told him you idiot you tried to
[1:35:45] tell me this man wasn't a vengeance he
[1:35:47] ain't got no home Church and all kinds
[1:35:49] of stuff like that I said listen he out
[1:35:51] there doing the work and I said he and I
[1:35:53] know he goes in places you won't even go
[1:35:55] he'd go into Zulu land and everything
[1:35:56] else and tell y'all brothers are ones
[1:35:58] that conversions and everything else
[1:36:00] another they were afraid to go in there
[1:36:03] when they said that I said hold up I
[1:36:06] said there's a lot of you I said listen
[1:36:09] I don't know how many preachers young
[1:36:11] pastors I say you pay for my ticket and
[1:36:14] you can you can set my itinerary any way
[1:36:18] you want to I said but if I'm paying for
[1:36:20] my ticket you can't tell me where to go
[1:36:23] and where not to go
[1:36:23] I said but y'all can put y'all can get
[1:36:26] together buy me a ticket if you want I'm
[1:36:28] still waiting you know what I'm saying
[1:36:32] but people look at this and they think
[1:36:35] I'm weak I'm just so you know no no no I
[1:36:37] try my best not to say neither to the
[1:36:40] Holy Ghost telling me to say it but when
[1:36:42] a man stirred my righteous indignation I
[1:36:45] think sometime they gets shocked I
[1:36:47] didn't know he had him in what you're
[1:36:49] talking about I got Jesus
[1:36:52] Jesus ain't no wimp
[1:36:54] hallelujah here bring it right on out of
[1:36:57] me when I don't even want to say it
[1:36:58] he'll say it so I'm just saying people
[1:37:02] of God you know we you know I've done
[1:37:04] seen so I'm trying my best and I'm a
[1:37:07] tale like this I'm trusting that when I
[1:37:11] get there
[1:37:13] God will never none of you would ever
[1:37:16] have to have a have a saying that I
[1:37:18] didn't try to tell you that I didn't
[1:37:20] pull my heart with it out with the truth
[1:37:22] and I tried to stay as close to this
[1:37:23] message as I possibly could there's a
[1:37:26] time you know I thought Oh Lord how I'm
[1:37:28] gonna say two things brother Branham say
[1:37:29] you know he would call them Jezebel's
[1:37:31] and all that but you see if you're not
[1:37:33] if you better be under the right
[1:37:34] anointing just say that and when I say
[1:37:39] that you if God say say say it but if
[1:37:42] God don't say it you better not say it
[1:37:44] that's what I learned and I've learned
[1:37:47] I've seen people amen take people and
[1:37:49] whip them and say all kinds of things
[1:37:51] and they said well brother branham said
[1:37:53] it but brother Brenda was under the
[1:37:55] anointing for that moment to say what he
[1:37:58] said and yes he said the truth but you
[1:38:03] don't know whether that person in the
[1:38:04] audience is what need that oh how they
[1:38:08] can't explain it I just know what I'm
[1:38:09] talking about
[1:38:10] I know what I'm talking about I know
[1:38:13] what I'm talking about you love the Lord
[1:38:16] I don't know why I'm pouring my heart
[1:38:18] out like this but one thing I know for
[1:38:21] certain people we are blessed and I hope
[1:38:25] by God's grace not that I'm somebody I
[1:38:27] just hope God's grace you feel blessed
[1:38:30] to have me as a pastor because I feel
[1:38:32] blessed to have you as a people I brag
[1:38:34] on you and maybe I shouldn't cuz
[1:38:36] sometimes I get in trouble for that but
[1:38:37] at this point you haven't disappointed
[1:38:40] me and I hope and trust by God's grace I
[1:38:43] never disappoint you you understand me
[1:38:46] we we love the Lord you may be seated
[1:38:49] just for a moment
[1:38:50] just for a moment justice this is a
[1:38:51] little business here some of you know
[1:38:54] and I could have said this early this
[1:38:55] morning but I just wanted to and for the
[1:38:58] children's sake I'm not gonna call me
