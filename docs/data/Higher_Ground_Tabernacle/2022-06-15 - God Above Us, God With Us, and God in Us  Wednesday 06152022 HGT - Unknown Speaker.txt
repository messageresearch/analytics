you stand with us and turn with the scriptures please god is good to us i must always say that because he is we ask that you turn with us to second corinthians the second chapter 14th verse we try our heart our best to work together in the holy spirit by god's grace we try our best to leave ourselves out so that god will always get the glory that's why we sing that song you deserve it god is always good to us and in spite of it all he's the head of all of our lives as we turn to that scripture ii corinthians 2 14 we also would then we'll ask you to turn with us to second corinthians the first chapter and then we'll read the third and the fourth verse now thanks be unto god which always causes us to triumph in christ and maketh manifest the savior of his knowledge by us in every place i'm going to read that again thank now thanks be unto god which always causes us to triumph in christ not in ourselves in christ and maketh manifest the savior of his knowledge by us in every place ii corinthians i'm gonna read just a different version on this because uh so it'll be a little different from what the way it's written in your word but i really want you to follow that let's just read there first thanks that's not it the first chapter three through four second corinthians i'll read it blessed be the god and father by lord jesus christ the father of mercies and the god of all comfort he comforts us in all our afflictions so that we may be able to comfort those who are in any kind of affliction through the comfort we ourselves receive from god but let's read it as in the king james be blessed be god even the father of our lord jesus christ the father of mercy and the god of all comfort i like that who comforted us in all our tribulation that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of god let us pray our heavenly father we thank you for your grace and your mercy we thank you for being so good to us lord we thank you father for your blood that cleansing power that cleanses us from all unrighteousness and we thank you for your amazing grace lord because it's your grace that we're able to stand here uh this evening we thank you for those who have come out uh to hear the word of god i pray father god that it would be a blessing to each and every hearer that when they leave here there will also be a doer give us grace in your lovely name jesus christ as we worship you in this house amen you may be seated i entitled this message still tying in with the godhead but i wanted to give it a little difference and i titled it god above us god with us and god in us many people are looking for the former and the latter rain and they fail to see that the forward and that rain has come the teaching reigns has come through the prophet of malachi 4 and the reign of god has come to bring us to maturity even in the message the uncertain sound brother branham says thou art here today you're here for the closing hour for even greater blessings for the former and latter reign should come together and when we look at this we understand that there got to be a greater power a greater anointing a greater manifestation now understand this it will not be a lot of people as we know it will be a small group of people those who can as we said last week not only hear the word but understand your position where you're standing in this message we know by god's grace that all our comforts come from god uh the anointing of god is what it has always been we found out that even adam and eve was just mere men mere flesh without the anointing of god they were able to die they were able to feel pain they were able to get sick they were able to do all of these things because the glory of god had separated itself himself from them now we know by god's grace that the bible tells us that the letter killeth but the spirit of god gives life the spirit of god is what we call the holy ghost it is the one that gives us life it is it's the only true and living god but one thing i fail i see that uh you know the the the experience that i had uh and like i said it was personally my dream and i told it as a dream but in this i saw the explosion or the unveiling of god in such a way i had never seen it before and i saw things that were being created things that were moving by the way of waves and rainbow colors and things of that nature and it had no ending um i just knew and i couldn't explain it i still cannot explain it but i saw how one word of god one word and this is what why jesus said even to his disciples if you say to this mountain be thou move the mountain has to move now understand you this is not human effort this is not a natural man in his natural mind trying to make a mountain move but this is god in the man that has the capacity and the capability to make the mountain move so we know we can't do nothing without him is that right but the bible says that he is the branch and we're the vine and of course the vine can't do nothing without the branch so you know you know you and i understand that if if that be true then we need we need to do something about our condition i believe with all my heart that we're living in the last days and i believe that we don't have much time left even though it seems like things are going so called well and like nothing is going to happen but one thing i know for certain that you and i can stand and see prophecy being fulfilled amen by modern events and we cannot deny if that be true then that means everything else that has been spoken is true and i don't think people get it i don't think we get we're getting what this thing means to us listen how terrible it will be knowing that we have heard this message and have been able to embrace brace it even if it was just intellectual think about all of the joy and and things that it has brought to us but even paul said you can understand all mysteries but without love it profits nothing and my my thought is who's pressing who's moving forward uh into this divine love that god has now brought down to us amen to to be partakers of we call it the divine nature according to peter because we run understand that god is a manifold he's manifold he's manifold even in his wisdom and you and i must understand that the natural man cannot comprehend what god is doing so in order for us to understand him we must be born again we must have the anointing of god on the inside of us to understand what is actually happening now because you say well wait wait wait a minute brother let me tell you something there were so many people that was with william branham when he was here as as a malachi 4 messenger and they still didn't get it they still didn't understand what he was saying because many of them did not have the holy ghost like he said without it you can't understand it not even see the kingdom of god second corinthians 3 2-5 says ye are epistles written in our heart known and read of all men for as much as ye are manifestly declared to be the epistles of christ now understand that statement manifestly declared that means i can see it it's not something i have to strain at a strain with it's visible that there has been a change in you and when i see you i see the word expressed basically that's what paul was saying written not with ink but with the spirit of the living god not in tables of stone but in fleshly tables of the heart and such trust have we through christ to godward not that we are sufficient here it is of ourselves to think anything as of ourselves but our sufficiency is of god can i say it like this our sufficiency is of the holy ghost listen we must understand that every step we make every every move we make every whatever we got to understand that it is god who's leading he's above all he's through all he's in all he's everywhere he knows everything right there is nothing that catches god by surprise and so we're moving by the anointing of god some of us have heard the story of the little possum that was very sick perhaps got bitten by a dog or whatever but this possum amen comes along and he moves down on the prophet street skipping four houses coming to the fifth now you know the possum can't count but somehow through the leadership of god he brought him to the fifth house which was the letter of faith f-a-i-t-h-h and and of course jesus right and here was the prophet of god amen concern about this prophet this opossum because it had little babies i'm gonna hurry up but my point is here was a brute beast a little animal that was able to be led by god and had a revelation that this man could heal her she only not only did she have the revelation or the understanding i don't understand it but one thing for certain when the prophet of god prayed for her she was near death right he said when when god rebuked him says listen you talked about that woman who was ill-famed and did did bring her baby to a death and and you called her a bad name you said she wasn't a real mother and yet you bragged on the possum but you wouldn't even pray for it now how simple that is but to the natural mind why would you pray for a possum but god comes along and rebukes himself but she's been like a lady and she's waiting on her turn to be prayed for i know this sound fatigue fictitious but it's a reality it happened he prayed for her and he said when he prayed for her and then this little opossum gathered up her babies and walked across the street looked back to say thank you sir even the opossum you know had manners and respect for the living god yet and still we find people that come to church they come to church on religious basis and not by a way of experience and so they disrespect god because they don't have god in them to know how how to respect him this is not a way of law this is a way of grace and understand grace brings you to the place to do what god wants you to do god doesn't expel you know the right things from you know the right things has been given to you and grace give you the ability to do the right things shall we continue in sin that grace may abound he said god forbid first corinth now excuse me colossians 1 uh i'm sorry first option colossians 1 27-29 says god wanted to make known among the gentiles the glorious wealth of this mystery which is christ in you the hope of glory and we're looking with we're saying christ in us christ in us but where is the glory where is the display where is the manifestation of god in you i'm talking to everybody in here these signs shall follow them that believe it is true and you ought to have some kind of experience amen not 10 years ago but some kind of experience that you could say oh he did this for me every day is a praise we proclaim him warning and teaching everyone with all wisdom so that we may present everyone mature in christ he said i labor for this striving with the strength that works powerfully in me paul says listen the only way i can do it i labor to see the saints of god come to maturity that's what i'm doing i'm laboring to see that this church come to maturity but listen you gotta want it you gotta wanna grow up it has to be your will not mine god's will in you will will you to do it listen and and i look at these things and i says god of the christ in you we got to see him we can't hardly see him in worship when i say that we come to church and you know how people do they they so listen they're not even anointed not with god anyway they come into church and they just dead no anointing haven't prayed they come in and you know they sit like they're in a classroom or worse and then they expect god to answer prayer enter his courts with thanksgiving into his gates with praise if you don't come that way you've got the wrong protocol and that sounds like a rebuke and i'm hoping that this will reach some who are not here listen love conquers all he didn't say that for nothing and i'm not talking about filio love i'm talking about agape love and when we don't listen and we don't grasp god when we don't how can i say it enter into his worship you say well what do you mean that woman that came to simon house wasn't even invited to come she came to simon's house saw jesus over there when nobody else was worshiping him she came and she worshipped she didn't even have to ask him for anything you don't understand many people don't understand the power of worship the bible said that god himself inhabits the praise of his people that's why you don't have the joy that's why you don't have the peace that's why you don't rest because you're not coming to him in the right way and the reason being is that so many people have this intellectual understanding of god and they've never gotten it down here have mercy on us lord that's what i'm targeting not your mind amen your heart what's in your heart love conquers everything john 4 21 23 says jesus said unto her woman believe me the hour cometh when ye shall neither in this mountain nor yet at jerusalem worship the father in other words we're doing away with all the denominations and organizations and all that stuff all the isms and schism you're not gonna worship there that's not where you worship god in this hour it ain't oh i come to church i come to higher ground that's not where you worship you worship him in spirit and truth where in the house of god this is where worship comes from and when the worship is all right it's going good on the inside it explodes to the outside listen people you don't have to tell people you're a christian when you got worship going on they can see and feel the vibrations jesus said unto her woman believeth me the hour cometh when you should neither in this mountain nor yet at jerusalem worship the father ye worship ye worship ye know not what we know what we worship for our for salvation is of the jews and brother and then he goes on to say but the hour cometh and now i'll say that and now is with the true worship person listen to what he's saying the true worshipers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seek is such to worship him now i understand that look that spirit is is a lower case but he's not talking about human spirit he's talking about holy spirit that's the only way you can worship god is by and through the power of the holy spirit but what we fail to see is a christian and i i i look at this thing and i says no matter how much you cry out no matter how much you plea it's just like in the days of noah only eight souls were saved and you know uh you know enoch was the only one of his age and and the bible said as it was in that day so shall it be and yet we we we as preachers we have this hope and this expectation that we're going to have a church full of bride people ready and you know ah just it's gonna be that it ain't it's not even in this assembly it's gonna be a few i don't know who they are but i'm sure they know the uncertainty brethren preached a message the uncertain sound he said the principle of christianity is the condition of the heart towards god and that's the thing that we like to concentrate on is to know a brother not by the church he belongs to or how he wear his clothes but what he is in his heart hello somebody and you and i must understand that we have a duty and that duty is to kill yourself every day i'm not talking about physically killing yourself or some kind of suicidal thing i have to make sure i explain that especially with somebody on the youtube that said that man preaching suicide you know and you must understand we're not talking about natural death we're talking about spiritual dying to yourself being put to death all day long that's what paul said he said we're counting the sheep for the slaughter is that right he said and we suffer throughout the day all day long but then again he says who shall separate us from the love of christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness apparel or sword as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter and i don't know why everybody feel like in this age we're supposed to be always hallelujah in it hey you got to understand you got to suffer if you read in the church age when jesus says i have seen your patience he's not like talking about patience and waiting on the bus or patience and waiting on the plane he says i see your patience in your suffering because you have suffered and suffered and suffered and i haven't delivered you yet but your patience says i'm going to wait on god and i'm going to wait for god and all of that suffering like job said i know my change is coming see that's the kind of patient god wants oh god hurry up hurry up no we all feel like that sometime but that's not god god is molding us and making us he's a perfectionist he takes his time to deliver us he takes his time to make us and guess what he makes no mistakes he makes none not one and you and i you and i we are his masterpieces when nobody else can see the life in us he sees it paul says for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are counting the sheep for the slaughter let me tell y'all something especially you young people if you really get on the board if you really get in your heart and mind i'm gonna serve god with all my heart you'll find out that you'll be one in a million amongst your own because i've had people who supposed to be christian of the same faith say you know what you just too religious you know there was a time in my life you know when i used to sneeze i said lord excuse me and you know what i i missed those times but i was rebuked and i allowed those people to stop me and i realized now they were wrong listen he says nay and all these things we are more than conquerors through him that love us and i'm going to get something here tonight because i want you to understand there is a line that people can cross and can't come back over may god have mercy on us with all grace great it is grace but when god can't get you to move by grace he brings the law paul said i am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities not power nor things present nor things to come why is he saying that paul is not saying my ability is going to get me there no paul is saying because i have god on the inside nothing can separate me why because jesus said i'll never leave you nor will i forsake you i will always be with you that's the reason why that's the reason why is because once you unite with christ nothing can stop you no grave no devil no demon no trial nothing can stop you listen in all the years that i've been saved in a christian i have never had a desire to turn back on god ever it never came to my mind because once you get that experience that real experience it doesn't come you falter you come short you stumble you fall but you never think about leaving him where would you go anyway ain't nobody gonna love you like jesus i'm telling you i mean he could be a millionaire she could be a millionaire she'll never love you like jesus you and i must understand we're not we have not we've not been ordained to be hypocrites huh you say what is a hypocrite a hypocrite is a person who puts on false appearances of virtue or religion and god knows we've got a lot of it listen what brother adam said he said god never made you just to work and come home and love your children that's all good enough god made you to work god made you to come home love your children love your wife love your wife to be loyal and love her husband the children love their fathers and mothers that's all good but god made you that's just a background for something that god made you to do god made you to be a worshiper somebody missing that one god made you to be a worshiper a worshiper of him he said you'll worship something regardless of what it is you'll worship your wife your worship your children your worship anything your automobile your worship pleasure you'll worship something because it's a mankind it's in mankind to worship now we want to know what we worship what are you worshiping tonight you need to examine yourself to see where you're standing your revelation what are you worshiping the greatest way to worship god is to be in his image second corinthians 1 20 says for every one of god's promises is yes in him therefore through him we also say amen to the glory of god now it is god who strengthens us together with you in christ and who has anoin this is what i was saying to the church the other day we need you god needs you and we think where did they hear it did they understand the bible said we're united together we're we're living stones fitted together and when people are missing it literally weakens the body and gives satan right to do what he needs to do don't tell me people with the holy ghost is not being led to come to church when god said through the prophet that you know a true born again believer can't hardly wait to those doors are open what's wrong with the people it's a lack of conversion lord help us they may have him here but we need him here this is the throne room of god this is the throne room of god jesus said to the pharisees he says why are you hypocrites how can you speak good and here i'm coming when they uh was called calling him good master and so forth you know how people do oh god bless you brother brother we appreciate you being our pastor oh you just and in their minds they're thinking something else not everybody but you know some people it's just religious you love the lord out of the abundance of the heart speaketh the lips and in your heart you hate me he says and in in your lips you call me good master he says and you hypocrites that's what jesus said in your heart he knew those that hated him and yet they're calling him good master in that in that something you can tell the way people look at you sometimes especially in service sometimes they look at you like they could kill you they don't even know that the spirit that's whatever working in them is expressing itself on their faces that's real listen what he says see your soul is thinking one thing and you're speaking with your lips another thing what a case what a hypocrite a horrible thing he says what a deceitful thing is a hypocrite for out of their mind they say one thing and when their souls say another thing oh he's coming down to something let me tell you something every hypocritical move we make everything we do wrong excuse me if it doesn't if we don't make it right guess what's going to happen at the end of the day it's going to catch up with you i got a quote here in just a moment what am i trying to do stir up the minds we were just talking the other day about that young couple amen in in ohio that just got married and and then the house exploded and they didn't go to bed thinking we're gonna die tonight we don't know we have no idea when god is going to call that number but guess what if you're not right when you fall you won't be right because however the tree falls that's how it lays the target is getting the soul converted you know it's good i love the shouting i love the dancing and you know that's the thing that made me say something is wrong when i was in the apostolic church i spoke in tongues i prophesied i interpreted i all those kind of gifts was with me but i saw myself getting weak i had visions or whatever you call them but i found out i said no something's not right i did not have the word that can go into the holies of holies my flesh was anointed my spirit was anointed so much so that god could use me in that realm but i knew that this heart had not yet been converted because when it's not converted you'll do things that god will allow you to do to show you it's not right yet and we'll look over that thing you cannot look over it god is trying to share tell you something but everybody in the message you know people the things that people do i say message i shouldn't just say that because it's everywhere or among the christians they smoke they drink they lie they do reefer they do drugs they do all of these things and they still think that they're saved what are you thirsting for what's in there is thirsting for the world the bible says love not the world nor the things that are in the world for the things that are in the world is the lust of the flesh the lust of the eye and the pride of life i'm not trying to be hard young people by saying god i'm trying to get you to look deep down and says oh god if i don't have it i need it i want it you know i want this change that i hear the prophet of god tells talks about that's what i want we're all striving to for for perfection but the target is to get your soul converted you say well what do you mean peter says lord i will not deny you let me tell you something if your soul is not converted you will deny him you would be ashamed of him when your soul is not converted people said lord you know my heart i wouldn't do this jesus said yes you will before the croc the crow three times you're gonna deny me but this is the good news peter when you are converted strengthen your brother the position of christ in your heart guarantees you fellowship with nobody else with fellowship with you he will when you think you are all alone which you'll never alone he's there he's your protector he's your guider he guides you he leads you he's your your comforter i read that he's the one that's comforting you it may even come from another brother or sister but it still boils down to god comforting you i'll never leave you nor forsake you see he says listen now in uncertain sound this person what if you could ever get this soul on the inside so in harmony with god that your soul and god would be one together then you could ask what you will and it shall be given to you and see that's the problem with most of us christians we're trying to work the word with an intellectual understanding of it that's why we're failing those ignorant people down in in in in in uh with when you say isuzu street didn't have the ability to read but they knew they had how to get god and they did exploits and here come a man with a seventh grade education didn't know how to pray but he knew how to call on god he knew how to get sincere and when he got sincere and called on god god came down we must say no to every reasoning that is against the word of god y'all hear what i'm trying to say the christ in you that's why he said it like that christ in you the hope of glory many people come to me many times in the prayer line and stand there and say oh brother branham i have plenty faith i got faith like to move mountains and yet they haven't any faith he didn't say some i'm not even a little bit he said not any they hardly have enough faith to get to the platform but they are conscious of one thing that they do believe they are believing intellectually with their mind and their mind will never bring them to god let me read that again they are believing intellectually with their mind and their mind will never bring them to god your mind is reasoning and god has no reasoning and if you can reason it out your mind will tell you now look here the doctor says i can't get over that it's impossible now the doctor with this little intellect with his intelligence with this knowledge and of medicine science he has told you the best of the travel of his mind and it take and you take it in your mind and using the same thing the doctor has told you god can't never touch that line as long as you reason but let put down reasoning god never made us to live by our intellect we live by the holy spirit that's in our soul that says no to any reasoning that's contrary to god's word help us jesus is this okay now we must understand that we ourselves in and i'm saying this because i've been in the message for a long time some of you were born and raised in the message i've come through the the shout the dance the you heard me say this the other day but you know when you get to a place you just get fed up and says where's the change with all of this i had a brother say to me well you know brother adam said that we'll be slugging along until the last one comes in and that's true that's true but if you are slugging make sure you got the holy ghost while you slug you don't want to be moving slow and ain't got it because the vision said don't you listen when the vision has been made plain let him that readeth run stefan's had so stephen had so much of that blessing in him said when they were stoning stephen he said oh he had so much blessing in him so much of the hidden power till stephen become another person looked up and seen jesus standing at the right hand of god and never seen a felt a clock when it it born uh born him in the head listen isn't that maybe he said he didn't feel a thing not one brick he didn't feel it he said that can't be true it is true those who were thrown in the fiery furnace they didn't feel it it was so hot it killed the men who threw them in there and yet they come out of all of that and the bible says not even the smell of smoke was on them my god is god our god is god and we've got to realize that this word is dynamite it explodes it's not just a on the pages but the only way we'll be able to see it and be partake of it we must have the holy spirit on the inside that's the only way it's going to work for you because that's the power of the word it is the holy ghost that quickens the word think about it people we can't hardly stand for people to talk about us more or less stone us and brother brother said the true christian don't fight back he said i could see stephen there he knelt down his enemy spitting on him and everything else and clotting him and he raised up and looked up to heaven and he said father lay not this sin to their charge i forgive them father see that's the holy ghost we've got to have today that kind that can forgive now i'm going to go ahead on because i know i'm taking a lot a little longer than i wanted to but the thing he said that stephen was so wrapped up in god and god was so wrapped up in him the bible never said that stephen died he said he fell asleep and brother adam said god rocked rocked stephen asleep in his bosom in his arm can you see you say well brothers what are you saying that's the same thing that happened to john when they threw him in that oil john didn't wasn't kicking and hauling and screaming no that all that burning all didn't hurt him and they got so frustrated they didn't know what to do they tried everything they could do to kill him and couldn't kill him that's the bride satan has tried everything to kill her but he cannot kill her she's ordained to live hallelujah christ in you the hope of glory i i just get you know maybe i'm losing my mind and i'm trusting that i am so i could have his and you know i'm looking at this thing and i says you know what lord it's got to come this simple because when it come and you try to bring deep things to people you know they're wondering where you're getting it from well let me say it like this if god is anointing it and the word is true it must come from him because the bible says that the bible is uh of no private interpretation and i said like this you know you you take william branham who was our prophet he read other people's books he got a lot of things from other people but god vindicated that what he got was right see what people don't understand that's why they say well he he he played no he didn't pleasurize nothing that's like telling jesus how can you do you you go out there and you eat that corn that ain't in your field but listen the corn is god's everything is god's you have a right to it think about it and i'm almost done with this little portion but peter and john they were poor they had nothing and i could read all of this they didn't even belong to a church brotherhood said they didn't have any education they didn't belong to a denomination there was no uncertainty about their experience they had no positive uh they didn't have money they didn't have membership they didn't have education but peter says such as i have give it to you in the name of jesus christ rise up in war they had a hidden power and that's what we must have you and i won't go it has to be there on the inside not because you know we can quote the message and quote scripture and be uh articulate and that has nothing to do with it and god made sure he could have chose paul to preach on the day of pentecost but he didn't he chose peter a hard-headed jew who had a problem with his temper and by the baptism of the holy ghost he resolved it dissolved it however you want to say it peter stood up there with no fear and preached the gospel of jesus christ it ain't money it ain't none of that it's what's in your heart you know every time i say that i think about that commercial what's in your wallet purchasing power that's what it's all about that's what's in my wallet purchasing power that's what's in my heart purchasing power that's what must be in your heart i told the lord the day i says god you know i do not want to be a hypocrite i'd rather be just a rank center than to be a hypocrite in all the hypocritical ways that i've had in the past please take them away undo everything that i've done covered by your blood lord jesus give me a fresh start make me more real than i've ever been before i told the lord and i'm gonna tell you something folks when i come to church i don't i don't put on i enjoy jesus i enjoy i tell the lord i enjoy being a christian some people look at me and some i look over to some people but not to all people you know but when they tell me man you look younger than that i always contributed to god because god kept me out of the clubs he kept me off the drugs he kept me off all that stuff that beats you up and make you look old older i can walk i can run i'm not humped over you know what i'm saying y'all do y'all understand me the other day sunday i guess the stress was so immense or intense it was suddenly was a stressful day sunday was when i woke up that morning my eye was all bloodshot and red bruised another vessel had broken in my i asked the lord to forgive me i said god i didn't understand that the service had had me so wound up but i dealt with a lot of spirits on sunday people said it was a good service it was because god came through anyway but i know that there's a weakness in but i told the lord i said you know what god i said you know what at least i can still see i would care less if they both were red as long as i could still see it ain't the beauty of the eyes paul dealt with something that he couldn't get rid of brother branham had an affliction almost all of his days praying for the sick and yet he was sick himself see whatever it takes to bring me to perfection to bring me to the manifestation of what's now living in me so let it be but people don't understand the stress because you know the thing is every true preacher tries to save his congregation and that's impossible because only god can save you love the lord i thought the service was going to go a different way but since it's going this way we're just going to finish it out in just a minute we're not going to keep you too much longer it's now 8 30 so just give me a few more minutes with all of the reasoning power talk about this woman who was a christian but she was led astray and when she was led astray she stopped saying or listening to the voice of god always listen to the barking of the dog because that's the person you know we're not talking the holy spirit is a dog but god always tell you no when he knows you're not supposed to be doing it with all of this reasoning power she had she had gone to church she had given to charity she's done everything that's right she thinks so everything that's right in her mind she has followed the addict the dictates of her mind i know i should go to church i know i should be friendly i know i should treat all my neighbors right i know i should do this and that but still what it what is it she had grieved away this fellowship and then in the hour of her death when she gets ready to die and what happened this lady left her husband married another man and and all that kind of stuff she really went out there and because the church was doing it she was doing it isn't that funny that's the way it works so-and-so can do it i can do it too that's foolishness foolishness and then the hour of death when she gets ready to die she is laying on the bed and all at once she wakes up and hollers oh my god i'm lost the pastor will say give her a hypo she's delirious and here's he shoots him with a hypo in it and she tried to speak she can't speak she's murmur what is it her soul has caught up with her before death not only not only women but men also who spurn the love of jesus christ who has turned him down made fun of it it'll catch up with you someday as certain as i'm standing here this morning you'll grieve it so far till you can't feel it no more but it'll catch you sometime again isn't that funny we don't want it see what is he saying he said you can just so grieve him amen until you won't even feel him no more now i'm not talking about those people who he's not who's making the makeup is not feelings some people just can't feel like others but those of you who have felt him do you still feel him and if you're not feeling him the way you used to feel him then there's something wrong with you it's not god i don't believe nobody in here has grieved him away i don't but i'm sharing these things so that you'll know that it is possible for that to happen it'll all come back to you the dirty things the bad things the tattling the the babbling the bite biting the selfishness and things that you've done that's all come back to you someday laying on your death bed and i'm closing this the reason why i'm saying these things is because people it's real this message is real christ in you the hope of glory now i skipped a lot of things but i i i just wanted to kind of throw this out i'll be preaching on sunday and so i don't know where god is going to take me there but if we don't if we can't even we can't even get people to repent no more i can't do it you know what brother man said no matter how the preacher preached he cannot lead anybody to the lord he said it takes the anointing it takes christ to lead people to the lord he can't do it i can't do it we can preach the word that's all we can do but a man woman has to want him in their heart and i say it like this it has to become a place where you're desperate he said well brother books how do i get desperate ask him he knows how to make you desperate he knows how to bring you the bible said that he will not all that the father has given me will come let's stand understand that every good thing that we ever achieve in this life is because the holy spirit has led us through it no big eyes no big use or anything of that nature we all fall short of the glory of god and we must all understand by god's grace that what makes this a salvation so great and and you know i'm i'm working with the expression the feelings and all of these things but we also also know that when god comes into the soul i know you've had maybe you didn't feel a thunderbolt but sometimes it comes in like a like a little warm fuzzy type spirit sometimes you you know things happen on your arm or head or that's god [Music] sometimes he'll do things i've seen god flicker a light just to let you know he was in the presence he does things differently for everybody but one thing for certain when he comes in he brings a change this is what we look at not human effort we look have it been a change is there a change in your life and if it has been it will be a change that moved you forward into christ into his word [Music] knowing amen that your whole desire and your whole will is to do the perfect will of god [Music] thank you father for your grace let's bound the word of prayer our dear heavenly father we so thank you we thank you for your amazing grace we thank you for the election and the power of this message that you brought to us in this hour there's no uncertain sound that stands in my soul today your word is amen your promises are abandoned it's not if would you could you you said you would and we thank you lord jesus for your word and and even as job said we're just going to wait to our change come but in the meantime as we waiting we're just going to continue to lay in the presence of your son we're going to eat of this bloody bleeding word we're going to take it and know when while eating it is going to transform us not some human effort but you lord you the worker you're the builder you're the maker you're the only one that could add to our statue lord we are your masterpiece continue to mold and make us what we lack we pray father god that you give us wisdom to find out how to fix things and because we come to live and to worship you this is what it's all about now how famous and how great and how rich whatever it may be i know lord jesus this this message is real it's a hundred percent right but boy oh lord help us lord help us to do right help us to submit to ourselves and even as we read help us die daily granted dear jesus in your lovely name we pray amen [Music]
