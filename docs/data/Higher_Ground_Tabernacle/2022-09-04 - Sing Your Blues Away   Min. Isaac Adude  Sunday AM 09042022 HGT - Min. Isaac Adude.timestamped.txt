[0:00] dear father god because we have needs
[0:02] that's going
[0:03] on hello we are here father god because
[0:05] we have questions
[0:08] though we came here father god because
[0:09] we wanted a fellowship with you
[0:13] hello we came here because we wanted to
[0:15] hear from you
[0:16] so that's why we pray oh father god that
[0:18] you take us out of the way lord could
[0:20] you remember your man lord and you speak
[0:22] to your people
[0:24] lord we pray father that you bless the
[0:26] heart so father we hear the
[0:28] word the goddess
[0:30] let us make let us put it in practice
[0:34] lord i pray father that you help me to
[0:36] be so sensible to the holy spirit
[0:40] so that i can only say what you want me
[0:42] to say
[0:53] amen the first two chapters of numbers
[0:57] what we've read
[1:01] amen you will see that in chapter 11
[1:03] people complain
[1:07] and the word destroyed
[1:09] and chapter 21
[1:13] you'll see that people spoke against
[1:15] moses and against god
[1:18] and the same thing happened with him
[1:21] by here and now here paul says you see
[1:25] baldi it meant that those things happen
[1:28] to us this shows no evil to be they
[1:31] don't think those things happen so that
[1:32] it can be a warning to us
[1:37] if we do the same thing
[1:40] we might have the same result
[1:44] but god is so merciful
[1:47] yeah he doesn't give us a trial that we
[1:49] can't we can't overcome you don't
[1:52] improve
[2:22] because it happens that sometimes you
[2:24] said before was it priest sometimes
[2:26] things don't go as plain
[2:30] sometimes it feels like a man you you
[2:32] are like in the box and you don't know
[2:34] where to go
[2:38] there are troubles on your left troubles
[2:40] on your right
[2:42] troubles in front of you and troubles
[2:43] behind you
[2:45] and you just don't know what to do
[2:48] and as a
[3:19] is the expression of dissatisfaction
[3:22] expression the
[3:25] dissatisfaction he meant to complain
[3:29] it means that you're not satisfied with
[3:31] the thing that's going on
[3:36] amen and if we bring it to uh the
[3:38] thought of this morning
[3:41] you're meant to complain
[3:43] it means that you're not satisfied with
[3:45] what god is giving you
[3:50] you're meant to complain
[3:52] about the meaning of god god is making a
[3:54] mistake somewhere
[3:57] because when we got through tribals
[4:00] when we got through trials
[4:03] god knows exactly what we're going
[4:05] through
[4:06] exactly
[4:07] god sees us he knows exactly what you
[4:10] what you're going through
[4:26] i mean i'm not satisfied with the way
[4:28] you treating me
[4:31] it meant by everything that happens to
[4:32] us
[4:34] for a reason
[4:36] amen the bible says in revelation
[4:40] you have to overcome who would be
[4:42] vancouver you meant to beat with him
[4:45] let me try to find it uh
[4:48] if i can find it
[4:50] i think
[4:56] if at the end of every age is ah
[5:01] amen um
[5:07] let's let's even take a revelation
[5:09] chapter two we read uh verse seven
[5:11] apocalypse versus set amen the bible
[5:14] says that he
[5:15] that has here
[5:18] let him hear what the spirit saith unto
[5:20] the churches
[5:23] to him that overcomers as luke ivanka
[5:26] will i give to it with the tree of life
[5:31] which is in the midst of the paradise of
[5:33] god
[5:35] to him that overcome it
[6:18] all those kings i would convert you to
[6:20] syria a man on his way back this is
[6:22] instrumental
[6:24] they came in and came to came to meet
[6:26] him make you see that give me your honor
[6:28] they came to meet him
[6:30] the bible says that he gave him the
[6:32] communion
[6:44] abraham a part of himself
[7:28] but we don't want to wait until god
[7:30] answers those prayers
[7:35] for example lord let this uh uh when
[7:38] i'll say this son and this sign let that
[7:40] means that i can go and and you you want
[7:42] me to go
[7:57] to fulfill to be fulfilled
[8:00] you go and you make a choice
[8:03] and then after that you change your
[8:04] prayers yeah
[8:06] you'll be like lord if it's not your
[8:08] will don't let this work
[8:39] is it true this they that wait upon the
[8:41] lord shall renew their strengths
[8:45] they shall mount it up with wings
[9:06] teach
[9:21] all the bridges around let's go to
[9:24] the point
[9:25] and say now lower nothing in my arms or
[9:28] bring this
[9:31] i simply to uh simply to the cross
[11:11] god is not here listening to your
[11:13] prayers anymore
[11:15] um
[11:19] it feels like god is silent
[11:23] in austria amen you praying but there is
[11:24] no feedback
[11:54] even though it
[12:13] and see what kind of reaction what kind
[12:14] of reaction he will find in him
[12:18] the reaction
[12:20] but when he took his sheep and took his
[12:22] ass
[12:26] and took his camels and took his
[12:28] children
[12:31] i'll see what job says now
[12:35] and he said the lord gave and job said
[12:37] the lord gave and the lord taken away
[12:39] blessed be the name of the lord
[12:45] he found what he had told satan he had
[12:48] in jeopardy
[13:03] the spirit come upon the prophet and he
[13:06] screamed this let's pray evidence of the
[13:08] prophet
[13:09] i know my redeemer
[13:11] and at the last days he'll stand on the
[13:14] earth
[13:16] though the skin warns uh destroys this
[13:19] body yet in my flesh i shall seek god
[13:27] whom i shall see for myself
[13:30] shall behold and not uh
[13:40] he meant to wait and see what he had
[13:42] told the devil if it is still true
[13:45] see the
[13:46] videos
[13:48] meaning that every time that the triumph
[13:50] every time that you go through a hard
[13:52] times or a trial yes
[13:56] before the trials god tell the devil god
[13:58] tells the devil about you
[14:08] that he is able to overcome this trial
[14:13] that he is faithful when he trusts me
[14:18] so he gives him a way to come and tempt
[14:20] you
[14:21] you are called that permission so god
[14:22] will be there aside and waiting and to
[14:24] see if the sin report ahead in you if it
[14:27] is still the same
[14:39] him and he teaches his students about
[14:41] about something
[14:47] the teacher will be there waiting that
[14:49] the cheater that his student would do
[14:51] the same thing as you told them
[15:01] all the instructors i mean i tell i i
[15:04] told this this uh this lesson before and
[15:06] i i explained to them everything
[15:11] so i'm not too worried about my children
[15:13] because i know that they will pass this
[15:15] test
[15:18] but when those children pass the test
[15:23] the teacher will be so proud and will go
[15:25] tell other teachers you know i told you
[15:27] that they would do it
[15:32] that is the same way that god feels when
[15:34] we when we overcome
[15:36] you
[15:38] that is the same way that god feels when
[15:40] we pass all our trials all our tests
[15:45] like an engineer as an engineer
[15:49] yeah when you have a project
[15:51] for example you want to build something
[15:55] let's say for example an uh uh an engine
[15:58] or or or a house or whatever example
[16:02] let's say for example
[16:03] uh uh a martyr of something
[16:06] example
[16:22] has to make those prototypes and test
[16:24] them
[16:27] to make sure that what he's putting out
[16:29] there is the same i mean he's a real
[16:31] deal
[16:35] what people will buy people will buy
[16:37] people what i would tell the people
[16:40] that's what they would be buying
[16:43] if an engineer has to make as to go you
[16:46] know put
[16:47] his project through you know tests
[16:52] and then he has to test you know
[16:53] different different test frictions and
[16:55] all those kinds of tests
[16:59] that's the same thing with god see the
[17:00] members
[17:01] amen the god tries you
[17:04] may god test you it will
[17:06] amen to make sure that you are the real
[17:08] children of god
[17:11] to make sure that there will be nothing
[17:13] that will come and then we take you away
[17:45] what are almonds
[17:46] there will be no doubts that will come
[17:48] and take that away from you
[17:52] amen god trust you jews
[17:54] every son that cometh to god must first
[17:56] be tried shakthis given
[18:12] if we walk up and say i believe that
[18:14] jesus christ is the son of god
[18:20] he died for my sins and and rose again
[18:22] the third day
[18:26] that
[18:54] and your abilities and all that you have
[18:56] capacity
[18:58] you lay that on the altar
[19:02] that with nothing in your arms
[19:06] the prophet said that satan
[19:08] satan is going to shoot every dart
[19:11] at you he can as you can
[19:14] see
[19:17] but then if you turn aside from there
[19:19] and say
[19:22] well
[19:36] i'm sorry the bible said that you are
[19:37] illegitimate
[19:39] uh illegitimate children
[19:44] and not the children of god you know is
[19:45] unfounded because god tests every son of
[19:48] abraham
[20:00] amen we are abraham's seed and our hairs
[20:03] according to the promise
[20:08] that's the spirit that abraham had
[20:11] he had the promise given
[20:17] and if our father trusted god and if our
[20:20] father
[20:21] trusted god and took a promise
[20:24] to confirm you
[20:26] it took a promise
[20:29] an impossibility
[20:32] he had onto it for 25 years
[20:35] equipping
[20:36] before it was ever manifested
[20:39] accomplishment getting stronger all the
[20:41] time
[20:44] he sit just like the father no matter
[20:46] what happens we
[20:48] when we when we when we prayed for
[20:51] so much to come
[20:53] particularly
[20:57] when we get everything out of the way
[21:42] god came and showed god god showed up
[21:45] and told him to and and told him to
[21:47] leave his his uh uh parents house
[21:52] and along the way god was testing him
[21:54] solution
[21:56] along the way god was mourning him
[21:59] fascinating because the prophet said
[22:00] that a character is not a gift that's
[22:02] good
[22:03] characters
[22:05] character is not a gift the character
[22:07] but the character is a victory character
[22:22] comes you know with trials
[22:27] lord help me to have faith like abraham
[22:30] don't worry abraham amen in other words
[22:32] you praying lord don't give me a child
[22:34] and and and
[22:35] and and
[22:36] give me a promise and let me have faith
[22:39] like abraham for 25 years
[22:46] when we pray that lord i want to i want
[22:48] to serve you like job
[22:51] job you know in other words you sing the
[22:53] lord whatever you'd give to job and i
[22:55] wanted to i wanted to i want to pray
[22:57] like that i want to serve you like that
[23:03] because the only way you have a
[23:04] testimony is the self manufacturing
[23:48] you
[23:59] [Music]
[24:03] after spending i believe 40 days without
[24:06] eating and drinking
[24:11] amen amen after that the devil came and
[24:13] attempted him
[24:15] he overcame with the words saying that
[24:18] it is written this is only because that
[24:20] is the only way that will pass our
[24:22] temptation
[24:24] that is the only way we'll become we
[24:27] become victorious
[24:29] it's having the word with us
[24:42] the bible says in numbers chapter 13
[24:44] verse 26 to 30.

[27:15] know their their milk and honey flows
[27:33] is true you said that you know there are
[27:35] great fruits in the land and milk and

[37:44] god is making a character
[37:47] god is making a person out of you

[37:52] you you don't come for me so that you
[37:54] can have a testimony
[37:57] so that you can have something to share

[38:02] because
[39:26] just
[39:54] she prayed all night the prophet
[39:58] she was praying
[40:00] and the prayer of a mom
[40:04] of a mom
[40:07] stop the plane
[40:33] that she stood there before she stood
[40:35] there before her house waiting for the
[40:37] prophet the prophet
[40:41] for hours for no dessert she didn't just
[40:44] pray and wait for 30 minutes
[40:47] no but she prayed and waited
[41:05] amen and god was regarding the prophet
[41:09] amen and when the prophet came that was
[41:11] the prophet
[41:11] she knew exactly that that was the
[41:13] prophet that she was waiting for exactly
[41:16] and her son was healed
[41:55] because the devil is accusing god of not
[41:57] being a healer basketball accused
[42:06] the devil is accusing god of not
[42:08] fulfilling everything that he said that
[42:10] he was going to fulfill
[42:14] so god needs new victorious this morning
[42:19] god needs new testimonies this morning
[42:23] not only what he did with abraham but
[42:25] simply clear
[42:28] with paul that's foreign
[42:31] not only what he did with joel and all
[42:33] the saints

[43:06] person amen who's supposed to give that
[43:08] testimony
[43:10] women have
[43:30] delivered the children of israel you
[43:31] know out of egypt
[43:35] they told all those people how god
[43:38] let them cross
[43:49] waiting for them to do exactly what
[43:51] they've been telling the people
[43:56] they say that god is real

[44:18] still serving a god who can deliver us
[44:48] them
[44:49] understood for god
[44:52] and god stood for them

[45:29] god delivered keep marching continue
[45:32] keep on the firing line continue
[45:36] amen just stand for him
[45:38] understood for god
[45:41] and god stood for them
[45:43] so when they were cast into that fiery
[45:44] furnace
[46:29] it wasn't just something that they were
[46:31] reading of the bible
[46:34] you know it wasn't something that they
[46:36] just were reading all stories that their
[46:38] mothers or fathers told them about the
[46:40] past
[47:24] but god was there just in spare just in
[47:26] the spare of a moment
[47:31] he delivered he delivered them
[47:34] they knew that they were prayed up
[47:38] their scenes were confessed
[47:41] they knew that they had met all the
[47:43] requirements
[47:46] and yet he seemed to be silent
[48:04] what's
[48:29] amen god is looking for what is inside
[48:31] of you
[48:45] is your heart saying the same thing
[48:49] amen you might go today at work or
[48:51] school with
[48:53] hawaii your neighbors or your family
[48:57] family telling them that god is real
[49:00] lord
[49:21] especially when everything is going fine
[49:24] especially when everything is going
[49:26] explain
[49:30] you can go out there and shout and start
[49:32] shouting and praising god
[49:37] don't say but when mountains come by
[49:39] when mountains comes
[49:42] when
[49:45] do you still have the same testimony
[49:47] excuse me
[49:48] when troubles come
[49:50] true when hard times come no more
[49:54] do you still believe that god is able to
[49:56] deliver you
[50:19] amen so you have to make sure that
[50:20] whatever you say
[50:24] amen your heart is saying the same thing
[50:27] so when trouble comes which there will
[50:30] come
[50:33] a test will come
[50:36] in a hard time hard times will come the
[50:38] more
[50:52] we have to go through trials
[50:55] amen because god want to make god want
[50:57] us to have a good character
[50:59] for me
[51:01] but when all those things will come
[51:04] instead of singing the blues
[51:20] praising him for putting a confidence in
[51:22] you for having a comfortable trust in
[51:24] you
[51:28] because notice that god had to trust job
[51:31] but
[51:35] in order um him to go tell satan what
[51:38] job what who job was
[51:42] going
[51:43] when you have troubles when you have
[51:45] temptations and trials
[52:01] stop complaining
[52:04] stop talking about to stop stop whining
[52:08] about a realm stop complaining and
[52:10] crying about that
[52:13] amen just trust god fed confidence
[52:16] because complaining it's something
[52:18] really really bad that god doesn't like
[52:20] exclaiming
[52:23] the children of israel were complaining
[52:24] all the time
[52:27] and how many of them got they went to
[52:29] the what went to the promised land
[52:35] and then god doesn't like us to complain
[52:39] because when we complain it means that
[52:40] we're not satisfied with everything that
[52:42] he's doing foreign
[52:46] because we have to agree on something
[52:47] god only gives us the best that's going
[52:49] to work to junior don't usually so
[52:51] meaning that includes even our trials
[52:54] our temptations and everything
[52:58] because remember once when peter went to
[53:01] god and said the lord we have we have we
[53:03] left our houses and our wives in our
[53:06] children
[53:12] we left everything
[53:27] that i will give you trials i will give
[53:29] you temptations that will give you hard
[53:30] times
[53:35] it's a full package that it comes that
[53:38] it's a full package that god gives us
[53:40] oh
[53:48] [Music]
[53:54] to make sure that if it blesses you that
[53:57] you will not be proud and you won't you
[53:59] would still stop treating
[54:01] your brothers the same way
[54:07] that's why it gives us all that's why he
[54:09] gives us everything that he's given us
[54:13] amen so when you have trials
[54:16] don't complain
[54:19] stop praising him
[54:22] you can pray and thank god for it
[54:27] because the answer is on the way
[54:30] and when you pray
[54:32] you just wait on the lord
[54:35] if the musician can come and sing the
[54:37] song they that wait upon the lord
[54:40] teach me lord teach me how to wait
[54:43] a musician can come
[54:46] amen that's a prayer
