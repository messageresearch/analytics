life amen we're just gonna get right into the Word of God we thank God for His goodness and its grace thank your voice mercy the Lord is good and he's greatly to be praised amen as we stand we like to ask that you would turn with us by God's grace to Ephesians the fourth chapter the Ephesians the fourth chapter surely we've been having a wonderful time the Lord in spite of all the battles God has been really good Ephesians the fourth chapter we're going to read from the fourth through the seventh verse and then we'll go to Ephesians the third chapter reading the fourteenth through the 19th verse verses there is a one body in one spirit even as ye are called in one hope of your calling one Lord one faith one baptism one God and Father of all who is above all and through all and in you all but unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ wherefore he saith when he ascended up on high he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto men Ephesians the third chapter we began reading at the fourteenth verse for this calls I bow my knees unto the father of our Lord Jesus Christ of whom the whole family in heaven and earth his name that he would grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the inner man amen that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith that ye being rooted and grounded in love may be able to comprehend with All Saints what is the breadth and length and death and height and to know the love of Christ with passeth knowledge that ye might be filled with all the fullness of God let us pray father we thank you this morning for your amazing grace we thank you for your faithfulness because your word said it's renewed every morning so is your mercy and your grace Lord and we thank you because it still is amazing to me how you would take someone like myself and save me Lord not our choosing you but you chose us and so this morning we want to lift up our hands and Thanksgiving we want to raise our hands and praise we just think your Lord God because we realize this morning and it's not what we do for you but what you have done for us thank you for this resurrection morning we pray father that you have dine on way this morning we give you praise we give you glory we give you honor in Jesus Christ's name Lord break and destroy the yokes of the enemy in everyone's life here this morning and God will be careful to give you the praise glory and honor in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated we thank God for His amazing grace yesterday when the Lord was dealing with me I had a wonderful time and it is a wonderful time when the Lord speaks and we make when God began to talk with you it's a wonderful thing and it's amazing because you know it's God because your thoughts would never be the kind of thoughts he puts in your mind and I was a little tired and I thought I would rest but he wasn't finished talking and so I thought I'd better get up and put this down because yesterday I kept crying out to the Lord what would you have me to speak on this morning for tomorrow morning and so this message I know and I trust you will be able to hear it I know it came from God the message on this morning would be the depth of existence the depth of existence because I think sometimes we don't realize that our existence it's like no ways the way James described it James when he talked about the life is of April he's working with this life and when we think about eternal life we can't even fathom where our life from this dimension fit it's kind of like a nano second something that's so small it'll take the scientists to figure out how long it is and so therefore James could only say is like a vapor and those of us who have gained a little age on us we realized that this time that we thought would be long has been really short everything moves so quickly and so fast and it's just a small portion of existence when we talk about the depth we're talking about the vastness of it how great in proportion it is existence because you realize that you and I could not even exist without God it boggles my mind to know that there are so many people who don't believe in God and God is so great he had to condon sin he had to come down and become a grain of sand in order for us to even comprehend a small portion of him when we think of out just existing in itself we can't remember what we were before we got here but we existed we don't know what it was like to be a thought of God but we were a thought of God we don't remember when he chose us we don't remember when he called us we don't even remember when he said this is what you are going to be in life remember every gift and calling is without repentance so that means that God gave us gifts even though he knew we were gonna fall he knew the condition in which we were going to be in but yet he gave us gifts and every one of the gifts that God has given to us he gave it to us before the foundation of the world before we even knew we existed and the truth about those who are elected in chosen of God you have existed as long as God has existed and these little human lives of ours cannot even comprehend what that is this little life we call here life is just a fragment of existence you and I understand that we are not just flesh and blood but we are eternal beings a bridge off of the eternal one one thing about God you can't put him in a box you can't make him one like a finger as the prophet of God says even though he was the fullness of Christ in him Christ was he was the fullness of Christ yet he still was in all above all through all he was everything and if a man is spiritual he will be able to see God in his universe understand this God had to step into his universe if I would say it like that because everything outside of the universe is filled God everything the Bible says everything that's been laid everything that was made was made by Jesus Christ well the man who makes it says he's God in morphe he's one that could change his mask hallelujah and God can do whatever he wants to do God took a donkey one time it spoke through him is that Alright God took Ravin one time and understand that Raven had to be a holy Raven because that Raven was actually bringing some holy food to a holy man called Elijah these are just little things that God has done because the Bible says your mind in my mind cannot even imagine what God has in store for us eyes have not seen no ears I've heard it in order to make a man want to run the good get to heaven when we talk about depth we're talking about the word dep th depth i have a time pronouncing it sometime but my thought about it because it's so deep yet is so simple I think I know the deepest preacher ever preached on the face of the earth with Jesus Christ himself and he preached a profound message he said a soul went to sow a seed hallelujah a good man wit and he saw the seed and then an evil man came after him and so deceive when you and I can look and see what God is doing and what God has done it's it's just it it my mind can hardly contain it that God will take take to the whole Redemption playing and liking it as a seed just to see and basically while he was preaching he was telling the church don't you understand they're two sees there's one that's good there's one that's evil and you can't be nothing but what you are whatever that seed is that's what you are when talk about dimension God is the God of all dimensions David said if I make my bed and he'll go out there if I die and take wings and fly to the uttermost parts of the earth though out there basically he said there is no place to hide from him I don't know why people think they have secrets because even God knows the secrets of the heart there's nothing can be hidden from him the Bible said everything that looking dark is light to God God sees it it doesn't matter how dark it is in haha hard we try to hide it from him he seen it all you and I must understand that this God is such a powerful God we we sing that song awesome God but I wonder do we really know what it means hallelujah man who goes say I don't believe this side of eternity how will ever realize that what you are the position that you are that God has placed you you spirit-filled people you are sons of God why he said angels are servant you're a son an angel can only bring you a message but you have to act hey mate you're the actor in the scene Oh somebody helped me this morning he said you're the actor that leads of anybody gonna see God in man he's got to see him in you and I he exists he's the invisible God but you and I are the actors we are the physical part that men need to see in order to comprehend is that right Oh think about it just to give me an illustration the woman at the well had never seen God didn't know what he looked like but one day he was at the well hallelujah and he did a certain sign he was able to discern the hearts her heart in so much she ran to the sea and say come see a man isn't this the Messiah he told me everything she really got excited but you see had Jesus just had a conversation with her and none of the discernment of the Messiah sign was seen she never would have caught on that he was a prophet and to to those who may not understand what a prophet is a true born prophet is God manifestation in flesh doesn't mean he's not a man doesn't mean he doesn't make mistakes but when it comes to the word he makes no mistakes hallelujah an angel can only bring you a message but you have to act a man you're the actor on the scene you're the son the angel is your servant to bring you the message hey I brought you this message for you to do so and so this is from the FRA father I bring it to you yes that's all he is a man you're a son and a daughter of God predestinated us hallelujah is that Alright according the according as he hath chosen us now we didn't choose how could I choose him 400 billion million billion three years ago how could I have chose him but he chose me hallelujah is that right chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be what holy so you understand those of us who have been chosen to be holy God will make sure you become holy you can't just get the Holy Ghost God must receive you it ain't you receiving God is God receiving you then you receive God hallelujah and we look at God we handle God like he's a man we think we can think what we want to we think we can act like we want to we think we can go places like we want to know sure if you are true living example of God if you are a thought or gene of God God will not allow it hallelujah but sometimes we think we have a right you have no right when you give your life to God you have no right you stripped hallelujah you come to a place in God where you want to die out and rot from all of your ways you have no right after you claim Jesus Christ you have no right to live any kind of way you want to live I'm talking about existence because for some reason people believe that you can live whatever you want to live and make heaven that is a deception from the devil you can't do it no one clean thing will enter those gates and if you die unholy you do not go to a holy place called heaven hallelujah you go to the place that has been designed for those who are unholy is that Alright see a true son of God stands the test they don't get me wrong I'm not will never say that you're not sons and daughters of God but every son and daughter of God must it's not an option you must be filled with the Holy Ghost now I'm talking about existence I'm I'm talking about you understanding that now you are playing the role that God thought of you when you was in his mind there's nothing oh I didn't know he was gonna be that way I didn't know she was gonna be that way no he knew every mistake you and I was going to make he knew our sauce he knew our pitfalls he knew our imprisonment he knew our in change I'll get the Devil Within chain i chained us up he knew these things hallelujah but God is able to break the Fowler's snare you'll never know what grace is until you know the love of Jesus for you personally hello somebody y'all understand what I'm saying those of us who think you're righteous and so holy God gonna get you unless you humble yourself oh I'm coming just a minute ain't nothing good about you ain't nothing holy about you hallelujah there is no good thing in a man nothing and when you begin to think that you're so holy and so righteous you off the track hallelujah that's why the Bible said you've got to be careful how you judge others because because of the same way you judge others God is going to come back and judge you well I feel like shouting right now but I got a preach the Bible and say God doesn't tempt men but God tries men test them God cannot tempt you but God can test you and every son that cometh to God must be tested or child trained before he can be a son and if we can stand chastisement the Bible said we become illegitimate children excuse me and if we can't excuse me stand chastisement the Bible said we become illegitimate children and not the children of God because a child of God is born of God and he will stand the test anywhere anytime in a condition on any condition a child is born of God he that's born of God does not see hello you may be elected of God you may in the mind of God be bribed but you still got to be born again Jesus Christ was born the son of God and he still had to be born again hello he still needed the Holy Ghost and if Jesus Christ needed the Holy Ghost you needed to see no no no no no if you think that heaven is full of self righteous people you've got it no I can tell you where the self righteous people are they are in hell they're not in heaven hallelujah even with all of the mighty things that God did to brother Adam you know what he was singing on the other side man Jim Gray how sweet so y'all understand me even the prophet of God knew if he was to make it it would still be by grace hallelujah deaths depths of the word yeah everybody say they deep and they don't even understand the blood of Jesus Christ they don't understand what the sacrifice of Calvary was fine because they're not really born again how can you be born again if you don't understand it took blood to save you something had to die in your place cuz you would have never measured up hello something someone died in your place because you would have never measured up you and I in all our effort could never live holy by will of the flesh hello somebody the only way that you and I could ever become holy he's by the blood of Jesus hallelujah and understand what the blood of Jesus is for today brother branham call it a token it is the Holy Ghost but nobody wants to be inconvenienced nobody really want to go through the measure to get it because like I said last week a week before last they've taught this holy goes without sensation and I agree there is that experience holy goes without sensation but where is the person of Jesus Christ ooh that all right see even in this message they want to stop where brother branham didn't stop he said the justification made room for st. location and Saint vacation make room for the baptism of Holy Ghost and he said what there's another stage there's another step and the Holy Ghost make room for the person of Jesus Christ himself well that's what I want to see the person of Jesus Christ I've seen God heal I've seen God deliver someone said to me the other day Saint John was it 1412 all referred to the prophet of God I said who told you that error that is a devil that is for the Bride of Christ God never isolated that scripture like that your prophet never did it hello somebody need to go listen to God and his people believe us 1950 but the party is if you don't if you don't accept that word st. John 14:12 for everybody you have taken from the word and the eternal life will be taken from you hello God y'all better hear me I can feel it I don't care but the truth of the matter is God is not interested in Gentile churches and supposing to a building God is interested only in individuals well that he chose from the foundation of I don't care how long you've been in this message God is more interested on how long the message has been in you Ephesians 4 4 through 7 says there is one body one spirit even as you are called into one hope of your calling one Lord one faith one baptism one God and Father of all who is above all and through all and in you all hallelujah you can't even state God even when you die hallelujah and so many people think when you're dead you're done no sir hallelujah just like you don't remember getting here uuuuu you understand me we got here we came from somewhere and we on a journey going somewhere but think about it eternity because God covers everything and you must understand those who are with God and in the mind of God before the foundation of the world has no stopping place there is no into you they cannot be into you because there's no into God but until every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ that means all of us will not have the same every one of us are different but God measures out a man a different amount of faith some might be able to move mountains some may be able to raise the dead some may be able to lay hands on the sick and they recover some may be able to fast three days seven days summer prayer warriors hallelujah but every operation is by one spirit and that is the Holy Ghost oh my I feel like shouting up here there is no space outside of God God created space whatever you consider in your mind is space god created space and the bible tells us that he's in every space wherever it is whatever's been created God is in it God is in time hallelujah God operates my time yet he's eternal hallelujah oh come on somebody I'm trying to get you to see something because a lot of times a second to the other week we were talking about the blood it'll go back to the blood because the life of the blood is what we're working with we say there's power power wonder-working power in the blood do you realize what was what you're saying you said there is God and blood God in the blood money working God in the blood because we're not working with the elements we're working with the life of God and so none of us will be able to get before God and say God the blood didn't work you didn't give me enough of blood in my life do you realize what blood the blood of God brother answer we don't work with the chemicals it ain't the chemistry if you had a crews of the blood of Jesus Christ right now it'll do you no good why the life is gone out of it there's no power in the chemistry like there was no populace and folks even Jesus declared he'd never healed anybody did y'all know that he said I do jesus never healed anybody that's that's verbatim but your prophet says Jesus never heal anybody you never heal nobody I don't care how many times you lay your hands brother branham declare himself he never healed anybody jesus said the work that I do he said I can't do it he says when I see the father do it then I do it it is the Holy Spirit it is a life in the blood it was the god that tabernacled the flesh hallelujah for this cause I bow my knees unto the father of our Lord Jesus Christ that scripture is real this is ok so you gotta understand I know this message came from God when we talk about the mind we think about this little thing that can add thing who you got a good mind you can remember you know God is talking about the being of existence in you that thing that existing you it goes beyond this this off this brain this flesh brain let this mind be in you what he's working with the Holy Spirit he's working with the character of God the nature of God let this nature be in you and while you serve abroad with you of course let me say it like this you're gonna find peace people in this message that's gonna give you all kinds of stuff I think that's sweet and Kanyon Sweeting all praise God this is what I am but let me tell you something if you don't get born again if you really don't get the Holy Ghost it does not apply to you now you can you can you can go on with knowing all these great mysteries oh brother books you so simple you're just too simple I'm simple enough for you to understand and one thing I don't have to say to nobody in here everybody know whether you got the Holy Ghost or not if you question it you need to find out for certain because the Bible said make your call and election sure oh I spoke in tongues that don't mean nothing I shouted that doesn't mean anything oh I ran up and down the house that I pay my tithe I come to church that doesn't mean I think have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe what is the Holy Ghost the life of God hallelujah and when the life of God come in you he gonna teach you how to live right you don't need a preacher over your shoulder you don't need one coming to your house if you got the Holy Ghost you live right well you live outside you live everywhere you go you live right yeah like I said I can tell you I can be just as mean and some of y'all want me to be youyou want me to use authority over you I can do that but I feel God I can tell you all you can't do this you can't do that you're not gonna do this and you gonna come to church I can do all of that but what will it produce a 2-fold child of hell you might do everything I say do and do it right but your righteousness is out of me your righteousness must be of God he is the righteous judge now I'm saying things they're not even on my nose so I know somebody needed she in the mind of God when we talk about the mind we talk about the consciousness and that's the thing brother Branham says there's many people who call themselves Christians who don't even recognize the presence of God they don't even know it why because they're so in tune to the dishes they want to see a tree move or something fatter or what ever hallelujah is that right brother man I'm using experienced descriptions he said when Jesus stood at that pulpit and said this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears he was full of the anointing the anointing of God was upon him so there Norton doesn't mean you gotta jump all the time the anointing of God in you when God can can can can can can get it when God I'm getting excited can just speak through you you're no longer speaking that's God's began when God can sing through you you're no longer the singer he is the singer you using your body when you can play the instrument hallelujah and you're no longer playing but God is playing the instrument see that's the kind of thing you want in your life hallelujah because when God wants something and he really wants you to do something and you've got you have the Holy Ghost you say Lord what what is it that you would have me to do I find out that even in this generation the hardest thing for people to do is to forgive you don't even have it if you can't forgive the devil is lying to you hallelujah you mean to tell me my Lord can be spared in the face where a crown of thorns whipped all night mockery spit hanging from his face the people he dissolved what did that not as into me the people he loved did that and up there in agonizing pain we said Father forgive them for they know not what they do brother branham tells us when people do bad to you that don't mean it's the person it's the devil you don't even have the love of God in you until you recognize your enemy it's not your brother or your sister it's the devil that's how deep the word is that's deep because most people can't do it and you won't be able to do it except God being you and now the statue of a perfect man he says now we put the blood of Jesus Christ nc in and that brings the faith of Jesus Christ the virtue of Jesus Christ the knowledge of Jesus Christ the tempers of Jesus Christ the patience of Jesus oh the blood when the blood is applied this is what it bring right it brings the faith of Jesus Christ the virtue of Jesus Christ the knowledge of Jesus Christ the tempers of Jesus Christ the pages of Jesus Christ the godliness of Jesus Christ the president kindness of Jesus Christ and the love of God which is Jesus Christ he's ahead and controls you you don't control him he controls you all help me Lord people said I gotta lay down my Holy Ghost ah if you can lay it down you don't have it hallelujah right hey and your feet is a foundation thing amen control by the head takes seat there you are there is the perfect man of God when he possesses these virtues then God representing his church as a bride a woman God represents his church as a bride and the way he breathes individual to bring his son to go in the bride he also has brought the bride through these ages hallelujah and he says listen till he brings this one complete church hung into this so you got to come into that you want to make a rapture stop fighting the whole experience if you want the rapture you want to make a wrap to stop fighting the Holy Spirit and most of the time you know what it is we are too selfish selfish it's all about you you don't even consider that the bride of Jesus Christ is hurting because of your sins here's somebody it's the truth you get out here you do what you want to do and you don't even realize that the bride of Jesus Christ I'm speaking on the inspiration right now as Jesus Christ is hurting because of your sin your stubbornness yo selfishness may God help me I'm not preaching on hate from the pulpit to the door is that right when it can stow who did it hurt not only eight cans family it hurt the whole that Israel was it 3030 I can't remember thousands of people died hello that's in the shadow that's in a type hallelujah help us Jesus see God's plan of salvation is sure and if we can see the vastness of God and we can see how great he is we realize a man that there is nothing too hard for God nothing nothing nothing nothing nothing too hard for God is that right oh praise the Lord because our little stuff is nothing Paul call them light afflictions ooh can I preach just a little while longer the Bible says in Revelation that when the beasts claim he deceived all upon the earth the beasts did he deceive all upon the earth whose names were not written in the Lamb's Book of Life since the revival began uh-huh dole does that sound right well since the preacher preached that my mighty sermon since that man was healed since that foundation know since the foundation of the world where was Jesus slain at Calvary no sir Jesus was slain before the foundation of law behold the lamb of God that was slain before the foundation of the world God in the beginning when he saw the sin he saw what was happening he spoke the word Jesus was slain before the foundation of the world and every person was saved was saved according to the Bible when the lamb was slain in the mind of God before the foundation of the world you were included in the salvation then so what are you going to do about it hallelujah y'all understand what he's saying I didn't just get saved you didn't just get saved you were saying before the foundation of the world now what are you gonna do then what do you mean even Jesus Christ Himself God manifested in the flesh had a will and he could have either obeyed or disobeyed and his flesh man did not want to go to Calvary and he prayed father not my will but thine be done see everything in the Bible it doesn't mean you gonna want to do it God just want obedience he didn't say you had to feel good doing it he just want obedient that's all God wants Jesus said not my will but let thine be done hallelujah and if my Lord said that and my lord is living in you he can say it again he'll do it again the same life that was in him if it's in you it lives the same ie it conquers the same way it always conquered and that's by divine love is that right brother Bailey said God took a lamb sweetness and meekness that's why most of us we don't win the battles we we want to fight we want to fuss we want to argue we want to carry on you are out the will of God when you do it that way you're not a lamb hello you are not displaying than their nature and when you work that way God departs that's why you feel empty that's why you feel alone because you're trying to battle the wrong way hallelujah the bride conquers according to divine love and divine love conquers everything if Jesus could whip the devil on camera to sweetness and meekness look it up that's what brother I'm said here was a lion haha conquering the devil with his lamb nature love will always conquer whether you understand it or not hey somebody that all right that old drunkard came in that house with his buddies and everything else and he said yeah cuz they argued all ain't nobody dead ain't nobody there's a Christian hallelujah that old drunk who said you come on with me I'll show you my wife is a Christian hallelujah he said honey when he got home honey fix us some food fix him some food and everything else do you know it takes a time she done labored and fixed food and put it on the table everything else he says I'm gonna play like I'm extra drunk ah he gets to the table I don't want that old stuff and he and his buddy got up from the table and everything and while they were out of the room they peeking in and he was just Holy Ghost filled woman hi what was it she got on that floor and she began to sing must Jesus bear the cross alone and all the world go free no there's a cross for everyone and there's a cross for me hallelujah what was it it was that lamb nature it was the nature of God they're inside of that woman hey man she didn't have no other way to act because she was dead but Christ was living hallelujah and because of her reaction not only did her husband get saved but his friends did to God they saw the real example of a Christian what no screaming in Holland not on her part she cried out to the one who could help her in times of need hallelujah you understand me people of God I think sometimes we think we're gonna just go to heaven like a mess no the blood of Jesus supposed to clean that mess up grace is the time that God are lost to you to get rid of your mess there's no attitude in heaven there aren't any attitudes in heaven yeah I don't preach to preach for people to like me you know that I don't do that I'm gonna say what he wants me to say because I got to give an account for him return to him for this whoo if Jesus was slain before the founders of the world it taken four thousand years before it actually happened but when God spoke it back here every word of God is steadfast it's immutable its impart potable it cannot fail and when God slayed the son of before the family of the world he was just as much slain then as he was at Calvary it's a finished product and when God say so and remember when the lamb was slain your salvation was included in the sacrifice because the Bible said that your name was written on the layers book of life before the foundation are lower it ought to make see that's why the devil don't want you to press into it he wants you to get something that's almost you don't need the almost you need the Holy Ghost so you don't need something that's gonna be religious you don't need that you need something that's gonna take you into the Holies of Holies you wanna you want God just to seal you into that place so you can bloom like like like like like like the rod Aaron's rod you love the Lord okay I'm almost done I'm almost done with this portion but you got to understand when I read this story I'm closing up on it and you know I I tell you what I wish I could preach it like he gave it to me oh my god my mind was like a river just I can't explain it but it was just like a river a water just coming on down into my heart it just it just it wouldn't stop flowing nothing I did nothing I did he just came on his own yeah I went down on my knees praying at the time he came on his own Hebrews Chapter seven one he says listen what if at all mayor gave birth to a little knew that little Mew had both ears broke down he was cross-eyed and not need Bowl aid his tail stuck right straight up in the air what a horrible looking animal why innama if that little Mew could think and say now wait a minute when they come out from the house this morning I'm telling you I'm sure gonna get knocked in the head because they'll never feed me look what a horrible looking thing I am I haven't even got a chance well until you get to that place where you can see yourself is not having a chance that's when you get a chance well that's right you haven't got a chance well I was born in the world but lookee here what a horrible looking thing I am I'll never have a chance I won't make it I can't make it hallelujah but what if this mammy is really instructed in the law law right she said son that's right you're all out of shape you're not even fit to eat the food off the earth that's right you're not fit but son somehow another you're my first and you know you're born under a birthright and the priest will never see you but for your name there's got to be an innocent lamb without a blemish has got to die in your place so you can live hallelujah it ain't because I belong to the message it ain't belong it is it you know I believe William Branham is the prophet praise God and you gotta believe that hallelujah you gotta believe God was in that man hallelujah I'm talking my rapture material now you gotta believe that every sign wonder and everything else he did it was Christ in the man hallelujah and it's so easy in the brother it's so easy for all of us to say you know what brother family this brother brown did this brother you think God gonna ask you that when you get to heaven if you get there you think he gonna say tell me everything William Branham did he ain't gonna do it why you got your own day you got your own work if he asked us that most of us wouldn't even know what all what he did because he didn't tell it all thank God we're not we won't be graded on that I would ask you but I'm gonna say it I'll answer how many y'all how many of y'all really read your Bible thank you I know you know I know people don't because so many people don't believe it's necessary you know if I said how many y'all listen to a tape every day that's that that's gonna drop to once a week twice a week once every two weeks it's good that you listen my opponents did not the brother him said this he said if you drink if you drink it he said it will push out all that meanness all that selfishness all that stuff you fight with every day he said if you drink it you you drink he's in the Holy Ghost did you know that he said the Holy Ghost feeds off the word so if you're not eating the word if you're not putting that word in you he has nothing to feed on your experience will die hmm so you gotta feed it you said what brother was what he said you have to eat this word every day saturate yourself in it is that right even if you can't understand it put the tape on listen to it anyway you should never go without you should never go a day without reading your word or listening to a tape or some gospel something you know you should always surround yourself with the heaven heavenly atmosphere I'm almost doing this the last quote I'm gonna read to today well my point is if we could see the vast and then you see that your little eye light affliction I was telling somebody years ago I used to those are Streisand I said oh that's supposing this is just a little feather on my back hmm I got this felt on my back oh my burdens are so heavy I don't know what I'm gonna do and I can't hardly make it oh oh I can't I can't Holly make you brother Oh nonsense that's the way God looking at us nonsense you know when Jesus couldn't Holly make it as a man guess what happened the Lord sent an angel to strengthen him and you are the body of Christ don't you realize when you get to a place you can hardly make it all you've got to do is cry out to God and Goddess dispatch an angel someone to this to do what to strengthen you more than likely your theophany get up from there boy you know you can do better than that how many I'll believe you got it the often because really when you hear from this message and you really believe it that's is that shows you haven't you haven't the off me you have a word body that means you are eternal and it's Christ that God looks at not you hello but sometimes people look at this like okay Christ is here and I'm here Christ that looks he looks at coming back to the blood right where is Christ heard somebody you get an A today it has to be he has to be in you that's why when I see the blood I'll pass over you I must see Christ in you in auditor for the judge judgment angel to pass over you he looking at you once you did your dad suppose suppose what are you dead and if you got Christ on the inside that's what God is looking at the seed the blood of Jesus the life of Christ in you that's why he passes over you but if you don't have it you get the same stuff the foolish virgin gone again until you get Christ in you you gonna have battle after battle failure after failure it's going to be just that way until you really get the real Christ in you I'm almost done is this alright so if there's no fault in him how can there be fall how can he find fall when you are dead and your life is here in Christ through God sealed by the Holy Ghost they are the they that are born of God does not commit sin for he cannot sin how can he sin when a perfect sacrifice is laying in his place God never looks at me he looks at Christ because we're in Christ alright and if I love Christ I live with him he will never brought he will never bought me unless he knows if God saved me today knowing he was going to lose me six weeks from today he is defeating his own purpose he don't even know the future then if he saved me knowing what he's want to save me for knowing he's going to lose me God doesn't do things then take it back in two weeks to keep his promise when he saved you it's for time and eternity I'm gonna stop there because I'm gonna say this to you everybody in here by God's grace I'm not trying to make people feel bad I'm trying to don't waking us out of this religious stuff that we find ourselves in religion club with religion everywhere I go that's what I see religion everybody hide behind William Branham religion oh I believe the Prophet don't get me wrong you've got to believe the Prophet but do you think that's going to save you when you get to a place and you believe just that that's Antichrist cuz only place you can be save is under the blood Jesus Christ saves you got to have an experience you got to know Jesus for yourself then when Christ coming to you you become omnipotent rather than say God love bravery I heard that this morning God and His people he said God loves bravery he said when you get the Holy Ghost you're supposed to be brave not some weak something I don't know what you want to call it People of God I'm telling you you said a person's you shouldn't talk like that well if I got the spirit of Elijah and I got a double portion you ain't seen the half yet be large it and play with people he saw spirits and he he went right for the juggler and you and I must realize Amen this message is not something to be played with you either live it or you leave it that's the safest thing you can do you can't live it God can live it for you but you know what I tell people in it in closing they don't want to be inconvenience but I'm gonna tell you something God has never changed his way of birth every birth a calling the prophet of God is a mess I don't even care versus up in the pink decorated room it's gonna be a bloody mess and you're gonna ask any woman who's had a baby when she she's in the process of having that child she loses all her shame who when she is in the process of having our child she loses all of her shame and that's what hinders people right now why they don't have the Holy Ghost because they got too much pride and you get to a place where you you you throw away all your shame and you always give me throw away all your pride and don't care about who's next to you and what people think about you and in all that nonsense you talk about heaven you're talking about breaking through you talking about going all the way with God that God can go beyond the veil yabai him into your heart people afraid of it they don't preach it no more that's why we're getting all of these children amen that's not being with the rooster and they're rotting in the nest that's the problem you love the Lord in moments like I'll sing I'll sing [Music] [Music] [Music] let's say again in all this I'll sing I'll sing our love soul to G the moment a little singing sing it Oh hallelujah into the chamber be frijoles speak to me as I close here love let the press discover Shekinah Oh Nene is all in to be free you speak to in about a desire prayer you can come [Music] Shekinah is all Oh Peter [Music] as I close Oh read its word into this world father we come before your Lord in your precious name we thank you for your grace and your mercy Lord you heard when I brother said Lord it was your word going in him and coming out of him Lord it's that anointing it's that Holy Spirit Lord God that wants more of you Jesus Lord that you would heal him Lord and it push out all the Alleluia all the darkness in his life granted Lord bless my brother Isaac in a special way Lord bless his family as well long as we commit him into your hands Lord granted we thank you for the victory and we thank you for the victory we buying those Oh God that troubles his mind
