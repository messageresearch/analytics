believe she's uh graci's friend is yeah I believe her family stand we can welcome her amen amen amen so we greet you all in the name of the Lord Jesus we're so happy to be here amen at this Sunday morning of the Resurrection so now we can stand and take our in the Book of Romans we read uh the chapter Romans chapter uh 8 Romans chap we will start from verse 14 to 23 14 to 23 amen I preach this uh sermon in Iowa City amen it was an introduction to a study that we'll be doing amen so um Romans chapter 8 14 to 23 amen the Bible says that for as many as are led by the spirit of God there are the sons of God for ye have not received the spirit of bondage uh again to fear but you have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry AB father amen amen the spirit of adoption whereby we cry ABA father the word or the verb cry here it's not crying in sorrow amen it's not when you're sad and somebody cries with Crying In Joy because if you go to Matthew uh we're not going there but if you go to Matthew 21 after Jesus healed the sick the blind man was made to see the lame was made to Walken the Bible says that people started crying hosana hosana the word shouting it's in other words for Shout in I mean cry Joy amen so for we you have not received the spirit of bondage Me by you have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry ABA father so now the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God Amen and and if the children and if children then hairs hairs of God and join hairs with Christ it so be that we suffer with him that we may also be glorified together so now Verse 18 the bible say that for I reckon that the suffering of this present time amen are not worthy to be compared with the glory which uh which shall be revealed in us for the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God for the creature was made subject to vanity not willingly but by reason of him who has subjected the same in Hope because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glor the Glorious Liberty of of the children of God for we know that the whole creation granth and and travelleth in the pain in in in pain together until now and not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit even we ourselves grown within ourselves waiting for the for the adoption to wait the Redemption of our body amen amen amen let's bow our heads again father God we just read your word Lord a man can flip the pages of this book by you are the only one who can give us a revelation we come Lord and ask you father to come down lord and and Reveal Your word to us Lord bless this service once again in Jesus Christ name we pray amen amen you may be seated so this morning we will uh I have a little teaching that we want to do hereen and and the the title of it will be adoption amen amen because as we read that the entire creation is waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God Sons and Daughters of God Amen they're waiting for the adoption for that ceremony amen so we have to understand that before being adopted amen you have to be a son amen you have to be a daughter amen adoption doesn't make you a son amen you have to be a son before you be adopted so to understand this we have to go back to Genesis amen we have to go back to our creation amen we know that the the prophet teaches us that before the creation before there was a creation amen before God created anything amen he was Elohim amen which means the self-existence one the self-existing one he didn't have a beginning and he did not have an End Amen he's the one who amen he existed by himself amen so the the the Bible say says that in the beginning the word I mean the Earth was void and empty so God started to create God created the nature God created the firmament amen he created the light and everything amen then it comes to when he started now if God felt he was alone amen because we know that God is an object of worship that's why God created created angels so that the angels will be constantly worshiping him but even though the Angels were worshiping God God still had in him some attributes that he wanted to manifest he had attributes that wanted to that wanted to be manifested he wanted to be a Healer he wanted to be a provider he wanted to be a savior amen he wanted to be a father amen so he couldn't do that only with the angels because angels Don't sin amen angels Don't Make Mistakes angels are there Amen to worship God Amen so he couldn't do that with angels so he decided to start he decided to create a man amen so in Genesis chapter uh 1 if we go here uh verse 26 the Bible says here and God said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the foul of the of the air over the cattle and over all the Earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth amen so God created man in his own his own image and the image of God created he him male and female created amen so here's the first creation the first man that God created it me it was a spirit man because the Bible says that that man was created in the image of God and the Bible teaches us that God is a spirit that's why those who worship Him has to worship Him in spirit and Truth when God created the first man here in Genesis chapter 1 it wasn't a physical man that that was amen but he was a spirit man that was created so this Spirit man that was created God put him there Amen to have dominion over everything that was on Earth amen God created that man amen to have dominion to be the ruler of the earth that's why you see Paul in Romans 8 saying that the the creation is waiting amen the creation is impatient amen waiting for the manifestations of the sons of of God because when God created the man he gave the Earth as the man's domain amen he gave man the Earth to rule amen so the creation amen he's waiting for that man to go back to the stage or or or the position that he had so when God created this man if you notice that God did not give a condition to this man God did not set boundaries to this man God created this man and he says that you will be the ruler amen created him in his in his own image amen because the spirit man cannot fall so there is no need for God to put boundaries so after the creation was done God noticed that the Earth needed some work some lab amen God saw everything was beautiful but still the Earth needed geted somebody to work on it so that's when God formed amen if we read uh Genesis chapter 2 amen if we read uh verse S no let's start in the beginning here let's start from verse four amen the Bible says that these are the generations of the heavens and on the and of the earth when they were created in the day that the Lord God made the Earth verse five and every PL and every plant of the field before it was in the Earth every herb of the field before it grew for the Lord God had not caused it to reain up on the earth and there was no man to Ste to tilt the ground you see the Bible here saying that there was no man to te the ground because the first man that God created amen he was there as the ruler amen he was not made to do the labor work of so now if we go we jump to verse seven now so now after God noticing that there was no man to tear the ground verse seven the Bible says that and the Lord God formed man in the of the Dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and Man became a living Soul amen so notice here in verse seven the Bible is not using the verb create amen but the Bible saying that God formed amen forming means amen you mixing things together to come amen you mixing it's not chemistry it's chemistry amen so God formed Man Out of the Dust of the earth amen amen and that that was the physical man amen and that man now if we jump to verse 15 the Bible says that and the Lord God took man the man and put him into the Garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it you know this man was now the steward of the creation amen he was there to do the labor work now verse 16 now and the Lord God commanded the men saying of every tree of the garden freely eat but of the tree of of the knowledge of Good and Evil thou shall not eat of it so when God created the second man that's when God put boundaries to the amen because you knew that this flesh will end up falling amen so that's why he put the boundaries telling him what to do and what not to do amen so the prophet says amen he says here uh in the questions questions and answers on Genesis it says that the first man talking about Genesis one amen is the second man made manifest in five senses amen the first man amen he's he's the second man made manifest because God wanted to have someone to fellowship with God wanted to have someone to talk to amen God wanted to have someone that he can have a conversation amen so that's the reason why God made a man amen to worship him so that he can have a conversation with and as we know that that man fell amen amen and he lost the position that he had before the beginning that he had in the beginning so since ever since then Nature has been grow gring amen waiting for the manifestation of that man that was created of the Son of God Amen of the adoption amen so here uh uh so adoption it means Place adoption is a placement amen is a placement to position someone believe in adoption number three the prophet says that adoption the prophet said that adoption is is a placing it's placing the body of Christ positionally in Christ where the holy spirit is the leader where Christ is a what what the holy spirit is the leader amen it's the placement of of a son to a service to a certain service amen and that placement amen will be will be the result I mean will have to do with the character of the son amen because it's not just any any son that will be adopted that be place for a service but it will be a son that the father can trust a son that that displays the character of the father that the father can say that now you are ready to continue with the business now I can restore on you all the all all the power all the authority so the prophet says theet it says your adoption is not your birth your adoption is your placing when you were born again or when you are born of the spirit of God we are sons of God but we were predestinated now here's what I'm trying to get you to for this sons of the last day amen we were predestinated unto adoption amen you become a son amen when you are born again when you receive the Holy Spirit that's when you become a son so a son amen has to learn the business of the Father the Son amen has to be prepared to be become the replacement of the father so that is the reason why God sends us the holy spirit so that that Holy Spirit can guide us in all truth the prophet says amen that the holy spirit amen amen amen it's a give a temporary gift amen it's there for a purpose amen and that purpose amen is to prepare you for your adoption also call it our tutor the teacher amen so for you to be adopted amen that tutor who is the holy spirit will have to go back to the father amen every time with the report amen of how you doing you will have to go report to the father this is the son that you have this is how notice that you have first to be a son so the holy spirit is there to report the character of the son amen so that's the reason why brother Bram said the character is not a gift the character is a victory is something that you have to earn amen based on what you go through your adoption will have to depend on your character what you go through attitude your the attitude that you reflect amen that's when the father will decide if you have to be adopted or not amen notice the Bible says that we were predestinated unto adoption amen which means that amen it's something that you will have to get that say some word that you will have to get amen it's something that you will have to become amen you are not born as an adopted son but you are predestinated unto adoption amen the prophet calls that it says that it's because of the omniscience of God he say that we said that God is omnipresent amen not because he's everywhere at the same time amen because God is a being amen a being is not everywhere but God knows everything because he's omniscient amen and that make him to be omnipresent amen because he knows the thoughts that you he knows every thought that we we do have amen he knows every time that a fly has to B his wings amen so because of his omn knew amen he knew the end before the beginning he knew the path that you will have to take to take he knew what you will have to be so based on that Omission B on that that's what he predestinated us onto adoption amen he knew that we will have to get there at some point he knew that we will have to reach the level of adul when he created the world he also predestinated us Amen to unto adoption amen but you will have to be a son first amen so that's why I say that relationship is different than Fellowship amen a fellowship can end a fellowship can change but a relationship does not change amen notice that God created man amen God created a man and that man was his son because the prophet said that God created a man off of himself question and answers I believe on in question and aners on Genesis he says that the logos came out of God and Men came out of logos amen because you do have the same DNA as him amen you are his sons and daughters amen so when Adam fell after the fall amen a man lost that Fellowship but he did not lose the relation because even on that Fallen State Adam was still the son of Goden Adam Adam was still the Son of God his fellowship with the father was changed God was not coming down in the cool of the evening anymore every but even though the fellowship changed amen but his his relationship did not change let's say for example brother John is my son amen looking at me like this we are in a good relationship amen I will still call him my son but when he turns his back against me I might not be able to talk to him personally though I cannot talk to him he's my son amen when he goes ahead and tell people who he is amen he will not say that he was born of himself he would refer me as his father when you do a DNA test you will see me in his linage I will be his father it doesn't matter even if he hates me to death amen even if he wants to kill me amen our relationship will never change our relationship will be a father and son relationship amen our relationship will never change our fellowship might change for a moment but the relationship will still be the same amen so the human race the fellowship between the Father and Son changed [Music] amen the fellowship changed amen but we were still the son of the father so that's why throughout the throughout the time God was trying to find ways to restore that Fellowship amen God was not restoring the relationship because we were Sons we are Sons amen but God was trying to restore that Fellowship that's why he sends prophets Amen to try to show us the way that's why he sent Moses to the children of Israel to take them to the promised land that's why he had to take Abraham from his father's household amen throughout the entire throughout the time but he noticed that all those Prophets they came and that that taught us the way but still there was something missing amen the man still needed Redemption man still still needed to be bought back to be placed back to the position he had before so he didn't matter if you killed thousands of animals that was not able to restore that position God decided Amen to create himself to make himself a son Amen to create himself amen a being that looks like you create a being that has eyes to see like a being that can be touched by the by by by by by by by infirmities feeling of Amen a being that can go through everything that we've been through in other words God created a being that can relate with this [Applause] body amen because the first man that God created amen was in the image of God the spirit amen so to redeem a man amen God had to be to make himself a being that looks like this man amen to die on the cross to pay the price of redemption Amen to buy you back Amen to take you back amen it's like a story that I've heard before amen there was a young man amen who created a boat he was playing with the boat one day he decided after the rain he decided to go out amen then he put his boat in the little river that was before his house amen and that boat was driven by the by the current of water and and he lost his his boat amen then years went by one day he decided he went to a pawn shop amen there he saw the boat he saw the boat that he created amen so he went to that P went to the uh the owner of the pawn [Music] shop he said he said man that's my that's my boat I need it back it's me I created it look this board has my engraving on it so the the owner of the pawn shop looked at amen he said that you might be telling the truth but this butt is mine now it belongs to me now so for you to have it you have to buy it back you will have to buy it back for it to become yours then he asked how much is it let's say it was $20 and looked in his pocket he only had $15 have enough money amen he went back home amen he took up all his savings all the money that he had he went back to the to the owner of the shop they said man here's your money I want my boat back amen and when he got the boat back the young man look at the boat he said you were once mine and now you are mine again amen that's the same thing with us amen we belong to God before amen we were his before amen but after the fall amen we changed ownership amen we became the property of Satan so for God to have amen a price was required amen it was a price amen that nobody else could pay a price that him alone could pay amen so he had to create amen the father went back to his Storehouse he took everything that he had amen his most precious precious son his only begotten son the prophet says the prophet amen Jesus was the Masterpiece of his creation so he took that Masterpiece amen he took him amen he gave him as the price amen for your Redemption amen for you to be restored amen back to your position amen he did that for you and me amen the Amen in G Galatians chapter 4 verse 1 to 1 to 7 if we can continue with us here the Bible says and now I say that the the hair the air the air as long as he's a child differ nothing from a servant though he be Lord of all amen if you have a little baby a 5year old kid amen he's born in a palace he's born is a son of a king amen when he goes playing with his friends amen he doesn't go playing knowing that he is a son of a king amen first of all he doesn't even know what it means amen first of all he doesn't even know the opportunities that come with that title amen so that's why the Bible here is saying that an air as long as he is a child is not different from a servant even though he is the Lord of all amen but is under tutors and governors the time appointed of the father amen even so we when we were children we in bondage under the the elements of the world but when the fullness of come when the fullness of time was come amen God sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law Amen to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons and because you are Sons God has sent forth his Spirit the spirit of his sons into your heart crying ABA father wherefore thou are no more a servant but a son and if a son then an heir of God through Christ amen so the tutor which is the Holy Spirit amen he's there to teach you Amen to show you the business Amen to teach you the word amen to teach you all the promises of Goden the prophet here says in adoption I believe uh paragraph 17 he says adoption number two I believe it says now the father his son let's say his son is a good boy so now here's the here's the Tor the tutor the Holy Spirit which which way the Holy Spirit he said I'm going to walk so now now it's a conversation the prophet here is uh showing the conversation between the two of which is the Holy Spirit and the son so now he says that the holy spirit says I'm going to walk and then the child said I'll walk with you I'll go right with you now the Holy Spirit replies back to the son he says oh this heel is awful High [Music] son amen there are so many dangerous stuff in the hill you don't have to come with me amen you don't have to walk with me amen so the son replies back and say I will go right with you I got confidence in you amen if I start getting tired you'll raise my hand I'll raise my hand up and you will hold me on Amen because I have confidence in you amen and then the holy SP replies back and say but there is Lions up there on the hill then the child replies back and say that don't matter as long as you are around amen it don't make a bit of difference difference because I'm walking right along with you amen he says that there is trouble up there amen it's sliek rock the son says I don't care as long as you're holding my hand I will walk right with you I will walk right with you oh you know what the holy spirit says you know what your dad used to do that see that's good amen the only the son is there amen he has the promises of the father amen and he knows amen as long as I do have those promises amen it doesn't matter what I'm going through I know that I am not alone it doesn't matter what's going on in my life I know that the father is always with me that's what David say I walk in the valley through the valley of shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou are with me th Road and th stuff there com Comfort amen it doesn't matter how dark the road is it doesn't matter how how how dangerous it is it doesn't matter how lonely it feels like I know that I am not walking alone you there with me amen when I'm about to fall amen you'll reach out your hands and because I'm not holding you you are holding my hand am when you walk with your kid it's not the kid holding you first of all the kid has a small hand he cannot hold this big end so you're the one putting your hands on the kid long as you are holding the kid the kid is secure that's a relationship with our father the one holding us even when we feel like falling we can't fall because he will never leave us am he will never forsake us he says that I will never leave you I will never forsake you I will be with you until the end of the world I will even be inside of you Amen to make sure that you're safe make sure that all your needs are provided that's why we sing that song friendship in Jesus he is our friend amen he is our father he knows our sorrows he knows what we going through he's there as a reminder that we are not alone amen You are not alone when children of Israel were before the Red Sea amen they were so afraid they felt like they were alone then God told Moses am may give this people a little word of encouragement amen and Moses under the inspiration stood up and said fear not stand still and see the salvation of the Lord which will show you today which he will show you today amen because the Egyptians whom you have seen you shall see them again no more amen every time you afraid every time you have dangers every time it feels like all hope is gone amen remember that you are not alone in those moment God will send a word of comfort telling you not to fear to stand still amen and to see the salvation of the Lord amen that salvation that he will show you today because the dangers that you're seeing right now you will see them no more amen so a son has to show to the tutor that he believes what the father say amen he has to show to the tutor because the tutor always brings report to their father amen of your of of your progress am he tells the father everything amen when you've been slapped what's your reaction amen are you going to I give another chick amen the tutor will go and tell it to the father when you been St watch your watch your reaction amen what when you're being criticized amen when you been mocked amen when you lied upon what is your reaction how do you react amen the tutor goes up to the father and says this he said you know what father your son is just he just like a chap off the of the old block is exactly like you every word that you say he says Amen to it amen I had him turn over in the Bible the other day where it says Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever he said you know what he said he screamed and throw his his hand up in the air hallelujah hallelujah amen amen and you know and you you you and he says that thank you and he said and you know it and you know it said here he says here in your word where you said the works that he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also yeah then the father said yeah I remember writing that I I remember writing that to my son I remember writing that oh when when he saw that he just screamed and jumped and jumped up and down amen H Hallelujah take all the world out of me make me like that yes sir and all those things that he done oh the father said it I am happy for that son that is a fign son all right now keep an eye on him for a few years see how he comes on and how he progress after a while the years passed by how is it going how is it getting along how is getting along progress amen so the the tutor which is the Holy Spirit brings every report negative and positive report to the father amen because it'll be based on his report that the father will decide if you are worthy to be adopted if you are worthy to be placed amen Ephesians 1 vers vers 3 to the Bible says that Blessed Be The Garden of and and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places verse four according he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world Amen that we will that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love now having predestinated us onto adoption good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he has made us accepted amen you were predestinated onto adoption amen so when that the Holy Spirit comes and and and gives all the reports amen and the father sees that the son is finally ready to be adopted to be placed or to be given a service to you the prophet says that and then we see then after that the father then taken his son out and robbed him robbed him in a beautiful [Music] robe and set him out before the public as an example as an ins sign and all the manifestation and declared and he will declare this is my son and he has received he received in the uh uh and he received in the ceremony the right he received he received the right in the ceremony in other words his name on the check will be just as good at the bank as his own father's name for he was a hair an hair of of all things amen amen after the adoption amen the name of the son amen will be as good as the name of the father because you are now trusted with the business of the father so then you can go on and continue your father's work it's only when you are adopted that's when God will place you into a service amen a service to do amen so that service is different from one another amen other people are pastors are placed as adopted as pastors others as singers amen others as preachers mothers and and husbands amen so it's you place you being placed there amen for a certain service amen it's not that because the sister sings amen that I also have to sing it's not that because this brother preaches that I also have to preach or because this one is like this that I also have to become like no but adoption amen it's individual amen you are placed in a service based on your character based on the gift that's in you you will excel well in that service it's not just something that you wake up and you decide who you want to be no but it's something that's placed that God is himself positioning you amen but it will have to do with your character amen with the uh uh uh uh the answer I mean the report of the holy spirit amen so if we go to the believer's position in Christ so now here the brother said now into his church you that is positionally seated in in Heavenly places in Christ Jes amen it says that you that are positionally placed he said be humble amen it said be humble because someday the holy spirit will speak to you and call you out to one side somewhere in a little cabin or on the hillside or in the washroom or somewhere amen and there he will anoint you for a certain service a certain thing to do it won't be the lay it won't be the laying on hand uh the delaying on the hand of the P ppers or or elders amen but it will be laying on the hand of God Almighty amen it won't be a certain Pastor who will lay his hand on you to position you to a certain thing man he won't be a certain uh uh Apostle or Prophet or whatever you can Callen who will lay his hand on you and position you to do something but said the Propet said that it will be the laying on hand uh the laying on the hands of God Almighty himself Amen to put a new ministry in you and and and and and then a new robe put a a new ministry in you and a new robe on you and to set you out as an example and all the demons out of tment will never upset upset you amen when you are position amen when you are placed amen there will be no demons that would that will be there to tment you notice here is not only speaking to someone who's just filled with the Holy Spirit amen here he's talking Amen to someone who feel with the holy spirit amen and he's also adopted amen he knows his position in Christ amen he knows what God called him to do amen he knows that amen no matter what happens amen he is a son of God amen and that will never change amen he is God's son amen and God died on the cross for him amen and if he sins or he falls shorter or he falls short amen that would never take him out as a son even though he will have to pay for it amen but his relationship will still be a son amen that's the adoption amen when you know who you are amen and brother bam said amen the day that the bride will know her position when the bride will know exactly who she is amen the Rapture will take place amen when when the brother will come to the realization amen of what she is amen what what what what God call her to be amen not not going around and messing up with little things debating on useless subjects showing that you know showing that I know more I know the word more than this other brother or sister that is not why God gave us the word God not give us the word our knowledge Amen to be able to show to call ourselves doctors and whatever Nam God gave us this word to prepare us amen for a certain service Amen to prepare us Amen to reach that maturity that he's requiring requiring us amen for a service that he predestinated us to do amen the prophet says here now notice the Greater Works was to have the power in the church amen this is I believe Jesus when he was talking to it says that the works that I do you shall do also and even greater than this shall you do amen so the prophet says here it says now notice the Greater Works was to have power was to have the power in the church not only to heal the Sick by PR cast out Devils by prayer amen by the Greater Works was there to impart eternal life to believers amen not only amen not only to heal the sick even though it's good not only to cast out demons amen even though it's good amen but the greater work was there was given Amen to impart eternal life to believers amen because if we can have that scripture pulled up pleas amen The Works that I do you shall do also but greater than this shall you do amen if we understand that scripture amen that scripture has two it's talking in two sentences it's using two two sentences or or uh two times if I can say amen there is a present time and the future time if we the bible say that verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me the works that I do amen that's the present The Works that I do shall he do also amen which means amen The Works that Jesus was doing at that moment you will do also amen so if we look in the life of Jesus we can see what kinds of Works he was doing amen he was resurrecting the dead amen he went to Lazarus tomb and resurrected him amen he was Healing The Sick amen he was casting out demons amen he was stopping the storms amen he was multiplying bread and fish amen he was creating money in the belly of a fish amen amen those were the works that he was doing at that Mo at that moment when he was speaking because he says that the works that I do you shall do also then he did not stop there then he says that and Greater Works than this shall he also do am a Greater Works greater than these works that I am doing right now you will also do because me I can't do it right now because I have to go to my father amen but you will do it amen when your adoption will come you will be able to do this greater work so that's why the prophet is saying here he said that the Greater Works amen was to to have power was to have the power in the church amen not only to heal the sick cast out Devils by Devils by prayers by prayers but to impart eternal life to Believers that was the to be able to impart eternal life to Believers so now the Holy Ghost was coming and given into the hands of the church amen to impart life oh that's what Calvary meant it took St de greated men and women it took St de greated men and women deed thank you and LIF them into a place Amen to be Sons and Daughters of God Amen to heal the sick and to impart eternal life by giving the Holy Ghost Amen to obedient Believers amen men who were once unbelievers made Believers and import spiritual eternal life amen how much greater is it amen to say this sick woman laying here I can pray a prayer of faith and she'll be healed that's a great thing that's what he was doing then but said greater than this shall you do I am going to give you power amen not only to raise him up for a while amen but to give him eternal life which will be Eternal forever amen the prophet says here amen it's great to tell to a sick woman to pray for a sick woman and she'll be made healed amen that's great amen but what God was that that was what he was doing then amen but the greater work he was saying amen it was not to raise up people for a for a while for a little time but to give eternal life amen the great works that Jesus did man he did about I believe three resurrections I might be wrong you amen but those resurrections amen it wasn't Eternal resurrections they were temporary amen because the people that he resurrected they ended up dying anyways amen Lazarus was resurrected but Lazarus did not live forever Lazarus ended up dying he resurrected I believe the daughter of of jerus amen she she she was resurrected amen but she ended up dying because that was the great works that Jesus was doing then he say now you will do a greater than this it's no longer a temporary Resurrection amen but he says I am giving the Holy Ghost to your obedient believers Amen to be able to impart eternal life not only to raise him up for a while but to give him eternal life which will be Eternal forever amen that is the job of an adopted son that is the job of an adopt a daughter to be able to transfer that life that's inside of you am to someone else Amen to give him eternal life the prophet continues and say poor blind wretched people how do you miss that don't you see what what the greater thing is that's the greatest thing could ever happen that is the greatest thing that could ever happen was to impart eternal life to people what is eternal life amen it's the life that he lived amen the life that was in him amen impart that to others he says that can a man do that a Son of God can so a son of God amen can take the life that Jesus lived the life that was in him and imparted to someone else if you are an adopted son if you have reached your maturity if your name has become the name of the father your name has become as power if your name is now as powerful as the name of the father amen your signature on the check will be as powerful as the father's signature when you can now impart the Holy Spirit or eternal life to someone else this is not just for babies but this is for mature Sons and Daughters of God someone that God has seen his character and has found worthy Amen to give the authority amen of his word amen because the prophet says that what we need right now is amen but what we need right now is Authority amen it's the authority that will stop the devil it's that Authority that will make the entire hell Shake said that when a policeman stands outside amen he has no power to stop a car is running system that that car will run the policeman like nothing polien has to know who he is he has to know the value of his uniform that when he stands there not even saying a word cars will still slowing down by themselves that is the authority that a Christ that the Son and Daughters of God need that's standing there your presence alone is making the entire he Shake Your Presence alone is making sin uncomfortable that your presence alone amen is making all the demons F fly amen that is the authority that we need amen Jesus said whosoever sins you remit to them they are remitted whosoever sin you retain them they are retained brother say said that when a son is adopted amen now he has the power Amen to fire people and to hire people amen the son when is adopted amen when he has that full Authority amen if you're not doing a good job he can say I'm sorry but you fired amen it doesn't matter if you go back to the father say well your son fired me your father will looked at your father your father will looked say there is nothing that I can say amen I can only say Amen to what my son say amen and that same son amen also has the power to hire someone you know someone has abilities you like the person call him you'll be you'll do a good job in my [Applause] company now father will come by he will look and said that where is this man coming from people say where your son hired him okay because he did that okay that's because the father now trusts amen the Judgment amen of the son amen he knows that the son is not acting by hatred amen he knows that the son he's not acted by Revenge he knows that the sonen he's not doing this because this person slapped him but he's doing this amen for the good of the kingdom of God that is the point where we have to be that is the level that we will have to reach am to become Sons and Daughters of God to have the same Spirit as him the Bible says in first John chapter one chapter 2 I believe amen he says that John says that a son when he walks in the light amen he has to walk exactly as Christ did Peter came and start showing us how did how Christ walked if we go to First Peter chapter chapter 2 verse 21 amen the Bible says here first Peter 2:21 please amen said that for even here unto were ye called amen because Christ also suffered for us amen leaving us an example that you should follow his steps so now how did he walk he did he did no sin neither was he gu neither was was G found in in his mouth who when he was reviled reviled not against when he suffered he threatened not but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously amen that is the son that the father is looking foren that is that son that the father is looking for amen who when is insulted amen he does not insult back even though he might look weak but he does not care about how he looks like he there for the good of the Kingdom amen when he's reviled R not again he suffered amen he threatened not amen but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously amen that is the son that the father is looking amen and when the Holy Spirit is coming to the father with this report then the father is happy and he knows that that everything I told my son to do my son is doing it so now I can go and give him something greater Place him somewhere where he will have full Authority that is the adoption amen is the placement of a child a placement of a son for a certain service so you have to be a son amen the prophet says that there are different dispensations amen we had the dispensation of the law it said that we had the dispensation of the holy spirit amen but now we are living a dispensation of the adoption amen where God will take his sons amen who are already filled with the holy spirit because the holy spirit is a prerequisite of your adoption you have to have the Holy Spirit before you be adopted amen so God is taking those Sons and Daughters amen and placing them to a service amen that does not mean that God has closed his door and he's not filling people with amen God is still filling people with his amen Peter gave us the remedy how to rece amen he said that if you repent and you baptized in the name of the Lord Jes then you shall receive the power of that gift of the holy spirit amen so God is calling us to to be to the onto adoption but before we reach that level amen we have first to be born again we have first to have the Holy Spirit and that same God Amen who leading us to adoption amen he's the same God who's also filling us with his Spirit he says that if you are thirsty amen come and buy come and drink out of the fountain amen the fountain that never that never that never weers amen it's that Fountain of God Amen so that God is still filling that God is still blessing amen we all are in different levels and and God has a time for everybody amen by that time it's not Eternal amen there is a specific time amen there is a window amen and that window will close in many people probably were happy because of the how the election turned out if if Cela Harris had won maybe we would have seen many people on the altar because then they will start thinking well the prophecy has been fulfilled amen but your window can be closed today your window can be closed tomorrow don't wait until you see the destruction for to God is willing the prophet said that he is willing to give us even more more than what we more than we desire amen he's willing to fill us with his Spirit am the world is going to an end the Bible says that God is Not slack according to his it's not doesn't mean that because it's giving us a little time that that time will be forever there will come a time where the door will be closed that it doesn't matter how long and and allow you knock the door will be closed amen notice with Noah Noah preached for years when he started preaching maybe he had a bigger group a bigger crowd amen but as long as years were going by people now find them found themselves comfortable man Noah became like an alarm for people when Noah start preaching that means it's 5:00 a.m. or 3 they so comfortable with that situation amen but they didn't know that the time of God was running out the time their time was running out they didn't know that Noah wouldn't be there forever even 120 years felt like forever for them but those years came to an end amen he came to a time where God himself closed the ark amen and when the rain [Music] started amen people came and knocked at the the ark amen Noah was in the ark hearing people knocking feeling bad for people wanting to open the door and amen but but wasn't out of his hand by by the by by the situation was out of his hand situ amen because God Blocked the the ark from the outside even though he wanted to amen he couldn't save people amen you still can come to church you decide to wait for years when your door if your door is closed it doesn't matter if you come to church every day amen a preacher as we are preachers as we are amen we will always want to save Souls amen but if your door is closed it doesn't matter even if I preach for hours and I started bleeding nothing will be done to you because already pass so you have to run to the yard when the door is still open amen don't be like the foolish virgin wait until they hear they heard the sound of the trumpet that the the bridegroom is is coming that they weren looking for o amen but be like the the wise amen who they knew that the bridegroom will come amen sooner or later he will come you will have to be ready we will have to St our own oil amen so if you feel yourself this morning in that situation amen that you not saved or that you don't have the holy spirit amen it does not mean that you lost amen because you still feel that desire amen that means that there's still hope for you amen and God is there to fill you up amen he says come unto me as you are and I was give you my spirit I will give you rest I will give you the holy spirit so he's here Amen to fill you up amen he's here to bless you he's here to provide to all your needs what you have to do is just to be honest with him be sincere to amen talk to him as you talk to your friend to him like you talk to someone that you trust tell the person all the secrets amen I know as human there are sins that we love to do amen we do enjoy it amen but even though you do enjoy it God knows what you your your situation he knows that you enjoy doing he knows that you are addicted to this but still he's willing to deliver what it takes just for you to be honest with him amen tell him the truth amen he knows it anyways but he wants you to say it he want it to come out of your mouth so the musician can come amen and we can sing a song Amen Amazing
