[43:40] [Music]
[44:13] [Music]
[44:18] to get down to jesus
[44:22] [Music]
[44:30] and all of a sudden a worship service
[44:32] was going on in that room
[44:35] [Music]
[44:41] [Music]
[44:48] jesus christ jesus
[44:50] and that woman he said
[44:52] and the same thing is true this morning
[44:56] jesus christ has met the appointment
[44:58] jesus christ
[44:59] with him to meet with him this morning
[45:02] wherever
[45:14] [Music]
[45:16] and he's here what's up to us
[45:20] with the attitude that we have in our
[45:22] hearts
[45:24] whether we'll be on the inside of that
[45:26] worship service
[45:29] or whether we will just be watching it
[45:31] from a distance
[45:34] now i have a lot of scriptures to go
[45:36] through this morning
[45:39] and i i hope you love the bible
[45:43] hey man because we're going to go
[45:44] through a whirlwind of scriptures this
[45:46] morning
[45:47] [Music]
[45:49] but i just want to take a path going
[45:52] through
[45:53] showing what mount zion meant
[45:59] [Music]
[46:10] what that means to us today
[46:25] we'll go to uh psalm 68
[46:38] i had about four different scriptures i
[46:40] wanted to start
[46:49] but we'll start here in psalm 68
[46:56] psalm 68 we'll start with the first
[46:58] verse
[47:02] and it says let god all right amen
[47:06] let his enemies be scattered
[47:23] now let's go down to
[47:27] the seventh verse
[47:33] the situation here
[47:35] the situation
[47:36] is king david is watching as
[47:40] the ark of the covenant is going back up
[47:42] on top of that mountain
[47:49] the ark of the covenant that led them to
[47:50] the wilderness
[47:53] led them through every trial through
[47:55] every battle through every war
[47:59] truly always belonged on mount zion
[48:04] that that ark of the covenant always
[48:05] belonged on mount zion
[48:10] and hundreds of years had gone by and
[48:12] that the ark wasn't there
[48:16] but now is the time for that ark of the
[48:19] covet to ascend up that hill
[48:25] to go to a tabernacle where god had
[48:26] prepared for it
[48:29] and as that that ark of the covenant was
[48:31] ascending up the hill
[49:01] and so as that arc was ascending he
[49:03] began to cry out all that god arrives
[49:08] just like god arrives into his proper
[49:10] place
[49:12] and all of his enemies will be scattered
[49:20] amen now let's go down to uh
[49:28] lost my place here let's see
[49:37] verse 7
[49:42] and he's talking about when he brought
[49:43] them out of egypt
[49:47] and how the they saw the power of god
[49:50] going before them as they left egypt
[49:52] through the wilderness
[49:54] let's read seven through nine here
[50:06] how did he march he went with a pillar
[50:08] of fire
[50:16] the heavens also dropped at the presence
[50:18] of god
[50:21] even mount sinai itself was moved at the
[50:24] presence of god the god of israel
[50:30] thou o god did send a plentiful reign
[50:32] whereby thou did confirm thy inheritance
[50:35] when it was weary
[50:50] [Music]
[51:03] everywhere the presence of god went
[51:06] victory
[51:13] now let's go forward to uh verse 15.
[51:20] psalm 68 15.
[51:23] now he's fast forwarding time talking
[51:26] about mount zion
[51:29] they're now in the promised land
[51:33] but in the midst of that promised land
[51:35] god gave them a special mountain
[51:39] right there in jerusalem
[51:43] and and now he's beginning to describe
[51:45] this mount zion
[52:02] a high hill
[52:14] why are you jealous
[52:27] this is the hill which god desires to
[52:29] dwell in yea the
[52:44] even
[52:58] hey
[53:12] not my desire
[53:14] but thine be done
[53:16] lord and your bride is gathered here
[53:18] this morning
[53:20] because of your promise
[53:23] where you said you be with us
[53:26] lord as you sat down and opened the word
[53:28] to your disciples father 2 000 years ago
[53:34] may you sit down this morning and open
[53:36] your scriptures to us this morning
[53:40] [Music]
[53:52] in the name of jesus christ
[53:59] now we just read there
[54:01] in the middle of psalm 68
[54:05] all these verses david was crying out as
[54:08] he was watching the ark of the covenant
[54:10] ascend back up up where it belongs
[54:18] finally god's promised land
[54:22] has a capital city
[54:24] capital all this time the the presence
[54:27] of god has been dwelling in tents
[54:32] but now the the promised land of god has
[54:34] a capital city
[54:41] for hundreds of years the the promise of
[54:43] god had been they've been living in the
[54:45] promised land but they had their enemies
[54:47] have been troubling them
[55:01] he goes around the country in a
[55:03] supernatural anointing
[55:16] and after every enemy was conquered yeah
[55:29] and when david perceived when it was
[55:31] revealed unto david that god had made
[55:33] him king over all israel
[55:39] that god even gave him the heart of the
[55:41] land into his hands
[55:46] his
[55:51] [Music]
[56:00] but to give god a place to be worshipped
[56:05] to give god a place where god has the
[56:07] preeminence
[56:10] oh no longer just worrying about
[56:11] conquering the lusts of the flesh
[56:46] [Music]
[57:07] and that pillar of fire followed that
[57:09] ark of the covenant all the way
[57:15] [Music]
[57:24] and defeat
[57:38] and the enemies were defeated
[57:57] [Music]
[58:06] the stories of the forefathers before
[58:09] him
[58:10] and the power of god in their midst
[58:13] and now they have peace from all their
[58:15] enemies
[58:17] and let god's ark of the covenant
[58:20] say let's go
[58:34] he began as that ark began to ascend up
[58:36] that hill
[58:39] dave it began to get a little inspired
[58:43] you read back in the book of the samuel
[58:45] or the kings i think it is
[59:16] as you
[59:42] i was watching the presence of god being
[59:44] going to
[1:00:04] you know god had prophesied of that
[1:00:06] mountain for ages and ages and ages
[1:00:12] prophecy
[1:00:25] he would send out a prophecy
[1:00:29] and then the next year the enemy would
[1:00:30] come in and take over the mountains
[1:00:33] he would send out a prophecy but during
[1:00:35] prophecy and then the next year the gods
[1:00:38] people go into captivity
[1:00:50] because as soon as god sends out our
[1:00:52] prophecy
[1:00:54] he knows that
[1:01:03] [Music]
[1:01:07] god said let there be uh let there be
[1:01:09] treats
[1:01:11] rise up out of the earth
[1:01:14] well he just sat there and waited that's
[1:01:17] right
[1:01:17] those trees just got to come
[1:01:21] when god said let there be an earthquake
[1:01:48] i don't know if that's true or not but
[1:01:50] there's an old jewish tradition that
[1:01:51] that's where adam and eve were back
[1:01:58] in john chapter four there was an
[1:02:00] argument about that mountain
[1:02:04] jesus he said you know i need to go by
[1:02:05] samaria
[1:02:08] they begin to talk to this woman
[1:02:12] and she says you know our fathers say
[1:02:14] that we should work with worship in this
[1:02:15] mountain over here
[1:02:31] let me tell you something
[1:02:43] [Music]
[1:02:45] they're the true worshipers
[1:03:00] but you know just because the mountain
[1:03:02] was beginning to change
[1:03:07] doesn't mean that the promises were
[1:03:09] changing
[1:03:12] there were specific promises about that
[1:03:14] mountain
[1:03:29] god arrives
[1:03:31] just like our eyes
[1:03:35] and i know all of his enemies will be
[1:03:37] scattered
[1:03:40] where is that mountain today
[1:03:43] [Music]
[1:03:57] where that pillar of fire will come down
[1:03:59] again
[1:04:02] amen david was beginning to get inspired
[1:04:05] he says
[1:04:06] as god left egypt
[1:04:19] you know that's the same god that pulled
[1:04:21] you out of the world by my man
[1:04:50] [Music]
[1:04:52] or money or whatever it was
[1:04:55] some temptation upon our mind
[1:05:00] we would just go do it
[1:05:02] there was nothing to stop us
[1:05:06] you know i
[1:05:19] you just go do whatever the enemy told
[1:05:21] you to do
[1:05:24] you go to your prayer closet you pray
[1:05:25] lord i want to be a better person
[1:05:30] oh i wish i could be a real christian
[1:05:33] but then the enemy would you'd walk out
[1:05:35] of your prayer closet
[1:05:38] the enemy would come and push that
[1:05:39] button
[1:05:41] are you turning go off and do whatever
[1:05:43] the enemy told you to do
[1:05:47] and then after that you think now why
[1:05:48] did i do that
[1:05:52] i wasn't going to do that anymore
[1:05:55] lord i wanted to stop doing those things
[1:05:58] but every time the enemy comes he just
[1:06:00] pushes that button and you march off and
[1:06:01] do the will of satan message
[1:06:12] you read these stories in the bible of
[1:06:14] these mighty christians
[1:06:27] that fought for god in the power of the
[1:06:29] holy ghost
[1:06:44] you just need god to arise
[1:06:47] to his proper position
[1:06:50] there is a place where god young
[1:06:56] noah he
[1:06:57] was in the ark
[1:07:00] and he sent out that that that that that
[1:07:03] crow
[1:07:06] that vulture whatever it was
[1:07:10] and it never came back
[1:07:14] was happy to go out there and land on
[1:07:16] the dead carcass after dead carcasses
[1:07:24] out of the arc
[1:07:26] in colombo
[1:07:40] because doves can't eat those things
[1:07:47] it's the same thing with a real
[1:07:48] christian
[1:07:51] even if you're not in your proper place
[1:08:07] and you start doing those things that
[1:08:09] you ought not to do
[1:08:12] but let me tell you it's just going to
[1:08:13] make you as sick as sick
[1:08:16] [Music]
[1:08:18] because there's something about you just
[1:08:19] it torments you in your mind
[1:08:23] [Music]
[1:08:48] that dove went out from the ark again
[1:08:49] and it found a little
[1:08:54] but it couldn't rest on it because the
[1:08:56] branch was so small
[1:08:59] so it just grabbed its feet and brought
[1:09:01] it back to noah hello
[1:09:19] sent the dove out of the ark
[1:09:24] and the dove never returned
[1:09:28] a place to rest
[1:09:31] jesus one time he looked upon his
[1:09:33] disciples
[1:09:37] the disciples says well let's just go
[1:09:38] find a place to stay where are you
[1:09:40] staying at where are you living
[1:09:45] and jesus looked at him he says
[1:09:49] the foxes have holes
[1:09:54] foxes have dents
[1:10:00] the birds have nests
[1:10:04] but the son of man has no place to lay
[1:10:06] his head
[1:10:10] there's no place the son of man was sent
[1:10:12] to the earth
[1:11:10] from
[1:11:13] the earth picked him up and put him back
[1:11:15] in the heavens upon a cross he said we
[1:11:17] don't want this man it is
[1:11:44] but they took them and they placed them
[1:11:46] back on the cross back up in the heavens
[1:11:50] return to sender
[1:12:06] jesus before
[1:12:32] [Music]
[1:12:40] will worship god in spirit and in truth
[1:12:50] let god arise
[1:12:53] and all of his enemies will be scattered
[1:13:04] on the day of pentecost
[1:13:08] in the upper room
[1:13:12] now you remember when jesus christ was
[1:13:14] ascending
[1:13:17] his disciples were gathered there with
[1:13:18] him
[1:13:21] he gave them his last words
[1:13:25] and all of a sudden he is
[1:13:27] he began to ascend
[1:13:29] through the air
[1:13:59] supernaturally
[1:14:01] and all the miracles the signs and the
[1:14:03] wonders
[1:14:05] the lame walked the the dead
[1:14:10] the blind could see
[1:14:12] the hungry
[1:14:25] three and a half years he gave them
[1:14:27] every single thing they ever needed
[1:14:31] and now he's leaving them behind me
[1:14:34] and they're sitting there staring
[1:14:37] up in the sky and they watch as the
[1:14:39] cloud obscures them out of their
[1:14:42] [Music]
[1:14:54] staring
[1:14:57] what are you looking at
[1:15:00] what are you waiting for
[1:15:03] go and do everything he told you to do
[1:15:07] or he's gonna come back the same way you
[1:15:09] saw him
[1:15:12] and i want to tell you that that promise
[1:15:14] is just as true as it was 2 000 years
[1:15:16] ago
[1:15:18] that our lord is coming back to this
[1:15:21] earth again
[1:15:50] i want you to go preach the gospel
[1:15:54] preaching all over the world
[1:15:58] but don't be preaching in your own
[1:15:59] strength now
[1:16:02] don't be preaching this gospel in your
[1:16:04] own strength
[1:16:08] don't be preaching in your own power
[1:16:13] oh don't go preaching in the in the
[1:16:15] power of the baptist
[1:16:31] but go wait there in jerusalem
[1:16:59] but there is one mystery that was
[1:17:01] revealed by martin luther
[1:17:05] as the just shall live by faith
[1:17:09] and by that faith they will be justified
[1:17:14] i believe that yeah you know i can't go
[1:17:17] with the the the the the uh methodists
[1:17:24] but the methodists did have mar or john
[1:17:26] wesley the founder of the
[1:17:28] wesleyan
[1:17:54] john wesley i can believe that
[1:18:16] [Music]
[1:18:21] because the power of god that came down
[1:18:23] in that upper room
[1:18:50] now it was the power of god was
[1:18:51] restoring his church in martin luther's
[1:18:54] day
[1:18:58] bringing them out of a dark age
[1:19:02] bringing him out of the dark ages where
[1:19:03] the church died under catholicism
[1:19:19] he began to resurrect it to a martin
[1:19:20] wesley
[1:19:32] the 1940s and 50s healing campaigns went
[1:19:35] all across the world
[1:19:41] articles began to be written in the
[1:19:42] newspapers of miraculous healings and
[1:19:45] signs and wonders
[1:19:50] because in the late 40s uh an article
[1:19:52] was written bible days have returned to
[1:19:55] the earth again
[1:20:01] what is it it's the power of god
[1:20:09] jesus christ was manifesting himself
[1:20:11] upon the earth again
[1:20:15] what's what's god doing
[1:20:19] the gentile day is coming to an end
[1:20:24] it's time for us to get out of here
[1:20:28] living in the last days of
[1:20:31] the gentile race
[1:20:36] and they're receiving the same signs and
[1:20:39] wonders that the jews received when
[1:20:41] jesus christ walked on the earth
[1:20:55] but that mount zion was not just some
[1:20:58] some mountain
[1:21:55] of how to receive the holy ghost
[1:21:59] oh you know when you received the holy
[1:22:01] eucharist
[1:22:05] [Music]
[1:22:07] your first
[1:22:27] elders they lay their hands upon you and
[1:22:29] they say we're confirming the holy ghost
[1:22:31] upon you
[1:22:36] or in the the pentecostal church
[1:22:39] when you get emotional enough to speak
[1:22:41] in tongues
[1:22:45] you have that same holy ghost that came
[1:22:47] on the day of pentecost
[1:23:02] where is that power of god that took
[1:23:04] over the world 2000 years ago
[1:23:08] [Music]
[1:23:10] if god be amongst us where are his
[1:23:12] miracles
[1:23:13] where are his sons where are his wonders
[1:23:15] where is the living god
[1:23:21] but yeah just let god arise
[1:23:25] and every single one of his enemies will
[1:23:27] be scattered
[1:23:30] well you say well how do we get god to
[1:23:32] arise
[1:23:46] worshipers they won't worship them in
[1:23:48] the baptist denomination
[1:23:54] they won't
[1:23:55] worship him as a methodist
[1:23:57] oh no but there's a cry that has gone
[1:23:59] out in these last days
[1:24:14] of their sins
[1:24:19] brother branham
[1:24:22] was a prophet sent to us in these last
[1:24:24] days
[1:24:28] as they went forth preaching in the
[1:24:29] 1940s 50s and 60s
[1:24:34] he went first first with a uh healing
[1:24:37] ministry
[1:24:41] with signs and wonders that that many
[1:24:44] tried to imitate
[1:24:49] but you know let me tell you never has a
[1:24:51] ministry been seen like the ministry of
[1:24:54] brother william brennan
[1:25:23] was revealing himself to the gentile
[1:25:25] world
[1:25:26] [Music]
[1:25:33] could have the same experience
[1:25:38] that the jewish church had 2 000 years
[1:25:40] ago
[1:25:45] as the lame began to walk
[1:25:50] as the blind began to see
[1:26:05] that men began to realize
[1:26:09] this ministry of brother branham
[1:26:12] was not just a natural ministry
[1:26:16] that god was visiting his people again
[1:26:29] but it was to catch the attention of the
[1:26:31] bride of christ
[1:26:49] because as jesus christ ascended up onto
[1:26:52] the earth into a cloud
[1:26:54] that jesus christ said
[1:26:56] is returning again
[1:27:01] jesus christ is coming back to this
[1:27:17] i see in revelations
[1:27:22] the deity of jesus christ is being
[1:27:24] revealed
[1:27:28] and as the deity of jesus christ is
[1:27:30] being revealed
[1:27:34] john the revelator was watching this all
[1:27:36] unfold
[1:27:40] he said i heard a voice behind me
[1:27:44] as he heard that he heard that voice
[1:27:48] he turned and the deity of jesus christ
[1:27:51] was revealed through that voice
[1:27:55] but you get to the end of the book of
[1:27:57] revelations
[1:28:16] but now the spirit and the bride are
[1:28:18] speaking at the same time
[1:28:20] and they're speaking the same thing
[1:28:40] spiritual foolishness that's going on in
[1:28:42] the churches
[1:28:45] oh god isn't speaking to the americans
[1:28:49] he's not speaking to the congolese
[1:28:52] he's not speaking to the germans
[1:29:05] he's speaking to the churches
[1:29:08] come out of here
[1:29:10] he says those churches they've they're
[1:29:12] like a a cage of unclean animals
[1:29:19] a cage of wicked spirits it says in
[1:29:22] revelation 17.
[1:29:29] you can find him in revelation 17 18.
[1:29:34] a cage of every unclean and wicked
[1:29:36] animal the casual uncle was buried
[1:29:42] and it's the truth
[1:29:45] but brother brian prophesied
[1:29:48] with the book of revelations
[1:30:18] to branham tabernacle
[1:30:22] he said uh should i take him to uh
[1:30:24] tucson
[1:30:26] where can i take them
[1:30:29] in that question and answer his sermons
[1:30:42] now the ministry of brother brandon was
[1:30:44] so supernatural
[1:30:52] [Music]
[1:31:00] and a focus on the prophet only it's a
[1:31:02] concentration
[1:31:05] and brother brandon realizing that
[1:31:09] realize well where should i take these
[1:31:10] people they've come out but where what
[1:31:12] will we go into that's the west coast
[1:31:14] it's not something
[1:31:17] [Music]
[1:31:29] they all say he says yes there is a
[1:31:31] place
[1:31:33] he said it was a reveal to me just now
[1:31:37] there is a place for the bride together
[1:31:42] in the lord jesus christ
[1:31:44] it's in the son of god
[1:31:46] just gather right in there
[1:31:52] just find yourself in the wings of the
[1:31:54] almighty
[1:31:56] where the power of
[1:32:23] [Music]
[1:32:25] corinthians 3.
[1:32:29] paul began to talk about the the veil
[1:32:31] was ripped in two
[1:32:34] voila
[1:32:49] [Music]
[1:32:51] see
[1:33:08] but when jesus christ was dying on the
[1:33:10] cross the earth earthquake took place
[1:33:15] the veil was ripped
[1:33:19] and the mercy
[1:33:21] seat was on plain view
[1:33:26] but to see what it is the mercy seat
[1:33:28] wasn't that little arc there in the
[1:33:30] behind the curtain
[1:33:34] [Music]
[1:33:35] it was the body of that man that was
[1:33:36] hanging on the cross
[1:33:41] it was hanging there in plain view of
[1:33:43] the people
[1:33:46] but they couldn't see
[1:33:49] the it that had the spear couldn't see
[1:33:51] that that was his creator
[1:33:56] the ones that marked him and spit on
[1:33:57] them they couldn't see it
[1:34:01] the ones that saw them
[1:34:14] see the the veil that was on the the
[1:34:17] veil that was on on the on
[1:34:19] on the temple
[1:34:22] was no longer upon the temple
[1:34:26] the veil was on their hearts
[1:34:30] according to second corinthians 3 no man
[1:34:33] can see the lord until that veil is
[1:34:35] taken away
[1:34:41] in 64 brother brown preached that sermon
[1:34:44] you know
[1:35:25] [Music]
[1:35:55] she's she's wearing a red dress
[1:35:59] hey you're you're just praying just now
[1:36:04] they say you're not praying for yourself
[1:36:07] but you're praying for your mother over
[1:36:09] in kentucky
[1:36:12] who has cancer
[1:36:14] and she's not saved
[1:36:17] they say go back to kentucky
[1:36:21] and you'll find your mother healed and
[1:36:23] serving the lord
[1:36:29] now i don't know about you
[1:36:32] that happened in 1963
[1:36:46] he could not do that himself
[1:36:50] remember said you people call me a
[1:36:53] prophet
[1:36:55] he said i'm not a prophet
[1:36:57] he said the holy ghost is the prophet
[1:37:01] because he knew the power of the god was
[1:37:03] on the scene
[1:37:19] just like moses when god told
[1:37:22] smite the rock
[1:37:23] [Music]
[1:37:26] and moses and he went and smote the rock
[1:37:28] twice
[1:37:31] god said you shouldn't have done that
[1:37:35] so has jesus christ been crucified a
[1:37:37] second time
[1:37:42] why
[1:37:43] because of the hardness
[1:37:45] of the gentile heart
[1:37:56] have crucified jesus christ all over
[1:37:59] again
[1:38:26] that is not
[1:38:27] contaminated with the things of
[1:38:42] foolishness
[1:38:44] let god rise to where he belongs that's
[1:38:46] good where he ought to be
[1:38:48] god ought to be dwelling upon your heart
[1:38:51] be living and reigning upon your heart
[1:38:59] i think it was in the indictment
[1:39:02] i think it was 1956.
[1:39:07] forgive me if i'm wrong but brother
[1:39:08] brown
[1:39:10] those four words out of the gospels
[1:39:18] those four words i forget what verse it
[1:39:20] is
[1:39:23] but it's at the end of one of the four
[1:39:25] gospels
[1:39:29] and he read just four words out of that
[1:39:31] verse
[1:39:34] they said
[1:39:35] those four words are this
[1:39:38] one
[1:39:39] there
[1:39:41] they
[1:39:42] crucified
[1:39:44] him
[1:39:49] there they crucified him
[1:40:19] of all peoples among the nations
[1:40:25] crucified
[1:40:28] the most painful death known to man
[1:40:34] him
[1:40:37] god's one and only son
[1:40:40] that god so loved the world
[1:40:43] he gave his one and only son for the
[1:40:45] earth
[1:40:48] in god's
[1:41:02] but the thing
[1:41:08] the church of god in these last days has
[1:41:11] done it all over again
[1:41:14] by rejecting the god sign to this world
[1:41:21] when brother branham turned his back to
[1:41:23] the audience
[1:41:26] and nothing could be hid from him
[1:41:30] god began to reveal the secrets of the
[1:41:32] hearts
[1:41:34] you're there in the red jacket you have
[1:41:37] you have cancer god will heal
[1:41:40] you have a lung disease god will heal
[1:41:41] you
[1:41:43] you're praying for your mother in north
[1:41:45] carolina god will save her
[1:41:48] now man can't do those things
[1:41:53] what was it
[1:41:55] it was our lord and savior
[1:41:58] amen
[1:42:01] [Music]
[1:42:05] now that was a sign to catch the
[1:42:06] attention of the people
[1:42:10] to pull us out
[1:42:38] he said but when a man begins to turn
[1:42:41] and look upon the lord
[1:42:46] that veil will be taken away
[1:42:50] and you'll see him in plain view
[1:42:53] oh if you just can just get away from
[1:42:55] your own natural thinking
[1:42:59] and cry out to the god that's been
[1:43:01] revealed in these last days
[1:43:05] he's been revealed for one purpose
[1:43:08] an objective
[1:43:11] that he might have a preeminence in the
[1:43:13] bride of the lord jesus christ
[1:43:17] and by it all the rest of the world will
[1:43:19] be judged
[1:43:22] amen amen
[1:43:24] but just let god arise
[1:43:27] and all of his enemies will be conquered
[1:43:30] and that last enemy which is death
[1:43:33] will be put underneath our feet
[1:43:36] as we
[1:44:45] he had his picture taken with brother
[1:44:47] branham there
[1:44:49] pillar of fire came down in the room
[1:44:52] came over his head
[1:44:54] now brother branham isn't here anymore
[1:44:57] but let me tell you that pillar of fire
[1:44:58] is still here
[1:45:00] i
[1:45:14] i
[1:45:26] praying and believing on the lord and
[1:45:28] also in that light
[1:46:00] [Music]
[1:46:09] amen amen
[1:46:24] as the message that was given to us
[1:46:33] it was revealed for a cause
[1:46:38] for a reason
[1:46:59] [Music]
[1:47:01] and let your heart be turned away from
[1:47:03] the things of this world
[1:47:33] let's just stand
[1:47:59] but to the same place that moses
[1:48:02] he looked into the heavens when he was
[1:48:04] on that mountain
[1:48:10] we spent 40 days and nights with the
[1:48:12] lord up there on the mountain
[1:48:16] he had a chance to peer into the heavens
[1:48:19] [Music]
[1:48:22] and he saw a tabernacle
[1:48:25] where god dwelled with man
[1:48:29] and the lord told moses
[1:48:32] go back down there
[1:48:35] and recreate down there what you saw up
[1:48:38] here
[1:48:42] what do you see up there
[1:48:45] [Music]
[1:48:57] the blood of the lamb was there
[1:49:01] healing was there
[1:49:03] deliverance was there
[1:49:06] the hidden man was there
[1:49:08] [Music]
[1:49:12] a high priest
[1:49:20] [Music]
[1:49:23] you saw a man and god meeting together
[1:49:25] in a little room
[1:49:32] [Music]
[1:49:38] you know you don't have to wait for some
[1:49:40] date way off
[1:49:47] [Music]
[1:49:53] where you will be
[1:49:54] transformed for me amen and change
[1:50:00] to meet with god
[1:50:02] moses saw it
[1:50:05] [Music]
[1:50:08] oh he recreated it down there on the
[1:50:10] earth
[1:50:14] but his heart yearned and cried to see
[1:50:16] that
[1:50:20] you know god allowed him a chance to see
[1:50:22] it
[1:50:26] [Music]
[1:50:37] and the gospel says
[1:50:40] that moses and elijah appeared with
[1:50:42] jesus christ on mount transfiguration
[1:50:47] it says that they talked with him about
[1:50:49] the death that he would accomplish he's
[1:50:51] on mount calvary
[1:50:54] [Music]
[1:50:58] oh you know it's going to happen again

[1:52:34] just let it be ended it's like your word
[1:52:36] said
