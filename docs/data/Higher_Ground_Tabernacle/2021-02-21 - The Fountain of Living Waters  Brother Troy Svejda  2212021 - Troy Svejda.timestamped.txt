[34:07] as our
[34:07] brother troy amen let's pull on
[34:10] the gift amen we all have a we all have
[34:14] a gift and sometimes your gift is to
[34:15] pull on the gift
[34:17] amen amen
[34:22] [Music]
[34:31] amen god is so
[34:35] good
[34:38] oh god
[34:49] [Music]
[35:14] is
[35:17] [Music]
[35:28] has it been good to saints amen that's
[35:30] been my experience
[35:32] hey man it's been that way my entire
[35:35] life
[35:36] my god has been good to me amen we all
[35:39] have those testimonies
[35:41] things as we look down through our lives
[35:43] the things that god has done for us
[35:46] and it just causes us to stop and think
[35:49] and realize catch the revelation that
[35:51] our god
[35:52] has placed our lives in his hands
[35:56] amen and no matter what we go through
[35:58] through this life's journey
[36:00] we can have that confidence to know that
[36:02] that god will be with us
[36:04] everywhere we go i know i've referred
[36:06] often to that quote where brother
[36:08] branham said
[36:09] he was discouraged about something or he
[36:12] is a little down about something and
[36:13] something was going on and i don't
[36:14] recall
[36:15] exactly what it was but when he was in a
[36:17] room and all of a sudden the
[36:19] real sweet presence came into the room
[36:22] and he said he heard that voice coming
[36:25] and he says and that's the sweetest
[36:27] voice you could ever hear
[36:30] said to him the never failing presence
[36:33] of the lord jesus christ will be with
[36:35] you wherever you go
[36:37] don't you be afraid go anywhere or do
[36:39] anything
[36:41] for the never failing presence of the
[36:43] lord jesus christ
[36:44] is with you wherever you go and we think
[36:47] i
[36:47] said what a blessing is that brother
[36:48] branham has such a promise like that
[36:51] but jesus christ himself told us i will
[36:53] be with you even in you until the very
[36:56] end of the world
[36:57] amen so the promise to the messenger
[37:00] is not so much different it's the
[37:02] promise of those that receive the
[37:03] message
[37:05] amen we are here the ones that are
[37:07] holding on to that message
[37:09] amen the messenger was sent for a people
[37:13] and we are that people so take courage
[37:17] saints
[37:18] you know no matter where you get to in
[37:20] your life's journey sometimes we get to
[37:21] the places where we get a little down or
[37:23] a little discouraged about things
[37:25] you know we know that our flesh is
[37:27] capable of getting to those places
[37:30] but there is something on the inside of
[37:32] us that rises up
[37:34] that no matter how our body feels no
[37:37] matter how the state of our mind is
[37:39] there is a spirit deep down on the
[37:41] inside
[37:42] that knows that we are the children of
[37:44] the most high god
[37:45] that knows that we were chosen before
[37:47] the foundation of the world
[37:49] that knows that that no matter what our
[37:51] body declines
[37:52] or what our mind declares that we are in
[37:55] the hands of the almighty god
[37:58] and that one of these days this body is
[38:00] going to melt away
[38:02] one of these days this this mind will
[38:04] will this faulty mind will disappear and
[38:07] we'll be given
[38:08] a new mind and a new body amen that'll
[38:11] be like his glorious body
[38:14] because in a moment in a twinkling of an
[38:15] eye we will be
[38:17] changed and the things that are fallen
[38:19] will melt away
[38:20] to the things that are immoral amen i'm
[38:24] looking forward to that day saints
[38:26] i enjoy the mountains i enjoy the hills
[38:29] i enjoy the
[38:30] the scenery and the thing and but then
[38:32] when the realization comes
[38:34] that the god that created all those
[38:35] things that we enjoy
[38:37] has also said i have gone to prepare a
[38:39] place just for you
[38:41] and if i go i'll come back and receive
[38:44] you to myself
[38:45] and i'll say entering into the joys of
[38:47] the lord
[38:49] and the one that created all these
[38:51] things down here that we enjoy
[38:53] has already created a place for us
[38:56] with you in his mind amen because he
[38:59] knows the things that we enjoy in this
[39:01] life
[39:02] amen let's just stand in honor of the
[39:04] word of the lord
[39:09] i want to turn to john chapter 4.
[39:21] i speak a message this morning called
[39:23] the fountain of living waters
[39:29] john chapter 4
[39:36] start there where the woman at the well
[39:39] is
[39:40] speaking in verse 9.
[39:45] and it says then said the woman of
[39:47] samaria unto him
[39:49] how is it thou that being a jew
[39:53] ask a strength of me which am a woman of
[39:56] samaria
[39:57] for the jews have no dealings with the
[40:00] samaritans
[40:03] jesus answered and said to her
[40:06] if thou knewest the gift of god
[40:09] who it is that saith to thee give me to
[40:12] drink
[40:13] thou would have asked of him
[40:17] and he would have given thee living
[40:18] water amen let's just stop right there
[40:23] by our heads of word of prayer heavenly
[40:25] father we just approach unto you this
[40:27] morning lord
[40:29] knowing that you are the great god you
[40:31] are the same one lord that
[40:33] was walking through the time of their
[40:37] pla the geography of samaria and you
[40:40] stopped at that old well that was called
[40:42] jacob's well and they've been drinking
[40:46] from it from a long
[40:48] but that one day you came there and you
[40:51] spoke to that woman and said woman give
[40:53] me the drink
[40:55] and lord and we respond you knew exactly
[40:58] what you were going to say in response
[41:00] to her
[41:00] and lord and so is it this morning lord
[41:03] that you know exactly what you are to
[41:04] say to this people father
[41:06] lord i just as i lay myself down lord
[41:09] and open my heart lord to the people
[41:11] father
[41:12] i pray lord as the people open their
[41:13] hearts to you lord i pray that we all as
[41:16] one body lord right now in the name of
[41:18] jesus christ would receive from
[41:20] you and lord as we dedicate ourselves as
[41:23] christians of the most high god the
[41:25] bride of christ lord
[41:26] we pray lord come into this place lord
[41:28] and have thine own way in the service
[41:30] this morning
[41:31] that when we leave this place that your
[41:32] bride might say
[41:34] surely it was good that we went to the
[41:35] house of the lord this morning
[41:37] for our god has spoken to us our god has
[41:40] met us at our point of need
[41:41] our god is to our cry our god has met
[41:45] the needs of the hour
[41:46] and lord we know that you already have
[41:48] done it so we just
[41:49] submit ourselves unto you lord and ha
[41:52] tell you lord have thine own way with us
[41:55] this morning
[41:56] in the name of the lord jesus christ we
[41:58] pray amen
[42:00] amen
[42:08] this woman here the samaritan is it
[42:14] yo they grew up in that land there
[42:19] and they were constantly being told by
[42:22] the pharisees and the sadducees
[42:27] that they really had no right
[42:37] that your dna would not testify that you
[42:40] belong here
[42:44] but you know jesus christ has
[42:47] a different outtake on things
[42:53] there's always those people in any
[42:55] church or
[42:56] or
[43:03] don't have that natural uh
[43:07] confidence in themselves
[43:12] where they uh just lack that
[43:14] self-confidence in who they are
[43:20] you know and as the samaritans grew up
[43:23] in a land
[43:24] welcome
[43:36] when you read the history of it you
[43:37] realize that they really didn't have
[43:38] much of a foundation
[43:40] for their doctrines
[43:45] but yet there is still that chance
[43:52] that little bit of a glimmer of hope
[43:56] that the god of the heavens
[44:00] could look upon them and listen to their
[44:06] cries
[44:08] she said how is it that he's out being a
[44:10] jew
[44:13] would ask drink of me a woman of samaria
[44:19] from samaritan you know the jews don't
[44:21] think much of us
[44:25] they won't eat in our houses
[44:29] if we offer a drink they would throw it
[44:31] on the ground
[44:34] why is it that you're asking me of a
[44:36] drink
[44:38] and jesus looked at her and he answered
[44:43] he said if you knew the gift of god
[44:48] amen you would ask me for a drink
[44:53] i have a drink to give you
[44:58] the water that i give you
[45:01] will cause you so you will never thirst
[45:04] again
[45:08] if you have asked me if you knew who i
[45:10] was
[45:12] you have asked me and i will have given
[45:14] you living water
[45:27] of people that didn't really have much
[45:29] of an expectation
[46:08] you know just a couple generations
[46:10] before ruth came on the scene
[46:22] [Music]
[46:26] but she herself was a moabitus
[46:31] and when the uh the drought came
[46:36] and hard times came in the land of
[46:38] israel the moment
[46:40] israel that they left israel behind
[46:43] it and went to
[46:47] land that was not part of the promise
[46:52] and it was there the only link she had
[46:55] to the land of promise
[47:00] was her husband
[47:03] but her husband died
[47:06] and she lost that that link
[47:36] shall
[47:48] and you count down their generations 10
[47:50] generations
[48:01] they still say you have no hope of the
[48:04] promise
[48:26] there's nothing in here that can inspire
[48:27] confidence that she has any right to
[48:32] jehovah
[48:53] no nothing that could really give her
[48:56] any confidence of where she stood
[49:00] called
[49:14] recall that boaz was threshing there
[49:18] late one night in the threshing floor
[49:23] he got tired he laid himself down to
[49:28] sleep
[49:30] and when he woke up
[49:32] [Music]
[49:33] he was surprised because there was a
[49:36] woman laying at his feet
[49:41] he died
[49:57] and you know as his mind went you know
[49:59] he knows that she is moabite
[50:04] he knows she's not part of the promise
[50:09] in reality she's part of the curse
[50:14] the moabites wouldn't give food and
[50:16] water to moses
[50:24] but yeah here is this woman
[50:29] and she says but i have uh she
[50:32] said just spread your garment over me
[50:38] if you had just spread your garment over
[50:40] me
[50:43] i have one hope of the promise
[50:48] one hope to enter into this promised
[50:50] land
[50:58] my husband who is the one that inherited
[51:00] the promise he's the one that died
[51:04] and you being his relatives
[51:21] boss yes boys something came into his
[51:24] mind
[51:27] he spread his garment
[51:31] and then as she went out she went and
[51:34] spoke to her mother-in-law
[51:37] your mother-in-law says don't you worry
[51:40] you will not rest he is accomplished
[51:46] you know we are a people called the
[51:48] gentiles
[52:01] how could we ever
[52:04] how could we ever have any hope of
[52:06] having any type of an inheritance
[52:12] but if we research back a little bit
[52:14] further messi
[52:16] regarding
[52:29] and we go
[52:44] we know that the only hope that we have
[52:48] it's as if the hero just spread his
[52:50] garment over us
[52:58] and we
[53:11] until he has accomplished everything
[53:15] where the boaz said it was d
[53:18] there is a closer uh
[53:22] a closer relative to you than me yeah um
[53:54] the bride of christ
[53:57] saint paul said look at who god has
[54:01] chosen amongst your ranks
[54:05] not many mighty men not many strong man
[54:11] there's not many rich men among you
[54:14] but god has chosen the weak things of
[54:16] the world
[54:19] the foolish things of the world
[54:22] people that
[54:37] has chosen those people why because the
[54:40] the rich and the mighty of this world
[54:44] the devil himself the spiritual
[54:48] in high and mighty places or the
[54:50] wickedness in high
[54:51] mighty places
[54:56] i've looked at us and said no regarding
[54:58] we don't want you
[55:02] the devil is a the closer relative
[55:15] but when he but when he looked at us and
[55:17] he said i don't want them
[55:32] because we had this link through our
[55:34] husband
[55:37] i went back before the foundation of the
[55:39] world
[55:42] so when satan rejected jesus christ
[55:46] god sent him to the world to the earth
[55:51] satan influenced them on the earth to
[55:53] pick him up and put him back up in the
[55:54] heavens
[55:59] when when the men of the earth did that
[56:04] they not only rejected christ by putting
[56:06] him on the cross
[56:09] they rejected us as well
[56:13] and the only link that we have to the
[56:15] promise
[56:18] is to lay at the feet of boaz
[56:23] lay at the feet of christ
[56:27] say lord spread your skirt over us
[56:31] spread your garment over us lay your
[56:34] holy spirit upon us
[56:37] what's your holy ghost
[56:41] jesus said
[57:10] if we knew the gift of god we would
[57:12] leave the moabite laying behind
[57:15] you if we knew the gift of god we would
[57:20] uh speak to our mother-in-law
[57:24] take
[57:37] my god
[57:52] knows that
[58:20] but it was one a woman of the cursed
[58:22] land of moab
[58:27] could i enter into land for 10
[58:29] generations
[58:33] but there is something down inside of
[58:35] her heart that went
[58:36] back before the curse
[58:42] that the curse could have no effect on
[58:44] her
[58:47] oh you know the curse might have have
[58:48] had its way with this
[58:50] with this body of ours
[58:55] with this mind of ours
[58:59] we struggle with temptations
[59:14] there is something down on the inside of
[59:16] us
[59:29] way back before the foundation of the
[59:31] world
[59:34] it's at that hope it's that chance
[59:37] to say that no matter what our mind
[59:39] tells us
[59:41] no matter what our body tells us that we
[59:44] have
[59:51] [Music]
[1:00:00] if you only knew the gift of god
[1:00:03] if you only knew it could catch the
[1:00:05] revelation of who you are
[1:00:08] you would run crying out to him lord
[1:00:10] give me a drink
[1:00:54] of the world rejected them
[1:00:58] when they rejected christ
[1:01:01] when i stood up when christ was rejected
[1:01:07] she was rejected
[1:01:20] and because she was known by my name on
[1:01:22] the earth
[1:01:36] when she received my name
[1:01:40] when she stood up in the midst of
[1:01:41] persecution
[1:01:46] and claimed the name of christ
[1:01:50] and raised her hand and said i received
[1:01:52] the blood of the lord jesus christ
[1:01:56] the sacrifice for my sins when she went
[1:01:59] down to the waters of baptism
[1:02:03] i was baptized in the name of the lord
[1:02:04] jesus christ
[1:02:08] when she came up and walked in newness
[1:02:10] of life
[1:02:13] and uh the afflictions of the flesh
[1:02:16] the sins of this mind could
[1:03:01] spoke to adam there in the garden of
[1:03:04] eden
[1:03:07] and said that the ground is cursed for
[1:03:11] your sake
[1:03:13] when you put your seeds in the ground
[1:03:18] and hope for a garden to spring up
[1:03:22] it'll bear thorns and thistles instead
[1:03:26] and the works of your hands will be
[1:03:28] cursed
[1:03:42] he took the crown of the fruits of the
[1:03:43] curse upon himself
[1:03:48] the fruits of our hands will be cursed
[1:03:55] amen why he took the curse upon himself
[1:04:02] the curse of death the curse of our
[1:04:06] labors
[1:04:08] the curse of the sweat of our brown
[1:04:24] if you only knew the gift of god
[1:04:29] you would lay yourself with your feet
[1:04:34] and say lord spread your skirt over me
[1:04:38] let your holy spirit be upon me
[1:04:42] i've been called by your name been
[1:04:45] baptized in your name
[1:04:47] i've received your name upon my forehead
[1:04:51] and now i have need for you to answer
[1:05:05] the works of my hands are failing
[1:05:07] elizabeth
[1:05:09] now i need uh the the the the relative
[1:05:12] the only one that would claim me the
[1:05:15] only one that would speak for me
[1:05:18] the only one never come for me
[1:05:35] we are living in a day of the
[1:05:36] restoration of all things
[1:05:42] that's a powerful time to live in
[1:05:46] jesus told his disciples
[1:05:57] have agonized and dreamed and wanted
[1:06:00] and desire to look upon this day
[1:06:09] there's kings and prophets that wish
[1:06:11] they could have lived in this day and
[1:06:12] see the things that you see
[1:06:14] [Music]
[1:06:15] the prophet
[1:06:26] and there are many men in the 1700s they
[1:06:28] were agonizing in prayer over
[1:06:30] candlelight
[1:06:43] of the book of revelations
[1:06:58] martin luther martin luther and john
[1:07:01] wesley
[1:07:03] desire to see these things see these
[1:07:05] days
[1:07:08] even though it was in azusa street
[1:07:12] i saw the restoration
[1:07:23] many mighty men in the church that wish
[1:07:26] the desire that labored and didn't get
[1:07:28] to see the fruits of their labor
[1:07:30] dome
[1:07:37] but we're living in a day
[1:07:40] at the end
[1:08:06] will be torn apart because the love of
[1:08:08] christ has left the people
[1:08:10] the nation
[1:08:14] no longer be uh uh do unto others as
[1:08:18] you'd have them do unto you
[1:08:25] the basic decency of the gospel has left
[1:08:28] the land
[1:08:35] and because they rejected the holy ghost
[1:08:40] they rejected their only chance at peace
[1:08:42] and prosperity
[1:08:47] it's like brother graham says like a boy
[1:08:49] whistling to the graveyard
[1:08:55] you know you're scared
[1:08:59] going to the graveyard at midnight
[1:09:04] trying to whistle to make yourself feel
[1:09:06] better
[1:09:06] [Music]
[1:09:09] you know you're scared and so is this
[1:09:12] world they're running scared
[1:09:16] they they're they're afraid they don't
[1:09:19] know what the next
[1:09:20] uh problem will be
[1:09:24] the problem we'll have terrorist attacks
[1:09:28] one year the next year we'll have
[1:09:31] wildfires
[1:09:42] new orleans well right now drinking
[1:09:44] water a
[1:09:45] new orleans des moines has run out of
[1:09:48] drinking water back in 93.
[1:09:54] most of texas is out drinking water
[1:09:58] but jesus said if you knew who you are
[1:10:00] speaking
[1:10:09] [Music]
[1:10:27] go meet the bridegroom
[1:10:42] but the anointing doesn't come to it at
[1:10:44] all
[1:10:47] and the day will come all over this
[1:10:51] land don't sit there when all of these
[1:10:54] plagues
[1:10:56] will no longer come year after year
[1:10:58] after year
[1:11:01] but they'll come day after day after
[1:11:03] that
[1:11:06] and men's hearts will begin failing for
[1:11:10] fear
[1:11:12] will no longer be just wildfires this
[1:11:14] year
[1:11:16] hurricanes the next year you see the
[1:11:18] trumpet
[1:11:20] but it'll be day after day after days
[1:11:26] and it will drive men to go back to the
[1:11:30] their intelligence will fail
[1:11:35] their science will fail
[1:11:40] their problems will be greater than
[1:11:42] their devices
[1:11:43] no problem
[1:11:47] their problems will be greater than
[1:11:49] their engineering
[1:11:54] their problems be greater than what the
[1:11:57] the the scientists and the engineers and
[1:11:59] the the mighty men can think of
[1:12:02] zombies brother brown says you could put
[1:12:06] a george washington and abraham lincoln
[1:12:08] in every city across the land
[1:12:10] if i come from america um
[1:12:15] george washington or album lincoln but
[1:12:18] it won't do any good
[1:12:33] if your lamp is empty
[1:12:42] matthew 25 come on my treatment tank
[1:12:45] there was 10 virgins
[1:12:48] they
[1:13:02] a position of greatness in position
[1:13:05] only so many were chosen for that
[1:13:08] purpose
[1:13:11] objective and these ten were called
[1:13:28] to shine light all the way to the
[1:13:30] wedding
[1:14:17] but as they all fell asleep become
[1:14:20] instituted
[1:14:22] they slumbered and they slept it it's
[1:14:24] certainty deposited
[1:14:26] that there
[1:14:38] and the reason they were wise the reason
[1:15:10] and so they wanted to make sure that
[1:15:12] they had another source of oil
[1:15:19] so that if their lamp if he was a long
[1:15:22] time incoming
[1:15:27] that no matter how long it was it took
[1:15:29] him to get there
[1:15:34] if their lamp should run out of oil
[1:15:39] that they already knew where to go to
[1:15:41] get more oil
[1:15:46] because they didn't know how long it
[1:15:48] would take for him to get there
[1:16:00] to be found doing exactly what they were
[1:16:03] called to do
[1:16:17] all the way to the wedding
[1:16:46] they picked up the word
[1:16:52] and they went to get it ready
[1:16:56] but where is that holy spirit
[1:17:16] now all of her abilities were there
[1:17:20] she had her wedding garment on the villa
[1:17:23] she had her word with her
[1:17:27] she could walk
[1:17:40] but when she went to take the flame to
[1:17:44] the lamp
[1:17:48] there was no holy ghost to make the word
[1:17:50] work
[1:17:54] there was no holy spirit when she'd
[1:17:56] leave through the pages there was
[1:17:59] it was just a dead letter to her
[1:18:05] she could no longer make it hers
[1:18:09] she couldn't find her name in the book
[1:18:11] anymore
[1:18:15] why because she didn't have that holy
[1:18:18] ghost
[1:18:21] and she looked the foolish versions
[1:18:23] looked to the wise virgins
[1:18:28] they said give us of your oil because
[1:18:30] our oil has ran
[1:18:31] out of water
[1:18:37] she said go to those that buy and sell
[1:18:40] i just have just enough for me
[1:18:46] for many years for many are called
[1:18:50] but few are chosen
[1:18:55] but if those that were called knew the
[1:18:57] gift of god that was before them
[1:19:01] they would cry out day or night give us
[1:19:04] of this oil lord
[1:19:18] that i know where to go to get a
[1:19:20] refilling
[1:19:45] [Music]
[1:19:48] to the
[1:20:00] how to get to the throne of god
[1:20:16] i used to pray like this you see
[1:20:20] there's a way to the throne of god
[1:20:21] somewhere around here
[1:20:25] i used to be able to connect with god in
[1:20:27] prayer
[1:20:29] no i don't quite remember how
[1:20:32] it's been so long since i've been in his
[1:20:34] presence
[1:20:36] it's been so long since i i had that
[1:20:39] experience with christ
[1:20:40] in prayer
[1:20:44] all my testimonies are now 10 years old
[1:20:46] if anything god's ever done for me
[1:20:52] i don't remember what it's like for god
[1:20:53] to give me a revelation of anything
[1:20:58] now i'm in a time of need and i don't
[1:21:00] remember how to get to the lord in
[1:21:02] prayer anymore
[1:21:05] it just seems like the way is hidden to
[1:21:07] me
[1:21:10] you know the bride of christ isn't
[1:21:11] supposed to be like that
[1:21:26] a wife a true bride
[1:21:31] has a sacred virtue
[1:21:35] that she must not defile
[1:21:41] and he said just like the uh bride
[1:21:46] so does the church dimension
[1:21:49] has a sacred the sacred duty
[1:21:56] a sacred duty to prayer on divorce
[1:22:00] to the word and to jesus christ
[1:22:06] and those must not be defiled
[1:22:36] all the way
[1:22:48] the same one that was crucified on
[1:22:50] calvary
[1:23:03] through your
[1:23:33] jesus the anointed one
[1:23:36] amen
[1:23:44] let's turn over to the book of hey guy
[1:23:46] chapter one alone
[1:24:07] it's the third to last
[1:24:10] book of the old testament
[1:24:36] i know i preached on this a long time
[1:24:37] ago
[1:24:40] but i just want to read the first six
[1:24:42] words
[1:24:56] the first six words say
[1:25:00] and i called for a drought
[1:25:07] hey you know that is such a small little
[1:25:10] bit of text
[1:25:11] sorry do you remember brother brandon
[1:25:15] i've always had that little
[1:25:16] story about the postage stamp
[1:25:21] you would read that's a little text
[1:25:34] they give the story about the boy who
[1:25:36] found the postage stamp in the attic
[1:26:03] that man turned around solar for uh ten
[1:26:06] thousand dollars
[1:26:10] it wasn't necessarily the paper
[1:26:14] papier was what was written on the paper
[1:26:18] these six words here
[1:26:25] it may not seem like much
[1:26:30] but you know where i work
[1:26:47] whenever you write a letter to a large
[1:26:49] audience
[1:26:53] you have to make sure that you're
[1:26:54] answering all the questions beforehand
[1:27:00] they have a little thing that you can go
[1:27:03] through to make sure you've
[1:27:04] written a thorough communication
[1:27:09] community and they call it the who what
[1:27:11] why where when how
[1:27:13] that's gonna be right
[1:27:16] is
[1:27:28] if you're if you could read through your
[1:27:30] email
[1:27:57] it's not much good to the person that
[1:27:59] you send it
[1:28:03] but when you apply that to this verse
[1:28:07] you say well who is it that is calling
[1:28:09] for this drought
[1:28:24] the one that stood there in john chapter
[1:28:27] 7
[1:28:29] in the temple on the day of tabernacle
[1:28:31] tabernacles
[1:28:34] and cry out in the set if any man a
[1:28:38] thirst
[1:28:40] let him come to me and drink this
[1:28:44] the same one in john 4.
[1:28:49] if you knew the gift of god you would
[1:28:52] ask me for a drink
[1:29:20] or is he speaking to uh you know someone
[1:29:23] is
[1:29:24] trying to do them great
[1:29:29] no no he's speaking to his own children
[1:29:34] of israel
[1:29:38] you think well maybe they're uh living
[1:29:40] off or in babylon or
[1:29:42] in egypt somewhere
[1:29:47] where are they no they're living in the
[1:29:51] very promised land
[1:29:52] no evie
[1:29:57] they think well
[1:30:01] when what time what when is this
[1:30:02] happening you know is this happening
[1:30:04] when they're
[1:30:05] maybe this is during the time when
[1:30:06] they're uh
[1:30:09] have been in idolatry
[1:30:17] no they were living in a day of
[1:30:18] restoration
[1:30:24] [Music]
[1:30:30] 16 years before this verse
[1:30:35] they had been given a commandment
[1:30:40] leave babylon
[1:30:44] go back to jerusalem
[1:31:00] just go go back to your land
[1:31:05] go back to your god worship him truly
[1:31:10] here's some money here's some gold
[1:31:26] whatever it takes just go get it done
[1:31:54] but 16 years after they get back you get
[1:31:57] to the book of hager
[1:32:02] are you looking nothing's been built
[1:32:06] everybody's built their own houses
[1:32:24] in 16
[1:32:38] themselves
[1:33:06] if
[1:33:19] get out of these denominations
[1:33:22] go and gather yourselves together
[1:33:26] serve the revealed word of the lord
[1:33:28] jesus christ
[1:33:31] miracles and signs and wonders
[1:33:34] just go and worship the god of your
[1:33:36] fathers
[1:33:38] go and worship the lord jesus christ
[1:33:42] and we get here and we gather together
[1:33:44] in this little church
[1:34:04] [Music]
[1:34:12] and people will say oh i just feel so
[1:34:15] dry it
[1:34:17] i is can't seem to pray anymore
[1:34:21] i don't enjoy reading my bible anymore
[1:34:25] oh are we having two services today
[1:34:29] i don't want to come to church anymore
[1:34:32] and all these different things
[1:34:37] and we get home and we don't even desire
[1:34:41] to do anything at home
[1:34:43] for christmas
[1:34:58] but of the holy spirit in your life
[1:35:01] the only thing that gives you a power to
[1:35:03] do anything that has eternal
[1:35:04] significance
[1:35:10] let me tell you saints
[1:35:26] there is not one thing that we have done
[1:35:29] that we are going to get rewarded for
[1:35:35] will only be rewarded for the things
[1:35:37] that we allow the holy spirit to do in
[1:35:38] our lives
[1:35:55] because we can gather all the money in
[1:35:57] the world
[1:36:00] all the things that bring you joy in
[1:36:01] this life
[1:36:05] we can gather all those things together
[1:36:18] and there are things in heaven that are
[1:36:19] more real than the things here on earth
[1:36:33] if you want to hear those words great is
[1:36:35] your reward my good and faithful servant
[1:36:43] you have to allow the holy spirit to
[1:36:45] work in your lives
[1:36:49] but if in this day of restoration
[1:36:53] where we've been given all things
[1:36:57] if in this day we drag our feet and
[1:37:01] refuse to allow the holy spirit to
[1:37:03] rebuild his temple in our hearts
[1:37:23] amen
[1:37:29] let's just stand up
[1:37:43] but we're not here to be that way
[1:37:52] [Music]
[1:38:09] what would he ever see in me
[1:38:13] what would the holy spirit ever see that
[1:38:15] would he'd have a desire
[1:38:17] to work in me
[1:38:21] [Music]
[1:38:23] well there's a greater promise
[1:38:27] it goes beyond being a gentile
[1:38:31] or laodicean
[1:38:38] being beyond being lukewarm and cold
[1:38:46] [Music]
[1:39:09] they'll be the wise virgins
[1:39:13] that when christ returns
[1:39:17] they'll be shining rightly ready to do
[1:39:20] anything that the holy spirit tells them
[1:39:22] to do
[1:39:29] [Music]
[1:39:36] just one little node
[1:39:40] one little nod from jesus christ
[1:39:45] they're out about their father's
[1:39:46] business
[1:39:49] so ought to be for the bride of christ
[1:39:58] [Music]
[1:40:06] is me what was me
[1:40:07] [Music]
[1:40:10] i'm a man of unclean lips
