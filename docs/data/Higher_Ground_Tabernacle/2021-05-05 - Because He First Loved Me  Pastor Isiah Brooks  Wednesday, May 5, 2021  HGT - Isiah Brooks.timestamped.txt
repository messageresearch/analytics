[17:35] oh god gave us his son oh
[17:38] god gave us a sign
[17:41] on the wings of
[17:45] [Music]
[17:55] [Music]
[18:12] the snow white up
[18:17] oh god send his pure
[18:21] sweet love a sign from
[18:25] above a sign
[18:35] though i have suffered
[18:40] in many a way
[18:46] i cried for him
[19:02] [Music]
[19:09] oh above gave me oh
[19:12] he gave me his sign on the wings
[19:16] oh on the wings of
[19:20] her dove on the wings of
[19:26] [Music]
[20:01] above on the wings
[20:09] [Music]
[20:18] away
[20:20] i cried for healing
[20:35] [Music]
[20:46] god gave us
[21:06] [Music]
[21:14] oh
[22:02] sorry about that thank you god it's good
[22:05] to us amen
[22:07] yeah uh not prolonging the time
[22:10] how we ask that you turn with us to
[22:12] first john the fourth chapter
[22:14] like i said i'm glad to see everybody
[22:16] here those who could
[22:18] who could be here we know that the
[22:21] um hour is late and it's always good to
[22:24] be able to come to the house of god and
[22:28] as the scripture says if you really
[22:30] truly born again the bible says forsake
[22:33] not to coming together
[22:36] especially when you see that day
[22:38] approaching
[22:39] brother random tells us that the bride
[22:41] will always recognize the day that she's
[22:43] living
[22:44] in and so we know that we're living in a
[22:47] terrible time
[22:50] a time that is anointed by the spirit of
[22:53] destruction
[22:54] but there is an anointing another
[22:56] anointing that is
[22:58] we will translate us we call it the
[23:02] rapture and i believe with all my heart
[23:05] that is where we
[23:06] are uh the sad news is that there will
[23:09] be
[23:09] many people who think they're going and
[23:12] will not
[23:13] uh due to the very fact that they have
[23:15] been deceived and believing
[23:18] that they have been born again and so we
[23:21] don't want to be deceived
[23:24] in this age because satan is a liar
[23:27] and he knows how to deceive so we want
[23:30] to make sure that our life is measuring
[23:33] up to the word
[23:34] not by human effort but by the power and
[23:38] strength
[23:39] of the holy ghost so we're going to be
[23:42] coming by god's grace from first
[23:44] john the fourth chapter and the 19th
[23:47] [Music]
[23:48] verse
[23:52] you love the lord we'll really
[23:56] appreciate the lord for what he has done
[23:58] and
[23:58] is doing for us
[24:07] yes lord
[24:10] there's one scripture i guess i forgot
[24:12] to
[24:14] write down the music can i find it
[24:16] quickly
[24:20] we have been uh we are blessed people
[24:40] never mind we'll just go ahead with this
[24:41] particular scripture
[24:43] and then god will direct us on where to
[24:46] go
[24:46] from there the scripture it reads
[24:50] we love him because he
[24:53] first loved
[24:56] us let us pray father we so thank you
[24:59] for your grace and your mercy
[25:02] we thank you for being so good to us
[25:05] lord you have been better to us than
[25:07] we've been to ourselves
[25:09] and father what can we say other than
[25:11] thank you
[25:12] we thank you for being good to us lord
[25:15] we pray lord god this evening that you
[25:18] you would have preeminence in our lives
[25:21] and uh we pray that you would bless the
[25:24] people that are here tonight
[25:26] uh we pray that you give them something
[25:29] more than what they had before they came
[25:34] and that they would leave out knowing
[25:35] that they have been spoken to you
[25:37] spoken to themself spoken to you
[25:40] from you by god's grace thank you lord
[25:43] thank you for your grace thank you for
[25:44] your mercy
[25:45] in jesus christ's name we pray amen you
[25:48] may be seated
[25:51] i know my subject seems a little
[25:53] different but uh
[25:55] we're literally and we're gonna be
[25:56] dealing basically with
[25:59] being born again in the holy ghost
[26:02] um this is the thing that i see that
[26:04] people are lacking
[26:07] some people have been born again but
[26:09] they're not moving forward they're
[26:12] backslidden and don't know that they are
[26:15] and there are those who know that they
[26:17] are but they won't do anything about it
[26:21] we are living in a time when god is
[26:24] wooing us and moving in us and some of
[26:28] the things that i've learned
[26:29] in these past few days i guess i've
[26:32] never
[26:32] thought about it often times we
[26:36] think because god is blessing us that
[26:38] god is with us and
[26:41] israel was a true example of how god can
[26:44] truly bless you and not be with you
[26:46] uh the the essence of this message
[26:50] is to make sure you have the life of
[26:53] christ
[26:54] in you um
[26:58] you know we we talk about going and
[27:01] seeking the holy ghost and
[27:03] and you know you know i i just never
[27:05] thought of it in the way that
[27:07] uh it was brought to me i guess my son
[27:09] kind of shared some things with me that
[27:11] really began to got me had me thinking
[27:14] and
[27:15] um basically
[27:18] what is god to you i mean
[27:21] why are you seeking god
[27:26] basically are you seeking god uh seeking
[27:28] things for yourself you know because
[27:30] some christians they
[27:31] they can eagerly easily quote the
[27:34] scripture you know
[27:35] you know ass seek and knock you know but
[27:38] uh
[27:38] when you ask and when you seek and when
[27:40] you knock
[27:41] what are you what are you going to him
[27:44] for
[27:45] are you seeking things for yourself
[27:49] instead of seeking things
[27:52] to be a great person in christ
[27:55] why are we seeking what are we seeking
[27:58] you know god wants you to put to know
[28:02] him and it is
[28:03] not what we what he can give
[28:06] you you must seek but what you can give
[28:10] him instead
[28:13] if you come seeking what you can what
[28:16] can you gain from god
[28:20] you have never and perhaps never will
[28:23] come to know him
[28:24] if you're coming to just gain
[28:27] from him now i want you to understand
[28:30] what i'm trying to say
[28:34] because when we come to god as
[28:37] should be more than one reason some
[28:40] people come to god just because
[28:45] they want something from him they they
[28:47] want him to be an errand boy
[28:50] and i know that this sounds a little uh
[28:52] elementary
[28:54] but one thing i want to say tonight is
[28:57] that
[28:58] you'll never get the god you want
[29:03] until you're willing to surrender
[29:07] you must come to a place that you're
[29:09] willing to die
[29:12] because he died for you that's the thing
[29:14] he loved us
[29:15] because he loved us and how did he prove
[29:18] to
[29:18] prove his love by way of calvary
[29:22] by way of death by surrendering all of
[29:24] his life
[29:26] that we may gain life that's how he
[29:28] loved
[29:29] us and so therefore we love him
[29:33] paul said i'm crucified with christ
[29:36] that means i've gone to calvary i've met
[29:39] him there
[29:41] he said i just don't want to just know
[29:43] him but i want to know him
[29:44] also in the power of his resurrection
[29:48] not mine when i die unto myself when i
[29:51] die
[29:51] unto me i want christ to live
[29:55] not me and that's a lot said in that
[29:58] because
[29:59] oftentimes we have christians who want
[30:02] to hold on to the world and hold on to
[30:04] christ too
[30:05] and those two worlds can't they don't
[30:07] blend
[30:09] light and darkness cannot mix
[30:12] brother adam said and you must be born
[30:14] again he said may we be
[30:17] thirsty and he's he's he's saying these
[30:20] things because
[30:21] he's describing a wounded deer
[30:24] that's literally running and trying to
[30:27] find water
[30:28] to survive he said may we be that
[30:32] thirsty lord
[30:33] that we must have christ if we exist
[30:37] we must have christ if we become the
[30:41] church
[30:43] that we're asking for if we live
[30:46] the lives that we are wanting to live
[30:49] we must have christ or we
[30:53] will die there's no such thing
[30:56] as not having the holy ghost and making
[30:58] the rapture
[31:00] hallelujah there's no such thing as
[31:02] being having the holy ghost
[31:04] amen and and saying not having the holy
[31:07] ghost excuse me
[31:07] and saying that you love him because
[31:10] first of all
[31:11] you can't love him without the holy
[31:14] ghost
[31:16] you can't even live until you die that
[31:19] is the law
[31:20] everything must die in order to live
[31:23] corn no matter what it may be death is a
[31:26] part of life
[31:28] in the sense of your resurrection in
[31:31] this life
[31:32] wasn't so in the beginning but death
[31:36] you must die in order to live
[31:40] what must i do to inherit
[31:44] eternal life and i'm just going slowly
[31:47] because i want you to know there's a
[31:48] price to pay
[31:50] but everybody wants to turn over a new
[31:53] leaf god don't ask for no new leaf
[31:56] god had asked him for a new life he's
[31:59] not as
[32:00] telling you to take the life that you
[32:01] have and patch it up and extend it
[32:04] no you were born a man or born a woman
[32:07] in the natural and god told nicodemus
[32:10] you must be
[32:11] born again brother brooks this is
[32:14] elementary but i'm telling you
[32:17] there are a lot of people in this
[32:19] message
[32:20] who have been who have been birthed into
[32:22] a system
[32:24] and not into christ the system will not
[32:27] work
[32:28] right i mean it's like baptist methodist
[32:31] presbyterian pentecostal
[32:32] whatever you name it they've been
[32:34] birthed into a system
[32:36] uh a corruptible seed but the seed i'm
[32:39] talking about is
[32:40] incorruptible and not only that seed
[32:43] comes our way
[32:44] of the christ of today
[32:47] hallelujah there is a price and are you
[32:50] willing to pay it
[32:52] you see to inherit internal life it
[32:55] means to surrender all
[32:58] everything all your thoughts
[33:02] everything that you think means anything
[33:04] to you it really means to
[33:05] surrender all for an example when a man
[33:09] dies he surrenders
[33:12] he's left with nothing right he can't
[33:15] carry
[33:16] anything with him everything he ever had
[33:19] is left behind
[33:21] and so you must understand when you
[33:23] truly give up to god
[33:25] this world means nothing to you
[33:28] now we know we have to live in it we've
[33:30] subject to vanity
[33:32] that's not what i'm talking about but
[33:34] i'm saying amen when we give up to god
[33:36] you say well i love god
[33:38] let me ask you a question how can you
[33:41] love him if you don't
[33:42] know him you got to know him before you
[33:46] could love him
[33:49] he said oh i so love him is it christ
[33:51] you're loving
[33:53] or is it the system that you are loving
[33:57] oh oh this is my church your church you
[34:01] can you see what i'm trying to say there
[34:03] are so many people
[34:05] who can do it just right in the message
[34:07] and they still have not been born again
[34:10] all you got to do is cross them up one
[34:12] time
[34:13] and they flip on you right
[34:16] yes you see the nature once you put
[34:20] pressure on them
[34:21] it it explodes that's not christ
[34:26] so what's in the house if jesus is not
[34:30] in there
[34:31] who's in the house
[34:34] um mark 10 17-27 says
[34:39] pic speaking of the rich young rule i
[34:40] want you to understand he had to
[34:41] surrender
[34:42] unto the lord right and god didn't ask
[34:46] him nothing he was the one that asked
[34:48] jesus
[34:49] what must i do and when he was going
[34:52] forth into the way
[34:53] there came one running and kneeled to
[34:56] him and
[34:57] asked him good master what shall i do
[35:00] that i might inherit
[35:01] eternal life and jesus said unto him why
[35:05] call it thou me good there is none
[35:08] good but one that is god now i want to
[35:11] say this before i forget it it's just
[35:12] impressing on my mind
[35:14] brother branham said death does not
[35:16] change
[35:17] who you are if you are a bad
[35:20] person here if you're about the lust and
[35:22] if you're about to do
[35:23] you know the worldly things when you die
[35:26] you don't change into an angel
[35:29] your nature takes you to your destiny
[35:33] hello somebody and that's the problem a
[35:36] lot of people don't understand
[35:37] they figure oh i'm in the message and i
[35:39] got grace and you know like oh i'm
[35:41] justified as those nothing
[35:42] you know but you've got to have the holy
[35:44] ghost
[35:46] in order to be justified as though
[35:48] you've never sinned before
[35:49] the covenant must be uh how can i say it
[35:53] it must be approved in other words you
[35:55] must be accepted by jesus christ
[35:57] for that to apply to you
[36:01] and how you are accepted by jesus christ
[36:03] when he comes and gives you the holy
[36:05] ghost
[36:06] brother said that is god except oh i
[36:09] accept god
[36:10] that's good but it's whether he accept
[36:13] you
[36:14] that's what you want you want him to
[36:16] accept you because when he gives you the
[36:18] holy ghost
[36:19] amen that is his acceptance
[36:22] don't get me confused don't get confused
[36:24] in what i'm trying to say
[36:26] because when a person is born again he's
[36:28] never he's not born a man
[36:31] he's born a baby therefore he has to
[36:35] grow up
[36:37] into christ there's a maturing
[36:40] but you see he changes parents
[36:44] like brother brown said i am no longer
[36:46] amen the son of
[36:47] of of of the branhams
[36:50] my father is jesus christ and when
[36:53] you're
[36:54] born again you literally change parents
[36:58] the holy ghost which is the headship he
[37:00] becomes your parent
[37:02] he becomes your tutor he becomes your
[37:05] guide
[37:07] now listen it goes on and says thou
[37:09] knoweth
[37:11] the commandments and jesus
[37:15] said unto him why call it thou me good
[37:19] well there is none good but one that is
[37:22] god
[37:22] thou knoweth the commandments do not
[37:24] commit adultery do not kill do not steal
[37:27] do not bear false witness defraud not
[37:29] honor thy father and mother
[37:31] now can i say it like this he
[37:35] did the ten commandments still was not
[37:39] saved it ain't your goodness it ain't
[37:43] your works
[37:45] it's the working of the holy ghost that
[37:47] saves you right
[37:50] and he answered and said unto him master
[37:53] all these
[37:54] i have i observed from my youth here it
[37:57] is
[37:58] then jesus beholding him
[38:02] loved him right
[38:08] i love him because he first loved me
[38:12] and said unto him one thing thou
[38:15] lackett go thy way in other words god
[38:19] don't
[38:19] god is not interested in your rituals
[38:23] you understand me a dub don't have to
[38:25] perform
[38:27] to to to to make you see it is a dove
[38:30] a lamb doesn't have to perform a lamb is
[38:33] a lamb
[38:34] the nature of a lamb carries the lambs
[38:36] it is the very life of the lamb
[38:38] like the nature of the dove is the life
[38:40] of the dove
[38:41] hallelujah y'all understand me it can't
[38:44] be
[38:45] mixed natures right
[38:48] it can't be sweet waters and bitter
[38:50] waters
[38:52] it can't be seen in in god too
[38:56] one must live the other one must die
[39:00] right and he says go
[39:04] sell this is it this is it go thy way
[39:07] sell whatsoever thou hast and give to
[39:10] the poor
[39:10] and thou shalt have treasure in heaven
[39:13] and
[39:14] come take up thy cross and follow
[39:17] me brother said god was calling the man
[39:20] to ministry
[39:21] so even when he was in hell or down in
[39:24] that region where
[39:25] where where where john uh he saw john in
[39:29] the
[39:29] bosom of abraham uh
[39:32] uh he said lord he said john can i
[39:36] send my brothers up there right
[39:40] he had that but i said he had that
[39:42] evangelistical spirit on him
[39:44] even in the region of the lost but he
[39:47] failed to take
[39:48] god's commission you know what he wanted
[39:51] something from god
[39:53] but he didn't want to give god himself
[39:56] see god didn't want his riches
[39:58] god wanted him you understand me god
[40:01] don't care about your tithing your
[40:03] offering
[40:03] and whatever you can give him it's fine
[40:06] it is a word
[40:07] but that's not what god wants he wants
[40:09] you
[40:10] that's how it was with samson brother
[40:13] said god
[40:14] samson gave god his strength god didn't
[40:17] want his strength
[40:18] god wanted his heart god wants your
[40:22] heart
[40:24] whatsoever thou hast give to the poor
[40:26] and thou shalt have treasure in heaven
[40:28] and come take up i call him i call him
[40:31] john but it's lazarus i apologize for
[40:34] that
[40:34] lazarus he saw lazarus in the bosom of
[40:37] abraham not john forgive me on that
[40:39] and he was sad at that saying and went
[40:43] away
[40:43] grieved for he had great possessions
[40:48] what will you do with his love you
[40:50] understand me
[40:52] here was this young man saw jesus heard
[40:54] it must have heard of his reputation
[40:56] he runs to jesus kneels down to him
[40:59] and worships him literally worshipped
[41:03] him
[41:03] wasn't ashamed to worship him in front
[41:06] of all of the critics
[41:07] but when god asked him after he had done
[41:11] all those things
[41:12] to sell that all that he had can you
[41:14] understand me he put
[41:16] his vision on the wrong thing he saw his
[41:20] vision on his possessions kind of like
[41:23] amen when
[41:24] when god was calling you know lot out of
[41:26] out of sodom and
[41:28] and and here the he his wife had to turn
[41:31] because of her possessions
[41:33] and you know the saddest thing is that's
[41:35] the problem
[41:37] there's so many people and that we
[41:38] forget that this is laodicea
[41:41] we forgot that this is the age of
[41:42] prosperity we forget that
[41:45] that she's rich and increased with good
[41:47] and have needed nothing
[41:49] we forget and you can see that there's
[41:50] so many people who
[41:52] who's forgotten because you see how many
[41:54] empty seats that we have tonight
[41:57] you see they're just not they're carried
[41:59] away with the world
[42:00] and they think that they're going to
[42:02] take the world with you but it is
[42:04] evident the world
[42:05] leaves you you leave the world when you
[42:07] die
[42:08] nothing goes with you doesn't matter if
[42:10] they pack
[42:11] all kinds of goals and jewelries and
[42:14] everything in your coffin
[42:16] it'll be there for the grave robbers
[42:18] because you cannot carry
[42:20] anything with you that's the thing
[42:23] and i you know i'm i'm looking at this
[42:26] thing and
[42:27] you know uh people don't understand god
[42:30] wants you to prosper
[42:32] but the bible says uh that he desired
[42:35] you to prosper even as your soul
[42:38] prosper because he knows prosperity can
[42:41] destroy you
[42:42] but if your soul is prospering in god
[42:45] and you're becoming mature as you go on
[42:47] in life
[42:47] you know god will give you 2 million 3
[42:49] million and it won't even
[42:50] it won't even bother you because he
[42:53] jesus christ is your first love
[42:56] so don't ever think that god intended
[42:57] for you to be poor the thing is
[42:59] god must come first he must come first
[43:02] and when he comes first that's a little
[43:05] evidence that you love him
[43:07] how can you love this is the question
[43:09] how i say it again
[43:10] how can you love him if you don't know
[43:13] him
[43:14] you got to know him and he must come to
[43:17] know you
[43:17] because i'm just going to move on the
[43:19] way remember those preachers and
[43:20] evangelists and everybody that came to
[43:22] him and says lord
[43:23] have we not cast out devils in your name
[43:25] lord have we not done this and done that
[43:27] and
[43:28] you know our eyes are blind open he said
[43:30] depart from me
[43:32] you workers of iniquity i do not know
[43:34] you
[43:35] that means he never had an intimate
[43:37] relationship with them
[43:39] yet they held the title of christianity
[43:43] but they were fake they were false they
[43:46] never came to a real birth
[43:48] you understand me this is not something
[43:51] that you should take lightly
[43:53] because god didn't give us an option
[43:56] he told nicodemus you must be born
[43:59] again and this is what i've always said
[44:01] lord i said god don't ever let me be
[44:03] like
[44:04] israel that's all these miraculous
[44:06] things and still was lost
[44:09] what good is to see the pill of fire to
[44:11] see somebody here from cancer
[44:12] rage from the dead or whatever the case
[44:14] may be what good is that
[44:16] if you're not born again right
[44:20] you got to know him from the inside out
[44:23] right and you got to make sure lord am i
[44:26] am i
[44:26] am i married to a system or do i am i
[44:29] am i really born again here's one of the
[44:32] tests
[44:33] when brother bannon was truly born again
[44:36] he could love
[44:38] everybody he could speak good
[44:43] of everybody he said if you if you can't
[44:46] say nothing good
[44:47] don't say it he also
[44:50] was able to love the brethren even
[44:53] though they were not a part
[44:56] of his
[44:59] system or denomination or whatever
[45:01] because he wasn't a part of a system
[45:02] but he saw those brothers that were
[45:05] right he loved them still
[45:07] even though they differed from him
[45:12] see love does not seeketh her own this
[45:15] is why i ask you
[45:16] what are you seeking if you truly got
[45:18] the love of god in you you're not
[45:20] seeking your own
[45:21] you're seeking the will of god
[45:24] acknowledging him
[45:25] in all of his ways now i know this
[45:27] sounds simple but i'm preaching you a
[45:29] headstone message
[45:31] this may seem like it's not but it is
[45:33] right
[45:34] because whatever they had in the early
[45:36] church we must have that
[45:38] too and the bible said they knew that
[45:40] they would love
[45:41] they were god's disciples christ's
[45:43] disciples why because of the love that
[45:45] they had
[45:46] one for another it was sacrificial love
[45:49] when one got sick or got in trouble the
[45:52] whole church came together
[45:54] and they prayed until god answered right
[45:56] now somebody can get sick and
[45:58] you know people say oh they'll get over
[46:00] it they just don't have the compassion
[46:02] they don't have the love
[46:03] and people can miss service and
[46:04] everything else and nobody goes to look
[46:06] for them
[46:07] because they feel like oh it's the
[46:09] shepherd's job
[46:11] that's kind of like the way cain felt
[46:13] right
[46:14] am i my brother's keeper to answer that
[46:18] yes you are
[46:20] it ain't just a pastor's job you love
[46:23] the lord
[46:24] here is it love not that we love god but
[46:27] that he loved
[46:28] us and sent his son to be
[46:31] the perpetuation for our sins you can
[46:34] ask somebody right now about calvary
[46:36] and they can't even explain it to you
[46:39] never been to calvary
[46:41] but they're christians how can you be a
[46:43] christian
[46:44] and don't understand the power of
[46:46] calvary
[46:48] calvary not only saved the world
[46:52] but it was your perpetuation the blood
[46:54] and everything that
[46:55] that went on there he did it for you it
[46:58] is the thing that set
[46:59] you free if you forget if you don't know
[47:02] about calvary
[47:03] you'll never know the freedom you'll
[47:05] never understand
[47:06] grace you go on amen in a
[47:10] system thinking that your system is god
[47:13] your church ain't god that's the way
[47:16] catholics do
[47:17] they believe that their church is god
[47:19] whatever the church says that's what we
[47:21] believe
[47:21] the word is god always will be god
[47:26] right and you must understand amen that
[47:29] the word
[47:30] itself if a true born-again believer
[47:33] if he's really truly born again every
[47:36] word is punctuated with an amen
[47:39] even if you don't understand it people
[47:42] you don't have to understand it
[47:43] but you are the amen right
[47:47] no man have seen god at any time and if
[47:49] we love one another
[47:51] god dwelleth in us and his love is what
[47:54] perfected in us because he first loved
[47:58] us
[47:58] right you can't love god this is not
[48:00] something that you can
[48:02] uh i could say um
[48:06] manufacture love is not manufactured
[48:10] it's life it's real you can't even
[48:14] you can't control it it controls you
[48:18] right when somebody gets up in your face
[48:21] it controls
[48:22] you hallelujah and the church this is
[48:26] what the church was really
[48:27] running off of remember ephesus
[48:30] and you know according to the church h
[48:32] aimed at
[48:33] and relax as soon as you get relaxed
[48:35] that's when the devil sneaks up on you
[48:38] this is not a time to be relaxed this is
[48:40] a time to watch and pray
[48:43] right amen because in this age amen this
[48:46] is what the bible
[48:47] said to us according to uh uh the book
[48:50] of revelation
[48:51] i have one thing against you you have
[48:54] left
[48:55] your first love you know what i'm saying
[48:57] you've left your first love
[49:00] just like eve left her first love right
[49:03] and she was seduced by the serpent call
[49:06] it by god whatever
[49:07] and what was why what what happened
[49:09] where where she was actually
[49:12] seduced because amen he changed
[49:16] her desire from her husband
[49:20] she stopped desiring her husband and
[49:23] went after
[49:24] another man or a beast however you want
[49:27] to say it
[49:28] he changed her desire she changed
[49:32] her desire to please her husband but to
[49:35] please herself
[49:36] you understand me so what are you trying
[49:38] to say brother brooks you lead god
[49:40] as soon as you get in the spirit of
[49:43] pleasing
[49:44] yourself instead of pleasing god
[49:47] you understand me that is the enemy
[49:50] because we're supposed to acknowledge
[49:52] him
[49:52] in all of our ways and he shall direct
[49:55] our path he is our headship he is our
[49:58] father
[49:59] he is our tudor right because he first
[50:02] loved
[50:02] us this is why we love him
[50:05] he died he suffered he rose again from
[50:07] the dead he's literally protecting us
[50:10] he's literally guiding us and we should
[50:12] always respect him
[50:14] and never be like eve allowing the devil
[50:17] to beguile us
[50:21] not everyone that says lord unto me says
[50:24] lord lord shall enter into the kingdom
[50:26] of heaven
[50:26] but he that doeth the will of my father
[50:29] which is in heaven nicodemus you must be
[50:31] born again
[50:32] see what i'm saying you got to be born
[50:34] again you your brother
[50:36] said what has happened to those churches
[50:38] that used to have the old
[50:39] all-night prayers let's call one and see
[50:42] how many people show up
[50:44] huh all night prayer
[50:48] there's a time when we first came to the
[50:50] word we stayed up almost all night
[50:53] three o'clock four o'clock in the
[50:54] morning discussing the word
[50:56] praising god for it now what happened to
[50:59] it
[51:00] it shows that we've left something and
[51:03] that is our love for the word our love
[51:05] for god
[51:06] and we have developed a system where we
[51:09] come to church like all the other
[51:10] churches come to church
[51:12] amen on a certain day and a certain time
[51:14] we give our hallelujahs and we go back
[51:16] home
[51:18] it ain't about that it's about life
[51:22] it's about live people and i'm i'm
[51:24] telling us listen
[51:25] we we talk about uh you know like i said
[51:28] there's not many people here tonight
[51:30] but either you think that they're live
[51:32] screening
[51:33] i doubt that too why people have so many
[51:37] other things to do
[51:38] and then when trouble arises here you go
[51:42] then they seek god
[51:45] because they need something from him
[51:49] how terrible that sound because it
[51:51] really is
[51:52] terrible throughout all the days
[51:55] throughout all the day you never
[51:57] consider about giving god god what do
[51:59] you want me to do
[52:00] if it's just to worship you today if
[52:02] it's just to praise you today
[52:04] you know give me you know it's like i
[52:06] try by god's grace and
[52:08] you know especially when i'm really
[52:09] really you know i'm like
[52:11] i want everybody to be happy i really do
[52:15] i have my moments of pressure but once i
[52:19] recognize the devil i reverse it
[52:22] you understand me you're gonna have your
[52:24] moments of pressure
[52:26] but the moment you you recognize what it
[52:28] is
[52:30] you ought to reverse it
[52:34] so by god's grace let's move on love not
[52:37] the world
[52:37] neither the things that are in the world
[52:40] if any man love the world or the love of
[52:42] the
[52:42] father is not in him you know what
[52:45] brother madame talk say cnn sin is
[52:47] unbelief can you imagine that all these
[52:51] years
[52:51] we thought sin was drinking and smoking
[52:53] and carousing and whatever
[52:55] and all it is is unbelief take it back
[52:58] to the garden of eden
[53:00] she sinned because she disbelieved
[53:03] after the disbelieving that's when the
[53:06] action came in thank you brother
[53:08] but she disbelieved and think about it
[53:10] you don't fall
[53:11] until you take the word of god and push
[53:14] it out of the way
[53:16] you must god god the holy spirit is
[53:18] going to always tell you what is right
[53:20] what is wrong and you never will fall if
[53:23] you hold on to when he tells you what's
[53:25] right
[53:26] but you know what we do we go after our
[53:28] own will
[53:30] we go out to our own think the thing
[53:32] that's going to please us
[53:33] and when we do that we fall we displease
[53:37] god
[53:38] right now that doesn't mean you don't
[53:39] have the holy ghost because you're
[53:41] growing
[53:42] but if those things do not convict you
[53:44] to the place
[53:45] you want to repent and get rid of it
[53:48] then there's something wrong
[53:50] right all of us will fall short until we
[53:53] come
[53:53] into that place of perfection as i said
[53:56] your new parents
[53:58] your new parent is the holy spirit right
[54:00] and so therefore you will bear the
[54:02] nature of him
[54:04] right let's say what brother batman says
[54:06] what do you do with a baby as soon as
[54:08] he's born
[54:09] wash him is that right and as soon as
[54:12] that man has
[54:13] died to himself is born of god
[54:16] he's washed by the water of the word
[54:18] amen if you say
[54:20] jesus name you say jesus name says see
[54:23] you must be born again you say the same
[54:26] thing
[54:27] ever what god says you're washed by the
[54:29] word
[54:30] water of the word amen now you're really
[54:34] now for you're real you're ready for for
[54:36] life now if you're ready to be see start
[54:39] out
[54:39] now if you're born anew born in the
[54:42] family of god with a new
[54:44] parent yes sir your tudor used to be
[54:47] now you've got tutora that is now
[54:51] you've got a new parent you can't be
[54:53] born
[54:54] without having parent if you're born in
[54:57] the brotherhood of the church
[54:59] that's what you've got if you're born in
[55:02] a creed
[55:03] there you are but if you're born in god
[55:07] conceived in his word you've got a new
[55:09] parent
[55:10] and that's god ready to make his word
[55:13] known among you among
[55:17] among with you speak it through you
[55:20] he says oh new parent and that parent
[55:23] is god you understand me
[55:26] yo the parent is not your preacher the
[55:29] parent
[55:29] is god which is the holy ghost you see
[55:36] the bible says so we understand that
[55:38] when we're born again and this is where
[55:39] the enemy used to get me years ago
[55:41] okay i'm born again but lord i've got
[55:43] these things i'm battling with
[55:45] and you're going to always battle till
[55:46] jesus come
[55:48] right as long as you're in this flesh
[55:50] but it's the inner man you must take
[55:52] note to
[55:53] what is your desire did you mean to fall
[55:57] did you willfully plan this plot you see
[55:59] what i'm saying
[56:00] that's the thing you've got to watch
[56:03] because if you willfully just
[56:04] walking into something you know now so
[56:07] you understand
[56:08] at the end of the day is always your
[56:10] will
[56:12] you see what i'm saying that's what
[56:14] iniquity is when you know to do good and
[56:16] you do it that's not
[56:18] see he died for that but he also know
[56:21] that the inner man is not
[56:22] desirous to do it but he allows satan to
[56:25] slip
[56:26] in you know and causes him to do things
[56:28] that he wouldn't normally do
[56:30] that's why immediately when we do wrong
[56:33] we repent
[56:35] right and understand that every time we
[56:37] walk out into something
[56:38] you've allowed the devil to be with you
[56:42] yeah yeah so the bible says listen in
[56:45] ephesians 4 15
[56:46] but speaking the truth in love may grow
[56:49] up into him
[56:50] in all things which is the head
[56:54] even christ so what you speak the truth
[56:57] and love
[56:58] but understand in this process you're
[57:00] growing
[57:02] you can't grow without the rain the
[57:04] sunshine
[57:05] you know you go through your seasons but
[57:07] through the seasons you're growing
[57:09] you're maturing the things that used to
[57:11] trip you up last year
[57:13] is not tripping you up today right
[57:16] whatsoever is born of god overcoming the
[57:19] world
[57:20] you're going to overcome if you're truly
[57:22] born of god
[57:24] you overcome it the world that words
[57:26] overcometh that e.t means that you
[57:29] continue to overcome
[57:31] you continue to have battles but you
[57:33] continue to overcome
[57:34] right the world and this is the victory
[57:37] that
[57:38] overcomes the world even our faith i
[57:41] know i'm bright
[57:43] your faith declare you are regarded to
[57:46] what you're seeing
[57:47] right you may look like an ugly duckling
[57:49] to everybody else but in the beauty the
[57:51] beauty of it is your
[57:53] a swan right you might look like a
[57:56] little chicken
[57:56] but but the beauty of it is that you're
[57:58] an eagle
[58:00] right and who is he that overcometh the
[58:03] world
[58:03] but he that believeth continue to
[58:06] believe
[58:07] that jesus is the son of god
[58:10] hallelujah you just keep that you keep
[58:13] that but lord i know
[58:14] amen that you are the mighty conqueror
[58:17] right
[58:18] and you're going to do this for me for
[58:20] your glory
[58:22] hallelujah right we know that
[58:26] unbelief is sin it is the only sin there
[58:29] is he that believeth not is condemned
[58:32] already
[58:33] and only sin there is is not to believe
[58:37] the word of god and that's what satan
[58:40] does
[58:42] he comes to twist things but you know
[58:45] god is faithful
[58:46] i thank god for that hallelujah
[58:49] give god word the first place
[58:54] a man can't even come see hallelujah
[58:56] here it is
[58:58] this is coming fresh a man cannot
[59:01] sin until first he cast aside
[59:04] god's word he can't even sin
[59:08] that's disbelief until first he gets rid
[59:11] of the word of god
[59:13] the presence of god he cannot sin
[59:17] eve could not sin until she laid aside
[59:20] god's word
[59:21] opening up her channel of reasoning
[59:24] through her soul and began to reason
[59:28] and you know we do that because you know
[59:31] what education has taught us
[59:33] to do that psychology or whatever you
[59:36] want to call it
[59:38] even in your english classes your
[59:40] compositions and
[59:41] things of that way they teach you how to
[59:43] work that mind and
[59:45] process things that to come up with the
[59:47] solution
[59:48] so we're it's it's the fall of nature
[59:51] that makes us do that
[59:53] but the true believer just take faith
[59:56] i don't need to know how it work i know
[59:59] that's what he said
[1:00:00] and that's what i believe right god word
[1:00:03] or it must first
[1:00:04] come first you can only preach the
[1:00:07] gospel and let those who
[1:00:08] will come and no man can come unless god
[1:00:11] draws him so it's all belong to god
[1:00:15] if god has called you and give you a
[1:00:18] call to come to him
[1:00:19] you should be very very happy
[1:00:23] that's what i don't understand yeah i'm
[1:00:25] in the message and people are looking
[1:00:27] like they're so sad
[1:00:28] what's wrong with the people you're in
[1:00:30] the place where
[1:00:31] most people wish they were
[1:00:34] if the pentecostals those who weren't
[1:00:36] there when brother branham but if they
[1:00:38] could
[1:00:38] see and understand what we have
[1:00:42] they're tearing up
[1:00:45] you know what i'm saying they would
[1:00:47] really go after it
[1:00:49] they're blinded because of their parents
[1:00:52] they've got to go through the
[1:00:53] tribulation because of their parents
[1:00:57] because their parents turned away the
[1:00:59] message they've got to suffer for it
[1:01:02] hello it's the same with the jews let
[1:01:05] his blood be on us
[1:01:07] because their parents turned down jesus
[1:01:09] they must suffer
[1:01:12] help us absolutely that's why it's so
[1:01:15] important
[1:01:16] for the parents today amen who have
[1:01:18] children to make sure that children
[1:01:21] don't fall in love with a system but
[1:01:22] with christ
[1:01:27] hallelujah now that is god's word
[1:01:32] this is first always in any religious
[1:01:35] doctrine
[1:01:35] that does not based upon the word of god
[1:01:38] through the entire word of god i'm
[1:01:40] afraid of it
[1:01:41] you can make the word say anything by
[1:01:43] twisting it around
[1:01:45] but it must be proven to be truth
[1:01:49] if you love me keep my commandments
[1:01:53] right and that's what happens is a
[1:01:56] system that appears
[1:01:57] amen to the eye the system you know
[1:02:00] that's why
[1:02:01] a lot of people you know join the muslim
[1:02:03] because they know they're wretched and
[1:02:04] they know they're wicked and they know
[1:02:06] all
[1:02:06] all these things and then they see these
[1:02:08] people that in their eyes they
[1:02:10] dressed in a certain way and it declares
[1:02:12] to them holiness
[1:02:14] but let me tell you something there is
[1:02:16] no holiness in in being a muslim
[1:02:20] matter of fact amen the more the law is
[1:02:22] the stronger the law is the more the sin
[1:02:24] is
[1:02:25] that's what happened to israel the more
[1:02:27] laws they they received
[1:02:29] what not to do is the more they did it
[1:02:32] but then the bible said grace did abound
[1:02:34] the more
[1:02:35] see so god's grace comes and he brings
[1:02:38] us to
[1:02:38] this is why we can't even in the message
[1:02:40] listen when you see a church and i'm
[1:02:42] gonna say it like this
[1:02:43] i don't know who's listening it's any
[1:02:45] church whether it be baptist methods
[1:02:47] pentecostals
[1:02:48] message if you see what these people are
[1:02:50] so law
[1:02:51] law law let me tell you something sin
[1:02:55] sin sin is rampant
[1:02:58] because you cannot make a man live
[1:03:02] right that's like trying to take a pig
[1:03:05] and calling him a dove
[1:03:07] you can wash him up you can put a tuxedo
[1:03:10] on him a bow tie and everything else as
[1:03:13] soon as that pig get free
[1:03:14] he's going to the mud the nature
[1:03:18] must be changed this is what the prophet
[1:03:20] was trying to tell us
[1:03:22] nature must be changed how you know your
[1:03:25] nature has changed
[1:03:26] because you're thirsting for god every
[1:03:28] day
[1:03:29] you make your mistakes but you want more
[1:03:31] god
[1:03:32] that's how you know you don't want to
[1:03:34] run to the club you don't want around
[1:03:36] here and there
[1:03:36] you're just like god i want more of you
[1:03:39] that means your nature has changed
[1:03:42] you've been born again you're growing
[1:03:45] low god let's keep continuing let's
[1:03:47] continue to grow
[1:03:48] but don't let a system stop you
[1:03:52] don't let the people around the
[1:03:53] messaging all around the church
[1:03:55] because of their lives they're not
[1:03:56] living like listen let me tell you
[1:03:58] something
[1:03:58] they're going to people they're going to
[1:04:00] be people
[1:04:02] living bad lives until jesus come write
[1:04:05] in the message
[1:04:07] ain't nothing you can do with that but
[1:04:09] don't you judge those people
[1:04:11] and don't you look at them and say well
[1:04:12] if they can do it i can do it no
[1:04:14] i don't want to do it and don't you
[1:04:16] understand when god
[1:04:18] imprisoned you like paul says i'm a
[1:04:20] prisoner for christ
[1:04:21] there are things that god ain't going to
[1:04:22] let you do that other people can easily
[1:04:25] do
[1:04:26] he's not going to do it because you are
[1:04:28] a prisoner
[1:04:30] you asked to be one and he's made you
[1:04:32] one
[1:04:33] hallelujah so don't feel like you're
[1:04:35] being neglected or left out
[1:04:37] i'm so glad i can't do some of the
[1:04:39] things that these people are doing
[1:04:42] so glad
[1:04:45] oh the word of god according to mark 7 6
[1:04:48] and 8 says
[1:04:51] says he answered and said unto him
[1:04:54] well have isaiah prophesied of you
[1:04:56] hypocrites
[1:04:57] as it is written this people honor me
[1:05:00] with their lips
[1:05:01] but their heart is far from me and
[1:05:04] that's one of the things as a pastor
[1:05:06] i have had to deal with i just thought
[1:05:08] that was some of the worst things
[1:05:09] some of the worst things i've ever
[1:05:10] encountered uh we won't go into it
[1:05:13] but you know it it's the truth you know
[1:05:15] oh praise the lord the lord
[1:05:17] you know the if mighty agent come down
[1:05:19] you know they can they can
[1:05:21] they can worship they can really go at
[1:05:24] it
[1:05:24] but then after the service after they
[1:05:28] leave the church building
[1:05:30] you see you're not a christian until you
[1:05:31] can prove you're a christian when you're
[1:05:33] by yourself you don't have to worry
[1:05:36] about nobody looking at you
[1:05:38] right because you know what you can fake
[1:05:39] it as long as people are around you can
[1:05:42] fake it
[1:05:43] but the real test is when you buy
[1:05:44] yourself and you feel like nobody's
[1:05:47] looking
[1:05:48] that's when you stand as a true
[1:05:49] christian when you can keep your honor
[1:05:52] and your integrity in a time when you
[1:05:54] know nobody is
[1:05:55] el nobody else is there but you and god
[1:05:59] how be it in vain do they worship me you
[1:06:01] understand me god said this is vain
[1:06:04] worship i don't care if the anointing
[1:06:06] come down
[1:06:07] don't you know the anointing came down
[1:06:08] when when david had the ark
[1:06:10] on a cart brother said it looked so
[1:06:13] right
[1:06:14] and yet it was death caused a man to die
[1:06:19] right because of his disobedience to the
[1:06:22] word
[1:06:23] so it ain't about all the anointing
[1:06:25] don't you understand in the pentecostals
[1:06:26] and a lot of baptist churches
[1:06:28] the same rain is falling on them but
[1:06:32] guess what
[1:06:32] they can't produce no more than what the
[1:06:36] word they're being fed
[1:06:38] that's being fed to them so they become
[1:06:41] systematic
[1:06:43] church members god ain't never like a
[1:06:46] system
[1:06:47] he want to see blood he want to see the
[1:06:50] blood he want to see the life of the
[1:06:52] blood
[1:06:52] on display when i see the token i'll
[1:06:55] pass over you
[1:06:58] oh for as he thinketh in his heart so is
[1:07:01] he
[1:07:02] right so you say well what do you see
[1:07:04] that's what i'm saying
[1:07:05] if the holy ghost is in your heart
[1:07:06] however he's thinking in there
[1:07:08] that's how god looks at you right
[1:07:12] when you i put it this way when you get
[1:07:14] to a place where somehow you're
[1:07:18] looking at things in the way that you
[1:07:19] shouldn't then then uh that's when you
[1:07:21] really need prayer
[1:07:23] deuteronomy 6 4-5 says hear ye o israel
[1:07:26] the lord our god is
[1:07:27] one and thou shall love the lord thy god
[1:07:29] with all thy heart
[1:07:31] with all thy soul and with all thy might
[1:07:34] now that means with all you know what
[1:07:38] with all means
[1:07:39] it leaves you nothing
[1:07:42] it leaves you nothing now you're saying
[1:07:45] why are you saying all these things i
[1:07:47] want to see a revival
[1:07:48] in this place i want to see a revival
[1:07:51] among the message
[1:07:52] the people in this church that claim
[1:07:54] that they know god
[1:07:56] i want to see a revival but i know a
[1:07:58] revival cannot come
[1:08:00] until there's a cleaning that's where
[1:08:03] the first portion of that comes in god
[1:08:06] must strip us of
[1:08:07] all of the dirt and zion the bible
[1:08:10] called it the filth of zion
[1:08:13] filth and then when god cleanses the
[1:08:16] filth away from zion
[1:08:17] amen we can then have a real real
[1:08:21] real pentecostal experience but the
[1:08:24] truth of the matter is
[1:08:25] we've got too many worldly things
[1:08:27] attached to us
[1:08:29] may god help us you know
[1:08:32] now 45 i said this is what i wanted to
[1:08:34] come to i was looking for it earlier
[1:08:36] jeremiah 45 and 5 says and seeketh thou
[1:08:40] great
[1:08:40] things for thyself seek them not
[1:08:44] for behold i bring evil upon all flesh
[1:08:49] saith the lord but thy life will i give
[1:08:52] unto thee
[1:08:53] for a prey in all places whether
[1:08:56] thou goest what do you mean if you're
[1:09:00] seeking amen things for yourself
[1:09:03] you understand me you see preachers and
[1:09:05] and they're all about
[1:09:08] even the prophet god said he didn't
[1:09:09] understand it how can you believe that
[1:09:11] the coming of the lord is at hand
[1:09:13] and you building these mega churches
[1:09:15] none of that that thought didn't change
[1:09:17] but you don't hear people quoting it
[1:09:19] but the truth of the matter is how can
[1:09:21] you and the thing is you got people
[1:09:23] oh anyway if there's so much that goes
[1:09:26] on
[1:09:27] that that makes no sense
[1:09:30] when there are evangelists aaron who's
[1:09:32] giving up their lives
[1:09:34] and working so hard to to bring the
[1:09:36] message
[1:09:37] not only just to africa or south america
[1:09:40] but here in in america and the preachers
[1:09:44] the pastors parties are getting fat
[1:09:48] these people are out there barely making
[1:09:50] it but we're in the same message
[1:09:53] you think god will be pleased with that
[1:09:56] hmm
[1:09:57] and and just what they're doing is not
[1:10:00] right
[1:10:01] there's nothing wrong listen if if the
[1:10:03] man is a is a
[1:10:05] has a church and all our millionaires he
[1:10:07] should live like a millionaire
[1:10:11] you understand me but if his church is
[1:10:13] poor he shouldn't live above his people
[1:10:16] brother man talks about he said the
[1:10:17] shepherd he loved and mingled with the
[1:10:20] sheep so much he smelled like the sheep
[1:10:23] and that's the way a pastor should
[1:10:24] always be
[1:10:26] now they ain't gonna like me for saying
[1:10:28] that bro but i don't care
[1:10:30] i'm telling truth i think that we we we
[1:10:33] we get the the laid to see a spirit on
[1:10:36] us and we really don't know it and
[1:10:38] and but god has a way of doing it right
[1:10:41] you know god has a way of doing he's
[1:10:42] perfect he's going to
[1:10:44] brother adam said it'll be a paradox
[1:10:47] because what is he going to do
[1:10:48] he's going to strip us of all these
[1:10:50] worldly goods
[1:10:52] by way of the pressure he ain't going to
[1:10:54] have nothing
[1:10:56] but each other and that's the way it's
[1:10:58] supposed to be
[1:11:04] how many of us love the word so much
[1:11:06] like this
[1:11:07] because thy loving-kindness is better
[1:11:09] than life
[1:11:10] my lips shall praise thee thus will i
[1:11:13] bless thee
[1:11:14] while i live i will lift up my hands
[1:11:18] in thy name your lovingkindness
[1:11:21] is better than this life right
[1:11:25] just knowing that you love me just
[1:11:27] seeing your kindness
[1:11:29] is the thing that keeps me in peace and
[1:11:32] keeps me with joy and
[1:11:33] gives me what i need to continue on i
[1:11:36] don't need to be rich
[1:11:38] in fact i like the fact that i need
[1:11:40] things at times
[1:11:42] i really do i like the fact that i have
[1:11:44] to call on his name and ask him
[1:11:47] father you know and i know you got all
[1:11:49] things and
[1:11:50] you know brother brown said ask him for
[1:11:53] big things and i think to myself
[1:11:55] what can i ask more than that's big
[1:11:58] more than just souls for jesus that's my
[1:12:01] prayer
[1:12:02] my prayer i want to see more souls for
[1:12:05] jesus
[1:12:06] i've asked god it said lord please don't
[1:12:08] let me go through this summer
[1:12:09] or this spring and not bring some souls
[1:12:12] in
[1:12:12] i've been trying to witness the best i
[1:12:14] can you know people don't want to hear
[1:12:16] the gospel but i still got to preach it
[1:12:18] i still got a witness i still got to
[1:12:20] tell them cause you never know who
[1:12:22] is who somehow god is able to bring it
[1:12:26] up
[1:12:26] right therefore take no thoughts
[1:12:30] saying what we shall eat or what we
[1:12:32] should drink or
[1:12:33] what wherever or whatsoever all we shall
[1:12:36] we be clothed
[1:12:37] for all these things do the gentiles
[1:12:40] seek
[1:12:40] for your heavenly father knoweth that ye
[1:12:43] have need of
[1:12:44] all these things but seek ye first the
[1:12:47] kingdom of god
[1:12:49] you know i can't get over the way
[1:12:50] solomon answers god in the dream
[1:12:53] when he had the opportunity to ask for
[1:12:55] all the riches and all the wealth of the
[1:12:57] world
[1:12:58] he asked for one thing to touch them
[1:13:00] lord just give me the wisdom
[1:13:03] to instruct and teach your people
[1:13:06] and i think that's ought to be the
[1:13:10] the the very sentiment of every true
[1:13:12] preacher
[1:13:13] heart is god give me the wisdom to
[1:13:16] instruct and teach you people because
[1:13:18] you see
[1:13:18] i know if i don't preach the holy ghost
[1:13:21] and tell you that you need it
[1:13:23] as a church i'm failing god and i'm
[1:13:26] failing the preach the prophet's message
[1:13:29] because his message is the holy ghost
[1:13:35] see and you very seldom see people
[1:13:38] because they they think you get it a new
[1:13:39] way
[1:13:40] whenever that woman start having a baby
[1:13:42] a different way
[1:13:43] then we can start getting the holy ghost
[1:13:47] brother branham said after the seals is
[1:13:49] always a mess
[1:13:51] right because nobody really wants to die
[1:13:54] i'm almost done people
[1:13:56] you've got to be dead to everything
[1:13:59] everything people
[1:14:00] everything take no thought don't worry
[1:14:03] don't fret
[1:14:04] amen
[1:14:08] this is one of the quotes i told you i
[1:14:09] think i said it earlier
[1:14:12] joseph was talking to brother branham
[1:14:14] and i think joseph was around 18 years
[1:14:15] old at the time and
[1:14:16] he said dad you know what he was showing
[1:14:18] brother branham how these people were
[1:14:20] doing this little musical thing or
[1:14:21] whatever they're doing brother branham
[1:14:22] never noticed it
[1:14:24] he said dad you know what he said you
[1:14:26] just become
[1:14:27] dead to everything but jesus christ
[1:14:30] and i said that's right that's right
[1:14:33] just become
[1:14:34] dead to everything i said nothing has
[1:14:37] a sound but christ jesus and let me stay
[1:14:40] that way
[1:14:40] i only want to know him that's all
[1:14:43] to know him is life
[1:14:47] paul said that's all i want to know paul
[1:14:49] says i just want to know him
[1:14:50] in the power of his resurrection right i
[1:14:53] just want to know him
[1:14:54] now i call this little segment in my
[1:14:56] this my last quote
[1:14:58] born again again
[1:15:03] he said if you're born of god you're
[1:15:05] washed in the waters of the word
[1:15:07] separated from the things of the world
[1:15:09] and believe god you're
[1:15:10] dead you're dead to your own thinking
[1:15:13] dead to your own ideas
[1:15:15] dead to everything else but god's word
[1:15:17] and it
[1:15:18] lives in you working back through you
[1:15:21] proving that it is god's word he says
[1:15:24] i'm dead to see i'm dead to the world
[1:15:27] brother branham
[1:15:28] and deny god's word he said jesus said
[1:15:30] these signs
[1:15:31] shall follow them that believe now we're
[1:15:34] getting down to what's born again means
[1:15:37] still with tempers still mean arrogant
[1:15:41] somebody says something about you and
[1:15:43] you right up ready to fight
[1:15:45] and then born of the spirit of god no
[1:15:48] god's spirit don't do like that no
[1:15:52] god's spirit is humble meek sweet
[1:15:56] long-suffering that's god loving
[1:15:59] kind forgiving see that's god's spirit
[1:16:02] oh yes
[1:16:03] but they're they're whole to the
[1:16:05] denominations and speak in tongues and
[1:16:07] prophesy
[1:16:08] and do all kinds of works jesus said
[1:16:10] they'll do it
[1:16:11] having forms of godliness whole to the
[1:16:14] denominational because
[1:16:16] that's their father they was born in the
[1:16:19] denomination father
[1:16:20] but if you're born of god this is your
[1:16:22] father he is the word the word
[1:16:25] no matter how many situations you have
[1:16:28] still a child of satan
[1:16:29] until you become dead to the world and
[1:16:32] alive in christ
[1:16:34] listen a soul good or bad
[1:16:38] death doesn't change it i had a lot of
[1:16:40] scripture wrote down here on
[1:16:42] on this one that i wanted to commend
[1:16:44] meant to
[1:16:45] on uh what soul is what is a soul
[1:16:49] it's you you also the part inside of you
[1:16:53] and when you die ever what shape that
[1:16:56] soul
[1:16:56] is in that that way it goes
[1:17:00] it goes to its destination you could you
[1:17:03] couldn't pull it up
[1:17:04] no matter how much you do it you do
[1:17:08] for it the soul got to be changed
[1:17:11] here born again then that
[1:17:17] that's something else that's something
[1:17:20] else i'm just going to stop right there
[1:17:23] but you see the thing is you got so many
[1:17:25] people they they still got
[1:17:26] all that garbage in them and they say
[1:17:28] they've been born again
[1:17:31] ready to fight don't know how to forgive
[1:17:34] you know just crazy stuff going on and
[1:17:37] then
[1:17:38] for the person who can do that they call
[1:17:40] them weak
[1:17:41] you know who's the strength they
[1:17:44] probably call jesus weak
[1:17:46] you know what i mean but lambs are weak
[1:17:50] they're not goats they're weak
[1:17:53] but strong in him right here's our
[1:17:56] strength and you must understand it's
[1:17:59] all right
[1:18:00] to be different because we are we have a
[1:18:02] different world
[1:18:03] we have a different nature we are of a
[1:18:05] different people we are
[1:18:07] alien to this world and
[1:18:10] of course the bible tells us that the
[1:18:12] world is not even
[1:18:13] worthy to have us so i want you to keep
[1:18:17] pressing people of god i want you to
[1:18:19] examine yourself i want to see let you
[1:18:21] you know lord what is it
[1:18:22] you know what i must have take out or
[1:18:24] what what needs to die
[1:18:26] everything that's not like it let it die
[1:18:29] take me to calvary and let me die like
[1:18:31] like brother brown said abel died on the
[1:18:34] altar
[1:18:35] of the sacrifice and may we die
[1:18:38] with christ that we could live because
[1:18:41] we want to live now that's what it's all
[1:18:43] about
[1:18:44] it's not being famous or popular or you
[1:18:46] know or gaining
[1:18:47] friends or whatever the case may be this
[1:18:50] is not a lodge or a club or
[1:18:52] anything of that nature you and i are
[1:18:55] going and moving
[1:18:56] as the body of christ and the bible said
[1:18:59] we're
[1:19:00] living stones we united together
[1:19:03] unified by one spirited and that is the
[1:19:06] holy ghost
[1:19:08] so you pray for me and i'll pray for you
[1:19:12] because i tell you what i i i when i die
[1:19:16] i don't want to go down i want to go up
[1:19:20] i want to make sure my nature is from
[1:19:22] above
[1:19:23] and not from below let's stand
[1:19:26] father we so thank you for your grace
[1:19:29] we for we thank you for your mercy and
