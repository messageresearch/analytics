those of you who prayed that God would turn my Bible he did indeed thank God for his victory amen praise the Lord I left it in Iowa City didn't know it but regardless I'm just glad to have it surely thank you for your prayers this is my buddy I got some friends but this is my buddy and these are my other Bibles surely God is good to us hey man you know this Bible when I want to find something he somehow it helps me [Music] sometimes it's flipped right to what I need we love the Lord God is good to us I don't know exactly so don't let me forget but we're gonna have brother Simmons come up sometime and we're going to have a few days of meetings Holy Ghost meetings just all the Holy Ghost whether or not whether or not we dismiss or get out it's up to God but that's the kind of meetings we gonna have and he accepted I just got to find out when we want to do that we'll invite both churches by God's grace and if they want to come they want to come we we were under sitting like this the Lord really blessed in my endeavor today so things are moving forward in that way yes so we love the Lord and we thank God for being so so so good to us amen so got a different little thought today we're trusting that the Lord will bless this thought I could still work on the blood is so much more to work on in that it's because I really see I see God in so many ways now like I never have seen him before but anyway let us turn the first John three first John three and then we'll go to Genesis the fourth chapter we're not going to be long I really appreciate your waiting on me I I didn't know I was going to get here as early as we did but it all worked together praise the Lord I was really anxious to get home so haha but I kept being trapped at caught in the office different questions and things up from the young people and it was really needed needful rather glad to see our brother Vincent back know that we always miss you always and I was just so happy to see that the Lord brought you back safely first John the third chapter we're going to start reading the from the 11th of the 12th verse tell my brother and friend I failed I didn't have dinner with him tell me the next time he comes amen first John 3rd chapter xi of the 12th verse but this is the message that you heard from the beginning that we should love one another not as Cain who was of that wicked one and slew his brother and wherefore slew he him because his own works were evil and his brothers righteous now watch how God called this man's work evil all that he had done didn't have a revelation but he tried to give God something that was not according to his plan which made him Antichrist because he wanted God to accept it and the only thing that God could accept was his word that which he had planned his old plan God cannot work according to our plan it must be his and just to see how God called his work evil brother branham said he was religious he was just as religious as Abel was worked hard diligently right but he failed in that he rejected the truth and we know that you cannot go into error until you reject the truth all right Genesis 4 all God requires is obedience that's all he asked for able from a cane is obedience and Cain refused obedience and a lot of time people in the church don't even know that when you refuse obedience that's not the Spirit of Christ that's Antichrist doesn't make you Antichrist but you are being influenced by our spirit that is not of Christ okay Judas is four or five but unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect and Cain was very wroth and his countenance fell and the Lord said unto Cain why art thou wroth and why is thy countenance fallen if thou do it well shall not be accepted and if thou do it not well seeing lieth at the door and unto thee shall be his desire be his desire and thou shalt rule over him and Cain talked with Abel his brother and it came to pass when they were in the field that Cain rose up against Abel his brother and slew him and the Lord said if the Cain where is Abel thy brother and he said I know not am I my brother's keeper and he said thou has what has thou done the voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground let us pray Lord we thank you for your grace and we thank you for your mercy we thank you for being so good to us Lord we pray O God that you would bless the service in a special way thank you Jesus have thine own way amen you may be seated we we go through the scriptures and we find out that Paul tells us telling Timothy that we ought to contend for the faith that means to fight for it but often time we don't and for some reason you know when we don't fight Satan takes more ground I'd like to entitle this message war on the Antichrist because we realize a man that the it is the Antichrist that has who has war a waged war against us but we realize a man that God has given us weapon tree and he has given us a warfare he has given us war garments put on the whole armor of God that you might be able to stand and withstand the wiles of the devil the thing that Satan has always done is that he always introduced what we call a false light and he calls it enlightenment something that is going to stir your mind something that is going to give you supposedly a greater revelation as he did with Eve he enlightened her amen and by enlightened her lighting her we find out that she failed God why because she listened to a spirit that was anti God or Antichrist he introduced a new plan a reproduction when God had already told them that they would produce and I'll reproduce so we realized by God grace that spirit is really slick it's closed and if you know much about a serpent he is really a slick fella a serpent can easily crawl next to you and you won't even know he's there because he moves so subtly and he's a such a creepy thing but we find out by God and that's how that serpent was even though he was like in the form of the land he had an agenda we don't know how many times he spoke with Eve before she really started communicating but if I if I have anything to think about we know that surely wasn't the first time they had talked but somewhere down the road be the serpent or the real devil I was able to get behind the Serpent and influence him to seduce even the way because otherwise why would God judge the serpent if he didn't know better right so he had to have enough intelligence like the prophet of God said the only thing he did not have was a soul so he had enough intelligence to know right from wrong otherwise God could not have been just the animals are not being punished because of us because of their sin scuse me but they're being punished because of our sins now we look at this thing and you say well what is it enlightenment enlightenment is to give intelligent and intellectual or spiritual light and you know the devil is really good that's why so many people think that he is God Satan is God because of the Enlightenment and whenever Satan brings enlightenment he's always taking you away from the word he never stays within the word he takes us from from the word so we thank God amen that we can see by God's grace that moving of the Antichrist then that Christ has always worked through out the church ages he worked through the history of mankind forever and what what were you mean because he that's how come the children in the days of Noah became so wicked because they were internists reasoning and the reasoning that they were working with had no real foundation you see is nothing wrong with reasoning because the Bible says come let us reason together as long as you including the word and the word it's become the thing that you're reasoning with not against with that yo-yo your concept is the word is right and I am wrong and what did the devil do like I said I won't be low but I want to show you something there like right spirit is such a subtle thing it comes to a place and I don't know why it happens all the time I get in the pulpit adjust but anyway you it is such a subtle thing and and it works right among us it can work right among us and if you're not spiritual you will not discern it hello it works in music it works in preachers hello it works amen whoever allows it to anoint them Satan will always take any excess just a little crack he'll take it because we realize that evil serpents can crawl into some very abnormal priests places do too even if the size of the crack is small so we realized by God's grace that when it comes to the mind of God this is the only thing that protects us from the inner Christ having the mind of God and when you have the mind of God you know the will of God you know the Word of God you know it's like for example when Peter said unto Jesus Lord you surely you're not gonna die you're not going to Calvary what did Jesus say he admits he may have meant it in a fatter your compliment at oh you know how people do not he didn't mean any harm but Jesus saw the serpent he saw the enemy amen using Peters lip and he says Satan get thee behind me alright I'll think about jobs wife who was a religious woman who loved her husband was there for him and at the end of all of the tests just about just almost there the devil uses her and said why don't you just curse God and die Joe being a spiritual woman didn't let me and didn't get upset at his wife he saw the Anti Christ he saw her speaking something that was not according to the word hallelujah remembered that job had already said he said the Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away blessed be the name of the Lord he was determined to praise God no matter what his situations were and whatever he fell into he was going to praise God right and Joel looked at the Wallace's woman you sound foolish I like this he said you don't sound like my wife in other words I know who's behind this voice so you looked and you saw our brother what are you saying I am saying that this is why is it important that we take we check each other we check each other because whenever we say anything that's negative that is not of the word of God it is not Christ speaking it is Antichrist hello the Bible said let your conversation be yeah yay and they name hi something like the Satan always got something going on and you have to be careful in this message right because if you watch these greater preachers they always have some kind of revelation to enlighten you and every time they bring something great it's not about Jesus Christ it's about what Christ has done for them you understand me they take it to a place where they want you to give them some acknowledgment they put themselves in a place till you be they become a lord and you become the follower of these leaders you don't think they literally in their enlightenment they they know how to seduce the church bring them to a place a man well where there they become the man that's worshipped instead of Christ himself and remember I read that quote to you brother Branham said in Easter seal he said a real true revelation a Mount Transfiguration will only worship Jesus Christ will only glorify Jesus Christ he said not Moses didn't glorify himself he larger than grows by himself he said no minister will glorify themselves the only thing that they're interested in it's Jesus Christ glorified hello is that okay because I'm a drop down and read another quote that brother gave me the other day I don't recall but you know coming from the absolute now in 1963 brother Ella preached the message absolute and when we say absolute that means absolute this is the only thing that I'm working with is my absolute people say well the message is my absolute you know what my absolute is Christ see because listen if the message is not living which the message is but it doesn't live until he lives in you hello and the reason why I say that is that God's people will take the traditions of man there take my brother branham did you know what brother told me he liked his state meaning where because that's the way the Prophet would eat here you see it's not an absolute and because he ate his steaks medium rare doesn't mean that I'm gonna eat mine if that's the way people like it go ahead on you know if you want me to put your one for you you know I might be you but my point is people will take things like that they take the traditions of the Prophet somebody said to me the other day our brother Brooks are do you is anything wrong with celebrating Christmas I said listen I said I know brother Branham celebrated Christmas I said I don't know why he did it I said but I cannot do it because my conscience will allow me to there is nothing in me that get excited about Christmas especially when I know it's a lie hallelujah Jesus was born in April absolutely the minute the medium told brother Branham that his birthday was a memorial to the birth of Jesus Christ so they were born on the same day now how can I go and says now my birthday is in January and you're gonna have it in March hear me I'm about truth y'all better hear what I'm saying because I think a lot of people take it too far you know if you're gonna celebrate Jesus Christ's birthday you can do it anytime you want to but he's not in a manger anymore so my point is do it your way I told her I said listen I said I'm not condemning anybody I'm just saying whatever you feel led to do it do it you know I just know i conscious won't allow me to do it right knowing it's you know dealing with Zeus and Jupiter bah bah all bail any help so much oh you too legalistic I will maybe I am all I know is the bride must have herself without spot wrinkle or blemish right see he goes on to me says listen only telling the truth friends don't let it pass by you I'm not claiming I'm nothing I'm your brother don't you pay any attention to the messenger you watched the message don't watch the messenger God will take it from you in other words if you watch the lesson jur God will take the message from you he will share his glory with no body that's right don't watch the messenger watch the message he said if a messenger came to you with a million dollars he said you take the million dollars and you'll forget about the messenger Allah because the the message a million dollars is the message and what we fail to see is that the spirit that's pushing people a man to glorify the messenger and they began to preach the messenger and they think they preaching the message and the message has always been from the book of Acts he's alive Jesus Christ is alive Hebrews 13:8 he's alive anything outside of that become inter brother branham said wants you and I become aware and we are able to discern the two spirits in the framework of the church we will become an invincible is this okay here's another one he says like on Mount Transfiguration all the prophets and everything else is finished all the days of Luther the Methodists the Presbyterians they're all right but this is my beloved son hear you him the word of this hour the hour of the seals when the mysteries back yonder that's been here all these years in them is that great period of time was stricken off the headstone made it hold down so that the Star of David was sold into the play its place and the great Church of the Living God will be raised like the wings of an eagle back out on the into the glory and now in now in our bodies with speaking is here in now in now in how body will with speaking the new tongues and with prophecies and for seeing lay hands on the sick they they recover the word the world dead and all the things of the world will pass from death unto life and we now hold the power hallelujah so he say all of that has passed the emphasis is Christ in you that's where the dynamite supposed to be in the believer hallelujah listen I love it he said they know Dane enough Devils in hell to keep us from doing it hallelujah so the battle is on but the victory has already been won God coming in trying to get us a focus focus back to the place where it started is that right Malik our fall was to come and turn our hearts back to the Pentecostal fathers and what else did they preach Paul said don't come preach and me that's what Paul said Paul said I didn't die for you don't baptized in my name ha ha the very same thing they're doing they tried to do it to Paul too because they don't nothing but one died for you and that's Jesus Christ hallelujah and that's Papa at the same battle with the message of that day that we're having right now people branching off into groups I am of Cephas I'm of Apollo's I'm up this way I'm the thunders and I am the Persian I am the two souls ha nonsense there's only one gospel hallelujah and that gospel ought to be preached Jesus Christ the same yesterday today forever there is no greater drawing card outside of Christ dying for you and no man can give you the Holy Ghost but God God is the author of salvation he is the one that accepts you not that you accepts him he accepts you that's why we can't see the power in the move of God but don't you be concerned be too worried God is beginning to open our eyes that we can see clearer now and you know what you gonna have battles you saw a lord I I'm doing I'm quoting the Prophet I'm doing just what he said but you know what we're getting giving him more glory than we are Jesus Christ he said forget about me he even said that in his shoes forget about me he even told us not to interpret the thunders and all that don't entirely interpret it will interpret itself that's might as well say tenant preachers going to interpret interpret it because that's what they tried to do and what has it brought us Lord division hallelujah is it's okay he said there ain't enough Devils in hell to keep us from doing it we were for Dean of God for this hour the Word of God manifests itself through us and we will live in the presence of God by the word promised of God Enid Evelyn Hale can keep me from raising in a door he can shut in my face at this morning the seals have been broken hallelujah I'm free I'm free what we need to do is get you know we need to really pray Lord let the promise of the word be fulfilled in me you can't tell me it's not the time because even Daniel all of them wrote at the time and Ezra and everybody knew that this is the time but somebody had to take the initiative to move forward hallelujah I was thinking about this this morning uh say here Indonesia none had this volcano erupting over there and then had another tsunami and over 200 people are two hundred people and more they said they haven't found the rest of them yet hallelujah and I'm thinking all these earthquakes are shipping all the earth is shifting people why is it is shifting fog to bring to pass thus saith the Lord California will sink that's why it's moving you know the world can't get too much uh uh yeah it can get I won't say it can't buck off you know twenty years ago we thought it could never get this bad but you know it the Bible is right evil seduces watchwords it's not gonna get any better and do you think God gonna judge that little poor place called Indonesia and not come by America he ain't gonna just charge as America he's are judging the whole world because when she goes everything shifts Oh help us Jesus that's how late in the evening we are not only me but every man woman boy or girl sitting here that's been filled in the spirit of God is a new creature in Christ and you are an eco like this morning like the other day I preached veil behind the blood was what was behind the blood it was God God veil hallelujah and God behind the veil he always was God he will always be God so when we pray in the name of Jesus Christ we lay hands on the sick we are applying God if you can believe it we are applying God will not everybody never launching represents the Holy Spirit and we are applying God God never fails but he works by faith hallelujah if you can believe that you can receive did you know that God uses us according to the man of God he uses us we are his eyes we are his head we are his feet we are his body we are working according to his inspiration that's all theologian our Sun land like I said they take that that quote you know the Holy Ghost without sensation and leave it there and then kill the people everybody sitting up in church D it ain't funny but it's true dad and they didn't they left that part off about the about the the person of Jesus Christ they left that off ah yes it's always been to it that way but when it's real you can see the person hello when the Holy Ghost has been if he's in you you are going to see the real person of Jesus Christ living in you you become God in flesh that right but we just don't throw our power anywhere we wait hallelujah why because the bride knows what to do with the word she knows that the word is her headship hallelujah so she waits on him and when he tells her to rule she moves she is a woman of faith what do you mean because faith is a revelation God reveals to her just what to do and she'll do it thank God good whoo we are live and enjoy the resurrection forevermore I enjoyed my Holy Ghost I don't know about y'all but I enjoy it ain't just a shouting in the dancing I enjoy it when he talks to me I enjoy when he sings to me y'all God don't sing to you Oh mon Dieu I'm telling you and he's always perfect perfectly pitched hallelujah and sometime I join in with it is that ride nearer my God to Dior How Great Thou art sometimes I'm working in all of a sudden a song come nearer ah how great are I saying with him hallelujah everybody think I'm singing by myself but me and Jesus having a good time what is it he's real he's real hallelujah you know come on somebody when the devil to knock you down and you don't trip that everything else God picks you up and said everything on be alright hallelujah that's God recognizing enjoy Jesus enjoying your Holy Ghost cuz so many people go down and there's nobody to pick them up there's not a word of comfort hallelujah why would I give my whole it goes over for system the system can't comfort me hallelujah you know what the system brings us to slavery don't do this and don't do that touch not this in touch not that that's not our salvation our salvation produces the works it is that right it produces that like any tree as an apple tree it produces the apples hallelujah you gotta understand in the light in us that produces the works that's right Jesus said when I see my father work I work here the two because he's alive we are live also and he's living us making us alive and the spirit that raised him from the dead dwell it in our be shall quicken our mortal bodies at that great eternal Easter glory to God who is he trying to tell us that we're gonna have us at Easter a day of resurrection hallelujah there's coming a rapture don't let go God become an intellectual because he wasn't even born one and he nothing wrong with being intelligent hallelujah but Paul said I had to forget it all to understand Christ to know him I counted as dog hallelujah and one thing about Paul he says listen I want you to know I want to know him in the power of his resurrection I want to know him in his suffering Paul was not afraid of suffering and a real Christian is not afraid of suffering hallelujah why because we know the battle has already been fought we know that this whenever we go through a battle hallelujah we are the ones that's coming out real good is that right so that you're alone that will we talk about the Antichrist it literally takes you it's so subtle it's so subtle and that's why what people didn't understand whenever you branch off and you name your section the section of your branch you are now a denomination and God is no longer there because Paul said is God divided I'm Perugia I'm Thunder I'm this I'm that no I'm the word sometimes I don't even like saying I'm message he because I've been born of the word I am of God right there was a time when when there was a thing that went out just in a few sir well you know God sent a prophet that had its space but what people did they got stuck there God sent a prophet that was not the end of the story that was not the end of the plan it moved from God sent a prophet to Jesus Christ is here right hello somebody John said behold the lamb of God this message that the Prophet brought was directing us and pointing us to Jesus Christ there is no other gospel and I'm gonna tell you something you know where you're gonna get your fight among us your enemy is of your household just like Cain was in that household hello that's where that's where that because people don't think you blaspheming brother you shouldn't say that like that I said you know what one time I was in I was in up there in Michigan preacher that Samuel Johnson and I was preaching the type how the first people that came out with Moses died in the wilderness yeah you know they they were with Moses it's all Moses eat bread they they saw Moses whatever he was doing saw him go up the mountain all that you know the mean and yet they died a brother a brother you've gotta be careful you called a blaspheme I said blaspheme I said that's a sure type that is a real type look at the condition and God through the prophet I said there will come a spiritual bride you can't be a spiritual bride without the Holy Ghost that means they're coming somebody of people that's going to come back to the Holy Ghost because that is the message hallelujah you can't make a rapture without the Holy Ghost call it and I know I know why he called it the token now I know why he calls it the token because you know people you know I got the whole ego cuz I spoken up but he called it the token because that token is the life literal life of Christ in you it goes down to the soul huh and it doesn't matter I said Lord just so ignorant man like me orbs slow to learn and all of these things how I'm going to ever learn all these deep things these preachers be bringing going all into the Old Testament and typed out what a cup it with a cup and they can do it and I think Lord how can i huh you don't give it to me like that so you know my point is that means I'm gonna miss it now Paul said you can understand all mysteries you can have faith to move mountains you can give all that you have to feed to the poor what was he saying religion religion it's not gonna be something special maybe with religion can do million things but there are those who are elected in chosen of God ah oh who may not understand all the mysteries but one thing for certain they got ahold of Jesus and Jesus got ahold of them but they make you feel stupid people try to make you feel stupid they got their little cliques in their own clans and if you don't belong to this and belong to that you're not deep enough you're not you're not up in the high echelon people I know what I'm talking about and let me tell you something people it doesn't matter what they say is that right there was a rancher who needed a wife for his son and they were all partying and all nee all he looked cute dresses and whatever more right and the rancher said son says I don't want that kind me too brother I'm in the bunch yo anybody my point is they were and y'all know it's the truth now you go to mrs. church and they all fancy they all got all these instruments which is ok but brother they got all those instruments and the girls at the system cook cooked up whoo I went to one church that's all Lord let the Holy Ghost some people have been strangled to death Hollis got all those hookup you know that is not what a pillock austere church look like do you mean that is not of the original not with a clinic or some people used to get tin cans sticks and everything else they could find to make music raggedy voices they didn't care about that stuff they were interested in glorifying God and seeing the Shekinah glory come down but now we are Antichrist is moving in that thing so slowly we are performing entertainers and God is not moving now hear me I'd rather have a people that has holes in the bottom of their shoes but know how to scream hallelujah we gotta get back all of this nonsense this this this problems like you got to have a church yeah well it we're at etiqa see ya what's the word annex Church annex how to behave in church I'll tell you how to behave let the Holy Ghost fall we'll show you how to behave right in church hallelujah that's the gun folks I'm so desiring to see the Holy Ghost fall in this place to everybody lose everything I wouldn't care if you a popping up into each other as long as the Holy Ghost Oh God and mercy I came out his standing people set up in church like they in some kind of classroom it oh come on brother Brooks were snakes oh I can't take it give me a hallelujah waving of a hand or something stomping of a foot yeah y'all y'all y'all see I came up in the south oh and we didn't have real good instruments and we didn't have everybody that can play everything we had one little peon and maybe that person learn by ear right that's why you hear me stuff but sometimes it's just in me cuz that's all we had we had that tambourine and iPad will defeat mestop oh my god God would come in their place huh see it ain't all his fancy stop that's the devil didn't I say that too loud for the books you're gonna get in trouble I don't care people need to realize Amen that something is going wrong and this message is ordained to produce what it said is going to produce it's nothing wrong with the message it's we is what has happened to us we've allowed that little smooth character to come in and dignify the church and we're not supposed to be dignified we're supposed to be a bloody mess huh people can't even get the Holy Ghost cuz we ain't hot enough and we think it's okay is not okay if the rooster don't come in and work with those eggs they'll never hatch okay how many we get in here we need God to come in and touch some lives I don't believe that the all on my hands okay seriously let me go on let me come back now here sits down to make it real clear everybody we thoroughly understand that I believe that divine healing is nothing that any individual on earth can do for you Oh somebody help me here it's Antichrist when you think is you its Christ Jesus never healed nobody it always was the spirit God I can't do nothing except my father show me divine healer ain't no such thing the only divine heal is one and that's Jesus Christ hallelujah see the effect of the atonement of the blood of Jesus Christ at Calvary see what I'm saying divine healing is nothing that any individual in this earth can do I believe that is the effect of the atonement of the blood of Jesus Christ is Calvary I don't believe that any oil out of my hands would heal anybody you say I'm trying to tell you that's Antichrist even though people don't see it that way just that little thing is Antichrist if you're launching somebody with all and expect to all to heal him you are in in the inspiration of the anti I don't believe it has anything to do with it and I believe if I claim so I would be absolutely Anti Christ actually says taken away from Christ if there's any virtue in the oil for my head or anybody else had or from anything else that come for me is taking away from cry Calvary and it'll be Antichrist against Christ hey I do not believe that there's any power in the men a man to heal another man I believe that the only thing that any man can do rightfully now of course we have people that believe that they they have such things but I don't see how Protestant people could condemn the catholic old holy water then if you if you could go for such as that see but there that was really good one hallelujah but where there is isms remember friends it's only a kind of a real genuine healing of God oh yeah hey second John for 311 I told you won't be long I rejoice greatly that I found of that children walking in truth as we have received a commandment from the father and now I beseech thee lady not as though I wrote a new commandment what the Bible says if they say he's in a desert don't go see why because that's Antichrist if he's over here or over there he's done don't go I now beseech thee lady not as though I wrote a new commandment unto thee but that which had from the beginning that we love one another and this is love that we walk after his commandment this is the commandment that as you have heard from the gate beginning you should walk in it for many deceivers are entered into the world who confess not that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh this is a deceiver and an antichrist see so I was telling a brother he said brother books he says I wouldn't know whether I got the Holy Ghost I said fog let me say it like this brother there's something hollering in you I said you were either thirsting for the Holy Ghost or you got the Holy Ghost and want more of it I said because now I said let me ask you a question I said do you love God he said yes I said well where did that love come from and what is it that's God in you hello that's God in you so how did he get in there outside of a birth something took place and what you need to say brother but I just said listen if you want to pray just ask God to give you a shout and a dance and that's what you want but don't ask him for the Holy Ghost cuz he didn't you brother you got it everybody wanna feel this and feel that we're asking for the jump in the shout because if you living a life that Christ can only live that is the holy gold you've changed you turn from life unto death that is the Holy Ghost you say Oh what do me I said what brother you must understand the Holy Ghost must mature you must mature into Holy Ghost right brother Brennan say excuse me Paul said grow up into him but when you confess the law with your mouth and believe in your heart that you are saved that's when the seed is quickened if there is a seed is Quicken right there you become impregnated that's not a birth yet it is a quickening it is a life beginning you understand me but the real birth comes by water blood and spirit when that woman comes and she pushes you through that channel of birth or that depth Channel so that's what it is hallelujah and you go where that is your birth that's when you become a real baby you don't have to depend on mama no more from that standpoint right whoo if people could just see God's Word is perfect you come from justification to sanctification and all of those things are absolutely the Holy Ghost moving in you Allu yuh justification in his life justification sanctification in the baptism the Holy Ghost thank God for a prophet that came and says and yes that ain't the end the Holy goes to baptism the Holy Ghost is just enough fire to bring to burn everything out of you so Christ Himself when the Lord struck that thing I said oh do y'all realize this you personally get the fullness of Christ my bottle whoo get fool you hear them saying the early church changes couldn't get all of that not all those virtues were in Christ Jesus divine nature and here the Bride of Christ come to a place she she comes to a full maturity to have Christ in her as an individual I don't know whether you see it like I see it but you know what amen the Bible said in him dwelt the fullness of the Godhead bodily and in the bride of Jesus Christ dwells the fullness of the Godhead bodily that is a quote see the devil is trying his best to keep us from reaching the goal but he no matter what he does he cannot stop us okay Antichrist beard oh no the bride is already designed to know the difference I used to say to my people I used to say why is that brother we used to we used to battle all the time about all the time all no Holy Ghost not our brother don't even believe the message he's out there in Florida preaching a Trinitarian doctrine and he was one of the greater preachers on this message I don't think no I heard anybody that can lay it out like he did with an anointing whoo but we used to always he was another under that floors and of perugia and he and I would always battle brother you ain't got to go through all I said well all I know is that brother Branham preached several messages God provided way and he never changed he said you a baby knows how to get what he wants by way of crying whoo he say you ring a bell and it ain't gonna work cause that ain't God's design you won't you really won't it just like I told the brothers this morning I say you won't the Holy Ghost I'll tell you what you start at the beginning you confess the Lord confess your sins and let the Holy Ghost bring all the things that you need to be sanctified oh and when you come to that place that something's going to happen right because nobody anybody couldn't go beyond the veil right that was only given to the high priest and I didn't realize what was happening to me because that happened to me once or twice I was praying travailing before the God before the Lord all of a sudden of fear King and Satan said if you go any father you're gonna lose your mind didn't know what I did I would backed up and you know what God revealed to me is that I didn't trust him you gotta trust God the devil will be there to frighten you he would try his best to keep you from that place but you gotta trust God and then God brought to me my attention he said now if you ask for our bread dude I will never give you a serpent see cuz the devil make you think if I go this far a devil own kitchen is no devil gonna get you the Holy Ghost is waiting behind there oh is that right it's the true sister sisters know who had children you come to that place you feel like you're gonna lose your mind and that's exactly when the devil stay put the doctors they push that's the truth and they studies in a caterer he said push and that's what the Holy Ghost is trying to tell you push if you want to say push I say press keep on pressing lujah for many deceivers are entered into the world who confess not that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh he said this is a deceiver and an antichrist look to yourselves that we lose not those things which we have wrought but we see before reward whosoever transgresseth and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ have not God in the doctrine of what Christ's Holy Ghost gospel Holy Ghost doctrine right the Pentecostals went off on it because they tried to make everybody speak in tongues and that's all they got hallelujah but now that we got the message we got the real word of cause we know that that veil that entrance into the Holies of Holies has been made plain to us because Peter said of you these things abide in you you will never be barren nor unfruitful neither will you fall hallelujah and you and I need to be pressing we need to be seeking God amen as often as we can because listen if this thing that's coming to me is correct let me leave it but I'm gonna tell you something it's later than what most people think later than most people think when I told the people down there and say huh some of y'all ain't even sanctified and you think you're a virgin hello that's the enemy that's the Antichrist just told you that huh because the power of the blood will sanctify you he too is the power of you trying to tell me that the power who is God cannot sink to fire you that is a life-changing force it will train you if you let it Alleluia but you know what the problem is we so don't want the washing we don't we you know you don't like to hurt I hurt let me tell you something this is a painful way Institute it's a painful way there is no way you gonna make heaven without pain give me the pain let it be now because at some point in time in your cycle you going to experience pain right if you don't experience it in this world you will experience it in the underworld so suffer now curdle up the mind put up your clothes take your cross right and cross it's pain it's sacrificed like the brother said every sacrifice brain pain if I had a million dollars you ask me for ten dollars it won't hurt me none but if I had a million and you ask for a million and God told me to give you the million that's a different story it becomes a sacrifice yummy so you and I must understand listen don't let the Antichrist Antichrist spirit as a funny thing here to come right in here and cause you to be all starchy and you think you okay you walked right in the presence of the Lord and didn't even worship him you didn't even say thank you Jesus hallelujah whatever and you walk right out here and didn't know that you was under the influence of an anti demon a devil I call them no worship devils right well sometime I know we come in here and we are tired but that's alright when you tie it at home and you want to eat what do you do you like oh I'm so tired but I'm going to eat I'm gonna eat brother if I may not cook me no big old dinner but I'm gonna get me a sandwich or some sort right you gonna eat something ain't no kool-aid oh my I gotta fix this kool-aid right it was not very seldom you that tired now for those who like kool-aid I don't drink kool-aid but for those who like kool-aid you gonna fix you something that's gonna go with the sandwich and that's just the way it is when you really want God you you do you bring forth this sacrifice I love it the way that brother saying I'm closing he said if you want God he's gonna he's gonna inconvenience you hmm now you know God could have made it easy for that woman with the issue of blood and don't you know he you know God could have said you know I'm gonna make a pathway for you and all you got to do is go straight for him but she had to press through the crowd God could have made it easy amen for the woman at Simon's house but she had to press through the crowd and that's the way it is went guarding will make it easy it's a prophet of God said God ain't gonna just pull you through some - you gotta work at it he Co told Joshua I'm giving the whole land but you gotta fight for every inch holiness comes with the price segregation comes with the price oh this flesh wanna do the flesh wanna do and you say you ain't no net and don't you know when you resist it it becomes easier and after a while the devil leaves you ah because the devil want to be seen here you're standing alcoholic alcoholic don't continue to drink if a minister I ain't smoking no more that devil ain't gonna stay there he's going to leave eventually because he wants to be seen y'all know them cigarette demons won't be seen right all out in the cold mr. truth demons they know you don't like them and some car pulled right up to you and the cigarette oh come right out of the car and come into yours y'all had it Oh many times or they come to the muffles whatever that sucks it right on in there but you see you got to understand that God is on your side if God be for you no one can be against you and I'm gonna tell you this and I'm closing so many times throughout my ministry I've gone to churches and they put such a pressure on you that you gotta say brother branham brother branham brother branham and if you don't say brother branham you're not preaching the message i've been there and now i realize what it is that is not jesus just tryin to make you say brother branham when he says forget about the messenger hello there are times you say his name only because there are times you talk about Exeter's you go say moses but it's not all through the sermon and you don't get Jesus and the Bible said that the Lord's name is jealous hello and he ain't gonna have no other God before him he is share his glory with no one be and you gotta be even careful how people preach on the bride because it will produce pride if it's not taken through the heart of a good filtered heart with the Holy Spirit people exalt the bride of Jesus Christ like she made herself I think that's what vast I thought hallelujah and you go to these churches they act just like pastor they already in their older girlish commune and having a little fellowship and when they come in the church they don't do nothing they don't show nothing before the king that's their what is that that's the spirit of Antichrist we don't know how good we have it because the devil is wanting us to deter he want us to take that glory and put it on something else even if you take the message and think the message is to think mrs. Church save you that's anti-crime there's only one saving grace and that's the blood of Jesus Christ can't be nothing else can't be nothing else you love the Lord let's have a word of Prayer father we thank you for your grace we thank you for your mercy and your love we pray Lord God tonight that you have dine on way Lord let your word be magnified in us bring us to that complete statue of Christ Lord not just potentials but through a manifestation because you said when I see the blood and we realize that these these the attributes are the the nature the divine nature is the blood it is the life of the blood and father let the life of the blood live in me in my house Lord grant it jesus that win the Death Angel pass there see the life of Christ on display granted Jesus in your lovely name we pray amen your job no that's true I had a brother say because we didn't have the pillar of cloud up here the seven angels like something was wrong with us I had people walk in other churches and said well this don't even look like a message Church and I'm like but what a message Church is supposed to look like message churches you know what that is individuals it's not a house god don't dwell in this place he comes and he goes he he wants us to respect this place but he calms and he goes but he said in you he said I'll never leave you nor will I forsake you you you literally become the dwelling place of the Living God that's the blood he's looking for that's it's gotta be life it can't be you know you're out there doing everything you wanna do it oh I message you are do see it is what it is we've got to measure up every age measured up to what God asked them to do and this bride will not be exempt you love the Lord father God we thank you for your grace once again we thank you for your mighty mighty image Lord continue to keep our eyes open show us Lord whenever we lean or turn that when it's not right be merciful to us Lord and without you Jesus we're nothing father God we're nothing without you you are the source of our energy you're the source of our being we pray tonight that you bless and continue to bless the service here the people here bring a revival Lord may we come to a place where the Holy Ghost is so empowered in us a man there be a pillar of fire over this building lord help us Jesus shake this Iowa Lord Lord use your people that your name will be glorified that people will see you the same yesterday today and forever us now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen [Music] [Music] Christ our Redeemer food sprinkle your soul [Music] [Music] I will charge Spanish puppy Oh we'll be there to beat squad receiving just me hide in the sea singing blood and I will pass over you [Music] when I see the blood when I see the Blood I will pass over you I see the Blood I will pass I will
