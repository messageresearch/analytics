interpreter oh frank's coming by god's grace we appreciate everybody here this month being here this morning we're living in the last days and uh i trust that everybody will be blessed we're going to ask that you turn with us to isaiah and i'm so glad to see that so many of us are happy it's your sister all i ask is that you leave the rain outside the rain doesn't that kind of rain is not welcome here you see we like the kind of rain that's going to bring forth life and we should always remember that without him where would we be isaiah the 14th chapter and i am going to preach a real serious serious message this morning it might may not be the kind that you're going to shout off but i trust that it'll be a blessing to you uh just some things that god has shown into to me and it also caused my heart to repent isaiah 14. we're going to read from the uh 13th verse on down to the 15th verse and from there we're going to go to saint mark the fourth chapter i will ascend above the height of the clouds i will be like the most high god. [Music] yet thou shalt be brought down to hell to the sides of the pit precipitated mark four please saint mark san marcos the fourth chapter i don't think we are taking this message as seriously as we should know we're living in the last days what this message has declared that we would bring forth a message and the only possible way you'll assert that this could happen is that we are seed to consume this we're going to read the 26th verse we'll read down to the 30th i believe reading from the 26th verse and he said so is the kingdom of god as if a man should cast seed into the ground and shall sleep and rise night and day and the seed should spring and grow up he for the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself first the blade then but when the fruit is brought forth immediately he put it in the sickle because the harvest is come on let us pray father we thank you for your grace we thank you for your mercy we thank you for everything that you have done for us you have been better to us lord then we have been to ourselves and father we pray this morning oh god that you will give us understanding amen amen you may be seated there are so many things that i i would like to speak on this morning uh but this revelation i said has been uh a moving in my heart for some period of time and i trust by god's grace respectfully that i will be able to uh expound to you the word of god in such a way it is something that god did and has done foreign amen to a place where we would have confidence in god we talked about the secret it has always been a secret satchel the whole bible is basically a parable it is something that god did and worked with me so uh was jesus christ it is christian hallelujah when we read the book of genesis i want you to leave today and he told us about the tree of life we literally i personally thought it was a literal tree um but you got to understand the tree of life in himself where's jesus christ on the remembrance of jesus christ because god is emotion he changes his mind hallelujah amen and we know that the tree of death was the serpent himself only see all of those symbols were placed in the bible so that god could hide his truth from the wise and the prudent hallelujah in other words the wisdom of god was hidden in the form and the bible tells us according to genesis that every seed shall bring forth of its kind hallelujah if you are a wheat germ or seeds a tear could never be a seed seed and a weak seed could never be a tear you know now we know god hallelujah now i read in isaiah is a uh uh lucifer's threat he wanted to be like god and he said he will exalt himself even into the heavens and he would be like god and the prophet god said it like this you're on a good job lucifer when he can get you to to disbelieve the word of god he then can work his science is that right he approached eve whatever that they would reproduce so she took his advice to reproduce but her reproduction was not according to the perfect will of god understand me she brought forth a hybrid seed satan is not interested [Music] hallelujah now i'm i'm trying to bring something here because i want you to understand satan is still working in science and what he does he's secretary and when he brings it to you in the wrong way and you believe it you become a worshiper of him instead of god the jew because in order to worship god [Music] ignorance in our way of not knowing the truth but now since the truth has come there is no longer an excuse hallelujah it's okay so excuse me what does satan do he makes us believe lies [Music] and he tells us that the lie is the truth one thing i want you to realize that satan's so he wanted something more hello satan's spirit seeks glory hallelujah is that right and he he he will anoint you if [Music] it will show you all you're trying to do is be glorified of yourself and by yourself hallelujah is that right because that's what lucifer said i am going to do this and i am going to set over the sons of god what was he doing now understand the kingdom of god because when satan took over eden have you controlled the danger he wasn't concerned about the animals concerning about this anymore he didn't say all these beautiful flowers i've got to have him he didn't look at the rivers they're so beautiful they're mine satan wanted to make god's kingdom his kingdom hallelujah in god's kingdom it's not golden streets god's kingdom is you this morning because satan is still satan satan establishing his kingdom in the earth that's exactly why he's doing it but he wants to establish his own kingdom hallelujah as a businessman he'll work every scheme he can to make you see something the wrong way [Music] hallelujah see if he's got see a purpose an objective and a personal gain campaign and making you doing that making you see it that way because he's got a a feeling only for himself pascal you understand me when satan has you to do anything it's because he purposed for you to do something hallelujah will and whatever more he's got personal gains hallelujah now his whole deal lying to even adam his excuse me right in either la uniden and this is why god put them out of eden because edom was not ordained for the serpent identity and his kind this is how you know your nature has been changed brother branham says think about what you were asking then and what you are now where what you used to be to what you are now more than likely you have not been born again hallelujah because we were born into this world as children of darkness hallelujah we had our father's attitude [Music] would you and i must understand that god watches every motive and objective could you observe this message this is bride food let me bring it down like this now we're we're living in a strange day now where men are marrying dogs and cows and cats [Music] but that'll never work you understand me because every seed must bring forth of its kind you know what i'm going to preach this whether you like it my point is this hallelujah he will not unite himself with the goat is hallelujah is that right to show you that you know we we we you've heard me preach this there were four living creatures and that voice is it for was the voice of jesus christ coming after that that third chapter the bride disappeared in rapture hallelujah she hears the voice of come up hear that is that right and i'm going to show you things that is to come hallelujah and when when when when when john was raptured he was the first or one of the first hallelujah in the new testament that was translated [Music] hallelujah right because paul was called up and philip it was like a in other words they were the first to see it [Music] before it was given to you [Music] so he was on the lord's day he was in heaven he saw what the mark of the beast was so he saw something happen he saw the rapture of the bride hallelujah and he also saw the descending of the bride hallelujah hallelujah she has made herself ready that's where we go she has made herself ready and said hallelujah and brother brandon said it like this when you are ashamed there is something you must do to be fair hallelujah you hello and i'm going to tell you how he's doing he's a shy style see hallelujah remember brother branham he was against hollywood [Music] these demons were able to manifest themselves hallelujah is that the truth see why he taught iloncini the church the lisa through the i love lucy program i love lucy for wives to disobey [Music] to the church in order to watch i love lucy her name was lucy but they should have said i love lucy because she talked hallelujah to deceive the people situation because they say [Music] this world simond the loves of the flesh the lust of the flesh do they share the lust of the eye and the pride of life these are the through ran three rams that satan's worked through let me ask you a question everybody is so illuminated to this morning you're so excited let me ask you a question listen [Music] don't recognize the enemy he will put a leak he'll put a hole a leakage where it won't be able to hold the virtues of god is that right you say well what do you mean i feel like i have to go a different way but i'm gonna go anyway listen [Music] to release was there for the oncoming bee or the oncoming person his beauty was all for someone else for himself you understand me that's the way jesus walked is it constructed it was never he did not come for himself but everything he did was for you and me or you and i listen everything he did all of the struggles all of the heartaches all of the pain he took it he took it he took it and it was because he had a purpose and that purpose was that his life would be shared with you hallelujah self-exaltation i don't know what all he wore but no doubt when solomon would enter into the temple everybody would watch his dress solomon be shot today solomon and then god said but solomon could not even touch the lily hallelujah why because solomon's enhancement that's good of himself was solomon's enhancement support hallelujah it was solomon's doing city but the lily la he was born with it it was given to him amen he had to work hard for it we're talking with two seas i haven't even got to where i want to go but let's just talk about cain and abel what was the difference because cain was aggressive cain uh to please himself it wasn't about pleasing god he sought to please himself hallelujah and then please in himself god rejected and in this meekness he represented god [Music] and god took a lamb did you have it and sacrificed it before abe us for abel to show [Music] for [Applause] those things that we have to be careful of i can see some of y'all you don't even understand what i'm trying to get to but may god help you bring it to the place where you can see it i'm telling you the influence is you are making satan a god over you when you allow yourself his servant is that right that's your bible to see this great antichrist and the antichrist is already in the world everything that's against the world so what does he do that's why people struggle women struggle with makeup because satan tells you that is right it correct is that right oh yes satan tells you it's right and it looks better scientifically right remember brother branham said the satan hallelujah he did it with all of the false things that he can give a woman hallelujah now there's nothing wrong with you know certain things yeah if you need false teeth get you something when you start putting all kinds of colors in it red white and blue orange and green and yellow all those things are wrong but i'm telling you something this morning we've got to be really watchful we've got to really be careful hallelujah i'm telling you brother i'm talking about hideous sights in this day i didn't know y'all looking at me like i'm crazy god know what he's doing jesus said your faith and whether you like this or not i'm getting rid of this i'm getting ready to bring something this morning so that you understand you will not reach perfection is that right oh this yesterday i was thinking about this message i said think what he did what this devil has done that youtube just started hallelujah is that right he gave david on youtube on youtube and every time bear sheba would come out the devil told david it's okay to get bathsheba does it go guess what david believed he believed the devil's life thank god all things work together for the good of them that love god [Music] david was a type of god [Music] but listen god cannot be destroyed because he has no beginnings [Music] and he's the greatest of all you say oh david oh david wasn't the only one he gave samson or youtube you can hardly get them out you can't pray you can't read your bible hallelujah why because those thoughts are in your mind same scientific thing that the devil is doing with you is it true well cause of you to forget your purpose [Music] oh don't tell me that's not true right hallelujah when lot went down to sodom hallelujah his purpose was not to become a sodomite hallelujah all of his whole church went down there and forgot their purpose he did this on july he destroyed all of the make believers with them hallelujah listen people he was on the outside [Music] because i [Music] you must understand this is not you hallelujah and if you have not been changed you must still know you need to be changed hallelujah is that right oh come on somebody you had jacob and esau jacob hallelujah and the pride of god said that esau looked like a better christian than jacob the difference between the two only was the i don't care how bad you are but if there's a real thirst of god something in supposed to be a better christian that is the seed of god speaking see in you hallelujah and god will make it possible but it cannot be if you water the seed or plant the seed you go to bed at night you wake up in the morning sunlight hits the seed in this room i don't care how much message you say hallelujah and everything anybody in here want to make a rapture oh my i'm already in the rapture brother well if you are in the rapture you must be changing this on the face there are changes that's going on in you throughout amen why do you think the scripture says remember huh do you think this message come out for 60 minutes if the blood but that's the problem you try to see to choice what did you do to be justified you gave your life to god you cry hallelujah you identify the sin you don't even know you ask god to cleanse you if they wanted you to believe god take it away yeah is that right james says when we are drawn away we are drawn away with our own that when you go after those things of the world is in you let me read you it like this here is what i'm trying to say to you what's this crucial the law of reproduction is that each species secret cyclist brings forth after its own kind the and the herbs yielding seed and the fruit trees yelling fruit after his kind especially whose seed is in itself because the prophet god goes upon the earth and it was so is it a few and see whatever life check was in the seed came forth into a plant and then into fruit he said the very same law applies to the church today whatever seed started the church will conquer and [Music] [Music] this is in order to be united with him am i crazy you've got to be in his image be united with him hallelujah a lamb must marry a lamb a lamb yolks up with the lamb not with a cow not with a goat not with a dog a lamb must be a lamb how will this nature be changed without the holy ghost because it is the holy ghost that brings on the change about the transformation of your nature i'm not saying you're not saved he said this is in order to be united with him they will be one it's uh they will be the very manifestation of the word of god they will produce their creeds the bible says according to romans 14 17 were there any cars is he everywhere were there any jets does he have the jets no no but there was such a beauty to the devil says i think i'm going to build babylon like this you see right the old babylon had swinging gardens like the garden as the second adam come on hallelujah he ruled he could say to the tree be moved and the tree had to move hallelujah it was not that adam would just get so tired there was no laboring other than by the spoken word if he wanted to transform or transport himself somewhere he could do it don't tell me that's not true it is true hallelujah because that's exactly what god did to philip that's exactly muscular is that right he transported him to yeah so you say well what do you mean even the prophet of god tells us that we would be able to travel like a thought diversity hallelujah we're talking about the sons of god we're talking about the seed that's in you follow us hallelujah and let me tell you something listen whenever you get to a place god is not satisfying you you are in trouble hallelujah you love the lord it and that's eternal life said if you don't man that same book some members stood in the garden of eden hallelujah remember even the word of god i got the scriptures the world could not even contain it so let's put it this way in the book of if brother branham preaches a message revelation the book of symbols so everything up there is a symbol it is something that god uses to give you understanding and revelation by and the reason why he does it this way is to hide it from the wise and the prudent but if you go to uh matthew and you don't have to go there matthew talks about a seed my trip that was planted some fell [Music] hallelujah you and i have been ordained for the purpose of now i don't use all of that stuff we have youtube for the church service there's a whole youtuber so understand that everything is good and evil you are you you are the one you make what is good is it good and you make what is evil evil hallelujah you understand me so we understand by god's grace we talk about power and demonstration hallelujah let me let me read this other quote here brother talks about it in the rapture he said the life of christ and the life of the seed which laying in the sea and the baptism of the holy ghost comes upon it is bound to bring that seed light so you and the someone they asked me the other day how can you add these virtues i know all of us want to know how can i say commercial grocery store [Music] was hidden in the scene you understand me all you needed to do the sunlight in the water if you're the good earth it'll you've got to nobody wants to be left behind person hallelujah you love the lord now just give me a little more time now you and i must understand obviously what did and in the holy ghost paul said even some of you all would you took me as being jesus [Music] to see he said there's only one door there's always been one door yeah you can shoot both and that's jesus christ this is just a christopher he said we're noah preached on the ark we have appreciated hallelujah now isn't that amazing because jesus come to the pharisees he said you're standing in the door you won't go in and and entering and that was the only way you could get in legally yeah god has made a great entrance and abundant i've given you something more than what you need to get in here the problem with us the problem is that we need more humility we need humbleness we need to humble ourselves before the living god we need the help of god for his mercy his grace for his deliverance hallelujah many of us are saying but i'm talking about making a rap about the [Music] to have his way in your life so let me let me say it like this morning you see the bible tells us and i'm close the bible said that jesus says i can do in the 17th chapter of saint john he's only the city of jesus father glorifies me with the glory that we have before the foundations he also said in that same chapter father you gave me glory to mother now i'm giving it to them hallelujah y'all understand me we don't make our own we don't me you can make it fulfill it you can build whatever kingdom you want to become of the world you love the lord lester we have had infallible proofs of his resurrection you know it would be it would have been better for us to remain a sinner [Music] and then to come to this message and walk away from it hallelujah yeah yeah if you can explain god away see i want you to please tell me something what's got your heart pumping something keeps the rhythm of your heart on time and when it when it skips your body knows something is wrong now if your natural eyes go blind so what i'm trying to say is there's science because she said it's limited but god is unlimited and i see god in such a way i really i just had a crying spell yesterday um in prayer though on this pleasure when i began to see what god has done for me more i didn't choose him i wasn't sure he was capable of it's not about how many times our bags lie it's not how many times i thought and come short come in the forestry paul said who shall separate me nothing can separate [Music] it is amazing and i'm going to tell you something in order to make a rapture we got to die we've got a right to all our selfish ways my way or no way acknowledge the lord in all your ways and he shall die hallelujah don't you don't consider some of us going to say oh i i got a rough move i was talking with a friend of mine the other day and here's why said that she was angry at god i said you tell your wife that ain't a good place to be that's like an air to come on who are i would i would i would make sure my wife understands when somebody don't like me it ain't my business if i'm gonna fail you understand me i don't have to worry about you not liking me i like them you know so i told him because she said she feel like joe she feels like joe how many of y'all have ever gone through something you feel like joke come on you don't even know what joe felt like but i could never say i felt like joke i mean you understand me job went through far more stuff than i've ever gone through i'm closing i'm trying to close you know how many of y'all ever had a boil a boil it's the thing that grows and festers and anybody ever had a boil an infection inside it comes out like a big i had three of those things and i was miserable asking my wife i tried to be my own surgeon i got up a razor blade and i cut that thing javier trying to get some relief you know what it did laugh at me so it's good seal back up like i never put the blade to it but it was to say that [Music] is that the truth rich young rule in lazarus lazarus never complain oh yeah again you know people of god i'm closing that's true nobody will feel it like we will in this message make things happen he drew about fear [Music] things were different this morning from these scientific things that they should jesus looking at the stuff that god don't sleep on the shoes you know that they shouldn't be looking at and then when it comes to church they don't want part of it when it comes to the reading of the words prayer we just don't have this father pray lord god for every soul lord i i tried to give you all she said i believe it is your will [Music] [Music] forgive us and cleanse us from our righteousness in our life make you may you help us be merciful jesus [Music] god [Music] then all my sins grace [Music] and clowns [Music] praise grace grace that is [Music] out [Music] oh [Applause]
