hearts father god that will hear the word lord jesus christ let us have a great service father god so thank you for everything lord bless the reading of the word father god in jesus christ and we pray amen amen let's turn our bibles to exodus 25 we read the verse 22. exodus chapter 25 verse 22. amen the bible says and there i will meet with thee and i will commune with you from above the mercy seat from between the two cherubims which are upon the ark of the testimony of all things which i will give the in commandment unto the children of israel let's turn again to hebrews chapter 10 verse 9 to 18. hebrews chapter 10 verse 9 to verse 18. the bible says then said he lo i come to lord come to do thy will oh god he taketh he taketh away the first and he may establish the second but the witch will wish by which we are sanctified through the offering of the body of jesus christ once and for all and every priest standeth daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices which can't never take away sins but this man after he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever set down on the right hand of god from henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his full stool for by one offering he has offered he has perfected forever them that are sanctified wherefore the holy ghost also is a weakness to us for after that he had said before this is the covenant that i will make with them after those days saith the lord i will put my laws into their hearts and in their minds will outright them and their sins and iniquities will not remember no more now where remission of this is there is no more offering for sin amen we may you may be seated but this afternoon i have a i have a little subject that uh entitled the altar and the ark amen the altar and the ark because if we go back to uh exodus when god gave moses uh the plane you know the blueprint of the of the tabernacle the tabernacle had that the entire thing had three different parts there are different chords the first one was the outer chord that represented justification because because that was where the first altar was meaning that people had to come and then offer their sacrifices and you know those lambs were killed and then after that the chief priests will go in into the into inside the tabernacle and then the law because the law required death for for our for the justification because the bible says that the soul that sinneth is the soul the soul will be preparing so the only way to be justified something had to take place something had to take your place it's like the prophet says that the only way for us to leave something else has to die you know we eat in order for us to eat something else to die for so that we can eat in order for us to grow something into that daily so that's that was the same thing with justification we we sinned and something had to die to take our place and make sure that we can be justified and we know as the bible teaches us that jesus christ died for us jesus christ took our places and he died for us so that we can be justified amen and then the second part the second court was the holy place that was when you entered into the temple the first court was the only place that was where the altar of incense was there that the sweet smell because when the chief priest had offered that sacrifice amen that was smelling so bad it was stinky so they had to put some perfume in it you know so that you know that sacrifice will go out we go up with that sweet smell and the prophet comes and teaches us that jesus christ is the rules of the the the rules of sharon amen he's the sweet smell of our sacrifice amen when we're done when we we have done all those bad things we've seen and you know we transgress we commit all those iniquities and stuff amen jesus christ you know our sacrifice becomes smelly because he smells so bad so jesus christ died so that so that that sacrifice become you know so that he died as the rules of sharing so that we can smell so that that sacrifice can smell good so that when we pray and our prayers go up to god and that prayer will have the sweet smell of jesus christ and then the third part was where the ark was that was the holiest of holies that was when the priest was entering there once in a year that was it was entering the the day of the atonement to atone for the sins of himself and then the sins of the people amen that was where the ark was and there the ark that was where the the the tablet of the law was and that was where the mercy seat was that was you know that was the most sacred part of the entire tabernacle amen and the prophet says that now the other courts represented justification which was their water baptist which was there what a baptism the lover set out there that was washed before the before they ministered and the altar represented the sacrifice the sacrifice place where the punishment was put or expelled for the judgment was placed upon this for the judgment was placed upon the brazen altar and the and the brush speaks of divine judgment the brush serpent in the wilderness spoke of divine judgment the serpent being seen already judged in the garden of eden and brass spoke of divine judgment like the praise and altar where the sacrifice was burned amen so that was you know because they had to offer that sacrifice first before going in and then the holiest of holies the holiest of holy represent our hearts amen because the bible says that as we read it in in hebrews 10 that that god will write the law inside of our heart it may like ezekiel said that he will give you the heart of flesh he will take away the stone your heart it will give you the heart of flesh he will rot the law of you know heart that's the bible says that but the bible says in jeremiah chapter 31 33 but this shall be the covenant that i will make with the house of israel after those days say of the lord i will put my law in their inward part and write write it in their hearts and will be their god and there shall be my people and there shall teach no more every man his neighbor and every man his brother saying know the lord for they shall all know me from the least of them unto the greatest of them say of the lord for i will forgive their iniquity and i will remember their sins no more amen god had to that was where that's because that our hearts is the sacred part amen our heart is where god dwells in our hearts amen it's word if it's where the god dwells that's where god like likes to be amen it's the same thing like in the temple amen jesus all the glory of god was in the it was in the the holiest of holy amen that was where the cherubims were where they are keeping you know uh uh uh protecting the the ark protecting the ark of the covenant amen god had to put god has to put the lord his law in our hearts and man he has to change it first before he puts the law in our hearts he has to change it first because he has to be something where the law of god remains he meant that place has to be holy that place has to be sacred that place has to be amen without sin that place has to be sanctified so god before he puts his law in our hearts and he has to change it first he has to sanctify it first he has to purify then he has to you know that you have you have to go through a transformation i mean you have to i mean you have to be converted amen before he does so because remember amen when when he was talking to and his he tell peter wait until you are converted then go and then you go strengthen my people even wait until you are converted wait until your heart is being changed then you will go continue the work that i was doing amen you'll see that those disciples even they've been with jesus even those disciples they had the greatest mastery that the world has ever seen even jesus christ himself teaching them the word teaching them about love amen teaching them about you know about living for others teaching them about about all those about all those great teachings that the bible teaches us but after but before he told them that before you go continue this work you have to wait until you are converted amen until you have been changed until your heart amen have been changed until you have received the new spirit the the spirit of god then you can go and and and be my weakness amen in order for us also to be god's weakness amen our heart we have to be converted being converted doesn't mean that you mean you you were uh uh in a catholic church you leave the catholic church you joined the message amen that's not being converted even being converted it's not like you you belong to this church and now you are now going to the other church no that's not being converted being converted is to have to have that transformation from within amen and that transformation from within amen will reflect your life from the outside the prophecy that through the lutheran age came forth the jail shall live by faith the outer court along came along came the the methodist church the sanctification age they call the second definite work of grace which come in that age and there is an outer age and then in the last days is the restoration of the holy spirit the hidden life and i'm sure right here is here is where the trouble lays i want you to see it right here is where the trouble is with the church today they can't deviate between the altar and the holiest of holies in there is where the place where the church ought to be and there is too many of them still on the outside out there instead of being in here that's the reason why that's the reason we have our days that we that we have and the lack of faith that we have when the church should be in the in its last age its last dispensation i believe we're living it at the turn of of time god's god's help tomorrow night i will prove that that i will prove that by the bible but word by word that we're living in the shadows of the coming of the son of god right now right now just watch how the scripture will prove it without the shadow of doubt even the things that's taken place is a scientific proof that we are at the end time might be any time and here the church is still dealing outside here amen here the prophet is explaining that that's where the problem is because the church doesn't want to move emma from the outer courts to the holiest of holies amen they want to stay behind they don't want to go in amen because we know that in the back in the old testament going in amen was only the chief priest who was allowed to go in once a year but after jesus christ died amen he rendered the curtain amen gave giving us the ability to go in now in this time going staying staying outside of that place even its death by going inside is his life but now the church amen they rather stay behind rather stay outside of that holiest of holies amen that's why we have our days that's what we have our ups and downs amen that's why sometimes we have faith sometimes we don't have faith amen that's why sometimes a man we feel it man sometimes sometimes we are driven by by the things of the world amen because we're not going we don't want to go in that's why we don't want to stay in there amen you'll notice that when the man when the man where the manner was come when amanda fell down amen that same man that was the same one had the same nature with the man and that was hidden inside of the holiest of holies but you'll notice that the manna that was eaten outside amen only had a certain period of time amen they couldn't keep it for two days or a day or after but the same manner that was kept inside amen that was to stay eternally amen he didn't have a dead period amen is that that man i represent also the holy spirit amen the holy spirit when he comes down amen everybody can feel it amen everybody can eat of it everybody can experience it everybody can say well i was blessing that service amen god spoke to me and and and i felt the lord and i felt god speaking to me i felt the hand of god touching me but the difference is were you eating of that holy spirit the difference is where are you keeping that holy spirit amen if you're eating it on the outside amen that holy spirit will only have a certain time amen that holy spirit will have a period and after that you know your experience will mean nothing but if you're eating but if you're receiving the holy spirit in the holiest of holies amen the holy spirit will never run dry the holy spirit will stay there forever amen that holy spirit will be there forever and when you say that where brother isaac i've been to a meeting and where we all experienced the holy spirit god really spoke to us and and and the holy spirit was there we saw people healing and people receiving the holy spirit but when we came down but when we came back maybe my place after a week or two amen i don't feel that experience anymore my revival i don't have the same revival amen i don't have the same fire but when i look at my brother here amen he's always on fire amen he always praises god the difference is where you're eating from that holy spirit the difference the difference is where are you keeping that man amen you have to keep it in the holiest of holies amen that's where we have to be and that's where we have we ought to keep it amen because the man that represented the holy spirit god send it amen anybody can eat of it like the prophet said that the bible says that he meant that the right the the rain falls down on you know on the adjusted the unjust of the g and the just but it's the fruits that shows the the first that shows the true nature of the seed that is inside of you amen amen when the word of god is spoken amen it depends on where you're receiving that word amen if it's only intellectual word amen that will that will not do it any good amen but he has to be in your heart amen he has to be in your holiness of holies which is our heart amen which is where god stays amen which is the temple of god which is where god dwells and when you can't experience you can have experience you can experience god and be lost you say well brother i said what do you mean amen the children of israel amen they had more experience than many of us here in this room amen they saw how god amen divided the red sea amen they saw how god amen created immense things and they saw how god even punished pharaoh and his army they saw how how the people of fire amen was living from be before them and going back behind them to to make sure that they were safe and they they had all those great experiences but the difference is that those experienced men didn't influence their inside amen they're inside inside of them it meant they were still the same people who left egypt and they were gonna go in the desert amen because they weren't changed amen but when you change the man when you've been transformed amen and you experience god that experience will stay there forever amen that experience will be there amen to remind you every time that you're going to stray that there is a god who lives that every time that you're going astray amen that there is a god who takes care of you that every time amen that you feel tired that every time that you feel like you don't have faith amen that experience will come back to you to remind you that hey look once you had that same experience and look what god has done for you amen it's the same thing with david amen all those children of israel so and the others they had experienced him and they've been to many wars and they fought him and people were strong and all of them but the difference is that david is experienced was there a man to remind him every time that he serves a god who lives that every time that his god is able to deliver him even from every obstacle that he will have that's when you had to face goliath even he had to remember about the experience that he had back there in the desert even he had to remind he had to remind himself a man about the experience of killing the lion and he had to remind himself the experience of killing the bear because amen that same goliath even god would do the exact same thing that he already done before amen but that's what our experiences are for you may notice the same manner that was in out in the outer court amen also in the holiest of holies but these men out here give up quickly you've met people like that would eat out there and say well brother branham i had the same thing i did this and i did that just like they did i've met that woman but i've met that woman she's always on the out she's always on the out on the on the house stop i mean there's never a worry in her mind i've met that man wherever he is he's got a big smile on his face and saying praise the lord how do you ask him how are you feeling he says wonderful and every time he gets sick the preacher comes prays for him brother he's out and gone to the next day he's just wonderful i just can't hold my blessings and my blessing somehow now the prophet says that it's the place you are abiding on you're abiding it it's where you went amen i want you to get this close remember that remember many times on the campground these blessings right now you're eating the manna the correct man but you haven't consecrated your life yet and went into a place like aaron behind the holiest of holies when he was when he was in there nothing he didn't hear uh when he was in there he didn't hear the world no more amen you're eating the correct money amen you eating the same exact things that everybody else is eating but you haven't consecrated your life yet that's the big difference even you haven't consecrated your life yet but once your life has been consecrated to christ amen once your life has been converted and when you receive the same word amen you hear the same prophet that you've been hearing all the time now you have a different impact in you amen now it'll have a different that way it will have a different influence even in you amen it's like it's like it's like uh peter amen he was received he was hearing the same word of jesus amen all the day but one time he came he came across a different event as someone who was sick and he couldn't he could be a man he couldn't heal that person couldn't be healed amen because his heart wasn't converted yet amen because a amen he wasn't consecrated him and he he didn't have the holy spirit but once after that they all been through that experience of of of the upper room now the same peter amen who was afraid now he comes out they saw someone asking him for money amen when he says that servant god i have not but what i have i give to you amen he spoke the word and that man was able to walk amen they weren't made they were able now to do miracles they meant to pray for the sick and those people were healed amen to do those great things that they couldn't do before why because at this time it meant it was the same word that they were preaching i mean it was the same word that they were listening to by the differences their heart now was changed it meant a change has happened inside of them amen that was but that was made that was that that that that that that changed the reaction or or or or that that changed it meant the the impact of the world and said of the word inside of them amen that's why we have our ups and downs amen because people don't want to go the people don't want to stay in the presence of the lord amen back in exodus amen i think chapter 20 amen when god tell moses that the death angel will pass him and he tell them to apply the sign and then god insisted and told moses to stay in there amen to remain in the house where the sun was applied amen to stay there amen does the same thing with us even when the sign of christ has been applied amen we have to remain in there amen we don't have to go out amen we have to remain in there amen because that's where the great things happen amen that's where amen we become one and we'll become one with christ i mean that's where that's where amen we talk to him personally we have a direct amen we have a direct uh uh fellowship with him amen you'll notice that in the garden of eden when god created uh adam and eve before there there were no ark amen there was no ark or no no altar in the garden of eden amen there were no altar there amen there are no they didn't have to go and kill the lamb for it for sacrifice or anything amen because they were the temple of god amen because the altar was inside of them amen because the ark was inside of them amen that's why they had that that direct relationship with god that's why they had that direct fellowship with god but after the fall amen that's when god told them to create that arthur that's when god told them that that every time that you want to meet me or every time that you want to pray amen you have to you know he has to be on that altar amen and then you understand that that that that when jesus stepped that before that also that everybody had the ability to go and offer before the law everybody had the ability to go and offer a sacrifice amen he wasn't only the chief priest amen the chief priest that came after the law that god told them that only the chief priests will come we will go and be and offer those sacrifices but but after jesus christ died even the bible says that he made us kings and priests amen we became those chief priests and men to go and offer the sacrifices amen to be able to go in the holiest of holies amen to pray for our sickness to pray for our healing amen to pray for our holy spirit and receive it amen but you say oh brother branham i received the holy ghost yeah i eat the good things of god but you're in the courts out yonder that's the reason that's the reason it don't hold on that's the reason this year you're doing pretty good and next year you back in the world this revival you're doing fine while the revival is on but when the revival is gone then you're gone somewhere else and now with the world you say oh i received the holy ghost i spoke in tongues i shouted that's all right i have nothing to say about that but why don't you what by white donut but white doesn't he hold out that's it that's what the world look is that that's what the world is looking at that's what the people are saying if you're professing this great high calling that then why and she'll what i mean why aren't you living it or what why aren't you living like that amen if you're professing that great calling amen if you're professing that god has done some great things with me and i've been i met christ and amen i had that experience with god but why aren't you living like like christ lived amen because the first time that this state that that people weren't named christian it meant it was because their lives amen reflected the life of god amen it was before because their lives their men reflected amen the lives of jesus christ that's why they gave them those that's why they they call them christians being the followers of christ amen and if you profess yourself being a follower of christ even your life has to have to reflect the same thing i mean your real life has to reflect amen the life of christ and then you see that michelangelo him and he wanted to create a perfect image of moses amen he wanted to create a perfect statue he created the perfect statue of moses but when he saw that perfect statue he looked at it and he admired his own works amen but he said that it's missing one thing because it's not talking it's not moving and then he went and it and he was frustrated because he couldn't make that statue talk him and then he broke that he broke the leg because he was frustrated and you see that god amen also had a vision of his son amen god also had a vision of a perfect son amen god also had a vision a man of a masterpiece that he was creating but the difference is that god couldn't stop with one amen god had to continue even until that master peace comes it meant until until that person comes and becomes like him him and he created adam and eve being the first his first his first works amen but but you see that adam adam chose to invent to to to see in him and he disobedies obey the word of god amen god didn't stop with him and then he had to but then then after that noah came and when the prophet said that noah died they died being drunk amen they met god didn't stop and then then after that moses came but moses failed to keep his word then after moses amen many prophets they came amen by the rain when trouble was come what trouble came for them and then they did they ran away amen but one day and when god even one day god in that masterpiece came it meant that they did to reflect him to reflect god himself amen that was the masterpiece that he was waiting for amen that was a masterpiece that was in his mind even when he was creating amen all those scents of the old testament amen but one day his vision came there amen he was seeing himself as jesus christ amen the masterpiece someone who reflected him even someone who spoke exactly what he wanted him to say he meant someone who walked exactly how he wanted him to walk even someone who went exactly when where he wanted him to go even even even jesus christ himself said i can't do anything unless the father tells me what to do amen he was the masterpiece that god had in his mind but by god amen even though he had that masterpiece him and he just couldn't step by one masterpiece alone amen that's why he had to shrug jesus amen on calvary amen that's why he had to strike him on calvary amen amen to create many masterpieces amen to create many little jesus amen so that god will looking at us and then he will see himself amen sort of god looking and looking at us amen he will see himself he'll say that well now my work is done amen now the picture that i had before the foundation of the world amen now here they are amen now here they are amen back like you know back in the garden of eden amen now here they are amen where they have the altar and the ark inside of them amen because jesus christ himself says that i am the temple amen destroyed this temple and then i will be rebuilding in three in three days amen those people didn't understand what jesus was talking about amen jesus wasn't talking about the amendment building but he was talking about himself amen being the temple of god amen by now the bible says that jesus that that jesus christ is inside of us amen making us the temple amen because inside of us amen which make us that we have the altar and the ark at the same place amen that create the perfect image the perfect covenant of god amen that was the common ground where god had to meet his people amen he was in the tabernacle amen that was a common ground where god had to meet his people amen and the prophet tells us that god meets his people in jesus christ under the blood amen and then jesus christ is inside of us amen because we are the temple amen jesus christ dwells inside of us meaning that the common ground that god god comes and meets us amen is inside of us amen because god is inside of what jesus christ is inside of us amen the rod of aaron amen the same old rod that was that aaron was using remember once that rod came you know went in the holiest of holies amen that rod became something new amen that rod amen became new amen he was refreshed amen that rod amen became something new amen at the same moment that you go in that place in the holiest of holies amen you become something new amen your old nature will go away amen there is a transformation when you go to that place even something new happens amen there's a new experience amen you are refreshed when you go to that place amen you will you will bear fruits now people will be able to eat from it amen amen that's what the prophet says that it meant the pro that's where the problem is because the church doesn't want to go in there amen the church doesn't want to go in the holiest of holies amen but we have to go in the wholeness of holies amen because being outside of that place is death amen but we have to go in there amen the reason why people are not refreshed today is because they don't have time amen to spend with him amen because they can't get quiet it may be man because they don't want to listen to what god is saying amen they can't get quiet before god amen by one aaron was going there amen amen he was going there and meant to to hear what god was saying amen that was where god the presence of god was amen amen that was where it meant the glory of the shekinah was amen he was getting there amen admiring him at the works of god amen amen amen because even the cherubims themselves they had to hide their faces they meant they had to cover themselves amen because the place that that place was a holiest place amen so that that's why when when the chief priest was going there eman had to sanctify himself even he had to wash himself even he had to even he had to cleanse himself from everything that was unworthy even he had to go there amen now that place is inside of us in a meaning that we have no room for for sin amen we have no room for error amen we have to be a holy we have to be a holy people amen we have to to to sanctify ourselves every day amen that's why paul says that i killed myself amen i killed this body daily amen because inside of me dwells the the body of jesus amen the side of me amen dwells the the altar amen the the ark of god amen that's why my body has to be a holy that's why my temple this temple has to be a holy temple amen that's the reason why jesus when he went to the temple and saw people selling and and and changing money and doing all those stuff that wasn't only that wasn't holy even he had to destroy those tables and then he had to to to to kick those people out of that place and he says that the house of god is called the house of worship amen is called the house of prayer amen and if you have the house and if you are the house of god that means that your body is also the body of we pray amen that means that your body is also the body of worship amen that means that amen is where you go when you meet god amen because god is inside of you amen that means that you have to treat it even like the house of prayer amen that means that you have to treat it amen let the house of worship amen that means that you have to get away from everything that defiles this body amen you have to get away from everything amen that that ruins him at the body of god or the temple of god amen the the veil had to be divided because it was separating those two those two courts it meant because the veil before the before the fall that we didn't have the veil wasn't there before then amen because god was going down every night and and fellowshipping with with adam and eve but after the fall amen he created that veil because seeing god was death amen because touching god amen was an automatic death amen but now after calvary even had to destroy that veil amen because god wanted that unity with his bride amen god wanted that fellowship to be wanted to restore that fellowship even so that so that we we can become one with him amen so that we can see him we can touch him we can hear him even we can speak to him amen that's why he rendered that veil even so that we can go to that place amen now in making the altar and the ark in one room amen where you can offer your sacrifice amen and and then god the presence of god will be there amen making the ark and the art in one room amen making it a complete worship amen people are living in the holy place instead of living in the holiest of holies amen in the holy place amen it's good living in the holy place but there is a difference between the holiest of holies in the holy place amen the holy place amen they had a candlestick i agree amen all of that but the difference is in the holy place the word depending of the name they were depending on nature i mean they were depending on the oil that wasn't the candlestick and the those candles were burning as long as oil was inside of that of of those sticks and when the holy place amen amen was different because there they didn't have the glory of shekinah with him but the holiness of holies amen they didn't depend on the light of the sun or they didn't depend on the light of the candlestick but god himself was the light amen in the holiness of holies amen the dependent of god himself amen if the nature if the the the climate change the climate change wasn't a big woman didn't concern them because there they didn't care about the climate change amen they didn't care about it that now it's winter or now it's it's fall summer now the the sun is changing now it's sunny i can't see or it's dark i can't see but there in the holiest of holies amen god himself was there amen they didn't have ups and downs there amen they didn't have good times and bad times in there amen every time was great amen everything was great amen everything was perfect amen because they were depending of god himself amen and that's where god wants us to be amen in the holiness of holies amen where we depend on him on him alone amen we can see the life of jesus amen he was depending on christ and he was depending on god himself am i that's why he didn't have any ups and downs amen even though he was hungry for 40 days after fasting amen the devil came to tempt him amen he didn't even move a little bit because there it wasn't depending on the not on the natural food it meant it was depending of god himself and he says that the men shall not live by but bread alone by the by everybody everything that every word that comes from the mouth of god even because his life his entire life was depending of god himself amen that's what the nature of the things from the outside couldn't influence him and his his heart in the inside amen because he was a hundred percent submitted to god himself amen in first kings chapter 18 verse 30 to 32 the bible says and elijah said unto the people come near unto me and all the people came near unto him and he he repaired the altar of the lord that was broken down and elijah took 12 stones according to the number of the tribes of the son of the sons of jacob unto whom the word of the lord came saying israel shall be thy name and with the stones he built an altar in the name of the lord and he made a trench a trench about about about the altar as great as will contain two measures of seed and when you see that elijah wanted in mount carmel at the showdown amen those people those prophets of baal about amen they they came they built their own altar and then they made the noises and all of that but god didn't appear amen they didn't have fire but when did the but not when it was elijah's turn it meant to offer his sacrifice amen the first thing that elijah had to do even he had to build the altar amen because that's the basics amen that's the that's the foundation amen of everything amen if the altar is not built you know properly amen there is no i mean god will not accept that sacrifice amen that's why he came the first thing he had to do he had to rebuild the altar amen according to what god said amen he took 12 stones he meant that represented the the the the children of of jacob amen and then he built it according to god's plan and he offered the sacrifice and the fire came from above and burned that sacrifices and then he had to build the altar to show them that there is only one god amen he had to build that altar amen to show them that there is only one god because the bible says that he built it he beat the altar in the name of the lord amen to show them that there is only one god we don't serve we don't worship many gods amen there is only one god that we worship but after that after amen after after that he prayed and and the fire came but we see that in our age now after you know the pentecostal amen many things came down many doubt many people came with different doctrines and and and many things and different teachings that was false that was against the bible amen but now at the last days when god sent us the larger of our time amen before doing everything and then he had first to restore the altar and when he head first to restore the altar amen to bring us back in the world and to bring us back in the word amen to restore that altar because that altar was destroyed even with those doctrines and and and deeds and and all the things that that that the people before him even came and preached and then he had to do you had to restore it first amen he has to restore it saying that there is only one baptism amen which is in the name of on the holy in the name of the lord jesus christ amen he has to restore the mean amen the mystery of the fatherhood sonship and the holy ghost amen saying that it's not three different gods but there is only one god amen he had to restore it saying that amen it's not three different bodies or there's that or the the the father is different from the the son and the son is different it meant from the holy ghost but those things are the same one amen by god reflecting himself in different amen in different times and in different bodies and when he had to restore that teaching amen he had to restore the order of the church and when he had to restore the saying that there is only what's up there is only there's only salvation in one name and that name is the lord jesus christ amen he had to restore him and above marriage and divorce even he had to restore about the serpent seed amen telling the people that it's not the apple or or some kind of fruits that people were thinking of or if you meant any kind of doctrines it means telling them it meant exactly what it was and then he had to repair that altar and then he had to repair it so that the blood of jesus christ can be on it amen then the fire will come and people will be changed and then he had to repair it iman so that so that people can be changed they made so that people by hearing the word of god amen that word were having the impact in their lives even he had to do that amen amen ii chronicles chapter 26 verse 16 to 20. amen that shows us it but when but when he was strong his heart was lifted up to his destruction for his for he transgressed against the lord his god and went into the temple of the lord to burn incense upon the altar of incense and azaria the priest when went in after him and with him and with him fourth corps priest of the lord that were valiant men and that we stood uh husiah the king and said unto him it up uh uh it belongs not to the usayah to burn incense unto the lord but to the priests of the sons of aaron that are consecrated to burn incense go out of the saint go out of the sanctuary for thou has trans trespassed neither shall it be for that honor from from the lord god then uzziah was was rough and had a sensor in his hand to burn incense and while man while he was worth with the priest the leprosy event rose up in his forehead before before the priest in the house of the lord from beside the incense altar and azaria the chief priests and all the priests looked upon him and behold he was leprous in his forehead and they thrust him out from dents yeah himself hasted also to go out because the lord has meeting him even here the bible is only teaching us that that work of offering sacrifices of burning amid the incense amen only the children of aaron was able to do so amen it was given to them after the law was given and many was given to them amen they had to do all it was only the chief person was supposed to do that amen if you're not a chief person you try to do that work and then god had to punish you they're right there in the same place amen that's why amen that's why this king was punished amen but when jesus died amen he made us chief priest amen he made us he made us kings and chief priests amen to be able to do this work amen to be able amen to pray for others and god will heal them amen to be able to pray for others and god will god will hear our prayer amen to be able to pray and to go before him and to offer our sacrifices to offer our body as sacrifices and god will receive it amen that's why he had to die to do that to do that now why why do we have an altar amen in our body amen there is something that we call the kidney amen the kidney help us to get rid of all the toxins in our bodies amen amen the toxins amen comes with you know the the medicines that we drink and that we that we take and you know some food that we eat and all that i mean they have their certain level of toxicity you know in it now the kidney i meant the the kids the work of the kidney it meant it it cleanses it in other words it clenches our body i mean it takes it get it get rid of those uh toxins because those toxins it meant they can't kill us amen that's why the killing it meant the kid is there to get rid of it amen and spiritually the toxins amen is you know the sin that we do and things that we do that are against the word amen amen those are the toxins spiritually amen and and and and then all medicine that we take and man has they have toxin they have toxic toxicity in them and it's the same thing when we leave we see different things our ears and then hear different things and and and we think about different things that are wrong amen we touch things that we're not supposed to touch amen and those things amen they come to destroy our spiritual life amen they come to destroy our spiritual life but we need the spiritual kidney amen which is the holy spirit amen to come and to take away all those toxicity out of us amen to come and cleanse us every time that we do those things amen every time that that we see things that we're not supposed to or we hear things that we hear things that we're not supposed to him and we need that holy spirit a man to come and and to clean us amen to come and clean us amen that's what the altar was for amen the altar was there amen people after doing all those wrong women of people after stealing and and and doing all those bad things and then they were coming there so that the altar to the altar to kill a lamb so that the lamb would take their place and die for them amen in other words to clean their to clean those uh to clean them from things that they did but the blood of the lamb couldn't clean them completely amen that's why jesus christ died even so that when he died he meant to clean us amen to change our lives he meant to change our nature amen that's why he died amen he died on that altar even there in recovery he meant to clean us and meant to make us pure he meant to make us clean and because on the altar amen that was the place that you were coming in communion with god amen because your sins were forgiven and your sins amen you didn't have your sins anymore amen you became amen you be you you come you came in communion with god and then the altar was not a place that people was coming to justify themselves i mean it was not a place that people were coming to give reasons amen of why they did those bad things even in in the altar it meant it wasn't a place where people coming to prove where people was were coming to prove themselves that they were right i mean by the the altar was a place that people was were coming to humble themselves it meant to to recognize that things that they've done was wrong even that they did some they did some things that was wrong so that's why they were coming to the altar amen and when we come to the altar amen we don't have to come we don't have to justify ourselves even when we go to god in prayer amen we don't go to justify what we see amen we don't go to justify we tell god that we sin because this brother was out of line that's why we say those things amen we don't go to god to say that god because these things amen because i went to work and it didn't work that's why i said those things or or i was i was fighting against that brother because i was nervous or because i was this but but we go to god amen amen amen to to be humble amen to accept that god we have done things that was wrong and we come to you god so that you can forgive us so that you can cleanse us you know so that you can make us clean so that you can because you see that in the beginning even when adam and eve they seen amen they were blaming each other and when you see that adam was blaming his wife and eve was blaming the serpent amen and then but when we come to god i mean it's not a time to blame each other but it's a time where you come and you accept the things that you have done amen you you take responsibilities amen for the bad things that you have done amen and that's that is the only way that you can be changed amen that is the only way that your that god can change your heart that god can transform you i mean because the hardest part amen is to lay down the things that that you don't want to lay down let down amen is that that's the hardest things amen things that you like amen these things that you like and things that you can't get rid of amen that was what the altar was for it meant to go to the altar he meant to lay down everything that you that you that you like those things that you precious too much but those same things they meant they did they lead you to the wrong place amen those the same things it might they make you deny god the same things amen they make you get be away from god amen the altar was for so that we can go to god and and lay down all those things amen lay down amen all those things that are that are against the word of god they lay down everything amen that that doesn't confess the name of god lay it down there and burn it amen let the holy spirit the fire of the holy spirit burn those things in and you become a new person it makes you become something new i mean that was what the altar was for amen the altar was there it meant so that we can offer sacrifices amen after seeing amen every day on our in our lives and man every morning every night amen know what was going out amen and offered the sacrifices it meant for his children even for his family even saying that god they have been to many places i don't know what they have done but certainly they have done things that you didn't like but lord i come to you lord and i offer this sacrifice for them so that you can forgive them so that you can have mercy for them amen and that's the same thing that we're supposed to do that every day we go to god and say lord i have done many things lord throughout the days and throughout the day certainly uh i said things that that made my brother upset as i said things that that wasn't good i said things that that i was not supposed to say i saw things that i was not supposed to see but lord i come to you lord so that you can forgive me lord i come to you lord so that you can forgive me and change me so that i can become a better person so that i can become something new and then in closing i'll read matthew chapter 11 verse 28 to 30. the bible says that come unto me all you that labor and are heavy laden and i will give you rest take my yoke upon you and learn of me for i am meek and lowly in heart and you shall find rest unto your souls for my yoke is easy and my burden is light amen god himself is saying that take my yoke upon you for i am meek and lowly in heart amen that's that's how he want us to come to him amen with all meekness amen with humility amen now boosting ourselves for how good we have been or because we helped the poor that's why you have to come to god and both all the great things that you have done but you have to come to him with meekness amen because he says that himself is meek and lowly in heart amen that's how we have well that's what that's how we have to come to him amen and when we come to him this tonight amen certainly we have knees as the brother brooks was saying in his prayer and before praying he named all those people who had need and and brother orville and all the others amen all of us have needs amen we have things that we've been asking god you mean sometimes we don't receive it maybe because we don't we don't have the right approach amen we don't come to god with the right approach amen if you seek and you can't get well the bible says that if you seek the first thing that you have to do is confess your sin amen you confess your sins amen that's the very first step for our healing amen you confess your sin and then you go to the elders and they will lay their hands on you and you will be healed amen and the that's that's what the bible says amen the first thing first is to confess those sins amen for the holy spirit amen to receive the holy spirit the first thing first is to confess our sins amen that's the very step that's a very that's the first step of everything that is godly amen is first to confess your sins amen to burn it in the altar of god amen to let the holy spirit the fire of god amen burn it amen and then you can ask god whatever you want amen now now when we come to him amen you tell him exactly how things are amen don't try to to find words difficult words or big words to express yourself but just tell him how it is amen open your heart to him open open your heart to him because as i always say that we go to god we pray we go to god and the thing that we forget is that we're talking to a god who knows us better than we do ourselves then better than we know ourselves amen he knows exactly what we have done he knows exactly the time and the place and the things when that thing happened amen but we go to him and sometimes we try to hide it we don't want to confess it like it is because we we feel ashamed of ourselves and we don't want it meant that people looking at us as as as you men that people changing their thought you mean how they were looking at us but if you really want that blessing or if you really want that healing or if you really want the holy spirit i mean you really have to confess god and also in sincerity even because that's the thing that god requires the first thing amen to be honest to be sincere even even the prophet and when god told them that if you are sincere even you you will speak the word and that thing will come to pass if you are sincere amen the bible says that if you look for god you search god in all sincerity he will be found amen amen it's sincerity is the first thing amen if we are honest with ourselves amen we are sincere in our hearts amen we confess to god and god will certainly hear our prayers amen because we don't serve a god who gives a word and then he has to go after he has to go back on his word and change it after but we serve a god that when he gives his word and man his words remain true even he doesn't mind it that doesn't matter the time it doesn't matter the place i mean it doesn't matter the the hour or how you want it but the same word iman remains the same but the thing is that we don't have the same result even because we don't we don't have the same approach amen because we don't have the right approach amen amen we have to have the right approach when we come to god amen we have to have faith when you come to him amen you have to have faith every time you pray you have to have faith i mean it doesn't matter how small is your faith even as long as you have it amen you just stick to it i mean it doesn't matter how long that thing takes even abraham had to wait for 25 years and when he had to wait for 25 years before seeing his son amen people obviously were making fun of him and people obviously were laughing at him but abraham the prophet says that when god gave abraham that promise even abraham went to the market and when he started buying stealth for babies and when he started buying stuff for little boys he meant for those socks and and things and amen to create that atmosphere a man of receiving that baby and when the prophet says that when mary heard about when mary heard about the virgin that would conceive and then she went back and she was repeating that same word in your heart even in her head amen that created an atmosphere that that called the angel down amen to give her the word that she will be the one that will be the virgin that will conceive amen it's the atmosphere that we create that impact the result of the world amen we have to have the good atmosphere amen as the musician come and and when we can sing the song amen thank you jesus thank you jesus amen to create that atmosphere amen the atmosphere of prayer the atmosphere amen that you can ask god whatever you want amen and and believe that you will receive it amen you can ask god whatever whatever whatever is bothering you and believe that the same god will give it to you amen if we can stand and sing the song thank you jesus amen to thank him about everything that he has done for you in the past amen to thank him about everything that he would do for you in the future amen that need that you have amen thank him thank god as if
