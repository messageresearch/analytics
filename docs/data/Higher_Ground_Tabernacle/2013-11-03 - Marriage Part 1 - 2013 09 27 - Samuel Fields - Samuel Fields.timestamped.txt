[7:55] thing and
[7:57] God he knows
[8:00] exactly how you doing and God knows
[8:04] exactly how you are doing and and yes
[8:10] I'm posing a marriage is failed if a
[8:14] husband relies on the LA to keep the
[8:17] wife say it again I personally believe
[8:20] that marriage has failed I I personally
[8:23] believe that marriage will fail if if
[8:27] if if the husband trust the Lord to keep
[8:31] the wife if the husband trust the Lord
[8:34] to keep the wife keep the wife amen and
[8:37] wife trust to keep husband amen sir in
[8:41] the marriage
[8:42] amen
[8:46] and no I can't I didn't understand
[8:57] that you see
[9:00] if you on the Lord to keep your wife if
[9:03] you rely on the Lord to keep your wife
[9:05] or husband faithful faithful
[9:09] faithful there something wrong then
[9:11] there's something wrong you love for you
[9:13] to do you love for her you her love for
[9:16] you should do that and your love for her
[9:19] amen and and this is where people are
[9:23] wrong and that this is where people go
[9:25] wrong
[9:29] marriage TR true the Lord can keep the
[9:32] marriage that's the reason why you're
[9:34] staying together but if that's the
[9:35] reason why you're staying together in
[9:38] love your instead of loving your wife
[9:42] husband or husband in
[9:45] them faithful instead of and staying and
[9:49] staying faithful to them then
[9:53] go best not not each other that's right
[10:00] God will do his best but you are not
[10:01] loving each other properly you
[10:06] want 10 minutes
[10:13] okay the British government did a a
[10:17] survey of divorces the British
[10:20] government did a survey on divorces and
[10:24] found but people back about 25 years
[10:28] what what the they what they found was
[10:30] that people were married for 25 years
[10:32] and they got divorced and then they got
[10:36] divorced and people were married
[10:41] between well people married that long
[10:44] people married that long shouldn't get
[10:46] divorced shouldn't get
[10:48] divorced and so so looked at the
[10:52] situation so they looked at the
[10:53] situation what I found was what they
[10:56] found was that the the
[10:59] the mom and dad the mom and dad the
[11:02] children work together to bring their
[11:05] children up yeah Mom and Dad were
[11:08] together to bring their children up they
[11:10] brought the children
[11:12] up so they brought the children
[11:16] up
[11:19] and and when the children left home when
[11:23] the children left home they had no
[11:25] relationship with each other they had no
[11:27] relationship with each other and so so
[11:30] instead of enjoying retirement together
[11:34] and instead of re enjoying retirement
[11:37] together and enjoying the grand kids and
[11:39] enjoying the grand kids they had no R so
[11:43] so they they wound each other up they
[11:47] had no relationship with each other so
[11:48] they wound each other up we were all
[11:51] faults we all have faults we have
[11:53] problems we all have problems but
[11:55] because they didn't have relationship
[11:58] but because they didn't didn't have a
[12:01] relationship they left they left the
[12:04] marriage the
[12:05] marriage if you do that if you do that

[18:57] and these things
[19:01] basic message teachings these these
[19:04] things are basic me message
[19:07] teachings and we got to be very careful
[19:10] and we have to be very careful how we
[19:12] live how we live if you got Holy Spirit
[19:15] in you if you have the Holy Spirit in
[19:17] you you do you want you can do anything
[19:21] you want you may say can I sin you may

[19:39] you to live a life of a wife that the
[19:43] holy spirit in you wants you to live a
[19:45] life of a wife and that that's important
[19:48] and that's important
[19:50] because he becomes your head because
[19:53] because he becomes your head and and as
[19:57] I said the other night I think and as I
[19:59] said the other night I
[20:01] think you
[20:03] sisters go go out with young men and you
[20:07] sisters who go out with young
[20:10] men
[20:11] remember if you can marry him remember
[20:14] that if you're going to marry him you
[20:16] should look at his ability to be the
[20:19] head of the house you should look at his
[20:22] ability to be the head of the house
[20:26] because because if you if if he doesn't
[20:30] provide the food if he doesn't provide
[20:32] the food he'll go hungry you will go
[20:37] hungry and this is important and this is
[20:41] important very important very
[20:45] important and so you should look to
[20:50] change your head from your
[20:52] father so you should look to change your
[20:55] headship from your father to to to to
[20:58] your nice young man to your nice young
[21:00] manise the
[21:03] Lord that's basically what you should be
[21:05] doing see if you transfer your headship
[21:08] from a trusted head that's basically
[21:12] what you should be doing changing your
[21:14] headship from a trusted head to a new
[21:16] head to a new head
[21:27] amen one Peter 3 verse two you want
[21:30] another boost
[21:33] [Music]
[21:37] yes oh I love the
[21:40] word verse two while they behold your
[21:44] chased conversation coupled with
[21:48] fear whose adorning let it not be that
[21:51] outward adoring of plating the hair and
[21:54] of wearing of gold or of putting on of
[21:57] apparel but that it be the hidden man of
[22:00] the heart in that which is not
[22:02] corruptible even the ornament of a Meek
[22:04] and quiet Spirit which is the in the
[22:07] sight of God of great
[22:09] price for after this manner in the old
[22:12] time the holy women also who trusted in
[22:16] God adorned themselves being in
[22:18] subjection unto their own husbands even
[22:21] as Sarah obeyed Abraham calling him Lord
[22:25] whose daughters ye are as long as you do
[22:28] well well and are not afraid with any
[22:31] amazement likewise the husbands dwell
[22:35] with them according to knowledge giving
[22:37] honor unto the wife as unto the weaker
[22:40] vessel and as being as together of the
[22:44] grace of life that your prayers be not
