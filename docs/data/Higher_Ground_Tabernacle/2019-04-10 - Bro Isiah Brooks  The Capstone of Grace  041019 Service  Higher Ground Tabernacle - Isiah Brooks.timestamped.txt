[6:47] recently moved in from Omaha him and his
[6:51] wife and three little boys ten eight and
[6:55] five they like to stand earth into the

[7:50] himself in some people today Victor yes

[21:18] God is such a good God revelations the
[21:23] fifth chapter for me your scripture
[21:28] we're going to read the second through
[21:30] the fifth verse and I saw a strong angel
[21:34] proclaiming with a loud voice who is
[21:39] worthy to open the book and to loose the
[21:42] seals thereof
[21:44] no man in heaven nor in earth neither
[21:49] under the earth was able to open the
[21:51] book neither to look thereon and I wept
[21:55] because no man was found worthy to open
[21:57] and to read the book neither to look
[22:00] thereon one of the elders said unto me
[22:04] weep not behold the Lion of the tribe of
[22:08] Judah the root of David have proclaimed
[22:12] prevail scuse me to open the book and to
[22:16] loose the seven seals thereof Ephesians
[22:20] 1 please Ephesians 1
[22:31] Ephesians 1 we'll begin reading at the
[22:35] first chapter beginning at the 4th verse
[22:46] let's start at the second verse grace be
[22:51] unto you and peace from God our Father
[22:53] and from the Lord Jesus Christ that's a
[22:57] lot said grace be to you and peace from
[23:03] God our Father and from the Lord Jesus
[23:06] Christ blessed be the God and father of
[23:09] our Lord Jesus Christ who have blessed
[23:12] us with all spiritual blessings in
[23:15] heavenly places in Christ has already
[23:19] done it according as he have chosen us
[23:23] in him before the foundation of the
[23:25] world that we should be holy and without
[23:28] blame before him in love having
[23:33] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[23:36] children by Jesus Christ to himself
[23:38] according to the good pleasure of his
[23:42] will to the praise of the glory of His
[23:47] grace wherein he have made us accepted
[23:50] in the beloved that last verse to the
[23:54] praise of the glory of His grace wherein
[23:59] he have made us accepted in the beloved
[24:03] in whom we have redemption through his
[24:05] blood the forgiveness of sin according
[24:09] to the riches of His grace let us pray
[24:13] father God we thank you for your grace
[24:15] and your mercy we thank you for being so
[24:18] good to us father we ask that you would
[24:21] have preeminence tonight
[24:23] forgive us cleanse us from all
[24:26] unrighteousness Lord for every moment Oh
[24:29] God that we fail to give you honor and
[24:32] Thanksgiving forgive us Lord
[24:35] strengthen us Lord in your name Jesus
[24:38] Christ we pray amen you may be seated
[24:43] I based my message tonight on the
[24:51] message of grace message I think that
[24:57] everybody ought to don't listen to I
[25:00] like to entitle the service or the
[25:03] message tonight the capstone of grace we
[25:09] have heard many times you know the
[25:11] preacher preached on the opening of the
[25:14] seals we've heard about how the voice of
[25:21] God thundered throughout the seven
[25:23] church ages one of the things that
[25:27] always made me marvel was that nobody
[25:33] was worthy and when I listened to and
[25:40] hear the Word of God when it says no one
[25:44] was worthy that exactly what it meant
[25:47] there was only one who was worthy and
[25:52] that one was Jesus Christ himself the
[25:57] Bible called him the lamb because he is
[26:02] the lamb slain before the foundation of
[26:06] the world when we think about
[26:10] predestination we must understand that
[26:15] even predestination is God's love and
[26:19] His grace we see by God's grace that
[26:25] none of us were worthy and I often think
[26:28] that we forget that I was thinking today
[26:33] as I thought about the word because we
[26:38] can see how even the deed of the
[26:40] Nicolaitans how it slipped in because
[26:44] under the grace covenant
[26:46] no man is greater than the other we are
[26:50] all saved by grace no other way
[26:55] can be saved it doesn't matter how
[26:59] faithful you are in church how will you
[27:02] do with your tithing how you could be a
[27:05] preacher you can preach like an angel
[27:08] you can sing like one and that still
[27:12] doesn't guarantee you salvation you can
[27:16] be the most attractive man a woman in
[27:19] church and it still doesn't give you any
[27:23] credibility to heaven the only thing
[27:28] that can accredit us to heaven is the
[27:31] grace of God when we think about God in
[27:38] his wonderful mind I was thinking today
[27:45] I was thinking about myself and how when
[27:49] God saved me I thought lord if I would
[27:53] judge myself as how far was I away from
[27:57] God and I thought about all of the
[28:00] planets and all of the stars that are so
[28:05] distance from the Sun and I think about
[28:09] how one of those stars out there is a
[28:13] type of meat and I couldn't even grasp
[28:17] the amount of miles or the distance away
[28:24] I would be from our Sun because you
[28:31] realized that everything began with that
[28:33] ball of fire that we call the Sun when
[28:37] God spoke it you see what I'm saying and
[28:41] I was thinking I said Lord even if I was
[28:44] a billion miles away from you you knew
[28:48] exactly where I was and I thought about
[28:53] the depth of that how even how it didn't
[28:57] matter how how far I was God was able to
[29:00] light my candle he was able to bring
[29:07] something into existence
[29:09] that the mind can't even comprehend and
[29:12] then I thought about all of that
[29:14] darkness yet and still the covering or
[29:20] the masking of darkness could not hide
[29:27] of what who and what I was understand me
[29:32] let me say it again let me say it in a
[29:33] better way
[29:34] those stars no matter how dark it is out
[29:38] there are able to penetrate the darkness
[29:42] because they were made to be that way
[29:44] and even though you and I didn't even
[29:48] know who we were when we were sinners we
[29:51] were sinners some of our lives were
[29:55] wicked and some were more wicked than
[29:57] others but in the masking of that
[30:01] darkness there was nothing that could
[30:05] hide the light that God placed in you
[30:10] before the foundation of the world am i
[30:13] making sense because you got to realize
[30:16] that if the seed gene of God was in you
[30:19] before the foundation of the world it
[30:22] wasn't a physical gene it was a
[30:26] spiritual gene and that gene came from
[30:30] God and that gene in itself was light
[30:34] and the light penetrated the darkness
[30:38] and when we think about how God has been
[30:43] so good to us we must understand that we
[30:48] are now moving toward the Creator who
[30:54] created us now that might sound a little
[30:57] strange but I believe by God's grace you
[31:04] and I remember how Solomon temple was
[31:07] built and every piece of stone that
[31:11] built Solomon's Temple no matter where
[31:16] the stone was located that piece of
[31:19] ground was foreordained
[31:22] predestinated to be part of solomon's
[31:26] temple and one day those stones were cut
[31:31] hallelujah
[31:32] and brought together to build a temple
[31:39] think about it when we think about how
[31:43] the Great Pyramid was created or made we
[31:47] believe by God's grace according to the
[31:49] message
[31:50] Enoch built that pyramid and that
[31:54] pyramid was symbolic not only of New
[31:58] Jerusalem but it was symbolic of the
[32:02] body of Christ
[32:05] stones huge stones cut shaped a meant to
[32:13] bring about a what we call a pyramid
[32:17] that even man can not build today but in
[32:24] those stones we have been represented is
[32:29] that right because it represents about
[32:31] in Christ is that right the prophet of
[32:34] God tells us that even the seven steps
[32:37] to the king chamber seven Church ages is
[32:42] written in Enochs Bible hallelujah and
[32:48] Enochs pyramid in his type is an earthen
[32:56] Bible this is why they could not put the
[33:02] capstone or the headstone because in
[33:06] this statue it was perfect and it was
[33:14] covered with gold now they don't have to
[33:17] go there now you know because people
[33:21] have ripped the gold apart I've been in
[33:24] the pyramid I've been there and there's
[33:27] a king in the King's Chamber I've been
[33:29] there and there's only one way up one
[33:34] way
[33:35] ha and there's only one way out
[33:40] and in that King's Chamber there's a
[33:44] place for our a coffin but there was
[33:50] nobody there there was no coffin there
[33:55] to show that he wasn't gonna stay dead
[34:00] he was gonna rise again
[34:03] now you and I must realize that all of
[34:06] that was done for who you and I we're
[34:11] not only in the stars but even in the
[34:15] earthling Bible we're there we're in
[34:18] there somewhere it is a mystery in this
[34:22] a scientific mystery nobody knows you
[34:25] know exactly how they built it brother
[34:28] branham said amen it had to have been a
[34:32] way that they built it and and he was
[34:37] talking about how it had to be atomic
[34:40] it had to be laser way beyond the skills
[34:46] that they had we'll way beyond what we
[34:49] have now because we can't build a
[34:51] pyramid
[34:52] we wouldn't know how to we have a hard
[34:56] time with our bricks but in all of that
[35:01] it was showing that only God had the
[35:05] ability to build the pyramid no man
[35:10] could do it without the instructions
[35:13] somebody helped me hear and understand
[35:16] Enoch was a prophet and God used the
[35:21] Prophet amen to build that huge pyramid
[35:24] guess what and nobody knows who built it
[35:28] but those who are believers today and we
[35:34] know Enoch did it by the instructions of
[35:36] God hallelujah inna hallelujah built the
[35:42] pyramid and then God showed by his own
[35:46] light about that in our walk with God
[35:48] and he was found not he built the
[35:51] pyramid and therefore he was chant
[35:53] translated he was raptured and you look
[36:01] at these things and you say to yourself
[36:03] was he worthy the Bible says no man
[36:09] even though Enoch built the Pyramid he
[36:17] still wasn't worthy
[36:20] he was only worthy by the grace of God
[36:26] Holly Lou who tell somebody help me here
[36:29] because I want you to realize it meant
[36:31] that no matter how well he not lived and
[36:35] about said he walked with God but you
[36:37] must understand that Enoch Amen was a
[36:40] man built a born by a woman hallelujah
[36:48] he was conceived in sin shaped in
[36:52] iniquity and he had the sinful nature of
[36:56] a man how did he make it
[37:01] hallelujah I like to believe that he
[37:04] gleaned from the blood of the Lamb that
[37:07] was slain before the foundation of the
[37:10] world is that right had to been because
[37:16] when Jesus died I'm jumping here and
[37:18] rose again Enoch was among them is that
[37:26] right he had to bend because only Moses
[37:29] and Elijah comes to live again so you
[37:34] must understand that when God does
[37:36] things he does it in a way Amen that
[37:39] it's the mystery but the unfolding of
[37:42] the seals listen if you go back and you
[37:44] listen it meant to the message of grace
[37:46] God will flood your mind he'll let you
[37:49] see and then what he's trying to bring
[37:52] to his people we have heard and I'm just
[37:55] going to preach it we have heard about
[37:57] Abraham and the Bible said Abraham spare
[38:01] not at the promises of God but according
[38:05] to history Abraham had problems
[38:10] hallelujah
[38:11] but after Abraham after the sacrificial
[38:14] lamb of Jesus Christ
[38:16] after Calvary the blood of Jesus Christ
[38:19] the real true lamb was applied to
[38:22] Abraham so therefore there was a there
[38:26] was no record that Paul could find that
[38:31] was terrible there was nothing left of
[38:35] seeing oh there was nothing left
[38:38] hallelujah
[38:40] so all Paul could do was write about the
[38:42] good things
[38:44] Abraham staggered not at the promise of
[38:46] God and you and I must realize amen what
[38:50] was it it was the grace of God
[38:54] hallelujah Paul made mistakes but guess
[39:02] what there was nothing left on his
[39:05] record because when you are accepted in
[39:09] the blood of Jesus Christ the Bible
[39:11] tells us there was no darkness in him
[39:14] and you and I are justified as though
[39:17] we've never seen in the first place now
[39:19] don't get me wrong because some people
[39:22] want to take Grace and make a disgrace
[39:24] and the Bible says shall we continue in
[39:27] sin that grace may abound what is sin
[39:30] it's not smoking it's not drinking is
[39:32] not carousing sin is when you disbelieve
[39:36] the Word of God shall we continue in
[39:39] disbelief in what way that God can take
[39:44] the vilest sinner and make him clean
[39:48] hallelujah God can take the worst of
[39:52] worst and make him clean hallelujah and
[39:57] I want you to understand in God's Bible
[40:00] you didn't have to be a good fella
[40:02] to make it who didn't get no Ignis on
[40:06] that one you don't have to be a good man
[40:10] for God to save you you don't have to be
[40:14] a rich man
[40:15] for God to save you hallelujah the Bible
[40:19] said that will save by grace and not by
[40:22] works lest any man should boast now
[40:27] you've got to understand this because
[40:30] when you truly say you truly will do the
[40:33] work of God because you want to show God
[40:37] how much you appreciate his grace
[40:41] somebody helped me here
[40:43] you and I must understand Amen that when
[40:47] Jesus Christ came you said Oh what are
[40:49] you saying brother books I won't you I'm
[40:51] jumping I've jumped so much but I mean
[40:53] let me put it this way the Bible says
[40:55] Amen that that Jesus Christ would be the
[40:58] very cornerstone that's why we preach
[41:02] Jesus that's why no church can save you
[41:05] no bishop no pork no presbyterian it
[41:09] doesn't matter what denomination you
[41:11] think you be your part of it cannot save
[41:15] you there's only one provided way and
[41:18] that is under the blood of Jesus Christ
[41:22] is that right it was God's Way blood way
[41:26] before Jesus came into this dimension
[41:30] because the Bible said the lamb was
[41:32] slain before the foundation of the world
[41:36] hallelujah I would I want to liberate us
[41:39] tonight from the bodies and the yokes
[41:42] and then the Satan is placed on us yes
[41:44] we are to live right before God but even
[41:48] then is still the grace of God is that
[41:54] right blessed is the man according to
[41:57] Psalms 32 blessed is a man whom God will
[42:00] not impute iniquity hallelujah we are
[42:05] that generation oh I came to the message
[42:12] you came to the message only because God
[42:14] drew you and when God drew you that was
[42:16] His grace when God opened the eyes of
[42:20] the blind it is the grace of God hello
[42:23] but what did the man who were brought
[42:25] born blind for 30 years what did he do
[42:29] to marry site but nothing and the Bible
[42:36] said he was born lying that God might be
[42:40] glorified and you and I were born
[42:43] sinners that God may be glorified it's
[42:48] all about Jesus
[42:50] it's all about him it is the true
[42:52] message of grace and if we could see it
[42:55] will make her rapture because we will
[42:59] stop mixing law with grace Oh somebody
[43:04] help me here
[43:05] name one one man that did it perfectly
[43:11] all you had to do is you break one word
[43:15] even Joseph who looked like the perfect
[43:17] one lied he said that his family work
[43:22] cannot hurt us when they were sheep or
[43:24] shepherds who won that's all it took one
[43:31] one one one lie one word one word broken
[43:33] and the Bible said we are condemned and
[43:36] we're guilty of them all hallelujah
[43:40] somebody help me here you and I must
[43:43] realize the devil keeps us from seeing
[43:46] things the way we see them if we
[43:48] understood grace we will understand love
[43:50] if you understand love you understand
[43:53] faith if you understand thank you
[43:54] understand Grace and one in the same it
[44:02] all goes back to God faith is a gift and
[44:08] that is a gift of grace somebody help me
[44:13] here listen the psalmist says amen
[44:16] according to the songs one in 1820 said
[44:19] the gate of the Lord into which the
[44:21] righteous share in time I will praise
[44:24] thee for thou has heard me and art
[44:28] become my salvation the stone and and
[44:32] see the whole world can't see this
[44:34] some people think Jesus is still dead
[44:37] hallelujah some people think that he was
[44:40] it was a whole thing and
[44:42] they stole his body and whatever case
[44:44] may be but there are those who know
[44:49] differently the stone which the builders
[44:52] refused to come the head of the throne
[44:54] of the corner
[44:56] guess what he says the Lord this is the
[45:00] Lord's doing as I said and it's
[45:04] marvelous in eyes I like that word
[45:07] marvelous this is the day which the Lord
[45:11] have made and we will rejoice and be
[45:14] glad in it you cannot be glad in that
[45:18] day if you feel like a sinner if you
[45:21] think Amen your failure and God knows
[45:24] the devil has played that trick on me
[45:26] many times but I cannot be no more of a
[45:29] failure than God can be a failure
[45:32] hallelujah because when you're part of
[45:34] God oh you will never be named as a
[45:39] failure you can't be ba because of the
[45:43] grace of God am i making sense the word
[45:52] is real folks we you know when we see

[46:05] something that I'm like oh but god is
[46:07] great god is good god is God hallelujah
[46:13] in the message of grace brother Adam saw
[46:17] something that was magnificent and he
[46:21] saw three rainbows and he said those
[46:24] rainbows look like they lived and they
[46:26] were living he said and he said those
[46:29] three came together in one Bowl and he
[46:32] heard the word the Jesus of the New
[46:36] Testament is Jehovah of the old
[46:41] what was it it meant three
[46:44] manifestations of God put in one body
[46:47] and the Bible said in him was the
[46:50] fullness of the Godhead bodily
[46:52] Oh
[46:55] to help me here he is the capstone
[46:59] brother he is the headstone - what a
[47:05] body
[47:08] hallelujah a body that's one thing I
[47:12] love about a fountain that fountain
[47:14] shoots up and then that water comes down
[47:16] like this I've got a brother who built a
[47:20] pyramid outside of his church a small
[47:22] one fountain and when he built it he
[47:25] actually had he had the water coming up
[47:28] where'd that space and then of course
[47:30] the headstone there that's it it is the
[47:36] anointing that will uh how could I say
[47:38] like this the Bible says we are born
[47:42] into the body of Christ by one spirit we
[47:46] are united in Jesus Christ by the Spirit
[47:51] of God hallelujah
[47:53] c'mon Sumathi so you must understand if
[47:57] you just think because oh I belong to
[47:59] this church I'm the only one no sir
[48:01] God has stones everywhere and when the
[48:05] pressure comes God gonna pull it all
[48:07] together hallelujah yes sir yes sir
[48:13] many are saved but God is working on a
[48:17] bride that can lose herself and when I
[48:22] say it like this the Bible says there
[48:23] are now no condemnation to those who
[48:26] walk after Christ who walk not after the
[48:30] flesh but after the spirit no
[48:32] condemnation none so what does he say if
[48:36] you've got the Holy Ghost
[48:38] you have no condemnation against you but
[48:43] because God has justified every mistake
[48:46] you've made as a mistake he's made oh
[48:53] what are you saying look at Abraham did
[48:57] he justify his mistakes what about all
[49:00] the others God justified him oh come on
[49:05] somebody and I tell you if you look at
[49:08] Dave
[49:09] he David messed up hallelujah and gods
[49:13] feel justified hmm yes he did and David
[49:21] plotted he was a worker of iniquity he
[49:25] plotted against his soldier
[49:27] Uriah plotted against him took his wife
[49:32] impregnated her hallelujah and God still
[49:37] said David you are man after my own
[49:41] heart
[49:41] he never changed it and David loved God
[49:46] loved David so much he calls himself the
[49:49] son of David Oh somebody help me but
[49:54] that does not give us a right to just go
[49:56] out and sin if you go out and do things
[49:59] you know it's wrong something's not
[50:02] quite right you need to go back to the
[50:06] altar okay you now must understand this
[50:14] is not a time to glorify ourselves
[50:17] there's nothing great about me there's
[50:20] nothing great about you it's all about
[50:22] Jesus cries oh my Paul says is listen
[50:28] this what Paul says Paul said to live is
[50:31] gain halle-loo to live we're in Christ
[50:35] it's not hard I'm not living anymore
[50:38] it's Christ that lives in me and a
[50:42] brother and I we were talking we said we
[50:43] just want to see God and that's all we
[50:45] want to see I'm tired of seeing this all
[50:49] I want to do is see Jesus hallelujah
[50:51] it's my desire it's my thirst and
[50:54] because it is my desire and it's my
[50:57] thirst he gave it to me and therefore
[51:00] the Bible said if you thirst after
[51:01] righteousness you shall be filled
[51:04] oh my feeling is coming hallelujah my
[51:12] brother Oh we'll go there but let me say
[51:15] like this grace makes us glorify Jesus
[51:20] because you realize there's no way you
[51:22] could make it and I'm gonna jump a lot a
[51:24] little bit because I'm not gonna be long
[51:26] tonight it's a short message but I'm
[51:28] gonna say it like this when God told
[51:30] Adam and Eve the day that you eat of
[51:32] this tree you shall surely die I'm gonna
[51:35] come back to the other stuff and they
[51:38] did it they had no way out of it they
[51:43] were caught they would make it with it
[51:46] yeah yeah understand me they were naked
[51:50] with it God saw it but the brilliant
[51:55] thing the wonderful thing about it when
[51:56] they some self saw that they were naked
[51:59] is when they approach or God approached
[52:03] them then they realized they had no
[52:05] holiness she let me tell you something
[52:09] without the grace of God you have no
[52:12] holiness you just like Adam and Eve
[52:15] hiding behind fig leaves without the
[52:18] grace of God Hey hallelujah and it's
[52:22] God's grace that provided that lamb for
[52:25] them what's they do what did they do
[52:31] they weren't even straight up with God
[52:33] if I could say it like this they kept
[52:36] passing the buck like we do sometime
[52:39] hallelujah ain't nobody fault but your
[52:42] own if you sin that sin is on you and
[52:46] then nobody's called a devil ated me do
[52:48] it the devil didn't make nothing you did
[52:51] it because you wanted to is that right
[52:53] I'll come home the Bible tells us
[52:55] according to James when you drown after
[52:58] lust the lust is from from you not God
[53:02] now you can argue with that if you want
[53:04] to and say somebody made me do it but
[53:06] your lust got the best of you Amen but
[53:10] in all of that James said if you confess
[53:13] your false hallelujah he's faithful and
[53:16] just to forgive you of your sin and to
[53:18] cleanse you from all unrighteousness in
[53:21] other words God brings it back down to
[53:23] zero whoo hallelujah think about it o
[53:31] people of God you think
[53:34] about it here is I said things about
[53:37] glorifying yourself and you know a lot
[53:39] of in it and I've seen it I've seen it
[53:41] I've seen that everywhere and I just
[53:43] pray to God and keep me from ever going
[53:46] in a way that I think I'm something cuz
[53:48] I know I'm nothing you know people don't
[53:50] hurt my feelings when they say you're
[53:52] not deep cuz they're right I'm not deep
[53:56] and I can't only preach what he gives to
[53:58] me I'm gonna be the level on the level I
[54:02] am I if you don't give me nothing like
[54:04] somebody else that's okay I'm right
[54:05] where I'm supposed to be ain't gonna try
[54:08] to impersonate nobody because people
[54:10] don't accept me that's that's insane
[54:16] hallelujah amen
[54:18] if God done made me a flute and not a
[54:20] trombone I ain't gonna try to act like a
[54:22] trombone I'm gonna be my love flew
[54:27] hallelujah Oh glory to kasi listen Jesus
[54:32] even told us he says listen there's a
[54:34] parable according to Mark 12 and he says
[54:36] listen 1 through 12 I'm just gonna
[54:37] paraphrase it here was a man who had a
[54:40] vineyard and he set a hedge about it
[54:43] placed it you know built the tower hired
[54:47] husband and then he went to a far
[54:50] country in other words he let people
[54:55] take care of his farm but instead of
[54:59] taking care of his farm somehow they
[55:02] forgot it wasn't their farm kind of like
[55:05] the donkey that was carrying Jesus and
[55:09] perhaps the donkey got confused like
[55:11] some of the preachers and all of the
[55:14] cheering came and whoo Jesus Hosanna
[55:17] Hosanna and you can see the donkey
[55:19] almost like but it wasn't father donkey
[55:24] it was full of man riding on the donkey
[55:27] but see that's how it is with the
[55:29] preachers sometimes they think oh praise
[55:32] God I so enjoyed the Word of God it's
[55:35] okay is it couraging but it's only
[55:37] because God used you
[55:39] that was God the glory goes to God the
[55:45] frogs go to God that's why the prophet
[55:48] of God said he said I just don't like it
[55:49] when people say well you know brother
[55:51] so-and-so laid his hands on me and I got
[55:53] healed
[55:54] he said because what that does he said
[55:56] it gives them glory it gives them
[55:58] something when they don't do it ain't
[55:59] dinner
[56:00] no man can heal no man it's God God must
[56:03] get all the glory amen
[56:05] anyway these husband who was so internet
[56:11] thing beat the they they beat hired
[56:17] servants like when God was sent a
[56:18] prophet or God was sent a servant these
[56:21] men would would either be hurt or kill
[56:24] or beaten and God kept sending people is
[56:27] that right that's just the way God does
[56:29] it he always sent a witness the Bible
[56:31] said he never leaves himself without a
[56:33] witness but then Jesus came and it's all
[56:37] you see they knew who he was this is the
[56:41] son of the of the man who hired us
[56:45] listen what they say let us kill him
[56:48] that we might get his inheritance and
[56:51] that's exactly what the Pharisees and
[56:54] the Sadducees did they knew Jesus was
[56:57] the son of God
[56:58] according to this parable and they
[57:02] killed him anyway
[57:04] because they wanted they wanted his
[57:06] inheritance hello and you know what
[57:10] that's exactly what we do ignorant Lee
[57:16] God give us gifts and we use these gifts
[57:20] and talents for our own selves and what
[57:24] we do we rather kill Jesus I don't want
[57:27] to hear that gospel I want to play the
[57:30] blues I want to play rock and roll I
[57:32] want to do this I want to pray I want to
[57:34] do all and God gave you the talent it's
[57:36] not even yours but kill Jesus and so you
[57:40] can get all the money in the glory
[57:43] that's what people do in this message
[57:46] they kill the name of the messenger so
[57:50] they can get the glory
[57:52] that alright and you you know by God's
[57:57] grace that many has become millionaires
[58:00] in this message because they'd used the
[58:02] message for their own glory and guess
[58:08] what I'm not saying they lost but I know
[58:12] one thing Moses when he glorified
[58:13] himself didn't cross over took him so
[58:18] many hundreds of years before he got to
[58:20] Palestine he got there that's what
[58:23] brother Han said he got there but God
[58:27] wants blowing only God won't slurry it
[58:30] doesn't mean I guess a brother been
[58:31] saving this brethren
[58:32] no because the prophet of God says and I
[58:34] think it's easier he said a true Mount
[58:36] Transfiguration experience will only
[58:38] glorify Jesus Christ hallelujah but I am
[58:44] one that knows you cannot talk about the
[58:47] floor did not mention Noah it all goes
[58:52] together is this ok now let me hurry so
[58:56] you can understand and imma imma almost
[58:58] say this some let me let me see can I
[59:01] find that that understand that the name
[59:08] of Jesus Christ what he gate has given
[59:09] us it's so powerful I think we just it's
[59:13] become so common we don't even realize
[59:15] you know what what it what it really is
[59:17] and and and I brother Frank sent me a
[59:21] text today which was a real good
[59:23] quotient and and then went right with
[59:25] the Word of God their house preparing
[59:27] and my thing is is that we well we said
[59:31] oh we know Jesus Christ but we forget we
[59:34] are in his name your name has been
[59:39] changed if you have been born again your
[59:43] name has been changed hello why do you
[59:47] think that the Bible according the book
[59:49] of Revelation says the spirit and the
[59:52] bride say come because they have the
[59:55] same spirit and with the same spirit
[59:59] they have the same name and the same
[1:00:01] name we can accomplish the same thing
[1:00:04] that's why the Bible said Jesus Christ
[1:00:06] is the same yesterday today and forever
[1:00:12] hmm
[1:00:13] let this mind be in you him how of
[1:00:17] course which was also in Christ Jesus
[1:00:20] who being in the form of God thought it
[1:00:23] not robbery to be equal with God but
[1:00:27] here is here here it is but made himself
[1:00:31] of no reputation and took upon him the
[1:00:34] form of a servant and was made like unto
[1:00:37] men he said I can't do nothing except
[1:00:41] the father show me what did the man at
[1:00:45] the Pool of Bethesda do that was
[1:00:47] different from all the rest why did God
[1:00:50] come to him the Bible said he wasn't
[1:00:52] even a bad situation you know saying he
[1:00:58] can get in and out of the pool there
[1:00:59] were people who were worse often him he
[1:01:02] just had an affliction and God came to
[1:01:06] him and said take up your bed and walk
[1:01:08] what was that God's grace and the Bible
[1:01:13] said Jesus Christ who was full of grace
[1:01:16] and truth who was it it was a capstone
[1:01:21] at the time he was just that the
[1:01:23] cornerstone but when the cornerstone was
[1:01:26] rejected he rose up to the top that same
[1:01:31] cornerstone the Bible said has now
[1:01:33] become the head of the corner how do you
[1:01:36] think you're gonna get out of here it's
[1:01:38] gonna take the Holy Spirit hey somebody
[1:01:42] help me here you understand it is the
[1:01:44] spirit it's not by power it's not by
[1:01:46] might but it's by my spirit says the
[1:01:48] Lord that's why the devil wants you to
[1:01:51] be cold and starchy in every church
[1:01:53] because he knows it is the anointing
[1:01:57] that destroy the yokes you want to be
[1:02:01] set free you've got to have Jesus he's
[1:02:02] the only one that can set you free and
[1:02:05] I'm not talking about just Jesus the
[1:02:07] word it must be Jesus the word that's
[1:02:10] living
[1:02:13] hallelujah and you got to unclog your
[1:02:17] faith channels is that right this is the
[1:02:19] quote now I kind of add it a little bit
[1:02:22] more if you abide in me and my word
[1:02:25] about in you then you have God the word
[1:02:29] in you and you believe the word just as
[1:02:33] you believe God because it is God
[1:02:36] somebody help me here
[1:02:38] if you can catch it if you can really
[1:02:40] grasp that in your heart this word is
[1:02:44] God whatever it says it's God and it
[1:02:46] must come to pass if you believe you
[1:02:52] gotta believe it oh you gotta believe it
[1:02:56] is that right
[1:02:58] hey and if you believe that well just as
[1:03:01] you believe God's Word it is God and it
[1:03:03] is it's inseparable in other words his
[1:03:07] word and himself is inseparable then if
[1:03:11] you have God's Word in you you have
[1:03:13] God's life in you you have God in you
[1:03:16] and whatsoever God's Word speaks forth
[1:03:19] out of you it has to come the past just
[1:03:22] like it was spoken from God myself is
[1:03:31] that we need to get in that channel we
[1:03:35] need to get in the channel of God so
[1:03:37] that God can speak through us whatsoever
[1:03:41] you ask the Father in my name that will
[1:03:45] I do
[1:03:46] did you ever realize what that means do
[1:03:50] you realize if we go before God in the
[1:03:52] name of Jesus it's just the same as
[1:03:55] Jesus himself pray I know we've heard it
[1:03:59] but let's hear the game it isn't me any
[1:04:02] praying anymore if I come in his name
[1:04:05] and he and he recognize his name
[1:04:09] and Jesus said whatsoever you ask the
[1:04:12] Father in my name that I'll do you know
[1:04:16] that's the difference you can't come in
[1:04:18] the name of the Father Son and Holy
[1:04:20] Ghost you can't even come just in Jesus
[1:04:25] his name is Lord Jesus Christ when he
[1:04:28] recognizes his name whatever you ask or
[1:04:34] Jesus Christ however you want to put it
[1:04:36] because because that's why I didn't know
[1:04:39] what I was doing I had a spirit of
[1:04:40] techne years ago and I kept saying Jesus
[1:04:43] Jesus Jesus and that demon stayed right
[1:04:47] there did move and when I said the Lord
[1:04:49] Jesus Christ he left me because there's
[1:04:53] a mini Jesus you got to know which one
[1:04:55] you're talking about hallelujah hundreds
[1:05:00] of down there in Mexico hallelujah and
[1:05:04] none of them of my Savior no not even
[1:05:07] your Savior there's only one Savior the
[1:05:10] Lord Jesus Christ hallelujah whatsoever
[1:05:15] you ask the Father in my name that I'll
[1:05:17] do and then I go to the Father in Jesus
[1:05:19] name
[1:05:20] it isn't me praying anymore it's Jesus
[1:05:23] it's his spirit praying through me and
[1:05:26] then I've got to receive what I asked
[1:05:29] for
[1:05:29] right my point is you say Jesus
[1:05:33] understand you're talking about God if
[1:05:35] your revelation of Jesus is God you got
[1:05:39] it but if you got the name Jesus and you
[1:05:44] thinking he's just part of the Trinity
[1:05:46] you ain't got it
[1:05:48] you got to call Jesus according to the
[1:05:50] revelation of which he is for today is
[1:05:57] that right if it wasn't important why
[1:06:00] after all of those years the prophet of
[1:06:02] God was preaching about the Jesus Christ
[1:06:06] God comes along in the form of a rainbow
[1:06:11] and expressly says Jesus of the New
[1:06:19] Testament is your hova of the own and
[1:06:22] then the Prophet goes on and says it
[1:06:25] can't be like the oneness Jesus only and
[1:06:29] it can't be like the Trinity especially
[1:06:32] the extreme father the Father the Son
[1:06:36] the Holy Ghost
[1:06:38] see they all they're wrong there's a
[1:06:40] balance he said God was in Christ Wow
[1:06:46] hallelujah if you could just understand
[1:06:48] God was in Christ let me put it and say
[1:06:50] God was in you or crisis in you it's the
[1:06:54] same as God is in Christ the same God
[1:06:59] the same God in you and then I've got to
[1:07:05] listen what he goes on to says do you
[1:07:07] realize if we be we go before God in the
[1:07:10] name of Jesus it is just the same as
[1:07:12] Jesus himself praying it isn't me
[1:07:14] praying anymore if I come in his name
[1:07:17] and he recognized his name and Jesus
[1:07:19] said whatsoever you ask the Father in my
[1:07:23] name what is the name of the Father
[1:07:28] mm-hmm absolutely
[1:07:31] thou shalt call his name Jesus right but
[1:07:36] the completeness of that was further
[1:07:39] revealed hallelujah down throughout the
[1:07:43] ages right come on folks y'all don't
[1:07:48] know brother branham brought the the
[1:07:49] real revelation of the name of Jesus
[1:07:51] Christ the one has had a piece of it the
[1:07:56] Trinity had a piece of it but the full
[1:07:59] manifestation of that revelation came by
[1:08:01] way of Malachi 4 and he showed that
[1:08:06] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[1:08:08] and forever
[1:08:09] he's a God that changes not now the
[1:08:11] problem is we did not see the kind of
[1:08:15] grace that God has bestowed upon us
[1:08:17] Grace and peace be multiplied praise
[1:08:23] and peace be multiplied we're unto you
[1:08:27] it's when you realize who you are and
[1:08:31] there is no kind of weapon formed
[1:08:34] against you can prosper none hallelujah
[1:08:38] we've got to really start believing in
[1:08:41] the is that right come on let me bring
[1:08:43] it down to the scripture Peter only had
[1:08:46] one thing silver and gold have I none
[1:08:51] but
[1:08:52] as I have give ID rise in the name of
[1:08:57] Jesus Christ that was the that was the
[1:09:01] weapon of the early church the name but
[1:09:05] they had a revelation of the name and
[1:09:07] they understood that that name was not
[1:09:10] just something far fetched out there in
[1:09:12] the space somewhere it was in them they
[1:09:14] held the name within them they became
[1:09:17] the temple of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:09:23] that's the headstone that's the capstone
[1:09:26] you and I want to make this it's going
[1:09:28] to only be by grace grace will give you
[1:09:32] the ability to decline the latter not by
[1:09:35] power not by might but by my spirit is
[1:09:38] that right let me jump let me move on
[1:09:40] grace is that which is freely given
[1:09:43] unmerited favor and love of God it is
[1:09:46] the influence or Spirit of God operating
[1:09:49] in a human to regenerate or strengthen
[1:09:52] them it is a virtue of excellence of
[1:09:55] divine origin
[1:09:57] grace is and I thought oh god I'm not
[1:10:01] just in grace but I'm in a state of
[1:10:03] grace hallelujah and when you are in a
[1:10:08] state of grace it shows him in the
[1:10:11] manner of position that you're standing
[1:10:14] in it shows your condition I cannot and
[1:10:18] neither can you make heaven or a rapture
[1:10:21] without the grace of God because no man
[1:10:24] was worth is this okay now I read
[1:10:33] description I'm a reading and I'm a
[1:10:35] fifteen more minutes
[1:10:37] Zechariah for chapter sixteen fourteenth
[1:10:40] then he answered in speaking to me
[1:10:42] saying this is the word of the Lord unto
[1:10:44] Zerubbabel saying not by might not by
[1:10:46] power but by my spirit saith the Lord of
[1:10:49] Hosts did you know that who art Thou O
[1:10:53] great mountain before zerubabbel thou
[1:10:55] should become a plane and he shall bring
[1:10:57] forth the headstone thereof with
[1:11:00] shouting crying grace grace unto it it's
[1:11:05] built
[1:11:06] by grace well over the world of the Lord
[1:11:09] came unto me saying the hands of the
[1:11:11] roof I have laid the foundation of this
[1:11:13] house his hands shall also finish it he
[1:11:18] that began a good work in you is
[1:11:19] faithful to complete it is that right
[1:11:22] and thou shalt know the Lord of holes
[1:11:24] have sent me unto you for who have
[1:11:28] despised the day of small things but
[1:11:30] they shall rejoice and shall see the
[1:11:32] plummet in the hands of the rouble with
[1:11:35] those seven well they are the eyes of
[1:11:38] the Lord which run to and fro through
[1:11:41] the you didn't come to God God
[1:11:44] sought you out hallelujah
[1:11:48] then answered I and said unto him what
[1:11:51] are these two olive trees upon the right
[1:11:54] side of the candlestick and upon the
[1:11:56] left side thereof and I answered again
[1:11:58] and said unto him what be these two
[1:12:01] olive branches went through which
[1:12:04] through the two golden pipes empty the
[1:12:07] golden oil out of themselves golden oil

[1:12:17] and he answered me and said no it dog
[1:12:20] not what these be and I said no my lord
[1:12:25] then said he these are the two anointed
[1:12:29] ones that stand by the Lord of the whole
[1:12:32] earth hmm you know what the ruble would
[1:12:35] mean you know what brother Branham did
[1:12:36] he came to disperse the confusion but
[1:12:44] why where where did this confusion come
[1:12:46] from it didn't come from Zerubbabel it
[1:12:51] means a stranger at Babylon was he not
[1:12:53] and he was a prince did you know that
[1:12:55] the ruble was a prince I'm a reader just
[1:13:00] for you in just a minute you and I must
[1:13:03] understand that Jesus of the New
[1:13:04] Testament is your home of the old and
[1:13:08] this Great Pyramid in type is the body
[1:13:11] of Christ the New Jerusalem the holy
[1:13:13] city the body of Christ it's all of that
[1:13:19] listen the Prophet God said we are
[1:13:22] acquainted with scripture that reads the
[1:13:25] Bible we know that this was during the
[1:13:28] time of preparation of restoration of
[1:13:32] the temple restoration of the temple
[1:13:36] regarding fill in the natural temple
[1:13:38] anymore God is building a spiritual
[1:13:41] house and you and I are called living
[1:13:44] stones and God is building us right now
[1:13:51] hallelujah
[1:13:52] you think you're not going to be used
[1:13:55] but God cut some of those stones were
[1:13:57] ugly and some were pretty
[1:13:59] and yet God fit them right into the
[1:14:01] building hey God have mercy
[1:14:10] hmm so ruler was a great prince among
[1:14:14] the people who had laid the foundation
[1:14:16] there's bill now you now you I want you
[1:14:19] to put on your spiritual thinking
[1:14:21] anointing jacket this morning or this
[1:14:23] evening we think and this Great Prince
[1:14:26] had determined to rebuild the house of
[1:14:28] the Lord and when he did he had laid the
[1:14:31] foundation stone did he not do it now
[1:14:35] that's a room above us in tight back
[1:14:38] there but we experienced the reality the
[1:14:42] foundation was relayed the foundation
[1:14:47] was not Baptist the foundation was not
[1:14:50] no denominational organization the
[1:14:53] foundation went right back to the
[1:14:55] foundation that Pauline and Paul said
[1:14:58] I've laid no other foundation there
[1:14:59] outside of Christ Jesus himself that's
[1:15:03] what you build upon that's how we build
[1:15:05] upon the foundation of Jesus Christ and
[1:15:09] we know that the scriptures that says
[1:15:11] that Jesus Christ is the chief
[1:15:12] Cornerstone and he also the headstone
[1:15:15] now and we will think for minutes that
[1:15:19] the seven churches who was to restore
[1:15:22] the faith of the children back to the
[1:15:23] Father in other words we build the
[1:15:25] church again under the power of the
[1:15:28] Spirit not by power not by might but by
[1:15:31] my spirit
[1:15:32] saith the Lord not by organization not
[1:15:35] by denomination but by the spirit God
[1:15:38] will bring forth the church in the last
[1:15:40] day the moment you say Amen that if you
[1:15:45] don't if you don't believe what I
[1:15:46] believe you are denomination and you die
[1:15:52] it ain't what you believe is what the
[1:15:55] Bible says the Bible is right you
[1:16:00] understand me
[1:16:02] that's why so many people in this
[1:16:04] message have done the same thing well if
[1:16:06] you don't believe this Purusha if you
[1:16:07] don't believe this done if you don't
[1:16:09] believe this they're and they divide
[1:16:10] Christ Paul says it's Christ divided
[1:16:13] absolutely not there's only one body and
[1:16:18] the only way you get in this body you
[1:16:19] must be baptized in the name of the Lord
[1:16:22] Jesus Christ hallelujah and baptized by
[1:16:25] his spirit I'm talking about Bride now
[1:16:27] y'all talking about pride
[1:16:28] cuz bride will keep every word the
[1:16:32] problem is we don't know that a lot of
[1:16:33] people still gonna be saved who's not a
[1:16:37] part of this so that can't be right then
[1:16:41] who is the foolish virgins so rouble oh
[1:16:49] the prince with Joshua oh I love there
[1:16:52] is that right because that's what he was
[1:16:57] William Branham Malachi 4 was a type of
[1:17:00] Zerubbabel as a rule the type of him
[1:17:03] hallelujah and who was he with Joshua
[1:17:06] and who is Joshua Jesus was the one that
[1:17:11] was to bring forth the headstone he had
[1:17:14] laid the foundation here took the prints
[1:17:16] people back to the foundation in time
[1:17:18] now you know what I'm saying stuff
[1:17:20] that's been preached years ago but it
[1:17:22] still ought to be good to you
[1:17:25] it still ought to be good to you this
[1:17:27] manner should never this manner never
[1:17:29] grows old hallelujah y'all know y'all
[1:17:34] know the stuff but I'm a preacher like
[1:17:35] it I never yeah that's the way it's
[1:17:37] supposed to be preached freshly
[1:17:40] hallelujah which we all know that these
[1:17:43] can decision so forth represents both
[1:17:46] Jewish in church there were other
[1:17:49] branches the Bible says here and the
[1:17:51] five olive branch we are the wild branch
[1:17:53] that was grafted into the root of the
[1:17:55] tang olive tree Gentiles did that right
[1:17:57] and out of these two branches come since
[1:18:00] his pipes going into the seven golden
[1:18:02] candlesticks to give like to the seven
[1:18:04] churches
[1:18:05] so all I'm trying to say is we are a
[1:18:08] part of the candelabra ami it wasn't
[1:18:15] seven fires lit it was one fire lit and
[1:18:18] those one lit all the others hallelujah
[1:18:23] if the Holy Ghost don't light your fire
[1:18:25] your fire won't get lit hallelujah let
[1:18:30] me hurry up that's the way the body of
[1:18:32] Jesus Christ should be so cut by the so
[1:18:35] cut let me back it up because y'all know
[1:18:38] in arts pyramid that Pyramid of Egypt
[1:18:40] they call it the Great Pyramid it was so
[1:18:42] built it was soaked that there was a
[1:18:44] modern no mortar in between it was the
[1:18:47] stone just lays so flat that even a
[1:18:48] razor blade couldn't get through it
[1:18:50] listen we have no machines that could
[1:18:53] tear it up no machine that can lift not
[1:18:56] even one of the stones tons
[1:19:00] come on somebody there is no man-made
[1:19:03] machinery that can rip the bride of
[1:19:06] Jesus Christ apart I don't care how
[1:19:11] mysterious we may look to them they
[1:19:13] cannot divide us because we are born
[1:19:17] into one body by the Spirit of God a
[1:19:22] real believer will stay with the real
[1:19:25] believer no matter if you different in
[1:19:27] your doctrine they don't know our Holy
[1:19:30] Ghost field person when they meet them
[1:19:32] is that right grace not a disgrace what
[1:19:34] could they offer God what could they
[1:19:36] offer God what can you offer God grace
[1:19:39] is old Grace's old Grace's old as the
[1:19:42] world is grace was first shown to the
[1:19:45] human race when he had a beginning of a
[1:19:47] human race and when the human race was
[1:19:50] first created in the Garden of Eden on
[1:19:52] that dog morning when that little woman
[1:19:54] that stepped across the separating line
[1:19:56] and had gone against God commanding and
[1:19:59] a husband to do the same thing then the
[1:20:02] law was broken the law must have a
[1:20:04] penalty or is isn't no law and the law
[1:20:07] was the day you eat thereof is the day
[1:20:09] you should surely die my point is if God
[1:20:13] had killed them both it would have been
[1:20:16] the end of the human race Adam could not
[1:20:21] save Eve spiritually because he walked
[1:20:25] out willfully and Eve even if she died
[1:20:28] could not have saved Adam hallelujah so
[1:20:33] who provided the sacrifice the same God
[1:20:36] that produced the Grace in in the Alpha
[1:20:41] is producing the grace in the Omega
[1:20:44] hallelujah grace will make a way for you
[1:20:49] no matter what you are no matter who you
[1:20:52] are no matter how cold dead and in
[1:20:55] follow you may be God's grace if you
[1:20:58] have a heart that can repent God has a
[1:21:00] heart that could make it right so that's
[1:21:04] all God asks for us to do is repent is
[1:21:06] that right in the latest in ages that be
[1:21:09] zealous to repent huh
[1:21:15] think about it I'm closing on this story
[1:21:18] in spite of all Abraham's phase see this
[1:21:25] is the capstone birth system if you can
[1:21:28] see that in all of their faith
[1:21:32] God saved him anyway and David had
[1:21:38] multiple problems it wasn't bad enough
[1:21:43] to hear mess up with Bathsheba then he
[1:21:45] gonna go and count the people and God
[1:21:47] told him not to count hallelujah see it
[1:21:51] ain't your church is God's church and
[1:21:57] when you and I can realize they meant
[1:21:59] that by God's grace that God had made
[1:22:02] you a promise the Bible says if you
[1:22:06] believe that Jesus Christ is Lord and
[1:22:09] you confess that with your mouth and
[1:22:11] believe within your heart
[1:22:13] that he is our Lord and our Savior even
[1:22:16] our prophet the word said first of all
[1:22:19] you have passed from death unto life you
[1:22:25] said that can't be right well let me
[1:22:28] take you back to the thief on the cross
[1:22:30] people don't want to work with that cuz
[1:22:33] he did no works but what what what did
[1:22:36] he do to deserve Jesus sometimes what he
[1:22:41] reckoned no no no what made him
[1:22:44] recognize Jesus was an innocent lamb it
[1:22:48] was God's grace that opened his eyes
[1:22:50] and not one of us has a right to say who
[1:22:54] will be there and who won't be there
[1:22:56] you better just trust and hope you there
[1:23:01] huh that's all this about just pray that
[1:23:05] God gets you there cuz if you get there
[1:23:07] it's gonna be by His grace huh he could
[1:23:12] be by what you think you know that Paul
[1:23:14] said you can understand all mystery and
[1:23:16] still not have charity because you know
[1:23:18] what the Bible said that God would that
[1:23:20] none would perish if that's in your
[1:23:23] heart you got love hmm all men they
[1:23:27] don't come to repentance but he said he
[1:23:29] would his is his will that none would
[1:23:31] perish and you and I must understand by
[1:23:35] the grace of God if you can understand
[1:23:37] in grace you'll have lots of more love
[1:23:43] huh because you realize about yourself
[1:23:48] that you ain't so good after all without
[1:23:52] the grace of God all of us are who we
[1:23:55] are by the grace of God in it beautiful
[1:23:59] to know that the capstone the
[1:24:01] cornerstone where we saw the cow all
[1:24:03] right he was rejected we received him
[1:24:06] because he received him he receives us
[1:24:08] and then he in his last days comes and
[1:24:12] he confirms that Abraham covenant with
[1:24:14] you and makes you understand it's
[1:24:17] unconditional don't make it conditional
[1:24:20] he's unconditional and Abraham did not
[1:24:25] seek out to do evil
[1:24:27] made a lot of mistakes and God covered
[1:24:30] for me anyway
[1:24:31] so in spite of our mistakes we still
[1:24:35] have the grace of God working on our
[1:24:37] behalf you love the Lord one more
[1:24:41] thought let's tan remember that man that
[1:24:44] got drunk that preaches that ain't
[1:24:46] preaching on mo I'm not gonna follow
[1:24:48] Christ no more and he end up dying and
[1:24:52] brother branham said he was saved why
[1:24:55] because of the grace of God you think
[1:24:59] about Harry right brother man say what
[1:25:03] do you want she said the souls of my two
[1:25:05] sons those boys are out there in the
[1:25:07] world somewhere if they still livin last
[1:25:09] I heard they were but God gave them
[1:25:12] something that was eternal and no matter
[1:25:14] what people may look at says how can
[1:25:16] that be God always keeps his promises
[1:25:21] and whether man look at him said where
[1:25:23] he don't deserve to be there look what
[1:25:25] he did afterwards it ain't your business
[1:25:27] it's God's business that's one thing I
[1:25:31] love about grace is sovereignty God
[1:25:34] don't have to ask anybody's permission
[1:25:36] he is the only potentate he chooses who
[1:25:41] he wants to he saves we wants to he
[1:25:45] makes a vessel Avani makes a vessel of
[1:25:47] dishonor hallelujah and nobody gonna
[1:25:50] argue him argue with him is that right
[1:25:53] who should counsel the Lord anybody here
[1:25:57] wise enough to do it
[1:26:00] I just said by God's grace I'm so glad
[1:26:07] I'm so glad
[1:26:08] yes I'm so glad to be one of them and I
[1:26:14] can tell you one thing when God I don't
[1:26:18] heard the message of grace many times
[1:26:20] but this is the first time it really did
[1:26:23] something for me it was so time it came
[1:26:27] at a time when I needed it the most
[1:26:29] we're at a time where translation must
[1:26:32] come and until you see the grace of God
[1:26:36] how you gonna make it because you'll
[1:26:40] find yourself not worthy
[1:26:44] hello Bob said the zoo rubles started it
[1:26:47] in his room we're gonna finish it not by
[1:26:52] power not by might but by my spirit o
[1:26:55] God have mercy I can't even explain how
[1:26:58] I feel all day it's been like a
[1:27:00] whirlwind of joy of something going on
[1:27:02] the inside you know what and I I just
[1:27:06] know I'm a notch higher the way I feel
[1:27:11] that's the way I feel I know it's true
[1:27:15] in the present

[1:28:51] [Music]
[1:28:58] let me let me say this because I'm
[1:29:01] hearing thoughts when grace finds you it
[1:29:08] doesn't put you in a place where you
[1:29:09] just lay down and say God do it grace
[1:29:15] makes you work you work because of grace
[1:29:20] you pray because of grace you fast
[1:29:23] because of grace you read your Bible
[1:29:25] because of grace grace will always ask
[1:29:30] for more grace Lord add to me give me
[1:29:39] the grace and add to me virtue knowledge
[1:29:43] temperance whatever you need give me
[1:29:45] grace Lord you say why cuz no man can
[1:29:50] add one cubit to his stature it takes
[1:29:54] the grace of God so I don't want you to
[1:29:57] think that I would just preaching on
[1:29:58] grace like you know you don't have to do
[1:30:00] nothing no you have to do something if
[1:30:03] you really have faith in God you will do
[1:30:05] something but don't think because you're
[1:30:08] doing something is what causes God to do
[1:30:11] what he's doing no God causing you to do
[1:30:14] something so he can do something if that
[1:30:19] makes sense
