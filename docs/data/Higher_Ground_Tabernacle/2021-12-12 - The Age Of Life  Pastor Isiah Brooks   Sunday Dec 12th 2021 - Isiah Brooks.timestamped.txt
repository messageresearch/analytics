[51:35] he's truly worthy to be praised
[51:39] glad to see isaiah i thought he
[51:41] takes me otherwise but
[51:43] anyway god moves
[51:45] god is good to us
[51:47] you may be seated for just a moment
[51:51] we really thank god for
[51:54] everybody this morning
[51:58] and we appreciate the true
[52:01] uh saints of god
[52:04] [Music]
[52:11] [Music]
[52:16] and they were sharing their concerns
[52:18] [Music]
[52:22] many of you were
[52:24] offended
[52:26] [Music]
[52:27] or shocked
[52:30] the last time i spoke
[52:33] there were a lot of things happening
[52:35] during that time
[52:38] and to be honest with you i was
[52:42] at times angry
[52:47] and and the reason being i was
[52:50] under the influence that
[52:53] many of you have been gossiping about a
[52:55] situation that had occurred
[53:09] but they had a breach in their
[53:11] uh marriage contract
[53:16] and i was told that the sisters felt
[53:22] like i should have expounded on it more
[53:24] so
[53:25] [Music]
[53:36] not trying to hurt anybody's feelings or
[53:39] misplace the word in any way
[53:46] but i believe the man uh the husband of
[53:48] this white woman
[53:50] uh chose to forgive her
[53:52] for uh
[53:59] but i do want to say by the grace of god
[54:03] the spirit of fornication
[54:06] and the spirit of adultery is not
[54:08] something that we must do and this all
[54:10] even should do it
[54:13] it is evil in the eyes of god
[54:17] but it's not something that you cannot
[54:19] be forgiven
[54:22] for
[54:24] [Music]
[54:36] [Music]
[54:50] and put ourselves in that position of
[54:52] the of the fallen brother or sister
[54:53] [Music]
[54:56] and we should treat each other in the
[54:58] way that we would want to be treated
[55:04] this is the capstone ministry
[55:07] and this is a ministry of love
[55:09] [Music]
[55:10] now i like to say by god's grace to
[55:12] reiterate
[55:16] that
[55:17] fornication
[55:46] don't let the spirit get on you release
[55:49] please where you think that that's all
[55:51] right
[55:53] and that you know this church is saying
[55:55] okay
[55:56] you know if you do it you'll be forgiven
[55:58] specifically
[55:59] okay
[56:10] [Music]
[56:15] so uh i i just want to say that without
[56:18] saying names because everybody knows who
[56:20] i'm speaking of
[56:23] and those of you those of you who don't
[56:26] know
[56:28] you don't need
[56:32] [Music]
[56:42] comparing you
[56:45] to the church that i once had in
[56:48] ohio uh
[56:51] my my doing that was not to offend you
[57:05] so that you could
[57:07] know that there's a higher level of
[57:09] worship
[57:19] [Music]
[57:24] whatever country he would go in
[57:27] whether it was africa
[57:29] whether it was india
[57:31] whether it's america
[57:33] he said those who get filled with the
[57:34] holy ghost
[57:36] they act the same way
[57:42] and so i am trying to bring the church
[57:45] to a higher level
[57:47] some of you don't have the holy ghost
[57:50] and i do not want the satan to deceive
[57:53] you
[57:54] making you believe that you got it
[57:58] when you don't
[58:00] so i'm going to say things over this
[58:01] poor people
[58:03] to make you question
[58:06] or to make you examine whether you have
[58:08] it or not
[58:10] is that right
[58:11] i'm not doing anything less than paul
[58:13] did
[58:14] paul said examine yourself to see
[58:16] whether you'll be in the faith
[58:19] this is a late hour
[58:34] so i wanted to say those things
[58:37] and i know we've been
[58:39] speaking working on getting us here on
[58:41] time
[58:42] [Music]
[58:46] i couldn't help but to smile
[59:03] component when i speak
[59:05] to your founder i am intentionally
[59:09] trying to better you just say
[59:12] and better myself dude
[59:15] sometimes we make decisions
[59:17] [Music]
[59:55] to make that child a better character
[1:00:08] my last thing that i think i could
[1:00:09] remember i didn't write them down but i
[1:00:11] should initials
[1:00:39] even paul when you heard about what was
[1:00:41] happening in the corinthians church
[1:00:43] members
[1:00:45] paul said i heard
[1:00:47] that some were walking disorderly
[1:00:51] and he said i believe
[1:00:54] so paul wasn't there to witness it
[1:00:57] but he heard about it
[1:00:58] and he believed
[1:01:01] hallelujah
[1:01:02] now my thing is
[1:01:05] i told the brothers yesterday
[1:01:08] i will no longer look at you as
[1:01:10] congolese
[1:01:13] from now on you're christians
[1:01:15] from now on your brothers
[1:01:18] right
[1:01:19] from now on your sisters
[1:01:22] and i will try my
[1:01:49] that i wish i did not know
[1:01:52] but i will never judge you again
[1:01:55] based on experiences
[1:01:58] that i've had with others
[1:02:01] am i making myself clear
[1:02:03] so my thing is it's what i'm trying to
[1:02:06] say
[1:02:08] even when it came to the situation with
[1:02:10] the brothers and his wife
[1:02:13] when it comes to
[1:02:15] uh
[1:02:17] things that
[1:02:18] i have said and done
[1:02:21] i found myself guilty
[1:02:24] of gossiping just like you do
[1:02:28] and i'm not trying to justify myself
[1:02:31] i'm saying i hate it
[1:02:33] but i also find out that it's so easy to
[1:02:35] get into that
[1:02:41] and sometimes we we we started off
[1:02:46] but it's not right
[1:02:48] so i'ma ask that you pray for me
[1:02:52] like i i i will pray for you
[1:02:56] another incident that did happen our
[1:02:58] brother wasn't there but he'll know who
[1:02:59] i'm speaking today
[1:03:02] i was at his house
[1:03:05] some time ago
[1:03:07] and uh i made the uh
[1:03:10] uh
[1:03:11] i concluded in my mind oh my defeat
[1:03:16] that they were
[1:03:17] talking uh about me
[1:03:21] or saying things they should not be
[1:03:23] should not have been saying
[1:03:26] because they were speaking in french
[1:03:42] and
[1:03:52] that's all you can do is speak french
[1:03:54] you have no choice
[1:04:01] [Music]
[1:04:24] you don't know me
[1:04:27] [Music]
[1:04:38] so i want to say to the brother that i
[1:04:39] thought was talking about me
[1:04:42] and forgive me for voicing that
[1:04:45] to other people
[1:04:47] without insulting you
[1:04:51] you understand me
[1:05:16] you understand me
[1:05:17] because i thought in myself
[1:05:20] that was something that a brother could
[1:05:22] not tell another brother
[1:05:26] you understand what i'm saying i thought
[1:05:27] congolese brothers don't tell each other
[1:05:29] i love you
[1:05:32] now i'm just letting you know my mind
[1:05:34] i'm letting you think you know me
[1:05:36] and that was that was amazing to me
[1:05:41] because i'm the one that says i love you
[1:05:43] all the time
[1:05:45] but then i make people so nervous when i
[1:05:47] do that
[1:05:50] you know what i'm saying
[1:05:52] i know the kind of age we're living in
[1:05:55] but i just want you to know i got my
[1:05:56] wife
[1:05:57] [Laughter]
[1:06:01] right
[1:06:02] so we love each other
[1:06:04] and and honestly i i don't have and and
[1:06:07] i was thinking about this last night
[1:06:09] then i'm gonna get right right into the
[1:06:10] word
[1:06:12] i was thinking about this last night
[1:06:15] because there are a group of young
[1:06:17] brothers that i normally just take on
[1:06:20] them i took under my wings
[1:06:25] [Music]
[1:06:27] i love young people
[1:06:29] and i i see the need of fellowship
[1:06:59] but i want to say that you all are
[1:07:00] welcome
[1:07:03] just call me before you come i believe
[1:07:07] all right you all are welcome

[1:14:08] a bride
[1:14:10] a church
[1:14:12] a powerhouse
[1:14:15] not a system
[1:14:16] system not just church goers
[1:14:20] that have been changed
[1:14:22] by the quickening power
[1:14:25] of the holy ghost
[1:14:39] not only just in myself
[1:14:42] but in others
[1:14:45] romans 8 11 or manchester united
[1:14:49] but if the spirit of him

[1:14:56] in you
[1:14:58] he that raised up christ from the dead
[1:15:02] shall also quicken your mortal bodies
[1:15:06] by his spirit that dwelleth in
[1:15:22] is
[1:15:30] read there the 17 through the 18th verse
[1:15:33] of the first chapter of revelations just
[1:15:35] gonna say did you
[1:15:41] and when i saw him
[1:15:43] i failed at his feet as dead
[1:15:47] and he laid his right hand upon me
[1:15:49] saying unto me fear not
[1:15:53] i am the first
[1:15:55] and the last
[1:16:00] village
[1:16:04] of
[1:16:07] i am he that liveth
[1:16:09] and was dead
[1:16:11] and behold i am alive forevermore amen
[1:16:15] and have the keys of hell
[1:16:18] and of death
[1:16:46] we thank you for everything that you've
[1:16:48] done for us
[1:16:52] lord if we could just grasp
[1:16:55] within our hearts
[1:16:56] all that you have done for us
[1:16:59] and move toward it
[1:17:01] it would make us a better christian
[1:17:04] god i pray by your loving arms
[1:17:08] in your loving heart
[1:17:10] that you revealed all of this word
[1:17:14] to
[1:17:22] [Music]
[1:17:28] in your lovely name jesus christ we pray
[1:17:32] amen amen
[1:17:34] you may be seated
[1:17:36] you know it's
[1:17:38] people think christianity is a wimp
[1:17:40] religion
[1:17:42] jean-paul scott
[1:17:54] a real woman to be a
[1:17:56] christian christians can do things that
[1:17:59] sinners cannot do the criticism
[1:18:02] and one of the things that christians
[1:18:04] can do
[1:18:06] that most of us can't do
[1:18:09] and that is to humble themselves
[1:18:13] one of the things that i love about
[1:18:14] brother brad
[1:18:17] was his humility
[1:18:19] humility and brother branham wasn't so
[1:18:22] great of a man
[1:18:35] and when a real man when a man can just
[1:18:37] humble himself beyond under the word
[1:18:41] that's what makes him the man
[1:18:44] when you can be obedient sisters
[1:18:47] to the word of god
[1:18:49] that's what makes you a real woman
[1:19:05] there are those who have named that they
[1:19:07] have a life or live
[1:19:11] and the bible says they're dead
[1:19:14] and personally i don't want to be that
[1:19:16] kind of a christian
[1:19:18] that have a name
[1:19:20] that
[1:19:31] millions of them that says that god is
[1:19:33] with them
[1:19:37] millions or many of them
[1:19:39] don't say that they know the lord
[1:19:43] millions and many of them said they read
[1:19:45] the bible
[1:19:48] and perhaps some of them read their
[1:19:49] bibles more than we do
[1:19:53] millions and many of them goes to church
[1:19:57] millions and many of them give their
[1:19:59] offerings entitled
[1:20:01] to payload
[1:20:16] you either for god because it's what or
[1:20:19] you are against god
[1:20:22] hallelujah y'all understand me
[1:20:25] now we look at this thing
[1:20:28] and you and i must understand
[1:20:31] that when it comes to
[1:20:33] jesus christ
[1:20:36] we must
[1:20:37] know that we must be crucified with him
[1:20:42] he he doesn't bear the cross alone in
[1:20:44] the book anymore
[1:20:46] because jesus told his disciples
[1:20:49] take up your cross
[1:20:51] and follow me
[1:20:53] a cross is nothing uh easy to bear like
[1:20:57] what you chose
[1:20:58] it is difficult
[1:21:00] it was difficult for our lord
[1:21:04] but he bore the cross
[1:21:06] and he despised the shame
[1:21:09] um
[1:21:11] for you and i
[1:21:22] i am crucified with christ jesus
[1:21:25] nevertheless i live
[1:21:29] yet not i
[1:21:32] but christ
[1:21:33] liveth in me
[1:21:36] and the life
[1:21:38] which i now live
[1:21:40] in
[1:21:51] and gave himself for me
[1:22:20] sometimes a lonely life
[1:22:29] [Music]
[1:22:33] but i wonder how many of us
[1:23:02] i live by the faith of the son of god
[1:23:09] hallelujah amen so you can understand
[1:23:11] the scripture
[1:23:13] it's not like i'm living
[1:23:15] by the faith this is a thing
[1:23:32] by
[1:23:43] it makes the life
[1:23:44] that we live as christians
[1:23:59] perhaps of the more than a conqueror was
[1:24:01] it the
[1:24:02] more than a country
[1:24:05] and we find out that uh
[1:24:09] this man would work a job
[1:24:13] working all week
[1:24:42] we're more than a conqueror
[1:24:44] you can't save yourself
[1:24:46] you can't work to save yourself
[1:24:49] there's nothing you can do to save
[1:24:51] yourself
[1:24:52] he conquered death hell and the grace
[1:24:56] it makes you more than a conqueror
[1:25:00] because you're now receiving the
[1:25:02] benefits
[1:25:04] which is the paycheck
[1:25:07] is that right
[1:25:08] and brother branham said
[1:25:10] whatever that
[1:25:23] now we look at these things
[1:25:27] and you say what brother books
[1:25:30] why would you say i don't have the holy
[1:25:32] ghost
[1:25:34] i don't know who you are
[1:25:37] but i do believe that there are some of
[1:25:39] us who don't have it
[1:25:42] yes
[1:25:42] and i believe with all of my heart
[1:25:46] there is a way out yet there's a way out
[1:25:49] of all of us
[1:25:50] hallelujah and the only way that you're
[1:25:53] going to get out
[1:25:55] of where you are in this religious realm
[1:25:59] is that you must leave the needless
[1:26:02] things behind the village
[1:26:05] and you must choose
[1:26:08] the needful things is the shows there's
[1:26:11] only thing only only one thing we need
[1:26:14] yeah
[1:26:16] and that is christ
[1:26:18] everything else is needless to choose
[1:26:22] i don't need a house to get to heaven
[1:26:25] i don't need a car to get there
[1:26:28] i don't need a buddy or best friend to
[1:26:30] get to heaven
[1:26:32] i don't need nothing of this world
[1:26:34] to
[1:26:44] and you said that's not important it is
[1:26:47] because if you're not careful
[1:26:49] you can be entangled again
[1:26:52] you could be like miss lot with me
[1:26:55] brother brown said she had loved ones
[1:26:58] was thinking about don't touch and she
[1:27:00] all of a sudden turned
[1:27:16] because
[1:27:20] hello so i'm bringing it down to you as
[1:27:22] an individual this morning
[1:27:25] hallelujah there's only one life brother
[1:27:28] i'm saying
[1:27:29] found in the easter
[1:27:31] there's only one life
[1:27:33] one eternal spirit
[1:27:37] one eternal life
[1:27:39] and that's god this is a jew
[1:27:41] god alone jesus is the eternal
[1:27:51] [Music]
[1:28:12] examine yourself
[1:28:14] don't look at your neighbor
[1:28:16] what might be wrong with them
[1:28:18] but examine yourself
[1:28:21] hallelujah
[1:28:23] and then he said god he says and the
[1:28:25] thoughts is expressed
[1:28:27] and become a word
[1:28:30] then each individual
[1:28:32] in here
[1:28:33] that possesses
[1:28:35] the eternal this eternal life people say
[1:28:37] what he said
[1:28:38] each individual
[1:28:40] that possesses
[1:28:42] this eternal life
[1:28:44] was before the foundation of the world
[1:28:47] in god's thinking
[1:28:49] did you hear what i said
[1:28:51] i didn't say each individual
[1:28:54] believe the message
[1:29:09] of the world of the aforementioned in
[1:29:11] god's thinking
[1:29:13] and we have preachers preaching the
[1:29:15] people
[1:29:16] very quote
[1:29:18] and they don't even know
[1:29:20] the people don't even know
[1:29:22] you've got to be born again
[1:29:24] for this to apply to you
[1:29:29] not just a church member pastor might
[1:29:31] remember jesus you've got to have
[1:29:32] crossed that journey
[1:29:36] hallelujah and a word
[1:29:40] excuse me
[1:29:42] right
[1:29:43] and a word has taken life
[1:30:04] be
[1:30:06] i'm gotta mix that but one of one of the
[1:30:09] things i'm not what i used to be don't
[1:30:10] know what i'm trying to say
[1:30:13] but he said you traveled from somewhere
[1:30:17] and i believe a lot of us have traveled
[1:30:23] and some of us are struggling with
[1:30:24] sanctification
[1:30:25] when some of us have actually conquered
[1:30:27] sanctification but you can't get filled
[1:30:30] fully with the holy spirit until you
[1:30:33] conquered sanctification
[1:30:36] hallelujah and then god will come down
[1:30:38] and fill you with the holy ghost
[1:30:41] are you listening to what i'm saying
[1:30:43] i'm talking about rapturing material
[1:30:46] i'm talking
[1:31:15] in a lava mixture hallelujah
[1:31:18] why
[1:31:19] because he come to put a new nature in
[1:31:21] us
[1:31:23] his nature
[1:31:25] hallelujah
[1:31:27] is that all right
[1:31:28] a word has taken life
[1:31:31] and it's eternal
[1:31:33] that's the reason we have eternal life
[1:31:36] in the same principle
[1:31:39] that the great son of god
[1:31:41] the redeemer we've come to
[1:31:56] in the same message you don't remember
[1:31:58] search brother who says this
[1:32:00] satan doesn't care so i don't know how
[1:32:03] religious you are
[1:32:05] how right you are in your doctrine
[1:32:08] you miss that lie
[1:32:24] it doesn't matter one thing unless you
[1:32:27] have
[1:32:28] been born again
[1:32:33] this is where we need to set focus
[1:32:38] you understand me we don't have to have
[1:32:40] all of the shouting and dancing
[1:32:43] but one thing we need if we're going to
[1:32:46] be a powerhouse if we if if
[1:32:49] god amen is going to do something in
[1:32:51] this church
[1:32:52] if there is ever a unity that will be
[1:32:56] formed in this church it will be done by
[1:32:58] the holy ghost
[1:33:01] only by the holy ghost sir
[1:33:03] because you fellowship together doesn't
[1:33:05] mean that you are not united
[1:33:08] but we want the union amen the united to
[1:33:11] come together by the holy ghost
[1:33:15] hallelujah

[1:33:24] in question and answers

[1:35:39] and he asked that boss man forgive me
[1:35:53] and there was a man who owed him yeah
[1:35:56] and instead of forgiving giving his

[1:36:02] and had him thrown in jail
[1:36:05] well the news
[1:36:08] of what this man did to his servant
[1:36:11] got back to the big balls

[1:36:20] forgiven himself

[1:39:41] and the power of satan
[1:39:43] is many times harder

[1:42:16] hallelujah let me move on see
[1:42:19] it would deceive the very elected so
[1:42:21] that's the truth if it were possible
[1:42:24] so close
[1:42:25] the people so live
[1:42:28] people can live clean
[1:42:30] holy life
[1:42:32] not be sinful
[1:42:36] and drinkers
[1:42:38] and liars and gamblers
[1:42:54] we all must be born again
[1:42:56] we all must have the holy ghost
[1:42:58] we all must grow into the statue of a
[1:43:00] perfect man
[1:43:02] that's the word
[1:43:03] wouldn't it be a sad situation
[1:43:07] if we fall into this category
[1:43:12] i just heard brother say it
[1:43:15] in the rising of the sun
[1:43:17] he said his mom was a peculiar person
[1:43:22] and she had five dreams all of her life
[1:43:27] but he said every one of those dreams
[1:43:29] were
[1:43:30] correct
[1:43:33] and he said his mom dreamed
[1:43:36] a dream that he was going up three
[1:43:38] stairs two three stairs
[1:43:42] and at the top of that step third step
[1:43:46] was a a pearl a pearl a pearl that
[1:43:49] literally became a floor
[1:44:04] but she
[1:44:15] but because she didn't listen
[1:44:18] she found it she traveled that road
[1:44:21] the road got narrower
[1:44:23] and narrower
[1:44:25] and narrower
[1:44:26] and all of a sudden
[1:44:28] she found herself
[1:44:30] falling into hell
[1:44:37] [Applause]
[1:44:47] he said you can be saint uh uh uh
[1:44:50] baptized you've been but then you can
[1:44:53] have the holy ghost
[1:44:54] and still go to hell
[1:45:01] y'all think it yeah yeah you you don't
[1:45:03] see see what it is you look at us and we
[1:45:06] try to tell you
[1:45:08] and then you do it anyway
[1:45:10] but you failed to see the all she and i
[1:45:12] is watching
[1:45:13] it ain't about me
[1:45:26] i never understood that kind of stuff in
[1:45:27] my
[1:45:28] life my sisters used to wear those
[1:45:31] high-hair shoes and myself as soon as
[1:45:33] they got in the house
[1:45:36] trying to take a mouse because they hurt
[1:45:37] their feet
[1:45:39] yeah it's going to hurt your foot all
[1:45:41] crunched up in there
[1:45:42] like that
[1:45:51] yeah i see some of y'all sisters come in
[1:45:53] here and y'all sit down and put them
[1:45:54] shoes on the other side
[1:46:10] i'm just
[1:46:24] ain't nobody looking at your feet like
[1:46:26] that yeah
[1:46:32] hallelujah let's move on it's okay
[1:46:35] i'm gonna preach it anyway
[1:46:38] see this is the age of life
[1:46:40] personal life of christ
[1:46:43] where christ
[1:46:44] the chemical
[1:46:46] is the chemical of his body
[1:46:49] you know i i got excited
[1:46:52] and i i just want to preach it because i
[1:46:53] know i'm doing all these quotes but you
[1:46:55] can read or you can study uh uh it is
[1:46:58] the rising of the sun
[1:47:00] but brother branham says that not only
[1:47:02] does god wants to anoint your insides
[1:47:05] but he wants to anoint your
[1:47:20] spirit that love spirit
[1:47:23] has anointed
[1:47:25] that individual
[1:47:28] and i think about that once it turns out
[1:47:30] for the anointing of allah allah can
[1:47:32] announce your spirit
[1:47:34] where other people
[1:47:48] would come into a room
[1:47:50] he brought the atmosphere
[1:47:53] hallelujah and they could feel the
[1:47:55] presence of the lord so much
[1:47:58] everybody was watching the thoughts that
[1:48:00] they were making
[1:48:02] hallelujah
[1:48:06] that is also for the bride of jesus
[1:48:08] christ it was oh you don't believe that
[1:48:11] but i'm going to bring it to you in just
[1:48:13] a minute now i know i got to read
[1:48:16] amen move on first under justification
[1:48:21] the water baptism second
[1:48:23] and under the new birth of wesley
[1:48:25] sanctification
[1:48:28] which cleanses
[1:48:30] and thirdly under the baptism of the
[1:48:31] holy ghost the holy spirit
[1:48:34] is putting that sanctified vessel into
[1:48:36] service that's what you've seen
[1:48:38] the word sanctified means
[1:48:40] it's a compound greek word
[1:48:43] which means
[1:48:44] [Music]
[1:48:58] and we'll notice
[1:49:00] when the unclean spirit is gone from a
[1:49:03] man
[1:49:05] that's what has happened
[1:49:07] many of us we came to the message
[1:49:09] we were excited about it
[1:49:11] we come through the justification
[1:49:13] we come to the sanctification and that's
[1:49:16] where some have been deceived
[1:49:18] hallelujah
[1:49:20] yes because you feel good
[1:49:23] how do you you live in a moral life
[1:49:26] but it doesn't stop
[1:49:54] you know you're ready
[1:49:56] now let's move on i want something
[1:49:58] he says that's exactly what the church
[1:50:00] has done
[1:50:02] baptism
[1:50:03] methodist
[1:50:04] those who believe in sanctification
[1:50:07] jesus said like the unclean spirit
[1:50:10] that went out jesus returns back to this
[1:50:13] church body
[1:50:15] and find the house garnish and swept
[1:50:17] clean
[1:50:19] living pure
[1:50:21] clean
[1:50:23] right
[1:50:24] but then if that house
[1:50:27] isn't field occupied
[1:50:30] then he comes in with seven other evil
[1:50:33] demons
[1:50:34] worse than he was
[1:50:37] and the last stage of this place
[1:50:40] is seven times worse than it does it was
[1:50:43] at the first place
[1:50:46] they've had been
[1:50:47] better to stay lutheran
[1:50:50] than it would
[1:50:51] [Music]
[1:51:04] us
[1:51:06] because if we're not if we don't
[1:51:08] understand
[1:51:09] or we come to a place
[1:51:12] that we have been saying it's got to be
[1:51:14] changed
[1:51:15] and what i'm saying is the dynamics and
[1:51:17] the mechanics must
[1:51:31] a christian must have power
[1:51:35] however you want to put it but there
[1:51:37] must be an anointing
[1:51:39] there must be an anointing
[1:51:41] god's anointing not just within but also
[1:51:45] without
[1:51:46] is that right it goes with the scripture
[1:51:49] that god has built a wall of fire about
[1:51:52] us
[1:51:53] what is that wall of fire but god
[1:51:55] himself
[1:51:57] hallelujah we're not supposed to be in a
[1:51:59] place where we're barely making it
[1:52:02] through this age hallelujah
[1:52:05] because we are more than conquerors
[1:52:08] we're more than conquerors
[1:52:10] more than conquerors
[1:52:12] but you got to take a hold of your
[1:52:14] benefits
[1:52:16] hallelujah
[1:52:17] oh come on somebody it's just as simple
[1:52:19] as this it's a sampler if you had a rich
[1:52:22] daddy
[1:52:24] and the rich daddy has placed you in his
[1:52:26] will
[1:52:28] and the rich daddy dies
[1:52:31] no but in his policy may see he left
[1:52:34] everything to you yeah
[1:52:39] a mansion
[1:52:41] fancy cars
[1:52:43] beautiful swimming pool
[1:52:45] whatever
[1:52:46] lots of land
[1:52:48] lots of cattle
[1:52:49] lots of everything
[1:52:52] hallelujah
[1:52:53] how many of you
[1:52:56] how many of you seeing what god has done
[1:53:00] your daddy did for you
[1:53:03] after getting over the grief
[1:53:06] after getting over the grief
[1:53:10] you're going to try
[1:53:15] [Music]
[1:53:17] you're going to enjoy what he left you
[1:53:20] you know what happened
[1:53:21] you're going to love daddy even better
[1:53:51] yes you can
[1:54:03] is that right
[1:54:04] the bible said cast all your cares upon
[1:54:07] him because he cares for you
[1:54:11] all of them not some of them but all of
[1:54:14] them
[1:54:17] remember i said the other night
[1:54:20] at what point in time i don't
[1:54:22] want to talk about
[1:54:24] when
[1:54:25] will we meet the prince of peace
[1:54:28] [Music]
[1:54:30] were you going to meet him in the air no
[1:54:32] no you got to meet him here first
[1:54:46] no matter what you're going through
[1:54:47] grandpa the problem
[1:55:02] you love the lord
[1:55:04] i mean look at psalms 103 you don't have
[1:55:06] to turn there
[1:55:07] some song but but psalms 103 tells you
[1:55:10] about all the benefits some sort
[1:55:12] he's your heel
[1:55:14] he's your deliverer
[1:55:16] he's your savior bless the lord oh my
[1:55:19] soul
[1:55:19] and all that is within me
[1:55:22] bless his holy name
[1:55:24] and forget it
[1:55:27] and forget not
[1:55:28] all of his
[1:55:30] benefits hallelujah that's what the
[1:55:33] policy gives you
[1:55:36] hallelujah not only did he die
[1:55:38] but he was raised again
[1:55:40] and the greatest part of the benefit
[1:55:43] is that he's willing to give himself
[1:55:46] to you
[1:55:47] he's willing to come live in you
[1:55:51] hallelujah he's willing to work for you
[1:55:54] walk for you
[1:55:56] talk for you
[1:55:57] live for you
[1:55:59] that's what paul said i can't do it the
[1:56:02] good that i would i don't do it
[1:56:04] that kind of thing i don't want to do i
[1:56:07] find myself doing it
[1:56:08] but then paul had another testimony
[1:56:11] hallelujah he said it's not that i live
[1:56:15] i'm living now
[1:56:16] but it's not that i live it's christ
[1:56:18] that lives in me
[1:56:20] hallelujah and you and i must understand
[1:56:23] that god has given us a victory in these
[1:56:26] things
[1:56:55] i was tired
[1:56:57] uh other things were happening in my
[1:56:58] life
[1:57:00] and it was really bad i i just felt like
[1:57:02] just laying around the house something
[1:57:04] comes to you
[1:57:07] but then god quickened me i'll
[1:57:12] he quickened me
[1:57:14] in this message
[1:57:16] and i said i'll never let that happen to
[1:57:18] me again
[1:57:22] not as long
[1:57:46] god has no other choice but to hear what
[1:57:48] you've got to say jewish
[1:57:58] [Applause]
[1:58:02] when the devil brings all this crazy
[1:58:03] stuff into your
[1:58:04] life and you begin to sing praises to
[1:58:07] god
[1:58:08] hallelujah so glad i'm here
[1:58:12] i'm so glad i'm here
[1:58:14] i'm so glad i'm here in jesus name
[1:58:17] [Applause]
[1:58:18] the word brought me here oh the devil
[1:58:20] can't stand that
[1:58:22] he want to see you crying and worrying
[1:58:26] because he knows when you go through all
[1:58:28] those changes
[1:58:29] he's gotten you away from the words
[1:58:32] hallelujah
[1:58:42] [Music]
[1:58:45] and i've learned how to be exalted
[1:58:47] hallelujah
[1:58:48] but he's going to give glory to god and
[1:58:51] no matter what he goes through
[1:58:53] hallelujah that's where god wants us
[1:58:55] this is good that's the kind of life
[1:58:58] hallelujah
[1:59:00] i don't think i'll say it like this
[1:59:04] i can't preach all of this in my message
[1:59:07] but i want to try to get to something
[1:59:08] here
[1:59:16] when it comes to
[1:59:21] this life
[1:59:24] you don't necessarily need to know it
[1:59:26] but
[1:59:28] i i left all my family
[1:59:31] for me or let's put it this way my
[1:59:33] family disowned me
[1:59:36] for this message
[1:59:40] and and and they really thought i was
[1:59:42] crazy
[1:59:44] following a man like brother branham
[1:59:47] even to this day
[1:59:50] nobody calls me
[1:59:52] and if i want to hear from them i have
[1:59:54] to call them
[1:59:56] you
[2:00:10] and when god separated me
[2:00:12] i have never had a desire to go back
[2:00:16] the only family i have that's what is my
[2:00:19] immediate family
[2:00:21] and the family of god for me
[2:00:25] and and i want you to understand what
[2:00:26] i'm saying
[2:00:28] because almost all of us in this is in
[2:00:30] that same boat
[2:00:32] especially being in this message
[2:00:36] hallelujah
[2:00:37] now
[2:00:39] are we going to be
[2:00:42] are we going to be uh
[2:00:44] one of those ones that look back to what
[2:00:46] we used to be that's
[2:00:47] a problem
[2:00:50] let me see let me say this let me hurry
[2:00:52] up because i've taken a lot of time
[2:00:53] sometimes
[2:00:54] away from you and i don't want to i
[2:00:57] don't want to i don't want the impact of
[2:00:58] the message to get away from you
[2:01:04] what is the power of the holy ghost and
[2:01:05] we talk about
[2:02:12] as beneficiaries we ought to prove his
[2:02:15] life in us
[2:02:29] but we know that jesus didn't just die
[2:02:31] he rose again
[2:02:33] hallelujah and the light
[2:02:36] there's never was a life lived
[2:02:39] like it
[2:02:40] before
[2:02:42] he was the son of god
[2:02:44] and he
[2:02:55] [Music]
[2:02:58] a commissioned
[2:03:12] and how can we do it
[2:03:14] by word only
[2:03:17] see that's it not by word only
[2:03:20] you know everybody has this little thing
[2:03:22] you know us we're in the message and you
[2:03:24] know we've got deep revelations that's
[2:03:26] all i've
[2:03:35] i can see some of y'all not it's just
[2:03:37] whatever it is it is what it is
[2:03:40] but i'm telling you the truth
[2:03:42] you know i'm so glad you're all paying
[2:03:44] me attention and all that good stuff
[2:03:46] this is awkward and you know i look at
[2:03:47] things and i wonder what's happening
[2:03:49] with the people
[2:03:50] because when the world when it does come
[2:03:54] you know we we find ourselves looking
[2:03:56] everywhere and you can't do that i don't
[2:03:59] believe you i really don't believe
[2:04:00] you're multitasking
[2:04:06] if anybody should be tired as those ones
[2:04:07] who just got out from work yes
[2:04:10] but so we understand
[2:04:13] but my point is
[2:04:14] when you come into the word
[2:04:16] into the house of god
[2:04:18] i'm preaching a message
[2:04:19] and i think
[2:04:20] i think i don't know but i hope
[2:04:33] because i'm not preaching my thoughts
[2:04:34] because i'm preaching his thoughts
[2:04:38] hallelujah
[2:04:40] so we we we're looking at this thing
[2:04:44] and it goes on to say
[2:04:46] and how can we do it
[2:04:48] it's by the word only
[2:05:03] of the holy spirit
[2:05:30] dynamics and the mechanics has come
[2:05:32] together and that same power that raised
[2:05:36] him from the dead
[2:05:37] he said if you believe it it will
[2:05:39] quicken your mortal body
[2:05:41] it will bring you to a place where you
[2:05:44] become as a prophet said an invincible
[2:05:46] lion
[2:06:00] thirsty for the power of god to live
[2:06:02] soft
[2:06:04] of evil you know i'm not saying that
[2:06:06] because you have the power of god going
[2:06:07] to have you raised in the dead
[2:06:10] but one thing for certain i know the
[2:06:11] bible said these signs shall follow them
[2:06:14] that believe me
[2:06:27] now the very essence of the message
[2:06:31] that was sent
[2:06:33] that he is risen
[2:06:36] from the dead
[2:06:38] we
[2:06:39] we
[2:06:41] we we are his beneficiaries
[2:06:45] we who share
[2:06:46] the resurrection with him
[2:06:50] draws benefits from this
[2:06:54] by proving to the world
[2:06:56] that
[2:07:10] that
[2:07:15] where are you pointing see what are you
[2:07:17] reflecting
[2:07:20] what are you reflecting that's true
[2:07:22] let's say like this who are you
[2:07:24] reflecting let's watch
[2:07:38] it doesn't matter grandpa even if you
[2:07:41] just got a little faith
[2:07:44] he said
[2:07:46] you can say to a mountain video
[2:07:49] be moved
[2:07:50] you know we said brother brahman spoke
[2:07:52] those squirrels into existence
[2:07:56] but that was god instructing him
[2:07:59] hallelujah harry right says uh uh uh you
[2:08:02] know that ain't nothing but the truth
[2:08:05] brother brandon writer
[2:08:21] in order for these things to occur and
[2:08:23] happen in your life
[2:08:26] be a relationship
[2:08:28] with the same god
[2:08:30] elijah
[2:08:32] and he goes on to say in his rising of
[2:08:34] the sun
[2:08:37] he said elisha
[2:08:39] did twice as many miracles
[2:08:45] you know why
[2:08:47] because they knew the same god
[2:08:49] they had the same quickening spirit
[2:08:52] they had the same powers
[2:08:57] fell asleep
[2:09:00] right
[2:09:01] in other terms he died
[2:09:03] [Music]
[2:09:05] [Applause]
[2:09:16] if the bones can have his anointing
[2:09:18] still see this what about the bride of
[2:09:20] jesus christ so you must understand the
[2:09:23] anointing of god is not supposed to just
[2:09:25] anoint you
[2:09:26] on the outside
[2:09:28] it's supposed to anoint you from the
[2:09:30] inside as well
[2:09:31] it's not supposed to anoint you on the
[2:09:33] inside only
[2:09:34] but it's supposed to anoint you on the
[2:09:36] outside
[2:09:37] so much so paul had it
[2:09:41] paul had it
[2:09:42] paul had such an anointing
[2:09:56] and you and i must understand
[2:10:00] god is expecting more out of us than
[2:10:02] what he's getting
[2:10:05] and the only thing that's going to take
[2:10:07] you there is your love for him
[2:10:12] lester
[2:10:27] on that that tape
[2:10:29] wallow it's the rising of the side and
[2:10:30] you can't you can't just listen to it
[2:10:32] one time
[2:10:36] no you got to listen to it more than one
[2:10:37] time
[2:10:39] saturate yourself in it
[2:10:53] [Music]
[2:10:55] god is so good to us
