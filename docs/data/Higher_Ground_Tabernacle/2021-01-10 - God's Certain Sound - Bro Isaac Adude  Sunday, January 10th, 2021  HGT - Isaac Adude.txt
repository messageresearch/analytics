amen amen it's a it's a great privilege for us to be here and we thank the lord for it so we'll go straight to the word we'll turn our bibles to the book of psalms we'll read the verse 1 to verse 8. psalms 95 psalms let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation let us come before his presence thanksgiving and make a joyful notion to him for the lord is a great god and a great king above all gods in his hands are the deep places uh are the deep places of the earth the strength of the hills let us worship and bow down let us kneel before the lord our maker for he is our god and we are the people of his pasture and the i'm sorry today if you will hear his voice harden on your heart as in the provocation and as in the day of temptation in the wilderness amen may be seated this morning we will uh speak about the subject that we entitled god's certain sounds because if you read throughout the entire bible you will see that every time that god said something you know that thing came to you know every time a promise came out of the god's mouth you know that promise had to come to pass and we see here in the world we do have many sounds we have different sounds you know we have sounds that make people crazy you know we have sounds that make people sing you know we makes we have sounds that make people worship the devil you know we have sound that makes us you know feel like praying yeah there's something you know we have sounds you know that that that gives us faith yeah these songs are called the fourth you know it's like in the time of uh of the three hebrews children you know the king told them at the you know when they will hear the sound of the trumpet of all when did we hear the sound of all instruments you know they have to go bow down and and and worship the statue you know it was under a certain sound that there was you know that would lead that was about to lead them to worship and if this morning you know if this morning we will be able to listen to the sound of god you know to listen to the certain sound of god you know i believe that you know mighty things will happen you know i believe that we'll find a solution to all our problems you know because we say in the bible you know when jesus was on earth you know people didn't know who it was you know people saw him how he was born you know he they saw him in mary's house in joseph you know people didn't believe that jesus was actually god you know people didn't believe that jesus was the son of god you know they saw him walking and you know dealing with woods and and playing his other children you know they they they saw him as a normal person you know about one day john the baptist was able to turn into a child and to tune into a channel you know and then he heard the sound you know from heaven saying that this is the son this is my son you know this is my beloved son and hear him you know he heard the sound that was different from the other sounds you know he heard a sound that other people didn't hear you know why because you know god gave him a grace to turn into tune into that channel you know we have so many sounds today you know we see the example of abraham you know abraham heard the sound of faith you know he heard the sound he heard the sound of a promise you know god told him at this time i will come and visit you you know i will give you a son you know abraham was marketed you know people didn't believe him you know people thought abraham probably you probably were dreaming you heard somebody talking to you about why it's it was nobody talking about abraham knew the type of sound that he listened that he was listening to me you know abraham knew who said who promised who promised him you know abraham was able to look you know mighty long way how the lord brought him out of his father's his father's house and he believed that that sound was a certain sound you know he didn't have any doubt saying that you know he might be the lord or not you know he believed in him that that sound was a certain sound you know we see joe joe had you know you read the bible i mean you knew the word of god you knew that god was always meeting people under the blood and when his children you know went out in the scene you know he went and he gave a sacrifice and when you know then when the devil comes he was now attacking him you know people was treating job as a secret sinner you know people were saying that job your daughters or your sons you know went somewhere and they did something that is wrong you know that is why the lord is cursing you you know job knew job knew you know where he was standing you know job knew that that he heard the sound of god of the the the almighty god who meets people under the blood and he knew that he was offering he was giving the sacrifice every night you know that it was that was not unfair in vain you know that god one day will remember it you know that's why you know joe could have could stood well you know with boldness who stands with boldness you know saying that you know even though the warmth you know ate this body you know i know that my redeemer lives you know one day all the things that i'm seeing right now you know i won't be able to see them because i i was able to hear that certain sound you know i was i was able to hear that certain sound that was clear and i believe in it you know job didn't say that you know maybe the lord will you know maybe the lord will leave or maybe my redeemer leave again you know when somebody say i know that means he has faith you know he has experienced it you know that's why he can stand up and before people in front of people and say that i know that one day the lord will rise up again and we see that at the end at the end of the day the lord the lord came to his rescue you know we see the children of israel you know joshua in the children of israel you know they didn't have any tools you know to to to uh uh to go through that wall you know they didn't have any tools to break that wall you know you have you know for seven days and why are you walking you know don't lose faith you know you have to do the work of faith you know every single we're marching to zion you know you're not marching with doubt you know you're marching you're marching with faith you know we say joshua you have to walk the walk of faith and at the seventh day and the seventh hour and the seventh seventh time of the of the day you know when that time will come you know i want you to blow that trumpet you know i want you to see the blow that sound you know that sound of faith that will break that will break the you know we see that you know they're all saying and and shouted at the same time you know that what you know after that walk of faith and we see that jericho was broken the wall of jericho was broken you know they didn't have any any tools to break it now you know they didn't have any tools to break through that'd be pointless but what the hell you know they had the trust and they they only trust god you know they trusted god you know they saw that god has brought them a long way you know they saw how god has delivered them from the children from the the egyptians you know joshua heard the same sound that moses was here you know that i will be with you that i will be with you and i will never leave you and when that obstacle came before you know he remembered the voice of god you know he remembered the word of god you know that promised him joshua that i will always be with you and i will never forsake you and today you know if before us there's the wall of jericho you know you don't know where to go you don't know how to break through you know you just have to remember that void that that word you know you just have to remember that word that said i will always be with you and i will you know you have you have always to have that in your mind because that word is a certain sound you know it's a sound from the lord you know the prophet says that god never gives a sound that is uncertain you know always you know when you promise that thing will always come to pass you know what was the sound of joshua you know they heard the sound of faith the sound of victory you know the sound of your faith the sound of victory you know that was able to break that wall you know when they they're going through hard times and and trials you know instead of instead of singing you know and praising you know we see people singing the blues you know they sing the blues you know they they start to complain you know they start to complain and ask questions you know why why you know why why this is only why this is only coming to me you know what have i done to you know to have this you know but you have to sing your blues away you know you have to sing it away you know you have to stop praising god and remember that everything is for a purpose you know that god you know everything that he is bringing you through right now has a purpose you know it seems like nothing is going on or nothing is working you know you know you have to stop so you don't have to sing the blues you know you don't have to start complaining you know you just have faith in god no you just believe in his word and he will see you through you know the bible says in first corinthians chapter 14 verse 8. first corinthians chapter 14 verse 8 the bible says uh first corinthians chapter 14 verse 8. the bible says that for if the trumpet given uncertain sound you know if the sound that the trumpet is given is not certain it's not clear how are you going to get yourself ready for the battle you know because we have to remember that back in the days you know where it uh been in the days of old don le jour you know and when people the soldiers were going to war you know they were led under the sound of the trumpet and and and and those sound of the trumpet was like a words or or a signs for them to do to do specific things you know if the trumpet sounded like this and you know in this specific way you know it means that you have to go and fight you know if it sounds you know the other way you know it meant that you know you have to go you you have to uh to run or you have to hide you know but for them to understand that sound comprehension you know they had to be trained for me you know they had to go through a training for me and then to be able to understand you know every specific you know those different sounds you know and this is the same thing with us you know as christian the prophet says that when we're born again you know we are in the bottom you know we have a master you know who gives us sounds you know who gives us the sound of the trumpet you know you have to be trained in a certain way for you to be able to understand each different sounds that it gives you you know you have to be trained in a certain way to know that you know if if i'm going through these trials and and god says that he will never leave me and he will be with me and you say amen a trumpet gives an uncertain sound paragraph 102. it's it says that now paul said in the scriptures like training a soldier come for me if he doesn't know uh uh uh he doesn't know if the trumpet go or blows you know he will not know you know where whether to charge or to retreat [Music] you know if he doesn't know the difference you know what kind of a mixed up army would you have john darmian the enemy was certainly triumph over a bunch of soldiers that were no better terrain than that for me that's that's what's the mother uh the the mother with the church with the churches today with our churches today we train them we train them on creeds for me [Music] you know then which is which is uh then which is the trumpet they say the gospel trumpet it is that's it the word of the living god is the trumpet don't mix nothing with it no no you know don't have somebody play with with a friend with a french uh don't don't have somebody play a french harp and the other and the other when the other one blow a boot embargo you know the prophet here is saying that the church has to be trained you know into that specific sound of the truth you know to be able to listen to what god says you know to forget about the creeds you know to forget about what other people are saying you know to forget about what they know but to focus on what god is saying you know to focus on what god is saying on the sound of the trumpet from christian soldier heavens that's the sound i want to hear oh you say how do i know jesus said my sheep know my voice you know my ship hear my sound they know my trumpet and if a man says well hebrews hebrews 13 8 says jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever oh they say and and that didn't sound right that must have been a french horn that wasn't a trump trump because the bible gives no uncertain sounds now the question is that how are you going to know that this is an uncertain sound and so this is the sound from god you know it takes some training for information you know you have to go through the training you know that training will perf well perfect you're here and when you hear the word of god you know you will be able to unders to see that this is god and and then that thing that helps us to know the word of god there's the holy spirit you know because the prophet i was reading i think yesterday or the day before yesterday you know the prophet was saying that you know people usually people nowadays you know they're basically they base their their faith on the fruits of the spirit that's done for them if we do this you know it's good to have the food of the spirit i mean i mean it's the fruit of the spirits are good only but we don't have to base we but we don't have to be based on that to say that we don't have the holy spirit you know he gave the example of the priest and jesus you know the priest showed all the fruit of the spirit you know when people were sick the priest went to them we went to visit them you know when when the people were hungry the priests give gave them food you know white white people needed people somebody to comfort them the priests were there you know when they needed money to preach the priest led them to to go and sell things to church in church but here it comes in jesus name you know he saw people selling a trillion you know been in the temple you know he kicked them out you know he was treated as a weak as wicked you know he he saw the fig tree he cursed it you know and it did everything that was contrary you know from where from what the priest was to what we're doing so now if if just by the you know if the priest if people base their their faith on the priest on the fruits of the spirit you know saying that they have the holy spirit because of that the if the foreign had the fruit of the spirit you know but they denied the word of god they denied the manifestation that the word of god manifested in their time you know and the prophet goes and says and he said that the evidence of the holy spirit is some ways to believe in your in the word of god you know to your heart to believe in a hundred percent of this word and when you have the holy spirit inside of you you know that holy spirit will help you she sent this people you know to know that this is the sound from god and this is a certain sound and this is not a certain sound because remember the bible says you know that in the in the end time you know there will come people but you know the spirit of antichrist will be so close to the spirit of the truth only the elected one will will not we will not follow it you know how wide the elected one will be able to recognize the sound of the of the of the antichrist [Music] because inside of them they do have the holy spirit because inside of them they do have the word of god and when the word of god meets the word of god you know it says amen to it and if the word of god doesn't mean and he says that this is something there's something wrong with this you know that we said that this sound is uncertain it's not a certain sound you know god's promise never failed the promises you know he promised that he would deliver the children of israel you know after after 40 years you know that promise came to pass you know he promised his son to abraham you know and abraham finally got a song you know he swore that he would raise up he raised up david you know he promised that he would send john the baptist you know before the coming of jesus christ you know that promise that promise came to pass you know he promised that he would send us messiah you know he promised the world will get into the great group of organizations and make a system a formula system you know and no and and no the system or a power no as the the and we'll be up there setting us uh setting on seven hills and he did it just like that you know how the church will be pers he promised how the church will be persecuting how the church will be persecuting them you know he did exactly that you know how they come to how they came how they they come out in the reformation and they did exactly that you know any promise for this age and is fulfilled you know death is swallowed up in victory and the last one is vindicated then there will come an eternal peace upon the earth and eternal shalom peace will rest upon the earth you know when jesus came you know he is fulfilling the word today but when all of this word what about but when all of his promised word you know which was the thought of god thought means expressed you know god's thinking he's thinking you know and expressed it through his prophets and now he has to be fulfilled you know now he promised he promised to send christ the second time and whenever and whenever he does when christ comes the second time there will be an eternal shalom you know god's promise never never never god's promise never failed you know throughout the entire bible you know god promised us that you know god promised the people god promised his people good things you know but those things came to pass it shows you know it's he promised the children of israel that he will always be with him it was impossible for them to overcome you know they just remembered about the word of god you know they remembering everything that moses says told them and then they they you know their faith was built up and god came to their rescue and god has many promises for us you know the bible has many promises for us you know if we read in psalms chapter 55 you know verse 22 we'll see some promises of god you know psalms chapter 55 verse 22. you know when you're in doubt you know when you think that you know i can't i can't you know i i can't carry this weight you know here is god's promise cast thy burden upon the lord it shall never suffer that the rock just to be moved you know when you feel down and condemned you know there's a promise of god for you you know in romans chapter 8 verse 3 verse 3 31 to 39. you know when you feel so condemned you know you think that your sin is so big that god can never forgive you you know you think that you have done something that you know that cannot be you know forgiven you know here is the promise of god foreign what shall we then say to these things if god be for us who can be against us but deliberately how shall he not with him also freely give us things you know verse 30 verse 33 said who shall lay anything to the charge of god's elect it is god that justifies you who is he that condemned it is christ that died yeah rather jumpers there you know as it is written for the sake but we are accounting as sheep for the slaughter we are accounted as cheap for slaughter in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us for i am persuaded that neither death nor life no angels no principalities no you know when you feel so condemned you know god has a promise for you you know he says that he takes care of you you know when you feel so condemned then your sin is so big you know god is inviting us you know to come to that meeting you know when you feel that god is so too far you know you know god's promise for you you know you take those promises and if you believe in those promises you know you will see a change in your life you know you will see that you know your life will change you know because god's promise never fails you know the prophet says that but when he gets in the right swing of it and the right spirit of it how are you going to do it until the spirit comes down you know the spirit of the composer compositor then when you say the days of miracles it never passed yeah the symphony cries out amen when we hit jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever you shall receive power after the holy spirit after the holy ghost is is come up upon you the symphony cries out christ amen oh it's magnificent similar for you the director and the composer must be in the same spirit and so must the musician be in the same spirit to act it all out and the word is wondering what's going on you know the the god's word is compared to a symphony you know if you look at if you listen to a classic classic music music classic you know you will see that there is a difference between classic music and and jazz and blues music because in jazz blues and other type of music you know if somebody makes a mistake you know you can easily cover that mistake and it'll become a new chord or you know a new way of playing it you know that was sounds you know that would be a big difference to the to the music that would make a big difference to the music they have to go under a certain you know they have to go they have to be perfect you know and god's word and and for them to be perfect you know they have to enter they have to be in the same atmosphere as the spirit they have to have the same spirit as the composer you know when they are in the same spirit as the composer and then the composer gives the music to the the director and the director you know with the signs he will start leading the music the orchestra you know you know god's words it's the same thing you know it's the great symphony you know you have to be in the spirit of the you have to be in the spirit of god you know you have to be in the same spirit you know for you to follow this word all you know all along you know you have to be in the spirit of god you know for you to know each sound you know for you to know each steps of the way you know what to do in every step now god's god's god writes you know it gives it to the director and the director will be able now to lead the musicians you know and if you know this with the with the with classic music you know the director never speaks you know he has signs you know he will move this way and you know he has you know you have to go under this certain bit you know you would do it will do this that means that this certain you know play these people have to play but you have to focus on the you know you have to focus on every science that he's doing for you to be able to understand it and when god gives the word or erase the word you know he gave he gave the word to the prophet and the prophet as a director of god you know he is able to you know to read the word of god and to give us the signs you know when you need the holy spirit you know it gives us as god's word said that you have to repent and you have to repent and be baptized you know be baptized and then you will receive the you know the gift of the holy spirit you know if you are into that if you are into the the that spirit you know you will say amen to it and you will see it you will see it happen you know if you need if you need something you know you will see you will see god's word you know god's promise for you for that thing and if you are under that same spirit you know you will be able to understand it and there are signs that the prophet has given us you know the signs of the end time you know what will come what will come to the end you know how the world will be you know how people's behavior will be you know but for you to understand it you know you have to be under that's that same spirit you know it doesn't have to be a creed you know it doesn't have to be you know something that you have heard from someone but you have to have something you know that yourself you are experiencing with god experience you know because we have many people on you know many people on earth you know who can read the same bible you know who can listen to the same tape but they will never understand anything but from that from that table or the bible why to translate it you know when people are saying that you know the the earth you know everything is going wrong and the earth you know there is no hope for tomorrow you know you have to be able to hear the sound of god you know god's sound that different sound you know that's that sounds you know of of the city that john saw coming you know that sound of the bride and the groom uniting you know be able to listen to that sound you know that sound of the rapture you know that sound that is crying you know to get back in the line you know that sound is crying that sound that is crying that that sound is going out you know telling you that god is the same yesterday today and forever you know that sound that is going on you know telling you that he is your healer you know that sound that is going on you know telling you that he is your provider you know that sound that is going on you know telling you you know every step that you have to take you know but how are you going to understand it you know how are you going to be able to listen to that sound you know you have to be under the spirit you have to be in the same spirit of the you have to be in the spirit of the composer you know to be able to understand the music you know to be able to understand it you know if you play another note you know you have to be able to you have to pay exactly what the bible says you know the prophet says that stay in the symphony you know sometimes it causes trouble it sometimes it causes trouble to break the bends to set you free he does that you say well i don't know what i do you know he does what difference you're you're just playing the part you're just playing the part it is the one that's got you in so we know what the symphony does today it's separating time taking the light from darkness you know that god's symphony you know it's giving a sound song you know it's giving a message telling you to get ready you know she went to look for oil but it was too late you know that trumpet is god's word and we also blessed to receive the prophet you know who has explained to us the bible and every step of god's of every step of the of the way of the journey and there is no excuses for us you know you have to tune yourself into that spirit you know into that channel that you will be able to to hear that sound and know exactly what what and when you get so deep into god's spirit you know you will be able you will be able to move even before you hear the sound because you will be so connected to god you know that sometimes you won't need that sometimes god will not that sometimes god would not speak he would just nod at you and then you will know exactly what to do you know it's like the three the three are soldiers of david you know david was crying you know who would give me the water from from bethlehem you know other soldiers were there but they did not understand the sound that david was making you know other soldiers heard david crying you know they heard david thirsting from water but they didn't understand the message you know behind david's cry and it happened that they were in the same spirit as david you know they went to bethlehem did not give a message that was you know clear to everybody to understand you know it was clear and certain for a group of people it was a secret or a accorded message for for a group of people and just a few you know was able to understand it you know god's word is here you know everybody can read this word but this word is a specific message for a certain group of people you know this message is a specific message you know for for for the elected of the end times you know and to to have a uh you know a talk with god and to be able to understand the you know by myself my own ears you know cannot kept really get i can't really understand the message behind the scenes there is so many sounds going on right now you know there is sounds of you know there is sound there's many sounds and i don't know which one to follow you know because sometimes all of them you know they look exactly the same and there is only a little bit of difference lord i want to be able to understand the message that you're giving me and god who's rich in mercy you know he will teach you how to understand the sound you know he will teach you step by step you know you just have to be patient you know you just have to have faith you just have to trust him because his promise everything that comes out of his mouth you know always come to pass you know i don't know what you're going through right now but there is a sound for your situation you know there is a promise of god for your situation you know if you can only you know get into that spirit the spirit of the composer composition you know you will be able to understand that sound and that sound will give you faith you know it's like the prophet you know he was lost in the it was lost in the mountains you know there is the snow coming you know he didn't know where to go you know he thought that he knew the way but he didn't know he actually didn't know you know he was doing the dead walk you know walking you know around the same thing but he just needed to hear a sound you know a voice of god you know that could have told him to trust in him you know to trust him you know to forsake all of his knowledge and to put his trust in him and when he did that you know he found this way you just trust the lord you know there are sounds of doubt that can come to you you know saying that you cannot overcome this this this battle there are sounds of doubts that can come to you saying that you've seen and your sin cannot be forgiven you know there is sounds of doubt that can that can come to you saying that your sickness will lead you to death you know there is sounds of death your doubts that can come to you you know saying that you can never serve god the door is closed for you you know there is all kinds of sounds but god also do have a sound and this sound is the only sound that is certain and the sound is is that he will not rest until he finishes the plane of redemption you know his sound is you know he you know like the prodigal son you know he had sounds coming up he had sounds you know playing in his head saying that he will be rejected by his father you know if he's saying that his father will never we never welcome him back and now he was getting ready to take the place of a servant but his father had a different sound you know his father had a different sound and when he heard that sound you know that sound made him feel like it made him feel like a son it was a son and it was not a servant you know god has a different sound for you you know god has a specific sound for you you know and if you can only trust in him you know in closing the prophet says don't break the rhythm if why did this happen because you see our evil i tried it brother and when they turned me out but uh and and went and when they turned me out you know that i was down i and what junction it's got to make it yes sir before it's written he knows all about it he knows the rhythm [Music] in in the write on you know god has said the rhythm before the foundation of the world you know they try to change the rhythm by bringing creeds and and and all kinds of beliefs you know they they try to present it to people in different ways you know with different notes you know the same god of genesis is the same god of revelations you know what it did in genesis is the same thing that he's doing if you can only if you can only keep that rhythm you will see the same result you know if you can only keep the rhythm as as abraham kept tears you will see the same result you know if you keep the rhythm as noah kept the rhythm god god gave him a sound a message of the earth that was going to be destroyed by him he will be saved only if he builds the ark and noah followed that rhythm and him and his family was saved you know god gave the rhythm to the children of israel why did passed by them you know the defense did not care [Music] and here is the same thing that same death angel is passing you know it might not be it might not be it's you know it's passing killing people but the rhythm is still the same if you apply the blood you know god promised you things you know you go you go and you go walk and and believe it you know you do as the children of israel did effect you know they believed they trusted what joshua had told them you know you know he gave his word to the prophet and the prophet now gave the word to us you know he transmitted god's word to us and that word is true and if we can only keep the wisdom you know we'll see the same result as all the saints have seen come to this you know we'll see the same results and what the result that you want to hear you know you want to hear one day that jesus tells you that he tells you you know you know a true and faithful servant because you did exactly what what i've told you you know the reason that you want to hear you know it's that one day that jesus tells you something well done you know that that's that's that's that's the result that you want to hear the result of god you know if you keep that rhythm you know there is a lot of promises you know you just keep the rhythm of god you know you just believe you know it gets hard sometimes as the prophet says you know for sure trouble will come you know sometimes you know you will think that you can't overcome it it's something true that you can never overcome it by yourself you know that's why that's why the prophet says that we don't need power no because god already overcome overcome it for us you know you just need the authority of god you just need your authority to know who you know where is my where is my portion you know where is it see you know you're not going to beg for it but you're going to fight for it you know you're going god promised you and it's it's yours you know god promised you good health it's yours you know god's promised you blessings you know god's care about our bodies he cares because he cares about our soul and he promised you all those things and it's yours you know you just have to have faith and to go claim it you know say the lord one day there on the cross lord you you say that everything is fulfilled you know everything is fulfilled means everything you know even though he didn't name what the things that were fulfilled because it will take all the eternity for him to name all the things you know he just said it all in once everything is fulfilled so that when you will come with your trial when you come with your problems and then you don't see it but if jesus named it and you come with your problem you don't see it you know you will not say that this scripture or it's not for me you know he shed his blood now for nothing you know he shed his blood for a certain purpose you know you need something you need you know whatever you need you know the prophet says that god has an empty check that you know people need to come and fill that out you know you come with your problem you come with everything you just filled that out you know that check this sound is signed by jesus jesus himself jesus and the bank of heaven you know the banks of heaven are you know willing and they're happy you know when you go withdraw money from there and and you know just have faith you know i know that you know yeah i know that you know it was hard for me to you know to uh to make this clear you know but you just have faith you know if you want to understand that you know the entire message you know all it was about faith you know you just have faith you know don't do not have negative thoughts you know don't feel as if you're forsaken because it won't be there for eternity you know there is a specific time for everybody you know if you can only come you know wherever you are you know you can only stand up you know stand up and and and say it and speak to the lord you know what whatever you need as the musician comes whatever you need you know you speak to him you know be able to speak to him you know moses was
