[12:20] the New Jerusalem coming down from God
[12:23] out of heaven prepared as a bride
[12:26] adorned for her husband and I heard a
[12:29] great voice out of heaven saying behold
[12:31] the tabernacle of God is with men he
[12:34] shall dwell with them they shall be his

[13:33] evening

[13:40] gone to prepare a place for us amen if
[13:43] he goes from here a place for us he says
[13:45] I will come again and I will receive you
[13:47] unto myself a mess not that he's left us
[13:51] alone to slog things out with ourselves
[13:54] no he's had a plan the entire time amen
[13:57] since before the foundation of the world
[13:59] he has had a plan for every minute of
[14:02] our lives he is not worried he is not
[14:05] concerned jesus is not up there wringing
[14:09] his hands wondering what he's gonna do
[14:11] with our situation you know it's one
[14:13] thing like if my children you know if if
[14:16] one of them does something wrong if one
[14:19] of them does something that I
[14:21] like if I tell them to do one thing and
[14:22] they go and do something contrary to
[14:25] that you know I'm never gonna take my
[14:28] children and SCIM to prison for life you
[14:31] know here in this nation you know
[14:33] someone they they they do they do a
[14:36] certain wrong or something wicked or
[14:39] something evil and and we take them to
[14:41] the judge and we say they done this this
[14:43] and the penalty of this particular thing
[14:47] that's against the law
[14:48] the penalty is ten years twenty years
[14:50] thirty years or even life in prison and
[14:53] the judge will look at that man in the
[14:55] eye and say I hereby condemn you to a
[14:58] life in prison for the sins that you
[15:00] have done but it's not that way with
[15:02] Christ and his bride a men who and we
[15:04] when Christ he looks at his bride when
[15:07] we do something wrong he he looks upon
[15:09] us with mercy we were pin of it and he's
[15:11] never going to take his children and
[15:13] place them in a life in prison
[15:14] Amen he always has a way provided for
[15:18] his children to come back out of the
[15:20] condition that they are in they meant
[15:22] yet from before the foundation of the
[15:24] world
[15:24] eople it he put our names upon the
[15:26] Lamb's Book of Life and he slew a lamb
[15:29] for those names that if any of those
[15:31] names that are ever in need of
[15:32] forgiveness or mercy or grace that all
[15:35] they have to do is cry out for the blood
[15:36] of that lamb amen and any one of those
[15:39] names that is written upon the Lamb's
[15:41] Book of Life all you I do is cry out for
[15:43] the blood of that lamb and when Christ
[15:45] looks down and mercy at his children he
[15:48] said he says I will forgive you of that
[15:50] I'll forgive you for this I'll forgive
[15:52] you for that
[15:53] amen he won't sit ins you for a lot to
[15:55] life in prison but he says I will have
[15:57] mercy upon you amen amen you know ever
[16:01] since we've come upon this journey you
[16:03] know we first hear the gospel you know
[16:05] maybe we don't know exactly where it's
[16:07] going you know we don't know exactly
[16:08] what it is we hear that there was a God
[16:10] in heaven and then he has a plan we hear
[16:12] but that there's a that there is a
[16:14] heaven he has a place for us that he's
[16:16] gone prepared amen when we hear the
[16:19] story about how he died upon the cross
[16:21] amen and it looks new it's a pleasant
[16:24] thing and you only think my I just
[16:28] there's something that rings down on the
[16:30] inside you know you don't have the full
[16:32] revelation of it you know when you first
[16:33] CONUS your
[16:34] you don't know exactly where it's going
[16:36] you don't know what it's doing me you
[16:37] know one thing's for sure
[16:38] I gotta go that way amen when Christ
[16:41] first reveals himself to you I mean when
[16:44] Christ first begins to reveal his word
[16:47] to you
[16:47] it does something down on the inside
[16:49] that maybe you don't have the
[16:51] understanding maybe you don't know what
[16:53] it is the one thing for sure you know
[16:55] that's the direction that I'm going a
[16:57] man that's that's where I'm headed
[16:59] that's I don't know what I don't know
[17:01] what it means I don't know what all it's
[17:03] about but I'm gonna go that way a man
[17:05] who just walk in the light as he isn't
[17:07] alike and you just keep walking and you
[17:10] learn more you learn more and Christ
[17:12] begins revealing more of his word to you
[17:15] and revealing more of his word to you
[17:17] and as you begin to see his goodness and
[17:19] his mercy and you begin to worship him
[17:23] they begin to praise him it becomes more
[17:25] and more beautiful to you a man you know
[17:28] it's the thing about is you know is is
[17:29] when you're in the flesh when you're in
[17:31] the things of Satan sin is attractive
[17:34] you know and sin this that sin looks
[17:37] beautiful and when you're in the world
[17:39] and you love the things of the world and
[17:41] you're and you're in your whatever Satan
[17:44] puts across your mind to do and you go
[17:46] and do it before you're converted you
[17:48] know and and you just say and you go
[17:49] this and all those things I look there's
[17:51] something flashing in front of your eyes
[17:53] something attractive and you run over
[17:55] here and do this do you think why did I
[17:57] do such a thing
[17:57] you're run over here and do this you
[17:59] think why did I do such a thing and your
[18:02] heart you know condemns you and you know
[18:03] it but then when you meet Christ then
[18:07] when Christ begins to rule you and draw
[18:10] you all sudden the things of the world
[18:12] become strangely dim and you begin to
[18:15] hate those things more and how those
[18:17] things used to attract you now they just
[18:19] don't seem to attract you anymore and
[18:22] now your affections are set upon things
[18:24] that are above a man in Christ becomes
[18:27] attractive to you a man the Holy Spirit
[18:30] becomes attractive to you church service
[18:33] has become attractive to you you begin
[18:35] to love the things of the Lord you open
[18:36] up the Bible whole sudden you know used
[18:38] to be just a dry dusty book sitting on
[18:40] the Shelf but all of a sudden something
[18:42] just I don't you ever had the experience
[18:44] you know where you open it you're
[18:45] reading also just takes your breath away
[18:47] like
[18:48] oh my I never saw it this way before you
[18:51] know and you know there's there's been
[18:54] times to be reading in the Bible all
[18:55] saying like oh my brother Brandon was
[18:57] sitting right here when he saw this st.
[19:00] Paul was reading this and he caught the
[19:03] revelant and this is where he got that
[19:04] revelation you know or you know and just
[19:07] you know Peter was reading the Old
[19:09] Testament oh this is where Peter was
[19:11] reading when he got that revelation you
[19:13] know and this is why he was able to
[19:14] write this or write that amen and it
[19:17] just it does something to you amen and
[19:19] the beginning of the revelation of
[19:21] Christ all through your life's journey
[19:24] as Christ has become more and more
[19:26] revealed unto you he becomes more and
[19:29] more attractive to you and more and more
[19:31] beautiful to you
[19:32] Amen what is it it's a it's a love
[19:34] affair Amen it's a love affair it's it's
[19:38] it's like a man with a when he first

[19:43] I'd like to get to know this girl better
[19:46] and they get to know and he he falls in
[19:48] love with her and that love changes
[19:50] throughout life and you know the love
[19:53] you have for a girl as a teenager or
[19:55] changes as you get in your 20s and when
[19:58] you get married or the first decade the
[20:00] second decade third decade it changes
[20:03] and it changes why it's growing more and
[20:05] more mature and so is our love with
[20:07] Christ growing more and more mature in
[20:10] him amen as we get to know him more we
[20:13] begin to see what he's capable of how
[20:16] much he really does love us you know you
[20:19] know though I remember you know there's
[20:20] times really my walk that I thought I
[20:21] was ready for the rapture amen and then
[20:24] you go through a fury time of
[20:26] temptations and battles and snares and
[20:28] you want to where am I at now you know
[20:30] and and then you only come out on the
[20:32] other side he just loved him all the
[20:34] more a man and now you'reyou're relate
[20:37] you're a lot more settled in Christ a
[20:39] man you go through the hard battles the
[20:41] hard times or or you go through the
[20:43] mountaintop experience is where you need
[20:45] God to meet you in the field of action
[20:48] and all of a sudden he comes down right
[20:50] there and he meets you right there and
[20:52] he does something that you couldn't do
[20:53] for yourself something you weren't even
[20:55] worthy of and and something you you're
[20:58] right in the moment and when you were at
[20:59] your weakest moment he becomes
[21:01] strongest allies amen and just saying
[21:04] just sit it just makes you love them all
[21:06] the more ami of the times when you're
[21:08] not even worthy of having your prayers
[21:10] answered amen the times when when you
[21:13] you're not even worthy of him even
[21:16] listening to you and he comes and he
[21:18] answers your prayer anywhere or or gives
[21:20] you a blessing anyhow a man gives you
[21:23] something you weren't even looking for
[21:24] and it's just times like that you know
[21:27] it just makes you love him even more
[21:29] amen amen when your eyes are opened your
[21:34] Christ becomes more and more attractive
[21:37] amen amen all of creation is waiting for
[21:43] the manifestation of Christ just as much
[21:46] or just as much as we are waiting for
[21:49] the manifestation of Christ all creation
[21:52] is waiting for the manifestation of his
[21:54] bride a man just as much all creation is
[21:57] looking for his bride to be manifested
[21:59] amen all creation is waiting for that
[22:02] and we are waiting for the manifold
[22:05] manifestation of Christ in us we're
[22:07] waiting so that Christ has such the
[22:10] preeminence in this body of flesh that
[22:12] all us do is just one little not one
[22:16] little nudge from Christ and we're gone
[22:18] we're off about our father's business we
[22:21] are waiting for that time where Christ
[22:23] is so revealed in us that Christ has
[22:25] such the such sway over our bodies that
[22:28] we have surrendered so much to Christ
[22:30] that all Christ has to do is say I want
[22:33] you to go this and we say yes Lord we'll
[22:36] go do that but off we are know about our
[22:38] father's business Amen that's what we're
[22:41] waiting for that and earth is waiting
[22:43] for that amen installing the psalmist
[22:47] says Christ speaking about his bride
[22:49] says as the lily among the thorns so is
[22:53] my love among the daughters then the
[22:55] bride speaks back to the next verse it
[22:57] says as the apple tree among the trees
[22:59] of the wood so is my beloved among the
[23:01] sons were unique to Christ we are unique
[23:06] to Christ why we have his own nature his
[23:08] own Spirit inside of us amen you know no
[23:11] man wants to marry someone who doesn't
[23:14] think like him
[23:16] doesn't act like him doesn't doesn't
[23:18] doesn't want to be with him no man wants
[23:20] to marry a woman that has nothing to do
[23:23] with him isn't interested in things that
[23:25] he's interested in a man a woman once
[23:28] our man wants to marry a woman that
[23:30] thinks like he thinks it has things in
[23:33] common
[23:34] amen and the only way Christ is never
[23:36] gonna get a bride on this earth is if
[23:38] it's a somehow some way she think has
[23:41] things in common with him a man there's
[23:44] no way that man can think like God
[23:45] thinks unless somehow some way she be
[23:49] endued with power from on high and so
[23:52] somehow his thinking comes down on the
[23:54] inside and that a sort of some way
[23:57] somehow his thinking comes down on the
[23:59] inside and all sudden it's a
[24:01] supernatural thing God said we cannot
[24:03] think like man like God thinks because
[24:06] his ways are higher than our ways a man
[24:09] but then he said that we have the mind
[24:11] of Christ amen oh my is it shows that
[24:15] something is taking place
[24:16] something is happening stir the brew and
[24:20] a bride begins to think like Christ
[24:22] thinks
[24:22] begin to love like Christ loves why we
[24:25] like we like I said we have we have we
[24:27] have what the faith we believe like
[24:29] Christ believes a man we have we have
[24:32] knowledge and temperance we have
[24:34] patience like God has patience we have
[24:36] godliness to act like God when when just
[24:39] like brother brand you know when Adam
[24:41] wait to go name all the animals when he
[24:44] named him you know what he named well he
[24:46] named him just the same thing as if God
[24:48] was going to name Amen you know good God
[24:51] will looked at Adam and Eve naming the
[24:53] animals and and and you know what and
[24:55] God says you know if I was to name that
[24:57] animal monkey that's exactly what I
[24:59] would have named it if I was to give
[25:01] that attribute that animal without
[25:02] thinking that I don't know that's
[25:03] exactly what I would have done why I
[25:05] guess Adam was about his father's
[25:07] business
[25:07] he had the attribute of his father on
[25:10] the inside and he did the things that
[25:12] his father his about his father's
[25:14] business
[25:15] amen those attributes are to be claimed
[25:18] upon this earth those attributes are to
[25:21] be endued in bodies of flesh those
[25:23] attributes are to be manifested here on
[25:25] the earth
[25:26] amen all of Earth is waiting for that
[25:29] man
[25:29] station Amen you know you think about a
[25:32] few have seen the the pictures of like
[25:35] those cities in China that are just
[25:37] overtaking the smog and pollution you
[25:39] know and you see the the people walking
[25:42] around with masks over their face they
[25:45] have areas buildings set there like bars
[25:49] but instead of giving an alcohol they
[25:50] give out fresh air and they give out
[25:53] like flavored oxygen and they pump it
[25:56] through this special sense and
[25:59] everything you can go and escape the
[26:00] pollution that's in the air and going
[26:02] there and take a breath of fresh air and
[26:05] they have a little fresh air booths
[26:06] along the city it's like a bus stop and
[26:08] you can walk into this fresh air booth
[26:10] and get a brush or fret they're fresh
[26:12] air and let me tell you ever I think had
[26:15] to think about this every plant every
[26:18] tree every weed every every flower in
[26:23] that city is waiting for a manifestation
[26:25] for a brush for just a breath of fresh
[26:28] air it's just all the DNA of all those
[26:31] plants is waiting for the manifestation
[26:33] of fresh air upon that city all the
[26:36] people are waiting for that pollution to
[26:38] be gone they're not they weren't meant
[26:40] to wear masks upon their faces but their
[26:42] whole bodies are crying out for a brush
[26:44] for just a breath of fresh air they're
[26:47] waiting and so is the earth waiting for
[26:50] a breath of fresh air wait for a special
[26:53] atmosphere a special oxygen so the DNA
[26:57] down on the inside can manifest exactly
[27:00] what was written down on the inside and
[27:02] so is the Bride of Christ waiting for an
[27:05] atmosphere waiting for a atmosphere
[27:09] that's down on the inside of down in the
[27:11] Holies of Holies it's a special place
[27:13] it's a special atmosphere if they can
[27:16] only be found in one place and the
[27:17] Holies of Holies when you eat you're in
[27:19] and the and the and the curtain comes
[27:22] down behind you and you begin to realize
[27:24] them not just in a not just in a natural
[27:27] place I'm not just in a man-made
[27:30] atmosphere but I'm in a atmosphere
[27:32] azzaman charged by the presence of the
[27:34] Most High God a place where anything can
[27:37] happen a place has been designed by God
[27:40] you think down in China where a man by
[27:43] his wisdom
[27:43] to design a place so that people can
[27:46] become what they're supposed to be so
[27:48] the people can be clear-headed and think
[27:50] the way they're supposed to think to
[27:52] have oxygen the way they're supposed to
[27:53] have oxygen a man and his intelligence
[27:55] has to create a place for people to go
[27:58] but so God in His wisdom and this place
[28:02] of sin and pollution has designed a
[28:05] place for his bride to escape to a place
[28:08] in the Holies of Holies where she can go
[28:10] and escape sin and pollution where she
[28:14] can go and escape and get away from all
[28:17] the things that are all around us and
[28:19] surrounding us and she can go into that
[28:21] Holies of Holies and the curtain closes
[28:24] behind her and when she enters into that
[28:26] place her DNA just takes a quick deep
[28:30] breath and it relaxes and it begins
[28:33] thinking the way it was designed to
[28:35] think her broad he begins to act the way
[28:37] is designed to act her affections are
[28:39] set on the things above and she because
[28:42] the love the way that she's supposed to
[28:43] love she begins to have a compassion the
[28:47] way she's supposed to have compassion
[28:49] all of her spiritual DNA begins to act
[28:52] the way it's supposed to act she looks
[28:55] upon her brothers the sisters the way
[28:56] she's supposed to look upon her brothers
[28:58] and sisters maybe she looks upon the
[29:00] loss the way she's supposed to look upon
[29:02] the lost why because the things of the
[29:04] earth are closed off behind her a man
[29:07] and she's in a special atmosphere she is
[29:09] being changed from glory unto glory amen
[29:14] amen
[29:15] Sunday I wanted to get into the adoption
[29:18] you know I've been listening to those
[29:19] adoption seriesin and I felt like I got
[29:22] right to the border but I couldn't quite
[29:24] get into it sunday a man I had in mind
[29:26] that this evening that I would preach I
[29:28] wanted to preach on the adoption and
[29:30] when I when I got down to study and it
[29:34] just seemed like everything was against
[29:35] me studying like working a lot of hours
[29:37] this week today I worked 12 hours and
[29:40] went in at 4:30 this morning and I just
[29:44] all I wanted to study for the study for
[29:46] listen and and when I thought well I'm
[29:48] going to study that adoption service I'm
[29:50] gonna study that adoption series and
[29:52] when I got into the room it seems like
[29:54] they just went a completely different
[29:55] way but yet it was all still linked
[29:57] together
[29:58] amen amen and so I start instead of
[30:02] getting to the Dobson series I started
[30:04] getting into the oh the heavenly City
[30:12] the New Jerusalem
[30:13] I can't run the name of the sermon all
[30:15] of a sudden but um the future home for
[30:20] the Amen I started reading through there
[30:22] and it just seemed like it was just all
[30:24] coming together amen so the bride is
[30:33] being prepared
[30:35] amen she is she is removing herself more
[30:40] and more from the influences of this
[30:43] earth amen and she is gathering herself
[30:47] into the influences of heaven amen as
[30:50] she is rejecting the things of the earth
[30:53] more and more and cotton is coming less
[30:55] more less from the negative and more
[30:57] towards the positive and she spends more
[30:59] and more time in the atmosphere that she
[31:02] was designed to live in more and more
[31:04] time in that heavenly atmosphere she
[31:07] begins to be changed from glory to glory
[31:09] what is she she is being shaped in that
[31:11] pyramid that we always talk about she is
[31:13] growing up and growing up she was
[31:15] designed to be in that shape he's
[31:18] designed to be in that shape yes
[31:19] designed to have that faith as the as
[31:23] the as the the foundation the foundation
[31:26] she's designed she has to have that
[31:29] foundation let me tell you Saints if you
[31:31] can't if you can't believe if you can't
[31:34] believe in Christ if he can't believe
[31:37] that he'll take care of you if they
[31:39] can't believe that he will fulfill his
[31:41] word if you can't believe that he'll
[31:43] fulfill every moment of the word if you
[31:46] can't hang your soul and every word and
[31:48] is in this book then you got it you got
[31:51] to start right there amen if you didn't
[31:53] tell you get that faith that God is
[31:55] gonna keep his word amen that God is is
[31:59] is heaven bound to to complete every bit
[32:04] of this word and all heaven is behind
[32:07] you to fulfill this word amen all the
[32:10] all the
[32:11] powers in heaven is behind you to
[32:14] fulfill what is on the inside of this
[32:15] book a man you got to have faith behind
[32:18] you to push you into that amen and when
[32:22] you get that you you you you're built
[32:24] you're on a solid foundation just like
[32:27] Abraham now you are entering into
[32:28] Abraham as Abraham walked in that city
[32:31] it didn't walked around that land as a
[32:34] promised land but there was nothing
[32:35] built there yet
[32:36] amen so what'd he do he walked around
[32:38] that land and faith nothing was built
[32:40] there yet there was no there was no
[32:42] place he he met the mayor of the city
[32:44] but he didn't find the city so he met
[32:47] Melchizedek but where was the city milk
[32:49] his neck was from I he's looking he's
[32:51] gotta be around here somewhere but where
[32:53] is it but he walked around there in
[32:54] faith faith was the foundation he walked
[32:57] around there in faith and as he kept
[32:59] building upon that building upon that
[33:01] building upon that he was building a
[33:03] city and he didn't even know it
[33:05] amen hey man one of these days that city
[33:07] is gonna come down and it's gonna can't
[33:09] let it comes down it'll be in the exact
[33:11] same shape as what Abraham built think
[33:16] about that the city that comes down will
[33:18] be in the same shape as the city that
[33:21] Abraham was built through the attributes
[33:22] that he had it on the inside
[33:24] the Abraham faith and so is the bride in
[33:28] the same way the same faith that she has
[33:31] that city will come down in the same
[33:33] shape that we are building here on the
[33:36] earth down on the inside the Holy Spirit
[33:38] adding attribute to a true attribute to
[33:41] attribute think about Christ when he
[33:43] came here did he have faith a man now
[33:47] what was now let's think about what was
[33:48] Christ Christ means The Anointed One
[33:51] amen so so Christ was formed in the in
[33:55] the womb of Mary there created that word
[33:59] of God created there placed that blood
[34:02] cell placed down on the inside of Mary
[34:04] not by the act of man but by the act of
[34:07] God placed there and what was it it was
[34:09] given a body a body was prepared and
[34:13] what came forth a man child a man child
[34:17] what was it what went and as and as now
[34:20] I did now I did Jesus Christ eat of the
[34:23] fruits of the earth
[34:25] he did he grew up in wisdom in nature
[34:28] and as he is growing his body was
[34:29] partaking of the fruits of the earth and
[34:32] things and he was growing up and growing
[34:34] up now remember the earth was cursed the
[34:38] earth was cursed so here's this portion
[34:45] of the earth is walking around its
[34:48] anointed as Christ the Anointed One and
[34:52] he's eating the fruit of the land he's
[34:54] growing up stronger physically stronger
[34:57] physically growing up growing up growing
[34:59] up and what is this earth that's walking
[35:01] on Christ God Himself is redeeming a
[35:04] part of the earth he the Holy Spirit is
[35:07] ruling over this part of the earth he's
[35:10] staking his claim Satan has held this
[35:12] earth for so long but Satan has to give
[35:15] way and Satan would come to to tempt
[35:18] that portion of the earth amen and now
[35:21] that now this earth is encased in a body
[35:23] a man in the skin of the Lord Jesus
[35:26] Christ and as this earth is he takes of
[35:29] this fruit here and this fruit here and
[35:31] he eats this and it becomes down on the
[35:34] inside and the DNA on the inside has
[35:36] taken this I'm gonna take some of this
[35:38] I'm gonna take some of this he's drawing
[35:40] it to himself and drawing it to himself
[35:42] when it comes in cased upon inside the
[35:45] skin of the Lord Jesus Christ God is
[35:47] drawing a part of the earth to be ready
[35:50] he's drawing a part of the earth to be
[35:52] redeemed and so as I do and all of a
[35:54] sudden son one day the Holy Spirit comes
[35:57] down like a dove from God out of heaven
[35:59] and a voice rings out this is my beloved
[36:03] Son in whom I am well pleased hear ye
[36:05] him and you know Aaron everybody was
[36:08] commanded listen to my son listen to him
[36:11] listen to what he has to say hear ye him
[36:14] he was being placed he was being adopted
[36:16] he was being placed upon the earth this
[36:19] portion of the earth has sealed it is
[36:22] this is mine
[36:23] I have claimed it and what did he and
[36:25] what it Satan do why did the men of the
[36:27] earth do they rejected it this very
[36:30] earth that Satan had worked so hard to
[36:33] claim for himself to to rich the earth
[36:37] away from the grasp of God
[36:38] to pollute it with his own action and
[36:41] then he took a very portion of the earth
[36:43] and he rejected and says we don't want
[36:44] this we don't want this we don't want
[36:47] this and he anointed the Pharisees and
[36:50] the Sadducees God's own people and and
[36:52] they looked at him and says we don't
[36:53] want this we don't want this and they
[36:55] took this body of the earth and they
[36:57] place it and they lift it up and place
[36:58] it up on the cross amen he hung there
[37:02] between heaven and earth placed up there
[37:04] in the space we rejected a man saying we
[37:07] don't want this earth anymore and Satan
[37:10] sign away his rights says we don't want
[37:13] this anymore
[37:14] ain't it and you basically take this
[37:17] back we don't want it and this part of
[37:20] the earth and God says I will take that
[37:21] back and it was redeemed and he and what
[37:24] does it do it just like Joshua just like
[37:27] Joshua said me the Lord told Joshua
[37:29] everywhere the soles of your feet go is
[37:32] possession everywhere the soles of your
[37:35] feet go where you go if you step here
[37:38] it's yours if you step here it's yours
[37:41] if you step here it's yours
[37:43] every little bit was possession
[37:45] possession of the land and so now Joshua
[37:48] the new Joshua Jesus Christ the word the
[37:51] name Jesus is the old Hebrew Joshua
[37:55] Jehovah saves Jehovah is saving his
[37:58] people through this body of flesh when
[38:01] Christ came down in tabernacle and man
[38:03] and what's he doing everywhere he steps
[38:05] his possession when he met the woman in
[38:07] the well he possession when he met this
[38:10] one here possession he grabbed the
[38:11] twelve the eleven there he possessed
[38:13] them amen and I want to put de Pentecost
[38:16] he possessed him
[38:17] hey where'd he go from there he went
[38:18] down to the gates of hell he possessed
[38:21] the gates of Hell a bit where to go to
[38:23] paradise he possessed all the saints
[38:25] that were there
[38:25] it went up to heaven and he possessed
[38:27] there he walked the land he says I'm
[38:28] claiming this he walked over power all
[38:30] over Palestine I'm claiming this land
[38:32] I'm going to prepare a place and it's
[38:35] gonna come down and land right here and
[38:37] I'm walking just like Abraham walked so
[38:40] Christ walked in the same land in faith
[38:42] saying I am claiming this for the
[38:44] kingdom of God for my kingdom
[38:46] amen where I'm going they told the
[38:49] sciples they said oh is the kingdom of
[38:51] heaven coming he says
[38:52] doesn't come with observation but don't
[38:54] you worry don't you fear I am going to
[38:57] prepare a place for you and I will come
[38:59] again and I will receive you a man he
[39:02] wasn't gone but more in 60 years and all
[39:04] son John was Milan to Patmos
[39:06] they've been preaching the Word of God
[39:08] and preaching the Word of God and you
[39:10] know he's getting old and getting old
[39:12] and getting old and nine years old and
[39:14] still preaching the gospel and our Lord
[39:17] says don't you worry don't you fear I
[39:19] have I had the place that you have
[39:21] prepared a place I've gone prepare for
[39:23] you it will come down like a bride
[39:25] prepare from God out of heaven but think
[39:28] it is when it comes out we will be
[39:29] prepared the same way that the city was
[39:32] preparing amen why because Christ is
[39:36] going to have a bride that thinks like
[39:38] he thinks acts like he acts loves like
[39:42] he loves she'll be prepared
[39:45] why for her husband the Bible says that
[39:47] that city who came down from God out of
[39:50] heaven was adorned for her husband
[39:54] it says she was a door of the city was
[39:57] adorned like a bride was adorned for her
[39:59] husband she was not adorned for any
[40:02] other man she was not she was not closed
[40:04] for anything else
[40:06] she wasn't clothed for the the heathen
[40:08] she wasn't clothed for other men to look
[40:10] at she was adorned for one thing for her
[40:13] husband a man essaouira we we are
[40:15] adorned for one thing our husband every
[40:18] attribute that God is placing down on
[40:20] the inside he's placing it there for
[40:22] himself why so that we might be in a
[40:24] condition a man to be a betrothed unto
[40:29] Him amen that's why the Holy Spirit
[40:31] keeps ruling us and wooing us and woo
[40:34] yes amen that's why he at least when we
[40:36] do something wrong he convicts us it's
[40:39] not that he wants to cast us aside no he
[40:41] wants us to make the thing right so he
[40:43] can look like him Amen so we're looking
[40:45] like him more and more going from the
[40:47] negative to the positive
[40:50] amen amen
[40:54] think about it you know you go to the
[40:56] forest you see a perfect tree you're
[40:58] seeing oak tree that's out in the middle
[40:59] of a field as branches are just going
[41:03] way out way out way out and it's
[41:05] beautiful
[41:06] you know I heard I heard a long time ago
[41:08] that uh that the scientists can go
[41:13] through a forest here in Iowa Iowa used
[41:16] to be all Prairie 150 years ago it was
[41:19] just Prairie and and the men came down
[41:22] and we tore up all the prairies and
[41:24] playing in crops and and then some
[41:26] places forests grew where it used to be
[41:28] Prairie and and they had Oaks in the
[41:30] Prairie and every once while they were
[41:33] just scattered one here and one there
[41:34] one there and the scientists can go to a
[41:38] to a place and if they see hope it's 150
[41:41] 200 years old they can tell they grew up
[41:43] in a prairie even though now it might be
[41:46] in a forest because they can see that
[41:48] branches are schooling straight out way
[41:50] way out well it was encumbered by the
[41:53] surrounding trees when it grew up and
[41:56] it's and they can say this tree grew up
[41:59] way back when Iowa is just Prairie and
[42:01] now it's been encroached with all the
[42:04] trees around it but it wasn't originally
[42:05] as designed to be in a Prairie a man and
[42:08] you see the trees that when they're the
[42:10] most beautiful you know they're they're
[42:12] doing exactly what their DNA down on the
[42:14] inside said they should look like a man
[42:17] you know and the oak tree was not around
[42:19] here wasn't designed to be pinned up
[42:20] around all the other trees it was
[42:22] designed to live by itself alone and to
[42:26] be the Sentinel you know upon the
[42:27] prairies and amen and you own where does
[42:30] a tree look most beautiful isn't when
[42:32] it's a seat there's when it's when it's
[42:35] growing up as a there's just a sprout or
[42:37] is it when it's fully grown when it's
[42:41] fully grown when it's coming up into the
[42:43] majesty of what it's supposed to be a
[42:46] man so is the Bride of Christ we're
[42:49] we're we're at our most beautiful crisis
[42:53] come back for a beautiful bride and the
[42:56] bride was most beautiful and she's fully
[42:58] formed when she has all the attributes
[43:00] amen they're supposed to be there
[43:02] everything that the spiritual DNA said
[43:05] we were supposed to have amen the but
[43:07] when the DNA says were supposed to be
[43:09] patient we're supposed to be kind to one
[43:11] another we're supposed to think like God
[43:13] thinks we're supposed to take the Bible
[43:15] and say you know this is what the Bible
[43:18] says walk
[43:19] in it amen and that's that's when we are
[43:22] at her best is not when we're taking the
[43:24] words of man a man not when we're taking
[43:26] the temptation of the devil
[43:28] but when we were walking forth in the
[43:30] power of the Almighty God a man think
[43:33] about it when John was there on the Isle
[43:35] of Patmos and the angel came down and
[43:38] says come here I want to show you
[43:39] something
[43:40] what was he doing the angel wanted to
[43:42] brag about something think about it the
[43:45] britannians wanted to show something off
[43:47] I've shown you loss I showed you a lot
[43:49] of things John but now I want to show
[43:50] you something that's really amazing
[43:52] something that's really you you're gonna
[43:54] love this John I want to show you
[43:56] something come look he says I look and I
[43:57] saw a holy city coming down a door and
[44:01] like a bride was adorned for her husband
[44:03] anyway he says look it's a great city he
[44:07] starts using always act as you just
[44:08] described it's a great city it's it's
[44:11] holiness it's got all the holiness of
[44:13] God it said its it has a light about it
[44:16] that's like a precious stone like a
[44:17] light coming off of a diamond a man has
[44:20] it says is full of all the glory of God
[44:23] why was it why was it so glorious
[44:25] because all the attributes of Christ
[44:27] were being displayed all about her all
[44:31] about her every attribute in its place
[44:33] everything was placed exactly where
[44:36] we're supposed to be amen same thing
[44:39] with the building of a pyramid
[44:40] you know when the stones are down there
[44:43] at the quarry are they beautiful when
[44:45] they're there not so much when they're
[44:49] and when they when they're coming up
[44:50] here and they're being shaped are they
[44:51] beautiful they're not so much but it's
[44:53] when they get placed when they get
[44:56] placed where they're supposed to be then
[44:59] they begin to have the glory of the
[45:01] designer upon it amen the glory of that
[45:03] divine architect when the divine
[45:05] architect has plate said this is where
[45:08] that stone is supposed to be shaped like
[45:10] this and this is where it's supposed to
[45:12] be placed and when that stone gets to
[45:14] its final place then that's when its
[45:17] most glorious amen and we are designed
[45:20] to be placed somewhere a man that's what
[45:23] we're talking about adoption now where
[45:25] there's a place that we're supposed to
[45:27] be all of us have a place in the body
[45:30] that we are supposed to be and until we
[45:32] get to that
[45:33] we cannot show forth the glory of God
[45:36] amen we are supposed to show forth the
[45:39] glory of our Creator the glory of that
[45:41] divine architect that has the divine
[45:45] blueprints that he has the idea that
[45:48] from way back before the foundation of
[45:50] the world when he designed the earth he
[45:53] designed the people he designed
[45:55] everything this is where they're
[45:56] supposed to be placed this is what
[45:57] they're supposed to do and when we go
[45:59] forth we can go forth out of here
[46:01] walking through a sin dwelt land but
[46:04] fulfilling the will of God think about
[46:08] that think about that we can walk
[46:11] through a city Oh what you imagine this
[46:17] look at this the way I'm looking at it
[46:19] if you could take two completely
[46:22] different two completely different
[46:26] playing fields two dimensions and you
[46:30] have the dimension here that is full of
[46:32] sin and unbelief and things are moving
[46:35] around and evil spirits going this way
[46:37] and that way and and men doing wicked
[46:39] things and I need transpose another
[46:43] dimension on top of it there's full of
[46:45] holiness and righteousness and the power
[46:47] of the Almighty God and angels going
[46:50] here and there and the the Bride of
[46:52] Christ doing this and that and you can
[46:55] begin to see how Christ could walk
[46:57] through walls and do different things
[46:59] why because he was in this dimension
[47:01] that was there was there was there was a
[47:03] godly who wasn't necessarily in the
[47:06] dimension he wasn't bound to the
[47:08] dimension of sin he was bound to the
[47:10] dimension of heaven and heaven an earth
[47:12] where we're mixing they're coming in
[47:15] that in the same plane the one was
[47:17] transposed upon the other so is the
[47:19] Bride of Christ we're not supposed to be
[47:21] dwelling in this dimension here we're
[47:23] supposed to be sitting in heavenly
[47:24] places we're going more from the
[47:27] negative to the positive a man as we
[47:29] walked through we're walking through
[47:31] this sin sin born land but we're not of
[47:34] this sin born land or of this other
[47:37] dimension that's that's blending into
[47:39] Earth amen and as we walk here walk
[47:42] there we're not walking according to the
[47:44] blueprint of this we're walking
[47:46] according to the blueprint
[47:47] ayman as we become more in tune with
[47:49] this people say that's a strange guy why
[47:54] does he do this why does he do that why
[47:57] is this person acting like this why is
[47:58] this person acting like that because
[48:00] he's acting like what's written in here
[48:03] amen he's from another dimension he's
[48:06] acting according to what is being
[48:08] transposed over here and people like why
[48:10] do you do this why do you that I do this
[48:12] for the glory and honor of Lord Jesus
[48:15] Christ I do this in the name of the
[48:18] kingdom that I serve I'm not from this
[48:20] earthly kingdom I'm from the heavenly
[48:22] kingdom and I am acting according to its
[48:24] laws and according to its rules I'm
[48:27] acting according to the law of faith I'm
[48:29] acting according to the law of virtue
[48:31] I'm acting according to the law of
[48:33] heavenly knowledge a man to know that
[48:35] God will always keep his word amen and I
[48:38] and I take that and win and when the
[48:40] thoughts of this dimension begin giving
[48:43] forth their word saying it has this
[48:45] person is sick it has to die
[48:47] we take forth this word and says there
[48:49] in the name of Jesus Christ he's healed
[48:51] a man when Satan comes brings horse to
[48:53] temptation you have to bow down to my
[48:56] temptation we come and forth with the
[48:58] word and we hear they walking in this
[49:00] over here and says we're like I bowed
[49:01] out into that temptation Amen why
[49:03] because we are more over here instead of
[49:06] over there be at the two dimensions are
[49:08] just right on top heaven isn't way up
[49:12] there is just heaven just over the
[49:14] doorpost amen amen and what do we do
[49:18] we're blending into we're going less
[49:21] from over there and more over there as
[49:23] we get as the things of world become
[49:25] strangely dim we get further further
[49:28] into Christ as you enter into the Holies
[49:31] of Holies and you're in that atmosphere
[49:32] a man is you're in that atmosphere now
[49:36] you begin to see things like Christ sees
[49:38] things Amen you know that we said you
[49:41] know a dog a man a dog marries a dog a
[49:45] horse marries a horse a man marries a
[49:49] man but if Christ has a bride what
[49:52] nature will she be and how does she get
[49:55] there but by the baptism of the Holy
[49:57] Ghost amen by the virtue of the Holy
[49:59] Spirit down on the inside
[50:00] and how do we form our hi we get our
[50:03] flesh to conform to that nature by
[50:05] entering into the Holies of Holies amen
[50:08] and that's the only way by spending the
[50:11] time in the presence we are changed from
[50:13] glory unto glory amen the God and me
[50:18] loves the God and you and you are so
[50:20] easy to love
[50:22] amen amen
[50:25] Christ walked upon this earth and he was
[50:28] rejected the word spoke from outside of
[50:31] him but every time that word spoke it
[50:33] was rejected it was rejected it was
[50:35] rejected over and over again the word
[50:38] rejected until they finally took the
[50:40] word and they hung it up on the cross
[50:41] and said we don't want this word anymore
[50:44] but we are standing here as emissaries
[50:48] of Christ as an ambassador or saying now
[50:51] we are in the same position we have
[50:53] taken the word down on the inside
[50:56] thy word is written upon to the tables
[50:58] of my heart and we are now being
[51:00] rejected by the earth and we were
[51:02] rejected and rejected and rejected and
[51:04] one of these days as we will leave this
[51:06] earth behind in a growl sure why because
[51:09] the earth says we don't want them
[51:10] anymore
[51:11] there will be so will be so so more like
[51:15] the word and so unlike the world that
[51:17] one of those days that the as they are
[51:19] receiving the mark of the beast
[51:21] we are receiving the mark of Christ amen
[51:24] one of these days we so much like Christ
[51:26] the God says watch you just walk on up
[51:29] here and like Enoch said as Wooper Enoch
[51:31] I knock had that perfect walk he walked
[51:34] with God he had the perfect testimony in
[51:36] Jude says he had this testimony that
[51:38] everything that he did
[51:39] he was pleasing to God and one of those
[51:42] days after 365 years Enoch was walking
[51:45] along and also he just started walking a
[51:47] little bit higher a little bit higher
[51:48] and all sign the Eagan Hawk was not why
[51:50] because God called him home a man so
[51:53] we'll be with the Bride of Christ that
[51:55] is we accept the Holy Ghost more and
[51:57] reject the world more that one of these
[52:00] days that heaven will cry why she just
[52:02] come on up home a man why don't you just
[52:04] come on up home I got to purify this
[52:07] earth so if my city can come down a man
[52:10] you don't have to be judged with the
[52:11] world and the great white throne
[52:12] judgment because you've already received
[52:14] judgment in the blood of the Lord Jesus
[52:16] Christ amen amen
[52:21] God manifested in the earth again you
[52:23] know in the flesh of us a man when we
[52:28] receive our adoption when the Holy
[52:30] Spirit descends down on us amen and we
[52:33] are placed where we're supposed to be
[52:35] we're building our pyramid we are
[52:38] building our heavenly city our Heavenly
[52:40] Mountain even as Caleb and Joshua Joshua
[52:43] they walk through the land the footsteps
[52:46] his possession and Kaila right there
[52:48] with him he says give me my Mountain
[52:50] so it was the Bride of Christ what'd she
[52:51] say give me my Mountain give it to me
[52:54] she says give me my faith give you my
[52:57] virtue give me my knowledge give me my
[52:59] temperance give me my patience my godly
[53:01] it's my brotherly kindness
[53:02] give me that divine love where Christ
[53:04] comes down and seals the whole thing off
[53:07] and what'd she say she says give it to
[53:09] me
[53:09] footsteps is possession I am claiming I
[53:12] need a little bit more faith floored I
[53:14] am claiming in this faith for the gospel
[53:16] of Lord Jesus Christ I am claiming
[53:18] everything every virtue you have why so
[53:21] I can be about my father's business amen
[53:25] what are you doing you're possessing the
[53:27] gates of the enemy amen everywhere you
[53:29] go your footsteps are possessing it Lord
[53:32] I'm claiming this for the Gospels sake
[53:34] amen every attribute of Christ if you'll
[53:36] give me Lord I am claiming it for the
[53:38] Gospels sake amen what would we do we'll
[53:42] be rejected in the earth a man through
[53:45] the fires of temptation then the Holy
[53:47] Spirit descends down like a go like a
[53:49] dove and Lord says this is my beloved
[53:54] son hear ye him amen that's why that's
[53:57] when your when your when your work when
[53:59] your signature on the cheque book that's
[54:02] when that's when when you can write out
[54:04] the checkbook
[54:04] why because Christ signed it with his
[54:06] own blood amen the city will match the
[54:09] occupants the righteous city bowl of the
[54:13] glory of God will be is created that way
[54:16] why because the city has to match the
[54:18] occupants amen I want you to think about
[54:22] it we here as americans we're proud of
[54:26] our Constitution
[54:27] you know we as Americans we think that's
[54:30] a it's an amazing document there's
[54:34] there's nothing else like it you know
[54:36] you take that that document they've
[54:38] spent millions of dollars just
[54:39] preserving that document
[54:41] building a special housing for it to sit
[54:43] in and then a special bomb-proof shelter
[54:46] around it you know and alright cuz they
[54:48] want to protect that document who we
[54:49] think it's a special thing whoever wrote
[54:52] all the men they wrote that we think
[54:53] that's that's printed all the the ideas
[54:56] are enshrined upon that that document in
[54:59] the Constitution of the United States
[55:02] but as good as that Constitution is you
[55:07] take a country that's full corruption
[55:10] and take and transpose the laws that are
[55:15] enshrined and that Constitution it and
[55:18] try to enforce upon that other country
[55:20] it'll never work it'll never work they
[55:25] can't work because the morals of the
[55:28] country are what make that work that
[55:32] that Constitution can have no effect
[55:34] unless the morals that give it power
[55:39] unless the spirit of the people I can
[55:42] give that Constitution power to
[55:45] transform their country so what is the
[55:47] what is more important the paper that is
[55:49] written fun or the morals or the the
[55:52] spirit of the people even so this book
[55:54] is is written and enshrined and people
[55:57] like oh you know we're gonna swear up on
[55:59] a stack of Bibles but and tell the
[56:01] morals that are written on here
[56:02] I tell the spirit the wrote that writes
[56:05] upon our own hearts then will be like a
[56:07] another country somewhere all full
[56:09] corruption then this can never can never
[56:12] transform the country can never
[56:15] transform the land but once free people
[56:19] are gonna submit themselves unto the
[56:21] rule of this law until the rule of the
[56:23] Holy Ghost
[56:24] until the spirit that that wrote this
[56:26] word and then submit themselves under
[56:28] that spirit then we begin to be changed
[56:31] amen because this book by itself can
[56:34] change no one Amen but if the spirit of
[56:37] this book because the descend a power
[56:40] person
[56:40] and begins ruling over them then a
[56:43] people can be transformed
[56:47] amen amen the city comes down from
[56:51] heaven like a dove to claim every
[56:54] attribute those in the earth God has
[56:59] placed his attributes he hasn't reserved
[57:01] unto himself every attribute that he for
[57:05] ordained that he predestinated before
[57:06] the foundation of the world the very
[57:08] reason he created this earth in the
[57:10] first place you know he didn't create
[57:12] this earth be there he created this
[57:15] earth that attributes of his own self
[57:17] could live and reign upon this earth and
[57:20] those attributes are a gift they are
[57:23] given to men and women that they might
[57:25] take those attributes and live them out
[57:27] upon this earth amen and we have the we
[57:30] we have the being predestinated to live
[57:34] out these attributes upon the earth
[57:36] amen and now we have an opportunity in
[57:38] the midst of this inborn world to act
[57:40] out these attributes now not to wait as
[57:43] I had a pastor to tell me once he says I
[57:47] don't believe adoption happen something
[57:49] happens as is as described in the Bible
[57:51] I don't believe that happens until we
[57:52] get up there he says that's that's for
[57:55] way up there I know there's something
[57:56] about it I just I don't have anything
[57:59] within me they can take these promises
[58:01] and place them somewhere else I just I
[58:04] just I claim them for myself even the
[58:08] rapture even the rapture I claim the
[58:11] rapture for myself I claim the second
[58:13] coming for myself I claim the Isle enter
[58:16] into his gates with Thanksgiving I only
[58:18] turn into his courts with praise I claim
[58:20] that for myself I claim the holiest of
[58:23] holies for myself I claim it for my for
[58:25] my privilege for my uses why because God
[58:28] has allowed me to wife does he place an
[58:30] ask you down on the insight that must be
[58:32] manifested and that attribute must find
[58:35] its place because it will not be
[58:37] attractive until it finds its place it
[58:40] will not fulfill its purpose until it
[58:42] finds its place but God's gifts always
[58:44] find their places amen all every stone
[58:47] will find its place when it's placed
[58:49] exactly where it belongs
[58:51] amen amen amen amen what do we do we end
[58:58] up typing out the city what are we doing
[59:01] we're fulfilling our portion down here
[59:03] so that lid is up there enjoying with
[59:07] what's down here amen
[59:09] so what will be United heaven on earth
[59:11] will be night once again a man's blood
[59:13] ran says heaven and earth has kissed
[59:15] amen they as a husband Brian they've
[59:19] come together at one amen that attribute
[59:22] up there marries with this down here
[59:25] amen from the negative to the positive
[59:27] amen that's how that's how men walk
[59:30] through walls that's how men walk
[59:31] through doors that's how that's how
[59:33] these things happen that's how the
[59:35] supernatural happens why because this
[59:38] over here blends with this over here why
[59:41] because that which was rejected the part
[59:44] of the earth that was rejected by Satan
[59:46] when he said I don't want this part of
[59:49] the earth he gave up his rights Satan
[59:53] gave up his rights when he hung that
[59:55] upon the cross we hung Christ upon the
[59:57] cross he was giving up his rights we
[59:59] don't want this we don't want any part
[1:00:01] of this
[1:00:02] and so God out of that body out of out
[1:00:05] of that is creating and molding our
[1:00:08] people for his name's sake I go to
[1:00:10] prepare a place for you he said Amen and
[1:00:13] out of that was he doing he prepares a
[1:00:14] place for him on himself a man a man a
[1:00:19] bride he is created just like just like
[1:00:22] Adam and Eve out of Christ was pulled
[1:00:25] out e for his own self and then that
[1:00:28] which was pulled out was joined back
[1:00:30] together and the two became one flesh
[1:00:32] and what God has joined together let not
[1:00:35] man let not man put asunder and even so
[1:00:39] what Christ has joined us to himself by
[1:00:41] the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:00:43] no man can't put asunder why it's a
[1:00:46] marriage relationship were bound
[1:00:47] together Amen by the true baptism of the
[1:00:50] Holy Ghost
[1:00:52] amen amen the rejected earth and Christ
[1:00:57] was rejected Amen of the sin born earth
[1:00:59] we were rejected because we were in him
[1:01:01] a man when you count yourself in him and
[1:01:04] you're no longer part of the sin Boehner
[1:01:06] Amen Europe heavenly places amen and
[1:01:10] then the city comes down what is he
[1:01:11] doing he cleanses the whole city is the
[1:01:14] sin wasn't made for Satan so he cleanses
[1:01:16] that all wipes it all off
[1:01:18] restores it and brings this city back
