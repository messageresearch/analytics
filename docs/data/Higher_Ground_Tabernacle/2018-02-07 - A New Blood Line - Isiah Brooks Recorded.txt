[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Hey what an appropriate song in a probe in appropriate hour second Corinthians 5:17 we thank God for his amazing grace appreciate the Lord for being so gracious and so good to us like they say he has been better to me than I've been to myself yes he's taking really good care of me can I get a witness I love that second Corinthians 5:17 amen OOP mercy therefore if any man be in Christ he is a new creature old things are passed away behold all things are become new let us pray father we thank you for your amazing grace you've been so good to us you open your word to us when we don't even deserve it but Lord and all that you do show us it means nothing unless divine love abides in our souls because you said if a man could have faith to move mountains Lord he can give his body to be sacrificed he can give food to the poor but all these things avail nothing Lord if if we don't have that charity which is your divine love father we didn't come law tonight to be religious those things come nowadays a dime a dozen but father there are those whom you left here on earth to be a witness in this wicked world you have left us O God as a standard and father we want to be that standard but we understand also Lord the principles of your laws that no man can add one cubit to a statue we understand Lord it's not him that will it nor he that runneth but Lord you that shows mercy and father God we come before your Lord and we're saying be merciful let your grace reign in our lives and father we are depending on you to bring us to perfection we give you our will we give you our desires and I will in our desires Lord is to be just like you so Lord we pray tonight have your perfect way in our lives do what is necessary lujah that you might be glorified in this wicked generation in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated I told you not long ago that have been working on a thought and that thought is a new bloodline and I I thought about many of the things that I dread concerning blood and you know a lot of times you can't get away from blood except you be born again we know that blood is the life system it is the the thing that runs through your body that keeps you alive without blood you're just dead and you and I must understand that blood is is it's precious in the eyes of God because we realized that it was the shedding of blood that actually got us in this situation that we're in now we've realized a man that Adam's blood was made and created in the beginning by God and there was no contaminants in it there was nothing that could stop him from from living forever except breaking in the word and when he mixed himself the way he did we could say the germ of death entered into Adam and Eve and from that day along we have taken a shape in form of a dead man because the Bible says you know you did why are you living when you live in pleasure and from that time all men began to live in pleasure and they began to love pleasure more than they love God the Bible tells us that death reigned from Adam all the way up to Moses and all the way up into Jesus Christ it was Jesus Christ who broke the chain he was the one that made the difference that's why that his blood could not be part human his blood could not be part of Mary's or Joseph gene the gene genes we realized a man that God himself had to create a blood and the Bible said that blood was the blood of God and because it said it was the blood of God it was being in that God hid himself in those elements that we can see that we call blood there was no power in the color of it but there was a life that was in it they gave the blood of Jesus the power that it is and has now when we know we know by God's grace that Adam made us sinners Bobby said it is appointed for man to die once and after the death judgment but thank God that God made an escape Jesus Christ blood was proven according to brother Branham he got sick and certain things happened to him like it would any ordinary man but you better believe that every time the devil would strike him with something his blood repelled it kicked it out kicked it off there was not one thing that Satan could put on Jesus body that could hold no disease he wasn't afraid of disease he wasn't afraid of leprosy he wasn't afraid of any kind of disease you know epilepsy and all of these things he faced those Devils never one time will you find a devil trying to enter Jesus because he was God that devil knew that he had no place in him is that right because Jesus says I have no darkness in me I love that that thrills me now we must realize by God's grace that according to Revelation that Jesus Christ was the beginning of God's creation or the creation of God that means that means that God found himself a body or created himself about it and this body was not as I said earlier made of part Joseph and part Mary or not even part Mary everything about that body was created by God and what God did he used Mary as the first incubator amen she was ordained as the incubator as a as an instrument to feed that natural body of God but none of Jesus blood had met not one ounce of Mary's blood in it not one ounce of Joseph's blood Oh was God the blood of Jesus a lot of people don't eat retorted enough because somehow they think that the blood has lost its power but here tonight I'm saying the blood could never lose his power we many times thought that blood was like an ointment something they could rub on you and you healed or it would bring healing but that wasn't what the blood was about Jesus came to do what to bring a new kingdom and to bring a new Kingdom people this kingdom people would be a holy people a righteous people a sanctified people this this kingdom would be a people that God Himself would recreate that's what we fail to see we we understand that there is no chemical blood now that we can gather up from from that Jesus dropped on oak every there's nothing and if we had it what good would he do you it would be just like a relic because it wasn't the chemistry that was so important it was the life that was in that chemistry because remember Jesus was a man he could feel he could cry he could hurt he could get tired he had to sleep but the Bible said in him dwelt the fullness of the Godhead bodily he came to deliver something to us you know hear me he came to deliver something to us the world don't know what it's all about you all know that's the truth we always think oh I'm washed in the blood but God just didn't come to wash you washing is part of the process but that's not the finished work we understand that if a person is justified as the example our prophet gave us it's a man walking down the street and he sees a dirty glass he picks up that glass the glass doesn't deserve to be picked up his dirty is filthy but he somehow at Mars and glass oh he likes the glass he picks it up and think oh I can use this well the man doesn't just automatically drinks out of the grass he goes home and he washes the glass that's that's that's just what that's the second stage of his grace his first grace first part of his grace he picked the grant glance up and he justified it the second portion of that is that he sanctified it hallelujah but you know he didn't just bring that glass to his house to decorate his cabinet no he picked it up he admired it he brought it home he washed it and one day he's going to feel it but whatever he wants to feel it with that's the beauty of the glass and every time he could always think about where he found that glass and that glass is so valuable to him and now that he's drinking out of it he's having pleasure and you must understand that God didn't just pick you up out of the muck Amari that's not all to it he didn't just say defy you that's not all to it but there's another thing that God is trying to get to us as believers we don't continue we must not continue our lives living according to our natural birth why because the blood that we had now is no longer a natural blood your hymning and this thing must come by faith because amen I want you to understand in order for us to be like Jesus we must have his blood every Apple whatever it may be uh you know whatever kind of Apple it may be it may be a Grammy or whatever they call him it may be a honey Chris but you know each life in that Apple has different characteristics about it and the blood of Jesus Christ has characteristics the blood of Jesus Christ can can't do anything that life in that blood was not the second or third person that life in the blood was God himself tell me what I'm saying oh my Galatians says in the sixth chapter for in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth anything nor uncircumcision but a new creature right oh oh I'm circumcised I'm part of the Jew you know because I'm circumcised on the eighth day that natural stuff don't mean nothing I've been born in a Levitical priesthood that don't mean a thing not today the question is the thing that makes the difference is what he's Jesus said to Nicodemus you must be born again because this birth I'm talking about is far above this natural birth one bird that he said you said he said he said a born of the water and the spirit understand the bird that you have now you came into this world he said that's a fleshly birth but you must have a spiritual birth hallelujah you've heard me say this at times you know when you see somebody you know they they drunk or whatever the case may be it's because they they they're they have become intoxicated with with whether were wine or alcohol whatever they got in them and whatever spirit that skin that chemistry makes you act like it you're no longer yourself you what you're drinking that spirit in and you drank that spirit in and you and that spirit becomes one when people see you drunk they don't see all that old drunken spirit they say he's drunk he's a drunkard you take the name of that spirit who who and you and I must understand that the blood of Jesus Christ is a new line of blood it is a perfect blood that brings a perfect life it is a blood that brings holiness you know here what I'm saying it's like you hear people say well I know I've been changed and the things I used to do I don't do no more the places I used to go I don't go no more the songs are used to sing I don't sing them no more why because the blood transforms you as many as walk according to this rule peace be on to them and mercy upon the Israel of God who and Israel as a prince we're due to the Prince of God when you'll you and I see that brother Brantley said when you come to God really come to God God gives you a blood transfusion I love that and and I looked up blood transfusion it means to the injection of a blood from one person or animal into a bloodstream of another so God inoculates you by placing his blood in you hallelujah as we say I'm a child of the king his royal blood now flows through my veins oh yes oh yes I want the devil to hear this oh yes oh yes I'm a child of the king but because he gave me birth hallelujah Jude says that's what I love this dude under student he had to understand something because he says now unto him that is able to keep you from what falling and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy you know I preach this myself you know many times I thought well you know you got a really a good knife before God you got a bad God you got a plead with God brother Branham said in the interval you don't have to beg and you don't have to please you don't have to fast you know God requires from you st. everybody back might know how to plea everybody may not know how to beg everybody may not know how to fast but one thing for sure God gives you the faith y'all understand me and I thought to myself I'm gonna correct that thing because I saw something that I've been using ever since I listened to that message I've been just drinking and drinking and drinking and drinking and I over drink so I can push out and when you all the drink and you over drink and you eat that word and take that word in you don't have to worry about it it will work it will do the job for you it is when you don't eat the word is when you don't drink it's what makes you all fruit your understanding it's like a flower that needs water you don't water that flower like it ought to be that flower is going to wither up bro my if you give that flower the proper amount of water it looks healthy and fat greening and nothing you know is the water that made it that way understand it's the water of the world that makes you fat in green but you got to apply this word to your life that's what the prophet of God means laying in the presence of the Sun not s you in s all in lay there eat it every day all day if you can keep it in your ear keep it in your mind as much as possible feed on this bloody word of the Son of Man and guarantee you in a bring new life is that right because the Bible said Jesus said it he said if any man eat a vineyard spread he shall never die hallelujah see that's what it's all about it was faith in the beginning he's got to come back his faith understand that the gift of the Holy Ghost is a gift it's already given to you but the only way you can have it is you've got to accept it just take it by faith and rest on it that's what brings the joy y'all know that it's when you rest on the promises of God that's where the joy comes in oh you made a mistake but I'm resting those promises see what I'm saying God said so hallelujah and that's what you and I must understand this new bloodline literally change your way of thinking hallelujah y'all remember the thought the probably God brought about this old man for bomb that got hit by a car and the ambulance people were talking and they said well we'll just work or do something over here he you know in other words he ain't no good and the old man said I am Jesus blood washed basically hearing of no value I am valuable I don't care I'm a poor fella in a ditch somewhere I am valuable because the blood of Jesus Christ purchased me hallelujah you think about you think about uh-uh Lazarus I think about him I loved Lazarus the one who was at time the rich man table I want to talk to him I really do I just have a desire to talk to him to see how it was and you know what made him keep the faith when he didn't have nothing he kept the faith you know what it was it was the blood he said well the blood of Jesus Christ had not been shared yeah yes it was the blood was shared before the foundation of the world that's why I either everybody when they got grace God was pulling from the beginning a name written on the Lamb's Book of Life is that right think about a Jude God is able so he says now to him that is able to keep you from falling in to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceedingly jaw how can God present you faultless it's not your work you and I can't we don't even know what perfection is we were born so faulty in this world everything we do we fall we fall short but the blood of Jesus that's how he present you faultless but placing his life in you and the Bible said we are accepted in the beloved because he injected his blood in you and when we think about his blood we're not talking about that element of red stuff we're talking about life because that's what the Holy Ghost is the Holy Ghost is God hallelujah that's why Jesus even said how he raised from the dead he said but ye shall receive power after which the Holy Ghost is come upon you when I was a little boy one of those little cartoons i used to love popeye and need you to have popeye with that can of spinach it would get all beat up and what Brutus or whoever was his name I just call him Pluto but Brit Brutus used to beat him up and throw him down and slap him all around throw a little bit into the wall and somehow his armies distress wherever that can of of spinach was somehow that they find a way of getting to that spinach and cutting that can opening it all my watch out Brutus after he ate that spinach he became super strong hallelujah I think they got that from somewhere hallelujah Oh glory to God but Peter said no today I'm gonna go after which the Holy Ghost is come upon you you shall receive power understand when God gives you the Holy Ghost he's giving you himself God is not a weak God is not weak that's why he said when you say I am weak or when you are weak say that I am strong right why because God is in you hallelujah have you feeling a little beat up you need to go get you some spinach hallelujah peel it all up I guarantee you by the time you finish reading the word many times I didn't even know what to read I said Lord give me a scripture I need something you know I tell him I need some encouragement and he'll lead me right to the world that's gonna encourage me hallelujah is that Alright Oh my cheek what the devil don't he's exposed what the Bible doesn't say is that on the day of Pentecost when those 12 120 received the Holy Ghost it scared the devil to death hallelujah he understood he saw something that he had never through all history seen a hundred and twenty people acting like Jesus of Nazareth doing the same size the same wonders they have the same boldness they had the same fearless and now his kingdom is really through hmm and you and I must understand by God's grace that if you can see the blood of Jesus in you uh uh you know this thought came to me long time ago I believe Keith was telling me something how he got sick and how he rested on the blood of Jesus and you know and I it just in depth it just stuck it's just laid there just that thought but I couldn't I couldn't do nothing with it at the time until now and when you see by God's grace I don't like calling people out but sometimes it's it encourages people you know just like we was out at the Starbucks and God gave me that thought on Resurrection just by the brothers talking several brothers Richard all all y'all I love talking about the word because I get inspired I get inspired thoughts come to me while we're talking about that whew that's sounds good I'm gonna use that one but the devil is exposed if you can really believe that the blood of Jesus Christ is in you you will become a powerhouse it will take away the fear oh I got some days I'm finna read in just a moment in the message prayer line or a prayer line brother brother said you're exposed he's talking to the devil you can't stay here any longer with faith why faith moves everything right you can't stay here any longer why because faith moves everything come out of them in the name of Jesus Christ lead these people they come to carry by faith for a blood transfusion come out in the name of Jesus Christ I pronounced him well now how could he do that that wasn't a man that was God in the man but that wasn't just for brother battle these signs shall follow they should cast out Devils in my name if the blood of Jesus that the Holy Ghost is in you like it was enlarger and it's supposed to be and we are supposed to have a double portion it's not by emotions folks is by faith it's all right to have emotions I love it but with a win-win when you can't muster up any emotions you got to be steadfast in your soul right look what Deuteronomy says thou shalt be perfect with the LORD thy God Deuteronomy 18 13 - I'll be perfect with the LORD thy God hello if Jesus could give birth which he does if he is a perfect man the only thing he could ever produce a perfect child ha because he doesn't mate with anything that's not perfect you say what are you saying that's why he gave you a speed in the beginning and that seed he gave you in your soul is perfect is that right because the Bible said as long as that seer amazing you you cannot sin don't you know that's the only way that a devil can hold to you if you're sick or got an affliction or whether the case maybe if you haven't seen Satan has no right oh we don't care about hereditary Devils hereditary Devils don't mean nothing wants the blood of Jesus come ah because you've got to die before you can get his blood you died to that old generic thing genealogy is what I mean you died to that at least we supposed to look what he says you are standing completely justified as though you never did it in the beginning this is my message to the church I love that you don't read it before but I'm a reader of the game as we go off the air just a minute a minute you are standing if you're standing on God's Word and with God's Word every Amen every jot every tittle where you're standing I'm trying to tell you pull away from them shucks and get out here in the wheat where you can get right before the Sun I hear that come by the coming of the combine and you're spending complete justified like you never did it in the first place talking about a Thanksgiving I feel real good I'm more thankful for that they anything I know he goes on to say can y'all believe this now I believe it you see what brother books I make mistake I believe just what he said you pure virtuous sinless bride of the son of the Living God every man and woman that's born of the Spirit of God and washed in the blood of Jesus Christ and believe every word of God stands as though you've never seen at the first plane you are perfect that's the blood of Jesus Christ see we didn't realize what the Holy Ghost we thought the Holy Ghost hey just shouting and dancing I love it all oh God but it came to transform us it came to change us it came to create a new life in us it must do that if it's a genuine Holy Ghost now let me tell you something it will take his time to do what he wants to do a tree don't grow in a day another that neither does a flower come up and bloom in a day y'all hear what I'm saying God uses time he uses storms he used the elements of this world to fashion you guess when he calls it fire oh it is okay it is okay don't y'all realize this thing James said this life is like a vapor it comes out it goes hallelujah is that Alright give me my hard times now that I might live with him eternally the Word of God said the suffering of this world cannot be compared to the things that God has in store for us just you ought to be grateful that God chose you to give his life - sometimes we wear ourselves out serving each other but that's alright brother well said divine life or perfect love a menace is what living living for others it's okay hmm hello it's okay oh hey the probably God said don't you want a blood transfusion for both souls and both body tonight young man I hope y'all don't mind me using this but I mother Connelly hope you don't he I make him a comforter I'm sure I do when I call anybody's name but our soul I went on that day when Joel got sick and he went on the battlefield he just went there and started doing things nobody asked him for the colony he just went there and I'm right I thought about it almost all night I said here was that old man never a senior man he said he never thought about it he just got about his chair and just started working I watched him I didn't have to say what is there somebody in here that would help clean no he immediately why he was ordained a little hard for me and then I'm y'all know how that night was but my point is everybody has a place and everybody knows that each and every one of us can do things that others can't do hmm and you know you look at Sisters Chapel she's a nurse ER I don't know sister whatever she is I couldn't do that honestly I could have the brain to do it I could learn it but to do it when I go into a hospital I feel something strange I do if I see somebody tied down I feel like I'm dying something happened to me that's why you know just I know I can't do it but my son can do it understand me now I'm saying this to say all of this the Holy Ghost in you and the Holy Ghost in me are going to be will perform certain things different things right some of us may have faith just to speak it and it happens some of us have certain faith amen say Holy Ghost but God just gave you a certain measure you just need somebody to lay hands huh it's the same Holy Ghost it doesn't mean that one is stronger than the other it just means one has law a greater portion and I don't get jealous of it you understand me if you gonna run the ball I'm gonna block for you but the blood of Jesus Christ supposed to make us one family one family hallelujah is that Alright brother battle tried to explain that he said one of his brothers they had blond hair one had black hair and one but they had all the same hair same blood mmm very one daddy y'all understand me and the blood of Jesus Christ will make you love one another that's what John said John said I shouldn't have to teach you how to love but because God is love how can the love of God be on our hearts that God was telling my wife today I think I was talking to her I think I love gifts but that's just a small portion ask a child you know what they would probably want time fellowship come on hello that's what expresses love when you finish it when there is time given I was telling the brother here I said you know people nowadays and don't like making sacrifices hello we were so in this little thing and we supposed to have so much love but where is the sacrifice to fellowship with one another no come on somebody I'm talking about the bloodline that was one thing that Jesus was allowed to do and that was the fellowship with his disciples wherever he went they went there were time he had to get away but he loved that fellowship he was that right is that what brother Branham said he said even at the resurrection God will allow the saints of God to raise 30 to 40 days so that we can fellowship with one another before the resurrection before they're sent you hmm hello somebody you know how fellowship with some of y'all but I'm gonna tell you something I would grade this church close to an F when it comes to fellowship if I had to grade the whole church you're gonna love me in because we don't do enough of it ah I didn't mean to go there but I'm there I'm there that's what the blood makes you do right that's what the blood you do hallelujah you accept him as your Savior right now I believe you're standing in in his presence he said first of all don't you want a blood transfusion for both your soul and body tonight I'm free to come to something here because if you understand the blood that runs through your vein right now is invincible I don't care what the what the doctors give you like for existence they run something but you got a cancer what you talking about if the blood of Jesus is running through me that cancer has to go I'm gonna be some in just a minute you know I don't want any of the others think that I was an appreciative of all the gifts that y'all gave me the money and all that I thank God and that's not what I was talking about because most of you who gave me things we fellowship but I think this fellowship with the pastor is with others and you know and I say that I don't know what hold those got me going back to that but my point is we are one body and the scripture says that they will know you are Christians because of the love that you have one for the other Judah oh he goes on as he says listen you accept him and testified to those people that you now accept Christ as your Savior taking asking for mercy raise your hand and turn to the people come here dawn Jesus would give him a very transparent rent a trespass every sin god I pray that you heal the boy and make may he go out here and live a normal life be perfectly well forgive every sin and take him into the king of tonight in G it was so simple you know there was no dramatics behind it it was simple it wasn't all of the Hollywoods stuff that comes with it just simple that's how God works then alright psalms v 169 says behold desired to Theni in the parts and in the hidden part thou shalt make me to know wisdom purge me with hyssop and I shall be clean wash me and I shall be whiter than snow make me to hear joy and gladness that the bones which thou has broken may rejoice hard I faced high I faced from Steve and blot out all my iniquities created me a clean heart O God and renew a right spirit within me is that right the Prophet said listen to quip look how that God comes along and he gives you a new spirit and people think they got the Holy Spirit that new spirit is to give you enough grace to deal with your own self and to be able to hear the word hallelujah but that new spirit is just there so barking for his news his spirit in your new spirit must bring a change his Spirit will bring the pain a major she's not just an outward change or whatever and you'll know you know you know I know and you know that we are the elected and chosen by God so why don't we just move forward let's move forward I told you you don't have to beg him just ask him believe it when you ask him and move forward you don't have to feel the cheers you don't have to be on the wind no sir you just take his word by faith and move on don't look at the outside you may be faulty until Jesus come but one thing he said I will complete that which I have begun in you the blood will bring you to perfection you say what do you mean I'm telling you the Old Testament Saints die with the Holy Ghost only a bones hallelula and only they had law yet because of the grace of God without rest that's all I want if I should die go my gravelord sleep with me that makes sense rest on my bones those would be the happiest bones there in the grave I'm telling you that now whoo cast me not away from that present take not the Holy Spirit from me restore unto me the joy of that salvation and uphold me with thy free spirit whoo clean hot hallelujah not just clean me long but feel me I really out side of her neck you know God don't really want you know how can I say but I want to be I don't care people call me a fanatics but I need I need I need an ester jaw that where I am I'm gonna talk about Jesus I mean just not I'm not talking about that you know we do know I'm um just sometimes you you know we talking about the Lord you go you know we said oh did you see so and so on so don't let's say that like that seem like the volume drop you ever paid any attention to that you know what that is that's the spirit of shame or fear cuz we can talk about the Catholic Church all we want to hear loud and when we get to the restaurant you know those you know why because they fear the some Catholics will beat you some Baptists in some Pentecostals it's a message people will to y'all say why y'all pick on the Catholic Church and I don't pick just on the Catholic Church I've pickled her daughters too and you could be sitting right up in here and be a part of that steel because that's a system it's a spirit oh come on somebody because you go to a message church don't make you message honestly I sometimes hate using that term message Church because it almost sound denominational but we are the body of Christ and I'm telling you if you've been ordained to be a lickle you'll never be a dollar you'll never be a 50-cent you are nickel hallelujah but thank God I'm not a penny there's always something to praise oh I don't believe we've got nickels and dimes in here I don't believe it I'm just everybody the dollar it's okay with this just give me a few more minutes and I'll give them one heart hello that's a Zeki 11 and I would give them one heart them one heart you understand in other words you don't have a place your heart I don't have a place for my heart my heart was corrupt evil evil imaginations always flew would flow through my heart wicked I don't need my heart I need here I need a new one and if you put his spirit in your heart yoga heart becomes his heart he sets on the throne of your heart he rules he was not only your heart but you're here too now that's the power of the blood a lot of time the people think well the power the blood is here bar they just come to hear you counseling in and all that God came to give your Holy Ghost his life in you as I said a brain about a new generation oh come on somebody I said here eg he came to give himself a new generation hello his generation was he began what was it he was the beginning of the creation of God the beginning of the ph Staubach so where God is creating now this top in ooh yummy Oh father I would they said in my throne and I've said in your throne do you think there's a chair up there for all of us the steam it is a position it is the place only God and God's children in that throne hello God has given him a name which is above every name that at the name of Jesus Christ every Egypt bow and every tongue hallelujah and the same position God exalted him to God is exposing us to Paulina because he's giving it to us we don't deserve it we don't we didn't honored it was gone the chicken his life into us you don't believe that huh I'll tell you what when it comes down to the dust who'll be there the king and queen we will judge the whole world and Isaiah said even be nowhere forget you shall prosper I don't care if the devil comes with a list that long time he finishes unrolling it with fine blunt paper why because the blood of Jesus Christ is gonna wash every bit of it away no charge he said they do not know that he became the jury he became the judge he became the attorney and they found your case dismissed there was no charge against you being attached to you that they walk among statute and artists and do them and they shall be my people and I will be their God but as far as you see what was happening right you see the changing of the time you see the change in the position now it down Satan was the ruler of this world he's ruling everybody except God's people even now but we leave the only place bad will be will be in the Jews he would be when Satan is ruling this earth God will be here too but he'd be ruling the Jews there'll be the holy people because the Gentiles have turned it down [Music] God will never let Satan rule Israel and God will never let C rule you absolutely not but as whose heart walking at the heart of the detestable things and their abomination our way I can pinch their way upon their own hands said the Lord God let me taste them the only way you can live what I'm preaching is that you get the Holy Ghost you get guarding you and keep eating huh I have struggles I have problems but I see God moving moving them how to okay why because I'm keep I'm not I'm not trying them oh I'm just gonna eat let him bring the chain let him transform me and he devoted people I'm telling you he is doing it you said brothers everything I know I the God of the apartment nobody can take what he's giving away from me like they say came about if you live by Jesus don't that make you feel good you don't made all kind of you Israel he's ugly oh I'm gonna read this again so you get excited I then will I sprinkle clean water upon you and ye shall be clean from all your filthiness from all your idols will I cleanse you the water represents the spirit it is the Holy Spirit it is the anointing that destroyed the Oaks hallelujah not by my power not by might but by my spirit said Lord that's always a stop doing something there's the power that other than my love but when God does it he kills it he goes right to the root of it chop it down so it won't ever come back up again is that right when God got rid of Peters temper you never saw a spring up again he was the one right now buzz answer your faith virtue who he knew what it meant that could become in the statue in the image of God he knew he's so simple it's hard really it's really hard for us to comprehend it sometime but when you take a tree that tree just stands there y'all heard me say everything that that tree is supposed to be will be brought to a flirtation or manifestation by the weather and everything it goes through it needs to lightning because sometime the limbs get too big and the lightening need to come down and prune a little bit right it needs the wind the air it needs all of those things and that's why God said from now on you're gonna have four seasons I wish we could understand that a lot of time we think well we got four seasons I'm telling you what after you realize amen that you got the Holy Ghost as your warmth and your comforter you can be warm in the winter time you don't have to be cold in the wintertime if that tree finds a way to stay warm in the wintertime hallelujah what does that tree do go back to his roots hey somebody and once if you and I can go back to our roots I came from God I'd go back to God hallelujah I am invincible nothing could stop the mighty salvation of God hmm you think about it yeah you know you look at this thing look at all the prophecies God said men would be running to and fro increase with knowledge all these things you know what I'm saying and you think about how how powerful God is that he actually allowed men of science to develop certain things that would create the very atmosphere in the very scene the butchy but he saw the scene before the scene got here he saw every man he saw Big Ben Franklin and Ford and all of those who created all this stuff and he saw that they were all day to it if we could only understand I wish I look around to see all the faces that we got in it and all a different characteristic death characteristically enough faces it you know and just died but compared to the billions of people in this world and God hears every voice y'all I'm telling you this is the problem a lot of people think they have already mated potentially we have and we will but we need acknowledge I don't think God appreciate us being dilatory and just laying back well he's gonna do it Oh No Oh hallelujah you gonna do something better than said garden gonna just pull you through no home that doesn't make salvation fun but makes our babies in front if I say fun I don't know whether that's the right word or not durable enjoyable thing God tells you to do something you do it and you get this big result that's what's so mighty to me do things you don't even know what you get ready to get into hallelujah but once she bring you in are you - oh my God look at all this is all right he said do you believe now I'm jumping let me go she caught ya understand you can't have a full berth with just water you have to have water blood and spirit that constitutes a true birth that right justification sanctification baptism it only goes and you see what I will know I got it because your desires will change that's how you know I said your desires will change and your desires will always be to desire what God wants you to desire it doesn't mean the devil ain't gonna fight you with bad thoughts but if you've got a nice our new creature while you bringing that nasty stuff to me I've been altogether I'm a dub I don't eat like a crow no more I've been transformed I'm not a pig no more and I don't work with the slob be you gotta--you sometimes you've got to talk to yourself to me today and I said oh I know where you're going with that this what I did I turn my back to him I know he felt bad but who cares this is what I will do you damned oh oh [Laughter] I bust this bubble today but my boy he's got to see me change he's got to see you change hallelujah somehow I show me this is what Jesus gave to God his will and the Lord has shown me how give my wheel to him that's what has helped me simply becomes when Satan comes and he said lord I give my will to you boom he's on scene he changes it just that quick he does he will do it I don't want to do that that's you devil that's not my wheel don't come talking to my head right I'm born again oh I can't explain it I'm trying to but when you say God take my wheel he will come to tempt you like he did Jesus he says Lord not my will but thine be done and when you mean it get up for wherever you are move out of that place move from that position wherever you are just don't stand there you got to make let him know your body give him the body lane yeah I mean this is not what I'm going to do now I told her they were going through some stuff I said when you see that devil is seem to be getting the best of things by way of someone else move out of the atmosphere its first in that atmosphere you will be anointed with that and the next thing you know you're gonna engaged in that hallelujah let me go on I'm almost there are people almost done this is a prayer line you give you know when God gives you a blood transfusion this is what he says I can heal your back and make you well sister all right go right on thank God thank you Lord Jesus yep do you believe that I can do that that gives you a blood transfusion and take that sugar out and make you a real new person Oh blood transfusion do what take diabetes than you you believe that bless you go on your way do you believe God can take that tumor and make you well sister God can heal your arthritis straighten you back up make you well they talked about the blood I got injected a lot in you you say Oh Lord that's why the devil move when you can't say nothing else you say in the name of Jesus Christ and by the blood of Jesus Christ he knows that blood still scares him do you believe me to his prophet I don't know you God does know you you stick yourself but but your big interest is someone somebody else to sick people real sick cancer dying believe with all your heart take them lay it on it believe and don't doubt power in the blood and you are the blood of Jesus Christ by the Spirit is that not what brother had said he said we are the blood of Jesus Christ by the spirit that's why we are priests because we have the word hallelujah he said you're troubling him in your blood please talk to someone who's anemic he said your troubles in your blood and what is it because between you and I dropped blood it looks like white you're anemic is that right that's that is that true sister bye-bye eyes of faith let's look at Calvary and they were glad sufficient there was blood sufficient and come from them from them Emanuel vain to give a blood transfusion by thing in other words even if you are a meaning faith can transfer a change the blood from anemic to perfect blood hallelujah well no quota let you go see we must understand that the bride is in love when you in love you don't have to worry about am i bragging on my body when they in love with them mmm you know what only you in love and you know your wife is the best cook the best house clean keeper the best everything she hear you like when you really love hello and when you are in love with God that's how it is he's number one but the church the bride is united by one God you under one spirit the Spirit of God and in one holy you God to be one holy bride to God that's right all together unity of the body the body waiting as bad as it is bad as we call ourselves to bride for the uniting time of the bride the church is so coming together is to create just love among us that we could hardly be away from one another oh that's right when you just you don't have to beg people to pray you don't have to beg them to worship God you don't have to beg them to do what's right they're just so in love with him that there's nothing else mmm there's something so you understand and I'm gonna close on those thoughts if we're gonna get closer and we sing it like we talk about it we want to get nearer to it well this is how you get nearer he eats only you easy booyah he said ah Nerra I'm gonna be so near to you I'll be in you you can't get closer than that where you and the Holy Ghost has become one having the same power and most of all people you know we must understand this thing because Paul said everything gonna fail tongues and prophecies you know questions just showing you how it how does the thing break down at the end and the only thing that will survive the test is divine love so no matter what you think no matter what you look at I was I was uh that's my wife about a friend of mine you're talking on some things it time you guys you just got a little deserving and people who are Cana they don't understand your statements you know and so when you think he's right he raises his voice woo you're right so I told my wife I said the next time raise what his boss he gonna be surprised you know because one thing for certain how can I you tried to woo people you tried to help people and I can't open your ears neither can I open your heart I wish everybody saw to use hospital you see you now I wish everybody in here saw it in the same light but we don't and you know the thing about it is I can't do anything about it the only thing I can do is preach the word to you it goes back to your will and why people are afraid they could see it right in the word I don't understand it and they still do whatever they want to do when we have an advocate when we have somebody who we can call on the Bible said we have not high priests that cannot be touched by the feeling about Jesus they never suffer this you know what he suffered many things he had to go through that are not written there in the book but I guarantee you nothing that you're going through he's not aware of and cannot confort you is that right because the Bible said he's a comforter it's a car you he can he can count leaking he could bring you into a place he can hold you he can do whatever you need him to do but you gotta talk to him it's like people people assume pain I'm like I'm a reed nobody mine talk to me right you got to talk that God can read your mind if you want to look at it that way but God loves for you to talk talk to me tell me he said you have not because you ask not and when the blood of Jesus Christ runs through your veins you are a new creature I don't care what you work you could have been blind thirty is not you see when you see you don't say you're blind no more because you can see and when you healed and delivered it meant from the season all the effects of seeing you must realize I'm free and when you free the box it's free free indeed I like that word indeed best an that bloodline is a new bloodline is adding Alan's burlock it's Jesus crisis bloodline you think about all those royal families over there and they've done all they can do throughout the years to keep the bloodline pure and all that time they spinning trying to keep the bloodline pure they all dying it's still people yet they still dying they still growing old you know the Malayan what is it about their blood that's different from anybody else some hierarchy somebody's made up but it's it's a shadow type of the real thing there is draw your blood there is a royal people and God injects us with His Holy Spirit it gives us his blood and therefore there's no failure in God but you gotta believe it this way is a way of faith feel as though I didn't feel God yes when you land on your back and you in pain you don't feel God but that word still don't feel him if you call on him right out the brother was telling me how his brother inside his son had that bad flu couldn't even hardly get out of the be said well I'm gonna go and preach anyhow all of a sudden something happens and I put miraculously in to preach the preach it brief had a good time but when he came out of that pool see but if he had only known the blood he could have held see I didn't know it lobbie see many times coming in here and also God just do something to me and then when I leave out here I'm like Oh see but that same anointing that made me feel good temporarily was there to stay if I wanted it to if I only understood it was that life in me that made me feel that way not life outside than like inside oh yeah oh yeah I'm a child of the king he's raw now flow through my be now can sing praise God praise God I'm a child of the king oh yes oh yes I'm a child of the king he's royal blood now flow through and Oh God
