[41:09] God is good to us
[41:12] he's going to get right into the word of
[41:14] God
[41:15] shake the Lord Jesus
[41:18] thank you musicians
[41:25] I'm really beginning to understand that
[41:27] scripture
[41:28] the kingdom of God suffered violence
[41:32] and the violence take it by force
[41:38] when we know that God is Worthy
[41:41] of all praise
[41:44] sometimes even our own flesh fights
[41:46] against you
[41:48] but you got to push
[41:50] you've got to take control
[41:53] of the situation
[41:56] because Satan would love for us to give
[41:59] God something
[42:01] that's haphazardly
[42:03] and you know but God wants us to give us
[42:07] his all
[42:08] right we appreciate the Lord I know that
[42:11] there's victory in Praise I was thinking
[42:14] this evening when I as I was coming to
[42:16] church how that you know there was a
[42:18] time that God told
[42:20] uh the Joshua and Moses or you know just
[42:25] told the children of Israel just put the
[42:27] music before
[42:29] and uh we realized amen sometimes we
[42:31] that music comes to cast out Devils
[42:35] people say they don't believe in that
[42:37] but truth music will cast out Devils
[42:40] because the word of God uh tells us that
[42:44] that that's how he he has done it in the
[42:46] past and he's the same yesterday today
[42:48] and forever even when uh Saul had a bad
[42:53] Spirit on him uh we know that uh
[42:56] uh David would play music and it would
[43:01] just drive the evil spirit away it's
[43:03] something about consecrated music
[43:07] today or tonight we're just going to
[43:08] preach on a message
[43:10] uh
[43:12] that I mean I I've enjoyed putting
[43:14] together uh by his grace but uh as we
[43:18] talk let's uh speak as we let us turn to
[43:21] Colossians 2 10. today has been a busy
[43:24] day for me but uh I appreciate every
[43:26] every moment of it
[43:29] um
[43:36] everything he's done and is doing for us
[43:38] today
[43:45] the message that really inspired me Is
[43:49] possessing the gates of the enemy
[43:53] Colossians 2 10
[43:57] and ye are complete in him
[43:59] which is the head of all principality
[44:03] and Power
[44:06] Colossians 4
[44:08] 12.
[44:18] you there ephra who is one of you a
[44:21] servant of Christ salute you
[44:25] always laboring fervently for you in
[44:29] prayer
[44:30] that ye may stand perfect
[44:33] and complete in all the will of God
[44:38] that really blessed me
[44:41] uh that ye may stand perfect and
[44:44] complete
[44:45] in all the will of God one more
[44:49] scripture First Corinthians 15.
[44:59] beginning at the 57th verse
[45:03] but thanks be to God
[45:06] which giveth us the victory through our
[45:09] Lord Jesus Christ
[45:11] therefore my beloved brethren
[45:15] be yeast that fast
[45:17] unmovable
[45:18] always abounding in the work of the Lord
[45:22] for as much as you know that your labor
[45:26] is not in vain
[45:28] in the Lord let us pray
[45:32] father we thank you for your grace and
[45:34] your mercy
[45:35] we thank you for being so good to us
[45:39] truly you have been better to us than
[45:41] we've been to ourselves and
[45:44] Lord we don't even fully understand all
[45:46] that's going on in our lives
[45:49] but we know that you are the great
[45:50] Shepherd
[45:52] you knew us and you know us
[45:55] and you know the path that we all take
[45:58] and I pray father God that whatever that
[46:01] may be
[46:02] that you may be glorified in it
[46:05] Lord bless this service in a special way
[46:08] remember as I brother spoken early our
[46:12] brother Orville kabamba
[46:14] we just been constantly in our prayers
[46:17] and
[46:18] Lord we're still preaching and praying
[46:21] but we're praying Victory Lord
[46:24] we thank you Father God because your
[46:26] word said so
[46:27] in your name Jesus Christ bless this
[46:30] service
[46:31] and bless the hearers as well in Jesus
[46:34] Christ's name we pray amen you may be
[46:37] seated
[46:39] in all of the battling that we go
[46:41] through and I know that we all go
[46:43] through difficulties
[46:45] but oftentimes we forget that our time
[46:49] being born in this day is not some kind
[46:52] of a mistake and God didn't throw out
[46:54] some kind of dice to see whether which
[46:57] lot we were going to fall in but
[46:59] everything that has uh it's is being
[47:02] done has already been pre-planned by God
[47:05] and many people don't believe in
[47:07] predestination but I do
[47:10] and I believe that the mind of God knew
[47:13] exactly where we would be how we would
[47:15] be thinking all of the battles that we
[47:17] would go through because every battle
[47:20] has been designed especially for you
[47:22] your battles uh have been patterned
[47:27] for you
[47:28] in order for you to reach Perfection
[47:30] this is why all of us have different
[47:33] battles we go through our different
[47:35] things but we have one goal and that is
[47:39] to reach that Mark that Paul talked
[47:41] about uh reaching for that Mark and and
[47:44] to understand we know that as the
[47:47] scripture says that you know you don't
[47:49] easily get into the kingdom of God
[47:50] you've got to press into it it's meaning
[47:53] that you have an opposition you have
[47:56] something that's going to keep you or
[47:57] try to keep you from getting there but
[48:00] one thing about the true Seed of Abraham
[48:02] they always make it right so Satan is
[48:06] one of the things that we must we're
[48:07] going to talk about because we hardly
[48:09] ever talk about him uh but I want to say
[48:12] something tonight that so that you can
[48:14] uh it could really uh impress your heart
[48:17] and I don't mean your head I mean your
[48:19] heart Satan is already defeated
[48:24] sometimes we work in a Christian realm
[48:26] like we're trying to defeat Satan what
[48:28] but Satan is already defeated
[48:31] and uh you know there is no giant there
[48:34] is no mountain there is no River there
[48:37] is no valley that can keep you from your
[48:39] goals your destiny is certain just as
[48:44] certain as your breathing breath right
[48:45] now
[48:47] we know that by God's grace that uh
[48:50] Jesus Christ when he conquered Satan uh
[48:54] he he he he became the victor of Heaven
[48:56] and Earth
[48:57] uh you know and uh
[49:00] Satan lost the battle you know even at
[49:03] Calvary because their God conquered
[49:06] Satan and he destroyed him death Hell In
[49:10] The Grave the Trinity of the devil and
[49:12] we realize amen those are the three
[49:14] things that Satan tried to hold over our
[49:16] head we don't think about death being
[49:18] sickness but sickness would be would be
[49:21] if there was no death
[49:23] right so we understand uh the grave
[49:27] wouldn't have any power
[49:28] uh if if it wasn't uh from the fall
[49:33] but we understand that everything Satan
[49:35] has uh designed for us or to destroy us
[49:40] uh God has already got it written in the
[49:43] word that he is the one that will be
[49:46] cast into the Lake of Fire
[49:48] in Shadow and tight we know by God's
[49:50] grace that even Iniesta that's why I
[49:52] love Esther so much because I see the
[49:54] whole pattern of of the of redemption
[49:57] there in Esther uh now for the Jews as
[50:01] well as the Gentiles because remember it
[50:04] was it was uh Esther who uh said unto
[50:08] her husband that she would like to see
[50:11] um Haman and all of his sons
[50:15] a basic option to say throw in the Lake
[50:18] of Fire but in reality amen they were
[50:20] destroyed at the end and and when we see
[50:24] these things we it gives us courage uh
[50:27] because sometimes the Satan tried to
[50:29] place a fear on us a fear of what there
[50:33] is no fear in God Amen the Bible said
[50:36] kept perfect love cast out fear right
[50:40] and there is only one perfect love and
[50:43] that's God himself
[50:44] Hallelujah now we must understand amen
[50:48] that God didn't barely conquer Satan he
[50:51] totally conquered him right amen that
[50:54] means everything that Satan in way of
[50:58] opposition can come at you he can never
[51:02] be uh Victorious
[51:04] amen uh when we think about God and I
[51:08] want to say it like this we think about
[51:10] the Old Testament Saints and how they
[51:12] had to suffer you know in the Lions then
[51:15] in the fire and all kinds of persecution
[51:17] they had to go through and still
[51:21] they became victors
[51:24] Hallelujah is that right because when
[51:27] Jesus Christ died
[51:29] he went into the low regions the Bible
[51:31] tell us and he preached to the souls
[51:33] that was in prison but when he got up he
[51:37] didn't get up by himself he was the
[51:39] first to get up but after he rose uh
[51:43] from the dead then all of those saints
[51:46] that died in a way that it looked like
[51:49] Jehovah was defeated
[51:52] that they were defeated
[51:54] but God proved to the devil amen that
[51:59] that his subject amen was Victorious and
[52:03] how come they were victorious because
[52:05] they were in him before the foundation
[52:08] of the world Hallelujah it had nothing
[52:11] to do with all of their failures because
[52:15] everybody was born of failure so it had
[52:19] nothing to do with their failures
[52:21] Hallelujah it was where what what it
[52:24] really was is where it is what what the
[52:27] position they were in before the
[52:31] foundation of the world y'all understand
[52:33] what I'm saying they were in Christ in
[52:36] every victory that Jesus Christ won we
[52:40] were there we won the Victory and that's
[52:44] why amen the Bible tells us that that we
[52:47] are to always rejoice and again he says
[52:50] rejoice
[52:52] amen so you you say well what do you
[52:54] mean because there's always something
[52:57] working in the Unseen
[52:59] things that we can't see Hallelujah but
[53:03] God has already fought the Battle and
[53:07] the Victory is already won
[53:10] Hallelujah I love the scene
[53:13] when Jesus died died and he was Rose
[53:17] from the grave and he began to sin up in
[53:20] heaven and and here he says the Lord Of
[53:24] Glory when they asked him who is the
[53:26] king of glory you know who is this
[53:28] knocking on heaven's Gates amen
[53:30] approaching Heaven's Gate and he said
[53:32] the Lord Of Glory Mighty and host Mighty
[53:36] hosts here they come in marching Jesus
[53:40] led captivity captive and here he comes
[53:43] with an Old Testament Saints and went in
[53:47] the new gates up there and said lift up
[53:50] ye Everlasting Gates and be lifted up
[53:53] and let the king of glory come in
[53:56] Hallelujah when he said the king of
[53:59] glory it almost sounded like it was just
[54:01] him but the king of glory had a host
[54:04] with him and all the hosts of The Old
[54:08] Saint
[54:09] Testament Saints amen marched into the
[54:12] gate uh of Heaven
[54:15] victoriously right hey and I love that
[54:19] scene because The Voice come from the
[54:21] inside and said who is this king of
[54:23] glory now I want you to listen because
[54:26] he said the Lord Mighty in battle
[54:29] didn't say you were
[54:31] and didn't say Samson was
[54:34] didn't say Jeremiah Was didn't say David
[54:37] was it said the Lord Mighty in battle is
[54:42] that right because it wasn't David who
[54:45] battled though David was there it was
[54:48] God in David Hallelujah
[54:52] hallelujah amen the gates flew open and
[54:56] Jesus a conqueror LED captivity captive
[54:59] them that had believed on him and the
[55:03] word had come to them there the Old
[55:06] Testament Saints laying in there waiting
[55:10] he led captivity captive ascended on
[55:13] high took the Old Testament Saints and
[55:16] went in there is one rapture and that's
[55:20] important for us to see because in this
[55:23] time we are in the darkest of all ages
[55:26] hallelujah amen you can look back and
[55:29] say oh but if I was in that day
[55:31] Hallelujah no I'm glad to be in this day
[55:34] because you and I have been designed to
[55:38] put the devil under our feet in this day
[55:42] Hallelujah
[55:44] right
[55:45] when I think about the victories that
[55:48] that that uh that was one in the Old
[55:52] Testament
[55:54] can you imagine the cries and and I I
[55:58] sometimes Envision when David took the
[56:02] head off of Goliath
[56:04] and and Israel saw the victory that
[56:07] David had just won by the inspiration of
[56:09] the Holy Spirit and he took that head
[56:12] and he lifted it up can you imagine how
[56:16] the Earth roared and how it the the very
[56:20] vibration of Victory went throughout the
[56:23] whole Army of Israel so much so they all
[56:27] charged the enemy
[56:29] Hallelujah and can you see how it how it
[56:33] is now that's why there's no no uh how
[56:36] can I say it the prophet God says it
[56:38] like this he calls it the victory of
[56:40] vibration or the vibrational victories
[56:43] Hallelujah and those victories ought to
[56:46] be felt Hallelujah right now those you
[56:50] say what do you mean the battle is over
[56:52] no sir let me say how can I say it Lord
[56:55] you say the victory is already won
[56:58] that's true but the vibration of the
[57:00] victories are still moving
[57:04] Hallelujah is that right those vibration
[57:07] never stops hallelujah amen and we ought
[57:10] to be able to pick up on those
[57:12] vibrations
[57:13] glory to God Amen the Earth must have
[57:18] shook
[57:22] when when when when when when David amen
[57:25] uh when they won that battle and they
[57:27] began to chase can you imagine listen to
[57:30] that
[57:31] can you imagine thousands of feet
[57:34] Hallelujah stopping amen it's shook the
[57:38] vibration that was in them shook the
[57:40] Earth hallelujah oh God have mercy yes
[57:43] sir and when the earth vibrated you can
[57:46] imagine even the Rocks were rejoicing
[57:49] with God hallelujah see that we must
[57:52] understand that we we sometimes fight
[57:56] when we don't have to fight because the
[57:59] battle has already been won
[58:01] you understand me we don't have to fight
[58:04] listen every enemy has been defeated
[58:08] amen hallelujah but we must really
[58:11] believe that
[58:13] that every enemy has been defeated
[58:17] by whom Jesus Christ himself
[58:21] Hallelujah he came in this day is that
[58:24] right
[58:25] he visited us
[58:27] by even the way of a prophet but it
[58:29] doesn't stop there
[58:34] the vibrations must continue
[58:37] [Laughter]
[58:39] Hallelujah it will give you such a joy
[58:43] to recognize I am secure
[58:47] man
[58:48] that gay homie if I die it can't hold me
[58:52] but when God revealed to me that I'm
[58:55] Healed
[58:56] death
[58:57] sickness can't hold his place
[59:00] y'all understand me because the Bible
[59:03] said if we say with his stripes we're
[59:06] healed and we believe that Hallelujah
[59:10] but the man who said it like this he
[59:12] says it's like Joshua I give you the
[59:14] land it's yours but you gotta fight for
[59:18] it Hallelujah we don't fight physically
[59:21] but we fight without faith our faith is
[59:25] unmovable our faith stands still it
[59:29] doesn't matter what it looks like
[59:31] hallelujah we're not going by our sight
[59:34] we're going by the power of God
[59:37] hallelujah this is what I love about him
[59:40] because when you get the Holy Ghost it's
[59:42] no longer your faith it's not your
[59:44] mental your way of reasoning your way of
[59:47] processing Hallelujah turn it over to
[59:51] Jesus Hallelujah let him step in when
[59:54] you let him step in he then takes over
[59:58] Hallelujah there is a conqueror you talk
[1:00:01] about jerking off Avril aprons and
[1:00:04] waving it people say we are crazy
[1:00:06] because we shout and we run and we
[1:00:08] scream and we holler where are those
[1:00:10] people where are they Hallelujah they
[1:00:12] have never felt the Victor victorious
[1:00:15] vibrations of Heaven that's what he said
[1:00:18] they have never felt the Victorious
[1:00:21] vibrations of Heaven that that that the
[1:00:24] battle is over
[1:00:27] you don't know that amen when when they
[1:00:30] Israel saw David take off the head of
[1:00:33] Goliath they knew the battle was over
[1:00:36] Hallelujah that's right they uh they
[1:00:40] understood because there was none
[1:00:41] greater than Goliath at that time except
[1:00:44] God himself
[1:00:47] Hallelujah and Goliath represent the
[1:00:50] devil Goliath represent death
[1:00:54] Hallelujah Goliath represents sickness
[1:00:57] Goliath represent everything the devil
[1:01:00] could put out Hallelujah but guess what
[1:01:03] God conquered Goliath with a young boy
[1:01:07] Hallelujah and one word One Revelation
[1:01:10] he understood by God's grace that God
[1:01:14] was with him that is what the devil
[1:01:16] tries to do to us he tried to make us
[1:01:19] feel that God is not with us
[1:01:22] Hallelujah but we're not like Saul
[1:01:25] Hallelujah we are we have we are not
[1:01:28] appointed by people we haven't been
[1:01:30] appointed by men we have been appointed
[1:01:33] by God and when God's appoint you he's
[1:01:36] anoint you Hallelujah yes sir and you
[1:01:41] and I must understand that God has given
[1:01:44] us complete Victory oh you say well
[1:01:46] brother Brooks it don't look like it
[1:01:48] what are you looking at
[1:01:50] Hallelujah I'm looking at the word and
[1:01:54] the word brings promises to me and his
[1:01:56] promises are yay and not nay Hallelujah
[1:01:59] is that right God can get you out of
[1:02:03] whatever situation you're in
[1:02:06] Hallelujah but your faith must hold
[1:02:10] it must not waver
[1:02:12] Hallelujah no matter what Satan brings
[1:02:15] to you you got to believe what God says
[1:02:18] Hallelujah people say you're crazy about
[1:02:21] you because we shout and we run and we
[1:02:23] scream and we holler they have never
[1:02:26] felt the Victorious vibration of Heaven
[1:02:28] that the battle is over our Great Mighty
[1:02:31] conqueror has won every Victory he
[1:02:34] stands alone this morning untouched
[1:02:38] hallelujah amen no man no man no there
[1:02:42] is no other God he's the only true God
[1:02:45] right
[1:02:46] God gives us perfect Victory Hallelujah
[1:02:49] is that right and that's what we must
[1:02:52] see is already given let me let me what
[1:02:54] you got to fight for something if it's
[1:02:56] already given to you
[1:02:59] you don't fight
[1:03:00] the battle the the one who's fought for
[1:03:03] our victory has given us a victory
[1:03:06] is that right and Jesus Christ Alone
[1:03:09] stands as our trophy
[1:03:13] Hallelujah the word and I heard our
[1:03:15] brother say that tonight Lord let please
[1:03:19] come and have preeminence in it right
[1:03:21] this is what we want we want God to have
[1:03:24] preeminence Hallelujah complete
[1:03:27] preeminence we want him to rule our
[1:03:30] bodies our mind our souls our spirit
[1:03:33] everything about the whole being Lord
[1:03:36] have preemness this tonight Hallelujah
[1:03:39] that people might be able to see you and
[1:03:41] us
[1:03:42] Hallelujah the Bible said we are
[1:03:45] completing him
[1:03:47] I don't know whether I'll understand
[1:03:48] that or not but you understand we're
[1:03:50] completing me
[1:03:52] Hallelujah we you are complete in him
[1:03:56] what are you struggling with what are
[1:03:58] you struggling for if you are come he is
[1:04:00] complete right and you're completing him
[1:04:03] like I was telling somebody my life is
[1:04:06] here
[1:04:07] in Christ Jesus that's it
[1:04:11] Hallelujah you got to believe this you
[1:04:14] got to believe it if you're going to
[1:04:15] make a Rapture you can't think that
[1:04:18] you're going to be perfect you got to
[1:04:20] think that you are believe that you are
[1:04:22] it's not what you see it's what he's
[1:04:26] looking at Hallelujah he is the head is
[1:04:30] that right
[1:04:31] Oh Glory the Bible says listen Paul says
[1:04:33] if anybody knows anything if anybody
[1:04:37] knew anything it would have been Paul he
[1:04:40] said but thanks be to God which giveth
[1:04:42] us the victory through our Lord Jesus
[1:04:45] Christ
[1:04:46] this is the part I like therefore
[1:04:50] my beloved Brethren be steadfast
[1:04:53] unmovable
[1:04:55] I love that word unmovable
[1:04:58] you can almost put it this way
[1:04:59] Unstoppable
[1:05:01] always abounding in the work of the law
[1:05:05] that means going forward amen amen not
[1:05:08] standing still going forward Amen in the
[1:05:11] work of the Lord for as much as you know
[1:05:14] that your labor is not in vain where in
[1:05:17] the Lord as long as in it is in the Lord
[1:05:20] your laboring is not in vain
[1:05:24] Christ's Victory brought us the Holy
[1:05:26] Ghost
[1:05:27] y'all understand that
[1:05:29] that you know a lot of the the
[1:05:31] downplayed the Holy Ghost I don't like
[1:05:34] that because the Holy Ghost is God
[1:05:37] there is no other Holy Ghost there's
[1:05:40] only one spirit and that is the holy
[1:05:42] spirit right and that spirit that
[1:05:45] conquers and that's the spirit that
[1:05:47] conquered Satan in his own territory
[1:05:51] y'all understand that so let me say it
[1:05:54] like this if God if Jesus Christ was
[1:05:57] able to go down into the region of the
[1:06:00] Lost into hell and conquer him that
[1:06:03] what power he must have here
[1:06:07] Hallelujah conquer them right in his own
[1:06:10] territory
[1:06:12] and if he conquered him in hell he can
[1:06:15] conquer him on Earth Hallelujah
[1:06:18] that's right not only enough he conquers
[1:06:21] him in heaven
[1:06:24] yeah there's no way Satan can run
[1:06:27] he's conquered in heaven he's conquered
[1:06:29] on Earth y'all don't believe that oh yes
[1:06:33] when Daniel Prayed
[1:06:35] pray pray and he wondered what was going
[1:06:39] on but the angel said Daniel I heard you
[1:06:42] 21 days ago but there's a battle going
[1:06:45] on and we defeated the the Prince of
[1:06:48] Persia is that right see you what we
[1:06:51] don't understand is that our prayers are
[1:06:53] not just Earthbound but our prayers amen
[1:06:57] goes to heaven it moves Beyond this
[1:07:00] Dimension and the angels are in charge
[1:07:03] to make sure our prayers are heard or
[1:07:07] our prayers come to pass is that right
[1:07:11] oh my brother Randall said even if you
[1:07:14] would look in the spiritual realm and
[1:07:15] see those lights and the Darkness
[1:07:17] fighting each other Hallelujah yes sir
[1:07:21] you and I must understand because
[1:07:23] because the devil wants us to think
[1:07:24] we're just by ourselves and and and we
[1:07:28] pray and perhaps God will hear us and
[1:07:31] the Bible said God hears your prayers
[1:07:35] Hallelujah
[1:07:38] when you covered by the blood
[1:07:41] God knows your thoughts
[1:07:44] afar off
[1:07:48] Hallelujah
[1:07:49] on the day of Pentecost
[1:07:51] this is a quote he went down
[1:07:55] he sent down the Holy Ghost to what to
[1:07:57] continue through the Gentiles to take
[1:08:01] out a seed of promise to give to the
[1:08:04] Gentiles the Off cast to give to them
[1:08:07] the baptism of the Holy Ghost to bring
[1:08:09] them into the promise now we have a
[1:08:12] right to conquer all sickness amen
[1:08:15] Hallelujah that's what the Holy Ghost is
[1:08:18] for it's given to you to conquer all
[1:08:21] sickness we don't have to conquer it
[1:08:24] it's already conquered
[1:08:27] let me say that again we do not have to
[1:08:30] conquer it it's already conquered we
[1:08:34] just have to claim the promise and go
[1:08:37] take it
[1:08:38] hallelujah it's already conquered death
[1:08:42] is conquered hell is conquered sickness
[1:08:44] is conquered temptation is conquered
[1:08:47] when I heard that I say yes Lord
[1:08:50] hallelujah that means Temptation can be
[1:08:53] conquered by you in you if you have the
[1:08:57] faith
[1:08:58] amen that same thing that'll move
[1:09:00] Mountain moves Temptation y'all
[1:09:04] understand me
[1:09:05] temptation is conquered amen amen
[1:09:07] hallelujah
[1:09:09] oh devil
[1:09:12] all Devils amen is conquered
[1:09:16] hell is conquered death is conquered the
[1:09:19] grave is conquered Hallelujah
[1:09:23] we stand in the gate taking it don't
[1:09:26] have to fire a shot it's already been
[1:09:29] paid for
[1:09:31] Hallelujah you understand what I'm
[1:09:34] saying that's why he's at Shalom peace
[1:09:38] to the bride oh come on somebody all
[1:09:41] before we had the fight fight fight
[1:09:43] fight fight fight but when the angel
[1:09:45] when God himself come down
[1:09:48] y'all understand me when that lamb
[1:09:51] opened that book
[1:09:53] he came as a Victorious one he put his
[1:09:57] foot on the land and the Sea and he
[1:10:00] declared that time would be no more
[1:10:02] Hallelujah is that right that's the same
[1:10:05] thing that boy has said to Ruth you wait
[1:10:07] here you rest I'll battle for it I'll
[1:10:10] take it for it you just rest I'll
[1:10:12] conquer it for it when I come back I'm
[1:10:15] coming back for you you'll understand me
[1:10:18] at that point she did not have to worry
[1:10:21] ever again
[1:10:24] that's what we're dealing with we're
[1:10:27] dealing with the lamb taking the book
[1:10:29] telling the saints of God have faith in
[1:10:32] what I have already done
[1:10:35] Hallelujah
[1:10:37] is that right
[1:10:38] you don't have to do nothing but have
[1:10:40] faith take it
[1:10:42] that's what he said his enemies
[1:10:45] he will possess the Gate of his enemy
[1:10:47] how many thousands of millions he will
[1:10:51] possess the gates of his enemy every
[1:10:53] enemy he rose from the dead he possessed
[1:10:56] it because he gave it to us
[1:10:59] Hallelujah
[1:11:01] hallelujah it's all a what free gift
[1:11:06] besides all of that and everything that
[1:11:09] he has done and conquered every gate he
[1:11:12] conquers sickness took the gates only
[1:11:14] thing we have to do is walk up to the
[1:11:17] gate and say the name of Jesus Christ
[1:11:20] the Conqueror amen amen

[1:33:07] promises of God
[1:33:10] Hallelujah God is still more than able

[1:33:18] and he says Abraham seed is
[1:33:21] seed and material

[1:33:25] because it's a promise his seed ship is
[1:33:27] possess the gates of the enemies now
[1:33:30] you'll go through testing
[1:33:32] you'll go through trials and Joshua

[1:33:43] what kind of Spears they got I how high

[1:33:50] is our promise is that the gate will be
[1:33:53] possessed by the seed of the God God's
[1:33:55] children and we're going over to take

[1:34:10] whip him anywhere else
[1:34:13] listen those saints of God of the Old
[1:34:15] Testament they died in faith and because
[1:34:18] they died in faith they were able to
[1:34:20] rise amen amen hallelujah and the word
[1:34:23] of God said even when it came to the New
[1:34:26] Testament there were some of them who
[1:34:28] didn't want to be delivered
[1:34:31] right
[1:34:34] but if you want to be delivered God will
[1:34:37] deliver you
[1:34:40] you don't have to work at it
[1:34:42] you just stand still and see the
[1:34:44] salvation of the Lord
[1:34:46] Joshua stood there loyal
[1:34:49] a little fellow said I don't care how
[1:34:51] big they are I don't care what kind of
[1:34:53] Spears they got how high their city is
[1:34:56] Walled how great it is how our promise
[1:34:59] is that the gate will possess but y'all
[1:35:02] we we read these things and we have no
[1:35:04] idea

[1:35:23] and this city had big folks
[1:35:26] with big grapes
[1:35:29] and you know fear tactic had already
[1:35:31] come Satan had already set up ten spies
[1:35:34] to say it's too much for us to take care
[1:35:36] of
[1:35:37] you know that's how the devil is the
[1:35:39] devil will come through a doctor or
[1:35:41] somebody else oh it can't be done

[1:35:52] this machine go down so low and somebody
[1:35:55] come back up
[1:35:57] that old man who had heard the prophet
[1:35:59] pray said
[1:36:00] my daughter

[1:36:23] how fast amen amen hallelujah
[1:36:27] Satan cannot defeat faith
[1:36:33] Hallelujah
[1:36:36] glory to God you understand me
[1:36:40] oh that's the truth see lots of them
[1:36:43] that was was born natural she said we
[1:36:46] just can't do it there's no need to try
[1:36:49] it see we are outnumbered we are
[1:36:52] outclassed and everything no matter he
[1:36:55] wouldn't see they looked at that what
[1:36:57] the eyes saw and Joshua was looking what
[1:37:00] God Said
[1:37:01] hmm and the Seed of Abraham doesn't look
[1:37:04] to any of the natural things they look
[1:37:07] to what the Lord said that's the promise
[1:37:10] What If Abraham would have looked to
[1:37:12] that natural at a woman 100 years old 90
[1:37:15] she was and he was a hundred and had
[1:37:18] lived with her since she was a little
[1:37:20] girl and he was a little boy and no seed
[1:37:22] he didn't look at those things he said
[1:37:25] he counted those things as if they were
[1:37:27] not
[1:37:32] that's the way you got to do
[1:37:34] I don't care what it looks like
[1:37:38] it's all lion bandages that's what
[1:37:40] that's what Jonah said Jonah was in the
[1:37:43] bed a little way all lying Valley
[1:37:45] vanities
[1:37:46] huh is that right think about your look
[1:37:48] what you look what you go through every
[1:37:51] day that looked like your failure the
[1:37:54] way Satan sets you up
[1:37:56] Hallelujah
[1:37:57] you know if anybody could see just like
[1:38:00] my wife and somebody else was we were
[1:38:01] talking I was talking to somebody I said
[1:38:03] man if you would see what goes on in
[1:38:05] this I think it was maybe it was rich I
[1:38:08] don't know who it was but we were
[1:38:09] talking about how if people could hear
[1:38:11] and what we think
[1:38:15] if we all get out
[1:38:19] through in our minds I wonder how many
[1:38:22] people would like you
[1:38:26] but the point is that God sees all of
[1:38:28] that he knows all of that and he loves
[1:38:31] you anyway yes that was Brother Rich he
[1:38:34] loves you anyway
[1:38:40] can I say it like this
[1:38:43] even conquered your thoughts
[1:38:48] amen
[1:38:51] I'm almost done
[1:38:53] the Perfection of God is given to the
[1:38:55] believer
[1:38:56] by the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:39:01] just the other day when I was preaching
[1:39:03] Sunday I think I said you are you are
[1:39:05] becoming
[1:39:08] everybody's becoming something
[1:39:10] that's true
[1:39:14] you're maturing into something
[1:39:16] you either maturing into the image of
[1:39:19] God
[1:39:19] are you maturing into the image of the
[1:39:21] devil
[1:39:24] there's no in between
[1:39:26] and you got to know you know every man
[1:39:29] that has the life of God in them knows
[1:39:32] they've got the life of God even though
[1:39:34] you can't explain it
[1:39:36] and if the life of God is in you the
[1:39:39] Bible said he that begun the good work
[1:39:40] in you is faithful to complete it
[1:39:43] it ain't your working end it's him
[1:39:46] working it through you right listen
[1:39:49] Hebrews 9 10 9-14 says then said he lo I
[1:39:53] come to to that to do thy will o God he
[1:39:56] taketh away the first that he may
[1:39:59] establish the second by the which will
[1:40:01] we are Sanctified through the offering
[1:40:04] of the body of Jesus Christ once for all
[1:40:07] and every priest standard daily
[1:40:10] ministering and offering offering often
[1:40:13] time the same sacrifice we can't which
[1:40:16] can never take away sin
[1:40:18] but this man
[1:40:20] after he had offered one sacrifice for
[1:40:23] sins forever set down on the right hand
[1:40:26] of God
[1:40:27] amen y'all understand me
[1:40:29] all your sins everything that you could
[1:40:33] possibly dream of doing wrong was taken
[1:40:36] care of at Calvary from his fault
[1:40:39] expecting to the enemy
[1:40:43] to understand where we are
[1:40:45] we're the last Church age
[1:40:49] and in this church age we will put the
[1:40:52] enemy and make him our footstool
[1:40:56] the footstool is
[1:40:58] it's it's it's something that you could
[1:41:00] use in your advantage
[1:41:03] if you can't reach something you could
[1:41:05] step on that footstool and get it
[1:41:10] Hallelujah it ain't there just to be
[1:41:13] relaxing your feet
[1:41:15] but you can use it as a ladder
[1:41:18] right you can use it as a stepping stone
[1:41:23] Hallelujah for his fourth
[1:41:27] expecting till the enemy be made his
[1:41:29] first two for by one offering he had
[1:41:32] perfected forever them that are
[1:41:36] sanctified
[1:41:38] one offering
[1:41:41] Hallelujah this is my last scripture
[1:41:43] Hebrews 12 22-25 what I'm trying to say
[1:41:48] is complete brothers and sisters
[1:41:51] you know stop your worrying stop your
[1:41:53] fretting
[1:41:55] you know it's all in his control
[1:41:59] Hallelujah
[1:42:01] you know it's
[1:42:03] if you if you study you know the prayer
[1:42:07] a life of William Branham and when God
[1:42:10] used him in discernment
[1:42:12] you'll find out that there was nothing
[1:42:14] hidden
[1:42:15] in the services
[1:42:17] and some things sometimes God went all
[1:42:20] the way back to somebody's childhood
[1:42:23] y'all hear me there was nothing hidden
[1:42:26] and I guess if God wanted to expose all
[1:42:29] of somebody every bit of somebody's life
[1:42:32] he could have done it
[1:42:34] right think about all of those people
[1:42:36] and he would tell these people these
[1:42:38] things and this happened to you when you
[1:42:40] was a little girl and this is what
[1:42:41] happened to you when you and I you know
[1:42:44] what I mean and you said well what how
[1:42:46] in the world it because it wasn't a man
[1:42:48] but those things were said to Enlighten
[1:42:52] us
[1:42:53] that every move we make he knows about
[1:42:57] it before we make the move
[1:43:03] and you know it doesn't
[1:43:05] and some of us may have thought oh my
[1:43:07] god I've done such ugly sins but don't
[1:43:11] you understand God knows
[1:43:13] and let me say it like this
[1:43:15] there's always somebody worse
[1:43:21] always
[1:43:23] but the thing that I love about this is
[1:43:25] that you come to recognize I'm no
[1:43:27] different from anybody else it's just
[1:43:29] that the grace of God is with me
[1:43:35] Hallelujah but yeah come to Mount Zion
[1:43:39] unto the city of the Living God
[1:43:43] the Heavenly Jerusalem and to an
[1:43:46] innumerable company of angels to the
[1:43:49] general assembly in the Church of the
[1:43:51] firstborn which are written in heaven
[1:43:53] and to God the judge of all thank you
[1:43:57] Jesus and to the spirits of just men
[1:44:02] made perfect
[1:44:05] you know what the word made means
[1:44:08] when you're not in control he making you
[1:44:12] he made you
[1:44:15] you perfect
[1:44:16] and to Jesus the mediator of the New
[1:44:20] Testament Covenant and to the blood of
[1:44:23] sprinkling that speaketh better things
[1:44:25] than that of Abel seeing that you refuse
[1:44:28] not him that speak it for if they escape
[1:44:31] not who refused him that speaketh on
[1:44:33] Earth much more shall not we escape if
[1:44:37] we turn away from him that's speaketh
[1:44:40] from heaven
[1:44:42] y'all understand that this message
[1:44:44] didn't come from Earth this message came
[1:44:47] from heaven
[1:44:49] and those who refused him that spoke on
[1:44:52] earth like Moses and and and and it was
[1:44:55] was destroyed what about us now don't
[1:44:58] refuse him that speaketh from Heaven
[1:45:00] because that Jesus Christ himself the
[1:45:03] devil is defeated
[1:45:04] the lamb the blood of lamb triumph over
[1:45:07] Heaven Satan stands as a as a trophy to
[1:45:11] the believer the defeat of him rather
[1:45:13] you love the Lord amen
[1:45:19] I will close with this uh let me finish
[1:45:22] it's just a short period it's just a
[1:45:24] short thing
[1:45:25] if you got an enemy this morning
[1:45:28] then my brother there's only if you are
[1:45:32] a Seed of Abraham after hearing this
[1:45:34] there's not enough devils in hell can
[1:45:37] keep that gate
[1:45:38] before you it it it it will open I don't
[1:45:42] care what it is you walk up there as a
[1:45:45] promise seed and say I claim this for
[1:45:48] mine
[1:45:49] this is mine because God swore that he'd
[1:45:53] raise up Jesus and threw Jesus out
[1:45:55] conquer it I come in the name of that
[1:45:58] conqueror Jesus Christ
[1:46:00] step back I'm passing through amen he
[1:46:04] should possess the gates of the enemy
[1:46:06] then stand up there with your shoulders
[1:46:09] back in your Shield a shining covered by
[1:46:13] the blood of the Lord Jesus the enemy
[1:46:15] will recognize
[1:46:18] our Christian friend put on the whole
[1:46:20] arm of God don't stand back with some
[1:46:22] little idea of some Creed or something
[1:46:25] that you're standing by put on the whole
[1:46:27] arm of God when you go to fight against
[1:46:30] the enemy like our Lord did he showed
[1:46:33] that how he
[1:46:35] how the weakest of Christians can defeat
[1:46:38] Satan just with the word
[1:46:41] he had power he could have smoked Satan
[1:46:45] anyway he wanted to but he didn't use it
[1:46:48] he just took the word and defeated him
[1:46:51] with it it is written it is written
[1:46:54] everywhere it is written so he defeated
[1:46:57] Satan by the word of God
[1:47:01] but God at the beginning gave his
[1:47:04] children the atomic weapon because he's
[1:47:07] infinite God now seeing there was going
[1:47:10] to be a conflict and there was going to
[1:47:12] be a battle God equipped his children
[1:47:15] with the right kind of ammunition right
[1:47:18] kind of a of an attack the right kind of
[1:47:21] everything that they had need of that
[1:47:24] would sweep them all the way from Eden
[1:47:26] to the Rapture what is it the word the
[1:47:30] word that's what defeats Satan is the
[1:47:33] word it'll defeat him anywhere anyplace
[1:47:37] now why do you want to substitute
[1:47:39] something else when we have already got
[1:47:42] the best thing that there is the word
[1:47:46] Hallelujah my last one that's what Jesus
[1:47:49] defeated Satan he never used his power
[1:47:52] he was God manifested in flesh but he
[1:47:56] didn't use his power all the gifts that
[1:47:58] there was in heaven he had them in him
[1:48:01] but he didn't use that he just took the
[1:48:04] father's word he said it's written thou
[1:48:07] shall Worship the Lord thy God it is
[1:48:09] written it is written it is written it
[1:48:13] is written and he defeated Satan and the
[1:48:16] word of God will defeat Satan anywhere
[1:48:19] on any ground under any conditions God's
[1:48:23] holy word
[1:48:25] Hallelujah
[1:48:26] glory to God
[1:48:28] that is nothing but the truth and when
[1:48:32] you and I see that and really understand
[1:48:34] that it takes away the worry
[1:48:37] right amen you go through your suffering
[1:48:40] you go through things we all will do
[1:48:42] we'll have to but at the end of the day
[1:48:46] God is a revelation
[1:48:49] amen and God will reveal to you
[1:48:53] I don't think
[1:48:54] David thought oh my God what if he
[1:48:57] doesn't come on the scene
[1:48:59] David had confidence that The God Who
[1:49:02] slew the bear the goddess flew the lion
[1:49:04] which slay also Goliath amen right each
[1:49:09] each test got more difficult
[1:49:11] but when David slew Goliath
[1:49:14] he was king forever
[1:49:17] you understand me so you and I must
[1:49:19] understand we all have to have our
[1:49:21] battles and each one will escalate get
[1:49:24] higher and harder but God has given us
[1:49:27] victory over every one of them
[1:49:30] and right now we're all going through
[1:49:32] something I don't know what you're going
[1:49:34] through but I'm telling you the battle
[1:49:36] has been fought and the victory has
[1:49:39] already been won
[1:49:40] if we could only receive that
[1:49:42] leave our reasoning alone the way we
[1:49:45] process things in our minds you know it
[1:49:48] it comes to defeat us
[1:49:50] because we try to figure it out you
[1:49:53] can't figure it out it's what God does
[1:49:55] you know it's it's you know who I I
[1:49:58] still wonder I I I I often wonder you
[1:50:02] know how Jonah when we get to heaven
[1:50:04] what his testimony is going to be
[1:50:09] because as far as I know of the way I am
[1:50:12] I would have died in the belly of a way
[1:50:19] unless God would have shown me something
[1:50:22] just by the fact that he swallowed me
[1:50:25] would have left me in a mental state
[1:50:29] that's the truth I'm talking carnal but
[1:50:31] it's true
[1:50:32] but this man came out fighting
[1:50:35] you know
[1:50:37] no matter what it looked like he he knew
[1:50:39] he had a work to do because God told him
[1:50:41] you got to go preach to Nineveh so he
[1:50:44] understood he could not die right when
[1:50:47] you understand that you cannot die
[1:50:49] because God has a work for you to do
[1:50:52] Satan Can't Stop
[1:50:55] Hallelujah Satan can't stop you
[1:50:59] you love the Lord
[1:51:00] Hallelujah let's stand Fire won't burn
[1:51:03] you
[1:51:05] flood can't drown you
[1:51:08] nothing can stop you when you know you
[1:51:10] have your work has not been completed
