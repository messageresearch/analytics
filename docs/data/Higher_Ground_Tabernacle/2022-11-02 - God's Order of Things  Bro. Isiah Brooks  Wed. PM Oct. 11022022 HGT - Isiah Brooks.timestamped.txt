[0:00] that's what our minds let God like as if
[0:03] God is punishing us no sir he's loving
[0:07] us
[0:08] is that right and when we get spanked
[0:13] listen
[0:14] you you call it act like it is most
[0:17] child when you when you get spanked he
[0:20] says well who spanked you
[0:22] Daddy
[0:23] or Mama they know who did it
[0:27] and they know they got spanked and
[0:30] that's the thing when something is
[0:31] coming our way and God is chastising us
[0:33] forward don't act like oh my God why and
[0:36] how did this come about
[0:38] but thank God for the spanking
[0:42] y'all better hear what I'm saying I
[0:44] remember a time my mama whooped me
[0:46] really good
[0:48] I never forgot it
[0:51] but guarantee you it corrected the tree
[0:56] I tell people I said my mom didn't cut
[0:58] no limbs off she went down there to the
[1:00] root
[1:01] she uprooted the whole tree
[1:04] oh yeah she made sure she she ate she
[1:08] got victory that day
[1:10] as a child I didn't understand it I'm
[1:13] telling you so this is personal I did
[1:15] not understand my mama whipping me like
[1:17] that until I matured
[1:19] and when I matured I said Mama you were
[1:21] right
[1:23] I could have been locked up in jail
[1:25] right now if that tree would have
[1:26] continued to grow
[1:29] y'all understand what I'm saying now I
[1:31] ain't telling you no more than that
[1:33] but the truth of the matter is
[1:36] we ought to thank God for his counseling
[1:41] his wisdom listen we would not know the
[1:44] will of God had not God had an order
[1:48] we'll be right out there with everybody
[1:50] else not knowing that God has an order
[1:53] because we're living in a time where man
[1:56] is right in his own eyes
[2:01] Psalm 97 8-12
[2:04] Zion heard
[2:06] and was glad
[2:15] and the daughters of Judah Rejoice
[2:18] because of thy judgments
[2:21] oh Lord do you think they they talking
[2:24] about uh uh God punishing them no
[2:28] they're talking about God correcting
[2:30] them
[2:31] the word is the corrector
[2:33] that's why the Bible said judgment
[2:35] begins at the house of God now when you
[2:38] come here God ain't killing you he's
[2:40] giving you life
[2:42] but he's judging you by the word his
[2:44] judgments are true and when the word
[2:46] comes across the pulpit you say Amen
[2:50] Hallelujah it might make you feel good
[2:53] it may make you feel glad it might make
[2:57] you feel sad but you say hallelujah and
[3:00] how
[3:00] why because he's now looking in your
[3:03] heart and he's judging you and he's
[3:05] telling you hey this is not right this
[3:08] is not right correct this correct that
[3:10] and you say Amen
[3:13] for thou O Lord are high above all the
[3:17] Earth
[3:18] Thou Art exalted far above all gods
[3:22] ye that love the Lord hate evil now this
[3:26] is counseling now
[3:28] if you love the Lord give ask God to
[3:31] give you Grace to hate evil
[3:33] he preserved the soul of his Saints I
[3:36] love that
[3:37] he delivered them out of out of the hand
[3:40] of the wicked so if you've got some
[3:43] Wicked person that's troubling you don't
[3:45] you worry the Bible said that God will
[3:48] deliver you out of the hand of the
[3:50] wicked
[3:51] that's the word
[3:53] amen and when the enemy comes like a
[3:55] flood this is what you ought to bring
[3:57] him to
[3:58] Lord you said you would deliver me out
[4:01] of the hand of the wicked and your
[4:03] counseling is right and your judgments
[4:06] are true
[4:07] light is sown for the righteous
[4:10] gladness for the upright and heart
[4:14] rejoice in the Lord ye righteous and
[4:17] give thanks at the remembrance of his
[4:20] Holiness you see what I'm saying what is
[4:22] God doing bringing us back into his
[4:24] holiness
[4:26] where we were from the beginning
[4:28] into his Holiness and we know that this
[4:31] is a world a Fallen World a perverted
[4:33] world everything is uh how you said so
[4:36] perverted and you know uh uh hybrid and
[4:39] you name it nothing can go right in it
[4:42] nothing this is why God had to birth us
[4:45] into another kingdom where everything
[4:47] goes right
[4:48] in this Kingdom nothing fails
[4:55] God's order
[4:57] you've never seen the Sun get out of
[4:58] place
[5:00] people say fall in Stars a star ain't
[5:02] never fail but Luther Lucifer he's the
[5:04] only one
[5:05] that I know of
[5:07] and all the angels that was with him
[5:10] but all the stars that God said in the
[5:13] universe is still the same place doing
[5:15] the same thing they've always did if one
[5:18] of them move out of the way it would
[5:19] cause a a catastrophic effect
[5:23] right everything that like soldiers
[5:26] standing there the sun is faithful the
[5:29] Moon is faithful right everything is
[5:33] still moving the way God had it moving
[5:35] from the beginning what is it that's
[5:37] God's order
[5:39] Hallelujah
[5:41] think about it and if that
[5:44] if that God
[5:48] is the only thing that puts us back in
[5:50] our proper place
[5:52] no system can do it
[5:55] no man-made theology or anything can do
[5:58] this only one thing one person can do
[6:01] this and that's God himself the Creator
[6:04] the Bible said all things was created by
[6:07] Him all things were made by him
[6:09] everything that you see
[6:11] Hallelujah but God puts us back in order
[6:14] he said our brothers I don't know about
[6:17] that let me tell you something we were
[6:18] born out of order
[6:20] is that right take about think about it
[6:23] think about it when they caught this
[6:25] woman in in in adultery Jesus didn't see
[6:28] uh she he was she what he saw was a
[6:31] woman out of order a seed out of order
[6:35] everybody else saw some evil
[6:38] Jesus looked beyond all of that and saw
[6:42] a Daughter of Zion y'all hear what I'm
[6:45] saying what did he do he put her by back
[6:48] in order first of all he did what where
[6:51] are your accusers
[6:54] is that right that's the word
[6:57] the word says who's going to lay the
[6:59] charge to God's elect
[7:01] it is God who justify it hallelujah it's
[7:04] not a man it's God is that right and
[7:08] when God saved you he justifies you as
[7:11] though you've never sinned in the first
[7:13] place who's going to blame the Bible
[7:16] said when it comes to the Judgment they
[7:18] can't bring you will be the one that
[7:19] will judge them
[7:23] Psalms 19 1-14
[7:26] I've got to move faster
[7:29] the heavens declare the glory of God in
[7:31] the firmament showeth his hand it works
[7:33] day unto day out of the speech at night
[7:36] and tonight showeth knowledge there is
[7:39] no speech nor language where their voice
[7:42] is not heard their line is going out
[7:45] through all the Earth and their words to
[7:48] the end of the world in them have he set
[7:51] a tabernacle for the sun in other words
[7:54] everything is in order
[7:55] we he said it declares his glory
[7:59] is that right the Stars it's the truth
[8:02] he said Abraham look at the Sand
[8:06] look at the sand of the sea see can you
[8:08] count them no Abraham you can't I want
[8:11] you to look up now amen and see the
[8:14] stars because just as you see the sand
[8:17] so are the stars and these be your seed
[8:21] listen there's a star in the heaven that
[8:24] represents you
[8:27] laughs
[8:29] and that star was there before I was
[8:32] born
[8:33] that star was dead when I was born
[8:37] y'all understand me I had to be born
[8:40] when I was born I could not have been
[8:42] born in April I could not have been born
[8:45] in May I had to be born in January
[8:48] because that's where my star lay
[8:52] is that right that's why Jesus couldn't
[8:54] be born in December
[8:56] he was the Lamb of God he had to be born
[8:59] in the spring
[9:01] somebody help me that's the truth
[9:03] because the star that represented him
[9:05] was only in that position when he was
[9:08] born
[9:10] so is your stars
[9:15] you know they used to say oh somebody
[9:17] just passed when you see a falling star
[9:19] you ever heard that that's an old
[9:22] that's a fable but it you know I mean
[9:24] people used to say that when I was young
[9:27] or somebody's going to die they that's
[9:29] what they said because they liking it as
[9:31] as a star falling
[9:33] and I think in the age of Egypt when
[9:35] they would see such a thing they thought
[9:36] it was the fall of King in the rise of a
[9:38] king
[9:40] so you know everything has a meaning
[9:43] I'm not an astrologer or anything I
[9:45] don't know nothing about that stuff but
[9:46] I do know one thing that Bible tells us
[9:49] there are lines has gone out through all
[9:51] the Earth and their words to the end of
[9:54] the world in them have he set a
[9:57] tabernacle for the son and basically
[9:59] he's saying everything is connected
[10:03] everything
[10:04] every Sun every Star every Moon every
[10:07] Galaxy whether you see it or not there's
[10:08] a line of some sort connecting them
[10:11] he said which is as a bridegroom coming
[10:13] out of his chamber and rejoices as a
[10:16] strong man to run a race you know
[10:18] brother Brandon preached that right he
[10:20] said when that sun comes up it's like a
[10:22] baby early in the morning this week it's
[10:24] bright it comes on afternoon day it's
[10:26] like a strong man and the evening is
[10:27] really really you know now it's in the
[10:29] evening is now dying out and then it
[10:31] dies and it raises back up what the
[10:34] Bible says it
[10:36] he's going forth his from the end of the
[10:38] heavens and his circuit unto the ends of
[10:41] it and there is nothing hid from the
[10:44] heat thereof
[10:47] Hallelujah and they say the star the son
[10:50] stands still and God says it's on a
[10:52] circuit
[10:53] that's all I'm saying we don't know we
[10:56] don't understand it but I know one thing
[10:58] the Bible is right
[11:00] the law of the Lord is perfect
[11:03] converting the soul the testimony of the
[11:07] Lord is sure making wise to simple you
[11:10] say why are you preaching this brother
[11:12] Brooks
[11:13] because the Lord spoke to my heart
[11:16] when God gives you space to repent and
[11:19] you don't repent he moves on
[11:23] I can't keep preaching repent repent
[11:26] repent
[11:27] because God has a bride he's working
[11:29] with
[11:31] and she's repenting
[11:33] she's doing exactly what his words say
[11:35] do
[11:37] Hallelujah the statue of the laws are
[11:40] right rejoicing the heart the
[11:42] Commandment of the Lord is pure
[11:44] enlightening the eyes the fear of the
[11:47] Lord is clean
[11:49] enduring forever the judgments of the
[11:52] Lord are true and righteous all together
[11:58] right let me let me give you an extra
[12:00] illustration of God's judgment David
[12:05] did what he did with that she
[12:08] and he killed bathsheba's husband
[12:11] and God
[12:13] in his order could have come down
[12:15] because David was a prayer Warrior God
[12:17] could have come down and said David you
[12:19] was wrong
[12:20] but God even was subject to his own
[12:22] order
[12:23] he had a prophet in the land so he had
[12:26] to go by way of the Prophet to go to
[12:29] David
[12:31] you see what I'm saying and said David
[12:33] there's a man in your kingdom
[12:36] who took somebody you lamb that's all he
[12:39] had dressed and fed it treated like his
[12:42] own and guess what a man came by and
[12:45] took it and and killed it and used it
[12:47] for his own service David said that man
[12:50] ought to die
[12:52] you see his judgment was harsh more hard
[12:56] amen than God's judgment was
[12:59] and that's what happens sometimes amen
[13:02] our judgment is harsh but God's judgment
[13:04] is loving kindness
[13:07] I mean you know what I'm saying to his
[13:09] seed
[13:11] ah it's the truth he had already judged
[13:14] Peter and said Peter you're going to
[13:15] deny me three times and see because
[13:17] you're going to deny me I'm going to
[13:19] take the keys back no
[13:23] he told Peter those things so Peter
[13:26] could see how Wicked he was
[13:29] perhaps that's what helped him at the
[13:31] day of Pentecost to get the Holy Ghost
[13:34] all I know is that God always works in
[13:37] your favor the Bible said all things
[13:39] work together for the good of them that
[13:41] love the Lord that's the world order of
[13:43] God no weapon formed against you shall
[13:46] prosper that's the order of God
[13:49] Hallelujah it may look like they're
[13:52] getting away but God will meet them at a
[13:56] time they think not
[13:58] is that right oh God always hard in the
[14:01] hearts of your enemy
[14:03] yeah they become like a pharaoh to you
[14:07] but you know Pharaoh got drowned in the
[14:09] mercy
[14:11] they got plenty of songs he got drowned
[14:15] in the Red Sea right but God allowed
[14:18] those things to happen so that you can
[14:20] understand and see him as God
[14:25] a lot of times it ain't the devil
[14:28] is God
[14:29] working in your life to perfect you
[14:34] trust the Lord with all your heart and
[14:38] lean not to your own understanding
[14:40] acknowledge the Lord in all your ways
[14:44] and he shall direct your path order it
[14:47] if you want to say it
[14:49] Hallelujah
[14:53] thank you Jesus
[14:55] Hallelujah
[15:00] Hallelujah
[15:02] more to be desired are they than gold
[15:07] yay then much fine gold sweeter also
[15:11] than honey in in the honeycomb and I
[15:14] feel like I'm taking some sweetness
[15:16] tonight amen moreover by them as thy
[15:20] servant warned and in keeping of them
[15:22] there is a great reward see what I'm
[15:25] saying that's his judgment he warns you
[15:28] and by keeping them he says there is a
[15:31] great reward
[15:34] oh
[15:36] Lord have mercy so when the Devil comes
[15:38] to try to tempt you against your arm I'm
[15:41] Gonna Keep the word cause I'm looking
[15:42] for my reward
[15:46] Hallelujah who can understand this era
[15:49] cleanse thou me from Secret faults
[15:55] listen I got some secrets
[15:59] false I got some things I'm yet still
[16:02] doing
[16:03] did that take away from him being the
[16:05] Son of God did that take away from him
[16:07] being a king
[16:09] no
[16:12] Hallelujah but what was so mighty about
[16:14] this King he was humble enough to say
[16:17] Lord I got a problem
[16:19] Lord I got some secret stuff going on
[16:21] and please deliver me from these secret
[16:23] faults
[16:26] come on somebody keep back the servant
[16:29] also whom from presumptuous sin
[16:32] let them not have dominion over me
[16:35] is that right that's what Jesus Christ
[16:37] died for that sin will no longer have
[16:41] dominion over you if you got something
[16:43] amen that's constantly amen overruling
[16:46] you and overriding on you you have a
[16:49] right
[16:50] to take it to the Lord in prayer
[16:52] Hallelujah says Lord you said sin will
[16:57] not have dominion over me
[16:59] Hallelujah and you're the king of all
[17:02] Kings
[17:03] hallelujah
[17:05] amen amen then shall I be upright and I
[17:09] shall be innocent from the great
[17:10] transgression Hallelujah this is what he
[17:13] says let the words of my mouth and the
[17:18] meditation of my heart be accepted in
[17:22] thy sight O Lord my strength in my
[17:26] redeemer
[17:28] Hallelujah God's order right God's order
[17:32] and we must understand in God's order
[17:34] he's always separating the darkness from
[17:36] the light
[17:38] Hallelujah you love the Lord amen coming
[17:41] from the message
[17:43] amen uh uh exposition of the seven
[17:46] Church ages amen what God talks about
[17:49] separating from the light and you and I
[17:51] must understand the only way that you've
[17:53] become separators that you've got to
[17:55] become a believer
[17:56] not a make-believer you got to believe
[17:58] it
[17:59] you know a lot of people
[18:01] look at the days of Noah and you think
[18:04] why didn't they believe look how
[18:07] what Noah was preaching
[18:09] seemed impossible
[18:11] how can this ever be
[18:13] we've never seen what you call Rain
[18:16] water coming from it no we've never seen
[18:18] that and you build in this big old Bowl
[18:21] and you're saying that water is going to
[18:23] flood the whole earth you see how
[18:26] impossible you see how listen with that
[18:29] intellectual mind that the people had in
[18:32] that day it was impossible for anybody
[18:36] to make believe that they believed it
[18:40] oh they couldn't that give had to come
[18:44] from God
[18:45] and look what he came I ended up with he
[18:48] may have had a mega church at the
[18:49] beginning because everybody loved loved
[18:51] to hear different stuff
[18:54] even the day the itching is they want to
[18:57] hear all kinds of stuff you know the
[18:58] Bible said this is the day that people
[19:00] love for the preachers to preach their
[19:01] eyes to them
[19:04] the Bible says that the people even know
[19:08] that they're lying but they love to hear
[19:09] it
[19:10] because it gives them a comfort they
[19:13] don't want to change because they can't
[19:14] change Hallelujah and they'd rather have
[19:18] a preacher preacher than lies and tell
[19:19] them all you're going to make it you're
[19:20] going to make it and they know within
[19:22] their souls they're not going to make it
[19:24] but they try to comfort themselves
[19:31] this is what the prophet said
[19:33] now why does God call and I'm skipping a
[19:36] lot of things I've got to move this way
[19:37] why does God call these churches his
[19:41] churches even though
[19:43] they are the false Vine the truth of the
[19:47] matter is that they are Christians but
[19:50] they are not Christians of the spirit
[19:53] they are Christians of the flesh they
[19:56] are bearing the name in vain Mark 7 7
[20:00] says how be it in vain do they worship
[20:03] me teaching the doctrine of and
[20:06] Commandments of men but indeed they are
[20:09] Christians for what else could they be
[20:12] is a Muhammad
[20:15] that is his religion no matter how he
[20:18] lives if because he subscribes in theory
[20:21] to what the Quran teaches in the same
[20:25] way a Christian is a Christian as long
[20:27] as he subscribes to the fact that Jesus
[20:29] is the son of God born of a virgin was
[20:32] crucified and died and rose again that
[20:35] he is savior of mankind Etc in fact in
[20:39] the lay of the sin age there will be
[20:41] those who call themselves Christians
[20:43] because they've subscribe to Divine
[20:46] qualities of Jesus while reserving
[20:49] themselves the right to deny his deity
[20:52] Christian Science have done that already
[20:55] as well as multitudes who preaches a
[20:58] social gospel he is a nominal Christian
[21:01] and belonged to the church but he is not
[21:05] a true or spiritual believer that kind
[21:09] of believer is one who has been baptized
[21:12] into the body of Christ and is a member
[21:15] of him
[21:16] but nonetheless it is in God's order
[21:20] that the tears grow with the wheat and
[21:24] they are not to be uprooted that is the
[21:27] Commandment of God their day for binding
[21:30] and burning is coming but not yet
[21:35] you see
[21:36] and we worry we go through all of this
[21:39] we all the people in church what about
[21:40] people in church I don't know who you
[21:42] are
[21:43] but I don't have the authority to uproot
[21:45] nobody he said let them grow together
[21:49] and God will do it
[21:51] so the spirit is speaking to the mixed
[21:53] group
[21:54] on the one hand he is praising and on
[21:58] the other hand he is rebuking he has
[22:00] told what is right with the True
[22:03] Believer now he warns what the false
[22:06] Vine must do if it is to stand Justified
[22:09] before the Lord so he's a just God he
[22:13] tells the truth and he tells what is
[22:16] required let's go back to the to Genesis
[22:19] he told Cain what was required he was a
[22:23] different Vine he was a different man
[22:26] came from a different dad and but there
[22:29] was nothing in him that could repent
[22:31] there was nothing in him that could be
[22:34] real
[22:35] even though he was religious he did all
[22:38] the religious things but he could not
[22:41] catch the revelation of the blood of
[22:44] Jesus Christ that's why I love that song
[22:47] tonight I was electrified amen when we
[22:50] say nothing but the blood of Jesus what
[22:52] can wash away my sins nothing but the
[22:55] blood of Jesus what can make me whole
[22:58] again nothing but the blood of Jesus oh
[23:01] how precious is the flow
[23:03] that makes me white as snow see it ain't
[23:07] me it's his blood it's his life his
[23:10] anointing that makes me who I am
[23:12] listen and we've got to come up to this
[23:15] anointing now we too start you in this
[23:17] place
[23:18] hello somebody we're too starchy in this
[23:22] place and I'm gonna tell you something
[23:23] you can never get out of order as long
[23:26] as you're in the spirit of God
[23:29] let me let me let me read something
[23:31] brother Randall said here amen coming
[23:33] from the message infallible proof of his
[23:36] resurrection Hallelujah 1957.
[23:41] um
[23:43] he talks about the brooding the brooding
[23:45] what was happening in in the beginning
[23:47] of time when God brewed over the Earth
[23:50] he said the word brooding means making
[23:54] love
[23:55] and when the Holy Spirit made love to
[23:58] the calcium and potash petroleum of the
[24:01] earth and formed it together and made a
[24:04] human being out of it then in return as
[24:06] human beings recognized him and and
[24:09] makes love back to him with a promise
[24:12] that he would raise up in the last days
[24:14] and what kind of Faith should we have
[24:17] all the fear is taken away why you can
[24:21] bury me in the sea but the trumpet will
[24:23] wake me
[24:25] no matter where how far what take place
[24:29] we are going to come from the Dust
[24:33] y'all hear me amen it's not about you
[24:35] it's God's order if God is saying he's
[24:38] going to change this Mortal body amen
[24:41] into more immortality nothing can stop
[24:44] him
[24:45] now improve with God gave us the
[24:48] consolation that through the righteous
[24:51] Son of God right who shared his blood
[24:54] never like to use the name split because
[24:57] split is a is an accident he never
[25:01] accidentally done it he knowed what he
[25:03] was doing and he did it for for a
[25:06] purpose and he shed his blood freely as
[25:10] Calvary giving his his god-given gift
[25:13] give given blood now I'm gonna go back
[25:15] to brooding just for a moment you know
[25:17] if you ever seen people and they just
[25:19] praising God oh hallelujah hallelujah
[25:21] what is the holy spirit doing he's
[25:23] brewing over them he's watching them
[25:26] he's cleaning them he's doing something
[25:28] you can't hear him talking but the
[25:30] person that's in that brewing in that
[25:32] anointing can hear him speak
[25:35] Hallelujah and the reason that God
[25:37] requires blood and the lamb was fought
[25:40] and told me from making a perpetuation
[25:42] for our sins in a shallow form but never
[25:46] could take away sin because the blood of
[25:49] animals couldn't atone for the sin of
[25:51] man it was only a type because the
[25:54] worshiper was purged from would have no
[25:57] more conscience or desire of sin in this
[26:01] case the worshiper once purged has no
[26:04] more desire of sin we don't desire it
[26:08] but the reason why we fall because of
[26:10] sin in the flesh
[26:13] Hallelujah but our soul always want to
[26:16] do right
[26:17] Hallelujah the sin question settled when
[26:20] the Holy Ghost come into the human heart
[26:22] it casts down reasoning it goes above
[26:26] our intellectual Affair now today the
[26:28] reason so many ups and downs and things
[26:31] are are entered the religious people
[26:33] because there's an intellectual concept
[26:35] of Christ in other words it's in their
[26:38] mind and not in their heart see it they
[26:41] just mentally believe it and your Mentor
[26:44] will reason could it be so could Divine
[26:47] Healing be so could the baptism and holy
[26:49] spirit be so now that's the intellectual
[26:52] reason but when that comes into the
[26:55] heart it's a faith it's a positive
[26:59] there's no question at all about it it's
[27:02] all settled forever it's in your heart
[27:06] and your heart doesn't reason because
[27:09] it's the throne that dwell in place of
[27:12] the almighty in the heart
[27:15] huh it doesn't reason God doesn't reason
[27:18] his word
[27:19] God is a amen hallelujah yes sir this is
[27:25] God's order now God's order is the blood
[27:27] there I don't care how much religion you
[27:30] have I don't care how long you've gone
[27:33] to church pay your tithes your offering
[27:35] I'm telling you you've got to have the
[27:38] blood of Jesus Christ applied this is
[27:41] God order when I see the blood I'll pass
[27:44] over you we know he's not dealing with
[27:46] the litter of blood anymore but it's the
[27:48] Holy Ghost which is the life of the
[27:51] blood Hallelujah not Amen in the outer
[27:54] Court not in the inner Court it has to
[27:57] be in the holies of holies where that
[28:00] true heart is amen listen in the message
[28:04] Hallelujah God provided way
[28:06] 1964. brother random said it like this
[28:09] God recommends this for his children
[28:13] God recommend this for believing
[28:16] children he did not intellectual
[28:18] speeches not some great theology the
[28:22] theology to teach he wants you to cry
[28:26] for your knees
[28:29] that's right cry out for it you're too
[28:33] stiff
[28:34] and start you you'll never get it if you
[28:38] are ready to limber yourself up a little
[28:41] and cry God will give it to you he's
[28:44] like to hear his children cry
[28:47] your knees to God God wants it that's
[28:51] his provided way cry out for it that's
[28:55] the way the baby cries that's the way he
[28:58] wants you to cry cry how long how long
[29:01] does a baby cry until he gets satisfied
[29:05] and that's the way the believing
[29:07] Christians should do God's child if you
[29:10] see that God made the promise don't give
[29:13] it up cry until it answers
[29:16] cry until you go till you see God
[29:19] vindicate his word when God vindicates
[29:21] his word and proves it here then you
[29:24] don't have to cry no more you got it
[29:26] walk away and thank him for it until you
[29:29] do that scream out till you get it I
[29:32] like that persistent holding on not a
[29:37] hybrid plant not one that has to baby
[29:40] and Petty and pack around Christians are
[29:43] real
[29:44] genuine born articles of God they fight
[29:48] for their position fight till they're
[29:51] finished on this Earth every move of it
[29:54] is a fight
[29:56] that's God's order
[29:58] and you know we've had these
[30:00] intellectual teachers amen that took all
[30:03] of that from us
[30:07] took it away
[30:09] you don't have to do all of that we're
[30:10] in another age yes we are but I'm gonna
[30:13] tell you something before you can get
[30:15] any other age you got to get a new one
[30:18] the one before you
[30:20] you got to be born again and you got to
[30:22] have the Holy Ghost
[30:24] and brother William said there's only
[30:26] one way Acts 2 38 babies know how to
[30:29] come forth that's screaming and Hauling
[30:32] right they don't like that in the church
[30:34] no more everything is too quiet too
[30:37] stiff this church got to change the
[30:40] people around here must change
[30:42] Hallelujah don't worry about what your
[30:44] neighbor is saying don't worry about
[30:46] who's looking at you amen you got to
[30:48] close everybody out and become you and
[30:50] Jesus
[30:52] God's order
[30:54] is that right he said you can try to
[30:56] teach a baby how to do things when they
[30:59] come to his mom say you can ring the
[31:00] bell or whatever you want to do call his
[31:02] name it won't ever work that baby has
[31:04] one way of of getting Mama attention and
[31:07] that's crying
[31:08] that's the way it is with God
[31:11] Hallelujah
[31:13] say I don't know how to cry you ask God
[31:15] he'll give it to you
[31:17] you stay there and he'll bring it on you
[31:19] amen but crying ain't gonna do you no
[31:21] good either if it's not coming from your
[31:22] heart
[31:25] you know actors can cry
[31:27] right but this got to come from the
[31:29] heart
[31:30] oh yes Jesus that was fresh folks that
[31:33] was fresh amen
[31:36] especially about the actors that's
[31:37] pretty good hey right Amos 3 7 God
[31:40] hasn't provided way
[31:42] surely the Lord God will do nothing
[31:45] but he Reveals His Secrets unto his
[31:47] servants the prophet Prophet we know how
[31:49] that is
[31:50] Hallelujah when there's a prophet in the
[31:52] land god comes by way the prophet
[31:54] Hallelujah who's going to tell Noah how
[31:56] to build Ark who is going to refuse you
[31:59] know me everybody that refused Noah
[32:01] message drowned
[32:02] everybody that refused Moses wet message
[32:05] got killed
[32:07] right listen there's an order
[32:10] God can talk to us and he does talk to
[32:12] us personally but my point is when it
[32:15] comes to his order he must set things
[32:17] back in order remember Elijah had to put
[32:20] the altar back in order
[32:22] right because they hadn't had that it
[32:24] was it was torn down but he had to
[32:27] re-establish the order so that you can
[32:29] understand alter so that you can
[32:30] understand that the altar is is not just
[32:33] wood and and stuff it's your heart
[32:37] it's your heart that's where your art
[32:39] the real all of that was it was shadows
[32:41] and type but now God wants to enter in
[32:44] you he wants you to be the Tabernacle he
[32:46] wants you to be the holies of holies
[32:49] where he sets in your heart
[32:52] that's the order and the only way you
[32:54] can get him there is through
[32:56] justification sanctification baptism the
[32:59] Holy Ghost and then you got to mature
[33:00] into Christ
[33:02] God's church is built upon divine
[33:04] revelation we didn't understand that
[33:06] this is why how so many theologians are
[33:09] so mixed up because they're so
[33:10] intellectual and they don't even believe
[33:12] in Revelation but listen God built his
[33:14] church Upon This Rock I'll build my
[33:17] church and the Gates of Hell shall not
[33:18] Prevail against it right listen you
[33:21] think about what I'm trying to say
[33:24] I believe the church is built upon
[33:26] divine revelation
[33:28] Hallelujah you remember you remember uh
[33:31] let me let me read this this quote it's
[33:33] another one Elijah and the prophet Amen
[33:35] 1956. brother William said as she was
[33:38] inspired talking about the shunamite
[33:39] woman to do something for this man I can
[33:43] hear her say one day to her husband
[33:46] now look dear
[33:48] well we can do this we have plenty we
[33:52] have great farms and so forth we're able
[33:55] to do this and what was it the shooter
[33:57] might want to build a little room for
[33:59] Elijah and the husband said we can do
[34:01] this we can afford it amen you know what
[34:04] people don't understand is that uh
[34:07] how you treat each other
[34:09] there's always a reward for it
[34:11] not that you're doing it for the reward
[34:14] because a True Believer never think
[34:15] about what's coming after they just do
[34:18] it
[34:18] right amen and I I just say I don't know
[34:21] what God is getting ready to do but I'll
[34:23] just say for those both of the churches
[34:25] from from Iowa City and here in the
[34:27] morning and how they blessed me the
[34:29] other day I mean to me I don't know what
[34:31] God is going to do but I really believe
[34:32] a blessing is coming
[34:35] yes I mean they did it because my my
[34:38] sister died and all that but it was it
[34:40] was wonderful
[34:43] and to see all those people crowding my
[34:45] house on Saturday and Sunday
[34:47] it was wonderful
[34:49] I can't even get all of them at church
[34:51] one time
[34:54] but to know listen the atmosphere was
[34:56] awesome
[34:58] and I really believe God has a special
[35:00] blessing for that
[35:02] didn't do it for a blessing
[35:05] but I believe a blessing is coming he's
[35:07] the judge his judgment is true his
[35:10] judgment is real and if there be
[35:13] anything I ask God that he would bless
[35:15] him with and that would be the fill us
[35:16] all with the Holy Ghost
[35:18] give us a Revival in this church
[35:21] Hallelujah that's what we want
[35:24] if I had anything to do with it I want
[35:26] to see everybody born again
[35:28] Hallelujah she was inspired we have
[35:32] plenty now we both believe in Jehovah
[35:35] and this is his servant now let's do
[35:38] something nice for him and in doing for
[35:41] him we're doing for Jehovah after all
[35:44] you're getting aged and I'm in the
[35:46] middle aging so it won't be long till it
[35:49] all falls somewhere and we have no
[35:52] children or nothing to go to so let's
[35:55] just do something nice for Jehovah by
[35:58] entering his PR uh entertaining his
[36:00] Prophet you see what they did
[36:02] they didn't say let's do something for
[36:04] Elijah they said let's do something for
[36:06] Jehovah that's that's the revelation of
[36:09] it
[36:10] like when you when you when you're doing
[36:12] something for each other you're doing it
[36:14] for Jesus
[36:15] you're not doing for brother so and so
[36:17] or sister so and so you're doing it as
[36:19] unto the Lord
[36:21] and when you do it eyes unto the Lord
[36:23] whatever you reap whatever you sow
[36:25] you're going to read that's God's law
[36:28] that's God's order
[36:30] Hallelujah she knew that God was in the
[36:33] God was in that this prophet and she
[36:35] wanted to give respect to God and the
[36:37] only way she could give respect to God
[36:39] was respect the servant of God see
[36:42] that's the problem there's so many
[36:44] people in the message in this church in
[36:46] that church that don't know how to
[36:48] respect the Servants of the Lord but I
[36:50] believe God saw something God put
[36:53] something in their heart
[36:54] and I tell you to that Saturday and
[36:57] Sunday was the most respect I had ever
[36:58] seen since I've been pastoring
[37:01] these churches
[37:03] and the only way we you can give respect
[37:05] to God was to respect the servant of God
[37:07] now friends that's the way you do it
[37:11] is when you respect God's order
[37:14] that's true
[37:16] you love the Lord
[37:17] ah so much more I could I could preach
[37:20] it's just 8 47 can I go on
[37:22] so that you understand you can't put new
[37:25] wine in Old bottles
[37:28] well that's that's the problem with a
[37:30] lot of people they they want to carry
[37:31] things over carry this over we've got
[37:33] methodists in the message Catholics in
[37:35] the message
[37:36] Baptist in the message Pentecost in the
[37:38] message and and they don't want to go no
[37:40] further but this this message came for
[37:42] us to clean up everything
[37:44] it's got to be a new bottle you got to
[37:46] get rid of everything really everything
[37:47] Hey listen new wine it can only be put
[37:50] in new new Pentecostal bottles
[37:54] it's amazing all those bottles
[37:55] Pentecostals
[37:57] God had 120 of them gathered into the
[38:00] upper room after he had all by his word
[38:04] and has softened up and had renewed and
[38:08] got all that oh I thought Orthodoxy out
[38:11] of them
[38:12] all of the old system and God had 120
[38:17] bottles laying in the upper room when
[38:19] with their necks up and a funnel on the
[38:22] top
[38:24] and when the Holy Spirit began to Reign
[38:27] these bottles got so alive until they
[38:30] began to run outside preaching the
[38:33] gospel bouncing from place to place and
[38:36] one jumped on a stump and said this is
[38:39] that
[38:40] right back with the word this is that
[38:43] which was spoken by the prophet Joelle
[38:45] it shall come to pass in the last day
[38:48] said God I'll pour out my spirit my new
[38:51] wine into my new bottles water revival
[38:55] they were having that's God's order here
[38:58] comes a couple of bottles of it amen
[39:00] bursting bad and they're laid an
[39:03] Afflicted man and when this Afflicted
[39:06] man touched their hands of one of these
[39:08] why his afflicted left hand and he and
[39:11] God's and he got some of it and began
[39:15] leaping and praising God and running
[39:17] into the temple shouting and glorifying
[39:19] God you know the Holy Ghost can't change
[39:24] the Holy Ghost does not change
[39:27] brother Adam said no matter which where
[39:29] where you go when the Holy Ghost fall it
[39:32] makes the people act the same way
[39:37] something's wrong
[39:39] something's wrong
[39:43] um
[39:44] we don't love him like we used to
[39:47] somehow we don't forgot how good it used
[39:49] to be
[39:52] he said that's God's order now then
[39:55] tonight you believe that that's God's
[39:57] order that's not man so if God is
[40:00] ordered it he can't change his mind
[40:02] about the order
[40:04] not a big school with a degree but a
[40:07] living acting experience of the Holy
[40:09] Spirit not fanaticism but the real
[40:11] genuine Holy Spirit put in action may
[40:15] you see it is my prayer
[40:18] huh making love up to the Holy Ghost how
[40:21] long has been since the Holy Ghost has
[40:23] fallen in this place and all we could do
[40:26] is just oh Lord have you remember that
[40:28] one day not long ago is it like
[40:30] everybody was on one Accord that was
[40:32] such a beautiful nobody wanted to leave
[40:34] that was just just a tip tip
[40:37] it could go way beyond that
[40:39] Hallelujah
[40:42] oh my can you imagine people don't even
[40:45] want to they don't even look for days
[40:46] like that no more when the sick come in
[40:48] they be healed
[40:50] the Bible said thus said the Lord if
[40:53] there'll be among your sick call for the
[40:57] elders let them anoint them with all and
[40:59] pray for them the by the prayer of faith
[41:02] shall save the sick and again it is
[41:04] written in the script that these signs
[41:06] shall follow them that believe they lay
[41:08] hands on the sick they shall recover and
[41:10] we're taught listen my my thing is this
[41:13] I believe the message come to bring us
[41:15] into a maturity but it never come to
[41:18] your race
[41:19] what God has already established it
[41:23] never come to take away God what God's
[41:25] order from things
[41:28] matter of fact we ought to be more
[41:29] mature
[41:30] and have more faith and have more prayer
[41:34] right not wavering like James said
[41:37] mature and to know that every situation
[41:40] is still under God's control
[41:42] Hallelujah is that right that's the way
[41:45] the Church of the Living we should walk
[41:47] up to people sick and everything else no
[41:49] fear
[41:51] well I haven't heard him say anything
[41:53] what are you talking about the Bible
[41:56] didn't already commission you
[41:58] go ye therefore to all the world
[42:00] preaching the gospel and that's what
[42:03] Paul did he said I didn't come with
[42:05] Excellence of speech I came with power
[42:07] and demonstration that's the gospel
[42:13] doesn't mean that the individual listen
[42:15] what President says he said it doesn't
[42:16] mean that the individual that is praying
[42:19] must be a saint or an angel
[42:22] it means that that person that's coming
[42:24] must have faith
[42:27] in their own being that the Holy Spirit
[42:30] and his cooing by his word has dropped a
[42:33] little something in there that makes
[42:35] them believe that he will Brew over them
[42:39] until they are well
[42:42] um
[42:44] Hallelujah
[42:47] yeah I guess I'll I'm gonna cut it short
[42:51] but I'm a
[42:54] listen what the scripture says according
[42:56] to Romans 8 and 11. but if the spirit of
[42:59] him that raised up Jesus from the dead
[43:01] dwell in you he that raised of Christ
[43:03] from the dead shall also Quicken your
[43:05] mortal bodies by his spirit that
[43:07] dwelleth in you so am I say like this
[43:11] the reason why God had to come
[43:14] in 1963 in the way that he did come
[43:18] because laodicea had gotten out of order
[43:23] they used to be the church
[43:26] you understand me they represent bastard
[43:30] and vastly had all the gifts
[43:33] vasty was beautiful God
[43:36] bragged on vasty did not King of hasura
[43:40] brag on vasty
[43:43] she had it all
[43:45] but she failed to come at the king's
[43:48] call
[43:49] they looked at William Branham and
[43:51] thought it was just a man but it was God
[43:52] calling later to see a cop come on vasty
[43:56] I want to show the world she has no idea
[43:58] how great she would have been
[44:00] has she come to the call
[44:03] Hallelujah but then there was a little
[44:05] girl about you know didn't have a a a a
[44:09] known name
[44:16] and we know her her uncle was Mordecai
[44:22] and here
[44:25] a little girl I'm trying to think of her
[44:27] name I can't think I know I know Esther
[44:29] but I'm trying to think of the name
[44:30] before then
[44:31] Odessa yes
[44:34] couldn't couldn't couldn't couldn't
[44:35] couldn't nobody knew who she was that's
[44:37] who
[44:40] somebody didn't know I knew her but God
[44:43] did
[44:44] who was judging all of that
[44:47] he thought oh they were the judge he
[44:49] probably had all kinds of Judges there
[44:51] God had already judged
[44:53] he knew
[44:55] Odessa was going to be the queen
[45:00] he knew that before before she even got
[45:02] there he knew that what was it God's
[45:05] order
[45:06] God was doing something typing and
[45:09] shadowing and making people act in
[45:11] certain ways so that we this day can
[45:14] look back and says we got victory is
[45:17] already in the word
[45:20] we don't need to be popular
[45:22] and you know this is the truth because
[45:24] vasty was having her own party
[45:27] right
[45:28] and that's what the Pentecostal churches
[45:30] were doing they were having their own
[45:31] parties they were having their own
[45:33] revivals and guess what they even shut
[45:35] the king out
[45:37] here they was here he was on the in the
[45:39] third chapter of Revelation knocking
[45:40] trying to get in
[45:45] thank God for Odessa
[45:48] who became Esther
[45:50] Hallelujah and Esther had to go through
[45:53] something to find her position but she
[45:55] found her position
[45:58] Hallelujah I'm closing we which are
[46:02] alive and remain
[46:04] shall not prevent or hinder those that
[46:08] are asleep
[46:09] dead for the trumpet of God shall sound
[46:12] the dead in Christ shall rise we which
[46:15] Our Lives shall shall be changed in a
[46:18] moment or twinkling of eye and the old
[46:21] man will be young the old woman will be
[46:23] young again and will be
[46:27] conditioned to meet
[46:30] the promise coming son Glory Hallelujah
[46:34] the next thing in God's order
[46:37] do y'all understand
[46:39] that's the next thing in God's order I
[46:44] I'll have to finish this later on
[46:46] but brother Brown said God's order to
[46:48] men is stay in his place
[46:52] God ordered to the woman stay in their
[46:54] place too you can't take a man's place
[46:57] they're trying to do it but don't do it
[47:01] men don't take the Woman's Place don't
[47:04] dress like women and women don't dress
[47:06] like men the Bible says it's wrong to do
[47:09] that the Bible said a woman that puts on
[47:12] a garment pertaining to a man is filthy
[47:15] before God an Abomination see but now
[47:18] you can't hardly tell one from the other
[47:21] see now how are you going to do but just
[47:24] call out against it see well when you do
[47:28] that see did you see the courts the
[47:30] other day now hear the prophet of saying
[47:32] something here this is this is this is
[47:34] this is really bad here in Indiana this
[47:38] is a long time ago what a shame less
[47:40] than 15 years ago a family were in Port
[47:43] Fulton I think some of the families
[47:45] sitting here tonight here in Port Fulton
[47:47] they sent a girl a little girl home from
[47:50] school for wearing for wearing shorts to
[47:53] school
[47:56] they said to home
[47:57] in my day
[47:59] you couldn't wear shorts to school
[48:01] in my day a girl could not wear pants to
[48:04] school
[48:05] in my day
[48:07] for girl wore a dress above her knee she
[48:09] was sent home
[48:10] now this is the South we call it the
[48:12] Bible Belt but that's that was when
[48:14] things were moral
[48:16] that's not too long ago
[48:18] now you can't get a girl in a dress
[48:22] and what they call shorts is not shorts
[48:24] they're underwear
[48:26] right
[48:27] but they sent this little girl home from
[48:29] school
[48:30] for wearing shorts or scoots this week
[48:32] they tried to Sue and put out
[48:35] put out of the school and they did it a
[48:38] little girl that refused to wear shorts
[48:40] in school
[48:42] what's the matter with our nation I
[48:44] thought this was this was a land of free
[48:47] I thought we had a right religious
[48:49] freedom the father stood up and said
[48:51] it's against our religion Rich religious
[48:54] belief for our children to wear shorts
[48:57] our little girls like 16 and 17 years
[49:00] old to wear shorts it's against our
[49:03] religion belief and they dismissed it it
[49:06] spelled the child from the school
[49:08] for for not where and I that was in my
[49:10] school too there were people who was in
[49:12] the Holiness Church who would not dress
[49:14] out for Jim because it was in a man and
[49:17] women and they they they they they uh
[49:20] they was uh suspended
[49:23] or pretty much expelled if they wouldn't
[49:25] change their mind I understand that
[49:27] everybody that won't won't agree uh and
[49:31] come in to the international agreement
[49:33] of this Fellowship that they're trying
[49:35] to form to put unite all churches
[49:37] together the Federation of churches
[49:39] that's all that want come in and Unite
[49:41] with it they make him a little Province
[49:44] they're going to send them to Alaska
[49:47] did you hear what he said they're making
[49:49] them a province and they're going to
[49:51] send them to Alaska you might as well
[49:54] get ready for cold weather
[49:56] because look like it's coming
[49:58] that's what they're going to do to the
[49:59] true Christians
[50:01] my lifelong friend Jim Poole his his son
[50:05] stands here tonight I wish his dad would
[50:08] only come in and do what his son did and
[50:11] we were talking today by telephone
[50:12] conversation and he was remarking about
[50:15] I believe a new uh commentator someone I
[50:18] don't remember just who it was he says
[50:21] now it used to be that that America
[50:23] people
[50:24] taking a bath and that's the truth
[50:27] American people taking a bath once a
[50:31] week and prayed every day
[50:34] I know that's true we took Baths on
[50:37] Saturdays
[50:38] once a week
[50:42] um
[50:43] and we didn't have a bathtub at the time
[50:45] we had a foot tub
[50:47] y'all know the footage of is one of
[50:49] those bigger tubs you put the hot water
[50:50] in no drainage to you you always want to
[50:53] be the first one
[50:55] because we watched with the lasso and
[50:57] all that dirt come up and you know
[50:59] scrape it off
[51:02] sanitation folks sanitation but that's
[51:05] the way it used to be
[51:07] and we bathe on Saturdays so we can go
[51:10] to church on Sunday
[51:12] clean right
[51:14] American people taking a bath once a
[51:16] week and prayed every day he said now
[51:19] they take a bath every day and pray once
[51:21] a week
[51:25] I believe it's rather no do without the
[51:28] bathroom brother I said I believe I
[51:29] would rather do without the bath but
[51:32] just show how we have fallen what
[51:35] happened to this nation
[51:39] hmm
[51:41] I gotta stop here
[51:43] but what has happened
[51:45] we're out of order
[51:49] we're out of order
[51:52] and God is trying to put us in order
[51:55] that's why it's so important for people
[51:58] to come to church because judgment
[51:59] begins at the house of God
[52:02] it's so important that people come and
[52:04] hear the word
[52:06] you don't even know when you're doing
[52:07] wrong sometime unless God comes because
[52:10] now the word is going Beyond
[52:12] this outer court is going into the
[52:15] holies of holies where your heart is
[52:17] because I'm going to tell you something
[52:18] when as long as you think God is
[52:20] punishing you
[52:22] you need to grow
[52:23] God is Not punishing his children
[52:25] God don't punish his children
[52:27] God May chasten you because the Bible
[52:30] said that he's chasing them whom he
[52:31] loved amen
[52:33] but punish you no
[52:35] it's like some kids you know when you
[52:37] when you whip them if you don't explain
[52:39] to them why they're whipping you uh
[52:41] whipping them they're going to thank you
[52:43] you're just being mean and you're
[52:44] punishing them
[52:45] you need to explain and then after you
[52:48] spank them you still need to hold true
[52:50] to what you just told them you're not
[52:52] going to play that game for another week
[52:55] or two but I said I'm sorry well it's
[52:58] got to go beyond that you need to
[53:00] understand
[53:02] why you're sorry
[53:05] in other words I'm trying to bring you
[53:07] to a repentance so that what you just
[53:09] did will not happen again
[53:12] that's the way God has been doing with
[53:14] us
[53:16] explaining to us talk to us and then you
[53:19] know when you don't listen he said and I
[53:20] did not tell you not to do that again
[53:22] pop right he comes along and give you a
[53:25] good spanking
[53:29] yeah sometimes it's a form of sickness
[53:31] sometimes it's a form of something some
[53:34] God he go he knows how to get to you
[53:35] let's stand I'm sorry I know I've taken
[53:37] the time but we appreciate you
[53:40] uh this is just the beginning I've got
[53:42] so many other things I'd like to
[53:43] contribute to the order of God because
[53:46] we want God's order in our lives we want
[53:49] to be just what God wants us to be
[53:52] and I really appreciate the Lord Jesus
[53:54] Christ for being good to us today
[53:56] tonight
[54:01] David said let the words of my mouth
