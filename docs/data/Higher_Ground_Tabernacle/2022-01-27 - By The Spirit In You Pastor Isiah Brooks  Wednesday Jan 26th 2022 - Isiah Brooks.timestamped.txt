[14:54] appreciate you all coming out in this
[14:56] cold weather amen
[15:00] but i feel like when we do our daily
[15:02] chores
[15:03] amen we venture out into the cold
[15:06] so if we do it for the natural we need
[15:08] to do it for the spirit amen amen god is
[15:11] good to us
[15:13] i've gotta this is kind of like a
[15:16] i say things like that and i never
[15:18] follow through but i like to think that
[15:20] i can and i will
[15:24] when it comes to series and all of that
[15:26] i i jump from one place to another but
[15:29] by the grace of god we
[15:32] i was thinking uh since sunday
[15:35] basically uh
[15:37] how
[15:40] how do you
[15:43] express to the people
[15:47] what is required
[15:52] and not only what is required how are we
[15:54] going to
[15:56] uh meet those requirements
[15:58] how can we do it
[16:00] uh so hopefully tonight uh will be the
[16:02] beginning of something where
[16:04] our eyes and uh uh and will be
[16:07] enlightening enlightened in our
[16:09] understanding
[16:10] uh
[16:11] you know will come to a place where
[16:13] we'll know
[16:15] how
[16:17] anyway
[16:18] as we stand
[16:21] let us turn to second peter
[16:30] second peter
[16:32] the third chapter
[16:35] and we'll begin reading at the 17th
[16:38] verse
[16:40] i was told that they had a really good
[16:42] time there in iowa city and so i'm happy
[16:46] for what took place there on sunday and
[16:48] appreciate the brother isaac for
[16:51] the great sacrifice of going down there
[16:54] by god's grace
[17:01] ii peter 3.
[17:07] that must be first pete i think i got it
[17:09] wrong
[17:11] i do i'm in first peter that's why i
[17:13] won't
[17:16] work beginning at the 17th verse
[17:21] he therefore
[17:23] be loved
[17:25] seeing ye know these things be
[17:27] before
[17:29] i would be aware less
[17:31] ye also being led away with the air of
[17:34] the wicked
[17:35] fall from your own steadfastness
[17:39] but grow in grace
[17:42] and in the knowledge of our lord and
[17:45] savior jesus christ
[17:47] to whom be glory both now and forever
[17:51] amen
[17:53] let us pray
[17:55] heavenly father we thank you for your
[17:57] grace and your mercy
[17:59] we thank you for being so real to us
[18:03] without you jesus christ we can do
[18:05] nothing man
[18:07] we understand lord god that
[18:09] everything moves by your power amen you
[18:12] move with us you move in us you move
[18:15] through us
[18:16] and we so thank you father god for being
[18:19] the god that you are
[18:21] knowing that you're the only true
[18:23] and living god
[18:25] and there is no other beside amen amen
[18:28] father i so thank you for your mercy and
[18:30] your grace for
[18:32] that you used to open our eyes and
[18:35] to broaden our understanding of
[18:38] who we are
[18:39] and i pray this night that you would
[18:41] have mercy upon us
[18:43] and open our understanding to the
[18:45] scriptures and i pray father god that
[18:48] even those things that
[18:50] i failed to say that you were quickened
[18:52] amen to the hearts and the minds of your
[18:54] people granted father in your lovely
[18:57] name jesus christ we pray
[19:00] amen
[19:01] you may be seated
[19:04] i was thinking
[19:07] uh
[19:08] and have been thinking about that
[19:10] message that i preached on sunday
[19:13] and uh i can truly say that every bit of
[19:15] it was from god amen
[19:17] and
[19:19] but you know if
[19:21] in the carnal mind in the mind if if you
[19:24] catch it in the wrong
[19:26] uh inspiration
[19:28] you're not you won't understand what god
[19:30] is saying amen
[19:32] let me say it like this it's not him
[19:34] that willeth
[19:36] nor he that running
[19:38] but it's god
[19:40] we'll show his mercy amen
[19:42] and i want you to understand that if you
[19:44] take the message that has been preached
[19:47] and you take it in the legalistic way
[19:50] thinking that you're going to
[19:54] make a man
[19:56] perfect enough to to make heaven
[19:58] you missed it
[20:00] amen
[20:01] the element of this whole entire message
[20:05] is grace
[20:07] and you must understand that it's grace
[20:10] that saves you
[20:11] amen you know the great grace that takes
[20:13] you there amen
[20:15] first of all we're living in the time of
[20:17] the rapture
[20:19] this is why we've been preaching the way
[20:21] we preach and i'm going to take this
[20:23] kind of go with this kind of pace if
[20:24] this is okay
[20:27] and we must understand our understanding
[20:29] of the rapture is not
[20:32] like the denominational understanding of
[20:35] the rapture
[20:37] that we're going we're dealing with an
[20:39] unfair god
[20:41] that he's just going to leave son behind
[20:43] and take some
[20:45] god only takes those whom we
[20:47] predestinated amen and those that
[20:49] belongs to him amen
[20:52] he's not going to steal somebody else's
[20:54] children
[20:56] you understand me
[20:58] he only come for his own amen
[21:01] salvation is only for
[21:03] the children of god
[21:05] and the bible says that the lord knoweth
[21:08] them that are his amen
[21:10] and we must understand that the rapture
[21:12] is as a process we know the bible said
[21:14] in a moment in the twinkling of an eye
[21:16] we're going to be changed
[21:20] but we've got to get to that moment
[21:22] amen
[21:23] and it is a process it's a coming out
[21:27] of egypt
[21:29] going through the wilderness
[21:32] going through canaan land
[21:34] and then possessing your inheritance
[21:38] the children of israel is a sure type
[21:41] of what we call
[21:43] the transition of the rapture that we'll
[21:45] go through
[21:48] uh
[21:49] it's like matthew 28 19.
[21:53] god called five wise and five foolish
[21:58] and of course in the denominational
[22:00] realm we
[22:02] believed for years that the five foolish
[22:05] were lost
[22:07] but until this message we came to find
[22:09] out that the
[22:10] wise and the foolish was made
[22:13] out of the same material
[22:16] but god cut a pattern amen
[22:19] a piece of cloth in a pattern way that
[22:23] that left a remnant amen and that
[22:26] remnant though it be from the same
[22:28] material
[22:30] uh
[22:31] was not included into the pattern amen
[22:35] and if you want to say it like this he
[22:36] cut out a pattern of the bride amen and
[22:40] those that were not included into that
[22:43] pattern were still saved
[22:46] god didn't throw the material away no
[22:48] amen but we find out that god
[22:52] gives them white robes after the great
[22:54] tribulation hallelujah amen
[22:57] so we must understand that
[23:00] sometimes people think that when
[23:03] god said uh
[23:04] two would be in the bed and one taken
[23:07] and the other one left and often time we
[23:10] correlate that to
[23:12] a husband and wife
[23:15] but not necessarily so
[23:17] that's not what the bible says amen
[23:20] two would be in the bed
[23:22] one taken the other one left
[23:25] he did not say two would be in the same
[23:27] bed
[23:29] amen
[23:30] he said two would be in the bed
[23:32] but it brings such a fear on people
[23:35] that's right amen and the insecurity
[23:37] when we
[23:39] add things like that
[23:41] he said there'll be those
[23:43] two in the field
[23:46] one taken
[23:47] and one left
[23:49] and what was he doing he was basically
[23:51] showing the time zones
[23:54] where some would be sleeping
[23:56] others would be working
[23:59] and that's what he was working with
[24:02] one would be a bride and one will not be
[24:04] a bride however it may be
[24:07] god interprets his own word amen
[24:11] but you got to understand this
[24:15] the bible said that
[24:17] god's sheep heareth his voice
[24:21] and a stranger they will not follow
[24:24] and understand when he were talking
[24:26] about strangers
[24:29] he was talking about the pharisees and
[24:31] the sadducees the herodians and all the
[24:33] denominational of those that day amen
[24:37] because you got to realize there were
[24:39] those who could hear his voice those who
[24:41] were
[24:42] in those systems
[24:44] like nicodemus yep amen
[24:47] or like lazarus and his sisters
[24:51] they were orphans but they were in those
[24:53] systems and and and when they heard the
[24:56] voice of jesus they left those systems
[25:00] and followed the shepherd amen
[25:03] a peter james john paul
[25:07] all of them
[25:08] who were so locked into those systems
[25:12] but once they heard the voice of their
[25:15] day
[25:16] amen they moved with that voice amen and
[25:20] god never talks about their failures or
[25:23] their faults
[25:25] but one thing in the new testament we
[25:27] come to realize is that those that were
[25:29] truly chosen of god received the baptism
[25:33] of the holy ghost amen
[25:35] and he started with the least
[25:38] and went all the way up to what the man
[25:39] called saul of paul when one thing about
[25:43] paul a saul he had to humble himself
[25:45] amen and become a fool
[25:48] in so much so paul says i worship in the
[25:51] way they call heresy
[25:53] and that way heresy is called crazy
[25:57] and that was the standard
[26:00] of true believers
[26:02] through the seven church ages amen they
[26:04] worshiped in the way people called crazy
[26:09] the lutherans were crazy to the
[26:11] catholics yep amen is that right the
[26:14] wesleyans were crazy to the lutherans
[26:17] the pentecostals were crazy to the
[26:19] westlands
[26:22] and now those who claim to be in the
[26:23] message
[26:24] are crazy to the pentecostals amen and
[26:28] god continued to move
[26:31] he's a god of progression
[26:34] he never stops amen
[26:38] you understand me
[26:44] how would god require you to do
[26:46] something that he know you can't do
[26:49] for thousands of years men
[26:53] were fallen under the penalty of death
[26:57] so much they hated death they was afraid
[26:59] of death
[27:02] and they understood that their
[27:03] righteousness could never make it
[27:06] amen even those who were under the law
[27:08] they did everything in the love but see
[27:10] they died like almost
[27:12] hoping
[27:14] and only those who had a revelation
[27:18] of what was taking place they understood
[27:20] they'll die in faith
[27:22] believing that the redeemer will come
[27:26] because we need a redeemer
[27:29] amen we need a savior there
[27:31] you understand me the the person
[27:33] redeeming you
[27:35] is the one that receives the honor amen
[27:38] the one who saves you is the one who
[27:40] receives the honor because there's
[27:42] nothing you could do
[27:44] god picked you up like a dirty cop yes
[27:46] sir he justified you amen he cleansed
[27:50] you up like a dirty cop
[27:53] he sanctified you
[27:55] he gave you the holy ghost amen he
[27:58] filled you with his spirit
[28:00] he puts you into service amen this is
[28:03] not a man-made thing
[28:05] amen this is all about the lord jesus
[28:08] christ
[28:11] according to the scripture
[28:14] romans 11 34 says
[28:16] for who have known the mind of god of
[28:19] the lord
[28:21] or who have been his counselor
[28:24] and i love that because
[28:26] how can you cancel god
[28:29] when it comes to your life
[28:31] when you yourself don't know your life
[28:34] you can't govern your life
[28:37] you can't even control what you're doing
[28:39] that's right you need a controller amen
[28:42] this is where the holy ghost comes in
[28:44] amen because you and yourself you can't
[28:47] stop yourself
[28:49] hallelujah it takes god in you
[28:53] to interpret his word through you amen
[28:57] you can say i'm bright all you want to
[29:00] but until the holy ghost comes in
[29:03] and begins to live his life through you
[29:06] that is the only thing that
[29:10] significant evidence i could say
[29:13] when jesus says in that day you'll know
[29:16] i'm in the father the fathers in me and
[29:18] i am you amen
[29:20] ephesians 1 4 says and i'm going to not
[29:22] going to be long
[29:24] but ephesians 4 1 4 says according
[29:28] as he have chosen us
[29:30] in him before the foundation of the
[29:32] world
[29:34] that we should be holy
[29:36] and without blame
[29:38] before him in love this is his high
[29:43] calling
[29:44] this is his standard
[29:47] hallelujah
[29:48] that we would be without blame
[29:52] and how many of us know what how to be
[29:55] holy
[29:57] throughout the church ages
[29:59] they've tried to be holy
[30:02] amen it's true
[30:04] catholics
[30:06] the priests the nuns they dress
[30:10] in a manner that people think is holy
[30:13] that's not the holiness of god amen
[30:17] but people in their minds that get this
[30:19] concept even in the message that if i
[30:22] look poor and destitute
[30:24] and everything is
[30:26] you know not magic or unfitting or
[30:29] whatever the case may be i'm really
[30:31] looking holy that's not holiness
[30:36] amen
[30:37] holiness
[30:39] doesn't even
[30:40] uh
[30:41] care
[30:43] if you're skinny
[30:45] if you're fat
[30:47] if you're tall
[30:49] if you're short
[30:51] if you're ugly
[30:52] if you're handsome
[30:54] if you're beautiful whatever it may be
[30:58] that
[31:01] holiness it just doesn't care
[31:05] because what holiness is is having the
[31:08] holy god on the inside
[31:12] and god doesn't look at your way you
[31:14] look
[31:15] says oh you know that person looked just
[31:17] like i you know yeah you good enough let
[31:19] me go ahead on it
[31:22] it's not that
[31:24] it's that he chose you
[31:27] you were in him amen now a lot of times
[31:30] we we think oh well this natural man was
[31:33] no no no i'm talking about the spirit
[31:36] man amen god is a spirit
[31:39] and they that worship him must worship
[31:41] him in spirit and in truth not just a
[31:45] spirit his spirit
[31:48] see it's god in you
[31:51] as you've heard me say many times it's
[31:54] it's not the mountain that's holy it's
[31:56] the holy god on the mountain
[32:00] is that right your flesh
[32:03] could never enter heaven
[32:05] no matter how good you live on earth
[32:08] amen
[32:09] no matter how you keep yourself you can
[32:12] walk perfectly listen paul said i was
[32:15] blameless
[32:17] there was nothing in my life that
[32:19] somebody could point to and said i'd
[32:21] done wrong
[32:22] hello
[32:24] but paul had to be born again
[32:26] amen you know because he was born a
[32:28] sinner amen amen hallelujah god doesn't
[32:32] care about your self-righteousness the
[32:35] bible says self-righteousness before god
[32:37] is like filthy rags understand where i'm
[32:40] going with this
[32:43] because you and i must understand death
[32:46] will strike us it will give us a reward
[32:49] it meant that we won't expect amen if we
[32:52] don't have his life in us
[32:55] oh come on somebody lord amen
[32:58] his life
[33:00] is the only
[33:02] life
[33:03] that death will pass over amen
[33:06] we sing that song
[33:08] let the death angel pass
[33:11] for the token has land we we've received
[33:13] the token and we've received the token
[33:15] which is his holy spirit
[33:18] that's the only thing death recognizing
[33:20] on us amen
[33:23] is that right
[33:24] it's the truth
[33:28] and you and i must understand
[33:32] this this whole
[33:34] plan of salvation
[33:37] was to restore
[33:39] what we call the title deed amen back to
[33:42] mankind amen
[33:44] thousands of years
[33:46] we've struggled we we tried our best
[33:50] to live what we call holy lives and you
[33:54] know in the appearance and listen
[33:57] what the law did to those pharisees and
[33:59] sadducees
[34:01] amen when jesus came to their day he
[34:04] said they were all dead men's bones
[34:08] because the law will kill you
[34:11] amen
[34:12] the law will suck all the joy of god out
[34:15] of you
[34:17] because you will always feel it like you
[34:20] in bondage
[34:23] it's true when the bible said
[34:27] it is the spirit
[34:29] that sets you free amen
[34:32] you understand me
[34:34] because when you receive the holy ghost
[34:37] that is god's approval
[34:40] he accepts you
[34:43] amen no matter what the devil says it
[34:46] tried to do he could never take you out
[34:48] of his hands amen glory to god
[34:51] thank you lord we must understand by
[34:53] god's grace it's by his spirit in you
[34:58] and i said that last week you know the
[35:00] only thing that you're going to take
[35:02] with you is character right
[35:05] it is not yours
[35:07] it's his character amen
[35:10] yes sir
[35:11] is his virtue is his knowledge is his
[35:13] temperance
[35:15] is his patience is his godliness it's
[35:18] christ's
[35:19] nature in you that's the mystery
[35:23] of the entire book that god himself
[35:27] wanted to
[35:28] replenish himself that's right amen
[35:32] thank you lord
[35:33] that's god
[35:35] and everybody is it's given to any and
[35:38] everybody who wants it
[35:40] but you know what
[35:42] most of us do not want to go through the
[35:44] labor
[35:46] we must labor
[35:48] is that right
[35:49] hebrews i think the fourth chapter
[35:50] whichever it is he says we must labor to
[35:54] enter into his what
[35:56] rest
[35:57] right it's like a woman in travail she
[36:00] knows she's carrying a baby
[36:02] you might know within yourself you got
[36:05] christ on the inside but let me tell you
[36:07] something you need him to be reflecting
[36:10] amen
[36:11] you need a life that when people see you
[36:14] they see him it must come to life in you
[36:18] and it takes laboring
[36:20] and this is where we have fallen short
[36:23] around the message
[36:25] because we've adopted the baptist
[36:27] doctrine you believe that god sent a
[36:29] prophet
[36:30] if you you believe the message
[36:32] no
[36:33] you really believe it you're going to
[36:35] act upon it amen
[36:37] because brother branham preached the
[36:38] holy ghost
[36:40] and he preached the statue of a perfect
[36:42] man
[36:43] and these are things that denominational
[36:45] people knows nothing about
[36:48] they won't they don't even know how to
[36:50] approach it
[36:52] when all we need is to know that it's
[36:54] been quicker
[36:56] the life has been quicker amen
[36:59] and once the life is quickened
[37:02] we feed the life
[37:04] that's it we grow up into him
[37:07] we feed and worship that life in us
[37:10] which is the word living word amen the
[37:13] holy spirit is the word
[37:16] and so the more you eat the more you
[37:18] feed him you say oh i can't change it's
[37:21] because you're not feeding
[37:24] on the bleeding bloody word
[37:27] of the son of man amen this message came
[37:29] to transform us amen and by the time
[37:33] jesus christ
[37:35] as he will interpret it
[37:38] it'll take a moment amen just a
[37:40] twinkling that's right we didn't know
[37:44] we had no no knowledge of this rapture
[37:47] we had no understanding of what you call
[37:50] the changing of the body
[37:52] we had no understanding that when
[37:55] the rapture begins to really take place
[37:58] there be those who have fallen asleep
[38:01] already in christ that would awaken and
[38:04] those of us
[38:06] who have been ordained those of us who
[38:08] have that character those of us who've
[38:10] allowed christ to bring us to a a state
[38:13] of perfection if i would say
[38:15] just prior to perfection however we want
[38:17] to put it but we'll have those virtues
[38:19] in us we'll have this developer nature
[38:21] and we'll be a different how can i say
[38:23] it
[38:24] because our dimensions will change amen
[38:27] amen
[38:29] that's all i'm telling you
[38:30] i'm telling you you began to see things
[38:33] that you could not see because of its
[38:35] nature
[38:36] you understand me you'll be able to
[38:38] understand things that you never could
[38:40] understand because of his nature amen in
[38:43] you
[38:44] and to the world you'll look crazy
[38:48] but you know what you're looking at amen
[38:52] how can you see something they cannot
[38:54] see
[38:56] because your eyes the veil will be
[38:58] lifted is that the scripture
[39:01] when it turns to the lord
[39:04] the veil will be lifted
[39:07] because when israel saw moses what did
[39:10] they see
[39:11] they just saw a prophet
[39:13] but he veiled himself
[39:16] they couldn't see you know the light of
[39:18] god or what the transformation was
[39:22] and the bible said that that was just
[39:24] what that was a glory but what about
[39:26] this glory amen that god is bringing us
[39:30] to
[39:30] uh to transform us so much so that uh
[39:34] like i said it's not like we'll be
[39:36] shining like a light bulb
[39:40] you know we're not going to have all of
[39:42] this but you understand what i'm saying
[39:44] the light of god will be seen
[39:47] only by those who can see the light amen
[39:51] because remember there was a many people
[39:53] in brother brown's ministry
[39:55] and the pillar fire would come
[39:58] and many of them couldn't see the pill
[39:59] of fire but then yet there were those
[40:01] ordained to see it
[40:04] amen is that all right
[40:06] so let me go on
[40:09] according to
[40:11] i want you to understand because you
[40:12] gotta see this you gotta you gotta i see
[40:15] it and and all i know is that
[40:18] uh one of the tapes uh i want you to
[40:20] listen to
[40:22] god's provided way for this day
[40:26] 1964
[40:28] february 0-5
[40:31] god provided way for this
[40:34] listen closely listen closely to it
[40:38] meditate on it because god has given you
[40:40] the answer amen for your day amen
[40:45] and this is a fresh tape that i began to
[40:47] listen to and i thought lord i need
[40:49] something and the lord directed me to
[40:52] that particular tape
[40:54] so
[40:55] here you go
[40:57] listen so ii corinthians 3
[41:00] 17-18 says this now the lord is that
[41:04] spirit
[41:06] and where the spirit of the lord is
[41:10] there is liberty
[41:14] amen
[41:17] but we
[41:18] all with open face
[41:22] beholding as in a glass
[41:25] the glory of the lord
[41:27] are changed into the same image you hear
[41:31] me
[41:32] listen to it closely
[41:36] the glory
[41:37] of the lord
[41:41] as in the glass
[41:43] the glory of the lord
[41:46] are changed we are changed into
[41:51] the same
[41:53] y'all understand what the same means
[41:55] the same image
[41:58] from glory
[41:59] to
[42:00] glory even as by the same spirit of the
[42:05] lord amen and you say from glory to
[42:08] glory each church age had their own
[42:11] glory
[42:12] amen
[42:14] each one of them uh uh uh expressed
[42:18] a virtue of god right
[42:21] each one of them had to go through
[42:23] trials and temptations and battles after
[42:26] battles to obtain those virtues
[42:30] it wasn't just given to them
[42:33] they had to fight for every
[42:36] every inch of their journey
[42:39] and you and i we've got to fight for
[42:42] every
[42:43] inch of it
[42:44] it's not just going to be given to you
[42:47] god shows you your faults he said well i
[42:49] don't know yes he does
[42:51] every time we make a mistake every time
[42:54] we air he makes us know
[42:58] and the reason why he makes us know so
[43:00] that you can see what's in your heart
[43:03] amen
[43:04] but he also let you know
[43:06] it doesn't have to stay that way
[43:12] because prayer
[43:13] changed things
[43:16] that's why the enemy fights us all
[43:20] in the way of prayer
[43:21] amen
[43:22] ii corinthians 3 15-16 says the veil
[43:26] remains upon their hearts
[43:29] what veil look at israel
[43:32] the veil is still there
[43:34] they can't see jesus all they can see is
[43:37] moses
[43:41] i didn't even mean to say that like that
[43:43] but that's the truth
[43:45] all they could see is the prophet they
[43:47] couldn't see the greater prophet
[43:49] they missed him
[43:51] because they were always looking at
[43:53] abraham always looking at moses and here
[43:56] was jesus
[43:58] in plain views
[44:00] you must understand this message brings
[44:03] jesus christ into plain view
[44:08] you must see him and if you can't see
[44:10] him the veil still remains amen amen
[44:14] amen
[44:17] thank you lord
[44:20] and don't tell me
[44:24] because if you try to tell these
[44:26] other church ages
[44:28] those who have been fruits of that
[44:30] particular age that they're blind they
[44:32] won't believe you
[44:34] they can't believe you
[44:37] they don't want to believe that it could
[44:39] have gotten any better than what they
[44:40] have
[44:42] but you must understand god didn't stop
[44:44] there he didn't stop at the catholic he
[44:46] didn't stop with the methodists he
[44:48] didn't stop with the pentecostals he
[44:49] keeps moving
[44:51] amen and now he calls a bride out of
[44:54] church age out of denominations out of
[44:56] the systems of law out of the systems
[44:59] that are made by man creeds and dogmas
[45:01] into a place of liberty amen
[45:04] how come it's free how come it's liberty
[45:07] because it's christ in you amen and the
[45:09] word cannot be bound amen glory
[45:14] hallelujah
[45:16] ii corinthians 3 and 2 says ye are our
[45:19] epistles
[45:21] written in our hearts
[45:23] known
[45:24] and read of all men amen
[45:28] and so you got to understand he didn't
[45:29] say written in your head
[45:31] is it in your heart
[45:33] and that is the throne room of god amen
[45:36] god comes into your heart
[45:39] it is the throne room of god in your
[45:42] heart
[45:43] and there in your heart he rules you
[45:46] amen he talks to you from your heart
[45:49] amen not your head amen from your heart
[45:56] for as much as you are manifestly
[45:59] declared you understand me
[46:02] it comes to a place in your life
[46:04] is no skepticism
[46:07] it's
[46:08] real
[46:10] it's what you are manifesting
[46:13] whatever spirit in you is manifesting
[46:16] itself through you
[46:18] if it's a holy spirit it must manifest
[46:22] holiness
[46:23] if it's an unclean spirit it will
[46:26] manifest uncleanness
[46:28] but you and i must understand that we
[46:30] cannot stop
[46:33] amen we must die we must rot to all our
[46:37] ideas all of our thoughts and all of our
[46:42] fears and most of us are afraid to
[46:44] continue because we don't know what's
[46:47] next
[46:49] you've not been this way before
[46:52] the pentecostals have never come this
[46:54] way before
[46:55] no no organization the domination has
[46:58] ever come this way before this is a new
[47:01] way
[47:02] this is a way that's been hidden from
[47:04] the eyes of men but is now being
[47:06] revealed to those paid amen those that
[47:09] such would learn amen and understand
[47:12] that the hallelujah oh my god
[47:18] understand that the
[47:21] this way is
[47:23] has been hidden
[47:25] even from a lot of people who claim to
[47:28] know the message
[47:33] god doesn't he doesn't make mistakes
[47:39] you know why he so hated the deeds of
[47:41] the nicolaitans because
[47:44] he was headship
[47:46] he was the head he was the husband to
[47:48] the church
[47:49] and he was not going to
[47:51] allow men or any organizations to take
[47:54] his position
[47:56] he hates it
[47:59] it's an abomination
[48:01] you ever think about what happened to
[48:03] the eunuch
[48:05] when he got saved
[48:07] where did he go
[48:08] i guarantee you he's in heaven right now
[48:11] why because
[48:13] god's business was the feeling with the
[48:15] holy ghost and he did what he did amen
[48:18] paul in them you know they didn't have
[48:20] literature or anybody above them that
[48:22] could help actually tell them what to do
[48:24] the bible said they were led by the
[48:26] spirit that's right
[48:29] you got to have the spirit of god in you
[48:31] now to be led by he's not talking about
[48:33] being led by your human thoughts and
[48:35] ideas
[48:36] you're talking about being led by the
[48:37] spirit
[48:39] and when i think about ye epistles
[48:41] written
[48:42] in our hearts known and read of all men
[48:46] for as much as you are manifestly
[48:48] declared to be the epistles of christ
[48:51] amen
[48:53] ministered by us
[48:55] written not
[48:56] with ink now paul says i have delivered
[49:00] a word to you
[49:04] that was able to penetrate
[49:06] and go beyond
[49:08] the outer court
[49:10] it went beyond the
[49:12] spirit man but it went right into the
[49:14] soul and now
[49:16] god has made your heart
[49:19] a fleshly heart a heart that that that
[49:22] his word is written on amen
[49:25] now i understand you the bible says
[49:30] as a man thinketh in his heart
[49:32] so is he
[49:34] can you imagine if you could really
[49:36] grasp the fact that the holy ghost is in
[49:39] you and that he is in your heart
[49:42] and think on the things that's why the
[49:44] bible says think on the things think of
[49:46] these things whatsoever honest
[49:48] whatsoever just whatsoever good whatever
[49:50] is a good report think on these things
[49:53] because really that's christ yes amen
[49:56] that's him in your heart amen
[50:02] for as much as she manifested declared
[50:04] to the epistles of christ
[50:06] ministered by the written now
[50:09] paulie says i wrote these things
[50:14] and here come brother branham knowing
[50:15] that he could not deviate from what paul
[50:18] wrote
[50:20] and he said i preached the same message
[50:22] amen so the very seed in which he sold
[50:26] was the very seed that paul sold paul
[50:28] was the alpha
[50:30] and brother branham was the omega right
[50:33] or those men who god used
[50:36] because every
[50:37] uh servant whether it was billy graham
[50:40] or roberts they sold seeds yes amen but
[50:44] in this day we had a seed that was sown
[50:47] by a prophet
[50:49] and a prophet by god's grace cannot he
[50:52] has no ability to sow his own seed
[50:54] he he can only sow the seed of god
[50:58] remember in the old testament
[51:00] they even wanted baal baal to uh balaam
[51:03] to to preach or prophesy something
[51:06] different he said i can't
[51:08] i'm bound by god
[51:10] whatever he says i must say
[51:13] and that's the way it is with every
[51:15] prophet maybe even if it means that they
[51:17] must go to the guillotine for what they
[51:19] say
[51:23] you understand
[51:25] so we're in a day
[51:27] where the spirit of the lord is trying
[51:29] to control us
[51:32] but are we fighting his will
[51:36] and this is where we must die daily
[51:40] you know we we have a battle every day
[51:42] we have a gastimity every day that we
[51:45] have to go through
[51:47] dying to ourselves that the will of god
[51:49] will be done
[51:50] not i will lord but thine be done
[51:54] can you imagine
[51:57] the prophet of god coming in and doing
[52:00] all he did to make sure the seed was
[52:02] planted and that it was come up and then
[52:05] all of a sudden no harvest there is no
[52:07] harvest
[52:08] but not so also it has to be a harvest
[52:11] amen
[52:13] that's part of it there has to be a
[52:15] harvest amen there are those amen who
[52:17] will press
[52:19] into the kingdom amen because it is
[52:21] oppressed y'all know that
[52:23] every day is oppressed i fight the devil
[52:26] every day some battles i win some i lose
[52:29] but one thing for certain i have a goal
[52:33] i'm just not fighting the air beating
[52:35] the air if i don't know where i'm headed
[52:37] i know where i'm headed amen there's
[52:39] something on the inside it's like that
[52:42] rainbow trout amen he doesn't go with
[52:45] the current he goes against the current
[52:47] and he has to travel all the way up the
[52:50] stream
[52:51] amen fighting for his life and then once
[52:55] he gets there to the bedding ground he
[52:58] makes and he dies
[53:00] his whole
[53:02] struggle
[53:04] in life
[53:06] was to
[53:08] die
[53:11] because he understood once i listen we
[53:15] supposed to produce other christians
[53:19] it's not the shepherd that produced
[53:20] christians it's the sheep that produce
[53:22] christians
[53:24] she brings forth christians and you and
[53:26] i our lives are supposed to be so like
[53:28] christ till people will be desiring to
[53:31] be like you
[53:32] amen
[53:36] like they say in that traveling are we
[53:38] there yet
[53:41] no
[53:44] potentially
[53:46] y'all understand what i'm saying amen i
[53:48] didn't know he was going that way but
[53:50] potentially but we and i must understand
[53:52] by god's grace that this is in god's
[53:54] control
[53:59] mayor couldn't say you know what i think
[54:01] i'm going to produce jesus
[54:06] mary didn't even know she was married
[54:08] she didn't even know she was in the
[54:09] scripture
[54:10] she didn't even know she was that virgin
[54:12] that isaiah prophesied amen
[54:15] it took a message
[54:17] from an angel
[54:19] to tell her who she was
[54:21] you understand me and god sent us a
[54:23] messenger he sent us an angel to tell us
[54:26] who we are amen believe it and all we've
[54:29] got to do is says lord be it unto me
[54:32] according to that word that's all she
[54:34] had to say and god took over the rest
[54:37] amen amen
[54:39] that's good it's really that simple we
[54:42] complicate it
[54:44] amen because we don't want to struggle
[54:47] and we don't want to get on our knees
[54:48] and fight until we get into our rest
[54:51] go listen to that tape
[54:54] you can't stop
[54:57] on this religious plane
[55:00] and expect you're going to make it many
[55:02] people will be difficult disappointed
[55:05] because this is a time of pride you got
[55:07] to understand
[55:08] changes
[55:10] you know i've changed we know that the
[55:13] things i used to do i don't do no more
[55:15] the places i used to go i don't go no
[55:16] more we know that
[55:18] but that's not all of it
[55:21] it must come to a place where your mind
[55:24] becomes his mind
[55:27] let this mind be in you that's what he
[55:29] said
[55:30] that was also in christ jesus and what
[55:33] was the mind of christ
[55:35] father
[55:36] i come to do your will amen amen not
[55:39] mine
[55:40] but my whole purpose of life
[55:43] is to do the father's will amen this is
[55:46] what i've been made for
[55:49] no matter what it is no matter what the
[55:51] cost i'm going to listen hear his voice
[55:54] and
[55:55] work
[55:57] to make sure it happens amen
[56:01] amen
[56:02] in the message
[56:03] what shall we do with this jesus call
[56:06] christ
[56:08] 1964 january 26th
[56:11] is that amazing is it day 26 yes sir i
[56:16] just realized that
[56:21] i didn't know
[56:22] when i was writing this down i didn't
[56:23] know
[56:25] it's amazing
[56:26] the evidence
[56:28] as i said the other day
[56:30] we tried to place evidence like luther
[56:33] said believe and walk out
[56:37] uh
[56:38] he said the devil believes too
[56:40] wesleyan said shout
[56:44] when you got it
[56:46] but he found out he didn't
[56:48] penal call says speak in tongues
[56:51] and you got it
[56:52] they didn't
[56:54] christian science says love
[56:56] you got the fruits of the spirit but
[56:59] they haven't
[57:01] they deny the divinity of jesus christ
[57:04] what is the evidence of it
[57:07] listen closely
[57:11] when the spirit
[57:13] that's in you
[57:15] can punctuate every promise
[57:19] with an amen amen
[57:22] and god will confirm it see people
[57:25] people
[57:26] they lead that part out punctuate
[57:31] with an amen but they leave this other
[57:33] part out
[57:35] which says god will confirm it amen
[57:39] in other words you can't fake it that's
[57:41] right amen the statue of a perfect man
[57:44] is is what god gives unto you
[57:48] you battle you go through the hardships
[57:51] to get there
[57:53] but once you get there you can tell
[57:55] somebody
[57:57] i've gone through the battle
[58:00] i'm a witness it's there
[58:02] i partook of it i'm like those joshuas
[58:05] those joshua and caleb that went over
[58:08] there crossed over there i found the
[58:11] graves of the promised land
[58:14] and i'm here to show you
[58:16] you can do it amen
[58:18] and that's where people think well oh my
[58:20] god this is just too hard for me i can't
[58:22] i can't do it no you can't do it and yes
[58:26] it is hard
[58:29] yes it is hard
[58:32] but you got to put in your mind i can do
[58:34] it the bible said you can do all things
[58:39] through christ with strengthen you amen
[58:42] it's christ it's the lord you go back to
[58:44] the holy spirit he strengthens you he is
[58:48] the one that directs you he is the one
[58:50] that gains gives you victory it's not
[58:53] you
[58:54] amen it's god that's right
[58:57] you can do it yes
[58:59] it's the devil telling you you can't do
[59:01] it
[59:02] don't bring back a false report amen
[59:04] when god said you can and you say you
[59:06] can't amen
[59:07] god says you came amen
[59:10] hallelujah
[59:14] hallelujah
[59:16] god will confirm it see that's exactly
[59:18] the way it was with jesus huh
[59:22] that's the way it was with jesus oh yes
[59:25] they had they had all kinds of evidences
[59:28] you can't
[59:30] pin any evidence down to anything but
[59:34] god himself
[59:36] manifesting his word
[59:38] you understand what manifesting is
[59:41] making it come to life
[59:43] in you
[59:45] not somebody else he did it in william
[59:48] branham right he did it in oral robbers
[59:50] and all of the other ones that that move
[59:52] and you know they did god did it
[59:55] but now it's your turn
[59:57] amen and the thing is you can't think
[1:00:00] god isn't going to drop it in on you
[1:00:02] those people went through some struggles
[1:00:03] to get where they were
[1:00:06] they had some dying out to do
[1:00:11] we're not on a picnic and oh well it's
[1:00:14] you know grace and it's going to just
[1:00:15] happen that's not the way it happens
[1:00:20] god puts it on you
[1:00:21] mary said be it unto me according to
[1:00:24] your word and then god wait till she get
[1:00:26] fully impressed fully pregnant and says
[1:00:28] now travel to bethlehem amen
[1:00:32] yes sir on a donkey
[1:00:35] sisters
[1:00:37] y'all know what
[1:00:39] i can't imagine
[1:00:41] and then when she gets there there is
[1:00:43] not a room
[1:00:46] a stable
[1:00:49] who's not no perfume in the room
[1:00:52] flowers
[1:00:53] nothing
[1:00:54] convenient how can this be god
[1:01:00] come on we would say oh surely this is
[1:01:02] not god you know god wouldn't do this to
[1:01:04] me and god didn't tell mary don't you
[1:01:06] know you got a stable waiting on you no
[1:01:09] he did not
[1:01:12] he kept all of that hidden step by step
[1:01:16] they went through the journey
[1:01:18] and at the end of the day
[1:01:20] before it was all over
[1:01:24] three wise men come
[1:01:27] two years or so afterwards
[1:01:32] and declare that her birth amen was of
[1:01:35] god amen
[1:01:40] think about it see if what we fail to
[1:01:42] see is that oh we won't reward right off
[1:01:45] god don't always give you reward he
[1:01:47] gives you sufferings first
[1:01:49] stay in tune with him that's all you
[1:01:51] need to do god's will be done stay in
[1:01:55] too
[1:01:56] that's all we need to do
[1:01:58] you think david being the king had a
[1:02:00] great time
[1:02:02] david suffered yes amen and no doubt the
[1:02:05] devil devil says see how can you be king
[1:02:07] and look what all you're going through
[1:02:08] david you were just a young boy now you
[1:02:10] got to go through all of this yes
[1:02:14] because god was also building character
[1:02:16] in david
[1:02:20] that's what it's all about god building
[1:02:22] character you can't have character built
[1:02:24] in you without suffering that's right
[1:02:26] that's right
[1:02:28] you gonna suffer
[1:02:29] if you be of god
[1:02:31] amen and you're gonna suffer if you be
[1:02:33] of the devil
[1:02:35] suffering is something that you can't
[1:02:36] get out of it is what it is but if
[1:02:39] you're going to suffer suffer for the
[1:02:41] name of jesus christ amen suffer for the
[1:02:44] cause of christ
[1:02:45] if you've got to suffer
[1:02:50] i don't know if the lord tarried and i
[1:02:53] got to go on i don't know how it's going
[1:02:55] to be but you know what brother brown
[1:02:57] says i don't want to i don't want the
[1:02:58] devil to crown me with some mean spirit
[1:03:01] sir amen
[1:03:02] i want to go out like a crab
[1:03:07] you know what i'm saying i don't know if
[1:03:10] i've always asked the lord i said god i
[1:03:12] don't know what you're going to do with
[1:03:13] me i really believe i'm a rapture
[1:03:14] material but if i gotta die if i gotta
[1:03:17] go please let it be so that entourage
[1:03:19] will help him come down and i have a
[1:03:20] glorious time going out
[1:03:24] you know i want some witnesses there you
[1:03:26] know i've heard where people be in the
[1:03:28] room and the power of god comes in
[1:03:31] the anointing of god comes in and then
[1:03:33] when the launching leaves they go with
[1:03:35] him that's what i'm talking about
[1:03:41] i believe those stories amen with all my
[1:03:44] heart amen
[1:03:45] he said that's the only true evidence
[1:03:47] that there is that you're a christian
[1:03:50] how can you be a christian when see
[1:03:53] listen and what he's trying to say is
[1:03:55] let's say it like this
[1:03:57] here was jesus christ the very word of
[1:03:59] god
[1:04:01] manifested in the flesh
[1:04:04] and yet and still
[1:04:06] he needed the holy spirit
[1:04:10] that's right amen
[1:04:12] why he couldn't make his journey he
[1:04:14] couldn't go no further
[1:04:18] god had met him there at the river of
[1:04:20] jordan with john
[1:04:23] it was then the pillow fire come down
[1:04:25] and said this is my beloved son in whom
[1:04:27] i'm
[1:04:28] well pleased to dwell in
[1:04:31] and after that
[1:04:34] miracles upon miracles
[1:04:36] but first
[1:04:38] he had to suffer amen
[1:04:40] 40 days and 49 he went through the
[1:04:43] wilderness and listen the bible don't
[1:04:45] even tell us of all the events that
[1:04:47] satan may have tempt him with
[1:04:50] god knows it well it was rough
[1:04:53] it had to be just as rough as calvary
[1:04:55] was
[1:04:57] but when he came out
[1:05:00] he was all god amen
[1:05:02] he had learned that man does not live by
[1:05:04] bread alone
[1:05:06] is that right because that's what the
[1:05:08] bible said he learned his his obedience
[1:05:10] through the things he suffered
[1:05:13] and when he came out he he basically
[1:05:15] told the devil you know man doesn't live
[1:05:17] by bread alone but by every word that
[1:05:19] proceedeth out of the mouth of god
[1:05:21] that's how we live amen because we live
[1:05:23] off these earthly substances we're going
[1:05:26] to die
[1:05:28] but if you really want to live you live
[1:05:30] by the word amen and once that word is
[1:05:32] on the inside of you you become eternal
[1:05:36] it's the only thing about you now that
[1:05:38] had no beginning or no ending
[1:05:40] is that eternal life in you amen
[1:05:43] all right just almost at the end here
[1:05:46] in the beginning was the word and you
[1:05:48] understand when i said that about jesus
[1:05:50] he had to be anointed
[1:05:53] quickened
[1:05:57] even though he never lost vision of who
[1:05:58] he was
[1:06:02] but the holy ghost came down
[1:06:05] amen
[1:06:08] in the beginning was the word and the
[1:06:09] word was with god
[1:06:11] and the word was god and you think you
[1:06:13] got it tough
[1:06:15] but jesus even as a child had to live
[1:06:17] circumspectly
[1:06:20] and after the age of 12 he had to make
[1:06:21] sure he did no wrong
[1:06:26] and he was perfect
[1:06:28] even as a natural man
[1:06:31] and how more perfect if there's such
[1:06:32] thing you can become when god himself
[1:06:35] dwells in you
[1:06:40] god was so in him amen he calmed the sea
[1:06:44] yep amen when that boat was rocking and
[1:06:47] peter them afraid and lord lord careth
[1:06:50] thou not we perish and he goes up and
[1:06:52] says peace be still
[1:06:54] he didn't argue with the devil no he
[1:06:56] knew where the storm was caused by the
[1:06:57] devil
[1:06:59] right
[1:07:00] sometimes we waste words when it comes
[1:07:02] to prayer
[1:07:04] faith just tell them to to go and say
[1:07:06] you know we don't have to go through all
[1:07:08] the history
[1:07:10] of the bible
[1:07:13] god i know you can do it because you
[1:07:14] open the red sea you know what i'm
[1:07:16] saying we don't have to do all of that
[1:07:17] just speak to the devil
[1:07:20] when the authority is in you it's in you
[1:07:23] often times we go through all that drama
[1:07:26] the devil's saying okay you're trying to
[1:07:27] convince yourself that he is
[1:07:30] yeah we don't have to go through all
[1:07:32] that
[1:07:33] amen in the beginning was the word the
[1:07:35] word was with god and the word was god
[1:07:38] and the word was made flesh and dwelt
[1:07:41] among us the same yesterday today and
[1:07:45] forever what i'm trying to say is
[1:07:49] i don't know how to say it but god give
[1:07:51] me the words because i see what i see
[1:07:57] we often use we're made out of the same
[1:07:59] material
[1:08:01] we're bone of his bone in flesh of his
[1:08:03] flesh
[1:08:05] but if we were to look in the mirror
[1:08:07] what would we see
[1:08:12] not trying to discourage you but i'm
[1:08:13] saying that's where we need to be amen
[1:08:16] we understand this from glory to glory
[1:08:18] that means suffering from suffering
[1:08:20] battle to battle but at the end of the
[1:08:22] day our goal is to look in the mirror
[1:08:25] and see jesus
[1:08:27] the bible said we'll see him face to
[1:08:29] face
[1:08:31] the very same image the very same
[1:08:33] likeness the same authority the same
[1:08:35] power the same everything that jesus had
[1:08:38] did and in our day through a prophet is
[1:08:40] supposed to be in the bride amen
[1:08:46] don't
[1:08:46] become complacent
[1:08:49] it's what i'm working
[1:08:50] with press toward the mark of a high
[1:08:53] calling
[1:08:54] in christ jesus don't let these things
[1:08:57] distract you because i have distractions
[1:09:00] all the time that i wore again sometimes
[1:09:02] i mean it's like a you know back and
[1:09:04] forth and back and forth but at some
[1:09:05] point in time it it must stop
[1:09:09] in order to go forward it has to stop
[1:09:14] not just you all of us go through these
[1:09:16] things
[1:09:17] but we must understand that the god in
[1:09:19] us is saying come on now
[1:09:22] you won't go around this mountain too
[1:09:23] long amen
[1:09:25] come on let's move forward
[1:09:28] you see
[1:09:31] he's the same yesterday to them forever
[1:09:33] and we said well he's in us
[1:09:35] well if he's in us he must be the same
[1:09:40] that's what i see
[1:09:44] almost done
[1:09:48] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:09:52] he was the same god that was in david
[1:09:56] in other words david could have never
[1:09:57] done anything had it not been the god in
[1:10:00] him
[1:10:02] he was the same one that was in moses
[1:10:04] moses couldn't have done one thing
[1:10:07] had not god met him
[1:10:09] on the back side of the desert
[1:10:11] that same god that was in the burning
[1:10:12] bush stepped into moses
[1:10:14] that's what we need
[1:10:16] we need that same god to step into us
[1:10:18] amen
[1:10:20] he was the same one that was in moses he
[1:10:22] was the same one
[1:10:24] in all of the apostles
[1:10:27] he's the same one
[1:10:29] he is the same one that was in jesus
[1:10:31] christ to manifest himself there
[1:10:34] for that promised word and he is the
[1:10:38] same god today the same word
[1:10:42] throwing light upon the word of the hour
[1:10:46] god be merciful to us
[1:10:49] see this is what the message comes to
[1:10:51] throw light to throw that anointing
[1:10:53] through light on the word throw light so
[1:10:56] you can understand who you are and what
[1:10:57] you're supposed to be it will not come
[1:11:00] back void
[1:11:02] and whether we believe it or whether we
[1:11:04] achieve it if somebody will
[1:11:07] and those people that have been ordained
[1:11:09] to achieve it will achieve it amen
[1:11:12] and you got to believe that you're one
[1:11:14] of them amen
[1:11:17] don't let the devil down play who you
[1:11:19] are amen
[1:11:21] you've got to move forward
[1:11:24] god help me i don't care if i gotta move
[1:11:26] like a snail let me move forward
[1:11:31] that's what brother battle say you know
[1:11:32] we're moving slowly but that's the way
[1:11:34] he said it would be in this day
[1:11:40] but we'll get there amen
[1:11:45] yes sir
[1:11:47] believe in god
[1:11:49] to interpret himself
[1:11:51] every word to be vindicated yes
[1:11:55] he
[1:11:56] is his own
[1:11:58] interpreter amen
[1:12:00] and i say all of that to say
[1:12:04] the god in you
[1:12:07] that one in you that spirit in you
[1:12:10] is trying to lead you into a place of
[1:12:13] perfection
[1:12:15] let go and you know
[1:12:17] the cares of this world and the things
[1:12:19] that we care about don't mean a thing in
[1:12:21] a moment of twinkling of an eye it's
[1:12:23] gone and you know what we don't know
[1:12:24] when we're gonna die
[1:12:26] we don't know our day of departure
[1:12:29] and you know you find rich men who build
[1:12:32] and build and build and build and as
[1:12:34] soon as they get ready to retire they
[1:12:35] die yeah
[1:12:39] and and solomon said it someone said you
[1:12:42] spend all your life
[1:12:45] building these things
[1:12:47] and then when you die
[1:12:49] a fool
[1:12:50] come by and spend it
[1:12:56] it's the truth
[1:12:58] now i'ma say this so you can rest at
[1:13:00] ease
[1:13:02] you know i you know god did this but
[1:13:05] i'll be honest with you when
[1:13:07] i graduated
[1:13:09] from school and things i had in my mind
[1:13:11] that one day i'd have my doctorate
[1:13:13] degree
[1:13:15] but you know i went to this apostolic
[1:13:17] church and this church had us thinking
[1:13:19] that
[1:13:20] the rapture could happen in such a time
[1:13:22] and
[1:13:23] you got to be so ready
[1:13:25] you know we spent every every day
[1:13:27] looking up and looking at the stars and
[1:13:29] looking
[1:13:30] seriously i'm laughing but it's true
[1:13:33] until we spend so much time trying to
[1:13:35] observe the season
[1:13:39] life passed us that's right
[1:13:42] and it put us in such a
[1:13:44] nervous condition
[1:13:46] you fail you come short you just like
[1:13:48] lord don't let the rapture happen right
[1:13:50] now because i got to get it right
[1:13:52] you know what i'm saying it was the way
[1:13:53] we were taught and it was wrong
[1:13:57] it's strange that the prophet of god
[1:13:58] said plant your potatoes that's right
[1:14:04] you keep planting your potatoes if you
[1:14:06] have something in you that you want to
[1:14:09] achieve go for it
[1:14:11] but make sure you keep
[1:14:13] amen
[1:14:15] don't let nothing stop you because we
[1:14:17] don't know we don't know
[1:14:21] don't don't make
[1:14:22] you see what i'm saying if you got the
[1:14:24] holy spirit and you really know that you
[1:14:26] saved you're sanctified the holy spirit
[1:14:29] the grace of god is with you
[1:14:31] then
[1:14:33] who can lay in the charge to god's
[1:14:34] election amen
[1:14:36] who can misjudge you
[1:14:40] you understand what i'm saying
[1:14:42] but we get to a phase we get to a place
[1:14:44] where we feel like we can help it
[1:14:47] you can't
[1:14:49] we do make ourselves ready if there be
[1:14:51] anything in our way that is hindering us
[1:14:53] to becoming going forward we need to get
[1:14:56] rid of it
[1:14:58] but if what you're doing is not
[1:15:00] hindering your spiritual life you go on
[1:15:02] with it
[1:15:03] you understand me
[1:15:08] and
[1:15:08] no that if you have been chosen before
[1:15:11] the foundation of the world and we don't
[1:15:13] know how many years that have been
[1:15:15] that's before the earth started
[1:15:17] that's before the sun and all of those
[1:15:20] things foundation of the world you
[1:15:21] understand me way before then god chose
[1:15:24] you
[1:15:25] and at the end of the day he's not going
[1:15:27] to say oops
[1:15:28] i made a mistake
[1:15:30] god don't make mistakes
[1:15:33] and god knew your travel he knew your
[1:15:35] ways before you ever came here is that
[1:15:38] right
[1:15:38] jacob i love and esau i hate it
[1:15:44] not taken away from righteousness
[1:15:48] but understand that our righteousness is
[1:15:50] of god and out of ourselves
[1:15:53] this is the grace of god that has been
[1:15:55] given to us
[1:15:57] and if you've been chosen to make a
[1:15:59] ride or rapture there's nothing satan
[1:16:01] can put in your way to make it not
[1:16:03] happen
[1:16:08] we can get in his way though
[1:16:10] just like i said i think the the last
[1:16:12] sunday you know here god didn't already
[1:16:15] told or was it rachel uh
[1:16:17] rachel one of the two you know the
[1:16:20] jacobs i love and he's all i hate
[1:16:22] and the younger were rude the elder
[1:16:25] and she thought well i gotta help it
[1:16:28] god told me but i gotta help it i hear
[1:16:30] that you know uh
[1:16:32] daddy getting ready to anoint
[1:16:36] you see what i'm saying and in the
[1:16:38] course of that
[1:16:40] jacob had to suffer
[1:16:42] 14 years
[1:16:45] things went out of course
[1:16:48] because of their action as if god wasn't
[1:16:50] going to make it happen
[1:16:54] god only god don't anoint you to be a
[1:16:55] deceiver
[1:16:57] man
[1:16:59] that's not god that was human being that
[1:17:01] was human effort human human in the way
[1:17:03] you understand me
[1:17:06] and what happened
[1:17:08] jacob had to suffer for 14 years
[1:17:11] and he even married a wife amen that had
[1:17:13] a little idolatry in them yeah
[1:17:17] and look at the scripture it took rachel
[1:17:19] a long time before she could actually
[1:17:21] call
[1:17:21] jacob israel
[1:17:25] god had to work on her too
[1:17:28] see but all of that took place because
[1:17:31] here was a man
[1:17:33] and his mama getting in the way
[1:17:37] and that's what happens we let the
[1:17:38] church get on our way
[1:17:40] we let these natural things get in our
[1:17:42] way like we gonna make it happen and
[1:17:43] happen no no you get in the way you're
[1:17:45] gonna cause a long journey of suffering
[1:17:49] but god will bring you back because all
[1:17:50] things work together for the good he
[1:17:52] knows how to do it amen
[1:17:55] you love the lord amen don't don't uh
[1:17:59] let me tell you like this what i believe
[1:18:02] and i you know i don't know
[1:18:04] i i believe it's far closer to the
[1:18:07] translation than we think yes sir amen
[1:18:10] and i believe that when the this this
[1:18:12] volcano erupted underneath the sea there
[1:18:15] out there and shook
[1:18:16] all of that tsunami and everything
[1:18:18] wasn't a big one right
[1:18:20] because listen even even when in that
[1:18:22] dream of 33 or whatever it was that
[1:18:24] young boy that had to dream about
[1:18:25] california
[1:18:26] he said you know what we call the big
[1:18:28] one he said it started off as a small
[1:18:30] earthquake
[1:18:32] something so small that people ignored
[1:18:34] it
[1:18:37] see god knows what he's doing
[1:18:39] and a lot of times our interpretation is
[1:18:41] not the way he's going
[1:18:45] what are you going to do
[1:18:48] and i say this by the grace of god i'm
[1:18:49] trying to bring a peace to you
[1:18:51] but the peace i'm trying to bring to you
[1:18:53] is this is established in you getting
[1:18:55] the holy ghost amen if you don't have it
[1:18:58] do whatever you can do when i say that i
[1:19:01] mean
[1:19:02] talk to god well i don't know how
[1:19:05] talk
[1:19:06] to the lord show me the way
[1:19:09] talk to the lord amen that's on that
[1:19:11] tape
[1:19:12] that's on the tape god's provided way
[1:19:14] for this day
[1:19:15] you ask him how to do it and he'll show
[1:19:17] you how to do it amen he'll show you how
[1:19:20] to get there he's the only one that
[1:19:23] knows the way
[1:19:25] amen
[1:19:27] people
[1:19:28] this is a perfect message
[1:19:30] and all we need to do is take it and
[1:19:32] believe it and move forward with it
[1:19:35] no questions asked
[1:19:37] just do what it says
[1:19:39] and god will anoint you in such a way
[1:19:43] i see it coming i really see it coming
[1:19:48] it's it's going to happen
[1:19:50] let's stand
[1:20:03] brother brandon said your
[1:20:05] pastor leads you
[1:20:08] you know what people are taking so much
[1:20:09] they don't even study they don't read
[1:20:11] the word
[1:20:12] no
[1:20:13] they come to church for the pastor
[1:20:15] to lead them
[1:20:17] what kind of christianity is that
[1:20:23] they take a quote and they run it to the
[1:20:26] stream
[1:20:28] and they don't understand that in the
[1:20:29] midst in the middle of all of that you
[1:20:32] could tell people don't know this
[1:20:33] message
[1:20:34] you can tell their response they just
[1:20:36] don't know what
