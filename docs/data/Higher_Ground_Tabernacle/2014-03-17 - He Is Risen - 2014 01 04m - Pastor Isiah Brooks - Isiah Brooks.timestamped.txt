[0:00] St John
[0:02] 201 not going to the time we're just
[0:04] going to go right
[0:06] on might sound like a little Easter
[0:09] message this morning but I trust that
[0:10] you're blessed with it by the grace of
[0:13] God St John 20 and 11 but Mary stood
[0:18] without the supplier weeping as she wept
[0:23] she stood down and looked into the Sela
[0:26] and seeth two angels in white sitting
[0:31] the one at the head and the other at the
[0:34] feet where the body of Jesus had
[0:37] Lain and they say unto her woman why
[0:42] weepest thou and she said unto them
[0:45] because they have taken away my Lord and
[0:48] I know not where they have laid him and
[0:52] when she had thus said she turned
[0:56] herself back and saw Jesus standing and
[1:00] knew not that it was Jesus and Jesus
[1:04] said unto her
[1:06] woman why weepest thou whom whom excuse
[1:10] me why weepest thou whom seekest thou
[1:14] and she supposing him to be the gardener
[1:17] said unto her him sir if thou have borne
[1:21] him hence tell me where thou has laid
[1:24] him and I will take him away now listen
[1:26] she was so Disturbed she says I will
[1:29] take take him away one
[1:31] woman amen and Jesus said unto her Mary
[1:36] she turned herself and said unto him Ro
[1:39] ranai which is to say master Jesus said
[1:43] unto her touch me not for I am not yet
[1:47] ascended to my father but go to my
[1:50] brethren and say unto them I Ascend unto
[1:53] my father and your father and to my God
[1:57] and your God Mary Magdalene came and
[2:01] told the disciples that she had seen the
[2:03] Lord and that he had spoken these things
[2:06] unto her we're going to jump down to the
[2:09] 28th verse of the same
[2:13] chapter and Thomas answered and said
[2:16] unto him my Lord and my God and Jesus
[2:20] said unto him Thomas because thou have
[2:23] seen me thou has believed blessed are
[2:27] they that have not seen and yet have
[2:31] believed give me one more scripture St
[2:33] Luke
[2:39] 24 St Luke 24 and
[2:46] 5 how many y'all believe he's
[2:49] living amen it it should Beyond should
[2:52] be beyond that now it's your your sight
[2:54] should be Faith amen amen you your faith
[2:58] shall be sight excuse me
[3:00] amen Luke uh uh 24
[3:18] and5 and it came to pass and they as
[3:20] they were much perplexed I'm sorry and
[3:23] as they were afraid and bowed down their
[3:26] faces to the Earth they said unto them
[3:29] why SE ye the living among the dead let
[3:33] us pray Heavenly Father God we thank you
[3:35] for your grace and your mercy Lord truly
[3:38] you have been good to us and we thank
[3:41] you for being so real to us you've been
[3:44] better to us Lord than we have been to
[3:47] ourselves and we pray father that you
[3:49] bless the service in a special way Lord
[3:53] we ask these Saints in Jesus Christ's
[3:55] name give us Grace to move completely
[3:57] out of your way that you might speak to
[4:00] your people father cleanse us of all
[4:02] unrighteousness every thought action or
[4:05] deed that we may have done Lord I pray
[4:07] father that you take Lord the fire from
[4:10] the altar Lord and burn every demon away
[4:13] from us Lord we ask these things in
[4:15] Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may
[4:18] be
[4:20] seated I just like to uh uh uh entitled
[4:25] the message he is
[4:28] risen now now I want to personalize it
[4:32] and you must do likewise he is risen in
[4:39] me now we come at a
[4:42] time that uh we're getting ready to see
[4:44] a
[4:45] translation I believe that with all of
[4:48] my heart it is not something that we
[4:50] could manufacture or produce ourselves
[4:54] but it is something that God has already
[4:57] determined in his mind in his forign
[5:01] knowledge and uh I am really excited
[5:04] about it now we we see by the grace of
[5:08] God in this uh particular uh setting
[5:12] where Jesus had been now
[5:15] crucified and he had been laying in the
[5:17] grave for three days and of course there
[5:21] had been talk going about that he wasn't
[5:23] going to get up and I'm sure he's like
[5:26] some of the others that have forerun him
[5:29] that claimed to have been the Messiah
[5:32] and uh we realize by the grace of God
[5:35] that even at this time it's it's a shame
[5:37] to say it but his own disciples amen uh
[5:41] were in doubt and didn't believe but
[5:44] there were those women amen who uh were
[5:47] still in love with him even though it
[5:51] seems like the uh the end of their
[5:54] Vision or the end of their dream had
[5:56] come amen they still was in love with
[5:59] with him and this is what I love about
[6:01] it because amen when you are are even
[6:05] when it doesn't seem like uh God is
[6:08] living in you or you you you know
[6:09] something has happened it's something
[6:11] about the True Body of Christ they they
[6:14] love the body of Christ and understand
[6:17] she was going to anoint the body of
[6:19] Christ amen even in her pain even in her
[6:23] sorrow amen she was on her way down to
[6:26] anoint the body of Christ you know
[6:28] that's a lesson we ought to know it
[6:30] ought to be something we should learn
[6:32] that our pain and our hurt and our
[6:34] sorrow should mean less to us amen when
[6:38] it comes Amen to anointing the body of
[6:41] Christ but we find out by the grace of
[6:44] God she has her uh coming down there's
[6:46] some historical some powerful things
[6:49] happening and I don't want to get ahead
[6:50] of myself cuz I'm
[6:52] excited but we find out amen that you
[6:55] know the prophet God and I'll read it in
[6:57] just a minute but he talks about how you
[6:59] know the the Roman soldiers you know the
[7:01] seal amen over this particular grave was
[7:05] a big Stone and it took about aund men
[7:08] to roll that stone in position now here
[7:11] this woman they must have been coming in
[7:13] faith because they themselves could not
[7:16] eroll that stone back but they wanted to
[7:18] anoint the body and they had faith that
[7:21] somehow God was going to take care of it
[7:24] I don't know how the stone is going to
[7:25] be rolled back but God will take care of
[7:28] it and I could see them amen as they
[7:31] walking down and you know they they see
[7:34] these things and you know we we realize
[7:36] by the grace of God that h a powerful
[7:40] thing was happening Heaven no doubt was
[7:43] looking at this thing and and and
[7:44] wondering amen what it was all about but
[7:47] we find out amen as they as they uh
[7:50] began to approach uh the the uh uh place
[7:54] where Jesus laid brother random describ
[7:57] it he said that morning star began to
[7:59] move out of his
[8:01] place Hallelujah out of all the years
[8:04] it's been hanging up there all of a
[8:06] sudden he began to move out of his place
[8:08] a little bit amen and the Bible said
[8:11] it's shut down I mean the prophet of God
[8:13] said it's shut down amen from heaven
[8:15] like a ball of fire and it stood there
[8:17] like Mighty
[8:21] Angels Hallelujah I love this and I'm
[8:24] going to read it to you in just a minute
[8:26] but then he goes on and and we find out
[8:28] by the grace of God that we we we we we
[8:32] know that the Romans would have loved
[8:34] for that stone to
[8:37] remain you see the world have always
[8:39] been trying to get rid of God they've
[8:43] always always tried to seal him in
[8:45] somewhere lock him down amen like they
[8:48] doing right now in our day and age
[8:50] they're trying to lock him down they're
[8:52] trying to keep him sealed in amen but
[8:55] I'm going explain to you in just a
[8:56] moment what it's all about so we realize
[8:59] by the grace of God this is a great
[9:01] earthquake and I love
[9:03] this cuz every time I think about the
[9:05] Great Earthquake I think about the great
[9:07] earthquake that we're looking forward to
[9:10] you say well I'm not looking forward to
[9:12] it but yes I am hallelujah amen because
[9:15] I realize at this great and this the way
[9:17] I believe it that at this great uh
[9:20] earthquake like it was in that day
[9:21] there's going to be a mighty
[9:23] Resurrection Hallelujah come on somebody
[9:27] amen with the dead in Christ your rise
[9:29] amen and those that are remain shall
[9:31] going to be quickened and changed in a
[9:33] moment's time I believe that amen so I
[9:38] look at this thing and I think how that
[9:40] the Romans still trying to you know and
[9:43] I was talking with brother Cam and
[9:44] somehow we were on the same line of
[9:46] thought when I was there in Ohio and you
[9:48] know he preached a message kind of with
[9:51] this party and and I did too and so he
[9:52] said man how can it was the same Spirit
[9:55] but let me put it this way amen that
[9:57] seal was broken
[9:59] now watch this because amen the Roman
[10:02] seal still
[10:05] exist but what is it is a spiritual
[10:09] seal it is a seal that seem to keep God
[10:13] in the
[10:14] Tomb remember the angel said why seek
[10:18] you living among the
[10:20] dead amen because let me say it like
[10:23] this amen the Roman seal today amen is
[10:27] just you know it's not so visible amen
[10:29] with the eye but it's such a spiritual
[10:33] uh H seal that has got the people of God
[10:35] in a state of
[10:38] comos a lack of
[10:40] alertness you know you conscious you can
[10:43] hear amen but you can't respond y'all
[10:46] know what I'm talking about just like
[10:48] now some of us amen you're hearing the
[10:50] word but you can't even say a
[10:52] amen right you're not alert to what's
[10:55] actually happening you can hear it amen
[10:57] but you can't even respond to it that's
[10:59] a state of
[11:01] Kos Hallelujah come on somebody oh that
[11:05] same Spirit of sealing you in sealing
[11:07] God you might have him in there but the
[11:10] Romans seal got traditions and and the
[11:13] way churches behave got got you sealed
[11:16] in or got him sealed in there so he
[11:18] can't even express himself think about
[11:21] it amen you think about a corpse it's
[11:25] cold it's
[11:27] stiff it's starchy
[11:30] come on somebody amen you can talk to it
[11:32] and it won't
[11:34] respond hallelujah amen but I'm hoping
[11:38] and trusting that you're not corpses
[11:40] this morning I'm hoping and trusting by
[11:42] the grace of God that maybe there's a
[11:44] seal of the Roman amen holding you back
[11:47] but I hope this morning you can break
[11:49] the seal let God respond out of your
[11:52] natural body
[11:54] Hallelujah glory to God when we realize
[11:58] amen what God God has done for us he's
[12:01] done a mighty thing the Bible says amen
[12:04] according to Romans
[12:05] 4:25 who was delivered for our offenses
[12:08] and was raised again for our
[12:11] justification that means amen by the
[12:13] grace of God Amen he went to hell for us
[12:16] amen when we should have gone to Hell
[12:18] Hallelujah he suffered the whippings he
[12:21] suffered the beatings amen from Jehovah
[12:24] God that we should have gotten
[12:25] Hallelujah the Bible said with his
[12:27] stripes we are healed not going to be
[12:30] healed we're already healed Hallelujah
[12:33] glory to God Amen you got to realize
[12:36] amen that not only did he go to hell for
[12:38] you but he went to heaven for you
[12:41] Hallelujah the Bible says amen thou has
[12:44] ascended on high and thou has led
[12:46] captivity captive thou have received
[12:48] gifts from men yes sir for the
[12:51] rebellious also that the Lord God might
[12:54] dwell among them Hallelujah so what did
[12:57] God do amen he went heaven and he just
[13:00] didn't stay up there Hallelujah but the
[13:02] Bible said he descended that's what he
[13:05] told his disciples he said it's good
[13:06] that I go back to the father he said and
[13:08] when I go back there he's going to send
[13:10] a comforter Hallelujah and when that
[13:13] comforter come Hallelujah he will be God
[13:17] hallelujah it'll be the same God Amen
[13:21] that raised me up Hallelujah Romans amen
[13:25] Paul picked that thing up and said if
[13:27] the Same Spirit be in you that was also
[13:29] in Christ it as it quickened his body
[13:32] it'll also Quicken yours hallelujah amen
[13:36] that is the only Power that'll break the
[13:38] Roman Shield hallelujah oh you said the
[13:41] Roman Shield is
[13:44] religious amen it's religious amen it
[13:48] knows how to act in a Pious way
[13:50] Hallelujah but God ain't looking for
[13:52] that kind of an anointing God want a
[13:55] freedom in his people why because when
[13:58] Spirit of the Lord is there is liberty
[14:00] and he whom the Son of God has set free
[14:03] is free
[14:04] indeed oh
[14:07] my oh my if we could understand what all
[14:11] God did for us at Calvary amen the Bible
[14:15] says amen by the grace of God he told
[14:18] Mary he said now y'all don't don't touch
[14:20] me now I haven't ascended yet Hallelujah
[14:22] I've got to do something else here I
[14:24] done fixed it on Earth but I got to I
[14:26] got to fix it in heaven as well and the
[14:28] Bible said he went up there and he
[14:29] sprinkled the
[14:31] blood hallelujah what was it amen
[14:34] because the veil had already been rent
[14:36] Hallelujah on the face of the earth is
[14:38] that right the Bible said when he died
[14:41] Hallelujah the veil of the temple ran in
[14:43] Dain from the top to the bottom do you
[14:46] realize what that mean that means amen
[14:49] that you can go into the holies of
[14:50] holies that means that veil was so R
[14:53] amen that whosoever will let him come
[14:57] Hallelujah understand at this one point
[14:59] that only the priesthood could go in
[15:00] there and that was the high priest could
[15:02] only go there once a year Hallelujah and
[15:05] you know what when he came out of there
[15:07] he was not
[15:09] sad there's no way you can go into the
[15:12] holies of holies and come out sad
[15:15] hallelujah amen because when he went
[15:17] into the holies of holies he come out
[15:19] shouting Hallelujah the bells were
[15:22] ringing hallelujah holy holy holy holy
[15:26] holy holy that's the kind of a light
[15:28] that comes out when you come from behind
[15:30] the
[15:31] [Music]
[15:33] veil come on somebody because in behind
[15:35] the veil is Heavenly places
[15:38] hone oh let me let me let me not jump
[15:41] here amen because you got to realize
[15:43] amen what God has done for you I think
[15:45] we forgotten you know brother brand said
[15:46] that's the the greatest greatest sermon
[15:48] you could ever preach is on
[15:50] Calvary Hallelujah I don't care all
[15:52] these other Mysteries they're great but
[15:54] when you can bring a soul to Calvary and
[15:57] show them what God has done for them and
[15:59] how free they are
[16:01] hallelujah oh my it really whoops the
[16:04] devil every
[16:06] time is that all right oh my that same
[16:10] Spirit quickens you see it's not alone
[16:12] it's not enough I'm not saying you're
[16:13] not the word but I really believe that a
[16:15] lot of us need some
[16:17] quickenings Hallelujah come on somebody
[16:20] Jesus was born the word but he had to be
[16:22] quickened hallelujah oh my and you got
[16:26] to be quickened by the Holy Ghost
[16:28] Hallelujah
[16:29] think about it how come the Devil
[16:32] Couldn't keep Jesus in Hell why because
[16:34] the word of God had already gone out
[16:37] according to Psalm 16:10 for thou will
[16:39] not leave my soul in Hell neither will
[16:41] thou suffer thine Holy One to seek
[16:43] corruption Hallelujah I don't care devil
[16:47] hell could not keep Hallelujah the body
[16:50] of Jesus that never could it e either
[16:52] could it suffer corruption Hallelujah
[16:55] why cuz the word have been spoken it
[16:58] wasn't a his own power but it was by the
[17:01] power that was invested in him that's
[17:04] why Jesus could say no man can take my
[17:07] life I lay it down and I pick it up what
[17:10] was it that was a God in that flesh
[17:12] speaking
[17:14] hallelujah oh my can't No Grave hold

[17:32] it he goes to hell that's right there
[17:34] ain't there ain't a real Christian true
[17:37] Christian where Satan could hold them by
[17:39] way of
[17:40] hell no sir no sir no sir amen because

[18:18] folks he is risen and he's living in us
[18:23] but the only way he got the the the
[18:25] stone must be rolled away Hallelujah
[18:27] that stone that that you allow Satan to

[19:56] God's word stands ass sure and it come
[19:59] back forward Hallelujah I'm not going to
[20:01] allow Satan to deceive me Hallelujah
[20:04] because if I would have looked at the
[20:05] corpse of Jesus I would have said there
[20:07] is no way there's no way he could live
[20:10] again look how beaten he up he doesn't
[20:12] even look like a man he's so he's so
[20:14] swollen and so beaten he he just looked
[20:16] like a piece of slab hallelujah
[20:18] hallelujah but what they didn't
[20:20] understand that the god that put in
[20:22] there was the same God that created him
[20:25] Hallelujah and that same God hallelujah
[20:28] will change these moral bodies into
[20:32] immortality amen it doesn't matter what

[20:51] bit here just slow it down a little bit
[20:53] amen you know you look at this thing and
[20:55] say well brother Brooks why are you so
[20:57] excited because I realize
[20:59] by the grace of God that Satan is moving
[21:01] in a fast pace and you know what I can't
[21:04] help it amen you're going to have
[21:05] Believers make Believers and
[21:07] non-believers I I I'm just so glad that

[21:14] nobody else I just know what he's made
[21:17] me Hallelujah and I'm so thankful for
[21:19] her because I realize my day is coming

[21:24] Grave worrying about whether he was
[21:25] going to get up or not he already knew
[21:28] the time Hallelujah before 3 days up I'm
[21:32] out of this
[21:34] place and you got to realize by the
[21:36] grace of God what he did amen because
[21:39] you know what I don't know how he did it
[21:42] all in three days but he went down into
[21:45] Satan's territory the Bible say he went
[21:47] into the Lord's hell he went down there

[26:55] thought and the true Easter se he says
[26:58] stay there stay there for a while it's
[26:59] true he stayed there for those three
[27:02] days and nights but on that set on that
[27:04] set time I'm G say it again on that set
[27:08] time which the scripture says hallelujah
[27:11] on that time when he said destroy this
[27:13] body and on the third day I'll rise it
[27:16] up again is that right he said then
[27:19] there's nothing can stop the
[27:21] scripture Hallelujah there's nothing
[27:24] that can stop the scripture it's got to
[27:26] come to pass and that's that seal was

[27:35] years or maybe I'll say rose up and the
[27:38] same Jesus alive again I'm sorry 1900
[27:41] years or maybe I'll say 14 or 1500 years
[27:44] the churches have had him sealed away

[28:13] Seal of the grave and arose forever more
[28:16] triumph over the grave death hell tombs
[28:20] and every man-made thing there was to
[28:22] show that he was God and cannot be
[28:24] sealed away from the people
[28:27] anymore I don't care who you think you
[28:29] are if God is in you the seal will be
[28:32] Broken Hallelujah why because we have
[28:35] come to declare that he's alive and that

[51:01] Earth it listen if I told you and that's
[51:04] what's wrong don't you think you come
[51:06] here for a
[51:09] picnic now maybe I'm wrong but I've seen
[51:13] I've seen tons of movies and they
[51:14] fighting and they're in war and you talk
[51:16] about the guys that really got it and
[51:18] they know they got it or they they enjoy
[51:20] cutting them heads off I know that sound
[51:22] gruesome but they do they enjoy blowing
[51:25] them boom
[51:30] they enjoy whipping the devil and that's
[51:32] we supposed to enjoy
[51:35] it maybe I'm wrong but that's the way I
[51:38] look at
[51:43] it you know I know amen you know the
[51:46] word of God said don't Rejoice amen
[51:48] because of this you know you cast out
[51:50] these Devils but because your name is
[51:51] written in the book but he didn't say
[51:53] rejoice it wasn't right he said but the
[51:56] main thing is to Rejoice because your
[51:57] name is in the
[52:00] book y'all understand me see that was
[52:03] the rejoice it wasn't wrong it was wrong
[52:05] because of what they were rejoicing over
[52:07] you rejoice because your name is in the
[52:10] book Hallelujah but I don't believe when
[52:13] David slew Goliath amen David's head
[52:15] went down like oh my God I didn't really
[52:17] mean to kill
[52:21] you no sir he wanted to make sure he was
[52:24] eternally dead he didn't wait on the
[52:26] rock he finished it all he went down and
[52:29] he boom took the head off and he took
[52:31] the Bible said he grabbed this man's
[52:33] head and went around the towns like look
[52:35] at it look what my God has
[52:40] done that's shouting the victory
[52:42] Hallelujah that's a
[52:44] testimony and that's what God want us to
[52:47] do every time we whoop the devil we
[52:49] supposed to take it show his head around
[52:51] and said look what my God has
[52:55] done
[52:57] you don't feel sorry for him he ain't
[52:58] feeling sorry for
[53:01] you oh it's the truth you love the
[53:05] Lord amen let me give you one more
[53:07] scripture and I'm going to let you go

[53:10] got communion amen
[53:14] amen I don't know I want to go
[53:16] there let me just finish
[53:20] reading amen when you write a document
[53:24] then it's sealed at the end never sealed
[53:27] until it's finished now the blood of
[53:29] goats and heers and so forth would not
[53:31] take away sin but when this was finished
[53:33] at Calvary it took away sin now watch at
[53:37] the Garden of Eden to keep people from
[53:39] getting back to the tree god Set an
[53:42] anger there as a seal with a sword
[53:45] turning all the way to guard that
[53:47] tree and when he made his
[53:50] worship and he came down now remember
[53:53] who was at that tree who was that tree
[53:56] it was
[53:58] Jesus so he was there Jesus was there he
[54:02] was the tree that God was guarding
[54:06] that's why I said why can't people see
[54:07] the serpent seed because Jesus didn't
[54:10] ask uh Adam and Eve what told you he
[54:14] said
[54:15] who so the tree could
[54:19] talk and the only talking tree that was
[54:21] in there outside of Adam was the
[54:25] S so he was the tree of Good and Evil
[54:30] right Hallelujah come on somebody if he
[54:32] Jesus was the tree of of of life he was
[54:34] the tree of Good and Evil the tree of
[54:36] death was your mother and she brought
[54:38] you here in Natural Life Christ is the
[54:41] birth through spiritual life all that
[54:43] live by the woman die all that born of
[54:46] the man lives and all that comes by the
[54:48] woman is natural all come from the man
[54:51] is spiritual not the man here the man
[54:53] Christ Jesus see I'm so glad he said
[54:56] that cuz I almost can feel a man rolling
[54:57] his rolling
[54:59] his no it's Christ Jesus the man
[55:03] hallelujah amen and and watch the tree
[55:07] guarded it could not get back because
[55:09] there's no offering appr appropriated to
[55:12] take sin away so therefore when they
[55:15] come to worship the shikina glory was
[55:18] behind the veil sealed off from them it
[55:21] was sealed off from the Garden of Eden I
[55:25] can not
[55:27] get it through my head why anybody would
[55:29] not want to worship God in the Shina
[55:32] Globe stay there in the why would you
[55:36] want one out here in the outer
[55:39] Court the weather changes and you
[55:42] change right in the inner court amen the
[55:45] candles go out and you get dark and you
[55:47] can't even see where you're
[55:48] going but in the Shak of Glory it ain't
[55:52] by the son s o n un excuse me it's by
[55:55] the son s o n and that light is the same
[55:59] light that would light the city
[56:04] amen why wouldn't you want to live
[56:08] there it Blossom the Tree
[56:11] Blossom it bued brought forth almonds
[56:15] Hallelujah all it had to do was stay in
[56:17] that shikina you stay in the shikina you
[56:19] won't have to worry about the fruit of
[56:20] the spirit you won't have to worry about
[56:22] gifts you won't have to worry about
[56:24] nothing amen cuz God God will produce it
[56:27] through you just you being in his
[56:30] presence will make the change amen you
[56:33] don't change that tree that little limb
[56:35] that Rod just stood there didn't have
[56:37] nothing to do amen but stand there in
[56:39] the presence and God did the rest that's
[56:41] all we got to
[56:48] do and was the tree God it it could
[56:51] could not get back because there's no
[56:53] offering appropriated to take sin away
[56:55] so therefore when they come to worship
[56:56] the kind of Glory was behind the veil
[56:58] sealed off from them it was sealed off
[57:01] from them from The Garden of even but
[57:03] when the day of Pentecost came brother
[57:05] when Jesus died there at Calvary and
[57:07] finished the work he didn't seal men out
[57:09] he sealed man inside with
[57:13] himself wo and now we're sealed up and
[57:17] shut up in the presence of the of the
[57:19] shakina glory that's the only shut up I
[57:22] want to be shut up in the presence of
[57:25] God
[57:27] amen oh my not only we are sealed in but
[57:30] we're sealed in eternally amen oh I love
[57:33] that sealed inside
[57:36] now I going to stop there but I said to
[57:39] the people of God there even I said you
