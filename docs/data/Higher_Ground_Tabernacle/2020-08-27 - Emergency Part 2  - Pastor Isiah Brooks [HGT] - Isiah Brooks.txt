TRANSCRIPT
========================================
uh foreign so uh bye hey foreign my ah all right oh all right man so uh um oh foreign come back oh so oh oh oh yes oh everybody oh um uh so so uh ah oh uh um god oh uh oh um i believe i left my water back there if somebody could give me some water please we were talking last time we ministered on the emergency and how urgent it is for us not only to see what god is doing thank you brother but become a part of what he's doing we know in the last days that many will fall short when it comes to the perfect will of god and the bible said we ought to be careful like in hebrews i think it's the fourth chapter we ought to be careful as we fall short of his glory of his coming you and i must realize that this is a serious hour but this is an hour that you're going to find yourself alone many times because that's what god wants out of you this is an individual affair and he's looking for those amen who will individually walk with him this is the greatest hour ever we know that this is the ending of it all a friend of mine who i hadn't seen in a long time uh called i called him and anyway we saw each other and called each other however you want to go with that and he said brother books he said he said do you really believe this is the end time or i say yes i really believe that this thing that we're going through now is ushering us into the coming of the lord and it's amazing because he being one that who's uh uh haven't declared himself to be a christian yet but he believes that the hour that we're now living is the end time and he has been following certain things on the news and things like that and so i tried to tell him some things even about what how it's going to end up this is the beginning somewhat of a new relationship with him and i trust that god will give me wisdom and unders to understand where he's at and what i need to do to minister to him to say all of those things we talked about uh the urgency and we we know that the urgency it deals with the seven seals and the un uh the uh uh the the seven thunders and the this end time message see william branham and when he came being the seventh angel message juror he literally came for the purpose that god would use him in the opening of the seals and the revealing of the seven thunders that was his main message and everything else he just pulled together like elijah and tied up all the loose ends but he left us with something and only the spiritual eye will ever catch we'll be able to catch it this seven message the seven thunders we we we look at uh thousands of people now that say that they're in the message but because they say that it doesn't say that it's true many could have said in the days of moses we're in the message of moses and we find out that the majority of the people that followed moses was lost and jesus christ being the same yesterday today and forever it's going to be the same you're going to find out as the day goes on and the coming of the lord gets closer you're going to find out that there'll be many people who would compromise the word and compromise their lives and really they can't not help it only the bride of jesus christ will be able to accomplish the purpose of god and it won't be her doing it's not by power not by might but by the spirit of the lord god himself is the one who's working this thing out is that right because paul said is not i that lives but christ that lives in me one of the most difficult things for us to do is to let go and let god our daily struggle is not with just satan and our greatest struggle is with self and self will and when god can get a man to deny his own will to serve god's his will then he knows that he has a great man in his hands let's put it this way paul said i am a prisoner of christ and and paul shows how he was such a prisoner because when god told him not to go a place he didn't go hallelujah even though his heart desire was to go a place he didn't go he served god according to god's will and not his own we realize by god's grace that we're talking about a meeting in the air we're talking about the the end time we're talking about how god is trying to get us to a place that we can be translated to me i think it's just such a slap in satan's face when satan wake up and realize that all that he fought for and everything he tried to establish has become to naught it becomes ruined and we realize amen that god is god and and he does things the way he wants to do them but in my studying i was just thinking about the rapture because that's what my whole goal is is not not to make a rapture only you know i'm not not trying to serve god to to miss hell i serve god because i love him i get disappointed in myself because i mean i fail him every day sometimes i look at myself and i think to myself how can god put up with me but really he doesn't have a choice because he chose me and when god chooses you he never goes back on his choosing it's it's a perfect choosing thank god because he know that if adam and eve had not fallen he knows that my earnest desire is to do his perfect will he knows that in spite of all my frailties in spite of all my faults in spot fight of spite of all my my failures he knows the inner man and he knows by his grace that this man who is so frail and this man who falls so often one day will not be that way amen because there is a power that's working on the inside and this power is his power conquering death conquering darkness conquering every demon of hell you love the lord anyway brother branham tells us that every song is inspired he talks about the psalms and he said i believe they were songs but i'm gonna read this little quote before i start my message brother balaam says amen in the message thirst any things that in the bible is inspired whether it's history whether it's songs whether it is it is whatever it is it's inspired jesus said have not you read what david said in the psalms and then i think psalms of course is songs and if songs are inspired of god which i believe they are and prophetic also i hope i am standing that day when this song comes to pass there is going to be a meeting in the air in that sweet sweet by-and-by going to meet you and greet you over there in that home beyond the sky such singing ever heard ever heard by mortal's ear it'll be glorious i declare and god's own son will be the leading one at that meeting in the air he said oh i want to be there at that time and that's why it's an urgency to me that's why it's an emergency to me the bible says make your calling and election sure make it sure don't we're not in an hour that we should be hoping this is the hour of no soul make your calling and election sure let me tell you something which a lot of people don't understand when the message caught you when it calls you when it opened to you and it made you see that this is the message and this message is none other than jesus christ in word form and when you caught that message and you realize to you it was a pearl it was something that you've been looking for and it is something that you know you could never give up you understand me you know that is a token if i could say it like this it's it's it's something that declares you to be bribed because you can't give it up and it can't give you up no matter how many people have and whatever interpretations they have it doesn't affect you because you have a personal revelation of jesus christ yourself something this message has done for you that no one else can do for you and that little something anchors you and that little something will cause you to grow into the full statue of christ which is a new birth think about it in the beginning in ephesus age people were birthed into faith they didn't know what what what we know per se now of course they had all of the statues the divine nature of god otherwise they could not have been called christians and they could have not have been doing what they were doing and understand by god's grace the thing that that irked or disturbed the world of that day is because these people had no particular dwelling place and you know they were roaming everywhere interrupting everybody pulling people out of churches pulling people off the street and these people disturbed the regular church system and they couldn't help it because it was christ in them causing them to do what they were doing now we we want to say it like this and identify masterpiece the prophet of god said you better have christ in you because that's the word eternal and that word is what will raise you up again you become part of that word and you identified with the word i wondered why he kept saying in different places that you must be a part of that word it means that every portion of the word every segment of the word whether it was from emphasis all the way up they had a part of the word that was that was their part and they had to live that part hallelujah and but when it comes to us the full word is now in our possession not just the part of food the full word now i want you to understand i'm not speaking intellectually here now because there's no way that i could grasp the entire book in my head hallelujah but there's the author there's the one who created this who spoke this right he's the one that i can have and i can have all of him not just a portion but all of him and i'm explaining that in just a moment when we talk about anticipation i don't know about you but i am in anticipation and i realize that in this time that we're waiting god is doing a mighty work in the believer so many people around this message cannot even see what god is doing and god will leave them in their folly because we are at a time that we must focus focus on one thing and that is the what if that is what is the will of god for my day and whatever that will is that's what i'm going to do now we can see and look at brother branham we can see what the messenger did and what god used him for and all of those things and we have no idea the the pressure and the things he had to go through in order to be who he was and to deliver this message knowing that 90 of the people that he was preaching to was in opposition to what he was preaching he stood alone because he had an anchor something anchored him and and and he couldn't get away from it he was like paul he was a prisoner he had to even speak amen things that he didn't want to speak but he spoke it anyway just to do the will of god and you and i must understand that that's where we must come to you know i can't you know have my will and his will too you can't be like eve i'm gonna have my will and his will too it won't work that's why he said we must die and rot daily we must die and rot when we talk about anticipation i am anticipating god to do a mighty work in me he's working now he's working but there's more of him to come this is what the the mystery somewhat of this the seven seals and the seven thunders is all about those seven thunders were for a special people anybody could read the seals perhaps and get an idea what it's all about but when it comes as i preached the last time about that scroll that seal scroll that part of the scroll that only the the the owner knew what it what was on on the ledger of it and we find out that god amen has something in that for us because those scrolls were then loosed call it the seven thunders if you like it was revealed it was unveiled and it's in there it's in there he said to israel we're going to possess this land again and what land you're talking about the land that adam lost not just it wasn't just for that day it was a word of prophecy not just for israel alone but all who believe all who receive all of sons and daughters of god god has promised we're going to possess that land and listen it won't be ragged it won't be void it won't be messed up like lucifer did it in the beginning it's going to be a beautiful place can you imagine no bills to pay no headaches no sicknesses no thunderstorms nothing of this world will would ever come up as a memory nothing all that we see all that we feel all that we hear all that we see and you and i know that the bible is right everything that god has prophesied has come to pass is that right he told noah it was going to rain it rained he told israel amen after 400 years i'm going to visit you and i'm going to bring you out of egypt he did it hallelujah he prophesied that jesus christ was coming he came he prophesied he would uh uh defeat satan death hell in the grave he enraged from the dead and he did it everything the bible promised he promised us malachi 4 and he came think about it thousands of years before malachi 4 came but he came so it doesn't matter how long it takes once god prophesied or speak a word it must come to pass hallelujah it cannot fail don't you say oh well lord i don't ask you for this and it's been a long a long time what is a long time abraham had to wait 25 years for his promise to come to pass but he never disbelieved the promise doesn't matter i'm going to see perfection i'm going to see christ in me fully i'm going to see the third pool in action he promised it so will you let me move on anticipation means to realize beforehand or foretaste or foresee or to anticipate pleasure to expect look forward to to be sure of is that right it's like anna and simeon they were anticipating the coming of the messiah and like i tried to tell people i said god comes in such a way we if he doesn't reveal it to you you won't see it everybody was looking for the coming of the messiah and anna and simeon saw it before anyone else hallelujah and then he goes on for 12 years right and then they see him already in the temple what was he doing that little boy at 12 years old was confounding the wise hallelujah and he declared to even uh his uh uh mary and joseph who he was hallelujah he told him she said i'm about my father's business hallelujah y'all understand what i'm saying what was he doing somehow mary had forgotten who he was she forgot the visitation of the angel and god comes along and revealed it so let me say it like this how often what is it that people don't understand god has appointed time to reveal himself to you everybody don't get revelation at the same time it's in god's own time in his own period before he reveals himself to you and every time he reveals it to you it will be according it would be in a way that you can understand who he is how many of us would have seen him like anna and simeon there in the temple in the bay as a babe and they knew this was the messiah yet thomas and all the others walked with him for three and a half years and still didn't see who he really was and jesus had to pull the question out who do men say that i am huh that what do you understand what i'm saying people in the message expect for you to read this message and understand it perfectly even this message unfolds to individuals at different times hallelujah what are you going to say about paul who never saw jesus christ in the flesh hallelujah but he came out of the desert with a greater revelation than the 12 that followed him hallelujah he came out and guess what he superseded all of the others in his revelation so much so that peter said paul speaks and right things that are sometimes hard to be understood hallelujah why because even paul didn't have just a intellectual revelation he had a revelation amen an inspiration amen that came from god that he visited god hallelujah is that all right visited heaven so you say well what are you saying all of these things because i want you to understand the message god whole creation everything had a three-fold purpose he had a three-pole purpose but his main objection his whole thing was to have preeminence over his oh all of his creation is that right the first thing he told adam adam i want you to subdue i want you to have preeminence of everything i have created for you i want you to have preeminence is that right that's what he said i want you to be god over all that i've given you i want you to have preeminence understand where i'm talking about if that was what was given to adam in the beginning it is the same thing that's given to us hallelujah this is what the opening of the word was all about you know even in all my preaching i still got people criticizing what i'm preaching but it doesn't matter i'm preaching to the bride of jesus and i'm preaching the portion of the word in which god has given me i'm not wrestling against somebody else's theology or somebody else's explanation of what they have that's not what i won't have to give account for that i must give an account only for what god is revealing to me hallelujah people let me tell you something brother branham said if you cannot live your revelation you have the wrong revelation hello of christ of christ if you can't have if you say oh brother that's why i was trying to tell the lord the other day i says lord you know i'm so tired of my foolishness you know what the problem is i gotta let go and let god my will must die in every aspect of my life i must rot and i'm willing to do so think about it now we're in a day and i don't mean to go so slow but we're in a day we hear people talking about the mighty angel revelation 10 1 has come down don't you know it's more to that than that it's more to that than knowledge and if he came down where is he who was he it was christ and that mighty angel came down and he's still here oh i got something if i could just put it to you the way god gave it to me it's going to be a blessing to you brother brown says just think of it an angel clothed in a cloud and a rainbow covered over his head while you know what it is that is put one foot on the land and one foot on the sea and lifted up his hand and swore that when them seven thunders utter divorce that time would be no more time will be no more everything is winding up everything is ending up and we've had this message since 63 and what have you seen in it y'all understand what i'm saying why because we developed a system instead of getting the people of christ we brought them to a system i keep saying that because we need christ we need the holy ghost it is the holy ghost that leads us the system can never get us to heaven it's an old trick of the devil no trick it's not just just just uh uttering what brother branham said because that's exactly what those pharisees and sadducees said to jesus well moses said huh and jesus had to correct him and says before abraham was i am huh he he was trying to get them to see something but they could not see it because they were blinded because the word said they would be blinded not boasting against israel they were blinded for us who the gentiles would come in now we're living in the same day same kind of day where the gentiles are blinded hallelujah blinded to the truth they want their systems they want their their their their their cane offering it didn't work then and it won't work now hallelujah think about it he said when them seven thunders utter their voices that time would be no more and if the ministry now brother branham he's working with something because he's trying to fill it out he's a prophet he's filling the pool and he's saying now and that's why he ministered is this the sign of the time so he he has a question mark because he's he's trying to figure out what this pool is what is god doing here well it's just the time he knows there's a portion of the word that has to be opened and he knows that and he's looking at it inside he's trying to get over to the people because so many super natural things are happening around this time and he's trying to get us to see now this is in 1962. this is what 2020. and you and i we we're still slugging along instead of looking into the word of god like he said laying in the presence of the son it ain't about reading it's about meditating on it it's about letting god take that word from your head and place it into your heart if the ministry of the mysteries of god is finished what if that is then seven mysteries coming forth you already said if the mystery of god if it's finished then what is those seven thunders coming forth what is it what if that is the seven mysteries coming forth or a humble little church like ours that the almighty has come and regarded the lower state of his people just to say what i don't think so it might be not be but if it is then time has run out did you think it be serious it may be later than we think now if time was running out then think about where we are now that's the trick of the devil i know it's difficult amen if you're planting tater potatoes to continue plant potatoes but if you have an assurance that when the raptor take place you can plant your potatoes in fact you can you can harvest and cook them too because you know no matter what you do you're going you understand when we talk about mnd the election of god and i love that because when i think about the election of god i realized by god's grace that he chose me there's no way that i could work myself into this bride and no matter how much i listen to this message day by day day by day if i'm not bright i'll never catch it i never understand it and it's so simple but everybody make it so deep so complicated you know what i'm saying and you know and that's the way the devil the devil showed uh eve science and god told eve they could have babies by faith but she wanted science she wanted the complicated way and she got it right so listen he goes on and says he says these stars falling into their constellation back yonder that angel coming and said as john was sent to wind up the old testament and to bring forth the introduction of christ a message will wind up the loose ends and we'll introduce the messiah just before his coming the message of the last days and i'm thinking now okay we're looking we're looking way out there right and here he's introduced the messiah and messiah came amen when you say oh i don't believe that you don't have to but my point is where are you going to fit what happened in 1963 in the bible it has to be there it's got to be there and it is there now i know some people well he's here and brother said there will be a corporal coming however he does it that's his business brother branham said amen god will interpret his own word but you can't dismiss the cloud you can't dismiss the seven thunders you can't do that that is the fullness of the message that is the thing that god hid from the foundation of the world and i'm gonna try to explain as much of it as i possibly can now there's a part that i'll never be able to explain brother branham couldn't do it himself hallelujah there's a part of that that only god will explain to you that's how intimate the relationship must be right now he's come in 1963. you see him you see him on earth and you see him in heaven is that y'all get it all right because in revelation 10 1 when the mighty angel was up there there was also the seventh angel down on the earth and that seventh angel was reflecting the mighty angel and what god was doing in that day he was introducing he was trying to show you the scripture says look up for your redemption darth 9 when when all this chaotic stuff starts don't be so concerned with it look up at the cloud look up at the promise look up what at the head the capstone oh i can't i wish i could say it like i see it because i want you to realize it's more to it that's why the devil attacked it this year in this season right he didn't have nobody else's doctrine to attack but he attacked the cloud to say it ain't real it wasn't there it didn't happen and i want to tell everybody that says stupid stuff like that you're too late it doesn't happen and he done did it hallelujah and what people don't understand is that the word that he gave us was the very head the intelligence of god intelligence of god it was something that the devil never had hallelujah he said what are you saying brother brooke oh oh you let me hurry up let me hurry up but the whole point that he brought this for is that he came so that we can have preeminence now i'm gonna unfold by god's grace try to get to where i need to go because paul when he says i'm a prisoner of christ a lot of us don't even know what that is yet because we got too much will still living we all got to die we want to be a prisoner but the only way we can be is we must die and rock to our own will it is a process hello now you and i must understand the first thing was that that god wanted to do was to reveal himself to his people that was the main thing that he wanted to do especially after the fall that was part of the redemption that's why when he pulled abraham he abraham didn't know him abraham didn't even know who he was but god knew who abraham was and so god wanted to reveal himself to abraham and you can see through abraham's path through his way of going god revealed himself in so many ways jehovah jar and things like that those were just portions of god portions of his character that he wanted to his creation to see and that's the way brother brown said god wants his creation to see the fullness of himself what's all in him because you know when we get to heaven we don't want any questions i wonder whether he can do this i wonder whether he can do that it's here that he's proving he he's proving himself to us he is god and think about it he's trying to get you to see that you are too you are part of him that's what this whole thing is that's why we can't be part of a denomination or organization or any man's system we're free born we must stay freeborn the threefold purpose of god prophet god said first to express himself completely god in christ and the bible tells us that in jesus dwelt the fullness of the godhead bodily second to have the preeminence like this in his church which is his body the bride till he could have the preeminence to express himself through them did y'all hear what i said it's hard hey somebody help me here what it is brother branham when he talks about the third pool did you know the third pool you know he had three pools and three foes to his his ministry is that right yes that's what he did and we understood the third four what we call it oh it's the opening of the word opening of the word what is the opening of the word it's the revealing it's when the word that has now kept his mouth shut is beginning to speak right because you can't seal up nobody's word the only way you seal up a word is to seal the mouth you don't speak it and when daniel sealed up the book he sealed up the word there was nothing being spoken it was a secret and even throughout the ages these theologians they looked through the word they tried to unbreak to break the word but it wouldn't speak back to them why because they needed a prophet it takes a prophet it meant to unveil the the the written word to speak the revelation of what god has written that's what it takes and thirdly to restore the kingdom to its rightly position that fell by sin by the first adam back to where he walked in the cool of the evening with his people remember the cool of the evening brother amen right to walk in the cool of the evening i know i'm i'm i'm kind of on a teaching thing but it's okay because i want you to see that you can't stop where you are you got to press you got to press you got to keep moving don't let so many things occupy your life you got to press i realize satan's going to cause you to do he'll put things in your way so easily if you don't shut him down he'll have you wasting hours a day that's what he is he knows what god is trying to do but he doesn't understand god always have a backup system hallelujah because when god can't help you get you to do it he knows how to make you do it is that right ask jonah if you don't believe me right so we realize by god's grace he didn't doing what what does this word come thoroughly to restore the kingdom to his righteously position that failed by the sin by the first adam back to where he walked in the cool of the evening with his people talk with them fellowship with them and now sin and death hath separated them from his presence and his entire expression do you read it do you read it before the foundation of the world to express all of his attributes of what he was that's what it was all about god creating and expressing all of his attributes and you and i must understand what it's all about because you're part of it you are part of the expression of god's attributes and and he's not going to stop he can't fail if the word of god is in you it has to be made manifest and it doesn't matter god will put conditions on you to bring forth his expression hallelujah now see that's why it's urgent because we don't have time to play we really don't you know here was israel amen in the wilderness with moses and he's up on the mountain getting the word of word from god right the tablet's from god and the children of israel are down there playing and everybody that basically played died was that right that's the scripture the ones that that that moses threw the tablets and and and opened up and the earth swallowed them up is that right but even the remain of that generation still died and god never forgave them you can't disrespect this word and act like it ain't there you hear it preach and then you walk over it anyhow you can't do that and expect god not to judge you is that right you think about it when it comes amen to uh uh uh it can't he he probably thought you know he had been cross over and everything was all right take a few wedges and of silver and gold and uh garment and all that and then god judges him and god just doesn't judge him he judges the whole church thousands of souls i believe it was killed at that time because one man decided he wanted to steal right think about what's happening people that's why i'm so glad it's an individual walk hallelujah i'm so glad because if we had to rest on this church and and then and the sanctification of it we'll be in trouble y'all getting quiet but it's the truth we would be in trouble if my sanctification rested on somebody else's hallelujah or my holiness rested on somebody else's whether they would do right or wrong i would be in trouble thank god for grace now we find out also in this this the sixth seal now being open it was four thresh threefold purpose now here was the purposes did you understand what he said and i it took me a while to even understand the sixth seal being open and what brother brown says that it's the sixth seventh seal open under the sixth right and you gotta understand all of those seals have been openly opening during the church ages even when the church aged messengers and those who followed him didn't even know what was going on they followed him and those seals were being opened and god it was a mystery and you know it's the truth how did the that little church survived during a thousand years of reign of darkness by the catholic church but understand god has never left himself without a witness hallelujah god has never left himself without a witness i don't care what everybody is doing around this message you better put this thing into your heart and live it with all you got don't look at your neighbor if they're doing what they let them do it i love this thing when brother adam said there are some people that god won't let them do certain things i'm one of them there's certain things that trouble me that i find out that doesn't trouble other people the first thing was the sleeping virgin had to go through the tribulation period for purification she had to be purged of her sins and of her unbelief and rejected the message this she was done in tribulation period we see they wind up over here in revelation 7 between the 6th and the 7th chapter here that she had been purged and she had been given her roles now she is not the bride but it's the church the pure people that that didn't have the opportunity maybe to receive the message or in some way that they were blinded by these false prophets and they didn't get a chance and yet they're really sincere in heart and god knows their heart and their they are purged during this time now understand me we would have never known this had not those seals been opened we would have never known this i tried when i was in denominations to read revelations and i quit because i couldn't understand a thing only but blessed is he that readeth so i think if i can read it i'll be blessed praise the lord you notice that another purging time that's for the israel when she gathers that's the second fold god purges israel in the tribulation period out of the millions that's gathered there there'll be a selection 144 000 and they will be purged also god is purging israel that's another fold notice there's a whole earth is to be purged right purging of the foolish virgin persian of israel now purging of the whole world that's three right okay he says now persian there will be such thing that the moon the stars and all nature will be purged do you see what it is the earth is renewing herself being purged getting ready for the millennium hello so you hear what he's saying this is your opportunity god is purging you through the preaching of the word that you might wash yourself that he might wash you by the water of the word this is your cleaning up time so that you can be filled you see because it must have no spot of blemishes and that could only come by the word manifested and let me hurry up because i know we're tired here listen now notice on the opening of the seventh seal it is also a threefold mystery this one was speaking have spoke that it is the mystery of the seven thunders the seven thunders in heaven will unfold this mystery it will be right at the coming of christ because christ said no one knew when he would return hello so when you're looking at the image that's in the cloud that is the coming of christ it ain't all over yet but you got to understand what he's doing and i'm going to read a quote that i found that's going to really be a blessing to you it'll be right at the coming of christ right it has to be christ brother branham turn that to the right it was christ right and so anyway he said because christ said no one would would know when he would return so therefore there was a returning because it was christ now that's what he said right did you notice when the jews ask him uh that he said no when we compare the scriptures here with matthew 24 the sixth seal the seventh seal was left out because you see christ said only himself would know not even the angels know one it was even written it was wasn't written even written you see they they they hushed nothing take place then angels don't know it nobody knows when it's coming but there be see seven voices what i'm trying to get y'all to see some things that have already taken place and we're still looking for it it's in your face but i had not seen exactly well oh my god i hold my i don't want to i don't want to quote this thing until i get to here i mean this is what you call anticipation i'm excited but see there are seven voices of these thunders and that will reveal the great revelation at that time so i believe so if we don't know it it will it won't be known till that time but it will be revealed in that day in the hour that is supposed to be revealed in so the thing for us to do is to be reverent before god now he's basically saying it's ooh it's open but i i want you to know there's a time in this thing for me to unfold it to the people that's what it's been everybody even in the message have tried to you know tell you what it is i can't even tell you what it is but i'ma let give you some something but i want you to understand it's an individual revelation that god has given you and it sets you free when you see by god's grace what this thing has done for me or you know it sets you free it doesn't mean that you don't have any more thoughts or failures but it sets your soul free because it's been revealed to you you know this is a message you know that was christ hallelujah you know that was a coming hallelujah and you know that the word that was brought to you was a full word if brother branham in his ministry tied up the loose ends that means everything that was loose out there he brought it and he compiled compounded and it became those pieces became a whole am i making sense we find that the sixth seal has been open to us and we see it and we know that this seventh seal cannot be broken to the to the public until that hour arrived now there's come some reason that god let this seven voices be thundered because it must come see we find that christ the lamb took the book in his hand and he opened the seventh seal but you see it's a hidden mystery no no one knows it now brother batman he talked about the seven seals and understand he's talking in parables he's working with parables because the intellectual won't get this but he don't want to point to himself but he's trying to work it so you can have an idea it must be a revelation to you of who he is and not because he says i am the seventh angel messenger and he could have easily said it because jesus said to that woman at the well i am he we know when the messiah come he's going to tell us of all these things he says i am he so he could have easily said it right and in terms he did say it but you know if you don't have a spiritual ear you won't hear it now there was some reason that god let this seven voices be thundered because it must come we find that christ the lamb took the book in his hand and he opened the seventh seal is that right now watch this this is what i was trying to tell you the fall the fall of it when jesus christ when christ the lamb took the seal took the book it was silenced in heaven but that same book the angel gave to john and it was no long no silence you understand me and john falls down to worship the angel and the angel says no get up john worship god in other words in this message there is no worshipping of men no worshipping of men this is not about a man this is about god and god gives a book amen to john and tell john you must eat it eat it all up because you're going to prophesy again and brother adam said that john represented the pride hallelujah she becomes a prophet because he's a prophet is the truth he didn't give her another book he gave her the book and that book was redemption that book also uh uh in the book was inheritance everything that redemption brought was in the book and john 8 and so therefore everything that belonged everything in the book belonged to john that's why paul said we're joiners with christ y'all understand me join us with christ that's the foe that was left out nobody knew we understood always sinners saved by grace but we are we never denomination could never teach you this that god's whole purpose was to make you a god a part of him that he could live through your life numbers that no man can number but it's still god working out his old salvation with his children hello i'm jumping listen brother adam says in christ the mystery of god revealed he says it is the bride that's the original tree the original spirit the revelation come from christ not denomination christ let me read that again it's the bride that's the original tree you understand me so it identifies you if you can believe this message he said not just with your head but if you can receive it that identifies you as the original tree and he said when that original tree bring forth a branch it will do the exact thing that the first church did hallelujah come on you say oh they're coming a time and people don't want to believe it i believe in all my heart i don't know how short a period of time it will be but there's going to be a mount zion showdown and she's going to show who she is it won't be by preaching because some of us can't help preach those people out there but when it comes to action and demonstration when it comes to the very life of christ he's going to show up the world who you are and then we'll go up with him satan has a question and and here is his answer christ is risen and has paid the price for our redemption what god what god in christ manifested he gave that flesh that the blood that in that blood might come the life and that flesh he redeemed and that god in this redeemed flesh could manifest the word for the day as he did in that day glory what was brother branham trying to tell the people look at me i'm nothing but look at my actions look what i'm doing i'm doing nothing but look what's being done and he was trying to get the people to see that this is jesus christ working as the son of man in my life and he's doing such a thing i have no control i'm a prisoner of his i i'm doing what he wants me to do that's that's the same thing jesus declared i can do nothing except i see the father do it and that's what brother i'm trying to say i don't give myself vision i don't have no healing power but because of the vessel i am it's christ in me he said basically i'm trying to tell you there's a fullness of christ in me it didn't make brother branham the man it was christ the fullness of christ he did exactly what jesus did and then he comes around and tells i got a quote where that same fullness is going to be in the bride of jesus christ we will no longer continue to be fragmented we'll be one unit can you imagine amen being able to not only know how each other's assault but to connect so much to our whole goal would be the same one mind amazing then we stand justified he said then he said he said then we stand justified in the presence of god as a drop of ink dropping into a tub full of bleach you'll never find that stain of the ink no more it went somewhere it'll never come back and when man is truly redeemed that predestinated seed that sees it and accepts it he said his sins are demolished it's gone it's separated it drops into the ink of the blood of jesus christ and it's never to be remembered now how many all know that we say we know it and every day we allow the devil to dupe us to make us think we're not going to make it when the blood of jesus christ is vanquished your sins are gone demolished right and you say well oh brother brooks what are you saying all i'm trying to tell you i know you've heard it before perhaps you have all i'm trying to tell you is this if the god of heaven don't show you where you are now you'll never know where you got to go i'm telling you if you think that we've got all these years and maybe we do i don't know but by what i am seeing and i am seeing that the lord can get take the rapture and make it happen right now and still be scriptural and we're looking for events we're looking for events when the greatest event has already happened is that right he declared it brother bam said when he turned his back to the audience and began to call people names out what was he doing showing that this was not a man's doing this was jesus christ on the scene the same one that was there in abraham's day is still alive oh my god and everybody missed it because you know what they were looking at the man they weren't looking at the man in the time that he was coming he tried to tell him okay in other words i couldn't be here except it be the days of noah in the days of sodom that's when the son of man will be revealed that's the days we're living in and so that in itself this is why somebody said well malachi brother venom was not malachi for you know like say what you want to say i have a i have an understanding of this word god interprets his own word now tell me who brother branham was by the interpretation you understand me by looking at all that he did he got to be in the bible somewhere it has to be there and the bible said when that spirit of elijah come amen the fire is about to fall look what brother says he said we stand justified in christ before him because we cannot he cannot pass judgment for he's already judged that body in which i am a part of he judged jesus's body he became sin that we might become righteousness his righteousness we're not just oh lord if you could just see it the way i see it amen you might think i'm blaspheming if i say it the way i see it but all i'm kind of trying to tell you i'm trying to read to you what he just said he cannot pass judgment but he's already judged that body in which i am a part of what how am i part of it here it is it's in me if you abide in me and my words in you then what you say or ask the father anything in my name it be done see because it's there justified glory to god oh if i could just get the world to see that why there you are there is the body of christ living standing redeemed redeemed oh my hallelujah justify in the sight this is i'm coming to where i want to go we are justified we are his victory the church is his victory we come forth in his last days with the glorious gospel showing his victory he died for the this purpose we are we are proof of his victory amen hallelujah we are proof of his victory amen we see him coming down living among the church that's his victory shows that he couldn't keep him in the grave neither can they keep us that's the truth we'll already potentially arise because we're raised from dead unbelief in the word in his word from denomination and creed to an eternal word of the young did y'all hear he's potentially we're already raised raised from unbelief in his word and from denominational crease and to eternal word of the eternal god which is him himself working through us manifesting himself that he in the same is the same yesterday today and forever and then here i go this is it i hope it hit you the way it hit me i hope it ain't one of those revelations you at all but my point i hope it hits you like it hit me then the word moves listen because we're talking about the capstone we're talking about the head we're talking about christ we're talking about those seven seals that he brought we talk about amen the authority and everything that came with that right the authority that came with it was the authority that the that the mighty angel had he put his one land on the sea and one right and one on land one foot on the land and one on the sea that means he possessed everything he possessed everything that book was a representation of himself it was the word he is the word he will always be the word you know that in heaven you ain't going to go there and you're going to find a little book god ain't up there flipping pages it's symbolic is that right brother said the book of revelation is the book of symbols it's symbolic jesus i am the bread of life we ain't going to heaven to eat him it's the receiving of the word and then the word moves on down into the body from the head i'm going to say that again the word moves on down in the body from the head so the head had to come and you have to be connected to the head in order for the power of the head to move down through the body hallelujah what is it the same word nothing can be added or taken from it so that same word moves from the head listen as he says how he says as the day comes close down into the body down into the body vindicating that they are one so as we move closer to the coming to to the rapture you're going to find out that that same word that was in william branham will be ministering oh you say that ain't scripture it is you got elijah and you got elisha and the bride of jesus christ is elisha she didn't get a different mantle she got the same mantle the same word the same god reflecting is that right because you got to see they say oh they were called christians at antioch where the lord jesus christ had already been crucified buried risen but his same spirit come downs on the believer hallelujah they can say william branham is dead but what they understand that the same spirit the same holy ghost the same god that was with william branham comes down to the believer and she does the same watch the same things that was done then hallelujah is that right because the problem of god said we're going to have a showdown janice and jambridge they live too hallelujah but one thing about the bride she has the ability to create that's part of the third pool that's what he was trying to tell you you and i are coming back to where we were before the fall back into eden where we will subdue all everything see the bride ain't gonna go out here like a coward she's coming out of here victorious oh lift up the gates and be ever lifted up oh see we're getting ready to it's a move of god that's moving and a lot of people don't see it hallelujah ah there's a move in the bush the mulberry tree there's a move and what people don't see it they they just don't see it but let me tell you something don't be deceived don't be deceived because when god called lazarus from the grave nobody saw what was happening back there hallelujah a rotted man hardly knew that same voice he may pull every element together in a matter of minutes hallelujah you understand me it doesn't take god it don't take god long to do what he needs to do hallelujah yeah is that the truth you take that little storm that wind that came through here that was the worst storm i ever experienced in my life i lived in south carolina and experienced part a part of a hurricane it didn't tear up like it did here you understand me it didn't take long did it again huh right now we're still seeing the the the remains of his fierceness hallelujah and i ain't gonna kill you i was caught in a casey's and i wasn't going out i thought in just a moment time i'm gonna see a whirlwind it was bad ah the only good thing i got out of that was some free hot dogs and then when i got out there to go to my car the wind knocked them out of my hand i said well lord i wasn't supposed to eat those you see what i'm saying so you look at these things your brothers what are you saying look what's it so that the same word moves from the head that's why the seals and these thunders that that god go listen i'm gonna tell you what you need to do go listen to christ is the mystery of god revealed you'll find out something there you'll see something there that has been hidden brother branham is telling you something that other fold of of of the third foe of the thunders what it was there to do it it was come to now enter into you to bring you you understand me you become the thunders it comes to enter into you and give you the the revelation of what it is to be like god the very thing that lucifer wanted he wanted the chosen bread y'all understand me he wanted to be like god because you know i don't know how he saw it but he adam come and adam is just like god and he killed that that scene but he didn't know that god was working right all the time in his midst everybody that died that was the seed of god god packed him to paradise hallelujah and then when he raised from the dead god took him out of paradise and put him under the heaven hallelujah and guess what he's getting ready to do it again hallelujah that same god hallelujah spoke is that right remember if you check out the quotes brother brahm said when when when jesus raised from the dead he said it was that mighty angel that came down like a fire and stood before the before the two the same mighty angel but yet the mighty angel was laying there you see what i'm saying what people don't understand when god came down when the mighty angel came down amen and that big stone rolled away hallelujah jesus was gone what and as that new testament started the end of the new new testament ended is that right because jesus told his disciples when he began to sin he said in like manner i will come again lord have mercy in life he didn't say just like it he said in like man it's going to be something similar the way i went up is the way i come down and he did it come down as the judge hallelujah oh my god amen and as that day get closer come down into the body down into the body vindicating that they are one they are husband and wife their flesh of his flesh word of his word life of his life spirit of his spirit see amen how do you know it bears the same record same fruit same word manifestation of christ same life same god same spirit same word same book amen same signs things that i do shall you also oh hallelujah what's he saying despite this thing it ain't all over yet the bride has a little day it ain't all over yet people say the bride is in revival but my goodness i'll be glad when when when maybe she is because i know i am and brother branham described revival he said getting the trash out of your life hmm this is the last i got more but this is the end he said no this vindicated word in his body in his very is his victory and the reason of his death see the death not in the spirit when he died he only died in the flesh his spirit went to hell and preached to the souls in prison that right his flesh only died then he raised it up again and quickened it quicken means made alive his flesh which was his body and that's the word has been laying dead for years but it's gradually beginning to come into the formation for she is standing upon her feet remember brother branham ties the same thought into ezekiel dry bones and dry bones when they came together got the sunu and all then she was standing her feet and the next thing was left was the wind and she says she's standing on her feet the next move is god is that all right okay let's stand i'll just stop there one more quote in closing he said i love you don't forget the commandments of god to you little children love one another love everybody right or wrong sinner or saint love them anyhow if you don't then pray god to help you because god loved the sinner and the nature of god is in you if the man is wrong love him anyhow don't partake of his cnc don't partake of his sins but in sweetness not in sourness and rebuke and sweetness tell him of the hope of life that rests within you through jesus christ being revealed to you by the holy ghost i think i know that's what bride is brother the message the message has always been love that's why cain was able to slay his brother right he demonstrated for the first what hatred was and murder and the bible said if you hate a brother in your heart you're a murderer especially without a cause i just trust and i'ma tell you that's what's being tested more now than ever l-o-v-e love that's yo that's your your lot what god expressed you know what let me tell you this you know why i love this age because it is love and the bible said love never failed love is not puffed up love not don't seek your own go read it it's amazing it's amazing and god don't want you to just memorize it in your head he wants it to be lived and the only way you can live that is that god in you living he's the only one that knows what love is you understand me in moments like this i'll sing out a song i'll sing a [Music] i lived my hand i lift up my hands [Music] i [Music] see you know [Music] i a
