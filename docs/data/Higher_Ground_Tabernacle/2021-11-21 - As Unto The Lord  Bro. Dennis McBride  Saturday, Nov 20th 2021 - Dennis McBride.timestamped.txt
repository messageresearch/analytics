[31:20] [Music]
[31:22] heavenly father
[31:26] by your grace lord you've given us
[31:27] experiences
[31:30] throughout the ordained journey that you
[31:32] ordained for each one of our lives
[31:34] [Music]
[31:35] to bring us to a place lord god to where
[31:38] you can be more real to us than what you
[31:41] were before
[31:43] and no doubt father each one of us have
[31:45] seen
[31:47] in the particular way that you've made
[31:49] yourself known to us father as you rose
[31:51] up in the midst of our troubles
[31:54] our times of weakness father god you've
[31:56] shown yourself to be the mighty god that
[31:59] you are
[32:01] so therefore lord as we sing that song
[32:03] father god is more than just a song
[32:07] but it's become a reality to us lord
[32:09] that's the only reason why we're here
[32:12] tonight father god is because it's your
[32:14] strength lord that's preserved us
[32:17] it's by your power father god that
[32:19] you've kept us
[32:20] and all we can say is thank you to them
[32:23] thank you for all that you are
[32:25] all that you've been to us father god
[32:28] well that's all we can say is just thank

[32:38] although we didn't come to see a man or
[32:39] to hear from them

[34:11] from the first time i heard a minister
[34:15] even up until now
[34:17] it's just an effective ministry
[34:22] i've watched god work through that
[34:24] ministry
[34:28] and the many lives that god has has
[34:30] touched through that vessel
[34:41] but the lord is continuing to live
[34:42] through them
[34:45] in the ordained places that he sent them
[34:47] to them
[34:50] and it's a real work
[34:53] real results and real lives
[34:57] hey man that that proves that it's
[34:59] really god should i prove
[35:02] [Music]
[35:13] just good to see everybody again and the
[35:15] new faces that i've not seen
[35:21] i know it's a saturday night
[35:23] someday
[35:24] amen so let's get right into the word
[35:26] tomorrow
[35:27] and how
[35:28] by the grace of god i hope not to keep
[35:30] you alone because we got to come right
[35:32] back on tomorrow morning
[35:39] so we pray to the lord help us
[35:44] amen um
[35:45] i want to go to
[35:46] [Music]
[35:47] colossians chapter 3.
[35:52] thank god for my family
[35:56] of course they're at home in columbia
[35:58] south carolina
[36:01] colombia south carolina for those again
[36:04] that don't know me
[36:06] i have five children
[36:10] my oldest
[36:12] lenny he's
[36:14] 25 now uh vincent coming no and then uh
[36:17] my next to the oldest he'll be 20 on
[36:20] next week
[36:23] 18 year old
[36:36] amen
[36:37] praise the lord
[36:39] okay so colossians chapter 3
[36:42] want to start at verse 16 come on
[36:46] it says let the word of christ dwell in
[36:49] you richly in all wisdom
[36:51] it says teaching and admonishing one
[36:53] another in psalms and hymns and
[36:55] spiritual songs
[36:57] singing with grace in your hearts to the
[36:59] lord amen
[37:14] and i want you to
[37:17] to really focus in on the fact that he
[37:19] says at the end of that
[37:32] he says to the lord
[37:44] all right so we're going to come down
[37:45] the next verse says
[37:48] and whatsoever ye do
[37:50] in word or deed
[37:53] do all
[37:54] in the name of the lord jesus
[37:58] giving thanks to god and the father by
[38:00] him
[38:10] submit yourselves unto your own husbands
[38:13] as it is fit in the lord
[38:16] from
[38:20] so notice he's focusing the attention
[38:23] again
[38:26] on the lord
[38:29] so let what you do
[38:31] let's go to school
[38:33] be as unto the laws
[38:37] because normally when you
[38:38] do or feel like you're doing something
[38:41] as into a man
[38:54] because sometimes we don't hold
[38:57] things in the same regard
[39:12] we'll be more careful in how we speak
[39:14] and what we do
[39:18] isn't that right
[39:21] hey man
[39:23] i feel good right now so just
[39:25] and then bear with me
[39:27] okay so it says in verse 19 husbands
[39:30] love your wives and be not bitter
[39:33] against them
[39:38] children obey your parents in all things
[39:44] how many things
[39:47] all things chosen but notice there is a
[39:50] focus for the children as well
[39:55] because it says here for this is well
[39:58] pleasing unto the lord
[40:02] all right
[40:04] that's very important
[40:06] so
[40:07] sometimes as children you can look at
[40:09] your parents
[40:12] and you can choose to give respect
[40:16] and you can choose not to give respect
[40:20] based off of how you're feeling at that
[40:22] time
[40:25] but when you conduct yourself or deal
[40:27] with your parents as unto the lord
[40:33] then that'll give you that'll cause you
[40:35] to give a more consistent behavior
[40:41] does that make sense
[40:44] all right
[40:45] it comes down and says fathers provoke
[40:47] not your children to anger
[40:49] it says lest they be discouraged
[40:56] servants obey in all things your masters
[41:00] according to the flesh
[41:21] it says and whatsoever ye do you know
[41:25] do it harder
[41:28] as to the lord
[41:31] and not unto me
[41:34] knowing that of the lord ye shall
[41:36] receive the reward of the inheritance
[41:43] it says for ye serve the lord christ
[41:48] but he that do with wrong shall receive
[41:50] for the wrong which he doeth
[41:56] and there is no respect of person
[42:00] amen let us pray once heavenly father
[42:02] please help us
[42:04] lord have your way we ask you
[42:06] jesus christ's name
[42:09] amen amen
[42:10] amen god bless you may be seated
[42:16] thank you
[42:27] all right so
[42:28] for a subject tonight
[42:31] i've emphasized it already in the
[42:33] reading of the word
[42:36] we want to be able to approach the
[42:38] subject of
[42:39] as unto the lord
[42:47] so just from the verses that we've read
[42:49] so far
[42:52] god has a desire
[42:56] and god has a standard
[42:59] he has a standard of conduct
[43:04] that he expects for you and i is
[43:08] to humble ourselves to
[43:34] between the worker and the boss
[43:53] so in the workplace
[43:56] the lord is telling us
[43:58] that we are to obey
[44:01] where to do things
[44:04] with the heart
[44:11] [Music]
[44:15] that determines what kind of a job you
[44:18] do when you go to work
[44:20] i mean
[44:47] you know amongst children that are
[44:48] coming up
[44:51] at very young ages
[44:53] they want to be able to do whatever they
[44:55] want to do
[44:57] you understand they don't want to they
[44:59] they don't want to remain subject
[45:02] to
[45:08] they want to be able to step right into
[45:10] being a full adult
[45:13] director
[45:14] only having to abide by
[45:31] and just live their lives in the way
[45:33] that they see fit
[45:37] but in the sight of god man
[45:40] he know that we're children
[45:42] of something
[45:43] i'm a grown man
[45:58] you may
[46:26] so
[46:44] and it might have a reward that you
[46:46] don't want to receive
[46:49] obviously because god is a good god
[46:53] he's a merciful god
[47:05] so
[47:07] as we go about our lives on a day-to-day
[47:09] basis
[47:12] there's a focus that god wants us to
[47:14] keep yeah um
[47:18] because
[47:19] in life you have trouble
[47:22] in families you have trouble no families
[47:25] in families you have disagreements
[47:29] on that for me parents don't always
[47:30] agree with the children
[47:33] the children always agree with the
[47:35] parents
[47:50] there's something that's that's too
[47:52] commonly neglected
[47:56] and that's it's two things actually is
[47:58] it
[48:00] it's more than that but it is two main
[48:02] things
[48:15] and the reason why i emphasize that is
[48:17] because
[48:18] there is
[48:31] you
[48:32] understand if we're not praying like we
[48:35] need to
[48:37] come
[48:38] and if we're not
[48:39] reading the word of god now when i say
[48:41] reading i'm not talking about like a
[48:43] newspaper
[48:59] who in here would raise their hands and
[49:01] say that they know everything
[49:05] who in here would raise their hands and
[49:07] say that they fully know god in all of
[49:09] god's word
[49:10] [Music]
[49:14] none of us would right
[49:16] there's so much more to god to
[49:18] understand
[49:21] the bible is full of lessons
[49:25] and instructions
[49:27] that still have to be made clear to us
[49:31] and even in the things we've already
[49:33] heard
[49:35] many times people are give a response
[49:39] i already heard that
[49:41] i already know that
[49:56] like we're supposed to have
[49:58] see so that's that's the importance of
[50:00] the baptism of the holy ghost
[50:04] because we can read the word
[50:07] and we can uh intellectually understand
[50:09] the word
[50:23] that's what the pharisees did this is
[50:33] you couldn't put a finger on their lives
[50:35] you couldn't catch them doing nothing
[51:13] [Music]
[51:20] is
[51:30] amen
[51:32] this is something we already know but
[51:33] there is a real
[51:47] paul said that he was looking to
[51:49] apprehend
[51:51] that in which he was apprehended
[51:55] amen
[51:56] no doubt god has his hand in our lives
[52:00] but there is more submission
[52:27] we can't put our own seal of approvals
[52:29] on ourselves
[52:45] the just the real life situations that
[52:47] you and i encountered
[52:52] as being humans
[52:55] right there are tendencies that are
[52:57] within us
[53:12] you have choices you can make
[53:15] on how you would deal with that
[53:16] situation right
[53:18] situation but there is a way
[53:22] that god would have for you to deal with
[53:23] that situation
[53:40] that you feel the treatment
[53:43] based off of your feelings
[53:46] you understand that
[53:47] but see one thing that i realized
[53:51] this spiritual world listen how many
[53:53] realize there are spirits in this
[54:08] but demon powers are here as well
[54:12] and if you can't properly discern the
[54:14] vote
[54:16] that's actually lit talking to you
[54:19] listen
[54:21] i want to try to make this as simple as
[54:23] possible
[54:25] when spirits speak to us
[54:29] because we have spirits
[54:32] it comes as thoughts
[54:35] that's right
[54:49] there was something that spoke to his
[54:50] spirit
[54:55] spirit suggests things all the time
[55:00] spirits want us to gain certain
[55:02] perspectives or view
[55:17] it wants us it wants our minds to
[55:20] actually capture
[55:22] what it is
[55:23] that it's trying to communicate
[55:29] right
[55:30] right so now a spirit will come and
[55:33] it'll speak to our minds
[55:37] and we hear it but it comes to us as a
[55:39] thought
[55:40] and we're not aware we're not aware that
[55:43] it's actually something outside of us
[55:58] in the bible concerning judas
[56:11] now the spirit that made him do it
[56:13] because the bible says satan entered
[56:15] into judas
[56:19] but judas didn't know the devil ended
[56:21] unto him
[56:23] he just found himself having thoughts
[56:28] and he began to move
[56:40] that spirit lifted up off of him
[56:45] left him in his right mind now
[56:49] then he realized
[56:52] i betrayed innocent blood
[56:57] but it was too late
[57:01] you understand
[57:02] that's how spirits operate whenever we
[57:04] sing
[57:06] whenever any one of us sings
[57:09] that's exactly what's happening a spirit
[57:12] comes upon us
[57:14] and in that time
[57:16] we're not thinking we're not able to
[57:18] capture or discern
[57:22] what's actually going on
[57:24] but then but then when we yield
[57:26] ourselves to those thoughts
[57:34] now the thoughts of the devil became
[57:36] words to ease
[57:52] now you see that spirit now coming
[57:54] inside of us
[57:57] she didn't know anything else but
[57:59] righteousness and holiness and the
[58:01] things of god
[58:04] but as soon as she opened up her mind
[58:21] do it
[58:23] it caused her to feel comforted
[58:27] it made her feel like she could go ahead
[58:29] and do it
[58:33] is that simple enough this is a sampler
[58:38] so that's what we deal with and that's
[58:39] what we're dealing with right now in
[58:41] this room
[58:44] it's a spiritual warfare
[58:48] we're not concerned about the devil
[58:52] because he can never overpower god
[58:56] can we say amen today
[59:02] so the devil has desires
[59:06] if somebody do something wrong wrong to
[59:08] you
[59:10] he wants you to do something wrong
[59:13] if somebody hurt you
[59:16] he wants you to have a certain mind
[59:18] toward that person
[59:23] resentment
[59:26] hey man
[59:28] he wants you to act overall he wants you
[59:30] to actually act like that person
[59:35] the bible says answer not a fool
[59:37] according to his father
[59:40] [Music]
[59:42] unless you become like him i'm one
[1:00:37] all right
[1:00:39] everybody understand that
[1:00:42] but that's what it is it's a secret see
[1:00:44] in the world that we're living in
[1:00:48] it's a very cruel world
[1:00:50] but in the midst of a cruel world
[1:00:55] god is still calling for lambs
[1:01:03] that don't respond like the devil wants
[1:01:05] you to respond
[1:01:08] you
[1:01:08] understand so now in the midst of our
[1:01:12] family problems you know and church
[1:01:14] problems and work problems no matter
[1:01:16] what they are coming in
[1:01:22] god wants us to have and keep a certain
[1:01:25] focus
[1:01:28] regardless of how you being treated by
[1:01:30] your boss
[1:01:31] [Music]
[1:01:32] or by your husband
[1:01:34] or by your wife
[1:01:36] or by your
[1:01:50] i want you to speak vocabulary
[1:01:53] heirs unto the lord
[1:01:58] i want you to be examine i want you to
[1:02:00] be an example to them
[1:02:02] example
[1:02:03] of what they should be they're sick
[1:02:07] isn't that right
[1:02:09] we're lights right
[1:02:12] what does that mean we're reflecting his
[1:02:14] life
[1:02:16] isn't that right
[1:02:18] so for the children
[1:02:21] god says be obedient to your parents in
[1:02:24] all things
[1:02:25] [Music]
[1:02:27] as unto the law come
[1:02:31] isn't that right
[1:02:32] because again when you're looking at
[1:02:34] your parents depending on how you're
[1:02:36] feeling
[1:02:39] sometimes
[1:02:40] i was a child once
[1:02:42] you i did things i wasn't supposed to do
[1:02:46] i
[1:02:50] because i was young
[1:02:52] you know i i was one of the ones that
[1:02:54] thought i had it all figured out
[1:02:58] i got to the place
[1:03:00] to where my mom and my grandmother
[1:03:02] couldn't tell me nothing
[1:03:07] but i was wrong
[1:03:09] i was supposed to obey
[1:03:12] you i was supposed to humble myself
[1:03:29] but the grace of god may like you even
[1:03:32] though
[1:03:33] i started off wrong
[1:03:36] by his grace
[1:03:38] he came by my way
[1:03:41] and he brought forth a change in my
[1:03:49] [Music]
[1:03:56] i came up
[1:04:09] there was something that i knew it was
[1:04:11] it something began to affect me
[1:04:15] hey man but something began to penetrate
[1:04:17] that stony heart
[1:04:21] and it wasn't because i was going to a
[1:04:22] church
[1:04:25] it was because it was my time
[1:04:28] you don't have to be in church
[1:04:31] if you're a child you're a god child
[1:04:34] no matter where you are
[1:04:52] he was going to persecute more
[1:04:54] christians
[1:04:56] he was totally against
[1:04:58] the cause of christ
[1:05:01] isn't that right
[1:05:02] but regardless of his present condition
[1:05:06] doesn't mean nothing
[1:05:20] 15 minutes
[1:05:23] but it didn't matter
[1:05:25] now it was his time
[1:05:27] who he really was
[1:05:29] sick was getting ready to come forward
[1:05:33] so that people can now see
[1:05:43] in his life became totally different
[1:05:46] to that
[1:05:47] difference
[1:05:57] i don't know why i'm just kind of
[1:05:59] feeling to stay right here in this
[1:06:00] family area
[1:06:13] and we experience pressures
[1:06:27] how many who who in here don't get
[1:06:29] irritated
[1:06:43] sometimes we get upset sometimes before
[1:06:46] some priest
[1:06:49] and and many times we have responded
[1:06:52] wrong to situations
[1:07:14] amen amen
[1:07:18] in the lord in those times
[1:07:22] because i have grown children myself
[1:07:25] right
[1:07:26] and the lord directed me to these
[1:07:28] scriptures
[1:07:31] because it's something that he wanted me
[1:07:35] to focus on
[1:07:37] [Music]
[1:07:41] regardless of how upset somebody makes
[1:07:43] you important
[1:07:45] regardless of what they do to you seek
[1:07:47] you seek your phone
[1:07:49] from your heart
[1:07:52] god wants you to be able to look at that
[1:07:54] person jesus christ
[1:08:08] let me
[1:08:10] let's go to this scripture here real
[1:08:11] quick i don't know
[1:08:13] receive it
[1:08:15] and
[1:08:19] where are we
[1:08:29] john chapter 13
[1:08:32] and verse 34
[1:08:35] it says a new commandment i give unto
[1:08:37] you
[1:08:39] it says that ye love one another
[1:08:43] he says as i have loved you
[1:08:48] that ye also love one another
[1:09:14] when we've not lived right
[1:09:17] toward him
[1:09:31] how did he handle us or how does he
[1:09:33] handle us right now
[1:09:37] does he throw us away
[1:09:40] does he try to emphasize or
[1:09:43] is he interested in just making us feel
[1:09:45] bad
[1:10:01] isn't that right
[1:10:03] and she was brought forth before jesus
[1:10:08] and they said she was caught in the very
[1:10:09] act according to moses
[1:10:13] she's supposed to be stoned she's
[1:10:14] supposed to be
[1:10:20] and the bible says initially jesus
[1:10:22] continued to ride in the ground as
[1:10:23] though he didn't hear a word
[1:10:28] see at that time within themselves they
[1:10:31] felt like they were okay
[1:10:35] they had wrong in their lives
[1:10:39] but a self-righteous spirit
[1:11:10] because nobody
[1:12:33] [Music]
[1:12:48] you know because he was god right he
[1:12:49] accommodated you
[1:12:51] when he looked over the crowd he saw
[1:12:53] every single one of their lives
[1:12:57] he looked at him and he said let he that
[1:12:59] is without sin
[1:13:02] cast the first
[1:13:14] while he was kneeling down behind his
[1:13:16] back
[1:13:30] the anointing of god was so thick in
[1:13:33] that place
[1:13:35] he wasn't going to let nobody forget
[1:13:38] he made sure everyone in their secret
[1:13:41] sins
[1:13:42] came to mind
[1:13:57] she said they are none
[1:14:16] so he wasn't giving her a ticket to go
[1:14:18] and freely live a life that's not right
[1:14:23] but he did grant her grace
[1:14:27] isn't that right
[1:14:30] so as we're dealing with other people
[1:14:34] he says i want you to love one another
[1:14:37] as i have loved you
[1:14:42] the bible says love
[1:14:44] has oh it covers a multitude of sin
[1:14:49] somebody can actually be doing something
[1:14:51] wrong
[1:14:52] [Music]
[1:14:54] but you don't have to respond to it in
[1:14:57] the way that the devil would have for
[1:14:59] you too
[1:15:07] you can see somebody doing something
[1:15:09] wrong
[1:15:12] and you can see that need that's there
[1:15:14] everywhere
[1:15:16] but then you can go and just pray about
[1:15:18] it
[1:15:21] isn't that right
[1:15:27] see i realized that i realized that in
[1:15:29] my own words
[1:15:32] just get brother brooks as preachers
[1:15:34] just because you preach that's not what
[1:15:36] brings the change
[1:15:55] so now that's helped me because now you
[1:15:58] know when i'm dealing with people and
[1:16:00] what have you i can speak the word of
[1:16:02] god
[1:16:04] and you so
[1:16:18] you're not preaching something one day
[1:16:21] and the next day expecting it to be in
[1:16:22] full fruition
[1:16:24] full material
[1:16:26] no but you understand it's a process it
[1:16:28] has to go through
[1:16:31] and you and you now now you can just
[1:16:32] trust god
[1:16:34] as a parent with the children
[1:16:37] you gotta trust god
[1:16:39] you can't change your children
[1:16:42] if god don't bring the change it ain't
[1:16:44] gonna be no change
[1:17:14] that god is
[1:17:20] amen
[1:17:23] so going back to prayer and reading the
[1:17:29] it word you into a place
[1:17:33] to where spiritually
[1:17:35] spiritual
[1:17:36] you're a little more sensitive
[1:17:40] right
[1:17:42] isn't that right
[1:17:43] how many experienced that before
[1:17:46] when we don't pray
[1:17:48] i'm all over the place right now
[1:17:50] i gave my title but i'm just i'm just
[1:17:52] going according to how god
[1:17:56] when we don't
[1:18:10] spiritually
[1:18:22] so therefore when we're not praying and
[1:18:24] we're not reading like we're supposed to
[1:18:26] lose
[1:18:28] some suppose
[1:18:29] we find ourselves responding wrong
[1:18:34] we're able to fuss now
[1:18:38] we're able to entertain wrong faults
[1:18:43] but but but when those things are are
[1:18:45] being tended to we're yielding ourselves
[1:18:47] to to those things that god gave us to
[1:18:50] do
[1:18:52] [Music]
[1:19:06] humility humility you understand
[1:19:10] so that anointing draws near to you and
[1:19:12] i lost
[1:19:13] you
[1:19:15] so now it's not hard for a child
[1:19:18] you've been praying
[1:19:20] because even though you're a child god
[1:19:22] will give you things to understand
[1:19:24] jesus
[1:19:26] that little bit of effort you can put
[1:19:27] forth
[1:19:30] let's see the lord have blessed you so
[1:19:32] abundantly
[1:19:34] but then when you're under
[1:20:13] when it comes to men's ability
[1:20:17] but how many realize that with god all
[1:20:19] things are possible
[1:20:22] can we say that together
[1:20:24] with god
[1:20:26] all things are possible
[1:20:30] he's not limited to what we're limited
[1:20:32] to
[1:20:36] he called samson to beat down
[1:20:38] hundreds of men at the same time
[1:20:42] picking up gates
[1:20:52] [Music]
[1:20:54] and call somebody to raise from the dead
[1:21:12] in first peter chapter three don't um
[1:21:15] we're talking about as unto the lord now
[1:21:19] it says likewise you wives
[1:21:22] be in subjection to your own husbands
[1:21:25] that if any obey not the word
[1:21:28] it says they also made without the word
[1:21:32] wow
[1:21:39] watch out he says this
[1:21:55] he says be in subjection right
[1:21:58] so of course the husband's it's a little
[1:22:00] different but you understand what i'm
[1:22:01] talking about
[1:22:03] you just be in your place
[1:22:05] right be in subjection to your own
[1:22:07] husbands that if any obey not the word
[1:22:11] they also may without the word be won by
[1:22:14] the conversation of the wise
[1:22:17] men
[1:22:34] so now you become the living word
[1:22:50] to them and god is just saying that you
[1:22:53] submit yourself to me
[1:22:57] and even if your husband ain't right
[1:23:01] don't you deal with him according to his
[1:23:03] present condition
[1:23:30] this is a message called
[1:23:59] there was something in here and let him
[1:24:02] know that was genuine
[1:24:06] no doubt he saw how she conducted
[1:24:08] herself
[1:24:11] as unto the lord
[1:24:15] in the midst of all the trouble
[1:24:19] he was introducing into the family
[1:24:24] he washed the consistency
[1:24:28] of her
[1:24:43] she was experiencing
[1:24:46] being a part of a
[1:24:48] a dysfunctional home
[1:24:52] dysfunctional it's not always easy
[1:24:57] as as children sometimes your parents
[1:24:59] may not be where they need to be
[1:25:05] but god is your spiritual father
[1:25:08] spirituality amen and if you humble
[1:25:10] yourself to him
[1:25:12] and you pray for your family
[1:25:16] just watch god move by his grace
[1:25:21] praise the lord
[1:25:23] so now he picks up this story about this
[1:25:25] man because he has friends now i mean
[1:25:29] and and and they were talking about you
[1:25:32] know uh how how there are no real
[1:25:34] christians out there
[1:25:37] but this husband had an experience so
[1:25:40] maria
[1:25:41] and he had to speak up
[1:25:44] he said well now i don't know what you
[1:25:45] guys experience have been
[1:25:48] he said but i have a wife at home
[1:25:52] and if ain't nobody else a christian
[1:25:55] he says this woman has proven
[1:25:59] to be a true christian
[1:26:03] so i'm gonna pick it up from right there
[1:26:05] because now they want to go home he said
[1:26:06] come to my house maybe not just send me
[1:26:08] vinnie i'm doing amazon they probably
[1:26:10] have been drinking
[1:26:13] but they weren't just
[1:26:15] all out drunk out of their mind oh is it
[1:26:17] the evil on they when they write mine
[1:26:25] [Applause]
[1:26:32] so their condition wasn't as bad as they
[1:26:34] acted as though it was
[1:26:37] once they came into the home
[1:26:39] isn't that right
[1:26:41] so brother branham picks it up here and
[1:26:42] he says
[1:26:43] talking about the husband he says no
[1:26:47] she's still a christian
[1:27:02] up home
[1:27:04] and now
[1:27:05] let's really be drunk
[1:27:08] we're going to act like we're really
[1:27:10] drunk
[1:27:12] knocked at the door
[1:27:15] come in staggering over everything
[1:27:19] he says while the chair is sitting
[1:27:21] around this way
[1:27:24] and everything
[1:27:25] and she set them all in a chair
[1:27:30] and his guests
[1:27:48] [Music]
[1:27:58] that was her husband
[1:28:00] somali she was being subject
[1:28:04] isn't that something
[1:28:07] he has a man didn't deserve it
[1:28:26] so she came and made sure they all was
[1:28:28] able to sit down
[1:28:33] look at the life of christ on display
[1:28:37] amen amen
[1:28:40] it says
[1:28:44] and she went out and fixed them they
[1:28:46] asked for some food
[1:28:49] and she went out and fixed them some
[1:28:51] food
[1:28:52] said we want ham and eggs
[1:28:56] he says he know he know they had it he
[1:28:58] knew it was in the refrigerator he was
[1:28:59] the husband
[1:29:02] he know they had it so they fixed so
[1:29:04] they fixed the ham and eggs
[1:29:06] when he got there to the table
[1:29:10] he looked at them like that looked at
[1:29:11] his friends
[1:29:13] picked up the plate
[1:29:16] and slammed the stuff on the floor
[1:29:19] said you know that you say i don't like
[1:29:22] my eggs like that
[1:29:24] come on boys let's get out of here
[1:29:26] anyway anyhow
[1:29:28] you see he said so they went out
[1:29:31] and sat down like that you know this is
[1:29:33] not sick
[1:29:34] and she come out
[1:29:36] she said dear lady
[1:29:39] she says i'm sorry
[1:29:42] i didn't fix them
[1:29:47] she was apologizing for not doing it in
[1:29:49] a way that he said that he wanted it
[1:29:51] done
[1:29:55] she could have had a much different
[1:29:57] response
[1:30:00] how would we respond
[1:30:04] if somebody just in our face just did
[1:30:07] something like this
[1:30:10] but but see she was under an anointing
[1:30:14] she wasn't just acting like this
[1:30:17] it was something that was coming from
[1:30:19] her soul
[1:30:21] you understand
[1:30:25] why
[1:30:26] while she's doing this she she's not
[1:30:29] fussing in her mind
[1:30:39] [Music]
[1:31:00] but this was coming from this woman's
[1:31:01] heart
[1:31:04] she apologized
[1:31:07] right say what
[1:31:09] she said i didn't get them fixed i'll
[1:31:12] fix some more for you
[1:31:20] you know i didn't want them that way in
[1:31:22] the first place
[1:31:25] just carrying on like that
[1:31:27] they went out there and sat down
[1:31:30] and acted like they was drunk
[1:31:33] they heard her in there kind of snubbing
[1:31:36] to herself
[1:31:39] she was a woman elite farmer she was a
[1:31:42] human
[1:31:45] what her husband was doing
[1:31:48] it hurt her feelings
[1:31:51] right
[1:31:52] but because of what was in the control
[1:31:55] tower
[1:32:09] and the devil wants to come in and take
[1:32:11] advantage of us in those times
[1:32:14] and he wants to try to make us respond
[1:32:16] in certain ways
[1:32:19] but when he's there
[1:32:21] [Music]
[1:32:23] he gathers our thoughts together
[1:32:38] us his thoughts now to come to the
[1:32:40] forefront of our minds
[1:32:43] so she was crying but she was because
[1:32:45] she was hurt
[1:32:48] it was a hard life to live
[1:32:51] right
[1:32:52] but now she's manifesting the very
[1:32:55] scripture we just read
[1:32:57] manifest
[1:32:59] that husband
[1:33:01] and those friends this is i mean we're
[1:33:03] beholding her chaste conversation
[1:33:34] [Music]
[1:33:47] and allowing her actions
[1:33:51] unto the lord
[1:33:55] amen you know god was sitting right
[1:33:57] there
[1:33:59] hey man he was right there watching his
[1:34:01] daughter
[1:34:16] in the midst of
[1:34:30] and i'm gonna go back to a scripture
[1:34:32] real quick
[1:34:34] we opened up with this
[1:34:37] it was in colossians chapter 3 and verse
[1:34:39] 16.
[1:34:43] it says let the word of christ dwell in
[1:34:45] you richly
[1:34:47] in all wisdom
[1:34:49] teaching and admonishing one another in
[1:34:51] psalms and hymns and spiritual songs
[1:34:56] singing with grace in your hearts
[1:35:10] so now she's crying
[1:35:24] and she began to sing listen now this is
[1:35:27] god's way of dealing with these men's
[1:35:29] hearts
[1:35:34] they thought they came to
[1:35:36] pull us put a little trick on her
[1:35:40] but god was actually using that
[1:35:42] situation to pull something on them
[1:35:47] they now were going to become the very
[1:35:49] ones they say didn't exist
[1:36:37] and that little woman
[1:36:39] led her husband a country plus these
[1:36:43] others to christ
[1:36:49] what happened saints
[1:37:19] at any time
[1:37:20] no matter what the situation is
[1:37:25] amen
[1:37:28] but all he needs for us from us
[1:37:32] is humility
[1:37:35] being willing to bring being willing to
[1:37:37] subject ourselves
[1:37:41] to me
[1:37:42] being willing to forfeit our rights
[1:38:12] and i want to leave you with this
[1:38:13] because
[1:38:14] you
[1:39:00] amen amen children on farm
[1:39:06] you don't know how precious it is
[1:39:08] you say
[1:39:10] in the sight of god
[1:39:13] for you to humble yourself
[1:39:16] and be respectful
[1:39:19] and obedient to your parents
[1:39:23] regardless of how you feel or what
[1:39:25] you're going through
[1:39:28] god want you to keep him as the focus
[1:39:32] and let that dictate the response you
[1:39:34] give let's listen
[1:39:38] at
[1:39:45] i know it's difficult sometimes just
[1:39:47] sexy difficult
[1:39:49] you feel like you're being mistreated
[1:40:04] and even though your husband may not be
[1:40:07] all together okay right now
[1:40:11] i need for you to trust in me
[1:40:15] that i'll bring forth the results
[1:40:19] that your heart is
[1:40:34] and allow your
[1:40:49] got the fuss about everything
[1:40:53] something i had to do
[1:40:56] the lord helped me i i rephrased that
[1:40:58] something the lord helped me to do
[1:41:00] yeah this is my idea
[1:41:02] you know children will be children
[1:41:05] they're still growing
[1:41:07] they make mistakes
[1:41:09] they make wrong decisions
[1:41:11] decisions right for those that don't
[1:41:13] have the holy ghost they still need the
[1:41:15] holy ghost
[1:41:36] sometimes how you respond i think how
[1:41:39] strongly you is
[1:41:42] nothing's really accomplished by force
[1:41:58] he was showing me
[1:42:01] there is a much more effective way
[1:42:06] hold back the harsh talk
[1:42:09] um
[1:42:20] you seek my face more
[1:42:23] and in prayer you allow me to sweeten
[1:42:25] your spirit don't
[1:42:32] because what i'm saying in what i'm
[1:42:34] saying i'm not saying that god won't
[1:42:37] chase in that child
[1:42:38] sometimes through stern words and things
[1:42:40] of that nature
[1:42:46] but as long as it's god
[1:42:50] then it's right
[1:42:52] you understand
[1:42:54] as long as it's god this is right but if
[1:42:57] it's us in a wrong spirit
[1:43:00] correcting our children in the wrong
[1:43:02] spirit
[1:43:05] you're not accomplishing anything anyway
[1:43:08] since the lord brought that to my mind
[1:43:10] and i began to submit myself to that i
[1:43:12] had a desire to say lord show me what's
[1:43:14] going on
[1:43:16] because we always want the relationships
[1:43:18] and things to be improved
[1:43:23] meow and you want to see where the enemy
[1:43:25] is working
[1:43:27] not just in everybody else
[1:43:31] but lord of he's working through me
[1:43:34] i i didn't want to be like the mob that
[1:43:37] was bringing the woman caught into the
[1:43:39] act of adultery
[1:43:44] at that moment in my own mind you know
[1:43:46] appear to be righteous
[1:44:18] isn't that something
[1:44:22] that's why i begin to want and desire to
[1:44:24] deal with situations more in love
[1:44:32] more in the spirit i wanted i wanted to
[1:44:33] be more careful
[1:44:35] that it was more of the spirit of god
[1:44:38] and not just me
[1:44:40] allowing the devil to come in
[1:44:44] and in a wrong spirit
[1:44:58] there's been a change
[1:45:14] but it was because god was able to help
[1:45:16] me to see me
[1:45:20] and by his grace
[1:45:22] give me grace
[1:45:24] to be able to handle the situations in
[1:45:27] the way that he wanted me to
[1:45:42] so god is concerned about the whole
[1:45:43] family
[1:45:46] he gives us what we need
[1:45:50] to be able to become better
[1:45:53] make our homes better
[1:46:02] you know our service to the you know not
[1:46:04] to the church per se because the church
[1:46:05] is the people but it's about just the
[1:46:07] order that god has set up
[1:46:10] the public
[1:46:25] for a conduct from the congregation to
[1:46:27] the pastor
[1:46:30] and from the past to the congregation
[1:46:33] there is a way in which god desires for
[1:46:35] each party to handle one another
[1:46:42] as a pastor to be able to see that you
[1:46:44] are the very wife of god
[1:46:49] you can't be handled in any kind of a
[1:46:51] way
[1:46:56] just to get up here because i'm in the
[1:46:58] role of a pastor or a leader just be
[1:47:01] real harsh and whatever in a wrong
[1:47:03] spirit
[1:47:06] those things
[1:47:18] you might get a temporary conformity
[1:47:34] lasting
[1:47:46] for giving us the instructions that we
[1:47:48] need when we need
[1:48:02] doing
[1:48:05] you know you got so many people that
[1:48:08] have been affected by police brutality
[1:48:13] until
[1:48:14] people's mindsets just cascaded they
[1:48:18] don't want to respect the police
[1:48:19] officers
[1:48:23] but how many realize that god asks for
[1:48:25] us to be subject
[1:48:27] to juventus
[1:48:29] isn't that right
[1:48:31] so regardless of how many are maybe
[1:48:33] conducting themselves in the wrong way
[1:48:39] god don't give nobody a green light
[1:48:42] a person
[1:48:44] to give to to in return have a
[1:48:47] rebellious mindset
[1:48:51] to where you disrespect and mishandle
[1:48:56] the law of the land
[1:49:12] but i'm looking
[1:49:25] that's why he said when you're at your
[1:49:26] jobs do a good job
[1:49:29] not as men
[1:49:33] when the ball staying around doing what
[1:49:34] you want to do
[1:49:38] and then when the balls come around
[1:49:39] tighten up
[1:49:54] and that one thing is
[1:49:55] you could take that across the board
[1:49:59] don't don't come to church and just have
[1:50:01] eye service
[1:50:04] hey man this is your come to church one
[1:50:06] way and go home and be another one
[1:50:21] and that's what he's here to do and
[1:50:22] that's what he's doing right now
[1:50:25] we're not the same people
[1:50:28] can we say amen today
[1:50:30] we're not the same people
[1:50:33] god has he's changed us and the work is
[1:50:35] still in progress he's getting ready to
[1:50:37] cap us off
[1:50:41] i don't know about you i'm ready to go
[1:50:42] home
[1:50:44] i'm not comfortable here
[1:50:47] i'm very uncomfortable
[1:50:50] this
[1:50:56] let us all stand again
[1:50:59] amen
[1:51:01] [Applause]
[1:51:09] i had many other thoughts on my heart
[1:51:13] but as i saw things began to go in a
[1:51:15] certain direction i just wanted to yield
[1:51:17] to that
[1:51:43] lord is a very important
[1:51:47] [Music]
[1:51:59] it's important to you lord
[1:52:04] that we be able to deal with people
[1:52:05] right
[1:52:07] [Music]
[1:52:12] you've given us grace father god to
[1:52:15] to come out of the lives that we were
[1:52:18] drowned in lord
[1:52:22] you've been revealing yourself to us
[1:52:24] along the way
[1:52:28] but the work is not finished as of yet
[1:52:32] there's still more lord god for us to
[1:52:34] enter into yeah
[1:52:37] there's still more of your life
[1:52:40] to be received
[1:52:41] [Music]
[1:52:42] even though we may have received an
[1:52:44] initial baptism of the holy ghost
[1:52:48] there's more of you to receive lord
[1:52:51] [Music]
[1:52:53] so that father your life
[1:52:56] can
[1:53:00] we each are very mindful of the rough
[1:53:02] areas of our lives
[1:53:08] the doors that we have not allowed to be
[1:53:10] fully open
[1:53:12] [Music]
[1:53:14] that you want to come in and have
[1:53:16] fellowship with us in those particular
[1:53:18] areas of our lives
[1:53:21] [Music]
[1:53:23] those lingering things father god
[1:53:28] you desire to come and have fellowship
[1:53:30] with us in those areas
[1:53:35] and god we just pray that you would help
[1:53:37] us lord to humble ourselves to you
[1:53:40] [Music]
[1:53:45] but to allow you to come and just have
[1:53:47] your free course throughout our lives
[1:53:51] [Music]
[1:53:54] pray for the families of this church
[1:53:56] [Music]
[1:53:58] we pray for the church family here
[1:54:00] father god
[1:54:03] and not only here lord but just wherever
[1:54:06] your bride is gathered
[1:54:07] [Music]
[1:54:09] because the same
[1:54:11] pattern of problems and issues exists
[1:54:14] everywhere
[1:54:17] but you're calling for something
[1:54:19] [Music]
[1:54:21] you're lord for us to have and maintain
[1:54:24] that focus
[1:54:26] so that when we're dealing with the
[1:54:28] different situations lord we're dealing
[1:54:30] with it lord as unto you
[1:54:34] we're not allowing the enemy to come in
[1:54:36] lord god
[1:54:37] calls our conduct and our thoughts
[1:54:43] to go in the direction that he would
[1:54:45] have for them to go lower
[1:54:48] [Music]
[1:55:02] so there will be more of you on display
[1:55:06] by your grace
[1:55:09] help us all we pray father
[1:55:12] we commit our lives to your lord
[1:55:16] help us to have a rededication of our
[1:55:18] lives
[1:55:21] and no father god in life
[1:55:24] sometimes lord sometimes we get weary
[1:55:28] the fun of some
[1:55:29] fabulous sometimes it becomes difficult
[1:55:31] [Music]
[1:55:34] the pressures of life in the different
[1:55:36] situations of life
[1:55:38] [Music]
[1:55:40] and in those times the enemy comes
[1:55:44] and he tries to cause us to break to
[1:55:46] give in
[1:55:47] [Music]
[1:55:49] even our prophet went through that lord
[1:55:51] [Music]
[1:55:53] the hardest moments of his life
[1:55:57] the enemy came in and tried to convince
[1:56:03] [Music]
[1:56:11] if it wasn't for the spirit your spirit
[1:56:14] that you that you allowed to come inside
[1:56:16] of his life
[1:56:18] [Music]
[1:56:20] that you begin to speak from at that
[1:56:22] time at that vulnerable moment
[1:56:26] he said had
[1:56:29] [Music]
[1:56:36] but you reminded him lord that he wasn't
[1:56:38] nobody in him
[1:56:48] [Music]
[1:56:54] he came to the conclusion lord that you
[1:56:56] give
[1:56:59] and you take away
[1:57:02] and he began to bless your name
[1:57:04] [Music]
[1:57:05] but it was because of that present power
[1:57:07] in his souls
[1:57:13] [Music]
[1:57:22] of your spirit
[1:57:25] be granted to every heart that's in here
[1:57:27] tonight
[1:57:29] we needed heavenly father
[1:57:31] that's the only way lord we can truly
[1:57:34] humble ourselves to your words
[1:57:42] [Music]
[1:57:49] we ask this father
[1:57:52] [Music]
[1:58:02] [Applause]
[1:58:02] [Music]
[1:58:05] raise them
[1:58:20] brother dennis uh
[1:58:23] [Music]
[1:58:24] perhaps didn't know why he couldn't stay
[1:58:26] with his notes
[1:58:30] it's because god was in this place
[1:58:34] and i can truly say that brother dennis
[1:58:36] and i have not talked other than coming
[1:58:38] home from the airport today
[1:58:42] i i'm i stand amazed
[1:58:46] from
[1:58:47] the beginning to the end
[1:58:49] i know god was speaking
[1:58:52] not only to others but to me personally
[1:58:55] situations that i
[1:58:57] needed to know how to do and how to
[1:58:59] handle
[1:59:00] and i can't say that i was doing
[1:59:02] everything as untold
[1:59:05] but as
[1:59:06] the word of god has come
[1:59:09] you repent
[1:59:11] and you ask god to forgive you of your
[1:59:13] sins
[1:59:14] and help you to allow the word of god to
[1:59:17] live and i i like it when he brought it
[1:59:20] out that just at the very end
[1:59:22] the word was made flesh
[1:59:25] that's what i desire in my life
[1:59:28] more than anything
[1:59:30] is for god to be seen through this
[1:59:32] earthly vessel
[1:59:34] and uh so i know the word which has
[1:59:36] spoken to hearts tonight
[1:59:38] [Music]
[1:59:40] especially when i love that word
[1:59:42] humility because all of us can use more
[1:59:45] of it
[1:59:47] and you know that's the way god is
[1:59:50] and i want to i want to say
[1:59:52] i don't know what i told you not i won't
[1:59:54] be here in the morning
[1:59:56] but i want y'all to treat brother uh
[1:59:58] [Music]
[1:59:59] as unto the lord
[2:00:01] [Music]
[2:00:03] i've got to go down to iowa city
[2:00:05] tomorrow
[2:00:06] but by the grace of god i love the lord
[2:00:08] and i just there's no words to express
[2:00:11] and i don't want to take away the sweet
[2:00:12] anointing
[2:00:14] there is no words to express
[2:00:16] what all god covered
[2:00:18] i just wish there were some others who
[2:00:21] i wish they were here
[2:00:23] because i'm going to tell you something
[2:00:24] that we can't learn
[2:00:26] i said like brother brad i'm saying this
[2:00:28] he says no grace
[2:00:30] no love
[2:00:31] no love
[2:00:32] no grace
[2:00:34] and if we can't allow ourselves to
[2:00:36] extend grace to each other
[2:00:38] then that shows we don't have the love
[2:00:40] that we should have
[2:00:42] toward each other so i appreciate the
[2:00:44] lord and
[2:00:46] wow what a beautiful beautiful beautiful
[2:00:48] service
[2:00:49] it was a masterpiece
[2:00:51] and i will go back and listen to it
[2:00:53] again
[2:00:54] amen i'm gonna ask our songwriters to
[2:00:56] come
[2:00:57] i don't know whether it's somebody that
[2:00:59] desired prayer if you need prayer i know
[2:01:00] the time has been well spent but it's
[2:01:02] been good
[2:01:03] my heart i don't know how you feel but
[2:01:05] my heart there's a little butterfly type
[2:01:08] thing going on in my heart now because
[2:01:10] the lord spoke directly to me
[2:01:13] i love it when it comes this way that's
[2:01:15] why
[2:01:15] i believe that this is the throne of god
[2:01:18] brother branham call it the judgment
[2:01:20] seat
[2:01:21] is where god comes and began to speak to
[2:01:23] us
[2:01:24] and every time you come to church you're
[2:01:26] supposed to take the word of god
[2:01:28] personally
[2:01:29] not look at someone else and what
[2:01:31] they're going through but
[2:01:33] what
[2:01:34] he said he said it was ending there
[2:01:37] the way he handled things even with his
[2:01:40] own children
[2:01:42] he wants to learn how
[2:01:44] you want god to
[2:01:46] get him out of the way and put god in
[2:01:48] there
[2:01:48] that's basically what i what i perceived
[2:01:58] [Music]
[2:03:01] so
[2:03:08] [Music]
[2:03:14] jesus
[2:03:23] [Music]
