Jesus Jesus is the god [Music] [Applause] serve amen amen we greet you on the name of Lord Jesus we're so happy to see everybody let me start my timer before okay I only have 20 minutes you pray for me all right let's go straight to the word open the Bible in the book of Second Kings we'll read the ver uh chapter uh chapter 13 we read the verse 14 uh Second Kings 13 14- 17 amen amen uh this is U it's a subject that you know I was working on a couple hours I'll try my by my Best by the grace of God Amen let's uh let's let's read verse now Elisha was Fallen sick of his sickness whereof he died and joash the king of Israel came down unto him and wept over his face and said oh my father my father The Chariot of Israel and the horsemen thereof and Elisha said unto him take B uh take bow and arrows and he took unto him born arrows and he said unto the he said he said to the king he said to the king of Israel put thine hand upon the bow and he puts his hand upon upon it and Elisha put his hands upon the king man and he said open the window Eastward and he opened it then elishah said shoot and you shot and he said the eror of the Lord's deliverance and the error of deliverance from Syria for Thou shalt Smite the the Syrian in AEK till thou has consumed them amen let's bow our heads father God we humbly come before your throne of grace just to say thank you Father Lord thank you for this new year that you're about to give us Lord and thank you for all the blessings that you given us now I pray that you help me to be so sensitive to the Holy Spirit Lord so I can only say what you want me to say bless their hearts that will hear the word in Jesus Christ name we pray amen you may be see that amen so I have a very small subject that uh we entitled the scant fa the scant faith of Jo joash SC that's uh means you know barely sufficient something that not enough amen the SK faith of of joash as we read here you'll see that Elisha was at you know Elisha wanted I mean was about to die and Syria was attacking the children of Israel so joash knew one thing that as long as they had the prophet in the land amen the victory was guaranteed so now we heard that elishah was sick so he went to Elijah amen started crying crying and then Elisha gave him this word he said that take the bow and the arrows and open the window Eastward and I want you to shoot that that arrow and he did exactly that so here we see that the arrow represent Victory represent amen an arrow represent Victory FL represent so uh uh Syria was attacking the children of Israel and no way by themselves they could have won that battle so they needed the hand of the Lord so he went to the prophet amen as we all know that the prophet is a mouth of God Amen the prophet gave him the word he gave him the word sh that arrow and he shooting the arrow you will have it's the arrow of the of Deliverance of Amen it sh the area of deliverance from from Syria amen that will be your Victory amen and he did exactly that so when if we go down to the verse 16 18 amen Verse 18 the Bible says that and he said take the arrows and he took them amen and he said he said unto the king of Israel Smite upon the ground and he smed Thrice and stayed amen and at verse 19 the Bible said that and the man of God was rough with him and said thou should us have smitten five or six times then H has thou smitten Syria till thou has uh consumed it whereas now thou shall Smite Syria by th amen so I want us to focus on Verse 18 here for a bit amen Elijah told uh uh joash to take the arrows amen notice that the arrows is the victory represent the victory so Elisha told him he said that go take the go take the arrows amen which means that he had plenty of arrows next am man Elisha did not specify how many arrows he had to take amen by by joash by the lack of faith amen he only took three so elishah was frustrated Amen in other words I'm giving you the opportunity to have as many victories as you want amen but you only choose three victories amen I'm giving you the opportunity to have as many victories as you want but you only choose three amen the the arrows as I said represent the the the victories FL represent thect amen and the Elisha when Elisha pointed out to joah she had many of Amen if we can't bring it to our time now amen arrows we can take it as me make it represent promises amen and all the promises we sing it that every promise in the book is mine amen so the victories of your life amen depends on how many promises you choose to take amen the Bible has plenty of promises amen from Genesis to Revelation amen you'll see promises after promises amen but your Victory amen it depends on which promise you want to take amen if you're sick amen there's a promise about healing amen he says that I am your healer that's a good thing with God Amen he's not only our doctor amen but he's also our healer amen because the doctor cannot always heal amen the doctor can tell you what's wrong amen but when you go to a Healer amen that's guaranteed amen that's healing 100% amen amen if you need something amen he's our Jehovah Gyra amen so the victories of your life amen depends on how many Arrow you choose to take amen but I don't know about you tonight amen I'm about to take all the arrows that's available amen I'm not only taking three amen I'm not only taking four amen but I'm taking as many as I can Amen to last for my entire life because we know that the life of a Christian amen is filled of B is full of battles amen every day we have to fight de demons amen every day we have to go through trials amen so you need to have your backpack ready amen with all the promises of God Amen the prophet here says he says that brother when you got that baptism of the Holy Ghost it takes that old temper out of you it puts you it puts you on the dress and makes you like it makes you act like a lady amen it'll make you quit smoking it'll make you quit drinking it'll make you quit lying it make quit stealing amen and everything else brother when you've got the baptism of the Holy Ghost it separates you amen it delivers you from the things of the world Amen he makes you love God Amen he makes you go to church amen he makes you worship himen it makes you tell your neighbor about it he makes you above sin that's that's a gift of the holy spirit amen because the Holy Spirit has benefit amen look at Moses amen when he went to uh uh uh the burning bush the burning bush had some benefits with Moses was scared amen he was afraid of his he was afraid he was going to die but when went to the burning he had a promise amen that God will always be with him that God will always be with him and he left that place being a changed man man with confidence amen you see the disciples 120 up in the upper room they went to that room when they went to that room they were all scared amen Peter was afraid to go out John was afraid all of them they were afraid of the Romans but when the Holy Spirit came he brought the benefits of the Holy Spirit he gave them the confidence amen they started telling that to their neighbors that changed their Liv amen that's the benefit of the holy spirit amen and they did not structure they did not stru short of that of that promise they took it all they took all the benefits and the promise it was given to us that promise of the holy spirit amen is for you for your children and for your children even now you still can go and CLA even now you still can go and get that victory amen God is asking you to do one thing only one thing take the arrows and smite amen he says take the arrows he didn't say how many arrows he didn't tell you what to Smite notice that when Elisha told joash to Smite to take the arand and smart Elisha didn't give a specific uh uh Target amen he just says smart It On The Ground whatever it it's on the ground you'll have the victory amen and with the word of God we supposed to rise above all am so whatever it is on the ground amen you have the victory amen if you want your plans to succeed you AR of Proverbs amen the Bible said that commit the Lord what whatever you do and He will establish you amen if you need something amen the Bible says in Matthew 7 ask and it shall be given to you seek and you shall find knock and it shall be open you for everyone that ask receiveth he that seeketh find and to him that knock it shall be open if you have a prayer request Psalm 6 verse the Lord has heard my supplication the Bible will not did not say that the Lord will hear saying the Lord has heard as if it was already in the past because the Bible tells us amen that before you even open your mouth has heard your pray your heart that's why David said that the Lord has heard my and the Lord will receive my prayer you you have a test St you need wisdom you have J one chapter verse if any of you lacks wisdom you should ask God who gives generously to all without fault and he will be given he will will be given to him amen so there are many more promises in this book many more of these arrows Amen in this book amen it depends on which one you're choosing amen but I made my decision I'm going to take all of them and apply it to every one of I'm going to take every one of them and apply it to every one of my problems and I know God will never fail because this word has been tested so many times and it's proven be to be right so I'm taking it all I'm taking it all Amen in closing amen you can turn to your neighbor amen and repeat the the words of those songs with me tell him that every promise in the book is mine amen every chapter every verse amen every line amen all our blessings of love and every promise of the book so believe in the word of what you say Amen because it's what you profess that's what will happen if you said every promise in the book ISS every promise in the book is yours be happy amen stop complaining stop thinking about tomorrow promise and walk with it every day of your life and God will bless you amen amen wow I have two 2 minutes and 30 seconds left amen God bless you we'll call Brother Sam amen amen amen looks it looks like I have 20 minutes 2 minut I'mma use my brother's minute amen how many are looking forward to crossing over into 2024 turn around to your neighbor and say are you ready amen amen don't get left behind in 2023 what everyone else is crossing over let us stand up upon our feet as we read uh the word of the Lord um you can follow along let us open to Genesis uh 18:14 the Lord was speaking to Abraham and Sarah and said is anything too hard for the Lord you can take your seats is anything too hard for the Lord God is the only one who asks you a question not because he does not know the answer but he asks you a question trying to tell you something when he asked Abraham and Sarah is anything too hard for the lord it's not because God did not know but he was trying to tell Abraham something that I am able to do it hallelujah hallelujah that question had a suggested answer so I have a question for you this morning is is anything too hard for the Lord oh I didn't get enough ANW anything too hard for the Lord hallelujah hallelujah I can even finish preaching on that because we know our Lord is more than able do what he said he will do in his word hallelujah hallelujah and the Bible says at the time appointed I will return unto thee according to the time of life and Sarah shall have a son I'm speaking on the time appointed hallelujah hallelujah Sarah was Barren sah medically it was impossible for her to Bear children and it was impossible but God said is there anything too hard for me hallelujah hallelujah and you as the Seed of Abraham God is asking you the same thing is anything too hard for the Lord at the time appointed not appointed by man but appointed by God himself he says I will come back and I will give you my promise so like our brother was preaching all those promises in the Bible they are not too hard for the Lord at the appointed time he will come and he will give you those bless Hallelujah we all know Sarah was Barren for 25 years doctor say you cannot bear children after that age but God as he promised he came at the time appointed turned it around it was the Paradox something that's unheard of Hallelujah he Miracle working God if he did it for Sarah he can do it for you at the time appointed God will come for your resue Hallelujah in John chapter 5 and verse 6 you can put it on the projector Jesus was walking and he was passing by the pool of Bethesda and there was a lame man who had been lame for 38 years he was lame for 38 years and Jesus and Jesus came to him he was not the worst case situation but Grace located him hallelujah how many can say I'm not the worst God predestinated me the Bible said when Jesus saw him lie and knew that he had been now in a long time in that case he said unto him will thou be made whole Jesus is asking him a question he is not asking because he does not know it's not because Jesus was not sure if the could walk but he was trying to tell him something he was giving him an answer that there is a possibility that you can be made whole all you have to do is rise up and walk it was his appointed time other people were waiting for the angel to come cuz that that's the time everyone was expecting but his time appointed came by the master himself Hallelujah Hallelujah Jesus Christ was the promises walking in flesh amen he know this was Jehovah Rafa God who Health all my diseases as soon as he walked on the scene he just had to rise up and walk I can tell you can do the same thing this morning you can rise up and walk it is your appointed time why because Jesus is here the word of God tells wherever two or three are gaed he will be there so I can guarantee you and tell you for sure that in this meeting Jesus is here and right now that's your appointed time rise up and walk hallelujah hallelujah that's all you got to do there anything too hard for the Lord amen amen when God asks you a question it's not because he does not know he's trying to tell you something he's trying to tell you you can come out of that predicament you can come out of that addiction you can come out of that disease you just have to rise up and walk hallelujah hallelujah we know in the Book of Ezekiel God came to Ezekiel and he says son of man can these Dry Bones live it's not because it's not because God was not sure if those Dry Bones could live he had the answer but he was trying to tell Ezekiel something just speak the word hallelujah hallelujah and when Ezekiel got up he spoke the word and those bones one arm was over there the leg was over there but because he answered the question God had asked him those bones got together and there was revived a mighty [Music] Army because he was answering God's question at the appointed time and there was a mighty Army that rose up for the Living God tonight I'm looking at the army of the Living God hallelujah God does not do things H hazard he he has his own timing everything is on time it might not be on your time but it is it is on his time because his timing is perfect hallelujah hallelujah Mary and Martha they wanted Jesus to come early but he says no he was waiting at for the appointed time because if he had come on their time they were just going to get a healing testimony but Jesus wanted a resurrection testimony when he comes he has better results say Lord I know your timing might not be good to me but I know it's good for me hallelujah hallelujah he came four days is late and he says Lazarus come forth it does not matter where Lazarus was he had to come back why because he heard the voice of the master hallelujah hallelujah 4 days late on our time but at the time appointed by God he was right on time hallelujah hallelujah huj I'll go to Hab habac 2:3 says for the vision is yet for an appointed time but at the end it shall speak and not lie though it t wait for it because it surely come it will not t this baffled me for a moment the Bible is saying it will T but it will not t it will t on your timing but on God's timing it will not t hallelujah hallelujah that's why we got to trust God's timing CU at the appointed time he will not delay he will come exactly when you need him so of all his promises all the promises in the book they're coming to me right on time hallelujah hallelujah and the prophet of God tells us that the Seed of Abraham walks the exact same Christian Journey as Abraham so if God asked Abraham a question trying to tell him something you the same question as well trying to tell you something that at the appointed time there is nothing too hard for me and he gave Father Abraham a promise that your children will be in bondage for 400 years hallelujah hallelujah and when the 400 years were up that was the time appointed amen it was time for deliverance nothing could stop them from coming out at the time Pharaoh was the superpower of the whole world but Pharaoh could not stop the plan of God when God promises he has to come through so you got to take your Bible look at all the promises and say Lord I'm calling you on your promises because you are a covenant keeping God hallelujah Pharaoh tried to stop them he changed his mind multiple times but that could not stop them the Red Sea was right in front of them but that could not stop theman and Kora were they doubting but that could not stop them amen do we have any children of Abraham this morning Hallelujah I have a word of you for you this morning nothing can stop you there is not enough demons in hell to stop when God's timing when God's timing for your life is come has to happen there is power in the time appointed God himself is doing it hallelujah hallelujah no force can stop it even yourself you cannot stop it because when God is determined to do it he will do it for you hallelujah hallelujah when your promotion is supposed to come not even your boss can stop it because God's timing no one can stop it that you've been fighting no enemy can defeat you why because God's timing is perfect that breakthrough you've been wanting know that there is no Devils enough to stop it Hallelujah though it might T it will not t why because it's on God's timing hallelujah hallelujah just turn around one more time to your neighbor say is there anything too hard for the Lord as we are Crossing into 2024 I'm here to tell you at the appointed time God is coming through for you you can say 2023 I've been fighting this disease but there's not enough medical disease that can stop God you can say I've been wanting for this to happen but I'll tell you this morning this is an appointed time because you are in the presence of the almighty God amen amen let's stand up on our feet my time is [Applause] up may God bless you I think my mic is maybe not working can you guys hear me may God richly bless you we GRE you all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and we thank the Lord for the opportunity he gives us he gives to us and I thank the Lord word for the servants who spoke they were powerful messages and I thank the Lord for having them with me so God richly bless you as we are stand we were standing we're going to open our Bible in the book of Philippians the first chapter verse six if I'm not mistaken phili somebody already on on the verse okay pH chapter Philippians chapter 1 verse 6 says being confident of this very thing that he which has begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ amen uh I have a little issue it issue with my computer we we stopped the time the time should be working right now I have it on my phone that someone can give you my phone okay so during this time let's say a word of prayer our heavenly father we want to thank you for the time you give you grant to us we want to bring your word we want to submit all Spirits in this under your spirit so Lord we we think that you already you are here before us sermons of the preachers that preach before me I believe that you're going to do things in the name of Jesus Christ Our God amen amen so with the scripture that we just read phili Philippians chapter first chapter it was the six verse six okay the Lord didn't want me to preach with my laptop now if you noticed here with the scripture that we just read I just want you to notice something that the Bible says it's Paul that say he says that I'm confident that he which has begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ and so I was very happy when I could already read Paul saying that I'm persuaded that the one who started the good work I want to get your attention here that the work that it's about is not an evil he said that I'm confident that he which has begun the good work in you will perform it I want to remind you this morning every one of you this morning that you're not the work of the work of God himself when God starts something what God starts is always good God cannot start something bad that's why Paul said confident started the good work in you he will perform it this morning this night I want to remind you that because you are the work of God cannot start something stop it Midway he will try to make you perfect my yes my brothers I can remember in the beginning in the Book of Genesis when God was created the Bible says that in the beginning God created the Heaven and the earth and the Bible says that the Earth was without form the Earth did not have a form God gave a form to the Earth because what God he will make it perfect if you are the work of God God will certainly make you perfect there's nothing that can stop God the Bible says even unbelief never stop God that's why this morning I want to tell somebody because God started God will perform it yes my the Earth was without a form it didn't have a form God gave a form to the Earth if you go back in the Book of Genesis you can see verse four of chapter one God start to create give a form to the Earth so God starts little by little I want you to notice the first thing that God cre was the God say let the light be and when the light appeared God separated the lights from the darkness I want you to pay attention God created first separated God starts something he starts a work he the one that's going to make that that work perfect verse five he says it says and God called and the Darkness he called night evening and the morning were the first day it was the first day and God said let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters and that let it divide let that firmament separat there's the creation of something and then there's a separation and God called that there was a day there was night said let the waters that's in heaven gather together and that the dry land and that was that and God called the dry land Earth and he called the the the gathering together and God saw that it was good and God started that the Earth produced fruits and you understood that there was a process before the Earth was without a form and God had the ability to say that the Earth everything that that that is on Earth today but God did not do so he starts he starts by giving a form to Earth little by little I don't know if you understand yes mys that's why the Prophet tell that that that the Bible says the God created the Earth in six days and I told you that God in his in his God in his in his quality of being God he could have just said let the Earth let the heaven let this be all should have just happened just right there but God did not do it he started doing it little by little why I want to tell someone this morning tonight that because you are a work of God God will perform you little by little because it said first that the one who started this good work the work is not a bad it's a good work because the one who started is the good god yes my brothers the work is good I want to say something here that's why today God cannot give you everything at at once he gives it to you little by little God says money of the world today it's going to be happy on you I'm going to give it to you little by little yes my brothers that's why God says the Bible says for your fa your Fai Temperance temp patience God is able to give you all those at once but he says I cannot do it at once that's why he says he says I'm going to work on your I'm going to remove your life tomorrow I come I'm going to work on your then he REM then tomor and he says I'm going to remove your God has the ability those things at once but he perfects you little by little little by little that today it's this tomorrow he removes another thing so the problem is don't condemn me remember that I'm the work of God and because I'm the work of God the Bible has already said that the work is good it's to God to make me perfect I just commit myself into his it's to him to make me perfect I remember there was a day a French Emperor his name was Char he had to Feast with his generals one he had to peace with all the mil all his all his army and they were all there as they were there standing as they were singing their national anthem the crown of the king fell and everyone was all the soldiers were they standing and it fell because of of the wind but because the soldiers were standing like this no one could move but there was just one of the soldiers who stood up and who went to grab the crown of the back on the on the head of the king and the emperor said he said thank you my general he knew that he was he says thank you and the general said thank you that he left that place never left the place his his he W he set where the generals were standing now the generals who are standing by him they said but your office you should have you should have gone back to your captain then he told him it's not you that makes me a general the Emperor who said I am a general and then he stood there another person told him so if you're a general then where all your your your your your B your bad your um your badges then he told him he told him listen the badges is not a problem the king said I'm a general the badges will come later tell someone this morning no matter where you are no matter where your is no matter the situation trust God because the one who's going to make you perfect no matter what you are yes my brothers I want to tell someone this morning that God needs someone he can trust someone who can command himself totally to God to become a prisoner that's why I want to say God wants us to be prisoners prisoners of the word prisoners of Christ prisoners of this message I don't want my brothers that we be prisoners of people I'm not going to be a prisoner of somebody I want you tonight not be prisoner of somebody else if you can be a prisoner be a prisoner of the word so I want in 2024 that you just become a prisoner of the word I'm going to read the prophets and we're going to finish don't look at your mistakes don't look at your mistakes God will perfect you little by little remember when they called the adulterous woman and all the accusers were there brought that woman to Jesus and they told her master we caught her she was committing adultery and they had stones with them to Stone that woman but the Lord just and he started writing on the Lord started writing with his finger he was just writing with his finger brother says the people who they were accusing this woman everyone came to see what what was being written floor but what happened while everyone was looking at what was being written on the floor he was riding the life of everyone that Wasing there that's why when they work they got there they started looking at what was everyone was looking at his life they said no I can't Stone this woman and then the other one came he saw that the master was writing his own sin say oh no this woman is innocent because you know they were they were themselves un because when they catch a woman in with a man that she's committing adultery with but they did not catch the man they were unjust and the Lord saw gave them the seed that they saw themselves I'm going to finish I'm just taking the little minutes that they left for me so as they saw this everyone left and now the Lord stood up and he said woman where your

can't even faom what eternity is going to be like all we've ever known is suffering and pain and trials T but we have been promised to a a land where we'll never grow old Hallelujah and I know my scripture reading is going to uh sound a little odd from where I'm where I'm going to be preaching so you won't have the pressure I don't I'm not I'm not limited to 20 minutes I'm the only preacher but but our our our preachers our pastor and different ones they've done a great job tonight let's give round of appuse Hallelujah Isaiah 21 1-6 I thank the Lord for my wife who have stood with me and by me throughout all these years and was amazing how this young lady that lives across the street from us as far as we know she's not a Christian but my wife was led to ask her if she wanted us to pray for her because the the situation was really bad Hallelujah and we went over there and we prayed for uh at the moment we prayed for her she started crying she said she felt something and I believe what she felt was her healing we explained to her the way brother brandom said healings are she was faithful to the faith and God gave her healing healed her of those tumors on her brain my God is God and he's the same yesterday today and forever amen Isaiah 21 1-6 the burden of the desert of the sea as whirlwinds in the South pass through so it Cometh From The Desert from a ter [Music] Grievious vision is declared unto me the treacherous dealer dealth treacherously and the spoiler spoth go up o Elum besiege oh media all the sign thereof have I made to [Music] cease therefore are my Longs filled with pain pains have taken a hold upon me as the Pains of a woman that travaileth I was bowed down at the hearing of it I was dis amazed at the hearing at the seeing of it my heart heart panted fear fearfulness afed me the night of my pleasure hath he turned into fear unto me prepare the table watch in the Watchtower eat drink arise ye princes and anoint The Shield for thus have the Lord said unto me go set a Watchmen let him declare what he seeth one more scripture Matthew 7 please M we'll read verse uh 21- 23 not everyone that saith unto me Lord Lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of My Father which is in [Music] heaven many will say to me in that day Lord Lord have we not prophesied in thy name and in thy name have cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful works and then will I profess unto them I never knew you depart from me ye that work [Music] [Music] iniquity I entitled this [Music] message the prophecy cannot be broken let us pray dear heavenly father we come before you as humbl we know how we thank you for your grace we thank you for your mercy oh Lord we thank you for your Divine love father we pray tonight even as you have Anointed The Young ministers before me that you would anoint us oh God that you would speak to the hearts of the people that you would break and Destroy every yoke me Lord may this message be a message that will carry us through the year of 2024 father we'll be careful at all times to give you the praise Glory and Honor in Jesus Christ name we pray amen amen you may be seated every every message that have gone forth uh tonight has been uh tremendous to me to know that the word of God cannot fail and to know that he that begun the good work in US is faithful to complete it and just like I heard on the other day it's not something that I must complete but the responsibility is on God he that begun the good work in US you is faithful to complet Hallelujah he is the master builder but one thing the word of God is given us it has given us an assurance and that Assurance is that God cannot lie Hallelujah and we understand that every word that God has spoken Hallelujah will never come back to him void Hallelujah not in Genesis 3:15 God talked God spoke about the serpent and about the woman's seed and how the serpent will bruise the heel of the woman's seed and and how the woman's seed will bruise the Serpent's heel excuse me Hallelujah my question is did he not do it Hallelujah God in the book of Isaiah 9 and6 he propes that Christ would come did he not come Hallelujah in Malachi 4 and he prophesied about Elijah did he not come Hallelujah and nothing could stop those prophecies Hallelujah so we understand by the grace of God no matter what people thought about the prophet of God no matter what they thought about William brand they could not stop the work of God hallelujah and just as Paul said I have finished the course Hallelujah I have kept the faith and their life lay for me a Crown of Life hallel and I'll say it like this Malachi never left anything undone everything that he was supposed to do he did it not by his own strength but nothing could stop the prophecy that was prophesied of him to do to do it Hallelujah not by power my spirit say the Lord hallelujah so I want to encourage you tonight everything God prophesied the pride of Jesus [Music] Christ she will she'll do it not by her own strength of theh Hallelujah judment watera tonight what are you looking at Hallelujah I'm not just looking at the horrors that is to come on the Earth but I'm looking at a people that have been chosen by God to rock the world before she leaves is that right the Bible says amen that the Holy Ghost is the power of the Bride and he said in the word of God hallelujah that he shall give you what power after which the Holy Ghost has come upon you Hallelujah and brother Bram described the power Hallelujah as the authority of God hallelujah is that right the only thing the bride has to separate herself from is Iniquity iniquity when you know to do good and you won't do it y'all hear me it's not the signs and the wonders because those who came to Jesus said Lord have not we cast out Devils your have we not prophesied in your name the only thing God had against them was that they refused to to separate themselves from iniquity because iniquity literally destroy your relationship Hallelujah so much so he said depart from me I do not know you why because you work iniquity oh come on y'all getting quiet but you see you can't be a a bride as I said this morning without scar Hallelujah you got to have Battle Scars Hallelujah the power of God is here today to give us overcoming power Hallelujah is that right we sing that song I'm not a slave to sin anymore hallelujah it's more than song Hallelujah it must be action Hallelujah sin as Paul says have no more dominion over us hallelujah is that correct and brother Bram said sin in itself it's not drinking it's not smoking it's not lying it's not gambling sin is unbelief and un Bel leads to what he said you do not do the wrong things Hallelujah he said you only do wrong things because you don't believe hallelujah amen what's going to happen to this group Hallelujah y'all better hear what I'm saying because 24 2024 is going to unravel something we we don't know what's coming but if you got any kind of anointing with you you know something is brewing something is coming and you better be ready for it Hallelujah but how can you be ready except you believe the Prophecies of the book Hallelujah except you believe brother Pam said he said we are amateur gods are Messiah we are omnipotent Hallelujah we are one with God and when you adapt that into your soul you understand the word is said no weapon form against [Music] me formed against you so whatever comes in 2024 I already got my mind made up Hallelujah I know and understand that nothing can defeat me y'all better hear me nothing can defeat you not because of your power because not because you say so because he say so Hallelujah Glory the truth of the matter is or my question is with this generation or with these group this group of people the people that is labeled as bride will they turn from their iniquity Hallelujah because you've got to realize that these people who came up before God had some kind of fellowship with God they knew they didn't heal on their own Hallelujah there was no Supernatural about them but whatever it was they thought they had God on the inside see you don't know him until he's on the inside Hallelujah you know of him because he can be with you he can be above you but the goal of God is to be in you is when he is in you you then know him is that right he said in that day you know that I'm in the father father is in me and I am in you Hallelujah do I have to be congales for you to praise God okay y'all listening I I guess some of y'all not understanding you're doing what I did I got it now will they turn from their iniquity he was bruised for our iniquities that means we we were he conquered our iniquity yall hear what I'm saying we have no excuse because he conquered our [Music] iniquities Hallelujah but we find out that the people are having a hard time to turn from it Hallelujah glory to God I'm going to tell you one of your greatest enemy our greatest enemy is our tongue am amen if you can tame the tongue the Bible say you can tame the whole [Music] body is that right it somehow it is so and we don't know that's iniquity gossiping and backbiting and oh I'm getting into your lives right now don't you know that's iniquity cuz the Holy Ghost will tell you not to do it do help us Lord you must conquer that that has to be conquered Hallelujah and I want to say to this church if we could conquer that we will be an invincible Army Hallelujah we already got everything else in place we just don't have this in place Hallelujah but the Holy Ghost come to conquer that that iniquity Hallelujah my question is these people waited too late to change and I hope we can change we need a true repentance we need to turn from those things and look toward the mercies and grace of God hallelujah I've got to be serious I have to hit you in these areas if we're going to have a a successful 2024 we must go beyond what we were in 2023 Hallelujah is that the truth even as a child you find that every child normally grows every [Music] year very seldom do they remain the same height and they keep growing until they come to that place of maturity when their DNA says that's it right I wanted to be six something but my my DNA says uhuh 511 is all you going get 5 and then when you get older you shrink like I do I'm now 510 and I'm like Lord hold it right there you see something happens that changes every year Hallelujah and it's something that you know being the person I am I'm the shortest of all my brothers all of them are 63 and six you know and I'm you still but but my point is this no matter how I wish I was 63 God had already ordained me to be 511 5 y'all hear what I'm saying so let me say it like this every everybody's maturity is always a different level you understand me we all grow at a different pace as our brother said we all we all come to our maturity as our brother said but how do you know when you're born again when your Nature has been Chang hallelujah amen see the Deep things are more important to the people that's how people think nowadays if it's deep it's bride food and I don't say it's not but if you don't apply it you understand me if you don't take it in if you don't eat it if you don't digest it then it's of no value value to you Hallelujah is that right because when Israel ate meat didn't appreciate it and what happened to them the meat that was meant to feed them made them sick you understand me but natural food and meat is not here to make you sick this message is not to make you sick this message came to make you strong it came to make you powerful it came to change you it came to bring you into the image of God hallelujah it was not a message out of season a message in season hallah come on somebody you say oh I get so tired of going to church if you do you're sick oh the preacher is so boring if that's so you're sick Hallelujah because if the preacher is a true man of God and he's preaching the word you saying I am bored by Jesus Christ h all right somebody to come to church to some people is like a social club mingle with each other but there is no love for each other what happened to the family altar is gone and the inspiration of science taking place Hallelujah there's no concern that there's no gifts no power in the church they're not concerned about their souls well if I'm bride well if I'm not bride well Hallelujah but that's not the bride Hallelujah see they are not concerned that the church seems to like the fire of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah let me tell you something one thing about a change nature brother said it like this no matter what country you come from no matter what your nationality is when you get the Holy Ghost you act the same way they acted on the day of Pentecost Hallelujah it doesn't matter if a dog is brown if he's black if he's porka dot all dogs act alike why because they have a dog's nature Hallelujah and all the true children of God the same way Hallelujah because they're born of God hallelujah thank the Lord just hold on for a minute I'm coming but I had to go here first Hallelujah the church is moving into uh lukewarmness and sometimes it's cold where is the fire sincerity where is it the love of God where is it the love of God and his people where are they hallelujah what is it it is what the Watchman was looking at and the Watchman for the hour was a prophet and brother Bram warned us about it he told us that gross Darkness would be upon the people will cover the Earth and so what are we doing we're literally fighting and Waring against the darkness of this world Hallelujah coming from the message watch word of the night paragraph 37 Hallelujah and God liken his Prophet to Eagle they are the Watchmen that climb higher so that they can see further off and their eyes were made spiritual so that they can see the approaching dangers and God had set Isaiah up to warn the people that there was approaching danger and they wouldn't listen to him I've got this feeling that we hear the voice of the Prophet listening to him hallelujah amen and today God still has Eagles or Messengers or men on the towel CL up in the spirit beyond all the mechanism and all the atomic bombs and the scientific research he has men who is special designed for that purpose the ramper of of Calvary in the name of the Lord Jesus and stands on the top of the Cross and can send send the message back their spiritual sight is far greater than the pr in the temple beyond the ordinary man a Walk of Life for they are special designed for the duties that God had called them to it pays us to take heed when we hear the things that approaching want to say this Higher Ground Tabernacle you will not be able to accuse me before God word god the word of God today you need to take heed God is saying this flesh the of God is later than we think Hallelujah I don't know about you I'm making my preparation Hallelujah if I go through the fire not overow me Hallelujah because I'm protected by the message of the Hallelujah yes sir Hallelujah my wife and I we talk and all the iniquities in in everything that that that lay within me I want God to remove it Hallelujah you say what are you saying brother I'm pressing toward perfect Faith because I have perfect Faith perfect love without perfect Fai perfect love Hallelujah is that right because brother he said they're twins [Music] are twins Hallelujah God like in the prophets to eagles they are the Watchmen that climb higher so that they can see further off Hallelujah hey somebody he's been gone since 65 when you listen to his message it's like he's right here hallelujah what was it what is it he had those eagle eyes he had the ability to see in our day he knew what was coming our way Fe not little fear not little father good pleasure give you the kingdom hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah all of us have problems all of us are fighting Hallelujah but we don't have quitting in our blood y'all hear what I'm saying no matter how tough it is in our DNA to press the battle no matter how great the pain is we have had for runners forerunners those who have come before us hallelujah and they're right now watching [Music] you we are incomp about great crowds of witnesses you know what a witness is witnessing I've been there I was there when happen y'all hear what I'm saying like shadra M and Witnesses they can say I know what it is through the fire Hallelujah but when I went through the fire did not go alone Hallelujah and when you go through the fire you are never alone he said I'll never leave you always be with the end of the Earth we don't have to be discouraged have to faint Hallelujah you say well brother I've got some problems that I haven't been able to overcome let me tell you is the Overcomer Jesus Christ has overcome for you got to do faith in the overcome Hallelujah glory to God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah you love the Lord amen amen amen amen amen amen amen amen hallelujah you don't mind me reading I got to read to take a little break Hallelujah watch when go the night paragraph 40 you know every true Prophet has a prophet above him yes sir we call him King amen hallelujah a true Prophet does not sow his own seed the only seed he can sow is the seed of the king y'all help me somebody that's why I'm not worried the seed that is in me it is not a hybrid seed it's not a scientific seed it's not something man can produce but the seed that we have came from the almighty God hallelujah before the foundation of the world God says that every seed bring for of his kind if you got a god seed on the inside seed cannot produce anything but God oh y'all got quiet on I don't doubt what I have in me brother said we are not we haven't arrived yet I'm a pilgrim a stranger I'm Jing through this land Hallelujah but I'm coming from God somebody help me here I'm coming from God I'm on my way Hallelujah and every one of us believe that you understand we are the Unstoppable you can't stop this yes sir because God has ordained it to be so Hallelujah this is the only bride that cannot be deceived Hallelujah all throughout the ages they were dece but God gave us a perfect word hallelujah and if you are deceived because you have strayed away word hallelujah hallelujah it cannot be broken the prophecy cannot be broken me and what are you you are the prophecy of the prophets somebody help me here you may not look like bride right now still working on you he's still working Hallelujah and the part that I like about it he a perfectionist perfectionist he cannot stop with you until you're until your [Music] Perfection you love the Lord the prophet of God says I will turn your attention to the king of these ages Tower Watchers he that's the Lord Jesus himself and this day that we are living in was so much greater than the day he there until when he was right in the shadow he spoke more of his second coming of his coming going away if you would carefully search the scriptures you find that that just before his going away prophesied of the things that would be would take place in this [Music] day he knew that he must be crucified he knew that he must suffer the innocent for the [Music] guilty he Rise Again from the [Music] grave Hallelujah he knew knew there was no power that could hold him in the grave because the word of God has said I will not suffer my Holy One to seek corruption leave soul in hell and there was no power that could break that prophecy me there was no prophe that could break that no no power that could break that prophecy his word shall be true and they will be fulfilled in their season and he had confidence that father had said the father was able to keep his word hallelujah I don't know about you but right now I feel like flying away Hallelujah therefore his his great heart that was within him which was the Throne of God in his heart he knew that these great trying times come to prove All Nations people hallelu these trying times are here to prove you Hallelujah to see what you really are hallelujah oh my you love the Lord so so therefore he knew that the question laid not whether he would rise again or whether he would be crucified according to the scripture or not whether he was Ascend on high and the Holy Spirit would come but the question was this is it would there be faith left at his coming where is Faith where is Faith come by hearing the word of God that was his question will there be faith on Earth I come hallelujah hallelujah will he find people believes his word hallelujah we are the Believers Hallelujah is that right he said then I will change now for just a moment just want to make sure I'm not reading the same thing over yeah we did you love the Lord I did Hallelujah Isaiah 55 I'm going close in just a bit [Music] we love God we're blessed people the message is the message and if we could just take this message and stop just you know the Lord showed me the other day because I try to listen to a message every day and the Lord asked me a question are you listening to learn or are you listening to love me what do we do most of us are listening to learn what brother Adam said what he said gave was a word that would cause us to love God right it's like when Rebecca when Isaac when uh Ela found Rebecca he he not only gave her gifts but no doubt he must have preached to her from from the time she left her father's house the time she she saw him in the field and by the time he he she arrived there brother said it was love at first sight so the message come to increase our love for God because if we love him we'll keep his Commandments Isaiah 55 11-13 I'm almost done people Isaiah 55 so shall my word be that goeth forth out of our mouth it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which I please and it shall prosper y'all hear me it shall prosper in the thing where the two I sent it Hallelujah in other words it will not die it cannot be stopped and it will prosper Hallelujah Prosperity means it grows Hallelujah and was ever given to us in seed form when the ter of Life hits it it Prosper it grows Hallelujah I was talking with my wife on the way to church and I was exam exing myself and I thought to myself how much have I grown and how much change have been made in me since last year needly to say looking at me I was a little on the disappointed side hello you got to examine yourself see whether you be in the faith you know I'm not looking for your pity I'm saying these things so you can look in the word and see how much you have grown Hallelujah you understand me because we understand by the statue of a perfect man we must grow we have no option it must happen Hallelujah but the only thing that can stop your growth is Iniquity Hallelujah and we must be learned to be calm in our storms is that right the Bible says if we keep our mind St on him he will grant us perfect Hallelujah have you ever seen that little picture of this the storm is falling the rain is falling and then you find this little bird in the Cliffs of the rock it's raining all around him but that bird has peace Hallelujah because he has found shelter in the Cliffs of The Rock Hallelujah I'm talking about the real CLI side the blood shed for you we supposed to find peace in Calvary what he's done for us hallelujah amen 12th verse for you shall go out with joy how many of y'all still got joy I didn't say happy I said joy happy and joy is two different words Hallelujah when you say Joy there's something springing up in you all the time happiness can fade away with the problems but joy is something deeper is that right for you should go out with joy and be led with LED forth with peace the mountains and the hills shall Break Forth before you into singing and all the trees of the field clap their hands now let me ask you a question do you think God is talking about literal mountains he talking about trees the bride tree Hallelujah Clapping Your Hands praising God hallelujah why because we have an assurance his word cannot come back void instead of the Thorns shall come up the fire tree instead of Briars shall come up the Myrtle tree and it shall be the uh uh to the Lord for name for Everlasting sign that shall not be cut off Hallelujah you love the Lord I see you getting weary but I I just want to say this by the grace of God when we see what God has spoken it can't get any better even seducers going to wax worse even seducers will wax worse but get worse the world is not is not a safe haven they they don't even have the answer to the problem every body is going through craziness the politicians the preachers you name it everybody's losing their mind y'all know that's the truth and the prophet of God said the bride is the only one will remain with her sanity everything else will be insane let me say it like this cuz I know we have habits but all of that YouTube stuff you've been looking that's not building your inner man your spiritual man you that we got to stop finding comfort in the scientific stuff that Satan has given us the Bible say Jesus Christ is the comforter Hallelujah we find friendship in these things Hallelujah and we miss them more than we miss relatives that's the truth hallelujah it and and what I'm trying to show you now I'm not I'm not fussing at you I'm trying to let you see what I'm seeing we got to give it up amen until you come to a total separation can't come to Perfection and Satan is so smart and he comes like a serpent come on somebody he comes like a black widow spider Hallelujah yes sir he slithers he slowly gets to you and the next thing you know you wrapped around like a boy constrictor with ra a man y'all looking at me like I'm crazy am I speaking the truth everybody can say Amen cuz everybody here has something to overcome from the pull pit to the back of the door all of us my battles may not be yours your batt may not be mine but regardless they are battles and guess what we've got a remedy amen amen the blood of Jesus Christ amen amen am you know when the seals were open when the seals were open and the word of God was unveiled and we heard Perfection Perfection Perfection but we fail to see who the perfector was and for so many years we tried to be perfect and the more we tried the more we failed because there's no way you can perfect yourself cuz first of all you don't even know what Perfection is him he the begun the good work in you what you don't understand is that God is judging you and he's judging you on your compassion he's judging you on the love that you should have for your brothers and sisters judging you according to the mercies that you supposed to give one another Hallelujah that's the truth because he said as he is so are we in this world you understand me and right now he's given out Grace he's given out Mercy he's out love and if you can't do that you'll never reach Perfection God put you to the test he puts me to the test and I'm saying this this coming year if you not watch for you're going to find a lot of things going wrong and if you don't find yourself in the love of God the little love you have will wax cold you love the Lord you got to fight there's a lot of things I want to say but let's stand I always thought to myself that Peter wrote those books and he wrote about the statute of a perfect [Music] man CU if anybody had [Music] issues Peter did when it came to his temper he had one when it came to Prejudice he were Prejudice but God took that out of him you understand me when we come to God we got all kinds of stuff and issues but the Holy Ghost is here to sanctify us when Isaiah saw the Holiness of God he said Wars me I am a man of unclean lips dwell among a people with unclean lips he was right there to repent he was right there to see his failures and when God see he said he said when King oziah died I saw the Lord see when you see God and you see his Holiness you will strive to have that Holiness in you Hallelujah you'll recognize just how sinful you are without the blood of Jesus Christ we have no chance at all Hallelujah it takes the blood to justify us it takes the blood of Jesus to sanctify us it takes the blood of Jesus to baptize us with the Holy Ghost it takes the life of the blood to bring us to Perfection people of God we've got the greatest word on Earth the greatest opportunity ever for mankind what are you going to do with it are you going to turn from it are you going to reject it are you just going to just walk and continue to walk in your your your walk of uh of iniquity but God has an appointed time at some point in time those men who were doing great works with God was cut off and they were left in their iniquity and they still thought they were in the favor of God so when they approached God it was a rude awakening for them because they had they had Pride themselves to be worthy of eternal life and God said unto them I don't even know you surely it's not what we want we believe that God knew us before the foundation of the world we believe that we were with him we were in him before the foundation of the world and as a as a a servant of the Lord I'm saying if you truly believe this then you need to ask God to remove all the iniquity remove the sin remove the iniquity lord I can't do it you're the master builder as our brother said if you ask he'll give it to you if you seek you should find and if you knock he said he'll open the door the word cannot be broken cannot come back void God did not come to send us to Hell God came to make provision of us to make Heaven our home y'all believe that let me say this in before we pray there's not one person in here that's greater than the other the same blood it takes to redeem you it's the same blood it takes to redeem me I was a sinner born in sin here speaking lies that's reality but one thing I didn't know until this message came I belong to God and you belong to God and we need to stop letting the devil just do us any kind of way we need to be helpers one of another love one another that's how they know that the love of God is in you because of the love that you have one toward hallelujah hallelujah you love the Lord let's bow a word of prayer let everybody pray if there's anything you need to repent of anything that you need to get right with God just pray to God in your own way Hallelujah let us pray Heavenly Father we come before you Lord Jesus as humbly as we know how Lord we come Lord as your blood wash bride we come as humble as we know how because we believe your word we know your word is true and Lord You've spoken so many great

we ask that you all stand we'll be coming from First Corinthians the 11th chapter beginning at the 23rd verse now I feel real drunk tonight drunk off of the Holy Ghost though for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had s saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as often as you drink of it and remance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup ye do show the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the [Music] Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread with and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chasen of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brother when you come together to eat Terry one for one for another and if any man hunger let him eat eat at home that ye come not together with unto condemnation and the rest will I set in order when I come amen and as I prepare myself I ask our brother to give us [Music] a [Music] Jesus has a table spread where
