[39:29] and then we'll go to First Corinthians
[39:34] 15 57 and 58.

[39:47] while I'm glad they see you here
[39:53] as we stand let us know Philippians 2
[39:56] this is
[40:03] pardon me
[40:05] still on a little jet lag
[40:08] woke up around two o'clock this morning
[40:14] [Music]
[40:16] but we do our best this morning
[40:20] to get out of his way or Saltillo so you
[40:24] can use us
[40:27] let this mind be in you
[40:31] which was also in Christ Jesus
[40:35] Christ who being in the form of God
[40:39] thought it not robbery to be equal with
[40:41] God
[40:42] existence
[40:47] but made himself of no reputation
[40:50] and took upon him the form of a servant
[40:53] and was made in the likeness of men
[41:04] um
[41:05] now let's turn to First Corinthians 15.
[41:17] beginning at the 57th verse
[41:22] but thanks be to God
[41:24] would give us of Victory through our
[41:26] Lord Jesus Christ
[41:32] therefore my beloved Brethren be
[41:35] steadfast unmovable
[41:38] always abounding in the work of the Lord
[41:42] for as much as you know that your labor
[41:45] is not in vain in the Lord foreign
[42:02] [Music]
[42:58] have thine own ways
[43:00] Jesus Christ
[43:02] amen you may be seated
[43:10] there's a lot of things that I like to
[43:12] say but yeah
[43:16] but uh I trust I can get to where God
[43:20] wants me this morning
[43:28] when I got ready to leave to go to
[43:30] Liberia
[43:33] great thoughts came to my heart and mind
[43:35] you haven't gone
[43:37] it was more concerning this assembly
[43:41] but I use those thoughts to
[43:45] Minister there
[43:49] the services went really well
[43:54] one service the altar was practically
[43:57] full service
[44:05] and I I want to minister uh this morning
[44:13] I've talked about it many times
[44:17] but I want you to understand that all of
[44:20] us are changing
[44:24] you will change into being good division
[44:29] or you will change into being more evil
[44:35] the seed that's planted in you
[44:38] will determine what you bring forth
[44:43] but God is so rich in Mercy
[44:47] called he always give us an opportunity
[44:52] to change things
[44:55] is that right
[44:57] so we're coming into a day in time
[45:01] where the seasons are changing
[45:04] people are changing the world in itself
[45:08] is changing
[45:10] and the Bible tells us that evil will
[45:14] get worse
[45:16] but we also know that there's another
[45:19] side to this
[45:22] as evil get worse
[45:26] we know that there's a people that God
[45:30] has designated
[45:32] to be in this time
[45:35] in this season you know citizen to be
[45:39] formed into the very image and likeness
[45:41] of God what for me
[45:44] my question is this morning
[45:47] since you become a Christian
[45:50] how much have you changed
[45:54] you see because if you've been feeding
[45:56] on the word
[45:59] the word will change
[46:02] you can't change yourself
[46:05] but if the word has been quickened if it
[46:09] is alive in you
[46:12] it will change
[46:15] right it's like what brother random said
[46:18] the question was given to him
[46:21] should a man stop quit smoking is
[46:24] because
[46:32] the same Jesus Christ
[46:34] that justifies you if your if your
[46:39] experience is real experience will also
[46:43] sanctify you
[46:45] and if your experience is real
[46:48] experience that same spirit that
[46:51] justifies
[46:52] the same spirit that sanctifies
[46:56] it's the same spirit that will fill you
[47:00] is that right so we know that the
[47:04] message brings change
[47:08] this message has been uh uh desire to be
[47:13] looked upon it's a message
[47:17] from ages disagree
[47:21] it was typed out as the word behind the
[47:24] veils
[47:27] there was only there was a time that
[47:31] only the high priest could go behind the
[47:34] veil
[47:36] and that was once a year
[47:40] but at Calvary
[47:43] the veil was rent
[47:46] and it opened the door
[47:49] for every believer to see
[47:53] Hallelujah the naked word of God
[47:58] hallelujah but let me say it like this
[48:02] what's going behind the veil
[48:06] you will never be the same
[48:10] him Hallelujah
[48:12] this message brings a change I'm gonna
[48:15] keep saying
[48:17] when you come to church
[48:20] it's not how
[48:23] dramatic on
[48:27] dramatic or charismatic the preacher
[48:30] here
[48:31] you come to hear the words
[48:37] some of us have been systematically
[48:40] shaped and formed foreign
[49:55] you know
[50:26] it's okay to say we've had a good word
[50:30] but we want that word to change
[50:36] this is Harvest time you see a little
[50:38] more this is a serious message I'm
[50:41] preaching
[50:43] because I love you I love the people
[50:45] here
[50:46] you see I love the people in Iowa City
[50:49] I just love people
[50:52] and I'm very concerned
[50:56] about the the change or the changes that
[51:00] I'm seeing
[51:02] some changes are good
[51:04] some changes are not
[51:07] but I want to bring to your attention
[51:10] you're changing into something
[51:14] that's nature that is nature right is it
[51:20] right let me say it like this
[51:23] almost all animals anymore when they're
[51:26] little little cubs and things
[51:29] they're not dangerous it could be a lion
[51:33] matter of fact when I went to South
[51:35] Africa there was a lion called Sarah
[51:39] yeah and when she was a cub I I pet her
[51:43] I was close to her she wasn't a threat
[51:47] to me
[51:48] but where she grew up
[51:52] the nature changed
[51:54] her attitude changed and when I saw
[51:57] Sarah that time the last time
[52:00] I wanted Sarah to remain in the cage
[52:04] y'all hear what I'm saying she changed
[52:09] and every animal does
[52:12] believe you me we are beasts
[52:15] without the Holy Ghost
[52:18] Hallelujah when you're young you're cute
[52:23] but then you'll find that cute baby
[52:25] changing
[52:28] and from a cute baby it becomes a brat
[52:33] Hallelujah
[52:35] even the world know you changes
[52:42] I've heard the world called their
[52:44] children
[52:50] call their children little demons
[52:54] Hallelujah and when I hear somebody say
[52:57] hey come on little demons
[53:02] all I could think about is
[53:06] you see um
[53:09] what I'm saying is there's so many
[53:12] influences
[53:14] and if we don't keep our minds steadfast
[53:18] on the words
[53:22] this world is going to change you
[53:26] whether you like it or not
[53:33] I forgot about this I said um
[53:36] there was a brother taking me somewhere
[53:39] in Liberia and I I could tell that he
[53:44] something was missing in his life
[53:47] I still loved on him and you know
[53:51] but as we were going
[53:54] as we were traveling
[53:57] uh you know I told him I said there's no
[53:59] way I could ever drive here it probably
[54:02] would take me years to learn how to
[54:05] maneuver
[54:06] and and this is not this is not I'm not
[54:09] I'm not saying there's looking down at
[54:11] them
[54:12] but I say you guys are ingenious
[54:16] y'all know y'all know how to multitask
[54:19] y'all been multitasking for a long time
[54:22] we're just catching up
[54:24] they had no traffic lights or anything
[54:26] you don't buy the the traffic light
[54:29] thing that blessed me
[54:32] it's because I didn't see
[54:35] no fights
[54:36] disputes I didn't see no great arguments
[54:40] people jumping out of their cars
[54:42] jumping off their scooters no it just
[54:46] seemed like it worked in continuity
[54:50] Hallelujah no I really like that no I'm
[54:55] not saying they don't have those days
[54:58] because one of the one of the brothers
[55:04] uh
[55:08] [Music]
[55:14] curse he began to swear
[55:18] he forgot I was there
[55:23] and so I just turned my head because I
[55:26] knew he was going to look at me
[55:27] I just turned my head and I prayed
[55:33] Lord speak to the man
[55:37] and eventually
[55:39] the brother said brother Brooks I'm
[55:44] sorry
[55:46] Hallelujah that was difficult for him
[55:50] if you had seen the kind of man I was
[55:52] working with that was difficult for him
[55:54] to say I'm sorry
[55:56] but he said I'm sorry
[56:00] and you know what I said to him don't
[56:04] worry about it brother
[56:05] because we all are becoming
[56:10] you are becoming something hello
[56:15] you are becoming something and I
[56:19] preached
[56:20] the day of the tree of knowledge and
[56:23] good and evil
[56:27] organizations and denominations
[56:36] [Music]
[56:38] ignorance he would weak at our ignorance
[56:42] but now that the truth has come
[56:45] Jesus said you either make the tree good
[56:49] oh you make it evil
[56:52] amen hallelujah there is no in between
[56:55] seed
[56:57] you understand me
[57:01] Hallelujah right he said why Satan
[57:04] brings the hybrid seed but that seed can
[57:08] never reproduce its kind message
[57:10] it can never come to a production
[57:13] bringing us back to where we used to be
[57:17] this is Harvest Time this is the time of
[57:21] identification
[57:22] and all of us here this morning need to
[57:25] live deep in our hearts
[57:33] and what we are becoming is
[57:38] if you don't fix the problem it's going
[57:42] to get worse
[57:45] Hallelujah God don't care about what
[57:48] family you were born into
[57:50] like Hallelujah God wants us to change
[57:56] so that you'll understand
[57:59] the question is
[58:02] God call Abraham
[58:06] and yet God made a not made him allowed
[58:10] Abraham to tell Allah
[58:17] and the whole time
[58:19] God was working on Abraham's character
[58:25] but because Abraham lied
[58:30] do you see how it crops up in the
[58:34] generations
[58:37] therefore whatever sin as adults you
[58:40] make
[58:41] and you've got children
[58:45] your children are going to be an
[58:47] offspring of you
[58:51] Hallelujah and confession
[58:54] and asking for forgiveness is the only
[58:58] way of Correction
[59:55] if Judas had only gone to Pentecost
[1:00:59] um have an extra room
[1:01:03] I'm trying to tell you something perhaps
[1:01:06] you don't know this
[1:01:08] but because you could say William
[1:01:10] Brandon was the prophet of Malachi
[1:01:13] 4.00
[1:01:16] and neither will that change
[1:01:22] y'all better hear what I'm saying movies
[1:01:41] they increase with unbelief
[1:01:46] it made no difference on all of the
[1:01:49] Miracles and the signs and wonders
[1:02:02] they did everything that they were not
[1:02:04] supposed to do and yes they said they
[1:02:07] followed the prophets
[1:02:08] [Music]
[1:02:18] but you need a change
[1:02:22] and that change must come from God
[1:02:26] because you cannot change yourself
[1:02:32] the Bible says
[1:02:35] hallelujah and you can lick them all you
[1:02:38] want
[1:02:39] all it's going to do is make your sin
[1:02:42] more brighter Hallelujah
[1:02:48] but see there's another side to the
[1:02:50] story
[1:02:51] of change
[1:02:53] right now we I'm gonna get there in just
[1:02:57] a minute
[1:02:58] but I want you to understand what sin
[1:03:00] will do not just to you imagine
[1:03:03] your family especially when you hide
[1:03:06] sins
[1:03:08] and one thing I know about people
[1:03:13] they call themselves covering each
[1:03:15] other's sin is
[1:03:17] against the word of God
[1:03:24] a can
[1:03:26] um
[1:03:31] did something he wasn't supposed to do
[1:03:35] and what did he do
[1:03:37] he took the Babylonian garments the
[1:03:41] wedges of silver and gold
[1:03:45] and he was instructed
[1:03:48] by Joshua
[1:03:50] separate yourself from the world
[1:03:55] but those little things he couldn't
[1:03:56] separate from
[1:03:58] okay and I'm not going to go into the
[1:04:00] whole story but what happened
[1:04:02] it calls people in the church to die
[1:04:06] you understand me your sins don't just
[1:04:09] affect you if you call yourself a
[1:04:12] Christian if you call yourself a
[1:04:14] believer
[1:04:15] of this church your sins will affect
[1:04:19] people's spiritually and naturally
[1:04:23] God will judge you for it
[1:04:28] Hallelujah anyhow man
[1:04:30] because I'm I'm serious this morning
[1:04:33] very serious about what what is going on
[1:04:36] here I don't know what's going on here
[1:04:40] but this is the message that God gave me
[1:04:43] to preach this is a time for your change
[1:04:46] this is the time for your season and
[1:04:49] don't miss it y'all hear me because
[1:04:53] they're coming a last call
[1:04:57] is that right amen the Holy Ghost keeps
[1:05:00] dealing with you Luke sent us yeah you
[1:05:03] won't budge
[1:05:04] one day he's going to stop and you'll
[1:05:07] never hear his voice again
[1:05:10] Hallelujah but what happened to akan
[1:05:14] it can not only killed his wife
[1:05:17] he killed his children he killed his
[1:05:21] animals anymore what because he allowed
[1:05:25] his mind to be influenced by the devil's
[1:05:29] voice
[1:05:32] he allowed his mind to be influenced by
[1:05:37] the devil's voice he heard what Joshua
[1:05:40] says
[1:05:43] and the devil said well if I just take a
[1:05:46] little bit
[1:05:47] it won't hurt it won't hurt because you
[1:05:52] have no pain when you're dead
[1:05:54] it killed the man
[1:05:56] his whole family foreign
[1:06:46] [Music]
[1:06:52] and the other didn't know
[1:06:55] that the Judgment of God has struck
[1:07:04] God
[1:07:05] the only way of escaping sins
[1:07:11] now some people say well that's you know
[1:07:14] this message this message is boring and
[1:07:16] uh you know if it's boring that means
[1:07:19] you don't love God
[1:07:20] because the word is never boring should
[1:07:24] never be boring
[1:07:26] Hallelujah
[1:07:28] I just want to let you know
[1:07:31] there's another story more than one
[1:07:34] but the Bible said let this mind be in
[1:07:37] you that was also in Christ Jesus
[1:07:44] with God
[1:07:47] hallelujah but made himself of no
[1:07:51] reputation and took upon him the form of
[1:07:54] a servant and was made in the likeness
[1:07:58] of men
[1:08:00] made himself a man
[1:08:04] he's basically trying to make us God
[1:08:06] making man a God is that right he's
[1:08:10] changing us and the Bible said we are
[1:08:14] living from glory to glory
[1:08:17] now I'm gonna ask the question again
[1:08:20] since you've been saved in this message
[1:08:24] how much change have you seen
[1:08:27] in your life
[1:08:30] do you really see where you're closer to
[1:08:33] God
[1:08:35] there's some people who don't even know
[1:08:37] the message even though we sat here yeah
[1:08:40] some of us are just church members but
[1:08:44] God is trying to get you to see
[1:08:46] salvation is of the Lord
[1:08:48] and those things
[1:08:51] can't be changed God can change them in
[1:08:55] a moments
[1:08:59] he said well what do you mean brother
[1:09:00] Brooks
[1:09:01] whatever seed is in you
[1:09:04] it's shaping you and it's forming you
[1:09:08] is that right
[1:09:10] but the truth of the matter is if you
[1:09:13] got the seed of God in you and that seed
[1:09:16] has not been quicker you'll be just like
[1:09:19] Peter you still have all the natural
[1:09:22] things about you
[1:09:26] very quick to get angry you know what I
[1:09:29] mean I mean he was a deserter of the
[1:09:32] army of God is that right because his
[1:09:36] nature wasn't changed it wasn't that he
[1:09:38] wasn't a seed but whatever the seed was
[1:09:42] that was living in him Shake him into
[1:09:45] that kind of a person
[1:09:48] is that right that's why you must be
[1:09:51] born again Hallelujah
[1:10:14] listen you're coming from the message
[1:10:16] absolutely absolutely
[1:10:19] the prophet of God said God Is Right
[1:10:26] his word is Right
[1:10:30] others are not right correct that's
[1:10:34] right as long as they stay with the word
[1:10:39] but when you leave the word
[1:10:42] then you leave God
[1:10:45] because God is watching over his word
[1:10:49] vindicate it
[1:10:52] he's got to make it real
[1:10:55] he's got to make it
[1:10:59] acts that's why you people are hungering
[1:11:03] for Revival
[1:11:05] it's time for these things to be here
[1:11:09] if you ever believe me to know see oh
[1:11:31] do you think possible that all of a
[1:11:34] sudden the Rapture would be five minutes
[1:11:37] away
[1:11:38] even if God told you that let me see and
[1:11:42] you're not ready now you would be ready
[1:11:45] then
[1:11:48] hallelujah amen yes sir
[1:11:51] listen coming from you know the message
[1:11:55] absolutely
[1:11:57] he said if you can you can read that
[1:12:00] scripture
[1:12:01] something that Christ has ordained or
[1:12:06] commission us to do
[1:12:08] and because some twisting around
[1:12:11] if someone would tell you that was for
[1:12:16] the disciples or someone else
[1:12:20] and then you don't hold on to that
[1:12:24] Christ is not your absolute that person
[1:12:28] who led you out of the way
[1:12:32] absolutely absolutely
[1:12:35] Hallelujah man let me say it like this
[1:12:39] yes people who believe in polygamy can
[1:12:43] you say brother Brandon preached it he
[1:12:45] preached it because she'll tell you to
[1:12:47] show you how wrong it was and how it
[1:12:50] came by the Fall
[1:12:51] because if you know any type of
[1:12:54] paragraphical if you know how to write a
[1:12:57] paper
[1:12:58] a composition
[1:13:02] of your composition will tell everything
[1:13:06] about the body
[1:13:09] the information that's coming to you in
[1:13:12] more detail
[1:13:13] foreign
[1:13:58] right and message people preachers have
[1:14:02] Twisted this
[1:14:04] and a lot of people are in serious
[1:14:06] problems
[1:14:09] because I'm gonna tell you something but
[1:14:11] it's not what you don't trust all
[1:14:12] polygamy does
[1:14:14] and make you want another see
[1:14:18] um
[1:14:23] your flesh will never be satisfied
[1:14:26] y'all better hear what I'm saying
[1:14:29] but just so that you'll know
[1:14:32] I don't I don't agree with that
[1:14:35] I stand with brother Brandon stands
[1:14:38] and I stand where the word stands
[1:14:41] and I look at people and let me tell you
[1:14:45] something I don't have to repent from
[1:14:47] what I'm saying but you have to repent
[1:14:50] from what you believe
[1:14:52] if you're going to make a Rapture I
[1:14:55] didn't say you wasn't Sage
[1:14:57] if you make a Rapture you're gonna have
[1:15:01] to repent from that
[1:15:03] and come back to the word of God
[1:15:09] um
[1:15:11] I I found out some information yesterday
[1:15:14] I think it was yesterday and it just
[1:15:16] about wiped me out
[1:15:19] dealing with that same situation
[1:15:22] I was in my house
[1:15:24] absolutely almost fainted
[1:15:27] because it was a brother that I trusted
[1:15:31] never mind I ain't going in that but my
[1:15:33] point is I don't know how else to tell
[1:15:36] you go listen to it again
[1:15:42] God will reveal the truth to you
[1:15:46] but you can't continue
[1:15:48] that Grace May abound
[1:15:52] I just preached on that the last time
[1:15:54] and since I preached on that I haven't
[1:15:56] seen that bro anyway I won't go there
[1:15:58] but let me tell y'all something listen
[1:16:00] I'm I'm my goal is one thing and that is
[1:16:03] to make a Rapture
[1:16:05] I I see changes in me and to me I'm
[1:16:09] still not changing fast enough
[1:16:13] you know what I mean but I know the
[1:16:15] grace of God keeps me covered Hallelujah
[1:16:22] sometimes you know people you don't even
[1:16:23] know I'm watching but
[1:16:25] it gets so boring or whatever to the
[1:16:28] people they walk out and they stay out
[1:16:29] there and talk and whatever more they do
[1:16:32] God
[1:16:35] I'm not here to rebuke you in that way
[1:16:37] I'm just coming here to try to tell you
[1:16:39] what's ever wrong you need to make it
[1:16:42] right
[1:16:45] ah
[1:16:46] second Corinthians 3 18
[1:16:53] I can't make you love God
[1:16:57] but I know the moment you really love
[1:16:59] him
[1:17:01] you'll then respect him respecter
[1:17:05] and if you respect him you'll do your
[1:17:08] best to be the church on time
[1:17:10] just like you go to work on time
[1:17:12] Hallelujah
[1:17:19] you know my thing is a problem any of
[1:17:22] you guys have problem with the song
[1:17:23] service why don't you come do leadings a
[1:17:25] few songs

[1:17:29] is
[1:17:31] you got all these Minds in here and
[1:17:35] everybody want to hear something
[1:17:36] different
[1:17:38] you can never satisfy the minds of
[1:17:40] people
[1:17:43] [Music]
[1:17:46] and I just asked for some respect
[1:17:49] if you don't like the way things are
[1:17:52] going on around here
[1:17:53] you can easily talk to me
[1:17:58] right
[1:18:02] second Corinthians 3 18.
[1:18:05] what this week
[1:18:10] how many weeks have been gone three
[1:18:11] weeks
[1:18:16] and I'm just waiting just one or two
[1:18:18] people really greeted me like they
[1:18:20] missed me okay
[1:18:25] Hallelujah
[1:18:28] that's almost like coming home and your
[1:18:30] wife ignores you as it comes to vanilla
[1:18:32] Museum
[1:18:36] y'all know what I'm saying
[1:18:38] but my thing is people
[1:18:41] how can you say you love me and you
[1:18:45] don't know God
[1:18:47] um
[1:18:50] I tell you what the Bible say the
[1:18:52] prophet is without honor in his own
[1:18:54] country
[1:18:54] if you would see the way people treat me
[1:18:57] when I go other places
[1:19:02] and I tell the people how you guys act
[1:19:06] they would be in Shockey
[1:19:12] and it ain't about Congolese either
[1:19:15] I've gone places and it's like on fire
[1:19:21] worship and everything too
[1:19:25] and I get in here if you see it's like
[1:19:28] Lord help me raise the dead synonyms
[1:19:33] and I'm not trying to be funny am I
[1:19:35] being serious
[1:19:39] can y'all take this because I'm gonna
[1:19:42] tell you what's what's happening
[1:19:44] one thing America did
[1:19:47] to our food
[1:19:49] they put sugar
[1:19:52] assault in it
[1:19:54] they change and altered the flavors of
[1:19:57] things
[1:19:58] [Music]
[1:20:00] so when we come to the real food
[1:20:04] it tastes nasty it's
[1:20:33] it will change
[1:20:37] it'll build your muscles
[1:20:45] say why
[1:20:51] you know that's how when I went there
[1:20:53] when I went to Liberia everybody knew I
[1:20:55] was American just because of my size
[1:21:02] see why there's an American you know
[1:21:05] [Laughter]
[1:21:09] it's the truth folks oh you really get
[1:21:13] everybody's fit and thinning and this
[1:21:16] big old boy coming up in there
[1:21:19] it is what it is

[1:21:25] you could smile a little bit
[1:21:28] yes but we I want you to I'm trying to
[1:21:32] get us to see that this message is real
[1:21:34] and she says
[1:21:37] you can't we don't have the time that we
[1:21:40] used to have uh
[1:21:43] y'all go hear this word and you're gonna
[1:21:46] remember what I said
[1:21:48] this is not time to let your feelings
[1:21:51] overtake you
[1:21:52] right and this is where it starts right
[1:21:56] here right here in your mind this is the
[1:22:00] greatest battle ever fall
[1:22:05] and whoever you listen to It's what's
[1:22:09] going to shape you it is going to form
[1:22:12] you absolutely it's going to change you
[1:22:14] if you listen to The Devil he's gonna
[1:22:16] make you a devil
[1:22:55] the spirit of the Lord see the spirit of
[1:22:59] the Lord is what changes
[1:23:02] it's what changes means does it mean
[1:23:05] we're not gonna break down and fall
[1:23:07] sometimes
[1:23:09] absolutely
[1:23:11] but one thing it will do make us say I'm
[1:23:15] sorry it'll make us make rice with God
[1:23:41] you're not going to get there without
[1:23:43] suffering
[1:23:45] suffering comes with the package
[1:23:47] [Music]
[1:23:49] who are your enemies the Bible says your
[1:23:53] enemy is a is of your household
[1:23:56] Hallelujah
[1:23:59] this is why you have problems
[1:24:03] one or the other Hallelujah and you get
[1:24:06] upset with each other
[1:24:10] I said it is absolutely a shame
[1:24:14] if our natural brothers and sisters
[1:24:17] offend us
[1:24:21] we readily forgive them
[1:24:24] but if our spiritual brothers and
[1:24:27] sisters
[1:24:29] we have a hard time forgiving
[1:24:33] it's backwards
[1:24:36] and what Jesus said
[1:24:40] and Mary and his her his siblings
[1:24:44] came to see Jesus
[1:24:46] and they said uh uh uh uh Jesus your
[1:24:51] mother's out there
[1:24:52] he said who is my mother
[1:24:55] who is my brother but those who do my
[1:24:59] father's will what was he saying those
[1:25:02] that are spiritual those who are of me
[1:25:05] they are my true family
[1:25:09] and if we all are the family of God
[1:25:12] we're supposed to treat each other
[1:25:16] Somalia
[1:25:41] who
[1:25:43] I hope I'm penetrating your heart I hope
[1:25:46] God is doing something here I hope
[1:25:48] you're listening really really listening
[1:25:51] to me you know I don't even care if you
[1:25:53] get angry with me about anything that I
[1:25:56] say because if you do that means it's
[1:25:58] working
[1:26:04] I I don't think you come to church
[1:26:08] just to be seen I think all of us come
[1:26:12] we want to make a rapture we want a
[1:26:14] translation
[1:26:16] let me tell you
[1:26:18] the nominations are going to be
[1:26:20] disappointed
[1:26:22] but most of the people in this message
[1:26:24] that don't make it you're going to be
[1:26:27] very very disappointed and your
[1:26:29] Tormentor is going to be greater because
[1:26:32] you knew the truth hallelujah
[1:26:38] now people say oh the foolish virgins
[1:26:41] they have denominations they used to be
[1:26:45] easy
[1:26:48] when God moved on say when the series
[1:26:51] were open
[1:26:53] God used a different fabric you are
[1:26:57] using fabric Hallelujah and every
[1:26:59] Revival produces twins
[1:27:03] how can denominationalism be virgins
[1:27:06] when they're not
[1:27:08] they're going to take the mark of the
[1:27:11] beast if they don't come out of it
[1:27:12] Hallelujah
[1:28:18] where is that Porsche
[1:28:47] but what we do with this thing
[1:28:50] Hallelujah it got to the place
[1:28:57] hallelujah it's still like that could be
[1:29:00] quoting script I could be quoting
[1:29:02] brother Brandon right here and some of
[1:29:04] y'all won't even know it because I
[1:29:06] didn't say brother
[1:29:08] that doesn't save you
[1:29:11] Hallelujah you gotta know Christ for
[1:29:14] yourself
[1:29:16] Hallelujah amen hallelujah I got to see
[1:29:20] Jesus from my house and one day for
[1:29:23] certainly I will not stand before him as
[1:29:27] an idolater
[1:29:32] is that right they use the prophet of
[1:29:34] God's quotes to build systems
[1:29:40] if it wasn't true if we all listen to
[1:29:43] the adult unadulterated word who would
[1:29:47] be one group because this one has its
[1:29:50] way to it and that one has a sway to it
[1:29:52] we're just as dividers as everybody else
[1:29:55] so if this is United times in size
[1:30:41] oh
[1:30:42] yeah Hallelujah
[1:30:45] that's right
[1:30:47] brother Brandon called his message the
[1:30:48] Holy Ghost message
[1:30:51] and the Holy Ghost vindicates himself
[1:30:55] hallelujah amen I asked those people I
[1:30:58] said when the last time you had Joy is
[1:31:00] it Monday
[1:31:01] nobody could say nothing I said that
[1:31:04] means you're not in his presence
[1:31:06] you don't have joy in the presence of
[1:31:10] the Lord there is Joy
[1:31:13] fullness of joy
[1:31:16] and people are so sad
[1:31:19] they're frustrated you get so frustrated
[1:31:23] you take out your frustration on each
[1:31:25] other
[1:31:31] problem and let him know how much
[1:31:33] righteous you're going to become it is
[1:31:35] how much more Sanctified you're going to
[1:31:36] become
[1:31:42] a winner
[1:31:44] he's not going to change me into his
[1:31:49] image
[1:31:59] if you want to be a winner because Jesus
[1:32:02] gave you the victory can you imagine the
[1:32:06] Lord Jesus giving you the victory
[1:32:15] amen before God can change you he's got
[1:32:17] to change your mind Hallelujah
[1:32:22] and a lot of times people think that you
[1:32:24] can get Jesus in your mind
[1:32:27] listen what the man of God says
[1:32:30] uncertain sounds
[1:32:33] he said the mind is a director
[1:32:38] [Music]
[1:32:39] it will direct you
[1:32:42] and it's very incapable of bringing you
[1:32:45] to God
[1:32:46] wait a minute say your mind can't bring
[1:32:50] you to God
[1:32:51] your mind
[1:32:53] you cannot know God by your mind
[1:32:59] Hallelujah and that's where some of us
[1:33:01] are seeing somebody make a misquote
[1:33:04] brother random didn't say it like that
[1:33:09] it's the true folks when people
[1:33:12] challenge me
[1:33:13] you know the first thing I look at the
[1:33:16] Social Security
[1:33:18] look beyond what they look like in their
[1:33:21] flesh
[1:33:23] I look at heart conditions
[1:33:27] out of your mouth tells me what kind of
[1:33:30] a person you are
[1:33:32] out of your mouth
[1:33:34] your words condemn you
[1:33:37] your word should convicts you y'all hear
[1:33:40] what I'm saying if is your word that
[1:33:43] tells me who you are because the Bible
[1:33:46] says in Sweet Water can't come out of
[1:33:48] the same Fountain Hallelujah
[1:33:55] I don't know
[1:33:57] I don't know
[1:33:59] he said you cannot know God by your mind
[1:34:01] intellectually
[1:34:04] it's one of the resources
[1:34:07] or the channel That would lead to it
[1:34:12] but your soul is what governs you
[1:34:17] you are what you are
[1:34:21] your soul
[1:34:24] now let me say it like this when that
[1:34:28] devil came into the message and start
[1:34:32] swaying people
[1:34:34] with the quote I miss um the Holy Ghost
[1:34:39] without Sensations
[1:34:42] they stopped there they didn't read all
[1:34:45] of the rest of it you know but it talks
[1:34:48] about the life of Jesus Christ
[1:34:52] you don't have to feel nothing but you
[1:34:55] definitely gotta have the life of Jesus
[1:34:57] Christ
[1:35:00] come on somebody yeah maybe you don't
[1:35:03] shout maybe you don't dance maybe you
[1:35:06] don't speak in tongues right
[1:35:10] let me show y'all something let's move
[1:35:14] there was nowhere in the word
[1:35:18] where Stephen ever did a miracle
[1:35:21] but he had so much God in him that when
[1:35:25] they stoned him
[1:35:27] Hallelujah he started speaking in town
[1:35:31] he started shouting no he didn't no what
[1:35:35] came out of his mouth
[1:35:40] because the word of God said blessed
[1:35:45] is that right and he said father all
[1:35:49] these things not to their charge
[1:35:52] that was God in him the same God said
[1:35:57] father forgive them for they know not
[1:35:59] what they do remember that was the same
[1:36:01] God
[1:36:03] Hallelujah
[1:36:33] and right now I'm living from glory to
[1:36:37] glory
[1:36:44] a year ago or two years ago because he's
[1:36:49] constantly changing me
[1:36:53] I also have to constantly repent
[1:37:01] that have problems every one of us have
[1:37:04] problems
[1:37:05] Hallelujah but by the grace of God we
[1:37:09] understand our change
[1:37:14] Hallelujah Jesus could stand there and
[1:37:17] say I am that I am but we'll be coming
[1:37:21] hallelujah
[1:37:37] hallelujah he said now one day
[1:37:45] see
[1:37:47] you got to understand
[1:37:50] this flesh ain't changing until God
[1:37:53] changes it so you're going to have an
[1:37:55] enemy all the time
[1:37:57] that's why the word of God said kill it
[1:37:59] like mortified the Jesus of the flesh is
[1:38:02] that right
[1:38:04] says
[1:38:06] but you let it rot that's the only way
[1:38:09] life is going to come from
[1:38:12] I understand all of us have a right we
[1:38:16] have rights and you could have the right
[1:38:18] to obey and you have the right
[1:38:21] this is what gets me we got a group of
[1:38:25] people now
[1:38:26] this is
[1:38:33] and you'll never get to heaven
[1:39:03] you don't want to hear it from your head
[1:39:05] you want to hear it from your heart you
[1:39:08] want to be changed
[1:39:12] how many tapes you've heard and how much
[1:39:15] change you've had
[1:39:20] am I knocking on your door I hope so and
[1:39:22] I hope by God's grace you'll open it up
[1:39:24] to him
[1:39:26] I can't change
[1:39:30] we need to be changed you know our
[1:39:33] attitudes are not right
[1:39:34] each other
[1:39:37] one thing I preached there I preached
[1:39:40] here in order to fix this church you got
[1:39:43] to fix the families first
[1:39:46] makes your natural family first then we
[1:39:49] could have us a Revival
[1:39:55] well it's true some of y'all have
[1:39:58] arguments from the time you leave the
[1:40:00] house till you get to the door and then
[1:40:01] you straighten up
[1:40:04] then you straighten up
[1:40:06] you're already late
[1:40:08] and your atmosphere is wrong
[1:40:13] how can God move in that brother Brandon
[1:40:16] said he is
[1:40:21] Solutions
[1:40:32] y'all don't have to say Amen because see
[1:40:35] if you was in the spirit
[1:40:37] Nearer My God today would be beautiful
[1:40:45] but when you come in counter mine
[1:40:48] you want the song leader to reset you
[1:40:51] know you reset yourself
[1:40:57] you out of alignment
[1:40:59] you reset yourself before you get here
[1:41:02] foreign
[1:41:40] drink you some coffee put in a little
[1:41:42] cafe something with caffeine in it
[1:41:46] something that'll wake you up
[1:41:48] but if you eat
[1:41:51] you you're not gonna hear a word
[1:41:55] all your blood is going down to your
[1:41:58] stomach
[1:41:59] you ain't hearing a thing you hear him
[1:42:02] but you're not hearing you understand me
[1:42:05] you need to be empty in order for God to
[1:42:09] fill you up
[1:42:11] that's the truth he said why well I'm
[1:42:13] gonna go by and get me a sausage egg and
[1:42:15] cheese biscuit
[1:42:18] y'all understand I'm trying to help you
[1:42:21] that ain't gonna work let me hurry up
[1:42:24] let me hurry up my time getting away
[1:42:26] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[1:42:29] he said there are two elements that make
[1:42:32] up the human being and one of them is
[1:42:35] your mind and the other one is your soul
[1:42:39] and the mind is your mental thinking
[1:42:45] is a part of God
[1:42:49] you understand me and this is the only
[1:42:52] age
[1:42:55] that God can take bring the holy spirit
[1:42:59] because it is based upon truth
[1:43:05] that Soul it's where God needs to go
[1:43:11] if the Holy Ghost comes in your soul
[1:43:13] where you have trouble with your friends
[1:43:18] absolutely absolutely that man is there
[1:43:21] to war with you into the Rapture take
[1:43:24] place
[1:43:26] let him get the best of you somebody
[1:43:29] help me and when you see your own make
[1:43:32] it right
[1:43:34] and listen I think one of the uh writer
[1:43:37] says avenge yourself
[1:43:41] when you do wrong make it right
[1:43:45] you keep it right
[1:43:51] oh
[1:43:53] changing the mind
[1:43:55] that's what God wants to do when he said
[1:43:59] let this mind be in you that was also in
[1:44:01] Christ
[1:44:03] what was he talking about he was talking
[1:44:05] to mine
[1:44:06] he wasn't talking about this thing that
[1:44:08] we that's located here
[1:44:14] how do you know you got something going
[1:44:17] on
[1:44:17] when God began to talk to you
[1:44:21] inside
[1:44:24] not from the outside yeah
[1:44:31] but when he talks to you from the inside
[1:44:33] out
[1:44:36] those of you who have experienced that
[1:44:38] you know
[1:44:43] Alexander
[1:44:45] not from your head when it comes to your
[1:44:48] head it could be the devil
[1:44:51] but when it's from the souls
[1:44:59] Hallelujah nobody said like this y'all
[1:45:01] don't know but it's United times inside
[1:45:06] you know that those people out there in
[1:45:08] the world uniting with their demons
[1:45:13] yeah and they're proud of their demons
[1:45:19] you know they used to call people actors
[1:45:23] but now they're calling them Gods
[1:45:26] because people are worshiping the actors
[1:45:29] now
[1:45:32] and if you want to go back that's what
[1:45:34] they did in the days of the Greek and
[1:45:36] days of the Romans
[1:45:39] music
[1:45:42] Hallelujah and at the same time when the
[1:45:45] devil was producing god
[1:45:47] um
[1:46:01] that's what I'm trying to tell you if
[1:46:03] you don't get saved if you don't give
[1:46:06] your heart to God you're not going to
[1:46:08] get better
[1:46:10] you're going to get worse
[1:46:14] and what does that do for a Christian
[1:46:17] it produces a hypocrite
[1:46:22] you love the Lord
[1:46:28] one more quote and I could I could go no
[1:46:31] two one quote a normal scripture and
[1:46:32] I'll let you go
[1:46:34] coming from identification
[1:46:38] but we pray that the Holy Ghost since
[1:46:42] this afternoon
[1:46:45] break into every heart and to every mind
[1:46:51] as we have just read
[1:46:53] let the mind that was in Christ be in
[1:46:56] you
[1:46:59] I pray
[1:47:01] that as you see that the mind is the
[1:47:05] controlling Tower of the whole being
[1:47:09] that it directs us
[1:47:12] and let the mind that was in Christ
[1:47:17] this afternoon
[1:47:19] and he was always believing the word
[1:47:25] and now may there be a great outpouring
[1:47:29] of his presence upon us
[1:47:33] hallelujah amen we look at these virtues
[1:47:36] and we say
[1:47:37] it's just an idol
[1:47:43] because if that's the way you're just
[1:47:45] looking at it so you can memorize what
[1:47:47] you can do it
[1:47:50] that's all it is to you
[1:47:53] it's nothing
[1:47:55] since you're now
[1:47:57] but God rich in Mercy
[1:48:01] has shown unto us
[1:48:03] how to obtain God's divine nature
[1:48:09] that's what we lost when Adam fell
[1:48:11] apocals
[1:48:13] that's what God returned back to us
[1:48:16] and the Bible says if any one of those
[1:48:20] virtues do you like
[1:48:23] you are like a blind man
[1:48:26] and you have forgotten that you was once
[1:48:30] delivered from your sins
[1:48:35] is that all right
[1:48:38] the word of God according to Psalms 119.
[1:48:42] some songs
[1:48:46] that word is a lamp unto my feet
[1:48:50] and a light unto my path
[1:48:54] all right is it why I said one more but
[1:48:57] this is my last one
[1:48:59] the sixth chapter
[1:49:02] I love you people and I love you I
[1:49:05] appreciate you
[1:49:07] and there's not one person here that I
[1:49:10] want to see lost
[1:49:15] I'm not here for your liking
[1:49:21] I'm not here for you to like me
[1:49:24] I'm not here for your money
[1:49:32] I'm here because God has ordained me
[1:49:35] to be a watcher over your soul
[1:49:39] and I would be a fool
[1:49:42] to stand in the pulpit and play with God
[1:49:47] knowing that he's watching every move
[1:49:56] I can't be like the other preachers
[1:50:00] I just can't be that way
[1:50:03] this is a house of judgments and
[1:50:07] judgment begins at the house of God this
[1:50:09] is
[1:50:10] because that preach doesn't make me
[1:50:12] perfect
[1:50:13] but the voice that comes out of me is
[1:50:23] again
[1:50:24] my family can tell you I'm not perfect I
[1:50:28] make mistakes
[1:50:29] I do things sometimes that's not
[1:50:31] pleasing to the Lord you watch me long
[1:50:35] enough you'll see it see from himself
[1:50:36] but one thing I don't know
[1:50:44] Luke 6 Luke starting at the 47th verse
[1:50:49] we're close with this scripture
[1:50:51] whosoever
[1:50:55] cometh to me
[1:50:58] and heareth continue to hear my sayings
[1:51:01] and doeth them
[1:51:03] I will show you to whom he is like
[1:51:15] he is like a man with building house
[1:51:21] and lay the foundation
[1:51:29] the stream beat vehemently upon the
[1:51:31] house
[1:51:32] and could not shake it
[1:51:34] for it was founded upon Iraq Elizabeth
[1:51:56] I'm only saying these things to help
[1:52:00] do whatever I can do
[1:52:02] uh as far as God is concerned that we
[1:52:07] may change our minds
[1:52:11] I didn't know who was going to be here
[1:52:14] I didn't plan this message because I
[1:52:16] thought in my head somebody's going to
[1:52:18] be here
[1:52:20] I sought the Lord
[1:52:23] this is what he gave me but he knew who
[1:52:26] was going to be here so I don't want you
[1:52:29] to think I'm singling nobody out
[1:52:33] I don't know how you're repenting I
[1:52:36] don't know how you're growing I don't
[1:52:38] know what what but I do know one thing
[1:52:41] evidently God loves you
[1:52:44] because he corrects his children
