I'm now hoping and trusting that God will send me my iPad by God's grace I was misplaced my phone in a restaurant so they were able to contact different ones from here anyhow we've got the phone back

did you make an answer okay but by God's grace I guess I'm not on the on the program to preach but I'm going anyhow to encourage and to you because that makes it even better cause I'm always enjoying myself and so if I go down I might just be raptured so I'm looking forward to those meetings by God's grace God is good to us and we thank God for His grace as we stand I want I want to say to the Lord really blessed those meetings I had not seen God move in such a way there are several people who were possessed with demons that that were God delivered a young lady as well as a young man and a young man when got when the devil left you should have seen him before and after it was amazing and the pastor said well you know the demon is gone he said yeah I felt him he left I mean this man was some type of addiction but he was crying like a baby and God just moved one lady who was listening to the meetings from Maine was healed and just so many so many things happen there and I don't want to say too much but so many had many things wonderful things that Jesus did do it wasn't brother Isaiah Brooks or or brother Ben no rod but it was Jesus Christ who move on the scene I mean we had a shout and good Holy Ghost meeting the people said they hadn't seen that in years and I had not seen it in years either especially the way God came down healed and delivered those young people that were crying out for God Matthew 16 yeah you know you provide the atmosphere and God to show up those people came looking for something and God met them yeah so we praise the Lord for allowing us to be part of that we got hold a Monday which was really uh I think started out early my flight was supposed to be like three something jumped up to six something I didn't leave Jacksonville to eight something and from there I jumped to Dallas Fort Worth they were telling me it did look good for me at the first and then God held up a plane and we were able to fly out I got here around eleven forty forty-five Monday night very tired helping everybody else with their stuff in in the the seat back pocket my my iPad but God all my information is there God knows what he's doing he's faithful Matthew 16 beginning at the 13th verse a voice is a little bit tired but by God's grace I trust that God will bless you tonight now when Jesus came into the district of Caesarea Philippi beginning at the 13th verse he asked his disciples who do people say the Son of Man is and they said some say John the Baptist others say Elijah and others Jeremiah or one of the prophets he said that the number who do you say I am that is the question even though this question was posed to his disciples I believe Jesus Christ asked every believer who do you say I am Simon Peter replied ye are the Christ the Son of the Living God and jesus answered him blessed are You Simon bar Jonah for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you but my father who is in heaven and I'll tell you you are Peter and on this rock I will build my church and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against it I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven and whatsoever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven then he strictly charged his disciples to tell no one that he was the Christ dear Jesus we come before your Lord as humbly as we know how we thank you for being so good to us we thank you for being better to us than we are to ourselves and father we pray that your perfect and divine will will be done amen in Jesus Christ's name let that perfect will be done tonight amen you may be seated I find out that you know many people have their different ideas about faith so tonight I want to minister a thought on faith we a simple message but I've ministered down in Jacksonville something similar not the same but it was by that message that God did do something healed and delivered I realized that faith is something that a lot of people struggle with but it shouldn't be something that we should struggle with first of all faith is a gift from God you know even James said if you like anything if you ask and faith believing that God will give it to you the Bible tells us he'd give it to us and not up and upgraded us not so I believe that is something that God wants all of his believers to have first of all you can't even be saved without faith because the Bible said he that cometh to God must first believe that he is God and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him that has always been our our our downfall because we we think faith is weak we sometime handle faith as if it's something that is natural but faith in itself is supernatural faith as I've said many times here before is God the just shall live by his faith and by faith God created all things the Bible said without it there was nothing made everything God did he first had to believe it himself is that right God has faith in his own word I would like to entitle this message faith like a rock because I realized that when I read the scripture in Matthew Jesus said upon this rock I'll build my church so it's like a rock and we understand that he wasn't talking about himself oh he wasn't talking about Peter and wasn't talking about his disciples because he asked a question whom do men say i the son of man am and some answer different things Jeremiah you know one of the prophets and then Jesus said then Peter said thou art the Christ that revelation in itself could not and cannot come by intellect it actually comes by revelation it's when God reveals to you he is the Christ now we use that word Christ and sometimes we lose it kind of loosely like it's something outside of the Holy Ghost but the Holy Ghost is God Christ is God right Jesus the Christ so when you say Jesus the Christ you literally saying Jesus the God and we realized by God's grace is that a lot of times we fail to see that Jesus the man Jesus was just a covering he was just a housing for the Almighty God the Bible said in him dwelt the fullness of the Godhead bodily and people said well he just a son or he's just a prophet but not only was he a prophet but he was also a son because God made himself man you understand me and he was a prophet because the Spirit of Jesus Christ his prophecy so he was born a prophet not just a prophet he was the Prophet the very theme of this Bible is wrapped around Jesus Christ and we must realize by God's grace that when we recognize who God is we understand that God is not just limited to the physical body of Jesus Christ even though in him dwelt the fullness of the Godhead bodily but Jesus Christ was a man there was a little argument about that with a woman who was from a Church of Scientology or something nine of a matter search of Christ kind of people and she argued with the Prophet about Jesus Christ not being divine for the mere fact that he cried oh what a what a weak testimony what a weak argument and you know what they failed to see that Jesus Christ was not only just man but he was also God then they hated Jesus they want to crucify him because they said you being a man make yourself God but what they didn't understand was that God made himself a man see and he dwelt in that body Jesus said I can do nothing except the father show me so Aerith word he spoke that's why there you'll find in Scripture that Jesus never uttered a idle word every word every movement everything he did was inspired by the God inside him and that's why he was able to say in st. John 10:30 I and my father are one coming from Isaiah he said well what do you mean I'm telling you you can't see what God can do until you understand He is God if you don't if you think Jesus Christ is just the second person in the Trinity you have already divided God and you've made him less than the Almighty and the Bible says according to Isaiah that his name would be called wonderful counsellor the Almighty God the Prince of Peace you see so he was the Almighty God in human form right so you said oh what worry that's why even when Peter began to preach he said neither is there salvation in any other for there is none other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved outside of the name of Jesus Christ is that right and the Bible tells us according to the book of Acts that all power in heaven and earth was given unto him so if all power in heaven and earth was given to Jesus Christ and who is he who is he you know a lot of people say nowadays who are you and I asked the question who are you so you and I must understand in order for God to work in you in the way that you want him to work in you you must first believe that he is God and I don't mean with your head I mean with your heart I was there 40 21 through 31 just just a wreath some things to you since do you not know that God is talking to Israel do you not do you not hear has it not been told you from the beginning have you not understanding from the foundation of the earth see he talked if anybody should have known who he was it was supposed to be Israel Israel was a a powerful nation led by the pillar of fire the same God purified by night pillar cloud by day and it still was God he changed his father his chain he was God in more faith at night he was a fire pillar fire in the daytime he and more fair he changed his mass and he was a pillar cloud but it was the same God right and if anybody should have known who God was it should be Israel even the Prophet cried out the LORD thy God oh here ye or Israel the Lord thy God is one so where does the Gentiles go off at thinking God is three when he's one hmm he would not accept Israel worshiping three gods because he had already declared unto them that he was one so the revelation of who how Christ and God is one the Bible declares He is God in Christ and one and it's a revelation as it is well God builds his church on the revelation of who he is Oh somebody help me now it is he who sits upon the circle of the earth and its inhabitants are like grasshoppers who stretches out the heavens like a curtain and spreadeth them like a tent to dwell in who bring princes to nothing make the rulers of the earth as emptiness hello you remember the time I think was never kanessa a bouncer says that one of the two that actually thought he was God he boasted himself and God said for this you will have to eat the grass like an ox and he grew nails and everything else until his judgment was over guarantee you he's thought about himself had changed see God has share his glory with no one if you ever hear a man say I did this and I did that he didn't do nothing is that right because I think I believe Herod said you know I can take your life you say you can't do nothing you have no power except the power in which my father's given you see no man has power except the power and authority that God has given them he we die just like animals get we hire but what's the difference saw us the psalmist said what's the difference probably say listen you breed the dogs breed the cow breathe they can't breathe when it's time come he gives up his breath you give up yours there are only difference between us is that God has placed our soul only inside of us and we have to give an account the animals don't they do not have to give an account they never sinned but we who are human beings have to give an account to who God Himself is all what are you talking about who's gonna judge you at the end if there's a judgment the world is Jesus Christ in the beginning was the way of the Word was with God and the Word was God it is still God hey man whew he can't change so what I'm trying to tell you is that if we really believe that God and the word his words are the same then this is who you trust this is what you trust I said Who I was saying again this is who you trust because God and His Word is the same listen let me tell you something they're having their never be one person in the judgment that will be able to accuse god of being a failure god I kept your word and you didn't come through that man will be labeled as a liar because there is no way that God is not going to come through he proves himself Oh try me try me and see huh that's what the word says try me and see there's no one here I don't care you say Oh what do you mean brother bones let me tell you something if God don't hear you here he's gonna heal you then that's just where it is but God chooses the place of healing God chooses the place of deliverance oh let me move on scarcely are they playing this ghastly down scarcely has their stems taken root in earth when he blows on them he's talking about men and they wither and the tempest carries them off like a stubble to whom then will you compare me God says who you gonna get there me too is there anybody that you can compare God to every man is a failure born failures hallelujah then I should be like him says the Holy One lift up your eyes on high and see who created these he who bring out their hosts by calls them by name by the greatness of his might and because he is a strong in power not one is missing in other words God don't miss count we can look at all those stars and God knows every one of them by name don't even miss a beat created them all know where where they are understand their purpose for what where were they setting if we can see the greatness of God our troubles become small who I felt like shouting on that one if we can see the greatness of God our troubles will become small this is what he tried to tell Moses Moses you do you think Pharaoh's army is greater than me hello you scared of Pharaoh and I'm on your side and you're on my side and you are afraid of air on his army by you fearing I told you what to do trust me hold out that rod speak see what I'm saying you can't you can't handle a devil like you in question of your authority that you must speak with authority that was the way Jesus it who is this man that speaks with authority then they came to say hey where do you get your authority from what school of divinity did you go to jesus said I'll tell you what let me give you a question I love Jesus I love it I love it when he punched him real hard he says John the Baptist tell me was John the Baptist of me or was he of God and you know they got in a little at communica group Haro hallelujah now you know if we say he's a man all these people around us is gonna stone us and if we say he's of God did he gonna say well why won't you follow him I tell you what we need to say we don't know so they got up up they come up they got a sportsman's Lord we don't know and Jesus says well because you won't tell me neither will I tell you I love that he slap around for a minute he gave him a punch brother see you know you look at this thing and that's how these people do they try to trap you with their questions if you stand still just for the moment I'm I'm working on a message on silence silence is a powerful thing brother Balaam talks about he says you can't hear the Stars you can't hear the Sun you can't hear the earth rotate you've all these great things God say meditate why because when you meditate but in that meditation in that quietness amen that's when God comes sometimes early in the morning when everything is quiet that's when God comes hallelujah just in that secret place that's when God comes that's when God do things and listen the Bible said when those thunders were open when those seals were open the Bible said David I have an hour of silence and when Jericho marschallin when Israel must around Jericho seven times they had to be quiet silence had to be there often time with quiet or you said what do you mean I'm preaching my other message now because that's why the devil got Saul as is going home noise every day all day and it keeps us so confused but you need to take time in your day and get quiet that's some silence come in there so you can hear that steal small voice faith is that right that's what it I just said he said listen he said I saw the they are I saw um I saw that God and the Thunder I saw him in the lightning I saw him in the whirlwind and then I came to know him win in that small still voice see it only comes when you get quiet the Lord is in his temple then all the earth keep what silence see it is power in that yes we love the shout we love the dance we love to do all these things but there are times when you ought to be in a place of quiet so that you can hear God speak to you and tell you what is necessary for you what's next that is necessary for you to do let me move on this okay why you have to keep quiet sometimes because with this tongue we give God away we give his plans away over a long time in the past three days what he told you not the whole world and Satan to just assure you say that the devil said did you hear that get in guess what happens then your mama fits the best meal ever because you don't tell some hottie right you don't told her what you're doing it's best to get busy and forget let's move on what do you say old Jacob speak o Israel my way is from the Lord and my right right is disregarded by my god now listen then he says women now what are you talking about you're trying to say that God is not noticing you you're trying to tell me that God is ignoring you let me tell you something God cannot ignore you listen the Bible says that even in Hell where darkness is his light to God so he sees everything that goes on there and then God knows the hairs on your head how can you feel and think that you is insignificant God cares and when you realize he is God then you understand I was telling the church the other day I said one thing God has taught me he has taught me to love him and he's taught me in loving him I love myself so I don't tell me I'm a mistake don't tell me that everything I went through in life has been in vain it has not because even yet while I was a yet a sinner Christ died for me he died for you God loaded you he made you into what you were to be even then God had his hand in your life hmm he sure did he gives power to the faint and to him who has no might he increases strength huh so if you don't have any power you feel faint the Bible said he'd give power to the faint what you're gonna do about it even you shall faint and be weary and young men shall fall exhausted woo sounds like today sounds like today but they who wait for the Lord shall renew their strength they shall mount up with wings like eagles they shall run and not be weary they shall walk and not faint hallelujah and when brother Branham when he missed the call of God remember he was supposed to pray for that little boy that had on the little blue jeans you know and brother and I ran up to the house and already told the church and everything that the boy was gonna be healing he went up to the house and he pray for the boy knew the man's wife had never met her but he saw in a vision how do you know my wife where I saw and the thing is guess what he got in there pray for the boy and the boy almost died what did he do after that see that's what we fail to see is sometime it doesn't mean that God didn't give you the answer to your problem sometimes we rush it we get ahead of it and he says listen he said I had to what wait and while waiting he wasn't doing all his talking he wasn't reading the newspaper and neither was he only on the chat chat whatever they call chat snap snap chat but anyhow he was quiet he waited until he saw the vision come into view and then he knew to move here it is there it is he's an old brother forgive me I gotta hear to God but now I'm right here mom and I set down the hat sitting in the right place now it's time for me to pray sometimes when God tells you to do something you wait and let God direct you when you in - and God you don't have to worry about failure you're gonna be victorious you see sometimes we forget like like the disciples did when Jesus was on their boat Matthew 823 and I'm working with faith people and awareness we got to be aware who we serve if I'm in God and God is in me I'm sitting in heavenly places in who Christ Jesus if I'm in God and God is in me see the Bible didn't say power and miracles gonna happen to them amen who who have faith on God says faith in God you know what faith in God is means you are in him having faith not about him not around him but in him you understand me for example if this was faith I'm in him not in the world I'm in him he and me that right and when you in God there is no darkness there is no failure there is no question brother BAM Brooks are you in this room no I'm in the living room you're in this room yeah no no I'm in the bathroom see I am aware that I am in this room why cuz I walked into it I'm standing in it that's how it is with God when you ain't got you know you're in God you don't have the question am I ain't got you know do you question this room are you questioning sitting in that seat you're in the seat on it however you want to say it but you are aware and that's the problem we lose our awareness of God and man you and God we forget even the Prophet God preached the message the unrecognisable presence of we fell we fail to see it is this okay but the Bible says in when he got into the boat his disciples followed him and behold there arose a great storm on the sea so that the boat was being swamped by the waves but he was asleep and they went and woke him saying save us Lord we are perishing and he said unto them why are you afraid o ye a little faith now I want you to think about my wife warning go meet with me a cruise but think about this boat I've seen those kind of boats they're not huge like a ship a line or something I mean that they can be rocked but I've seen it the kind of fishing boats you know in our minds we take their big boats now they're not about yay wide one two three perhaps and maybe a little longer not much but they were all to see be honest do you understand how big the waves can get on a sea so it wasn't something loose all the waves like that like you could just float on and OSA these were waves that were threatening threatening for what death do you think Jesus was surprised the probably God says no no no no no God put them in that situation Jesus knew it was going to happen I'm a recently just a woman visiting and what happened they got hysterical right you know why are you afraid he's saying now his Jesus not afraid he ain't screaming no he's not afraid he is aware of the presence of the unseen God he understands his relationship that's what I try to tell people if God is dropped in your heart you gonna make a rapture no death can come get you death can't get you if you really believe you are raptured material and God has ordained you as one of them to take a rapture no death can take you hmm why are you afraid oh yeah literally then he rose him to Butte the wind and the sea it was a great white calm it's a power in that calm that's power in that calm and the men marveling saying what sort of man is this that even when in the sea obey Him better than they see it was still carnal no man can stop the sea no man can stop the waves of the sea that wasn't a man did it was a man when he cried at Lazarus tomb but when he put his foot on the hem of the bone said peace be still that was no longer a man that was God that's how it is with your prayer you might be just a simple man or simple woman but when you are anointed and you say in the name of Jesus Christ it transfers from a man to a god not just you but that's Jesus Christ praying through you that's why he said all things are possible to them that really believed your brother who said he said the disciples were rejoicing on what they had seen him do see knowing what he was with them the kind of like the man mind of a man a man a mind of a man is always talking about and rejoicing what God has done and they're saying what he will do and ignoring what he's doing he wasn't asleep exactly we'll get to that in a few minutes they'll believe what he want he has done and shout about it they talk about what he has done he's going to do glorify God but what he's doing right now they ignore it the judge that's just the nature of man that's just the way he does it and then while they were enjoying the blessings of their fellowship one with another and all counting it all up what they had seen done all of a sudden there arose trouble y'all know it's the true y'all knows the truth every time you think you got it oh praise God God is so good hey let's testify and all of a sudden a storm come you don't even know where it came from it's just up from nowhere blowing you everywhere and if you're not careful your little senses you'll feel these are sisters that you so love this honest what happened fear comes with every test and trial fear comes but the Bible said perfect love casts out fear you can't guess out fear like go home devil you've got to speak with authority say to this mountain don't ask the mountain say it move with authority and hold your ground rock faith regulated faith is not solved is not dodi brother man said is like a man with hair on his chest he's a real man it's the truth it's a revelation folks I'm trying to tell you if you can't believe God can fix your problems here what wouldn't you die in rot you think how can God get you up there ain't no praying in the grave your prayer must follow you the anointing of God must follow you there this is testing ground visit the place where you are tried like I was telling the people I said you know God healed me of cancer but he might take somebody else a different route whichever way he takes you you ought to be certain of God and if you are certain of God nothing can break that don't let the devil put fear in your head or in your mind or in your heart and God told you he is going to fix it he knows the path he leads you our ultimate goal is translation not here not just repairs here our ultimate goal is to have the character of Jesus Christ only is high the very image and likeness of God that's what we want no matter how great the storm is may our faith prevail it must he's working on you hmm thank God for a prophet who gave us a balance of the word all we need to know is see the thing is when Satan comes in like a flood the Bible said the Spirit of the Lord lifts up a standard don't you think is that right the Bible said when the sons of God appeared before God in heaven the devil came so if the devil gonna go to heaven to stand before God do you think he's not coming to church the devil coming to church and he's gonna not anybody peeing in church you know expect people that hey y'all expect this ain't all these angels in him that will be hallelujah and we must understand it's gonna take faith rockface Revelator faith to get out of here Oh Prince God I got the Holy Ghost let me tell y'all son those three Hebrew were not even prophets but they knew who God was they understood who God was they understood that no matter how beautiful and shiny amen all of those idols in in in in in Babylon walk they knew there was only one God and they were determined cuz he see at the end of the day Allah you won't stand before him Allah gonna be begging for mercy himself Buddha in hand do all of them there's only one God there's only one name and that name is Jesus Christ see so if I'm gonna feel about so don't even fear what man can do to you man can destroy the body but God can destroy the soul will somebody help me so you and I must have total faith in who we are what surrounding us we're in this building but but that's not exactly where we all are some of us are in Christ maybe all of us are in Christ but you need to be able to know you should be able to know that you are in Christ and if you are in Christ you are hidden the delicate do we know how I'm gonna stay right under the blood and the devil can do me no harm hmm I believe in victory no matter what I was telling the church I said let me tell you I'm just a fighter I might look like I mainly do not look like I am but when it comes to God and the things of God I'm a fighter I don't care how beat up I get how many times that gets smashed I knew at the end of the day I'm the victim I got the victory ha because he said he's given me the victory oh well I try off he said yes I will cause you to triumph God causes you he puts you in that position he moves you in that position oh come on somebody sometimes we think our prey god I gotta be anointed with this oil you don't have to be anointed with the oil there's no power in the oil the powers in the name of Jesus Christ you don't have to lay hands on the sick you don't have to be tattle a heads I don't care for person a man is in England if there was on the moon my prayer will reach the moon because my prayer don't need a rocket to get there or a bus or a plane when I pray we travel it's a dimensional thing folks it's a dimensional thing prayer penetrates anything and everything that science is just discovering huh let me tell you what prayers does you could be laying in a grey rotted and the voice of God will wake you do do you have you not heard [Laughter] God can take a man may boat and cause it to fluff the float under a catastrophic time of earthquakes in tidal waves we cannot imagine how great the tidal waves were in the days of Noah and God what happened gently sets him down on Mount Ararat then that's faith faith took him there yeah understand me faith took him their faith is unexplainable you can't mathematically work it it's on explainable and if you can explain it it is not faith all I can tell you is that you know that you got it when you got it hmm like brother sang the Samuel says we got Six Senses you know what I guarantee you when he was a boy and he said that I believe heaven had a bell to ring yes uh-huh we put this on the book so Samuel when you get here we're gonna let you know you had a right revelation even then and that sixth sense Amen is a rock it's a revelation it cannot be move is that right the Bible said the man that builds his house upon this rock though the stones beat vehemently they came the flowers came look at all the fuss now Washington lens tripping it of houses and everything else but the Bible says no matter how great the flood is the house will stain to make it you've been ordained to make it is the wining is the crying is the whimpering is all that loving and complaining that God do not he just doesn't he won't don't want to hear it have faith in God have faith in God I told you that time when when I needed a job God told me what to wear and where to go say you choose where to go and I chose the places where I wanted to go he says you go home put on this put on this put on this little list I put everything on why I was listening I went there feel the application out and the man said I'm so sorry I don't have a place I don't have I didn't I didn't break down at all no how we do we get all broke up I thought it with God well what made you doubt because he didn't answer right then I went wrong and before I could get home the man had all called my wife is sitting back guess what this man said to me he said I had to hire you he said because of what you were wearing he said because of what you are wearing it showed me you had confidence in yourself that was the best job I ever had it was this man would let me off whatever I needed to preach and everything he was such an angel god bless him it's okay Oh Lord I'm almost done but i'ma see what would uh the prophet of God tells us is that um I don't either sorry I knew it was coming but you know see he said that's the reason no way at all every of ever being safe see you have to accept what you cannot explain he got accepted you got to believe he that come to God must believe that he is there's no way to scientifically prove proving that but you must believe it anyhow if you could prove it then it will no more be an act of faith God has hid it God has so hid himself until you have to believe that he is without seeing him know that he's there anyhow whether you see it or not you believe it surely hallelujah Eli didn't see the Syrians or he didn't see the angel scuse me but when is this his services Lord it's more serious than us what are we gonna do God he lighted says Lord open he and that's what we need tonight we understand if the Bible said that they ain't your Lord and camp about those who fear y'all know that he does he does we need to open our eyes be be aware of our surroundings but you cannot if you let the enemy come with you with all kinds of noise throughout the day and you all confuse it you don't have that peace of mind remember when Satan can't confuse you there is some evil work somewhere he's coming to get you with something that's not good but if you can keep your mind spit on him the Bible said here grant you perfect peace ooh perfect piece but it's thunder than lightning that's all right I mean I'm under I'm in the shelter of his arms hallelujah how many how many I remember the time a few years ago I think there was in Oklahoma when that tornado was coming just peal across the woman I don't know who she was but one of these old days I know I'll see her you could see the tornado about ready to swallow her house and she's standing on the porch rebuking it speaking in tongues and everything else and the tornado jumped her house and wiped out everything else look it up look it up woman speaking in tongues of rebuked tornado it's in the YouTube you can see it a Pentecostal whoever she is all right no she was a real believer she knew that was in what was in that stall that stall had demons and great is he that it was in heart that he then said she was not afraid matter of fact she had her son filming it look it up you know we've been running today the target oh we uh I promised God I never leave my house again yes where you scared that yes I was scared that's why I was in very quick trying to find a place safety oh god help Jesus oh lord help us God is so real to us in thee let me hurry up I've spent too much time now faith God God has hit us on do you have to believe what that he is without seeing him know that he's there anyhow and I think that marvelous and that gives illiterate people like me a chance everybody to believe it because we're here we hear it and faith comes by hearing and hearing of the Word of God then we accept that and believe that and from the basis of our faith in that we are saved healed and whatever more we draw from God comes from an unseen resource hmm so you and I must understand I believe Noah built enough have you not heard huh I believe Enoch was translated I believe that Jesus Christ died and rose again for me I believe Lazarus was in the grave for days did you see it no can you explain it no did is it did he live yes why I believe my faith has declared it and nothing can deteriorate it nothing can change it because I know the Word of God stands this ok see Christians the whole armor of Christianity is faith everything that we have is unseen the only thing that's real is unseen onyx the things that you can be can be explained and not real they're superficial and they'll die but the things that cannot be explained or immoral the whole room look at the armor Christianity love what part of you is love joy peace excuse me faith launch of the meekness patient none of those things you can see them they're unseen but yet we believe them love never dies faith is the victory and we believe things that we don't see oh I got to see it to believe it know many people see it and still don't believe it huh you ought to see the people the doubt that comes in people when I said you know I've seen two people raised from their you can feel it among believers they don't believe it cuz they didn't see it you know and the second thing they want to say where there's I was there doctors to say it was there no the person that was there said he was dead hmm you mean to tell me you wouldn't take the words of Lazarus hallelujah but Jesus looked at them and said with man this is impossible but with God all things are possible see no man can do it but when your faith is solid like a rock hallelujah hey ain't let nothing get by me and because you've gone through test doesn't mean that you gotta jump for joy sometimes it's difficult but at the same time you got something that's holding you not you holding it is holding you cannot be penetrated by doubt I don't know how he's gonna do it but I know he will ha he promised and I'm standing on the promises of God like I was telling the church of the day I said I don't care what my children look like what they do God made a promise I remember muscles the chapel's how she used to cry out before God when it when it came to her daughter and no doubt perhaps names looked pretty grim at times but that prayer that mothers cry and now she's married and and they're having a great time I would think you know she you know my point is she's in God and prayers was answered see that which may have looked impossible became possible because a mother wouldn't give up let me tell you something no matter who your loved ones are don't you quit you understand me I don't care what it looks like it has nothing to do with what it looks like if the devil can get you to quit you the blood you you the high priest probably God said the bride is the blood of Jesus Christ by the spirit and you're the one that's crying out for them if you quit where would they go what what other chance where they have if you quit on them oh they're just getting so bad I king ticket no think about it if Jesus what it did that to us on the cross seeing how bad we were going to get but the vows that he endured the suffering he despised the shame my father it was mr. faith himself he told him say listen I want you to know no grave can hold my body down in three days I'm getting back up what was he basing his rise on the scriptures according to the Word of God says I will not leave his soul in Hell neither will I let his flesh see corruption he stood there and God has to honor his word I'm almost done people excuse me everybody want to know where did you get your authority let me tell you something just with the attitude toward everything mother said is right he said the right mental attitude toward the Word of God will bring it to pass if you doubt it it ain't happening you gotta you got to process it now how God is gonna do it I'll tell you what I think about the ark that Noah built I still marvel I still marvel I you know what I don't believe I just don't believe that that boat ever flipped you know know you're on or didn't find himself floating upside down but there was enough power in that storm in that flood that's not only should've flipped him but should have sankt him but you know God designed it see there so don't say when God design your troubles you gonna come out as a victim yeah you can't lose he's the one that designed it and I love it because you know we used to play cowboys and Indians and I have my Indians and my Cowboys and their fight for a while and then shoot each other for a while but I knew who was gonna win I determine who was gonna win it they had no life of their own and that's how God has done it man I'm almost done my last quote hmm see brother BAM said we have record that when we tell a person that that's God he talking about this dr. Tom's a prophet when the person you got malignancy or something is going to kill him and also is ready to burst tuberculosis it it depends on what the attitude they take if they get all tore up said they die right away but if they take the attitude will well dying is a part of living it's all alright when I die say you know he said it almost retards that case I just thought if that mental attitude taking like that what will it do when the Holy Spirit strikes that in a man w finish with that right attitude when God comes down and strike that in a man the devil is finished hmm that's what he said you know he says not mind over matter but the right attitude will bring God on the scene right though he slayed me I trust him whether he delivered me or not I know he's able see those kind of attitude will bring God on the scene see cuz he knows you trust him and so you understand when your house is built upon that rock of who God is and you you continually remind yourself be in him let him be in you let you you and you be in him be aware of your surroundings you're not just somewhere floating in space the Bible said we now sit in heavenly places in Christ Jesus that's there you're gonna need it testing time it's just begun some of us might think oh my goodness is just so bad hey I heard somebody said don't complain about bad cuz worse is coming out the bad comes worst hey what you gonna do it worse Oh sometimes you think it can't get any worse oh I'm telling you my God is God amen and I so love him there are something I mean that no there are some places that I cannot go [Music] but this would be my god is real hey I can feel him in my shoes hopefully now hey some folks baseball hey all candies er and leave me alone but as for me he yes oh my god is real I can feel him in my heart real he's real in my soul I got real walls Hey oh it's not for me [Music] tips is better than to bowl my god is real Oh mmm I say I can not tell just how you feel when Jesus

change is better than to bathe my god is real hey I can feel him in my say my God is real hey give me my pen again my God is real hey I can feel him in my face amen is he real to you tonight I believe that I believe that when you seem like you're in a corner or Satan got your back pushed up against the wall don't feel like God has deserted you but that's exactly where he wants you the next step when you find yourself in that position what do you do you call on Jesus amen you call on Jesus only when I ride in the moon when I ride give me Jesus give me [Music] give me give me give me cheese
