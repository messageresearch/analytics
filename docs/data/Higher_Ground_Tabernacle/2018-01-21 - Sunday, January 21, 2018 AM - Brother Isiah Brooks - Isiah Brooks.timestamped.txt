[11:56] we just thank God for His grace in its
[11:58] mercy
[12:00] amen appreciate your patience
[12:04] we stayed a little longer than
[12:06] anticipated they're in New Jersey only
[12:09] because the pastor got sick had to have
[12:12] an operation and then his assistant was
[12:16] afflicted with that bad flu you should
[12:20] have seen him he was wrapped from here
[12:21] the child and his old family got sick so
[12:24] you know how that sickness is going on
[12:26] we just thank you for your grace up and
[12:29] your understanding the brother needed
[12:32] somebody instantaneously and so he asked
[12:36] me and I felt there to say yes so anyway
[12:39] we so glad we're here we think God for
[12:44] the many blessings that took place I
[12:46] trusted you all were praying for us we
[12:52] this message we've reached a brother
[12:54] really was blessed by it
[12:57] his son was possessed with demons he
[13:01] went home
[13:03] prayed before the Lord had been went
[13:06] before his son the demons started
[13:09] screaming out his son I don't love you
[13:12] and I don't love my mom and dad I died
[13:14] and I told him I said when you see your
[13:17] children or your husband or your wife
[13:18] saying things that they shouldn't say
[13:21] you ought to say like Jove you don't
[13:23] sound like my wife bringing into
[13:27] question what's and who's speaking then
[13:32] when you see that you identified the
[13:34] devlins that you know you have no right
[13:35] to stay here so anyway he prayed over
[13:40] his son and immediately the devil left
[13:48] the atmosphere changed its son began to
[13:52] tell how he loved his mom no I really
[13:54] love you mom I really love you know so
[13:56] things went well one sister had been
[14:01] wondering whether or not she had the
[14:02] Holy Spirit
[14:04] and the Holy Ghost start preaching and
[14:06] everything she had been thinking and
[14:08] talking to about her friend they looking
[14:10] at each other so she stood up and said
[14:12] well I know I got the Holy Ghost now so
[14:15] God delivered and healed various people
[14:20] it was a real blessing there so I think
[14:25] God for your prayers and for the Troy
[14:29] holding down the fort those of you who
[14:31] were faithful during that time I heard
[14:33] and trust that yeah you all had a good
[14:37] time with brother Ben I knew that you
[14:40] would it was the last minute thing but
[14:45] you know I knew what he was going
[14:47] through and he needed you just as much
[14:49] as you needed him and I so thank God for
[14:52] our brother bed you know we don't
[14:57] proselyte but I've already told him a
[15:01] man he's welcome in this place those of
[15:05] you who know brother being know that
[15:06] they grew up under my ministry there in
[15:09] Lima Ohio we ordained him I knew him
[15:13] before he got married I didn't have that
[15:16] honor to marry him but I can't recall
[15:22] but nevertheless a man we're glad to see
[15:25] the kind of a preacher that he's turned
[15:27] out to be you love the Lord we love the
[15:32] Lord and we appreciate him I remind me
[15:36] after serve before the service and I
[15:38] needed to discuss a few things but I
[15:41] don't want to do it now because it might
[15:44] interfere with the message as we stand
[15:51] we are going to sing God as our man do
[15:56] time as we stand that wasn't done
[16:02] purposely I remember what the Holy Ghost
[16:04] what it means saying after I'm so glad

[21:34] I was so love of God I I feel like I'm
[21:40] uh out of all the years I've served him
[21:47] I'm coming to really see who he really
[21:50] is
[21:55] to see his love that that he gives me
[22:01] words cannot express my gratitude for
[22:08] what he's done and how he's done what
[22:12] he's done I wouldn't change nothing in
[22:16] my life even my failures was needful for
[22:23] me to love him the way I love him
[22:27] Matthew 16:13 219th
[22:30] I try to preach this message without
[22:33] crying
[22:38] when Jesus came into the coasts of
[22:40] Caesarea Philippi he asked his disciples
[22:45] saying who do men say that I the Son of
[22:50] Man am and they said some say that thou
[22:57] art John the Baptist some Elias and
[23:00] others Jeremiah or one of the other
[23:04] prophets he saith unto them but whom say
[23:08] ye that I am and Simon Peter answered
[23:13] and said thou art the Christ the Son of
[23:16] the Living God and jesus answered and
[23:20] said unto Him blessed art thou simon
[23:24] barjona for flesh and blood have not
[23:28] revealed it unto thee but my father
[23:32] which is in heaven and I say unto thee
[23:37] thou art Peter and upon this rock I will
[23:41] build my church and the gates of Hell
[23:44] shall not prevail against it and I will
[23:48] give unto thee the keys of the kingdom
[23:51] of heaven and whatsoever thou shalt bind
[23:55] on earth shall be bound in heaven and
[23:58] whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth
[24:01] shall be loosed in heaven
[24:05] let us pray father we come before you
[24:11] this morning we thank you for your grace
[24:13] and your mercy we so thank you for your
[24:17] loving kindness toward us seeing that
[24:23] the day of your judgement it's fast ly
[24:28] approaching us this world will have no
[24:32] place to hide but your grace has found
[24:36] us and in you we find a shelter and in
[24:43] you we find rest and we're so
[24:48] for this morning for your amazing grace
[24:52] every day I wake I can see how your
[24:56] grace is becoming more and more amazing
[24:59] to me blessed a service in a special way
[25:03] forgive us for anything we may have said
[25:05] or done or thought that have not been
[25:07] pleasing in your sight let's just a kind
[25:10] of glory be seen this morning give us
[25:14] grace to not only see the word believe
[25:18] the word but most of all receded
[25:21] increase our faith until our faith
[25:24] become that perfect faith that will
[25:27] match that perfect love help us now in
[25:30] your name Jesus Christ we pray and you
[25:34] may be seated
[25:36] always good to see our brother Travis -
[25:40] he's been pressing his way we appreciate
[25:43] that I sometimes get he and his brother
[25:46] mixed up for whatever pairing reason but
[25:49] anyway I'm always glad to see them we
[25:57] it's important that we know who God is
[26:03] you know God is a mystery because
[26:09] there's a lot of people who think they
[26:11] know who he is and they don't there are
[26:15] those who think yet they know him but
[26:20] they only know him by way of an
[26:21] intellectual conception the only way
[26:26] that you ever really know him is by the
[26:28] Holy Spirit you must be born again
[26:33] the column I
[26:35] cannot proceed those things that are of
[26:37] God when you know God in the carnal mind
[26:41] you have a tendency to reason the word
[26:44] but when you know him by way of his Holy
[26:47] Spirit it is his Holy Spirit that not
[26:51] only speaks to you but interprets or
[26:54] tell you what he really means when God
[26:58] spoke to Peter at the time Peter didn't
[27:02] know that he was God sometime God
[27:09] allowed things to happen to us to bring
[27:12] that revelation that's hidden deep down
[27:15] in our heart to the surface here in his
[27:18] mind he may not have seen him but his
[27:21] his heart he knew who he was
[27:23] and it was the Holy Spirit job to bring
[27:29] that out it is the Holy Spirit job to
[27:33] bring out of you who is living in you
[27:39] the very character of Christ that is in
[27:43] you it takes the Holy Spirit to bring it
[27:47] to the surface we realize by God's grace
[27:51] God asked a question who do men say hi
[27:54] the son of man am I love the scripture
[27:57] because so many things happens here that
[27:59] if without the Holy Spirit we would miss
[28:02] it he was a man by the name of simon
[28:06] barjona
[28:07] Simon the son of Jonas who do me and say
[28:12] that I am understand when he asked that
[28:15] question nobody really had a direct
[28:21] answer some say that thou art he lied
[28:26] you some say there are you are Jeremiah
[28:30] some say you're John the Baptist and
[28:34] then Jesus said unto Simon who do you
[28:40] say I am now watch the term son a man is
[28:46] understood by the Jewish P
[28:49] that term subtle man he says who do you
[28:52] say this prophet is see he knew that
[28:59] they understood that he was a prophet
[29:00] but he wanted to know who which which
[29:03] prophet is this and when Peter said thou
[29:09] art the Christ Jesus oh I can't explain
[29:14] it I just feel it no doubt his
[29:17] expression you know was illuminated
[29:20] because understand he was a man plus God
[29:24] he was a God land he had emotions but
[29:30] it's amazed when your children all of a
[29:32] sudden get the revelation or a certain
[29:36] relationship you know it's like working
[29:38] with a math problem with your children
[29:40] and you're trying to get them to solve
[29:41] it over and over and they're making the
[29:44] wrong mistakes and all of a sudden it
[29:46] clicks and it's enough a wonderful thing
[29:50] when that page realized I've succeeded
[29:52] and now he sees the process and he
[29:55] understand you know the equation he came
[29:58] up with the right answer and so I know
[30:00] by God's grace Peter when he said Peter
[30:03] Peter said thou art the Christ see none
[30:10] of his other disciples understood who he
[30:12] was but here he was and then jesus said
[30:14] flesh and blood didn't reveal that to
[30:16] you he didn't even say I did it he said
[30:21] my father which is in heaven he has
[30:26] revealed this thing unto you guess what
[30:30] happens then Simon Peter name is changed
[30:39] that's why the promise God said when
[30:41] you've heard from this message when you
[30:45] hear this message you have heard from
[30:46] your theophany see we got a new name now
[30:55] even so he said I had no longer call you
[30:57] search but I'll call you bride but each
[31:00] one of us
[31:03] have a name and it will be a new name
[31:07] brother branham said is probably the
[31:09] name we had whoo-hoo before we came here
[31:13] so we realized by God's grace when that
[31:20] revelation came then God Jesus himself
[31:24] looked at Peter directly he said flesh
[31:30] and blood if not revealed this unto you
[31:33] but my father which is in heaven he had
[31:37] revealed this thing unto you and I no
[31:39] longer call you but I will call you
[31:41] Peter I'm changing your name because you
[31:48] have the revelation of Who I am
[31:51] see with this revelation that God has
[31:54] brought through Malachi for it not only
[31:58] identify who God is but also comes to
[32:02] identify who you are and so we realized
[32:09] by God's grace amen now Peter got
[32:12] something that's gonna really change him
[32:14] and even though he's not converted yet
[32:19] it's in the making hallelujah and many
[32:24] of us who were not converted yet we
[32:26] heard the Eagles cry we heard the
[32:30] message and it identified if I could say
[32:35] it like this is snatched you away it
[32:40] changed you just in a moment's time and
[32:43] no longer could you go back to where you
[32:45] used to be even though you didn't know
[32:48] where you were going
[32:49] you were like Abraham I don't know where
[32:52] it's going to take me but wherever it's
[32:54] gonna take me I'm going that's how it is
[32:57] with this message you got to know who he
[33:02] is
[33:04] probably God in the Philadelphia age he
[33:08] says he's
[33:09] and the Lord of glory once as a father
[33:14] he was surrounded by the angels
[33:17] the Archangels the cherubims the
[33:21] seraphim's
[33:22] and the whole host of heaven crying holy
[33:26] holy holy is the Lord God of hosts such
[33:32] was his holiness that no man could
[33:36] approach unto him but now we see him in
[33:41] the church sharing his own holiness with
[33:46] us wait a minute now because he just
[33:53] said this holiness was so powerful he
[33:57] was unapproachable but now this holiness
[34:03] is being shared somebody helped me him
[34:09] with us
[34:11] I know y'all looking for y'all holiness
[34:17] and you probably can't find it right now
[34:18] but the Bible says he became a sin that
[34:23] we might become the righteousness of God
[34:25] you gotta believe this thing it's not
[34:28] what you see is what he sees that's all
[34:33] that counts your holiness or your
[34:36] righteousness is that filter acts can I
[34:43] continue I'm taking
[34:48] because I'm enjoying this it's like when
[34:50] you eat a good piece of cake you don't
[34:51] rush through it if somebody know what
[34:55] I'm talking about
[34:57] such was the holiness that no man could
[35:00] approach unto him but now we see him in
[35:04] the church sharing his own holiness with
[35:06] us until in him we have become the very
[35:11] righteousness of God yes there he stands
[35:15] Jesus perfect everything lily of the
[35:21] valley the bright and Morning Star the
[35:23] fairest of ten thousand and Omega root
[35:27] and offspring of David Father Son and
[35:30] Holy Ghost all and in all Isaiah says
[35:34] 9:6 for unto us a child is born unto us
[35:38] a son is given and the government shall
[35:41] be upon his shoulder and his name shall
[35:44] be called wonderful counsellor the
[35:46] mighty God the everlasting father the
[35:48] Prince of Peace in him is perfect
[35:51] fulfillment though once we extend him
[35:56] not now we love him with joy unspeakable
[35:59] and full of glory I gotta have more than
[36:04] one ain't man in the midst of the church
[36:11] he stands and we will seeing his praise
[36:14] for he the mighty Conqueror his hand
[36:18] over the church which is the bride for
[36:22] he I want to hear what he's saying
[36:25] the mighty Conqueror is head in other
[36:31] words he hears yo Conqueror the mighty
[36:37] Conqueror is hair over the church which
[36:41] is his bride he bought that bride he
[36:46] owes her ain't nobody gonna own me I
[36:51] want him to own me do what you want to
[36:58] want to do with me Lord she
[37:01] his and he is alone and he cares for her
[37:08] so I want you to know when the devil
[37:11] tell you God don't care for you he's a
[37:13] liar she is his and here's a long and he
[37:23] cares for her he is our king and we are
[37:29] his kingdom
[37:30] I like that King dumb right his eternal
[37:37] y'all heard that word eternal possession
[37:44] not something temporal that's gonna wear
[37:47] out eternal possession that means before
[37:54] you arrived you were here if you die you
[38:00] are here you understand me there is no
[38:05] way of getting away from him this thing
[38:10] is so well plan is it's just perfect and
[38:13] all you and I are responsible of doing
[38:17] is to believe an act upon the word that
[38:22] he's given unto us hallelujah
[38:25] hello let me say it like this it's even
[38:28] people said well you know I believe it
[38:30] but you believe if you truly believe
[38:33] Amen that you've been redeemed if you
[38:35] truly believe that you're free of sin if
[38:38] you truly believe that you are with and
[38:40] is of God you apart hello somebody you
[38:50] carry yourself like prophet of God said
[38:53] like that King son though I be in
[38:56] another country I know who my father is
[39:00] and we walk like a king i'ma talk like a
[39:03] king i'ma live like a king y'all
[39:05] understand me when you are king that
[39:07] means you are in control you never allow
[39:13] Satan to get you
[39:15] a place where you feel out of control
[39:20] you say that in Scripture yes it is when
[39:24] those disciples were on the sea winds
[39:28] began to dash against the boat throw off
[39:32] the sails broke up the oars and all of a
[39:37] sudden Jesus in the boat sleeping and
[39:40] they felt like they were so out of
[39:43] control - they actually accused God how
[39:46] if thou not that we perish what you
[39:49] talkin about
[39:51] God cares for you but what God wants to
[39:57] see us to do is we need to stop cowing
[40:00] down to the devil the devil had won
[40:04] nothing since Calvary God wins every
[40:10] battle and when the devil takes him and
[40:14] he's got you condemned and think he said
[40:16] all my he deserved to go to hell the
[40:19] blood of Jesus prevails God don't lose
[40:23] none but we've got a fight we must fight
[40:32] God has already fault can I say like
[40:38] this we must fight until we rest we are
[40:44] new creation that's my my message to
[40:49] this morning is anointed to fight we
[40:55] anointed to fight huh because he is the
[41:00] Lord of Hosts the Bible said when he
[41:04] shall return he shall return on a white
[41:08] horse that's after the rapture and we
[41:12] will be his mighty army you and I must
[41:18] understand that this bearer as a prophet
[41:21] of God said did not start in Eden he
[41:24] started in heaven when Lucifer thought
[41:28] he
[41:28] have a greater Kingdom than Micah
[41:32] Lucifer was then kicked out of heaven
[41:35] and it comes down and we we know him now
[41:38] as the tree of the knowledge of good and
[41:42] evil hallelujah
[41:48] he deceived Eve and what was that
[41:51] deception the promise she would not hold
[41:57] to all of the promises right now that's
[42:04] where he deceives us you've got to take
[42:08] exactly all of the promises every one of
[42:11] them even the devil said well it ain't
[42:12] gonna happen you know what I'm saying
[42:14] look at this thing that were you such a
[42:16] liar
[42:19] the Bible said all in the book peoples
[42:22] of faith the chapter 11 of faith he said
[42:25] they all died in faith hello
[42:29] they didn't even see it but they
[42:33] believed it hallelujah it may have taken
[42:36] two four hundred four thousand years for
[42:39] it to come to pass but what is 4,000
[42:41] years to Eternity some of them if you
[42:45] had to open up their coffin and then
[42:47] they may have been just a spoonful of
[42:48] dust but on that resurrection morning
[42:55] everything that was missing came back
[42:58] together because I really with the grave
[43:07] perhaps like this hallelujah but when
[43:12] the price of resurrection struck him he
[43:16] came out like a strong man hey God good
[43:26] see we are new creation this is not some
[43:29] old creation patched up together like
[43:32] the devil making us feel making us
[43:35] remember all the bad things we used to
[43:37] do
[43:37] hallelujah making a stink that God
[43:39] hasn't changed you
[43:40] God did change
[43:42] when God gave you the Holy Ghost he

[46:08] when the Holy Ghost coming you you have
[46:10] a blood transfusion I don't have to see
[46:14] it I know it and when I got new blood it
[46:19] means that my new blood overrides the
[46:21] old and whatever generation of curses
[46:25] was in my blood and it may have maybe I
[46:29] was the next one day to get whatever but
[46:32] that new blood says not today not

[46:49] know this did you you know I didn't I
[46:51] did not know that Jesus got sick at
[46:53] times and we don't even know what kind
[47:01] of diseases hit him but we know one
[47:04] thing oh y'all say he didn't get sick
[47:05] well let me ask you a question did he
[47:07] get tired the scripture says so and he
[47:11] got sick when he conquered everything I
[47:16] guarantee you those Devils was running
[47:18] as fast as they could away from him
[47:20] brother rich what kind of man is this at
[47:23] least we let me make him give him a
[47:25] Smith but he didn't even Smith you and I
[47:33] must understand this what we're talking
[47:35] about and oh yeah oh mercy I can't do
[47:38] that Lord for help me Jesus
[47:39] hey we look at this thing we talk about
[47:41] a new bloodline and this bloodline comes
[47:46] to fight and I don't know about you but
[47:50] I said here we are ready to put Satan
[47:53] under our feet am I going slow enough so
[47:58] you can understand
[47:59] we look at this thing he says all in
[48:02] this new blood there is no failures in
[48:06] new this new blood there is no losers
[48:10] hello but in this new blood it's
[48:14] dynamite power in this new blood there's
[48:20] simple militants hmm oh come on somebody
[48:25] see until the word convinced you who you
[48:28] are you gonna keep going around like
[48:30] some beggar bar
[48:32] we're not vagabonds that's Esau side
[48:36] will not wonder us we are who we are and
[48:48] you say I can't have that kind of faith
[48:49] will you need to only go cuz you too
[48:52] just shall live by his faith not yours
[48:56] not yours the just shall live by his
[49:03] faith not yours that's how God keeps me
[49:09] when my Eden seem to run out I said Lord
[49:12] I'm standing in your faith and when you
[49:16] stand in his way
[49:17] you become invincible God Jesus never
[49:23] cower down to the devil
[49:26] everybody he want that's what makes him
[49:29] perfect
[49:29] and what was it because he wouldn't move
[49:33] unto the Holy Spirit
[49:37] he said I can't do nothing except I see
[49:40] the father do it you know he was so
[49:44] surrendered to the Holy Ghost or the
[49:46] Holy y'all understand me I'm not
[49:48] preaching to gods I'm saying there's
[49:50] what God but you gotta understand a man
[49:53] that the Spirit is one that cannot be
[49:56] seen unless he's seen through you and I
[49:59] you and me and we look at this thing and
[50:01] Jesus said he said Lord don't you know
[50:04] that Lazarus sick he said yes I know but
[50:07] I can't do nothing Lord doesn't know
[50:11] legs get who was yes
[50:12] it's true but I can't do nothing all
[50:14] that power and the devil said what do
[50:17] you think they're gonna think about you
[50:19] Martha Mary and Adam took you away and
[50:21] fed you amen
[50:22] whatever you needed they were there for
[50:24] you and now you won't go and then they
[50:32] meant all of a sudden they come a news
[50:34] Lazarus is dead come in God breaks a
[50:42] vision remember he's a prophet
[50:45] bricks their vision he says now is time
[50:48] for me hallelujah programers is now
[50:52] sleeping they were he's sleeping so no
[50:56] so you can understand Lazarus is now
[50:59] dead hallelujah is that right
[51:03] you see people fall off on that because
[51:05] brother Balaam said don't you ever think
[51:07] I'm dead
[51:08] I'm always alive right he's true but
[51:15] there is a body laying in the grain that
[51:19] is dead no man no woman in Christ ever
[51:26] died we live forevermore but understand
[51:36] that when yo when your work is done on
[51:38] this earth because brother Brad will say
[51:41] God takes you then when you're done
[51:46] anyway let's move on so we look at this
[51:49] thing it's what brothers what are you
[51:51] trying to say I'm trying to save this by
[51:53] the grace of God it meant God has
[51:55] ordained us you and me you and I to be
[52:02] God on earth he's not looking listen God
[52:08] taking children but these children will
[52:10] be men and women these children that's
[52:13] going to make a rapture will have come
[52:14] to the full sketch of Christ is that the
[52:18] truth
[52:21] the probably God
[52:23] that's what happened to Israel amen they
[52:25] came justification sanctification but
[52:27] they wouldn't go all the way and even
[52:30] those who win into Canaan had to fight
[52:33] and fight and fight and at the end of
[52:35] the day Joshua kehm said lord give me my
[52:38] mountain position and it placed me in
[52:42] the position I've been ordained to be
[52:44] placed in I was thinking just this
[52:47] morning and yesterday I said I don't
[52:49] know what's gonna happen to those who
[52:50] are dentists and doctors nurses I don't
[52:58] know cuz ain't nobody gonna be sick over
[53:00] there I don't know what's gonna happen
[53:07] to that the companies that makes
[53:09] toothpaste and toothbrushes combs all
[53:14] that's scientific wewe don't need no to
[53:17] prosper there's no bacteria there's
[53:21] nothing that's gonna rot your teeth
[53:24] you won't need combs I'll be the winner
[53:28] blowing said it right in place I don't
[53:32] know how he's gonna do it but everything
[53:34] that man is made none of it will exist
[53:37] anymore I'm so glad you know we won't
[53:42] have to have have to worry about
[53:44] turbulence honey we're traveling to
[53:47] thought we'll think about it in there
[53:50] with it with them talk about the
[53:52] bloodline if science cos only see the
[53:58] way to the next level is through Jesus
[54:00] Christ they would stop this nonsense
[54:03] evolving from a monkey now look what
[54:06] they evolving into they won't take God's
[54:11] Way so now look what they've evolved
[54:13] into I don't I've been born to be a god
[54:19] I didn't say I was born to be God I said
[54:23] I've been born to be a god I am a son of
[54:26] God you are daughter of God hallelujah
[54:30] and we are ordained to make the world
[54:34] see that nothing can defeat us
[54:37] why do you think God put you and I in
[54:39] the garden of Satan's Eden hmm that's
[54:44] where the battle started on earth he
[54:46] defeated Eve hallelujah
[54:48] but this bride will never be defeated
[54:51] she's a Maruyama she's a supernatural
[54:55] Church and she was whipped the devil
[54:58] only in his own Eden like he defeated
[55:00] Eve in his in her Eden we are e we will
[55:04] defeat the devil the difference is our
[55:10] name has been changed from a fallen Eve
[55:17] to a risen Lord who is the Lord Jesus
[55:21] Christ we are now risen in a rising back
[55:27] into that position where you and I
[55:30] become the word and the word cannot deny
[55:35] the word hallelujah
[55:38] y'all understand me o people that's what
[55:41] I'm saying I try to tell people you know
[55:43] don't look at me you know what my point
[55:45] is this hear the word hear the word
[55:48] anyway let me leave that alone
[55:49] listen word amen we are a chosen and
[55:53] elected to fight I put the I am in front
[55:57] of it for a full reason I am chosen
[56:01] let's repeat this I am chosen and
[56:04] elected to fight I am God's mighty man
[56:10] ordained to win
[56:12] I am trying by the Holy Ghost to fight
[56:17] without fear I am Jesus Christ
[56:24] representatives with his faith to
[56:29] conquer I am his
[56:35] body his power his bride I am queen like
[56:44] Esther I cannot be denied I am the word
[56:51] I am God's weaponry they old in flesh I
[56:59] am that I am I hope y'all said that in
[57:04] faith the Holy Spirit gave that to me I
[57:09] thought it was a song but he says no
[57:11] have the people repeated you see because
[57:15] he showed me that even in an army we see
[57:20] I can say I'm brainwashed people
[57:24] well they brainwash people by making
[57:27] them say certain things to convince
[57:30] themselves that they are right you know
[57:34] you know you find people who are so
[57:38] brainwashed so they are charged a man
[57:41] with a machine gun if he wasn't
[57:47] brainwashed he fear with overtaking you
[57:51] understand what I'm saying
[57:53] am I right or wrong the Word of God came
[57:57] came to wash your brain clean your mind
[58:02] change your mind just like the devil
[58:08] does the job becomes to change your mind
[58:12] he comes to change your mind who but he
[58:16] says you are and you know you ain't
[58:17] never lose and if you believe it that's
[58:20] what you become then God is saying
[58:24] through the Word of God you are more
[58:26] than a conqueror now who you gonna
[58:28] believe you gonna believe the devil's
[58:30] lie are you gonna believe God oh stop
[58:34] being so human stop being so fleshly
[58:37] people the poor the ears
[58:38] whatever God said that's who you are it
[58:43] sound like I'm fussing but I'm screaming
[58:44] like an ego that's all this is just an
[58:46] important message to me and I'm trying
[58:49] to get
[58:49] over to you because let me tell you
[58:51] something you and I think you're going
[58:53] through trials you need to be ashamed of
[58:55] yourself you paint so hard I don't know
[58:58] what I'm gonna do I'm gonna tell you
[58:59] something
[59:00] I sound like concrete Kadri
[59:04] he must be up in the pulpit somewhere
[59:06] but nevertheless the point is it's gonna
[59:12] get rough rougher it's gonna get harder
[59:22] folks and you letting the devil take
[59:24] your joy with this little stuff
[59:27] distracting you like god don't care like
[59:30] God care if God can move a mountain he
[59:32] can move whatever you need to be moved
[59:35] you just need to wait and hold up have
[59:38] faith in God
[59:40] it was the faith that pleases him when
[59:43] God see you worrying and fretting about
[59:45] things he cannot move you just tied in
[59:48] with unbelief but when you have faith in
[59:51] God and you move and stand there not I
[59:53] can't go nowhere but I'm gonna hold on
[59:56] to what you promised then God will move
[59:58] for you is that right God put you to the
[1:00:03] test in this army you must be tried
[1:00:08] hallelujah amen even in the Army
[1:00:10] military you have what they call
[1:00:12] obstacle courses you're not there for a
[1:00:14] picnic you're learning you're training
[1:00:17] and you're learning how to be a good
[1:00:19] soldier and so they tried to produce it
[1:00:22] meant obstacles that things that you
[1:00:24] would probably go through in a real war
[1:00:27] so that you will know how to react to it
[1:00:31] cuz understand this to say the end of it
[1:00:35] when we've had our honeymoon with God we
[1:00:37] come back Amen to fight one more time
[1:00:40] and the Bible said the bride Jesus
[1:00:44] himself amen will calm down have
[1:00:46] everything we ruin a rod of iron brother
[1:00:49] he no grace in this now devil we know
[1:00:52] who you are God is already redeemed
[1:00:54] hears hallelujah and we know who you are
[1:00:57] you can't you see time we fail to see
[1:01:03] who we really are we've got to stop
[1:01:04] thinking this let this mind be in you
[1:01:07] that was also in Christ Jesus let this
[1:01:10] mind be in you there was also in Christ
[1:01:13] Jesus and whose mind he had he had the
[1:01:16] mind of Elohim he had the mind of
[1:01:18] Jehovah he had the mind y'all hear me he
[1:01:21] had the mind of God and when we get the
[1:01:25] mind that was in Christ Jesus I'm
[1:01:27] putting this way we get Jesus mind but
[1:01:30] we get Jesus mind jesus said I came in
[1:01:34] my father's name like I asked a question
[1:01:37] the other day I said when you get the
[1:01:39] whole egos what do you get who do you
[1:01:41] get if that same spirit be in you that
[1:01:46] was also in Christ Jesus what spirit was
[1:01:48] in Christ
[1:01:49] that's exile that's that blows me away
[1:01:53] that's a powerful revelation because if
[1:01:58] you don't understand that what you think
[1:02:00] is that you getting the Holy Ghost plus
[1:02:02] a man's spirit that's why brother
[1:02:06] Branham said this is God ain't looking
[1:02:08] for us to have no nail-scarred hands
[1:02:10] he's not asking us to wear no long hair
[1:02:13] when I'm man you know me he's not asking
[1:02:15] us to wear robes like Jesus did
[1:02:17] hallelujah
[1:02:20] but what we get is a very nature and
[1:02:23] character of God that makes us walk like
[1:02:27] Jesus act like Jesus think like Jesus
[1:02:33] submit like Jesus a lot of people don't
[1:02:37] see that this war calls for a lot of
[1:02:43] surrender and the closer you get to your
[1:02:48] gold in this life the more you're gonna
[1:02:51] have to surrender y'all hear me
[1:02:54] Jesus surrendered in in God the God
[1:02:57] gasps M&E but think about it he had to
[1:03:03] surrender even more walking that road up
[1:03:09] to Calvary he
[1:03:12] they're in the garden and the Bible said
[1:03:16] an angel came and strengthened him he
[1:03:17] y'all hear what I'm saying and he walked
[1:03:22] in you imagine some of us can't stand
[1:03:25] when somebody talk about us one time but
[1:03:28] here to his face they calling him names
[1:03:30] they spitting in his face
[1:03:32] and the Bible said he opened not his
[1:03:34] mouth surrendering he had to be a lamb
[1:03:38] and this pressure when the squeeze come
[1:03:40] you gonna have to be a lamb God will
[1:03:44] require you to be a lamb
[1:03:47] you understand me if roses had
[1:03:51] instructor walk Rock twice people more
[1:03:53] than likely wouldn't would would not
[1:03:54] have a cut have to go through this but
[1:03:57] brother mmmm said because Moses struck
[1:03:59] the rock twice bop bop when God told him
[1:04:02] to speak to the rock but striking the
[1:04:05] rocks twice mean that Christ now had to
[1:04:07] be crucified twice and now here we are
[1:04:11] Christ in the last age is that right
[1:04:17] rejected brought into into judgment in
[1:04:21] 1956-57 redacted now we've got to suffer
[1:04:31] because Moses struck the right brought
[1:04:34] twice crucified afresh in this
[1:04:40] generation that's why the
[1:04:46] God would be a little harsh on this
[1:04:48] generation than any generation before
[1:04:50] it's gonna be seven times worse because
[1:05:01] God said o Capernaum caproni Los Angeles
[1:05:11] Los Angeles you the city was called by
[1:05:16] the name of the Angels hmm you
[1:05:20] understand me such a revival came out of
[1:05:23] Los Angeles shook the entire world
[1:05:27] miracles signs wonders dead raised eyes
[1:05:31] of the blind open ears stop unstopped
[1:05:33] Amen all kinds of miracles happen Miss
[1:05:36] America should be worshipping only one
[1:05:38] God and that should be the Lord Jesus
[1:05:40] Christ but instead Amen we allowed and
[1:05:44] listen you heard me say this truth
[1:05:46] before I'm gonna close in a minute yeah
[1:05:48] is only the church stay pure the
[1:05:51] judgment of God cannot fall it's when
[1:05:54] the judge when the church goes bad
[1:05:56] that's when judgment comes right start
[1:06:00] at the house of God in Ezekiel right
[1:06:03] started the house of God strong with the
[1:06:05] ancient of the days start with the old
[1:06:07] people because they know better and some
[1:06:12] of us amen and I don't understand it in
[1:06:14] this message how people let folks go on
[1:06:16] without the Holy Ghost I'm gonna keep
[1:06:18] preaching it I'm gonna keep telling you
[1:06:19] whether you do it or whether you get it
[1:06:21] or not is up to you I can't give it to
[1:06:23] you but I'm gonna keep preaching it
[1:06:27] because I know it is a sick law you
[1:06:30] can't make a rapture without the Holy
[1:06:32] Ghost I don't care how much you know
[1:06:35] this Bible you can probably out quote me
[1:06:38] but that don't mean you're saying that
[1:06:41] don't mean you gonna make a rapture
[1:06:43] you've got to be blood wash and blood
[1:06:46] filled you got to have God only inside
[1:06:49] of you listen I follow the Prophet that
[1:06:55] don't mean a thing millions died who
[1:06:58] fallen Moses
[1:07:00] two of them understood that Moses was
[1:07:02] just available that he lied I mean God
[1:07:05] was living in that okay I'm almost done
[1:07:12] just give you a few more minutes
[1:07:15] Ephesians finally my brother the sixth
[1:07:18] chapter
[1:07:18] you know the turn there but finally my
[1:07:20] brother be strong in the Lord and in the
[1:07:23] power of his might put on the whole
[1:07:25] armor of God you may be able to stand
[1:07:27] against the wiles of the devil and I'm
[1:07:30] gonna tell y'all something you know what
[1:07:31] the problem with this so-called church
[1:07:34] that's supposed to be mighty right now
[1:07:35] we've got too many distractions
[1:07:37] everybody wants worldly ambition it's
[1:07:39] okay but Jesus must come first he will
[1:07:43] not take second place in your life he's
[1:07:46] not one that can do that He is God
[1:07:50] he's the only potentate you understand
[1:07:53] me he's the only authority he's the
[1:07:56] chief of all Chiefs he's the king of
[1:07:58] kings and the Lord of lords he's not
[1:08:01] gonna take second place third you might
[1:08:04] as well forget it
[1:08:07] he must be first you examine yourself is
[1:08:14] God first in your life he must be first
[1:08:20] he cannot be second you can't be first
[1:08:24] not even you
[1:08:27] you must come second or third y'all
[1:08:33] gettin quiet but I'm giving you
[1:08:34] something to think about
[1:08:35] I'm talking about a rapture and we had a
[1:08:37] place right now it could happen anytime
[1:08:39] and still be scriptural wrestle not
[1:08:45] against flesh and blood but against

[1:18:18] just try it try it try it
[1:18:24] God start speaking without you said what
[1:18:27] brother
[1:18:27] I'm the word you know I don't know all I
[1:18:30] know is that Jesus saw a tree that
[1:18:32] wasn't that wasn't producing anything
[1:18:34] and he cursed the thing from his roots
[1:18:36] you are a tree you must produce Christ
[1:18:41] you must cuz God is coming back for the
[1:18:45] fruit but not of Christ he must see the
[1:18:50] thing on display you love the Lord but
[1:18:52] you gotta fight for word but let me tell
[1:18:55] you how you fight you stand still you
[1:19:03] stop
[1:19:05] trying to do all the impossible that you
[1:19:09] know yourself you can't do but then when
[1:19:13] you stop getting in God's Way thing
[1:19:16] that's when God a move you understand me
[1:19:21] you say find me some scriptures Moses
[1:19:23] why are you crying to me even Moses
[1:19:28] realized what am I doing here it is God
[1:19:30] has given me the authority to do all of
[1:19:32] these things and I'm in my human flesh
[1:19:35] looking at something that's impossible
[1:19:38] for me to do
[1:19:40] God said why are you crying to me speak
[1:19:42] it Moses
[1:19:44] hello did he say to those children the
[1:19:48] disciples on the boat did you see your
[1:19:50] vision before you know they were the cry
[1:19:53] of crises
[1:19:55] the ship was getting ready to go down
[1:19:58] there are times they meant you need to
[1:20:01] speak and forget about the protocol but
[1:20:08] here was he was he was a Moses Amen
[1:20:12] Garden delivered and all of these
[1:20:14] plagues and everything all miracles if
[1:20:16] he just holy had the David of my mind of
[1:20:18] David at that time he would have went
[1:20:20] for but something disconnect he broke
[1:20:22] broke the connection and he cries out to
[1:20:25] God like God helping God says how can I
[1:20:28] help you when I'm giving you everything
[1:20:31] you need how can God help us more than
[1:20:36] he's already helped us and when ain't
[1:20:39] giving you the Holy Ghost that's the
[1:20:40] best gift he can ever give you he's
[1:20:44] giving it to you but what is it we don't
[1:20:46] use it I remember my brother you know he
[1:20:55] was bragging on his wife says oh my he
[1:20:57] just got a merit and says man she don't
[1:20:59] even use the mop she get on the floor
[1:21:01] with the towel and mop so like then here
[1:21:04] on my right he thought that was good I
[1:21:08] tell you how good it felt when he said
[1:21:11] that I'm saying okay and I had the
[1:21:13] choice to ride a horse or drive a car
[1:21:17] which one without you
[1:21:20] huh you got a big old mop there come on
[1:21:28] somebody how many people coming in your
[1:21:30] house trying to see how shiny your flow
[1:21:32] is okay about that most of the people
[1:21:37] walk right on it if you don't tell them
[1:21:39] to take the shoes off y'all understand
[1:21:44] what I'm saying here I'm trying to tell
[1:21:46] you you've got omnipotence you got the
[1:21:49] supplier you got everything on the
[1:21:50] inside of you and you crying out to God
[1:21:54] help me I've already given you you sure
[1:22:01] when brother was you gotta feel things
[1:22:02] let me tell you something I got it I put
[1:22:04] this way hair
[1:22:05] there are times I've spoken things and
[1:22:07] they come right to pass I didn't feel no
[1:22:12] goosebumps I didn't hear no order of us
[1:22:14] it was that I needed Jesus at the same
[1:22:16] time and I knew he was at me and so I
[1:22:18] allow him to speak through me oh come on
[1:22:21] so right there are things that are done
[1:22:24] by inspiration there are things that you
[1:22:27] know you need to do by knowledge you
[1:22:29] don't know why you need to do it or why
[1:22:30] you need to say it but you say it anyway
[1:22:32] and it comes to pass y'all hear me but
[1:22:36] we need to get in tune with God so much
[1:22:38] so that he can use you so that there's
[1:22:40] Satan and the creation can see that the
[1:22:43] manifestation think that's the sons of
[1:22:45] God is on the move you talk about a
[1:22:48] rapture they groan and wait to see you
[1:22:51] move once you and I move I'll move it
[1:22:55] nature go gets get excited it says now
[1:22:58] is the time hallelujah now is the time
[1:23:01] we can break up now hallelujah we can
[1:23:04] cause California to sing come out
[1:23:07] somebody we can cause earthquakes we can
[1:23:09] cause we can renew ourselves because the
[1:23:12] son of gods are being renewed that's
[1:23:18] what I'm looking for
[1:23:19] that's what I want I want nothing other
[1:23:22] than God to be seen through me lest an
[1:23:31] help us in our mind but you allow us
[1:23:34] these minds of us to be transformed that
[1:23:38] will stop thinking so Cano in condemning
[1:23:40] ourselves when you have already
[1:23:42] justified us lord help us it doesn't
[1:23:47] mean we don't confess nor but we do
[1:23:49] confess one of the things I wanted to
[1:23:57] say I have a daughter that's wayward
[1:24:01] really wayward
