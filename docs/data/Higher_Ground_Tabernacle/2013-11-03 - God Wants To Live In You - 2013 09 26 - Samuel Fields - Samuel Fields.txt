TRANSCRIPT
========================================
power [Music] in wonderful Power in the Blood there is power Wonder In The Blood of the power power Wonder work in precious of [Music] the amen God bless you bless it's good to be here with you I find I have a good friend and brother I forget name too can me turn to Romans chapter 7 ran chapter 7 start verse seven what shall we say then is the LA sin God forbid he I had not known sin but by the law for what shall we say then is the law sin God forbid nay I had not known sin but by the law for I had not known lust except the law had said Thou shalt not covered but sin taking occasion by the Commandment wrought in me all manner of conness something like for without the law sin was dead for I was alive without the law once but when the Commandment came sin revived and I died and the Commandment which was ordained to life I found to be unto death for sin taking occasion by the Commandment deceived me and by it slew me wherefore the law is Holy and the Commandment holy and just and good was then that which is good made death unto me God forbid but sin that is is that it might appear sin working death in Me by that which is good that sin by the Commandment might become exceeding sinful let's just pray precious father please open this word do all in Jesus name amen you be seated can ask how many of you understood that amen if if you understood that reading lift your hand to the Lord amen you see when Jesus Christ died he died for me amen he died for you amen and we have got to get out of third person theology that's a that's a technical term third person Theology and what that means is that God he wants you to take things from the third person and put into the first person now the third person if you if you been to school learning English the third person is you the first person is me that's good so when we see scriptures the just shall live by faith amen that means that you have to take from a third person to the just and put in the first person I am just amen and we have to do that yes sir we have a personal salvation amen well you should have yes that should be with you everywhere you go amen and unless you got right attitude to the scriptures you're not going to receive that salvation the just shall live by faith doesn't it sound better to you when if you say I just because I live by faith and then you can rejoice you you you can walk with Jesus during the day and that faith will keep you what about when you do wrong for 17 chapter 7 Al verse 16 if then I do that which I would not and consent unto the law that it is good now then it is no more than do it but sin andth in me amen you what you just read it's no longer sins but sin didn't worth me amen hallelujah yes amen is is no longer all sins it's sin me amen and we know we have sin in our mortal bodies yes sir we know it amen and God wants you to to be aware that it's not you that sins but it's your Mor sin that dwells in your mortal body amen are you washed in the blood yes you see I'm not saying we're perfect go like we are what I'm saying you got to realize what Jesus has done for you we we look at the ABCs and we look down on them and instead of instead of meditating on living them we will con that and go for the one sense and because uh our foundation isn't that solid we build a leaning tower of pza that's right and God wants you to walk straight with him with him he want be a to use you but unless you prep have 247 every day every week relationship with him then God won't bless you yes because God want you to relationship with him yeah he W be to say to you I want you to talk to that brother over there and you and you'll be tuned after over there that's his desire old Pentecost him I he me and God he still wants that relationship with his church especially his bro am we need Joy amen we need love amen we need Jesus amen be H with you I was preach on on something different but but as I said yeah L told me to change the subject yes and so I did but but he wants you to be aware that your life is affective his life in it it is the only church the first first love and we we're in middle of restoration now restoration is something that is precious but also has to be done in set order am before you put the B the St before you put the leaves on branches and this is so important the last thing out be the first thing went in the last thing it came the first it came in right the first it came in was your rest your first love and God he he want us him is his first love and because you jur lost it first love and Fell From Grace they didn't repent and on S because I don't want to Jesus I have my first and so I must look to him and walk with him and talk with him do you do that do youy him what the Bible say if you love me you'll keep command amen Jesus said that yes he did do you love amen his Commandments because if you don't you don't love him it want to change you yes sir that's right at first but but but we many rooms in our spirits and souls to change to redecorate we from a sinful way to a holy way and God want to do that in you and if you're not prepared to let him do it then he let you say you are because he's a gentleman amen and that gentleman wants you to willingly give your life to him amen and many people were not prepared to do that they say they meeting like this they meeting like this they can do all sorts of things and they can worship God they can praise him but let me say this praise is is wonderful in its place but it's one way it's from your heart the Lord amen that's right and so you know not L for reply when pray all you're worshiping him you're praising him and if God is trying to say something and and you are praising the Lord so it happens God God what say this your life and you praise the Lord praise the Lord praise the Lord Praise not listening and then God said want you change me praise the Lord praise the Lord prise yeah and then after that you what a great me I've been to from God Amen and God wants you to be full of him amen he wants you to be full of his word amen he wants to be Revelation that's right that Revelation is important because do you know what Revelation is it's God giv you one of his original thoughts that's right if you speak that in faith that is powerful but but God wants you to be a normal everyday Christian you must hide himself here and we we often don't right that we have things we want to do instead of sharing it with gods and let him do it through us we do it our own way are you prepared to let God come into your heart and Rule it and change it he he may been trying TR for years responded I don't know but but I know when God was speaking to me I've been Minister for 30 years I know when God put on my heart to say and I'm looking for a Rapture amen let me say this I Rapture because because when go s Moses to to Egypt I'm coming down to do my people when God came down comes down in in the Rapture according toi chapter 4 God came and sent forth his word going for but but God did the same in Moses many years ago and go came down him for Prophet it sounds familiar it but Rapture and God he's sending the word into your heart he want to change you he want you to become a Living Word fullan of Christ and God he needs you amen so pleases him and those that will will be blessed indeed are you prepared to to witness you prepared to do the thing you wants you to do yes prepar to live your live your NI at home with your wife properly or with your husband she she basic TRS that we we tend to ignore but they affect our lives spiritually so much and God he was well do you H your husband your wife you to Reverend that's what Bible tell you to do you men do you love your WV as yourself do you treat me we v g giv him honor because that affects your relationship with God and you men if you if you want you in spirit there one person that knows and that person can tell you it's your wife she sees how you are she knows if you're in the spirit because she sees you all the timey comy she sees it get up happy get up happy she sees it that's right and she knows exactly what what you do if you're in the spirit or In the Flesh and God wants you to not see your life wrong but realize that she is something precious for you to live with yes and these things affect relationship with the Lord yes and God wants you to have a good relationship with him he want he want you to be full of him that's my message I'm not I don't believe in to say what what he wants to say a few words I'll pray for you by me simple because I want go to so I want to ask you this evening if anyone here would like to say Lord you sp me this evening I want to walk in a better way with you lift your hand to the Lord anyone else anyone else let's pray precious father Lord

more you take control oh the more that I can humble the more you lift me up every day I live Lord I love you [Music] more amen surely God is good to us amen you know I really appreciate uh the brother yes and uh if you were listening or and could hear he was talking even some of the things that we've been ministering on being a witness amen and coming into the statue of a full uh statue of Christ amen and he talks about worship and praise and you know that's so true it doesn't matter how we scream and holling here if the life is not there is not true worship because you have to Worship the Lord and in spirit and in truth amen and so you know I thank God because he he went on into the uh personal things lives truly you know we we think that we could uh get away and we wonder you know about sometimes our relationship with God but often time our relationship with God determines on determine H is determined by our relationship with each other amen whether it be mother brother sister wife amen our action hinders God's actions amen is that right amen and as we said earlier amen that you know only Divine love is going to make it amen is that right only Divine love is going to make a Rapture amen now the Bible said that Paul said that he pressed toward the mark of a high calling which is in Christ Jesus amen so we understand it is op pressed is that right amen remember the other night I said in Revelations 3rd Chapter the invitation was to for gold to be tried in the fire and you said amen Lord amen I'll be willing to be tried in the fire so when the so if you believe your gold and you receive the invitation you're going to be tried amen and without fire amen character cannot be vulcanized it cannot be fused into one another Without fire Hallelujah Tri the Bible say don't even think it's strange when these things come upon you cuz the trying of your faith is more precious than gold we appreciate our brother amen and understand amen the one reason why I'm glad he's here because it's so easy for me to Stand and Deliver but when you see a man who's uh I want to say made whole but not manifested yet amen amen he stands and he delivers you know I have a God and I I love it that way because some of some of you may not have heard or understood him but you know the more you hearing the more your ear get Keen to what he's saying and uh by the grace of God I know that that some things were ministered to me you know because I realized by the grace of God I've asked God because one of the things I've been crying out for is perfection I know I got the potential in me amen I got the spirit of adoption amen but that spirit is to bring you there take you there Amen to you come to a place where God say hear ye him amen you understand me and you know I've asked the Lord I says Lord give me what I need and now I even know better now that I can't just handle you any kind of way you can't handle me any kind of way hello and I'm telling you these little things these little foxes these little things are the things that spoil the vine y'all hear what I'm saying it is what it is and so we think amen that we listen and and like you said without confession if you don't make it right hello You Hinder the process amen You Hinder the process of God building you making you into the very image of God like brother bradam said making you a living walking talking image amen Idol however you want to put it God in you and having that testimony that Paul had I no longer live but God lives in me it's Christ that lives I'm dead to myself and I love the one thing that God came to remind us of it's no longer you that sin but it's sin in your flesh your flesh is condemned sin is in your flesh hello your flesh don't it will never believe your flesh will never believe that's why God didn't stop at your flesh he had to go to your heart and guess what like brother random said it like this he said God did not come to P give you a patch up job he came to give you a total blood transfusion is that right take you take take all of the sinful stuff out of you and place himself in you and he said then if you got if you got Beethoven in you you can live like Beethoven you can play like Beethoven and if you got Jesus Christ on the inside you'll live like Jesus Christ you'll talk like Jesus Christ he'll think through your mind he'll speak through your lips he'll see through your eyes is that right amen there's now no condemnation to those who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit amen Amen brother we appreciate him amen and and uh you I told you didn't preach long yeah some of y'all y'all know how he said he don't do the long preaching but he know how I am I've been there by the grace of God so I I put it this way tomorrow night amen you come
