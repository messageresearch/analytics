TRANSCRIPT
========================================
you love the Lord we're not going to sing we're just going to go right into the word of God what a mighty God we serve amen glad to see you brother Marcus amen amen uh we're going to be coming from uh a couple of scriptures first of all let's go to Romans 4 and 20 Romans 4 and 20 oh my I am I am glad I'm one of them that's all I can say words cannot even express uh what I'm feeling right now here you go brother thank you sir yes sir yes sir amen I I I'm I'm I'm I'm thrilled I'm happy and uh I feel super amen Hallelujah that's my new word super so not just good I feel super amen Romans 4:20 we know who he's speaking of here he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to God Amen and being fully persuaded that what he had promised he was able also to perform and therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness now it was not written for his sake alone that it was imputed to him but was for us also to whom it shall be imputed if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our lord from the dead amen who was delivered for for our offenes and was arised again for our justification amen I love that I love that first John 54 1 John 5:4 for whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith let us pray Heavenly Father God we come before you Lord as humbly as we know how thanking you father for being so good to us you've been better to us Lord Jesus than we have been been to ourselves we thank you Father for your righteousness your Holiness and we thank you Father for all you have done for us bless this service in a special way and we'll be careful to give you the praise Glory and Honor in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated if I want to if I was to uh uh um entitled this message I would uh entitle it no place for reasoning how many of us really believe that uh brother brandom is uh Malachi 4 amen and how many of you believe that God spoke through the man I know this seems like simple questions but then you'll find out why I'm asking you things these questions in just a moment because we realize amen that we are resting upon brother brandham and what he taught us y'all understand what I'm saying when brother bham had that vision of going over uh beyond the curtain of time he said there were Millions upon Millions uh who screamed out after he said well I preached what Paul preached amen and they said we are resting on that now they didn't say we are hoping but they were there resting because they believe what he preached they wouldn't have been there in other words they were saying absolutely You Preach what Paul preached and that's the reason why we're resting amen see it wasn't a hope situation but it was but what they were doing was amening uh what he has said and I can say Amen too now the reason why I'm saying this because if I was to have a theme it would be wisdom versus Faith that's where I got the bulk of my message because I realized amen that if we're going to make a rapture we must take God at his word we can't add to it we can't take away we can't reason with it it is what it is now you see what brother what are you saying I'm saying until you really get a true revelation of what a prophet is you will never have the respect for the word of God in which he preached because amen you're going to look at them at at him as though it was a man speaking to you but you and I realized by Revelation it wasn't a man amen even though God it was a man physically a tabernacle brother brandham wasn't smart enough to bring us such a message and he would have told you that himself that's why God Amen chose a man who had just a seventh grade education to bring the message of God to us now you say why is it so important you'll find out in just a moment because if God sent us a message if we add to it we in trouble if we take away from it we're in trouble amen amen hello somebody now you're not going to see me up here uh uh acting like a parrot cuz I only preach those things that I has been revealed to to me but I want you to make sure that what I'm preaching comes from what he preached y'all hear what I'm saying so I want you to understand that here the Bible said that Abraham stared not at the promise of God through unbelief in the in other words there was no sin that he disbelieve God now Abraham did some natural things that took him out of the way way right places when God said don't go he went anyhow because of his natural man but when it came to really believing the promises of God the Bible said he he never staggered now God knows how to work his plan out in each and every one of our lives but I want to say tonight there's no place for reasoning and the reason why I can say that is because throughout my time period in this message I found myself reasoning every last one of us have done it only because we did not understand who was preaching oh come on somebody it's true and every time we reason with the prophet's message or with God's message through the prophet we find ourself in trouble come on come on come on now let me say it like this so you understand reasoning the kind I'm talking about is of the devil right because that was the first thing he did when it came to Eve he made her reason with the word as if the word was not plain enough and God brought us a plain word am he had to bring us a plain word because Isaiah said that there will be a way a way in a way and said it would be so simple the fol wouldn't air so God had to make it so simple that even the unlearned could understand what he was saying it is the intellectuals that makes us reason amen they want to and the way it was in in Noah's day with uh Moses day excuse me with daythan and cor you always have somebody who's going to try to interpret to us what the prophet meant and said come on now y'all y'all follow me just a minute because I really want you to understand that you and I must begin to take a different mental attitude toward what we're hearing and what we are reading otherwise you're going to find yourself [Music] reasoning with the things that you hear hello somebody oh it's true that's why the the what we call the message or the the the the the realm of the message that's why so many people don't have the Holy Ghost because they found themselves reasoning Amen brother made it plain and clear it's not difficult it's only when we begin to reason whether we have to go the measure that has been laid out for us right listen after the seals were open brother B preached the token he said that was the Capstone of his message hello he preached desperation and told you you got to get desperate to get it amen now you can reason within yourself but I believe the prophet was laid here brought here to open a entrance a way into and if if you fail to hear the voice listen because a lot of time people when when I say this we don't realize we're not listening to a man we're not listening on the tape to hear the sound of brother BR Brandon pitch and how high he go how low he go we're there to hear from God Amen and Jesus said my sheep heareth my voice and a stranger they will not follow amen wouldn't it be better to believe it like he said without trying to explain it because Revelation comes to those who can take it face value hello you got to take it face value before God can reveal it amen all you got to say is Lord I don't understand it and God says get all you're getting but get it with some understanding so you got a word to bring before God so he can give you understanding but if you don't believe in faith value oh that can't mean that just saying that put you in danger but to say Lord I don't understand that then you give God the space to bring Revelation into your heart hello somebody coming from the message wisdom versus faith and I'll be reading he says now if this is the word of God you believe it then why doubt any word of it any promise of it how can you say that this is part and this is no part and this is that pick out what you want you can't do it it's either all good or it's none of it good that's right so as soon as you see that it's it's the truth take a hold of it don't turn it loose no matter what circumstances how they try to reason don't do that at all stay right with it God promised it if I'm going now to take my stand for Christ he'll give me the Holy Spirit his Spirit Bears record of his life in me then when I come to die Satan's triy to say you see you didn't belong to an organization stay right with the word you didn't do this you didn't do that no matter what s Satan's got no reason about it it's God's word stay with the word see it cast down all reasoning amen so if we stay with the word we don't have to argue with Satan his reasoning makes no sense anyway I mean come on when you think about it if we take the word of God as God has laid it out come on somebody now I'm coming to something something because the word of God is Not of any private interpretation amen now it took me a long time to fully understand that but what it is I'll read it to you in just a moment brother brandom said God sends a prophet to interpret the word to you amen that means you don't have to worry about interpreting it it's already interpreted and if we don't follow the interpretation in which he brings we find our s reasoning and we find ourselves like Eve did falling short and finding death hello it is what it is I've done it I've I I've I've out of weaknesses out of out of feelings out of emotions out of caring out of but you know what it's like this each man is responsible because you're an eagle amen each one of you are responsible for coming to understand and knowing this word amen hello amen oh it's true anyhow you say you're an eagle now the Bible didn't say all pastors take that little book and eat it no John represented the bride amen and the bride supposed to have an appetite for the word amen amen huh God gave her an appetite for the word and he tells us to eat it can you imagine eating something and you're not hungry for it that's miserable right I can remember when I was a boy my babysitter used to make me eat Harmony grits I hated it yesterday to day in forever and it's like that you don't want to eat something that you're not hungry for but the Bride of Jesus Christ is hungry you know what she's hungry for her identity amen right that's what brother B said he said basically she was among the chickens she heard the eager scream all along she was confused about why she was so different from everybody else but then when she heard the word she heard the scream of the eagle it gave her a identity and one of the first things Mama eager told the baby eaglet fly you are not Earthbound and you got no business out there fellowshipping with the chickens y'all hear what I'm saying so a eagle supposed to know how to fly know how to catch the wind and know how to know what is thus sayeth the Lord amen you don't know know how blessed you are to be able to see that God sent a prophet if the people in Noah's day would have known who he really was it would have been an overload but they didn't recognize him they they didn't they failed to see that it was God behind that human flesh and guess what they didn't understand that that Noah was the voice of God to that generation come on somebody you don't think God knows what he says and you don't think he understand what he means when God says something that's what he said he can't turn back from his word cuz he's perfect amen there's a lot of Grace given to us but people if we ever go come to the place to change what he says to meet our convenience we are are in trouble is that all right now we're at a place let's turn to Ezra real quick because this this this message brings an anointing did y'all know that it brings an anointing and uh I had it it brings an anointing and you and I must understand that we supposed to be under that anointing right God just don't cause you to do something without giving you something I'm sorry Ezra 15 please it says then rose up the CH and this is when God was getting ready to lay the foundation uh the king uh of Persia had already given them word that they can go and you know uh lay the foundation go back to Jerusalem build the thing up you know it got frustrated a many times but listen in the fifth verse it says then rose up the chief of the fathers of Judah and Benjamin and the priest and the Levites with all of them whose Spirit God had raised to go up to build the house of the Lord which is in Jerusalem God Anointed The People come on somebody now the pastor has no business trying to beg people among us beg you to do something for God there's supposed to be an anointing with you as it is with him right I don't think Luther had to beg nobody Wesley didn't have to beg anyone right those people heard the word they fell under that anointing and it was off nobody had to beg Pentecostals Amen to sible themselves listen it's the truth they fell under that anointing and they were off well we were in The Bride age amen this is supposed to be a super age amen where everything is super is that right he preached the message on super right and this is supposed to be a super age where's the Super it's here yes he God left it here amen but you must enter into it it doesn't matter whether it's just a small group of people it doesn't take but one man to get in the hand of God and he he becomes a giant slayer but what it is we are in an age of intellectuals and don't get me wrong I don't have nothing with nothing uh no problem with people who have who are intelligent and smart brother B and God is working with the people who allow their intellect to to to deny the word but it's a good thing to have a good memory anybody know what I'm talking about it's a good thing to be able to comprehend and recall you know and there's nothing wrong with that but the problem is sometimes people allow their human ability to to recall they mistaken it as the Holy Ghost amen and there's a lot of preachers like that hello somebody a lot of preachers are that way where they think because they can recall hello somebody I want you to understand the devil can recall too matter of fact brother brandham said that the devil believe the word says He believe he trembles come on somebody so what I'm working with here is so that you can understand that we are approaching a serious hour one word disbelief you missed the Rapture it was one word disbelief that plunged us into this mess amen one word disbelieve it plunges you it takes you out of the Rapture y'all hear what I'm saying amen so this is not a time for reasoning if we reason here we will reason there and this is Satan's wisdom reason now there's a reasoning of God come let us reason together [Laughter] though your sin be Scarlet I'll make them whiter than snow in other words in God's reasoning you benefit sir you come to understand God is right and you're wrong amen God is Holy and you filthy that was the reasoning to know who are you stand with God but it comes along says but I'll make you white as snow amen is that all right overcome the world what overcometh the world those who are born of God overcometh the world how by what faith and what is faith faith is revelation faith is revelation faith is understanding uh your day and his message this message came to do what prepare a people for a Rapture greater than that to prepare a people for a wedding greater than that to make sure those who are prepared for the wedding you get to marry right Hallelujah is that right Paul said I would love in the 11th chapter Corinthians I want to present you as a Chase version unto the Lord he said but I feel Les at some point in time you will allow Satan to seduce you or begal you even as he did unto Eve so you got to realize that same spirit is Among Us now right it doesn't take much it it it doesn't take much it's like like the Galatians did you know we still should have a circumcision that's all it takes circumcision used to be a part of the ordinances of of Israel and that's all we need to do uh you know we we need the circum no you don't Paul said he said by doing that you make the word of God a none of act think about all of the people Amen in this message who don't even believe in taking communion no more they don't take it because they said he's here well he was here ever since all the time right amen hallelujah he just made himself known in 1963 because some things were happening come on if he wasn't here Luther wouldn't have been able to do what he was doing W than none of them but in 1963 the full word came amen and they said well he's here and that's part of the perusia doctor which is okay he is here his presence is here but my point is this brother brandham still kept communion even up to his death so was he wrong but he was the one who knew he was here before anybody else did y'all hear what I'm saying but you see people get in listen just like I heard a brother say if you going to take away communion take away the tithing too right because when when MDC met amen uh uh Abraham Abraham had communion and he paid tithing so if you going to do away with the communion do away the tiing too I guarantee those preachers don't want to do that see but it does doesn't take much Amen to get away and offer the word of God I have been guilty but I have repented thank you Lord praise the Lord every time I read something I hear something I see where I'm wrong I'm repenting I don't have a kingdom to put nobody [Applause] in and I myself you know I got to deal with me right I got to deal with me just this and at the same time I'm accountable for you amen amen hello is that the word that's the word amen coming from another quote wisdom versus faith and he call takes us to St John 10 1-5 verily verily I say unto you he that enter not by the door into the sheep fold but climbing up some other way the same is a thief and a robber what is a thief and a robber somebody that comes to take something that's not there right and then if you ain't been born again if you don't have he said if you hadn't come through the door you're a thief and a Rob him you eating and taking bread that ain't even yours amen but he that entered by the door is The Shepherd of the sheep right to him the portal open and the Sheep hears voice and he calls his own Sheep by name and leadth them out out and when he put forth his own sheep he goth before them and the Sheep followeth him for they know his Voice come on somebody so what happens when the word of God comes and the Holy Spirit is here and the Holy Ghost is preaching and he's preaching and he's preaching and there's no result something's wrong with the sheep or something's wrong with the voice because he said my sheep Hearth my voice he he said and when they hear my voice they follow it brother BR preach the message hearing and acting upon the word of God you don't come just to hear once you come and hear his voice he's talking to you on a daily basis they well you know the Lord ain't talked to me in a long time where when the last time you've been the church he talks to me before church in between church after church but you know what a lot of time people don't realize it's God talking to him like right now amen amen am amen a stranger they will not follow but will flee from him for they know not the voice of strangers and don't you know it is so true God didn't leave you know when brother Brandon went off to scene he didn't leave us with nothing he made it difficult for us he let all of the isms and the schisms come in hello somebody when I got here they had all kind of camps already come on somebody amen but thank God for the books and the tapes right because and thank God for the genuine Holy Ghost because that is the the Holy Ghost going to say Amen to the word but when it's not the word the Holy Ghost ain't going to amen it right and it's so many times you say what do you mean now we've got the voice of the bridegroom oh Lord have mercy hello we we're not working amen with with the with the preacher we're working with the voice of the bridegroom hello the preacher done basically step back because he done ask you all of the things you need to be asked do you take this one to be your awfully wet you you take this one and you done say I do Hallelujah amen and when he said now you can kiss the bride he he now lets everybody know this is Mr and mes the preacher ain't got nothing else to do with it then it's between the wife and the husband that's how it is right now Hallelujah hello you understand me so we look at this thing and the word of God says listen that's why I thank God when God really showed me how brother bam when he came here he says listen I didn't come to start a denomination or organization I came to make an entrance I came to bring the bride amen into that perfect statue I'm like there it is it's right there in Peter Peter prophesied he said there come he said for entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the Everlasting Kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and we still got people in the message who look at Peter at the and you know at your faith virtue knowledge Temperance and they don't even stud about it it don't even move them they don't even think about it it's constantly on my mind it's constantly on my heart amen when I fall short of imp patience Lord help me come on somebody what have I do wrong I'm examining myself to see where I am up the ladder come onuh because it is those people listen if you still fighting and and and and and and and and and battling where whether I'm going to make a Rapture or even whether I'm saved Peter said the virtues there are not in you amen and Satan has brought you to a place where you forgot you were saved he ain't saying you're not saved but he's saying like the brother said last week you're neglecting your salvation amen add to your faith virtue knowledge Temperance all of these things must be found in you because God is coming for a mature bride amen well brother I can't do it all you got to do is get the life in you and he'll do the rest he's the masonry amen he's the brick M he's the one that's laying the bricks right just like I heard that brother say that's right it's nothing but the truth and when when Ezra then was building the wall he said hey I got a sword in one hand and a brick in the other give me another brick Hallelujah amen so you got to realize amen you're going to be fighting at the same time you laying another brick brick upon brick right virtue upon virtue but you be fighting with one hand and building the house with the other that's the way it works but they were anointed to do it anointed the Bible said the cares of this life is the thing that chokes it out of you amen H caring about too much stuff amen oh Lord am I going to make it what are you talking about the Bible said you already made it you made it in his mind you're just here to walk it walk through it amen like I've also told told you many times brother brandom saw Millions I don't know how far he went in time million upon million but something's wrong with your faith and you can't say I'm one of them all them folks and you can't see yourself there I say wait a minute the Rapture can't even take place the translation can't take place till I'm ready honestly folks I don't mean to count you out but every day I say I'm that one amen you got to have that for yourself oh Lord have mercy Lord no think about it was the the Bible said interest is ministered but listen to what Psalms 19 19 and 130 119 130 says the ENT the entrance of Thy word giveth light giveth understanding unto the simple it says listen it it gives Enlightenment and it look down and and another meaningful it gives fire it giveth fire and it giveth understanding to the simple it's like a Daybreak amen right it gives understanding to what the simple for those who can be taught those who can be taught amen I don't mind being called Simple I'm simple enough to follow this now look at this statement because I'm I'm telling you we can look at these things and think that that it doesn't mean anything like somebody like I heard brother Bram said it like this he said you can sit with somebody who's a worldly friend and and they're drinking and you saying that ain't going to bother you he said yes it will there's nothing you could be drinking Kool-Aid and they could be drinking wine he said that will spiritually bother you you may not know it at the time but it going to catch up with you why you're entertaining you're fellowshipping with Darkness hello now think about this Abraham uh the people in Moses they could say wait a minute wait a minute Moses you know Abraham told us nothing about slaying a lamb and put the blood on POR in little but Abraham had gone on to be with God it was Moses who was divorced for that day hello they said we can't even see this in our rituals in our regular church services we've never had such a thing happen like this but Moses could say to them yes that is true but this is not Abraham's day amen hello this is this is we know we sacrificed land but I'm trying to get you a greater revelation of what the lamb is all about this lamb is not just slaying for some type of ritual but this lamb is declaring your deliverance this lamb is declaring your healing this lamb is setting you free from bondage and if you reject this lamb you dieen and to reject the bloody bleeding word of the message you die is the Lamb of God oh help us Lord amen St John 8:24 Jesus said unto them that ye shall die in your sins for if you believe not that I am he you shall die in your sins that's it we've got so many people who walking away from this and not understanding they're not walking away from a man in his theology they're literally walking away from the ark that Noah had amen or walking away from the instructions of putting the blood on the door Post in L come on somebody it's the same thing this man wasn't just a man he was born to bring a bride to Jesus Christ and he was the only one that could interpret the word amen because he wasn't The Interpreter it was the one who read who wrote it he was the one who was interpreting it it was so in every age God revealed himself by way of the son of man is that right and those people who did not believe Noah Jesus went and preached to them where were they their souls were in prison I just read the other day how uh here was a man who I forgot the name of the man but here was a Christian a old fellow who preached the word and loved God so much and there was another fellow who was a drunker who was a drunker and he he was a friend of brother bram's Daddy and when this man came to die brother brandham said he fought demons for four hours or more fought demons and he was calling on brother brandom's daddy Charlie Charlie don't let them put those chains on me Charlie don't let them put those chains on me now he was the one who said God didn't exist he was the one that thought Christianity was just foolish you hear what I'm saying now I'm saying these things to you folks to if I can disturb you a little bit don't you understand amen the Bible said if we add one word the plagues will be added to you that mean you going to miss the Rapture and if we take it out he said your name will be taken out of the Book of Life yeah that means you're dead amen you know why I'm saying preaching like this because God has instructed me to do so and not only that I have seen my erroring ways and I know that I am repenting come on and you need to too what is it I allow my reasoning to get in now there's a lot of things that I'm speaking of and you have no idea what I'm talking about some yesterday today and tomorrow hadn't come yet but tomorrow will be different why because I'm looking at it in a different way that's all I'm saying as he revealed it to me as he show it to me I'll show it to you but I really believe with all of my heart and and don't get me wrong you're not going to see me straining at a KN and swalling a camel but my point is amen we there's certain things and things that we wrestle with and have wrestle with amen that God said it's it is what it is and we've got to fall back and come into saying yes Lord there is no other way but God's way wisdom tries to point us out say oh well now you know we couldn't do that do that in this time we must do it anyhow see tries to find an easy way tries to make the Bible say things that it does not say now you say oh brother brandom wait just a moment we'll go back to the seat again what was it the devil tried to do with wisdom make God word say something that it didn't say that's where we fall into trouble when we make God's word say something that he didn't say now my thing is this we're going to either follow God with all of our hearts amen or we're not going to follow him at all you're wasting your time y'all hear what I'm saying now let me say it like this Abraham believed God but he didn't doesn't mean it doesn't show where he didn't make mistakes he still made mistakes but he never doubted the word that's what I'm talking about you gon to make you this is this this is death right here right here you see this thing that's death you play with him he kills you it's the TRU you play with him he kills you like like the brother said I thought I was the only one only Revelation I thought I had that by I thought it was something really person when he said lot is always with you your flesh is lot until you get rid of lot separate yourself from lot amen Paul had to do it amen Paul said listen lot he said you doing these things not me amenallah he said this is the flesh doing these things that's not me I'm separated from that I'm the inner man that's speaking here hallah there's no condemnation to those who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit is that okay now I'm working with these things so that you can understand that we're now approaching a real serious season and I wouldn't be saying these things if I didn't know it was sure but I'm going tell you something people nobody in this room can tell me that we're not ready and about ready to brace a Rapture I have I have I have either that I'm getting ready to go home something's happening with me that's all I'm telling you something Supernatural is happening to me it's either the Rapture of God's going to call my name that's all I'm telling you and that's the only thing I can tell you I'm the Watchman y'all not standing where I'm I'm standing I'm up in the tower folks come on somebody I'm a Watchman and when I see the enemy coming God anoints me to see it I don't just see it on my own I don't have eyes to see like that but God anoints my eyes to see and I can see a far off and says hey the enemy is coming hello you know brother BR said you know a sheep don't it doesn't have that mechanism within themselves to know when the enemy is around you know they just that's why they such easy pre they so dumb that's why it takes a Shepherd to spy out the wolf or to spy out any kind of lion or anything that's that's approaching because the Sheep is so dumb probably wouldn't even know which way to run amen so it takes a Shepherd Amen to see that Wolf coming to defend the Sheep cuz this the Sheep has no defense mechanism amen well I'm going to hurt you with my wool it ain't happening it has nothing it's just soft from inside out come on somebody the goat now is something different the goat has a a mechanism right it knows how to butt you oh I believe the word butt yeah I believe what you just said but you know that's the wrong nature to have reasoning now God is too good listen what he says in wisdom versus faith God is too good God's too merciful he loves you too much you hear that same old devil today God's too good to do this God won't do this God won't punish he'll do just exactly what what he his word said he'll do ye shall not surely Li see what the he's trying to do is getting her to reason with him in a minute that you reason on God's word then you are losing faith see don't have no yes he said don't have no yes NOS maybe so stay right with it see Eve had the right approach but she listened to his reasoning there's just so many people today that has the right knowledge that knows uh knows that this word should be God's word and it is God's word but they stand and let some Seminary Student reason them out of it away from the holy spirit away from the things of God reasoning will cast excuse me reasoning will to cast them down right but I'm going to tell you why Satan said I I read the fourth verse uh first and the fifth one and the serpent said unto woman ye shall not surely die for God knoweth that in the day that you eat thereof then your eyes shall be open and you shall be as Gods knowing good and evil from evil see he's giving her a reason wouldn't you like to be equal with God see and that's the point is you know the point the point is listen God has already established your place you can't be no more than what God has established you to be if you try to get out of what God has establish you to be then you get in trouble amen come on somebody I'm not going to be long tonight because this is this is just something I want to lay out and Sunday I'll finish it off you know I I I I don't know how good it's going to be but it'll be real it'll be God I tell you that but let me say it like this when we look at this thing and it's so true I'm going off something brother uh uh uh uh Jason said to me which is so true and I can't remember whether he said it in his message or not but he said this if you prayed for and you have to wait for a good feeling to know that you healed he said that is like a slap in God's face amen amen because just as sure as the good feeling comes a bad one's coming and if you base your healing off a good feeling you going to base losing your healing off the bad feeling amen hello somebody is that right he said you don't wait to feel good he said you get healed because you believe God's word amen if the feeling come praise God if the feeling don't come but I'm Healed because God's word says so right you see what you I thought oh my God how many times we've done that amen I know I'm not by myself we wait to feel good to say well I know he's you know and we ask somebody are you feeling better see what I'm saying feeling ain't got nothing to do with it amen and we we actually uh we actually pushes that thing as if we we must feel good to to to be here John Ryan H you can't see but you told me I was here he said but you told me you believed go testify of your healing Hallelujah whether you can see or Not by faith I can see that's the thing we base it upon feelings and listen that in itself is not the way brother brandom taught it amen he said go on believing and God will heal you not whether I feel it or can you see a little bit of sight can you see a little bit now hallelujah oh oh help us Lord Jesus it's know his word says so amen Abraham had no signs of having a baby for 25 years and he staggered not at the promise of God brother brand they got their little room together and their little booties and everything else set it all up no matter what people said and that's the way you got to treat them demons you going out of here if you didn't go today you going tomorrow amen and ah why cuz I'm not going to doubt I'm going to hold fast to the thing cuz God said so and the word is God whether I feel it or not if I feel bad maybe feel worse than I have that means nothing to me cuz God said you got to go there's one thing I tell you what and I didn't tell brother Keith this but this is the truth brother Keith lost his Bible the other day I don't remember saying this but he was telling me about it and somebody took it and everything else and I first thought I saidwell Lord I said that fell that stole that brother's car and brother brandham prayed and they said they sealed it sealed it the prayer in the name of Jesus Christ y'all hear what I'm saying it's like a Roman seal boom when you seal it show show this to them and they got to release it huh y'all hear what I'm saying and I prayed I said Lord whoever took it make them bring it back now I didn't tell him that he was praying his own prayer but that's the way I was praying and then he comes along and he tells me that I wasn't surprised no sir because I knew that God was going to bring it back I it was some feeling you know now I ain't going to go off feeling but it was it was a real good feeling then brother Keith said he had a piece about it just using him now my point is I said when it when you really like I said faith has long distance amen right the prophet of God said I'm going to kill a a Grizzly a big bear today a silver tip and he had this man who God done done already showed him what he can do and he's just kept were you sure brother R are you sure now we we're just here this is not even a place where those Bears be are you sure thought the devil was you God allowed it God was allowing that man to try to penetrate the brother Brandon's faith and God allows Satan to try to penetrate your faith when you said it's mine the devil has a right to come back and make you try to make you doubt it's a Warfare and it all depends on who you listen to Amen brother I don't I don't care if a God can create one amen amen hallelujah hallelujah God can create it amen he said I think he said uh if if a gly bear show up I think I'm going to die he said but you might as well start dying now Hallelujah that is the way Faith speaks regardless to What SAT says all right I'm going read this quote and I'm going to let you go I'm not going to stay long tonight but here I want to say it this this way because uh I just want to say people of God I want you to go and think about all of the things that you've heard brother brandham say that you disagree with you may not even know you disagree with it but your actions may show up hello and then you need to say Lord I Repent whether I'm right I being right is nothing to me I I don't care about that now I I'm at a place right now I you know how can I say it I know that every test and trial that comes my way is for me if God put me up into a place where I've got to make any kind of decision he put me there amen and he's expecting me to make the right decision amen have I always made the right decision no have you ever always made the right decision but now it's time to do something amen because when you got instructions how can I how can I say it okay let's put it this way if you had instructions and this in in this book it says you know basic steps on how to love simple right and you find yourself coming short you say oh oh let me turn back to the basic steps that I might see what I'm doing wrong and how to correct it right so that's what I'm saying you need to look through back through your word and say it's okay because I'm I'm saying this now so you can understand the message came to us that we would be without spot or blemish if you fail to follow the instruction you going to come up with a blemish or a spot amen so it's there to bring us to a place where we will be presented without a spot or blemish am I making sense oh the re right midle he says you ain't got no thought coming listen he said gut connect with Christ Our Lives of Our Lives of our emotions the lives of our mind connected in in him you you see you you ain't got no thought coming and that's right you say I think this you haven't got a thought I haven't either the Bible said let the mind that was in Christ be in you and he was always about the father's business so that's the only thought you ought to have what God said about it not what somebody else said but what God said that's all there is to it woo that's a stinger but it's real I don't know whether you want to make a Rapture but I do amen that's what I'm here about and my thing is think about things that we might hold on to amen that means nothing because everybody's got their opinion and that's the point when it comes to this message you're not supposed to have your opinion amen if there's things there's things I I I I've heard brother B say I don't understand I've even searched scripture and I can't understand it still so I don't preach it but I don't disbelieve it amen because I'm going to tell you something I'm not a prophet as such I didn't come to interpret the word I came to preach the word that's been interpreted amen that's what I'm here for that's what I'm here for he said remember this never forget it the right mental attitude toward any promise of God will bring it to pass the right mental attitude toward any promise of God it doesn't take Gifts of healing to heal sick people any person in here has a right to meet Satan anywhere if you're a Christian and defeat him on any ground that he could stand on amen hello but you know that's what we do sometime we all have this so-called Catholic spirit and we want to put a man higher than the other there ain't never one man that's high and that's Jesus Christ and if we are high it's because our lives are HID in him y'all hear what I'm saying now I don't mean no harm people but I put it this way way I ain't resting on none of y'all faith I got my own in times of trouble where are you amen y'all understand what I'm saying you can't rest on mine you got to get your amen amen you got to get your own you got to know that God is in you amen well I'm in trouble you know you know it's it's the truth this ain't something some like like some kind of day gone where you got a statue and you can't get to your statue God want to be in you so wherever you go wherever what kind of trouble wherever anytime anywhere any place he's always there with you and you ought to know it by now am amen right you ought to know it by now and if this is the word of God then it is just as infinite as God is see there you are you must have faith in the word that's the only way it'll work and God's word is seed and you Farmers here you know if you put a seed in the ground and take care of it right if it's in the right kind of ground it'll produce what the seed is amen so the work ain't even yours it's all about the seed life living in through you amen am it making sense amen we are the abners we are the people like Mary be it unto me according to your word all right if God called for a total separation I don't believe he meant this I don't believe he meant that God said he couldn't even bless Abraham till he separation himself from life God can't even fully bless you till you separate yourself from your flesh amen not like he want to he blessed Abraham but he couldn't give him the fullness of it why you know why because I'm going tell you something Abraham flesh was the thing that got him in trouble all the time but when Abraham was willing to die to everything and he showed by way of of of of Isaac because Isaac was his prolong in other words first Isaac was the seed that was to come after him that was to bring more seed that was come after him so if Abraham was able to give up Isaac that means when Abraham died there was none that was gonna be like Abraham amen if he had to kill Isaac amen y'all hear what I'm saying but he was willing to give it up why Isaac was basically in in like figure showing Abraham that Abraham's nature had changed he was no longer a a a goat he had become a lamb and he was willing to lay his own life as out down for a sacrifice and God said Abraham I know you love me now see that's what I'm saying God don't even really know he you love him until you willing to lay down your life am as a sacrifice amen your life as a sacrifice when you give your life up then God will say I know you love me now amen I know you love me that's stand it's amazing Peter said well Lord you know I love you I love I love you Lord you know he said if you love me Peter feed my sheep feed my sheep feed my l in other words Peter this is your job when you do this and not think about yourself for however the case may be Peter love me and and and and you know and that's how we love God by loving each other there ain't no way you can say you love God and and got a problem with me you know I just I say it like this by the grace of God people is and I wish I could God will give me Grace because there's a lot of things that I have to bring even clearer and plainer but this is just a a foundation of what I where we're going with this because I want I want every one of us to know you know uh God didn't make a mistake when he sent Elijah to us and there are some human elements in in in the message we're not talking about those things but we're talking about the word right now y'all hear what I'm saying we're talking about the word we you know brother bham gave us some illustrations of when he was a young man you know how he was able to kill was going to kill or shoot and you know we're not talking about that that that has not nothing to do with your salvation those were things that God allowed him to tell us so that you could know he was a man y'all hear what I'm saying he told us those things and you know uh it's the truth I didn't get to it but brother man even comes to a place he said forget about the messenger he said I'm not the messenger he said the Holy Ghost is y'all hear what I'm saying you know we're not here to to worship the the man you know what I'm putting up here y'all might see brother Brandon I'm putting up the pillar of fire to me that's what the picture is the picture is a pill of fire see you know and the reason why I felt like I feel I can't even explain it but you'll see a change you'll see a difference not because of the picture but because of obedience but my point is this you're going to really see listen if the children of Israel now come on out of all the generations we're the last God takes his picture and you don't want to show it off am I making making sense you know I'm telling you when I make a good picture I like to show it up y'all you what I'm saying and here God takes it but I mean it's the right attitude toward it you know we're not we're not worshiping a serpent you know on the pole we know what delivered us the Living God the almighty God Amen but God thought so much of us that he gives us a glimpse of himself more than a glimpse he places his faith in the cloud and then he shoots and gives us a pillar of fire and there's no way oh my like I put it this way if that many people made it to Heaven resting on what he's taught I'm going to rest on it too am that's all I'm going tell you I'm going to rest on it too if that many people made it because they rested on what he preached and taught I'm going to rest on it too you love God let's pray Heavenly Father God we come before you we thank you for your grace and your mercy Lord You're So Beautiful to us and your word it's so simple and so powerful Lord You Are God that changeed not that's what your word say Lord and father we just thank you for just giving us Grace to kind of lay out this uh uh uh uh word tonight uh by your help and by your grace I I pray something was said to stir up the minds and the conscience because our opinion about anything means nothing it's all about what you have said and declared in this day is what we are concerned about father God I pray that you would bless our hearts
