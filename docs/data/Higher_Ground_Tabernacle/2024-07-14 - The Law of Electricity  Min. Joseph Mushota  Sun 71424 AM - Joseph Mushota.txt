jump there you know I'm not those kind of preacher you too much no we we like David yeah he's a king but in the front of the Lord he can dance and just down down there until his wife said what you a king be couldn't give babies you know when God is in the move be careful don't if you don't understand keep quiet if you don't understand keep quiet because God always use always work in a neutral way they they were expecting him to come like a king there he come in the that's small baby he become poor for me and you to be rich Hallelujah be positive I you know I I I like the the way this song is

put me aside Lord I'm not a preacher I'm just a channel you come and preach to us Lord you know the need of your children preach to me preach to them preach to all of us oh God in Jesus Christ name amen amen May thank you God bless you richly once more again so the songs even last time that brother was here was on fire I love that one you gave us uh easier way you don't struggle to to break through yeah because most of the time preaching is not about reading and ques it's like a relationship yeah friendship connection that's why sometimes I can make my notes and I can be off notes and until we finish yeah don't just stick but sometimes when they so they call you you feel like something is burning in your heart you start with that one is in your heart but always be very attentive to the spirit when you start to take me to the right I just follow the flow and and we continue God bless you richly you can stand up we pray already you can read the scripture we pray already okay let us read in ecclesiast 12 chapter 12 verse 13 and 14 okay I'm reading let us hear the conclusion of the whole Mar fear God and keep his commandment for this is the whole duty of man [Music] H for God shall bring every word in into judgment with every secret thing whether it be good or whether it be evil oh I'm lost it's okay okay maybe sit yeah God bless you richly so uh my SM out this morning is but I told you already most of the time I don't stick on my not I'm not that's not sticker but this these things it's it's a burning in my heart uh for a certain time uh uh I was just meditating upon the word for the elders they they they received the message when we were very young some they were not yet born oh sometimes I S to realize that sometimes why somebody can stay so so long in the message then there's no change it start to bothering me so much some the ERS 40 years 30 something some young young people I can understand sometimes yeah they just come you know they hot hot you know but Elders at least when you stay long under the atmosphere of the word what what change must come even if a hand when he just want the the cheeks to come up hand hand cheeks to come up is I just sleep on the legs for the cheeks [Music] he he need a certain atmosphere and as long as those eggs is under atmosphere the life will come up so I I was just crying and praying I just tried to see how brother Bram start the ministry and I tried to check what was a burden in brother didn't have 3,000 4,000 Church Believers in this church and if you notice the ministry of babam was very successful out of United States he talk about 30,000 thousand overse but here and the Pentecost Church they start to use his ministry just to feed their churches Miracles as Believers we can't run for the Miracles now some people they've been deceived because of they've got gift of you can't measure a preacher about the gift of healing you measure a preacher by the by the the word of God am when you have a gift of healing 100 can get healed 300 but if if there is no life that's there is confusion but this message came to bring life if there is no life we question what make me to study so much I'm an evangelist but you bear with me a little bit teach a little bit God send me to uh the job I'm doing now those are successful people in what we are doing today they succeed by using only principle of your God put upon the Earth and you supposed to be better than them because you is the father your God your father create the universe put principle come on now clap the hand for the Lord so that's what I I I was confused someone was a smoker proud all those stuff but only using the principle and he changed he become a better person honest but when you enter in the Assembly of the message we don't know who to trust today it can jump scream good nice but put the money on the table the eyes become red hey brother is not your mind it's not your money I know I'm going to give back so it start to eing me I start to study the word and pray so I realized that there is one thing a big thing missing in many assemblies you know let us let us not first point to the holy spirit because Holy Spirit become like a song it become like a song yes and preacher when you said you don't have the Holy Spirit you are not you can be let's speak about the seal because there is baptism in the seal yeah the same genuine Holy Spirit it can baptize you around in your spirit yeah and we are talking about the same genuine but in the soul that's way things change yeah when you said uh brother you need the baptism of the Holy Spirit I'm going to brother me I'm a preacher don't play with me and espe preacher will very proud is us we are sending the people in the bush it's us because us we have a microphone and you have only speaker you can't ask there I can when we give me two hours all whatever one hour I'm going to just say it no one going to answer me there so that's why sometimes sometimes a lot of peoplee they don't like me I preach against us if you are not okay ah we we don't protect there everybody we must we must receive the spirit the soul change Pig nature to be a lamb that's about the message you will never understand this message until the genuine Holy Spirit enter in your soul is not about explaining and memorizing and the quotations and quotations people they start to make a quotation they fighting one is like is fighting against my attitude even the one who believe Bram God if he just read brother Bram and I'm reading also in my side because he must not drop that quotation okay me also I found it let us read brother and it's okay I say Amen first I swallow first it's brother Bram and I I turn to him you don't understand now when you you start to reject already the fight you you you mess up the atmosphere you will never change a Bram God to believe something else is a strong demon they're very excited I said brother is a prophet I love everything he said before he finish a sentence I say amen amen that's the I believe the prophet that's why when they say is God you is Christ when they you are Christ he didn't say you are wrong they are not far away they were very close why because you can't say no because because to see God you have to see God in the man if you miss God in the man you also you can't have God God that's why life it's it's from the body to the body that's why God sent philli he didn't send the angel you need a body [Applause] wow let me read I don't know how how many hours how many hours four hours look at you don't worry I don't CL hand for the Lord hallelujah I'm a little bit nervous I don't I'm already out of my subject but it's let me just read a little bit uh let us read in um what is the Holy Ghost uh hey let me give the date yeah just give him the date then project yeah paragraph Good okay look at look at the uh them lights when Benjamin Franklin CAU it [Music] he said I got it he didn't know what he had but he had it and I I want somebody to tell me tonight what electricity is we're just talking about electricity this morning they don't know yet what is but we got it that's right there is no man knows what electricity is they can Hest it make it light make it burn make it act it's generated by generators gener okay two pieces running together like that it's produced that and all they know it will give light and it's got power in it I love the prophet when the prophet start to speak about electricity is more than you know and they explained that he said they don't know and them they thought they know he said they don't have electricity but they know how to to make it happen and that's like the spirit of God you get one piece is you and the other piece is God yes hallelujah hallelujah and get them running around together like that it will go something for you that's right it will give light to give power you don't know what it is and never will know what it is but you know when you got it that's one thing being sure and it's for you it's yours the Assurance that's right what does that light show there is Assurance it's the light now notice this that you don't know what it oh I love this you can't explain the Holy Spirit amen but you know you have it two pieces you know butam was trying to correct the science they can give some words but a certain level they can't be like us as we are very high I discover something God is in the physics God is the nature God is in the color God is in the number for the Lord amen [Applause] amen you can you can take two stones you just uh uh brush them even there is it's raining you going to get the fire hallelujah hallelujah but they can't explain why praise the Lord yeah just bear with me it's I don't know I don't know I can drop this I don't know I don't know I'll try it's a long teaching but pick up pick up we see how God going to help us this called electromagnetic there cannot be magnetism without there being electricity these two Force work together because magnetism work with electricity this is the second Force discover when they discover the force of gravity and people didn't understand that in gravity there was the magnetic and electron I love this praise the Lord hallelujah there are two forces in force gravity there is strong force and a weak Force strong force act as a glue to put things together which for this one causes this to break down into [Music] radioactivity now Albert inin that's why it's soting who can correct alberstein hallelujah hallelujah there he was trying to find a formula to put together but butam said science they are going in the wrong way praise the Lord because one is in one another this one is in this one in this one until today they still searching they never found it until they recognize the one who created the Lord and do you know that what produce the electricity let us go is is a Dynamo yeah D the Dynam correct a dyn okay let us go the vision Africa that's the day to give them 53 someone okay okay then he went away again I started rejoicing there and was a real happy and just then here he he come again and the take away listen close now have your paper [Music] ready but when he comes this time he set me down in the dean meeting geographically Geographic I was looking just the way the de was looking [Music] South I was in the in the north and there was a great Duran meeting just the same meeting and I noticed that the meeting begin to turn blue I stop first there this blue is not a blue color I don't know put it it start to get so big you know the prayer start to move fire dancing it start to take another level and that's why I I stopped there because this is it's turning blue it's not the blue color praise the Lord raise up off the ground the people and FedEd away toward the west now I I talk slow now so the people can get it and is is is written is is written faded toward the worst and the just then I look in the front of me again this this way it was toward the South and there was aing greater than the other one was and there there was beautiful people men and the women with their hand up praising God and I said are all white people I stopped there but those people they were so beautiful and handsome and he asked they all white and I look at and I see the Africans the Great Dark race standing in there and just then I heard something going just making a real humming noise like a Dy running for the Lord so you know what don't miss when this this message is taking a corner or is taking a left or right drop what you are thinking it's not what you think is what God is doing so God got his own way of doing things butam saw himself in the South and he said that Maring is is a bigger than a death and the noise what a d praise the Lord so you know as we are privileged because we have a prophet and the prophet is clear it God couldn't take off Bram if the Big Dam was not on I'm going there we're going slowly I I'll jump but to drop something because the D produce the electricity and the way in the miring praise the Lord you know when Samson lost eyes they cut his hair it's like there is no prophet in the camp and the eyes represent a prophet and the body is a church when there is no Prophet people they just trying can read the same Bible but they don't understand the difference between this Pentecostal denomination because as we have a prophet will we are sitting here it's because we have a William Mar I love to say that because there's some people that don't want to hear that name that's why why they going to St in the sins you have to recognize your time and your Prophet stand at your position Jesus at his position then God will come God will never work out of his Prophet the MTH of God is Willam Mar we are going to stand this message and if we we stand you don't know the secret even financially St of the Prophet you going to have money who told you if you believe the message you be poor and miserable give anything you need in this message you it but there is a rules there is a principle that's why I'm trying to drop this because I found this unbeliever they just apply principle they become good people they become billionaire I don't understand I say God what's missing in us this Spirit of fire is very high level there is no one can be more than that now understand now when one brother was working with another brother in South Africa no that was not a brother it was just those people they believe in a lodge he enter his office he saw that pill of Fire and that guy was not a Christian he a people of L then it he said this is my Prophet that's my brother this one is your Prophet lying you can't be miserable like this every this one Prophet I never understood that until when I go to the business people what I'm doing now I connect Bram I connect them if is a good people people most are rich people rich people are good more than poor people yes because poverty bring jealousy you don't want someone to progress yes sir there to see the plastic when always plastic enter in our house no plastics you see poverty you know what confess always [Music] positive I'm trying to help my brethren there's something I receive like revelation because I never also see the same way thinking like when a Christian not too too much money no it's not good and then you know what we end up by you will just give it's fine it's just we going go to heaven Jesus told Peter in this this world he said he didn't say he didn't say house he say hous houses I'm an evangelist but this year I change I start to balance there is too much poverty in my brother and sister why why only ask we must go to work to those unbelievers why this be you God can also inspire you to have your own company you you hire also Brothers why you try just to sit and question and you just see that you become rebellious about yourself if 100 people thousand people they going this way million it doesn't mean that's a good way be peculiar We Are The Peculiar people I'm preaching for those they have a d on if you don't have a d on forget it's not for you because seek first the kingdom of God I have a dinner Dynamo I have I'm I'm I'm practicing he working for me and they going to work for you amen I'm sorry to say this this among my brothers here let me just tell you this I don't have enough money but in the way I'm working people they are billionaire millionaire and I try to what make me them to succeed that's my question the dev the devil you know in Africa when someone have money is giving children devil don't play with people they kill you those information it's recorded in your in your subconscious that's the job you have to work instead of gossiping

recorded since you young enironment when you wake up in the morning start to conf my wife she saw me like crazy she's there she's laughing when I wake up in the morning I said oh Rich I'm very I'm billionaire hallelujah praise God hallelujah billionaire I look at in the mirror I'm going to help my brother my sisters oh God thank you for I don't ask God to give money I said God thank you to give
