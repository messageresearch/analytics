I know for some of you it is truly a sacrifice, but I'm sure God will reward you for your sacrifice for being here tonight. As we stand, let us turn to St. John, 4th chapter, the fourth chapter of St. John, and we're going to read the 24th verse. And then from St. John the fourth chapter, we go down to St. John 17. John 4:24, &gt;&gt; God is a spirit, &gt;&gt; and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth. &gt;&gt; St. John 17 15th verse. &gt;&gt; I pray not thou should have taketh them out of the world, but that thou should keep them from the evil. &gt;&gt; They are not of the world. &gt;&gt; Amen.

We love the Lord. &gt;&gt; Let us pray. &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father God, &gt;&gt; we come before you, Lord, as humbly as we know how. &gt;&gt; And we thank you for your grace and your mercy. &gt;&gt; We thank you for being so good to us. You have been better to us than we have been to ourselves. &gt;&gt; And we pray, Father, &gt;&gt; tonight that you look beyond our faults, see our needs, oh God. We'll be careful to give you the praise, glory, and honor. In your name, Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen. You may be seated. Amen. &gt;&gt; We just like to entitle the message &gt;&gt; the living God revealed dealing with the living God being revealed to you personally. I'm going to read a little quote from brother Brandham &gt;&gt; coming from 1950. &gt;&gt; I believe that's August 8 to 15 paragraph 8. &gt;&gt; Here he says, "Grant Lord that something will be said tonight or done &gt;&gt; that will cause the wayward to turn to Christ. For we believe and feel pressure in the spirit that great judgments are upon these lands in the last days, plagues, disease, germs already bred up to be scattered throughout the nations. [Music] No doctor knows even how to take a hold of it. Oh God, we have to believe in divine healing. Then when nations are breeding germs together, they burst them in bombs and millions die in hours over it. I want you to understand this is 1950 and the prophet is talking about what they're going to do. &gt;&gt; If he's not a prophet, I don't know what he is because that's what they're doing now and is already in the making. He said, "But oh, we're we're so thankful that when the destroying angel went forth, &gt;&gt; you said, "Touch not, touch not none that has the seal of the father upon their forehead. They are mine." Oh, we're so glad tonight to be under the blood, safely protected as Israel in the days of old, &gt;&gt; putting the blood upon the lentil and of the doorpost, upon the doorpost, signs of the cross. And when the death angel was sweeping in the land, the dark wings bowed down. &gt;&gt; But when he seen the blood, he rose up again, and I will pass over you. Waiting sacrificial lamb been killed. We take his body upon under the blood safe. &gt;&gt; Oh God, waiting for the midnight hour to come when the march out is called. We're going out some of these nights to the promised landed shard with the gospel of peace. the full armor of the whole arm of the gospel going forward. Help us, dear Lord, &gt;&gt; to buckle up tonight. Examine the post and the ll to see if the blood's dead. Then walk forward to challenge every enemy. Knowing that our great chief captain, the one that met Joshua after crossing the river, said, "I am the captain of the Lord's host, oh God." Joshua trembled. He knew that you were leading. Hallelujah. And I say all of this &gt;&gt; by the grace of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. This is the hour &gt;&gt; or the time that you must know who God is. &gt;&gt; It is imperative something or is is is of the most importance. It is necessary. Hallelujah. that you know who God is. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. In the message, who is God? &gt;&gt; The prophet said, &gt;&gt; the one that stood there and rolled stars off of his hand and rose worlds out of his hand and made the things which we do not that do not appear. Hallelujah. He said deity deity himself lived in manity the creator &gt;&gt; that made heaven and earth lives in mankind. Why? No wonder cripples when you realize that you're straighten out the creator is here. No wonder blind and they can't see. Open up. The creator is here. The creator &gt;&gt; realize who we are. &gt;&gt; We are sons and daughters of God. His offspring. I'm I'm reading this because you've got to know who God is. It is it is not only necessary &gt;&gt; but it is a must. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I'm not talking about a feelood. I'm not talking about a shout. I'm not talking about a dance. I'm talking about God in you. Because he said in that day, you'll know that I'm in the father. The father's in me and I am in you. Hallelujah. We must wake up to the reality of who we are. Y'all better hear what I'm saying. These things are coming and nothing can stop it. Once the word of God is gone out, it cannot come back void. Hallelujah. That's right. We are sons and daughters of God, &gt;&gt; his offspring. &gt;&gt; Then we're something like God was. Jesus said itself, it is written, you're gods, written in your law. We become a part of God, a son of God by the adoption through Jesus Christ. Therefore, if you realize that that very God that made the dirt and the earth and what'sever here is living among men, where is our faith, friends? Hallelujah. We've got to quit thinking like men. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. and think the way God would think. Hallelujah. He said, "These things I do when he was on earth, greater shall you do if I go unto my father and whatsoever thing you desire. When you pray, believe you receive them, you shall have them." That's the creator speaking. Is that right? Then it doesn't lay in him, it lays upon us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Who is God? &gt;&gt; He said now deity is here with us. Deity in us yet a little while and the world seeth me no more. Is that scripture? &gt;&gt; Yes. Ye shall see me for I'll be with you, even in you until the end of the world. Then Christ is in the church until there is no more world. Then if we can find where Christ is working in the church, that's the church I want to be in. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; So we must understand You can't understand God without being consecrated. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And you can't understand God &gt;&gt; without faith. &gt;&gt; And faith is a gift from God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But to the bride of Christ, God has blessed us with every heavenly gift. He has blessed us abundantly with spiritual things. But how many of us possess these things? We're so busy about ourselves in our own lives when the work of God has not yet been done. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Don't you realize the rapture can't take place until God see his very image? &gt;&gt; Until he see his likeness, excuse me. his likeness in human beings. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But understand this, it does not have to be a majority. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You better hear what I'm saying. Enoch was the only one that had the faith to walk with God. Hallelujah. And the Bible said he so pleased God, &gt;&gt; he wasn't found. He was raptured. &gt;&gt; He was translated. And the prophet God says that the bride is a type of Enoch. &gt;&gt; Y'all hear what I'm saying? We're not church people. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We are bride. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; And if we are God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You must understand. &gt;&gt; It takes faith. It takes revelation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hebrews Hebrews uh uh 11, please. You got to understand &gt;&gt; we go nowhere with &gt;&gt; without having the revelation of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God doesn't m He said the devil don't mind you say, "Oh, he's Elohim. and that he's Jehovah Gyra. &gt;&gt; Can I say it like this? The devil knows that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But one thing the devil lacked, &gt;&gt; it's a true revelation of who God is. He He can't receive that. This is why he continues to fight God expecting to win. Hallelujah. But when you understand who God is, That revelation has come to you. &gt;&gt; You have you become an invincible enemy. &gt;&gt; Hebrews 11 1-10. &gt;&gt; This ain't about politics. &gt;&gt; This is not this is not about who and what we want. It's all about God. It's what God wants. Hebrews 11 1-10. &gt;&gt; Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. For by it the elders obtain a good report. Now what what did brother Brandham say faith was? Hallelujah. He said it was revealed &gt;&gt; unto Abel what the sacrifice was. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Y'all understand me? And if that was from the beginning, it will be to the end. Hallelujah. Brother Brandham didn't work by hope. &gt;&gt; He worked by the faith and revelation that God gave him. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Did you not know &gt;&gt; it was a while before brother Brandham saw himself in the scripture? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It was a while before that revelation struck him. But when it struck him, &gt;&gt; hallelujah, and he saw himself. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It changed everything. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. See, that's what I'm talking about. &gt;&gt; You got to know who you are. &gt;&gt; Well, I hope I'm bride. You got to know who you are. &gt;&gt; And if you know who you are, then you know that the scripture is yours. It is your inheritance. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Through faith. &gt;&gt; We understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God. &gt;&gt; So that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This is why I say faith is not just a thing. Faith is a person. And that person is Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So right because all things were made by him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, is that right? &gt;&gt; There was no substance there. Nothing. But the word spoke and when the word spoke, everything came into existence. Hallelujah. And like the prophet of God says, God believes in his own word. &gt;&gt; So how can you be a part of God and not believe in the word of God? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now I'm telling you some things tonight because a lot of us think religion going to get us there. Our church going to get us there. So you understand the Catholic people believe their church going to get them there too. Hallelujah. And like I said the other day, you can be so well taught &gt;&gt; until your teachings will blind you. &gt;&gt; It ain't by teaching. It's by revelation. Upon this rock I build my church. Hallelujah. Those Pharisees were way they were taught far better than us but they did not have the revelation of the word and when the word came they call it the devil. Is that right? When Luther the Lutheran were taught so so well in the Lutheran doctrine [Music] until the Westlands came and the Lutheran called the Westlands the devil. And the westerns were so taught in their doctrine to when the Pentecostal came, they called it the devil. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What about us? &gt;&gt; What about us? We're so well taught to the Holy Spirit himself. Can barely move in the church because we know so much doctrine. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But he whom the Son is set free is free indeed. And where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty. Hallelujah. Message or no message. I've never let anybody put me in prison. Oh, come on. You said, "What are you talking about, Brother Brooks? I'm saying you're so well taught. You're so well taught that the Holy Ghost can't even move. God want to move in you. You sit still like a law. Hallelujah. But when revelation strikes, hallelujah, I don't care who sitting next to me. &gt;&gt; I don't care if the president was in the building. Oh my God. When God move, I want to move with him. Y'all better hear what I'm saying. This is not about church. This is about the Holy Ghost. And if you don't know the Holy Ghost, your church rules and your church creed binds you. Is that right? Is it true? &gt;&gt; You can go to some churches and if you don't mention Brother Brandham's name, oh, you better not go there. They say you're not in the message. &gt;&gt; I'm going ask you a question. How many times did Paul say I mean how many times did brother Brandham say Paul &gt;&gt; and he said I'm following the Paul message you said brother Benam the message is the same I got your attention now &gt;&gt; let me tell you something if you don't see Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; you are an idoltor That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's true. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Paul said, "Nobody, I didn't die for you." Some say of Paul, some say of Cphus. This spirit has been around a long time ago. Hallelujah. But there's only one who died for me, and that is the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I don't disrespect Brother Panam. I know where he where he stands. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But how can I constantly look back trying to go forward? &gt;&gt; People don't like the way I preach, but that's okay. I'm not I'm not preaching for people and I'm not trying to please nobody here. We're trying to get you to a place that you can come to recognize who you are. Y'all understand me? &gt;&gt; There's a Bible full of types where you can see brother Brown in it. &gt;&gt; There's no doubt about that. &gt;&gt; But it but but who are you? &gt;&gt; Who are you? What is your revelation of who you are tonight? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If Jesus had to find himself in the scripture, you must find yourself in the scripture. If brother Brandham had to find himself in the scripture, you must find yourself in the scripture. Hallelujah. And when you find yourself in the scripture, nobody in this message can put you out. &gt;&gt; Nobody. &gt;&gt; The thing about it, I'm not ashamed to talk about brother Brandon, read his quotes and things like that. because I know who I'm work what I'm working with. &gt;&gt; It's the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Because I'm going to tell you how the church started. &gt;&gt; Peter did not have a scripture before him, &gt;&gt; but he was the word. &gt;&gt; And when he quoted Joel, He did not have a scroll in his hand. He was under the inspiration of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; And the Holy Ghost fell. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What are you talking about when they were in Kia's house? They didn't have a scroll. They didn't have a book. &gt;&gt; But they were the word. They learn how to be led by the Holy Spirit to say the right things at the right time. Hallelujah. And then what happened? Kneel's house. The Holy Ghost fell. Y'all hear what I'm saying? The letter kill it. &gt;&gt; But it's the spirit that gives life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; By faith. &gt;&gt; Fourth verse. Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain. By faith, brother said it was revelation. And that revelation became faith. You say, "Well, brother Brandham wasn't that way." Yes, he did. When God revealed to brother Brandham what he was going to do, brother Brandham faith, that faith, he said, "I never seen it fail. I saw the vision. I can speak the vision and I know the vision is going to come to pass. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because I know it will never fail. &gt;&gt; What was that? &gt;&gt; That was God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You understand me? God. Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. The spirit of Jesus Christ is what? Prophecy. Yeah. I don't know how people do that, but they do. &gt;&gt; By faith &gt;&gt; was uh by faith Enoch, &gt;&gt; hallelujah, was translated. &gt;&gt; Did y'all hear that? &gt;&gt; By revelation, &gt;&gt; can I say it like that? If faith and revelation is the same, God revealed to Enoch what it took to get there. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, how are you going to work it? If you don't know God, how you going to I'm coming to the scripture. Yeah. Amen. Because God because God had translated him for but for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But look at this sixth verse. But without faith it's impossible to please him. He didn't say without hope. He said it was without faith. Hallelujah. And he told his disciples, &gt;&gt; "It is given to you to know the mysteries. I have hid it from the wise and the prudent, &gt;&gt; but I'm revealing it. I'm giving faith to my children, the humble ones." Somebody help me here. You got to understand, we need Jesus. We need that Holy Ghost. We need that power. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And I'm going to tell you something. People don't understand when they're dead. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They're dead and don't even know it. Because if the word can't get you excited, nothing will. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. For he that cometh to God that let me let me say one thing about brother Brandham. Brother Brandham can even hear a Baptist PE preacher preach and enjoy it because he he would preach the word. Whenever he said he whenever he preached the word he said even it was just a nugget you say amen. &gt;&gt; Let me tell y'all something. You know I love you, &gt;&gt; but knowledge will not get you there. &gt;&gt; Knowing who Moses was didn't do them any good because they refuse to humble themselves to the voice of God. Knowing who brother Brandham is not going to do you any good when you don't live what he preached &gt;&gt; is that right &gt;&gt; even Jesus said if you love me keep my commandments hallelujah I'm excited tonight but without faith it is impossible to please him this is where I'm going for He that cometh to God must &gt;&gt; must must I'm going say it again must &gt;&gt; believe that he is believe that he is God and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Can I ask you a question? When we look at the the divine nature of God, &gt;&gt; what do you think that is? That's the elements of God. &gt;&gt; That's element. That's Elohim. &gt;&gt; It is not a fleshly thing. It's spiritual. &gt;&gt; The divine nature is Elohim. &gt;&gt; Go listen to the message. Who is God? Brother Brandham said it was his nature that created everything. Hallelujah. And the nature of Jesus Christ and the nature of God is the same. &gt;&gt; We're not talking about just being kind. We're talking about the nature of God coming in you and you then begin to behave like God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And we call it what? The Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; The matured Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Some people don't understand. &gt;&gt; But let me say it like this. &gt;&gt; God has always been the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; There ain't there's only one Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Now in the Old Testament, they don't call him the Holy Ghost. They call him the father. &gt;&gt; He still was the Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; When they saw him in the pillar of fire, &gt;&gt; he still was God. He still was a father. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, come on, somebody. When he come down and dwelt in Jesus, he still was the father in he was the same Holy Ghost. He was the same Christ. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Y'all understand what I'm saying? So when God comes into you, he's a what? &gt;&gt; He's a father. &gt;&gt; He's a son. &gt;&gt; He's a Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That one God is in you. [Music] Hallelujah. It's a revelation. And when you know that God is in you, you do not worry because you know &gt;&gt; God is in control. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There's only one true authority. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And it ain't the devil. &gt;&gt; The devil was stripped of his authority. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. There's only one true authority &gt;&gt; and that's God Almighty who bears the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; One authority. He was the one saying let there be who was that in the beginning was the word. The word was with God and the word was God. That same word came down and made himself a house in flesh and we beheld him as the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth. Hallelujah. But the Bible says he gave power to them who would believe they would become the sons of God. And what is a son of God is the pillar of fire stepping into your flesh. That's what it is. And then you become the tabernacle of God. Is that right? The Bible said, "Know ye not that you're the tabernacle of God." Hallelujah. And if God is in you, he doesn't lose any of his power. He's still omnipotent. He still is the only authority. He still is God. &gt;&gt; It's not the scripture saying ye are God. &gt;&gt; It's a revelation. &gt;&gt; But you got to have it. &gt;&gt; And the Bible says &gt;&gt; he is a rewarder &gt;&gt; of them that diligently seek That don't mean picking up your Bible every now and again. &gt;&gt; That means seeking him. &gt;&gt; When you search for something in the house that you've lost, you continue to search for it. You look in places that you know you didn't put it, but you look looking and looking. And then once you find, you like, oh, you know what? And sometimes it's right in your face. How many times you looking for your keys &gt;&gt; and they're right in your hand sometime. I'm looking for my phone and my phone is basically said here I am. I'm looking right at it. I can't see. &gt;&gt; What is that? either it was there and then it wasn't there and God put it there. He does. &gt;&gt; I was just walking down the street the other day on my walk. &gt;&gt; I had never seen a flock of doves before. &gt;&gt; A flock of doves. &gt;&gt; And uh I'm like, "Wow, that's awesome. And the Holy Spirit said, "Turn around and count them." &gt;&gt; And there were seven doves. &gt;&gt; And then when I look up, there was one only on the wire. Eight months. I say, "Thank you, Lord. Maybe I'm being too spiritual, but I know what I know what I've asked God for." Hallelujah. And I'm taking that as a witness because I haven't seen the flock of doves like that since then. Hallelujah. I know. I know. My God. See what one thing I've learned &gt;&gt; by walking in the morning. The beauty of nature and how God speaks through the nature. And when you when you really in the spirit, you feel him. You know he's there. Times it it was getting ready to rain. And I said, "Lord, you don't let it rain till I get home." And all of a sudden, the clouds part. You know, y'all think I'm crazy, but I'm going tell you, if you talk to him, hallelujah, fellowship with him, hallelujah, he'll reveal himself to you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. My God is the God of the clouds. My God is the God of the rain. Why shouldn't I talk to him like he's God? [Music] Sometime we don't even realize what we got. That's what brother said. Lord, I I feel that the church don't know who she is. Hallelujah. But you can't do it no different. If it took faith for Noah, it's going to take faith for you. If it took faith for Enoch, it's going to take faith for you. If it took faith for Abraham, it's going to take faith for you. And how on earth you going to get it &gt;&gt; if God don't reveal it to you? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Yes, ma'am. Yes, sir. This ain't no work. &gt;&gt; Faith is not even a feeling. &gt;&gt; It's when you know that you know that you know that you know. &gt;&gt; That's all I can tell you. &gt;&gt; And nobody can take that from you. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; It's real. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham didn't preach this message for us to just read it like a like a newspaper. Hallelujah. He want action, hearing and acting upon the word of God. It's got to live. And if you are the epistles of God, that means you're the word of God living. Hallelujah. That's the truth. &gt;&gt; Storms come and you say, "Oh my God, what I'm going to do?" What do you mean? &gt;&gt; Think about the word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When anybody patriot or not, when Satan would come in like a flood, &gt;&gt; the spirit of the Lord will always lift up a standard. What happens when you're faced with a situation and you can't solve it? You go to God in prayer. You believe God until things change. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Because you have faith. There's a revelation. If I ask anything in his name and be what? Believe it, it shall be given. By faith, &gt;&gt; Abraham, when he's called to go out into a place, &gt;&gt; which he should afterwards receive for an inheritance, &gt;&gt; obeyed, and he went out, not knowing whether he went, &gt;&gt; but he was going to receive it as an inheritance. We talk about a rapture. We talk about the change of the body. That's our inheritance. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We don't know how to get there, but by faith we know we going to get there. Hallelujah. And then prophet of God comes along and drops in a vision. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It was more than a vision. He said, he said, I was there. I hugged those people. &gt;&gt; I hugged those people. &gt;&gt; Man and woman, and I saw you there. Now let me ask you a question. When your leader, God in the prophet of God told you about the promised land, what are you going to do? Oh my God. There's giants in the land. There were giants then. They're giants now. They're big devils in this world. Hallelujah. But what God did yesterday, he's doing it today. He's a giant slayer today. I don't care what the problems are. There's nothing too hard for God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, let me say it like this. You say, "Lord, I want the Holy Ghost." And the Bible said, "God will not give you a serpent for bread." Hallelujah. You want the Holy Ghost, you got to believe you going to get it. You got to believe it's for you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. And you know what? &gt;&gt; Whether you feel it or not. &gt;&gt; When the Holy Ghost comes, &gt;&gt; it will change you. &gt;&gt; It'll drive those lustful spirits away from you. It'll drive that d that lying devil out of your life. Hallelujah. It'll it'll drive those thie spirits away. Hallelujah. The Holy Ghost will do it. Not you. The Holy Ghost will do it. Hallelujah. Because the Holy Ghost is the fire of God. Hallelujah. And he comes to burn every devil away from you. I don't know about you. But I can't be happy. Hallelujah. Fully happy. Hallelujah. Until I know that this land has been fully conquered. Hallelujah. I know I got the power within me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And in his time, &gt;&gt; I say in his time, &gt;&gt; hallelujah, he's going to give me my mountain. &gt;&gt; Look for a city &gt;&gt; which had no foundation, &gt;&gt; whose builder and maker is who? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's more than just a mansion over there. &gt;&gt; He made you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Made you spiritual man first. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Then he made us what? These old carnal fleshly things. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But I'm going tell you something. God is God. &gt;&gt; And you got to realize that God and Jesus Christ is the same person. And that at the name of Jesus, every knee shall bow, every tongue shall confess, that he is Lord to the glory of God the Father. &gt;&gt; Y'all understand what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; Use the name. &gt;&gt; Oh, I got to feel goosebumps. I ain't got to feel nothing. Use the name &gt;&gt; and watch God. Watch God bless you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; You love the Lord. &gt;&gt; Adoption to &gt;&gt; 60 live 18. &gt;&gt; 1965 18. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You love the Lord, &gt;&gt; people. I am enjoying Jesus. Do you make mistakes? I make mistakes every day. &gt;&gt; But I'm going to do what he wants me to do. &gt;&gt; I'm going to praise him in situation. &gt;&gt; If I fall and scrape my knees, I'm gonna tell him thank you. I &gt;&gt; I know what I'm talking about. &gt;&gt; One time I was walking &gt;&gt; and I stumped my toe on the on the pavement and I had to duck my head. In doing that, I ducked my head. And then when I looked around, there was a branch I was going to bump my head into. And I had rather stomp my toe than to bump my head on that branch. You say that wasn't God. That was God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Sometime he causing little things of pain, &gt;&gt; but he you don't understand what he just protected you from. Paragraph 40. &gt;&gt; Let me draw &gt;&gt; you a little illustration here. &gt;&gt; It's good. We go back. I believe I'll talk on it a little bit the other night or struck it in Genesis the first chapter. &gt;&gt; Genesis 1:26. &gt;&gt; He said, "When God called his name Lord God, It's in the word l Elohim &gt;&gt; which means selfexisting one. There was nothing else existed but listen closely. There was no air. There was no light. There was no stars. There was no world. There was nothing else. It was God and God alone. L E L E L E L E L E L E L E L E L E L E L E. &gt;&gt; Now he made that. You understand what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; So that same God that created everything is in you when you receive the Holy Ghost. Don't try to understand it. You got to believe it. &gt;&gt; Believe it, people. Keep humble &gt;&gt; but believe it. &gt;&gt; Inside of that &gt;&gt; was attributes &gt;&gt; which meant that he was &gt;&gt; inside of this great &gt;&gt; Ella Elohim Elohim &gt;&gt; was a was attributes. &gt;&gt; There you go. You know what the attribute is? &gt;&gt; Oh, let me say it this way. This &gt;&gt; was a nature. &gt;&gt; He didn't change his nature. &gt;&gt; Nature. &gt;&gt; We don't even realize what God trying to get us to. We think it's just a poster up on the wall. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He's trying to put a himself in you &gt;&gt; like he did in the body of Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; so he can say this is my well this is my son whom I'm well pleased and dwell in this is what he's looking for Jesus who was the first born of his creation hallelujah and we come after that &gt;&gt; hallelujah and Jesus understood what he possessed &gt;&gt; and what possessed him. &gt;&gt; So much so in John 10:30, which is one of my favorite scriptures, he said, "I am the father of &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This ain't no fairy tale. This reality, can I say it like this?" Brother Bon talks about a million to one. Oneion You weren't born a Muslim. God was your God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You wasn't born in Buddhism, &gt;&gt; Hinduism, Hinduism. &gt;&gt; Look at all these religions and everybody think they're right. &gt;&gt; And everybody almost can produce some kind of supernatural. Y'all hear what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; The prophet of God told us that &gt;&gt; there's some Muslims that have put y'all Christians to shame. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But there's got to be a difference. Like that Muslim said, &gt;&gt; he said, "Your prophet promised that when when you get the Holy Ghost, when you become a Christian, these signs shall follow you. What he did on earth is what you supposed to be doing. Now, people don't care. Oh, I'm a Christian. &gt;&gt; And ain't no life behind it. There ain't no power behind it. No signs are following you. Some of us ain't never seen a sign. What is that? &gt;&gt; Something you missing. &gt;&gt; And don't confuse churchism with having the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; You don't get a second chance when your life get ready to leave here. You're going to have to have that token life. You're going to have to have that Holy Ghost. That's the only thing that's going to take you out. It ain't going to be your memory. Oh, I know the quotes. I know the quotes back and forth, you know. No, that won't work. &gt;&gt; It ain't going to work. You got to know Christ. &gt;&gt; He said in that day, &gt;&gt; you'll know I'm in the Father. The Father's in me and I'm in you. You got to know something. And it's a revelation. That revelation will bring some good feelings. Hallelujah. It's like winning a million dollars. You don't have the million dollars yet, &gt;&gt; but oh my, it brings some good feelings. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Y'all don't People don't know how fast. You know what? You can die right now. Each and every one of us can drop dead &gt;&gt; right now. We could do that. &gt;&gt; And the question is, are you ready? Are you prepared? &gt;&gt; You know, it's amazing. We'll let the devil talk to us all day. &gt;&gt; And then when God try to talk to you, you block him with your own thoughts. &gt;&gt; You disrespect God. When you come into the house of God and you got all these other things on your mind as if he doesn't know it [Music] and he's talking and you're allowing Satan to talk to you while he's talking. I can't stand that. &gt;&gt; I even tell some of the people at my house. &gt;&gt; How do y'all talk over each other? &gt;&gt; It's rude. It's disrespectful. &gt;&gt; When they try to do that to me, I said, "Hold up, stop. &gt;&gt; I can't talk and you talk at the same time &gt;&gt; and me understand you and you understand me. But we'll come here &gt;&gt; and the devil is talking to you listening more to him. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord help us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Can I finish? Inside of that was attributes which meant &gt;&gt; that he was inside of this great l Elohim was an attribute. You know what an attribute is or let me say it like this was a nature that so the little fella will get it and I'm one of them little fellas that has to get it that way inside of him was the inside of him was the nature to be a father but he's selfexistent there ain't think nothing of him to be a father by. And now down inside of that &gt;&gt; was something else that he was God and a God is an object of worship but he was self-existent lim. So there was nothing to worship him inside of that. &gt;&gt; He was a savior and there was nothing lost to be saved. And inside of that, &gt;&gt; he was a healer. See, but there was nothing sick to be healed. &gt;&gt; Wasn't nothing to be sick. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, do you get the picture? &gt;&gt; So, his attributes, his nature produced what is today. Everything you see, everything that is. &gt;&gt; You say, "Wait a minute, brother Brooks. Don't you understand? When God allow you to get sick, &gt;&gt; it's only because he wants you to know that he's a healer. When you get discouraged, don't you know he wants you to know he's a burden bearer. He's a heavy load sharer. He's a peace giver. Hallelujah. All these things are coming to you so that you can come to know him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Every day. Almost every day. I just I just talked to him. I said, "Lord, you're so good to me. &gt;&gt; You're so good to me." He do things he spoils me. I I I I I I I wanted a a massage chair. &gt;&gt; The thing cost over $5,000. &gt;&gt; No, I didn't pay $5,000. But let me show you what God did. The brother where I saw the chair, he sells it &gt;&gt; in Colorado. He calls me one day. Do you still want this a chair? He said, "My company is upgrading mine and and and I'll sell it to you." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For a little or nothing. &gt;&gt; Now, think about this because I'm thinking though you selling it to me, &gt;&gt; I'm seeing God. How am I going to get it? And then he had a brother from his church who's coming on a business trip to De Mo. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He brings the chair while he's he brings the chair. He actually brings it into the house. You got to see God. &gt;&gt; And he puts it together. &gt;&gt; And God knows my mechanic skills are just down. Y'all hear what I'm saying? I wanted me a hammock. A hammock. One of those things you lay in outside. Been want one for a while. And uh and then my my son and my daughter, they bought me a hammock. Y'all looking at me like I'm crazy. &gt;&gt; But I'mma tell you like this. &gt;&gt; When you really serve the Lord, [Music] God comes through. You know what I mean? I didn't, you know, I didn't beg God &gt;&gt; for neither of these things, &gt;&gt; but God gave it to me anyway. I'm telling you, &gt;&gt; those are just little things. &gt;&gt; And I often think, well, if God going to give me natural, what about spiritual? &gt;&gt; We went to the eye doctor today &gt;&gt; and my eye has improved so well. So they extended extended my time to come again. &gt;&gt; But you they don't know I'm speaking complete heal. &gt;&gt; You hear what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; And I'm waiting for the doctor to get shocked. &gt;&gt; But what they didn't see is what I saw &gt;&gt; in his time. Hallelujah. Oh my God. I'm so Y'all don't know what it is to get a needle in your eye every so &gt;&gt; but I saw God today in a great way. &gt;&gt; I told you I saw those. I'm going to get it. &gt;&gt; Hey, I saw the doves. I'm going to get it. Is that right? I'm not comparing myself with brother Brandham. Brother Brandham saw those doves. Hallelujah. Or those squirrels, rather. And he got completely healed. Let &gt;&gt; me I'm enjoying Jesus. I hope you are with me. &gt;&gt; But I'm trying to get you to place to you'll know first. You got to know he's God. How many of us know he's God? &gt;&gt; In your heart, people, you got to know he's God. Because if you don't know he's God in your heart, somebody's going to take it away from you. The squeeze come, &gt;&gt; they'll take it from you. &gt;&gt; If it's not in your heart, hallelujah. They said, "Oh, it can't be." So Judas followed him. How long? &gt;&gt; It wasn't in his heart. Brother Ben said he was among the ones casting out devils. It wasn't in his heart. &gt;&gt; And when the squeeze came hallelujah, &gt;&gt; he betrayed God. Even Peter, &gt;&gt; it wasn't in his heart. That's why he lied. [Music] &gt;&gt; And but God said, "I know who you are, Peter. &gt;&gt; You're a seed. &gt;&gt; Cuz one day you going to be converted. One day it's going to be in your heart. &gt;&gt; And when it's in your heart, you go strengthen your brother. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Love the Lord. You got to know him for yourself diligently. Seek him. How do you seek him on your knees in the scriptures listening to tapes? How many of y'all do the tapes still move you? &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. Oh yes. Oh yes. Oh yes. Oh yes. I don't hear a man. I hear the voice of God. Y'all understand me? &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "Brother Brandon can't sing. He sang good to me." Yeah. Coming from the heart. That's right. Let me move on. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. coming from the message deity of Jesus Christ 1949 1225 you know you can't please people but I tell you I tell you one thing for certain &gt;&gt; you got to know him and he's got to know you was talking with a precious friend of mine from South Africa &gt;&gt; just the other day &gt;&gt; and I said brother brother he's a pastor I said there's so many people in the message that that appears to have not the Holy Ghost. I said it just seem like there's just a system that got locked in. You can tell their behavior is not like God. You know, you know what I'm saying? And and I I was just telling him that and he said, "Brother," he said, "I find it here everywhere." &gt;&gt; He said, "Everybody thinking it's a shouting, a dance when we've been warned. We've been warned. We've been warned. That's not it. It's finding God in you. You got to come to know he's in you." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. That's what he said. You'll know in that day. Not that you'll wonder. You'll know. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And there's so many. It's just like, Lord, help us. &gt;&gt; You know, I love the worship. I know. I love the praise. &gt;&gt; But but you know what has happened to the enthusiasm that people once had when it came to the message? Something's wrong. You don't have to say it, but something. &gt;&gt; I'm telling you, something's wrong. Paragraph 134. &gt;&gt; Which way you're going this morning? &gt;&gt; What are you dreaming? &gt;&gt; I don't care which kind of group it likes. Each one of you, you're going to go into an eternity one these days. And without Christ, without the Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; your soul is lost. Remember that &gt;&gt; you cannot meet that but only by accepting Christ by the Holy Spirit. If he is in you, he's the power of God. Live by it. He's God in you. The Bible says you become God. That's right. &gt;&gt; Aren't ye all gods? &gt;&gt; And Jesus said, the Pharisees said, you make yourself god. Said, isn't it written in your law that ye are gods? He made Moses a god of Pharaoh. &gt;&gt; And he makes you a god to the people. That's right. You &gt;&gt; this morning are written epistles of God. Your lives are God's are all God's. And you must cherish [Music] &gt;&gt; that Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Cherish it. Cherish it. It means you're not going to let the fire go out. Cherish it. Galatians 1 and I'm gonna let you go. &gt;&gt; This is what Paul says 111 and 12. &gt;&gt; But I certify you, brethren, &gt;&gt; that the gospel which was preached of me is not at the man This is Paul. It's not after man. This is not a man gospel. This is not Paul's gospel &gt;&gt; is what he's saying. &gt;&gt; Basically, we can say, "Well, it's Paul's gospel because it was God in him." But Paul couldn't come up with that. Let me tell y'all something. Brother Brandon could not have come up with the word like that. That was God in the man. &gt;&gt; No man could have come through the scriptures like that. A seventh grade education. Come on. Hallelujah. And when brother Brandham didn't understand, who did he go to? He went to God in prayer. Hallelujah. When he didn't understand, Amen. the wheat and the tear. He the wheat and the tear. He didn't understand what he saw among the Pentecostals. One speaking in tongue and the other one interpreting. Hallelujah. One was a devil and the one was a saint. Hallelujah. And God took him to Hebrews 6. That was God. Hallelujah. Opening up his eyes. to what that was all about. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; People are I'm telling you &gt;&gt; for neither receive it of of man. &gt;&gt; In other words, nobody's school gave me this. Neither was I taught of it. But by the what? Revelation of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; It was the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. That took Paul in the Arabian desert for three years or so and taught him the word. And when Paul came out of the desert, his revelation was greater than all the others. So much so Peter said, "The things that Paul write are sometimes hard to understand. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Why? Because Paul was a prophet. &gt;&gt; We would have never known that had it not been for this message. &gt;&gt; Paul the apostle. But it's never written Paul the prophet. And the word of the Lord comes through the prophet. And Paul wrote almost the whole New Testament. Hallelujah. Y'all hear what I'm saying? Let me show you something. &gt;&gt; Come to me, brother. When he was in the vision, he said, "I want to see Jesus." &gt;&gt; And the angel said, "You can't. &gt;&gt; Not now because he's higher." &gt;&gt; Y'all understand me? So what are you saying? &gt;&gt; You know when people say Jes brother Adam is God. &gt;&gt; That ain't what he saw. &gt;&gt; That ain't what he saw. &gt;&gt; He saw Jesus as God. &gt;&gt; And there's only one that sits on the throne. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Y'all ready to go already? What about you, brother? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You love the Lord. &gt;&gt; So, I'm almost done. Y'all know I always go to 9:00. &gt;&gt; So, I got seven more minutes. &gt;&gt; Oh, Lord have mercy. You love the Lord. Brother, uh, here here Galatians 2:2, &gt;&gt; he said, "I went up by revelation &gt;&gt; and communicated unto them that gospel which I preach among the Gentiles." And you got to understand, Paul had to move by revelation because there was nothing in the scripture telling him to go to the Gentiles. God spoke to him &gt;&gt; and told him to kick off his shoes ever. &gt;&gt; Shut it down. &gt;&gt; I got you now going to the Gentiles. &gt;&gt; Revelation speaks. &gt;&gt; It speaks. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You love the Lord. &gt;&gt; Last scripture. 1 Corinthians &gt;&gt; 16 &gt;&gt; 22- 23. &gt;&gt; If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be anathema there not. &gt;&gt; How many of y'all know what that means? It means let him be a curse. &gt;&gt; You don't love the Lord Jesus, you are a curse. &gt;&gt; And that word cannot be broken. &gt;&gt; It can't be broken. Let's stand.
