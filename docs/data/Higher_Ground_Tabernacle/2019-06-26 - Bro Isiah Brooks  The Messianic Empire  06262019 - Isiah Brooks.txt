you Jesus set me free whoo ha ha - doo-dah Jesus set me free I'm so glad she the set me free Laurie hallelujah Jesus set me free amen he loved the Lord amen as we stand and go right into the word of the Lord a little while ago we administered on on the subject messianic Empire that's kind of on a draw from that subject again tonight I feel like it should be a part two to it or three whichever it it was but I got some other thoughts that the Lord had given me concerning the Empire in itself so if you would just turn with us to revelations the first chapter we ate a little something today this morning for breakfast that really set my system off and now by God's grace I'll give you the best that I have tonight Revelation is one we're going to read from there then we'll go to Revelation is five revelations one sixth and have made us kings and priests unto God and his father to him be glory and Dominion for ever and ever revelations five nine through tenth verse and they saw a new song saying thou art worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou was slain and have redeemed us to God by the blood by thy blood out of every kindred and tongue and people and nation and have made unto our God kings and priests and we shall reign on the earth let us pray Lord we thank you for your grace and your mercy we thank you for being so good to us you have been better to us than we have been to ourselves father we pray that you would have preeminence tonight we thank you for all who are here and those who had desire to come and could not make it bless us Lord your name Jesus Christ we pray amen you may be seated when we think about empires we may often think of the Roman Empire because most people know that Rome reign a long time and they were a powerful system organized by men I think the first founder of Rome was a man called Rome Ellis and we know that rome gained in power as well as influence in fact the influence of wrong can be clearly seen even today in America in her architecture so we understand it was a real a great King Kingdom and that Kingdom was prophesied to come and we find that even in that time that Kingdom was there going strong even in the time of our Lord Jesus Christ and we know that the power of the kingdom was the Emperor the Great King whatever the emperor would say whatever he would require for them to do they did it and to refuse the Emperor's request would be death don't remember during the time of John the Baptist when John the Baptist spoke to Herod he was one of the emperors of that day during time I believe he was Caesars I believe but nevertheless he was a powerful man in his region of the Empire of Rome and there is even in the scripture that the word of a king cannot return void when a king speaks it has to remain and it has to go forth and y'all remember the story about Herodias how she danced before Herod and therefore she asked Herod for John the Baptist here because he told her that he would give her anything whatsoever she asked and so he advised the King its himself was bound by his own words you remember the time also in the Persian Empire when we talked about Esther and during the time of Esther King Ahaz hora was the king he was the Emperor of that Empire it was a great Empire it influenced all of that region in other regions because those empires were empires of conquest they gained their strength by conquering other countries and making them slaves or making them servants whatever they chose to do with the with the the the countries in which they conquered they they they it was their business they did whatever they would do y'all remember the time when when Esther was to go see the king and she did go by way of the king it was an order that no one should approach the king except he was summoned them to come where Esther knew that she was in Somers about she said if I perish let me perish I'm going to see the king her concerns were at that time about her people because you know Haman who we liken as unto the devil had his just thought of an inquisition he was there to kill all of the Jews to to kill them all and he had plotted a plan to do so but more Takaya spoiled his plan and therefore God intervened but the King had already made a decree against the Jewish people that he couldn't go back on his word but in order to make it balance he he issued another law so that the Jews could fight their enemy and I said all of that to say that an empire is a machinery it works together and and and as long as that that those those pieces and those parts are working together you know nothing is lacking and nothing is lacking nothing needs to be all and nothing is broken it becomes a powerful house a powerful machinery because everything is moving by the power of one man right and and and and remember now these these kingdoms that we speaking of even even when we think about babylon babylon was a great empire but babylon in itself as brother varlyn said he it was a mimic it was a it was a copycat of the great city of heaven that with it with the great vines and beautiful gardens and all of these things in the water the river flowing through the midst of it it was it was what satan saw and he he tried to mimic that that beauty on earth every Empire is just basically a copycat or try to establish something great then God has and God has an empire and Jesus Christ is the king of all but we have lost through the battles of the years of battling we we've lost our identity it's like Israel who was a great Empire during the time of King David and during the time of Solomon they were great and and the world in large feared Israel because they had God in the camp because our Empire is different we don't rule by man we rule by God we rule by the word and so therefore we lost our our identity is like Israel when they were were were prophesied to to be dispersed all over the call over the world they lost the power and the strength of the kingdom that they once had and all they could do is go back to the days of Solomon and go back to the days of David and oh it used to be this and it used to be that and we find the same kind of a thing happening among the Christian Church but we God has even as God has tried to establish a reestablish the Jewish people they're now back at their homeland but guess what they're still battling but they know who they are they understand the ground that they're standing on they know that this land that they have been given is given by God and they understand that God is in control and that's what the church need to do because even when God sent of the message of William Branham to us and he and he was anointed by Jesus Christ and Jesus Christ proved to us he's the same yesterday today and forever he is a God that change is not but we must come back to the homeland see that's the thing we expect this message to maybe shake the world but the world has already been shaken this message in which God has brought us has not come to shake the the world it has come to shake the church and God has ordained us in this Empire and kings and priests but we must find our place a position there and take authority over the land that God has given us is that right remember that's what made Pilate you know do what he did when it came to Jesus Christ he knew that if Herod a a Caesar or whatever the the emperor was at that time if he would note that here he was allowing another king to operate in his country it was a it was a means of treason and so therefore Pilate thought well if you'd be better to betray or to to let this so-called King die then to lose my life because if if Herod finds out that I am allowing this man to rule as a king then I would be part of his conspiracy you understand me so I'm saying this how can we allow another king to rule in the kingdom of God and as long as we allow Satan to rule it looks and may appear to be a conspiracy but we don't want that we can't wash our hands of Jesus Christ we can't say we didn't know we don't know the truth because we know the truth but we lost amen by God's grace take a stand where God has placed us in that's what makes the Empire that's what makes the kingdom and the Bible said we are other kingdom that cannot be moved so we shouldn't fear and then the thing that Satan is trying to do matter of fact we need to fight back Satan is a mimic I was telling somebody I've never seen that movie the Empire fight back but I figured something was going wrong and they just thought that got tired of losing or got tired of being beaten us whatever the case may be because what happens is you just get tired of being sick and tired of being tired and all of a sudden you fight back right but how do we fight back first of all you gotta know who you are hmm when you come to know who you are then God can help you you can't approach God with this you know how we do we says we try to bargain with God God if you give me this I'll do this if you do this I'll do that that is nonsense Satan is just setting you up for a failure to be a failure hey man you don't bargain with God you come to God he says god I'm nothing I am worth nothing but have mercy on me that's how you bargain with him you can't offer God something that you don't even have so anyhow this this i'ma read this quote this quote was given to me by brother brother rich and I appreciate that I don't like calling names but it's his birthday pretty soon you forgive me listen coming from the message perfect strength oh it was a blessing to me here is something to console us here is something that encourages out of weakness and in humility God chooses the people to build his kingdom out of if we ever get to heaven if we ever stand in the presence of God with his church will stand in a bunch of people that's been weak rejected and cast out by the world and know it nothing huh it isn't isn't it strange that God liken us to sheep a sheep is the most helpless thing there is there's nothing so insufficient of of defense than the sheep a rabbit can run a squirrel can get in a tree a dog can bite a lion can tear a horse can kick a bird can fly but the Sheep stands helpless and that's the way God wants us realize that we are totally insufficient then God can take that person and begin to mold himself into that person make his hand do what God want would have him to do make his lips speak what God lips would speak because they're there they're not they're not here they're God's he begins to build a character begins to take that weakness and to make it his own he'll bring us here on earth we are educated we're smart did you ever notice the lines the lineages amen when we take the instance like Abel from Abel from King comes self self lineage come right down on down to north time all of them were just humble farmers but Cain's children become smart shrewd educated great men builders a professional man but God's eye was weak and humble that's how God uses them that's God opportunity that God's way of getting to us is when we are weak we get something then this encourages us of course because God's whole kingdom it's built out of these kind of people then when you get to that kind of a way then you can you're in his kingdom the case is with us not that we are too weak the case is we are too strong we're just too strong that's all the thing of it is it's when we were too strong handed that's right we're too strong in our head we know too much God wants to get that out of us we are too strong we're too strong to yield to him we year loss we we year to ourselves we got to think what like that he said we yield to ourselves we got to think well now here i got i got sis enough to know huh right and that's our problem you know no i got sense enough to know you got nothing and anytime you think i got sense enough to know better you don't know nothing you see because you got to understand that god is working with an anointing and a lot of time we fail to see in a sin or thing that destroys the yokes not you the anointing that destroys the yoke right and the anointing of God is not emotions the anointing is supreme power in control knowing exactly what and how hello supreme power in control emotions is fine but that doesn't mean the anointing you know mean it is in control they are launching the real anointing will is like Jesus winning he opened the book it says this day this scripture is down what manifested in your ear see he wasn't jumping and running and all of that and nothing's wrong with that but when God is in control everything that's in him in his presence he controls hmm the kingdom of God is his weird made power hmm so we know that by God's grace to say oh I got the Holy Ghost and don't recognize you have power hello we say all God is all-powerful he's omnipotent you know how we do it but what good is that gonna do you in that omnipotent power is not in you if that I Milton power is not controlling you that is what we need that is what listen is the truth because when in the Roman Empire they says hey if you don't straighten up I'm going to tell Caesar what you're doing just the fact that that that name Cesar was mentioning that type of sentence scared the Wits out of people and they were straighten up hello and what we failed to see is that we've got somebody that's telling on us brother Brown said the Holy Ghost watches us and he tells on us everything see so no one has to tell on you the Holy Ghost is going to tell in this kingdom God is calling for unity we're too scattered everybody's got their own little clique today over the world but the world the church is a machine it's a powerhouse it's God's Way of making the world see who he is if we break down in the world how will how will they see that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever you said what are you saying brother Brooks let me say it like this it's amazing how God was in Moses y'all agree with that but then when Moses was leading the children of Israel God was in the pillar of fire and the pillar cloud and he still was in Moses huh and guess what Moses though God was in him followed the pillar of cloud by day and the pillar of fire by night hello and though we had the Holy Ghost we ought to follow the pillar of fire because remember now the pillar find the pillar cloud is the same thing it's just a he more faith God changing his mass in night time he changed his match to the fire and in the daytime he changes his master cloud same God it's not to gods though they different appearance there was the same God you see so you and I must understand by God's grace grace God has made us kings and priests now if he made us kings and priests when do we become kings and priests now we are kings and priests now and so therefore every portion of your life your family your workplace whatever you you have you are the king and your workplace don't rule you you must learn how to rule it and when things like that gets out of order guess what you do you bring it back in order is that right that's the first commandment Alama needs to do bring everything on the order your order and that's what God expects us to do why how we do that you speak it you speak the word whether you see it or not the inspiration whatever you said whatever so whatever you ask believing that you will receive it he said it is yours and so you have to speak it but you got a speak it in faith right we have the King's sword we have the King's sword and when God gave us the Kings sword like you've heard me say he did not give us the Kings sword to shave our faces with he understood you and I must know that when the Kings sword is given to you you are going into a battle show me at what point in time at any time in history with the king ever lost the battle it's just a sword it's the word remember the word used to be on the outside but now the word is no longer on the outside the word is on the inside hallelujah why because when Jesus come he comes with his empire he comes with this host of angels remember that now in this Empire has sent you to be a king you have a host of angels the Bible said the angels in camp about us you have angels that works in the other dimension just for you because you can't see doesn't mean that it ain't working God works on the other side because we're limited but your words are not limited your words can penetrate every dimension right Oh when Daniel and were going through something there in Babylon and and never could Ness I'm excuse me and and the three hue people boys was going through something you know Michael went up there at different angels went up there wormwood said let me go and have you seen what's going on down there in Babylon he says yes I've been keeping up with every part of it he heard every word that was said every move that was made and he was waiting for the appointed time for himself to go down so you see God knows your battles he see the conflict and one thing for certain if you're fighting and you seal that battle or that prayer or that word spoken in the name of Jesus Christ brother Ram said when you put it in the name of Jesus Christ is no longer your words it becomes his words all you got to do then is just wait for God to take care of it he will take care of it is that right ah you heard me say I don't have to you know there are times you said well well it's like this somebody is sick too far off and you know I've got to be there you don't have to be there if you're gonna have faith your words will penetrate whatever that dimension is is that right did you call that intercessory prayer too I mean brother Ellen even tells us about intercessory prayer how he went into speaking in tongues and praying and didn't even know what was going on in here it was in the meetings god I'm there to him that at the same time he was praying for this woman God healed her through his prayer and that's what God will do for you when you pray you don't have to be there you your words are there so let me say like this what we don't understand sometimes is that we are not in time we are in eternity we're not in time I know we might feel like it our body is here but our Bible tells us that we are now sitting in heavenly places in Christ Jesus and wherever Christ is there is eternity and wherever Christ is Ian Thorson kind of glory huh that is this I kinda hope is what I've never been in the same kind of glory if you have been in now if you are in Christ you are in the Shekinah glory that's why you cannot die that's why you're continually living you fail because as long as you in the Shekinah glory okay let me say like this Moses and Elijah people said well where were they when they won't mount Transfiguration they weren't in a tent it didn't have a place where there was sheepskin goatskin dividing them they weren't in the temple they were on the mountain and the Bible said that the glory of the Lord overshadowed them what was that they were in the Shekinah glory and when God comes down and understand he meant that God is in you let me ask you something if God is in your heart what is that he's in what glory is in your heart now yocha kind of glory it's the glory of the Lord and so therefore if you can recognize what you are holding inside it would give you such a strength to fight in this battle surely we get tired surely we get was struck by the enemy but the power that's in you just need to be released by the faith that God has given to you that's it it's in there just look just just stop worry about it stop thinking about it and just speak it and believe it and you know the devil he's funny you know he'll make you look as he because you can't you can't work with truly - you can't work with your natural senses and God's sense - if you're gonna work with God says which is the sixth sense you must see like the sixth sense will see like Abraham he called those things that be not as though they were hmm you understand me so you got to believe that way for example when Elijah a man was surrounded about Assyrians and his services Lord they bought them than us but the men said he did not see the angels but by faith he knew they were there and he says Lord open his eyes see because you don't see the Angels doesn't mean they're not there amen tell you the truth they're there when you wake up they there when you go to sleep they're dead during the daytime they did when you don't realize that they're there there but you're royalty royalty king's throne at the door by themselves they always have bodyguards always always you know remember when when when Paul told Timothy just fight be a good soldier you know brother Balaam said like this he said any good soldier is apt to get wounded or hurt good soldiers those who don't are not good soldiers they could always hide and never get hurt but every good soldier get hurt and get wounded but he's still a soldier and he's got a purpose and some time to fight for he rise and try again something to fight for and he arise and try again and any good soldier of the cross would do the same thing rise and fight and try again see and to Joshua the new commandant of the army after Moses had passed on seeing that God stay with him in his mistakes by the time we think because we make mistake God has left us brother I've said God don't really leave me he might pull off on the branch somewhere but he's right there watching you the whole time he'll never leave you nor will he forsake you he said I will always be with you and he never made that conditional ever made it conditional he said I will always be with you that's why you're gonna find people who really gave their heart to the Lord and somewhere that got wounded in the battling and they died and they're going straight to heaven because he promised them it is God who justifies I didn't say bribed I say they'd go straight to heaven God still can do what he wants to do with them we have all sinned and come short of the glory of God brother mama said he taught us that the preacher that got drunk and died God spanked him and put him to sleep and he was saved saw who did what he did and he still was saved so he's got to see him and God has a position and a place an app for every one of us no matter what Moses done it was Moses office that God respected right that's the message as I was with Moses 60 in 1960 right he said listen God respected Moses office he was a prophet he was above all the prophets he was really more than any prophet they had when his own sister laughed at him for men and Ethiopian girl he called them together and he said don't you fear God if there be one among you who is spiritual profit I will speak to him in visions and make myself known in him in dream but it's not with so with Moses high-speed lifts to ear with him and don't you fear God now you shall all brother Brooks that was it you know Miriam she she she was strict with leopard saying and all that but don't you know that was a shadow and the tight because before Marion can be be restored she needed a prophet and a priest to restore her and she was put out for seven days and so when the Jews disrespected Jesus and did what they did they took on the role of Miriam and they were put out for 7,000 years which was a type of seven days and in order for her to be restored she must have a Moses and Elijah Oh y'all didn't get it see because the thing is it is real it was like what Rosa did he smoked the rock when he shouldn't have and that caused a reaction he glorified himself and so Miriam she broke the where when she went against the Prophet and when she spoke the things she spoke she had to pay for it hallelujah and all of Israel because she said they said let let his blood be on us and our children see and what happened God didn't divorce or left Israel and marriage into our woman the same thing Moses did and we fail to see that God's Word is perfect every action brings a reaction hmm but we must understand that when God had brought us into this saw he brought us into a supreme supreme position and we fail to see we are supreme whether you want to believe it or not is true it's true you are the Queen of Heaven the real Queen of Heaven in the Empire that God is established he is king of kings and Lord of lords oh he is and you and I must understand that is this a government it is a supreme power that's governing it not some secondary secondary that means there's nothing higher than the authority of the word of God and his kingdom that's why he said to you whatsoever you say if you say to this mountain be thou moved us the Empire that's the kingdom power if he said Amen whatever you say whatever you believe he said you could cast out Devils in my name he said this is the power of the Empire hallelujah amen where he says his King and he makes sure that everything spoken comes to pass especially when you are being anointed by him he said well oh brother I don't know about that allowed you got madnesses Lord and then all of a sudden this bear comes and eat all these kids huh and you got to realize that even during that time there was a man by the name of naman who needed washing and naman was a Gentile man didn't know nothing about Israel didn't even know that Elijah message was Damascene but there was a young girl with no name the Bible doesn't give her a name like a bride like a people chosen to be bride so how you didn't know you don't know about Elijah see you got to realize that by God's grace that we are in a place that we're that little girl with no name we heard all the things that Elijah they've done and have done and we bear witness and we believe it but there is somebody here like mainland you know what I'm saying I told you how to be humble but they're Christians just like that why would I have to wash in the Jordan what do you see all these other rivers why can't I go there I can't join your group like that hallelujah and this little girl said well let me ask you a question what home isn't gonna do with you you are leopard hallelujah a leopard amen that was a judgment sign there was a sign of sin in somebody's life your leopard you know that's what's happening with a lot of the people in the message they'd only realize they're lepers they may have position like naming Authority but stricken and they still got to wash in the Jordan not one time you gotta get got seven times dip down in there seven times and the Bible said that when he did dip guess what happened he came forth clean it was like a resurrection that's what he Lodge of ministry does it brings the resurrection it brings a quickening a new life to you that's what is the effect if you now have a new life somewhere you're missing that they react the action of the word but it's supposed to change you the first Elijah did what he got caught up he went to heaven he lies to calm and what happens amen y'all remember the story I'm on a different thought but anyway it's still a kingdom in that little boy lay men that got caught up and and and you know sometimes we work for the father and we get sunburn or son strokes all of a sudden we faint we die whatever you call it but it's just the appearance of death but one thing for certain Elijah rod didn't work and his staff didn't mark and nothing would work coat whatever he was sending to this woman so he had to come himself and I heard this from someone which is so powerful to me that when he lied you're laid down evidently the boy had grown he was no longer just a baby but he had come to the Statue of a man because he couldn't have been there and allowed to lay on him in his hand in his hand and the feet in his feet in his mouth and his mouth he had to be the equivalent side of it of Elijah that's what this message would do to you it brings you to the equivalent size of Elijah that's the Christ any large and Elijah for all they had to come to a full statue of Christ and you and I must come to a full statue of Christ where our eyes meet our nose meet our mouths meet our hands meet our feet me right and I looked up the word that Bible said then he then he sneech seven times and sneezing is getting ready to getting rid of the irritations there's something in you that's irritating you it makes you sneeze whether it's dust pollen or whatever it is and that's what the seven thunders make you do that's what the life of Christ bring you into each it makes you get rid of every irritation hello remember that God told Israel said if you don't kill them they will become what a thorn in your flesh it will become an irritation right it irritates you when you say well I don't I don't have the faith that I should have huh it irritates you when you find yourself weak in the virtue is not there you don't even feel like praying for somebody because you feel like you don't have the virtue it takes it imitates you when you see all these things coming up and you know it and that's what guess what it kills you it gives you the appearance of you being dead but what you need God to do is lay himself upon you you need God amen to put his mouth on your mouth and his hands and you know what I'm saying we need to go back to Calvary because that's where you get the victory back at Calvary right so let's move on by God's grace I won't be too much longer God wants to fill all of us listen brother mem said in the wilderness of God he said the Holy Ghost that wrote the word will bear Rick record with every word and the same thing that the Holy Ghost did in the Old Testament he will do in the New Testament he Hey come on somebody so you can say oh that was just Old Testament knew everything he did back there he can do it today right that's right he will do it in the new testament will do just the same thing because Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and you're not yoked with organization and the world you're not yoked with them you you're your yoke yourself not to not among them but come out from among them ye are yoked to Christ yoked to the Lord Jesus Christ alright I'm almost done just just to start because I'm bringing this thing Institute to bring us to a place of unity you know because we come to church and sit in this building you know it's not a sign of unity because our unity is not supposed to be fleshly it's spirit united in the spirit by one spirit are we baptized into one body right and so you and I must understand amen that we are to be yoked by the Holy Spirit but if we're lacking the Holy Spirit how can we be yoked it takes the Holy Spirit to bring us into one unity and when that union is there we care for each other we feel for each other when Peter was thrown in jail they call a prayer meeting and everybody showed up except Peter because he was in jail but he was praying not only praying but he was singing you understand me they were such an empire listen you can't be on the you know in the army and you you you own the frontline and all of a sudden you decide you want to run the OP is that direction what a disgrace what it's discounted it to your fellow servants when you fight you fight to die you coming this thing he meant to fight with it's not not with each other but against the devil who's fighting us Satan is our enemy so it's amazing because I got this quotient and the brother brother spoke why I'll speak I've only listened to that I haven't yet coming from oneness and I'm a closest on that see what we don't want is fake fake religion we want to be a part of this Empire and the only way we can be a part of this Empire has to be baptised in the Holy Ghost and that only Ghost baptism is supposed to be done every day we should strive and seek the baptism of the Holy Ghost every day until we are completely sealed and in the very image of God you just oh I I received him ten years ago well you and you're in bad shape that's you can recall that time right it's supposed to be a baptism every day a washing every day a fire washing you not water fire all right Oh God how could I think when the church was on the move when Moses got a little scared down there at the sea he began to cry to the Lord and the Lord said why are you crying to me what for you cried to me speak and go forward and I believe that's where we are why are you crying to God so much why well you know me what for are you crying - it's true mom I always say you keep crying like that I'm gonna give you something to cry for huh you better stop that nothing says right remember that quote I read that long there's been a time where been said that God sometimes feel like kicking you around well the unbelief that we have may God have mercy on us oh please don't kick complete seriously kick me my right I don't know what a kick from God would be like but I sure don't want to know you know the world of God it's in you speak and go forward see we is how can I say it I don't know who all been in the Apostolic or the Pentecostal churches we get all messed up with feelings because we feel it and those feelings can be so wrong that's why you have all these women preachers because they feel it yes the anointing is the anointing but their knowledge will never allow you to cross the word oh I feel it and God came in and a wind came in and what and the devil can mimic all of that what feelings has to do with it I felt in it that's the same oh oh you see they get into the speaking in tongues and everything that they speak in tongues and and and that's all God you don't even know if it's dark because you can't you don't even know what's being saying ain't no interpreter so you don't know what you're saying you could be cursing God and don't even know it but it feels good it's the truth and to be honest which if that were if that only goes don't cope with the word of the hour it's not the only goes something else mimic itself mimicking anyway the Lord God today I come in the name of the Lord Jesus I come yielding the sword of faith claiming the oneness of God and man by the Holy Ghost through the mercies and the sacrifice of Jesus Christ his son I defy every devil that but that's bound anybody in any way in this building whether he be boy or girl man or woman I defy every sickness I defy every doubt I defy every fear I defy everything that's ungodly leave the audience in the name of Jesus Christ come out of audience that we can be one with God and can serve God without sickness or fear may the power that made made us one with God how can the devil squall him himself around this art anointed how can the devil stand out there and squall himself like a Goliath when David come into the campus that you mean you let that uncircumcised Philistine stand there and defy the army of the Living God don't you understand we cannot allow Satan could detector to continue to cause us to lose the battles he's there for us to defeat him not for him to defeat us Goliath didn't win he didn't win he didn't he wasn't a winner yesterday and he'll never be the winner history has already declared his defeat and he was a shouter and type of the devil hello and David was a shadow on the type of God and by the spoken word David defeated Goliath before he cut his head off he had already spoken it and if you believe it like that before you get to the victory you get the victory before you get there he was no coward man fact he believed in what he spoke because he knew God was with him he knew he was a part of God's Empire hallelujah and he knew somehow God was gonna make it happen he had no sword but he's spoken I'm gonna cut your head off today and the man had no sword all he had was a little sling and in five stones see you don't have to have visible things right before you to sit declare your victory God is your victory in Christ alone is your victory you don't have to see nothing you don't have to feel nothing you just got to know that you are part of God and God put you here to defeat the enemy to do I'll put him under your feet and we're not we should you know people are so afraid you know you know they try to they handle things by themselves when you've gone through problems and they've seen it overwhelm you that's what brothers and sisters are for call in another troupe oh it's not meant for you to handle these things all by yourself oh god make men and women rise in the power of the Spirit let that unconverted that dejected devil that harm the human race down through a stand here in defy the Church of the Living God Satan come out and leave in the name of Jesus Christ one man but he knew his grounds he knew where he stood in the kingdom and that same Holy Ghost are saying know where you stand in the kingdom young or old you still powerful when God is in you hmm you love the Lord one more quote but as they thus said the Lord stay with the word to separate from it is breaking your spirit your fellowship with God God's oneness by the Holy Spirit then if you say you've got the Holy Spirit and it's not and agree with the word then you're not one nest with God this is God's oneness the Spirit that you got agrees with the word and manifests this word and makes this word powerful to act the same way it did there right it's the truth piece of well you know you know how they say it I I got some friends who are women preachers they know I don't agree with it but they said well what about that woman you know at the well she went in g toh aisi she wouldn't testify that's a difference between preaching and testifying if those people would have caught it that she was she was preaching they would have stone them in that day a woman white wasn't support sheeple to keep veiled but they saw that something happened to this woman and she said and listen she they come see the man in this Messiah they probably listened but when she heard when they say is invisible aya something struck those people and they ran to goes in because they were looking for the Messiah yeah it's nothing wrong with witnessing an innate or how many I don't know why I'm going there but that's just what they do you can't tell them well you know I wonder what it's written I think that's a malachi wherever this is the woman's supposed to surpass the man a lady told me that hey Holy Spirit say Mary just like that because I had not seen the scripture and the Holy Spirit says Mary I said that's right Mary didn't need a man she surpassed him they have Jesus she bypassed him she didn't have the man she had Christ but they think that she can excel is she gonna become a bishop let's stand I don't know how somebody must be listening that need to hear but let me tell y'all something people of God God do not break his order for no man for no one and you and I we know throughout history did a lot of things in ignorance but now God says he's no longer wink at ignorance God has brought the word for our day and God has brought this word so that we can see and understand what he's doing you understand me there's nothing wrong with a woman prophesy in the sense when the Holy Spirit is on her but she's not a preacher many times though when brother Branham was here with those women who was gifted they'd always got in the way I always wanted the man position that's what the devil offered now she is surpassed us in the sense of the world she owns everything she's on every image you know I mean she's just the goddess of this world and you and I must understand that's not right and in order to hold a standard you know what these are well how can you oh I don't hurt let me tell you something I was my witness I have her and I've seen a woman beautiful woman I'll preach almost every man I've ever seen a man Oh anointed went from Genesis of Revelation even preached on the baptism in the name of Jesus Christ but I don't care the word says she ain't supposed to do it he didn't say she couldn't that's telling them a person who has the voice of singing you can't sing no every one of us a woman has the ability a man can have the ability to preach and if he's not called he's in trouble it's got to be God see what I'm saying and more or less when you say oh brother goes well you say no I don't know I just know that that's what I must say I look at this tire world and I says Lord who gonna stand and we don't stand we are the witnesses of God look how many we got in here not that many even among us people are dying and that dead in their seats and don't even know it people don't even know it because they come to church and stuff like that and they don't realize that power that you know if it ain't dead it's almost there and if you don't fight to keep it alive Satan will because you got to understand you got hot coal and lukewarm in this age he said I would that you be hot or cold lukewarm that's no so you got to understand you and I are in a time when God says okay regroup regroup know what I've called you to do no amen where God plant you bloom right you don't come here just say you know you come to bloom be part of all of us has a ministry even the young kids everybody has a ministry and you need to know what it is it is not to be in here to observe the old people you're here to do something if it end up and to recite or the sing or to do something God has you here for a purpose then we saw you 19 and it stopped focusing on what God wants us to do we'll still be out like this and Satan gonna continue to battle us and feed us practically because we're not United that's pray father God we thank you for your grace in your mercy we thank you for being so good to us you've been better to us and we have been to ourselves father I pray Lord Jesus that you have preeminence here Lord God forgive us and cleanse us from all unrighteousness Lord Lord we spoke that what you would have us to speak and Lord we know Lord God that gifts and callings are without repentance many people have gifts but Lord are they called to do them help us now give us grace strengthen us Lord in your lovely name Jesus Christ we pray amen I got a mind to do right a God of mine to do right I got a mind to do right every day since Jesus gave me this man who you made fashion brought him into this life Lord Jesus you taught us

time of Moses and Moses was the word Janus and Jambres were those who mimicked the word you understand me and they were able to do miracles signs and wonders but they couldn't create and that's what's happening in to this day we see the Spirit of Janice and Janice but it also encourages us because we know this is an exodus they manifested themselves at the time of the exit exodus so be encouraged it is what it is every seed must bring forth of its kind you love the Lord to do wrong I go to Mantua I got a mind to run every day since Jesus gave me this Mantua I got a mind to run every day I got
