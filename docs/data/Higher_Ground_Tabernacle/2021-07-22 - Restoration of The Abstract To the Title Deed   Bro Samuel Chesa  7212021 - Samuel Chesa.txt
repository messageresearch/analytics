standing let us open our bibles to the book of um genesis chapter 1 and verse 26. genesis chapter 1 verse 26 says and god said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth so god created man in his own image in the image of god created he him male and female created he them and god blessed them and god said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over every living thing that moved upon the earth and god said behold i have given you every herb bearing seed which is upon the face of the earth and every tree and the witch is a fruit of a tree yielding seed to you it shall be for meat let us bow heads and pray dear gracious heavenly father we have read your word oh lord just like any man can but it only takes you lord to come in and open your word and reveal it to us oh god we know those two men who were going to emmaus lord they could not realize that it was you until you opened until you broke that bread and gave it to them lord here we are gathered this evening oh lord not gathered unto any man or unto any organization but gathered unto your name only because we know if we call upon your name lord you will answer if we call on your name you will come down lord this is our simple petition lord tonight we're asking you father may you come down in our midst lord may you break the bread of the word of life oh god to us so that we you may be made men known and may be made manifest unto us lord that's our prayer and that's our heart's desire lord we commit the whole service into your hand saying father may you pour down your anointing may you just give unction oh god unto his words oh lord i give you all the glory and all the honor in jesus christ's name i pray believing amen let me take all seeds amen for a short time i want to speak on this uh subject the restoration of the abstract to the title amen when we were reading in genesis chapter 1 in verse 28 we realize that god gave dominion to man over the fish of the sea and over the fall of the air and over every living thing that moved upon the earth that was after god created man after he created adam and eve and then he gave to them the dominion over the earth to say you are the lords of this earth whatever you say it shall be done and then we realize adam had dominion over all creeping things he started naming animals god did not finish the whole creation he left part of it for adam to finish which was naming every living creature whenever adam will say you are going to be called a lion god will say amen when adam will say you shall be called an elephant god said amen he had left that part to adam he gave adam that dominion this is because adam he had that book that title deed that god had when he gave him the dominion amen the abstract to the title which is the right to the title deed amen so the prophet of god will tell us that when adam would change the course of the flowing of a river if he decides i don't like the way you are flowing you move from east to west i want you to move from the west to the north the river would listen to him because he had that authority he had that title deed that had been handed to him by god amen and every time he would tell the wind i don't like the way you were blowing you change your direction and go that way the wind would obey the voice of adam because he had the title deed he was made in the image of god the man that was made in the image of god was the spirit man the one that god breathed into adam amen so he had absolute authority over nature that god had given to him he had the abstract title deed to the earth and each and every one of god's creation we know an abstract is a title this is the right to the title that you have it gives a track record of that title of all the people who ever owned it and everything that has to do with that title that's what the abstract is and adam had it so he was using it to his own advantage and he was finishing the creation of godhead and god had set the earth to go that way for men to live by the spoken word god men were supposed to give birth we're supposed to multiply he gave them that that he gave them that commandment and they were supposed to do that by the spoken word this was because they had the dominion the abstract of the title was in adam's hands amen but we realize that adam willingly when eve was deceived by the serpent adam willingly fell and he gave up this abstract title and he no longer have dominion and the prophet of god earlier on when i was reading he said when adam fell he lost that title and satan took a hold of it but after 63 after the full opening of the word the prophet of god comes back again and said no satan did not touch it he could not put his dirty hands on that title god took it back when adam fell amen satan is not the rightful owner of that deed so when men fell the book went back to god and he held it back he was waiting for the right time to give it back to man so in genesis chapter 3 verse 15 it says god was cursing the serpent and he was giving the curse after the fall and he said and i will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed it shall bruise thy head and thou should bruise his heel here god was already putting a prophecy for the way back of that title did to come back into the hands of man and we know that the seed of the woman that was being talked about here was jesus christ himself he was the one who was set god whom he had ordained before the foundation of the world that he was the one who had to take back that title that title did to take back that book and give it back into the hands of the bride the prophet of god says in uh the breach he says now the forfeited title deed is now in the hands of the original honor almighty god the title deed to the earth and to eternal life when adam forfeeded it then satan's dirty hands could not take it so it went back to the original honor and that was god himself and now he sits on the throne with it in his hands the title did to eternal life the abstract title did to eternal life when adam fulfilled it for wisdom instead of faith it went back into the hands of the owner almighty god what a great thing god took it back he says satan you cannot touch it he trusted man and he says you have failed i'm now taking matters back into my own hands and by that when they lost dominion over every living thing when they lost dominion over nature man could no longer have any control he could no longer have the power of the spoken word because he had lost the abstract to the title he no longer had rights to that title deed god had taken it back and we see the earth people were raffled by sicknesses people were ravished by death violence and everything was there man was out of control because the title deed had been taken from the hands of man and god had taken back to him and adam and eve they were kicked out of the garden of eden and he says you are not coming back because you have failed and then he kicked them out and they could not come back in this was because of the disobedience of adam they wanted to use wisdom over faith we are not supposed to do that we are never supposed to reason the word when the word comes you take it to your heart don't take it to your head every time you take it to your head satan is going to come and reason it out that's what eve did he stayed long she stayed long enough with the devil never do that the devil is not your friend any conversation you have with the devil shun him away every time the devil starts talking to you just give him the word that word will let him go you know satan tried to tempt jesus although he was the almighty god living in the in the flesh he was using the word to overcome satan when satan tried to say you turned stones into bread jesus said no i'm not doing that why he used the word thou shall not tell the lord thy god he knew the power he knew the authority that was in the word amen so when satan comes to try you with that same technique use the word it has worked over and over again and it will still work and it will give you victory so we realized adam and eve they were supposed to be they were supposed to be immortal but because of the fall they started aging they started dying and we see all the bad things that started coming on the earth the earth was the the earth was now reacting to this fall the earth was bringing forth thistles tissues were never part of the original creation and we see the weather change climate change and they started having winter now we are all suffering the bad winters because of the fall i know brother brooks doesn't like the winter it's really bad it's really bad here in iowa that was because of the fall but we thank god that there is going to be a time when we go back we are never going to see no no winter no more we are not going to see no thistles no more when we go back to where we come from amen and everything is returned back to its original state so men started aging adam and eve became immortal and that's after the fall and everything started going seemingly started going to go sideways but that was god's original plan he had everything pre-determined before the foundation of the world amen and the man started sinning and every time men were sinning they were putting a lot of claims on this book there was a lot of debt that was that was uh accumulating on this book of the title deed yeah all the way 4 000 years going up until when jesus came down this claim had so much debt on it that the only way the debt could be removed there had to be a killing there had to be a sacrifice and the only sacrifice that was going to be there was of a being that was greater than human beings we know in the old testament when those sages of old when they would sin they would sacrifice lambs and goats and bulls but we know that the blood of an animal is lower the life of an animal is lower than of a man so it could not atone for the sins that blood only covered those sins it only took the blood of jesus a man who never died a man who never sinned to come and atone for all those sins amen so we humanity ended up we ended up owing a debt that we could not pay but god he was there he was willing to pay a debt that he did not owe hey man the prophet god says you say i bought a piece of ground it is not yours yet until you got an abstract but if you got an abstract it shows that everything was ever against that piece of land has been stricken off so you can hold that title but you don't have the abstract which is the right to the title you cannot exercise that title until all the deaths that's accumulated to that title has been paid off so you are just holding it but you have no power you have no power in it and god was trying to create and make a way back to bring back the power to you and me to bring back the power into the hands of the bride amen we realized throughout the all the four thousand years from adam all those great prophets moses abraham isaac jacob and all of them no one was worthy to put a claim to pay the debt of on this claim no one was worthy to take that book because that book had gone back into the hands of god and he was holding it waiting for that person that man was able to clear up that debt and take back that book to him amen and we realized through the the typing uh in the in the book of um of ruth that boaz was not the closest king to ruth and we know that satan was our closest kin god was not he was further so satan was the one who had the first right to come and clear up that debt he was the one who had the first right to come and claim you and me but he was not willing to shed his blood because he knows he knew the moment he dies he's not coming back up so he say he washed his hands and he says not me he says not me and he walked away amen and then god was there he saw that satan could not make it god was not panicking he knew that satan would not do it because he is the one who created him he knew all the abilities he knows all the abilities and disabilities that satan has so he was not worried at all i believe he was just folding his hands waiting for satan to walk out of the game and say i have lost i cannot do this and that was only god who could do it amen so god was trying to create a way back and all those sages all those prophets no one else could do it but god he said i have to come down i have to become a man and walk down i have to die that's why he created a body of flesh a man a body that never sinned whom he called his son jesus and he decided to dwell in that body and the prophet of god says that jesus in him he was a hundred percent man and he was a hundred percent god when he was walking right there so when he was walking on the earth he experienced everything that you and me could ever experience he got to be hungry at some point in time he was rejected he was shunned away so he knows that feeling he was a man so there is no feeling that you can ever go through that god does not know just you approach to him in his word he says in jeremiah he says i know when you are crying you are in pain you are right there god says i know he suffered the biggest rejection there was he was his closest friend his closest body would took him taken out a knife and cut the soldiers who were trying to come to him he knew he was going to deny him three times if it was judas who was going to deny christ he already knew it he was he was a traitor but now look peter the one whom he was going to hand the keys he says i do not know this man none at all he denied him three times but judas only denied christ once so we see this is a matter of grace it's not how good you are but it is because before the foundation of the world he predestinated you and me hallelujah so despite whatever wrong you're gonna do it's not how much wrong you're gonna do but it is because you already selected you and you put your name in the book of life to say this is my son this is my daughter nothing is going to happen to you no matter how many times you sin no matter how many times you do wrong god has that way prepared for you to come back because he has predestinated you as a son he has predestinated you as a daughter amen so the way back he had created he it had to take the second adam i think it's in first corinthians 15 what paul is talking about that christ was the second adam it had to be a man because it was god cannot die so he was not going to be able to die to redeem it it had to take a man and jesus christ came down with this one mission which was to take back the book and give it back to the bride so he came down as the second adam a way that god had prepared already before the foundation of the world you know god knows the beginning from the end so there is nothing that worries him god is never surprised you and me we can be surprised but god is never surprised that's why we have to have faith in god i had one person say the amount of faith that you have is determined by the credibility of the person who says it if a liar tells you gives you a promise that i'm going to give you a hundred dollars tomorrow you're not going to believe them because of their character so the amount of faith you have in a person is determined by the character of that person so you are not going to trust it but now when someone who has always come through on his word when they tell you they are going to do it you can sleep all night you do not have to worry because you know that they are going to do it now what more about god when god says something in his word he is going to come through for you he will never fail in his word but it has to come to pass amen when god speaks it has to happen that's why we gotta trust him that's why we gotta trust god because he is not a man that he should lie neither is he a son of man that he should repent but he always comes through on his word amen so jesus was the man that god had created and that was the first creation of god he already pre-planned everything before the foundation of the world and he says you are the second adam he is the one who is going to claim the book he was the only one who was worthy amen amen and that's why he came down and he accepted the mission and he said lord as a man he said i cannot see this because god the prophet god tells us that when he went up on the mount uh transfiguration he saw the whole calvary he saw the whole calvary experience that's why when he was in the garden of gethsemane he was there crying and he could not handle it until he had sweat of blood because he knew the the amount how hard the task was before him but he said lord not my will but yours he knew that if it was not if it's not me then who he saw you today two thousand years ago that's what compelled him to go to that cross he saw you seated here tonight he saw you where you are he saw your sickness that was troubling you he saw your harsh desire and he says although i'm going to get those lashes despite lord not my will but yours and he submitted himself and he was willing to go on the cross of calvary because he knew that this mission no one else was able to do it but he is only the rightful person and the only man who was worthy to redeem back humanity to where he was supposed to be and he came he bled and he died he shed his blood he fulfilled the requirements of that was required to clear up all the debt so the book that god had been holding back throughout all those 4 000 years and it had a lot of debt before it could go back to humanity jesus said i'm going to pay for it i'm paying for it with my life i'm paying it for it with my blood that's why when you went there he gladly said he said it is finished what was he saying in other words he was saying father mission accomplished i have done it i have cleared that debt your sins you see you and me we were not born yet so your sins before you committed them he had already pardoned them and the ones you're going to commit later on in the future he already cleared those up so you cannot walk in the condemnation of the devil you gotta walk you say i am free god said i am free nothing can hold me back not only am i free not only am i sinless but i never done it in the first place i am justified amen imagine someone comes to you and they say um i forgive you for slapping me you cannot forgive me for slapping you because i did not do it i did not slap you in the first place so you cannot forgive me because it didn't happen that's what justification means you never done it in the first place so that's why we can walk knowing that there is no condemnation to us those who have received christ because we know the moment you repent it is removed god cannot remember it i had one testimony one brother went to um brother brown and he said every time i kneeled down to pray he had committed sins before he said every time i kneel down to pray i'm condemned about what i did long back then and i have to kneel down and confess over and over and over again multiple times i pray you know what brother branham told him he says you know what every time you kneel down god is hearing it for the first time because he cannot remember it so if you repent wholeheartedly god cannot remember it so that's why we can walk free knowing that there is no condemnation to us amen and we know god this the book that he was holding jesus had to accomplish this mission first he had to shed his blood and then he had to go and take up the book because he was the only man who was worthy in this book we know god was sitting on the throne and it was sealed with seven seals waiting for the only man that was worthy to claim it no one was found worthy to receive this deed of inheritance but jesus alone so in we read in revelations uh chapter five in verse one it says and i saw in the right hand of him that said on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with seven seals and i saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to lose the seals thereof and no man in heaven no in earth neither under the earth was able to open the book neither to look there on no one was worthy and none of the elders said unto and one of the elders said unto me weep not behold the lion of the tribal judah the root of david hath prevailed to open the book and to lose the seals thereof jesus was the well he was the lion of the tribal judah the root of david the only man who was able to open up this book the only man was able to open up these seals and we see john was looking at this this was he was seeing behind that was in time everyone had been created so we cannot say other people were created afterwards after after jesus died who could come and claim it no one could remember john was seeing the 24 24 elders and he was one of those 24 elders so he was seeing his theophany over there so everyone had been created already so there is no man born by a man or woman that was able to take up this book so do not let anyone lie to you that someone else opened these seals it was only jesus christ and christ himself and he says the lion of the tribal judah the root of david had to prevail to open that book and to lose the seven seals and behold law in the midst of the throne and the full beast and in the midst of the eldest to the lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the spirits seven spirits of god sent forth to all the earth and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that set upon the throne that was the lamb of god he was the only one and he went and he took that book because he had cleared up all the debt that he had accumulated over time and the debt that was going to be owed afterwards he said i have made provision of that already that's why when he rose up on the third day he rose up triumphant he knew he had overcome death hell and the grave and he came up and he stood there he rose up as the mighty conqueror he knew who he was he paid the sins he paid for all the sins of the old testament saints abraham's lying davis uh adultery and all of them jesus paid for them that's why when they were sealed in uh in paradise when he rose up he went and he emptied the whole paradise why because he had gotten back the book he was holding the book in his hands he had that authority that's why all those saints were seen walking on earth for 40 days and they were seeing uh there was they were seeing abraham adam jacob and all those saints of old why they were happy because the lamb was the only one who was worthy to open the book and he emptied up all paradise and they rose up and they had a body change and they were raptured into the air amen and he changed them from paradise and put them in the sixth dimension why because he had the book he had that authority of the title amen i read the prophet of god says what is this book of redemption this title did abstract title did you say abstract what does abstract mean it searched all the way back to its beginning like that it's just like the drop of ink when it's uh dropped in bleach it disappears when sin has been confessed and fallen into the blood of jesus christ it gives that abstract right straight back to the creator again you become a son of god abstract title deed is held in the hands of almighty its redemption means all legal possessions to all that was lost by adam and eve so the dominion that we read in genesis earlier on when he took back the book it was being given back to you and me all those possessions that adam and eve had lost it was given back to each and every born a green christian its legal possession to that abstract deed the deed to eternal life means that you possess everything that adam and eve lost think about it brother the possession of that deed hey man that's the power of that deed the abstract the rights given back to the deed the dominion over nature dominion over all creation dominion over our body dominion over all atmosphere and not only that but dominion over demons dominion over the devils because the abstract the rights to the book of the title was given back to man when jesus christ rose again amen and we thank god it took a profit to make us understand the contents of this book right it was traced all the way back before creation it was that god had already made a provision amen and we know william branham did not open those seals it was christ who did he just gave that understanding to him so that him as the prophet would see it and he would give it to the bride you and me so those seals are for you they are for me so we have to take it and walk in to our god-given right we have to walk into our god-given inheritance and take it because we know that book that's what we need for our victory amen but we realize many people they try to put we see the spirit coming down all the way from nimrod and all paganism coming down and they try to put someone else to be uh a mediator between between between god and man but the only mediator any person who can be a mediator they have to die for you before a person can mediate for any of your prayers or mediate for anything they have to die because the team of the says for there is one god and one mediator between god and man and that man is christ jesus in hebrews 9 15 it says and for this course he is the mediator of the new testament that by means of death for the redemption of the transgression that we're under the first testament they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance so there is no mediator without death there is no mediator without the shedding of blood so the catholic church can tell you that pope he is the vicar that's not true only jesus is the mediator he is the only one who can stand there he said for you to go to the father you have to come through me i am the only way to go to him so muhammad is not the way to god buddha is not the way to god i repeat the pope is not the way to god but it is only jesus we realize each and every organization they try to put someone right there the moment they try to put someone right there just know your prayer is going nowhere that's where all is finished all your harsh desires they are finished right there you are just telling another human being and we see the message is also not prone it's it's it's not immune to this system people want to put a mediator between people and god that does not work that is any any spirit that tries to put a mediator between god and man that's the spirit of antichrist and that will not work the only person who can stand right there is jesus and jesus christ himself the prophet was there to point us to jesus christ and that's where we look up to because he is the one who is going to give us that book he is the only one who was worthy to take it and give it to us and give us back the right of that title amen people trying to trivialize god by by praying to mary hail mary and all that that does not work we only pray to god and the only way to go to god is through jesus amen read the prophet and you see the mediator of the new testament and now i want to read um the prophet of god says when you've become a christian listen god provide a place of worship and when you become a christian and accept christ as your savior then when god sends down the abstract it shows you that no matter what your father did or your mother did what anybody else did your mother daddy might have been drunkards prostitutes whatever it was every scene is tricking off you've got an abstract title there's nothing that can put you off of it so your past cannot define your future your past does not define you the person who gave birth to you does not define who you are so what matters is your name is written in the book that's the contents of the book before the foundation of the world your name was put in the book amen before you were born jeremiah god told jeremiah that before you were formed in the belly of your mother i had known you i remember one brother he was he he was he he was uh struggling he didn't understand he was saying i don't know you know my parents uh he had he had a bad background he didn't know where he was coming from but this is the quote right there it is telling you it does not matter who your parents were so long your name was written in the book you have to get your own personal salvation even if you were born in the message you have to be born by the blood you have to be born by jesus christ himself amen god does not have grandchildren you have to have your own personal experience it doesn't matter who probably you have three generations in the message that does not save you either you have to have your own experience because that own experience you're going to recognize that my name is in the book and when you recognize that my name is in the book you are entitled to that title deed you are entitled to the abstract of that title deed amen that's what we gotta know in the revelations chapter 10 verse 8 says and the voice which i heard from heaven spake unto me again and said go take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth this was a commandment to to john and we know john was a tap of the bride right so the bride is being commanded he says and i went unto the angel and unto him and said give me the little book and he said unto me take it and eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter and he shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey can you go to verse 10. and he says and i took the little book out of the angel's hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as i eaten it my belly was bitter can you give us verse eight and the voice which i heard from heaven speak unto me again and say go and take that little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth that was the covenant angel the all the debt had been cleared out the book was now ready to be given back to the bride so the bride is getting that commandment you go take up that book and you eat it we know we become what we eat so when you take that book which is the word and you eat it you become the word because that's what you were supposed to amen that book was not meant for god when god gave that book for adam it was for men to use but he had taken it up because adam had lost it so now he was finding a way to give it back to man and now this was the opportune time after jesus had cleared the debt and he took it and now he is giving it to the bride to say you take the book you eat it up because that is yours so now john is representing the bride and we know we gotta eat the book we gotta listen to the word of god we gotta study those scriptures because that's what how we're gonna know what authority we have we're gonna know we have authority over devils we got authority over our own bodies we have authority over our trials why because the book tells us the abstract it tells us the authority that we have amen so that's why we gotta constantly hear the voice of god constantly hear the word of god constantly study the word of god because this book is for a special people called the bride and we here when we listen to that word we hear the voice of god everyone else they don't hear the voice of god do you remember when paul when he was on his road to damascus and that great light shone and then there was that thunder and he fell off the i don't know what he was writing donkey or mew and he fell down the people who were around him they did not hear a voice they just had thunder why because it was not meant for them it was meant for paul so each and every generation there is a people who are selected to hear the voice of god there is a people who are selected to hear what god is saying for that age and we know in this last day we have a light that appeared in this day many people don't know what that light is pretty sure it is you find it over the internet and everywhere but people don't know what it is and when they hear that prophet speak they just hear things they don't know what it is but because you and me we are that bride we can tell that that's a god speaking through the voice of a man and we take it for us because you and me we are the people who are selected to listen to this word we are the people we are the bride who has to take this book and eat it up so we know who we are amen because we did not become sons you and me we do not become sons and daughters when we got converted when we gave our life to christ no we became sons before the foundation of the world but when you met when you made that decision to say i want christ to be my personal savior that was you realizing that you were a son so it had already happened you were only waiting for that time when god was going to remove scales on your eyes and realize who you were and realize your true identity that you know i am a son of god but you were a son already before the foundation of the world amen so we gotta walk in that light knowing who we are we gotta walk knowing that we are sons and daughters of god we have the abstract of that book we have the authority over this earth we have the authority of the nature amen amen the prophet god says in um in god's provide a place of worship he says now a crinsman he handed the seventh sealed book of redemption from the original honor when we lost it in the garden of eden through adam it went back to the original honor but there's been a portrait on the land a squatter and that's satan he came over he is a torture the earth does not belong to him it belongs to god but satan is the portrait he is a squatter he does not deserve to live there the earth was created for men to dwell there and have dominion over all living things so but now we know satan as the god of this evil age that's not his rightful place he's trying to take our positions he is trying to take our rights he's trying to take our dominion but he is a poacher he is a squatter and he is not the rightful owner of that place amen and you see that title deed of our redemption it gives us back that authority and when he broke those seals it reveals and gives us the inheritance to his people he gives the inheritance that he inherited becoming the kinsmen redeemer and he freely gives it to us it all belonged to him he was the one who redeemed hey man but instead of keeping it for himself he gave it back to the people because the book was not for god to keep the book was for you and me to use amen hallelujah and we were just reading that satan is a torture he is not the rightful owner you know if if you had if you had uh if you had a piece of land and there is a title due to it maybe the there is a lot of debt that happened and is taken away from you and that someone else comes in and move on that land maybe it was a bear land and they start building whatever they're building and they take over land now it's theirs but one thing they forgot the title deed has your name on it you are the rightful honor to that title deed so you can go back anytime all you need if there is a land dispute they ask for the title deed they're asking who has the title deed and when they get the title d they're going to open it and check the abstract all the names that are written in that title did and the last name if your last name is there and your name is in that title deed it doesn't matter whom you were arguing with or whom you're having a conflict with that person has to leave they are legally a squatter it doesn't matter that title deed might be getting it might be so old and it's almost tearing up what matters is is your name there and i'm here to tell you that that book that christ opened the seals your name was there before the foundation of the world so you're right god's promises they are yours satan might be has been trying to block you and say no don't go there but i'm here to tell you you go walk right into it that is your god-given inheritance that is your god-given right it doesn't matter how the devil has been there whoever the people were did they already build buildings and they put some valuation to it and they put their names maybe they say we are the will sons i hope there's no wilson listening to it to this and they say we are the wilsons it doesn't matter they have fenced it around and put a wall around it if you just have a deed you gotta walk in right there and you say this is my land this is my property and the government the law enforcement has to back you up because the law see you can enforce it the law has to enforce the squatters off your land and we are glad we have the holy ghost as our enforcer it never fails hey man so all those promises of god i'm walking in with that title dude i know i'm telling satan you live of that land that is my rightful place christ paid for it with his blood before the foundation of the world he put my name in his will and he said that is mine so i'm taking it up and i'm saying it is mine i don't care how satan has been staying there it is time for you to leave you gotta tell him satan this is my land you go maybe satan has been sitting on your health for so long he's been sitting on your health for 20 years that does not matter the title deed says by my stripes you were healed so you walk in and you say satan get off my health that is my rightful property that is my rightful inheritance god says it is mine amen in isaiah says no weapon formed against you shall prosper and right after that scripture says that's the inheritance to god's children that's our inheritance so nowhere performed against you shall prosper that is an inheritance which is in the book so you gotta take it and you walk in and you say satan the weapon you're formed against me it is not going to work i have the right to enforce it i have the holy ghost backing me up it has to enforce it you gotta go you ain't staying you probably been fighting trials addictions for so long and the satan is sitting right there he has already changed and you don't think you can go free anymore but that does not matter at all just take the title data and you walk you can start pacing around the whole perimeter because you know i own this land it is mine the deed says it is mine my name is written there so satan you gotta go i don't care how long you've lived i don't care how long you have tormented me but it's high time you are a squatter i'm enforcing the holy ghost and you gotta go so you know what your property is put a name to that property and you say satan it's high time maybe you're praying for your loved one you for them to see the light you've been praying for them for so long and satan is staying right there you gotta walk in and say i'm claiming my loved ones satan you get up you gotta go i have the right when christ died on cover and said it is finished he gave you back the abstract to that title he gave you back the rights to that title so you can enforce it and the devil has no other option but to leave because the title is being enforced by the holy ghost and that is god himself you have that authority amen it has your name on it you have that power you have the authority you know in ads it says when they were praying for the holy ghost they got power the greek translation calls that power authority so when you receive the holy ghost you have that authority when you receive the holy ghost you are taking that book and you are claiming that authority and you gotta use it for whatever you need you gotta use it when satan is tormenting you when satan is coming against you amen hallelujah you gotta receive it because you know it is yours you have authority to claim back that property because it is yours it is rightfully yours amen the state is obligated to enforce that title so long your name is on it if they don't want to move there we'll be prosecuted and we know satan is going to be prosecuted for all he's done he is going to burn in the lake of fire because of all because of all the squattering he's been doing he gotta go he is going to pay for what he has done for you he's going to pay for what he did to you that sickness that you had don't worry about it he's going to pay for it why because he was a squatter staying where he is not supposed to stay your body you were made to serve god you were not made to suffer when you were standing rather you say satan you are squattering and he's going to have to pay for it if he refuses to go he will pay for it he will be prosecuted the holy ghost is the best enforcer there is amen two thousand years ago that title was taken back and put into our hands on the day of pentecost when they got that authority they were able to chase demons they were a peter was able to say silver and gold they have none but what i have i gave to you what was it talking about it was that authority he had that deed placed in his hands amen so you got to stand right there and say i'm taking my inheritance i'm taking back everything that belongs to me amen because why the title did say so if the squad asks you what right do you have or what authority are you coming here with you say the title did say so why the title did say so i am sick i want to be healed why the title did say so amen i have lost my faith why can i gain it back the title did say so you are highly favored you are a son you are a daughter of god you are a chosen generation why because the title did say so you are above and not beneath why the title did say so so you don't have to live under your privilege people done did it already but now we have it in our hands so we got to use it to our own advantage because we know god prepared and made that way back for you and me to be able to get that abstract to get those rights and that authority that the title deed has and it is ours let's stand up on our feet amen amen let us sing we've got the power as um the pastor comes forward amen we've got the power in the name of jesus we've got the power in the name of the lord though satan reading we cannot be defeated we've got the power in the name of the lord oh we've got we've got the power in the name of jesus oh yes we've got the power in the name of the lord though satan raided we cannot be defeated we got the power in the name of the lord for so many years four many years now satan's tried to stop
