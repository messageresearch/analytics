[0:00] and no doubt he talked in his mind i
[0:03] would say that he he saw the church ages
[0:07] and each church age amen
[0:10] received a portion of bread because
[0:13] remember now the bread is jesus christ
[0:17] it is the word of god
[0:19] and so they received a portion of the
[0:21] bread but listen they never wanted the
[0:25] fresh manna whenever the fresh manna
[0:28] came
[0:29] they just stayed with the old
[0:32] and of course we know what happened
[0:34] it staled it rotted
[0:36] there is a bread amen that was beyond
[0:39] the seven church ages it was a it's
[0:41] behind the veil
[0:43] that bread never growed old
[0:46] right it never got stale and you know
[0:48] the thing about it if you ever thought
[0:50] about it it was not a group thing
[0:54] ain't no matter how many levites there
[0:56] were they couldn't all go behind the
[0:59] veil
[1:01] one person at a time
[1:04] and that one person by god's grace amen
[1:07] was what we call the high priest
[1:10] and you and i understand if you
[1:12] understand what jesus did
[1:14] on calvary when the veil was rent
[1:18] it gave access
[1:20] to the holies of holies to whosoever
[1:24] will
[1:25] a new order had come in
[1:28] because it was no longer law but grace
[1:31] so when he was saying give us this day
[1:33] our daily bread
[1:36] listen
[1:37] understand when that bread is given to
[1:39] you when that aged bread that bread that
[1:42] god gives you every age to eat
[1:44] it brings forth life
[1:47] but this is the key
[1:50] to your life
[1:52] and forgive us our debts
[1:55] as we forgive our debtors
[1:58] and we've been taught by jesus christ
[2:02] that the only way this bread can be
[2:05] live in you
[2:07] is that the following step
[2:09] it must be taken
[2:12] you have to forgive
[2:14] you've got to love
[2:17] hallelujah
[2:19] all of these things must be in play in
[2:22] order for a true child of god to reap
[2:25] reach perfection
[2:27] he said brother explain that to me
[2:29] remember
[2:30] jesus's last test
[2:34] was after he had been beaten
[2:37] after he had been sped on
[2:40] after they crowned his head with thorns
[2:43] after which amen all
[2:45] they made mercury of him
[2:48] if you be the son of god come down from
[2:50] the cross
[2:51] so all of these things were were just no
[2:54] doubt echoing in his mind and i'm coming
[2:57] to that because the greatest battle ever
[2:59] thought is in your mind
[3:01] right this is where the enemy fights you
[3:05] every one of us but one thing
[3:08] jesus never forgot who he was and what
[3:12] his purpose was
[3:14] father
[3:16] forgive them that was the crowning of
[3:19] his ministry
[3:20] it proved he was the lamb of god
[3:24] it proved amen he was everything he said
[3:26] he was
[3:28] and this
[3:30] profound statement astonished those that
[3:34] were around
[3:36] even some of the roman soldiers could
[3:38] not believe what they heard
[3:41] he's asking for forgiveness
[3:45] lord forgive them
[3:47] for they know not what they do
[3:51] one soldier said surely this must be
[3:55] the son of god
[3:56] see because only the sons and daughters
[3:59] of god has the ability to forgive let me
[4:02] move on
[4:03] the thing that i love about it is
[4:05] because we're like trees i'm coming to
[4:08] something here
[4:09] we are like trees david said i'm planted
[4:12] by the rivers of water and i shall not
[4:14] be moved
[4:16] one water
[4:19] that water that life that stream of life
[4:22] is jesus christ himself and i shall not
[4:25] be moved
[4:26] i'm planted
[4:28] he's in me and i am in him
[4:32] why i love isaiah 61 11
[4:35] is because
[4:37] the scripture says
[4:39] and as the garden causes things that are
[4:45] sown in it to bring forth
[4:48] as the garden you what are you saying
[4:50] brother brooks i'm saying
[4:52] you are planted in the right place
[4:57] and that place that you planted in
[4:59] causes you to grow
[5:02] in other words you can't run from
[5:04] situations you can't hide from
[5:06] situations the situations have been
[5:08] designed for you
[5:11] for example you're not a cactus
[5:14] a cactus could not survive here
[5:18] certain trees and certain plants can
[5:20] only survive in the territories in which
[5:22] they were planted
[5:26] their life
[5:27] depends on
[5:29] the garden in which they were planted
[5:32] and so god is saying to us when you're
[5:35] there i will cause you to spring forth
[5:38] y'all understand me because even look at
[5:40] jesus in the garden of gethsemane garden
[5:43] of gethsemane he was planted to be there
[5:48] and he said father you know he the bible
[5:50] said he vehemently prayed
[5:53] father whether this cup passed from me
[5:55] but nevertheless let thy will be done
[5:59] don't we all wish
[6:02] we can kind of move out of the squeeze
[6:04] thing that's coming
[6:06] but it's coming
[6:08] this is the age we were planted in
[6:11] it is the age that god gave us grace to
[6:13] be listen it ain't you
[6:16] he said i i am the
[6:19] vine you are the branches all we need to
[6:21] do is stay connected
[6:24] to the vine
[6:25] and the light within the vine will bring
[6:28] forth fruits
[6:30] hallelujah you love the lord
[6:32] he said i will bring so so the lord god
[6:35] will cause righteousness and praise to
[6:39] spring forth before the nations
[6:42] you know you say spring forth when you
[6:45] see something spring it's like it comes
[6:46] up like this you know all of a sudden it
[6:49] just comes up like this
[6:50] wasn't seen at one point but all of a
[6:52] sudden it just come up like this
[6:54] and so that's how god is working with us
[6:57] right now you may look like your failure
[7:01] you may feel like a loser you may feel
[7:03] like you don't have faith listen it
[7:05] ain't you it's god in you
[7:08] god at his appointed time at his set
[7:11] time will bring forth his purpose in you
[7:14] and through you
[7:16] that's it
[7:20] hallelujah
[7:21] isaiah 23 9 says and i will bring forth
[7:24] a seed
[7:25] out of jacob
[7:27] and out of judah
[7:30] an inheritor
[7:32] of my mountain and we know who that is
[7:34] that's jesus christ
[7:36] right
[7:38] and my elect shall inherit it
[7:41] and my servants shall dwell
[7:44] there
[7:45] right now this scripture is us
[7:49] i will say it again
[7:51] this scripture is us
[7:54] we're we we he
[7:56] jesus christ our lord is the inheritor
[8:00] right
[8:01] but we are the elected he said my elect
[8:05] shall inherit it
[8:07] and my servants shall dwell there
[8:12] god is so perfect
[8:15] he's so perfect he designed this body
[8:19] like the temple in heaven
[8:21] is that right
[8:23] because you say your heart has four
[8:25] chambers
[8:26] four living creatures
[8:29] right
[8:30] where the blood of god has flown through
[8:33] but you also is encompassed about
[8:36] with 24 elders
[8:39] 24
[8:40] ribs
[8:42] and those ribs are there to protect your
[8:44] heart
[8:46] protect the queen
[8:47] protect you see when when moses saw
[8:51] everything it was in
[8:52] symbolism
[8:54] it was a symbol or symbols amen but
[8:57] but but god had you
[9:00] and me and mine
[9:05] this is the timing season that god is
[9:08] preparing himself a bride
[9:11] and i want to say this by god's grace
[9:15] that
[9:17] the messenger actually ministered a
[9:19] message shalom i take it that means
[9:22] peace to the bride i'll take it
[9:25] i don't deserve it but i'll take it
[9:28] i haven't earned it but i'll take it
[9:30] why because it's given
[9:33] ah somebody said to me the other day
[9:35] says listen
[9:38] if something is given to you and you
[9:39] don't take it it's nobody's fault but
[9:41] your own
[9:42] you must take it
[9:45] but let me move on because i don't want
[9:46] to just spend all day all night on this
[9:48] i want you to understand it's like
[9:50] healing deliverance you know it's not
[9:52] enough to say i'll take it it must move
[9:55] from the head into the throne room
[9:58] hallelujah it must come before the king
[10:02] and the king was put out his scepter
[10:04] like he did esther and says you can have
[10:07] half of the kingdom if you like
[10:09] so you and i must understand that we're
[10:11] living in the last days
[10:13] and i i was telling the people there in
[10:15] south carolina i'm telling the people
[10:17] here
[10:18] you come to the house of god
[10:21] for change
[10:23] you want the word to change you
[10:27] it's good to shout
[10:29] it's good to dance
[10:30] it's good to speak in tongues right up
[10:32] and down or out
[10:34] all those gifts and things have already
[10:37] been proven
[10:38] the word is already proven that it and
[10:40] the manifestation before we got here has
[10:43] already been proven that the word is
[10:45] true in that area
[10:47] but you and i we're living in a
[10:49] different age we're no longer in
[10:52] laodicea
[10:53] we're in an eternal age we're in a
[10:55] bright age
[10:56] you understand me you can't get here
[10:59] without the blood
[11:02] you know what i'm saying people come to
[11:04] the message you know all of a sudden we
[11:06] want to put them in the head no they're
[11:08] not in there yet
[11:09] you got to come through justification
[11:11] you got to come through sanctification
[11:13] you got to come through the baptism of
[11:14] the holy ghost and that holy ghost in
[11:17] you must mature
[11:19] that's the words according to peter that
[11:22] god has given us and made us partakers
[11:24] of his divine nature
[11:28] hey listen you can't add one cubit to
[11:31] your statue but you know the man who can
[11:34] be touched by the feelings of our
[11:36] infirmities
[11:38] it's prayer
[11:40] it's seeking god at this hour like
[11:42] you've never sought him before that's
[11:45] the pool
[11:47] hallelujah that is the poor
[11:50] and satan is going to do everything he
[11:52] can
[11:53] to keep you away from your prayer lives
[11:56] don't let let god
[11:59] let go
[12:00] let god and let go
[12:02] there is no way that you can pray and
[12:04] god will not answer
[12:07] god always answers
[12:09] sometimes he answers yes and sometimes
[12:11] he's answering no but he always answers
[12:14] but whenever whichever way he goes with
[12:17] that he will give you the strength to go
[12:20] forward with him
[12:22] now we're living in conditions
[12:25] i was thinking and writing this stuff
[12:26] down and i
[12:28] like i said uh
[12:29] um but god's good you know that
[12:32] my ipad locked up i couldn't find my
[12:34] receipt and now god don't bless me with
[12:35] my receipt and everything
[12:37] and this the ipad was uh i think was
[12:40] 2014 was it yeah that received way back
[12:43] then
[12:44] and it was it was paid for in lime ohio
[12:47] uh by bible believers and they had all
[12:49] that on record and so i can get my ipad
[12:51] unlocked so by the grace of god i'm
[12:54] happy about that see you can't tell me
[12:56] god
[12:58] doesn't answer prayer
[13:00] even the least of things
[13:03] so if you know if he answers those small
[13:05] things you'll answer the big ones too
[13:07] right
[13:08] oh it's the truth
[13:11] hallelujah yes sir
[13:13] when you don't have food
[13:16] just tell the lord now god i'm more than
[13:18] the sparrow
[13:22] that's what he said the bible said
[13:24] listen don't take no thought for
[13:25] tomorrow i i close the field i feed the
[13:28] sparrow and you're better you're more
[13:30] than that
[13:31] you got to know that you are by the
[13:33] grace of god i feel i feel like shouting
[13:37] luke 17.
[13:38] let's go there quickly and i'm going to
[13:39] move faster than i'm going now
[13:41] because i want i want to there's a lot
[13:43] of things i really want to get forward
[13:45] in here
[13:46] you
[13:46] see where we are
[13:50] and i'll say it like this
[13:52] everybody in the message is not going to
[13:54] make a rapture
[13:56] can i say it like that again when
[13:58] everybody that believes they're in the
[14:00] message
[14:02] it's not going to make a rapture
[14:04] y'all understand me
[14:06] it is what it is
[14:08] and why why i say that is because a lot
[14:12] of people are not moving forward
[14:16] you got to move forward into the
[14:18] character of christ and guess what it
[14:22] comes by pain
[14:25] we're talking about rapture now we're
[14:27] not talking about salvation there's a
[14:29] number that could not even be numbered
[14:31] that is saved
[14:33] we're talking about a translation
[14:35] something that's going to change you
[14:37] from this this ram and to the next
[14:41] but i want you to show you the
[14:42] conditions here in luke 17 26 and 30
[14:46] as it was in the days of noah so shall
[14:49] it be in the days of the son of man
[14:52] they did eat they did they drank they
[14:55] married
[14:56] wives they were given in marriage until
[14:59] the day noah entered into the ark and
[15:02] the flood
[15:03] came and destroyed them all sounds like
[15:08] an ordinary
[15:10] lifestyle
[15:11] here not only in america but all over
[15:15] the world
[15:17] right
[15:18] it was conditions
[15:21] conditions and i think we we saw all
[15:25] throughout our lives we saw all of the
[15:28] conditions the one thing we failed to
[15:30] see even when we didn't know this was
[15:33] the very thought of the son of man we
[15:35] missed it
[15:36] we saw the eating we saw the drinking we
[15:38] saw the marrying we saw all of the
[15:39] partying we saw all of that but it was
[15:42] also at a time when the son of man would
[15:45] be revealed
[15:47] y'all understand me
[15:48] so the son of man is a prophet
[15:51] it is the word he is the word because
[15:54] god made him a part of the word now
[15:56] let's move on amen he says likewise
[16:01] also as it was in the days of lot they
[16:03] did eat they drank they bought they saw
[16:06] they planted and they build it huh
[16:09] can you see it
[16:11] all over the world they're building
[16:13] brand new houses
[16:16] everywhere and you wonder where they're
[16:17] getting all the money i don't know but
[16:19] it is prophecy being fulfilled
[16:22] roads and stuff people are starving and
[16:25] they're building they're thinking about
[16:26] building better roads
[16:27] it shows you that the love of god is not
[16:29] in their hearts
[16:32] right that's another one now right on
[16:35] third one the third one is as even shall
[16:38] it be in the day when the son of man is
[16:42] revealed
[16:43] what was it
[16:45] he's saying when you see these signs
[16:48] when you see these conditions know that
[16:52] the rapture is at hand know that god is
[16:55] getting ready to do something because
[16:57] remember in the days of noah when this
[16:59] took place and god was left out of
[17:01] everything the flood came in the time of
[17:04] of lot remember in a time when their
[17:07] conditions were like that it meant god
[17:10] rained down fire
[17:12] when god was left out
[17:14] right
[17:15] as it was he says listen but the same
[17:18] day that lot lot is important
[17:21] the same day lot went out of sodom it
[17:25] rained fire and brimstone from heaven
[17:28] and destroyed them all
[17:32] never have we seen in the history of all
[17:35] history where the whole world now there
[17:38] were cities like rome and cities like
[17:40] greece and cities like capernaum and
[17:43] city like pompeii and city cities city
[17:46] cities but no longer cities now the
[17:48] whole world is corrupt
[17:50] the whole world is corrupt
[17:52] y'all understand me
[17:54] so received by god's grace he's saying i
[17:57] can remember he said now
[17:59] the the the gospel will travel from the
[18:01] east to the west
[18:03] as the sun shining from the east to the
[18:04] west so shall the the revealing of
[18:07] christ a revealing of god and so you got
[18:09] to understand it can't go any further
[18:13] corruption can go no further
[18:16] than than the west coast of california
[18:19] hallelujah now
[18:23] but there's another thing
[18:25] he says in that day
[18:27] he which shall be upon the housetop
[18:30] and he's his stuff is in the house
[18:34] let him not come down to take it away
[18:37] and he that in the field
[18:39] let him likewise not return
[18:42] back you know i look up that word safari
[18:45] because of a sofarity
[18:47] serferting because it means excess
[18:50] you know you can have an excess of
[18:52] eating or excess of spending or in
[18:55] excess of basically all the worldly
[18:58] things
[18:59] and that ex being that is an excess
[19:02] it becomes your ruler it controls you
[19:05] right and so he says listen be careful
[19:10] and believe it or not
[19:12] overeating is a sin
[19:15] and we all do it and we don't even think
[19:17] about amen that we're corrupting our
[19:19] bodies when we do that
[19:22] but we are and we do
[19:25] and that's one of the sins
[19:27] that people are missing
[19:29] i was missing it
[19:31] until recently
[19:33] hallelujah but here is the thing
[19:35] he said during these conditions he says
[19:38] remember
[19:39] lot's wife
[19:42] and what happened amen large wife
[19:45] brother branham explains it he said
[19:47] lot's wife was worried about her loved
[19:50] ones
[19:51] now i i didn't know uh uh what all was
[19:53] going to be said today but i just say
[19:55] this it was to her her kin folks
[19:59] and he said
[20:01] as she walked the greatest battle is in
[20:03] your mind
[20:05] don't let nobody hinder you
[20:08] from making a rapture
[20:10] you pray for them you believe for them
[20:12] but it's not enough to
[20:15] look back for them
[20:16] you understand me it was more than just
[20:18] a looking back
[20:20] but my point is we're we're here and we
[20:23] understand that during this time miss
[20:26] lot played a great part why because you
[20:30] see falling away not just from the
[20:32] message everywhere
[20:34] every denomination every organization
[20:37] people are just
[20:38] forgetting about god
[20:42] but a true believer no matter where they
[20:44] are
[20:45] god is their source of strength
[20:48] hallelujah these are the conditions
[20:50] we're working with
[20:52] now you say well what do you mean
[20:53] because i want you to understand that
[20:55] these times were times of exodus
[20:59] nor there was a time of exodus
[21:02] lots time there was a time of exodus
[21:05] right
[21:06] and egypt it was a time of exodus
[21:09] and now can it be a fourth exodus
[21:12] can it be that god is doing something
[21:15] where he's taking the cream of the cream
[21:17] of the cream of the crop
[21:19] those who feel the pool
[21:22] i hope you're feeling it i feel the pool
[21:25] there's something going on on the inside
[21:27] of me
[21:29] hallelujah i cannot explain it
[21:32] but there is an urgency there is a uh uh
[21:36] something that's moving in me that
[21:39] that's desiring to be more like him
[21:44] that's it
[21:46] see this book was sealed as i said last
[21:48] week
[21:49] it was sealed
[21:51] if you could read it
[21:53] but to understand it
[21:55] was a different thing
[21:57] because the letter killeth
[21:58] but the spirit gives life
[22:01] now we understand
[22:02] that god's church was built upon
[22:04] revelation
[22:05] yes the word says it but what does it
[22:08] really mean
[22:10] and it's not given to any private
[22:12] interpretation you can't put your own
[22:14] thoughts to it that's what's got us in
[22:16] such a confused state now
[22:18] churches are just absolutely confused
[22:22] can't even see the oneness of god but
[22:24] listen because only the prophet of god
[22:27] in this day could bring it out in such a
[22:29] way that we were not oneness and we were
[22:31] not threeness and we were not twoness
[22:37] god has never been won like your finger
[22:42] jesus christ is the son of god
[22:45] yet he is god
[22:48] and people can't seem to understand it
[22:50] he's not a trinity and we understand
[22:52] where the trinity comes from
[22:54] now i'm just going with this
[22:57] so that you can understand how blessed
[22:58] you and i are
[23:00] to understand what god is doing in our
[23:03] day
[23:04] these people did the best they could
[23:07] y'all get y'all understand me
[23:10] and god knows them that are his
[23:13] none of us could ever say that god is
[23:15] not in the denominations
[23:18] because as long as his people are there
[23:20] he's there
[23:22] and only god knows who they are
[23:25] that's why revelation they come out of
[23:26] her my people
[23:28] that that means coming out of a system
[23:30] because even in this message there is a
[23:32] system
[23:34] but you're not here to marry a system
[23:37] or to worship a system
[23:39] you're here to marry christ
[23:43] y'all understand me
[23:44] that's what we come to marry
[23:46] now let me move on by god's grace
[23:48] because i'm trying to get to something
[23:51] listen the bible was sealed but now it
[23:54] is an open book that means this bible
[23:56] from genesis in revelation must declare
[23:59] jesus christ and jesus christ alone
[24:03] right that's what the bible says the
[24:05] bible says he is the alpha and the omega
[24:10] the beginning and the end
[24:13] neither is there salvation in any other
[24:16] there's no other name
[24:18] among heaven
[24:20] whereby we must be saved other than the
[24:23] name of jesus christ
[24:25] all the way through
[24:26] if you can't see jesus christ you're
[24:28] missing it
[24:30] because even in the old testament amen
[24:33] he's shallowing and typing out
[24:36] salvation
[24:38] right when it comes to ruth
[24:40] when it comes to esther amen there were
[24:43] shadows and type and prophecies of what
[24:46] was to take place in the end time
[24:51] hallelujah i'm coming to this now
[24:54] now the mystery of the seventh seal has
[24:56] been revealed and the seven thunders
[24:59] amen has uttered their voices
[25:01] right
[25:02] and the bible said there was a silence
[25:05] that silence began to unfold to the
[25:07] bride of jesus christ because remember
[25:10] you can't preach what was in the seventh
[25:12] if and they think it's going to hold in
[25:15] the eighth
[25:16] that's what the seventh or the sixth age
[25:18] did with fifth age but fourth that's
[25:20] what they all did they tried to hold on
[25:23] to so every age produced a different
[25:26] message but more of it
[25:28] not just a piece of the pie more of the
[25:31] pie
[25:32] that's what we fail to see
[25:34] god
[25:36] never stands still he always unfolding
[25:40] he's always unfolding he's always
[25:42] unfolding and the mystery of the whole
[25:45] bible is you
[25:47] the whole purpose of redemption is to
[25:50] get back to us what we lost when adam
[25:53] and eve sinned
[25:56] as simple as that
[25:58] but god through ages took his own time
[26:02] to deliver and to bring people out and
[26:05] to show what he will do and what he did
[26:07] what was this about a love affair
[26:11] this is a love affair
[26:13] a love of faith
[26:15] it was all because he loved us
[26:17] saint john 3 16 right
[26:19] for god so loved the world
[26:22] that he gave his only begotten son
[26:24] that whosoever believeth in him shall
[26:26] not perish but have everlasting life
[26:31] it's all about jesus
[26:33] it's all about his pride the beginning
[26:36] amen when you saw adam and eve they were
[26:38] one
[26:40] right but adam was stupid
[26:43] he said what do you mean
[26:45] adam
[26:47] when he saw eve
[26:50] he said you're born in my bone
[26:52] and flesh of my flesh and for this cause
[26:56] a man shall leave mother and father and
[26:59] cleave to his wife where mother and
[27:02] father did come into play until after
[27:04] the sin after the fall
[27:07] there was supposed to be no mothers and
[27:08] fathers
[27:10] that's why they asked uh jesus
[27:14] said your mother and your father or your
[27:16] mothers and your brothers here he said
[27:17] who is my mother and my brother but
[27:19] those that do my father's will
[27:22] right he was saying listen we all
[27:24] brothers
[27:25] we all sisters
[27:27] it was to never be f is that right it
[27:30] was to never be husband and wife
[27:33] that that's not the beginning that's not
[27:35] the ending
[27:38] but these things did come to come
[27:40] together would have come together in
[27:42] god's plan to reproduce but it would not
[27:45] have been by sex
[27:50] am i making sense
[27:53] so that the the scriptures can't be
[27:55] broken
[27:56] even when else said i love this i love
[27:59] the scene i just
[28:00] if i ever was to be in a play i would
[28:02] love to be in this but i know i couldn't
[28:03] be esther
[28:06] but when i look and i see how god in in
[28:09] the in the book of esther
[28:11] the silence
[28:13] right you know it was silence it was a
[28:16] busy time the king was on the throne
[28:19] right
[28:20] esther came at a time when she wasn't
[28:22] summonsed
[28:24] and no doubt when those doors swung up
[28:27] and everybody looked
[28:29] they knew the law
[28:31] they knew the law
[28:32] that if the king did not put forth the
[28:35] scepter esther would die
[28:38] they knew the law
[28:39] but when esther walked in i guarantee
[28:41] you there was a complete silence
[28:47] and everybody was staring at esther
[28:51] or the king
[28:53] and esther
[28:55] was staring at the king
[28:57] her focus
[29:00] was in
[29:01] in the king's eye
[29:04] she didn't look down
[29:06] perhaps she was there for a while but no
[29:09] doubt when she got up there
[29:12] in the presence of that king
[29:16] something she had to do
[29:19] you understand me you said what do you
[29:21] mean brother brooks how many of y'all
[29:22] know this to be the truth
[29:24] when you fall in love
[29:27] you don't need a lot of words
[29:31] you can just look at a person and they
[29:32] can look at you
[29:35] and the joy bells are ringing
[29:37] yeah is the truth y'all act like y'all
[29:39] don't forgot what that is
[29:41] but it's true that's how you know when
[29:43] it's the right one you
[29:45] and no words are being said
[29:47] you understand me but you understand him
[29:50] and he understands you
[29:53] and you connected
[29:55] in silence
[29:57] y'all understand me that's how it was
[29:59] with esther and the king they connected
[30:02] in silence
[30:04] they knew
[30:05] they couldn't explain it
[30:07] they knew
[30:08] and the king knew he couldn't live
[30:10] without her
[30:15] oh my god the king knew he couldn't live
[30:18] without her and she knew she didn't want
[30:21] to live without him
[30:24] and he reached out that scepter
[30:26] like john did with the book
[30:28] take this book
[30:30] and eat it
[30:32] you understand me it was the same
[30:34] symbolism of john
[30:36] receiving the book out of the
[30:38] handwritten of him who sat on the throne
[30:41] same thing
[30:43] because the king says i give you half
[30:45] the kingdom whatever you want after
[30:47] don't you understand
[30:49] who i feel like crying don't you
[30:51] understand the hour we're living in
[30:54] we're living in the hour we're living in
[30:56] the hour where god is saying you can
[30:59] have half of the kingdom
[31:02] that means your mother your father your
[31:04] sister your brother whoever it is i'll
[31:07] give it to you all you got to do is ask
[31:10] for it
[31:11] believe it
[31:13] that's the hour we're under the thunders
[31:15] we're under that voice that that nobody
[31:17] else can hear but the pride of jesus
[31:22] that's truth
[31:24] that's true
[31:27] and when she left the king she said ki
[31:30] you know what she said to the king even
[31:32] though she had all those things on her
[31:34] list her bucket list if i could say it
[31:36] like that she said king
[31:38] all i want to do
[31:39] and all i want to do is have a revival
[31:42] hey
[31:44] that's all i want to do give me a
[31:46] banquet and a banquet represents revival
[31:49] a bank it represents celebration i
[31:52] banquet y'all hear what i'm saying guess
[31:54] what
[31:55] when she gave she they had that banquet
[31:58] you think the devil was talking then
[32:02] no
[32:04] haman
[32:05] was quiet
[32:06] as a mouse
[32:10] you want to shut the devil up
[32:12] you start giving god the praise
[32:15] you start enjoying yourself under this
[32:18] message like you ought to and watch the
[32:21] devil shut up
[32:22] he knows he's in trouble
[32:25] he he has forgotten he knows he's in
[32:28] trouble and you and i need to put all
[32:30] that we can put on him hallelujahs and
[32:33] thank you jesus and glory to god and
[32:37] most of all living it
[32:40] put the devil to the shame
[32:43] is that right it's it's true let me go
[32:45] on remember the self the half hour of
[32:48] silence
[32:50] is that right well what happened when
[32:52] ruth
[32:53] went to see boaz
[32:56] she quietly
[33:01] no noise but there was a union
[33:04] spiritually taking place
[33:06] you understand me she had one thought in
[33:09] mind because her mother-in-law had
[33:12] already told her
[33:14] find out where boaz lay
[33:18] and when you get there lay beside him
[33:22] and when she knelt down she laid beside
[33:26] him and
[33:26] no doubt at his feet that's how you meet
[33:29] jesus
[33:30] you meet him at his feet
[33:34] cover me with your
[33:36] garment
[33:37] right do you understand
[33:39] the kind of trouble they would have
[33:41] gotten in
[33:42] if they had been caught or she had been
[33:45] caught there laying at the feet of boaz
[33:49] it was a mystery
[33:51] nobody knew what took place
[33:54] but boaz and ruth
[33:57] oh somebody help me here
[34:00] and when that took place he said listen
[34:03] you're more righteous than i thought
[34:06] you're holy
[34:08] you could have chosen some of these new
[34:10] religions but you chose the old way
[34:17] oh i'm coming
[34:19] hallelujah it was a silence
[34:22] she took it back with her
[34:24] and guess what
[34:25] they got married
[34:28] love
[34:29] at first sight
[34:32] is that right
[34:33] oh let me move on by god of grace by
[34:35] god's grace think about it
[34:37] when those when those are
[34:42] revelation 10 4 let me move on
[34:44] and when the seven thunders had uttered
[34:46] their voices
[34:47] it was about to john was i was about to
[34:49] write and i heard the voice from heaven
[34:53] saying unto me seal up those things did
[34:56] you know that word seal is with the
[34:58] capital s
[34:59] which signifies a person and not a thing
[35:04] it was christ who said seal of the book
[35:07] because only jesus christ could break
[35:09] the seal
[35:11] is that right oh come on folks you think
[35:13] about it when the real when jesus christ
[35:16] when the roman stone though mary and
[35:19] martha rode the dead it was sealed
[35:23] i'm getting two things mixed up no mary
[35:26] martha rose wrote away the stone for for
[35:28] lazarus but when those roman soldiers
[35:31] sealed
[35:32] nothing could break it
[35:34] nothing
[35:37] but in the quiet of the night
[35:42] in the quiet of the night
[35:44] the seal breaker
[35:46] showed up
[35:49] hallelujah
[35:50] and all of a sudden the storm rolled
[35:53] back the flash of lightning came down
[35:56] and there was two angels
[35:58] setting in there who do you think those
[36:00] angels were
[36:01] the bible doesn't say it but i guarantee
[36:03] you it was moses and elijah say prove it
[36:06] they were the ones who were mount
[36:07] transfiguration
[36:08] hallelujah they were the ones amen there
[36:11] at the tomb
[36:13] hallelujah they were the ones a man
[36:15] standing by him saying as he go up
[36:18] you'll see him come down
[36:20] hallelujah he said brother which you
[36:22] shouldn't say that well i'll put it this
[36:24] way when angels are ordained to do
[36:26] certain things
[36:28] they can't switch position
[36:30] that's what's what lucifer wanted to do
[36:33] god had already ordained him to be a
[36:35] covering angel and he wanted to be more
[36:37] than that
[36:38] you understand me whatever those angels
[36:41] were ordained to do from the beginning
[36:43] they cannot change it
[36:45] hallelujah you say oh brother bruce how
[36:47] can you say that that's why in the time
[36:51] of the tribulation when those jews amen
[36:54] are being persecuted and those two
[36:56] prophets comes up who is it
[36:59] moses and elijah
[37:01] not gabriel and michael
[37:03] moses and elijah you say brother brooks
[37:05] you yes that's revelation amen
[37:09] now my point is
[37:11] because moses and elijah was identified
[37:14] with the resurrection
[37:16] right
[37:17] right
[37:18] it was in elijah's ministry you saw
[37:20] resurrection it was moses ministry you
[37:23] saw resurrection because moses was
[37:26] resurrected
[37:27] so they were always identified with the
[37:29] resurrection
[37:30] and those hundred and forty-four
[37:32] thousand that die will be resurrected
[37:35] and even those prophets in the street
[37:37] shall be raised up again
[37:39] so anyway let me move on so you find out
[37:42] by god's way god breaks that seal
[37:44] right
[37:48] and
[37:48] now he's coming to a place and you got
[37:51] to understand the resurrection is this
[37:53] now the coming of the lord is this can i
[37:55] say this
[37:58] just before the exodus
[38:00] what showed up
[38:02] the pill of fire and god said i have
[38:05] come down
[38:06] so that was the coming
[38:09] it was a pill of fire that led them
[38:11] through the wilderness right but the
[38:14] pillar fire shows up again
[38:17] in the days of saul
[38:20] as he going down to persecute the
[38:21] christians
[38:22] the pillar fire comes down
[38:25] and he falls off the horse
[38:27] and he says who art thou lord
[38:30] he said i am jesus
[38:32] and jesus said it is hard for thee to
[38:34] kick against the prick see that was the
[38:36] coming of the lord
[38:38] right
[38:39] so you say oh brother you know if the
[38:41] coming of the lord is so well what about
[38:43] what about see
[38:44] when people see and i'm not going to go
[38:46] over so far with this but i want you to
[38:48] see something
[38:49] when jesus resurrected from the dead
[38:52] the bible said the graves were opened
[38:55] right and the angels are the servants of
[38:58] the lord walked around the city brother
[39:00] branham even dramatizes it
[39:03] you know out of songs oh oh lift up your
[39:06] head uh all your gates will be lifted up
[39:08] and let the king of glory come in now he
[39:11] wasn't by himself
[39:13] but all of the old testament saying
[39:16] was with him
[39:18] huh
[39:19] so when you talk about a cloud this is
[39:21] why the prophet god says listen it was
[39:24] not
[39:25] water vapors
[39:28] and the cloud in the in the wilderness
[39:30] was not water vapors
[39:36] the angel of the lord in camps
[39:41] oh somebody help me here
[39:43] one angel
[39:45] but the host of angel
[39:46] encamps about
[39:48] them that fear
[39:50] y'all understand me
[39:53] so when those that resurrection took
[39:55] place all those servants all those who
[39:59] were dressed now in white robes
[40:03] went up
[40:05] and it's called a cloud
[40:08] he descended
[40:09] ascended in a cloud
[40:13] it's the truth
[40:14] ask god about it he'll tell you
[40:16] so you say what do you mean he said in
[40:19] like manna
[40:20] i will come again
[40:24] not the same he said in like man
[40:26] this is why we do the cloud
[40:29] it was above water vapors it wasn't just
[40:31] water vapors
[40:33] because if you see the original you see
[40:35] faces
[40:38] but what was it oh
[40:40] my
[40:41] what was it
[40:43] when that seven seal broke
[40:46] bring it back to the old testament when
[40:48] the old testament saints
[40:50] raised from the dead paradise was done
[40:52] away with and they moved up higher
[40:56] but they're in a place right now where
[40:58] they desire to come back to the earth
[41:02] y'all understand me even though they're
[41:04] in their theophanies they're not
[41:06] satisfied
[41:07] there's a glorified body that they want
[41:10] to be in so they can eat and drink again
[41:12] and fellowship in such a way
[41:14] we're not meant for heaven we're meant
[41:16] for the earth
[41:18] we're coming back here to live
[41:22] but when god listen paul says
[41:25] i'm jumping
[41:27] he said for the lord himself shall
[41:29] descend from heaven with the shout and
[41:33] with the voice of an archangel
[41:35] with the trump of god and the dead in
[41:38] christ shall
[41:40] rise first
[41:43] and what we fail to see
[41:46] is that that is already in the motion
[41:49] because when jesus came when he came in
[41:52] 1963 what did he do it freed your
[41:56] theophany
[41:58] because your theopoly was in the sixth
[42:00] dimension when brother branham saw them
[42:03] ah
[42:04] but those thunders amen when god opened
[42:07] the book that's why he said if you
[42:09] believe this message you have heard from
[42:12] your theophany
[42:14] hallelujah it ain't me that's preaching
[42:16] it's my theophany that's standing though
[42:19] i don't see him he's there
[42:26] you say it can't be that simple yes it
[42:28] is
[42:29] the bible said enoch walked with god
[42:33] he was translated
[42:35] and he was found not
[42:37] hallelujah there was no no no no no uh
[42:41] uh going away party for him nobody knew
[42:45] when he was going to leave they didn't
[42:46] even know that he was going to leave
[42:48] because the mystery was between him and
[42:51] god
[42:53] and don't you understand amen when you
[42:55] when you walk with god in this message
[42:58] you are literally climbing jacob's
[43:01] ladder
[43:02] you're going higher
[43:04] from faith virtue knowledge tempers
[43:07] patience right godliness brotherly
[43:10] kindness and then charity and these
[43:12] steps these are victories
[43:14] these are births that causes a lot of
[43:17] pain
[43:18] because your flesh don't want to die but
[43:20] you know the word of god
[43:22] and you press on you press on and you
[43:25] say god bring me through this birth
[43:28] right especially when you don't have
[43:30] patience patience is the virtue but i'm
[43:32] gonna tell you something you gotta fight
[43:34] to get it
[43:35] hallelujah it just doesn't drop in your
[43:38] lap it's a birth it's a continuation of
[43:42] god in you that's why paul says grow up
[43:46] in to him
[43:52] unless there's a death
[43:54] there cannot be birth
[43:56] birth only comes by substance of death
[44:00] lest a corn or wheat fall in the ground
[44:03] and dies it abides alone now let me go
[44:06] back to the scripture that i read there
[44:09] in isaiah at the beginning he causes it
[44:13] god causes it
[44:15] like the sun causes everything to die
[44:17] and rot
[44:18] god causes you to die and rot
[44:21] you can't do it on your own
[44:23] don't even think about it
[44:25] they couldn't do the law
[44:27] don't even think about it you can't do
[44:29] the law don't even think about it
[44:32] all we can do says god have mercy on us
[44:36] let your grace be with us
[44:41] if you've got strength it comes from god
[44:43] almighty
[44:45] hallelujah it's okay i hope so
[44:48] because when this scripture
[44:51] i think and i uh this scripture when
[44:54] these scriptures and i had this down
[44:56] when this scripture comes
[44:59] uh just like our brother our brother uh
[45:00] keith show uh
[45:02] mentioned to me the day i think was
[45:03] today
[45:05] uh but anyway i don't even have that on
[45:07] here in my notes but but for sure
[45:10] i i had seen something that i had never
[45:13] seen before
[45:15] because when the mighty angel revelation
[45:17] 10 came down and he put one foot on the
[45:20] land and one foot on the sea he was
[45:22] literally declaring victory for all of
[45:24] his people
[45:26] you understand me when those seals were
[45:28] open remember john
[45:30] and this is what god gave me when john
[45:33] opened this when john saw that seal open
[45:36] he was about to write it so that means
[45:38] he could understand what was being said
[45:40] but he couldn't write it because if he
[45:42] had written it the secret would have
[45:44] been given away so he couldn't do it
[45:47] but it was the coming of the lord now
[45:50] you say oh brother books will you see
[45:52] him in the air yes the bible said you
[45:54] will
[45:56] you can't take that away
[45:58] but you must change
[46:00] like paul said from glory to glory god
[46:03] is now oh come on people that's the word
[46:06] the bride has made herself ready
[46:12] how
[46:14] how
[46:16] by saying
[46:17] lord not my will
[46:20] but thine be done
[46:24] because remember i believe that when
[46:25] esther got in the front
[46:27] she had to have that veil
[46:29] because that was an old way of doing
[46:31] things
[46:32] and she put that veil over
[46:34] to let him know
[46:36] you're my headship
[46:38] jesus christ is your headship
[46:40] it's not your preacher
[46:42] it's not your pastor it's not even you
[46:46] the headship is jesus christ
[46:49] and as long as you recognize the word
[46:52] to know that god is the same yesterday
[46:54] today and forever you think about it
[46:56] think about it when moses those
[47:00] disciples i mean all of the israel
[47:03] they didn't want to give up moses and
[47:04] elijah when jesus came
[47:07] they didn't they had a prophet they had
[47:09] a word for them probably they had the
[47:10] old testament and whatever more books
[47:12] they had an attitude
[47:14] and when jesus came with his authority
[47:17] who was the word they says no we ain't
[47:20] changing
[47:22] we've got moses as our prophet see and
[47:24] that's what it is even in the message
[47:26] jesus christ is here but they said we
[47:29] ain't changing we've got william branham
[47:31] as our prophet
[47:34] it's the truth
[47:36] but william branham was an elijah a man
[47:38] like john who pointed you to jesus
[47:40] christ
[47:42] hallelujah there's only one who can save
[47:44] you there's only one who died for you
[47:47] hallelujah there's only one book and
[47:50] that's 11 book of life and that book was
[47:52] in the hands of jesus christ the lamb
[47:55] it wasn't even in john's hand until god
[47:57] gave it to him
[48:00] y'all understand what i'm saying
[48:02] so to see amen that this let me say it
[48:04] like this this is what was quickening me
[48:07] today
[48:08] when the prophet god preached a message
[48:10] the greatest battle ever fought us in
[48:11] your mind
[48:13] and you know what for some reason
[48:16] i was guilty
[48:19] i was guilty
[48:21] believing i've got to win every battle
[48:25] that's been fought in my mind
[48:28] and i forgot about calvary
[48:31] i forgot that he fought for me
[48:34] he fought your battles
[48:36] he won that battle for you
[48:39] that mind battle that you're now going
[48:41] through
[48:42] where the devil said you can't overcome
[48:43] and you can't get victory there
[48:45] he is a liar he is a deceiver
[48:49] right because jesus christ won that
[48:52] battle for you but but in order to
[48:55] for that to be you you have to receive
[48:58] it
[48:59] lord i receive your victory
[49:03] god gave that to me and i thought oh my
[49:05] god i was missing this for i mean a big
[49:08] big big big margin
[49:10] big margin
[49:12] but i look and says oh my god you know
[49:14] even when he put the crown they put that
[49:16] the thorns on that was they were
[49:18] crowning him with the curse
[49:21] is that the truth cursed is the man who
[49:23] hangeth upon the tree
[49:25] and we know thorns was symbolic of a
[49:28] curse
[49:29] the curse cursed be the ground it should
[49:31] bring forth thorns and thistles
[49:33] what was he doing bearing your curse
[49:37] so you can be free
[49:40] hallelujah and the devil said you cursed
[49:42] you can never be cursed he bore the
[49:45] curse for you
[49:47] amen hallelujah lord of god
[49:51] thank you jesus
[49:53] hallelujah
[49:54] so you got to die it must rot and get
[49:58] into corruption and then from that
[50:00] corruption for com forth uh that comes
[50:03] forth life no other way it will work and
[50:06] i thought lord this is why the prophet
[50:08] god says lay in the presence of the son
[50:12] stay in the word
[50:14] stay in these messages
[50:16] listen to them
[50:18] they will change you you can't change
[50:20] yourself it there's a life
[50:23] a voice in a voice that comes to you
[50:25] amen that will change you that will
[50:27] convict you that will bring to you all
[50:29] that you need all you've got to do is be
[50:31] faithful
[50:33] and stay
[50:34] underneath that shekinah glory that god
[50:38] has that's the secret
[50:40] that's one of the great secrets that
[50:42] people don't understand that's what
[50:43] makes us different from everybody else
[50:45] because we have a word that will ripen
[50:47] our character
[50:49] right and understand this in closing
[50:54] i had a lot more to say but you know i
[50:55] gotta preach sunday so we'll have part
[50:57] one two and part three
[50:59] because there's so much to be said
[51:01] and i wanna really work with that uh the
[51:04] coming of the lord and and what you see
[51:07] uh uh uh
[51:09] how can i say it
[51:12] the word of god talks about
[51:15] the sins and paul said i saw him
[51:17] you know because remember paul said i i
[51:20] went and i was in a dimension whether it
[51:22] be the third heaven or not i he said
[51:24] that's what it was he said
[51:26] i was either anybody out of the body but
[51:28] i was there and i heard things that
[51:30] wasn't even lawful for man to utter
[51:32] right
[51:33] you know and so when you see
[51:35] what god did and how
[51:37] mighty he is let's see it like that john
[51:40] said john saw a mighty angel you know
[51:42] and paul said the lord himself
[51:45] right
[51:46] the angel shall descend and the same
[51:48] angel that john saw was the same lord
[51:51] that
[51:52] that paul saw
[51:53] so paul once saw him go up and the other
[51:55] one come down so you got to understand
[51:58] when this thing when this this word
[52:00] that's why this is what shook brother
[52:03] branham
[52:04] because he had in his mind like all of
[52:07] us had in our mind the way the coming of
[52:09] the lord would be
[52:11] he said could it be this thing is beyond
[52:14] me
[52:15] and it was after the seals god began to
[52:18] tell him just like it came just like it
[52:20] was with the with the seven thunders and
[52:23] and the seven trumpets he didn't even
[52:25] know he had preached the trumpets
[52:27] already and the law says already done
[52:30] you've already preached it
[52:33] hallelujah and so was it with the coming
[52:35] of the lord and people say well i don't
[52:36] understand it well the mighty angel came
[52:39] down where is he down
[52:44] he's supposed to be in you
[52:47] it's the same jesus
[52:49] god in morphing
[52:51] right
[52:52] and so you say well what why would you
[52:54] say listen that's what he was trying to
[52:56] tell us it's not enough to be just
[52:58] baptized with the holy ghost you must
[53:02] not only be born again but you've got to
[53:03] continue on until god brings you to
[53:06] perfection and you say what do you mean
[53:08] by that
[53:10] because they're coming another
[53:12] outpouring
[53:13] and none of us can make this rapture the
[53:15] way we are down
[53:17] hello
[53:18] but this outpouring comes at the time of
[53:21] the squeeze
[53:23] that's when it comes
[53:25] that's when we know we're right at the
[53:27] rapture because the prophet god alluded
[53:28] to it at that time of the squeeze at the
[53:31] time of the shutting of the door that's
[53:33] when the bride will be taken up he said
[53:36] the pressure the squeeze will bring them
[53:38] together push them together but it will
[53:40] push us up
[53:44] i am excited
[53:47] because i feel the pool
[53:49] i see the change
[53:51] you say well brother books nobody else
[53:53] don't see it nobody else don't have to
[53:54] see it but i see it
[53:58] by the time it's done everybody will see
[54:00] it
[54:03] it's little by little
[54:05] right women say i'm pregnant and you're
[54:07] looking
[54:09] because you can't see nothing
[54:11] and you say how many months
[54:15] and if she said four or five you're like
[54:16] something wrong with that
[54:18] especially if you can't see it
[54:21] because around that time you see the
[54:23] lump
[54:25] oh you should
[54:26] right
[54:27] so that which was invisible began to
[54:30] manifest itself as it grows
[54:38] you love the lord
[54:39] let's stand
[54:42] god is good to us
[54:44] and you and i know that we're about to
[54:46] take a rapture the thing about it is
[54:49] nobody's going to miss you
[54:52] it it's so it's so secret it's so small
[54:54] in number
[54:56] you see what i'm saying
[54:58] people don't love god enough to even
[55:00] come to church on wednesdays but i
[55:02] guarantee you there are people who could
[55:03] have been here tonight they're out there
[55:05] at the lunch place the dinner place
[55:07] whatever place
[55:09] you know what i mean but the bible said
[55:11] it they don't even know they're
[55:12] partaking of eating drinking and being
[55:14] married they don't know that
[55:16] you you're loving the things of the
[55:18] world more than you loving god
[55:21] you can't do that well you can if you
[55:23] choose to
[55:24] but you're missing the whole thing
[55:29] in that little story brother venom talks
[55:31] about the ranch's son and this lady who
[55:33] was
[55:34] chosen by god how that
[55:37] she was like a cousin
[55:39] and they treated her like dirt they
[55:41] didn't even treat her like a church
[55:43] they treated her bad
[55:46] but they didn't know she was the one
[55:50] the rancher's son chose
[55:53] all of the other ones had their little
[55:55] you know dresses and all of that revival
[55:57] stuff going on and i'm sure they could
[55:59] dance and shout and do all of this and
[56:02] all along she was in the back
[56:03] [Music]
[56:05] there you go
[56:06] while everybody else was making
[56:08] knowledge and look at it in every church
[56:11] the noise is just in a row everybody's
[56:13] right
[56:14] and yet there's a quiet there's a
[56:16] silence
[56:17] god is working in a people
[56:19] they don't even know them they don't see
[56:22] them they don't even consider them as
[56:24] being a church but they are
[56:27] and guess what
[56:29] it wasn't in the front yard
[56:31] it was on the back of the book
[56:34] it was in the backyard
[56:36] here she was throwing out fish water
[56:39] and all along he's observing her
[56:41] character and that's what god is doing
[56:43] the holy spirit that's what the prophet
[56:44] said the holy spirit is observing our
[56:47] character
[56:48] and he says reporting back
[56:51] to the things that we're doing
[56:55] but the one thing that i liked about it
[56:59] is that when the ranch's son came up he
[57:01] says oh i don't heard all about it
[57:03] say you didn't know that but when i was
[57:05] gone
[57:07] [Music]
[57:10] i had my
[57:12] worker watching every move you made
[57:16] he reported back to me you've been good
[57:18] [Music]
[57:21] that's all i want i want a good report
[57:26] that's all i want i don't care about
[57:28] riches
[57:29] i don't care about fame
[57:31] i don't care about money
[57:34] you know the devil says oh
[57:36] you got an issue with money
[57:38] no
[57:40] i got a issue with tithing
[57:43] when people don't pay their tithing
[57:45] because i know that when you don't
[57:47] you're cursed
[57:48] you understand me
[57:50] it troubles me more than that you know
[57:52] it's just more than that anyway i don't
[57:54] want to go into that but my point is
[57:56] we're looking at
[57:57] this thing to understand people it's
[57:59] okay to suffer
[58:01] this is a suffering way take up your
[58:04] cross and follow me
[58:06] it's all right
[58:07] to fall as long as you get up
[58:10] the bible said a just man falls seven
[58:12] times in a day
[58:13] y'all understand me
[58:15] and i want you to understand to be a
[58:17] christian doesn't mean that you got to
[58:18] go to higher ground tabernacle
[58:21] that's not it
[58:23] you got to know god for yourself
[58:26] right
[58:27] you got to know him for yourself you got
[58:29] to have him on the inside people say
[58:30] well i've never done this i've never
[58:32] done that let me tell you what the most
[58:34] solid christians i've ever seen
[58:37] usually are those that
[58:40] hardly ever shout hardly ever dance
[58:43] right they don't have all these extra
[58:45] gifts but they have one gift for certain
[58:48] they love the word
[58:51] they love the word
[58:53] they give their lives to the word
[58:56] and i'd rather have that
[58:59] than the shout the dance i'd rather have
[59:02] that than to be a preacher or a singer
[59:04] because you can be a preacher you can be
[59:06] a singer and if you don't have that love
[59:08] of the word in you you lost
[59:11] [Music]
[59:13] all gifts you can have all of that
[59:16] thank god for a prophet
[59:18] that could tell us like all these things
[59:21] have been done
[59:22] raising of the dead eyes of the blind
[59:24] open the word is true
[59:27] but right now god focus is a bride
[59:30] god's focus is taking people like you
[59:32] his whole purpose of calvary was to
[59:34] bring forth of his kind
[59:37] [Music]
[59:40] that's it
[59:42] a word bribe
[59:44] a people that love the word and live it
[59:48] and the only way you can live it
[59:50] is that the life of the vine
[59:52] be it you
[59:54] you love the lord
[59:56] oh my people we'll pick up on sunday we
[1:00:00] will be having communion on sunday as
[1:00:02] well for those who would like to take
[1:00:03] communion
[1:00:04] i like to say to those who do come
[1:00:07] if you're sick
[1:00:09] any kind of evil or sniffles
[1:00:12] stay at home
[1:00:14] we're here to share
[1:00:16] the lord's table
[1:00:18] you know what i'm saying my point is you
[1:00:20] know i'm not i'm not afraid but you know
[1:00:22] what i'll put it this way we're not here
[1:00:24] to to to how many of y'all like catching
[1:00:27] the flute
[1:00:29] i don't
[1:00:30] i i don't want it
[1:00:33] and i know how it is when people um
[1:00:36] i couldn't stand it me and my wife we
[1:00:38] went through a lot of changes when when
[1:00:40] people knew they were sick and then come
[1:00:42] your house to hold your baby
[1:00:44] [Music]
[1:00:46] no that's wrong
[1:00:48] we had a sister even brought her kids
[1:00:51] with the chicken pox said well they
[1:00:52] might as well get it now
[1:00:55] they're gonna get it later
[1:00:57] how selfish and unconcerned you know
[1:00:59] what i'm saying but people do stuff like
[1:01:01] that because you can deal with something
[1:01:04] pretty good that doesn't mean everybody
[1:01:06] else can physically deal with it
[1:01:08] and i know all these things are in the
[1:01:10] hands of god
[1:01:11] we don't know walking down to speak
[1:01:13] going to restaurants we don't know who's
[1:01:15] infected and who's not infected and i
[1:01:17] want to be assured that the blood of
[1:01:19] jesus keeps us safe
[1:01:20] [Music]
[1:01:23] i know he is i
[1:01:25] i know god has kept me safe
[1:01:28] but i don't want nobody to you know know
[1:01:30] you're not feeling well
[1:01:34] because everybody's faith is not on the
[1:01:36] same level
[1:01:39] that's what i'm talking about i'm not
[1:01:40] saying don't come if you want to come
[1:01:42] stay in the back
[1:01:43] just
[1:01:45] i'm just saying don't come
[1:01:47] you know for those but if you want to
[1:01:49] come and you know you you physically
[1:01:51] well and you
[1:01:52] you you don't have the covet and all of
[1:01:54] those kind of things because i'm saying
[1:01:56] communion folks
[1:01:58] people say well that is the church is
[1:02:00] the hospital well then if you got that
[1:02:02] kind of faith be well by the time you
[1:02:04] get here
[1:02:05] because you don't need to come to church
[1:02:06] to be well
[1:02:08] right
[1:02:09] yes
[1:02:10] [Music]
[1:02:20] you know what the situations
[1:02:23] all of the situations they've had to go
[1:02:25] through it
[1:02:26] little jew to lord god as young kid
[1:02:28] father has
[1:02:29] had to go through so many traumatic
[1:02:31] experiences
[1:02:34] but you're the prince of peace and i
[1:02:36] believe that
[1:02:37] father you've given us authority over
[1:02:39] these enemies
[1:02:42] satan
[1:02:43] i speak as a servant of the lord
[1:02:46] as a blood washed christian
[1:02:49] the holy ghost field
[1:02:51] i bind you right now and i speak victory
[1:02:53] to my
[1:02:56] grandson's mind
[1:02:57] and his spirit
