don't know whether you are feeling great like I am I'm tired in my flesh but I'm joyful in my soul I do have a prayer request there's a couple of sisters that I know that have a business that they are running and they're they're Desiring our prayers for them uh I won't mention their names but the Lord know who I'm speaking of we want to pray for them and pray for their safety and pray for their well-being and pray that God will continue to bless their business so if you would just borrow your heads with me in a word of prayer we thank you our heavenly father we thank you for your grace we thank you for your mercy we thank you for being so good to us you have been better to us than we have been to ourselves and Lord Jesus we pray father God that you would guide us keep us and strengthen us uh oh God uh we we just pray that you were just blessed oh God our sisters Lord there who are trying to do and doing your will Lord and I pray Lord God because you you you're the blesser you're the increaser and father God I pray that you will anoint oh God the business their business that you as you would Joshua I pray that you will anoint their business Lord God you know as you would anoint uh Joseph Lord that they would increase in whatever they would lay their hands to oh God it'd be an increase in father I know as you protected those Joshua and as you're protected Joseph Lord we are your bride and pray that you continue to build wall of fire about us protect us from all room of all the danger we know that we're living in such an evil age Lord we're living in an evil day where men are just hateful and men are violent and all these things are going on in this world but father you've promised to keep us Lord You're our shelter Lord you that strong towel you're the one that's going to run in and be safe so I pray that you bless my sisters as they continue on with their business in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you love the Lord then uh we would have said this earlier but we worked so hard to not get that paint on those places so those are mean no harm but just trying to do a thorough job amen as we stand let us go to Joshua the 24th I had such a good time on Saturday and Sunday and I was just so inspired and I'm still inspired by the word of God um knowing that uh we are free to worship God in that way it's it's just a sad note that God had to come by to remind us that we have that freedom but I thank God for his grace and his Mercy uh because he did yes and so I don't want it to be you know in a sense of well we've got to be systematic but I want everybody to have that Liberty that when the Holy Spirit comes uh you can dance you can shout whatever you need to do you know they We Know by the grace of God that the holy spirit will not interrupt the word amen you know unless it's a Hallelujah you know something like that but that's an amen you know what I mean that's a sickle that's a sickle yes but I mean you know you understand what I'm saying I think all of us are mature enough to understand Joshua 24 13-16 and I love the pulls of God I appreciate everybody who participated uh in preaching because Jesse wasn't preaching by himself amen he really uh had a great time he was blessed and so I believe all the people were too and uh just thank God for our brother Luna bringing his church by it was a real family reunion we love that Joshua 24 13-16 and I have given you a land for which ye did not labor and cities which he built not he dwelt in them of The Vineyards and the olive yards which you planted not do ye eat amen now therefore fear the lord and serve him in sincerity and in truth and put away the gods with your father served on the other side of the flood and in Egypt and serve ye the Lord amen and if it seemed evil unto you to serve the Lord choose you this day whom ye will serve amen whether the god which your father served that were on the other side of the flood or the gods of the amorites in whose land you dwell but as for me in my house we will serve the Lord amen and the people answered and said God forbid that we should forsake the Lord to serve other gods one more scripture I believe let us go to Exodus the 12th chapter beginning at the seventh verse we'll read down to the 14th verse of this scripture if you're there we'll read Exodus 12 7-14 and they shall take of the blood and strike it on two side posts and on the upper door post of the houses wherein they shall eat it and they shall eat the Flesh in the night roast with fire and unleavened bread and with bitter herbs they shall eat it eat not of it raw nor sudden at all with water but roast with fire his head with his legs and with the pertinence thereof and ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning and that which remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire and thus shall ye eat it with your loins girded your shoes on your feet and your staff in your hand and ye shall eat it in haste it is the Lord's Passover for I will pass through the land of Egypt this night and will Smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt both man and Beast and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment I am the Lord and the blood shall be to you for token upon the houses where you are and when I see the blood I will pass over you and the plague shall not be unto you to destroy you when I smite the land of Egypt and this day shall be unto you for a memorial you shall keep it a feast to the Lord throughout your generation you shall keep it a feast by an ordinance forever now the worshiper I'm sorry let's pray father God we thank you for your grace we thank you for your mercy we thank you for the reading of your word amen we pray tonight Lord God that you would bless the hero that will not only be hearers of the word but receiveth of the word therefore doers of the word amen Lord have thine own way in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated you need for white can I have a water please we out of it okay that's fine God is so good to us amen I like to uh entitle this message choose ye this day we are at a time when everything seems well but it is not we must understand by the grace of God that we must keep focused amen we realize by the grace of God that we have the greatest message amen that have ever struck the Earth this message could not have been preached in Luther's day it could not have been preached in Wesley's day it only could have been preached in this day amen and remember now if God has a message there must be a people to receive the message and we must understand that God has chosen us amen amen thank you brother two eggs to to be Witnesses that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and forever and that he is alive and well when we hear the word of God and have heard the word of God we know that by the grace of God that we can we must allow allow ourselves to be aligned up with the word Amen in other words amen we we we have no choosing amen oh whether we can take part of it and leave the other part but we understand according to the scripture we must eat it all we must eat all the pleasant parts and we almost we all all so we should all also eat the unpleasant part he says not only does do we eat the legs and all of these things but we must eat the bitter part that part that most people would frown that and you know the word of God said you know in preparing this uh uh uh lamb we're going to this lamb must be roasted yeah it cannot be boiled or baked it has to be roasted with fire and we understand that the fire always represents the Holy Ghost amen amen what we know by God's grace that God in every generation gives man a choice amen life or death and we know just even as Joshua said choose you this day amen who are you going to serve and if there be a generation that has to deal with idols this is the generation this generation man has a man has excluded God yes and they're trying their best to wipe him completely out amen where he gets no credit no honor but we find out that men wants to be worshiped and they want you to worship them of course most men amen of the world think that God doesn't exist but we who have been chosen by God Amen we don't we know that he exists and we not only know that but we know that God is God when we talk about choosing and I'm not going to be alone tonight but when we talk about choosing it's right and wrong right from wrong and we realize in this day right is being called wrong that's right and wrong is becoming right but this is why we need the Bible yes and the Bible is our absolute amen it is the thing that guides us it is the thing that teaches us amen it is the thing that identify us whether we be of God or whether we be of the devil is that right so the word of God says you've got to choose life or death now the thing that gets me is that in the time of The Exodus it was an urgent Time a time of urgency but I find out that in this day even within the church World they have no urgency and the reason being is because God said it in the last days people will be lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God Amen there'll be truth Breakers they'll be backed by us they'll be uh Covenant Breakers however you want to put it but they will indulge themselves in the things of darkness and the Bible said it would be so bad that me and rather have Darkness tonight and the reason why they choose Darkness rather than light is because if they choose light their deeds will be made manifest so we're living in a world that we don't care how Wicked the politicians become because we enjoy that because we want to be as wicked as they are but there was a time when the country was was ran uh by the Bible principles and during those times we had less crimes less murders less of everything that Satan can offer but what's the country now the country has become almost Lawless is that right we're living in a time where men must make a choice will you choose life or will you choose death and there is only one knife and that life is the life that Jesus Christ gives you is that right Buddha can't give you life Allah can't give you light only Jesus Christ can give you life how come he said I am the light I am the truth and I am the way Hallelujah and we realize tonight that our God is not dead he may be dead to the well but not to the True Believer Hallelujah and you say brother Brooks how do you know that he's alive I know he's alive because he's living in me Hallelujah you say how do you know he's living in me because he's been my healer he's just he's Batavia he's been my deliverer he talks with me he walks with me and he tells me that I am his own Who We Are yes sir people look at Christians as though their pushovers but a real Christian man a real Christian man is a real man and a real Christian woman is a real woman why because we choose life Hallelujah now here's a quote your Eternal Destiny is a choice that's choosing a LeBron and maybe tonight some of you will make that choice of where you spend eternity before this service end tonight so I want you to say this to those who who may be listening it's a choice and that's what people don't understand God always gives a man a choice hallelujah amen there's too many witnesses for God is that right even if it's not the human man even if it's not the man the Bible says Heaven and Earth declare of my glory amen how can anybody believe that there is no God when they themselves have no rule over their lives is that right oh you said what do you mean brother Brooks when a man gets sick does he invite sickness when a man got cancer does he invite cancer and when did when cancer come can a man get rid of it well if he was a God if he was so Supreme he would be able to get rid of it first of all he'd be able to stop him from coming Hallelujah but every man that is born of a woman has been appointed to die why because God said so amen there is a higher ruler and that ruler is life listen let me move on he said the Eternal Destiny is a choice and maybe tonight some of you will make that charge whether you spend eternity before this service in tonight there'll be one time that if you turn God down many times there'll be one time you'll turn him down for the last time you see and that's what people don't understand there's a lot of Christians quote Christians that have turned him down too many times Hallelujah they're dead and don't even know they're dead Hallelujah is that right there's a time you say oh that can't be true it is true amen Hallelujah and when you say well what do you mean brother Brooks I'm getting ready to say something that a lot of people don't understand may not understand we say oh we got a covenant but your Covenant means nothing if you don't have the token hallelujah oh I I've got I'm Abraham seed I got an unconditional Covenant not if you don't have the token yeah man amen I got the prophet's word because the the token is above the Covenant and that's what people don't understand oh I can live the way I want to because I've got a promise yes but if you got a promise that promise must be fulfilled in your life do it but you gotta have faith Hallelujah yes sir see what people don't understand you turn God down too many times and how often do we preach I think about the competition that goes along goes on even in this little church among the people you know what I'm saying I got a house you got a house All God's Children got a house no foreign but you see what people do they compete if I got a house I got to get you got to get them oh the other person got to get a bigger house or a better car it is crazy and then they'll spend all their time and then trying to make is meet all they had to do is trust God Hallelujah because the Bible said if you pay your tithes and off and God will pull you out of blessing you won't have a room to receive I believe that he said what do you what do you mean Brother Bruce look at me I'm an example of what God can do for you there are others here who are examples what God has done for them it wasn't their intellect it was the blessings of God the mercies of God the grace of God because they stayed with the word even in times of testing they gained God and made him first Hallelujah Hallelujah see there is a line between mercy and judgment and it's a dangerous thing for a man or woman boy or girl I shouldn't say it but I'm gonna say it anyway do you know how much tithing it was this last weekend two hundred dollars same on this church shame on the people who were dancing and shouting listen all of that won't get you to heaven obedience thank God I'm I'm not destitute ah Lord I Thank God God always picks me up that I don't have to depend on nobody but him but it's a shame I'm glad so many I'm gonna tell it anyhow because you got to get it out to have a pure heart right had one brother who actually paid for a couple of rooms for me when I went on my vacation after that I had a collection of 300 and something dollars that's it I'm so glad people love me I'm so glad they care for me but it's outright shame you say well what do you mean you don't know the I don't ask anybody for anything it wasn't even my desire to do so someone else thought to say that and out there was said and done I wish we hadn't even come to the church for it because I don't want nobody to think I'm begging for anything it's a dangerous thing for a man or woman boy or girl to step across a line for there is no return when you step across that deadline so tonight it might be the time that many would take their decision where they would spend in this eternity you understand what I'm saying this church and I'm sure it's everywhere else need to repent literally breaking down and crying out for the help and grace of God amen amen and you say you got the token you say you got the toe cut it's more than just knowing God sent a prophet amen amen it's more than reading the books and listening to the tapes it is the literal life of Jesus Christ Living in you choose you this day I wish more people were here it's amazing if we could just only have a heart like David David looked at that that saw God didn't have a real house and David desire was to put everything he had into it even though David had made mistakes he wanted to build God a house and God turned them down but David didn't stop serving God no no God chasing David because of his evil Deeds but David still love God Amen Hallelujah and at the end of the end of the role because David was a man after God's Own Heart see what I'm saying without the word we'll make it David saw the art coming back to the camp like the brother said last week he began to dance and shout and praise God why he knew that God was returning and this message indicate that God has returned amen but where is the dancing where is the shouting where is the loyalty to God not to a man loyalty to God Amen [Music] Hallelujah God be merciful I'm not going to be long tonight but we need the Naked Truth people just don't know that their souls are in danger they think because we follow Malachi for did not God God told Israel they were going to have a prophet did he not come he came guess what they despise Moses the majority of the people repelled against him that's what I find out in this church remember the majority of the people Rebels against the word and it ain't a personal thing it's just what people do what was yesterday is today and Solomon said there's no new thing under the sun we've got to wake up it is so late I was talking to somebody the other my son today he said it's real late Daddy I said no I know it is yes but the people eyes are blind they're trying to establish something here this is not our home it's not it's all right to have nice stuff but keep your eyes on Jesus keep your eyes on the word amen hallelujah that's the most important thing what are you going to say to God when he asks you the question why you didn't make it to church oh Lord I had an attitude with the preacher that's not good enough you don't come to see me anyway you come to see Jesus Christ Hallelujah that's a baby in the gospel a baby you're pouting you're angry you are frustrated because you can't get your way here I wish I could give you a pacifier it makes no sense here we had a time we supposed to be maturing and people are playing around like children that's what the Bible said that the children of Israel did in the wilderness after hearing the word they rolled up to play this is not a playing time this is a time of sincerity giving God all you have amen amen yes it is oppressed everybody in here know you got to press every hey you got to pray press to pray amen amen you got to press to read amen hallelujah you got to press sometime to get out on your knees Hallelujah I know what I'm talking about but I refuse to let the elements of this world stop me from serving my God Amen thank you Lord you got to know who you are when you believe this message you can't believe it halfway have one foot in the world and one foot in the message it ain't gonna work yeah but I find out that's what people do that's what they're doing Hebrews 12. 23-27. The Naked Truth people think hey oh I love God you are a liar the Bible said if you love me you'll keep my Commandments don't tell me you know God don't even believe you love him I don't believe you love it and the prophet God said this he said A True Believer Holy Ghost believer when that those doors are open they're there yeah open tonight why they don't care if there's two or three they're there amen hallelujah that's the beauty of it we've got something nobody can tell us we don't have what I've got a pool in me something pulls me something holds me and I know that who would I know who it is you know but the Lord Jesus Christ amen don't get me wrong I enjoyed all that dancing and shouting I don't mind doing it today tonight if you want to but my point is this when all that's said and done look look look where's the results of all of that all up in the front right I'm not talking to ones who who have a good time we had a good time I'm just saying I thank God for the faithful you you you can do what you you know and that's the thing what's what's this is not a time for play Amen to the general assembly the third 23rd verse of the 12th chapter to the general assembly and Church of the firstborn which are written in heaven and to God the judge of all and to the spirits of just men made perfect right amen those who are Justified you you you say well what do you mean brother I'm saying they're God there must be a relationship he said oh I'm Justified but let me tell you something the justification that they had in Luther's day was such a justification many of them die just under that that anointing to know that they have truly been Justified and when you know that your sin has been forgiven and that you're truly been Justified you do everything you can to keep from sinning against God Amen amen hallelujah amen but we find out that we got people who's got the devil for the buddy for a buddy that's what it is don't even know it and anytime you come to the word the church and I see people coming here and they think I don't see that thing that they carry in with them they carry it in and they leave out with it Secrets hidden sin and they think God don't let me see it I may not know exactly what it is but I know when I see the glory of God and when I don't amen Hallelujah even back in those old Pentecostal Church the people used to come to church with a light shining glowing all over them now you see those dull dark Spirits hanging all on people amen and even brother Bradham says in the invasion of the United States He said Christians will be packing demons is here it's now amen it's wicked stuff going on very Wicked Lord he was I believe it was the Lord that spoke to me and said even among the people you have incense now how are you going to confess that sad is sad and I believe that was the Lord and just as sure if the people don't make it right the Holy Ghost is going to expose it my amen and to Jesus the mediator of the New Covenant into the blood of sprinkling that speaking better things than that of Abel see that you refuse not him that's speaking for if they escape not who uh not who refuse him if they escape not who refuse him that spank on Earth much more shall not re-escape if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven you understand what he's saying because Abel even though he was saved had a spirit of Vengeance he cried for blood but here was Jesus father forgive them for they know not what they do is that God yes you say well what do you mean look at Stephen with the same anointing that Jesus had when he was being stoned he said father all these things not to their charge that is the token that is the Holy Ghost if Jesus said it then he says it now when someone trespasses you when someone goes against you when you have an altar whatever the case of it being you always come back to the Lord forgive them for they know not what they do amen you don't say oh you reap what you sow that's not God's anointing that's the anointing of Abel [Music] but Jesus speaks up better Jesus speaks better things than hey he speaks love and forgiveness Hallelujah now you say what do you mean brother because that's why God put you in the most evil age there is he put you in his age because he knew there was going to be a lot of trespasses he knew that there was going to be a lot of people that come your way that you came in Holly in your natural stand but he knew that if you he knows that if you're a true seed when these days come you know where to get your strength from is that right you think about think about him call him a dog Hallelujah he didn't say kill him he said forgive him let him go see that's what we don't understand that that God this is our testing ground this is the broad testing ground if you got the token you act like Jesus amen he's the same yesterday to Dance Forever he doesn't change [Music] whose voice then shook the Earth listen let me tell y'all something even if you haven't matured to that position you need to seek God as his Lord help me that's what he's here for he's the shepherd we're the Sheep Hallelujah whose voice then shook the Earth but now he have promised saying yet once more I shake not the Earth only but also heaven and this word yet once more signify the removing of those things that are shaken as of things that are made that those things which cannot be shaken May remain do y'all understand what he's saying he's basically saying there is a group of people that cannot be shaken there's a group of people that will remain no matter what God's what goes they will remain because God has sealed them with the token amen he has made a covenant with them Hallelujah he says okay now what what day is this before The Exodus what were they doing before The Exodus they were feasting on the lamb they were having a a feast I don't think they were sad when you eat it it brings a joy it brings out especially if it win is really good and I believe God made that lamb better than ever it didn't make any difference who prepared it man that was good lamb because it typed out Jesus himself Hallelujah but it wasn't that it wasn't the lamb that saved them it was the blood of the Lamb amen it was the blood of the Lamb because when the death angel was to passed he didn't say when I see the lamb he said but when I see the blood of the Lamb when I see it posted on your door posted a little I'll pass over you this is why so many Christians are in the church dying because they don't have the love or the blood of pride oh you got to have the Holy Ghost this day you don't have an awesome option oh God ain't working with no church membership no he don't care who your daddy your mama is no no no your daddy could be the preacher but every man got to be born again [Music] what did the lamb do for you that's the question no the question is listen what did he do for you mate listen you and I we we don't know how blessed we are like I said the other day the word the the trouble Great Tribulation will come to those who will will be the worst ever for those who in this message who misses it y'all understand me why no because we know and to whom much is given much is required he said Brothers you shouldn't be critical I can't help it lives are at stake and if people don't wake up the same voice they hear tonight not only my voice William random and all of the others they're going to hear again amen amen oh they look at me like I said oh Lord I don't have to worry about how the preachers of old felt you know Hallelujah I'm walking right in their shoes yeah people don't change they just as evil as they ever been right without God we can't change but it's because we lack Revelations and the revelation of the word brings us to understand who we really are Calvary what what did it mean to you he means my everything he is my everything and every listen how many of y'all can go through a day without saying Lord forgive me every day throughout the day Lord forgive me Father forgive me I'm saying this all the time amen every time my foot slip a little bit left or right I'm saying God forgive me what to go wrong go wrong Calvary he brought my shame do you know what it means we mean that that means that literally without Calvary you're naked do you understand without Calvary you wouldn't have a theophany body to go to amen you wouldn't have a place of staying you know the uh Jesus said in My Father's House of many mentions if it wasn't so I wouldn't have told you but he could say that because he was the one who purchased you amen he's not talking about houses with big fences and all that he's talking about your body amen your house this is the original house there was no buildings built when Adam and Eve was on Earth they were the housing of God themselves [Music] back to Hallelujah there may be other buildings and things according to the prophet's Vision yes but that's not what he's purchased he could give you that here it was you to the Redemption of your body he paid the price like I was telling somebody the other day and they may have disagreed with me people in their traditions and all these kind of stuff got everybody in such a bondage I get in trouble for this because people want to pay for their bride well that was Shadows that was tights that's things they did in the New Testament you don't find that no you know why because Jesus Paid the price that's right he bought his pride he paid for his bride y'all hear what I'm saying it's finished Paul never brought that up again because Jesus kept it all of them good people in bondage and as soon as they tried to move away from that you call it sin show me in the words not there it's a man-made tradition dogmas just like the Catholic church and it's so sad because people in this message got more Dormers and Creeds and everything just like the Catholic Church I get in trouble I do with people but do I care no I'm trying to Free People but some people like it you know and they like paying all that money out like that and compete we got the best way who can do the best dance it's nonsense has nothing to do with heaven I am hey you better start while you're here brother Mike my question is it's the naked truth I can tell you that amen Cal report my shame my nakedness don't put me in the Old Testament when I'm in the new amen amen who will follow this Jesus what a shame it's true but I take Jesus for mine right amen you say what do you mean you got to choose your leader there are those who's choosing Satan and there are those whose choosing Jesus Christ amen amen there are those who are choosing Barabbas and there are those who are choosing Jesus Christ I love to see a man work hard to pick to pay for me if by you now you his horse you his property and that's the way they treat you and the Bible says against the word people love your wives as Christ loved the church oh Lord but it's true anyhow amen he whom the son is set free is free indeed amen I'm free amen you must choose your leader to become the word is our ambition you understand me I'm not to be a king not to be a not to be a policeman or or a doctor or a lawyer all those things are good but my ambition in this world is to be the word amen to reflect the words just to let the world see that Jesus is Alive amen oh I wish I could do it but I can't do it I'm waiting on him but he said if I believe it he'll bring it to pass amen amen and I believe that amen I've seen Miracles just recently I've seen God heal people deliver people and everything else in the last few months and stuff why because God is moving amen and some people he's not moving because they don't even really believe yeah but when you really believe amen something has to happen Hallelujah you choose your leader I don't care you say well what are you saying brother because I have to believe I've got children who don't believe but I believe I'm putting a token on them I'm taking what I got and claiming them I must believe amen yes Hallelujah yes yes today do things I don't like every day but I love my children I love my children unconditional ain't nobody going to stop me from loving my kids but children I say my Lambs they act like kids right now but my lamb oh Lord have mercy is that right what you going to do father Pharaoh or Moses come on Amen Jesus of Barabbas choose you this day amen hear though this is just show you how messed up the mind of the church was they saw the Miracles they saw dead Rays they saw the blind open they saw all these things they glorified Jesus when he was doing all those things but when he began to bring the word foreign that's how it is when you start bringing the word people don't like the word demons don't like the word and you know when they don't like it they can sit right here and you preach that word and that demon manifests itself that's why God told Ezekiel Jeremiah I believe he said don't be afraid of their faces hey no use of being afraid of people's faces great is he that's in me then he that is in the world token the blood The Blood Brothers what do you say listen let me tell you something you can understand all Mysteries and still be lost Paul said so [Applause] you can have faith to move mountains and still be lost you gotta have the toe cut yes you got to have the Life of Christ on the inside amen not on the outside it was pretty nice to have the blood on the doorpost of the little but now that life of the blood I'm not talking about I'm a natural lamb I'm talking with the Lamb of God must be on the inside working its way out yes amen hallelujah you love the Lord people to God I don't mean to be screaming I didn't know how God was going to manifest himself tonight but I'm here to let him have his way you see because we are living in a day I I've just been thinking about this throughout the day just how we need more God I'm crying not not just for for myself I'm crying for the bride yeah I don't know who all in this church is bride I wish everybody would hear was but I cry out Lord break the chains amen destroy the yolks give us Grace to overcome he will yes it's in his word we're more than conquerors in Christ Jesus and those are the bride who don't have the token God give us the token amen bring down your Holy Spirit Break Every Chain and dispel every bit of the darkness in this place despair those who don't want to be here get rid of the Lord whoever whoever may be because the Bible said well two or three are gathered there I am in the midst yeah I don't have to worry about a large Peak number of people oh if they leave I ain't going to be able to pay the bill they ain't paying the bills anyway [Music] that's one thing I don't have to worry about the Holy Ghost is the token that we have been parted this is coming from the message token 1964 308. brother banham said the Holy Ghost is the token that we have been pardoned yes the case is closed see that's why the devil got everybody looking everywhere trying to feel it up you know with all kinds of entertainment and all kinds of stuff and the devil will let you come right in the church and enjoy yourself but with all of that he can blind you thank God for this message he can blind you to make you think you got something that you don't have but I I tell you what and I know it ain't just Divine love it ain't just love because you can love a person uh in the filial realm but Divine love goes way beyond that amen [Music] amen see we have been pardoned and it's true I know situations y'all think I'm crazy because I preach on certain things but I'm gonna tell you something young people are are suffering because they see the word but they know if they try to perform the word they will be excommunicated even from their families it's serious and if they're not excommunicated they're going to be mistreated and it ain't even a word traditions in this message the sad part about this is that when they're when they're when the evangelists when they went to these different countries they may have given them the message but but never helped circumcise them so now this thing has been so deep in it it'll take God to make a change yeah if people did that and understood it with tradition it would be a problem but when you make it the word when you make it that a man or a woman don't if they don't do it this way they're sinful where they where is that scripture that's Darkness that's not life amen anyway let me get off that the case is closed to every man and woman that truly true let's receive the he he is identified with his attorney with his judge with his sacrifice and the token he holds in his possession shows that his trip is paid to glory amen amen hallelujah it's all over he holds that token it's his the baptism of the Holy Ghost which is the witness of the resurrection of Jesus Christ amen hallelujah if you get the Holy Ghost and you ain't changed you don't have it because when the Holy Ghost comes it changes you you don't change it you don't even have to work at it it works you amen that's your identification you're holding the token now if you haven't got the token you will not be coming in huh you mean to tell me I've been faithful to the church faithful as a deacon faithful as it is faithful as a pastor I'm gonna say Pastor too because a lot of pastors don't have it yeah you must have the token that's the required price amen amen when I see the blood the blood is the token amen when I see the blood I'll pass over you you must have the token and if you don't why you won't go amen you gotta have the token now I'm gonna say this by the grace of God a lot of people got it and they have allowed the devil to make them think they don't have it dude you say that's not possible it is possible because if you don't read and study your faith is weak and that token operates by your faith [Music] amen you can have it but be a weak Christian right and that's what has happened to a lot of people listen I know what I'm talking about I've been there I'm not preaching something I'm not I don't know what I'm talking about I've been there but one thing the devil could never tell me he could never tell me I didn't have it oh he could say it but I'll tell him like this you wasn't there who would God save me when God filled me where were you because this is the relationship between me and Jesus and we didn't have a third party Hallelujah y'all see what I'm saying I'm not trying to beat anybody up I'm trying to help us tonight so that we can search and like David Lord if there be any wicked thing in me please deliver amen get it out of me I'm not preaching to one person I'm preaching to everybody even myself Hallelujah glory to God I I I I want to grow more I want to see that Divine Love Song display if somebody sped in my face I can say okay God bless you see y'all looking at me but most of us ain't there yet you know somebody can slap you do whatever you know you want to be able to do like Jesus open out your mouth Little Folks this might sound crazy but I'm gonna tell you something when the squeeze comes when and it's on his way don't tell me it's not on his way Christianity that brother Adam said he said oh and oh Lord once more one of those messages was Samson he said before Samson they had all of the side activities the monkeys and all of that dude he said but that wasn't the main attention that was the main that was not the main attraction he said Samson and Samson represented that old Fallen Church Samson was the main attraction so let me tell you like this with all of this stuff going on you know who's the main attraction this message yes people who believe this message all the other churches are apostate and all of that they they gone they've been tried found one judgment is already struck them amen they so eat up with worldliness it's the truth but this message have stood the test of time and it's going to stay because we've been our day to say Amen anybody that followed Jesus will suffer persecution amen amen that's what today they're trying to mix everything else with this Creeds and affiliations and all kinds of entertainments and everything but it won't mix there is absolutely see it will not mix with anything the blood would not miss and it's just it must be eaten ready dressed people ready for the journey and I'm like okay ready for the journey let's just stop that ready for the journey and you see with everybody it's like I don't know how I was on the Titanic but I I can imagine some people were running back for their jewelry and running back for their goal they were more concerned about those things that they were their lives and because they they couldn't let it go they went down with the normally that's the way everything go down you know you get and you hit the water or whatever say leave everything just jump out into the boat or whatever but I guarantee you people say oh I can't leave my laptop yeah but it's those moments that decide where you live or die that's what I'm trying to tell you choose you this day amen life or death amen hey you gotta understand when it's finished it's finished and I'm gonna tell you one of the things that got me so so excited because I read Jeremiah and all I could see is the world I see everything we're doing right now Jeremiah had to deal with it with Israel and when God get fed up Mama Daddy's sister and brother can't help you no read it and everywhere those Israelites when they were not obedient but you see the the the the the flip side of this thing is is that when Babylon began to rule we've been told to resist it in that day they were told to accept it our day is that if you allow yourself to fall into that system you receive the mark of the beast Hallelujah I'm almost done people I sound like I'm fussing I'm loving the people I'm loving you and because I care yeah I'm a Watchman amen I'm on the wall I see things and I'm trying my best to make sound the alarm in Zion because that's where we are and living in Christianity a Christian life doesn't mean that you can't laugh and have joy that's not what I'm saying you don't have to walk around like a board or a stiff robot I'm holy no the Holy Ghost and you will make you holy it's your boundaries not because what you think is your boundaries amen Hallelujah it sets your boundaries is what I'm trying to say and when this was applied the people must be ready for the journey it isn't for the unbelievers standing outside and sympathizing with it it's for the believer that's already under the blood already dressed sod stabbed in his hand his loins girdled and ready for the travel he didn't say getting ready he said they're already ready and we're talking about oh we're going in the Rapture my question is are you ready have the word dressed you yes thank you Lord see there are two types of people the children of God and the children of devil and there is no in between amen right now and I don't think people fully realize that if you can't accept that you're a child of God you know what you become yeah yeah and God knows I'm not a child of the devil so my point is if you know not know you're not a child of the devil why don't you just stop and be about your father's business who are you [Music] the scripture says for as many that are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God how are you going to be led that by the spirit of God if you don't even have it Hallelujah Jesus even told those disciples in Saint John 8 44-46 ye are of your father the devil and the lust of your father ye will do huh the last time your father you would do he was a murderer from the beginning and Abode not in the truth because there is no truth in him amen hey you don't have to shoot with the gun you can shoot with the tongue amen and when he speak of the LIE he speaketh of his own for he is a liar and the father of it you know most people can't take this this kind of message you know what I mean every you know you go to churches now they they preach Papa feel good message what'll make you feel good Hallelujah I just want you to make I just want to make you feel good no I don't know how you're gonna feel good with me slicing and dicing with the sword you're supposed to hurt yes yes it's supposed to go deep yes yes and sometimes it's supposed to make you bad angry with the better word but if you're a true seed of God you say Thank You Lord amen thank you Lord amen thank you Hallelujah and the bull not a truth because there is no truth in him when he's speaketh the lie he's speaking of his own for he is a liar and the father of it that people don't understand what craze and dogwoods are doing to him I use that for example but this people in this message got all kinds of crazy stuff going on and they don't even see it they denominated and did everything to it and bring everything into them you know I mean it's just crazy it just doesn't make sense instead of teaching the people to try to try to try to try to walk up that ladder of a perfect statue of Christ we teach them everything else and that is the most important thing the Holy Ghost oh nothing else matters that's right that's the thing that's why president said drop everything no matter what make sure you show you make sure you get that Holy Ghost amen I'm I'm almost on this last one coming from the same message he said the token was above the Covenant remember I said that I said because you know what the prophet God said it did not matter if they were a Jew and have been circumcised only eight days when the death angel came he could care he cared nothing about that Covenant that Covenant was done God don't care about how much through church and what church you go to oh yeah no have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe that what's bringing the company when those two pieces come together you say oh I've been in the message all my life but have you received the Holy Ghost since do you really have to talk at oh what are you saying you and I keep saying this thing about forgiveness because God that Jesus birth the church I'm honor amen you see all the Old Testament churches John Joseph and all of them they were burned those women with Brothers said when they were impregnation when they were actually delivering the baby they would say leave from they they literally blessed them by the word spoken and when Jesus was giving birth Amen to the truth New Testament Church he birthed her under forgiveness father forgive them for they know not what they do you say how can you prove that that same spirit that Stephen was birthed under he said father hold not this to their child that's the True Believer amen that's how you know you've been born again when you can forgive yeah because the devil don't know nothing about that amen amen amen truly forgive you say well I can't forget God didn't ask you to forget but he did ask you forgive me was above the Covenant but Israel had a covenant to be circumcised and any Jew could go out and show any person I can prove to you I am circumcised I am a Jew I am circumcised according to Jehovah's command but yet that didn't expel him if the token wasn't there also he must display the token you get it the token has to be there anyhow if you are in the Covenant if any Jew would say I ain't putting on no blood on my door I can prove that I am a covenant Jew the death angel got it yes no matter how loyal he was how much church member he was how much tithes he paid how he said he believed Jehovah Jehovah is required that token and he's he and he he does it today too and that's what makes this message so great because we came at a time when Church believed on my spoken tongues if I did if I shout if I belong this church or that church and all that uh no no no you can believe all that you can belong all to that but without the token without the true Holy Ghost you have no Covenant with God Amen that's why people prayers are not here amen you can't fake this it's got to be real [Music] he does it today too it's got to be it must be but there is not another way under heaven and let me clarify that because God asks a prayer in his own good time so I don't the devil say see you ain't got it because your prayer hasn't been answered no if you got it you wait till it be answered amen but there is not another way under heaven not another name given anyway no matter how good how loyal that token has got to be there and displayed amen right the blood you say well I kill the lamb and I put it in a job I've said it back here that's not what he said it must be on the little and on the door place it's got to be displayed you know what that door place is your heart amen and your life has got to display the token is in you amen oh you got you Pentecostal what's wrong with you what's wrong with you bobbed hair painted faces man dirty jokes and things where that display the blood of my Lord Jesus Christ is the token of the Holy Ghost you're having a form of godliness and calling Witchcraft and everything else the work of God oh Pentecostal witchcraft how you display the token they say I'm a Pentecost I don't care what you are I'm a Baptist I'm a presbyterian I don't care what you are that token has got to be there God requires it and nothing else but that choose you to stay Who you gonna serve I got more but I'm gonna stop right here choose you this day I don't worry like brother said God's faith having faith in God and believing and knowing that somehow I am elected and chosen to be bride God will bring that to manifestation amen I read that scripture where he said they shall be mine said the Lord in Malachi 3 16 18 right he said then they fear the lord speak often one to another and the Lord hearkened and heard it in a book of remembrance was written before him but them that fear the lord and that thought upon his name and you'll have people in this message when you fellowship with them they don't want you talking about the law they don't mind you talking about anything else but you can overdo that one people need the Holy Ghost yeah yeah that's why people don't have the joy they don't have strength because they have no joy and the box is the joy of the Lord is our strength amen and they shall be mine said the Lord of hosts in that day when I make up my Jewels I will spare them as a man spareth his own son that serveth him right then shall ye return and discern between righteous and the wicked between him that serveth God and him that serve him last day you know I find out that you can't just let a love Spirit run your day all day and then come up in here acting like you're saying goodbye people do not know they do it and they carry On and Here they look at battles on top of battles and then they know you come early enough to pray them demons off of them and don't you know demons when they come to church they connect just like the Holy Ghost you don't have to oh I'm having a battle with this you don't even have to tell nobody for me your spirits find each other it's sad I encourage everyone that's in here tonight Press On do what's necessary to please God forget about all of these things you want to achieve and understand what I'm saying we have to live in this world but Jesus Christ is supposed to be your priority when you out when you put other things ahead of him you have now become an adult I think about Joseph all Joseph did was just do his work and God promote it you do what you're supposed to do before God hold true to him pray like Daniel and the rest you don't have to worry about becoming something God will do it for you God is so rich in Mercy I love him for his grace his kindness amen we ask God for somebody to come there be anybody that desire prayer to be willing to pray for you in moments like these [Music] I lived up my hands I lived [Music] [Music] I lift up my hands alone [Music] singing higher love you singing my love foreign [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] means like me I
