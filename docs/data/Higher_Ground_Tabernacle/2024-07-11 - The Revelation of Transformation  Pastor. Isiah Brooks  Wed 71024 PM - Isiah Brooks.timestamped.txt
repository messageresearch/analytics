[41:04] bit forgot to tell you about every
[41:07] behind but we're glad to see everybody
[41:09] here tonight let's turn to our Bibles in
[41:12] our
[41:16] Bibles we're going to start reading from
[41:19] uh uh Romans the 4th
[41:24] chapter uh we'll begin at at the first
[41:39] verse God is so
[41:44] good Romans the 4th chapter
[41:49] ROM beginning at the first
[41:54] verse what shall we say then that a
[41:57] Abraham our father as pertaining to the
[42:00] flesh have
[42:05] found for If Abraham was justified by
[42:08] works he had whereof to Glory but not
[42:12] before
[42:18] God what sayth the scripture Abraham
[42:22] believed God and it was counted unto him
[42:25] for righteousness
[42:30] [Music]
[42:34] now to him that worketh is the reward
[42:37] not reckon of Grace but of
[42:46] debt but to him that worketh not but
[42:50] believeth on him that justifieth the
[42:52] ungodly his faith is counted for
[42:55] righteousness
[43:05] even as David also described the
[43:08] blessedness of the man unto whom God
[43:11] imputed righteousness without
[43:19] works saying blessed are they whose
[43:23] iniquity are forgiven and whose sins are
[43:26] covered
[43:33] blessed is the man to whom the Lord will
[43:35] not impute
[43:41] sin blessed this uh
[43:45] blessedness I mean cometh excuse me this
[43:47] blessedness then upon the circumcision
[43:50] only or upon the uncircumcision also for
[43:53] we say that Faith was reckoned to
[43:56] Abraham for
[44:07] righteousness how was it then reckon
[44:10] when he was in circumcision or in
[44:14] uncircumcision not in circumcision but
[44:17] in uncircumcision
[44:27] in and he received the sign of
[44:30] circumcision a seal of the righteousness
[44:33] of the faith which he had yet being
[44:36] uncircumcised that he might be the
[44:38] father of all them that believe though
[44:42] they be not circumcised that
[44:44] righteousness might be imputed unto them
[44:47] also
[45:02] and the father of circumcision to them
[45:04] who are not of the circumcision only but
[45:08] all but who also walk in the steps of
[45:11] that
[45:22] Faith yes of Our Father which Father
[45:25] Abraham which he had being yet
[45:27] uncircumcised that's just okay go
[45:34] ahead instead of keeping you standing
[45:36] let let's have a word of
[45:38] prayer our gracious father God we come
[45:41] before you
[45:42] Lord we thank you for this Amazing
[45:46] Grace Lord you have been so good to
[45:50] us and you have been better to us than
[45:54] we have been to ourselves
[45:57] and we pray father God that you would be
[45:59] merciful to
[46:01] us we thank you for your goodness we
[46:04] thank you for your
[46:05] grace and we thank you for your love
[46:08] divine bless this service in a special
[46:11] way in your name Jesus Christ we pray
[46:15] amen amen you may be seated I'm going to
[46:19] continue to read by the grace of
[46:22] God 13th verse for the promise that he
[46:26] should be be the heir of the world was
[46:29] not to Abraham or to his seed through
[46:32] the law but through the righteousness
[46:42] of for if they which are of the law be
[46:46] HS faith is made void and the promise
[46:50] made of non effect
[46:58] because the law worketh wrath for where
[47:01] no law is there is no
[47:11] transgression therefore it is of faith
[47:14] that it might be by Grace Amen to the
[47:17] end the promise might be sure to all the
[47:21] seed not to that only which is of the
[47:24] law but to that also which is of the
[47:27] faith of Abraham who is the father of us
[47:46] all as it is written I have made thee a
[47:49] father of many nations before him whom
[47:52] he believed even God who quickened the
[47:55] dead and called those things
[47:57] which be not as though they
[48:12] were this is what I like who against
[48:15] hope believed in hope that he might
[48:19] become the father of many nations
[48:22] according to that which was spoken so
[48:25] shall thy seed be
[48:39] and being not weak in faith amen he
[48:41] considered not his own body now dead
[48:45] when he was about 100 years old neither
[48:48] yet the deadness of Sarah's womb
[49:01] he staggered not at the promise of God
[49:03] through Hallelujah but was strong in
[49:06] faith giving glory to
[49:16] God I could read this whole
[49:20] chapter 21st verse and being fully
[49:23] persuaded that what he had promised

[50:38] seated we thank God for his
[50:41] goodness and I'm just going to take my
[50:43] time tonight I'll try my best
[50:47] anyway but i' like to entitle this
[50:51] message the revelation of transformation
[50:56] and this uh
[50:59] transformation can only be done by and
[51:03] through
[51:06] faith in the promises of
[51:10] God when we think about a
[51:14] transformation the definition of it is
[51:17] to make a
[51:20] thorough or to make a thorough or
[51:23] dramatic change in the form appearance
[51:27] or
[51:34] character and the only way this could
[51:36] ever be established in the heart of the
[51:42] people God has to drop a
[51:46] faith in the heart of the
[51:49] people a faith that will believe every
[51:55] word it's not about what we think about
[52:00] it it's about what God has said about
[52:06] it one thing I love about brother
[52:10] brandham he
[52:12] lived by what God saw or would
[52:19] see if he had
[52:22] lived by his natural birth
[52:27] what he he his father
[52:30] was what his mother was you know what
[52:33] I'm saying that old
[52:35] genealogy uh we would have never had a
[52:39] message like we have
[52:42] now and I want to say this
[52:45] to uh everybody here
[52:48] tonight you must understand that in
[52:50] brother
[52:52] Bram he had a war
[52:56] know what kind of a background he
[53:00] had and to know and to believe what God
[53:03] said he
[53:06] was you got to
[53:08] understand that there was really no
[53:10] place in
[53:12] him that would push out his
[53:16] chest to make himself
[53:20] something when he always saw himself as
[53:22] being
[53:23] nothing and that's what he
[53:27] he said there were even people or
[53:28] children in his own dat
[53:32] day that didn't even want to associate
[53:35] with
[53:36] him because of his last name
[53:40] Bram Hallelujah but he liken
[53:44] himself as to
[53:47] David when David God told
[53:50] David I have taken you from among the
[53:53] Sheep coat
[53:57] and I have I have placed you among
[54:02] Kings and I want you to understand that
[54:06] this is exactly what God has done for
[54:10] us hallelujah can I say it like this he
[54:14] has taken us from the gut
[54:20] ofmost and he's now put placing us into
[54:23] the
[54:25] uttermost hallelujah hallelujah only
[54:29] God can make something good out of
[54:31] something
[54:33] evil
[54:36] Hallelujah Faith must take what the
[54:39] message
[54:41] says and say Amen to
[54:44] it it must apply that
[54:48] word regardless to what you think you
[54:53] are first of all you've got to die to
[54:57] the old
[55:00] man when I say the old
[55:02] man if you if you've been abused in your
[55:06] life Hallelujah you've been hurt in your
[55:10] life whatever Satan put on
[55:14] you as a
[55:17] sinner you must die and R to
[55:22] that because if you
[55:24] don't it's going to hinder your walk
[55:27] with
[55:30] God say we are a new
[55:34] creature Hallelujah and if you're dead
[55:37] in
[55:38] Christ all things are passed
[55:43] away and behold all things have become
[55:47] new I believe that so whenever the devil
[55:51] trying to tag a old that old man back
[55:57] that old man is
[55:59] dead Hallelujah you see that was one of
[56:03] the
[56:04] ways the Roman people used to torture
[56:09] Christians they would kill
[56:12] one and would tie the Dead one to the
[56:15] back of the other
[56:19] person and he had to carry that dead
[56:24] man which to
[56:27] and the worms and all of those things
[56:30] would eventually kill him too you
[56:33] understand me so what I I saying to you
[56:37] if you're going to carry around your
[56:39] dead
[56:40] man it will eventually kill
[56:44] you you understand me but God has set us
[56:49] free the Bible say he whom the son is
[56:52] set free is free inde
[56:54] the Hallelujah
[56:57] and whatever
[57:00] complexes Satan put on
[57:02] you when you were a
[57:05] sinner all those complexes Must
[57:09] Die those complexes belong to the old
[57:13] man not the new
[57:15] man understand
[57:18] me the revelation of
[57:21] transformation how many of y'all
[57:23] believe that you're in the rapture
[57:28] Hallelujah I believe
[57:29] that and I
[57:31] believe everything the prophet says
[57:34] that's going to
[57:37] happen to each individual that really
[57:39] catch a hold of
[57:41] it Hallelujah is going to happen the way
[57:44] he said
[57:45] it but understand you can't work
[57:49] yourself into the
[57:52] Rapture you you you you can't even
[57:55] sanctify yourself
[57:57] it it takes the Holy
[57:59] Spirit to sanctify
[58:02] you you can't justify
[58:05] yourself you can't sanctify
[58:08] yourself and you cannot make the Holy
[58:10] Ghost fill
[58:12] you
[58:13] Hallelujah all of the works of
[58:17] God are the works of
[58:20] Grace Hallelujah this is why we call it
[58:24] amazing Gra
[58:27] Hallelujah see the Holy
[58:30] Spirit he chooses
[58:33] you or you have been
[58:36] chosen from the foundation of the world
[58:40] how many of y'all believe that come on
[58:42] somebody give God the
[58:44] praise Hallelujah the saddest thing
[58:47] about this we've got to be
[58:50] careful is that right and I'm going to
[58:53] jump in my my scripture he said
[58:57] Peter be
[58:59] careful be careful with your
[59:02] walk because
[59:04] Satan desire to sift you as
[59:09] weak Hallelujah and I'm praying for you
[59:12] Peter that your faith fails
[59:16] not y hear what I'm saying this is why
[59:19] Jesus said when the son of man
[59:23] cometh shall he find faith in the
[59:27] Hallelujah now I ain't talking about
[59:29] some other kind of
[59:32] faith I'm talking about the
[59:35] faith the faith that was delivered to
[59:38] the Saints Hallelujah and that faith
[59:42] that was
[59:43] delivered to the Saints was that God
[59:47] saved
[59:48] you not on your
[59:51] marriage not because you were good not
[59:54] because you came from a nice
[59:56] family Hallelujah but he saved you and
[1:00:00] chose you because you were in
[1:00:04] him Hallelujah glory to God I know
[1:00:07] you've heard these things
[1:00:09] before but I want to refresh
[1:00:12] yourself because your joy cannot
[1:00:16] return to its
[1:00:19] fullness until you
[1:00:22] remember it's never been your works
[1:00:27] Hallelujah James says show me your faith
[1:00:31] by your
[1:00:33] works that's the way man looks at it is
[1:00:37] that not what brother said he said
[1:00:39] that's the way man looks at it
[1:00:42] Hallelujah but God says hallelujah I
[1:00:46] your faith in what I have
[1:00:50] done justifies you it's not your works
[1:00:55] but it's the grace of God now I'm going
[1:00:58] to take what Jesus said I'm going to
[1:01:00] take what God Said Hallelujah because in
[1:01:04] the eyes of some
[1:01:05] people my Works may not be so Grand
[1:01:10] Hallelujah but in the eyes of
[1:01:12] God y'all understand me he ordained us
[1:01:17] to walk in the footsteps of the
[1:01:19] righteous Hallelujah that's exactly
[1:01:22] right the Bible says that God
[1:01:26] ordains Hallelujah the
[1:01:30] footsteps of the righteous and as long
[1:01:33] as I walk in his
[1:01:35] footsteps I am
[1:01:37] righteous Hallelujah not my own
[1:01:42] righteousness I'm not talking about
[1:01:44] fasting three to four
[1:01:47] days nothing wrong with that but I'm not
[1:01:50] talking about just paying your
[1:01:52] tithing those are the things you ought
[1:01:54] to do
[1:01:56] but your your
[1:01:58] salvation is based upon what God has
[1:02:01] already done for
[1:02:02] you Hallelujah and you've got to have
[1:02:06] faith y understand me and when I say
[1:02:10] this faith is not an
[1:02:12] emotion I feel it you don't feel it
[1:02:16] Hallelujah but Faith does give an
[1:02:20] inspiration it gives a stimulation come
[1:02:23] on some you know when you got it
[1:02:27] you know when you have it nobody can
[1:02:30] take it from
[1:02:32] you hallelujah oh I'm so glad my
[1:02:36] religion is not
[1:02:39] manmade I'm so glad that my salvation is
[1:02:43] not in the hand of a
[1:02:46] man my
[1:02:48] salvation was given to me before I even
[1:02:52] knew
[1:02:54] me was given to you even before you knew
[1:02:59] you hallah glory to God listen brother
[1:03:05] bam in the identified Christ of all
[1:03:10] ages paragraph
[1:03:14] s he said it takes a
[1:03:17] faith no matter where it
[1:03:20] is you got to meet that
[1:03:24] Faith that's all and faith is not just a
[1:03:29] myth just something you
[1:03:32] imagine it's something you
[1:03:36] know Hallelujah see that's what what was
[1:03:39] different from
[1:03:40] us we can't explain it but we know the
[1:03:45] message is
[1:03:46] Right Hallelujah we may not even know
[1:03:49] the depth of every Revelation there
[1:03:53] is we know that we know that know that
[1:03:57] this message has transforming power we
[1:04:00] know that this this message amen it's
[1:04:04] going to translate us hallelujah we know
[1:04:08] that this message is the reason why we
[1:04:10] are
[1:04:12] changed Hallelujah and the Bible say we
[1:04:16] changed from glory to glory so we as
[1:04:20] Believers We Stand
[1:04:23] still even when we don't see change we
[1:04:27] know our change is coming
[1:04:30] hallu Hallelujah the reason being he
[1:04:35] said that the if I began the good work
[1:04:38] in you I'm fa to complete hallu I

[1:05:17] faith is not something you take and do
[1:05:20] something

[1:05:28] way Hallelujah that gift is getting your

[1:05:35] way Hallelujah now if you get yourself
[1:05:38] out of the
[1:05:39] way what's in the way the

[1:08:08] this Dimension Hallelujah you remember
[1:08:11] the
[1:08:12] story Paul and Silas
[1:08:15] G they were thrown in
[1:08:18] prison and guess what they did they
[1:08:21] begin to praise God now come on somebody
[1:08:24] why because they understood
[1:08:26] that that prison was no
[1:08:28] prison Hallelujah that that prison had
[1:08:31] nothing on
[1:08:33] them y understand me because they knew
[1:08:36] the god of the
[1:08:37] prison they began to praise God maybe
[1:08:41] they were singing what a mighty God we

[1:08:48] were singing Hallelujah but maybe they
[1:08:50] were singing victory is

[1:09:06] puffing everything is going to be all
[1:09:09] right y know what I'm saying let let me

[1:09:35] a
[1:09:36] sacrifice know what you're going

[1:19:30] bought God paid the
[1:19:33] price turn with me to Ruth
[1:19:46] please yeah he paid the
[1:19:49] price and if you notice that in the
[1:19:51] Bible
[1:19:53] [Music]
[1:19:55] when a man purchased
[1:19:57] something that purchase was
[1:20:02] his sometime it had to come through Wars
[1:20:05] and
[1:20:09] fightings it's like Jerusalem that's why
[1:20:11] Jerusalem is called the city of David
[1:20:18] because he fought for it so he bought it
[1:20:21] with his with the bloodshed
[1:20:26] Hallelujah so even now it's still called
[1:20:29] the city of
[1:20:31] David that land still belong to Israel
[1:20:35] no matter no matter what the world says
[1:20:38] that land still belongs to Israel
[1:20:41] Hallelujah let me tell you this the
[1:20:44] price for Redemption was done once and
[1:20:48] for
[1:20:49] all Hallelujah and every house on the
[1:20:53] land belongs to
[1:20:56] hallelujah oh come on somebody it's the
[1:21:01] truth God promised Israel a land that
[1:21:04] wasn't even theirs
[1:21:08] yet Hallelujah but he paid the price for
[1:21:11] it that's why he said now I giving you
[1:21:14] the
[1:21:15] land but you got to fight for
[1:21:17] it but every step every
[1:21:21] footstep every step you take is yours
[1:21:24] it's your
[1:21:27] possession y'all heard what I y'all
[1:21:29] heard what I preached last
[1:21:31] week God a going to say I'm going to
[1:21:33] pick up your
[1:21:36] bed if you want healing you want to get
[1:21:39] out of your
[1:21:40] circumstances you take up your bed and
[1:21:46] walk is that the truth you know Jesus at
[1:21:50] that wedding or that
[1:21:52] marriage I mean he could went and fill
[1:21:55] those those uh uh water pots up with
[1:22:02] water but he made the servant you
[1:22:05] go you go fill it up with water my
[1:22:08] responsibility is to turn the water into
[1:22:12] wine so let let me say it like
[1:22:15] this and this is why in The Book of
[1:22:18] Revelation he said eat the whole
[1:22:21] [Music]
[1:22:22] book right I'm I'm not going to force
[1:22:25] feed you take it you eat it right if you
[1:22:30] don't eat it the Bible will never become
[1:22:32] a new book to
[1:22:36] you you by understanding and reading
[1:22:40] this
[1:22:42] message the scripture has a different
[1:22:44] meaning to
[1:22:46] it it's a different
[1:22:50] Revelation and you begin to see oh my
[1:22:52] God he is the same
[1:22:55] yesterday today
[1:22:57] forever Hallelujah now Ruth fourth
[1:23:02] chapter
[1:23:03] verse it says and Boaz said unto the
[1:23:08] elders and to all the people ye are
[1:23:11] witnesses this day that I have bought
[1:23:13] all that I W I uh that was IMC and all
[1:23:18] that was chilion in M of the hand of
[1:23:22] Naomi
[1:23:33] glory to God moreover Ruth the more B
[1:23:37] this the wife of Malone have I purchased
[1:23:40] to be my wife to raise her up raise up
[1:23:44] the name of the Dead upon his
[1:23:46] inheritance that the name of the Dead be
[1:23:49] not cut off from among his Brethren and
[1:23:52] from the Gate of his place ye are
[1:23:54] witnesses this
[1:24:00] day
[1:24:09] Hallelujah maybe you don't see it but
[1:24:12] right now this is a picture of
[1:24:16] Calvary Hallelujah Jesus Paid the
[1:24:20] price and he was a open show
[1:24:25] with all the
[1:24:27] witnesses you say no Gentile was there
[1:24:30] yes it
[1:24:31] was it was actually a gentile that
[1:24:33] helped Carry the
[1:24:35] Cross Hallelujah y'all better hear what
[1:24:37] I'm saying he purchased the
[1:24:41] place in so much Jesus said according to
[1:24:46] uh St John
[1:24:48] 3:16 for God so loved the world that he
[1:24:51] gave his only begotten son whosoever
[1:24:55] should believe in him shall not perish
[1:24:59] but have everlasting life Hallelujah so
[1:25:02] when you
[1:25:03] see in the Old Testament the
[1:25:06] shadow that God God purchases
[1:25:11] Israel and purchas a gentile bride
[1:25:16] Hallelujah with the same
[1:25:18] money they were no different money
[1:25:21] Hallelujah they were bought with a price
[1:25:25] Hallelujah and by the blood of Jesus
[1:25:28] Christ we were bought with a price
[1:25:31] Hallelujah and the world knows
[1:25:35] it but this land your land your house
[1:25:40] your Tabernacle your body your soul your
[1:25:44] spirit was bought by God hallelujah so
[1:25:48] much so the Bible says you've been
[1:25:52] bought with a price
[1:25:54] and you're not your
[1:25:57] own Hallelujah is that right so listen

[1:26:04] verse I'm sorry we let's go the 11th
[1:26:08] verse and all the people that were in
[1:26:11] the gate and the elders said we Are
[1:26:14] Witnesses the Lord made the woman that
[1:26:17] has come into thine house like Rachel
[1:26:20] and like Leah and I love this because
[1:26:24] she was no longer a

[1:26:32] Hallelujah she took on upon a Jewish
[1:26:35] y'all hear what I'm
[1:26:36] saying yes sir she and and this is

[1:27:01] may be a murderer you may be a wher you
[1:27:05] may be I don't know anything and
[1:27:07] everything but once you marry Jesus
[1:27:10] you're no longer that Hallelujah you w
[1:27:14] with him and you take on his name
[1:27:18] Hallelujah and all of this is by his
[1:27:21] grace

[1:27:49] turmoil the

[1:27:55] to find out is that the struggle was
[1:27:57] with
[1:28:00] yourself oh the devil keeping me from
[1:28:02] getting no it ain't the
[1:28:05] devil you don't want to die yeah you
[1:28:09] holding on to

[1:28:16] a two-edged
[1:28:21] sword is able to divide the soul and the
[1:28:23] spirit
[1:28:24] it goes all the way down to the

[1:30:37] into her the lord gave her conception
[1:30:39] and she did she bear a
[1:30:47] son so the purpose of Boaz marrying Ruth
[1:30:54] was to bear his
[1:30:56] offspring understand me so the reason
[1:31:01] Christ marries
[1:31:03] us to bear his
[1:31:06] offspring

[1:33:54] God knows how to play
[1:33:58] you yes sir yes sir no matter
[1:34:02] what God is good to us isn't he see the
[1:34:05] devil loves to
[1:34:07] triumph over the believer who loses his
[1:34:12] faith Hallelujah and let me say it like
[1:34:14] this when you lose your joy you heard me
[1:34:17] say this the other
[1:34:19] day
[1:34:21] back amen that's the truth because the
[1:34:24] Bible say the joy of the Lord is your
[1:34:28] strength and when you lose your joy you
[1:34:30] are
[1:34:32] weak Hallelujah is that right you become
[1:34:35] like a city with no
[1:34:39] walls the enemy can come in and do
[1:34:41] whatever he wants to
[1:34:43] do because you have lost your wall of
[1:34:47] Faith Hallelujah but you must allow God
[1:34:51] to reild your Fai
[1:34:56] that's what he said to
[1:34:57] Peter he said Peter you know the devil
[1:35:00] desire to sift you as
[1:35:02] weat Hallelujah didn't he didn't he say
[1:35:05] it and just shortly after
[1:35:08] that the devil put the pressure on on
[1:35:12] Peter
[1:35:13] Hallelujah he shifting
[1:35:16] Peter he shiting
[1:35:19] Peter hallelujah amen
[1:35:25] yes sir one Crow at a
[1:35:30] time Hallelujah can you
[1:35:34] imagine how Peter felt in his
[1:35:39] natural he doesn't have the Holy Ghost
[1:35:41] yet he just have had the
[1:35:44] promise y'all hear what I'm saying he
[1:35:47] must have feel bad felt
[1:35:49] bad you you know how we feel
[1:35:52] sometimes when when we we miss that
[1:35:54] window of witnessing to
[1:35:57] somebody that's a terrible
[1:36:00] feeling but here was Peter
[1:36:04] denying and He was
[1:36:06] cursing but see God don't make no
[1:36:11] mistakes Peter had received a revelation
[1:36:14] he couldn't get rid
[1:36:17] of
[1:36:18] Christ the son of the Living God you see
[1:36:22] one thing about revelation when is real
[1:36:24] it holds
[1:36:27] you it holds you you don't hold it it
[1:36:31] holds
[1:36:32] you glory to God and guess what Jesus
[1:36:37] said no matter what you've done
[1:36:40] Devil he's
[1:36:42] mine I bought
[1:36:44] him I'm in the purchasing business
[1:36:48] that's right that's right and and and
[1:36:51] and before Jesus could even do much
[1:36:53] after his
[1:36:56] resurrection when he was going to gather
[1:36:58] with those the
[1:36:59] disciples he told his disciples you go
[1:37:02] find
[1:37:03] Peter and you
[1:37:07] make he can't he couldn't be cut off he
[1:37:10] couldn't be cut
[1:37:11] out with with with his
[1:37:14] failures his position couldn't be taken
[1:37:16] by
[1:37:17] somebody y understand me I'm saying this

[1:37:24] bride nothing can shake your position
[1:37:28] Hallelujah your position was already
[1:37:31] determined before you got here and there

[1:43:00] how Israel whipped all the
[1:43:03] enemies they made sure they stayed
[1:43:06] within the
[1:43:08] word they were
[1:43:10] obedient to God as long as they stayed
[1:43:14] obedient there were an enemy in can land
[1:43:17] that could defeat them Hallelujah it was
[1:43:21] only When sin was found in the
[1:43:24] camp Hallelujah y'all hear what I'm
[1:43:27] saying as long as you keep the sin out
[1:43:29] of the
[1:43:31] camp victory is
[1:43:34] yours Hallelujah you know I I really
[1:43:38] believe if aen had come up and
[1:43:41] confessed and made everything right
[1:43:44] before he got
[1:43:46] caught he would have been
[1:43:48] okay but he he and he and he was so
[1:43:52] afraid
[1:43:54] Hallelujah that same
[1:43:56] fear caused the death of him and his
[1:44:00] family Hallelujah let's move on 14th
[1:44:04] verse which is the earnest of our
[1:44:06] inheritance until the r Redemption of
[1:44:10] the purchased possession unto the praise
[1:44:13] of his
[1:44:14] glory let me tell you this that
[1:44:16] scripture was
[1:44:18] fulfilled when the seals were
[1:44:20] open and the lamb took the book
[1:44:24] now let me say it like this you know the
[1:44:26] book itself was the
[1:44:28] Bible it was no other book that book had
[1:44:32] seven seals on it and it took a prophet
[1:44:35] from God to be in place for those seals
[1:44:38] to be
[1:44:39] open you understand me Hallelujah do you
[1:44:43] think it was just a literal
[1:44:45] book
[1:44:48] Hallelujah now the Bible said Jesus
[1:44:50] Christ is the
[1:44:52] word was the word the word was of God
[1:44:54] Word was God you understand what I'm
[1:44:56] saying hallelujah but you got to
[1:44:59] understand that book that he uh uh
[1:45:03] had in his hand was the Lamb's Book of
[1:45:09] Life can I say it like this it was
[1:45:12] actually it was the record of the
[1:45:14] Bride so the book itself was the
[1:45:18] bride that's why said eat it all up
[1:45:23] represents
[1:45:25] you one thing I love about it is if the
[1:45:28] lamb was
[1:45:31] bleeding the book was Dripping with
[1:45:36] blood hallelujah it's dripping with
[1:45:39] blood yes it's dripping with
[1:45:42] blood this Holy Ghost
[1:45:45] Gospel is dripping with
[1:45:48] blood the blood of
[1:45:50] disciples who died for the
[1:45:54] this Holy Ghost
[1:45:56] Gospel is dripping with I love
[1:45:59] that
[1:46:01] Hallelujah one more scripture I'm going
[1:46:03] let you go first
[1:46:05] Corinthians 6 19-
[1:46:10] 20 you love the
[1:46:15] Lord I made my song need I mean made my
[1:46:18] interpreter really
[1:46:21] work don't don't wor about it if you
[1:46:23] missed a few
[1:46:25] words the Holy Ghost will bring it to
[1:46:27] their whatever they need to hear God
[1:46:30] will have to hear it amen hallelujah
[1:46:33] sorry about that I just get so excited 1
[1:46:36] Corinthians 6:19-20
[1:46:42] what know ye not that your body is the
[1:46:45] Temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you
[1:46:50] which ye have of God and ye not your
[1:47:01] own for ye are bought with a price
[1:47:05] therefore glorify God in your body and
[1:47:08] in your spirit which are
[1:47:18] Gods one more scripture please 1
[1:47:21] Corinthians 7:23
[1:47:25] this is so
[1:47:29] important ye are bought with a
[1:47:32] price be not ye the Servants of men
[1:47:39] amen hallelujah you understand
[1:47:43] me and this is not an easy way don't
[1:47:47] think it this is a hard
[1:47:50] way and I would like to say by the grace
[1:47:53] of God is harder now perhaps than it
[1:47:54] ever has
[1:47:57] been because we're living in an age that
[1:47:59] just messed
[1:48:03] up
[1:48:06] lawlessness nothing you can't see
[1:48:08] nothing not even Christmas represent
[1:48:10] Christ no
[1:48:12] more yeah and Easter you got all the
[1:48:15] bunny bunnies and eggs and Jesus is
[1:48:18] hardly mentioned about
[1:48:21] anything you go to churches and you
[1:48:23] can't even hear the name of
[1:48:26] Jesus Hallelujah almost all the gospel
[1:48:29] song they they singing about a lot of
[1:48:30] stuff Jesus could do but they don't
[1:48:32] mention his
[1:48:34] name the truth you just got to assume
[1:48:37] who they talking
[1:48:39] about Hallelujah but I love I like
[1:48:42] hearing the name of
[1:48:44] Jesus
[1:48:46] Hallelujah cuz I want the devil to know
[1:48:48] who I'm talking
[1:48:50] about you know what I'm saying it's a
[1:48:52] true it's the true because you know the
[1:48:56] Devil Himself could be glorified in that
[1:48:58] song that's what he think he
[1:49:04] is oh Jesus but when you put the real
[1:49:06] name to
[1:49:08] it no question about
[1:49:11] it you love the Lord people of God just
[1:49:16] lift up the name of
[1:49:19] Jesus and as I said and Satan tried me
[1:49:22] on this the very same
[1:49:24] thing if you lose the battle in your
[1:49:27] mind that's that's the direction you're
[1:49:29] going to go
[1:49:31] in it's the
[1:49:33] truth you know if any kind if the lust
[1:49:36] of Flesh lust of eye pride of life if it
[1:49:39] comes you to do things that you
[1:49:44] do y understand me if you don't resist
[1:49:47] that devil you're going to end up doing
[1:49:50] just what he wants you to do
[1:49:53] Hallelujah but if you listen to the Holy
[1:49:56] Ghost if you yield your holy yourself to
[1:49:58] the Holy Spirit you're going to do
[1:50:01] exactly what he wants you to
[1:50:03] do Hallelujah now sometime the battle
[1:50:06] gets so
[1:50:08] hard especially in the mind you going to
[1:50:11] have to
[1:50:12] Jes Jesus Jesus is that right brother B
[1:50:17] said when you call on the name of Jesus
[1:50:19] Jesus will draw
[1:50:21] near Hallelujah
[1:50:24] some sometimes that's all you can say
[1:50:26] you can't hardly pray you just got to
[1:50:28] call on his
[1:50:30] name Lord there's power in the name of
[1:50:33] Jesus stand up let's stand up Hallelujah
[1:50:37] there's power in the name of
[1:50:40] Jesus Hallelujah but don't come talking
[1:50:43] to me about my
[1:50:46] Lord don't tell me what God can't do
[1:50:49] don't want to hear that Hallelujah here
[1:50:53] I am
[1:50:54] breathing I can't even control my
[1:50:57] breath y understand me what what's
[1:51:00] making this
[1:51:02] go I can hold my breath and and and
[1:51:04] won't be able to to keep it because I'm
[1:51:08] not
[1:51:08] controlling God is
[1:51:10] contr God is so loving and so kind to me
[1:51:15] to grant me breath and I can still
[1:51:19] breathe that means it there's whatever
[1:51:22] he choose whatever there is I need you
[1:51:25] got to
[1:51:27] believe if you believe it you can
[1:51:30] receive
[1:51:32] it and I just believe that the same
[1:51:35] Jesus William brandom
[1:51:36] [Music]
[1:51:39] served I don't know what your problems
[1:51:42] are if there be
[1:51:44] any you know don't talk to me talk to
[1:51:48] him that presence that you feel is not
[1:51:51] my spirit
[1:51:52] it's his Spirit Hallelujah and right now
[1:51:57] while he's
[1:51:58] here while the waters are being
[1:52:02] troubled maybe you have searched for a
[1:52:06] job or a
[1:52:09] wife whatever it may be no prayer
[1:52:13] request is
[1:52:15] stupid
[1:52:17] request is important to God no matter
[1:52:21] how small it is
[1:52:23] no matter how great it is my God is more
[1:52:26] than able that's the Bible he's more
[1:52:30] than able to do
[1:52:33] exceedingly
[1:52:35] abundantly above whatever you ask or
[1:52:38] think God never
[1:52:42] fails but what we need to
[1:52:45] do understand that every trial we go
[1:52:50] through is not chastised
[1:52:54] sometime it's just
[1:52:56] training test and
