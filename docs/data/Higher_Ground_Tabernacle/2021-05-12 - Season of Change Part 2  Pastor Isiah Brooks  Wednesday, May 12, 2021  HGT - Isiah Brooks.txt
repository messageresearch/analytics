a deep fall to the deep like a great magnet [Music] [Music] me [Music] feel [Music] your calm is moving me to give [Music] lord please come and take control i feel [Music] moving me [Music] surely surely i agreed [Music] lord please come and take control i feel [Music] god is good to us [Music] i trust everybody is feeling that pull my brother sang the song i'm going up yonder and he kind of mentioned some things about being changed will be changed from mortal immortality hallelujah as we stand let us turn to hebrews the first chapter i appreciate the lord jesus christ it's quite a shame you know we my wife and i passed an assembly of god church and the parking lot was full what a shame that when we come to a place that we say we believe is truth yet the people are so lazy if i could say it like that dilatory however you want to say it they just don't show up but for those of you who do uh god has a reward for you you are the word and the bible says the bible says that's jesus christ what is the will of god even the prophet god said a true born-again believer can't hardly wait till the doors are open and uh my wife and i when we were looking at that i don't know what time church started but they were there and uh it was such a rebuke as far as i was concerned because we say we know him hebrews 1 and like i said how do you love someone you do not know just the other service we were talking about that and we're still talking about seasonal change this is a time where things are changing whether you like it or not it's happening and one thing i know for certain that god can't change his mind i wish i could zip it up how could i say it i wish i could just speed things up in my life to that perfection but every change is important everything we go through every storm no matter what it is it's important for our growth we don't have to understand it but we must trust god if you trust him it'll bring a great peace to your heart and your mind because you know that everything he does and everything that he's going to do is for your good think about the people that has that that have made it to heaven how shameful they would be what they are when they realized that what they were going through god was in it and how often they thought god wasn't there when he was the one carrying them he said he'll never leave us nor will he forsake us and that's exactly what he means hebrews 1 glad to see those of you who are here we're just happy and like i said i'm not here to to uh bring anyone to shame i i just know that as a pastor we see things that the parishioners or the saints of god don't see this is why we call a shepherd we see dangers that you don't see and that's why we understand and understand the importance of coming to church and i'm talking mainly to the people if they are listening online not those of you who are here but the ones who are online those who rather stay home and look at it from a distance but god knows you sitting there and he can address your situation even from here because you're just a dimensional way hebrews 1 10 through 12 and thou lord in the beginning has laid the foundation of the earth and the heavens are the works of thine hands they shall perish but thou remainest and they all shall wax old as doth a garment and as a vesture shall thou fold them up and they shall be changed but thou art the same and thy years shall never fail i love that isaiah 40 and 8. trusting you there isaiah 40 and 8 the grass withereth the flower fadeth but the word of the lord shall stand forever in the latter part of that scripture it also says surely the people is grass so we know what's going to fade away and what's going to fold up what's going to wrinkle up if you want to put it that way however you want to put it you're going to change whether you like it or not let us pray heavenly father god we come before you lord and we thank you for your amazing grace i thank you for how you direct us and your leadership lord and our leadership is not of men but it's of your holy spirit and we appreciate everything that you do for us lord even in our greatest efforts we do make mistakes but lord we are so confident in your sacrifice in your blood in your in in your victory that we can rest within you knowing that you have accomplished everything that we need to accomplish and that our accomplishment lord is in you so father we thank you for tonight we thank you for your amazing grace we thank you for everyone that's here tonight i pray god that you would bless them lord not in their heads but in their hearts that when we leave this service tonight we would feel that desire to want more of you lord grant it father because you told us lord and you have said in your word that if we'll seek you early we will find you bless each and every heart we ask these things in your lovely name jesus christ amen you may be seated i like to entitle the message season the season of change and this is part two we preach the other part on sunday for part one and i want to start with the thought that everything changes but the word of the lord change in itself can be something that is seasonal it could also be something that is permanent the things that god changes with the intent of it remaining that way is a change that is permanent change comes sometimes silently sometimes change comes lasting you know with lasting it with time sometime it comes abruptly you know uh you know like a peaceful day turning into a stormy day a tornado or a hurricane something that comes and it abruptly brings a change and once it's done the change is apparent you can see it with your own eyes what the change did make change is something also that something that you and i have really no control of it of it's something that god ordains he he has already uh sat in his heart in his mind what he it purpose to do with each and every one of us sometimes like i said it comes in a way of permanent like for example how cain and abel was very peaceful they had a wonderful no doubt relationship until the time of offering when they began to sacrifice and it was church time and then not even knowing something was working and they didn't even know it and that's the thing change happens things work to bring change and sometimes you don't even see it until the change has come because i'm sure that uh cain did not see that his brother they were going to argue and his brother kane was going to slay him understand change was made and that change was permanent it was something in this dimension that could not be changed until god would do something about it i know i'm using the word change as part of the definition but nevertheless you understand what i'm trying to tell you we look at this thing and we we see that you know in us god is the only one that can bring a change the bible says no man can add one cubit to a statue oh how we wish that once we when we first got saved we would have just snapped into into perfection and you know take a rapture uh is our greatest hope but that kind of a thing you know it takes a process and every process brings about change i i'm talking about change because you remember when years ago the president of old was saying change change we didn't realize what kind of change we were going to see but now we see the change and a lot of us don't like the change some may like it but i don't i'm just being honest and when we come to see that change involves movement you know like right now i'm standing here but if i move i've just changed my position i might remain the same person but i'm not in the same place i used to be but in this case we want to change from one place to another but we also want to change with the change like the bible says from glory to glory right and so we we must understand by god's grace there is only one thing that doesn't change and that's god in his word and they're not two entities they are the same he is the word and the bible says he cannot lie right we've seen god move throughout history moving from justification to sanctification to the baptism of the holy ghost and even when the baptism of holy ghost came in 190 1906 in isuzu time everybody thought oh my this is the ultimate cannot be any more changes and god says this is just the beginning baptism of the holy ghost is that you're just now being born into the spiritual atmosphere or dimension that we talk about but you're not done yet there is another change coming and you see the church at large did not understand that that change was coming they the pentecostal church thought they were the ultimate and then when god began to move by way of uh malachi uh uh you know four coming in and showing us that we we there's another change coming and um they couldn't understand the change you know how that is most people don't like change most people like their comfort zones and you know what god is god change things and god will bring you out of your comfort zone just to make you who you are let's just throw this out for an example there were no group of people that was as starchy as the jews and when god brought the change from law to grace they were jumping out of windows and running up the streets saying he's alive he's alive well if people had seen them the moment or a day or two before this change happened they would have not they wouldn't have not noticed that these people were the same people that were saddened but now they are full of joy and that's what joy does it changes the disposition you know some changes are not healthy for you even in the natural we're not supposed to worry we're not we weren't built to be to worry we weren't built to fret we were we weren't built to be fear those things bring tumors and blood pressure and diabetes and all of these diseases that attaches themselves to us because we we allow ourselves to take a negative change hallelujah i'm looking for a change i hope everybody else is looking for a change i'm looking for a change like our brother samuel says i'm going up yonder now yonder might not be but so high but i'm going there surely people is as grass and that's the thing that that word struck me when i was studying sure the people are as grass you know how we walk on grass and basically that's what god is saying you are insignificant until a change comes and he's the only one that can change you he's the only one that can take a dust of sand and make it a star he can change you and god is not looking for some passion of job like brother branham said god is not right now we're talking about our total change a new creature i don't know about you but i thirst for that to be completely new with all things far be far far behind me hallelujah and you know as i know even as you mature as a christian satan tried to bring up some of the past and he'll never get to you until you accept his thoughts and ideas about you and the first thing he tells you is that you haven't changed but see when you have come you come and you know god you know him for yourself see jesus christ himself is a revelation the holy ghost is a revelation it doesn't matter how people say oh i got it but you see their action shows whether they really believe that they have it or whether they have it or not because when the holy ghost comes in you there is a change there the change is so drastic that others will realize that they know it because you have changed from death unto life you can't be dead and say i've changed no life is something that is seen noticed realized malachi 3 and 6 says for i am the lord i change not aren't you glad about that i'm so glad god is not bipolar you know i'm so glad he's not double-minded i'm so glad that god don't change on me you know when i repent i expect his forgiveness is that right because he said if you repent from your sins he will forgive you there's no ifs but it's about it if you are sorry that you've done wrong he's there to forgive you and i could walk up amen i could walk clean like i tell people i might go through my changes through the day but at night when i go to sleep i'm sanctified and i stay that way so when i wake up in the morning i wake up sanctified now the devil might be on my in my ear have y'all noticed that sometimes you wake up and the devil got this crazy song in your ear you're like where is coming now you got a battle with that song with a christian song of some sort or a word let's move on i think what we need to do is learn how to accept our change most christians say well i believe the word yeah well actions are always speaks louder yeah you can say whatever you want to say but whatever your actions are it tells who and what you are accepting that which has already been achieved y'all understand what i mean we're not the achiever per se he is the achiever and when you begin to accept you who you are you recognize i'm looking for change as that brother keep brought to my attention which is wonderful it was a thought i had been preaching on change and then he said this thing sean you are the change and i thought that's right now oh come on i came in this dimension in this age to bring the change hello so did you don't look for somebody else to bring the change you are the change all we need is the anointing amen we need the anointing of the holy ghost so that the change can be permanent hallelujah we don't have to figure it out the true seed of god will not in a place to try to figure out how the change is going to come i wish i could find a scientist that can tell me how i'm going to change from mortal to immortality i wish i had somebody who could tell me how jesus turned the water into wine you know what i'm saying i wish there was somebody here that can tell me how he took a dead man by the name of lazarus that was dead four days and made his fake and man knew he probably had baby skin but we've got to learn that we're we're gideon was the same we're like gideon did you know that even though we don't know him per se gideon was a type of you didn't say lord i've been a christian all these years and all i could see is that the devil comes and he's tearing my house up he's stealing everything that you bless me with he's taking it from me if there be god and if you still with israel if you still with the bride where be the miracles now gideon is looking for a change from somewhere else and god says no no no you're the change i put those thoughts in your heart i put that desire in your mind i put that that that that yearning for miracles in you because you're the one i'm going to use you see that's why god put this in you if you have a yearning to witness you're the change if you had a yearning it meant to pray for somebody to be healed you're the young you're the change all those things that god puts in you to make a thirst for we know that there is a law where the deep call to the deep there's one to respond but god is not looking for you to look around you the bride hallelujah listen to the scripture think about it people wanted to change so much to when john the baptist came they thought he was a monster they thought he was crazy but they wanted the messiah y'all understand me but god always hides himself in simplicity hallelujah god is right in our faces most of the time and you know his presence is so unrecognized we just move right through him all over him not now i'm not saying not i'm not pointing fingers but i'm saying as christians as a whole that's what we do and here was john the baptist here god was working with him and these people show that they weren't really into the word because if they were into the word they would have known john the baptist was not the messiah can you imagine for those who really thought he was the messiah how it must have been when he was thrown in jail and his head was cut off and john the baptist himself kind of got you know like an eagle you know eyes got a little blurred the trials and the tests were were were real and they were wicked come on somebody there's nothing worse than waiting in a jail cell knowing that your head is going to be taken off come on you don't think the devil is in there oh yes he's in your head trying to get in your head and john the baptist says hey tell me you go ask him is he the one or shall i look for another john is saying am i supposed to die yet right because john has already said at the baptism i must decrease and he must increase so john knew he was to go off the scene but he wanted comfort and then when the scripture came back and said that jesus was you know healing the sick and raising the dead and doing all those things that john knew the messiah was going to do he knew the change was of god huh this scripture ephesians 1 3-7 it says blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who have blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ and remember i told you last week you want spiritually spiritual blessings on earth you know it's you want god to give you all the spiritual stuff and yet you earthbound your connor is what i'm trying to say you got to go up higher remember and then the angel said unto john come on hither what i'm going to show you you won't get it down here you got to be in the spirit is that right and the bible said john was in the spirit on the lord's day you've got to be in the spirit to understand what this bible is talking about especially in this age the message that we've got we've been given is only spiritually seen and by revelation right you can read that book and you can listen those tapes all day and you'll still know nothing about what he's talking about i think it was i think brother troy and i was talking and you know it's lying upon the line and preached up about priesthood and you you know we're talking about you know you know in between yeah god don't mind you reading in between but you're in between going to end up back on the line it's got to come back to the word i don't care how you in between it it's still got to come back to that word because that word will never fail the way fade away it is what it is yes now listen what i'm saying listen to the word this is beautiful blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who have blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ christ mean anointing so if i'm going to get these blessings i've got to go in the anointing to get them it doesn't come by economy it comes by being in the spirit a consecrated life help us jesus listen as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him i believe that amen i don't care what kind of life i've lived in the past i have failed and i've come short so many times but this i believe he chose me i just want to fall back and say catch me angels he chose me he chose you because you was good no let me ask you a question if god chose you where were you when he chose you you were in him there was no other god he said there is no other god out there i didn't have no other choice but what i found in me [Laughter] somebody help me here so you see by god's grace how can you lose it like i said last week sunday when adam and eve says oh they have come to the place they know good from evil they have become gods before then they had no other will other than the will of god and they were children of god right but what they didn't understand was evil or let's put it this way they did not understand the thing was that serpent made them discover their will they had a will outside of what god you understand me he made them discover their will and when they discovered their will instead of staying with the will of god they moved on because you got to realize that the whole subject read between the lines was about multiplying that's what god told adam and eve we multiply and we pleased the earth then god sent a prophet in this day and told us that it would be given to adam and eve what time to do this but the serpent says listen there's a knowledge you don't know about and you can have these kids as whenever you want to your will y'all understand me that's why that's why i try to tell people you can't give nobody to the holy ghost it's god's will whenever they get it you can cry and scream all night long but until god accept you until god says now is the time right oh you think about it you know god told abraham you're going to have a son your name his name is going to be isaac and i'm going to tell you when it's going to happen now he gave them the promise how long ago 25 years before it ever happened how many of us would have waited on that but see that made abraham who he was a true seed of god he was willing and ready to wait i don't care how long it takes said so hallelujah you understand me so if you got a wife you got a son you got a daughter and i got plenty of children that god promised me that would be saved but guess what i'm gonna wait when his time is that's the win is going to happen i can shake him i can beg them i can plead with them but it will never happen until god's appointed time that's what anything i just feel like shouting john up here when you think about what god is doing we must learn that's that's what adam and eve did not do they didn't wait right it's just like when god told saul killed everything i went over this the other day kill everything everything that means the king the queen the beast the dog the cat whatever kill it all he thought he's going to save the best of it you can't you're going to flatter god you're going to tell god that what you this is what you asked me to do there's a better way there's no better way you know moses could say well lord why are you sending me through this sea you told me to bring the kids out see the children out see that's that's how it is you must learn to trust him with all your heart don't try to analyze what he's doing just trust him when you pray you pray with faith and faith says it's mine you don't have to see any signs you don't have to see any wonders faith says it's mine listen adam and eve didn't have any signs and wonders they just had the word and if we're going back to that we must learn how to trust the word 100 without a feeling or a sensation thank god if that comes but that does not mean god is in it sensations don't mean god is in it ah sensations oh sensations man yeah when i was in the world likes to dance on the floor and i used to always feel like a wind would just so i understand what sensations can do for you according as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the lord so you learn how to wait that's what saul couldn't do saul didn't know how to wait and he went on and he you know that's how people do they always try to give you the answer when you already know it why do we do that when god has already told us what the answer is we try to find the answer out to somebody else like they're some kind of great psychiatrist or something when god is the word and you know what's right because as soon as you move wrong you feel it anyway let's move on have him predestinated us and what happened to saul he lost his position god dethroned him is that right what happens to the foolish virgin brother said they were made out of the same material but one didn't go any didn't go as far as it should have they had both the same word they had the ball both had the same opportunity oh yeah i know y'all think the foolish version out in the denomination that anywhere they are they they were called out come out of her people come out wherever they were they were all sleeping and slumbering and god said come out of there amen [Music] right now people don't even think the holy ghost is important and they can looking right at the coming of the lord look at the attacks of israel look what they did to our gas line they say it's back online now and we're going to have gas in seven days but you know what i thought to myself oh man these people are playing games oh what you think where is satan's eden who's ruling the world you better believe it so when the devil worshipers say that satan is a ruler it's true having predestinated a you know children of god you don't have to do wrong for devil worship to hate you despise you or dislike you sometimes people don't even know why they don't like you it's the spirit in them they don't mean no huh it is what they are who they are you ought to thank god you are who you are having predestinated us to the adoption of children not meant to be down this road by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will like that old infidel that said to brother branham do you what god you think god exists and he and all those people through the dark ages mothers with their babies being ripped out of them and people being set on fire and thrown into the lions and he's sitting there enjoying it oh who gave god counsel you know i think about foolish people i'm saying that is a dumb devil i'm telling the spirit in the man now you know what i'm saying come on somebody i mean you can't even make yourself well when you get sick what kind of control do you have over your life but anyway let's go on you're going to judge god okay so we look at this thing and you see it it's his will it to the praise it's all about love you know we love him because he first love us amen this is about love divine love and you got a dying rock nothing lives until it dies and rot and that's where i met in my life lord whatever speck of dust dirt whatever darkness in me i want it out i want this perfection i see it i believe this message with all my heart i know it's for me i can't rush him but i'll wait like job said to my change come on oh i felt like shouting i'm telling you y'all i to preach now i got but i got dancing in my feet tonight amen but if the spirit of him romans 8 11 that rays of jesus from the dead dwells in you he that raised up christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in heaven no sir that dwelleth in you the spirit if it's going to change you must be in you to change you not around you not above you not about you it must be in you hallelujah glory to god talking about a change and we're being changed even when you don't know it how many of you how many how many of you have ever seen a baby grow no you haven't you've seen the change but i don't think any of us see ever seen toes grow out right and i always tell people i said maturity is in the dna now that was a fresh one there maturity is in the dna can you imagine oh lord i don't even know what i looked like when i was a baby but i'm glad maturity stepped in can you imagine being big like this with the face of a baby in the head of a baby oh god have mercy oh thank god for maturity you understand me what i'm trying to tell you is that in the dna of jesus christ maturity is in there there is no way you can miss it once the blood is applied amen hallelujah brother brahma said it like this that god gives you and me a blood transfusion hallelujah and what's the blood of christ which is the spirit of the holy spirit whether it's the holy spirit in you that's in that spirit is going to change you god is going to woo you woo you and woo you until that change comes that's god we're in the season of change am i expecting it i see it are you ready you're complete i am in him but you know what i will not be satisfied until i see the blood change the blood that changes me you understand me the product of the change by the blood i won't see that product here like i said when that theophany or that that word body comes to me it will be no great big change you know i want it to be so that i can just step right on in it yeah i believe that's it romans 2 7 says to them who by patient continuance in well-doing seek for glory and honor immortality what you're seeking it you want it you got to have it you see what i'm saying you're not resting on your couch and you know just being you know at ease and zion no you're saying you're looking you says i want that lord i want that glory i want that honor i want that immortality more i want that eternal life you promised me eternal life i want that at whatever cost at whatever cost we can't remain in the spirit of laodicea and expect to make a rapture rich increasingly good and have need of nothing and so many people around this message they just don't have need oh i like being when he said he said there's a difference between being blessed and have blessings oh i like that that'll never leave me you know because everybody's ble have blessings that's right just and the unjust have blessings but everybody ain't blessed yeah jacob was blessed esau had blessings he still got him he got all that all over there silver and gold have none but such as i have right i'd rather be as poor as dirt and have jesus on the inside than to be the wealthiest man in the world and that's what the devil makes you think you're not blessed because you're not you're not blessed because you ain't got all these riches and all these things let me tell you something when you die somebody gonna get it anyhow they carry nothing with you nothing and you have us worried about all of the stuff and you can't carry not one dime with you that was that amazes me how people pack all the jewelry and the rings and everything in the coffin i'm like what a waste of money yeah you said but you said what about those grave rivals you had those grave wobbles i mean i ain't gonna ever do that kind of thing but at least they know there's value in that coffin but they ain't going after your body they're going by what they're going for what you possess you say oh brother brooks that's an unnatural but in the spiritual don't you know that's what they have in churches grave robbers they rub all the dead bodies rob all the dead people spiritually of their money and their jewelry and their houses and their land grave robbers we're at a time now that we're at a place where change must come and i'm going to keep pushing until further now we've got to change we can't make the change ourselves but we do know who who changes i mean think about it he's god like i said he that come to god must believe that he is god and that he's rewarded them that diligently seek him they don't get mad with the devil the devil's doing what he's supposed to do we must do what we're supposed to do right in times of trouble he shall hide me let me tell you something everybody in here is dealing with something but i'm gonna tell you something if you if you're hidden in christ there's a peace that passes all understanding you can't even explain it sometimes i come in here and i'm not feeling good in my hallelujah i'm not feeling good in my flesh but on the inside don't touch that can't touch that said to me the other day you you're always happy and i'm like how do you know that i didn't know i didn't know it was being seen but on the inside i'm telling you in my heart i am by god's grace listen ecclesiastes three and six and i'll come to something else in just a minute a time to get and a time to lose a time to keep and a time to cast away a time to rin and a time to sow a time to keep silent and a time to speak and you know that's one of the one of the things that we can't understand when to keep silent there's sometimes you need to shut keep your mouth shut right if you got to hold it together hold it together if you got to run out the room run out the room but you must be able to discern when to keep the mouth shut man what right you understand what i'm saying because this is what gets us in trouble if eve had not talked to the serpent she would have never fallen what made her talk to him when god had already told her stay away from that from that you know don't even touch it so she was she was practicing social distance way back then how you doing you know what i'm saying let's move on but you can see how ridiculous these things are but she talked to him and he made reason let me tell you something if you talk to the devil that whispers in your mind he's going to deceive you you better you better stop him right off you know when he come to me i said wait a minute devil that's not even me i don't say no more i don't even have to say i rebuke you devil because i shut him out resist the devil amen a time to speak a time to love i'm telling you my wife will tell you she knows me better than any as soon as i know i say something wrong i'm saying forgive me yeah that's what i do you know and if i allow pride to hold me you don't have to worry about it pride never wins i'm going to always come back and say i'm sorry oh some of y'all need that lesson but you see what we don't we need to understand by god's grace is that when offenses come and i'm learning when offenses come if you do not correct it you are allowing the devil to have heyday he's going to enjoy beating up on your partner and beating up on youtube and the whole point behind it is all about pride we are can i say it failures to begin with within ourselves we are failures to begin anybody in here have walked a day without sin huh without making a mistake somebody help me here because i really want to know how you do it but we're constantly lord forgive me lord forgive me lord i didn't mean it lord help me i mean it's a it's a dead it's a this is how you stay under the blood god knows your heart that's why he gives you the holy ghost don't you know it's wonderful to be able to identify sin or whenever you're wrong there's so many people that don't even see that they have no knowledge they have no conscience of it look what brother bradham says in the end to me oh if the church could ever get to the place to where it could solemnly rest upon god's eternal word to be the truth think about it see that's the thing we're not resting we're not resting like we should but when you know the world you gotta you gotta stay there you know you can't start looking around like peter you know lord the tempest is you know that's when you begin to sink stay right there keep your eyes on the word say whatever you would say devil but the word says and i'm resting on the word what a difference huh you got to rest on it rest upon god's eternal word to be the truth what a difference there would be what a correcting there would be what a cutting away there would be what a joy there would be see until you rest that god's word is true there is no change he can't bring a change the bible says we are all have all come short of the glory of god oh none was worthy you see what i'm saying nobody paul peter james john there's only one not even william branham that was jesus christ the only one worthy to open the seals to loose the book um y'all understand what i'm saying you know pride is an evil thing it comes and you don't even know you have it but it's very destructive i've seen lives ruined because nobody wanted to submit hallelujah and what is that but a feeling pride never fed me pride never clothed me pride has never done nothing for me but to make me fall and ashamed um you say well what are you saying even adam and eve had pride right after they fought fail no don't well you know the the woman you gave me the woman says uh the serpent why i just said lord we were wrong we did just what you said we we shouldn't do it we did it god had to pull the truth out well who told you you was naked see that's what pride do it won't tell the truth it you know it won't go deep enough to expose the devil it'll keep you from exposing the devil because you feel like oh my world is going to go apart if i tell this i'm going to well let me tell you something if you don't tell it where are you going to end up at don't let pride hinder your walk with god that's what peter did too you know he had pride right oh lord i ain't going to deny you i'm going to be right there with you god said telling the word correcting the word or trying to tell the word you're wrong y'all understand that and she says oh you're going to die deny me three times before you know the cockroach three times you're going to deny me oh no yeah i wonder how he felt you know how shameful he felt you know what i'm going to tell you something all of us has done it one way yeah one three times more than yeah we've all done it when we should have stood up for jesus we did not alleluia help us jesus what a difference there would be what a correction there would be i got to move faster what a cutting away there would be what a joy there would be what a power there would be when men and women would take god at face value what is the truth no matter what the circumstances look like that has nothing to do with it god says so that settles it that was good see because i know as human being we do it but we've got to stop it we got to ask god to help us to stop that if god says i'm healed i'm healed all right i got a situation right here amen well i had a situation but i've been claiming my healing see what to see how quickly the devil tried to make you own something that's not yours anymore never was mine hallelujah all right and these old doctors trying to tell me oh please i says lord you raise the dead you bring life this is just a little something but brother books what if you lose your sight i shall know him i shall know oh my god i wish i could feel what i'm feeling up here when god was going to destroy the world one time because of his sin and wickedness noah built god an ark we do not wish to try to achieve anything listen because see what i'm trying to say is that if you don't accept the achievement you don't accept what he's already achieved you're going to miss the rapture you understand me you must accept what he's done for you like for example a pardon is not a pardon except to be received as a pardon and everything that christ has done is finished when jesus said it's finished that's exactly what he meant but he needs somebody to believe it's finished and if you can believe that he can work you up to the place where he wants you to work because you're not struggling with condemnation you know we struggle with that stuff and we shouldn't be so condemning ourselves it shows that we're lacking confidence in the word with the stripes we're healed oh not that god is going to deliver us he's delivered us already he's healed us already he saved us already we're in heavenly places now in christ jesus because of him but we must accept that i wake up every morning now desiring to be in heavenly places remaining in that heavenly place i don't want to be in the natural and you know i got to do natural things but let my spirit be in that heavenly place huh because there's nothing for us to achieve in this way we just accept that what's already been achieved god caused noah to build an ark that would save the world if they would believe it ah right now who is our ark jesus christ and all they had to do they didn't have to you know build the octaves you see the whole world missed it because they would not accept what god had already done he provided a way of escape he provided a way of safety and those who denied the way it was lost but if you just believe that it's already done how it takes the law and throws it out the window i love this grace because i i don't know what y'all but i need i'm laughing but y'all don't know i need this grace i don't know if grace wasn't here i don't know oh lord have mercy i need this grace and you don't want your portion give it to me i'll take it but god knew they wasn't going to be saved so he made it just so many cubit long and as he did in the days of noah he promised to do it at the coming of the son of man he's got a gospel it doesn't reach out and let men and women come into the kingdom of god loaded with sin and unbelief it's narrow but it's the way that's what i tell these folks oh i believe the message let me tell you something they believe moses message and look what happened you can't tell me that noah didn't have a mega church i know he did because moses had one but at the end of the day how many did he have left it was a new generation that came up but at the end of moses ministry really the ones who had followed him amen and got to that place was joshua and caleb the new generation had to be re-circumcised at least noah had a little bit more than that see you can't stop the sun from shining with unbelief you couldn't stop the program of god with your unbelief john the baptist said god able of these stones to rise children to abraham see god's word has spoken it's got to come to pass see somebody's going to hear it somebody's going to get the benefits of it i don't know about you but i'm one of those somebodies now you could be something i'm not going to be selfish you could be someone else you could be one of those somebodies but he said somebody is going to get it somebody is going to get the benefits of it and we'll all free moral agents can take our choice but look what happened in the days of noah all that heard were called fanatics they made fun of him up on the hill building this ark never water had come down and science might have come to him and said where is the water at show me where he's at it is but god's program has never been upon material things it's been faith in his word that's god's provided way to take his word for it believe it something that you cannot scientifically prove nor says i cannot tell you where the water is but god told me it's going to come that's good enough for me i don't know how i'm going to be raptured i don't know but it's good enough for me he says so i believe it i'm taking it into my soul that's what i live for you think i've tried walking this christian life all my life just to come up short i don't think so well i know it's not so you shouldn't either we're too close to to the finish line but you're going to have to realize it ain't about all of you and your ability to do anything my mind there's a lot of preachers that's going to be in hell a lot of them going to be left behind too hello powerful singers can call jesus on the scene but that ain't it gifts and callings are without repentance is whether god has chosen you to be bribed and let me tell you something right now the bride knows her season she knows it she can't help it she can't explain it but she know now is the time to hurry i said hurry and make yourself ready she knows it she feels it it's in the air oh god help us see i can't tell you where the water is but see that's all i know god told me he's going to come and that's good enough for me so he built the ark and made ready for it made ready for it the bride makes herself ready why are you making yourself ready because you can see the rain is about to fall right and brother branham said it like this he said it's the same thing when the pressure from the council of churches come on the church he says it's too late you already got the mark you can't make yourself ready he said that's equivalent to what it is when when rain started falling everybody wanted to come on now he said but the door was shut it was too late then can i say something i want to say this the holy ghost is not a feeling the holy ghost is a person don't get your feelings mixed up with the holy ghost that's pentecostal i don't feel him you ain't got to feel it he said this this is the word in that day you'll know that i'm in the father and the father's in me and i am in you how do you know he's in me he said he was i don't have to feel him i don't feel what that got to do with anything you know i got a liver i don't feel my liver they say i got an appendix too i never felt it but it's in there i believe it it's one of those things i don't have to see you know it's a great thing it's great things are quiet things i got this from brother troy we talked about it today i thought he don't even know it but this is good this goes with a message did you know that friends listen the sun which gives life on the earth to every living thing in botany life plant life tree life whatever more it brings forth life the sun does and it can call can draw a million gallons of water from the earth and he he quoted that and almost could see all that water going up like that now you can't see it but the change is being made you can't even feel it but the change is being made and all of a sudden you see clouds up there how did they get up there it was a process where the changes of these uh oxygen and all that other kind of stuff whatever brought it together now the water is above us you can walk through a cloud won't harm you right but did you know those same clouds can bring forth some bad hail and i think in texas they said that they had hail like that broke up people's cars and everything just last week i think it was a week before last really bad glad i wasn't in that storm but the point is these changes are made think about the people who had a real nice shine that day and the storm came and just tore their car to pieces you know it happens like i said sometimes changes come abruptly ask a woman who's impregnated she's going to have a baby the doctor told her she got two men two weeks late or two weeks more to go and the baby says not so comes abruptly you didn't know it was coming all of a sudden here it is it's on you see you was expecting it but it abruptly came and it came at a time when you least expect it and that's how the rapture is going to be that's how the change is going to be it's going to be a secret that's why i try to tell people i don't know exactly how we're going to see it how it's going to be he's coming 63 and i know we're going to meet him but the point is everybody won't see him not this time everybody didn't see jesus when he was raised when he raised up into those clouds on his disciples those who followed him right so what are you saying i'm saying all i know is however he does it because god interprets his own word i'm so tired of men trying to tell me how it's going to be done i don't care as long as i'm part of it and i ain't going to break up i ain't going to have this doctor know what's going to be done like this that's exactly what brother bram said he said the pharisees and the sadducees one came on the white horse one came this way he's going to come this way and hear jesus come on a donkey the messiah on a donkey who's going to believe that well he had a group of people who saw the messiah entering into jerusalem crying hosanna hosanna see god will never leave himself without a witness hallelujah see and it came it can draw a million gallons of water from the earth make a less noise that we can't get a bucket out of a pump brother branham knew how to put things together because that's the truth i don't know whether y'all well some of y'all might know with a pump and how to pump water yeah you got to work hard to get a bucket but it comes unless you got a good well it comes and all of that noise and god can do that and he amazes me oh we think we have a lot of knowledge and have to have a brass band to be a lot of jumping up and down and we ain't got a and we ain't got a good meeting we think everybody has to be on top they're clapping their hands and things and we think the music has to be going in a rhythm and everybody running up and down the island we had that and we good what good has it done where is it at where has it got us today come on and i don't mean no harm i came out of pentecostal church or apostolic i mean we tore it up yes sir i always came out of the church wet from sweat i said always but most of the time y'all know what i'm saying and you know what it is we became legalist if you don't do it this way you're wrong you ain't got the holy ghost it's like if you don't speak in tongues you don't have the holy ghost what a lie and if you don't shout what a lie and if you don't dance i tell you what i get sick of that systematic stuff and i want to see change change me lord if i got to do that change me everybody can do that anybody can do that a sinner can get under that anointing and dance but that ain't you just come out wet we need change we can't allow our church to be systematic and so in a system you know i've been guilty i'll tell you what i've been guilty i'm guilty as charge i want to see people happy and i love to see them jump and i i love to see them just worship but you know what everybody got their own way of doing it we can't become systematic and we have been and i perhaps you know been part of it but now we're tearing it down every man must be free what we want to see in this little fellowship and i'm going to close in just a bit but what we want to see is change i thought about i said lord maybe i should put a bulletin board up there a bit a big piece of sheet of paper up there so everybody can write their testimonies on how god has changed them i like to see that because you know people don't tell oh god don't deliver me from that and then you don't have to sign your name to it right in a way that nobody knows your handwriting but i love to see those testimonies you can't tell me god is not doing things people i know he is with me hallelujah right think about it it was going well and i'm finna close in just a bit it was going well with cain and abel until abel uh uh abel was murdered and you know it all seemed lost i don't even know how adam and eve felt but somehow you know they were emotional about it because adam and eve knew that cain was not theirs he couldn't carry on the bloodline like i said can you imagine when god gave uh eve seth because we didn't know that uh eve had girls until brother branham told us and you know the thing is you know can you imagine how he they must have fell when seth came up another boy god has appointed me another seed and brother balaam said that was a type of the resurrection abel went down and seth came up right then men began to call on the name of the lord amen hallelujah see it wasn't adam and eve's business at that time it was god who appointed the seed right but this is the message that we have heard from the beginning and that we should love one another now see i'm bringing something here because we're talking about rapture material not as cain who was jealous of his brother who sought to slay him and did slay him i read a little capture today you know about uh we just say man don't don't mess with that guy man he's a backstabber y'all know what a backstabber is it's a person who comes behind your back and discredits your character you know but now they don't they don't stab you in the back they shoot arrows you don't even know but you got all these things in the back and you're wondering why people are looking at you so strange and so funny that's true don't you know people who take lies before they take the truth they love to hear that strange stuff and people will go off and take oh well i think he's somebody i was this this is the truth i was accused of about a brother in my church i used to go to i won't call no name and my pastor at the time believed this guy now can you imagine how hurt i was when my pastor said the lie that he he received to me was a reliable source oh i know i got the holy ghost because in those days the days prior to that that would have been a fight i would have convinced him a different way y'all looking at me like i'm crazy but see y'all that's old man that i'm just telling you that's the way it would have been he wouldn't have so smoothly gotten away and the guy that lied to me finally came back and made the right thing to to the pastor but never confessed to me never made it right y'all understand me but just listen listen those things those deeds always show up because this brother don't even believe the message anymore god has a way concocted a real lie but the hurting part was my pastor believed it that's why i am so ever so ever cautious about things i hear i don't swiftly move to things because people want me to swiftly move i weigh them i pray over them i seek god for how to handle things god knows it's true it might bring me down in my spirit a little bit because i'm worried about you know what let me say it like this i believe i'm working with the bride and i know i must deal with you according to the way god would have me deal with you i fear god more than any if you all of y'all say i'm going to kill you and you're going to deny this word i'm saying hey should i get the knife or the gun or whatever you need to do it with because it ain't no backing up on this anyway let's move on not as cain who was that wicked one and slew his brother and wherefore slew he him because his own works were evil and his brothers righteous so basically he's saying it was all about jealousy right think about how you would have felt i i won't say you think about how cain must have felt when he realized he was not in the lineage of adam and god could not accept him because he was not of the chosen bloodline god ain't choosing nobody you're not going nowhere unless you're of the bloodline of jesus christ that's it he said listen cain if you do as your brother i'll let you live a good life a moral life and i won't even separate you but he goes and he kills his brother why because his daddy was a burden spiritually but cain exemplified what his daddy really was like see all your big statues and stuffed shirts didn't go with god you might be a ddd or phd or double ld you might be a bishop pope or whatever you might be but it takes god to make something out of nothing as long as you can be nothing god is the something as long as you can get yourself out of the way then god can come in but when you're so stuffed up and started till you got the biggest and the best you haven't got nothing that you ought to have and that's a humble heart before god and we know that brethren certainly sure you never did see hear the sun rise or never did hear that see and my whole point is these changes that are being made in us you don't hear it you don't hear the crackling and all of that something but somehow you must know i'm not where i used to be there's got to be a growth there's got to be a growth right when the word of god was open amen according to uh revelations 8 1 amen the bible said there was silence in the heaven by the space of a half hour more was done in that little half hour than anything else and you said what do you mean brother brooks yeah i've seen people well as this date to that day that day to this day you know what different does it make it was silence that means nothing was being said well in heaven nothing was being said but on earth hallelujah i can see some i can see that right i mean here it was amen god spoke to saul he heard him the other one said it's thunder then when god was calling samuel samuel runs to saul and said did you call me it was silence to him but samuel heard the voice of god that's why brother said you could be in the same meeting one can hear the other one cannot some see the pillar fire some don't right one brother told me years ago and i he says oh you didn't see the pill of fire said but you wasn't there how you gonna tell me what i haven't seen with a pillow fire he brought his little doctor and i said brother you too late whatever you're trying to convince me of you too late for this i know what i've seen and i've seen the pillow five more than once i'm not bagging i'm saying god appears to whoever he wants to he's the same yesterday today and forever and because i've seen the pill of fire doesn't mean i'm even saved that has nothing to do with salvation the millions right in israel they saw the pillar of fire pill-up cloud and still was lost oh i'm trying to hurry i'm almost in my last scripture he went right on revealing his word to the body and vindicating him same by himself his children begins to kind of look more like him because it's fully maturing you hear me this is from marriage and divorce they become children of the word not children of the church children of the word and the word bride will be lovely little lady of the word unadulterated not touched by any man's organization this is why i try to tell you i'm not going to be your king i'm not going to rule you like that i'm not going to let that spirit of the nicolaitan come on me i'm not going to try to make you do nothing i preach the word you make the choice people say are you so soft well i'm soft this is how god made me if you know my daddy my natural daddy you'll be glad i'm soft but my point is show me a rough dove then i could say well there is a type but you got to understand when i'm up here it's the holy spirit ministering to you i have to be very careful on how to say it the way he wants me to say it i'm going to be judged for it that's right i mean just last week i had somebody told me i was too soft and i'm looking at him and i said but you're too hard see the judgment can go both ways right and my point is this when it comes to the word of god i know what it means for people to to dominate you i'm not here to do that you know the church age preachers do that in laodicea they do that but the headstone has come hasn't he hey eliezer had to move out the way brother brooks got to move out the way this is this is the time for isaac to make love with his bride i have no right i no preacher does but they do it anyway and they're going to have to answer to god for it you can't man handle god's bride and think you're going to get away with it absolutely not whoo y'all don't get quiet but it's the truth that's why it's so bad out there that's why it's so bad out there people don't even know how to make spiritual judgments and things of their own because they're used to people telling them what to do no you got to have your own holy ghost what's going to happen when the pressure come and you don't have a pastor over you you got to learn how to hear your god voice my sheep hear is my voice and a stranger they will not follow that's maturing right oh come on even in the natural your kids begin to grow up and say mama you can't tell me what to do now they better not say it like that but in other words they do what they're going to do i'm grown they'll say yeah when a child comes to that place and they're searching for their uh manhood or womanhood they're gonna do things that you're not gonna agree with because they're searching the land they need to know how far they can go what they're supposed to do how they can do it you understand what i'm saying it's a part of their identity to know their uh capabilities you need to know your capabilities in god and the bible said all things are possible to them that believe why have a boundary right yeah i got friends right now who are in marital mess up because they were in a church where the pastor told him who to marry now that they've left the church amen with their wives they don't want them anymore now they're remarrying yeah pastor told me this ain't no figment of my imagination i'm telling you what's real what's true around this message telling you what to who to marry come on but anyway if they did tell you and you did it you that's your fault you let them do that you made the choice like like brother brown said that girl she doesn't lost her mind coming i know johnny loves me if johnny loved you he would have married you he made the choice no matter what his daddy said people try to tell the truth [Music] i'm almost done i'm just going to read these listen i'm coming to the end of this i got two more scripture amen matthew 25 34 and 40 i'm going to try not to expound too much on it then shall the king say unto them on his right hand come be blessed of my father inherit the kingdom prepared for you and from the foundation of the world for i was a hungry and you gave me meat i was thirsty and you gave me drink i was a stranger and you took me in now there is a balance to what i just said a few minutes ago people of god because the spirit of god also says that you need no teacher you know people use that i don't need no teacher then brother bam says you got to have a balance today god said teachers in the church you see what i'm saying and the pastor is there to help you to lead you you know but what i'm trying to say the part i'm trying to work with is your maturing into making decisions and god decisions i hope i got that over god i'll show you what i was trying to say if i was hungry and you gave me meat i was thirsty and you gave me drink i was stranger and you took me in naked and you clothed me i was sick and you visited me i was in prison and you came unto me then shall the righteous answer him saying lord this this gets to me every time when saw ye hungry and fed thee are thirsty and gave thee drink when saw thee a stranger and took thee in or naked and clothed thee or when saw we seek or in prison and came unto thee and the king shall answer and say unto them verily i say unto you and as much as you have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren ye have done it unto me now we always look at people from outside those thirst what about the people among your church your assembly that you don't even know their names where they live at you don't have no idea who they really are you just know they come to the same church and we ought to be ashamed of ourselves because we're supposed to be the family of god see this is the kind of level this is the level of love that we're supposed to be on when we make a rapture that we so automatically do things in the spirit that we're not looking for a reward but anytime you do something looking for a reward you get your reward your reward is maybe thank you somebody going to tell you thank you if that's what you want but you know what i don't care about that when something good is being done i don't care if nobody recognized me i don't care now let me tell you something there was a time that i used to but i don't anymore i don't need no recognition like that i just want his recognition when i read this i want him to say i did that i will you know i mean without even thinking about it my last scripture matt uh first corinthians 15 15 we're changing we must look for change we must thirst for the change we must ask for the change we must examine ourselves to make sure that there are things there to be changed you all know what i'm saying you got to watch cleans up every day you got to look into yourself see your faults and acknowledge him make those confessions unto the lord talk to him tell him what your desire is i don't know i hate this world i just don't like it i don't care i know that word care sometimes it's a hard word but it's it's almost like every man for himself in that way when it comes to god straight and narrow is the way and only a few be that find it i'm not expecting a a great crowd you know uh being a brother was talking today when brother bam said he went up to chicago and shook chicago and all he got was rosella we think we got shaking we got to get a whole bunch of stuff shook well look how he went through jerusalem and nazareth and all these places one here one here one here one here every now and again he'll get two but it's always been that way not the majority of people behold i show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but ye we shall be changed in a moment and in the twinkling of an eye at the last trump for the trump shall sound and the dead shall be raised corruptable and we shall be excuse me raised incorruptible and we shall be changed for this corruptible must put on incorruption and this mortal must put on on immortality so when this corruptable shall have put on immortality the flesh is grass let me tell you you can put all kind of weed killers on it everything else and make it looking good but it's going to wither i look in the mirror sometimes lord have mercy so when this corruptable shall put on incorruption and this mortal shall put on immortality then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written death is swallowed up in victory o death where is thy thief saying o grave where is thy victory the sting of death is sin and the strength of sin is the law but thanks be to god which giveth us the victory through our lord jesus christ therefore my beloved brethren and this is what i'm encouraging you with tonight the last words of this message be steadfast unmovable always abounding in the work of the lord for as much as you know that your labor is not in vain in the lord in the lord let's stand we appreciate you all for the sacrifice i know it's tough sometimes when you worked all day and come sit still for a while and i understand how sleep can capture you at times and don't bother it don't it doesn't bother me when i when i see the struggle because i understand the struggle but most of all god understands it more so than i do but i say to you by god's grace you know whatever you do don't forsake the assembling of yourself those who are online and hear me saying what i i'm saying it's it's more important now that you come to church and hear the word of god whether it comes through me whether it comes to troy whether it comes to isaac or whether it comes to samuel or whoever the brothers may be there's always something that you can hear and gain from hearing the word of god you know even if it's something that you feel like it's it's been repeated or whatever don't you understand the more things are repeated the more you can remember it and know it so people of god don't ever shortchange god i just believe that when i come to church i don't care who's preaching i'm going to get something i've never left the service without getting something you see what i'm saying and usually it's what i need to have for that day so i appreciate the lord i appreciate his ministries and appreciate the musicians and you know all of us who work together to help this assembly go forward like i said this is just a portion of the bride but if you of anything you must see you must see yourself as an individual as the bride not collectively you one and if you can see that then god can work with you take his promises this message is great and i i tell you what i i'm really excited about [Music] i don't know how but i'm just so excited i believe it with all my heart i'm closer now than i've ever been let's just have a word of prayer father god we come before you lord we thank you for your grace we thank you for your mercy we thank you for every heart that's here

persecution of the bride but you said lord god just at that time there's going to be a translation there'll be a little short quick work something that you'll do oh god i guess the way you did it
