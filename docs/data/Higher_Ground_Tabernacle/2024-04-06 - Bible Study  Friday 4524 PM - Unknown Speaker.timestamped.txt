[0:00] after their daddy Ahab and when I say
[0:02] Ahab I mean you know Ahab had a lineage
[0:04] and so this king would rise up and he
[0:07] would do right then after he would do
[0:09] right that he would die and then another
[0:11] king would come up and he would do wrong
[0:13] it was like they were like a a seesaw
[0:16] they were always up and down up and down
[0:19] up and down and they had terrible kings
[0:22] that led them into bail worship and all
[0:26] kind of idol worship and they they were
[0:30] the kind of sin that Israel were doing
[0:34] really should have never been named
[0:35] among them these these sins uh fleshly
[0:39] sins that were basically the things that
[0:41] heathens would do or the the Canaanites
[0:44] and all of the Hittites and all of these
[0:46] other things they were so influenced by
[0:48] these people and to be honest with you
[0:51] it all came through
[0:54] religion and that's why God did not want
[0:57] you know a Believer to marry a non
[1:00] believer because that that nonbeliever
[1:03] if he had he didn't believe in in the
[1:05] god of the believer he had the tendency
[1:09] of swaying them to to to believe their
[1:12] God we've seen that by the grace of God
[1:15] uh through Solomon Solomon married all
[1:18] those wives and at the end of the day
[1:20] Solomon was a idol worshipper we saw
[1:24] that with with uh Jezebel and a Ahab and
[1:29] and he followed with with Jezebel and he
[1:32] ended up idolatra so so what I'm trying
[1:35] to tell you is that when it comes to
[1:38] Faith you need to marry if you're going
[1:41] to marry someone fall in love with
[1:43] someone it need to be somebody that you
[1:46] are equally yolked with and believe the
[1:49] same
[1:50] thing y'all agree with that because
[1:53] otherwise you're going to have a battle
[1:55] on your hand an unnecessary battle and
[1:59] so I I'm saying these things because
[2:02] this is what brought the scene Jeremiah
[2:05] scene they had become so uh caught up
[2:09] with everybody else's religion and
[2:12] everybody else's way of doing things to
[2:14] they Lally forgot about God exactly what
[2:18] we're doing now right they come to
[2:22] church they they they did the things
[2:25] that they would do and then they would
[2:27] come back in go in the church as if they
[2:29] didn't do nothing they were clean you
[2:31] know and and that's not the way God
[2:33] wanted God hates that that's why I kind
[2:36] of brought in Revelations 3 where God
[2:40] talks about uh uh Le theia you L you
[2:44] lukewarm and and you not he hot nor cold
[2:48] you lukewarm and he said that kind of a
[2:50] condition he said makes me sick to my
[2:53] stomach and I'll spew you out of my
[2:56] mouth those of you who have read the
[2:58] first chapter is uh is there any
[3:00] questions we're not done there yet but
[3:02] is there any
[3:03] questions is there anything you would
[3:05] like to say okay we'll move
[3:09] on now we we realize that God God told
[3:13] Jeremiah now listen it's going to it's a
[3:15] tough time and I want you to understand
[3:19] that U it's not going to be easy now did
[3:22] not God say in all day I'm trying to
[3:24] pull everything together because if you
[3:26] you you really enjoy Jeremiah when you
[3:29] see that Jeremiah is basically talking
[3:32] about our day everything almost
[3:35] everything and and you see even the
[3:38] behavior of preachers right there in
[3:41] Jeremiah and it it amazes me because God
[3:46] is the same yesterday today and forever
[3:49] always remember that if God judge Israel
[3:52] for a certain thing he will judge you
[3:54] for the same thing he's not going to let
[3:56] you just do whatever you want to do and
[3:58] call it Grace
[4:03] God is a just God and like I said Grace
[4:06] is given unto us only to do what is
[4:09] right he gives us that space and time to
[4:12] make things right that's what Grace is
[4:15] Grace is not okay I'm under grace so I'm
[4:17] going to sin sin sin sin sin no that's
[4:22] disgrace Grace is the opportunity that
[4:25] God gives us to make that thing which is
[4:27] wrong right let's read the 17th verse
[4:34] please he said thou therefore girdle up
[4:37] thy Lo and arise and speak unto them all
[4:42] that I command thee be not dismayed at
[4:45] their faces lest I confound thee before
[4:50] them now is that what we
[4:53] feel when it comes to witnessing most of
[4:56] us are afraid to tell the truth to
[5:00] people to their face because we are
[5:03] afraid of their faces and God say don't
[5:06] be afraid of their faces let me tell you
[5:08] something and this is something that was
[5:10] given to me just the other day we ought
[5:13] to have the opportunity when we have the
[5:16] opportunity to witness we ought to
[5:19] witness readily and speedily as if the
[5:22] man was drowning and he's about to die
[5:26] because really in reality you don't know
[5:29] when his next breath is going to be
[5:30] taken from him and a lot of time we say
[5:33] oh I'll wait till the next time well he
[5:35] might not have a next time to tell him
[5:38] about Jesus but the thing that that is
[5:41] we're afraid of we don't we don't want
[5:43] people to hate us we don't want people
[5:46] to dislike us we want people to just
[5:48] like us and and and appreciate our
[5:50] religion that's not a true that's not
[5:54] what Christianity is about We Are
[5:57] Soldiers we're warriors with the lights
[6:00] of the world is our responsibility even
[6:04] as it was Jeremiah's responsibility to
[6:06] tell the truth no matter how much it
[6:10] hurts for behold I have made thee this
[6:13] day listen what he tells you don't
[6:16] listen people if God has built a wall of
[6:19] fire about you you don't have to worry
[6:22] about the
[6:23] enemy he can do all the Talking he want
[6:25] to he can do all the listen there was a
[6:28] sister and I know her she just went on
[6:30] to be with with the Lord she loved the
[6:33] Lord so much but her husband would beat
[6:36] her but she kept praying for him she
[6:40] kept uhh praying for him and believing
[6:43] God and she kept on loving him and one
[6:47] day he went to hit her and he had a
[6:51] stroke and he was in a wheelchair till
[6:53] he
[6:54] died now she had to push him around you
[6:59] understand me
[7:00] God knows how to turn the
[7:03] tides but we've got to learn to
[7:06] understand that there is no weapon
[7:08] formed against us that will
[7:11] prosper none that's truth that is truth
[7:17] now God didn't tell you that you'll
[7:18] never get
[7:19] slapped but he said listen he'll give
[7:22] you the ability to turn the
[7:24] cheek and listen I know this sound
[7:28] crazy but the the Bible says touch not
[7:31] my
[7:32] anointed that's mean all of us that's
[7:36] not for just a preacher or a prophet or
[7:39] some teacher or something that's
[7:41] all and do my prophets no no harm when
[7:44] he says touch not my anointing I mean us
[7:47] then he sings it down to a prophet and
[7:49] do my Prophet no harm right because God
[7:53] is the one that is on our on our side
[7:56] remember uh I was just listening to the
[7:58] uh a message look looking at unto unto
[8:02] the Unseen and brother Ram is telling
[8:04] the story about how the rifle blew up
[8:08] and the devil tried to kill him and he
[8:11] said uh the one doctor said he's it's a
[8:14] miracle because God had to been standing
[8:16] near because there was enough power in
[8:18] that explosion that would have taken his
[8:20] head off and you know brother M makes
[8:24] the statement he says well the devil
[8:26] tried to kill me but he can't do it till
[8:29] my time is
[8:31] up yall understand what that means no
[8:34] doubt they wanted to kill
[8:36] Jeremiah they did a lot of things to him
[8:40] they I don't want to get ahead of myself
[8:42] because you know I can I can do that I'm
[8:44] trying to stay just kind of line by line
[8:46] so it'll build up by the grace of God
[8:49] but they they wanted to kill him but God
[8:52] had already told him behold I've made
[8:54] thee this day a defense City and an iron
[8:59] pillar
[9:00] and Brazen walls against the whole land
[9:03] against the kings of Judah against the
[9:06] princes thereof against the priest
[9:08] thereof and against the people of the
[9:11] land and they shall fight against thee
[9:15] but they shall not Prevail against thee
[9:19] for I am with thee said the Lord to
[9:22] deliver Thee the battle is on on we
[9:26] can't we can't stop the
[9:28] battle the battle is on all right so so
[9:33] so let me let me
[9:39] um let me go here to
[9:43] uh excuse
[9:53] me there's something I wanted to read
[9:58] quickly
[10:03] but when it comes to uh uh let let's go
[10:06] to the scriptures
[10:10] here let's start let's just I know I'm
[10:14] jumping around but let's start at the
[10:15] 13th verse and kind of go down
[10:17] again again the word of the Lord came un
[10:20] me
[10:21] asking what do you
[10:23] see and I replied I see a balling pot is
[10:29] lid lifted from the north to the
[10:32] south then the Lord said unto me
[10:35] disasters will be poured out from the
[10:37] north and on all who live in the
[10:43] land and now I'm reading for another
[10:45] from a different version but it it's I
[10:47] read this because it's kind of it's
[10:48] clear he said indeed I am about to
[10:51] summons all the Clans and kingdoms of
[10:55] the north this is the Lord's de
[10:58] declaration they will come and each King
[11:01] will set up his throne at the entrance
[11:03] of Jerusalem gate they will attack all
[11:07] her surrounding walls and all the other
[11:11] cities of Judah I will pronounce my
[11:13] judgment against them for all the evil
[11:16] they did when they abandoned me to burn
[11:19] incense to other gods and to worship The
[11:22] Works of their own hand now I'm going to
[11:25] stop right there because some of us may
[11:27] not know what's happening in our country
[11:30] but remember when brother brandham said
[11:33] that the Demons of the ant luian day
[11:36] went into Hollywood and from Hollywood
[11:40] Hollywood has corrupted basically the
[11:42] whole world you know they used to hide
[11:46] who they worship now they are giving
[11:48] praise to Satan they're talking about
[11:51] how they are the sodomites and how they
[11:54] are you know uh Babylon and and they
[11:57] they they laughing like it's a joke
[11:59] because but they they saying in a
[12:01] boastful way now I'm saying in these
[12:04] things so that you can understand that
[12:07] what we see here in Iowa we have been
[12:10] really preserved I mean we see some
[12:13] things but we don't see all things and
[12:15] and and but this country as as well as
[12:18] other countries is rotting to the core
[12:21] and God has brought a judgment when
[12:24] brother Brandon brought the message
[12:26] indictment he was like he was just like
[12:28] jerem IA bringing the indictment to
[12:31] Jerusalem or Judah and and and you and I
[12:34] must understand no matter how long it
[12:37] takes it must happen the word of God
[12:40] cannot come back void I read this thing
[12:44] about the the pot because here's God
[12:47] saying I've got a boiling hot pot of
[12:50] water and I'm going to pour it all over
[12:53] Judah in other words I have brought
[12:55] judgment and she she's going to she's
[12:57] going to feel the Judgment that I have
[13:00] brought and that's what we don't see we
[13:03] we we it's almost like a parallel that
[13:06] that now judgment is coming because
[13:07] remember Elijah came to bring judgment
[13:11] he came to bring judgment right now we
[13:13] see okay he said that great and uh uh
[13:16] notable day but you and I must know amen
[13:19] that there are those who are are blessed
[13:21] in here and there's a there a group that
[13:23] is cursed and God has come to to fulfill
[13:26] the cursing of Elijah and you say what
[13:29] what do you mean when judgment struck
[13:31] the W West Coast that was God and Alaska
[13:35] almost sunk California had a terrible
[13:38] earthquake you know what I'm saying
[13:39] y'all remember that historically and we
[13:42] now right now amen a a again in the same
[13:47] situation but you have never ever seen
[13:51] in the history of man in our day you
[13:54] have never seen a nation fight God like
[13:58] this nation
[14:00] are y'all aware of that and when you
[14:02] challenge God God will take the
[14:06] challenge this is why we've got to stand
[14:08] we've got to be the example because
[14:11] listen if there was somebody to repent
[14:13] in Jeremiah's day they would have
[14:16] repented and guess what I'm going read
[14:19] this I thought I thought I put it in my
[14:21] notes but I don't see it but I I'll say
[14:24] what
[14:26] happened a lot of things happen but the
[14:29] thing that God was really angry uh with
[14:33] is that they forgot to rest the
[14:37] land they didn't do the
[14:40] Sabbath and because they didn't do the
[14:43] Sabbath God said your punishment is 70
[14:48] years in
[14:50] Babylon as
[14:53] slaves and you say well what do you mean
[14:55] brother
[14:56] Brooks I'm trying not to jump but I'll
[14:59] say it like this a lot of the enemies
[15:02] walk right through the Gates of
[15:05] Jerusalem walk walk right through the
[15:09] gates there was no there was no real
[15:12] defense cuz everybody was tied up into
[15:14] their own little business and God
[15:17] brought judgment he brought Kings into
[15:19] the gate now you say what do you mean
[15:21] what's happening to
[15:23] us our enemies are walking right into
[15:26] the gates call it the order whatever you
[15:29] want to call it but they come they have
[15:31] free access to this country and they're
[15:34] not coming here to do a
[15:37] picnic they are God's ordained people to
[15:41] bring judgment on us that's what it is
[15:46] you got them down there killing folks
[15:48] stealing taking their homes squatting in
[15:50] their yards and their houses and
[15:51] everything else and nothing can be
[15:54] done what is it God's judgment on
[15:57] America because what we what did we do
[16:00] we turn our back on God now we want a
[16:04] Revival you crossed the line
[16:07] already there's no more Revival in
[16:11] America every individual could have a
[16:13] Revival but not the whole nation we're
[16:17] done judgment we're hanging in the
[16:20] balance just like it was and guess what
[16:23] they still marking God like they marked
[16:27] Jeremiah they still mocking God they
[16:31] they mock you oh uh we believe in in
[16:34] William brownon we believe in the the
[16:36] messenger of the day we believe he was a
[16:37] liar Elijah you know they mock us but it
[16:41] doesn't matter because God has already
[16:44] set judgment on this nation and nothing
[16:48] can turn it
[16:49] back right I was telling the brother the
[16:52] other day I think it was Brother Rich
[16:54] and I were talking iot uh but anyway we
[16:58] were talking
[16:59] about all the things that that that that
[17:02] is taking place because brother bam
[17:04] talks about be prior to the Rapture the
[17:06] bride will receive an an anointing will
[17:09] receive an outpouring and um you know
[17:12] you see this ex coming through uh the
[17:15] country and everybody talking about
[17:17] Nineveh Nineveh but we remember Nineveh
[17:20] wasn't first destroyed Nineveh was going
[17:23] to be destroyed but Nineveh
[17:26] repented right but now we know that
[17:28] there is no
[17:31] repentance you know all we can do the
[17:33] bride the Bride of Jesus Christ is
[17:35] making herself ready and like say right
[17:38] at that cross that little thing is a
[17:40] Rapture now not meaning it's going to
[17:42] happen exactly on the eighth but brother
[17:44] brandom said it will set in
[17:47] motion A Spiritual
[17:49] Awakening for the
[17:52] bride and I'm looking for it because I
[17:55] realize by the grace of God something
[17:58] has to Shake us to make us realize we're
[18:02] at the last
[18:03] days no hiding place you can run
[18:06] wherever you want to run there's only
[18:08] one hiding place and that's in Christ
[18:11] Jesus if you reject that there's nothing
[18:14] left for you he said I will pronounce my
[18:17] judgment against them for all the evil
[18:20] that they did when they abandoned me to
[18:23] burn incense to other gods and to
[18:25] worship The Works of their own hands and
[18:28] that's exactly what we do we got
[18:31] football we got basketball we got all
[18:33] these Sports they worship worship their
[18:36] God they they they you know how can I
[18:38] say it it's so bad to to they don't care
[18:42] if you know that they're worshiping
[18:43] Lucifer and everything else
[18:46] yeah like I was telling somebody I said
[18:49] that's why you got to ask God to deliver
[18:51] you from television and all these other
[18:53] things because you are literally
[18:55] allowing yourselves to be entertained by
[18:57] serpent seed
[19:02] he says now get ready stand up and tell
[19:05] them everything that I command you do
[19:08] not
[19:09] imit intim do not be intimidated by them
[19:14] or I will cause you to to you to cower
[19:19] before them in other words don't don't
[19:21] don't don't let no no nobody intimidates
[19:24] you
[19:27] Jeremiah
[19:31] and we're so we're
[19:33] so so
[19:35] weak and I Pray by God's grace that when
[19:38] we finish this lesson that you'll
[19:41] understand that that this lesson is not
[19:43] talking about Jeremiah he's talking
[19:45] about you Jesus Christ the same
[19:48] yesterday today and
[19:49] forever and we cannot allow ourselves
[19:53] Amen to be defeated now they did a lot
[19:57] of things to Jeremiah that you can find
[19:59] Christ in it they beat him they did all
[20:01] kinds of stuff they threw him in prison
[20:03] and then an Ethiopian man came and
[20:05] helped delivered him out of that prison
[20:08] like that the colored man that came and
[20:09] helped Jesus carry the cross even though
[20:12] Jeremiah didn't have to go to the Cross
[20:14] amen we know that God still had little
[20:16] symbolisms there throughout that showing
[20:19] that Jeremiah still walked a a part of
[20:22] of his own life and what we need to
[20:25] understand by the grace of God is that
[20:29] he is a present help in a time of need
[20:31] and I I can't stress that enough and I I
[20:36] I by God's grace today the 18th verse I
[20:42] am the one who have made you a fortified
[20:46] City an iron pillar a bronze wall
[20:51] against the whole land what is he saying
[20:54] I have made you
[20:57] undefeated you can't be defeated I've
[21:00] made you out of this
[21:02] material the Bride of Jesus Christ
[21:04] cannot be
[21:06] defeated because of the material that he
[21:09] has made us out
[21:10] of and I know just say well look at this
[21:13] thing it look like a time of history but
[21:16] if we take that scripture he's the same
[21:19] yesterday today and forever it no longer
[21:21] becomes history it becomes
[21:27] now
[21:30] is that right I mean even in Jesus day
[21:33] he when he was walking the path who
[21:35] fought him
[21:37] most his own
[21:40] people the one who betrayed him
[21:43] Judas from the tribe of
[21:46] Judah the same tribe Jesus came from I
[21:50] mean you know when you see this you got
[21:51] to understand and bring it down to your
[21:53] level your greatest enemy will be among
[21:57] you it ain't to be out there it's going
[22:00] to be among you and you've got to know
[22:04] who you are and where you came from and
[22:09] where you're going that's where your
[22:11] peace is right I have a peace God has
[22:15] given me a peace I'm not worried I'm not
[22:19] afraid I'm not nervous about
[22:23] nothing because God has given me a peace
[22:25] and that same peace I'm sure some of you
[22:27] already have those of you who don't ask
[22:29] God for that
[22:31] peace so you can't be worried this is
[22:33] not oh Lord I'm just don't know what's
[22:35] going to happen tomorrow yes we
[22:38] do but we must prepare ourselves for
[22:42] it right it's the truth you know I I'll
[22:47] say it like this a lot of places you
[22:49] know in in Iowa has these uh uh
[22:54] Sheltering places you can go when a
[22:55] tornado come and um some don't but those
[23:00] of you who have those kind of little
[23:02] shelters underneath or whatever basement
[23:04] you're not going to just stand at the
[23:06] top of your stairs because and you see
[23:08] the tornado coming you say oh well I'm
[23:10] going to be all right no you're going to
[23:13] go down to a place of safety and that's
[23:16] how it is now you see the storm coming
[23:19] find your place of
[23:21] safety right I know this is uh uh uh a
[23:26] little
[23:27] different but we know that uh he was
[23:31] surrounded by all enemies and I got in
[23:35] my notes it sounds like the borders of
[23:37] America being
[23:39] invaded by the surrounding countries and
[23:43] that's exactly right but we can't be
[23:46] afraid of
[23:47] anything perfect love cast out fear he
[23:51] said they will fight against you and you
[23:53] know I know I'm if you don't know I'm
[23:56] telling you now the Christian has be
[23:58] become the target we are the enemy now
[24:01] when this country was based upon
[24:03] Christianity now we we are the enemy uh
[24:07] of this country because this country has
[24:10] sold out to all kinds of idolatry you
[24:13] know socialism communism You Name It
[24:16] Whatever Pagan thing can go on in this
[24:19] country they they allow it and it's okay
[24:22] except there's no room for the
[24:24] Christian and that's what Jesus said if
[24:27] they did it in the green they do it in
[24:28] the dry so understand you and you're not
[24:32] the only place of safety is Jesus Christ
[24:35] and he's already given you words of
[24:40] confidence I knew
[24:42] you do you all believe that he knew us
[24:46] he know us and he knew us before the
[24:48] foundation of the world we're not
[24:50] something that just happened now we'll
[24:52] use that scripture yeah Lord you know
[24:55] we're preacher preaching oh yeah God
[24:57] knew me before the foundation of the
[24:59] world now you really know to you need to
[25:01] know that he knew
[25:02] you is there any
[25:05] questions any
[25:08] questions
[25:13] yes thank you uh not really a question I
[25:16] do have but just uh just you finish com
[25:20] verse five which says that before I
[25:22] formed the uh in the belly I knew you
[25:26] just like to say uh I was first of all I
[25:28] want to I want to thank you because I
[25:30] was reading Jeremiah it was just like a
[25:31] new book to me again you know a lot of
[25:34] things coming out and um just like you
[25:37] say looking at the state of the country
[25:39] right now reading the chapter five kind
[25:43] of um it kind of uh came came into my
[25:48] mind about what's going on even in the
[25:50] country nowadays um in the Supreme Court
[25:53] you know talking about with productive
[25:54] right you know a woman can do whatever
[25:57] they want attacking life you know but
[26:00] when I read this something pretty much
[26:03] told me God God knew me before that's
[26:05] election before even I was formed you
[26:08] know what I mean so and the country
[26:11] today is just pretty much going against
[26:12] the scripture saying that no you know we
[26:16] don't need God to legis legislate people
[26:19] to legislate anything you know what I
[26:22] mean and be playing you can be talk
[26:23] about the birth and everything yeah yes
[26:25] exactly and because it's pretty much
[26:27] taught now in schools to even our young
[26:30] sisters that it's your body you know you
[26:33] do whatever you want you know if you
[26:34] don't feel like you you have to give
[26:36] birth you can terminate life any any
[26:39] time so it's really crucial for us as
[26:43] Christians to know that life is precious
[26:45] because God ordains it before even you
[26:49] know it is formed so that's just
[26:51] something that came in my mind well and
[26:53] it's true brother and it's true the fact
[26:56] of the matter is in our country you'll
[26:58] have people who would want to kill you
[27:01] for standing for the word this
[27:04] particular
[27:05] scripture because they think that life
[27:08] they really don't think much about life
[27:10] because they murderers you know their
[27:12] father is a murderer so they can't help
[27:14] but to be murderous I mean you can you
[27:16] can kill a child all the way up to
[27:18] almost the ninth month and in some
[27:20] places even after they're born when
[27:22] they're born you know how they do they
[27:23] suck the brain out of them you know just
[27:26] really cruel stuff it's nothing but bail
[27:28] worship it's witchcraft behind all of
[27:31] that and and and they they bewitch young
[27:34] girls innocently and tell them it's okay
[27:37] but then when those girls do it they
[27:38] realize it's not okay but then it's too
[27:40] late you see but the truth of the matter
[27:44] is that what devil is trying to do is
[27:46] stop the Royal seed when you see him
[27:49] killing babies he's trying to stop the
[27:51] Royal
[27:53] seed that's scripture every time he he
[27:56] he tried to kill the babies and Egypt
[27:59] you know uh kill the babies in Bethlehem
[28:01] it was always the Royal seity he was
[28:03] behind because you see if he could stop
[28:06] that then we can't have a Rapture
[28:08] because God said I have never Lo lost
[28:10] one you see what I'm saying so God God
[28:14] knows how to hide his his own he knows
[28:17] how to maneuver things around regardless
[28:20] to what they do they of course they're
[28:22] going to have to give account for what
[28:24] they're doing we we we look we look the
[28:26] scriptures and we see well you know uh
[28:29] the Jews worshiped and Moab and and um
[28:33] excuse me uh uh MOA I can't think of the
[28:38] god the the the name the the Moab bites
[28:41] worship and they were they were they
[28:43] were
[28:45] um uh sacrific children and that's
[28:49] exactly what we're doing it's just a new
[28:51] form of what we doing it but it's still
[28:53] if you see those that do it uh in the
[28:57] because there are Cults and religious
[28:59] people in high places that literally
[29:02] sacrifice children that way and
[29:05] worse so we haven't we say uh
[29:09] intelligently we we've moved forward but
[29:11] we haven't we've gone backwards this
[29:14] nation is
[29:15] backsliding and it's worse than it's
[29:17] ever been and it's come to a place where
[29:20] God has to bring judgment upon
[29:22] it yeah yes brother
[29:27] as I understand it I mean
[29:31] we uh us as a
[29:34] bride it we're carrying on brother
[29:37] Brandon's Ministry yes even though you
[29:40] know we're the bride and we are carrying
[29:42] that on and brother Brandon's Ministry
[29:45] was the word amen that's all he was
[29:49] bringing out was the truth of the word
[29:52] amen and um
[29:56] so what I'm saying he Jeremiah was sent
[30:00] to quote unquote religious people yes
[30:03] they were still going through the forms
[30:06] yes but they just weren't they were not
[30:09] following God that's right
[30:11] so um what I'm trying to say is you're
[30:14] absolutely right that what I've
[30:17] experienced and I'm sure many here you
[30:20] get more opposition from people who know
[30:24] some of the word yes sir than you do
[30:27] that people who don't know anything
[30:29] about the world exactly right and so we
[30:32] are in the sense of Jeremiah yes sir you
[30:34] know yes sir that's what it seems like
[30:37] to mean to me too brother it really is
[30:39] it puts you you become the character of
[30:42] that day you know we put Jeremiah here
[30:44] but really we are what he was you know
[30:49] we are the ones who are now fighting
[30:51] against the wickedness of Israel
[30:55] spiritually right because we have fought
[30:58] fall we have backslidden so much and and
[31:01] if you can't put yourself in this book
[31:02] if you can't become the character of the
[31:04] book you see what I'm saying we can say
[31:06] oh we Rebecca you know we're Rachel
[31:09] we're this that and the other but you
[31:10] got to understand you all the others too
[31:12] I mean those characters that God has in
[31:15] his book is for you because you supposed
[31:17] to be the whole
[31:19] book and you supposed to be able to find
[31:22] yourself in this scripture if you was in
[31:23] the day of Jeremiah who would you
[31:26] be
[31:29] right if you can't honestly say I'll be
[31:31] Jeremiah then then that means you're on
[31:34] the other side of the
[31:37] fence I mean come on even in the days of
[31:40] Jesus who would you have
[31:42] been what are those disciples Jesus or
[31:46] Judas you understand what I'm saying you
[31:48] got to put yourself in the book because
[31:51] the book is about you it is about
[31:55] us and everything that J jiah had to
[31:58] stand against is what the Bride of Jesus
[32:01] Christ is standing against right
[32:04] now and who is our enemy who the people
[32:07] hates us those so-called
[32:10] Christians that's the truth they can't
[32:14] stand it because you can live it and
[32:16] they can't and there's always been a
[32:19] jealousy between the
[32:21] two right
[32:24] always but don't be afraid of their
[32:26] faces always tell them the truth no
[32:30] matter what because God Is Standing On
[32:33] Your Side remember jeremi made it
[32:36] through all of the others made it
[32:37] through now does it mean that they
[32:39] didn't suffer no they suffered if you're
[32:42] going to be a real Christian you're
[32:43] going to suffer but Jesus said if you
[32:45] don't suffer you don't rain and if
[32:47] you're going to suffer suffer for
[32:48] righteousness sake not because you
[32:51] stealing or smoking or drinking or
[32:52] something like that suffer for the
[32:54] righteousness of
[32:56] God
[33:00] right God is so good to
[33:03] us I um I had
[33:06] uh oh here it is here it is um let's
[33:10] turn to Isaiah Isaiah
[33:13] 1 Isaiah
[33:15] 1 like I said I don't I don't have my
[33:18] Bible with me so I thought I I quoted it
[33:20] out but I don't have it but I'll tell
[33:24] you in Isaiah 1 it talks about the
[33:26] vision of Amos
[33:28] um and and in Amos you know uh we
[33:32] understand God raised him up as a
[33:36] prophet and we know by God's grace that
[33:39] when when
[33:42] um the scriptures is is is is being
[33:46] unfold uh to a prophet
[33:50] usually I've not seen where God has said
[33:53] great things but one thing he did say
[33:55] and I'm I'm going to jump here and I'll
[33:57] come back to this later but he told
[33:59] Jeremiah he said he said I know and I've
[34:01] given you I've given you an expected end
[34:05] and so you and I must understand that
[34:07] God God in the the righteous of God we
[34:11] have a a end and is not the wrath of God
[34:14] is actually an expected in and though we
[34:18] be uh few in number God God always work
[34:22] in that that that small group of people
[34:25] Isaiah uh 1
[34:28] um can I get you to read it um uh
[34:31] brother Frank
[34:38] please yes sir down to the seventh and I
[34:42] want everybody to pay attention to what
[34:44] being
[34:46] said okay the vision of Isaiah the son
[34:49] of Amos which he saw concerning Judah
[34:53] and Jerusalem in the days of
[34:55] oziah J
[34:59] aaz and ezekiah kings of Judah here all
[35:03] heavens and give ear o Earth for the
[35:07] Lord hath spoken I have nourished and
[35:11] brought up children and they
[35:14] have rebeled against me the O knowth his
[35:18] owner and the as his master's creb but
[35:22] Israel does not know my people does not
[35:26] consider
[35:28] sinful Nation hold that just there cuz
[35:30] that that's one of the scriptures I
[35:32] that's really want he said what the ARX
[35:34] know the master
[35:36] and it's amazing because if you look
[35:39] through nature all nature know who God
[35:42] is they know their maker and they listen
[35:45] to his voice but you take a man as I had
[35:49] somebody say the other day out of all
[35:51] the animals we're the most
[35:54] wicked we're the most wicked we do more
[35:56] D damage
[35:58] to the to the Earth and everything else
[36:01] all other animals they they work with
[36:03] nature when we work against nature yet
[36:07] we supposed to be the brilliant ones and
[36:10] and it's a sad situation when we come to
[36:12] a place where uh uh uh the Bible got to
[36:15] tell you that the the what we call dumb
[36:18] animals got better sense more sense in
[36:22] the
[36:24] man they know their creator they know
[36:27] their maker and we have no idea who he
[36:30] is go ahead sir verse four I sinful
[36:35] Nation or people Laden with iniquity a
[36:39] seed of
[36:40] evildoers children that are corruptors
[36:44] they have forsaken the Lord they have
[36:47] provoked the Holy One of Israel unto
[36:50] anger they are gone gone away
[36:53] backward five why should he be shuen
[36:56] anymore ye will Revolt more and more the
[37:00] whole head is sick and the whole heart
[37:03] faints from the soul of the food even
[37:06] unto the head there is no soundness in
[37:09] it but wounds and bruises and petrifying
[37:14] sores they have not been closed neither
[37:17] bound up neither MiFi with one windman
[37:22] seven your country is desolate your
[37:24] cities are burned with fire your land
[37:27] Strang Str devour devour it in your
[37:30] presence and it is desolate as overthrow
[37:33] by
[37:34] strangers you
[37:36] see you see what's happening that that
[37:38] that scripture though it be in Isaiah is
[37:42] actually you could see your our day I
[37:45] mean we got all these foreigners all
[37:46] these people coming in and and you know
[37:50] if when it was being done right that was
[37:51] okay but what I'm trying to say is now
[37:53] we are totally being
[37:56] invaded
[37:58] I mean we got
[38:00] Isis all kind of you know Muslim fa
[38:03] factions and you know we got the Chinese
[38:06] coming in and they are sending all their
[38:08] army forces on feet I mean it just it it
[38:11] amazes me that that people are not
[38:14] Awakening they're not wake they they
[38:16] don't know and then we've got these
[38:19] churches coming together
[38:22] believing that everything can be
[38:25] saved nothing can be saved
[38:28] we're now ready for the burning the only
[38:30] thing that can be saved is the Bride of
[38:32] Jesus Christ no organization can save
[38:35] you no president can save you no Pope
[38:38] can save you the only person that can
[38:40] save you is Jesus Christ
[38:42] himself right and this is what Nehemiah
[38:45] was I mean Jeremiah was saying turn back
[38:48] to
[38:50] God and even though he was opposed by
[38:55] other prophets is still did not stop
[38:59] what the the prophecy of Jeremiah uh
[39:02] from coming to pass matter of fact every
[39:05] Prophet that stood against uh Jeremiah
[39:08] was killed and destroyed whether it be a
[39:11] king a king's Sons whoever it was they
[39:15] were killed by Babylon and this is what
[39:17] I tell people I said I don't care what
[39:20] kind of system they're
[39:24] building at the end of the day
[39:27] Daniel say I saw a
[39:29] stone heun out of the
[39:32] mountain rolling down to
[39:35] Babylon and that same Stone who is Jesus
[39:38] Christ destroyed the image and you and I
[39:42] must understand in order for us to make
[39:44] it we must Al also uh keep our hearts
[39:49] our minds sted on the Lord Jesus read
[39:52] read Jeremiah and read it uh spiritually
[39:56] say the Lord show
[39:58] me where I stand and what I should be
[40:01] doing in this day because what I've been
[40:04] asking the Lord I said I don't know if
[40:05] there be any to be saved but if there
[40:08] are somewhere some show me and give me
[40:12] the Zeal to talk to them cuz people it's
[40:15] like you know you got the life raft and
[40:19] the Titanic is going down and you
[40:21] holding the life life raft not willing
[40:23] to give it to no one else and that's not
[40:26] right
[40:28] if you truly believe this message know
[40:31] that we're right at the end like how
[40:33] long nobody knows but I tell you what
[40:36] it's closer now than it's ever
[40:38] been you know and I want tell you
[40:41] something the the the oncoming election
[40:43] if we have one we'll be an eye opener to
[40:46] a lot of
[40:48] Christians and uh brother brother rich I

[41:01] yeah yes sir that was a powerful
[41:04] scripture that he shared with me today
[41:06] and I think we we'll end the lessons
[41:07] with that because listen if if we don't
[41:10] get a chance if we don't start
[41:13] praying God can't help you if you don't
[41:15] pray you got to
[41:18] pray you got to ask God to help you to
[41:21] escape this
[41:23] thing I'll read it yeah
[41:26] yeah
[41:35] it's uh it's actually in St St Luke the
[41:38] 21st
[41:45] chapter I'm I'm going to read I'm going
[41:47] to I'm going to read uh the 33rd verse
[41:49] and come on
[41:54] down 32nd verse that's even better said
[41:57] verily I say unto you this generation
[42:00] shall not pass away till all be
[42:04] fulfilled Heaven and Earth shall pass
[42:07] away but my words shall not pass
[42:11] away and take heed to yourself This is
[42:14] what where we're coming at take heed to
[42:17] yourself lest at any time your heart be
[42:21] overcharged with safiy and
[42:25] drunkenness and care of this life and so
[42:29] that they come upon you
[42:32] unawares for as a snare shall it come on
[42:36] all them that dwell on the face of the
[42:39] whole earth watch ye
[42:42] therefore and pray always pray always
[42:47] for what that ye may be counted wory to
[42:52] escape all these things and shall not
[42:55] come to pass that that shall come to
[42:58] pass and to stand before the son of man
[43:02] now he said pray pray that God will
[43:06] count you worthy see if you don't pray
[43:10] God can't count you worthy you got to
[43:13] pray that God will account you worthy to
[43:17] escape all these things that should come
[43:19] to pass and to stand before the son of
[43:22] man if you don't pray that God will
[43:24] account you worthy you may not make it
[43:27] CU prayer is the
[43:29] key prayer is the
[43:32] key prayer is the
[43:35] key if my people they wish I called by
[43:37] my name would humble themselves and
[43:39] pray and seek my face and turn from
[43:42] their wicked ways he said I will hear
[43:44] from heaven and heal the land and I'm
[43:47] telling you that's where the devil
[43:48] fights us the most prayer but I don't
[43:52] care if it ain't nothing but help me
[43:55] Jesus that's all you know give it to him
[43:58] cuz God knows the
[44:00] heart right it it's it's it's really you
[44:04] know you you look at this thing and I'm
[44:05] like I just can't hardly wait till I get
[44:07] till we get into some other stuff with
[44:09] this because the de the enemy I can't
[44:12] find my Bible I'll find it it's
[44:14] somewhere but my my point is
[44:17] this uh I trust something was said
[44:20] tonight this is like I said just the
[44:22] opening of what God had Jeremiah to do
[44:27] and understand his battles was hard and
[44:31] every time he thought he could trust uh
[44:34] something would always fold and go back
[44:37] just the other way so at the end of the
[44:40] day it was like Jeremiah and his scribe
[44:42] almost that's all he had practically but
[44:45] one thing for certain you think about it
[44:48] and I I'm jumping but I'll say it like
[44:50] this here Jeremiah and I think B I might
[44:53] be pronouncing that wrong but anyway he
[44:57] help Jeremiah write the Scribe write
[44:59] there there's all of his testimonies and
[45:01] and and the word and then um one man
[45:05] heard about it and I think it was the
[45:07] king or whoever it was and we'll read
[45:09] that next time we come but but but he
[45:11] destroyed it can you imagine they didn't
[45:14] have internet they didn't have
[45:15] typewriters they had the
[45:18] rights and if you know the way the Jews
[45:21] their letters and all that that wasn't
[45:23] easy and for somebody to come and just
[45:26] destroy it and then you got God says no
[45:29] do it over again so what I'm trying to
[45:32] tell you is this you got to learn how to
[45:36] expect the unexpected in your
[45:39] life but don't give
[45:41] up you don't give
[45:44] up you got to know who you are when you
[45:46] know who you are you don't give
[45:48] up I saw something on the other day and
[45:52] uh it was on one of my little news clips
[45:54] and I'm going to let you go but they
[45:56] said first first time they had ever
[45:58] witnessed four Eagles sharing the same
[46:04] nest they've never seen that
[46:07] before for his Deliverance you think God
[46:10] just put that together just for them to
[46:12] see it's a
[46:14] Unity it's a coming
[46:18] together y'all understand me that's not
[46:21] even a part of their nature like that
[46:25] sharing the nest and all different ones
[46:27] say have a corner to to to to bring
[46:29] their eggs forth It's not heard of but
[46:33] that's what they saw saw and I seen it
[46:35] on the video it's amazing and I thought
[46:38] to myself the natural types is spiritual
[46:41] if we as Eagles could come together and
[46:44] really share everything that we have
[46:46] without some kind of law or rule helping
[46:49] one another being in unity in such a way
[46:52] Satan will be automatically
[46:55] defeated because Jesus said excuse me
[46:58] brother bam said if I had any gift he
[47:00] said I'd rather have perfect love than
[47:03] any gift there is because one thing
[47:05] about perfect
[47:07] love it can't be
[47:09] defeated love conquers
