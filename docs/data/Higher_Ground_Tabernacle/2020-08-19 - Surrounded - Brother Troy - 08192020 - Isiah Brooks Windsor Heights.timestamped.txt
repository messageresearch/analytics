[36:18] let's uh open our bibles to the book of
[36:20] matthew chapter 13.
[36:24] and uh i want to speak a message called
[36:26] surrounded
[36:31] that's matthew chapter 13. we'll start
[36:34] at the
[36:36] 24th verse
[36:46] and we'll go ahead and read on through
[36:48] this entire parable down to the 30th
[36:49] verse there
[36:52] and it says that's matthew 13 24 and
[36:55] another parable put he forth unto them
[36:57] saying
[36:58] the kingdom of heaven is likened unto a
[37:01] man which
[37:02] sowed good seed in his field but while
[37:05] men slept his enemy came and sowed
[37:09] tares among the wheat and went upon his
[37:11] way
[37:13] and but when the blade was sprung up and
[37:16] brought forth fruit
[37:18] then appeared the tares also
[37:21] so the servants of the householder came
[37:23] and said unto him
[37:24] sir did thou not sow good seed in thy
[37:27] field
[37:28] from whence then hath it tares
[37:31] and he said unto them an enemy hath done
[37:34] this
[37:37] and the snake the servant said to them
[37:39] wilt thou that we should go and gather
[37:41] them up
[37:42] he said nay lest while ye gather them up
[37:45] the tares you
[37:46] root up also the wheat with them and so
[37:49] he says there in verse 30
[37:51] let them both grow together until the
[37:54] harvest
[37:55] and in the time of the harvest i will
[37:57] say unto the reapers
[38:00] gather ye together first the tares
[38:04] and bind them in bundles to burn them
[38:07] but gather the wheat into my barn
[38:10] amen let's just bow our heads in a word
[38:12] of prayer
[38:14] heavenly father we just approach unto
[38:16] your your precious word this evening
[38:19] father
[38:20] with all honor and reverence lord that's
[38:22] due unto it lord
[38:24] knowing lord that we are unworthy father
[38:27] to even open up this book lord unworthy
[38:30] even to approach unto it father but lord
[38:32] the thou
[38:32] has collected us out of the people of
[38:34] this earth lord you have made us worthy
[38:36] father
[38:37] you've washed us in your blood father
[38:39] you've sanctified us lord
[38:41] lord you've made us clean you've put up
[38:43] us upon your
[38:45] uh your throne father and lord we
[38:47] couldn't have done this by ourselves
[38:48] lord but it's you that has chose us
[38:50] father
[38:51] it's you that has revealed yourself to
[38:53] us lord
[38:54] and we do not take that choice lightly
[38:56] father but lord in the midst of this
[38:58] choice father we
[39:00] we rise up say and say and recognize the
[39:02] choice and say lord
[39:03] hear am i lord send me to the nations
[39:06] lord
[39:06] hear my lord let me be that the one that
[39:09] you
[39:10] that you have chosen to glorify in this
[39:12] day
[39:13] and lord we just want to thank you for
[39:15] these things lord we pray that tonight
[39:17] lord you'd
[39:18] open up your word in that way that only
[39:20] you can do it lord like you did on the
[39:22] road to emmaus father
[39:23] there's only one person that can do it
[39:25] and that's the person of the lord jesus
[39:27] christ
[39:28] so we come to you lord open your word to
[39:30] our hearts into our
[39:31] eyes and our ears this morning lord as
[39:33] we
[39:34] look upon your word in the name of the
[39:36] lord jesus christ we pray
[39:38] amen amen god bless you you can be
[39:41] seated
[39:45] surrounded the title
[39:49] so i consider this
[39:53] i was thinking about the
[39:57] story about elisha
[40:00] when he was went over to a certain place
[40:03] and
[40:04] and woke up in the morning and and they
[40:08] realized that they were surrounded by
[40:09] the enemy the syrians
[40:11] and his servants said woe unto us you
[40:14] know
[40:15] there's we are surrounded we're going to
[40:19] perish
[40:20] and elisha was not moved
[40:23] by the report he was not afraid
[40:27] at the words of his servant but as he
[40:30] considered
[40:31] what the servant said and he considered
[40:34] what his eyes said
[40:36] then he looked back and considered the
[40:38] revelation of jehovah
[40:40] and considered what the revelation said
[40:43] and the revelation
[40:44] said lord there is greater as he is with
[40:49] us
[40:50] than he that is in the world amen and he
[40:53] said to he's just prayed a real quick
[40:55] prayer he said lord
[40:57] open up gehey's eyes show this young man
[41:01] that there is more that is with us than
[41:04] there is with the enemy
[41:06] and as gaheza was looking around and
[41:08] seeing all the syrians
[41:10] all of a sudden his eyesight began to
[41:11] change and all sudden he began to see
[41:14] little flickers of light over here and
[41:17] flickers of light over there and all of
[41:18] a sudden
[41:19] these flaming wheels and chariots begin
[41:22] to appear in the sky and
[41:23] and all of a sudden his his field of
[41:25] vision was completely changed
[41:27] and he saw a revelation his his entire
[41:31] mindset was changed in an instant where
[41:33] he saw
[41:34] that there was chariots of fire and
[41:36] horsemen
[41:37] of fire surrounding all around about
[41:39] them so at this
[41:41] one move by the assyrians we met by this
[41:44] heavenly army all fear left
[41:49] all wonderings all doubts amen though
[41:52] they were surrounded by the enemy but it
[41:54] was greater as
[41:55] is is the ones that were as greater as
[41:58] he that was with him greater is he that
[42:00] loved them
[42:02] amen than those that hated them and
[42:04] that's kind of what i want to focus on
[42:06] tonight is
[42:07] greater is he that loved us
[42:10] than those that hate us amen always
[42:13] remember that greater is he that has
[42:16] that has told us about his tender
[42:17] mercies greater is he that has revealed
[42:21] his loving kindness to us
[42:22] greater is he that said i will always be
[42:25] with you
[42:26] greater is he that says i will be with
[42:27] you even unto the end of the age greater
[42:30] is that one
[42:31] than the things that surround us so even
[42:34] like
[42:35] as we said there in the parable jesus
[42:37] even told us you will be surrounded
[42:40] amen as i put the good seed in the field
[42:43] that good seed will be surrounded by the
[42:46] tariffs
[42:47] i have seen it from far off
[42:51] i saw it before the foundation of the
[42:53] world amen and i saw
[42:55] the enemy come in i know that the enemy
[42:58] sowed his tares
[42:59] i know that they are there amen and i
[43:02] have
[43:02] i have declared in my wisdom that they
[43:04] will not be rooted up till the end
[43:06] amen but he says i will send the binding
[43:10] time
[43:11] amen and i'll bind the tares first
[43:15] amen so as we as we look upon the
[43:17] newspapers
[43:19] as we consider those that hate us amen
[43:22] as we consider the ones that that that
[43:25] would rise up against us
[43:27] i mean you know every every good crisis
[43:31] is a time for those that are in power
[43:34] to act out against those that they hate
[43:38] you know like we've heard the the the
[43:40] phrase never let a good
[43:41] crisis go uh to waste you know
[43:44] and and and and these crises will come
[43:48] like birth pains
[43:49] it's been prophesied beforehand there
[43:52] will be an ebb and a flow but each ebb
[43:54] gets stronger and stronger each flow
[43:56] gets stronger and stronger
[43:58] you know and we know that these times
[43:59] will come and we know
[44:01] these times will go and they know that
[44:03] the time will get shorter
[44:05] and shorter and shorter and as these
[44:08] things get worse and worse as they get
[44:11] bound up
[44:12] closer they will get stronger amen
[44:15] but greater is he that is with us than
[44:18] he that is in the world
[44:21] and even though we may seem at times to
[44:23] be surrounded
[44:24] uh you know even as the the in the
[44:27] parable you know the the messenger came
[44:29] to the
[44:29] to the ma the master of the field and
[44:31] said sir look what has happened to your
[44:33] field
[44:34] there's fruits that are not what you
[44:37] planted
[44:37] and and the householder says an enemy
[44:40] has done this
[44:42] he identified the enemy but he says i
[44:45] know who the enemy is
[44:47] and i know who my children are and let
[44:49] me know god
[44:50] knows who you are amen god can look into
[44:53] his field and he can identify you
[44:55] god can look out over the human race and
[44:58] he knows who you
[44:58] are he knows where his seed is he knows
[45:02] he knows remember when uh uh uh when
[45:05] elijah said
[45:07] uh i i am all alone you know i'm all
[45:10] alone in the land there is no one else
[45:12] left
[45:13] and jehovah answered back right away and
[45:15] says i have
[45:16] seven thousand that i have kept to
[45:18] myself
[45:19] that have not bowed their knee into baal
[45:22] i have seven
[45:23] thousand that have not worshipped baal
[45:25] they've not worshiped the denominations
[45:27] they've always had that thing in their
[45:29] mind where they just couldn't go
[45:30] there they just couldn't go to that
[45:32] place amen i've reserved them unto
[45:35] myself
[45:36] and god knows where those seven thousand
[45:38] are amen god knows with that seventh
[45:40] church age
[45:41] that comes out of laodicea amen that is
[45:44] set free from laodicea god knows where
[45:47] they are at
[45:48] amen an enemy has done this but greater
[45:51] is he that is in me
[45:53] than he that is in the world
[45:56] the enemy has come with a goal in his
[45:59] mind
[46:00] amen you know god has real enemies amen
[46:04] they're they're not they're not just a
[46:05] play thing
[46:06] these are real enemies amen they're uh
[46:10] they're they're they're they're not to
[46:12] be just discounted
[46:13] you know there's real consequences to
[46:15] his enemies he has real powers
[46:18] but there is no power that is greater
[46:20] than our god's power
[46:21] amen and this enemy has a goal
[46:25] to exalt and to lift up his kingdom
[46:27] above god's kingdom
[46:29] to lift up his word above god's word to
[46:32] lift up his power of
[46:33] above god's power he has a to lift up
[46:36] his revelation above god's revelation
[46:39] to bring the people into a fear

[54:00] there was a friend that surrounded me
[54:02] with a greater surrounding
[54:04] amen amen
[54:10] amen is the same yesterday today and
[54:14] forever
[54:18] i remember the story i don't i'm not
[54:21] going to turn to it but from the book of
[54:22] judges
[54:24] there was a time when i think it was
[54:26] manasseh
[54:27] he went up to joshua
[54:31] he began to complain
[54:34] he said joshua the inheritance that you
[54:37] gave
[54:38] me that you wrote out in your book by
[54:39] the inspiration of the holy ghost
[54:42] the the inheritance you gave me is too
[54:44] small
[54:45] i i just i'm cramped i can't live in
[54:49] this
[54:49] inheritance that you gave me and joshua
[54:52] kind of got a little puzzled look on his
[54:54] face and like let me get my book out
[54:56] and he opened up the book and he found
[54:58] out and he says well this is all the
[55:00] land the manassas should have
[55:01] he says it goes over here to this
[55:03] boundary and it it goes way over here to
[55:06] here and
[55:07] way up here to here and it goes all the
[55:09] way over to here have you
[55:10] have you taken over the land well yeah
[55:12] yeah well
[55:14] yeah i i well i've taken over the the
[55:16] the mountaintops i
[55:18] couldn't well i couldn't take over the
[55:19] valleys
[55:21] and and and then over here it's it's
[55:23] it's full of trees and we can't live
[55:25] there
[55:26] and so all i really have is just these
[55:28] little tiny mountain tops to live on and
[55:29] i can't live anywhere else
[55:31] and joshua says this is why i wrote the
[55:34] book
[55:35] amen this is why the promise has been
[55:37] written down
[55:38] go out there and conquer the enemy
[55:41] go out there and get your saws out cut
[55:43] down these trees
[55:44] and you'll have more than enough room in
[55:46] your inheritance
[55:48] amen so many times we live so far
[55:50] underneath our we go out to the holy
[55:52] spirit
[55:52] lord you get this is just such a hard
[55:54] life you know and we're
[55:56] we're we're being disobedient to the
[55:58] word over here and we're
[55:59] and we're the word says to do this and
[56:02] yet we do this and
[56:03] and as soon as as soon as a
[56:06] pastor preaches a sermon called
[56:08] obedience all of a sudden your mind
[56:10] starts thinking about all the little
[56:11] areas
[56:12] that you're being disobedient and
[56:14] disobedience over here
[56:16] you're not complying with the word over
[56:18] here and and if a certain
[56:20] pastor is the gap behind the pulpit says
[56:22] today we're going to preach on
[56:24] obedience to the word of god
[56:28] and all of a sudden your mind just
[56:29] starts to think oh lord i've been
[56:32] doing this i know lord i've
[56:35] your word says to do this but i've been
[56:37] doing this over here
[56:40] and i know i shouldn't do this but i've
[56:42] been doing this over here anyway
[56:44] and you wonder why am i not living in
[56:47] overcoming life
[56:49] when the whole bible said that the bride
[56:51] of christ
[56:52] will be without spot without wrinkle
[56:54] that she in the last days that she would
[56:56] be an overcomer
[56:58] that she would overcome the enemy in all
[57:00] things and you can go and complain
[57:02] lord why is my life so hard lord why do
[57:04] i have all this
[57:05] why do i have all this because you're
[57:07] not fighting the enemy that you are
[57:09] surrounded by
[57:10] you're surrounded by the enemy god knew
[57:13] you would be surrounded by the enemy
[57:14] but greater is he that is surrounding
[57:16] you with his loving kindness
[57:18] greater is he that is surrounding you
[57:20] with the power of prayer
[57:21] greater is he that is surrounding you
[57:23] with the power of the holy ghost
[57:25] amen amen he has surrounded you with a
[57:29] greater power than an enemy's power
[57:32] amen satan goes like a roaring lion but
[57:34] in spite of all this
[57:36] god has prophesied that we've been given
[57:39] the blood of the lamb
[57:40] the holy spirit and prayer to overcome
[57:43] the enemy
[57:46] amen you remember the story of the
[57:50] parable of the mustard seed jesus said
[57:53] the
[57:54] kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed
[57:57] when it is
[57:58] sown into the earth is smaller
[58:01] than all the seeds of the field but when
[58:04] it is grown it becomes greater than
[58:06] everything
[58:09] and so is it to be in you the kingdom of
[58:11] heaven has been sown in your life
[58:13] by the preaching of the gospel by the
[58:15] preaching of this word

[58:19] word of god and the kingdom of god is
[58:21] being preached to you

[58:48] life amen it'll become greater and
[58:50] greater and greater

[59:32] given you over the enemy

[1:00:54] of the son of god amen with this
[1:00:57] temptation once again
[1:00:59] for when jesus was tempted he got out

[1:02:52] the country that they're in but they're
[1:02:54] surrounded by the protection of the
[1:02:55] united states
[1:02:57] amen and so are we we're we are
[1:02:59] surrounded by the protection of the word
[1:03:01] of god

[1:03:07] amen if you could give advice to that
[1:03:10] tribe of manasseh

[1:03:37] amen
[1:03:40] amen let's turn over to uh psalms
[1:03:43] chapter
[1:03:44] 17.
[1:03:52] peter said think it not strange when
[1:03:55] feary temptations surround you when
[1:03:58] trials
[1:03:59] try to take you over
[1:04:06] psalms chapter 17
[1:04:10] the sixth verse
[1:04:13] here is david i can just
[1:04:18] you know david is a man that he knew who
[1:04:21] his god was
[1:04:23] he had had so many experiences with
[1:04:25] jehovah
[1:04:26] that he knew what jehovah was capable of
[1:04:29] he knew that where his prayers went when
[1:04:31] he prayed
[1:04:33] amen david knew that when he prayed he
[1:04:36] knew exactly where his prayer would go
[1:04:38] and he knew what god was going to do
[1:04:40] with his prayer amen amen
[1:04:43] and so when you get down to the psalm 17
[1:04:47] verse 6 he says david is
[1:04:50] praying there he says i have called upon
[1:04:52] thee
[1:04:54] for thou will hear o god i like that
[1:04:58] amen he knew that god would hear him
[1:05:01] amen incline thine ear unto me and hear
[1:05:05] my speech
[1:05:07] show thy marvelous lovingkindness oh
[1:05:10] thou that
[1:05:10] save us by thy right hand them that
[1:05:13] would puts thy trust in thee
[1:05:15] from those that rise up against them
[1:05:18] keep me
[1:05:19] as the apple of the eye hide me under
[1:05:22] the shadow of thy wings
[1:05:24] uh he he knew who his god was he knew
[1:05:27] what his god was capable of
[1:05:29] and he was going to take what his god
[1:05:31] was capable of and assign that to
[1:05:33] himself

[1:24:05] christ and though
[1:24:07] satan the enemy comes and he says this
[1:24:09] he does this
[1:24:10] yet there they stand even as i bind the
