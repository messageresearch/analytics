trust that God will bless you in the service this morning for this evening rather second Thessalonians 2 glad to have those saints of God from Iowa City up 2nd Thessalonians 2 and we'll read the 7th through 12th verse amen God is so good to us reading from the second chapter at the seventh verse for the mystery of iniquity doth already work only he who now letteth will let until he be taken out of the way and then shall the wicked be revealed from the Lord shall consume for the law whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming for even him whose coming is after the work of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them with that perish because they received not the love of the truth that they might be saved and for this cause God shall send them strong delusion that they should believe alive that they all might be damned who believed not the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness let us pray father God we thank you for your grace we thank you for your mercy we thank you for being so good to us father God we just pray that you will have dying own way let your whole spirit move Oh God break and destroy the yolks of the enemy father I pray that you will take the minds of your people and may they focus Oh God on the word tonight and Lord may we leave our thoughts and ideas on the outside God we surrender to you tonight have thine own way in Jesus Christ's name we pray we need your Lord amen you may be seated our prese Lord we still working with spirit and truth but I'd like to kind of encourage you tonight to keep on loving the truth as I said this morning how that God provided away one of the things because of time we left off on but God never leaves himself without a witness one of the young brothers that came this morning asked a question he says why do we have all these religions did God create create all that that was Jared I thought oh that's good yeah I said no sir I said all of these things that we see now is has been placed there to brought the truth I said all of these religions and things that we are now seeing is caused by the devil people who are religious and while the young lady was there I said even science has become a religion and people are believing more in science than they do the Word of God they would rather believe that some alien came from another world and built the pyramids forgive you for laughing when I told him I said all of the truth that we need is right in the Bible so we've got a Bible study coming up I've been working on him by God's grace he said brother Brooks every time I hear you preach I get goosebumps I said that's the Holy Spirit and you see we realized that God is doing a great work somebody in all of this chaos still was true and yet we find those of us who have the truth treated as if it's nothing it would have been better if we'd had never heard this message then they hear this message and turn from it it would have been better if we remain a Pentecostal or Baptist then to come amen to this message and deny it you and I must realize amen that the truth will always remain the truth people said well the truth shall set you free no the truth shall make you free when we talk about truth we said like this morning there's only one way to worship God that's in spirit and in truth there's a time God the Bible said winked and our ignorance and God doesn't weak anymore because God has come at a time where he has unveiled himself in me and we saw we know now that when we guest in in all of the ages and we hoped in all of the ages that you know oh I hope I'm saved and I hope I make it and you know I hope I'm worshiping God right God has answered all of those questions he has given us a very remedy for everything that we need to make it but the Bible said broad is the way that leadeth to destruction and Strout Strait and narrow is the way that leadeth to eternal life and the Bible said only a few beads that find it so you got to understand that even amongst the message people who we are identify myself with Malachi 4 revelation seven and Luke you know we we we know 1730 we understand Amen that God and then sent a prophet and enough but but that's that's that's not enough and when I explained this to you I want you to understand brother Branham a man when he came he came to bring us truth he came to bring us their entrance or the way or to make it clear to us how to make a rapture is that right his ministry was to open up to our understanding or to enlighten us even how to make a rapture I was listening to questioning the answers and how he said how that when God got ready to he likin it our election as a woman who lays a pattern out on the floor and she's going to make a garment and how she takes that material she lays it out and then she cuts what material she wants to make the garment now the remnant of the material is just as good as a piece that he chose to make the garment but he says Amen that remnant was was our extra it was that material that he we call foolish virgins they made out of the same material but God has chosen them not to be bribed he said every Christian amen because you are Christian doesn't mean you're going to make the rapture hallelujah only those who have been elected and chosen from God will make a rapture is that truth so we don't have to wonder about whether we make a rapture amen I read the rapture in itself is a revelation personally to that individual you say what do you mean brother Brooks when that Rancher son came to that young lady who was in the backyard he meant throwing out the dishwater when nobody else knew who he was are real recognized for this way when he never approached anyone else to talk to her in the way that he talked to the lady young girl in in the backyard that girl had a personal revelation of the rancher son those girls in the any other other room dancing having a good time shouting speaking in tongues whatever they were doing they did not have that revelation that the rancher son was interested in them but this young lady not only knew but she talked with him he invited her or it gave her amen ah invitation to become his bride is that right it was a personal thing even though she was among all of the others she knew that that was a revelation and God had given her that revelation of who she was I meant no matter what the other girls said to her how they laughed at her how they are made mockery of her she knew the truth she understood that the rancher son will soon be my husband amen so when we look at this thing we must understand that this message is not religion this message a man is not a man for us to uplift uh-uh-uh-uh-uh how could I said put anything I'll put it in this message doesn't just belong to this church even though we are symbol here amen under the UH nun brother of the word of God for this day it it doesn't belong just to this church because there are many people in this church it meant that here the preaching every week and still haven't budged in their daily lives what is the issue because somewhere in their lives amen they haven't got a revelation of who they are and what they mean to God because when you realize that you are the Bride of Christ just like that young lady she began to make herself ready is that the problems well and then so when God that is truth and the truth make you free she she she didn't have no glorious clothes she had nothing that was different about what who she was she had one thing that the other girls didn't have and that was a promise hallelujah and when this message become a promise to you it transforms you I didn't say a hope I didn't say a hope it becomes a promise and God can never break his promise Oh hallelujah we know that the mystery of iniquity I was telling the church I said if they had only been down there Friday night for a brother D oka it would have transformed it would have done something if you left out of there and and left out of there the same way you came something's wrong amen what a masterpiece what a what and I would encourage you a man to go go line and take us on Facebook or whatever I don't know how you get to it but one of these brothers no but my point is you know he is he's preaching in English so those of us who are english-speaking you can understand but anyway it's really really really good lord I've never seen I've seen a lot of things but there was not one stone uncovered in other words there was no one in service that left out and say well you know he didn't get me everybody got licks it was just that good I love Corrections I love services with correction now even so you know even though correction like I said it ain't good for the flesh no flesh love it but what it what it what it produces after the correction is that right so I'm saying the truth that's what I heard I heard truth I heard truth in a way Amen that that it was so simple yet so powerful and he talking about victories victories in our lives is that right you and I know and I even took a quote from what he said what he was talking about a preaching on and I incorporated in my message today so you gotta understand here we're working with true we are the light of the world he meant about said we are a city that says on a hill that cannot be here oh my god and we cannot be a light amen and reflect anything outside of what he is because God is the light remember I got a quote here my brother Greg where brother I'm say you and I we reflect wherever our souls are wherever our spirit is whatever we're doing in the unseen it will reflect in the scene is that all right there i'ma use this quote quickly because you know the Lord quicken it to me he said we find a few years ago that all the modern dressings for the people that it all comes from perish which is which is a seed of Satan but now we find that we have come so polluted and so far more advanced in sin and to perish and French designers are coming to Hollywood to find how to dress the people in France he said what a disgrace devil took it from the picture show and put it right in your home uncensored programs on television all kinds of worldliness ISM and weak pulpits and pastors compromising with things of the world loving their position and a meal ticket more than they would to stand and tell the truth about God's Word and in that it brought the church into a chaos and it separated us and divided us and so much world that you Holly knows one from the other and our sermons are no more based upon the world unusually in a pool or modern pulpit it's about who's the next president of some lovely rose us roses or somewhere or some program that the church out early so that they can go see a certain program preached over 20 minutes and their excommunicate you now I know that's true cuz I was in an Apostolic Church and when they're what they call it now the seasonal football games came in on what they do it on Sundays now and you know they would let the church out early and sometimes some of the preachers wouldn't even come to church because they had to see the Superbowl that's it God have mercy on the people God the Superbowl and people would literally uh they might as well be out there under the television said watching the Superbowl Kerr their mind wasn't here in the preacher I could almost hear him hurry up preacher I mean the Superbowl gonna be on in about five minutes but that's the way people are and that's the way they do is that right now we look at people and I'm gonna tell you something my son said the other day somebody said oh he wears a cross and said oh you brave wearing that cross and I thought to myself but that cross it's just a symbol that cross don't mean nothing if you are not converted that cross means nothing hallelujah think about it I mean you think about all the symbolism that we simple things that we use is it meant to say we're in the message all those symbols only nothing hello-hello the Catholic Church got crosses hallelujah they got all kind of idols and everything before them but inside of all of that what are they yeah he what I'm saying you know a lot of times you know I remember one time my brother came into my church when I live in we lived in South Carolina it wasn't my church I went in the past at the time but he said to me when he after the service he said this doesn't look like a message Church I never forget over there the Holy Ghost struck me what what does the message Church look like please what a message church looks like like you right brother like you like you like you like that's what a message church is I miss church is not a building hallelujah oh who can who can be more religious than Israel and what's with Israel is dead you understand what I mean by that until Jesus Christ come in their lives they are just living legalistic Lee and and they're performing structurally until the Holy Ghost comes the truth of this message is not how much you got along you can wear your dresses or your hair the truth of this message gets the life that you live hallelujah cuz we see right now that there are people even in the message Amen they might wear long but they're so tight come on somebody but that's not truth it looks like it but it's not see you got to understand what truth is this is what I said this morning God weakened this thing to me let that will be done in earth as it is in heaven you're not going to find in heaven sexy holiness everything will be holy hallelujah and we find out they meant that that's what the inner the devil is saying wear your long dresses but where I'm so tight that every curve is seen hallelujah you can't do that and expect God to accept it that's not truth the brother brother once said every woman up there had on comments that were flowing see if the Holy Ghost got them looking and dressing like that up there he expect the Holy Ghost make us look and dress the same way there's no flash of skin revealing we sisters we hit that because brother em say that's how you can tell the condition of the church by the way the sisters dress see so I'm just saying that brothers two brothers have their ways you know but my point is the only thing that is going to change us listen John 4:17 says even the Spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knows him but you know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you my question this morning was who which of us know him which of you which of us see him I see him every day I see him my brothers I see him in my sisters I see him in me he awaits me every morning he causes me to pray I see him every day when he opens the word hello and it's true and then just like the brothers say this is the truth if you truly got Christ on me inside then Christ fees off of his word I heard what the Prophet God says when the Holy Ghost comes he comes to recharge you I like that word recharged to charge you up he said like a battery who is that okay so we look at this thing and I still I'm still looking and under trying to understand what a message church means people put pressure on people because because our church is not it's not set up like their church and then brother man said we're not an organization we're not a denomination you know and God taught me that you know when I was in the system when I was in an organization God took me there was a but the church I was firm is what it was called progressive Church of our Lord Jesus Christ but when they became incorporated it was progressive Church of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ incorporated and that incorporation and I looked at that thing I said oh my god what is this because he had added something and God says his church is not like McDonald's or Burger King that was God's Way of explaining to me I didn't know the message at the time but I knew that that moved that they made was wrong you understand me I knew that wasn't of God but then you come into the message churches we come into the message and you know we find the same thing that people would put pressure on you they look around to see if the clouds name they look around to see if brother Branham pitches name y'all understand me they look young y'all better understand what I'm saying because we it's a thin line you're not gonna understand what I'm sayin if you don't have the Holy Ghost you don't think I'm almost talking against the message which I'm not the message is Jesus Christ y'all understand me but I'm trying to say there's nothing wrong I love the picture brother ennum with the filler fire I love the cloud hallelujah but don't force me see oh that after a while you know people think well if I don't have a belt buckle and a cowboy hat and some cowboy boots cuz don't you dawg that's a cult around the message when you go to their church you got to have some cowboy boots and some bumbles and everything else you got to look like William Branham I'm sayin see what I'm trying to say people that's not where you emphasize it now you see what I'm saying we need a double portion of the spirit of Elijah and he lied you said unto Elijah if you see me go if you see me go and there's a lot of people who have not seen the Prophet go how many times I listen to tapes every day there's not a week that goes by I don't hear a message or two maybe it's three if it all depends on the length of it God is my witness I always listen my wife will tell you in the morning when I wake up boom when I'm in the restroom it's I'm listening you understand me why because there's something on the inside feeding it feeding off of it hallelujah and I look at this thing and I said Lord I said what is wrong I am my my whole desire is to look like him to walk like him to act like him to be like him hallelujah I don't need to be a replica my image is the Christ your image is supposed to be the Christ nobody else you understand me and I hear and I think what is truth jesus said except you believe that I am he you should likewise die in your sins is that the truth you got to know you say well well you know uh-uh-uh-uh-uh God was in brother Branham anybody can deny that if you do you probably got big problems hallelujah and we know like they said like that couldn t you say Nicodemus said well we know no man can do these things when brother Branham was on the scene there was no man no man could have done what he did in fact he said if I had the powder here I would heal you but I must wait on him he was here declaring that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever that is what truth is hallelujah and you and I must realized by the grace of God we are missed Jesus Christ hello we're not miss Ella le either we'll miss Jesus Christ we're not mrs. John we are miss Jesus Christ and we must bear the image in the name of our Lord and Savior I was there 54 said that he our Redeemer has also become our husband he is my husband right now I say these things not to not to deter or to change anything my thoughts is listen if we're going to worship in spirit you can't have truth and then not have the spirit because the equation is spirit and truth hallelujah you can't you can't say where I got the spirit and you don't have true because realize what we got and I've got I've seen people right now great men of God it meant who's got thousands of people in supposedly in this message now they are eight angels they have become the eighth angel they have become the message of the hour nonsense the greatest ministry that ever hit the earth was the ministry of Malachi for since since Jesus Christ y'all hear me and when brother Branham left off the scene he didn't leave us in a simpie space he introduced Jesus Christ himself am I making sense so my thing is this if we go to worship Him let us worship Him in truth understand for the truth of God so that when when we when when that time come we'll have no spot no blemish no wrinkle no nothing our love for God would be virtuous who think about it we looking at then when I say this let me get back to that thought there are so many people and that's why I say the mystery of iniquity does already work do you really think that God left this message to itself or the devil would leave this message to itself when he has already feel traded all of the denominations and he turned them against each other is that right I mean the so-called angel light is what the devil did he got into preachers who are not even the seed of God and they perverted the gospel is that the work that's where Jew said they were all day for that purpose so you got preachers or we look at denominations we can see that but we got preachers in the message that has been ordained to provide it that's why you got to read it you got to study it amen you can't leave this out either the Bible and those message books goes together like this New Testament it's a revelation of the Old Testament and the brother Brown of the booster spoken Lord wishes the revelation of the New Testament but it's not one against the other they all come together and you can't make a rapture without the revelation of the New Testament is that the truth I don't mean no harm I'm telling you the truth and because you're born again that's the thing I believe every one of us born again because something brought you here you said well I'm not perfect neither am i but when you're born again which when you accept the Lord Jesus Christ into your heart and you really believe it that's your conception God comes down and you justify not right amen but that's not all it you move on up to sanctification that same confession we start telling you take this off put this on take this off put this on don't look at this don't look at that you know it begins to sanctify you and it doesn't happen in a day hallelujah that's for true when sanctification was good enough it's not good enough anywhere no more you need the Holy Ghost you need to come to a place in your life where you say Lord not my will but thine be done when you get there God can work with you hallelujah and when you live righteousness the Bible tells us amen to live golly you will suffer persecution is that right let me tell you something even in this message if you put your mind and your heart to serve in the Lord with all of your heart even your same brothers your sisters would persecute you for being righteous and holy Oh daddy all that ain't necessary oh my that brother do Chi I tell you what I don't never get the urge to give a man a holy kiss but that day I did I wanted to kiss him on the jaw and I don't want him to punch me either but I felt so good coz he hit all those areas I had been thinking in my mind my we were talking about it going down as brother Frank some of the things that he was saying we were talking about going down there to Iowa City and I was thinking also you know people think you know they they they think pastors are stupid you know and I put this way how can I say it God tells us things and and there are things that we can't even say you know he hit on brothers drinking he hit on brothers looking at bad stuff hello he hit on all kinds of undercover sins and I knew they were there no you know but I can't say things are that I'm saying god I can't say things until you tell me to say things and after all my god this is God speaking because we look listen God had just said to me Ezekiel I want you to look through the wall I want to told you to see what Israel doing you know when God talks to a preacher like that he knows it's the nasty stuff going on I want you to look through the wall I want you to see what's going on among Israel not only they doing wicked stuff but they are all in a Dollar Tree hallelujah they're dancing to bail see if you're not dancing in the spirit you're dancing to bail that's all I'm telling you bill is the choreographer he choreograph things but when it comes to God when you dancing the spirit you don't know which way you're gonna move there y'all getting quiet on me now but it's okay we're gonna live and we're gonna worship God in spirit and in truth and you must be determined Amen if I am the only one he knock had a attitude about his holiness in his wake walkway of walk he had an attitude if I'm gonna be the only one did you know that brother Branham said that he not one day said goodbye to his wife and family and walked on with God so if I had a family in which we didn't even know but he was determined he would go stay in that spirit and that truth brother man said I'm so happy that God amen to know that Jesus will never forsake us is that right I'm so happy it meant coming out of to see Jesus I am so happy that Jesus will not forsake me is that right you know I look at people and sometimes I look at the scriptures and I think okay you had the you had rehabing in Jericho you had the woman at the well you had Mary who had all those demons and all and you know and even even Jesus is up disciples all had issues so God didn't come for sanctified people or people who already think the fact he came to get people who were a mess their life was a mess hallelujah that's where God is glorified is that right he he didn't just start the world and then he could have fashioned the world and everything else and it could have been perfect order but he wait to the world was a mess it was chaotic and then God said let there be hallelujah and every one of us has a testimony and like I tell people I don't care listen you can say I had this demon with me a long time as far as I know of this thing to torment me all my life well there was a man who was born blind lived it thirty years did that mean because you were born blind you don't if there's no possibility for you to see absolutely not you and I have been ordained to be sons and daughters of God y'all understand me but you gotta believe that God is able you can't believe that a devil is more powerful than God you gotta believe that God is God that's what he said he that cometh believed to me must believe that God is God and that he is a rewarder of bills that diligently seek Him people I don't care how messed up you are physically or spiritually my God is able B contains you please don't ever give up on God hallelujah don't give up on him if God can change the world he can change you and he put all those examples in there how many of us it was like Lazarus who was dead for days rotting with the maggots and everything else and God changed and we still live don't ever think don't let the devil make you confused in your mind that that God is not able to change me I've been like this so long that though it makes no difference with God he chose you while you were this way you understand me that means he can transform your ways he can do it if you let him it doesn't mean it's gonna be easy but you've got to surrender to it and like I said don't dress cold Joe don't don't dress those sins up when you get on your knees if you want all of those when you get on your knees you know don't don't say with Lord forgive me for my known sins in my unknown sins if you got a spirit and lust if you got a spear with fornication it doesn't matter what the Spirit is anything outside the Holy Ghost is perverted you're not the only one that has dealt with perversion no see y'all don't think I was born perverted everyone in of us in here was born perverted that's why you got to be born again hallelujah people are so afraid well I don't want nobody to know what different does it mean I don't care if I was blind and now I see what difference does it make who's gonna judge you according to Isaiah 54 says nobody gonna judge me at the end of the day I'll be the judge who's gonna run the castle a world look at this is what this is what used to getting it next to me when I was in the nomination how people used to say well you know she used to be or he used to be don't be with that person because he used to be oh I used to get so angry brother I said well then does the blood of Jesus Christ have any power over here I don't care what a person used to be you understand me you should always living in sodomy tomorrow I don't care of a man coming here with a dress on if he comes in here with a dress on and he want to be changed he is welcome me women come in with pants on but they come to be changed that's what this is all about if we're not gonna be the hospital for the world we are we not the answer to the devil's questions we are the security we have the salt we are the hospital we are the rescue that's what truly is we have to be the ones to say praise God I know God can deliver coz I used to be Alleluia you know my thing is you know they ask Jesus Christ about prayer how should I pray I love this let thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven I love that Jesus is the spirit of prophecy you know what we've known we knew nothing about a bride before God sent Malachi for anybody you knew I didn't know you know for serious seriously when I was in the world as well as the church I always would hope that God was saved me you know I figure oh my God if I get caught doing something wrong and I died then I'm going to err that's not true see that's not truth yeah you know you look at you look at you look at a job's children they were caught partying according to brother branham they were not they were only under the blood because Joel made the sacrifice but he was worldly children and because they had a father who kept the token applied they ended up with salvation hallelujah brother brother tell us about this man this preacher who back slid he back slid and he tells us Amen how he's brother band he was a mechanic brother man who went to see him because he heard that the man had Baxter he said no I'm not going to serve the Lord any more he said you gotta be kidding no I'm not I'm serious and shortly the man died I don't know of alcoholism or whatever the case may be and brother branham said that man was saved say God couldn't get him into her pin and just like any parent he spanked him and put him to sleep brother mighty god you sir that's that's real grace that's what truth is it's based upon election God then chose you egg let me say like this so you can understand the Bible says blessed is the man that hears the sayings of this book now have you heard that means you blessed that means the devil can't curse you is that right blessed is the man not only that here's an read of it but he said blessed is a man why I love it because he said here at the reading because you know some of us don't like to read but we ain't it raised the Lord Amen so God covers the reader and the hero you're blessed this is truth I give my life for this message I don't care what people say about me I know my heart and you're not gonna have we become systemized because I realized there's a certain way you got to preach in this message and I refuse to preach it that way you say what what do you mean there's a system have you ever heard of wrap this preacher preach all Baptist preachers preach the same way and Joba went down into the you know they have a system of preaching the Apostolic to you know they are a little higher up hallelujah oh yeah let us kneel but you see they all have a system and the message have developed a system you don't see it but I came because I'm a preacher and if you don't say it just right way and if you don't you know you use two minutes scriptures you're not in the message and if you're not holding a message book you're not in the message who's gonna tell me I'm not in the message it's not only that the message is in me so what good look at all the preachers good friends of mine I've already cried and who are now could take this message and the quotes of this message and tie a circle a ring around me make me look stupid and now they're denying it and those same preachers I used to we used to clash about the Holy Ghost they wanted the Holy Ghost to be intellectual I said ah the Holy Ghost is an experience say what you want to say but I've never had a desire to leave this message hallelujah they're had these people over here I'm talking about what we call truth wanted me to run to this truth and run to this truth this great man that great man there is no great man the only great man is Jesus Christ oh my prophet pointed me to Jesus Christ and that's not even brother Branham out you can't leave brother Branham out no more than you can leave out Noah and Moses but my point is Amen when it comes to worship my worship only is to my husband and I don't know why I'm going there but that's where I am you know I just try to tell people I'm seeing things enough you know I know it's fine it's just really thin it's a thin very thin line and what I'm saying because I've seen people who rejoice and scream and holler when people say things and they're not catching it they're not catching it they're not catching it because it's so fine you know like brother Branham said when that man said oh you saying you God and brother Branham said how'd he said it but basically he's saying yeah well he's not far off from the truth right because there were times when brother Branham was preaching it was absolutely God you and I cannot deny it he didn't deny it he said there were times I had to go back to my recording and listen to what he said he said you know he used my voice he used my lips youngness Tammy so when I listened to the tape I'm not listening to the tape of a man I'm trying to hear the voice in the voice hallelujah and that voice in the voice it's a one there's a time I was going through my change in life you know and and and I was just it was really bad and and and and and one day I had already said to myself Lord and I don't mean this to be so long I'm sorry I said Lord I said I'm I said Lord I said you know am I gonna make it because everybody go through their change in life in a different way but it was terrible mine was and if I didn't have friends who who would stand there and listen to my whining and complaining I don't know where I'd be today but I had some genuine friends in this message and one day I said to the Lord they didn't know all that was going on in my life but I said Lord am I going to make it am I going to make it Lord and then the Holy Spirit told me to fight I found a message and I clicked it on I clicked it on and it was a prayer line and and the prayer line was going on and and and brother branham's said to this woman he says you going through your menopause and you said to God am I going to make it he said thus said the Lord you're going to make it when he said that God is my witness something left me because brother Ben who talks about men when they going through their menopause or their change in life he said that's when a demon gets into it can get into it and God delivered me now I'm just telling you now see that wasn't the man William Branham that was a voice you love the Lord Seifer for none of us liveth to himself and no man dieth to himself for whether we live we live unto the Lord and whether we die we die unto the Lord and whether we live therefore or die we are of the Lord's for to this in Christ both died and rose and revived that we might be that he might be the Lord both of the Dead and the living is that understood so he's Lord of lords if in anybody agree with me on that he is the lord of lords the holy spirit that's in me is in everyone that really believed us he's in there cuz you know what it's a revelation hey oh I feel it I've been feeling it for a long time but that doesn't mean he's in you hallelujah y'all remember the time y'all boys I don't know whether y'all used to do this or not but we used to have rain it would rain and we play in that rain and get all wet but all of a sudden we wanted to taste it brother you don't taste the rain by keeping your mouth shut you hold your head up every child I know y'all I got some inspiration that children do let me see what it tastes like right and that's when you your experience is about greater because it's not experienced from the outside but now you're taking it in and that's how it is with God open your mouth wide the Bible says drink him in drink him him and went what Christ become a revelation to you it's like a baby being born a revelation right that's why you eat the word the bleeding bloody Word of God you eat it you gotta eat it people you'll never get stronger in the Lord but I don't care how much music you listen to and you know I love music but music won't transform me the word has been designed to transform you right amen so you must understand you're eating this in his this way it's not oh how many times you wished you were you were I wanted to be at least a 6-3 6-4 that's what I wanted out I thank God he didn't allowed it to happen because I really would have been playing basketball God wouldn't let it to happen you know I had all those brothers and everything taller than me and I'm short compared to the rest but I wanted to be tall but God knew no matter how much I wanted to be tall I'm still 510 511 I know I shrank a little bit so I think I'm giving myself a few more inches hallelujah but I'm trying to what I'm trying to say is that God load and make you this the way he wanted you to be right you can't sing like me I can't sing like you you can't preach like me don't come in here worshipping like I worship right you do not want that you don't want my spirit you want the Holy Ghost hallelujah it's all about Jesus Christ in you that's what truth is and we said all the movies on the bride but the move is on those who are have the Holy Ghost only inside of them hallelujah and we look for something so thank tax tastic you know we breathe in and out every day breathe or we and we hardly ever say would thank God for my breath we don't but it's so simple he's been with us all the time till it become common until you can't hardly breathe then you realize how important that is all about hallelujah and the Holy Ghost is so simple sometimes we don't even know he's there and he's dead trying to bring a change in your life trying to deal with you trying to do something amen by God's grace yes and and I'm not going to be much longer but I'm just trying to get to encourage you that you know we must have the divine nature on the inside it if God told Nicodemus you must be born again I'm listening I've been listening to the question and answers all this weekend last week and just heard some fantastic things they may may or may I heard before but it just seemed to all become you know illuminated you know and and when we when we see by God's grace that you know let me say like the Bible says we're about are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that it's in the world through the lust now let me say it like this if you're not preaching on truth and the truth is not a part of your life see whatever wherever you become perverted it is an avenue for a perverted spirit am i making sense for example when even Adam perverted the word by just adding the word not and understand perverting god's word is changing the meaning of anything that changes the meaning of what he's saying perverts it and that word not perverted the very thought of god and it was the gateway to all the fallen angels do you know as long as Eve stood and Adam stood Satan couldn't get in everything was pure everything was honest everything was just everything was holy but when when she broke the word it was a gateway in all the fallen angels that were behind Lucifer was now able to enter into the human race and brother Branham said it like this he said listen he said he said men died but the spirits don't and if the spirit don't die then where are they now where is the spirit that are norton Mussolini where is the spirit amen that an anointed Hitler where are these spirits hiding where the medal said these spirits left Europe and came to America and he tells us that here in America in where Hollywood but the devil now he changes his tactics of war because his whole intent is not just to kill the flesh to destroy the soul and so now he didn't fight him he develops this television set and he develops Amen a way of getting into you see those of us who are sealed with the Holy Ghost doesn't mean that the devil can get in your spirit the devil can anoint your spirit whip the Holy Ghost he can annoy your spirit and it is no spirit Amen that he will manifest himself through even though you got the Holy Ghost and so that the devil does he come through the tube you don't even know it's there how many times Oh Lord and not even knowing you know you you know football going on I love soccer I'm tell my debt that kind of football going on and all of a sudden you know you're looking at that thing and he scored he go oh you didn't even know you were there but in your spirit you were there hallelujah y'all understand me in your spirit you were there you you what you passed through the tube you went all the way to England wherever it was happening and you were there hey huh so you got to understand by God's grace and then if you can in tune yourself to the word the preacher would take you there is that the truth when he preached on Shadrach Meshach and Abednego if you are in tune in the word all of a sudden you become one of the character if not all three hallelujah and so you got to realize hey man this is truth to a true believer and I'm closing - a true believer this is you this is your identity right you take the message and you take the this Bible and you put it together and ask God give me understanding because a brother branham said when she begins to see who she really is she will become an invincible army and i'ma tell you the truth right now I am invincible because I got him on the inside you are to those of us Amen who are full of the Holy Spirit you have him right we can get ready for communion I can't I'm not gonna be able to finish the thought but my thought my thing is we've got communion tonight I almost forgot about it but but I want to say this to your people yeah brother Adam said it's it's very difficult for a pastor to get the people to really see the vision for some reason like I said there are no great great ministries you know I mean we follow people instead of following Christ you know and I've seen special when I was in Lima Ohio I've seen different ministers because of their name come by my church and preach the same thing out preach and the preacher before I'm thinking I just preached that yesterday it is something about other personalities right oh oh you say you know my wife give this sister a recipe of a pound cake and you know I meet my wife cake and it's okay it's okay because I've got in common it's become common it's still good and then the sister can bring a piece of cake over you show oh my goodness and you don't even know that's your wife recipe you understand but it's something about this right that makes us want something extra something different hallelujah amen and you and I must understand that this message will never grow over understand it is not the intelligence of a man that gives him the truth of Revelation it is God's business God gives revelation you can be dumb as a doorknob and God has chosen you and he'll give you that revelation nobody else has ever seen before right but you know what i'ma tell you you gotta be watchful in closing how many are you might not remember I remember the brother who started he took the one quoted brother branham about the holy ghost without sensation he worked and all of a sudden all the gifts disappeared around the message all the power of God and nobody was watching it but me because I stayed true the Holy Ghost I stayed true and I'm watching this thing and I know the brother who started it because it started when he started it it kind of like shook it shook a little bit and the whole and sudden everybody started okay the Holy Ghost without sensation the Holy Ghost without sensation but they never could finish the quote about the life huh you kind of have the life if you don't have sensation you got to have the life have the Holy Ghost without sensation if you want to remember just like I try to tell people the Holy Ghost has always came without coming without sensation on the day of Pentecost they had sensation but they had the Holy Ghost before they had the sensation probably God just unveiled to us where the depth of because in the soul there are no emotions he said in the soul there's either faith or unbelief and when the Holy Ghost hid your soul your faith grabs it it's a revelation then all of a sudden as he comes up like a well of water springing up into eternal life it lose from the soul to your spirit and your spirit reacts and your flesh reacts but the birth came in your soul always have because God never have sex with his people hmm so but people were all holy goes with our sensations holy goes without sensation now you don't even have people praying because they gave away the sensation hmm see they gave away the emotional thing why do you think God gave you motion your emotions came because he wants you to worship you with him with it what do you think music is all about why did he love David David was very emotional am I am I am I going to long but my thing is this because people didn't listen and so many people right now don't have the Holy Ghost because preachers have gotten lazy nobody want to pray with people and people don't want to pray long enough hello and most of the time now people don't even preachers don't even know how to pray they hadn't prayed in in a long time for hours it's the truth people it's the truth they don't want to labor deposit labor to enter into his rest you labor when you really want God you act like you act like blind Bartimaeus Jesus not son of David have mercy on me you know you start praying like that even people in the prayer like oh my god I can't concentrate you can't concentrate cuz you're not praying you're praying but you're not praying when you pray you pray you know you shut he said you got this you got to shut off that sound barrier oh that brother's too loud that's sisters tuna you got to go B yah lord help me listen it might become a shouting match because somehow I'm gonna break through and I'm gonna close you off I'm gonna reach that place where that sound barrier break boo and I'm gonna sail to that find him he finds me you understand me I'm not saying everybody had to get it that way but I will say because the the perfect way of getting your Holy Ghost is by the preaching of the gospel the Bible said they heard the word and the Holy Ghost failed that is the perfect way but because of our day and time sometimes you have to labor just to get people to deny it's all it's about is to surrender simple it really is but men as men we love the harder way we loved it we have to go the hard way brother branham never never did say it was wrong man fact he prayed and labored with people y'all remember that if you don't recall that I'm just gonna give you one tape that's God and simplicity right after the seals right at the end brother branham is helping a Pentecostal brother labor with the people to get the Holy Ghost best and we're gonna read the scripture I know there's a lot of issues that goes on and I heard brother Branham he said for the man said I preached by inspiration and I believe if I am which are which all ministers are those who verse who are really called by God we preached by inspiration I love the people of God and I want to see I want to see people make a rapture the Bible said make your call and election sure well some of us have already made it sure I want to encourage everybody I don't care like I said wherever God found you he knew what you were and what you was all about before he called you but one thing that God placed in that old dirty dirt of yours was a seeding of representation and nobody can take that from you Corinthians says and such were some of you and in Corinthians he named all my sins and things but he said in some of you were there saying I wish I could say in a way that praise God when God saved me I didn't have no problems I had a lot of problems and I mean I was graced to have a wife as patient and it's loving as she has been toward me because I really believe if I had chosen a different one we wouldn't have we wouldn't have a wife today and therefore I wouldn't be standing but I show thank God for his grace and His mercy I think I love truth I uh like I said nothing will change my heart I I've seen friends who brought me to this message Walker walk away who could take this Bible quote it almost verbatim quotes verbatim and and and they walk away and deny the prophet in his ministry well I don't have that in me and III have to do it do everything the way God showed me to do because you know at the end of the day I would have to give an account now if I go straight of the word is you obligated to tell me you obligated to show me where I'm wrong and you know like I said show me it depends on how you you know how to say nobody really fresh don't like correction but the soul does and my soul says yes my soul says yes I love this word I love the people of God I want to tell you in my closing this is don't ever don't brothers sisters I know some of y'all been raised in it I'm telling you your parents can't give you no greater treasure if they had given if they had a million dollars to give you it wouldn't out to nothing compared to what they'd given you what they're trying to do we god has has preserved you and protected you from this evil age and brought got you parents that are trying to teach you right trying to teach you what is truth don't stray please because they've given you something that's more precious than gold more precious than gold and somehow you got to ask God show me give me understanding of what my parents are seeing don't say oh I want to go out I want to do this I want to do that it's the trick of the devil it really is and encourage your brothers and your sisters these young people you know y'all got so much to deal with encourage your brothers and sisters that this is right even if you don't even see it right now you know it's right I just know if I go to hell I guess I go to hell riding on this message but I don't I don't fear hell death all agree because I passed from death unto life and you know I thank God for his mercy let us turn to first Corinthians first corinthians the 11th chapter i appreciate your patience i appreciate for those of you who come from iowa city i know it's a long drive but i really i really i am really encouraged every time i see you because i know i know the sacrifice that you make and and you got to go back and go to work and things like that if I appreciate it God does to you 1st Corinthians the 11th chapter we'll start reading at the 23rd verse by a received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he brake it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had supped saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as oft as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup ye do show the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that Cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily he eateth and drinketh damnation to himself not discerning the Lord's body but this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chastened of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world well for my brethren when you come together to eat tarry one for another and if any in hunger let him eat at home that you come not together unto condemnation and the rest I was set in order when I come we'll prepare a sky brother toy to come help us as I go in all hearts and minds clear
