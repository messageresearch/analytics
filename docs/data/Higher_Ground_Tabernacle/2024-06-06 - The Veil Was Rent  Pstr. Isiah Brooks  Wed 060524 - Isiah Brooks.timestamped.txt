[18:53] 3 9-
[18:57] 12 and to make make all men see what is
[19:02] the Fellowship of the mystery who
[19:04] created All Things by Jesus
[19:13] Christ to the intent that now unto the
[19:16] principalities and powers in Heavenly
[19:19] places might be known by the church the
[19:22] manifold wisdom of God
[19:29] Jesus our
[19:34] lord and this is the part I love in whom
[19:38] we have boldness and excess with
[19:42] confidence by the faith of him
[19:45] amen we start at the first
[19:48] verse of the third chapter
[20:00] if ye then be risen with Christ seek
[20:04] those things which are above where
[20:06] Christ sth on the right hand of
[20:13] God not on things of the
[20:19] Earth for ye are dead and your life is
[20:22] hid with Christ shall appear then shall
[20:27] ye also appear with him in
[20:34] glory mortify th Therefore your members
[20:38] which are upon the Earth fornication
[20:41] uncleanness inordinate affection evil
[20:44] concubines and covetousness which is
[20:48] idolatry things sake the wrath of God
[20:52] cometh on the children of disobedience
[20:59] in which ye also walked
[21:01] sometime excuse me in in the which ye
[21:05] also I'm going to read Colossians 3:5
[21:09] again uh just in a in a in in another
[21:13] way it says therefore put to death what
[21:18] belongs to your Earthly nature amen
[21:21] sexual immorality
[21:39] amen let us pray our gracious father God

[21:45] know how and we thank you for your grace
[21:48] word to us forgive us of our sins
[21:52] cleanse us from all unrighteousness Lord
[21:56] oh God and we pray even so
[21:59] that you would count us
[22:01] worthy to escape all of the
[22:04] Wrath that is to come upon the Earth
[22:07] have mercy upon our
[22:09] souls as we call upon your name
[22:14] Hallelujah so Lord Jesus we come before
[22:18] you as humbly as we know how you know us
[22:22] Lord you know all about us oh God you
[22:26] know our today
[22:29] our yesterday and you know our future
[22:33] and father God we pray that your mercy
[22:36] and Grace will be upon this assembly
[22:39] that Vision that you brought through
[22:42] Malachi for and will be grateful and
[22:46] thankful in Jesus Christ's name we pray
[22:49] amen you may be
[22:52] seated uh by the grace of God
[22:55] we uh have been uh just uh trying to get
[22:59] these thoughts
[23:00] together uh to to minister
[23:03] tonight but by the grace of God I trust
[23:07] that everything that I have received of
[23:09] the Lord uh will bless you
[23:13] tonight uh because the victory is in the
[23:16] lord it's not in me I'm just a man but I
[23:22] trust that the god in
[23:24] me uh my subject
[23:26] tonight is the veil was
[23:31] rent and you know with that being
[23:34] said uh we know when the veil was
[23:39] rent it was rent over 2,000 years
[23:44] ago Hallelujah and we know that when it
[23:48] did
[23:49] rent it was God who rent The Veil and so
[23:53] uh I'll say this by the grace of
[23:56] God brother brandham said
[23:59] that when that veil was know and I know
[24:02] that there was a time it would have been
[24:05] meant
[24:07] death to to to men if they would try to
[24:11] go beyond that
[24:13] Veil only the high
[24:15] priest could go behind the veil and that
[24:19] was once a
[24:22] year Hallelujah when the veil was rent
[24:26] the Lamb of God was there in plain
[24:30] view but they could not see
[24:33] him they did not recognize him uh to the
[24:38] Jew he was an
[24:40] impostor Hallelujah but for
[24:45] those who could see him he was their
[24:49] lord and savior the very Mercy Seat
[24:53] Hallelujah that was once in
[24:55] symble was now being manifested
[24:59] in human
[25:00] flesh and the world could not recognize
[25:04] him Hallelujah they should have
[25:07] seen that something was odd about this
[25:12] man uh because at his death a boat of
[25:16] lightning came and penetrated the
[25:21] temple
[25:23] veil there he hung The Mercy Seat sir in
[25:28] plain but it was hi hidden from them
[25:34] Jews because God had blinded
[25:38] them Hallelujah if the Jews could have
[25:41] seen
[25:42] him they would have him hallelujah what
[25:47] was behind the
[25:48] veil Hallelujah no doubt wondered what
[25:53] was behind it as I said only the high
[25:57] priest could go behind
[25:59] that and he could not go behind the veil
[26:04] any kind of
[26:05] way he had to be
[26:09] Sanctified he had to be purified by the
[26:14] blood he had to wear a certain
[26:18] garment and that garment was a Garment
[26:20] of
[26:21] Praise Hallelujah that garment had pum
[26:25] granates on it
[26:28] so that when he could go behind the
[26:31] veil there was no sadness there there
[26:35] was nothing but
[26:37] joy and if those bells was wasn't
[26:43] sounding they knew that the
[26:49] priest and all that
[26:52] PRI in going Beyond the Veil he had to
[26:57] tie a rope or around his
[26:59] waist just in
[27:02] case Hallelujah just in
[27:06] case Hallelujah his his life wasn't he
[27:10] wasn't the life of
[27:14] God and he would die because no no
[27:19] unclean
[27:21] thing could go behind the
[27:24] veil without God's judgment Hallelujah
[27:28] is that right he have come to this
[27:32] ageed by their Creed and dogmas they
[27:36] can't see
[27:37] him yet he came as he did with the
[27:41] Jews the
[27:43] Messiah was in plain view Hallelujah but
[27:48] he was
[27:49] hidden because God said even in this age
[27:54] that LE the SE would be blind
[27:58] understand me because even in the time
[28:01] when the Jews was
[28:04] blinded a devil Hallelujah they called
[28:08] him
[28:09] Lord amen the true seed of God has been
[28:13] given eyes to see Hallelujah according
[28:18] to the Book of
[28:19] Revelation the third
[28:21] chapter God
[28:23] says
[28:25] hallelujah that you might be able to see
[28:29] Hallelujah we didn't understand that but
[28:32] brother brandham liking it to the church
[28:35] getting so
[28:37] cold Hallelujah to the wind and the
[28:40] coldness would mat their eyes together
[28:44] Hallelujah and it took it took some
[28:48] IAB Hallelujah now I don't know about
[28:51] you but I was born in a poor
[28:54] situation and I've had that experience
[28:58] it is it is a frightening
[29:01] experience when you wake up in the
[29:03] morning and you can't open your eyes you
[29:07] try to open it open them it is a painful
[29:11] thing H y'all better hear what I'm
[29:14] saying and God had my my mom used to put
[29:19] H H castor oil or or some kind of liquid
[29:23] oil uh uh in on my eye and rub it
[29:29] until the cross would break
[29:32] away there is a
[29:35] script or a part
[29:40] word that is is
[29:44] mysterious and and and and though it be
[29:49] here and it's living its
[29:52] life according to the
[29:55] scripture amen but you see this
[29:59] word is a living
[30:02] word that is now on
[30:05] display because see when they killed
[30:08] Jesus Hallelujah so that you could
[30:10] recognize this Jesus
[30:14] flesh was not
[30:16] God that could taste death y'all better
[30:20] hear what I'm saying amen so we find out
[30:24] that in that Temple the Bible said dwelt
[30:28] the fullness of the godhead
[30:31] bodily he was in the
[30:34] world and the world knew him not
[30:37] Hallelujah he was a Living Word
[30:41] Veil Hallelujah and when he he he he he
[30:46] he
[30:47] died Hallelujah he
[30:49] promised that he would
[30:51] return I go
[30:54] away Hallelujah because if I go away the
[30:58] father was send what to
[31:00] comforter and this comforter at the name
[31:03] of Jesus
[31:05] Christ hallelujah it's the same
[31:08] yesterday today and forever Hallelujah
[31:12] because that name is that right brother
[31:15] Bram said that God is
[31:19] imor he changes his Mass but he never
[31:23] changes character character of Jesus now
[31:28] Hallelujah he still is
[31:31] alive and he still lives in a people
[31:35] veil was
[31:37] rent because of his
[31:39] body being
[31:41] rent Hallelujah pierced in the
[31:45] side which both of them represented life
[31:50] and that life was promised to be given
[31:54] all of those who would believe
[31:58] Hallelujah is that right and let me say
[32:01] it like this the word has never lost its
[32:06] power hallelujah what was behind that
[32:10] Veil it wasn't just a man that was
[32:13] looking for pity hear what I'm saying in
[32:16] in his in his
[32:18] death he conquered death Hell In The
[32:21] Grave y'all better hear what I'm saying
[32:24] hallelujah in a shame in a pity
[32:28] but what they did not
[32:31] realize is that he took upon their
[32:35] shame and their pity Hallelujah y'all
[32:38] hear what I'm saying and the beautiful
[32:41] thing about
[32:42] this they looked upon him and they
[32:46] didn't
[32:47] recognize that he was a very
[32:50] lamb but this lamb did not just have the
[32:54] nature of a man but he had the nature of
[32:57] God
[32:59] Hallelujah and there he was
[33:02] able Hallelujah to forgive the
[33:06] sins of the whole world now we can't
[33:10] even fathom that billions upon billions
[33:14] upon billions of people hallelujah just
[33:17] one drop of blood was able to save the
[33:21] whole world saved the people in that
[33:26] day and the days to
[33:29] come it didn't stop there it went back
[33:33] to
[33:34] yesterday Hallelujah and saved all of
[33:37] them who died in
[33:39] faith what power what a powerful
[33:43] blood but it wasn't just the blood it
[33:47] was the life of the blood y'all hear
[33:50] what I'm saying the veiled is
[33:53] rent Hallelujah the sacrifice has been
[33:56] accepted
[33:57] Hallelujah and those that are in bondage
[34:01] can go
[34:02] free that's it it's not about you but
[34:07] the Bible says it's not by power it's
[34:11] not by might but it's by my spirit say
[34:14] the Lord
[34:15] hallelujah
[34:17] why because God became the
[34:23] sacrifice Hallelujah to God you love the
[34:26] Lord
[34:28] oh let me read something you know in the
[34:32] Old Testament to enter behind the skin
[34:35] was
[34:41] death now to stay from behind it is
[34:45] death glory is
[34:48] death see that happens of
[34:51] course at the renting of the
[34:54] veil at Calvary when the Veil was rent
[34:59] the old
[35:01] Veil now to stay out of his presence is
[35:07] death see it changes back and
[35:10] forth and you must find the
[35:13] scripture to see what your
[35:17] important Hallelujah because we can't
[35:19] stay in the inner Court we can't stay in
[35:22] the outer
[35:24] Court the outer court is death the court
[35:28] is death we've got to go all the way
[35:31] into the holies of holies we've got to
[35:35] go Beyond the Veil Hallelujah we don't
[35:39] have to knock on the door the grace of
[35:42] God see we
[35:45] come to show him
[35:49] alive Hallelujah I was thinking about
[35:52] the
[35:53] bride even though the word call us the
[35:57] bride
[35:59] we're we're like a woman with no
[36:02] name we don't have a denominational
[36:05] name hallelujah we're the
[36:08] word
[36:10] hallu that's true brother am and she is
[36:15] hidden in his name think about it the
[36:18] women in the
[36:20] Bible are often
[36:23] not known by name
[36:27] only special
[36:29] ones Hallelujah and I got that
[36:33] thought and I said that's
[36:36] right God had the devil looking in the
[36:40] wrong
[36:42] direction he was actually trying to stop
[36:45] the
[36:46] man as our brother said but you see the
[36:50] man
[36:52] seed was
[36:54] corrupt it could have never brought
[36:56] forth perfection
[36:59] but the devil spent all of those
[37:02] years trying to stop the Royal
[37:06] seed Hallelujah it was already
[37:10] written where a woman would surpass the
[37:14] man Hallelujah and that that that that
[37:18] scripture to my understanding refers to
[37:23] Mary she's the only
[37:26] woman that was able to bring forth a
[37:30] child without a
[37:32] man Hallelujah it was
[37:36] there God gave
[37:39] Victory and made the devil look
[37:42] stupid can I say it like that Hallelujah
[37:47] you don't see get Joseph to kill her to
[37:51] Stone her but then God
[37:55] intervened why would you say that why
[37:58] did he
[38:00] intervene because he said
[38:02] Mary that's my
[38:05] son this is a supernatural thing
[38:09] Hallelujah and that's what the what the
[38:11] devil don't understand that he know God
[38:14] would God has a a woman Hallelujah who's
[38:19] willing to
[38:22] remember he said he didn't
[38:25] know that he would have to go through
[38:27] that
[38:29] said he was
[38:30] nervous but he again called his arm
[38:33] called
[38:35] meaty I mean in the vision never called
[38:39] her
[38:40] name Hallelujah when they called William
[38:45] Bram they called their
[38:48] names Hallelujah they took the name of
[38:51] their
[38:52] husband H oh come on somebody see that's
[38:56] the way it always have been but we could
[38:59] not see that's why the Bible says
[39:03] whatever you do in word or deed do it
[39:08] all in his name is that right all the
[39:12] heaven and
[39:14] earth that is Born
[39:17] Again is named after
[39:20] him oh glory to God is that right is
[39:25] moving
[39:27] and we don't have to
[39:31] worry is that right because remember
[39:34] when Adam
[39:38] fell he had to give an
[39:41] account for his
[39:44] wife Hallelujah is that right so is it
[39:48] with
[39:49] Jesus hallu he's got to give
[39:53] account
[39:56] for that's why he said he justified
[40:00] us that's why Paul said my life is hid
[40:04] in
[40:05] Christ Hallelujah is that right Paul
[40:09] said I don't want to know nothing the
[40:11] blood came back or the life of the blood
[40:16] on the day of
[40:17] Pentecost Hallelujah and he still lives
[40:22] because the Holy Ghost is still being
[40:24] given
[40:25] out Hallelujah when the Hallelujah
[40:29] Ephesians 3
[40:32] 15-21
[40:34] Hallelujah is that right it's the
[40:38] true even when God tolds
[40:42] Abraham I'm going to visit you according
[40:44] to the
[40:46] years or the time of
[40:49] con he came to
[40:52] Sarah yall understand me he byass
[40:56] Abraham
[40:58] and and impregnated
[41:01] Sarah you understand what I mean now God
[41:04] didn't impregnate Sarah yet he did but
[41:08] he used Abraham's seed y'all understand
[41:12] me he made her womb
[41:16] ready he gave her body
[41:19] strength see he did all of that and that
[41:23] was a shadow and a
[41:25] type of today
[41:27] Hallelujah when God found us we were
[41:31] like Sarah Hallelujah we couldn't
[41:34] believe it could be true Hallelujah but
[41:38] as we move forward God is giving us
[41:42] strength God has giv us Faith Hallelujah
[41:46] because this seed can only be received
[41:50] if the faith of God is in
[41:53] you Hallelujah the thing that you
[41:56] believe there impire possible God has to
[41:59] bring you to a place where you can see
[42:01] it's it's possible and I am the one that
[42:06] God has chosen to bring
[42:08] forth the promised
[42:11] seed
[42:14] Hallelujah uh Ephesians
[42:16] 3:15 of whom the whole family in Heaven
[42:19] and Earth is
[42:22] named that this why we name this that he
[42:25] would Grant you you hear that Grant you
[42:29] grant me according to what the riches of
[42:33] his what
[42:35] Glory what is his glory but his holy
[42:38] spirit to be
[42:40] strengthened with might by his spirit in
[42:42] the
[42:43] enemy hallelujah how he did Sarah he
[42:48] must do
[42:49] us hallelujah that's exactly right that
[42:53] Christ May dwell in your hearts by fath
[42:57] PR amen that ye being rooted and
[43:00] grounded in
[43:03] love
[43:05] Hallelujah may be able to
[43:08] comprehend with All Saints what is the
[43:12] breath and the length and the depth and
[43:15] the height
[43:17] Hallelujah it said that we may be able
[43:21] to comprehend that means it's
[43:25] not incomprehensible
[43:28] it mean that you can't Hallelujah we
[43:32] can't explain it can anybody explain
[43:35] love but you know when you got it
[43:39] Hallelujah comprehend with All Saints
[43:43] what is the bread the length the depth
[43:47] and the height and to
[43:49] know not Wonder at it to know the love
[43:54] of Christ which passes now
[43:58] that he might be filled with all the
[44:00] fullness of
[44:01] God hallelujah that ye might be filled
[44:07] with all the fullness of God hallelujah
[44:10] I don't know about you but I want to be
[44:13] filled with all the fullness of God
[44:16] hallelujah I wanted to to
[44:19] go
[44:21] above exceedingly above hallelujah what
[44:25] my mind think amen
[44:27] that's what the prophet God
[44:30] said uh
[44:32] today Hallelujah in the unveiling of God
[44:36] he said we're just
[44:37] humans We're Men we can only comprehend
[44:41] like
[44:43] flesh Hallelujah it takes God to take us
[44:47] beyond
[44:48] that we can't do it on our own but God
[44:52] said this is where I want to take
[44:55] you because of Veil is
[44:58] rent I want you know I want you to know
[45:01] me like Paul says not only just in my
[45:04] suffering but I want to know him in the
[45:07] power of his
[45:08] resurrection Hallelujah because his veil
[45:12] was
[45:13] rent he had to die he had to suffer you
[45:17] see how Priceless this message become
[45:21] when you realize how oh my God how Jesus
[45:24] had to suffer for it Hallelujah he shed
[45:28] his blood for you he shed his blood for
[45:31] me Hallelujah is that right and the
[45:35] Bible said the suffering of this world
[45:39] cannot be compared to the glory in which
[45:42] the father has in store for us
[45:46] hallelujah glory to God let's move on
[45:49] now unto
[45:51] him that is able to exceedingly
[45:54] abundantly
[45:55] above all all that we ask or
[46:00] think according to the power that
[46:03] worketh where in
[46:05] us the power must be in
[46:08] you let's read that again now unto him
[46:13] that is able to do exceeding abundantly
[46:16] above all that we ask or think according
[46:20] to the power that worketh in US
[46:28] and that word
[46:30] worketh with the
[46:32] e mean to continue to
[46:35] work Hallelujah it never
[46:38] stops Hallelujah that's why we move from
[46:41] glory to
[46:43] Glory Hallelujah unto him be glory in
[46:47] the church by Christ Jesus throughout
[46:51] all ages World A World Without End
[46:56] and Let the church say
[46:58] amen hallelujah
[47:01] Ephesians
[47:06] 3 n we read that already okay
[47:12] Colossians 3
[47:24] 1-7 you love the Lord amen
[47:28] you
[47:29] are as soon as you attach your name to
[47:33] something outside of the
[47:35] word you get in
[47:40] trouble see the deed of the
[47:44] nians was not only controlling the
[47:49] people but they were adding to the
[47:52] word and they made the people
[47:55] believe that their word word was just as
[47:58] authentic as Paul's
[48:01] word hallelujah and when they believe
[48:05] the nic's
[48:07] word over the over the prophet Paul
[48:12] word it brought death to them y'all hear
[48:15] what I'm saying and we find out that we
[48:19] have done the same thing many people
[48:22] have done the same
[48:24] thing Hallelujah even the prophet of God
[48:27] says whatever I say take it back to the
[48:31] Y
[48:33] thr
[48:34] Hallelujah and I won't get into some
[48:37] issues but I'll say many people amen
[48:41] have used the prophet's Life as a
[48:45] tradition Hallelujah and they have
[48:48] styled that
[48:50] tradition in so much it makes the word
[48:53] of God of none effect
[49:00] Colossians
[49:01] 3
[49:03] 1-7 see when when you say things like
[49:06] that it make people nervous but you need
[49:08] to read your
[49:10] Bible you need to read your
[49:13] Bible and and understand that everything
[49:15] brother Brandon preach is in there
[49:18] somewhere Hallelujah is that true they
[49:21] thought one time that the Thunders and
[49:23] the seals weren't in there and brother
[49:25] brand say is in there
[49:27] he said from Genesis all the way in
[49:29] Shadow and type is in
[49:31] there amen God can't tell you not to add
[49:34] and then he adds hallelujah it's in
[49:43] there wo Mercy Lord Colossians beginning
[49:47] at the first
[49:49] verse I mean the third chapter first
[49:51] verse if ye then be risen with
[49:55] Christ see
[49:57] those things which are above where
[49:59] Christ sth on the right hand of
[50:06] God set your affection on things above
[50:09] not on things on the
[50:11] earth
[50:13] Hallelujah for ye are dead your and your
[50:17] life is hid with Christ in
[50:21] God hallelujah now I don't know about
[50:24] you but that that says a lot to me
[50:27] Hallelujah because we have flesh we have
[50:31] to be
[50:31] careful the flesh is lusted against the
[50:35] spirit it it's always against the Holy
[50:39] Ghost Hallelujah the Holy Ghost will say
[50:42] pray and your flesh will say
[50:45] sleep Hallelujah the Holy Ghost will say
[50:49] fast and your flesh will say
[50:53] eat it is always a battle
[50:56] every day is a battle but Paul said it's
[51:00] our
[51:01] duty to kill the man every
[51:04] day crucify the
[51:06] flesh every day when you crucify him
[51:11] that means he pinned down he can't
[51:17] move
[51:18] yes for when Christ who is our life
[51:22] shall appear then shall we also appear
[51:25] with him in glory
[51:31] is that right I know I read that already
[51:34] but we need to we need to
[51:37] understand that our affections got to
[51:40] change God help us and the only way it
[51:44] will change is that we truly have a
[51:47] nature
[51:48] change is that right cuz cuz the dub
[51:52] don't hang out with the
[51:53] Buzzard oh my God help us now is that
[51:57] right amen the Bible said you can't have
[51:59] bitter water and sweet water coming from
[52:01] the same
[52:04] Fountain Hallelujah in other words
[52:07] something's wrong with
[52:09] that Hallelujah like I try to tell
[52:12] people amen when we came into this world
[52:16] we had the nature of Wrath the nature of
[52:19] the children of Wrath Hallelujah but the
[52:22] Bible said the soul that sinth it should
[52:23] surely
[52:24] die so that part of you must die and
[52:29] rock that God the seed of God may
[52:32] live Hallelujah it people say well we
[52:36] got dual natures and we will always have
[52:38] dual Natures you will always have your
[52:40] flesh but that's do mean that your
[52:43] nature and your flesh is
[52:45] connected when God comes in there it's
[52:48] his
[52:50] nature Hallelujah that is governing your
[52:55] your your flesh
[52:57] because the flesh doesn't forget because
[53:00] the spirit won't allow it to
[53:01] forget y'all better hear what I'm saying
[53:04] so God comes along and he gives you a
[53:07] new spirit and then he puts the Holy
[53:09] Ghost in that spirit and brother bam
[53:12] said when he gives you a new spirit that
[53:15] new spirit is given to
[53:17] you to be able to cope with the
[53:20] word hallelujah but that's not the end
[53:23] of it the nature must change
[53:28] Hallelujah no evil natured person is
[53:31] going to
[53:33] heaven Hallelujah you so what do you
[53:36] mean brother Brooks that's where the
[53:38] foolish virgins messed
[53:40] up even though they had the Holy Ghost
[53:44] they did they had a portion but they
[53:47] didn't take it to be Beyond the Veil cuz
[53:50] when you go Beyond the
[53:52] Veil all of it your nature everything
[53:56] everything dies back there and God
[54:02] Lives
[54:03] Colossians sorry Corinthians please
[54:07] two Hallelujah you love the Lord we try
[54:11] to hurry by God's
[54:15] grace and I
[54:18] Brethren when I came to you came not
[54:22] with Excellence of speech of wisdom
[54:24] declaring unto you the test of
[54:28] God for I determined not to know
[54:30] anything among
[54:32] you save Jesus Christ and him
[54:35] crucified why is it that Paul said I
[54:38] don't want to know nothing but Jesus
[54:39] Christ and him
[54:42] crucified and many of us want to know so
[54:44] much we want to know how the moon was
[54:46] shaped you know how many stars there is
[54:49] in the
[54:50] Galaxy I mean it's it's
[54:54] amazing how we do things that we feel is
[54:58] necessary and we learn all of the deep
[55:00] things of God and we fail to come to
[55:03] know Jesus Christ and him
[55:08] crucified Hallelujah we can't we fail to
[55:12] come and see the very the very thing he
[55:16] died
[55:17] for was to make us come to know him it
[55:21] was about fellowshipping with
[55:24] him Hallelujah
[55:27] and we have put churches we placed
[55:30] preachers uh uh different folks in in
[55:33] that place but God didn't come for us to
[55:37] come just to know everybody we come to
[55:41] know
[55:42] him we want to know him the man that
[55:46] died for you the one who R the veil the
[55:50] one who gave his life for you this is
[55:53] what we come to know what good will it
[55:57] do if we learn all the Creeds all the
[56:01] dogmas all the orders of the church and
[56:04] still don't know the man who was
[56:06] crucified for
[56:07] [Music]
[56:09] you how can you marry how can he marry
[56:14] someone that doesn't know him Hallelujah
[56:18] you said well I know how I been those
[56:21] I've seen God heal I've seen God deliver
[56:25] I've seen God raise the dead Lord I've
[56:27] done all these things in your name and
[56:32] Jesus said depart from me ye workers of
[56:35] iniquity for I don't know you see it's
[56:39] the in
[56:40] intimacy that God is looking for it's
[56:44] that uniting that he's looking for that
[56:47] invisible Union with you is what he's
[56:51] looking for Hallelujah is that right
[56:55] brother brandom said like this he said
[56:57] he could have had a wife he could have
[57:00] had children Hallelujah but the Bible
[57:03] said he Sanctified himself is that right
[57:07] and because he Sanctified himself he
[57:10] said ye are Sanctified because I'm
[57:13] Sanctified you are Sanctified in other
[57:16] words you're not going to choose
[57:18] nobody but Jesus Hallelujah the word
[57:22] will be your husband and only the word
[57:26] Hallelujah y understand what I'm saying
[57:29] I did not come in this Dimension to
[57:32] become to become rich or to become
[57:35] famous or to become a great preacher I
[57:38] came in this world so that the world may
[57:42] see that Jesus Christ
[57:45] lives Hallelujah in me and that's why
[57:50] you come you've come to show the devil
[57:53] that he's still defeated
[57:56] Hallelujah he will always be defeated
[58:00] Hallelujah because Jesus lives in
[58:03] us hallelujah I'm determined to know
[58:07] nothing among you save Jesus Christ and
[58:11] him
[58:12] crucified and I was with you in
[58:16] weakness and in fear and in much
[58:19] trembling what are you talking about
[58:22] Paul said I went through all those
[58:24] emotions because you go through those
[58:26] those emotions don't mean you don't have
[58:28] him Hallelujah your spirit will will
[58:32] send you through those things but it it
[58:35] it it doesn't it doesn't it doesn't
[58:37] dictate what's going on in the soul see
[58:41] that that inner man will will defeat all
[58:45] of
[58:45] that Hallelujah yes he said I came in
[58:49] weakness anybody know what I'm talking
[58:51] about he said I was in fear
[58:57] and when you in such fear you're
[59:01] trembling
[59:03] Hallelujah and my speech and my
[59:06] preaching was not with enticing words of
[59:09] man wisdom and basically saying listen I
[59:12] come but I know I must I I I go through
[59:16] all of this because I know that the
[59:18] words that I must preach to
[59:21] you will also be
[59:25] judged I fear I
[59:28] tremble I'm
[59:30] weak and while I'm weak he's
[59:33] strong and I don't want to put on a show
[59:35] for
[59:36] you it ain't about Hollywood or the
[59:40] theater or no no no no no this this this
[59:44] is about
[59:45] God and my speech and my preaching was
[59:49] not with enticing words of man's
[59:52] Wisdom but in the demonstration of the
[59:55] spirit and power y y'all see what I'm
[59:58] saying so the difference between
[1:00:01] Paul he had something in
[1:00:03] him even the devil's
[1:00:07] recognized
[1:00:09] Hallelujah so when the devil recognize
[1:00:13] you it's the Christ that he sees in
[1:00:16] you Hallelujah you're not like the sons
[1:00:19] of ska tried to put on the
[1:00:22] show The Power
[1:00:27] and a lot of people put so much trust in
[1:00:30] a
[1:00:31] preacher to that because they've seen
[1:00:34] the
[1:00:35] supernatural demonstrated in those
[1:00:39] preachers oh God his with
[1:00:42] them well God was with Judas too cuz
[1:00:46] Judas cast out devils and Judas was a
[1:00:50] preacher Hallelujah but brother Bram
[1:00:52] said he failed to go and get the Holy
[1:00:55] Ghost he missed
[1:00:57] Pentecost y'all hear what I'm saying see
[1:01:00] I don't care I look at people's
[1:01:02] character that's what I look for I don't
[1:01:05] care how great they preach I don't care
[1:01:07] if they've got thousands of people
[1:01:09] around them it means nothing to me
[1:01:13] because you know what I believe the more
[1:01:15] you stay with the

[1:06:04] visitor that was able to come out of
[1:06:07] Satan's hell he couldn't keep him he
[1:06:11] couldn't keep his Spirit there and he
[1:06:14] couldn't keep his body there though his
[1:06:17] body was
[1:06:19] dead God had already
[1:06:23] spoken I am the resurrection

[1:10:38] done hallelujah these things are freely
[1:10:41] given to the
[1:10:43] bride is that right Rebecca never asked
[1:10:46] Isaac for
[1:10:48] nothing she didn't even know him but he
[1:10:51] sent her gifts before she knew him
[1:10:56] Hallelujah and that's what God has done
[1:10:59] he's he was blessing us before we came
[1:11:01] to know him and if he blessed us before
[1:11:05] we knew him what will it be like when

[1:11:22] think I can do exceedingly abund
[1:11:26] above don't limit me I'm God he says
[1:11:31] hallelujah don't limit me don't limit
[1:11:35] the
[1:11:36] Lord Satan cannot be more powerful than
[1:11:40] God God is the devil's Creator y'all
[1:11:44] understand me he created all things and
[1:11:47] the creature cannot be greater than the
[1:11:51] Creator don't ever let Satan make you
[1:11:55] feel feel
[1:11:56] powerless when God said all power in
[1:12:00] Heaven and Earth is given unto me is
[1:12:02] that right and brother brandham said it
[1:12:04] like this all that was in Christ he
[1:12:08] poured it into his
[1:12:09] church Hallelujah why because all that
[1:12:13] was in God God poured it into Christ and
[1:12:17] all that was in Christ God poured it
[1:12:20] into the
[1:12:21] church Hallelujah that means god Chang
[1:12:26] his
[1:12:27] mask Hallelujah God IM Mor became us
[1:12:33] hallelujah glory to God that's why I
[1:12:36] love that name
[1:12:38] Jesus cuz it sounds like he's
[1:12:43] us
[1:12:45] hallelujah love my God I'm almost done
[1:12:50] coming from the message the unveiling of
[1:12:53] God you got to recognize God is in
[1:12:56] you you are the temple of
[1:12:59] God it's not by power it's not by might
[1:13:03] but by my
[1:13:04] spirit you know we put too much of us
[1:13:07] into
[1:13:08] it that's why we feel like
[1:13:10] failures we put too much of us into it
[1:13:14] it ain't got nothing to do with you it's
[1:13:16] all about
[1:13:17] God hallelujah is that
[1:13:21] right Rahab didn't know nothing about
[1:13:24] God only what she had
[1:13:27] heard but God in his mind knew exactly
[1:13:31] who Rahab was Hallelujah before Rahab
[1:13:35] married
[1:13:37] Salon God had already paired him
[1:13:41] up y'all hear what I'm saying and God
[1:13:44] knew what The Offspring was going to be
[1:13:46] y'all hear what I'm saying God is always
[1:13:49] in control when things look like it's
[1:13:51] out of control don't you worry
[1:13:56] Hallelujah and when the storms are
[1:13:59] raging that doesn't mean the sun is not
[1:14:03] shining because the storms only last for
[1:14:06] a while y'all know what I'm saying it is
[1:14:08] what it is God has shown us that so many
[1:14:12] times and we drop our head sometime in
[1:14:16] shame
[1:14:17] Hallelujah but one thing for
[1:14:20] certain God would have never chosen you
[1:14:25] if he knew you would give
[1:14:27] up the bride don't give
[1:14:30] up the bride doesn't give up she may
[1:14:34] fall she may falter she may even stray
[1:14:38] away but but she never
[1:14:41] forgets she
[1:14:43] knows like I heard the prophet of God
[1:14:47] say when Jesus ask Peter them where else
[1:14:51] can you
[1:14:52] go see once you make Jes Jesus once you
[1:14:56] really meet
[1:14:57] him nothing nothing else is
[1:15:00] appealing tell me after knowing this
[1:15:04] message what denomination you can go
[1:15:07] to what
[1:15:09] organization there's nothing so we have
[1:15:12] the same thing that's how you know
[1:15:14] you've met
[1:15:16] him see we want this thing to be so
[1:15:19] Grand but it's so simple because once
[1:15:22] you meet this message meet this word you
[1:15:27] can't go nowhere else nothing else will
[1:15:30] satisfy you and Peter said Lord where
[1:15:34] else can we go you have the words to
[1:15:37] eternal life huh and we know that to be
[1:15:41] the truth oh my God I feel so good
[1:15:45] tonight the unveiling of God
[1:15:49] 1964 I'm closing on
[1:15:52] this paragraph 281
[1:15:58] hallelujah hallelujah God we we so busy
[1:16:01] looking at all of these little
[1:16:06] fail and all these
[1:16:08] tests and we don't even know God testing
[1:16:10] us because he loves
[1:16:13] us hallelujah who the devil it ain't the
[1:16:16] devil God said
[1:16:18] so God allows it I've had so much
[1:16:23] trouble you know and and it doesn't mean
[1:16:25] you don't get a little anxious sometimes
[1:16:28] that's why the Bible said be anxious for
[1:16:30] nothing is that right Hallelujah but
[1:16:33] it's something here that gives you a
[1:16:37] peace even when you know you're
[1:16:43] wrong I had a friend when I was
[1:16:46] young I don't think it's he is is his
[1:16:51] grandparents I don't think he ever got a
[1:16:53] whiping
[1:16:56] but he always got me in
[1:17:00] trouble he didn't have to worry about it
[1:17:02] cuz he knew he wasn't going to get in
[1:17:04] Whi it no matter how bad he was y'all
[1:17:07] understand what I'm saying he had a
[1:17:09] peace that his grandparents loved him
[1:17:13] Beyond his
[1:17:16] failures and you better know that God
[1:17:18] loves
[1:17:20] you beyond your
[1:17:23] failures he conquered every everything
[1:17:25] for
[1:17:27] you now let's get to the
[1:17:30] quote like he was in
[1:17:32] Moses when the word was in Moses he was
[1:17:36] God in
[1:17:37] flesh when it was in
[1:17:39] Jesus it was God in flesh see only thing
[1:17:43] he don't done was change his
[1:17:46] mask not his word not his nature he is
[1:17:50] the same yesterday today and forever he
[1:17:53] only changes his his form he changed
[1:17:56] from Noah to Moses he changed from Moses
[1:18:00] to David from David to Joseph on down
[1:18:04] till he come into the fullness of the
[1:18:05] godhead
[1:18:06] Bing hallelujah it's still the same God
[1:18:11] amen amen I hope that that you get
[1:18:15] through see it is the same God but he
[1:18:19] just takes on another
[1:18:21] Veil see he puts on another Veil
[1:18:26] and let me let me say it like this don't
[1:18:29] ever think because you don't act like
[1:18:31] somebody else that God is not in you God
[1:18:35] makes music with
[1:18:37] you and every instrument doesn't sound
[1:18:40] the same but when you put it all
[1:18:43] together is that right they said that
[1:18:46] even the a even the Stars sings they
[1:18:50] make
[1:18:51] notes and every every Star has a
[1:18:54] different pit
[1:18:56] but God knows exactly what the chorus is
[1:18:59] he knows exactly what the song is y'all
[1:19:02] hear what I'm saying and and sometimes
[1:19:05] you got to have a little mourning in
[1:19:09] there Hallelujah you can't be happy all
[1:19:11] the
[1:19:13] time you got to have a little sadness in
[1:19:16] there in order this to display
[1:19:21] Victory you said brother books explain
[1:19:23] that to me Israel was God's
[1:19:26] people but God had to put them through
[1:19:30] slavery to get a certain
[1:19:34] sound y'all understand me he knew them
[1:19:38] he saw them and when it came to the
[1:19:41] place where he the music seat was about
[1:19:43] to change he said I'm come
[1:19:47] down God came
[1:19:52] down and he changed the music the
[1:19:55] Sheep what did he do he sent a
[1:19:59] prophet Hallelujah he turned their
[1:20:02] mourning into
[1:20:04] Joy is that right he he he he he he
[1:20:08] brought a
[1:20:09] lamb he showed them what they were going
[1:20:12] he was going to do in
[1:20:14] type in
[1:20:16] Shadow but when they left
[1:20:18] Egypt for the for the first time when
[1:20:21] they were leaving Egypt there was nobody
[1:20:24] was looking
[1:20:26] back huh it was only when they got into
[1:20:29] the to the Red Sea when they saw
[1:20:33] obstacles
[1:20:34] coming they then began to think about
[1:20:38] Egypt it wasn't that they weren't afraid
[1:20:40] to
[1:20:41] suffer they just didn't want to
[1:20:45] die they knew what suffering was they
[1:20:48] didn't they didn't want to die and this
[1:20:51] was God all along oh my God God will
[1:20:55] bring you into the face of
[1:20:58] death and what you going to do Lord why
[1:21:01] you brought me here how can I get out of
[1:21:04] this and God say stand still and see the
[1:21:07] salvation of the Lord huh God always
[1:21:10] make a way of
[1:21:12] Escape always make a way of
[1:21:17] Escape
[1:21:19] Hallelujah you know even God loves the
[1:21:21] feebleminded is that the truth amen
[1:21:26] and all of us get a little fever
[1:21:31] mind all of
[1:21:34] us but God loves
[1:21:37] us it is still the same God
[1:21:41] Amen I hope that it gets through see it
[1:21:44] is the same God but he just takes on
[1:21:48] another Veil see he puts on another
[1:21:53] Veil he did it in the reformers taken on
[1:21:57] a veil taken on a veil until finally it
[1:22:01] comes down through the Lutheran age down
[1:22:04] through the a other age then finally it
[1:22:07] comes out into the
[1:22:09] complete just before it comes a prophet
[1:22:14] arise again now listen what he says just
[1:22:18] before it comes a prophet
[1:22:22] arise Hallelujah so the the prophet is
[1:22:25] not the the ending
[1:22:28] point it's just
[1:22:32] before like John just
[1:22:35] before Jesus the word just before the
[1:22:38] scene changes did the did the scene
[1:22:41] change the scene must
[1:22:45] change
[1:22:46] hallelujah oh my God just before it
[1:22:50] comes a prophet arise
[1:22:52] again what it
[1:22:55] does it foreshadows the word showing
[1:22:59] back here revealing what's been
[1:23:03] done what's been left off that the
[1:23:06] church will be
[1:23:08] without not without
[1:23:11] understanding then when this Fades
[1:23:14] out then like John said I must
[1:23:18] decrease he must
[1:23:20] increase then all and all comes into him
[1:23:26] he is fully
[1:23:28] manifested through Luther Wesley
[1:23:32] Pentecostal age and on down on down and
[1:23:37] he is fully manifested you see come down
[1:23:41] just the
[1:23:42] manifestation God
[1:23:45] unfolding see him notice fulfilled in
[1:23:49] his promises for this day as they had
[1:23:56] so my my point is there is a
[1:24:01] fulfillment of God in Christ or or God
[1:24:05] in
[1:24:06] you Hallelujah it it doesn't
[1:24:09] stop with
[1:24:11] Elijah y'all understand what I'm trying
[1:24:13] I'm not taking away I'm saying there's
[1:24:16] another
[1:24:17] stage Hallelujah but we can't go with
[1:24:20] Joshua
[1:24:22] Ministry without knowled in Moses
[1:24:25] Ministry y'all understand what I'm
[1:24:27] saying cuz that's what God Said Joshua
[1:24:31] was not a
[1:24:33] prophet Joshua was a
[1:24:35] soldier you know he was a
[1:24:38] warrior glory to God the bride of Christ
[1:24:41] believe it or not you a
[1:24:43] warrior the Bible said put on the whole
[1:24:45] arm of God you're not putting on the arm
[1:24:48] of God and not having a Warfare but the
[1:24:52] Bible said our Warfare is not not not
[1:24:56] carnal but it's
[1:24:58] spiritual we're here to pull down the
[1:25:01] strongholds Hallelujah we are here to
[1:25:03] defeat the Devil in his own
[1:25:06] Eden Hallelujah is that right we're here
[1:25:09] to defeat him like Jesus did when he
[1:25:12] went to hell he defeated Satan on his
[1:25:15] own territory and we are here to defeat
[1:25:19] Satan on his own
[1:25:21] territory Satan is trying to tell us
[1:25:25] that we're not going to be translated
[1:25:27] we're not worthy to be changed
[1:25:30] Hallelujah but what he doesn't know and
[1:25:33] that the change is already started
[1:25:35] Hallelujah and we're moving from glory
[1:25:39] to glory not by power not by might but
[1:25:44] by his Spirit say the Lord
[1:25:48] hallelujah
[1:25:50] hallelujah oh my see
[1:25:55] and when Jesus
[1:25:56] came he was a word in its
[1:25:59] fullness because the whole Plan of
[1:26:02] Redemption laid in
[1:26:03] him the whole Plan of Redemption didn't
[1:26:06] lay in
[1:26:07] Moses didn't lay in Joseph didn't lay in
[1:26:11] Elijah see they were only part of the
[1:26:14] word pointing to it see now notice keep
[1:26:19] your thoughts here here it comes as I
[1:26:22] say see the whole plan wasn't in them
[1:26:26] they were pointing to it Hallelujah
[1:26:30] therefore after him the fullness we
[1:26:34] cannot point to something
[1:26:36] else it points back to him the word this
[1:26:41] is the complete Revelation nothing can
[1:26:45] be added or taken away from it there is
[1:26:49] the complete re
[1:26:51] Revelation all that sh of him to come
[1:26:56] but when he comes he was the perfect
[1:26:59] Hebrews 1 says God in son times spoke to
[1:27:04] the fathers through the
[1:27:06] prophets God spoke through veils the
[1:27:10] prophet but in the last day through his
[1:27:13] son Jesus Christ there you are unveiled
[1:27:18] out there on Calvary the Son of God
[1:27:21] unveil what was brother brandham saying
[1:27:24] that this word was being preached
[1:27:27] through his lips by Jesus Christ
[1:27:31] himself Hallelujah and let me tell you
[1:27:34] like this every preacher must have the G
[1:27:38] same Jesus Christ on the inside
[1:27:42] preaching through his
[1:27:44] lips Hallelujah glory to God
[1:27:49] notice Made
[1:27:52] Alive and today
[1:27:54] when the word is
[1:27:56] manifested in human vessels
[1:27:59] veils is absolutely the word fulfilled
[1:28:03] in that day which comes back to God
[1:28:07] being baptized of
[1:28:08] him according to First
[1:28:12] Corinthians 12 we become identified with
[1:28:16] him amen so in
[1:28:19] closing we must keep in
[1:28:22] mind Who We Are
[1:28:25] and we must fight to
[1:28:29] maintain that's what Jesus said the
[1:28:32] greatest battle ever fought is in your
[1:28:35] mind Hallelujah but this message came to
[1:28:38] give us our
[1:28:41] identity Hallelujah we came from God and
[1:28:45] we go back to
[1:28:47] God is that the scripture God didn't
[1:28:51] hide nothing from you he only is himself
[1:28:55] from the wise and The
[1:28:56] Prudent think about how blessed you
[1:29:01] are that millions of
[1:29:04] people billions maybe desire to have
[1:29:08] what you
[1:29:09] have you didn't bring
[1:29:12] yourself you didn't choose it
[1:29:14] yourself it was God
[1:29:18] choosing and you trying to tell me that
[1:29:20] God chose you to lose you
[1:29:24] no no no no I do believe though that if
[1:29:29] you are the bride of
[1:29:30] Christ you going to keep fighting
[1:29:34] fighting and
[1:29:37] battling until you see
[1:29:40] Jesus Christ Living in
[1:29:43] you him
[1:29:46] only you love the
[1:29:48] Lord I believe that we're on the break
[1:29:50] of something
[1:29:52] new and when I say that that don't mean
[1:29:54] that the word is new but God is getting
[1:29:57] ready to unfold see you you you could
[1:30:00] say I I know
[1:30:02] him but if it's letter you don't know
[1:30:06] him you can only know him by the
[1:30:09] spirit you hear what I'm
[1:30:12] saying if you don't have the Holy
[1:30:14] Ghost you just think you know
[1:30:17] him the Holy Ghost brings you to the
[1:30:20] knowledge of who he is and who you are
[1:30:24] and your relationship with
[1:30:26] him it really becomes a great love
[1:30:29] affair yeah he it's no longer a lord I
[1:30:33] got to do this and I got to do that
[1:30:35] no I love you so much I'm going oh I'm
[1:30:38] just excited you don't even think about
[1:30:41] it amen that's the way God wants us to
[1:30:44] be if he said run in the fire you run in
[1:30:47] the fire Hallelujah if the lions are
[1:30:50] roaring and ready to eat he said run
[1:30:52] there run through there you'll do it cuz
[1:30:56] you love him and you know it's just for
[1:30:58] a short moment and you'll be in his
[1:31:01] presence you don't fear nothing Satan
[1:31:04] brings he'll bring it but perfect love
