[0:00] Genesis 5:2 amen it says male and female
[0:05] created he them and blessed them and
[0:09] called their name Adam in the day when
[0:14] they were
[0:15] created one name remember that amen
[0:19] Isaiah 56
[0:21] and5 even unto them will I give in my
[0:25] house and within my walls a place and
[0:30] name better than Sons and Daughters I
[0:35] will give them an everlasting name that
[0:39] shall not be cut
[0:42] off a name better than Sons and
[0:45] Daughters
[0:47] woo Isaiah 62 and2 and the Gentiles
[0:51] shall see thy
[0:53] righteousness and all Kings thy glory
[0:57] and thou shalt be called by a new name
[1:01] which the Lord which the mouth of the
[1:04] Lord shall
[1:06] name let us pray Heavenly Father God we
[1:10] come before you as humbly as we know how
[1:14] we thank you for your goodness we thank
[1:18] you for your grace and everything that
[1:20] you have done for us truly Lord without
[1:24] you we are nothing and God we can't do
[1:28] anything without you and we're so
[1:31] grateful and we pray here this morning
[1:34] that you would give us Grace uh uh give
[1:36] us the grace to move completely out of
[1:39] your way Lord let no uh uh foolish
[1:42] thoughts uh enter out of my mouth uh let
[1:46] no foolish thoughts enter into my mind
[1:50] Lord I want to be totally
[1:52] captive by you and I want you to uh have
[1:56] free course in this vessel of clay uh
[2:00] that you've made and purchased with your
[2:02] own blood and may the glory all the
[2:06] glory be given to you in Jesus Christ's
[2:09] name we pray
[2:10] amen you may be
[2:13] seated we realize amen that we're living
[2:16] in a day that it just seemed to be so uh
[2:19] difficult for most people and you ought
[2:22] to be
[2:23] glad uh because if you're having it easy
[2:26] there's something wrong uh right now
[2:29] with your life and your relationship
[2:31] with God uh because first of all the
[2:34] Lord promised you trials and he told you
[2:38] amen that it was going to be difficult
[2:40] Paul even said it was going to be
[2:42] oppressed because he in his own day said
[2:46] I press toward the mark of a high
[2:48] calling which is in Christ Jesus but one
[2:51] of the things that have happened to you
[2:53] and me is that we have been visited by
[2:55] an Angel amen and when this angel came
[2:58] Amen to us he didn't just greet us but
[3:01] he told us what the work of God was
[3:04] going to be in us as the angel visited
[3:08] Mary he told Mary he says Mary this
[3:11] thing that be in you this new creation
[3:13] that God is going to bring forth will be
[3:16] God himself in you and we that was the
[3:19] alpha Hallelujah and we find out that
[3:23] even in the Omega God comes along and he
[3:26] finds a woman amen such as Mar Mary who
[3:31] would have the same attitude that Mary
[3:33] would have even though she couldn't
[3:36] explain how God was going to do it she
[3:39] said be it unto me according to your
[3:42] word amen amen and this Angel told her
[3:45] the same thing that this thing that be
[3:48] in you or told us the same thing this
[3:51] thing that be in you will be God himself
[3:54] amen hallelujah you will not bring forth
[3:57] the Christ child but you would bring
[4:00] forth the Christ man
[4:03] amen amen now we look at this thing and
[4:07] we said here we had the greatest
[4:10] invitation of all ages as far as I'm
[4:12] concerned the word of God said that you
[4:15] would be gold tried in the fire amen you
[4:18] didn't mind acknowledging the gold part
[4:22] but the Fire part is what you don't like
[4:24] but you said and when you answered to
[4:27] that call you say Lord I am willing to
[4:30] be gold Tred in the fire I love that
[4:34] because you have acknowledged that
[4:36] you're gold amen if you felt like you
[4:39] was wood you wouldn't even try it but
[4:42] you acknowledge the fact that you were
[4:44] gold and you were dirty gold that need
[4:47] to be tried in the fire oh God that
[4:50] feels good to me amen so God can cleanse
[4:54] you of all the filth of the world and
[4:57] pull out all the drought out of you so
[5:00] that you can become the very reflection
[5:04] and the Very mirror of the word amen now
[5:08] we look at this thing and you say my god
[5:10] brother B what are you trying to say the
[5:13] thing that really caught my
[5:15] attention about uh
[5:19] uh Adam and
[5:21] Eve was that they were
[5:26] both a
[5:27] son and one
[5:30] was a
[5:31] daughter is that right they both came
[5:34] from the same father who was
[5:38] God so even in the beginning now we know
[5:42] that this is outlawed so don't don't
[5:43] think that we're trying to preach some
[5:45] strange
[5:46] Doctrine it was
[5:51] always God in his own program could not
[5:55] have fixed it in any kind other kind of
[5:56] way because there was no second God
[6:00] there was another there was not anything
[6:01] that was aind to God other than that
[6:04] that was in God Amen so God pulls out of
[6:08] Eve uh Adam Eve well her name was
[6:12] Adam and we find out that he takes these
[6:15] two and he brings them to be what
[6:18] husband and
[6:20] wife amen they even asked the prophet of
[6:24] God a question say well who did Cain
[6:27] marry and he said Cain had to marry him
[6:30] sister cuz there was no other one to
[6:33] marry now the law came because of the
[6:36] blood
[6:36] change and God had to stop that kind of
[6:40] a thing because it became an unhealthy
[6:44] practice but in the beginning it was
[6:46] always so God couldn't marry anything
[6:50] outside of his own
[6:55] kind and I get there in just a moment
[6:59] so but you see you and I you say well
[7:02] brother that's nonsense well how
[7:04] nonsense can it be you both married you
[7:08] both come into this uh word of God and
[7:12] you know each other as brother so and so
[7:15] and sister so and so before you marry
[7:19] you his brother uh the woman's brother
[7:22] and the uh uh the the man is uh to to
[7:26] the woman is her brother and he's a
[7:28] sister you understand what I and she's
[7:29] the sister so even in
[7:33] church amen because the Bible forbids
[7:37] you to marry some
[7:40] other outside of your faith so even in
[7:44] your faith it is brother and sister who
[7:47] marri that's right and become one
[7:51] amen is that difficult to
[7:55] understand yeah it's in the Bible so I'm
[7:57] coming in just a minute
[8:00] because when you and I realize amen that
[8:03] what this is a family affair and God's
[8:06] Unite with God
[8:10] Amen right how many of y'all believe
[8:12] that Psalms of Solomon was the
[8:15] expression of Jesus Christ and his love
[8:17] affair yes according to Psalms of
[8:20] Solomon 4 and10 this is how he describes
[8:25] her how fair is thy love love my sister
[8:32] my
[8:36] spouse how much better is thy love than
[8:41] Wine now I'm going tell you something
[8:43] Solomon knew how to take simple words
[8:45] and put it
[8:49] together I love Solomon if you want to
[8:51] learn how to be romantic learn about
[8:53] Solomon so anyway we find out Solomon
[8:57] looks ATS because you understand if
[8:58] anybody anybody in here have ever tasted
[9:01] wine and enjoyed
[9:03] it hello oh y'all been saved all your
[9:06] life right M yes but nevertheless if
[9:09] you've been like me you you know I
[9:11] enjoyed
[9:13] wine I enjoyed the taste of it oh yeah I
[9:17] enjoyed the effect of
[9:20] it Hallelujah you know and it's it's
[9:23] amazing because you know it's not like
[9:26] Kool-Aid you're not drinking wine and
[9:28] then you know to get the effect that
[9:31] Kool-Aid would give you or some soda pop
[9:35] wine stimulates you that's right wine
[9:39] makes you love
[9:42] everybody and and and and listen here
[9:45] Solomon says listen it's better than
[9:49] your love is better than Wine in other
[9:51] words you stimulates me better than any
[9:55] wine I've ever
[9:57] tasted wait a minute cuz husband that's
[10:00] the way it's supposed to be
[10:03] amen oh Lord have mercy that was ouch
[10:06] wasn't it but it's the truth your wife
[10:09] is supposed to stimulate you more than
[10:11] anything in this
[10:13] world oh y'all got quiet on me you know
[10:18] the only
[10:19] way if you let the the wine supposed to
[10:22] get better as it
[10:25] age yes so anyway let's let's go on cuz
[10:29] I see right now amen that you know we
[10:32] we're not there yet and anyway Solomon
[10:36] says listen it's it's B listen and he
[10:39] and he goes on and and he says um uh uh
[10:44] let me read um it's better than love
[10:46] than and the smell of thy
[10:49] ointments than spices and I looked that
[10:52] up and you know that ointment means not
[10:54] only just fragrance but it's an
[10:57] anointing it is an an anointing that
[11:00] sisters are supposed to
[11:02] carry amen the way you carry yourself is
[11:06] it it it's just it is it it it
[11:08] stimulates me
[11:11] better than any perfume you can put
[11:15] on see it's not your perfume that gets
[11:18] me it's my love Hallelujah and that
[11:22] stimulation amen that's in
[11:26] there right so you look at this thing
[11:29] you said oh oh brother way but listen he
[11:32] said my
[11:34] sister my
[11:39] spouse you see because there was a time
[11:42] she was just a
[11:44] sister but once he became she became
[11:47] betrayed to him that sister became his
[11:55] wife

[35:14] die with that promise you'll live with
[35:15] it you can hold you can God never failed
[35:18] anybody God ever failed in here he's
[35:20] never
[35:21] failed I failed him thousands of times
[35:25] but he's never failed me once not once
[35:29] God has always been there for me
[35:32] Hallelujah is that all right he said the
[35:35] church has to be the word he is the word
[35:39] and the two units together and to do
[35:41] that it'll take the manifestation of the
[35:44] revealing of the son of man now remember
[35:47] I told you when I was preaching on the
[35:49] Statue of a perfect man Paul said there
[35:51] will come an
[35:54] entrance an abundance of entrance to us
[35:57] into that place place it couldn't have
[35:58] been in their time because the seven
[36:00] Church ages had not been completed so
[36:03] God through Paul uh Peter rather in
[36:06] Peter time amen tells us amen that
[36:09] listen add all these virtues Faith
[36:12] virtue knowledge add all of these he
[36:14] said and you'll not be Barren you won't
[36:17] be desolate bu you won't be desolate he
[36:20] said you'll not be bearen unfruitful
[36:22] neither will you fall or fail am right
[36:26] and he says there coming an end Rance
[36:28] and then the prophet of God said listen
[36:30] I didn't come Amen to to build a
[36:32] denomination or organization he said I
[36:35] came to give a a build a perfect
[36:38] man I got the quote he said I come Amen
[36:42] to bring a people to Perfection amen
[36:45] that was what Paul was talking about and
[36:47] you can't get there without
[36:52] thisall see because even in the world
[36:55] they think the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[36:56] is just just the ceiling of it all is
[36:59] finished but we came to find out it was
[37:01] just the
[37:04] beginning huh it's just the beginning of
[37:07] a of a of a supernatural work on the
[37:09] inside of you how you going to get there
[37:12] if you don't even get the
[37:17] beginning do you see what I mean if it's
[37:20] the son of man Jesus Christ will come
[37:22] down in human flesh Among Us and will
[37:24] make his word so real that it'll unite
[37:26] the church in him as one the bride and
[37:29] then she'll go home to the wedding
[37:31] supper and she's already United we'll go
[37:34] to the wedding supper not to the
[37:40] marriage the wedding supper comes
[37:43] afterwards the marriage happens here
[37:47] hallelujah W United times and time
[37:50] Hallelujah God comes along he said don't
[37:53] you worry about it you bu land amen you
[37:57] have
[37:58] Hallelujah it don't sound right to the
[37:59] English language or the English sound
[38:02] but it's a
[38:04] blessing that was G that was you in
[38:07] Jesus he said this is coming from
[38:09] proving his word he says God was in
[38:10] Christ reconciling the world to himself
[38:12] he was the beginning of creation his
[38:15] body was the the redeemed creation and
[38:17] now Through the Ages that church the
[38:19] church lost its first love did it do it
[38:22] it lost its first love and many of you

[1:01:53] showing out they want to be seen I'm
[1:01:55] really it's true I want to be seen by
[1:01:59] God huh I want to know I want God to say
[1:02:01] that there's somebody in there that
[1:02:03] don't care about what somebody else
[1:02:04] think about there's somebody in there
[1:02:06] that's enjoying this when I get to
[1:02:08] heaven like they said this is just a
[1:02:10] practice listen
[1:02:12] folks y'all I'm I'm I'm I should be 58
[1:02:15] in just little bit and if I was a young
[1:02:17] boy I don't think y'all could stand
[1:02:22] it I don't think you can stand it but
[1:02:25] nevertheless I do you know I look at
[1:02:27] things and I said people of God I don't
[1:02:28] understand I know it's not in all of
[1:02:30] that and this seemed like a Deja Vu
[1:02:31] right now but something is Chang in this
[1:02:35] church and I mean in a positive way
[1:02:38] since our brother from England came I
[1:02:41] could feel a
[1:02:43] difference and some of y'all weren't
[1:02:44] here maybe you didn't know about it but
[1:02:46] that brother came here who who's in a
[1:02:48] wheelchair you can't holl here what he
[1:02:49] say but he had an
[1:02:51] interpreter and he taught on the family
[1:02:53] and what the family the husband and wies
[1:02:55] ought to be doing loving each other and
[1:02:57] this and that I mean it was absolutely
[1:02:59] changing changed my life and I'm going
[1:03:03] to tell you something something took
[1:03:04] place in my life and I can feel it in
[1:03:06] the atmosphere as a positive I haven't
[1:03:08] had that feeling for a long while I was
[1:03:10] really getting a little discouraged
[1:03:11] because it felt like God was just
[1:03:13] displeased with this place something was
[1:03:16] going on and I don't know what it was
[1:03:18] but now it's going up again Hallelujah
[1:03:21] and I don't believe it's going to come
[1:03:22] down this time something is going to
[1:03:24] really happen this time and I I really
[1:03:26] believe that with all of my heart
[1:03:28] because I'm going to keep watching on it
[1:03:30] I'm going to keep prayer on it amen and
[1:03:32] and I'm going tell you I'm going say it
[1:03:34] like this there's a major change that's
[1:03:36] happening in our lives and and people
[1:03:38] let go and let God this is not a time to
[1:03:41] be concerned about nothing but your soul
[1:03:43] and your change your change I think
[1:03:45] about how people getting ready to go
[1:03:47] crazy if this this economy don't get
[1:03:49] right you going to see a lot of insane
[1:03:51] folks not just here in America all over
[1:03:54] the world and I was my I was telling
[1:03:56] somebody the other day I said let me
[1:03:58] tell you something we were talking I
[1:03:59] think it was Brother Rich and I you
[1:04:01] might have your guns you might have all
[1:04:03] your so-called protection but those who
[1:04:05] fight with the sword will die by The
[1:04:06] Sword and I can tell you like this amen
[1:04:09] if God said no murderers are going to
[1:04:11] enter in and he comes along and he tells
[1:04:13] you that if if your brother Smite you on
[1:04:15] the on the cheek you one side you turn
[1:04:17] to the right turn to the next right how
[1:04:20] many times you forgive your brother 70
[1:04:22] time
[1:04:23] seven only Divine love can do that amen
[1:04:26] only Divine love can conquer the Demons
[1:04:29] of this age y'all hear what I'm saying
[1:04:31] without Divine love you going to fail
[1:04:33] like

[1:04:41] that's what we need you better press
[1:04:43] into it that's all I can tell you I'm
[1:04:44] encouraging you you say well brother I'm
[1:04:47] having so many trials that's right those
[1:04:49] trials have come to let you know what
[1:04:50] you ain't got what you don't
[1:04:54] have and if you can look at and say okay
[1:04:56] I don't have this then I need to add and
[1:04:59] if you get before God and pray God I add
[1:05:01] it to you he said because if you got the
[1:05:03] life you don't add to it it adds to you

[1:06:25] and it cannot be
[1:06:32] changed he said my word my word shall
