TRANSCRIPT
========================================
you love the Lord amen we're just going to go right into the word of God As We Stand we mentioned on last uh Sunday I believe was a when our brother came by we were blessed amen by the grace of God so many ways we uh was going to minister on uh security and so tonight we would like to kind of uh start there uh and I trust by the grace of God it'll be a blessing to you so we're going to ask that you turn with us Amen to James 5 we then turn to Revelations 3:14 through 22 and then Revelation 6 back to Revelation James we're living in a time where uh things are becoming more difficult but you know the thing that I love about this message and what God has given to us is that the Covenant in which we have is unconditional we would be in a lot of trouble with God if our Salvation was based upon our works especially in Le oysa when there The Works of very few there was nothing that God could actually brag on about on lead Thea nothing I mean there was really nothing but thank God for his grace that he took us out of Lea and put us in an age that brother brandom acknowledged as the bride age the age in which we will come into a perfect State and I thank God for that it is a covenant that God made with us it's not that we made it with him he made it with us and I am grateful for that let us turn to uh Revelation James as I said five James 5 it'll be a little bit of reading here so I just just have patience with us tonight James 5 beginning at the first verse go to now ye rich men weep and how for your miseries that shall come upon you your riches are corrupt and your garments are moth eaten your gold and silver is cankered and the rust of them shall be a witness against you and shall eat your flesh as it were fire ye have heaped Treasures together for the last days behold the hor of the laborers who have we reaped down your fields which is of you kept back by fraud cth and the cries of them which have reaped are entered into the ears of the Lord of Sabbath ye have lived in pleasure on the earth and been wanting you have nourished your hearts as in a day of sleep slaugh you have condemned and killed the just and he doth not resist you be patient therefore Brethren unto the coming of the Lord behold the husbandman waited for the precious fruit of the earth and have long patience wait for it until you receive the early and latter rain so God is exalting the true seat of God to be ex uh patient and during this time because things are not going to happen the way you want them to be also patient establish your hearts for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh Grudge not one against another Brethren lest you be condemned behold the judge standeth before the door take my brethren the prophets who have spoken in the name of the Lord for an example of suffering afflictions and of patience behold we count them happy with endure which endure ye have heard of the patience of Job and have seen the end of the Lord that the Lord is very pitiful and tender Mercy is that okay amen let us turn by the grace of God now to Revelations 3:14 Revelations 3:14 and unto the angel of the Church of the leans write these things sayth the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God I Know Thy works that thou art neither cold nor hard I would that thou work cold or hot so then because Thou Art lukewarm neither cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my mouth because thou sayth I am rich this is where we're going with this and increase with goods and have need of nothing and knoweth not that thou art wretched miserable poor blind and naked I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich and white reignment that thou may be clothed that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with Isa that thou may see as many as I love I rebuke and chasten be zous therefore and repent behold I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice and open uh open the door thank you I will come into him and will s with him and he with me to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and sat down with my father in his throne he that have an ear let him hear what the spirit of spirit saith unto the churches one more scripture Revelation 6 I'm working with the thought security if I had a theme would be no Hiding Place Revelation 6 beginning at the 15th verse and the kings of the earth and the great men and the rich men and the chief captains and the Mighty Men And every bondman and every Freeman hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountain and said to the mountains and rocks fall on us and hide us from the face of him that sth on the throne and from the Wrath of the lamb for the great day of his wrath is come who shall be able to stand let us pray father God we come before you Lord as humbly as we know how we thank you for your grace and your mercy we thank you for just being so real to us Lord God I thank you right now for the service and I pray father God that you would bless the service in a special way that we might be able to hear and understand and receive of your word Lord we pray right now in your precious name Let Your Divine will be done in our lives in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated when I was in aine or in that way we had spoken with the individual and he was asking uh for uh a little uh counseling he wanted to to know what uh to do uh in light of what he felt God was calling him to do and the first thing I said to him I said brother this is what I did and this is what you have to do and I said when you do it correctly expect Satan to be angry and expect people not to understand I said I want you to go home or go somewhere and I want you to think about all of your [Music] priorities and I want you to list your priorities from one to whatever 10 and wherever God is I want you to put him as number one I said I want you to list all of your priorities and then I want you to go and wherever God is because you got to be honest in this in order for it to work I want you to be honest I said you put God one and now you got a place to work right now you have a place to work because I find out that in most Christian lives God is not number one now I told him this I said now I want you to understand what God did to his disciples Jesus Christ when he called them he made sure he was number one because he called for them to leave everything I mean they couldn't have no riches he pulled them away from their families and he basically said I'm your Shepherd follow me and for whatever reason he understood that those men had the ability to make him number one nobody struggled within that group about Jesus Christ being the number one man except for Judas I said think about it now you talking about giving God your allwe look what he required from his first set of disciples I said I'm not tell telling you to quit your job or anything like that but what I am telling you is that God requires to be number one in your life otherwise no matter what you do it won't be affected you will not be able to accomplish what you want to accomplish in God until he is number one all right outside of that you find out that if he's not number one everything that's above him has become an idol in your life you have chosen to worship that over Christ and I said you've got to get rid of all your Idols if you're not left with anything but Jesus Christ that's enough hello you take job for an example they accuse job and they said unto job the reason why the devil said the reason why job Ser serve you because you got a hedge about him Jesus Christ or God said not so I know the man job try him if you like do whatever you want to do but don't hurt the oil in the wine in other words don't take away the joy of the Lord from out of his heart concerning me because job proved to God that all the things that he saw whether it was his children that God had given him whether it was all of the wealth that God had given him he proved to all that was around him in spite of it all God was number one naked did I come into this world he said and naked I will return so he recognized and and that's the way it is that's why God even said to the disciples I mean not to just the disciples but he said to the children of Israel the first commandment love the Lord thy God with all of your heart with all of your mind with all of your soul is that right amen it's never changed amen it's never changed now I I'm saying all of these things because I believe that if we could all be honest with ourselves you can truly see for the most part he's not number one and he needs to be so all right now now we always talk about an unconditional Covenant but I want you to recognize the unconditional Covenant is given to Abraham's seed now all that claim to be Abraham's seed is not Abraham's seed true Israel are those who are born again amen hello somebody so the Covenant is given to those who are born again sealed with the Holy Ghost however you want to look at it that is the unconditional Covenant because God cannot curse himself hello listen we see there in the scripture and that's why I read those scriptures because I want you to understand that the spirit of uh of this age and and you know we look at Rich and increase with goods and have need of nothing that is the attitude that is now moving among the people of God and when we allow that Spirit to anoint us we're basically stepping out of our place of security hello the psalmist says hide me under th thy wings oh God see we need a hiding place from whom ourselves not just the devil we need a hiding place from ourselves now we looked and we said well brother BRS what are you saying I'm not saying that you and I can can't come short or do wrong after receiving the Holy Ghost because the Bible said grieve not the Holy Spirit whereby you were sealed to the day of your Redemption now come on somebody that is top notot security amen you can't get no secure than that Hallelujah come on somebody amen that you God knew even when he gave you the holy ghost that you would make mistakes am I was telling somebody just the other day I said remember brother branam being a great prophet of God was going to beat up a man he's got the Holy Ghost he's seen Miracles he's seen signs he's met the angel of the Lord he's seen the pillar of fire and God had to come back and said if you don't move when you see this event happened this other event you beating this man kicking him down the hill and all of these things for being disrespectful why am I saying this with all of that God in him he still had a potential that human element was still there and had not God intervened for him he would have made the headlines in a different way y y'all hear what I'm saying I'm saying all of this is that so that you won't you you might you may not so you won't misunderstand flesh is flesh and if God wouldn't protect us and keep us from a lot of things a lot of things we would be doing it is God who keeps he is The Keeper of the Soul Hallelujah now my thing is is that when we talking about a secured place let me put it this way what was the difference between Israel in Egypt can I can I tell you if you don't know what was the difference the word is between because in between Israel and Egypt was the blood the blood on the doorpost in the L hello somebody Israel was just as evil as they was going to be amen behind that blood but the blood protected them because amen what was God illustrating the flesh your flesh is going to be as evil as it ever been ain't nothing converted about your flesh come on somebody the only reason why God don't judge you according to the flesh is because of the blood oh y'all to be happy tonight Israel was under the law this flesh amen came can't even be governed by the law but it is the blood of Jesus Christ that protects God from attacking you I don't know no other ways even the prophet of God had that had to be revealed to him remember the woman amen with the purple hair and the purple fingernails and toenails and everything else that were purple and here she was amen who had been in a state of mind amen she was so bad actually and I believe if I got it right she was a preacher's wife am I correct Brothers Preacher's Daughter okay somewhere in there but my point is I knew that there was a relationship and she backslid and she was in a place Satan had taken her into such a dark place wherein that she thought she couldn't be saved because she had done so many bad things hello but what she failed to see the reason why a great judgment had not come to her even in her backsliding sliding state was the blood of Jesus see because once a Christian is always a Christian if it's real yes amen y'all hear what I'm saying that Old Devil I have you all beat down like you can't do nothing you done send away your day of grace and the blood of Jesus Christ is still protecting you amen thank you talk about security this lady didn't even know what was in the Assurance package and it took a prophet to come by and read her what was in the small print amen God every for giving up given up on you you may have G given up on God but I just talk to him and he told me you was his daughter Hallelujah hello the Bible say God loves the backslider amen that's why I I in prayer we we we prayed that God would bring back the backsliders amen those who of us who was there we pray that God would bring back the backsliders that somehow God will reveal to them that he still loves them it's a good place a place of security see my thing is this you can have all the wealth in the world you can have the greatest or the highest or prestigious job but that means nothing cuz they're dying up there too you know everybody have their dreams and their plans about in this life come on first of all as a Christian you've got no business dreaming because when you come into God you gave it up am at least that's what you're supposed to do huh you supposed to surrender your whole entire life to God and be led by God you got no business planning without God's permission amen can I get a witness y'all hear what I'm saying when we began to start uh looking and and and our leadership began uh we become our our own leader then you're in trouble amen because as a Christian you surrender your headship to whom Jesus Christ himself and every time you get into this leadership thing Satan is going to cause you to shipwreck and don't you blame God hello whatsoever you do in word or do deed do it all in the name of the Lord Jesus then you're saved amen come on somebody I'm so glad that God knows how to chastise us I'm so glad he knows how to break a leg or two y'all don't like that any but I'm telling you if I get out of the way so much I want to break my leg bring me back God loves us he does he loves us and you know we we we're we're blessed to have such a god Psalms 32 and7 says Thou Art my Hiding Place thou shal preserve me from trouble thou shall Compass me about with songs of Deliverance say so if he going to Encompass me about with songs of Deliverance doesn't mean he he's not going to let me get into a place that I need Deliverance what would I need Deliverance songs for if God is not going to allow me to get into a place where I need Deliverance but look what the Bible said he's preserving my soul even when I need Deliverance amen somebody ought to shout in here now I'm enjoying myself because I want you to realize this Sal ation that we have is secure there there there there's no fine prints where where there are conditions I must meet because he met all the conditions amen Jesus Christ oh I'm coming by the grace of God just hold fast the Bible says according to Psalms 1194 114 Thou Art my Hiding Place and my shield I hope in in thy word let me put it this way if he is my shield that means I must be hiding behind him or in him however you want to look at it but in other words he is between me and my troubles am yes sir and my shield is so big I can hide in it the devil say look what you just did I'm like what are you talking about what did I just do you said what brother W Brooks I don't know about that let me put it this way brother brandham said the brother the bride never sin in the first place amen now my point is what you going to believe are we going to allow Satan to just keep bombarding us come on sir when you stand secure you stand secure you're on the Rock come on I can preach to you like this cuz I I've been there many times come on where we let when we know we've been warn we allow our emotions to rise above the word hello somebody can I get an amen my point is this amen we allow our our emotions to get above the word when the word has declared us sinless amen or without sin and we are looking at our state when we make mistakes and we think oh my it's awful and it is but once you acknowledge it you spring back up Hallelujah to where you're supposed to be amen hello that's right now my point is this because that's how you please God can I say this the scripture said a just man falls seven times in a day how many times did you fall today y'all hear what I'm saying come on but the Bible said what the great thing about the just man is he getes up amen it's not the fall because why would the Bible put it there if he knew you would never fall amen come on why would the Bible put it there but he said the just man not only does he fall he gets up amen that's What Makes You righteous that's what makes you just having the ability to say I am sorry Lord forgive me and let me tell you something there have been times in my life I sound like a a broken record Lord forgive me Lord forgive me Lord forgive me Lord forgive me I mean in one day I it's the truth I think God trying to bring some peace and joy to your heart if you let him you know and and it's true we say well I'm not a Catholic but we feel like it sometimes we feel like we know the word and after God has made right with us or we made right with word we got to show the sad like countenance to make him know that we're sad I don't think so I think when the high priest got behind that curtain and he realized what do you think all of that incense and stuff for all that was was confessing sin all that was was confessing sins and say God we're wrong and you're right and we haven't hidden anything before us we are making it known to you that we need you as our hiding place now every one of us that will be legalistic about things don't don't you understand let me put it this way the harder you are on others will be the heart of your judgment will be on you where Mercy is given amen Mercy is obtained when Grace is given Grace is obtained am Hallelujah he said unto the Pharisees and the Sadducees you know what he said he said you left off the weight of of things you did all the The Works you did all these things he said but the thing you left off which was greater to me was mercy and Truth amen what truth are you talking about let him that is without sin cast the first stone are you being blessed tonight let's move on you said a shield yes a shield that God can hide his people in it but listen look what happens to those who are not in Christ the Bible said they ran into the cave they ran into the mountains rocks fall on us how hide us from the face of him who SATs on the throne we're not saying that we're the ones who saying Lord reveal it show me your face I want to see you face to face why because we realize that this is where this is our hope this is where our faith lay amen oh I love this scripture Isaiah 32 and2 a man shall be as a hiding place from the wind and a covered from The Tempest as rivers of water in dry places as the shadow of a great rock in a weary land now what man you think he talking about there is number one man that becomes a hiding place Paul said our lives are HID where in Christ Jesus woo you say what do you mean I'm going to tell you something before Jesus Christ when Jesus Christ had the scripture said death was swallowed up amen death was swallowed up and let me tell you something if you in him death has been swallowed up your sins have been swallowed up everything about you have been swallowed up am I making sense he's the one God that can neutralize everything he yes and because we're in him God sees no sin amen don't get me wrong shall we continue in sin that Grace May abound God forbid every time we do wrong we supposed to ask God for in a sincere way to not only forgive us but cleanse us and let me put it this way brother Brandon when he lied Amen to that insurance man or when they came by says uh honey tell him I'm not at home y'all remember that story the Bible said that I mean brother Brown said when he got and he got to himself he went up and he prayed for so many hours Lord whatever you do don't let me do this again over a lie he sought God in such a sincere way over a lie he did not ever want to do that again how many of us do that see what I'm saying it's always in prayer amen repentance and and and sincerity it comes in prayer that's why the devil blocks that door when you know you need to pray he blocks it and you know how he blocks it he takes away feelings because you don't feel him you don't feel like you praying Hallelujah and you don't feel him so you don't pray what's to use he got you he got you cuz God is not a god of feelings amen he's a god of Faith Hallelujah and when ha can get you on your feelings I don't he I don't feel like he's hearing me I don't feel like my prayers going to the ceiling not even up there maybe you know I mean he's got you when can you feel your prayers I've never felt my prayers I've felt the Holy Spirit but I've never felt my prayers huh huh and let me tell you something many times listen last night I was here praying and I think I started snoring a little bit and God get I caught myself Lord Jesus thank you thank you thank you because I'm glad I didn't go into the third level but nevertheless I caught myself snoring and I began to thank God for it why because he awakened me he knew my sincere desire was to pray I came tired I struggled but I didn't feel him but I knew he was there and when you don't feel him don't you ever quit I don't care if you got to go an hour and two however long you pour your heart out to God because I want you to understand those Pharisees and I'm Excuse me those those priests do you really think they were feeling much everything had become a a ritual that's one thing I love about the Muslims I don't know what they what they feel but every whatever time of the day they are bow down before God in the streets no matter where they are they pre I wonder what they're feeling but they're so into that ritual they they there they're there under all of that unbelief but yet and still in their eyes they're praying to the almighty God and they Faith but it's so sad because they are of a a religion without salvation faithful and so a lot of these denominational churches religious plenty of it but have no salvation and like the brother brought out the other day there's a difference between saved and Redemption you can be saved amen by giving somebody a drink of water in the name of the Lord but because you're saved doesn't mean you came from God amen amen hallelujah but Redemption means I was there with him I came to buy back that which is mine Hallelujah so I'm not just saved I'm redeemed y'all hear what I'm saying I'm redeemed are you redeemed tonight Hallelujah a man as a hiding place he got it right on the head there I'm telling you ain't God good to us security I looked up that word it means free from risk or danger safety free from doubt anxiety fear see when you secure you don't have those things going on in you hello if you really believe the word and you know it's true what is the anxiety about what is the doubt about like I said there in accurity until you and I come to a place and you recognize that this word is God not a part of him it is God God and His word is and this word must be elevated above your thoughts your desires and everything else it must rule your life all of our Lives is is a constant dying out a constant fighting if you ever think your flesh going to give you a rest you are deceived The Devil Ride That Donkey every day I want to say mule it ain't no donkey it's a mule something that gives an assurance brother Brandon call it Blessed Assurance the state of being secure a person or a thing that's secure guaranteed is it guaranteed the B say guarant you hear the world say guaranteed of your money back guaranteed to work where do you think they get that from if they shall lay hands on the sick and they they shall what guaranteed the work amen uh is that right the Bible said if you're sick call for the Elders of the church is that right if they shall lay hands on the sick they what shall recover guaranteed I if you work in faith is guaranteed now the truth of the matter is you know how brother bandam preached a trial it comes when God wants it to you can't get put an element or time element on what God going to do when he's getting ready to fix it you can't hurry God let that song say you just got to wait gold tried in the fire how you going to be gold if there ain't no fire amen trying you a lot of times the devil allow things to come on you or to come back on you just to see how bad you want it amen amen I know what I'm talking about because I'm talking from experience how bad do you want it am how bad do you want God at a time like this how bad do you want God at a time like this now I'm preaching to myself how bad y'all don't know what I go through y'all don't have no idea and don't go talking to my wife either but my point is this we all have something that we're weak to am I only one is there anything come on somebody listen brother brandham he he had this this issue with him it was a sickness he had it you know did you know that brother brand said he had a thing about exaggerating and he can't he could not determine numbers so if it was 400 he might say a little more than that because he could because he could discern you know he didn't but he had a way of that's a man oh y'all y'all looking at me like I'm crazy but that's a man how many of y'all have told told uh have have told the same story over and over again exactly if you didn't somewhere you exaggerated thank God for the grace of God Amen so I'm I'm I'm just just just so you can understand understand what I'm saying now when we look at this thing you know we talking about um we look at security and you know it just makes me sick sometime you know me and my computer if I could give him a couple of punches he probably punch me back but but my point is you know I'm such an innocent I I say like this when it come to computers I'm not smart I I just do the minimum and I still have trouble sometime they they come and advertise stuff and I'm thinking it's something I need and I already got it you know but my point is a lot of time we think things are secure even on your computers oh if I put it on my computer I got it secure but now they try to tell you it's not secure so have a backup system but even your backup system is not secure because now we know that we've got these computer geeks that can get into those systems and know all your business so in man's world there is no security oh I I've got a job and I'm secure on my job no you're not don't ever think that you're secure on a job because things can change overnight and there have been times where whole companies had to close and shut down overnight and people thought they were secure huh listen folks we're not guaranteed The Next Breath of Life we could all die right now there is no security in this man thing here hello oh the rich man thought he was Secure just the only thing he did he just come up he lived a wonderful life he had his bonds and stuff built and things like that he he just looked really good and it didn't look sinful no but what it was is that God was not his number one he literally built his whole life around his career and he thought he was Secure in his career and God said but you're foolish you didn't make preparation you made preparations to live in this Earth but you did not make preparations to die and all of us I don't care how important your this worldly life may seem to be to you you better make sure you have made right preparation because every one of us going to either die or make a translation hello and what we see tomorrow or I see you tomorrow if the Lord's will because you don't know whether you're going to see tomorrow secure means to be freedom from financial care I wonder what's going to happen to all those secured people when the stock market crash and you what so gets me people said I'm going to get me some gold I mean the dollar going to go and I buy me some gold hello there's no security in that because listen the mark the Beast said you're not going to buyself no matter how much gold you got amen except you receive the Mark I don't care if you got for knocks as an inheritance you won't be able to spend one bar one piece of gold on a loaf for bread when that system claps down so where would your security be it must be in God and if it's not in God you're in trouble amen because everybody that's not found in God goes where out of Darkness now what happens when you really what what happens you ever seen a rich man he got he he know he's secure look at him look at him he walks all proud and head all up he there's an air about him there is a Heir about the man he can't help it he feels secure when he's not what about a Believer there ought to be an air about you amen when you know that you know that you know amen that you're saved not only save but your bride material Hallelujah there ought to be an heir about you amen one of the worst things you can see I remember going down to the farmers's market and every time I went down to the farmers market would see these Pentecostal people they always look like they just ate lime or some lemon fruit they look like the saddest Bunch down there had long hair and long dresses and a long face to go with it and I thought to myself there ain't nothing Glory about ain't nothing happy about why would I even inquire about what you believe see that us not become that amen like I said I uh uh this lady was saying waiting on me and she said oh you know you every time I look you just look so happy and and I didn't know that I mean I had a man at the come and go said oh man you always looking like you're so happy about things then I'm thinking I didn't know that you know but the thing is I got Jesus on my mind I got a song I got something going on on the inside didn't even know it was showing on the outside but other people can see that even in the barber shop when I went to the barber today I had a really lot of things on my mind and what was on my mind was their discussion the the barber man said you are right you seem to be quiet I said yeah I just got a lot on my mind it was horrible but you know the thing about it is you look at things and you think Lord what's going to happen to these people my heart goes out because I tried to even witness at the barber shop and got shut down now they act like I ain't never told them I was a preacher they do what all they going to do come on somebody even the Muslim guy and I'm think I know I talk to y'all but they don't care Darkness don't care they don't care one of the guys's wife was a Apostolic and he divorced her oh God have mercy Jesus Psalms 5:11 I hope this is okay are you being blessed tonight but let all those that put their trust in thee Rejoice let them ever Never Shout for Joy because thou defend them is that the message Amen brother bam said God defends us he said he's the jury he's the judge he's the attorney amen he said he's everything amen God defends usen and the Bible said that he found what no charge no charge am I take the [Music] verdict we wouldn't have known that except God sent us a messag amen so why are you judging yourself and putting such a harsh verdict on yourself I can say that cuz I've been there bro been there more than once and my whole thing is to encourage everybody in here who the devil amen has got in their minds negative stuff we all need one another hello listen I can beat you up right now I could I can take that same message and come down with a a but that ain't the way God leading me I could bring it down I can make it make you feel so bad amen all y'all are run to this altar you've never seen me there but I can go there but what good is it going to do if I stir your emotions and not get to your heart the Bible said the goodness of the Lord lead men to repentance the goodness showing how good he is how good he is and have been and will be to all of those who trust in him he's going to defend you I thank God he defends me cuz sometime I don't even defend myself hello y'all believe that anybody in here that needs to know right from wrong anybody we get confused with that I think all of us know but I can tell you how to make it more righteous than wrong you know what I find out that even even in love relationships there's so time so many times people have been so abused and they've abused themselves so much till they can't get a comfort from God until they feel like they he's abusing that's not the way God is hello God is not a negative God he's positive amen when you negative he's trying to make you positive Gideon you are a mighty man ofila not me yes you amen right Samson I'm gonna give you one more chance hello oh Lord once more okay I'm going give it to you Samson amen right amen amen that's the way God is woman at the well of the woman caught in adultery huh he defended her he protected her and she was guilty but he knew who she was on the inside that she needed some space hello and when he did see that he threw out a question among the audience and say let him without sin cast the first stone and the Bible said they dropped their rocks and they walked away I don't know maybe that like I was telling somebody that's a lot of people say all you do is preach Grace let me ask you something what is the message amen a message of what all right then amen All You Preach is Grace brother W that's all that's all I know because that's all I [Music] needl and I don't know about you I'm glad he said give me a double portion Grace Grace I need it anybody in here know what I'm talking about I've been there myself I've come to a place and think oh you're just a hypocrite how come you doing what you doing you look at you who talking that that's the devil but he talks in your voice and make you think that's you right I was just thinking about that the other day I said the devil knows we cannot he cannot curse us but he put those negative thoughts in our minds you know what he said he said to me the other day he said oh you ain't no Christian yeah the devil told me that and I paused for a moment I said you ain't getting me to say that that's what I said you not getting me to say that cuz brother said when you make a confession like that you got to start over you just took yourself out of a position of being a Christian y'all didn't know that look it up you are your confessions huh come on somebody tell me amen right if my relationship is connected in that way God will tell me when the enemies are coming a far off Amen in God I will praise His word excuse me in God I have put my trust I will not fear what flesh can do unto meoo it didn't even say man's flesh it said flesh cuz I can be your flesh I will not fear what this flesh can do to me amen one of these old days that old flesh going to ride up if the Lord carry how you going to get up out of that situation you better have some trust amen you better have some trust in God come on somebody that's the only thing that's going to get you up out of the Grave if you're not secure how you going to go down insecure and come up secure you can every one of those Old Testament Saints died in faith in what invisible things things that they couldn't even see nor understand but they trusted The God Who told them about it trust in the Lord at all times ye people pour out your heart before him God is your Refuge amen huh he is the place should run to in times of trouble he will hide me come on somebody now listen I wish I wish God would just allow let me say it like this I don't know why and we all do it we fail to see we're in a battle we're not wrestling against flesh and blood we're rasing against spiritual wickedness in high places right and you know we all forget right we fail to see the enemy because we don't see him but he's there fighting us he knows the stand we're taking and he's going to do any and everything else to bring us down from that stand right listen let me put it this way how do you know or how do you let me put this where every test and trial you go through do you know that the devil had to go before God and said let me try let me ask you a question then do you think job at any time didn't want healing of course he did but the more you he inquired and probably hoped the balls got worse not knowing his integrity was being tested the trials were coming worse and worse and like what's going on huh and God will move himself back just to see okay the devil says well see I I I I can I can get her to do whatever and and she going to leave and this and that and and God says no no no no no amen no because I realized that this individual love me unconditionally it ain't how good I do for them and how I bless them but they love me they've experienced that they they're at a place of no return anybody know what I'm talking about and I hope the con brother Conley and sister Vanda don't mind me using them but uh and I'm not trying to embarrass them but if I've ever seen faith exemplified I really have seen it in those two and you know and and I look at sister Vanda and how she comes and she's fought and she's fought and she's fought and she's fought and every time she can put herself in this church she's here amen how many of us and you can't tell me that sister wasn't feeling a real sick at times and she sit right up there the best she could wanting to hear the word she couldn't do that on her own that is not a natural thing that is super Supernatural and God shows us these things and I think a lot of us we look at her and we pity her but that ain't pity that's faith on both of their parts faith and we looking at y'all don't see what God is doing God builds rapturing Faith by situations like that because if he if you can believe God when he's not healed you like you want him to you can still hold fast to a Rapture amen that's rapture in faith people that's a building of character am loving God unconditionally believing him when you can't see it with your eyes I don't see how God going to change me but I believe it with all my heart and the closer I get to the Rapture the more wicked this thing becomes but there's something on the inside of this inside that can never be ever changed when it comes to God because it's secured am Hallelujah in secured people that old preacher got tired of preaching told Brother brand I'm not preaching no more I'm quitting I'm backsliding he said no BR got his name you don't mean that yes I do D died a drunken God he drank and God took his life y'all know what I'm talking about what did Brother ad say he was saved hello save people he said all God did was spanking he wouldn't do right he wouldn't try to make it right he didn't he wouldn't repent so God just put him to sleep a lot of us would have say you know he gone to Hell see but we don't understand a security is a security and when God stamp secure on it amen no man can break it amen y your your your behavior can never break the seal that's why he said grieve not the Holy Ghost hallu ain't God good talk about of security listen I've got a hiding place hallelujah hallelujah I got a hiding place what could you trust men of old trust that they thought Egypt was the greatest of all kingdoms where is Egypt now y'all hear what I'm saying when they in Babylon thought Babylon was the greatest Empire on the world and it would never fall fell overnight come on somebody what about Rome who thought they would be they were the Invincible Kingdom of all times and would never go down men put their trust in that Empire what about Germany who was raising up to be a great nation and they thought they were secure too h if Rome had only heard the Centurion when he said truly this is the Son of God hallelujah they would have recognized there was a greater Kingdom something to put more trust in in the Roman Empire is that right if they had heard the decree of of Nebuchadnezzar amen he said therefore I make a decree that every people Nation language which speak anything am against the god of Shadrach Meshach and they go shall be cut in pieces and their houses shall be made a dung Hill because there is no other God that can deliver after this s if they had heard that they would have recognized there was a greater Kingdom than Babylon amen people of God Amen you think about it what about America people still even in this message they have so much Security in this people got Security in religion I'm secure in My Religion I'm a Baptist I'm a Methodist I'm a presbyterian I'm a Catholic I'm message that don't mean a heal of be it's whether you've been sealed come on somebody that's where the security there if you got the Holy Ghost then you are secure not by Your Hands by his hand brother bam said it like this he said think that we accept God he said God accept us he approves Us by giving us the Holy Ghost and when he gives you the Holy Ghost he gives you a staff of approval he seals you away until the day of your Redemption nothing can break that that's what gets me sometime people think they Doctrine Sav you your Doctrine don't save you election amen election Sav you said well brother books I don't know about all that well let me put it this way how many of y'all believe that Solomon went to hell no Solomon didn't go no hell he died in idolatry what saved Solomon election he served his purpose he did everything God really wanted him to do oh come on somebody that's what he told told Brother brandham in that message as I was with Moses he said to Moses he brother said God never looked at Moses mistakes he looked at the commission God never looked at William Brown mistakes he looked at the commission God never looks at your mistakes he looks at your commission that's all he does did you do what he asked you to do have you done what he told you to do that's where it's at we all make mistakes maybe some of y'all don't but all of us that call we we do is that okay who can we trust one more scripture Proverbs 3 there's only one place to trust only one God to trust only one place of security and I you know I I just this thought just come to me I was listening and something on the radio I forgot what it was but I thought to myself I said man there ain't no security and nothing you know people it's the truth right I mean so many people who got you know they married each other for security Now love security that's what they do nowaday you got a big buck and I got a big buck we make these big bucks one Buck but that don't work hello let me tell you something that the only thing that can keep a marriage together right now is divine love huh oh I tell you what in these days you better have something something like they say that's the only thing that's going to keep you is love true love oh come on somebody and love don't mean that it Ain it you know like I heard you know love means that you can endure your fighting your disagreeing you can you can you can go on all away in spite of your differences huh oh come on somebody if you God gave you somebody just like yourself why would you need love huh God got to give you something that's opposite huh you punctual and they're not you're a perfectionist and they're not I wish I can think some more scenarios but I can't but my point here the opposite the opposite to one another and that's what makes it work I know some folks that just alike and I'm telling you a couple as a couple and they fight all the time huh both of them got stubborn spirits and they fight all the time I had to preach on Zora for them to have peace to let them know God put you together you just going to have to fight to one y'all chip each other up to death till all them things come off God going to keep y'all going at each other Proverbs 3 amen you know the Lord we bless people I want you to understand amen that uh how can I say it I thought about this thing I said Lord you know what why didn't Jehovah Eagle come looking for us brother B tells that story he said it was the mother had laid eggs the mother Eagle laid eggs and went looking for her eass think about it you know why because mother has a love mother has a love that Papa y'all Papas we love them but we can't express like Mama and mama was going to find those Eagles regardless of where they were and the first thing she did to that eagle cuz she knew the condition of that eaglet he was just mentally messed up been around them chickens all day all that all that time confused about what he was you know oh she could have she could have said well you should have known better you looked in the mirror lately can't you tell you don't look the same I mean she could have been in a negative way but she didn't she encouraged them flap your wings you have the ability to fly we are the same bird amen and that's what the Holy Ghost come to do make you recognize we are the same Birds we're all Eagles Hallelujah and every one of us has the ability to fly Like Jesus amen amen amen we are of him amen and he is of us amen oh my Proverbs 3 5 through 7 trust in the Lord with all thine heart lean not unto thine own understanding and all thy ways acknowledge Him and He Shall direct thy path be not wise in thy own eyes fear the lord and depart from evil secure security and that's where we fall short we lack fear we like reverence we forget we are encompassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses every time we do wrong there's always a witness even in the spiritual real hello somebody it's true my thing is God grace and mercy has and I'm going to tell you something this is a secret it may not sound like a secret but this is what it is the Bible says if you love me you'll keep my command hello we must learn when we fall short all of us we must say Lord increase my love for you increase my love for you may my love for you go greater than the love for myself or for anyone else you must be number one in my life you love the Lord
