[42:30] um living in a time like these this we
[42:34] need his
[42:35] grace judges 16 and
[42:42] 28 you know we've been dealing with
[42:44] Samson last time we spoke on Samson we
[42:47] dealt with the Jawbone of an ass and I
[42:50] don't know whether you fully understood
[42:53] what I was trying to say but I trust by
[42:56] God's grace he
[42:57] gave you the revelation of what was
[42:59] saying what God was saying and one thing
[43:01] I do know that we're looking for a
[43:03] refreshing we know that there is a final
[43:06] outpouring of the Holy Spirit uh it
[43:08] won't be uh that kind of a spirit that
[43:11] will make you jump and Shout but it will
[43:14] surely give you
[43:16] Victory amen because that's what we're
[43:18] working with now we are those who will
[43:22] conquer in Satan's Eden 16:28
[43:27] and Samson called unto the Lord and said
[43:30] oh Lord remember me that's where I got
[43:35] my subject from I pray thee and
[43:38] strengthen me I pray thee only this once
[43:43] oh God that I may be at at one once
[43:48] Avenged of the Philistines for my two
[43:51] eyes let us
[43:53] pray father God we come before you Lord
[43:56] as humbly as we know how and we thank
[43:58] you for your grace and your mercy we
[44:01] thank you for being so good to us we
[44:04] pray father God that you would have
[44:05] preeminence tonight and we'll be careful
[44:08] to give you the praise Glory and Honor
[44:10] in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you
[44:13] may be
[44:14] seated you have heard me say many many
[44:17] many
[44:19] times uh and that message has always
[44:21] stuck out to the oh Lord once more oh
[44:25] Lord just once more
[44:28] uh that the prophet of God preached in
[44:30] 1963 and it was after the
[44:33] seals and uh you and I know that at that
[44:36] time uh most of the churches had already
[44:40] uh uh
[44:41] disfellowshipped uh themselves with him
[44:44] uh uh basically because of his teachings
[44:47] and his Doctrine and of course they had
[44:50] no idea that they were literally
[44:51] fulfilling Revelations 3 where Jesus
[44:55] Christ would be outside of the church
[44:57] knocking at the
[44:59] door because what they did not realize
[45:02] that was that that not that brother
[45:04] Brandon was Jesus Christ but uh he
[45:07] carried the message of Jesus Christ and
[45:10] he was uh the veil of the coming of the
[45:13] Lord and they don't understand that or
[45:16] the peering of the Lord however you like
[45:17] to say that uh but we understand by
[45:20] God's grace that there was a message
[45:23] left for us uh when everybody else
[45:27] rejected it uh there was a Remnant that
[45:31] God had
[45:32] predestined uh to hear that word and
[45:35] Obey it one thing about the word of God
[45:39] it is also a word of Prophecy when God
[45:42] write things uh for example when we look
[45:45] in the Old Testament many of the Old
[45:47] Testament stories that we have listened
[45:51] to and read throughout the years uh were
[45:54] types and shadows of future
[45:57] events uh you take the story of Esther
[46:01] uh when it uh took place it was the the
[46:05] the the type of what God had in his mind
[46:08] to do for his bride uh when you look at
[46:12] Ruth uh The Book of Ruth we we think
[46:15] it's a just a little story or allegory
[46:18] of some type but we realize by God's
[46:20] grace that there was a depth to that uh
[46:23] story it was actually God Amen shadowing
[46:26] entire typing uh the story of redemption
[46:29] for the Gentiles as well as the Jews and
[46:33] so we look at these things and we find
[46:35] out that God has always hid himself in
[46:39] Simplicity and of course we would have
[46:41] never known these things had not God
[46:43] sent a prophet that that he used to
[46:47] unlock the scriptures to us uh by way of
[46:51] of Shadows and tipes and so when we talk
[46:55] about Samson and we talk about the uh
[46:59] Shadow and type and this is why we've
[47:00] been really working in Shadow uh Samson
[47:03] because in the day of Samson as you
[47:05] heard me say in the previous lessons
[47:08] that Samson amen typed out a time when
[47:13] everybody thought that they were right
[47:15] in their own eyes uh the prophet had
[47:17] gone off the scene and Joshua had now
[47:20] gone on and there was a generation that
[47:23] stood with Joshua ministry as well as
[47:25] Moses Ministry but then there came
[47:27] another group of people uh that really
[47:30] strayed away from the word and and in
[47:32] other words they became blinded uh
[47:35] because they didn't stay on on track
[47:37] they didn't stay with the word but and
[47:38] then during that time Satan was bringing
[47:41] in his deception and everybody thought
[47:43] that they were right in their own eyes
[47:46] and if you look at those judges you'll
[47:48] find out that the the people who were
[47:50] blood rated were the ones who were
[47:51] fighting each other it was Israel that
[47:54] had been so divided but they were
[47:56] fighting one another Judah and all the
[47:57] others amen trying to see who was going
[48:00] to have preeminence one o over the other
[48:03] and if we could look at those shadows
[48:04] and type we find out it's the same today
[48:07] everybody's trying to find out who's
[48:09] going to have preeminence I believe it
[48:12] was at a time when Jesus was on Earth
[48:14] his disciples asked the same question
[48:17] who would be the greatest Among Us and
[48:19] Jesus said unto them this is the this is
[48:21] the way that the Gentiles teach this is
[48:23] what they teach but I tell you the
[48:26] greatest among is the least of all and
[48:28] so we look at these things and we say oh
[48:30] my God have mercy on us this is what I'm
[48:33] talking about in all of this chaos and
[48:35] all of the Chao chaos that is going in
[48:38] on in the spiritual realm and the
[48:40] political realm and the social
[48:43] realm billions or millions of people on
[48:47] earth I had to come ask the question
[48:50] then who am I and where do I fit in
[48:54] where is my place
[48:57] of refuge and many of us know our refuge
[49:01] is in
[49:02] Christ but we need to know by God's
[49:06] grace the the condition of the
[49:08] church we know that the condition of the
[49:11] church is in bad shape so when we look
[49:13] at Samson we think it cannot be the
[49:15] bride this can't be the bride but I got
[49:18] news for you it is because you got to
[49:21] realize that Leia the sea is already
[49:23] dead she's been tried wanting and she
[49:26] she's in a position that she thinks
[49:28] she's living and she's dead and she
[49:30] don't even know it but we want us
[49:33] ourselves when we come to see we need to
[49:36] know what about our day and where do we
[49:42] stand and in order to understand that or
[49:45] order to answer that question you got to
[49:46] see what condition the church is
[49:50] in because it's in the Bible and Solomon
[49:53] said there's no new thing under the sun
[49:55] somewhere we're there
[49:57] whether we are that church on fire or
[49:59] whether we're that church that's cold
[50:01] and dead or whether we there in Le sea
[50:04] which is lukew but we're there coming
[50:07] from a little quote amen I want to read
[50:09] by God's grace from oh Lord just once
[50:12] more brother Bron began to tell us that
[50:14] where we are and what I'm working with
[50:16] the United States now because I can't
[50:18] deal with the whole country I got to
[50:19] work here he says we are living off the
[50:22] tax money that will be paid in 40 years
[50:25] from today the nation is broke where is
[50:29] it at who has got the money we haven't
[50:33] got it our bonds are no good we've got
[50:37] to have gold and who's got it he says
[50:40] the Catholic Church what will they do
[50:43] before these whiskey men and all of
[50:46] these great holders and stockholders
[50:48] will ever give it up they will
[50:51] absolutely sell out and the church WIll
[50:54] loan the nation
[50:56] the money and what will it do it'll sell
[51:01] its
[51:02] Birthright now we just read in the in
[51:04] the paper or the YouTube where all of
[51:07] these great companies businesses of the
[51:10] United States has already made a
[51:13] covenant with the
[51:15] Pope y'all understand me you can say
[51:18] amen and these things have already been
[51:20] prophesied that they would
[51:23] happen and so brother B goes on to say
[51:26] but what we're doing is we're selling
[51:28] our
[51:30] Birthright and what will they do it will
[51:32] sell their Birthright straight into
[51:34] Catholicism and I'm going to bring that
[51:36] out in the scripture in just a moment
[51:38] then what are we going to do that's the
[51:41] gold of the world them and the Jews and
[51:44] that's the Covenant that he'll make with
[51:46] Israel see you Bible readers can teach
[51:49] that in your church you see I'm just
[51:52] showing you I believe the same thing
[51:56] that's how it will have to come to pass
[51:59] and we've got it right there now and
[52:02] here we are organizations with the mark
[52:05] of the beast upon us just exactly like
[52:08] the first Beast an image unto it a
[52:11] Federation of churches joining a power
[52:14] and they made an image unto the Beast
[52:17] that he could both speak and it and and
[52:20] it done the same thing the first Beast
[52:24] did before it right in our clutches oh
[52:27] children what time is it is there a
[52:30] possibility Samson stood there and said
[52:34] now he bringing samsons into
[52:37] it he's in the midst of all of the chaos
[52:41] and all of the Unions that's going on
[52:44] and and we have got to be blind as a bat
[52:46] if we don't know that our country is
[52:48] changing from
[52:50] democracy into what a system called the
[52:53] one world order it is and it must
[52:56] happened but before they could actually
[52:59] do this thing they must break the back
[53:01] of
[53:02] America because amen uh uh we were uh
[53:06] head in econom in the economic realm and
[53:09] that must be broken because in this
[53:12] system they're trying to bring an
[53:16] equality of course that will never
[53:19] happen until we see
[53:24] Jesus now he says what time is is there
[53:27] a possibility Samson stood there and
[53:30] said what time just is there a
[53:33] possibility Samson happened to think
[53:37] that great God he's omnipotent he is
[53:40] Everlasting God I see my mistakes I'm
[53:43] going to repent and he cried out now
[53:47] understand this now if this is a shadow
[53:49] and a type of the Bride you see that's
[53:51] what people don't people don't
[53:52] understand brother Brown said that the
[53:54] Rev bride has not had her Revival yet
[53:57] now Revival is getting the trash out of
[53:59] your life and I want you to understand
[54:02] the story of Samson he was lured and
[54:05] woed into a
[54:08] a a condition where that find where he
[54:12] found himself Amen in a place of
[54:17] mockery hallelujah amen now I want you
[54:20] to follow the the the steps of this
[54:23] message this message amen was when it
[54:26] came when God began to break it was like
[54:28] Samson there was no enemy there was
[54:31] nothing that could defeat him the
[54:33] Philistines couldn't defeat
[54:36] him every battle he fought even in
[54:38] Chicago he defeated it was a spirit of
[54:42] Samson on the prophet of God now Samson
[54:46] represents the
[54:48] bride right and God is now coming to a
[54:52] place because am mean what has happened
[54:55] we're being mocked we're being laughed
[54:57] at you're the bride of Christ look at
[54:59] you you guys can't even get it all
[55:03] together you're weak where be your
[55:05] Miracles where be your joy where be your
[55:09] gifts I mean you used to have them but
[55:12] where are they now y you understand what
[55:14] I'm saying these things have become such
[55:16] a great mockery to even those who were
[55:19] Among
[55:20] Us is now marking us remember in my last
[55:24] message I showed you that even even
[55:26] Judah was on the side of the
[55:29] Philistines and they had actually been
[55:33] uh uh uh in in in bondage or servitude
[55:36] to the Philistines for 40 years because
[55:39] of what their Disobedience to the word
[55:42] of
[55:44] God we must come to a place where we
[55:47] find ourselves in the
[55:49] scripture that's why I read Luke I'm
[55:52] reading Luke now Luke 4:18-19
[55:56] says the spirit of the Lord is upon me
[55:58] because he have anointed me to preach
[56:00] the gospel to the poor he have sent me
[56:02] to heal the brokenhearted to preach
[56:05] Deliverance to the cap and to recovering
[56:07] of the sight to the blind to set at
[56:09] Liberty to them that are bruised to
[56:11] preach the acceptable year of the Lord
[56:14] what happened who was that that was
[56:18] Jesus Christ in the temple now reading
[56:22] the word of
[56:23] God to all of the hearers
[56:27] and before he sat down he said this
[56:29] today this scripture is fulfilled in
[56:33] your ears what was it he was literally
[56:37] finding himself in the word he
[56:39] understood the day he was living in and
[56:42] he understood who he was and what his
[56:44] mission was all about and you and I must
[56:48] understand amen that that is what we
[56:51] must know we must know who we
[56:54] are our day
[56:56] and his
[56:58] message and what we are sent for am
[57:02] Hallelujah and in spite of all of our
[57:06] failures we've got a story of
[57:11] Samson because you got to realize the
[57:14] devil is
[57:15] smart he couldn't get you to go to like
[57:19] the prophet of God said to the movies so
[57:21] he brought the movies
[57:23] in hello
[57:26] there's a lot of things he couldn't do
[57:28] so he put it on the phone the iPad the
[57:30] whatever and all of these things is to
[57:32] woo you to lure you to entice you hello
[57:39] don't get
[57:42] quiet but we have a hope beyond the
[57:45] grave if I could say it like that we
[57:47] have a message amen something that has
[57:50] been hidden in the scriptures laying
[57:52] there under those seven Thunders amen
[57:56] because nobody understand the mystery of
[57:59] it and nobody else
[58:02] will because remember when Samson told
[58:04] his first wife The Mystery of the lion
[58:07] and the and the honey she
[58:10] blabbed she told
[58:12] it but this brother R said it will not
[58:16] be
[58:17] impersonated nobody will understand it
[58:20] but those who is given
[58:22] to and they won't be able to explain it
[58:27] Hallelujah I'm anyway listen in that
[58:31] message present stage of my Ministry
[58:34] brother Bram
[58:37] said the spirit of the Lord is upon me
[58:41] because he has anointed me to preach the
[58:42] gospel to the poor and he have sent me
[58:45] to heal the
[58:47] brokenhearted and to preach the
[58:49] Deliverance to the captive and to
[58:51] recover the sight to the Blind and to
[58:54] set at Liberty to them that are bruised
[58:56] and it preached the acceptable year of
[58:58] the Lord and then he said he closed the
[59:01] book because that was the F that first
[59:04] part of that scripture was given to
[59:07] Jesus Christ himself amen amen but the
[59:11] day of
[59:13] Vengeance was given to the spirit of
[59:15] Malachi
[59:17] 4 which is in turn was Jesus Christ
[59:21] himself so he's bringing out this
[59:23] particular scripture to let you know
[59:26] it's a continuation now amen something
[59:30] is taking place I know where I am and I
[59:33] know what I come to do now some of y'all
[59:36] can say Amen bat your eyes or
[59:39] something what we need to do is find our
[59:41] scriptural finding of our place or
[59:44] position of where where we are in the
[59:47] scripture it's not enough to say okay I
[59:50] can see Ruth and I can say see Naomi but
[59:53] right now we're in a place where we need
[59:55] to know what the next move of God
[59:59] is we're in a
[1:00:02] place many people have actually allowed
[1:00:05] Delilah to Blind
[1:00:08] them and when you think about the two
[1:00:10] eyes you know you talking about Prophet
[1:00:12] you know you talking about you talking
[1:00:14] about uh uh uh Paul and and and the last
[1:00:17] day messenger because he said I preached
[1:00:20] the same thing and understand like I
[1:00:22] said last week when you get two eyes
[1:00:24] your eyes are not s going way your eyes
[1:00:26] are going this way to produce a perfect
[1:00:29] vision must bring forth the cross right
[1:00:33] so we see by God's grace that we're at a
[1:00:35] time that you and I must know and like I
[1:00:38] said if we're at a time where the church
[1:00:42] world is about to embrace the mark of
[1:00:45] the
[1:00:47] beast they're entering into something
[1:00:50] they don't even fully understand
[1:00:52] remember Samson did not understand what
[1:00:55] was going on deila did a good job on
[1:01:00] him Hallelujah coming from proving his
[1:01:03] word brother B said you know there's
[1:01:05] scripture in the Bible in 1
[1:01:08] Thessalonians 5:21 where it is written
[1:01:11] prove all things hold fast to what which
[1:01:14] is good and when anything is proven it
[1:01:17] will either be proven right or wrong and
[1:01:20] where there's anything in question it
[1:01:22] should be proven until you find out what
[1:01:25] is right amen and then as you find what
[1:01:28] is right he says hold fast in other
[1:01:32] words grip it don't turn it loose hold
[1:01:35] it fast in other words hold it tight so
[1:01:40] that it will not slip hold fast to that
[1:01:43] which is good after it's been proven
[1:01:47] right and anything that's proven not
[1:01:50] right then turn it loose as quick as you
[1:01:52] can get away from it don't never hold
[1:01:56] onto the wrong
[1:02:00] things now what is he trying to say he's
[1:02:02] coming he says now this message have
[1:02:04] been
[1:02:05] proven you should look into it look into
[1:02:08] it and see it and try it it's been
[1:02:10] proven
[1:02:12] right you know I look at these things
[1:02:14] because what people don't understand is
[1:02:16] that this this Samson
[1:02:21] continued right he didn't die until the
[1:02:24] victory was won
[1:02:27] but we're a church out of a
[1:02:30] church right it started on the day of
[1:02:35] Pentecost and and I'm jumping in my
[1:02:37] message but you know how powerful
[1:02:38] Pentecost used to be and I'm not talking
[1:02:41] about a zusa street I'm talking about
[1:02:44] the real
[1:02:45] Pentecost they had everything and let me
[1:02:49] stop because I'm getting ahead of
[1:02:52] myself first seal brother B tells us one
[1:02:55] day we we're going to find out where
[1:02:56] it's written we need to have something
[1:02:59] we need to know
[1:03:00] something where where where where this
[1:03:03] this this power of of authority is going
[1:03:06] to Quicken us we need to see it in the
[1:03:08] scripture even if it's in Shadow and
[1:03:10] type we at least know it's going to
[1:03:13] happen Samson Was
[1:03:16] Defeated he was
[1:03:18] defeated hello y'all understand me you

[1:03:31] thing we've allowed
[1:03:34] Delila to W
[1:03:37] us you say what do you
[1:03:42] mean there are so many people that don't
[1:03:44] even know which way they're
[1:03:47] going and understand me by God's grace
[1:03:50] God has never left himself as a witness
[1:03:52] but I'm talking about as a whole
[1:03:56] we don't even know what the message is
[1:03:58] many
[1:04:00] people some of us think we
[1:04:02] know but like I said we're in a time
[1:04:05] where everybody's right in their own
[1:04:10] eyes and only the word is right only God
[1:04:13] can Quicken
[1:04:16] it only God can give us what we need at
[1:04:22] this day and time
[1:04:27] brother R goes on to says and then there
[1:04:30] is coming forth seven mysterious
[1:04:33] Thunders that's not even written at
[1:04:36] all that's right and I believe that
[1:04:40] through those seven Thunders will be
[1:04:42] revealed in the last days in order to
[1:04:44] get the bride together for rapturing
[1:04:47] Faith now watch this he said getting the
[1:04:50] bride together what

[1:04:59] together now how it get how is it
[1:05:02] getting us

[1:05:10] into the body of
[1:05:12] Christ
[1:05:14] [Music]
[1:05:15] Hallelujah that's right and I believe
[1:05:17] those seven Thunders will be revealed in
[1:05:19] the last days in order to get the bride
[1:05:21] together for rapturing Faith because
[1:05:23] what we've got now we wouldn't be able
[1:05:26] to do it can I get an
[1:05:29] amen there is
[1:05:32] something amen there is something we've
[1:05:34] got to
[1:05:40] step
[1:05:41] father we
[1:05:43] can't have enough Faith to for Divine
[1:05:47] Healing hardly we've got to have enough
[1:05:50] Faith to be changed in a moment and be
[1:05:52] swept up out of this Earth and we find
[1:05:56] that after a while the Lord willing and
[1:05:59] we will find that amen after a while the
[1:06:03] Lord's willing find where it's written
[1:06:08] now he said it wasn't written but now he
[1:06:10] said you're going to find where it's
[1:06:12] written then all the judgments of these
[1:06:15] evildoers now see down through the ages
[1:06:18] of these seals have been breaking until
[1:06:21] now the last seal is broken and now they
[1:06:24] as they have been watching in on these
[1:06:27] seals and just presume presuming what
[1:06:30] they were doing you hear what he said
[1:06:33] when some people say that seven seal is
[1:06:35] not open he said the last seal has been
[1:06:38] broken see that's what I'm talking about
[1:06:40] he can say something yet people will
[1:06:42] still have their own
[1:06:44] interpretation of what he's saying he
[1:06:47] said it was
[1:06:48] open it's been
[1:06:50] Broken
[1:06:52] Hallelujah and as they've been watching
[1:06:54] in on these seals and just presume and
[1:06:57] presuming what they were doing now at
[1:07:00] the End of the Age of the church ages
[1:07:02] all these evil doers will take will take
[1:07:05] place and head up in the tribulation and
[1:07:09] all these evil doers of the Seven Seals
[1:07:12] that's been working mysteriously in the
[1:07:15] church not somewhere else in the
[1:07:19] church so you got to understand that you
[1:07:22] know when it comes to believer us you
[1:07:25] must must understand you said that can't
[1:07:27] Samson can't be yes she is because he
[1:07:30] starts off with Seven
[1:07:35] Locks and that's where his power was
[1:07:39] that's where his authority was and when
[1:07:42] he come came into his everybody was
[1:07:46] afraid of Samson he was like the Boogey
[1:07:50] Man amen here was a little fella not
[1:07:54] with these big bronzy my muscles no sir
[1:07:57] the only way they could identify Samson
[1:08:00] was by his Seven Locks and when he had
[1:08:03] when they saw the man with the Seven
[1:08:05] Locks amen they knew that was Samson now
[1:08:08] I don't know how they were locked maybe
[1:08:10] they were braided or maybe they were big
[1:08:12] curls I don't know but one thing for
[1:08:15] certain you could count
[1:08:19] them he didn't have eight he didn't have
[1:08:22] four he had seven and seven is what
[1:08:28] completion so in judges 16
[1:08:31] 4-9 and it came to pass afterward that
[1:08:35] he loved a woman in the valley of Sora
[1:08:38] whose name was
[1:08:41] Delilah and I looked up that name Sorak
[1:08:45] the valley of that that makes you know
[1:08:47] that it's it's something that's kind of
[1:08:50] seem like they always would fight in the
[1:08:52] valley every now and again they fought
[1:08:53] on mountains but most of the time in in
[1:08:55] the
[1:08:56] valley when uh when uh uh uh David had
[1:09:00] to fight Goliath it was in the
[1:09:02] valley and that's usually where the
[1:09:04] enemy take us in the valley you know we
[1:09:07] very seldom fight Wars on the
[1:09:10] mountain he takes us in the valley that
[1:09:13] name zorak means
[1:09:15] hissing it's like a color inclining to
[1:09:19] yellow and whenever we see yellow it's a
[1:09:21] caution a caution a caution or serpent
[1:09:24] hissing a caution and that's where he
[1:09:29] this is where uh uh uh
[1:09:31] Delilah
[1:09:34] was and if he could have understood the
[1:09:37] the the the name of Zoro he would have
[1:09:39] understood you better be careful
[1:09:43] boy I don't care how pretty she is you
[1:09:45] better be careful there's a cautious
[1:09:47] light is that right and the lord of the
[1:09:50] Philistines came up unto her and said
[1:09:53] unto her entice
[1:09:57] him and see wherein his strength
[1:10:02] lith and you understand what enticing is
[1:10:05] everybody know what that is it's the
[1:10:07] same thing the serpent
[1:10:09] did to
[1:10:11] eeve he enticed
[1:10:14] her he took
[1:10:16] something and he
[1:10:18] led her into an excitement or an
[1:10:22] exciting you know desire
[1:10:25] because the Bible said that she looked
[1:10:26] at it and she thought it was
[1:10:29] good and we find out that in this amen
[1:10:32] entice that word enticing is a is a
[1:10:35] strong word it's something that you and
[1:10:36] I have to be careful
[1:10:39] of because whenever you see the word
[1:10:41] enti you're also going to find lust
[1:10:46] somewhere and so he he the Philistines
[1:10:49] is in type and I'm going to get to that
[1:10:51] in just a moment the Philistines Amen in
[1:10:54] type was
[1:10:57] something but he she she the Philistines
[1:11:00] was overseeing
[1:11:04] Delilah somehow she was part of them and
[1:11:07] and they had rule over her now
[1:11:09] understand that Delila represents a
[1:11:12] church Samson represents the church
[1:11:15] Samson represents the true church
[1:11:18] Delilah represents the false
[1:11:21] one and he and she enticed him to see
[1:11:24] wherein his great strength
[1:11:28] lith and I get to this and I'm gonna go
[1:11:30] ahead on and read this and I'll come
[1:11:31] back and try to explain and by what
[1:11:34] means we he we may prevail over him that
[1:11:38] we may bind him to afflict him and we
[1:11:41] will give thee every one of us
[1:11:44] 1100 pieces of
[1:11:46] silver understand this
[1:11:49] now because there's a bargain there's a
[1:11:51] deal going
[1:11:53] on and it's all all being done through
[1:11:59] enticing and Delilah said to Samson tell
[1:12:02] me I pray thee wherein thy great
[1:12:03] strength lith and wherewith Ye Ye
[1:12:06] mightest be bound to afflict thee and
[1:12:09] Samson said unto her if they bind me
[1:12:11] with seven green
[1:12:14] wids that were never dried then shall I
[1:12:19] be weak and be as another man then the
[1:12:22] Lord of Philistines brought up to her
[1:12:24] seven green wi which had not been dried
[1:12:28] and she bound him with them and now
[1:12:31] there was a were men lying in weight
[1:12:34] abiding with her in the chamber and she
[1:12:36] said unto him the Philistines be upon
[1:12:38] thee Samson and he break the wi as a a a
[1:12:42] thread of toe is broken when is touched
[1:12:45] the fire so his strength was not
[1:12:49] known as I said Samson here is the type
[1:12:53] of the True Believer he's the true
[1:12:55] Church uh the true Ministry of the Holy
[1:12:59] Ghost I mean signs and wonders followed
[1:13:02] him you know all they had to do is say
[1:13:04] Samson's here and many of the
[1:13:07] Philistines would
[1:13:08] run and and you got to understand
[1:13:10] Philistines not only represents a a fake
[1:13:14] a false organization or church but it
[1:13:16] also represents demonic
[1:13:19] Powers but here's Samson who is a
[1:13:23] Nazarite and we we know the secret of of
[1:13:27] his Nazarite of being a Nazarite was uh
[1:13:31] the anointing or the uh the anointed
[1:13:34] mystery you know of those Seven Locks
[1:13:36] because remember God told his mom and
[1:13:38] his dad whatever you do don't let him
[1:13:40] cut
[1:13:46] it so anyhow we look at these things and
[1:13:49] we say
[1:13:52] Lord what is it that we don't
[1:13:56] know but here was the early church amen
[1:13:59] the first church was blessed with seven
[1:14:01] spirits of God and Seven Stars in his
[1:14:04] right hand and they were all abundant in
[1:14:07] faith and in the Supernatural what could
[1:14:09] touch the early church when they first
[1:14:11] were birthed cripples were walking dumb
[1:14:14] was talking dead was raised now I'm
[1:14:17] going all the way back to Pentecost now
[1:14:19] this is what the early church so you got
[1:14:22] to understand in this Samson story there
[1:14:24] must be seven Church ages and Seven
[1:14:27] Seals and however you want to put it
[1:14:29] because if it types us out we must find
[1:14:31] out where it's at we're at the end
[1:14:35] time
[1:14:36] Hallelujah and we must know amen that
[1:14:39] here was Samson amen as a shadow and a
[1:14:42] type of the Bride of Jesus Christ now I
[1:14:45] know that a lot of time people think
[1:14:48] amen that at the end of the day you know
[1:14:50] as I said before this great Jesus is
[1:14:52] going to crack the sky and everybody's
[1:14:54] going to start rising up and
[1:14:56] disappearing and that's that's not quite
[1:14:58] right that's not you won't find
[1:15:00] scripture that says that's the way he's
[1:15:02] coming his coming is a
[1:15:05] mystery hey everybody won't see him like
[1:15:09] that because the Rapture will take place
[1:15:11] and people won't even know it's
[1:15:14] gone so what are you talking about I'm
[1:15:16] saying even the Rapture to this day God
[1:15:18] will interpret it his
[1:15:21] way but no man know the day nor the hour
[1:15:25] but we know the season we're living
[1:15:29] in Revelations 2:1 says unto the angel
[1:15:32] of the Church of Ephesus all right these
[1:15:35] things say he that holdeth the Seven
[1:15:36] Stars in his right hand and who walketh
[1:15:39] in the midst of the seven golden C
[1:15:40] sticks see the stars represented the
[1:15:43] light and the anointing of The
[1:15:46] Messengers and the Seven golden
[1:15:48] candlesticks represented the power of
[1:15:50] the Holy Ghost they had it right there
[1:15:53] amen with them
[1:15:55] and think about it how powerful they
[1:15:57] were when they first started I think
[1:15:59] 3,000 Souls were saved one
[1:16:03] time though they were poor didn't have
[1:16:06] much but one thing they did have was the
[1:16:08] anointing of their
[1:16:10] day so the first coming of the of Christ
[1:16:13] brought this power to the church they
[1:16:16] were Witnesses of Christ and Witnesses
[1:16:18] of uh to the power of the Holy Ghost you
[1:16:22] know they didn't have to wonder what it
[1:16:23] was they knew what it was was it was so
[1:16:27] powerful that it was it Simon the
[1:16:29] Sorcerer who wanted the Holy Ghost he
[1:16:31] wanted to buy
[1:16:33] it and it was the disciples says you're
[1:16:36] in the seed of Satan you a seed of the
[1:16:38] serpent you are evil if you think that
[1:16:41] the power of God can be bought but watch
[1:16:44] this now because here was Delilah trying
[1:16:46] to find out Samson
[1:16:48] secret cuz she she she's already done
[1:16:52] bought it or sold it before she can get
[1:16:56] it she was like
[1:17:00] Judas being bought by the Philistines
[1:17:03] I'm coming
[1:17:04] here cuz the Philistines that word also
[1:17:07] means villagers or can I say it like
[1:17:09] this
[1:17:10] denominations but they gathered together
[1:17:12] to do what destroy Samson because Samson
[1:17:16] was their enemy he was the
[1:17:21] target this message is the target yes
[1:17:25] this message is the enemy why because it
[1:17:30] exposes Satan that's right in his
[1:17:34] craftiness
[1:17:35] Hallelujah hey if I could get destroy
[1:17:41] him I got
[1:17:43] him and this is why people don't
[1:17:45] understand they said well what happened
[1:17:47] remember months ago maybe a year ago
[1:17:49] amen when they started this move uh you
[1:17:52] know uh believe the sign preach
[1:17:56] amen who who were Pastors in this church
[1:17:58] in Africa and everywhere else left the
[1:18:01] message and went back to the Catholic
[1:18:03] Church what was it that was the
[1:18:07] anointing it has to be there because you
[1:18:11] got to understand amen she comes to find
[1:18:15] your
[1:18:17] weaknesses she wants to know your
[1:18:20] power but see what they don't understand
[1:18:23] God didn't even reveal it to
[1:18:26] us so we can't tell them nothing we can
[1:18:29] say oh the seven Thunders but they don't
[1:18:31] know it we can say the Seven Seals but
[1:18:34] they can't understand it you see that's
[1:18:36] why God put it in that kind of grammar
[1:18:38] that grammar of the seven seal will Anno
[1:18:41] you if you're an intellect that's
[1:18:47] right but he he it behind
[1:18:51] Simplicity hallelujah what they don't
[1:18:54] understand is got God is a is a loaf of
[1:18:56] bread he breaks it up amen here a little
[1:18:59] there a little line upon line precept
[1:19:02] upon precept he hides it from the wise
[1:19:05] and The
[1:19:06] Prudent Hallelujah but she want to know
[1:19:08] his
[1:19:10] secret
[1:19:12] Hallelujah and they were Mighty and
[1:19:14] power like Samson right that early
[1:19:17] church amen they you know Samson what
[1:19:20] what did he do he was killed lions
[1:19:22] destroyed the destroyed the fields of
[1:19:24] the Philistines and he kill you know I
[1:19:27] talked about it last week he whipped
[1:19:28] those Philistines and put them in Three
[1:19:32] Stacks with the Jawbone of ass what was
[1:19:35] it that Jawbone of the ass amen it was a
[1:19:38] new Jawbone not only that it was
[1:19:42] anointed there is no way that he would
[1:19:44] have been able do you realize how thick
[1:19:47] those men helmets and everything else
[1:19:49] was in that day I don't even know how
[1:19:51] they held their heads up because the
[1:19:53] helmet was so sick but Samson took that
[1:19:56] jaw on boom and he killed now we don't
[1:19:59] know how long it took we think that
[1:20:02] every time he hit somebody they went out
[1:20:04] but it doesn't say it could have been an
[1:20:07] all day it could have been two days
[1:20:09] three days we don't know how long it
[1:20:10] took but at the end of the day he had to
[1:20:14] have time to whoop him and stack him at
[1:20:15] the same
[1:20:17] time right but in all of that he
[1:20:21] defeated the Philistines
[1:20:25] oh y'all understand me he took the gates
[1:20:28] of Gaza upon his back is that right he
[1:20:32] was such amazed he was such he he was a
[1:20:35] Marvel to him they they didn't
[1:20:37] understand he all the amazing feats that
[1:20:39] he did or had amen but that was the
[1:20:43] early
[1:20:46] church but soon There Rose a false
[1:20:49] church called Delilah now y'all know
[1:20:51] that's the
[1:20:52] scripture in that first church age what
[1:20:57] came huh she was aimed at and
[1:21:02] relaxed and what did they bring they
[1:21:06] brought a false Church in by way of
[1:21:10] deception by way of control by way of
[1:21:13] moving little doctrines is that right
[1:21:16] because that's what Paul said the
[1:21:17] Antichrist is already
[1:21:19] here he coming in and he's going to
[1:21:22] change your
[1:21:23] doctrines because you know when you
[1:21:25] change a word it brings in death sir and
[1:21:29] Delilah was that kind of a person you
[1:21:31] know Dela Delila it means you know
[1:21:34] feeble she she was like um but it wasn't
[1:21:37] like she was feeble it was it was a verb
[1:21:39] that kind of a thing that will cause you
[1:21:41] to be
[1:21:43] feeble and that's what she did she kept
[1:21:46] talking to
[1:21:48] Samson and all of us all of a sudden he
[1:21:50] became
[1:21:52] feeble he kept she kept working with
[1:21:54] with the the True Church of God y'all
[1:21:57] don't believe it it's the truth we
[1:22:00] didn't know the Antichrist Spirit at the
[1:22:03] end of the day was called
[1:22:05] Jezebel and Jezebel was just another
[1:22:07] type of
[1:22:13] Deliah and she woed him and woed him and
[1:22:16] you know what she she she became Samson
[1:22:20] weak
[1:22:23] spot she did did she had the ability to
[1:22:27] make the strong man
[1:22:30] Weak by what
[1:22:33] deception and that's what the CH that's
[1:22:35] what she did that thing that became a
[1:22:39] deed became a
[1:22:41] doctr and what did it do it made Ephesus
[1:22:47] weak and every time she brought a trick
[1:22:51] Samson came up out of it
[1:22:54] Hallelujah because even when when when
[1:22:57] it came that she would you think about
[1:22:59] it she had Samson so under her control
[1:23:02] that every time he she tried to deceive
[1:23:04] him she always had another man in her
[1:23:08] Chambers they were there
[1:23:11] waiting what was that that was the
[1:23:16] devil waiting to imprison Samson as soon
[1:23:19] as he got off the
[1:23:23] word is that right right because that's
[1:23:25] what he said oh he he's he's he's
[1:23:27] flirting with her you know I'll tell you
[1:23:29] a little
[1:23:31] bit he goes on and says I'll tell you a
[1:23:34] little bit about you know my my seven
[1:23:36] Thunder Revelation if you just bind me
[1:23:37] with this or bind me with that this is
[1:23:39] what's going to happen and it never
[1:23:41] happen because God cannot be
[1:23:44] bind she's a type of the false church
[1:23:47] this girl and if you understand by God's
[1:23:50] grace she's all right the Philistine
[1:23:52] types out Rome he's that four fourth be
[1:23:54] of Daniel's Vision so the spirit of
[1:23:57] wrome gets into her and entice or seduce
[1:24:00] the true church to find the source of
[1:24:03] her power don't tell me that didn't
[1:24:05] happen let's bring it all the way down
[1:24:07] to our day because that's what happened
[1:24:09] to the Pentecostal
[1:24:10] Church she used to be
[1:24:14] powerful but when demon
[1:24:16] shakarian flirted with
[1:24:21] Delilah he literally Gave Over his power
[1:24:25] her power is that
[1:24:27] right gave her power amen join in he she
[1:24:32] he seduced her and how did how did how
[1:24:35] did she seduce him I'm talking about how
[1:24:37] did Rome seduce him money that's what
[1:24:41] happened now they got big churches big
[1:24:44] Pentecostal churches Coliseum churches
[1:24:47] big churches why amen she's been seduced
[1:24:56] H I ain't against I'm just trying to
[1:24:59] preach the word of God I'm not against
[1:25:01] nobody but I'm against systems so the
[1:25:04] spirit of Rome gets into her to entice
[1:25:07] and to seduce the true church to find
[1:25:09] the source of her power see they thought
[1:25:12] it was speaking in tongues that ain't
[1:25:15] it speaking in tongues never been the
[1:25:17] power of the
[1:25:19] church ma speaking in tongue is the
[1:25:21] least of all
[1:25:23] gifts but now everybody think if I if I
[1:25:26] speak in tongues I got the power oh no
[1:25:28] no no no no see they don't even
[1:25:31] know see where that great strength liar
[1:25:35] see religious that white horse rider
[1:25:38] impersonation of Christianity and the
[1:25:40] source of his
[1:25:42] strength by what means we may prevail
[1:25:45] against him you see what I'm saying when
[1:25:47] you see people getting together what
[1:25:48] means what is that political let's find
[1:25:51] out how we can do this thing politically
[1:25:53] that's why I try to tell people amen you
[1:25:55] know what we need the Holy Ghost in This
[1:25:57] Church you don't know who's been sent
[1:26:02] here I remember in I Ohio amen my my
[1:26:06] house was
[1:26:07] bugged people were following me they
[1:26:10] might be still following I don't care
[1:26:12] didn't care then don't care
[1:26:14] now my point is amen they know
[1:26:19] you they know me there is no hiding
[1:26:22] place outside of Jesus Christ and it it
[1:26:26] behooves us today to make sure you got
[1:26:29] the good
[1:26:30] amen I've learned some things about
[1:26:33] Grace and I've learned some things about
[1:26:36] God in these last this Corona virus
[1:26:40] probably been the best thing that could
[1:26:41] have happened for me
[1:26:45] spiritually y'all understand me I know
[1:26:48] many people have died and many people
[1:26:50] have gotten sick but I'm trying to tell
[1:26:52] you it was a eyeopener for me
[1:26:54] my scripture the scripture of this Bible
[1:26:57] has now been unfolding and unfolding
[1:26:59] unfolding and unfolding and all
[1:27:02] along we've known this but it yet it
[1:27:06] still took us by our
[1:27:09] surprise political right that red horse
[1:27:12] rider and so you better understand where
[1:27:14] I'm going with this if those horses are
[1:27:16] riding which they
[1:27:18] are what's coming what is now the spirit
[1:27:23] of that P that pale horse rider I'm
[1:27:25] jumping my message I'm jumping but you
[1:27:27] got to understand the end result of this
[1:27:29] is death amen you understand me but like
[1:27:33] I said it you know there's victory in
[1:27:38] death amen because Samson said Lord let
[1:27:42] me
[1:27:43] die with my enemy but he knew that if he
[1:27:47] would die with his enemy he was going to
[1:27:49] rise again amen y'all understand me in
[1:27:52] other words I will not bow I will not
[1:27:55] Bend I will not break there'll not be a
[1:27:58] mark of the beast
[1:27:59] here and whatever it takes God will keep
[1:28:03] me and we shall stand am right that's
[1:28:09] what it is see what happened that
[1:28:11] political uh politician came in riding
[1:28:14] on that red horse the church and state
[1:28:16] with equal find a way so that we can get
[1:28:19] equal grounds so we can destroy him by
[1:28:22] numbers and you see no matter what they
[1:28:24] did throughout history they thought they
[1:28:26] were going to defeat Ephesus and they
[1:28:28] couldn't they thought they were going to
[1:28:30] defeat Smyrna but they couldn't we
[1:28:32] killed them all they couldn't kill them
[1:28:34] all by killing them it made them
[1:28:38] stronger what is that secret those
[1:28:41] people God Amen that makes them that way
[1:28:43] we got to kill them well let me say it
[1:28:46] like this if you didn't kill Jesus and
[1:28:49] if you couldn't kill Jesus you surely
[1:28:50] can't kill his children amen hallelujah
[1:28:53] cuz they made out of the same substance
[1:28:56] Hallelujah I hope I'm being you being
[1:28:58] blessed tonight because I want you to
[1:29:01] understand that this in this these
[1:29:02] things I keep working with Samson
[1:29:04] because there's a lot more to Samson
[1:29:06] than the whole judges there's a lot to
[1:29:09] it and by God's grace I hope we get a
[1:29:11] chance to go through all as many that we
[1:29:14] may bind see that what was it what binds
[1:29:16] you what binds a person other than demon
[1:29:19] power brother Brooks I'm trying to tell
[1:29:21] us something here and maybe I'll jump a
[1:29:23] little bit and then have to come back
[1:29:25] around but my point is
[1:29:30] this he told
[1:29:37] her if you cut off my seven lcks now I'm
[1:29:41] jumping but I'll come back to it then
[1:29:44] I'll lose power I won't have no more
[1:29:50] Authority and when she cut those Seven
[1:29:52] Locks off yall understand what I'm
[1:29:54] trying to say she brought so much
[1:29:56] confusion in the church through her
[1:29:59] denominationalism and her false
[1:30:01] teachings Jezebel did and what happened
[1:30:06] when you break one word you go into
[1:30:11] darkness and it put Samson into a place
[1:30:15] now watch this because the Pentecostals
[1:30:17] and I'm jumping back and forth I hope
[1:30:19] you see where I'm working cu the
[1:30:21] Pentecostals of our day they saw the
[1:30:23] Spirit of Samson they saw
[1:30:27] it right but demon
[1:30:30] sharan start flirting with all the
[1:30:33] organizations Billy Graham as
[1:30:35] well but he didn't do what Deus
[1:30:39] did Demus led the UPC right into the
[1:30:43] World Council of churches and at that
[1:30:46] point she takes the mark of the
[1:30:49] beast now watch Leia she's blind she's
[1:30:52] naked but listen my son was asking me
[1:30:55] the other day he said Daddy you know
[1:30:57] you're talking about uh churches that
[1:31:00] have prospered and all that I said don't
[1:31:01] you know the original Church ain't never
[1:31:03] had
[1:31:04] nothing I said only in this age have we
[1:31:07] become rich and increase with good and
[1:31:10] have need of
[1:31:11] nothing I said but the early church
[1:31:14] where Silver and Gold Have I None but
[1:31:16] such as I have give I Thee but how did
[1:31:20] we get
[1:31:21] rich we got rich like
[1:31:25] Delilah we sold out to the Philistine
[1:31:28] which is representation of the Catholic
[1:31:30] Ro Roman Catholic
[1:31:33] Church understand amen the
[1:31:37] Philistines they never did get rid
[1:31:41] of and this church this bride you're not
[1:31:44] going to get rid of the Catholic Church
[1:31:47] she's here to
[1:31:49] stay the only person only one will ever
[1:31:52] get rid of her is God himself
[1:31:54] they bribe we've been here for 2,000
[1:31:56] years or more no other organization has
[1:31:59] been here yeah that's
[1:32:01] right it's true look what you were and
[1:32:04] look what you are
[1:32:06] now oh yes and the Bible says amen she's
[1:32:09] bringing everybody to their
[1:32:11] knees all whose names are not written in
[1:32:15] the Lamb's Book of Life shall will take
[1:32:19] the mark of the beast and here we are
[1:32:24] in this last
[1:32:26] day and we're like
[1:32:30] Samson say what you want to
[1:32:32] say but as a whole we're just like
[1:32:35] samon eyes plucked
[1:32:39] out going around in
[1:32:42] circles grinding the
[1:32:44] meal huh grinding the meal while they
[1:32:48] make fun of us y'all say y'all got a
[1:32:51] prophet and y'all supposed to be this
[1:32:53] and y'all say ye are gods and y'all say
[1:32:55] this and that y'all predestinated and
[1:32:56] y'all elected and look at
[1:32:59] you your whole thing is falling apart
[1:33:03] you know why because we let some of the
[1:33:06] Philistines
[1:33:08] in we let those S those people seduce us
[1:33:13] they found out where the power
[1:33:17] was you don't need no Holy Ghost Holy
[1:33:21] Ghost without sensation
[1:33:24] hello what was that now these same
[1:33:28] people that brought the doctrine is no
[1:33:29] longer among us but they weakened
[1:33:33] us now people don't even know what the
[1:33:36] Holy Ghost is when it's already been
[1:33:38] preached to
[1:33:40] us you can't live and live you got to
[1:33:43] die and
[1:33:46] live and that's what the people don't
[1:33:48] want to do they want to die they don't
[1:33:50] want to die but one thing about Samson
[1:33:51] he said he came to that conclusion I've
[1:33:54] been wrong I have sinned I've done wrong
[1:33:58] I've allowed the Philistines the
[1:33:59] influence the Lusty the the the the
[1:34:01] seduced duction amen get a hold of me
[1:34:04] I'm
[1:34:05] there but there's a
[1:34:10] possibility he said Lord remember me I
[1:34:15] like that statement some say Lord
[1:34:17] remember me you ordained me Hallelujah
[1:34:21] is that right he was chosen he was
[1:34:25] elected Amen to destroy the Philistines
[1:34:28] amen so is a bride of Jesus Christ
[1:34:31] Hallelujah she is designed to De be to
[1:34:35] De to defeat Satan in his own
[1:34:41] Eden is he
[1:34:43] there like I said I jumped all over my
[1:34:46] message but Delilah in the 16th chapter
[1:34:49] 10th verse say Delilah said unto Samson
[1:34:51] behold thou has mocked me
[1:34:55] and told me lies now tell me I pray thee
[1:34:58] wherewith thou mightest be bound and he
[1:35:01] said unto her if they bind me fast with
[1:35:04] new
[1:35:05] ropes that never was occupied then shall
[1:35:08] I be weak and be as another
[1:35:11] man Delilah said therefore took two
[1:35:14] ropes and bound him therewith and said
[1:35:16] unto him the Philistines be upon thee
[1:35:19] Samson and they were liar lying in
[1:35:22] weight about abiding in the chamber and
[1:35:25] he break them from off his arms like a
[1:35:29] thread and Delilah said unto Samson
[1:35:32] hitherto thou Hast mocked me and told me
[1:35:34] lies tell me therewith thou mightest be
[1:35:37] bound and he said unto her if thou
[1:35:40] weaves the Seven Locks of my head with
[1:35:43] the web and she fastened it with pin and
[1:35:46] said unto him the Philistines be upon
[1:35:48] thee Samson and he wake out of his sleep
[1:35:51] and went away with the pin of the beam
[1:35:53] and with the well and she said unto him
[1:35:56] how cast thou say I love thee when thine
[1:36:01] heart is not with me oh
[1:36:04] my thou has marked me these three times
[1:36:08] and has not told me wherein thou great
[1:36:12] strength
[1:36:13] lith now if you can't
[1:36:17] see how the enemy comes in with that
[1:36:20] second
[1:36:21] seal in this thing
[1:36:25] and the thing that he's doing is trying
[1:36:26] to
[1:36:28] bind the first forse Rider than the red
[1:36:32] one and now she's wooing him she's
[1:36:35] working with
[1:36:38] him and he's just kind of giving her all
[1:36:40] kind of
[1:36:43] intellectual
[1:36:45] answers but we know one thing that in
[1:36:48] that second seal is when they began to
[1:36:50] legislate and you know made doctrines
[1:36:54] laws and you know you know making the
[1:36:56] church and state join amen together and
[1:37:00] and and and and what did that do that
[1:37:02] crippled the
[1:37:03] church but they were still strong under
[1:37:06] that Ox anointing there was revealed in
[1:37:10] the giving up of their lives and become
[1:37:13] martys for Christ and it it only made
[1:37:15] them stronger as I said under that you
[1:37:17] see what what I'm saying is even though
[1:37:19] church and state joined together that
[1:37:21] little group was still as strong and you
[1:37:23] know what they became Martyrs you can't
[1:37:25] put this down you can't stop it it is
[1:37:29] what it is you know but we know by God's
[1:37:33] grace and then Delilah and then when she
[1:37:35] saw that she was defeated she got
[1:37:39] angry but you know what sometimes we we
[1:37:41] got to understand this did theila you
[1:37:44] know she was a
[1:37:46] prostitute and no doubt she she did what
[1:37:49] was necessary to weaken
[1:37:56] Samson she
[1:38:01] basically wanted to dominate
[1:38:04] him and every time she thought she could
[1:38:07] use her sexuality to weaken weaken him
[1:38:10] and break him down he
[1:38:12] always pull a trick on
[1:38:17] him and that's the way it is that's the
[1:38:19] way it is spiritually we don't even see
[1:38:20] it but that's what seducing Spirits do
[1:38:23] they come to break you down they come to
[1:38:26] to to to to den uh how can I say uh to
[1:38:29] rule over you because the Bible said who
[1:38:31] you yield your members to obey that's
[1:38:32] who you your servants
[1:38:35] to and she got mad remember when Jezebel
[1:38:38] got
[1:38:41] mad even a prophet called Elijah was a
[1:38:44] scared afraid of her he himself cuz
[1:38:48] Jezebel said I'm going to kill you
[1:38:54] huh I'm going to kill you I'm put you
[1:38:56] know mean she and guess what Elijah got
[1:38:59] out of her
[1:39:01] way and when the anointing of God is Not
[1:39:04] on you you ain't nothing that's right I
[1:39:07] don't care who you think you are with
[1:39:09] that anointing is not there you are
[1:39:11] nothing amen Samson was nothing without
[1:39:14] the anointing it proves it am Pentecost
[1:39:17] look at them they can shout they can
[1:39:19] dance they can run up and down the house
[1:39:20] they can speak and I'm talking about
[1:39:22] everybody that them to be that listen
[1:39:25] that's not where the power
[1:39:31] lay that wasn't Samson's
[1:39:34] strength the strength first of all was
[1:39:36] in the Covenant amen hallelujah come on
[1:39:41] and you got to realize that Samson had
[1:39:43] an unconditional
[1:39:45] Covenant is that right he sure
[1:39:49] did he did
[1:39:52] wrong he paid for it oh y'all think oh I
[1:39:55] got an unconditional Covenant I ain't
[1:39:56] going to pay for it yes you are you're
[1:39:59] going to pay for whatever sin you do you
[1:40:01] going to pay for it but at the end of
[1:40:03] the day God will save you
[1:40:07] amen is that right and just observe it
[1:40:11] I'm going on he is you know even in the
[1:40:12] third seal if you want to go and he is
[1:40:14] getting weaker where where see him
[1:40:17] bringing up those Seven Locks of his
[1:40:18] hair see she's getting closer to the
[1:40:20] truth he gives her an intellectual idea
[1:40:24] of his Seven Locks and she tries with
[1:40:26] demon
[1:40:29] power all those lies she's telling with
[1:40:32] telling him you know and and she's just
[1:40:34] flirting and I wish I was an actor I put
[1:40:36] it on for you
[1:40:39] tonight but I'm not an actor you know
[1:40:41] but my thing is I mean she did all the
[1:40:44] the the the the things that a woman
[1:40:46] would do to to lure him and to seduce
[1:40:50] him and one of the things she didn't
[1:40:52] began to work a little psychology on
[1:40:56] him you ought to be ashamed of yourself
[1:40:58] and say you're a man of God and won't
[1:41:00] tell me the
[1:41:02] truth and every time I you tell me it's
[1:41:04] a lie and it's just so Samson was still
[1:41:08] blind in his Spirit he may have had eyes
[1:41:10] to see but he was blind he couldn't see
[1:41:13] what the woman was doing hello amen so
[1:41:16] was the Pentecostal Church of our day
[1:41:20] she couldn't
[1:41:21] see what join in what that church was
[1:41:24] doing to
[1:41:26] her she was Mo literally moving into
[1:41:29] what they call the mark of the beast
[1:41:32] she's now Grand they great they got big
[1:41:35] money they but they don't understand
[1:41:38] they are the image to the
[1:41:46] Beast I'm talking about what's the
[1:41:49] reality of our day now they G to shut
[1:41:51] this down one of these old days and so
[1:41:53] I'm hoping that you getting this in your
[1:42:00] soul it took so much more believable she
[1:42:06] weaved a web into his locks and pinned
[1:42:09] it down to a horizontal beam seemingly
[1:42:14] trapping his head
[1:42:15] completely this shows a war of
[1:42:18] intelligence
[1:42:23] yeah yeah and under that third seal was
[1:42:26] a false Doctrine after the defeat of the
[1:42:28] Catholic Church see the spirit of the
[1:42:30] enemy trying to trap the church in a web
[1:42:33] of teachings that they had different
[1:42:36] interpretations for the teaching of
[1:42:38] Christ and of the Old Testament though
[1:42:40] they came out of the mother Church they
[1:42:43] began to to devil into demonic doctrines
[1:42:46] and belief and that's exactly what
[1:42:48] happened they came out under that
[1:42:51] intelligent age Luther
[1:42:54] right but then after they came out they
[1:42:56] start dabbling into those things that
[1:42:58] were not
[1:42:59] scriptural
[1:43:01] hallelujah amen what was it he had her
[1:43:04] he had tied her
[1:43:06] down Hallelujah but it didn't last amen
[1:43:10] because even under that int intellectual
[1:43:13] age we had great men like Martin Luther
[1:43:16] and John Wesley and a host of
[1:43:18] intellectual or intelligent minds of the
[1:43:20] Gospel that was constantly able to steer
[1:43:23] each denomination away from receiving
[1:43:25] the mark of the beast in their
[1:43:28] time this ain't something
[1:43:30] new we've known for
[1:43:33] years about the mark of the
[1:43:36] beast and our church amen America was
[1:43:39] found upon freedom of religion what were
[1:43:42] we doing running from the Philistines
[1:43:45] running from
[1:43:47] Rome freedom of religion
[1:43:50] again H but oh oh my she
[1:44:02] slick when Delila kept seeing I I gotta
[1:44:06] I got I gotta I gotta get her
[1:44:10] somehow I gotta when he I gotta get I
[1:44:13] got to get Samson son house you know I
[1:44:17] got to get him I got to I got to find a
[1:44:19] way you know she she you know she
[1:44:22] carried on like little hurt girl and you
[1:44:25] know what I'm saying she oh she went
[1:44:27] through her
[1:44:28] motions mhm and know Samson finally
[1:44:32] broke
[1:44:34] down right but see what people don't
[1:44:37] understand is that we're living in the
[1:44:40] day of oh Lord once
[1:44:45] more you and I know we want
[1:44:50] Revival but you know what the only way
[1:44:53] we going to get it we must die to
[1:44:56] ourselves the secret of the anointing
[1:45:02] returning was a mystery and I'm going to
[1:45:05] close in just a bit because I don't I
[1:45:07] don't want to go too far with this I'll
[1:45:09] finish it up Sunday evening my point is
[1:45:13] this when the pale house came pale hor
[1:45:17] came
[1:45:19] through that was that second depth
[1:45:21] before the first depth the depth of the
[1:45:23] soul to death and he followed after him
[1:45:26] now watch this because when Delilah came
[1:45:28] she was that type of the false church
[1:45:31] now look at this you didn't even know
[1:45:33] the false Church existed did we
[1:45:38] until God broke the
[1:45:42] seals it separated the false and the
[1:45:46] TRU here was a church amen producing
[1:45:50] twins they look so much alike
[1:45:55] but one amen has been ordained to be
[1:45:57] anointed again
[1:46:01] amen see Samson coming or the first
[1:46:05] coming was great but the second coming
[1:46:07] which is Samson
[1:46:10] again which is a bride of Jesus Christ
[1:46:13] in her
[1:46:15] Ministry but in order for her to defeat
[1:46:17] the Philistines she must die to herself
[1:46:21] amen she must must confess she must ask
[1:46:24] God for forgiveness and she must cry out
[1:46:27] oh Lord once more Lord remember
[1:46:36] me she made a deal with
[1:46:38] Rome Philistines telling them she was
[1:46:41] ready to join them and they brought her
[1:46:44] money see that's what she did when they
[1:46:47] asked her to do it she joined them
[1:46:54] this is the first age because that that
[1:46:57] you know where we C became rich and
[1:46:58] increased with good think about it how
[1:47:01] do we get
[1:47:02] it all of a sudden we would just pour on
[1:47:04] the corner shaking the
[1:47:07] tamarine now we've got these huge
[1:47:09] churches that call
[1:47:13] themselves huh and they say we're on
[1:47:16] fire you know why because everybody even
[1:47:20] myself have been guilty of it
[1:47:24] expecting to see jumping and shouting
[1:47:27] and running and dancing and that's not
[1:47:29] real
[1:47:30] fire real fire is when you can't help it
[1:47:34] help but tell somebody about
[1:47:36] Jesus cuz remember on the day of
[1:47:39] Pentecost when the fire fell they were
[1:47:42] dancing shouting running but you know
[1:47:44] what they were declaring Jesus is
[1:47:47] Alive that's when you're on fire when
[1:47:50] Jesus becomes so real you can't can't
[1:47:53] keep your mouth
[1:47:56] shut amen so let me move on and I'm just
[1:48:00] getting ready to say it we're the only
[1:48:01] one that types out it types out Samson
[1:48:05] because a lot of time we say
[1:48:07] well Samson was blind and didn't know it
[1:48:11] well one thing about
[1:48:15] Samson when the Philistines finished
[1:48:17] with them he was rendered
[1:48:20] powerless he was weak
[1:48:25] and he was the worst of
[1:48:28] all and they didn't know him he didn't
[1:48:31] even know
[1:48:32] it he he didn't know it you said what do
[1:48:35] you mean he really couldn't see his
[1:48:38] condition until his condition saw him he
[1:48:41] was
[1:48:42] blind
[1:48:44] stripped at the meal slavy is what it
[1:48:48] was slavery to what Philistines slavery
[1:48:51] to sin
[1:48:53] slavery to have it slavery slavery
[1:48:55] slavery right he got tired of it but
[1:48:59] here's the
[1:49:01] mystery he didn't even
[1:49:04] know that while he was going through the
[1:49:08] mockery while he was going through the
[1:49:13] suffering his locks had grown
[1:49:17] back the Philistines were
[1:49:20] so into their
[1:49:25] Amusement that they didn't even
[1:49:28] see the Covenant had been
[1:49:32] restored I don't know who braided his
[1:49:34] hair how the locks came back but he just
[1:49:36] went like
[1:49:39] this there was nobody there to comb his
[1:49:42] hair nobody to braided or give it any
[1:49:46] kind of manicure or whatever you call
[1:49:48] it but
[1:49:51] somehow something stirred his
[1:49:55] heart he got tired of the
[1:49:58] laughter he got tired of the
[1:50:01] mockery he got he realized amen there
[1:50:05] might have been other shows but he was
[1:50:07] the center of Attraction y'all better
[1:50:09] hear what I'm saying this message is the
[1:50:12] center of
[1:50:14] Attraction and somehow we ought to want
[1:50:18] to see it live again
[1:50:20] amen something got to start
[1:50:23] oh Lord remember
[1:50:25] me that's all I'm saying Lord remember
[1:50:28] me I'm wrong I I I make my
[1:50:32] confession I'm not on fire like I desire
[1:50:35] to be hallelujah oh no there's no way
[1:50:40] I'm where I ought to
[1:50:42] be now I can say it y'all that's between
[1:50:44] you and God all I'm trying to say is
[1:50:46] that what I read in the Bible is what I
[1:50:49] want to see in
[1:50:51] me I'm I'm not talking about some some
[1:50:54] mocra lifestyle I'm talking about
[1:50:56] something that's so powerful my life is
[1:50:58] just like Christ hello that's what we
[1:51:02] are called to be and you and I must
[1:51:05] understand by God's grace this is the
[1:51:07] day we're living
[1:51:09] in you are going to either take the mark
[1:51:12] of the
[1:51:14] beast or you going to be sealed by the
[1:51:16] Holy
[1:51:19] Ghost oh Lord once more you say that
[1:51:21] can't be bride it is bride and I'll
[1:51:23] continue on this lesson come
[1:51:25] Sunday but let me tell you something
[1:51:27] people of God we're right at the brink
[1:51:29] of
[1:51:31] something our country is
[1:51:34] falling and ain't not but one church
[1:51:36] that can can raise us up I didn't say
[1:51:38] one country I say
[1:51:40] church that's what it's going to
[1:51:43] be everybody every country in the world
[1:51:46] bows to the wrong
[1:51:49] Minds mystery Babylon the Great
[1:51:53] first wrong was
[1:51:56] destroyed but this spiritual
[1:51:59] one be here when Jesus come
[1:52:02] back nothing to be able to break her
[1:52:04] ho but Jesus himself and he takes us
[1:52:08] out that's what I love about it he takes
[1:52:11] us
[1:52:12] out Amen to be with
[1:52:15] him do y'all realize what I'm trying to
[1:52:18] say what are you saying because if you
[1:52:21] read the Bible you find out that the
[1:52:23] Antichrist become the Beast and the
[1:52:26] Beast become I the false prophet the
[1:52:28] Beast and y'all know how it works so you
[1:52:30] got to understand this ain't no joke
[1:52:32] this ain't no play play brother bam said
[1:52:34] you know when it comes to the
[1:52:36] persecution of this
[1:52:38] thing what Hitler did to the Jews would
[1:52:41] be Child's
[1:52:43] Play huh Child's Play do you know what
[1:52:47] those Jews went
[1:52:49] through and then you got people say it
[1:52:51] never happened are you
[1:52:55] serious Child's
[1:52:57] Play and nobody nothing can be more
[1:53:01] crueler than those Devils from the
[1:53:05] anian those Devils that was from from
[1:53:08] anian day they're alive now you say oh
[1:53:11] they awake now and the only thing that's
[1:53:14] hoing now is certain laws but we got a
[1:53:17] government right now that's going to let
[1:53:19] a lot of stuff loose
[1:53:24] y'all I tell you what I better not say
[1:53:27] that
[1:53:30] but they might have the sirines out my
[1:53:34] door but my point is this people of God
[1:53:37] it's
[1:53:38] serious and I don't know whether I made
[1:53:40] it clear but maybe maybe next week I
[1:53:42] mean Sunday evening I'll make it even
[1:53:44] more clear but we're we're at a place
[1:53:46] right now if you know seals and some of
[1:53:49] the church ages and what they with stood
[1:53:51] and what went on during that time time
[1:53:52] you would see this thing moving right in
[1:53:54] just by the way Delila is saying things
[1:53:57] and and what's being taking place what's
[1:54:00] taking
[1:54:02] place and understand those three steps
[1:54:05] came up to the for point and what
[1:54:06] happened we went in into to to to such a
[1:54:10] such a age of murdering killing and you
[1:54:13] know and we're getting ready to see that
[1:54:15] come again no not in America no not just
[1:54:18] in America all the whole world anybody
[1:54:21] nobody won get in the way you know I
[1:54:24] mean I mean I
[1:54:26] uh Obama said this thing is coming
[1:54:30] nobody will be able to resist it he said
[1:54:33] it nobody will be able to resist it no
[1:54:38] matter what but he don't know about the
[1:54:43] bride you see we'll resist it we've been
[1:54:46] ordained to resist it we'll come down to
[1:54:49] the last little moment but at that
[1:54:52] moment will be
[1:54:54] changed yes sir yes sir we got a promise
[1:54:57] y'all

[1:55:56] didn't even understand didn't
[1:55:59] know it was a mystery to the Philistines
[1:56:02] it was a mystery to Samson but as the
[1:56:05] hair grew the strength the courage grew
[1:56:10] with him and father he began to see
[1:56:14] himself way off of the
[1:56:18] promise and all he could do is say Lord
[1:56:22] once
[1:56:23] more don't let this church go
[1:56:26] down as a laughing
[1:56:29] star but may she be
[1:56:32] raised to complete
[1:56:34] victory over the Demonic powers of this
[1:56:38] age they've made moery of this message
[1:56:41] Lord they brought confusion in this
[1:56:44] message but father you say that you've
[1:56:46] never left himself yourself without
[1:56:49] awak there is a part of Samson that
[1:56:52] still lives amen though he may be
[1:56:55] blind though may be confused he can't
