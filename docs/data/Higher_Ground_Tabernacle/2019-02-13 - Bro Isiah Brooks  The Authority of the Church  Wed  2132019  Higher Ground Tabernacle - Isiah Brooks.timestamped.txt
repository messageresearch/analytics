[24:33] [Music]
[24:37] e-everything oh I want y'all to know
[24:46] tonight that no matter how tough the
[24:50] devil try to be he's actually afraid of
[24:57] you that's why he worked so hard to keep
[25:03] you from knowing who you are and the
[25:06] authority in which you had a half he is
[25:11] a liar and we know him according to the
[25:15] Word of God as a defeated foe and
[25:19] there's nothing he can do about it he is
[25:23] ordained to be defeated and we are
[25:27] ordained to be winners so we thank God
[25:31] for the victory in which he has given me
[25:34] over these past few days I could have
[25:38] been in glory but God said no I could
[25:43] have been afflicted in such a way that I
[25:48] would not have been able to perhaps
[25:50] preach the gospel anymore but God said
[25:53] no I think I for my wife under the
[25:56] inspiration of the Holy Ghost plus
[25:59] desperation and she called and by the
[26:04] 9-1-1 and because of it I stand today
[26:07] the Lord works in mysterious ways
[26:10] we met a doctor today who we connected
[26:16] with the doctor who actually injected my
[26:21] eye which was a standard procedure the
[26:26] man was very humble he explained to us
[26:32] this is what he normally does but I
[26:34] happen to be one of those people that
[26:39] Satan got in there and tried to really
[26:41] mess things up nevertheless we serve a
[26:46] God
[26:47] and he saw everything and I believe that
[26:50] everything that we do we must be mindful
[26:54] of God acknowledge God in all our ways
[26:57] and he shall direct our paths so we
[27:02] thank God for the grace of God what is
[27:08] awesome about the situation demand the
[27:11] doctor being a Christian told us that he
[27:15] would take care of whatever bill we will
[27:18] would incur or whatever is left over he
[27:22] would take care of him so we thank God
[27:25] he showed us where you really didn't
[27:28] have to do it but he did it and he said
[27:31] let this be my tithe into the church so
[27:35] we think are for his amazing grace God
[27:42] and I honestly I am supposed to go back
[27:48] within four weeks five but nevertheless
[27:51] when I when he see me it's gonna be
[27:53] complete nothing else will have
[27:56] necessary to be done have to be done I I
[27:59] believe that all God joined us together
[28:01] for a purpose and I believe the purpose
[28:05] is for this message I so love the Lord
[28:09] I just want to please him I just have
[28:15] this thing about me I just want to
[28:16] please him and I thank God for the
[28:20] saints of God all the prayers that have
[28:22] gone up for me some people have had it
[28:26] had it so bad out there that I'm near
[28:29] death or dying they had done already
[28:31] called a family of course that was not
[28:34] the way it was and I thank God for it
[28:39] seemed like there was something else I
[28:41] wanted to say but let's go on with the
[28:44] word as we stand we're going to come
[28:49] from Acts the first chapter
[28:58] axé the first chapter the eighth verse
[29:06] and then we're going to come from
[29:09] Ephesians three my subject tonight is
[29:15] the authority of the church the
[29:18] authority of the church you know brother
[29:23] Branham says don't let the devil make
[29:28] you feel like you've lost your
[29:31] experience and that really blessed my
[29:35] soul because we do go through trials and
[29:39] that's one of the things that Satan will
[29:42] accuse you of or tell you see you don't
[29:45] lost your experience you you really you
[29:48] know your you ain't saying but let me
[29:51] tell you that is alive from the devil
[29:54] when a man follows romans 8 9 and 10
[29:58] confessed with his mouth and believe in
[30:00] his heart receiving the Lord Jesus
[30:04] Christ as his Savior the Bible said at
[30:06] that point he passed from death unto
[30:08] life and we get believing or not no
[30:12] matter what your behavior is from that
[30:14] point on if you sincerely comes to
[30:18] Christ he promise you'll never lose lose
[30:21] you you'll come up you'll be out in the
[30:26] outer court you'll be a you won't be in
[30:28] the city but you'll be there but most of
[30:32] us we want to not just be there see
[30:35] right if we we are we want to be in the
[30:39] city in the city call to live in the
[30:43] city that's a good message in let me go
[30:48] on yeah yeah listen brother brother
[30:51] Keith told me this and listen to it why
[30:55] are people so tossed about you ought to
[30:58] go listen to it and thoroughly listen
[30:59] it's really really good I've been
[31:02] blessed by it acts 1 and 8 but ye shall
[31:09] receive power after the Holy Ghost is
[31:12] calm
[31:12] upon you and ye shall be witnesses unto
[31:16] me both in Jerusalem in all Judea and in
[31:19] Samaria and unto the uttermost part of
[31:23] the earth Ephesians 3 beginning at the
[31:29] fourteenth verse for this cause I bow my
[31:33] knee unto the father of our Lord Jesus
[31:36] Christ of whom the whole family in
[31:39] heaven and earth is named that he would
[31:42] grant you according to the riches of his
[31:45] glory to be strengthened with might by
[31:47] his spirit in the inner man that Christ
[31:51] may dwell in your hearts by faith that
[31:54] ye being rooted and grounded in love may
[31:57] be able to comprehend with All Saints
[32:00] what is the breadth and length and death
[32:03] and height and to know the love of
[32:06] Christ with pass it's knowledge that you
[32:09] might be filled with all the fullness of
[32:11] God now unto him that is able to do
[32:15] exceedingly abundantly above all that we
[32:18] ask or think according to the power that
[32:21] worketh in us now I must say that again
[32:24] because once life is sprung up in you
[32:27] that's God and that God is able to sin
[32:32] do exceedingly abundantly above all that
[32:36] we ask or think and it's a Satan's
[32:38] business it is his job to make us think
[32:41] that God will not do it for us or you in
[32:45] particular it's all right he can do it
[32:47] for others but not me I'm just too
[32:50] sinful I'm too unworthy I'm too well God
[32:54] saw that that's why we have a savior
[32:57] hallelujah now into him that is able to
[33:01] exceedingly abundantly above all that we
[33:03] ask or think according to the power that
[33:05] worketh continue to work in us unto Him
[33:09] be glory in the church by Christ Jesus
[33:12] throughout all ages that mean our age is
[33:15] included world without end amen
[33:18] you may be seated I'm sorry let us pray
[33:23] Heavenly Father God we come before you
[33:25] with
[33:26] thank you for your grace and your mercy
[33:27] we thank you for being so good to us we
[33:30] pray that you will impart this word unto
[33:32] us give us what we stand in need of in
[33:35] Jesus Christ's name we pray amen and
[33:42] when I when I think about how the church
[33:49] let's say church history I'm not talking
[33:54] about denominations I'm talking about
[33:56] the church individuals those who have
[34:00] been born of God those who came through
[34:05] hard times and trials and tests as I was
[34:10] speaking with brother Troy this has been
[34:14] a season of tests strong tests but all
[34:21] of these tests are for us God doesn't
[34:25] send these tests to give us put us in
[34:30] the atmosphere of unbelief but he's
[34:33] pushing and driving and and and doing
[34:37] all he can that we may gain faith
[34:40] muscles muscles to to believe that we
[34:45] can go into the Holies of Holies because
[34:48] so many of us don't believe that we can
[34:51] get there but I heard brother Branham
[34:54] said we have a right it is our right
[34:58] healing is our right salvation is our
[35:02] right right so going into the Holies of
[35:06] Holies is our right it is there for us
[35:11] the curtain was rent
[35:14] the veil was rent in twain right and all
[35:18] we need to do is walk in there why
[35:22] because according to hebrews jesus
[35:25] christ has already gone into the veil is
[35:30] that all right and so therefore if he
[35:33] has opened that way to us it is our
[35:36] responsibility to go into
[35:39] Holies of Holies and stay there and once
[35:44] we are in the Holies of Holies so so you
[35:46] can understand you can go in there and
[35:49] you can come out of there right but the
[35:53] prophet of God said we need to go in
[35:55] there and shut the curtains behind us
[35:58] that means closing our eyes to the world
[36:03] it means becoming dead to the world and
[36:07] the things that are of the world I can't
[36:10] help but to think even today in the day
[36:14] before how the Bible tells us that if
[36:17] the love of the world is in you the love
[36:20] of God is not and then God sent the
[36:24] property and said if a speck of the
[36:26] world is in you the love of God is not
[36:30] and I'm saying these things not in a
[36:33] critical way but I want you to examine
[36:35] yourself I want you to see where or
[36:38] where you're standing tonight because
[36:40] you are either in the holy place the
[36:44] outer court the holy place are the
[36:47] Holies of Holies and when you're in the
[36:50] outer court you're Christian when you're
[36:53] in the inner court you're Christian when
[36:56] you in the Holy hole of Holies you are
[36:58] Christian when you become a Christian
[37:01] you become a Christian eternally hello
[37:04] that's what the Bible said you have
[37:06] passed from death unto life but listen
[37:10] what good what what what trophies will
[37:13] we receive what we Wars where we receive
[37:16] if we are in the outer Court Christian
[37:21] if we are just in the inner court right
[37:26] the candlesticks we can call and name
[37:29] every prophet but understand just like
[37:32] the lights went out for the Lutheran's
[37:34] the lights went out for the Methodists
[37:37] hello and the lights can go out in this
[37:41] age if you allow it to but that light
[37:45] those selling lights were not there to
[37:48] place us in darkness those seven lights
[37:51] were there to give light
[37:53] to us that we may be able to go from
[37:57] that court into the inner them the most
[38:00] holy of holy court and you and I must
[38:05] understand it all depends we must
[38:07] understand that God ain't joking we can
[38:12] say what I can't do it I can't make
[38:14] myself desperate I can't make myself
[38:17] love God but one thing for certain if
[38:21] you don't feed on the word you're going
[38:25] to get weak if you don't listen to the
[38:28] tapes you're going to get weak and I
[38:32] know for a fact it's sometimes a battle
[38:34] not every day but there's a battle when
[38:37] I listen to a tape or listen to music or
[38:41] it's it's always something trying to
[38:44] battle me keep me rather from listening
[38:49] to the word or reading the word of
[38:51] praying the word praying to the word and
[38:54] you and I must realize they meant that's
[38:56] the devil the devil always make himself
[38:59] real but do we realize that's what it is
[39:03] sometimes we might think oh I'm just
[39:06] lazy or I'm backslidden and if you
[39:08] confess you're backsliding you're
[39:10] backslidden
[39:11] whatever you say out of this mouth is
[39:13] what you become hallelujah and the thing
[39:18] that we must do tonight is repent from
[39:21] all of the negative things that have
[39:23] come at our mouth concerning our
[39:25] salvation you and I must repeat from the
[39:29] murmuring and complaining when God is
[39:32] leading us you and I couldn't have a a
[39:35] greater leader than the Holy Ghost it is
[39:38] the Holy Ghost as leading us and guiding
[39:41] us is that right and the Bible tells us
[39:44] he's a good shepherd you and I have been
[39:48] placed in this age not to stay in a
[39:51] pillow Coster RAM but we have been
[39:54] placed in this age to go into the Holies
[39:56] of Holies
[39:57] somebody's gonna do it God has never
[40:01] left himself without a witness somebody
[40:03] is gonna do it somebody is going to
[40:06] accomplish it
[40:07] and you need to say I am that one don't
[40:11] look at circumstances God looks at
[40:14] confessions if you can confess I am a
[40:20] champion you can confess I am bride if
[40:24] you can confess I'm more than a
[40:26] conqueror don't look at your failures
[40:29] you need to give the Holy Ghost
[40:32] something to work with and God can't
[40:36] work with negatives
[40:37] he needs positive everything must come
[40:41] in a positive way I am you never you
[40:44] never God said you know I might be he
[40:47] said I am and you and I must speak the
[40:50] eye and language right not the devil's
[40:55] language I am I am this I am bride I am
[40:59] more than a conquerer I am and I can say
[41:03] it like this I will accomplish what God
[41:08] has set before me I am a saint that will
[41:15] and shall and am will die in the Holies
[41:22] of Holies
[41:23] you got to confess it is that right
[41:26] when David faced Goliath he said listen
[41:29] the devil tried to say I'm gonna kill
[41:32] you I'm gonna do this I'm gonna do that
[41:35] and then David said who is this
[41:36] uncircumcised Philistine huh
[41:40] you're not even or God but I'm gonna
[41:43] tell you I know I am and I am and I will
[41:47] cut your head off this day I love David
[41:50] because he didn't even have a sword to
[41:52] cut his head off with so he use
[41:54] Goliath's sword to bring the word to
[41:57] pass so you and I must realize we have
[42:00] an authority and as we say an authority
[42:04] is not tough like calm I got I said
[42:07] using some kind of witchcraft or some
[42:10] kind of negative power Authority means
[42:14] that I have the the power or the the
[42:17] right to speak a word and you must obey
[42:21] for an example the policeman may be a
[42:25] little small
[42:26] what type of person but if he's got the
[42:29] badge
[42:30] he's got the uniform on guess what he
[42:33] has an authority over you and you
[42:36] respect that authority why because if
[42:39] you don't you are in trouble see so even
[42:43] the underworld knows that Jesus is God
[42:46] of the living and the dead peepers know
[42:49] the Bible said at the name of Jesus
[42:52] demons tremble hallelujah and that is
[42:56] why the devil do not want us to go into
[42:59] this Holies of Holies because when we
[43:02] get into the Holies of Holies we become
[43:04] the full name of God I was saying again
[43:08] when you get into the Holies of Holies
[43:11] you become the full name of God is that
[43:17] right as he is we are in this present
[43:22] world and the devil don't want us to
[43:25] achieve that name because he realized
[43:28] that when this name of Christ is
[43:30] completed in you he must bow who you
[43:36] don't you know you've never seen brother
[43:38] and I'm screaming at a demon he just
[43:41] said come out of you never seen Jesus
[43:43] screaming at a demon no he didn't half
[43:47] the hollow that demon heard him come on
[43:50] Solari
[43:51] listen Lazarus was dead for four days
[43:54] somewhere
[43:56] and Jesus said Lazarus come forth he was
[44:00] dead his body was dead his his natural
[44:03] body couldn't hear but that
[44:06] uh-uh-uh-uh-uh that name the power of
[44:10] that name before he was even crucified
[44:13] went wherever Lazarus was and brought
[44:16] him back that's the power of the name of
[44:20] Jesus Christ that is why the Bible said
[44:24] the whole family of heaven and earth is
[44:27] named after him neither is there
[44:30] salvation in any other for there is no
[44:32] other name
[44:33] given among men whereby what about we
[44:36] must be saved other than the name of
[44:38] Jesus Christ so it's that name y'all
[44:41] understand what I'm saying
[44:42] see this divine nature is the very
[44:46] character of his name you understand me
[44:51] oh you see a pig it's gonna be a pig I
[44:56] don't care how much you uh-uh-uh-uh
[45:00] dress him up he is a pig he's carrying
[45:04] the nature of the pea right remember
[45:08] jesus said go tell Herod that old Fox
[45:12] because by nature he was a fox he did
[45:17] the things that a fox would do see and
[45:20] so you must understand when you get the
[45:23] nature of God on the inside of you you
[45:26] become God on earth because God is in
[45:30] you on earth you have he quickened who
[45:37] were dead in trespasses and sins where
[45:41] in time past ye walked according to the
[45:43] course of the world according to the
[45:45] Prince of the power of the air the
[45:46] spirit that now worketh in the children
[45:48] of disobedience all of us know that and
[45:51] whom also we had our conversation in
[45:54] time past in the lusts of our flesh
[45:56] fulfilling the desires and of the flesh
[45:59] and of the mind and we were by nature
[46:01] the children of Wrath even as others we
[46:04] know that we know the nature that was in
[46:06] us there was nothing good about us we
[46:09] did wicked things because we were wicked
[46:12] that was the nature of the world even
[46:15] though the seed of God was in us that's
[46:17] why we hated it
[46:19] we wheat there's a time in our life that
[46:22] we did not have pleasure in those things
[46:24] anymore you know why because God
[46:27] quickened something in you
[46:29] it was always God and it will always be
[46:33] God huh look what look what Ephesians
[46:37] said Paul says guess what this was he
[46:39] said but God who is rich in mercy for
[46:44] his great love wherewith he loved us Eve
[46:47] we were what dead in sins have quickened
[46:51] us together with Christ by grace ye are
[46:54] saved hallelujah and have raised us up
[46:59] together and made us sit together in
[47:02] heavenly places in Christ Jesus that in
[47:05] the ages to come he might show the
[47:08] exceeding riches of His grace in his
[47:11] kindness toward us through Christ Jesus
[47:14] for by grace you are saved through faith
[47:18] and not of yourselves hello
[47:21] that's what you must understand you
[47:24] cannot save yourself but if you are led
[47:27] by the Holy Ghost he will lead and guide
[47:31] you into the Holies of Holies cuz he is
[47:35] the only one you know what brother
[47:37] Branham I just read it he talks about
[47:40] that pillar fire everybody in in
[47:44] different in these different ages did
[47:46] not even have the ability of doctor let
[47:49] me ask you a quick time oh jeez no
[47:51] brother says whatever you do stay away
[47:52] from the pillar of fire but you know
[47:56] what he was working with trying people
[47:58] trying to be a prophet you see but the
[48:01] pillar of fire instance Shekinah glory
[48:04] what are you thinking here the pillar of
[48:07] fire is this a kind of God that's the
[48:10] life that's the light that was behind
[48:12] the veil that was what covered Adam and
[48:16] Eve it was the Shekinah glory does
[48:20] somebody help me here so we are supposed
[48:23] to press into the Shekinah glory that is
[48:27] our privilege it is our right to go
[48:31] there is that okay but it's true it's
[48:40] true read your message I sometimes
[48:43] wonder where people listening what are
[48:45] they listening to we're not trying to be
[48:49] something that we're not will Braun
[48:53] Eagles you don't stay a baby eagle you
[48:57] grow up you become a for maturity go
[49:01] right and that's what this whole thing
[49:04] about is about that you and I may become
[49:06] a fool mature and a Christian and
[49:09] Christians mean to be christ-like and
[49:11] because you Christ like that means the
[49:14] same spirit is Bible says if that same
[49:16] spirit being you that was also in Christ
[49:19] Jesus
[49:19] Heller the same some kind of glory only
[49:22] inside of Jesus Christ is what made him
[49:25] what he was and is and that same
[49:30] Shekinah glory that shank same pillar
[49:34] fire is supposed to live within you it's
[49:38] not I that live but Christ that lives in
[49:41] me not of works lest any man should
[49:46] boast hello how many times I was telling
[49:49] to my brother I said I fasted many days
[49:51] at times and I'm not boasting I have
[49:53] fasted I have prayed all night at times
[49:56] I have prayed hours after times and
[49:59] things of that nature but it doesn't
[50:01] come by doing that even though though we
[50:04] supposed to do that you know when it
[50:06] comes by the grace of God it comes by
[50:09] what their leadership of the Holy Spirit
[50:12] not by my power not by might but by my
[50:16] spirit saith the Lord it's all God it
[50:21] will always be God we just blessed
[50:24] because he chose to work with us yeah
[50:32] for we are his workmanship are you his
[50:35] workmanship that means God ain't through
[50:38] with me yet he's working on us and he
[50:43] ain't through with us yet and one thing
[50:46] I love about this craftsman he does not
[50:49] give up on his work he is faithful to
[50:52] complete that would he have be gone in
[50:56] you and me oh I feel like shouting but
[50:59] I'm trying to take my time see for we
[51:03] are his workmanship created we're in
[51:05] Christ Jesus unto
[51:08] good works that means you gotta be in
[51:10] him and he's got to be in you that's the
[51:12] only way he can work get it he can't
[51:15] build somewhere no you got to be in him
[51:18] and he must be in you the first work
[51:21] starts in you and that in you brings you
[51:25] into him you understand me he first
[51:28] comes in you and that in you begins to
[51:32] work in you inside out right to bring
[51:36] you into him hallelujah that's why the
[51:41] high priest was the only one that could
[51:43] actually go behind the veil so you and I
[51:47] must be in the high priest we must be in
[51:53] the high priest is that right brother
[51:56] Branham said it like this he said the
[51:58] bride of Jesus Christ is the blood of
[52:00] Jesus Christ by the spirit his spirit so
[52:05] the Holy Ghost in us makes us priests
[52:07] and kings Oh somebody help me here for
[52:14] we are his workmanship created in Christ
[52:16] Jesus unto good works which God hath
[52:19] before ordained that we should walk in
[52:21] them the battle is not over per se in
[52:28] this world sometimes we think oh I can't
[52:31] go any further or lord have mercy all of
[52:35] the things that's coming at me right now
[52:37] I I just feel like so renin and my
[52:39] question is what do you surrender up to
[52:42] you know nothing can satisfy you like
[52:45] Jesus you never love anything because
[52:49] you don't taste it of him you can never
[52:52] taste anything that tastes better than
[52:54] Jesus Christ hey somebody help me so you
[53:00] got to realize Amen that you and I must
[53:02] have this revelation of ourselves that
[53:05] you and I have been chosen and elected
[53:07] to go into the Holies of Holies hmm is
[53:14] that right
[53:14] our high priest could not just be in
[53:16] high priest he had to be chosen and
[53:19] elected
[53:21] right and you must understand that every
[53:25] office of God is chosen and elected by
[53:27] God you didn't choose to be there that
[53:29] gift was given to you before the
[53:32] foundation of the world and if God has
[53:35] called you to be bride it doesn't make
[53:37] any difference how long it takes he's
[53:40] gonna bring you there is that right oh
[53:44] it's the truth
[53:45] sometimes it takes a long time for a
[53:48] real Christian to understand that he was
[53:51] really born to be one is that right look
[53:56] look look you know throughout all the
[53:58] history all look what can't God then
[54:00] just choose virgins to do his will he
[54:05] had prostitutes that did his will huh
[54:08] he had women who who engaged in incest
[54:13] and they were all part of him why
[54:18] because he chose it to be so so that you
[54:22] and I can see no matter what kind of
[54:24] form and style of life we had before the
[54:27] word was quickening us hallelujah uh-huh
[54:31] we still was chosen of God to do his
[54:34] perfect will God is the only one that
[54:37] can transform a man and a woman and make
[54:40] them virgins
[54:44] is that right remember you saw her
[54:47] brother was how could I be a virgin
[54:48] remember Matthew 25 only calls for
[54:52] virgins thigh were wise and five words
[54:56] foolish and you answered to that call
[55:01] so God called you a virgin you didn't
[55:05] call yourself that God said it is that
[55:10] right Jeremiah your prophet God Jeremih
[55:12] understand after I'm a prophet no God
[55:14] called him a prophet and because you and
[55:19] I heard this message God said you're a
[55:21] virgin
[55:22] you're a virgin right if I were wiser I
[55:25] was foolish now what are you when you
[55:29] see this this light when you see this
[55:32] light this light is guiding you lead
[55:35] you into something you following this
[55:37] message right you following this message
[55:40] because this message will lead you into
[55:42] the Holies of Holies keep eating on that
[55:45] word is that right
[55:46] hallelujah keeps feeding on the way or
[55:48] keep believing that word keep applying
[55:50] that word amen and the Holy Ghost in you
[55:54] will make the change yeah
[55:58] the Holy Ghost will I feel the presence
[56:00] of the Lord tonight the Holy Ghost will
[56:03] make the change but whatever you do I
[56:05] don't care how bad you feel I don't care
[56:08] what the devil say you are never stop
[56:10] feeding on the word feed yourself
[56:13] strengthen yourself and God will do the
[56:16] quickening is that right absolutely
[56:20] they're old Lord understand the
[56:25] revelation of this Bible this is the
[56:26] only we live Christians live not by
[56:30] education of the Bible we live by
[56:34] revelation of the Bible because in that
[56:37] Bible it revealed the Bible reveals to
[56:41] us who we are hallelujah now think about
[56:45] it
[56:45] Davis said his mercies endure forever he
[56:50] said they are renewed every morning see
[56:55] so the devil is already defeated he
[56:57] didn't say his grace is greatest Ange
[57:00] but his mercies when you guilty and
[57:04] you're wrong hallelujah and that mercy
[57:07] never runs out renewed every morning no
[57:13] matter how much time you Yami the times
[57:15] you see in a day tomorrow is a fresh pot
[57:17] o go to God David knew what he was
[57:23] talking about he knew so I'm saying all
[57:28] these things so that you can understand
[57:29] that God does not haphazard ly save us
[57:34] the Bible said he saves us to the
[57:37] uttermost he he's not just saying oh our
[57:43] hope it happens oh he's already done it
[57:47] it is a finish
[57:48] worth about said even before the world
[57:50] he said in from the beginning it was
[57:52] already finished it's all our brothers
[57:55] when you said oh I got a seat up there
[57:57] already with my name on it
[58:00] nobody can take that seat it's reserved
[58:04] you've got a name you got a seat it's
[58:07] already reserved nobody can take that
[58:09] seat but you is that right
[58:12] remember that lady came to Jesus and she
[58:14] said Lord grant that one of my son sit
[58:17] on your right and hand and the left when
[58:20] you get up there he says all he said
[58:22] that's not given to me to give it's
[58:24] already given those seats are already
[58:26] taken
[58:27] huh so you got to understand that you
[58:30] are there already and nobody can take
[58:33] your place but it must be a revelant you
[58:36] got to believe this you must believe it
[58:41] hearing about your works though we work
[58:45] we work because we love him he leads us
[58:50] to work is that right jesus said i can't
[58:53] do nothing except i see the father doing
[58:55] it so god has to work and i work here
[58:58] the - right so god works so you can work
[59:04] hallelujah and so you say well what do
[59:07] you mean brother listen now you never
[59:10] know the Bible just by some cold hearted
[59:12] reading it you've got to read the Bible
[59:15] in the spirit you've got to be in the
[59:18] mood of reading you've got to love to
[59:21] read it and the Bible is written so that
[59:24] the wise smart educated will never
[59:28] understand it Jesus thank God is that
[59:31] father I thank thee that thou has hid
[59:34] these things from the wise and the
[59:36] prudent and will reveal them to be such
[59:39] as we'll learn oh I'm so glad that you
[59:44] don't have to be somebody in this world
[59:47] to know God you just have to have a
[59:50] willing heart and God will go to dealing
[59:54] with that willing heart if you are
[59:57] willing whoa everybody gotta have a
[1:00:00] willing heart in here he said
[1:00:02] got a willing heart come on somebody you
[1:00:05] would have never gotten this far without
[1:00:07] that willing heart hmm the strength of
[1:00:11] the Holy Spirit should be in every
[1:00:13] member in the church what do you mean
[1:00:16] strength the power of the resurrection
[1:00:19] the light that Jesus gave for the church
[1:00:22] should be operating in every member of
[1:00:25] it the body the strength salt will only
[1:00:28] save if it's couldn't if it contacts but
[1:00:32] it must contact and if the church get
[1:00:35] that burden on their heart to contact
[1:00:37] someone get someone saved then the
[1:00:40] strength coming back into the church
[1:00:42] again and into the people now a minister
[1:00:46] could not bring a revival there is no
[1:00:48] great preacher can bring revival he does
[1:00:51] he doesn't pack it with him and the only
[1:00:54] thing he can do is just be lawyer to God
[1:00:57] and his work and the revival has to come
[1:01:00] by the people in your home in your life
[1:01:05] now remember about shooting now revival
[1:01:09] isn't adding new members to the church
[1:01:10] is reviving that which we we've already
[1:01:14] got to revive me to bring back is that
[1:01:19] right so the preacher can't bring it no
[1:01:21] matter how much you try it has to be the
[1:01:24] people in the church it has to be the
[1:01:27] family of God
[1:01:29] we must we must press to be United and
[1:01:32] knitted together and as long as the
[1:01:39] enemy can keep us all with our separate
[1:01:43] programs he's God is defeated because
[1:01:46] the house divided cannot stand one thing
[1:01:49] about the early church they had one goal
[1:01:51] and that was to make the world see that
[1:01:53] Jesus Christ is alive and well
[1:01:57] hallelujah and you and I can see how the
[1:02:00] this bride this church that we call
[1:02:03] bride and then they come up with so many
[1:02:05] different doctrines oh oh you got to do
[1:02:07] this and you got to do that you know
[1:02:09] after a while they'd say you know uh uh
[1:02:11] uh yeah I don't know what they're gonna
[1:02:13] say next but my point is it is a destroy
[1:02:16] action from the devil we think that all
[1:02:21] because I believe this that's gonna save
[1:02:23] me oh no sure whether I clap on beat or
[1:02:28] clap off beat that's not what saves me
[1:02:33] where is that in the Bible but the Bible
[1:02:35] only said nothing about clapping on the
[1:02:37] left or the right
[1:02:37] he said clap your hands all you people
[1:02:40] shout with the voice of triumph that's
[1:02:43] what it is and now people say oh you
[1:02:46] gotta clap only and if you clap off beat
[1:02:49] that's what the devil where is that in
[1:02:52] the scripture where did brother Branham
[1:02:55] ever say that huh never said it what
[1:03:00] about a man or woman who don't have
[1:03:01] rhythm they clapped whatever whenever
[1:03:04] they won't do it was just that stuff
[1:03:09] that people want to add and they don't
[1:03:12] know when they add to it they literally
[1:03:14] are cutting themselves out of the
[1:03:16] rapture not that they might be lost no
[1:03:21] no no they'll be say but because they
[1:03:24] add they must suffer the plagues that's
[1:03:26] coming on the world and you and I must
[1:03:29] understand that we have the authority we
[1:03:32] have the power God says go into that
[1:03:34] Holies of Holies don't you stop for
[1:03:37] nothing I don't care if you got a crawl
[1:03:39] in there slide in there wounded and you
[1:03:42] can barely make it but get in there how
[1:03:45] it's your privilege is what God desire
[1:03:49] of you that divine nature is what God
[1:03:52] wants to see he wants to see all of us
[1:03:55] declare is no longer I that live but
[1:03:58] Christ that lives in us that's what he
[1:04:01] was not just some kind of a church
[1:04:05] hallelujah is that okay you and I must
[1:04:09] understand that we have a strength but
[1:04:11] many of us fall to Delilah like like
[1:04:14] Samson right we all go through it but
[1:04:18] God is already saying all you got to do
[1:04:20] is cry out over the Lord ones law Samson
[1:04:23] couldn't change who he was and let me
[1:04:26] tell you something no matter how bad you
[1:04:28] seem to be or how bad you
[1:04:29] think you are if God don't call you to
[1:04:32] be Brides there is no quitting in you
[1:04:34] you can't help it you gonna throw us
[1:04:38] you're gonna hunger you gonna call on
[1:04:40] his name Amen even though both your eyes
[1:04:43] have been put out God's gonna have that
[1:04:45] thing in your heart were you gonna call
[1:04:48] on him and you're gonna gain the victory
[1:04:51] see and the thing that I love about it
[1:04:57] Samson was wasn't some big bulky man he
[1:05:01] was a little shrimp a man maybe a little
[1:05:04] curly head and look like a little
[1:05:05] but one thing he has seven full power he
[1:05:11] had seven locks Amen that represented
[1:05:15] those seven virtues which are eight with
[1:05:16] God right because it was God who came
[1:05:21] and anointed his strength
[1:05:22] hello come on somebody it wasn't his
[1:05:26] hand the Covenant was the hair but
[1:05:30] because he had the hair and then God
[1:05:32] could anoint him that's why the or don't
[1:05:38] let no woman cut you here you gonna lose
[1:05:40] your strength that's nothing that ain't
[1:05:42] it the power wasn't in the hair the
[1:05:46] power was in God and the Covenant
[1:05:49] hallelujah and we have our unconditional
[1:05:52] covenant and the power is in that not in
[1:05:57] how much you do this how much you do
[1:05:59] that it is the Covenant it is what God
[1:06:02] determined to put before us it will
[1:06:05] always be amazing grace hallelujah think
[1:06:11] about it now man you might not think
[1:06:14] much of yourself but you're the kind of
[1:06:16] man God can use you're the kind of
[1:06:18] person that God can use because when
[1:06:21] Samson knew it went him there was no
[1:06:24] scientist to say look at this man he can
[1:06:27] carry those barn doors right he could
[1:06:30] take the gates of Gaza no that wasn't a
[1:06:33] man that was an anointing that was a
[1:06:37] power that was God hallelujah
[1:06:41] that's why Paul said it like this we can
[1:06:45] do all things through Christ with who
[1:06:48] strengthens us ah that I can do a whole
[1:06:53] thing no you leave that out then you
[1:06:56] leave that other part out you done it is
[1:06:58] Christ who strengtheneth us continue to
[1:07:02] strengthen us that's why we're able to
[1:07:04] stand here later see you mm-hmm
[1:07:10] lord have mercy it's just okay you know
[1:07:13] because I want you to know you have an
[1:07:14] authority but until you must accept it
[1:07:17] you must accept it right you know it's
[1:07:23] like a pasture I'm a pastor I gotta ask
[1:07:26] you can I do this can I do that what are
[1:07:28] you talking about you're the pastor you
[1:07:30] tell me right Oh policemen it'll stop
[1:07:35] you from but can I give you a ticket
[1:07:37] can I - I'm gonna give you a ticket I
[1:07:41] have the authority to do that that's me
[1:07:43] that's who I am
[1:07:44] you are the Bride of Christ you are the
[1:07:46] children of God you're not a saint and
[1:07:49] you have a right by the spoken word to
[1:07:54] call tell that devil God says no right
[1:07:59] you got to be sick and tired of being
[1:08:01] sick and tired huh you got to do that
[1:08:05] hey man how many times when desperation
[1:08:10] strikes listen let me tell you something
[1:08:12] the devil like I said he tried to take
[1:08:14] me out but there was no fear I don't
[1:08:16] fear being lost
[1:08:17] I'm saved right I know where I'm going
[1:08:21] and you know doesn't matter what he
[1:08:25] tries to do I get up have y'all noticed
[1:08:27] that but it's not by my power it's not
[1:08:32] by my mind is by His Holy Spirit Satan
[1:08:37] came dude he can attack me gotta give
[1:08:39] him time to do things but he can't stop
[1:08:41] the Commission he can't stop and that's
[1:08:43] with you - whatever God is ordain you to
[1:08:47] do you're going to do it it will happen
[1:08:52] it will happen
[1:08:55] just like I we told that that preacher
[1:08:59] not the preacher the doctor today you
[1:09:02] know Keith went with me and it's true
[1:09:04] God ordained this here I go into this
[1:09:08] doctor several times didn't even know he
[1:09:10] was a Christian and he didn't know I was
[1:09:12] a pastor because thing was moving so
[1:09:13] fast we couldn't talk to each other but
[1:09:15] today we talked to each other and found
[1:09:18] out we were brothers you understand me
[1:09:23] nothing works in vain
[1:09:25] nothing is in vain everything has a
[1:09:28] purpose and when God causes all allow
[1:09:32] Satan to do thing he said what brother
[1:09:35] looks I don't fully understand it let me
[1:09:37] take you to the scripture so you will
[1:09:39] write God told Naomi and her husband and
[1:09:44] all them y'all y'all y'all going down to
[1:09:47] Moab you said it wasn't God it was God
[1:09:51] whether they heard that voice or not
[1:09:53] something drove them down other than the
[1:09:57] family cuz everybody didn't leave his
[1:10:01] Bethlehem and then and Israel everybody
[1:10:04] didn't leave but Naomi a husband they
[1:10:08] left hello and they went down there and
[1:10:13] God hand was in it because Ruth was
[1:10:17] there you understand me
[1:10:20] Ruth was there and she was a vital part
[1:10:23] of God's thinking and listen Naomi and
[1:10:29] her husband they perhaps felt
[1:10:31] backslidden and everything else and in
[1:10:35] the natural I they were but when you are
[1:10:39] chosen of God backslidden or not you
[1:10:43] saved brother books you better be
[1:10:46] careful it is true if God has already
[1:10:53] chosen you to be saved you're saved
[1:10:56] nothing can stop that it's never been
[1:10:59] what you do it's always been what he
[1:11:02] does for you
[1:11:07] now he wants you to do right he wants
[1:11:10] you to tell tell everybody about him
[1:11:12] right is that right come on somebody saw
[1:11:14] messed up and Saul wasn't even God's
[1:11:18] choosing it was people chose Saul
[1:11:21] because he looked and stood tall and at
[1:11:27] the end of the day he messed up and
[1:11:29] guess what God saved him hello
[1:11:32] come look at Solomon Solomon was God's
[1:11:37] choice and at the end of the day Solomon
[1:11:42] messed up are you gonna see him there
[1:11:45] absolutely
[1:11:46] Oh what are you saying what I'm saying
[1:11:50] who's gonna lay in a charge of God's
[1:11:52] elect it is God who elects you and it's
[1:11:55] God who's chosen you it is God who saw
[1:11:59] you who you shared his blood it's real
[1:12:04] and the devil don't like it it's real
[1:12:12] he just just Dido he doesn't like this
[1:12:15] thing why because this message shared
[1:12:18] light on every aspect of God's salvation
[1:12:22] why God did this and why he did this why
[1:12:25] he allowed that and why he did this now
[1:12:27] we know they didn't know but now we know
[1:12:31] and all of this food was given to the
[1:12:34] bride so that you can see there is no
[1:12:38] possible way for the bride herself to be
[1:12:41] lost because she her name was put in the
[1:12:46] Lamb's Book of Life
[1:12:47] before the foundation of the world
[1:12:50] thousand when ever before the foundation
[1:12:53] I don't know how many eons it was before
[1:12:56] God said let there be light
[1:12:59] I don't know but my name was there he
[1:13:04] thought of you he thought of me now I'm
[1:13:06] trying to get us to see if God has
[1:13:10] shouted this thing put your name in the
[1:13:12] Lamb's Book of Life do you think God is
[1:13:14] gonna say well you know they're just not
[1:13:17] gonna make it into that Holies of Holies
[1:13:21] you know I I just might as well give up
[1:13:23] on her see you must understand the only
[1:13:27] way you make it because God won't give
[1:13:29] up on you now we might give up on him
[1:13:32] but he'll never give up on us Oh
[1:13:36] somebody he didn't he didn't he didn't
[1:13:40] just oh well um I choose them but I
[1:13:43] don't know whether they ever come up to
[1:13:46] measure he couldn't make it happen
[1:13:48] Samson failed badly in the worst way
[1:13:54] women and caring on women and Solomon
[1:13:57] did too and guess what God made it
[1:14:00] happen don't figure it out
[1:14:03] it can't be figured out it's God and you
[1:14:07] and how to thank God for His amazing
[1:14:09] grace hey I'm almost done just give me a
[1:14:13] few more minutes the Bible says though a
[1:14:17] host should encamp against me my heart
[1:14:21] shall not fear the wall shall rise
[1:14:25] against me in this will I be confident
[1:14:29] you hear what I'm saying that devil was
[1:14:31] afflicted my body but I was confident
[1:14:34] that whatever would take place next I
[1:14:37] would be okay I'm telling you there was
[1:14:42] there was no fear and that was the worst
[1:14:45] pain I ever experienced in my life I
[1:14:48] just wanted it to stop and the more I
[1:14:52] wanted it to stop the more intense it
[1:14:54] became I thought I was having a heart
[1:14:56] attack in my back because all my pain
[1:14:58] was in my back down my lower arm and
[1:15:01] everything else amen up and down my neck
[1:15:03] it was terrible
[1:15:06] and these people are asking me all these
[1:15:10] questions
[1:15:10] oh don't you know I knew all I know is I
[1:15:18] was being tested and every time
[1:15:25] something negative came out of my mouth
[1:15:27] I couldn't help but follow it I'm a
[1:15:29] apology oh I'm so sorry I said it that
[1:15:32] way I'm so sorry no you don't have to
[1:15:34] the paramedic said you don't have to
[1:15:36] apologize but even so I saw the power of
[1:15:42] pain and I thought to myself if we go
[1:15:46] through which we will some of us through
[1:15:49] a pressure or squeeze see because when
[1:15:53] the pain come all you wanted to do is
[1:15:55] just get rid of it
[1:15:56] you know I said well now I kind of have
[1:15:59] a little glimpse of what a woman feels
[1:16:01] like when she's having a baby she want
[1:16:03] the pain to stop
[1:16:05] it doesn't stop when she wants it to
[1:16:08] stop it continue on until it's
[1:16:11] accomplished what it came for y'all
[1:16:14] healing I'm saying
[1:16:15] I can understand why this woman don't
[1:16:17] want you jacking at her while she's in
[1:16:19] hey you know what you know you don't
[1:16:22] hear that you just want somebody to
[1:16:25] relieve you of what's going on here see
[1:16:28] you listen and then we look at the woman
[1:16:31] when she's screaming in Holland like man
[1:16:34] she's all out of control you've never
[1:16:36] had that kind of pain pain I respect
[1:16:39] pain now I respect pain now I know
[1:16:43] understand why people torture people cuz
[1:16:46] they tell you what when that pain hits
[1:16:48] you you want it to stop if it means I
[1:16:53] got to tell a secret to get it to stop
[1:16:56] see some people fall under desperation
[1:16:59] it's the truth it only the strong can
[1:17:02] all overcome that somebody who's strong
[1:17:04] you understand me
[1:17:06] so I'm trying to say it like this we
[1:17:08] have looked I have looked at many things
[1:17:11] in in the church foxes Book of Martyrs
[1:17:18] well you haven't suffered that pain and
[1:17:21] if it Christ ain't real you can't do it
[1:17:26] mmm is that right that's what that's
[1:17:29] what the devil says oh you don't shelter
[1:17:31] job so much just let me touch him one
[1:17:33] time just let me just let me get at him
[1:17:37] I'll prove to you hearing what he says
[1:17:39] he is God said go ahead and do it
[1:17:44] God knew
[1:17:46] that Joe can handle the pain before he
[1:17:49] job ever entered into it God knows how
[1:17:53] much you can thing is that right the
[1:17:59] scripture said he will not put no more
[1:18:01] on you than you can bear mm-hmm
[1:18:04] listen to me hurry up the Bible said
[1:18:06] that the end of the Lord and campus
[1:18:08] around about them that fear him and
[1:18:12] delivering them see when the devil was
[1:18:16] trying to take my life you know what God
[1:18:18] did he delivered me and I don't care
[1:18:21] what nobody says I know that I came
[1:18:24] through because of prayer
[1:18:26] I believe that when it was all said and
[1:18:31] done they gave me this look they said we
[1:18:34] don't have nothing to give you
[1:18:35] so we can look at these pieces pay for
[1:18:38] everything in your normal your
[1:18:40] cholesterol ain't high your blood
[1:18:41] pressure your work everything looks so
[1:18:43] good so why were you ever in here you
[1:18:47] took an old stress stance they said oh
[1:18:48] do you want that medicine nerd don't
[1:18:51] know don't give me that let me go to old
[1:18:53] time way I got on that treadmill and it
[1:18:56] seems so simple I felt like I was almost
[1:18:58] playing Fame went out I'm telling you
[1:19:05] they said they've never seen it before
[1:19:07] I want my nurses and all the time I work
[1:19:09] here I've never seen somebody come up
[1:19:12] with a hundred percent on their stress
[1:19:13] test like that that wasn't me that was
[1:19:16] God God had cured God had healed God had
[1:19:21] delivered and I wasn't stupid enough to
[1:19:23] think that I could do it it was God who
[1:19:25] did it all no weapon formed against you
[1:19:29] shall prosper it doesn't matter what it
[1:19:31] is it cannot prosper that's the word huh
[1:19:37] and the devil might set up a trap but
[1:19:40] guess what God is able to break the fall
[1:19:43] of snake whoo Jesus hmm how many I'll
[1:19:49] believe that the angel of the lord
[1:19:50] encamps out yeah I believe that do you

[1:22:50] need some reinforcement this is the
[1:22:52] worst she's ever had so we got to make
[1:22:54] sure it's the worst or you can say
[1:22:57] headache I'm speaking to you right now
[1:22:59] as a son and daughter of God you must
[1:23:04] leave and I command you to leave now if
[1:23:09] you say that with conviction and and you
[1:23:11] know what you're talking about that
[1:23:13] devil will leave before you know it I've
[1:23:18] spoken to my own body I speak to it when
[1:23:22] a pain or ache or something no no no no
[1:23:24] you can't stay up in here right with the
[1:23:27] stripes I'm healed
[1:23:31] you got to preach it
[1:23:33] you got appreciate your own body is that
[1:23:35] right that's the word Adam I have given
[1:23:38] you this garden and I want you to subdue
[1:23:40] it he had the authority over the garden
[1:23:44] that was the land you have the authority
[1:23:47] over this land you must speak to it is
[1:23:52] that the truth let me say like that like
[1:23:55] Jesus day no man take it's my life but I
[1:23:59] lay it down and guess what I'm gonna
[1:24:03] pick it up again he spoke it he spoke it
[1:24:10] he believe it and it happened why he had
[1:24:13] a scripture he could go by I will not
[1:24:16] let his flesh see corruption either way
[1:24:20] I leave his soul in hell that was the
[1:24:21] scripture you have a word that that
[1:24:26] what God heals all diseases what Moe
[1:24:30] quote did this go oh just love it I hope
[1:24:34] I can see him coming I believe there
[1:24:37] anyhow I just hope I live to see the day
[1:24:40] when I see him coming from Arizona
[1:24:42] across the world and join hands together
[1:24:45] go to meet him in the air what a day
[1:24:48] that would be my whole heart yearns for
[1:24:51] that realizing that atom bombs hydrogen
[1:24:54] bombs cobalt bombs hanging in the hangar
[1:24:57] hands of wicked enemies some fanatic
[1:25:01] could just destroy this world in a few
[1:25:04] hours and completely overnight even
[1:25:07] already got the weapons to do it with
[1:25:10] and it's just in the hands of ungodly
[1:25:13] sinful people right who would do it just
[1:25:16] just go do it with
[1:25:19] it that's all just infant infidel a
[1:25:24] Daleks and then what a day we're living
[1:25:28] in
[1:25:28] then God gets his church ready oh and we
[1:25:32] could just lay aside flesh now and open
[1:25:35] our eyes and see what God is doing now I
[1:25:37] know we've got to have things well
[1:25:40] recognize that just as fanaticism stuff
[1:25:43] rises up but remember the same things
[1:25:46] taking place just before the real Jesus
[1:25:48] appeared in the first time and we're
[1:25:51] bound to have it much more just before
[1:25:54] the appearing the second time so that'll
[1:25:58] only give life to the believer just be
[1:26:01] ready for the hour is at hand
[1:26:05] is that all right
[1:26:07] what is it when a man breaks through the
[1:26:09] veil into the Shekinah glory now the
[1:26:12] world calls him a fanatic they can't see
[1:26:16] what's wrong
[1:26:17] but behind there there is no beauty of
[1:26:20] him he might not pronounce his words
[1:26:23] right he might not dress just right he
[1:26:26] might not dress in clergy clothes she
[1:26:29] might not dress the way they think she
[1:26:31] ought to it maybe but you see inside
[1:26:35] behind that badger skin behind that
[1:26:39] humans
[1:26:40] in there if there's a kind of glory and
[1:26:42] there is the power and there is the word
[1:26:46] and there is the shewbread and the
[1:26:48] Shekinah glory which is the light that
[1:26:51] makes light that ripens grain just say
[1:26:55] that to your neighbor right listen so
[1:27:00] you and I can understand that what God
[1:27:02] is looking for we're not we can't stay
[1:27:04] here in the place that we're in we just
[1:27:09] can't stay here we've got to go further
[1:27:19] and remember the brother who said like
[1:27:22] this an accepting God's provided way he
[1:27:24] said God's Word is always what he wants
[1:27:27] to see vindicated it was priest Malachi
[1:27:33] 4 preached it but God want to see it
[1:27:35] vindicated he wants to see the people
[1:27:38] who can go into the Holies of Holies and
[1:27:40] you know what it is it's just as easy
[1:27:42] it's accepting your salvation if you
[1:27:45] accept it for you God can take you there
[1:27:52] and if you don't know how to say lord
[1:27:54] help me accept it give me faith to
[1:27:57] accept this is my calling to go into the
[1:28:01] Holies of Holies and stay there you say
[1:28:09] you've seen people that can take the
[1:28:11] word of God and they just make it live
[1:28:13] for them and others come right back with
[1:28:16] the same word and can't do nothing with
[1:28:18] it it's on conditions see it's on

[1:37:00] Cam's wife as an example she's not here
[1:37:04] I can't even think of her name right now
[1:37:06] but she just came to my mind I remember
[1:37:08] when my sister she even came here and
[1:37:10] one of her hips were lower than the
[1:37:12] other and every day she confessed with
[1:37:19] his stripes I'm healed I mean she's had
[1:37:22] three children already now you ought to
[1:37:25] see her walking now straight right
[1:37:29] little by little that hip had to obey
[1:37:32] her y'all here we don't say hey little
[1:37:36] by little that hip had to obey because
[1:37:39] she buying that spirit sometime it
[1:37:44] doesn't done you may not see it directly
[1:37:46] but remember the Prophet God said when
[1:37:48] you speak to a mountain it has to move
[1:37:51] if you believe the mountain moves that
[1:37:54] mountain up it has to obey he said it
[1:37:57] may be one grain at a time saying one
[1:38:04] loose and moving but it moves at the end
[1:38:09] of the day it has to go yeah I'm saying
[1:38:13] but you got to confess it you got to
[1:38:16] believe it you got to give the Holy
[1:38:18] Ghost something to work with the Holy
[1:38:20] Ghost can't work with negativity now he
[1:38:22] gained work with oh I don't believe in
[1:38:23] I'm not shooting all that negative stuff
[1:38:26] you gotta say I am I am I am you got to
[1:38:30] put God to work
[1:38:31] he's a positive not a negative
[1:38:35] hallelujah you said brother looks are
[1:38:37] you I have been guilty of feeding the
[1:38:40] negative atmosphere for the devil and
[1:38:42] guess what you know it's true when you
[1:38:44] feed it it grows hallelujah that's right
[1:38:53] I don't care
[1:38:55] God is the creator huh one more
[1:38:59] testimony remember the situation about
[1:39:02] the the baby with the clubfoot or
[1:39:07] whatever kind of footie hair
[1:39:08] and and and debate they had to put a
[1:39:11] prayer cloth on the baby and nothing was
[1:39:14] happening I mean the baby foot stayed
[1:39:16] the same until there was a piece of
[1:39:18] thread left
[1:39:19] that's what's all left but a piece of
[1:39:22] thread and when somebody says well it
[1:39:26] just looked like it ain't gonna happen
[1:39:27] I'm paraphrasing it reminds we'll take
[1:39:29] that piece of thread off there says no
[1:39:31] no no no we gonna leave that thread on
[1:39:34] there
[1:39:35] cuz he said it God said that foot would
[1:39:38] get well put that piece of cloth and
[1:39:41] we're gonna keep it there that was their
[1:39:44] final test and the next day when they
[1:39:47] woke up that baby foot was straight
[1:39:50] c.carter take you all the way to that
[1:39:54] last little right there when it looked
[1:39:58] like it is all over they ain't gonna
[1:40:00] happen that's when you say yes sir
[1:40:02] he said it is going to happen I believe
[1:40:08] that I don't care if you sound like a
[1:40:11] parent every day with the stripes I'm
[1:40:13] healed or if you have to say speak
[1:40:15] something every day when you wake up you
