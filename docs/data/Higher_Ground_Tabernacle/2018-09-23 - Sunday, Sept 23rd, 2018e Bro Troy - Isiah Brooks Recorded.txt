you've been somewhere amen you gotta be somewhere before you write something like that amen a man while I surely enjoyed myself this morning I trust that you did also I just I enjoy when the Lord comes and preaches a man it takes a lot of the justice it's a good time you know and and and you know I think Christ as just as good a time if not more than we do you know and the spirit rejoices just as much as we do during services like that amen amen because he's one that created rejoicing amen that's right so a man let's just bow our heads in a word of Prayer before we get started Heavenly Father we just thank you Lord so much for being who you are father for the world that you have created father for the way is Lord that you have created us to be father Laura we do not sit and say why did you make me this way or why did you make me that way Lord because we know that you have done everything for a purpose father and that purpose Lord is perfect father and we and we just think you know we were Joyce and everything to you have done father and Lord as we gather again this evening father I pray Lord that you would just open up the word once more to us Lord and and bring a second blessing father another blessing to us or we're looking our eyes are towards the Father Lord we just thank you Lord so much for for coming into this place where two or three are gathered in your name Lord or we just we just love to be where your presence is falling so are we turn the entire service over into your able hands father and we open up our hearts and say Lord speak to us just now in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen amen let's just open in our Bibles if you'll just let me pause for a second here and you remember where we were going it's one of those days were really seemed to struggle to find a certain place to go and and then right the last moment and also our coming together so let's turn over to John chapter 15 I want to speak today about Christ's joy amen do you believe the Christ had joy amen joy unspeakable and full of glory amen amen so John 15 will read there the eleventh verse and he says these things have I spoken unto you that my joy might remain in you and that your joy might be full this is my commandment that you love one another as I have loved you amen now let's go over to will stay in John we'll go over to John 17 verse 13 he says and now I come to thee and these things I speak in the world that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves amen let's just bow our heads once more in a word of Prayer Heavenly Father we just give these words over enjoyable hands father and ask that you would come down Lord it and bring out the meeting Lord you spoke them the first time Lord and we just pray that you would speak them once more here in our presence in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen you can be seated amen Christ had joy you know I think that when Christ was here he was having a good time amen you know I was a it was a lot of work he did more than any man I guess had ever done he went through a lot of things amen and but yet for all that he had a joy that was set before him Hebrews chapter 12 verse 2 says for the joy that was set before him he endured the cross amen and then when he comes there and John he starts saying Lord I follow I pray that they would have my joy the same joy that's on the inside of me would be now on the inside of them amen so the joy that he set before him he followed that joy all the way to the cross amen and so that's really that's really how he got to the cross you know there's one thing is when when when you have a situation that you are enjoying so much when you're when you're into something you're doing something or in your certain situation in life and you're just really really enjoying it one of the first things you do is you look around for somebody to experience that joy with you know a joy really brings fellowship it really brings fellowship as soon as you start having a good time doing something then you you're gonna sure the world you'll be looking around for somebody who can I enjoy this with who can I share this with who can I fellowship with in the store and so was it with Christ Christ came down to this world and for the joy that was set before him he endured the cross when you started gathering you went by Peter come with me come walk with me and went he gathered twelve men he wanted to share his joy with these twelve amen but you know it didn't really stop there you know because Christ's joy he's still still to this day has a desire to share that joy with you amen so the same joy that he shared with those twelve disciples could have same desire that caused him to share with those twelve that same desire still is enduring in Jesus Christ think about it that same joy is still enduring inside of Jesus Christ and so as he is enjoying right now fellowshipping with you and me amen he said that he would go and prepare a place for you amen well he's having a good time preparing that place amen and he and his desire is is that you and me would commune with him day by day and share that joy with him amen you assess there in Luke 10 21 he said in that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit and said I think the O Father Lord of Heaven and Earth that thou has hid these things from the wise and prudent and it was revealed them unto babes even so father for a seemed good in thy sight it says in that hour Jesus were joist his spirit why why was he rejoicing because they were beginning to catch the vision of what he was trying to get across to them amen the very moment that the disciples the blinders start coming off of their eyes Jesus the Bible says he rejoiced in spirit why because there are blinders are coming off the disciples eyes and they're beginning to see the whole reason why he came amen and Jesus were Joyce and said oh I'm thank you O Father that you has revealed unto these babes such as would learn amen the joy that was with them I know time talks about joy is in Luke 15 5 he says talking about the shepherd then when the shepherd leaves the 99 and he goes after the one as soon as he finds that one he picks it up he throws it on his shoulders he goes off for a joist him because he found that one you know and you know the thing of it is there's so many times in life we don't we forget that Christ is having a good time that we forget that Christ has done everything that he's done for a very specific purpose for a very specific reason amen and we are not alone in this world amen and in Christ is still desiring to have the same fellowship with us they he had with the disciples that he slept with they're side by side in the boat he slept with side by side in the fields or wherever they were everywhere they went all they always went together wherever they were going they were going together those 12 disciples in him they he gathered them together why so he could enjoy this time with his people amen well that that desire has not left Jesus Christ think about that that desire has not left Jesus Christ he still wants to walk through and experience this world amen not now as he endures the cross but as you endure the cross think about it we are enduring we take up our cross and we follow him why for the joy that is set before us and are we alone in this journey no amen who's with us in this journey Jesus Christ amen and he's having a good time amen he's having a good time now the thing of it is it's hard to have a good time when when the problem the person that you're with is gloomy all the time right wait who you know if like when when Peter you know and he when he was doubt and all sudden Jesus said get thee behind me Satan you know or when when Peter is doubting on the ways he starts thinking you know you know Jesus was looking forward to when Peter said Lord call out call me out of the boat to walk on the water I want to walk on the water just like you're walking on the water that did that sparked something inside Jesus's heart he's catching the vision you know and you know it will been a little bit of a disappointment yo when he when he started doubting you know as Jesus said why did you doubt I was calling you out to myself I wanted you to join with me it wasn't just I'm not here showing off by walking in the water but no I didn't want to walk out here by myself I wanted you to get out of the boat and walk with me amen think about it it could have been the story could have been that that the Peter and Jesus were walking side-by-side on the water and he would have enjoyed that amen think about it he would have enjoyed that well he tweaked and he can still you can still walk on the water with him amen that's still possible that's still there that's still available to the sons and daughters or not amen why because he enjoys being with you in the supernatural amen he's gonna listen Christ dwells in the supernatural everything he does is supernatural he is supernatural he thinks supernaturally amen he doesn't think the way man thinks he thinks supernatural thoughts he is not confined by natural things he is not confined by natural boxes or the things that people put him in but he is not confined by any of the ideas of man but he is supernatural amen though the wind goes where wants to no one knows could say where it comes from no one can say where it's going but the will of the Spirit like the wind goes wherever wants to go and Christ enjoys bringing someone along with him amen the leadership of the Holy Ghost as much as we enjoy being led by the Holy Spirit so with that same joy the Holy Spirit enjoys leading us the Holy Spirit enjoys leading us in the supernatural way amen amen we ought to be expecting the supernatural hey may why because that's where he is walking a man when Christ's walks on the earth he is not walking on the carpet he's not walking on the sidewalks right amen amen it may look like it but he is actually walking Iko like a foot blow he could walk a foot above he could walk right the Eco walk anywhere I wanted he is not bound to the elevation of whatever platform that the man has placed there amen because he can walk at any elevation that he wants to a man he can walk in any sphere that he wants to he can walk at any time that he wants to he is not confined to creation amen and he wants you to join with him and fellowship with him in that supernatural way because he is supernatural amen and Christ enjoys being it's like just like you know if if you were to all sudden Sunday experience experience walking on the water and you are able to do you know like you know I'm just gonna walk to ye you know I know I've sat out there for miles an hour and and you know and you know what and I'll figure in about a month I'll get there I'll watch the Sharks go by and they'll see the whale spout slow and and whatever and just and have a good old time now if you were to be able to do that then then you know what you would be out there and by what I wish someone is here it's experience with me because it'd be such an amazing experience you know like any child you know growing up you know if you're like me you know you're always dreamed of you know the fly you know and and you know I remember that as a boy you know we're trying to go to sleep and and you'd have little dreams and things like that and you think well I wish I could fly you know it well you keep why why can't you because he can but if you were ever to discover yourself flying through the air you like what I wish there was somebody that could enjoy this with well think about a Christ can do those things Jesus Christ can do those things and he wants to experience those things with you he has seized the he's desiring to have fellowship but you know Christ he he is a supernatural beat a man he's not confined from the natural elements amen and when he so he communes with you he wants to commune with you in a supernatural way amen so we are not to confine ourselves to natural thinking or to natural ways amen but we ought to enjoy being with him amen amen for the joy this set before him amen amen let's turn over to Psalms 23 I want to create read a few different passages from the Psalms brother Richard the scripture thing right before I came up here Psalms 23 6 says surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever it weren't amazing things about the scripture is you know King David didn't physically spend all this time in the tabernacle on top of the hill physically he wasn't always there but he said but here he's saying that he was you know sometimes I think that this through the verses like this is the very reason why God said he's a man after my own heart amen amen you know a day David he spent a lot of time talking about I will always be there you know I always be there in the presence you know surely goodness and mercy shall follow me I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever amen why because Christ is always with amen he meant God Himself told David he said that I will be with you and my holy spirit I will never take away from you so Holy Spirit was always with them and what else did he say there he said surely David said surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life my God's goodness and God's mercy we're following him all the days of his life hey man let's go over to Psalms 107 I think I read this here several several months ago maybe a few years ago I don't recall Psalms 107 read verse 41 what that I like about Psalms 107 it Psalms 107 if you break it down it's a it's about five different stories and and each story ends with like if you read verse verse seven and eight there says and he led them forth by the right way that they might go to a city of habitation he says oh that men would praise the Lord for His goodness and for his wonderful works of men they repeats again in verse 21 oh that men would praise the Lord for His goodness and for his wonderful works that ornament and that repeats again over there in verse 31 and and and in a few different places in there boy is is about five different stories and each story has its own situation that someone is going through and then when they get through the end of what they're going through that they praise God and then they wish the other men would praise God that like they're praising God oh that men would praise God because look what I've gone through I wish everybody could see how good god is you know the first story there is talking about the redeemed out of Egypt the first eight verses they're talking about how they are hungry and thirsty they're wandering in the wilderness then they cried unto the Lord in their trouble and he delivered them oh that men would praise the Lord for His goodness and his wonderful works the tournament and then the second set of verses was talks about those that are bound by sickness and they're in prison you know I was talking about how they how they rebelled they were sitting in the darkness in the shadow of death and then he brought down their heart with labor and they fell down there's no one to help them and all sudden they cried unto the Lord out of their trouble he saved them out of their distress 'as a man and then oh that men would praise the Lord for His goodness amen and then it talks about the fools that how even though in the midst of their fools and their transgressions they're afflicted and then because there are niklas their life is hard and then all of a sudden God since they crying the Lord has trouble and he sends his word and heals them and delivers them from the destruction that they got themselves into this has oh that man he would praise the Lord for His goodness and for his wonderful works to the children of men and it talks about those that are the people that live in boats and go down and ships to the sea and how all sudden the storm comes up and the boat goes up on the wave and then it goes down into the depths and then their their heart is crying out as they began to realize they were getting ready to sink and this says and God brings them back to their desired Haven to the peaceful cove amen and then there they rejoice that their Lord saved them and it says oh the men would rejoice amen and praise the Lord for His goodness and for his wonderful works of children then he get down to verse 41 it says yet he said a yes says he the poor on high from affliction and maketh them Families like a flock the righteous shall see it and rejoice and all iniquity shall stop her mouth whoso is wise and will observe these things even they shall understand the loving kindness of the Lord amen amen now now the righteous they're gonna see how God acts in these things and they're gonna rejoice amen they're going to rejoice why are they gonna rejoice because they realize that no matter what they go through in life no matter where they are no matter what problems they have in life you know we really only have her troubles until we give them under the Lord you know people only have problems until they give them to the Lord then they're not problems they're just thing they're testimonies in the waiting a man why because you gave them to the Lord then they're not problems anymore why are they not problems because you gave it to the Lord Amen and win the right to see how good god is and the things he does for him and then it starts to rejoicing in your heart a man you thank God they once again he brought you through and then you shall begin to understand the love lean kindness of the Lord that surely goodness and mercy will follow you all the days of your life and what it brings a joy on the inside you and your you and Christ are walking down through the halls of life together you and Jesus Christ are walking down through the halls of life together amen it's a man and his God man and his creator walking arm-in-arm we're going to enjoy this life together Amen s that's what God that's what that's what the that's why Christ was so excited a man for the joy that was set before him he endured the cross a man what was he he was that tree of life who had been separated like I spoke this morning the tree of life was separate from mankind by the by the the flaming swords of the Garden of Eden but here the tree of life was restored right back walking amongst men again a man was a a brought a joy he is a net tree of life is still here amen he's still able to restore unto you the joy of your salvation amen amen let's turn our to psalms 40 I meant to go to 103 but we'll read flurried this vs. s withhold not thou verse 11 says withhold not thou thy tender mercies for me O Lord let thy loving-kindness and thy truth continually preserve me Lord don't withhold I tender mercies from me you know the the word their tender tender mercies you know I went to this fry it was a year or two years ago I preached a message called understanding the loving kindness of the Lord coming from that Psalm 107 even they shall understand the loving kindness of Lord but these two were these two phrases here the Dave had said over and over again he was always talking about the loving kindness of the Lord and the tender mercies of the Lord those were really those are tooth two things that David loved to talk about love to express and when you when you look down and try to understand exactly what those words mean the tender mercies of the Lord that the Christ tender mercies towards us had to do with the same loving-kindness and tender mercies that a mother would have towards her unborn child it had to do with when you look at the root words if it had to do with the way a mother would caress her belly as she's thinking about her unborn child that love that she has for there is no ill-will there there is there is she's not complaining about that child a Misha's you know he can kick her he can wake her up at night he can do whatever he wants but that mother is gonna love that child and she'll do anything for it and she will have mercy upon it a man because that child when it comes out of the womb is completely helpless and dependent upon its mother amen and she has mercy upon it hey man she doesn't just leave it there but she grabs it up in her arms amen and she nurses it and she and she loves that she cherishes it and everywhere she goes that bit that mutt that way that baby goes with it that's the cest the tender mercies that David was talking about amen that's the tender mercies that God has to children amen the love and the loving-kindness when you look at the root words down on that it has to do with God takes you when you are way down here by his loving-kindness he takes you up out of the pit and brings you up and sets you on the same standing as himself amen to be side-by-side with him you don't deserve to be there no but you don't deserve to be there but he brings you up anyway out of loving-kindness and places you on the same standing it looks at you I died amen you deserved a look at him I I you don't deserve to you don't deserve to be unequal standing with him but he takes you places you there anywhere that's his loving kindness towards you he didn't have to do it but he condescended down to you and brought you up to his own plane and you go walking you go and join life through together amen so that's what it says there lord with not with hole not thou thy tender mercies from you O Lord let thy loving-kindness and thy truth continually preserve me Amen now let's go over to where I meant to go to Psalms 103 palms 103 I'll read the first two the fourth verse it says bless the Lord O my soul and all that is within me bless His Holy Name bless the Lord O my soul and forget not all of his benefits who forgiveth all thine iniquities and who healeth all thy diseases the watch this verse for who redeemeth thy life from destruction who crowns thee with lovingkindness and tender mercies a man he gives you that loving-kindness and those tender mercies as a gift to you he crowns it with you amen a encompasses around about your head and encompasses round about your thinking Amen all of your thinking is surrounded by his his loving kindness and his tender mercies towards you amen when you start to realize that then you can they begin to have some joy amen not just joy but joy what one with him why because he is the one that did that with him a mess like if you say you had a say you had a say you were poor and and you know you just were barely struggling day by day to get by and you could barely afford to buy food and yet a friend of yours is a millionaire you know and he grabs you takes you like come on let's take a trip together you know and he goes and you go a fly see down to the aisles you know or up to the Caribbean or and gives you an experience here in the jungles or whatever well he didn't have to do that but he grabbed you he wanted the fellowship to take you places that you could never go on your own and to do things that you could never do by yourself Amen why because he had a desire to experience those things with someone else so he grabbed you and brought you along by your side you couldn't have done it by yourself by him and his loving-kindness and tender mercies grabbed ahold of you and brought you with him amen and as so it is with Christ amen yeah we didn't deserve it Amen we didn't heat we were down there in the dirt we but he grabbed us he lifted us up and he has a journey that he is going on and he wants to take us with him amen he wants to spend eternity with us amen that's the joy that he has a man towards us let's turn over to proverbs eight I want to read again what we read this morning hey man we could take these things to God in prayer amen because he has a desire to enjoy life together with us amen when we going before God in prayer we have to have that understanding that we're we're not alone in this life amen he knows the struggles that we go through he knows the troubles that we go through he knows the deep desires that we have in her hearts because he's the one to put those desires in there amen amen so we can take those things to God in prayer amen proverbs 8 he says verse 25 before the mountains were settled before the hills was I brought forth while as yet he had not made the earth nor the fields nor the highest part of the dust of the world when he prepared the heavens I was there when he said I compass upon the face of the death well he established the clouds of uh when he strengthened the Fountains of the deep when he gave to the sea his decree that the water should not pass his commandment when he appointed the foundations of the world then I was by him as one brought up with him and I was daily his delight rejoicing always before him Christ was there amen the Spirit was there what rejoicing in the habitable part of the I love this verse here rejoicing in the habit of part of his earth my delights were with the sons of men Amen why was Christ it's just like it just like Abraham was drawn to where Jerusalem would be why because God had there was a habitable part of the earth that God had some future plans for and before he did anything in that area he wanted to first grab Abraham come on Abraham I want you I want you to experience this from day one I want you to experience this from day one I got no kids NECA is right here and I want you to experience where the city's gonna be before I do anything I want you to experience this right here amen and Abraham is still still a lot Amen he still is up there watching the city being built where Christ has gone to prepare a place for us and he'll be here when the city comes down amen and he's going to get to see exactly he's gone step by step by step amen in crisis hat is enjoying what he's doing right now preparing a place for us amen and he wants you to fellowship with him a meant to be about his business to be a partner with him amen as we as we as we prepare our own selves amen building in partnership with him he meant to enjoy the city amen rejoicing the habitable parts of the earth my delights were with the sons of men a man his delight is still there amen amen when you approach God with that kind of understanding you finally and fully understand and accept him as your Lord and Savior you accept that he paid the price for you and you accept his loving kindness towards you then you can really begin to understand the loving kindness of the Lord amen and who he is towards you amen amen the only always it'sit's hard to watch people that when they when they when they pray in doubt all the time every prayer they make is in doubt they're like boy I wish this would happen Oh Lord God I just wish I can get myself out of this and you know twenty years down the road they'll still be praying the zaq same prayer lord I wish I could be delivered from this Laura I wish this and thirty years down the road and there's and there's still just as much doubted in them as it was because God didn't call us to be like that a mess one thing to be praying a faith like Abraham for twenty or thirty years but it's a different thing to be praying in doubt for twenty or thirty years and never fully accepting that Christ has already Christ has already set you free a man Christ has already broken the seals off of your life and for the joy that set before him he's just waiting for you to be in fellowship and deliverance with him amen amen Christ joy amen amen Christ is not here to be on this journey alone none of us are Amen Christ is still desiring that we would have that type of a real relationship with him one on one amen just a minute just think about it we are that lamb that he's slung over his shoulders amen amen one one with him a man he was twelve two says looking unto Jesus the author and the finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God amen he wants you to sit with him in his throne so those verses like that when I read those I want you to sit with me and my father strong like Lord you made room there for me yes I made room there for you and I'll give you a confidence in your prayer amen I give you a confidence and a and who you are as his thoughts towards you changed no this thoughts towards you hasn't changed when he wrote your name down in the Lamb's Book of Life for the foundation of the world his thoughts were set towards you amen and now that you are growing up into the faith and and his thoughts he still has that exact same desire towards you that he had clear back there amen amen amen he wants to fellowship with you in Supernatural Amen I think about blind Bartimaeus when he was sitting there outside the walls of Jericho City on the rocks that that Joseph that fell down when when when Joshua spoke the word when Joshua and the children ziyal gave out the cry gave out the shout and and the walls of Jericho down and now mm you know 1500 years later here's blind Bartimaeus sitting on one of those rocks that fell down by the power of God feeling sorry for himself but then when Christ walked upon his way amen he began to rise amen who he was able to see amen amen amen amen a man even they shall understand the loving kindness of the Lord amen think about the thief on the cross what kind of an understanding he has of the loving kindness of Lord amen we are called to have that exact same understanding Amen we are called to have the exact same understanding because Christ is the same yesterday today and forever amen the same mercy that he had towards a thief from the cross as the same mercy that he'll have towards you when this when the thief looked over at Jesus said Lord remember me when you reach her into your kingdom we could look to him the same way today say Lord remember me when you enter into your kingdom he says today this day you will be with me in paradise Amen well we could say that right now we can say that right now today Lord remember me when you enter into your kingdom and he was he say back he says today you will be with me in paradise amen today you will be with me wherever I go why why because we'll be sitting with him together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus there wherever he is you will be also amen why because he's the same yesterday today and forever amen we can understand the loving mercies the tender mercies of the Lord and loving kindness just the same way that Jonah had Amen you know when Jonah was in the belly of the whale he wasn't alone God was with what brought upon his mind to say Lord I don't know which I'm gonna say that your temple is this way and once more I'm gonna lean towards kneel down right here in the whales belly at the bottom of the sea and I'm gonna cry out towards your tip well like Solomon said I could and his cry went up before the Lord and Lord heard his prayer he found out that he was in the pea thought he was the most area think about him think about Jonah saying what Lord why am I such a disobedient prophet Lord you have called me to the prophesy you called me to preach the gospel you called me to preach and and you tell me to go this way instead I go this way and Lord why can't I be like Elijah oh why can't I be like Enoch why can't I be like Abraham but God didn't call him to be like you know God didn't call him to be like Abraham God called him to be like Jonah a man here he felt like he was the most disobedient person this dude this will be a prophet ever but yet when when he got down on his knees and he didn't realize that here in his old disobedience he was typing out the most obedient act that would ever happened on the earth where Jesus said as Jonah was in the belly of the whale three days and three nights so shall the Son of Man be in the belly of the earth three days and three nights Jonah had to be in the belly of the whale and the very thing that he thought was his disobedience ended up being a prophecy of the most obedient act that would ever happen on this earth a many fenton it gives us hope to realize it sure he had an understanding the loving-kindness the lord and so can we have the same understanding because he's the same yesterday today and forever there wherever we are in our Christian walk even if we are in the midst of our disobedience so we can get down on our knees and say Lord forgive me once more I am gonna look towards your temple once more I'm gonna look towards you Lord to remember me amen the thing that you mean for wrong God can turn that around and make it for right amen and when you approach God with that kind of understanding then you can understand the loving-kindness and the tender mercies of the Lord amen why cuz his thoughts towards you have not changed they are eternal thoughts because you have eternal life amen he does not change amen amen hallelujah you know the like though the woman there was a prostitute in the city and they'll say woman and when she had maybe beyond the outskirts of the meetings with Jesus there and maybe it heard a few of the sermons but knew that she couldn't enter into the crowd or knew that she wouldn't be welcome there but that one day when she walked my Simon's house and she saw Jesus sitting there with unwashed feet and she thought well that ought not to be that way that shouldn't be a man that could preach look at they're not even paying any attention to him and a man that could preach the way that he preaches and say the words that he says a man should not be treated the way that he's being treated right now and she kind of looked through the window on her tiptoes you know and she's standing there and she's like this just is not right this is just not right look at me Simon is ignoring all the Pharisees were ignoring him Jesus is sitting in the corner every way everybody that came in the door the person would greet him at the door and wash their feet and you know and make him comfortable but somehow they missed Jesus and now everybody that is there at the party everybody's there at the supper and everybody had was give him the robe was given and you know was given given a gift was given a wash feet experience you know and was clean and comfortable and there's Jesus they missed him and he's sitting off over in the corner no one's paying attention to him and and this woman who wasn't even invited she gets up there and she she gets on her tiptoes and looks through the window looks through the lattice you know puts the parts the the branches of way and looks through on the inside of the it looks at the inner court and she says well that's just not right and then that thought strikes her she's like you know maybe I can make it up to him and she's like no no no I I couldn't do that she's like no you know maybe it's possible that which is lacking on their part that I could supply the need she's like old but I can't go in there you notice but that thought was in her mind and when I thought gets in your mind it drove her to do what she did and so she went down to the to the the the the dealer of fresh appointments and she went and she said I what's the most expensive thing that you got what's the most favorite perfume that you have and and the man he brings out and he goes and he goes into the back room and he gets it comes in a special box since there's a seal on it and sealed in there so that the the fumes can't get out and and inside there as ingredients have been brought from over here in Persia and down here over in India and a little bit of this and a little bit of all these rare spices and they've all been mixed together in there and crushed and put together in a special olive oil mixture and and they're all all ground up in there and then they put a wax seal on the box and they and they seal it all in together and they're all that is all the air inside there's just percolating and and getting a basin and all the the perfume in there and she goes and he places that box on the counter and you know says that I'll be he'll be seven thousand two hundred and forty six dollars you know and and she says that's my life savings but I will I will give that over for the the ointment and when she grabs that I'm and she goes and she and she finds she goes in and you know and the same thing they don't wash her feet either you know and she doesn't get the robe either and she has to walk in there just as she is but she has an offering before the Lord all that she ever has all that she ever was she gives to the Lord Jesus a man she goes over to the corner where Jesus is being ignored and she and she looks at him and and nobody is talking and they're having a good time and they're telling his jokes I shouldn't be told and and saying things it shouldn't be said and oddly things here and there and there's Jesus Christ the most pure man ever to walk the earth and no one's paying attention to him and she goes up and she he has struggling with the box I finally she just breaks the seal and breaks it open and and that that that the the type of Weymouth that that was begins to fill the room and the the odor and that would be the air that was on the inside of the box when she breaks that seal that air begins to because the olive oil it has a certain type of moisture and humidity to it and it begins to fill the room throughout all the places where it was and it say and it covers then so everybody in the room all sudden when the conduit for that they they realized something's going on and she began to wash his feet with the tears that she's crying you know and wash the feet with her hair i anoint him and anoint it with the oil and and wiping it with her hair with her long hair and all of a sudden there was two people they were in a worship service Amen now the whole room was in the worship service but there was only two that were on the inside of the service and everybody else was sealed on the outside of the service let me tell you those two were having a good time amen they were having a good time a man it didn't matter who else was around it didn't matter what anybody else was thinking but those to where she was worshiping her Savior a man and he was receiving her worship he didn't stop her he didn't do anything he just set there and watched her and watched her he didn't pull his foot away from her he just let her do exactly what she had in her mind to do a man as she worshiped her Savior and he said woman thy sins which are many are forgiven you amen now everybody was on the outside of that worship service didn't receive what she received a member she gave her all to the Lord amen and and because that was her joy Amen if you're ever if you're ever going to worship the Lord ever let me tell you you're gonna worship Him with the joy that is on the inside of you otherwise you will be on the outside like those Amen we wash the Lord we watched the Lord's feet with the oil of joy of gladness Amen that we bring with us why are we glad why are we happy because we understand what he has done for us Amen if you don't have that understanding of what Christ has done for you you cannot worship Him the way that others worship Him amen you cannot worship Him the way that he deserves to be worshiped until you first come to that realization of exactly what he has done for you LOA's down in the deep miry clay but he took me and grabbed me up out of the deep miry clay stepped me up on the strong rock by his side amen a man that has had that experience we let me tell you that man is gonna go places with God a man but there's a lot of people out there they'll just stay in the miry clay and will never go anywhere they'll come into Church stopping with their dirty feet and I'll go right back out why because they because Christ has not pulled them up out of the deep mire he's tried to he's knocked on their door but they won't allow him a mint and then I'll never have joy that's why I mean he cannot worship the Lord their God because you cannot worship Christ until he's done something for you amen and if you never if your eyes or if the blindness has never pulled away from your eyes then you can never enjoy the worship God the way he deserves to worship you might enjoy singing the songs you might enjoy the the atmosphere but no all it all is he'll be just like the women everybody else in the room that was just watching the world with Alba why because she gave her all to it she was gonna worship her Savior amen hey man let's just stand Psalm 107 42 and 43 says the righteous shall see it and rejoice and all iniquity shall stop her mouth that's what was happening there and went with the Wilmarth alabaster box amen whoso is wise and will observe these things even they shall understand the loving kindness of the Lord amen amen let's just bow our heads in a word of Prayer Heavenly Father we just want to thank you Lord for revealing unto us your loving-kindness
