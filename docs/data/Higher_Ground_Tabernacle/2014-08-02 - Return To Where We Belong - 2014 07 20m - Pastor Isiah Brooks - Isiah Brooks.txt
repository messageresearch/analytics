TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Hallelujah I'm leaning on the Everlasting Arms so glad to be in the number [Music] amen as we stand let us turn to the scripture according to Ephesians please we're going to ask that you turn there and then we ask that you turn with us to Genesis Ephesians 3 and9 you love God I just want to take my time this uh uh morning and uh I don't know why it feels a little chilly to me but if if you guys are okay then I'm all right Ephesians 3:9 I don't know I guess I'm from South Carolina amen hallelujah Ephesians 3:9 and to make all men see what is the Fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning of the world have been hid in God who created All Things by Jesus Christ let us turn to Genesis two please coming from the 21st to the 25th verse of Genesis 2 you love the Lord and the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam and he slept and he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh instead thereof and the rib which the Lord God had taken from man made a woman and brought her unto the man Adam said this is now bone of my bones and Flesh of My Flesh she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh and they were both naked the man and his wife and were not ashamed let us pray father God we come before you as humbly as we know how we thank you for your goodness we thank you for your grace father God we just pray Lord God that this morning you would bless us in a special way give your servants utterance Lord that we may speak Lord the Oracles of god father forgive us Lord if we have said done or thought anything that wasn't pleasing in your sight father you are the one who can find iniquity if there be any iniquity in my life forgive me of my sin cleanse me from all unrighteousness Lord that your people may be able to hear from you Lord let your perfect will be done here this morning in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated there are so many things that are happening in the world and uh you know but I I've really been just thinking about the Bride of Jesus Christ trying to concentrate on where God would have us to be and the inspiration that I should be under at this present time and I realize that we have had church for a long time I've been here what 7 years going on eight years and of course you all have assembled before I came uh but if those of you for those of you who were here Wednesday you know the message in which I preach on Wednesday night and I'm really serious about uh where God is taking us and where we are to uh uh go uh my message in this morning is return to where we belong and I want you to personalize it return to where you belong because amen this uh mystery that God has uh revealed to us in this last day before uh Malachi 4 we had no idea who we were what we were where we were going uh we actually were just church members and we thought that was good enough and then God sent us a Prophet by the name of William brandom and I thank God for him amen because I tell you what I think about him sometime and I wonder my God there's no way a man could have achieved all that he had achieved outside of the grace of God now we're in a day where you and I must understand that the world Amen is falling apart it really is uh the government the religious uh uh uh sect uh nobody knows what to do how to pull this thing together you know it's almost like you know they started it but they don't know how to finish it you know uh because man has prompt a lot of things uh uh changes in the world when the rich want to do something different they know how to do it and of course they fail to see the outcome sometime it it's like um uh you know how drilling for all but you you're not understanding that where you drilling is not a real safe place and all of a sudden what you thought was going to be a good product ends up spoiling the economy and the environment and all of these things so we're looking at a thing in where man has now doing it all over again like in the days of Noah brother brandham said they were the ones that were experimenting amen with the uh oxygen and the uh uh you know the H2O and all of these things that they were doing and it pretty much backfired and that's what he said he said we're living in an age where the intellig intelligence of man has now come to a place where it is backfiring on them and now they're trying to find a place of safety but we find out amen there's only one place of safety and that is in Jesus Christ uh when we look at the mystery what is this mystery because it's something that was hidden since the fall when Adam and Eve was on Earth they understood who they were they knew they were made out the image and likeness of God Amen they understood who their father was they knew where they came from and where they were going to amen so we want to dwell with that mystery a little bit we want to work with that uh so that you can plainly understand understand that you are a different people I was thinking uh this morning how that when Joshua uh uh came back with those uh other spies there were 10 fake spies and uh uh two that was really right and that was Joshua and Caleb and I said God I said we are determined to be a church of a good report amen we will not by the grace of God be like those 10 who says there is no way that we can do it hello somebody there will come a bride out of this church and she will be spotless she will be blameless she will be fully covered Amen in her royal garments I believe that amen by the grace of God so we find out amen that when we realize brother bam said that when Eve and Adam and I'm I'm going to go this way and I'll be going back and forth he said when they were on Earth before the fall they were veiled by a holy Veil now I don't know no other holy Veil outside of God it wasn't a piece of material or cloth it was God himself hello somebody you see well how can that be let me explaining how God can do something to you he can actually be right there and you won't see him on the road to EMAs right they talked with the Risen Savior they knew him they spent three and a half years with him and the Bible said Their Eyes Were Holden in other words Their Eyes Were veiled they couldn't see the very Messiah Hallelujah so even as God did it then uh uh God can do it now is that right he can Veil you from this world he said father I pray that there be in the world but not of the world we're not of this world even though we're in it now we we read that scripture uh by the grace of God because we wanted you to see uh as we explain uh a few Services ago how that when God took the rib out of uh Adam Adam he he didn't go find some other clay or some other dirt he he didn't look for something outside of Adam he literally took the rib of Adam and brother Adam said he took the very dirt that Adam was made out of and formed Eve in other words God was saying even in their natural they shall not be separated that's why God is redeeming your body because your body is still part of him now we look at the thing you and I must understand that when he looked and he as I said this morning or the other other week I love this because the Bible tells us that God breathed into Adam and and and and you find out when God let let me back up we realize amen that God first of all created Adam Spirit man y'all believe that according to Genesis 1:27 God first created Adam in his very image and likeness and God Amen the image and likeness is not your flesh I'm going explain that to you amen just the way brother Bram explained it he said because that's not the image of God the spirit part The Soul Man was in the image of God he said basically because you got hands like a monkey and feet like a bear he said God gave that to Adam so that he could rule the natural world now be part of his kingdom but we find out that we fail to see that what God did he took a man and here the man is in a a spiritual being he's a spiritual being but he's leading his his animals like the Holy Spirit lead you you don't see him but he's there amen glory to God and so that's what Adam did for the first part of whatever time he had he led the animals and everything even though they didn't see him but God wanted to bring in a closer relationship so God formed Man Out of the Dust of the ground brother Bram said we are a tree right all of us believe that if you don't look at your feet it's that's where the the roots used to be come on somebody that's why you got toes amen it's right where the god cut the roots amen so we realize by the grace of God Amen that what God did he took man and remember to be fallen is to lay down God never sleeps nor Slumber Adam at that time didn't need rest y'all understand me he stood so God formed and I was thinking about this this morning I said when I was a young child we in art we would take balloons and we we make y'all know what a pinata is I love those things I sometime get inspiration to make one now but anyway you know I you know and you take those and you know you take we used to take balloons and we design or fashion the balloons like little animals or whatever else you want your P Piata to look like then we take uh uh some uh paste we made the paste out of flour and water and we take the newspapers and then we'd wrap those balloons up in newspaper connect them and everything else you know I had me a little donkey you know amen so anyway you do all of that and then you give that time and space for that pinata to to to to to dry out the the the paper and the and the page to dry out now the paper and and just only took the form of the balloons right in other words amen so therefore we find out that when God wrapped man and the Bible said formed It Out of the Dust of the earth it wasn't that God just made it he wrapped that spirit that soul that theop up y'all hear what I'm saying so we realize he formed Man Out of the Dust of the earth and the Bible said he breathed the breath of life and so what happened Adam stepped into right into the Natural Body if you want to say it that way or God breathe the the the the the the life in him and the thing that really gets me is because when God formed Eve he never had to breathe in into her nostril why because when he breathed into Adam's Hallelujah I'm trying to go slow here this morning but he breathed amen into Eve because remember amen their names were Adam but Adam and Eve made one man amen that's right one man Hallelujah they had the same mind they had the same spirit amen so much so when God called for Adam they both turn and say yes Lord see they were one and this is Shadow and type it's almost like a prophecy that God was revealing Amen to his people he was listen the Angels never understood what God was all about so God was trying to show them what he was all about and I showed you amen how that God Amen made a womb made a womb in Adam Adam had no womb God did an operation he put him in a coma right and he made womb and he birth Eve God slowed him back up oh come on showing that the woman comes from Adam and went back to Adam oh Lord help me Jesus showing by the grace of God what he was doing in his creation what he's going to do with the bride Adam had no other charge there was no other mate for Adam even after Eve fell there was no other the serpent he had done named all the animals amen so therefore nothing was compatible amen oh come on somebody it ought to make somebody happy here you say well I'm bride because I'm trying to get you to see that if you are bride you are redeemed redeemable amen you came from God Amen hallu listen the first body the Bible said the first Adam was Earthly right and the second Adam was a quickening spirit in St John and I'm jumping a little bit so I can just give you the thought this morning St John 3:23 Jesus telling the Pharisees and all these others who were critical he said ye are from beneath now I thought wait a minute ye are from beneath because you got to remember amen something took place God there was another world even though God created this world there was another world that God created and we call it hell and the Bible said that hell was created for the devil and his angels right but now he's telling these Pharisees and these Sadducees you are from beneath the Bible also tells us that hell has enlarged itself y'all hear what I'm saying so you got a first world you got a world that God created you got a second world which is called the world from beneath but there's another world coming cuz God works in threes Hallelujah so we're now living Amen in the world and right now we're living in a cross Zone if I can say it like that where God has said that heaven I mean Earth and hell is blending right you got a dimensional thing that's happening here and and what is it what is it doing it's making the True Believer uncomfortable it's making the Bri Hallelujah because the bride realized she's not created from for hell let me put it this way Jesus said I am from above and I got some good quotes here y'all just hold on he said I got he said I am I am from above I am not from beneath and I'll read the quote in the moment but I'm going to tell you what brother Brown said he said every Christian is born from above he said you came from God and you go back to God wherever Adam Jesus Christ was and is that's where we are now now let me move on because I want you to realize amen and the the serpent was a real smart little intelligent little fell and we find out that after Adam and and in Eve uh uh is separated and God has told them to be fruitful and to multiply and the reason why I took the 24th verse there where it says therefore shall y shall a man leave his father and his mother and and shall cleave unto his wife was showing the connection the connection amen even though God is is the Creator and and like I said you know all of us marry our sister if you don't marry your sister you in trouble right right come on somebody it was important amen for Abraham to find Isaac a sister to Mary you said it can't be it was because it was bloodline it was bloodline it came from the same father and mother amen come on somebody so my point is whenever you would marry and that's why God said don't marry among these and among those and the Canaanites and this that he was working with bloodline and those who would who came from Adam right and therefore we don't marry anybody that doesn't come from the second Adam if you do that you are marrying into the can lineage anybody know what I'm talking about so let me let me just back it up and slow down a little bit we look at this thing and I want you to understand that this natural adom was as brother R said he was God he was God over his world that was God's reflection that was God what God intent was to be to make Adam god of the Earth right now he was more than that because understand he had the power to change the atmosphere right so that's why amen that when Jesus came he just didn't do Miracles like Healing The Sick and just the natural things he also worked in the realm of the atmosphere he also worked in the realm of creation come on because he was here to declare what the first Adam was supposed to be like right I'm going to bring it up to our in just a moment because you've got to realize God didn't call you to be church members this stuff and and you know I was just listening uh by the grace of God to Jesus with dirty feet and you know what one statement brother brand said he said they were having too much fun to pay attention to Jesus and I thought to myself is that not like the worldly church today is that not like we we're having so much fun we don't have enough time for Jesus have mercy on us Lord have mercy but anyway we find out that the devil intent was to bring forth his lineage through uh in a position where he could continue the battle remember in the greatest battle ever fought brother said it started in heaven now it's where it was in Eden now it's no longer in Eden it's in your mind so we find out amen Satan amen wanted to be able to to battle and and bring this his dream or his vision to pass but understand what God did and you better thank him when you get to heaven for it thank you brother thank you brother no I'm going to thank him nowall right amen so you could realize amen that that what he did to secure you he basically signed the marriage certificate you can call it the Lamb's Book of Life whatever you want to but he placed your name in the Lamb's Book of Life and understand before all of this took place God he's so far ahead of the devil is the devil is know what he's doing but my point is God slew the lamb he put your name on the Lamb's Book of Life he protected you that's why the devil could not destroy you even when you was in the world Amen because God had protected You by signing your name in the book before the foundation of the world y'all hear what I'm saying now in the message who is God because I want you to realize who he is because before you can understand who you are you got to recognize who he is who is God in that message 5815 he says who is God the one that stood there and mowed the Stars off of his hands and roll worlds out of his hands and made the thing which do not appear appear deity and deity himself lives in man the Creator that made Heaven and Earth lives in mankind amen you know because I'm so tired of people taking the Holy Ghost as a thing I got to get this thing it is not a thingu it is a person it is God himself it is not a toy like a tamarine I got to have a tamarine amen no sir it is God living in you that message Kidman redeeming he said we're living in America that's true and that's the body part but the soul that conducts us our character is from above amen we live from above because we're born from above oh oh wait a minute you mean to tell me I'm living from above my my if I could say it like this my umbilical cord is still connected to heaven now I I'm trying to tell us something because once you realize who you are brother said we become of an invincible Army and I look around and I find out that is the thing that we're not dwelling on bringing the people into mind on who they are amen come on somebody amen amen you may have been stricken with amnesia but God is trying to say wake up oh Zion dust yourself from the earth Shake Yourself amen this is not a coincidence this is what God is doing for us and right now the devil is shaking in his shoes am because he knows once the Bride come to recognize who she is he's in big trouble he'll be so glad when we get out of his Eden he won't know what to do but what he don't understand I'll be glad too when I get out of his Eden his Eden anyway let's move on amen he said all Christians come from above Jesus said I'm not from below I'm from above if I was from below my subject would fight for me but my kingdom is of above and I thought that's why he said put it up Peter put it up put the sword up I'm not of this world this is not the way I fight but my kingdom is of above and so every man that's born of the kingdom of God he's from above amen that's more than words people if you don't understand and say God give it to me give me a revelation of what this really mean when it comes to me now we realize amen that when Adam and Eve were naked they were in that dispensation of what man call innocence you know he was unfallen uh you know didn't know wickedness didn't no evil and these kind of things but you see in order to be God as God is you must know good and evil you see we know that God knew good and evil it wasn't that when Adam then fa God said oh my goodness that's what evil is about God knew exactly what evil was and in order for ad to be just like God he had to come this way he had to come this way it wasn't that God was going to make him but he had to make a choice and God put that choice right there with someone he loved the most right if I don't go that way I lose her then I will always be lonely so therefore I must go this way and you know that's why I said the other night that's why when Adam said Lord this woman you gave me in other words Adam was you know people thought he was being sassy but no Adam was saying I know you know you know the whole thing amen it was this woman because up until then everything was perfect amen so for whatever reason you put her there to bring me here Lord amen right he had no other choice you you understand what I'm saying there was a choice but her the way she was designed she was going to go that way y'all understand what I'm saying it wasn't like oh my goodness I don't know what eveve is going to do y'all want to bet on it no it was nothing like that he knew exactly what was going to happen God wasn't ignorant God doesn't roll dice and play play those kind of tricks God knows he knows the end from the beginning is that all right with y'all so I look at this thing and I say here he was he was first created in the image of God is that right and God is a spirit so God created Adam that way right in such a such a way of himself and as I said he formed him from the dust of the earth and one of the things that I really like was he took the dust he breathed into Atom Man became a living Soul now I want you to understand this and you've heard me quote this before but why want you to realize when you receive the Holy Ghost now watch what brother bam said he says okay you break justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost he said that baptism of the Holy Ghost is just a renovation basically what it is is there to burn out all of the drought and the the dirt and the dust and everything else out of you the Holy Ghost is just setting up a throne room the a proper room setting it up for him the person himself right so you got to realize all right okay now I that's why Paul and I'm jumping a little bit Paul I'm trying to take my time because I really want you to see what I'm trying to get over this thing that we have heard and thought and many times embraced that the Holy Ghost was some sensation and don't get me wrong I love my shouting I love my dancing I love my worship but that is not the Holy Ghost even though the Holy Ghost when it comes right because you heard me say this so many times when the Holy Ghost really comes into your soul there is a faith Revelation there's not a feeling but there's a revelation of it and when that Revelation strike you it's like a well coming out [Music] right amen it brings up a re it brings up a sensation because it passes through your spirit where your emotions are you're going to either cry you're going to do something Amen to thank God because now you know you got it right oh you know you got it now and when that happens amen oh there's no way to explain it so so what happens is brother Bram comes along now I told you this I told you this before Pentecostal could not take you there none of the ages could take you where this message is taking us amen hello somebody this message could this Luther could take you to justification Wesley Amen to sanctification and and and and realize sanctification still holds amen amen and the Pentecostals amen could give you the baptism uh the Holy Ghost of with the gifts but they could not bring the person why because they could could not recognize the person when the person knocked on the L to see an age they shut him out they thought it was William Brandon but they failed to see God IM morphe God veiling himself in human flesh and when he knocked on their doors trying to get in they were out there like vasty having their own revivals and they did not want to come to appear before the King right so what God did he put them away right and now he sought a non nameer amen he sought a bride amen that didn't have no reputation she wasn't a Baptist she wasn't a Methodist she wasn't a Pentecostal she wasn't none of that she comes along and she finds the the man who knows more about the king than anybody else in the past D and she says I want to know what he likes see the bride she want to do what he wants her to do you know she she's not refuting anything that he said she's literally saying I want to do everything he wants me to do amen sanctify myself whatever it takes is what I want because that's what I want to do is please the king you know what I heard there in in in in um Jesus with dirty feet brother Bon was basically saying if you don't kiss the son he would be angry you know that's a scripture he said how do you kiss the son he talks about kissing the son he said by worshiping that's how you kiss the son by worshiping he said because if you don't worship him he'll get angry come on somebody it's the truth it's the truth he even took it to a place he said that man who told that listen Simon want you at his house he said here was this this slave or worker that came right up to Jesus he was so excited about doing what Simon wanted him to do he failed to worship Jesus he said the worst mistake he ever made in his life he said and that same incident would judge him he came right in the face of Jesus and he said that's what people do they come right in the face of Jesus they come right in the church services knowing it's God here amen and they fail to worship Him He said God will judge you for that is that all right the thing that I love about it is that when one man was when Adam if I could say it was plural he was male and female right but God called him one is that right so we realize by the grace of God the mystery is this you came from God this is a this got to be a revelation otherwise you'll miss the whole thing you came from God and you go back to him amen right now I want you to understand the baptism of the Holy Ghost the world knows nothing about it they think they know it they think they got it and you don't have it unless the word brings it to you Hallelujah you'll never be able to get it unless you came from God Amen not in this sense right because Adam and Eve if you could say it like this were soulmates huh yeah they were soulmates and this is the way uh uh uh let's put it this way and and you know a lot of time people don't understand this but brother Bram said it in so many simple ways he said if you had a a laundry ticket and he said you took your clothes close to the laundry and I'm not going to tear this sheep cuz I need it but he said you know you he said what happened he said that laundry man he tears that ticket in hand the problem of God was trying to tell you something folk that God told Adam in half that's the only way you can be join airs hallelujah amen equal parts come on somebody amen so what God comes along through a prophet and he uses a simple thing to show you that it have to be the other half of godu somebody I know you feel like shouting but I'm just trying to tell you amen the prophet did it in such a simple way he said he said and then therefore he said when you came to reclaim you claim to claim your laundry he said the ticket had to match right oh Lord and see what he was saying there was nobody outside side of Eve that could match Adam even in her Fallen state so here it is a part that I didn't preach but we find out I'mma read your quote you like this from Israel and the church number one 533 25 I don't do that but I want you to remember that one now here he comes torn Riven tore to to Pieces his soul went to God God blessed him and then his soul returned back in the form of the baptism of the Holy ghosten Hallelujah Glory I know I read it but I'm going read it again his soul returned back in the form of the baptism of the holy ghost that comes into every believer to sanctify clean up mind clean up the heart leave a portion of the Holy Ghost in there here and there and where the Holy Ghost is given out that same holy spirit that brought the body of Jesus out of the Grave will Rapture amen the Covenant has to dovetail there it is as he uh uh tore there and gave the body went back to God and the Spirit came back to the earth when your spirit have to be the same kind of spirit now I'm just holding my feet they want to they really want to dance hallelujah amen because your spirit and a lot of us don't realize it brother brandom said it he said the nature right the nature of your spirit is the soul or the nature of your soul is your spirit oh Lord how you want to put it so you realize why is important to die God doesn't live in a duplex and the only way that he can ever fully manifest himself you must die brother said not just die but Rock in other words there must never be another a possibility you of ever res res that part of you ever resurrecting Hallelujah because he said when when you die God then comes in and lives the life now now how are you going to die if you're not willing to surrender one of the things that death requires and that is that you give up the ghost amen You' got to surrender before death can fully take control y'all hear what I'm saying and so many times I I've not seen uh that people take that last breath but usually they go as if they're breathing it out see when you get the Holy Ghost is breathe in but as if they breathing it out they solely giving it up and this is where God is saying and I'm telling you how you do it I'm trying to tell you how you do it okay so what happen is you come to a place and I'm going tell you whether it's in your home in your car in your closet in the room wherever you may be you've got to come and I'm telling you just is the way it's done name it name it you've got to let the Holy Ghost take you down every every memory length whatever and you got to say Lord I Surrender and when God hallelujah when God points out to you things that you got to correct you have to say amen I make it right and he don't know whether you're telling the truth or a lie you've got to give it all up and when it comes to the part that you can't give up you say now God help me huh I want to die and I'm not going to leave this position position until everything is clean surrendered and given to you and why because I believe I'm bride amen hallelujah amen that's how you have to approach him I believe I'm bride everything you say in this word is pertaining to me and so therefore I'm here for you to clean me up Hallelujah I'm here for you to fix it because by faith I've kneeled here by faith I've come here by faith and I'm not leaving until I can see Faith made plain amen see what I'm saying and I can't tell you all I can tell you is that if you don't not desperate God can give you that if you ask for it my point is this amen nothing comes easy and when you come before God it's going to be a sacrifice hello somebody now I'm going to tell you something that you may never thought about it do you believe you really think Simon Serene was waiting there said oh my God I got an opport opportunity to help him he didn't even know that in the mind of God that was his role but I guarantee you once he saw the face of Jesus something changed all of a sudden he recognized that's my position and this is what I'm supposed to do Hallelujah I don't think he went went away complaining oh no I believe salvation was given to Simon Serene right there Hallelujah sometime God has to force the issue you force you to get you in the position that you're supposed to be in but once you there you recognize this is where I belong I'm just trying to get us to we we can have life and no more struggle struggling to live struggling to live it's good that you got struggle cuz that means you got some life but understand God when God gives you like brother say the baptism of the Holy Ghost is just the beginning of this thing amen I'm coming folks just the beginning right because understand according to Revelation Jesus Christ I think 3:14 he is the beginning of God's creation and if God didn't spare him how he going to spare you you were there so it's not that I can't do it I can do it because in him I did it I can't pray all night he prayed all night I don't know how to pray in desperation he prayed in desperation why because he recognized the hour he recognized the hour and the more he thought about the hour coming the more he thought about I got to get I got to get this I got to get this dead just got to die right I I got to die to this because there's a part of him saying Lord I don't want to do this I know it's written in the word but I don't want to I don't want to do this did y'all know that there was a human element in Christ that he did not want take Calvary father I would that this cup passed from me why cuz this man saw the pain he knew the agony and no doubt when he walked around Jerusalem and all of these other places he seen people on the cross that wasn't a beautiful situation but one thing for sure I love it he didn't run but he knew he needed help you don't run from this you don't say Lord I can't do this message can't live you don't run from it you face it and you go to you go to your your your Garden of Gethsemane you cry there until God come down if he's got to dispatch your angel he'll do it amen but you stay there until you can come up and say I'm ready I'm fully surrendered to God and I'm ready to do whatever he wants me to do let's go back to where we come from amen I'm tired of this world aren't you and the only reason why this world still rolling around the Sun like it is is because the bride has not completely made herself ready amen made herself ready right he says the Covenant has the dub Tail as the tore as as he tore tore there and gave the body and gave the body went back to God and the Spirit came back to the Earth then your spirit have to be the same kind of spirit or it'll miss that place going there if you don't listen listen please people of God listen if you don't have these virtues in you if they're not there brother Bram is now saying you going to miss it yes sir not because of your make yourself but because something the love of God has swept into your soul and tore every Earthly Idol out huh it ain't your working is the Holy Ghost working in you amen right is that okay so listen you are the Workman turn with me to Ephesians 2:10 and I hope this is okay I want you to realize people of God we will not give that bad report I don't care if it's just it wasn't just but two of them I don't care if it's two or three or four of us we will not give the bad they're going to come a bride out of here that's going to make a translation I refuse I don't care about the Giants in the land I don't care if we don't have music go if there ever never come a musician or anything else listen my goal my goal right now is to be what God Amen Hallelujah on Earth on Earth on Earth bearing the same signs the same wonder the same character the same every let everything perish around me nothing should matter to you more than anything thing more there shouldn't be anything in your way outside of the goal amen Paul said I press toward that Mark the goal whatever suffering i' have to have I'm still looking straight you can't accomplish it yourself but yourself but you know who the man is right look what he says in he turn stated at Ephesians 2:10 but he says in in this question and answer he said Adam was lonesome and God to show that they could not be separated remember I said that now I'm going to get back into the same thing just a second look he never went and got a dirt and made a Eve but he made from the original dirt Adam he took a rib from his side and made him a helpmate and that was Eve so she was made for the man and part of the man she was part of him in the beginning in the creation in what the the she was part of him down here in this creation she could not be divided in another creation she had to be made in the same creation see cuz if she he had done it from another creation we would have never known she really came from Adam and we would have never known the bride really came from God Amen y'all hear what I'm saying so she had he had to divide put them together then separate them and brought them back together amen amen ain't God good listen Ephesians 2:10 says for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God ha before what ordained that we should walk in them hey somebody it ain't if I'm going to get there I'm there Hallelujah because God ordained it to so it is the path that God has set before us people of God he said it I don't care if I'm way over here and my path is over there God will CA something to happen to push me over this way so I can walk in it because I've been ordained so have you amen so have you and sometime the way God does it don't always feel good but oh my once you get there you say hallelujah thank you Jesus praise God I love you Lord right because remember that brother I'll never forget it they he preached that message two years ago brother Dy he preached God's decisions y'all remember that and he said every decision God makes for for us we prosper from it thank God for making the decision to save me hallelujah amen so look look look so we got to understand you never be happy in this world I don't care what you try where you run I don't care you can be like Jonah amen whatever you want to be it doesn't matter amen God going to bring you right where you're supposed to cuz God said I've never lost one amen so it's best to just say saddle up and let's go for it is that all right hey that's what Paul said who can resist this counseling hey who can say to the part why did you form me to be this or thus Hallelujah come on somebody the one thing I want you to understand that there are people who have been born from beneath y'all y'all better recognize this they are demons and not more so now that are being birthed on the earth y'all must not know what I'm talking about but brother vom said because of the Fall God allowed a worldly Spirit to come into us and whether you realize it or not the the only thing that protected you from that worldly spirit is the thing that was in your soul hello somebody cuz all of us was born with demons we did not have no desire to serve God you mean that little cute little in thing yep yep that little thing amen because if it was that kind of spirit in heaven God wouldn't have to give you according to Ezekiel a new spirit so whether you believe it or not as cute as they may be they little demons in baby stage it's the truth it's the truth people why do you get prayer for them why do you get them dedicated believing that God is going to change all of that yes somebody come on somebody that's the truth and whether you believe it or not Judas was born a demon and the the the the right now you better believe it there are more demons being born if you want to say it like that didn't you not don't you know that even the world calling their little babies little demons you ever heard them man they little demons come on here little demons I heard them I've heard it calling their babies demons they're not out of the scripture born from beneath that's why they love the things of hell oh come on Amen that's why you love the things of God CU you're from above and they love the things of hell because of where they come from oh come on somebody y'all I tell you what it it is what it is now turn with me to Second Peter please you love the Lord oh people of God we've got to return and and and I'm getting ready to get there in just a minute cuz I want to tell you something and this has been laying before us and laying before us and we've preached on it and preached on it and we preached on it and and um we've got to recognize by the grace of God that God is trying to tell us something if you don't have this you're going to miss it I had to tie my shoe amen so second Peter 1 right second Peter 1 there's no way I can go through all of this but I'm going to go through it as much as possible I want you to go and study it out and says God you should well your best way of studying it is go home and listen to the Statue of a perfect man now it can't get no planer the world doesn't have this message on the Statue of a perfect man you say I want to be perfect here it is before you can really see the move of adoption in your life here it is is everybody teach it in a different way I'm just going to tell you right now if you haven't gotten to the place where Jesus have said hear ye him you still got some more climbing second Peter 1 2-10 Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of our God and of Jesus our lord now remember the nature of the spirit is the soul or the soul or nature of the soul is the spirit however however you want to put it but it has a nature and here God is saying this is what's in my soul shouting John I'm telling you he said I'm going to lay it there in the scriptures and I the bride will catch it now everybody else will look over and they think this is why brother B said it he said Scientology can do this he said those the people you can you can produce these things without the Holy Ghost one thing you can't mimic is divine n love divine love you can't you can't but all these other things he said you can do it mind over matter longsuffering and all of these things mind over matter he said but when it's real when it's a genuine liying Satan can't go there right he said Grace and peace be what multiplied unto you multiplied multiplied unto you through the knowledge of our God and of Jesus our lord according as his divine power has given unto us all things all he didn't leave nothing away from his bride he gave her everything pertaining to himself H so that she might know the path she's taking that pertaining unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that have called us to glory and virtue and let me hold up let me stand it right here cuz you know if you read and you listen to the statute of a perfect man brother bam talks about the baptism of the Holy Ghost he said that's the beginning he said and then you add on to this and add on to this and add on to this you've got to listen to that tape really well thoroughly because I used to listen to that thing in faint faint in my spirit cuz every time I get to a certain level I would fall why because it was human effort I was trying to do it I was trying to make this thing happen and God show me that's not the nature of a seed Hallelujah the nature of the seed is that if you water it you give it sunlight it will produce itself yes and once the baptism has quickened that seed by the grace of God all you got to do like brother randam said is lay in the presence of the son you stay there in the word you stay there in the word you come to church how do you water the camel you shout oh y'all don't know what I'm talking about brother brand you worship God that's what he said he said the same two half camel that brought re took took the gifts to Rebecca was the same two half camel she wrote taking her back to Isaac he said that was worship amen you got to water the camel he said watering the camel is worship right in other words you water the word you worship what the word amen that's what people don't understand when the word of God is coming and you say Amen praise God you worshiping the word and at that sign at same time as you saying amen and you worshiping that seed is growing woo you might not see it but it's forming itself into the very image of God Amen and when you don't worship he said he get angry with you kiss the son now we're not talking about music now we're talking about the word when you worship the word amen it's powerful because that ain't all it either I want you to understand worshipping is part of it I want you to understand when Jesus was going into the the city they were worshiping him man hosana hosana blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord but when the word started bring forth the bitter when the word start amen bringing it I'm whipping you today because you up in my temple when that came they backed off you hear what I'm saying the the make Believers the people who thought they believ because they did not have that life in them they didn't have a root when they came down to the real thing they backed up like who are this and those some of those same people screaming out crucifying so when the bitter comes you got to take it bitter and sweet you got to eat G and all of that nothing should be left and that's the point it always go against your grain God designed it that way Hallelujah if you ever ran track or anything like that you get tired and then the coach says one more lap and you think to yourself can't you see I'm almost dead one more lap I'm going to die and it's going to be your but you know what people but somehow you muster up enough strength and take another lap then you realize the coach was right you could do it see what I'm saying and my point is when it comes to God he's saying you might feel like you on the edge of it all and you might not take another move he said but I'm requiring one more move amen where we are today is that the world has got us all messed up if we we look at you know it's like Peter walking on the water come on somebody when you start looking at everything you can't yeah so when you can't focus what happen you begin to sing this is a time to focus you got to focus now refocus and don't leave out of here saying Lord Focus me put me in a position where I can look at this thing if I got to read these scriptures every day and pray over this every day for all of this to be me that's what I want because this is me listen whereby are given unto us exceedingly great and I won't have to worry about clicks and clicks and clicks and all that kind of stuff all of that will dissipate everything will move out of the way amen because once this love divine get in your heart you'll start caring about everybody right the reason why we don't see it because it ain't there hello it is that's the truth of it but when God began to move move you got to have a prayer too don't think you go all of this going to come without prayer you have not because you ask not huh come on somebody that's why the Bible said we can't even take the word of God and strive because that's a man-made thing you're trying to tie somebody up in knots you can't do that you got to be meek with everything right so listen amen un life godliness and uh let's let's just according as his what divine power has has given unto us all things pertaining unto life godliness through the knowledge of him that have called us to glory and virtue H think about it that's why brother B said when God comes in you it's God in you God in you the hope of glory Paul says not I that live the Christ that lives in me whereby are given unto us exceedingly and great and precious that by these you might be what partaker of what the Divine can I put it this way the Divine Soul cuz that's what it is I just read where he took the soul of God ripped it out of him placed it and sent it back as a baptism of the Holy Ghost so he pleases his soul you don't think that's true that's why the Bible said if that seed remain in you you cannot sin why because the Bible said the soul that sinth shall die so he has to put something in you that will never doubt his word and the only thing that he can put in you that will never doubt his word is himself I feel like hey Lord have mercy amen having having having escaped the corruption that is in the world through what lust blessed is a man who overcometh the world what world the world that's beneath lust of the flesh lust of the eye pride of life they are not from above they are from beneath overcome this Hallelujah this is what I love I was teaching the young children on Moses and we've been having a good time but one thing I love about this and I said this other night with Moses one of the things that when when they came to the Red Sea you know uh and and and and Moses waited God God see I like this because because uh uh uh Pharaoh had a scepter and his scepter looked better than Moses scepter Moses scepter was a rod a little piece of stick amen I like Jonathan I always said told him I said he said the rod was St you know taller than Moses and I believe that because God is taller than all of us amen so what happened is he had a a scepter you know those they have a little septer I wish I had a little something to represent they little septer a little something like that you know and all it had to do is either said it like this or whatever it meant that's where if he put it a certain way that means kill him amen that little septer had power to ro man but God took a rod a almond tree woo a a dead alond tree my God and he took that dead alond tree a limb off of it I love it because to me it represented a rib of some sort you know anyway he took that thing now I'm telling you watch I don't God is it's good to me but my point is he takes this thing he looks like he's a king you got two kings two kingdoms against them each other the kingdom of pharaoh against the kingdom of God the Kingdom from beneath versus the kingdom that is from above amen and the Bible said that Moses refused to be called the pharaoh's daughter even though he had the pleasures of the world he had gold he had silver he had education he had everything else if he wanted grapes all he had to say grapes and open his mouth they just dropped them in there he had all of that he had a Jacuzzi y'all know he did and amen he had all of that and he had rather be a bomb on the street than to be Pharaoh's daughter he looked at that stuff and saids that is not of me that's not my that doesn't make me happy that's that's not I've met the almighty God and I have a purpose now watch this he I said like this because he had not met I backtracked that he had not met the almighty God yet but that was only on his teaching his mama was telling him you're a proper child you're the deliverer you're special this what happened to you at your birth God promised you he believed it so he recognized I'm not an Egyptian like you supposed to recognize I'm not a sinner amen I am not of this world I don't care how messed up I am I don't care how much sin I've done what kind of situation I've been in that's not me something need to deliver this right I'm not that it's not what I want to do I feel like a man trapped I need release Lord I need Deliverance come on somebody but the part that I like the love part of our life is that when Moses got all upset because of the people got him all upset and everything else and God says listen the power is within you right like he done met God and all this he's come back and God is saying it's in you why you crying to me that's why a lot of us don't get nothing cu the power is within you and God is waiting for you to do something instead of crying out to him speak the word and go forth he said and he takes that little stick amen he holds it out like that or however he did it the waterers backed up and listen this is what I love about it God so perfect man I tell you what I couldn't have been there because I probably would have never got cross shouting so hard amen but listen he drives up the land it a it's not even mudy you know what they had to do they had to do none of that they go cross man and no muds no nothing I said he built a highway right through the Red Sea right and then he waits and he all of his people get across and I'm off my but I'm bringing it on he said he get what he gets across and then Moses drowned him the same God that opened it up what God the God that was in there amen he caught the thought of God he performed it and at the moment that God wanted him to shut up he shuts it up all of Pharaoh's Army is drowned and what is he saying Israel you're free no matter how many much sin you've done no matter how what don't make no difference what you've done there's no more accusers Hallelujah the Egyptians who may have seen you curse and swear and whatever the case may be they're no more you don't have to that's what baptism does it's supposed to do to you it's supposed to bring you to a conscience that there are no more accusers so what happened is we come to the place and Miriam realized it I've never seen yet anybody shouting dance cuz somebody's dead but Miriam realized these folks ain't from my world they Ain oh come on somebody these are Egyptians they're from the world beneath and we won hallelujah amen we won this battle she took her tamarine she started shouting and dancing the Bible said all the women got together and they oh Lord they tore it up Hallelujah they went to dancing and shouting all of a sudden the anointing hit Moses he sung a new song y'all hear what I'm saying a new song that means they didn't bring nothing over from Egypt that's right amen they had something new going on now I say that because if that could thrill in the natural of millions of people I can't imagine what that Ro was like but know when we get there right oh when all the redeem of the Lord are gathering in hallelujah amen we'll begin to shout and praise God is that right amen so anyway we look at this thing and we say Lord what happened Peter said if you add let this Holy Ghost because that's what brother bam said in that message it took me I don't know how many times I listened to there was a time there was two things two scriptures two messages I used to back up off and that was this one uh uh uh statue of a perfect man and thinking man's filter y'all know what I'm talking about some of y'all ain't listening to it a long time go listen to it and see whether you passed through the filter huh I'd get caught in that thing every time Lord help me Jesus help me Jesus help me amen I'm trying to tell you the truth amen and then when I heard brother Brandon said you don't add to it amen it adds on to you I was set free from that point on I was set free because I realized the quickening power had already quickened the seed but how to come to maturity how to bring up my soul to a statue of a perfect man I failed to see what he said lay in the presence of the son amen not somay oh come on somebody y'all know how we have our Seasons lay in the presence of the sun this is Harvest time now I'm going to have to finish this I'm not going to complete it but let me say it like this people we'll finish this this evening but I want to say this to you by the grace of God there's one quote I want to read to you and I've read this here before and I'm read it tonight again today again and then we'll pick up the even because I don't want to I don't I want you to remember what I'm saying I don't want you to go out here and you know you got so so much or you can't remember you got to focus now I wish I could say that I knew what was in your soul I don't know only you know what's in your soul y'all hear what I'm saying only you if you have the faith to believe that you're bride I believe that you are because only God can give you that you may not even understand why I could be bride and I'm making so many mistakes h i put it this way you're not making no many no more mistakes than any of us one mistake is the whole law you make one mistake you're guilty of the whole so there's no one that's making less mistakes all of us are making the same all it takes is one one error oh come on somebody all it takes is one error and you're guilty of the whole so it takes Grace Amen to bring us up the L y'all hear what I'm saying but listen what he says Amen in the deity of Jesus Christ you heard me say this before and I'm close with this and then we'll come this evening and finish it out you're not going to like this one too good but swalled it's like castol amen you can be ever so good you can live a clean life you can go to church every day you can sacrifice every day you can give up part of your money you can give up all the sins of the world and everything and live just as true and faithful as you can and you'll miss Heaven just as far as East is from the West that's right it isn't by goodness that we are saved but it is by the mercy that we're bought that God wanted to make Sons and Daughters see that's what we see I don't ever think you don't I'm good you ain't good amen I don't care how good you can get you still are not good that's not what saved you there's only one Jesus said that's good and that's God you can do it all and you miss the grace of God that's right it isn't the Good by goodness that we are saved but it's by the mercy that we're bought that God wanted to make Sons and Daughters goodness never makes them the spirit of God makes them amen hello going right back to Peter the spirit of God you look at this and maybe that is I don't know about you but those virtues was formed into a mountain I'm like Caleb give me my Mountain oh y'all didn't get excited but that's the way I see it give me my Mountain I want it Lord hallelujah glory to God if it wasn't so he wouldn't have sent the Holy Ghost how could the Holy Ghost be comp complete unless or how could the contact be complete Jesus said I go away and yet I'll come again and be with you even in you pray the father and he'll give you the Holy Ghost he will abide forever and people put their names on their church books trying to turn a new page on Christmas day trying to walk Yonder at church and just pay a a few tributes to the manger back Yonder when the Holy Ghost pushes you just where the lives right excuse me when the Holy Ghost pushes you just to where the lives right lives right and the word of God and so bind so blind they walk around saying well that's a bunch of Holy Rollers just like it was in the days of Noah so is it now so who what I'm saying is this uh if if the prophet of God said this is the way it was in the days of Noah this is the way it was scarf was everywhere church members amen people coming to church amen and their minds are not even there they're just setting in it being religious you know what I'm saying people who don't know just like I said the other day a 18year old boy who kept telling his parents God was getting ready to take him home well they said well we're going to send you to college no I'm not going to college because God is going to take me home I'm going to heaven they didn't want to believe him so the one evening I I did I made a mistake in saying what he was doing he was praying in the house his mom was there he get up from prayer he stands he falls dead 18 year old Christian but he was so in contact with God he knew when he was going home praying people praying and after he gets up from prayer he just Falls dead they did an oopsy and the doctor said there ain't nothing wrong with him just natural call it didn't know it was not natural it was Supernatural and like I said today a the other day I said how do you know brother BR said how do you know these missing people ain't part of the Rapture he said God can be doing it right now they missing and nobody know where they at
