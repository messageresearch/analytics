look up Jesus guys because my god Horus to your world ligado God then you order a proper salute reanima creaminess of our lives like God of our hearts my mind god help us to enter into the service of the Lord and you know a fellowship had also fellowship in Sarasota pastors birth dynasty me in the access to bring his greetings and also brought grid is from my dad Latonia drew visa he asked the British dreariness like I said I grew up listening to but I broke sing and preach you know and you know we were really blessed by his ministry in Africa I hate it I'm pretty sure he doesn't know and I'm not a preacher I'm just like it's fair you know you know you have one of the best features that God can ever give in books and also we have my friend here for the Paul you know with his ministry I've watched his ministry evolve and you know it umbels me to see how God can transform the life of a man and just that is just sold out and coming here to God without taking much our time tonight I just want to go into the scriptures and just resort there's nothing else I want to preach that he hasn't read this weekend you know it's kind of all over amen so it just just cities as the desert to the g-seven cost me we just add you know I want to return our scriptures Book of Luke chapter 4 if you see me talking to files just tell me slow down Luke chapter 4 verse 16 you know the preaching of the word is not something you're gonna ever get comfortable doing you know you even if you didn't for years and years sometimes your nurse said him and he is like oh Lord iversity you know but if we can just let go of ourselves and let the Lord up as well you know and it will be done we strongly speak to us look forth 16 to 21 if you just say Amen I when it came to Nazareth where he had been brought up and as his custom was he went to synagogue on the Sabbath day and stood up for to read and there was delivered unto Him the book of Isaiah saw the Prophet Isaiah's and he had opened the book he found the place where it was written the Spirit of the Lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach deliverance to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind to set at liberty them that are bruised to pretty acceptable year of the Lord and I closed the book and it gave it again to the minister and sat down and the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue was fastened on him when I have our seat I have one more Bible book I want us to read but one thing that really caught my attention and this massive just read was that from the time this prophecy was given by Prophet Isaiah's nobody nobody openly no prophet other than as a as a referent a scripture because he was not concerning them at all it wasn't meant for them and then Jesus came because he knew his purpose he knew his role in the world he had a revelation of his call in his ministry and he went directly and I read from that part he didn't finish it because he wasn't supposed to finish it he knew what his ministry was all about and acts three chapters except the three verse one and I love the book of Acts because it's the only book in the New Testament that I did not finish with an Amen because he still a continuous process he still being written program said the Bride of Christ is the conjugation of the book of Acts amen actually three one two six and now Peter and John went up together into the temple of the out and at the hour of prayer being the ninth hour and the setting man lame from his mother's womb was carried on the late daily at the gate of the temple which is called beautiful and axe arms of them that entered in the temple was st. Peter and John about to go in the temple axe and axe and noms I'm Peter fastened his eyes upon him with John said look on us he gave heed unto them expecting to receive something now this guy had an expectation and it was expected something just like I was supposed to be when we come to the house of the Lord we come to expectation you know where Isaiah Brooks were saying that is afternoon I said when I go to church I'm full of expectation and you don't get if you didn't receive you had an expectation but his expectation was not met you know sometimes we can get really comfortable in their situation their condition and the expectation is limited to their condition you know I've come across you know beggars in the street a tax for harms you know hey can I get a doll I just want to buy lunch and they offer them to buy food and I get mad at you you happen to put Aaron this guy was an accident for money was like can I get get some food down I was so money on buy some food you say okay why not so Aaron walked into the restaurant I bought a big breakfast thing we gave it to this guy he was pissed it took it was really married to big the breakfast and threw it in the trash I want money but you say one breakfast you know his expectation was not what they got eating it to eat but what it what it asks for what it was a spectrum was not what he was getting but what he was expecting it was not his need he needed deliverance and the same thing needs to eat but he was it was cut up in spirit of drugs and the same as this guy I can this guy being that guy I'll put it up that was a good bit of Aaron and his expectation was to get some money but they ain't got it the impedence said Silvan good I have none but as such as I am a give D in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk your expectation is always gonna be met by God you know the more expectation you have the more you get from God so tonight briefly I want to exhort us on a tongue on a topic God was keen on him you know God was keen on him you know I really cool why is getting that ready program sir there's nothing that would defeat Satan there's never been nothing on earth yet that would ever defeat the devil like the Word of God he said Jesus used it in this great battle he said it is written you know this is an image right I can access any one in the room tell me who this person is and then the best we can do the best we can do is try to figure out who has a shape of head and we start looking at how we can make all that guess we want because we this is not our image we didn't scare this it's not now my we have no preconception of what this is but the artist the person does make drawing the image knows what he's trying to accomplish it knows exactly who is trying to draw and this is what our out I would I would I would say God was in the beginning there was no face on him it was not a God he was just accept itself existing one and it longs for fellowship you bursted got a lungful fellowship so bad and he tried to figure out how to do it you know enjoy the creation he had he enjoyed everything but he just so longed for a mock for a bigger fellowship you wanted to fellowship he wants to feel what man was feeling and then that pushed him to create man he said in Genesis chapter chapter 1 he says and let us make man now on image chapter 3 excuse me and he created man in his own image but still there was no face on him the prophets of old the Saints of old didn't they know his voice you can tell this is God's talking but how can you so much fall in love with somebody every system so much without seeing their face you know you're just like a young mother's trying to get married I was trying to get married and I was praying to the Lord for you for you're a bride in and now you know people would give me more sort of advices and all that we were trying to like much make I'll go to conventions lay every sin that sister and you know I was sharing the words last night but that wasn't what I wanted that wasn't what I wanted because I believe there has to be a physical attraction it has to be a physical attraction you know and sometimes God is going to tell you suppose this is your this is your spouse it's well verdant for you sometimes it doesn't happen that way but there was no attraction you know a and this people know just man could only relate with God so far because they couldn't see him Moses would love to see God he said God can I see your face if he knew his presence he knows his voice like the back of his head but he wanted to see girls face and it's a god Kenny please put his keen on yourself I'm a spirit you can't see me you can't stand it and God God was passivated and the expectation of Moses and said okay go stand on the other side at the back of the rock and I to yourself and I'll reveal myself what Moses saw was this sketch he couldn't see this because there was no skin on you Moses could not see the face of God he saw the back of God and he almost was overwhelmed when a god of the mountain it was said Moses we don't want us don't look at us just turn your back and talk to us because it was so engulfed by the partial glory of God and you know in in Genesis chapter 2 God gave man his word and man was charged with the task to pull its keen on his word god I'd given man dominion over everything in the garden everything even Bream say they said I can imagine God accident am Adam to to name the animals because Adam was part of God so he could name the animals Algar one them to be named there was no one animal that Eden missed he actually named an alga want him to be named and they gave him dominion and power one of them to become an explorer the power has given to them Idol oh yeah I'm just gonna take my time tonight and you know we find out along the line because in Chapter three that even believe the word just like our husband deed just like many people come to church today be sick husband believes the word the sister believes the world but when it comes to the part of putting the skin on the world that's what the problem is the devil is fine with you quoting the world it's fun watching quotes in the sermon book that seals a nod and a shout all the mysteries it's fine but when it comes to the part of you put in the skin on that word he has a problem and and he failed in the book of Genesis chapter three are putting the skin on the world all that she needed was when it ever approached her to put a skin on that word and there was not gonna come with you cube based on what you don't know he's gonna use familiar places it's gonna lose you the things you know he knows we have comfortable yet we have confidence in the world so he's gonna use the word that's what it's going to use and that was very con is a chronic bastard that guy he projects is a conception of God to us because when he went to eat he said I've got not said God saw me I would go tell you not to eat of that tree because he doesn't want you to be like you that was his own conception of God but if you have known better because Brabham said in the cool of the evening the the the Lord would descend fellowship with Adam and Eve so she should have known better but she failed I putting the skin on the world but aware that you failed the second even fail because we have a commission to put his skin on God and the Word of God has been revealed to us in this last day to put a skin on God hallelujah the word has given to us today is not given toes to decorate ourselves I'm a grown up you got a message believe us you do not even miss a bit of ourselves you're gonna see the big pillar of fire the pyramids those things are ok but our just images what as the image is done to you so we have shelves or summer books and they will brag about how many summer books the avenir in here in India on their shelves and it's way more than that I grew up seeing ministers come to the police with suitcase of summer books and they will quote sermons after Salmons after Salmons after Salmons but where was the life you know if my men even read the story the programmer said about that guy that could not read it just got converted and his daughter was gonna have a party in the house if she was gonna carry on a warden I said daddy you all is crummy ok I need you to be quiet I'm gonna put you up in the Arctic and do say a word I'm gonna have my friends over you said ok it's fine he said I'm gonna take the Bible word for me cuz whenever either Bible you answer just scream but one other good time he said go ahead she thought she got a guy but true believer I would see God in everything she gave me she gave my dad I'm a drug graphic book y'all on the story and the guy was in the Artic just was flipping through the pages flip them to pretties and it screamed and you thought I was shocked like wow I didn't give him his Bible I have his Bible what made a guy scream he saw God in geography Alleluia he saw God in geography and I true child of God was see God in every circumstance never tries any trouble they go through they will see God in him amen problem of the people today is the lack of vulnerability to the word when the word is coming forth we start dividing the wood but not rightfully if I was to rightfully divided world we start divided with all that is for brother Paul that is for sister Nancy that is for Webber brother Sam that is what that sister that's for that brother and then people screaming shadow most a Matt they say Amen on your behalf because they knows something about you but the moment it was started striking that condition they keep quiet I don't see the church so many times away so many times and it gets the guests are comfortable their image was loud glory brothers preach they become from pooping on Bank on the public for the moment start talking about the condition just sit down get quiet where was the Amen that's right because people just did they prefer to rightfully divide a world for other people when the world is coming I don't care about my brother at that time I don't care about nobody at that time I gotta focus on me because he's talking to me I got a personal personalized a would've done for me and make it a reality because you know you know when my wife is talking to me I don't need y'all listening to what I'm saying with my wife when I'm talking to my wife nobody this is what I'm saying what anybody else is saying because this is for this message is for she has to personalize it that's why I do what I've got calls for separation and that's why before God can do with a man gotta separate that man first because of distraction Alleluia you know like I said our problem is lack of vulnerability Eve was vulnerable to the wrong thing she was vulnerable to what is suffering not to say instead of the word you know she was porous and she was she was the weaker weaker link that the devil could use but Braun said someone know he knew better than to approach Adam because Adam was part of God it wasn't part of God so he knew who to attack and the problem said as well I'm gonna hide myself a glass a he said um I said Adam did not fall so he didn't fall he knew what the word was but you have to stand in line in the gap for his wife because he knew that if he doesn't do that God is gonna destroy her because she was not part of him but in you go would not destroy him so he stood in the gap Alleluia no question - where does this kid ever at all it does not scare him we conclude his triplets evenly never call the scriptures to Jesus when he was on on the mountain it knows how to do it and that's why sometimes I don't like on social media or even in person I don't like getting myself involved in in in scriptural debates that's not what they're called us to do because we have so much intellectuals that would defeat our intellects they've studied the Bible back to back they know everything about it but the problem is that it's already knowledge form onto the light of God strike that seed in your heart it's gonna become a regular book so that garden comes to defend the word he caught us to become the world and Eve failed at that part of becoming the world Alleluia you know God given Dominion that was Genesis 1:26 given dominion over everything everything you know meaning that they had a right to do whatever they want if it if I don't return the money I doesn't like his view he can change his view Mountain move to the west I need to see under city song song sunrise he could do all of that that power you know and and and it was it was it was it was I believe God would wake up the money I mean you would watch us you know wake up in the morning just admire his creation so yeah you don't know the right thing son you exploring the pop given to you which is what God wants us to do God give them dominion Genesis 1:26 right quick my Bibles pretty near so I can't I have like I can flip the pages right yeah Genesis 1:26 he said then God said let us make my now only meeting our likeness and let them have dominion over all the fish of the sea over the fowl of the air and the cattle and over the earth and over every creeping thing you intrepid thing that creepeth upon the earth and God couldn't man in his own image and he made of God clearly eat you know male and female created he them and God bless them multiply them I said and blessings and God said let them be fruitful multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it so in essence God given Dominion control power over everything but if you look closely at a picture of what happened in Genesis chapter 3 Eve was deceived by a lower harder the shopping was also part of the Dominion that God gave them that was in lower order she was deceived by the lower order and she failed to you to lie the dominant God had given them rabbits is one shot she's a thousand two shot chased 10,000 if you like look at the ratio one thousand to ten thousand I was at possible because there's power unity and you failed like the women of this generation to ID under the headship of her husband she Club easily brought his suffering over to our husband but she didn't do that and that's the simple way it is today in our generation with even sisters in the church the Word of God is the absolute garden commanding man to listen to the woman you need now we have to balance it well what brother did he just say that that wasn't God's commandment there's no way in the scriptures that says listen to your own wives but you have to balance it it's a row the woman has to play she's an ALP me and what is the function for help me support you don't know it all well the other hand he also have to see that four out of the five senses God gave man he's in the head you could see you could smell you could taste equal year isn't a head and the once a man gives you the ring and again married he becomes a she by the same time if you have the speed of gonna you you won't walk around they all sing and the head of his also you have to listen to me you don't have to remind your wife your partner that once the see Christ you'll see that you submitted to the word Christ your head sheep they will follow suit so if failed at that point to hide under the headship of a husband and one see table as yet see there is no covering there's no carbon so she felt will a lesser order something God already given a dominion over I mean it was today I'm last same situation we follow two we have dominion over principalities of powers and powers in the name of Jesus Christ coming brother Paul I'm gonna show you something the Bible come on it got the law coming out in his creatures he said resist the devil what happened he didn't resist but he didn't I was gonna attack that one and all that is coming in the book of Job the look but the lot access said this is the devil where you coming from he said from true frontier earth because he's consistent that guy does not sleep it doesn't take breaks he's a wonder it was going all over the place all over the place and once that guy sees that you carry something that is more than he is beyond him he's gonna start starting you what is it like to do what is this app it look like he start studying you and it's gonna strike at the time you least expect it's not gonna tell you it's coming many times to come to church on Sundays I wish I were young we enjoyed the presence of the Lord and we like um I'm so blessed but that was waiting for you right on Monday morning it's ready the Bible says resist grad I resist it's a constant action resist you see that that is what a local - OH - god bless my brother but I'm intense ivory steady devil about the word is night even in thy mouth and we don't use what we have been given number one you can't you cannot outsmart the devil we cannot outwit the devil because that's not what God told us to do we have to do what if did not do I don't know as she pushes which is the word of God and we use the word is given abuse our power our armor to fight the devil the devil and shall flee from you how many times this day we struggle from the spirits of lower order stop exercising our Dominion Alleluia bar Bramson you can get every doctrine right every word right and instantly business to be recovering for evil spirits says Eve quoted the word - but she'll like the summit and our attitude our actions were the Word of God is gonna trigger in fact a reaction if disobedience caused the body change from from eternity into time and our attitude and our actions towards God through the wood is also gonna cause a body change he's gonna cause a body change either to destruction or to rapture Alleluia amen the body change in the beginning was the curse on to even Adam because of that disobedience but same body change and the bride its last day it's gonna be a blessing to us Alleluia the body change gonna be a blessing to us hallelujah so where you failed in the beginning this second heap the Bride of Christ will not fail Alleluia because she has received a revelation of the word of God and she has become the word she has yunxi able to put a skin on the girl in the Word of God for a day Alleluia one of the major challenge we're talking about is last night in in every age and dispensation is that we we we replace our culture and traditions we esteem it over the Word of God we always extend our culture and tradition by the Word of God this is how we did it back home some of us up and I in America decide we used to do back home that we did it and we forget that the absolute is the Word of God our culture and stay with the word Alleluia so we as team culture and traditions and our Creed over the Word of God now it's not a matter of what the world says anymore but a matter of what my pastor says the matter of what my church says and people go as far as saying that every church is autonomous what God is not the author of confusion is what is supreme and for the world to have its preeminence in us we have to accept it and after we accept it we have to believe it before the world can have this place in our life amen Acts chapter 3 verse 1 6 X 3 1 2 6 I'm gonna go back that number way that earlier so on this fateful morning I can imagine Satan was laying in bed you know it wasn't sleepy because sleeping doesn't like to sleep but we just lay in bed time to strategize outer planets day and instigate against each other now which brothers gonna turn against a pastor and which aren't figure that out it was fine if many people was gathering at Pentecost he knew that was going on but he did none of the pores of the God read because it was not you he's not God he doesn't know what's gonna happen prior to happening that is what makes him a devil but God knowing what's gonna happen before it happens knowing everything from the beginning to the end it makes him God so it was fine we didn't eat it he had it out no problem but then when is Saudi effective what happened on Pentecost had a problem with that then he came back to this man okay and the last day I will put my spirit upon all flesh oh wow why did I allow this it was too late for him then he started gathering people around this book choir drunk started putting stuff in the mind of the people these people are crazy they lose in your mind by the same time this people could understand the languages of this other or the disc Jews were speaking Bible said they understood the language of these people they spoke different languages so it was it was confusing to them as well but he still try to stop it now which is what he does best it tries to stop the move of God well you can't stop it hallelujah he tried all that but but then after that they express it on the upper unchanged the people it was a reaction to what happened in the upper room and which is what we saw in Peter and John and when it saw that they knew that man he had a problem with that the devil was fine with you quoting the world like I said it's fine everything you do but when it gets the point of view putting the skin on the Word of God he has a problem with it Alleluia and I'm so glad this tonight that Kaveri give us power to impact life Alleluia and I can look at my son and I'm prey of prefer to live Holy Spirit over him I can look at my brother and impact life in any aspect of their life I can impact them in a great way that the doctor cannot because that is the essence of Calvary you know my product could be neither be only ghost and I could put my hands on my brother pray for the only ghost upon him and he receives he only goes Alleluia and you know and this is what the devil is having problem with there was family Joe Jesus alone when this is the night is 72 disciples following he had a problem I can have these people equipping these people with power it was not fine with that I never would be 72 people when they became 12 instead a problem with that it's time to enter into one of them because it wasn't fine with it that's not what I wanted Alleluia we could see the extreme example you know a job when job was busy sacrificing for his children would I even know if the sins or not it was it was it didn't have not so much problem with that well job started testifying in his trial when he called the revelation or what it was going through I started testifying I know my redeemer liveth and is able to raise me up on the last days he had a problem with that he had a problem with that Alleluia and this shows the opponents of Revelation to man and my church I was talking not so long ago about entity our believers are losing the identity when I was growing up I keep some when I was growing up my dad I'm only 31 I grew up in church and I didn't have any experience but I loved going to church gospel play music now see my friends and I also gone to Sunday school because of the cookies out what they give out hallelujah the judge now I was I was gonna I was always excited because I know this unexpected Chad's gonna give us goodies I knew it my mom raised oh she taught us we had our children's books on the voice of God and all that we knew story of the prophet a prophet and although I know they always gonna have question about that you know I love that but then they had to come a time when actually my personal experience and that was the shaking our was trying our that was fine with me going to church he was family playing music in church and I was a pastor's kid as well you know if it was found with that and then I I've always been shoot it we don't we all went to school my brothers went to school in the same state as well relieved but I wasn't under one school far away from home because I wanted my freedom and I chose a major that no snow state very close so I stayed at so I wanted like four states away from all so the first time my parents followed me to school was my first day of school and I didn't see them after that because I didn't wanted to come because I just wanted to have my own experience in the wrong way and I was doing my thing going to school even my life I don't want to serve God I don't want to do nothing because I was fed up but the moment a revelation was struck the moment I add my own experience each hate my life it changed the way I saw stuff he's changed my desires brother are you perfect no I'm not I'm far from perfect I'm probably the worst sinner in this room tonight but the grace of God and a revelation of the word of God changed my mindset change my desires the friends I kept before I don't want them in no more Alleluia so revelation is very very important in your process of becoming the word in the process of people in skin on the world you first have to discern the world is this word for me like Jesus this is for what is this word for my day and what is the expectation of the world for me in this last day when you know that and they you have a revelation of the wood that is given for your day it changes everything about you it changes everything about you Alleluia look 18 verse 8 it says when it Son of man cometh shall you find faith on earth and is because and this last is the love of man is waxing cold do they want to go to church don't wanna go to church science has made everything so easy for people excuse me you just want to sit down on screen services it's the same thing no it's not can you get fueled by eating bye bye bye bye bye but can you get filled by to eat eat it from the TV it came from the TV no matter how good your food looks on the TV it's not as same as the food and been in front of you you never get filled is only gonna make you salivate that's all it is gonna do for you but wait at the presence of the food it triggers something in you like this afternoon what when I saw my my burger and in front of me my my plate front whoa whoa I mean I just wanted to dig in because I doused my food and I could see I saw the same food in the picture he didn't do nothing to me but all of a sudden we get satisfied by streaming live services streaming service at home any comfort of our own in a pumpkin or water like a cinema and would have the same experience it doesn't work that way see you have to put in the Sun in the form of effort for God to bless it i loo here I leave an hour and a half away from open from church Hey and it's a big struggle I walk in auto auto business I walk a lot of hours 60 70 80 hours a week I start to go to church and then it made a mandatory for us to work on Sundays I was like I'm not gonna work on Sundays I said it's against my religion what religion is that I'm a Christian we are Christians - I was like I don't know buy your Christianity cuz my kind of Christians look go we don't go to work on Sundays and they had a problem with that he said well we can't promote you as I'm fine with that I'm not gonna go to wall do you even go trigger at all maybe just sit at home I said I want to work on Sony's I said no sir I'll give my church life trim so you can see me a church where it's not airing amen if he starts any missing that's me that's me worship because that's what I'm called to do but then at the same time what I'm saying gonna match my life cuz I gotta go to church I gotta go to work they gonna make sure that okay we've seen this guy in church but it is life matching I'm going to audit services or I meant a contract in a week doors open oh wow what's the church again Sarasota he travel now and after church do you know how many churches in Tampa I was like listen y'all I don't get it I said he's something that no churches in Tampa but my church is different that churches they can work on Sundays in my church we can't work on Sundays so we go to church and it's a bible-believing Church but everybody pretty scriptures like no sir II said we don't when instead of seeing our I was breaking nothing okay we respect that it's okay so one of my busses is the Miss honest I didn't know so when he started working I saw his truck at is this big Mason logo on his tow each sound like I haven't seen Mason its time before cries no business with them so did the sketch in who was like or they say didn't work Sundays I say yeah I don't want Sundays so you got a problem with that not really but it's not fair towards the rest of us they're working on Sundays I was like our religion is different it's that oh you're Christian I said yeah he said I'm a Christian too I was like our standard is different he said well are you missing least oh yeah oh yeah me see my brother I was like no I'm not your brother I said I'm a different mission it's what kind of missions after Jesus mission is that is what I believe it said well I want to go to your church say you're coming church with me I said I'll be great like I texted me an address and he looked up the church and I saw the website he said I'm not coming your church anymore what's going on John I'm gonna come to your church no more I said why see well it's not my kind of Christianity I said that's exactly why I can't work on Sundays Alleluia so we are alive as a match our testimony our revelation because if we have all this knowledge of the word of God and there's no life to back it up then it's a waste just like if she had a knowledge of the world she actually knew it she knew what God said she knew what God wanted she knew the expectation but there was no life to back it up because for every one who got would say Amen - for everyone go we jump and shout and rejoice for the devil's gonna trials Alleluia you know I could see Jesus looked through the banister of eternity and city's last days and I believe that's why he talked to these are posters the way talk to them before yeah he was taken up you know he shot a son of mine find faith on earth now people see faith as sometimes really ambiguous until I got a revelation about the grace of God I didn't understand what faith was myself many of us have all think we have faith the Bible says faith is the substance of things hoped for he's an evidence of the things unseen I mean fate is like me any girls were said Elias I want to do I want you to jump through this wall now is me believing without thinking about it that there's no well there's no door on this wall and I just jumped right through it because I know that EDA has promised to commanded me to jump through the waters gonna open your way for me put a door in the wall before I get to the wall Alleluia so Jesus not a concern because he could look what it was it was the Creator I can't believe what is gonna happen this last I don't of this kind of faith and you could read also seen some example Brown was talking about the last days it was I don't want to be there I don't want to wait to see if he could complain so much I've always gone on his generation the way did how much more now and I see people get really mad when the preaching of the word of God is going on they get really furious I simple to talk back to the minister because they had a problem with the word you can't be part of the word enough problem with the world no that's conflictual God don't work that way people get so so mad at the preacher why because the world is talking about their condition and they start up them to be repentant I'm the vulnerable to the work they can't I many of us today is putting the skin on the Word of God there's thousands and thousands of scriptures promises in the Bible about our our last day for the bride I'm only up there people for the water because I can't submerge em alive lead it up by the Word of God by the fire be always prayed and people around me won't benefit from it see one of the problems we have in this message because one I remember we're talking one time on why our churches you know it's not growing like we expect them to grow first we live in last day it's not gonna grow what I talking about I'm not expecting to grow because the crowd has to be trimmed and we've been losing a lot of people that's why I left with a living message at the same time you know I would get so confused and sad and depressed when people leave a message oh brother it was on fire he would preach a roof down and he left a message like that and yet it's cursed why are we getting discouraged why because we put so much expectation on that man it's not about a man is the word of God God could put a little child in here - pooping and God's gonna speak to branch out God spoke to a donkey and that Islamic the donkey a God and we made God out of man and we're very quick to spread rumors about people leaving the church but I've never had a war room about people joining the church I don't know one single rumor about God added to the church I want testimonies like that if gonna put your energy to complain about to deliver the message I want put your energy to go to to tell me also when people join the church when people get saved let me give the light of Jesus Christ when we get baptized I want to send energy on stuff like that I don't know yet amen Romans 8:19 I'm gonna write up shortly it says for the creation waits in eager expectation I'm reading the New International Version for the creation awaits an egg act stations for the children of God to be revealed I can go to different examples and a business creatures of this verse I just read when God gave man Dominion was the exciting thing to see you know you wanna okay what what does both of the creation why does krishna waits in eager expectation is son of chicken son of God you know got to be revealed why mean the trees can talk they ain't gonna mind but then the same scripture says that if man kicks quietiy rocks we shout there are creations of God and the purpose of the Christians of God is to worship God to bring glory back to him hallelujah look at how climate change will occur what is going around the world right now and so much cares and we act like reacting Brannon like as if somebody never told the body before it's nothing brand-new it's been said but Isaiah was shaken when I was last night this quote of brother Branham are we the right quick on what is going on right now you know who's got paragraph 8 but I Brown was praying said grant Lord that something will be said tonight or done that will cause the way words to turn to Christ for we believe and feel pressed in the spirit that the great the great the great judgments upon the lands in these last days plagues disease germs already bred up to be scattered throughout the nation's no doctor knew the doctor no even out to take a hold of it Oh God would have to believe in divine alien dead when nations are breathing germs together to pass them into bumps and millions died in ours over it that's exactly what is going on and then we I was at the airport on Friday and I was just laughing no it wasn't just because I was because I was nonchalant I wasn't but I saw people soak eating up like a sieve they can bypass these discs out there this lady she had a rubber gloves on she had surgical gloves or covers on her shoes ready pack of our distinctive wipes right on our suitcases like that she can wipe in everything I'm like what in the world is going I was gonna record I don't get in trouble I was just laughing I go to the bathroom opening the door with your elbows they thing they are covered no you know the only car we have today that is generous the blood of Jesus Christ hallelujah he said Max's sin says these signs shall follow them that believe the problem is that they have no faith they're not believe in science and wonders it's postponed to believers now I believe is seeking for size of honest as I don't send people go from meetings to meetings I mean it's a minister meetings after meetings after meetings go out all over looking for revival look for signs and wonders they would never get it and that was wasting their time because what you're looking for right is here it says science I wanna shape follow to believe is that promises established already it's established already all we gotta do is walk into it walk into it and as a problem of the people you want to be spoon-fed they want a pastor to really quote for them the one password read the Bible verses to them and send them text to read or really bad a certain Bible verse every day the one a pastor talk to your daughter that can't cook fish you won't talk Massa talk to the son that oz dreads on his head the one that passed her to come up them wash their car the one a pastor talk to their wife for keeping us dirty what are we doing what are we doing there's so much expectation on the ministry we have pastors dying by the day we have ministers struggling and dying because they bought too much there's too much burden on them and we Babel says this this desire to sin sell make off the spirit desire and you have to do your work your own part as well my son just like a crawling and I started moving all up so when I get him for work I'm very tired I said his name is alive so we call him EJ I said EJ what's going on buddy and it starts smiling and they would sit up I'm so tired because boys like that if you don't show that you one is help you won't do it for you because God is not for a Christmas just walk around us with this bag and say hey you you take what a wisdom you knowledge you take a new house you take discernment you I don't do it like that you have to desire it first and when he sees your anger is gonna give it to you Alleluia so if we don't make the attempt God won't give it to us and then we put so much expectation on pastors I can tell you stories on and on and on because I was so close to to the to the ministry when I was growing up now is it that is boy and I love stories I was just yeah I understand but growing up I played back to play them back my mom like what I've seen chart name was trying to borrow back the tide the paid on Sunday Pro pastor but that time opinion sunny collaborate back I will give you all the boy is real is happening I tell you what I see people expected fellowship everyday after Sunday service with a pastor and one pastor to pay for their food all the time you don't have to pay the abuse how many times out of the abundance of your hearth I said listen I'm gonna go to pastors today house today I'm gonna take him out to go eat whatever he wants I'm gonna be a blessing to my pastor today it doesn't happen anymore it doesn't it does not happen everybody expects everything from the pastor it's so bad that people only see pastor on Wednesdays on Sundays on the journey services or when they in trouble that's when they know the pastor's phone number what happens they would have been government a pastor I appreciate your ministry tonight god bless I'm really blessed just remote stay encouraged nobody does that so that tells me that you're selfish and a believer is not supposed to be selfish Christianity is a lively for others including your pastor your pastor is not always on a percent of fire it doesn't happen that way when I was in Middle School I saw his class captain my classification was a whole lot probably 120 students I wasn't right up those boys and I want to share this guys in class and when I was like 16 guys in class now so that's 26 27 you expect them to listen to me it's not possible I was too much job for me and I was playful so when I can get everything ready everybody right your class getting in trouble and we all get whooped hung get punished and the house somewhere it is in the house of God if you don't protect the ministry you're not gonna reap the fruits of that ministry as you ought to you know support the ministry younger eat the fruit of min strategy so also the Bible says bear each other's Borden that's part of the words for the patina but we're now it's about me me me me me me me I've not seen so much self-centered spirits in my labyrinth I moved to this part of the world and it's spreading because America is the number one seed of influence when it comes to anything in the world marriage sports fashion whatever America it is it is it is America because it's the power of the world is the capital of the world pretty much and it's all about me me me me me me so it's not as people getting married and I'm gonna have nothing to do with the X X and my family there's a road of people playing your life I can forget about a parent that raised you spend all the time to take care of you all your life I just leave with the answer and forget about them and just hey they'll be fine your parents are suffering but you keep changing your car and you're buying expensive stuff puts your parents madness is on and you're filing your mother so that your days may be long and that is the spirit that is its kind of culture we are embodying our children to not care about anybody except themselves I'm pretty I'm very glad I grew up when I grew up when I was a little child I saw so many things that happen the house of God I'm sick of putting on people's heart after service to go many started people's needs financially economically one not spiritually many times I've seen my mom cook early Sunday morning let me cook it for us know we have faster this money we I thought my cooking for she's gonna cook after church she's not bring the food to one family out of the blue I'm like mom and then we I find out later in the week when he could finally cause I say listen sister Tony I didn't know we do have food in the house how do you know we were struggling it wasn't just my mom several people in the house of God I sent people you did themselves too much to the Word of God to the Spirit of God that they built led by the spirit cause Bible says this sham led by the spirit and they shall be called sons and daughters of God and I see that were right now but so selfish so self-centered you won't have no value at all in the eyes of God they're gonna come late they doesn't complain is too hot you companies to code it complete the song good song was sung at a wrong key they observe everything excuse me and adds them what role did you play in the service today zero they didn't pray for the service they did come an expectation the probably commence petition was were wrong as potential what is wrong with people lack of the only ghost majority of them have the knowledge up here they will quote you the message they will tell you why your background proceed and they go tell your brand preacher of that sermon one is in alignment that I was in Tampa they know all of that but when they sure that comes when it's time for them to act the word they got a problem they wouldn't wanna be exhorted they don't want to be exactly don't want to correct it how we forgot so many times that in - feet all egos will be open to exhortation there's gonna be humble in minot Spirit of God with that on them they're very open to it no matter how long the beam of faith don't say what are you talking about my father was on the program in the ministry I was they came up with a Branham pride that is no liner with the word of God I suppose said he said humanly speaking of my apostle of apostles it was goodbye the best colors in the country he knew it he knew the word some of the things was fighting for against the church he could prove it by his theology but that's how far he's known it could bring him but the moment he had a revelation go to open his eyes and that voice cried to him Paul what's so excuse me why persecuted on me what wording was the Lord I was talking he knew it why because God Brandon in revelation at that time and sometimes try to take the role of the oldest spirit it's not about being disciples because many times bring people to church and we don't stay on our brother we don't stand on our sister that must bring them to church I'm establishment of the world oh we have a proverb little message amen amen my brother is fine no they're supposed to be disciples of each other our people are growing Christ a pea or sister grow in Christ and that's what the problem is today but one day I said once the revelation struck Paul is were changed it was humble that pride our ego was gone out of him because the knowledge of the word of God is only gonna pump you up Alleluia you know it's only gonna pump you up and that's why you see the way people actually church today hallelujah I'm gonna retire on up it said for to put the skin on the Word of God the word after the first quickened in you and then after that's gonna manifest it because if pregnant women cannot can hide the pregnancy no way you can only hide it so far well after why people gonna know you're pregnant that I start throwing up fashion show me symptoms of pregnancy or something's gonna happen in my own case before we got married said we're gonna wait like two years before we have a child someone might finish in nursing school now if I was gonna finish my masters the hardest stuff you know you know how we as human beings are this plant stuff you know 2018 December my life was pregnant I did not know it was my birthday so she flew me out to New Orleans with there four days we planned this trip she told me this was going on day 1 day 2 and on and on but when it's not for us to wake up she's still sleeping I need that tired I know it's a baby let's go look I'm so tired like what we already well rested she was I'm tired I was blind I didn't let it what does become flashing her I didn't know so we came out from our tree woods happy for 3 straight lines I didn't know my wife was pregnant I did not know she go pregnant and begin up December January February and then in March it wasn't really shown that time those first three months some people are lucky shows right here some P doesn't really show and I was sitting there when I got back from night from from from from working I was sitting there just trying to follow the news and we were talking control my hand and she said I'm pregnant I have the blue are you gonna say just like that and she said how am I supposed to say I said our nose how long have you been pregnant I don't know it's probably three months about what I said up the bed because it was getting to a point where she couldn't hide the pregnancy anymore I got to tell this guy and she was scared because I said I wanted us to wait she definitely wasn't conceived by the oldest period it wasn't so like I was saying you can hide where your field if I put it if I get a big drum a metal drum and it's empty and I roll it down it's gonna make the loudest noise but when it's filled it doesn't make no noise and it's our kinda find people who are live in the world or people who have filled in church they make the loudest noise there's no everything they see everything is wrong because they are empty because emptiness makes the loudest noise says the Chinese proverb people are empty they are not filled so they have everything say about everything you got a problem with everything but a man that is filled that's different it says less when it's not in fellowship he's ready to fellowship you see the true color comes out because they join the fellowship but Bram's that we draw strength from each other just like the evil spirits congregate if if you have a gospel in church that gospel can only congruent that gossiper maybe maybe the Spirit of God asked that person is not manifested yet but they have it it's like a magnet so they been gravitate towards each other and spirits congregate I just like the way spring sweets conjugates we draw strength from each other where Brom said when we all gather in one place as believers he said he's all of us bringing our lake of fire I bring my liquor fire you bring your liquefy he brings a lick of fire everybody brings a lick of fire and it becomes a pillar of fire Alleluia amen for every step for every everywhere to go who put his keen on we're all a step away from my body change because the picture is a perfect man in search of the perfect man that's right there when you have faith great step closer to your body change you have verses you step closer to your body change you have knowledge you a step closer temperature get step closer day in day how the mouth become the Word of God the more public up of our closeness to our body change the Bible said and Enoch walked with God he knows so much that it was not he had about a change because there's no way a man is gonna walk with God and there won't be a body change is always gonna happen now and he a process of your body change you're gonna learn to love trouble there's no new adversary's because the adversary's don't want you anywhere near that body change just like people today they want the table they want a lot to pray a table for them than their enemies but they don't want no enemies Lord bless my business Laure do this for me lord I want that I want this full of the spirit I want a gift I want your word to be born in my life dad I died today now the accident forgot to bring for this big table of buffet in front of them but no one no enemy to get jealous of your table you you can't have the table daddy enemies you have to have the table and the enemies and the things that God is trying to motors and shape us and help us understand the opponents of enemies in our in our to walk towards become becoming a priest touch of the perfect man because you need those adversary's down the road to keep in your toes because if I make a food right now like the super Isaiah with us Saturday night was a chicken arm still if that chicken suit was made and I was left on the stove without a stove being torn out without no fire its of no good it don't get bad because the super could get comfortable no matter how cold the weather outside is he's gonna eventually get back but a little bit of fire wasn't know why it's gonna keep that soup not comfortable not part because the final decision that soup isn't that's to you it's not in the pot the furnace the destination is Umbria as is still McCann our stomach right that's the final destination so is so it's not it's not meant for this still to get comfortable in a pot so we all want to get comfortable now we get comfortable in the things of life and everything God is answering your prayers at work you're making more money you have a nice house you drive a nice cars you know you're able to save a lot of money everything's going smooth we get so comfortable that we you they want to go to church anymore we don't want to read the scriptures anymore because it cares of lies life I've taken over and I will miss now calling our purpose as believers to put it skin on God's Word because God did not give this world to just give it because it was bored I wanted to run him to this mouth God gave his word because you want us to become one with the word I was seen in each dispensation each eight God sending his ministers his servants his prophets to bring the work so that we can be quickened and become close and we'll be becoming one with the word hallelujah so putting skin on the water go we have to be transformed I would say be a transformed by the renewing of your mind it's not it didn't say renew your mind say the renewing is a continuous action I'll go it keeps going after constantly renewing your mind constantly renew your mind you know we see so many types of believers in church today the ones one of the images are over their houses and the cross of God the one across you know in the living room and this and that all over the place like I said this all this is like images the devil is not scared of that piece of wood you don't scared of that that's an image it's not scared of that it doesn't care about the moment the moment get a revelation of that I don't start walking around with this cross I don't get a big cross on my neck to walk around because I'm already an embodiment of that cross because this is just a piece of wood but that piece of wood reminds me of something that took place 2,000 years ago so I have my identity I Know Who I am I know what I'm capable of and when the enemy comes around like a flood the Spirit of God in me we raise our standard against them hallelujah many times in conclusion we try to shape the Word of God to suit our lives hallelujah we try okay this product what is not applied to us in this last day one problem said it it was in 1959 you know before the seals and you know I'm pretty sure but Braun was alive in this generation but I Braun would not preach against this for a brahmana pitch against that all we're trying to do is trim the word down to feed us have you ever seen a design a tailor goodbye an extra light suit I say but the Paul I bought you a suit come over here put his suit on and start cutting off the suit on brother Paul he doesn't work that way cuz that's nobody Paul sighs the risk must love that designer or that stylist is to go to the store he knows brother Paul sighs in a liberal power needs you know the style but because but a Paul is unestablished it doesn't have a choice did you scratch our stylist he knows what we need it knows what is what suits each and we knew every one of us so it's gonna bring us what we need according as we need them it's not like fathers or some fathers today that would go give their body the 16 year old Bentley's to start driving around for stunt car driver that that would have that child now mr. Chaddha the same thing God does with us you bring the servants these ministers around it gives us the world to help us trim out extra fats extra extra guts that we have so we can fit into that that out dress of the world that suit of the world so that when we put it on it looks perfect on us and I say whoo that looks good brother that's customary yeah I could see that why because if it suits you and that's the exact same way the Word of God is what what a God is for the Bride of Christ of Jesus Christ and then what we do that's why we see people who struggle with your makeup sanding eels and whatnot in church today it's become fact that they are not applying the road why do rightly they are not so dead trimming of the part of the world that they don't want to listen to and succumb to charge in their ills this is come check their makeups and then we will start pushing about it we're gonna keep preaching about it also their take up that comment of filthiness now put on a garment of the word that's designed for them hallelujah contrition Bible says perfect love casts out fear doubt verse of the scriptures needs us to put a skin on it perfect love cast out fear when you have fear scared of something perfect loss love is missing because once perfect love is there it can't it can't be in the simplest with fear fear is a liar God's not gonna speed a fib of love of power of sound mind somebody with a sound mind knows who they are and then this is why the devil talks to decided that they were of taxes if I call with a Paul and it's standing right in front of me and I give me very nice hot slap Wow what is your name you will tell me his name right away because instead of confusion he's gonna figure stuff out it can answer that question that point and that's I'd never taxes it establishes us now what we introduced that we stabilized we lose our identity we don't know we are anymore it gets so distracted by what is going around us you get us attracted by the fire the earthquakes the diseases and the pestilence I will meet the still small voice that voice that says I will not leave you or forsake you but I will come to you I'll be with you even unto the hand of the world amen also we see fear of people losing their kids in church today oh my goodness my child is not serving God he's gonna go to the 2l garden promise me that that's not a word of God God said I and the children love as given as they ate said we are made for signs and wonders so if my child is not serving God if my son is going parish I was my child gonna fit for food a scripture God a scripture was really for me and my family it was written for my kids so no matter how fat my kids are gone your kids are gone away from home I'm an alpha the gun away from the church the scriptures still applies to them just like the story of a make megan mark rule and the prince for sehri and I see post of journalists and you know the real family about those people but they're gonna Street them up the title the kinds the title anymore no siree once you a priest you're Prince you are born that way no matter how far you're going to still praise nobody can take that away from you you were born into it by the blood same way we are born into the family of Christ by the blood of Jesus Christ Ramsey just made those kings and princes onto God the Messiah so I'm not going to look at where my son is or your son is or what they're doing I want it going through I'm gonna cut the blood of Jesus Christ that was given for them that was shed for them I can see my child I can see you're a child leaving right I can see your child you know smoking and doing dreads and deal what not carrying away and sleeping all the woman in the world and what none dude cracking this world but beyond that when I pick up the scriptures and look to the eyes of Jehovah I can see my child you're a child washed by the blood of Jesus Christ and I can see them in that condition anymore I will see my child your child any condition of a raptured soul knowing that with the full expectation by the grace of God then the resurrection money my child your child will be there alleluia alleluia so when we become along with the word what is for preeminence over us our lives our man is renewed continuously he's gonna affect our testimony verses out of the abundance of the heart man speaks then my confession is no longer mine but God's my mouth is no longer my mouth but God's mouth my hand is no longer than my hands man but the hands of Jesus Christ and I could put my hands on my brother and blessing my brother and happens just like that my feet is doing at my feet but the feet of Jesus Christ I know that everywhere I go I have dominion over everything I'll go to work in the morning and I decree and declare I'm on my day to be that's good just like I wanted it and I will take demeanor or what people don't like me my job and I walk into work so happy why is this guy who's happy why I'm seated in Evelyn place in Christ Jesus I have dominion so he that is the meal greater than he has in the world he's good on everything that's going on you know being the crab business Tommy Oh a lot because we get paid by Commission that's a big try of the faith when I took people that I was gonna go in the car business that brother how do you guys get paid it brother in my church just after I got married I was in that restaurant my wife too except I got married it was that brother he walked with his sons I can I joined guy said yeah why not said I started talking with fellowship and I was enjoying it because my wife just moved to my church I was trying to have a guy used to people and understand our people and on all I said I'll show you new car business huh I say yeah it's not even once I had to talk about it so ain't nobody that can sustain it family car business I ain't seen nobody shocked you just talked on our husband and I saw these children like that and they're eatin Altamont app thought they'd be it's okay why they got it all figured out this what is a million I asked money and that's franchisees and employ like 17 people in my church he said that how'd it get offended well you don't wanna promise them that I will supply all your needs and I've been the car business ever since I've been growing I have clients all over the country and I've never lacked one day and I'm lying dead and I'm not stealing and I'm not robbing people why does it promise for me it's not about what you do for a living you could be a make donors only $7.25 an hour but you do we join your heart are you happy I think what's going on is the person making some extra money side also that I don't know about and I go come to you say brother can you tell me the secret bro you have a car you okay God multiplies but they don't know you want to know let's go to church I have a slim talk about God let me tell you about the guys my sugar daddy he's my sugar daddy he's give me all these extra benefits Bible says blessed be God that daily loaded off with divine blessings meaning every day I gotta get extra goodies he knows what I need every day so I'm gonna keep getting from him I'm gonna keep getting from him I don't have to ask anymore I gotta believe because he knows what I need when I need an hour I need it and his brother made that statement and we got any car my wife was so upset the trouble has period I said it's okay baby it's alright we're in the first year of that period god bless us with three different cars I didn't have to steal I'd have to do anything illegal the same doesn't look down on this bra has no idea because it's not a matter what you do for a living it's all about God's blessing I'm on it Alleluia and God has been faithful we are not rich but we are confident in his provision that is modern able Alleluia so God wants us to have confidence in his word I have faith in his word even God had to believe his own word he says Evelyn earth will pass away but my word that's some confidence that's some confidence on the part of God that listen whatever I say is going to happen the Ricky Bobby's will try to talk like that but we cancel strikes them they can't say that anymore they can add that confidence anymore but my god it says it it's gonna be that way it doesn't matter how long he goes it's your trouble for got me going for so many years the trials may go on for so many ways for many years but guess what the Word of God will now fall to the ground without a admin it's gonna come to pass so in this last days this is a bride that's gonna put a spin on the Word of God as continually putting skin on the Word of God day in day out president was the mark of the I call in Christ Jesus so this bride will not fare well where he failed she would not stumble what ifs ambled because she's already part of the world and trust me this this bride don't look too pretty but she on snow had diamond on her beauty is the word Bible says she asked the bride has made herself ready she is clothed with the Word of God why because she asked confidence in now word I'm done in closing I'll tell you stories we all know this is young prince right you wanted a wife so bad what's up the age so answer is that's a - I want a wife and we have we have we have my family's a real decent and you know we go to the palace to see the king you know all that would a new perspective a foolish things are doing but we know I absolutely I have an idea about it ritual and procedure things are gone you can just get married and just bring it going someone get married to this girl you have to go to your family it obstacle to find the mean and say I want to get married I tell you bring like ten girls the list of ten girls that you think I put the potential of being your wife and they gonna start doing research about your family background do this do these people's family have mental issues in your family you have an issue of drugs do have an extra of these our wealthy a day we have money to do all this research and I believe some that was now what is this this prince the founder met with hot that's okay son we'll get you bride don't worry I'm gonna tell all the virgins in the Cedars get ready my son is coming go to town crier how many people have seen the town crier before I probably probably so back in the day the prince the king as somebody his messanger be called person town crier so it goes around that's any time of the day probably very early in the morning around 5:00 a.m. between 435 if weif about getting ready to go to a different place of work or in the evening around 6:00 7:00 because capiche you to get back from working out five back man and if the tanker I walk around you're gonna lose the town cry because of the way dresses because it looks royal and it's gonna walk on out from a street to street and say may the force be with you witness from the King language booties from the king by 5:00 p.m. tomorrow the king is gonna have a guy doing that added another so that's how he was so this Prince Father sent out his own messenger expound crier to go tell the people and announce the old city that it's only the bride and there's a sudden day a sudden time sudden month all the verges in the city should get ready and be adorned putting your best clothes I don't care squish mother's three or four months and we put on our Christmas clothes get ready they all got ready and the Priya has got on his earth when did they came with the chariots and you know the ammo barriers and whatnot it only helps you were over him precedes it some went fine I was looking around and everybody was uh thought it goes with dancing and showing up and you know it was a nice all the wood beauty present but there was one girl who wasn't ourselves I'm both his wife doesn't wanted to go nowhere we were made if I see you dress up I'm gonna rip that dress off of you don't go nowhere but unknowing far she was a candidate to Oh Christopher she was predestinated to be the princes wife so she taught you the Masters wife to Elena are bad go outside a strip you do yard and do the dishes and all that and you know she was outside doing nothing but the priest knows what you wanted he knows what courage Tara teases bride must possess and the beauty of Hollywood and the fashion and his child and makeup on what now was not was not appealing to him I was just sister they tried to the same thing today you want to get marry so bad and I've done this up with makeups and whatnot and they just just look like like painted monkeys I mean the nails fixed their clothes like Keenan's me and it just worship in church in and you do respond to the word emotions and not content and they do hardens things because they want to get married so bad and then we won't went after truck to say complex to other single brothers on the visiting brothers in church desperation but that I've asked and I've never seen that help anybody because when you get home with that brother oh yeah why didn't I and the makeup is off I know that is Robert is gonna say he was deceived and all the extensions come off glory and it sees the patch on one side and you know the edges does missing he's out he's out glory to God so these people got some ready but it was like know what I'm not happy just like when the Prince of glory came down I was running to the street of Jerusalem and he wept it says when the Son of Man comes back shall you find faith and it was discouraged by what is so by the condition of the people Africa has adopted the traditional Pharisees and Sadducees it was lucky will I find faith it was troubling to him because one of the bride it was a longing for one so bad and that's why I left glory and his mission cannot be defeated it has to be completed he can't go back to finance a mission failed he has to go back to finance a mission accomplished so this prince was walking around he walked past audit all the J's bells in the street and it was lying impressed so it probably told his armor bearers you guys go back I'll be fine I just want to go I just won't be alone that's what respect is comment so you went he kept writing he kept writing but then somebody caught his attention down the street who sing it that's a beautiful voice that resonates who what is in his heart just like the statement of Rebecca related with what was in the heart of Eleazar because she was elected she was christened resonated see you can't give what you don't have you gotta have it to give it she kept singing but rather was singing give me the whole time religion was that Wow sounds good so he kept going kept going then wake up girls didn't want the voice sounded so sweet in his ears and it got closer she didn't know who she was she didn't know what was written about her she taught practice she was gonna be a maid for the rest of my life be a slave she didn't know that and she was just doing a theme she was too bashful I like young women today in church they're gonna be in your face like that what you gonna do exactly just like that don't know bashful but I see growing up I see to your younger sister on the church very bashful respectful how go my dad would mind with older brothers in church to visit people on Saturdays or go for evangelism or witness of shed Bible or pray for people in your house I like to go around and I will see the sisters come a couple of you guys welcome everybody go back inside not because they can't fellowship but it just has a much bashfulness unlike a sister these days and she was she kept doing what she was doing doing the dishes and the guys spoke to her what is your name she she stole a glass she told him is our name why you know how they didn't you know the Prince wants to get married and I ain't no a virgin I'm a virgin I kept myself all these years but my master's wife doesn't want me to go out there oh wow he saw the innocence in that voice she has not be corrupted by the doctrines and creeds and the traditions of people in that night day because the Prince asked to get married to a pure virgin bride here's the whole bow don't you have family not don't it's just me okay I want a bright and I want you to be my bride she probably dropped of dishes that she was doing what sir dang any right yeah me I know I just want you to say yes and that is what Jesus is expected for the people to say to the just yes say yes Lord that's all he wants he doesn't want your excuses it doesn't want your explanations you just want to say yes Lord like I better say you gotta make a decision if I'm gonna go with him or not she said he yes she probably my softly mother doubt that word out of the mouth yes okay all righty on a certain day I'm gonna come back for you I'll go ahead and prepare a place for you in my father's mansion don't worry about it I know what you're gonna like I'm gonna make it you know what I gonna love it in my father's house there are many mansions I would get all ready for you you just get yourself prepared cuz when I come I'm just gonna come for you and I'm gonna leave it's the or the second was about to leave said do not tell anybody what I disclosed to you cause it's a mystery the mystery is not for everybody to know it's not for the world the old world is for the Bride of Christ the mystery for sudden elected people do not tell anybody just get ready the event was over all the other 50 so-called virgins we return home oh I understand what that rappin is all about it's so prideful he didn't see me it is my extensions so they probably got into debt trying to look for this guy trying to please him doing him the princess service Robin is will but somebody was rich somebody that is coming back so she got herself ready she was preparing a song changed from give me the whole time Lee Jung soo it's coming back he promised he is coming back for me started singing that said singing that song oh she started singing huh I am redeemed Bobby the prize Jesus that's changing my whole life I song changed see the moment get a revelation of who you are and I watch your court for your testimony is gonna change the confession is gonna change she lost identity at our point prior to meeting the prints but and I can't talk with Jesus is always gonna change your life you can never remain the same brother I'm not gonna make mistakes yeah because you're in the flesh I'm not gonna stumble yes you are and the devil's gonna do all I can to show you your faults and your mistakes but you've been bought with a price it blood has been shed for you and anything has confessed God don't see no more so she was getting ready what's up with this girl yeah I busted his wife for a other okay maybe she needs more load let me give Emma Borden let me get my much friars let me give him my tribulations lemon throw my stuffies way and give him a little bit of lost let me bring up with this girl out at his job that's gonna trouble a little bit while she's equipped she can be why because it countdown the countdown to the day the prince is gonna come so she already know that okay the German hasn't passed already and I'm gonna go

looking yeah he's gonna come soon she woke up probably OCO up early and got all the dishes done you know tidied the hours and what now and a master's wife woke up there was nothing to be done oh that's strange she didn't know because she had no revelation but his Virgin had a revelation when it was time she ran inside the house she already put on a dress she flung the doors of the Alpha open nobody can touch her anymore she can hear the chariots of the wagon of the horses coming this Prince is on his way so she didn't care anymore that Borden escaped because it was time to go home she knew that my boss is my boss's wife can't touch me no more because my husband is the prince so she was wet where you going she showed everybody how was for with her she nobody could understand drops off the dirty virgins the so-called virgins were all out in the street what's going on looky here the noise do you hide the trumpets coming forth what is going on the priests coming for what well she
