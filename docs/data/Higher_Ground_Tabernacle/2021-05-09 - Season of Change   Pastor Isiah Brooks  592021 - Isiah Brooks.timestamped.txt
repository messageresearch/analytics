[26:35] [Music]
[26:41] would like to give a testimony
[26:47] good morning everybody so i just want to
[26:51] come up here and uh tell you guys about
[26:54] my story about what i went through
[26:56] and if you can bear with me i'm not good
[26:58] at speaking from people
[27:00] um so about i say six months ago i'll be
[27:04] dealing with my
[27:05] health i was very sick i had to
[27:09] go to the hospital to get some treatment
[27:12] they found out that i had a tumor on my
[27:15] arm and i need to
[27:19] get it more removed so we started i
[27:22] started taking some
[27:23] treatment at the hospital and hoped
[27:25] hoping that
[27:27] everything would go fine but
[27:31] i took some treatments for i think
[27:34] three months but what happened is that
[27:38] the treatment did not respond to the
[27:40] treatment
[27:41] but i want to thank the lawful brother
[27:45] keith but isaac and sister
[27:48] for my for being there with me through
[27:51] the whole process
[27:52] um i really use brothers keep
[27:56] faith to encourage me to go through this
[27:58] whole thing
[28:00] so the uh the day before the
[28:04] surgery i sat down with uh with the
[28:06] surgeon
[28:07] we talked about how the whole process
[28:10] will look
[28:11] and he can explain to me how it would be
[28:14] difficult to
[28:15] do the procedure without
[28:18] damaging any nerves on my arm
[28:22] but we prayed my whole family prayed
[28:25] with me
[28:25] and we i trust the lord that he will do
[28:29] me a miracle
[28:31] the doctor was saying it's almost
[28:33] impossible to
[28:34] do the procedure without damaging any
[28:37] nerves on my arm
[28:38] and and but we told him that
[28:43] he this would be his first miracle he
[28:46] ever saw
[28:48] so the day came before the surgery i
[28:50] said there was a table
[28:52] getting ready to go to the operation
[28:54] room he came there ready
[28:57] he told me that actually
[29:00] he can do the procedure without touching
[29:04] any nerves
[29:05] he apparently found out that he can do
[29:08] the whole procedure
[29:09] without having to do much damage on my
[29:12] arm
[29:12] so that was the first proof i had
[29:15] um when i was sitting there at the table
[29:18] i just had that kind of feeling of
[29:20] peaceful in my heart because i knew that
[29:22] i wouldn't do i couldn't do
[29:24] anything to change the situation i
[29:27] played i prayed the night before my
[29:28] whole family
[29:29] my sister and brother prayed for me and
[29:32] so i was sitting there
[29:33] just you know having my whole faith in
[29:36] god
[29:36] because i couldn't do anything on that
[29:38] case so i was just
[29:40] you know very happy to see the first
[29:43] proof before i went to the uh
[29:45] if i want to sleep so yeah
[29:48] so we went to the uh i went inside the
[29:52] room he did uh he performed the surgery
[29:55] i think it took about about four for uh
[29:59] four hours to the whole procedure and
[30:01] when he finished here
[30:03] he came to my dad and told him that was
[30:06] a
[30:06] very successful surgery he ever had and
[30:10] apparently everything worked out fine he
[30:13] wasn't what he thought was so so the mri
[30:17] and the ct shows was showing that
[30:21] he couldn't do the surgery but when he
[30:22] went there he couldn't find any of the
[30:26] inconvenient that was there um so i was
[30:29] very blessed to uh to um to
[30:34] um i i say i was very blessed to uh
[30:44] just i'm counting this miracle to just
[30:46] have this miracle in my life to just
[30:48] have this proof
[30:49] i can tell people that god do miracle
[30:53] i don't believe in god of stories and
[30:57] history
[30:57] i know there's a guy that can do
[30:59] miracles in
[31:01] any circumstance this whole story
[31:04] has taught me some very strong
[31:07] lesson changed my character increased my
[31:10] faith in god
[31:12] and i'm just very glad that
[31:15] i actually benefit from this whole
[31:19] situation
[31:20] so i want to praise the lord for my
[31:21] healing and foreign

[44:25] the 17th and 18th verse of james
[44:28] jackson
[44:33] every good and perfect every good gift
[44:36] and every perfect gift is from above
[44:40] and cometh down from the father of light
[44:44] with whom is no variableness neither
[44:47] shadow
[44:48] of turning
[44:57] our final scripture reading coming from
[44:59] genesis the third chapter
[45:10] and then we'll let you be seated
[45:15] now the serpent was more subtle than
[45:18] any beast of the field which the lord
[45:21] god had made
[45:23] and he said unto the woman yea have god
[45:27] said ye shall not eat of every tree
[45:30] of the garden
[45:42] and the woman said unto the serpent we
[45:45] may eat of the fruit
[45:46] of the trees of the garden
[45:54] but of the fruit of the tree which is in
[45:56] the midst of the garden
[45:57] god hath said ye should not eat of it
[46:01] neither shall ye touch it lest she die
[46:12] for god does know that in the day ye eat
[46:15] thereof
[46:16] then your eyes shall be opened and ye
[46:18] shall be as gods
[46:20] knowing good and evil
[46:26] connoisseurs and when the woman saw that
[46:30] the tree was good for food
[46:32] and that it was pleasant to the eyes and
[46:34] a tree to be desired to be made one wise
[46:38] to make she's desire to make one wise
[46:41] she took
[46:42] of the fruit thereof and did eat and
[46:45] gave
[46:45] also unto her husband with her
[46:48] and he did eat thank you sir
[46:54] agreeable
[47:03] and the eyes of them both were open
[47:06] and they knew that they were naked and
[47:09] they
[47:10] sowed fig leaves together and made them
[47:13] say
[47:13] sales aprons
[47:23] let us pray dear heavenly father
[47:28] head and lord of my life
[47:34] we come clothed in humility lord
[47:39] to say lord god there is nothing we can
[47:41] do this morning
[47:45] but through and by your leadership
[47:49] something can be done
[47:52] and we prayed this morning
[47:56] that you would lead us and guide us
[48:00] say those things that your bride need
[48:02] today
[48:14] and this is what we're asking you for
[48:16] lord it's a scrutiny

[48:22] trusting you you know feed our souls
[48:26] to enlighten us

[48:49] on yesterday i was thinking
[48:54] how happy and how glad i
[48:57] am to be a christian
[49:14] and things that are taking place in the
[49:16] world
[49:20] i'm kind of like peter compiere silver
[49:24] and gold have i not
[49:25] done but i do have something
[49:30] hallelujah and such as i have a
[49:34] give id
[49:39] what we what would we have what we have
[49:41] would we have done
[49:44] faith had not god sent us a prophet
[49:51] a word of insight
[49:55] a word of prophecy
[49:59] of the prophecy a word that will
[50:02] give us vision
[50:05] on where we are
[50:10] in this day you know brother branham
[50:14] said
[50:15] that the true bride of jesus christ
[50:20] she knows her day
[50:23] she is aware of her time
[50:27] god has quickened her life
[50:31] when everybody else seemed to be in an
[50:34] illusion
[50:38] she is walking in reality
[50:42] she knows where she's come from
[50:46] and she knows where she's going
[50:51] she have confidence in her husband
[50:55] she has confidence in
[51:00] her redeemer
[51:03] and she knows that her redeemer is her
[51:06] husband
[51:09] we're living in a time of headship
[51:14] not a man handled gospel
[51:18] but a gospel that is controlled by
[51:22] god himself
[51:25] hallelujah we have become
[51:28] we have gone beyond udila
[51:32] touch not taste now
[51:59] and where the spirit of the lord is
[52:16] hallelujah season of
[52:18] change this season it's a subject this
[52:22] morning
[52:23] things must change
[52:27] hallelujah uh i was listening to
[52:32] the message god's only
[52:35] uh provided place of worship
[52:40] in 1965
[52:43] and that that tape is so powerful
[52:47] it takes you from a to z hallelujah
[52:51] it lets you know that the way people
[52:54] worship
[52:55] yesterday
[52:58] before today
[53:10] [Applause]
[53:27] their judgment
[53:30] is blind somebody help me here
[53:34] and if you're blind you cannot see
[53:38] should i significa
[53:40] those of us who
[53:54] that we did not come here by chance
[53:58] let me say it again you did not come
[54:01] here about
[54:02] by chance you know
[54:05] one of the things that uh
[54:09] i've experienced in life
[54:12] uh and and that is i i used to go to the
[54:15] movies
[54:18] and uh you know i hated to be late
[54:26] because if you came late especially if
[54:30] it was your first time
[54:32] uh to see this movie
[54:41] and a lot of times people think it's the
[54:43] ending that's the
[54:44] most important thing
[54:48] it's the beginning because if you
[55:18] from the beginning
[55:30] now this is a time of change
[55:45] it's something that that is obvious
[55:50] that is not the same as it was before
[55:55] some changes are good yeah
[55:58] some changes are evil yeah
[56:42] most people don't like change the people
[56:44] have these running positions more
[56:46] especially when it's not beneficial
[56:52] most people love their comfort zones
[56:58] but god has never given you a comfort
[57:00] zone as such
[57:03] there is only only one comfort zone yeah
[57:07] that comfort zone is in christ
[57:11] we know that god cannot change the
[57:13] journey
[57:14] about that you ever had friends that
[57:18] know they
[57:19] change on you it's a hurting thing
[57:24] to see that your friend has changed
[57:28] i've got a friend that will never change
[57:30] me
[57:32] the bible says that he's the same
[57:34] yesterday today
[57:38] so you
[58:19] because god can't make
[58:36] hallelujah so if god chose you
[58:39] is he jewish to be bride
[58:42] there is nothing
[58:46] that can change his
[59:00] it's not about what you think about god
[59:17] listened to brother ben last night ben
[59:20] yeah in iowa city i was tv he made a
[59:23] good point
[59:26] he said there's people who could be
[59:28] blessed
[59:30] there are blessings
[59:44] but he wasn't
[59:49] amen because a lot of times people think
[59:52] material things the jeans materials he
[59:55] knows that you are blessed
[59:57] did not close that material things are
[1:00:00] blessings
[1:00:02] materials
[1:00:07] but in order to be blessed
[1:00:10] you have to come from god
[1:00:27] [Music]
[1:00:47] [Music]
[1:00:53] hallelujah now had it been us
[1:00:57] had had the changes being determined
[1:01:00] been determined by us
[1:01:07] y'all understand me god gave just for an
[1:01:10] example and then i'll move on like
[1:01:11] zombie god
[1:01:12] gave peter the keys
[1:01:16] it was afterwards peter denied
[1:01:19] jesus three times
[1:01:33] but the thing that i love about god
[1:01:35] excuse me
[1:01:38] uh even with your actions
[1:01:42] the master prophet was like hallelujah
[1:01:45] the bible even tells us that
[1:01:47] god does not judge us according to our
[1:01:50] sins
[1:01:54] [Music]
[1:02:04] is
[1:02:17] so let me go to my subject now
[1:02:20] there in the book of genesis don't
[1:02:23] redeem
[1:02:24] us it's where it starts
[1:02:28] and god determined within himself
[1:02:34] he was going to make a man in his own
[1:02:36] image he'd formulate a norm as
[1:02:38] a sony manager and likeness i like to
[1:02:41] say yes
[1:02:43] and he made adam adam
[1:02:49] and we understand the story
[1:02:52] all of the other animals have been
[1:02:55] created
[1:02:57] man was the crown of his creations
[1:03:14] but adam was the only one that was
[1:03:17] lonely
[1:03:20] and the reason being
[1:03:23] there was no help me for adam
[1:03:26] i don't know but mr
[1:03:30] bear had mrs bear mr uh
[1:03:33] lulu madame lulu and and perhaps some
[1:03:36] cubs
[1:03:40] some little cubs little bears
[1:03:45] hallelujah but here was adam
[1:03:49] he he was given an order
[1:03:54] and he god told and this is the purpose
[1:03:56] now i'm bringing you to the purpose
[1:03:59] of the objective the purpose of adam and
[1:04:01] eve the objective that don't ever
[1:04:03] was to bring forth of his kind
[1:04:06] it did reproduce
[1:04:25] oh it is up to you for the serpent
[1:04:29] immediately but you ever did did it ever
[1:04:32] come to your mind
[1:04:34] there may have been a reason for that
[1:04:37] hallelujah hey she have seen things
[1:04:42] because you know they walked in the cool
[1:04:43] of the evening
[1:04:49] god had made them king and queen over
[1:04:52] a
[1:05:07] he with the serpent introducing
[1:05:10] his way
[1:05:14] up until then god was in complete
[1:05:17] control
[1:05:19] god always is in control on plane
[1:05:22] controller
[1:05:23] but he gave mankind
[1:05:29] volunteering he gave mankind a will
[1:05:33] especially but the animals had no will
[1:05:36] melisani
[1:05:38] hallelujah so he made mankind in a way
[1:05:43] especially make his own chooses our
[1:05:46] own choices
[1:05:51] this is why he could not make
[1:05:54] adam and eve in the way he made the
[1:05:57] other animals
[1:05:59] the memphis people needed
[1:06:14] if you don't believe that listen to
[1:06:15] serpents each
[1:06:34] hallelujah even though god put it out
[1:06:36] there in memphis
[1:06:44] somebody helped me here but one of the
[1:06:46] things she did
[1:06:47] man that satan was so smart
[1:06:51] tricked her like pretty he deceived her
[1:06:57] he made a true statement though
[1:07:00] you do this that's the situation you
[1:07:02] will become
[1:07:03] as gods
[1:07:07] what was it that she did and whatever
[1:07:12] what was it that he did that
[1:07:15] made him like god would become jew
[1:07:18] he chose to do his
[1:07:21] will y'all hear me
[1:07:25] he chose to do his will
[1:07:30] again it was the will
[1:07:34] of adam and eve that don't ever to
[1:07:37] produce
[1:07:37] children the the drill doesn't fall
[1:07:40] without the instructions of god
[1:07:45] they were predestinated is it difficult
[1:07:51] he said god would tell them to have
[1:07:54] children
[1:07:56] [Music]
[1:08:07] of all the animals do this anymore can
[1:08:09] mate
[1:08:10] at any time amen can mate
[1:08:13] at any time
[1:08:14] [Music]
[1:08:20] i'm gonna admit it myself
[1:08:45] [Music]
[1:08:49] because of the sexual sin across the
[1:08:52] species six well
[1:08:53] he began to multiply
[1:08:57] now god told them to multiply they were
[1:09:00] multiplying according to their own
[1:09:03] will meant to know
[1:09:19] will hit me
[1:09:22] because in his will he wanted to
[1:09:25] super exceed the pacific god's will
[1:09:30] i'm bringing it to you whatever
[1:09:47] things according to your own will give
[1:09:49] this a 5
[1:09:50] 000. trust in the lord
[1:09:54] confirm lean not on on your own
[1:09:57] understanding
[1:10:00] in
[1:10:18] [Music]
[1:10:28] the thing that i love about it from that
[1:10:31] garden of gethsemane
[1:10:33] don't lose which was a type of the
[1:10:35] garden of eden
[1:10:38] hallelujah that is where he says
[1:10:41] he showed where the problem was
[1:10:46] it's not my will be done
[1:10:50] you see what i'm saying the first sin
[1:10:53] came in the garden
[1:10:56] and the restoration
[1:10:57] [Music]
[1:11:19] [Music]
[1:11:25] calvary and this is not in my notes
[1:11:28] but calvary is a very important thing
[1:11:30] because
[1:11:32] it was important and i was letting him
[1:11:34] know that
[1:11:35] i think it's longitude i always get them
[1:11:37] mixed up longitude and latitude
[1:11:42] is the one that goes this way
[1:11:46] but anyhow
[1:11:49] there's a sister yeah her name was
[1:11:51] georgia johnson
[1:11:53] johnson and she had taken a picture
[1:11:56] oh it's sunset mountains
[1:12:00] came down
[1:12:06] to my denounce
[1:12:10] that three crosses were cobbed out of
[1:12:13] that mountain
[1:12:15] how many of y'all knew that what
[1:12:16] quantity for me
[1:12:19] three crosses were carved into the stone
[1:12:22] into
[1:12:22] and those pyramid rocks
[1:12:27] came out of the carvings
[1:12:31] this is for me and she showed me a
[1:12:34] picture of calvary
[1:12:37] and a picture she had taken there sunset
[1:12:39] mountain
[1:12:42] sunset and you i could not tell them
[1:12:44] apart
[1:12:48] as the east it come leicester to the
[1:12:51] west
[1:12:54] west yesterday the day and forever
[1:12:59] there on calvary it was the blood
[1:13:02] but there
[1:13:15] looking behind you look out there
[1:13:19] the the the the the uh the the
[1:13:24] picture of brother branham profile
[1:13:27] that's the word
[1:13:29] brother brown i'm in the stone
[1:13:44] this message
[1:14:11] and because of the blasting of the road
[1:14:13] yeah
[1:14:15] there were some cave ends
[1:14:19] so i had to squeeze myself down into
[1:14:22] this cage
[1:14:26] and i'm thinking
[1:14:40] is
[1:14:50] that was the table he talked about yeah
[1:15:16] [Laughter]
[1:15:20] because when you first come to the
[1:15:22] message
[1:15:32] but to me that was a bonus
[1:15:35] because so many people wanted to go into
[1:15:38] that cave
[1:15:41] hallelujah peregrine found out where it
[1:15:44] was
[1:15:48] [Music]

[1:16:58] whether you believe it or not i was on
[1:16:59] the floor
[1:17:13] nobody can deter me
[1:17:24] i believe everything that's been
[1:17:28] preached
[1:17:43] so that will that will get you in
[1:17:45] trouble
[1:17:48] is that true it's amazing because when
[1:17:51] you get married
[1:17:53] they say where are you
[1:18:09] oh yes i will
[1:18:24] together
[1:18:38] jesus help me lord now if god has such a
[1:18:41] ceremony let me hurry up
[1:18:44] so the purpose of adam and eve was to
[1:18:46] replenish the earth objective
[1:18:51] have you ever thought about it
[1:18:56] why was kane so upset
[1:19:00] it had to be more division
[1:19:04] but i'm going to tell you something what
[1:19:05] god did there measure
[1:19:08] when he accepted abel's
[1:19:12] sacrifice accepted the sacrifice
[1:19:16] he was identifying abel's sacrifice
[1:19:33] was revealed it was revealed to kane
[1:19:39] that he didn't have the right bloodline
[1:19:44] so he got angry and you said well
[1:19:47] brothers where you get that from don't
[1:19:49] you worry about it just
[1:19:50] think about it and ask the lord about it
[1:19:54] because even now kane gets very
[1:19:58] angry when he realizes he doesn't have
[1:20:02] the bloodline
[1:20:06] [Music]

[1:27:18] comes from the soul
[1:27:20] really in the word of god
[1:27:30] hallelujah amen isn't that okay
[1:27:37] so god created adam and eve in the in
[1:27:40] the image
[1:27:42] i've got to jump because i want to show
[1:27:46] you what
[1:27:47] high breeding two of the beasts did
[1:27:51] through the world in chaos
[1:27:57] you know a lot of times people think
[1:27:58] that those people were
[1:28:01] you know like caveman in a club of some
[1:28:05] sort
[1:28:05] because but these people were
[1:28:09] highly intelligent coming from the fall
[1:28:14] they were their brains were working far
[1:28:16] better than ours
[1:28:22] they were able uh mathematically
[1:28:40] whatever the hybriding did
[1:28:44] it created destruction
[1:28:48] by way of the intellectuals
[1:28:53] it was cain's offspring
[1:29:06] where are you coming from because the
[1:29:08] bible said
[1:29:22] is
[1:29:33] [Music]
[1:29:39] [Music]
[1:29:50] [Music]
[1:30:04] very fair is it like correct
[1:30:07] hallelujah yeah yeah
[1:30:10] and guess what if it was cane seeds
[1:30:15] who started the polygamy polygamy
[1:30:59] well some people say i'm too soft so i'm
[1:31:01] not being soft this morning
[1:31:08] he created adam and eve luckily i don't
[1:31:11] ever
[1:31:12] it wasn't two women only one
[1:31:16] god don't have two brides only ones
[1:31:20] hallelujah we gotta realize by god's
[1:31:23] grace he cannot
[1:31:28] change
[1:31:40] same thing moved into
[1:31:56] and even though the bill of divorcement
[1:31:59] remember
[1:32:01] the divorce moses gave it to them
[1:32:05] because of the hardness of their hearts
[1:32:09] that means their hearts were so hard so
[1:32:11] that's if you don't do it the right way
[1:32:13] anyhow
[1:32:16] hallelujah and so he gave them the bill
[1:32:18] of divorce
[1:32:51] so did the evil
[1:33:06] because they were genetically altering
[1:33:09] things
[1:33:11] maybe i'm wrong but as it was in that
[1:33:14] day that comes to this so
[1:33:15] is it in this day no new thing under the
[1:33:19] sun is
[1:33:40] and you got to understand that it's all
[1:33:41] because somebody
[1:33:44] exerted their will over god's will
[1:34:29] see what i'm saying
[1:34:41] that he thought he had done the will of
[1:34:44] god
[1:35:12] you got to get rid of all of them demons
[1:35:17] all the demons
[1:35:20] y'all don't think y'all you know that's
[1:35:22] the thing we're in the message
[1:35:26] god gonna let us do anything we want to
[1:35:29] driven
[1:35:32] you can't take a page out of this book
[1:35:36] every word of this book is right
[1:35:40] that
[1:35:53] if you die bad if
[1:36:21] [Music]
[1:36:36] i don't know if you're tired or you're
[1:36:37] just not getting it but specifically
[1:36:39] you're agreeing maybe you're not
[1:36:40] agreeing but the whole point is
[1:36:42] man your point i'm trying to get to your
[1:36:44] will
[1:36:46] and you can be you can wield or listen
[1:36:48] or will shut your your ears
[1:36:59] remember they didn't want to hear the
[1:37:00] prophet they shot their ears and ran to
[1:37:02] kill him
[1:37:09] so you got to understand so what
[1:37:11] happened here brother
[1:37:13] and we know these things adam and eve
[1:37:15] forfeited their rights i don't
[1:37:17] ever satan
[1:37:31] that's why his children prosper from
[1:37:34] prosperity
[1:37:35] and he did just like jesus said if you
[1:37:38] bow down to me that justice just
[1:37:40] give you everything now i want you to
[1:37:42] see what i'm saying
[1:37:43] because never in any other age
[1:38:00] they are acknowledging that satan is the
[1:38:04] god of this world
[1:38:09] and what is it is it because of the
[1:38:12] change
[1:38:12] acoustic we didn't know the change was
[1:38:15] coming
[1:38:17] to us that the world war one i believe
[1:38:21] in those demons

[1:51:59] any darkness
[1:52:00] in me
[1:52:14] she has no malice an envy or strife in
[1:52:16] her heart
[1:52:18] hallelujah but just a little bit of
[1:52:21] leveling

[1:52:24] from rising
[1:52:41] because i want you to realize that this
[1:52:42] is a this is a changing time
[1:52:50] follow the message have changed
[1:52:56] just changing things that would never
[1:53:00] think people would do
[1:53:01] that once walking this message is doing
[1:53:04] it
[1:53:09] you know yesterday was it yesterday
[1:53:12] i don't have youtube anymore but i
[1:53:14] wanted to hear some little gospel music
[1:53:18] and they had this girl called fantasia
[1:53:20] or something like that
[1:53:28] you know she's singing the song lord
[1:53:33] i know i've been changed
[1:53:36] the angels in heaven done
[1:53:40] sign my name i'm like
[1:53:46] yeah what they don't understand is that
[1:53:48] there's anger from heaven
[1:53:50] of god
[1:54:07] so whatever angel signed her name it
[1:54:09] wasn't the one that came from god
[1:54:13] i'm not saying she can't be changed
[1:54:23] you know i ain't going through the whole
[1:54:24] thing but she
[1:54:27] she had on a outfit 11 uh
[1:54:30] vic more that look made her look like a
[1:54:32] major rat you don't know what a major
[1:54:35] a major ad y'all don't know what i mean
[1:54:37] the ones that do with the batons that
[1:54:38] walk before the
[1:54:40] that's naked they naked and they
[1:54:44] ah okay you know you get the you get the
[1:54:48] uh

[1:54:53] but up here there's naked wow
[1:54:55] you see it's on you she was naked
[1:54:58] and i thought is this gospel
[1:55:02] it was packed y'all understand me
[1:55:05] see i'm saying all this to say when
[1:55:08] brother adam saw
[1:55:09] miss america naked
[1:55:12] he was right on target i come from the
[1:55:15] old school
[1:55:37] was here this morning i started to take
[1:55:39] him back
[1:55:42] but he said one thing yesterday
[1:56:12] and you know what if some people were
[1:56:13] following they were flocking on that
[1:56:15] and i thought to myself when when i saw
[1:56:17] that girl i said oh
[1:56:19] i just said god forgot i wasn't long
[1:56:20] just i wasn't long i wasn't
[1:56:22] standing i was disgusted
[1:56:26] i was
[1:56:41] now she's only me i'm trying to win them
[1:56:43] over to the law she said
[1:56:45] you know what apostolic is holiness
[1:56:50] that that i would say to the message
[1:56:51] that shows that people might be
[1:56:53] baptized in the name of the lord jesus
[1:56:55] christ
[1:56:57] we did believe in speaking in tongues
[1:56:59] that's the evidence
[1:57:05] it looks so much like the message
[1:57:19] amen and to see this
[1:57:23] girl
[1:57:27] like that
[1:57:31] and people were flocking to it
[1:57:35] was your song so they had these in this
[1:57:38] apostolic church they
[1:57:39] they were they were singing it's the
[1:57:41] first time i ever seen

[1:57:58] [Music]
[1:58:02] bring your mind back now but the point
[1:58:05] is
[1:58:07] the point is the point they were they

[1:58:14] turn around
[1:58:14] you know jesus walk jesus walk
