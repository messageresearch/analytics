[10:52] more than we've ever given to you Lord

[10:56] that we have this morning Lord I pray
[10:59] that that any spirits of Slumber Lord
[11:01] any Spirits Lord God that would hinder
[11:03] the people from entering into worship
[11:04] this morning would just be bound and
[11:06] brought back down to Hell In The Name of
[11:08] Jesus Christ may you just loose the
[11:10] tongues of the people to praise you this
[11:12] morning Father remove every hindrance
[11:14] Lord break down every prideful Spirit
[11:16] Lord Jesus break down everything that
[11:19] Lord is thinking of everything else
[11:20] except for you and Lord God focus our
[11:23] eyes and our hearts and our minds once
[11:25] again towards your throne this morning I
[11:27] pray father that you just minister to
[11:28] every need Lord that was in every heart
[11:31] of every uplifted hand that you would
[11:33] Minister to every single one Lord and if
[11:35] there is anyone Lord God that may have
[11:36] been even too prideful Lord God to raise
[11:38] up their hands this morning Lord God you
[11:40] know that Lord this flesh Lord Jesus
[11:43] they may not even be in that person's
[11:44] heart but this flesh Lord doesn't want

[12:17] the word of God this morning Lord Jesus

[36:13] 9:16 oh my

[36:20] 25 we dealt with the coming of the lord
[36:25] we dealt with um

[36:43] honestly that's just the way I feel
[36:46] right I mean it's just just the power of
[36:48] God Amen that's that I feel here this
[36:51] morning amen amen hallelujah if it you
[36:54] know I know I've got a message and
[36:55] that's the most important thing so I got
[36:56] to preach it first first then I'll shout
[36:58] Brother
[36:59] Rich amen you know God is so good I
[37:03] don't know whether you're feeling the
[37:04] presence of the Lord like I I am but I
[37:07] trust that you are Leviticus
[37:11] 2511 a jubilee shall that 50th year be
[37:16] unto you ye shall not
[37:19] sow neither reap that which groweth of
[37:22] itself in it nor gather the grapes in it
[37:27] of thy Vine
[37:30] undressed Romans
[37:34] 9:11 oh my
[37:41] God surely God is good to us how many of
[37:44] y'all believe that the Lord is soon to
[37:46] come you know we've heard these things
[37:49] for
[37:51] years we've heard it for years and I can
[37:56] remember during the time when I first
[37:57] first got saved I thought the Lord was
[37:59] to come then but never have it been so
[38:03] clear as it is now Romans
[38:08] 9:16 so then it is not of him that
[38:12] willth nor of him that runneth but of
[38:16] God that showeth
[38:19] Mercy

[39:47] name we pray amen you may be
[39:50] [Music]
[39:53] seated thank you sir
[40:01] I want to extend this a little bit from
[40:03] the 50th year
[40:04] Jubilee I kind of got a theme uh behind
[40:07] it three kinds of
[40:10] Believers but uh you know I I want to
[40:12] say by the grace of God that you and I
[40:14] are living in the greatest time
[40:17] ever wherein that there are a people
[40:20] that's going
[40:22] to cheat death yes sir Hallelujah the
[40:27] the Bible tells us that we will be
[40:29] changed Amen in a moment of a twinkling
[40:33] of an
[40:34] eye and you and I can't even imagine how
[40:37] fast that
[40:39] is but it is
[40:43] fast I was talking to brother Craig or
[40:46] Pastor Craig down in Lima I was just
[40:49] moved to call him and uh he and I and
[40:53] others I know are going through the same
[40:56] travail It's s something that's
[40:58] happening and and you know I'm glad
[41:00] about it because I'm being consumed by
[41:03] it and that is the coming of the Lord I
[41:07] I just don't want to do nothing outside
[41:09] of what he wants me to
[41:11] do and you know something else is
[41:14] happening and uh with us and I believe
[41:18] that God is going to increase it amen
[41:20] and when God does then the church will
[41:23] know but you know I I'm I'm looking at
[41:26] this thing because he he he he was
[41:28] telling me brother Craig how he had been
[41:30] studying on uh Billy Graham and that
[41:33] Billy Graham is uh will be preaching his
[41:36] last message in
[41:39] November
[41:41] worldwide and you know and I know that
[41:43] Billy Graham is the last Angel
[41:46] left and when those angels left Sodom
[41:50] the Bible tells me that they pulled lot
[41:53] and his family out it was a pull
[41:58] they had to grab lot cuzz he didn't even
[41:59] want to go and that's what's happening
[42:01] to a lot of Christians now that got a
[42:04] hold of the world but they don't want to
[42:06] let it
[42:07] go but listen by the grace of God Amen
[42:10] when when those when they cleared out of
[42:13] Sodom we find out that is when the fire
[42:16] fell we don't know how long it took for
[42:20] those angels to pull uh lot uh and his
[42:24] family out of Sodom but but remember as
[42:29] they were going up the mountain Miss lot
[42:32] turned that's right come on somebody she
[42:37] turned and when she turned amen she
[42:40] caught a glimpse of the atomic
[42:42] fire now I want you to know and I know
[42:45] you know amen that in that message three
[42:48] kinds of Believers the prophet tells us
[42:50] how those unbelievers those make
[42:53] Believers wait till the last
[42:55] minute and they reveal them
[42:57] themselves that Judah spirit that that
[43:00] spirit that that that
[43:02] identifies the
[43:04] word as being something that's
[43:07] false come on somebody and you and I
[43:11] have seen it amen with with with uh uh
[43:14] the many people that are falling away
[43:16] and and and and and and and and those
[43:19] movements like uh believe the sign and
[43:22] they have waited but it is what they're
[43:26] supposed to do yeah amen oh my God I'm
[43:29] getting excited it's what they're they
[43:31] can't do nothing else because they must
[43:34] play the role of
[43:37] betrayal
[43:39] hallelujah amen but at the same time
[43:43] while lot was being pulled out of Sodom
[43:47] amen we find Abraham
[43:49] Hallelujah being changed from glory to
[43:53] glory to glory amen to make a rapture
[43:58] that's why you feeling what you're
[44:00] feeling something is moving and you
[44:03] can't help
[44:05] yourself come on somebody amen because
[44:08] really this message is only for the
[44:11] elected it is For Those whom God has
[44:14] opened their eyes
[44:15] to uh uh this message you can't see it
[44:19] if you're not elected to see it
[44:22] Hallelujah and it's by God choosing you
[44:26] Amen to make cor Rapture amen that's why
[44:29] I read that scripture so then it is not
[44:32] of him that willth nor him that runneth
[44:36] but of God that showeth Mercy
[44:40] amen Lord hallelujah come on somebody
[44:44] amen just just coming I hope I can read
[44:47] this it was only for the elected God's
[44:50] chosen and that's the way it is today
[44:53] not him that
[44:55] runthe it is God that have mercy amen
[44:59] it's God that does it God by his grac
[45:03] amen Jesus said no man can come to me
[45:07] except God except my father draw him and
[45:10] all the father has given me will come to
[45:14] me it's God's grace that he choose the
[45:18] church before the foundation of the
[45:20] world Amen that church will hear the
[45:23] word of God Amen they'll turn every
[45:26] Creed down yes they'll turn every
[45:28] organization every denomination that's
[45:31] contrary down and they'll serve God by
[45:35] the power of the Holy Ghost amen
[45:38] hallelujah there certainly no the
[45:41] trumpet sound because he said my sheep
[45:44] Hearth my voice and a stranger they will

[45:49] follow hey what are you talking about
[45:52] the word God's Voice Hallelujah in the
[45:57] beginning was the word the word was with
[45:59] God and the Word was God Amen but it was
[46:02] the voice of God Amen that's why we
[46:05] can't help
[46:07] ourselves

[46:11] organization or denomination he said I
[46:14] have prepared myself a body and that
[46:18] body is you hallelujah amen God is

[57:17] in the face of Elohim himself amen if
[57:21] Sarah had not been a part of Abraham God
[57:24] would have Cut Her Off

[58:09] my spirit say the Lord and According to

[1:32:55] somebody listen not only did he change
[1:32:58] listen Hebrew said he gave her strength
[1:33:01] to receive seed that means god changed
[1:33:04] her in her reproduction system if he had
[1:33:09] only made her young she still would have
[1:33:11] been not able to have children but God
[1:33:15] changed the reproduction come on amen
[1:33:17] God changed your reproduction system
[1:33:19] amen he took that old Spirit out of you
[1:33:21] and put you a new spirit in there put
[1:33:24] that new spirit in there so you can get
[1:33:25] the Holy Ghost and a lot of people think
[1:33:28] got a new spirit and ain't got the Holy
[1:33:29] Ghost a new spirit mean that you can
[1:33:31] cope with yourself and the Holy Ghost
[1:33:33] now but you know what a Holy Ghost is is
[1:33:35] when you
[1:33:39] changed oh come on
[1:33:42] somebody now all I can say let me close
[1:33:45] on this there's many things I want to
[1:33:48] say but but let me say it like this for
[1:33:51] those of us we don't we may not
[1:33:54] understand but let me let me say it like
[1:33:56] this there's only two
[1:33:58] marks there's the mark of the beast and
[1:34:02] the mark of the Holy Ghost the Seal of
[1:34:05] God in your in your head is not a
[1:34:07] physical seal it's a spiritual seal
[1:34:10] which in turn after the spiritual seal
[1:34:13] the the natural mock will come but the
[1:34:16] spiritual seal is to know God is in you
[1:34:21] have a understanding he said said in
[1:34:24] that day you'll know that I'm in the
[1:34:25] Father the father's in me and I am in
[1:34:27] you that is the Seal of God in
[1:34:32] you the mark of the beast must be the
[1:34:35] same to know that the devil is in
[1:34:42] you and all who do not reside and
[1:34:47] cry
[1:34:49] all whether you were old or young listen
[1:34:51] what happened because of the church
[1:34:52] going bad had young kids were killed
[1:34:56] babies old people everything was slain
[1:35:00] because the church failed
[1:35:03] amen so like the prophet of God said
[1:35:06] like this he said the Bride of Jesus
[1:35:08] Christ is the blood of Jesus Christ by
[1:35:10] the spirit amen and once the Holy Ghost
[1:35:13] is gone because the Holy Ghost is the
[1:35:14] life of the blood of Jesus Christ and
[1:35:17] once that Holy Ghost is left once is is
[1:35:20] gone may God have mercy
[1:35:23] on this world I don't care who are you
[1:35:26] are young people old people whoever you
[1:35:28] may be don't you take no chances at this
[1:35:31] Holy Ghost we're talking about if you
[1:35:33] can't cope with the word you got another
[1:35:36] spirit amen because the Holy Ghost is
[1:35:39] going to say amen that's right Jesus not
[1:35:41] Jesus Christ know the words he's
[1:35:43] preaching he know the words he spoke
[1:35:46] come on somebody if you are confused
[1:35:47] he's not amen amen hallelujah come on
[1:35:51] somebody he knows what he's spoken and
[1:35:54] you know when it comes to the word of
[1:35:55] God if you don't it the hearing of the
[1:35:58] word of God is what determines who you
[1:36:04] are right Jesus said my sheep Hearth my
[1:36:09] voice so let me say it like this to show
[1:36:11] you how it's going to be such a great
[1:36:13] number in this age let me tell you when
[1:36:15] Jesus came on on the scene you know who
[1:36:17] was really saved really out of all of
[1:36:20] those people in Israel Anna Simeon
[1:36:25] the thief on the
[1:36:27] cross huh huh just a few Anna Simeon
[1:36:31] Mary
[1:36:33] Joseph a few people knew God and still
[1:36:38] knew him in a way that angels visited
[1:36:42] them and the church world was in
[1:36:45] darkness come on somebody then you got
[1:36:48] three Mii who knew more about Israel's
[1:36:51] law and the coming of the Lord than
[1:36:53] those who in

[1:44:38] call him be they call him a devil every
[1:44:41] prophet of God always get a bad name
[1:44:43] somebody say well I I I I saw on the
[1:44:46] internet and they said this that and
[1:44:47] other and I said somebody the other day
[1:44:49] I said don't you know in the Jews the
[1:44:51] Jews some of the Jews still believe they
[1:44:52] stole Jesus body
[1:44:55] away some of the Jews still believe that
[1:44:57] Jesus was born of
[1:44:59] fornication cuz somebody
[1:45:03] said if you believe everything you hear
[1:45:05] on or see on the internet you are in
[1:45:09] trouble and my point is people of God
[1:45:12] there are so many people amen who going
[1:45:14] to miss this Rapture because somebody
[1:45:17] has said don't y'all follow that man and
[1:45:22] they don't F they don't they don't
[1:45:23] understand that's the way God has it
[1:45:25] we're not following a man we follow the
[1:45:27] god in the man amen Jesus said follow me
[1:45:32] Moses follow Mo H hello and that's the
[1:45:36] mystery of this age nobody knew that God
[1:45:39] was going to send us a gentile
[1:45:43] Prophet huh nobody knew that it was in
[1:45:45] the word all along and they weren't
[1:45:48] expecting it but if God dealt with us
[1:45:50] like he did Israel he would have to send
[1:45:52] us a prophet
[1:45:53] amen amen he'd have to in order to get
[1:45:58] us
[1:45:58] right is that right he would have to in
[1:46:01] order to get us right look at all the
[1:46:02] denominational churches and I mean even
[1:46:04] message whatever you want to call it
[1:46:06] everybody got their interpretation and
[1:46:08] when God has plainly said my word is not
[1:46:12] is not given unto any private
[1:46:13] interpretation so if it's not a private
[1:46:15] interpretation God God that means god
[1:46:18] interprets himself so God how is God
[1:46:21] ever interpreting his word read your
[1:46:23] word every time Israel got off the word
[1:46:25] God sent a prophet with the right
[1:46:27] interpretation amen thank you Lord he
[1:46:30] sent a man of God with the signs and
[1:46:33] wonders following that always got them
[1:46:35] on the right track and what Israel did
[1:46:38] America and the world has done they
[1:46:40] always hated the prophets they killed
[1:46:42] the prophet they sold po Isaiah and Twi
[1:46:44] and and two that's what they do that is
[1:46:48] the nature of the so-called children of
[1:46:50] God
[1:46:54] but God had a few people like Mary and
[1:46:57] the woman at the well and blind bot May
[1:47:01] and come on somebody they told him to
[1:47:04] shut up shut
[1:47:06] up not so not so not so this might be my
[1:47:09] last opportunity Hallelujah thou son of
[1:47:12] David have mercy on me so you got to
[1:47:15] understand
[1:47:16] people where Jesus is there is a lot of
[1:47:19] noise think about this though in closing
[1:47:23] we're not we don't have Fine Music we
[1:47:26] don't have these awesome singers but we
[1:47:29] got the word and when you can see a
[1:47:31] people get excited about a word is
[1:47:33] greater than anything
[1:47:35] else
[1:47:36] Hallelujah understand this and they
[1:47:39] didn't have all that music in them
[1:47:43] caves in
[1:47:45] dens they didn't have nothing but what
[1:47:48] they had was their their voices and many
[1:47:51] times they had they couldn't even sing
[1:47:52] in church church cuz they didn't want
[1:47:54] them the the people on the outside to
[1:47:55] hear
[1:47:56] them and sometime they sung
[1:48:00] low but oh the spirit of God would moov
[1:48:02] in them little dens and caves Hallelujah
[1:48:05] why because it was
[1:48:08] Jewels the people of God hallelujah the
[1:48:11] Bible said they had to wear sheep skin
