[35:26] me
[35:36] oh
[35:48] [Music]
[36:06] [Music]
[36:22] the same god that moses met plenty
[36:52] here
[37:19] that same desire is still here
[37:23] he still has the same desire
[37:26] because he drew them out of the world
[37:27] plus he hit his own individual they went
[37:30] by their place yeah
[38:15] hey man let's just stand in honor
[38:29] how good our interpreters
[38:42] and he keeps on
[38:43] interpreting while i'm still talking
[39:05] so i know our brother possesses an
[39:07] ability that i don't have yeah
[39:40] they
[40:19] [Applause]
[40:41] [Music]
[40:44] is
[40:55] have done the same thing
[42:04] but the day of the lord will come as a
[42:06] thief in the night
[42:10] into which the heavens shall pass away
[42:12] with a great noise
[42:16] and the elements shall also melt with
[42:17] the fervent heat
[42:21] and the earth also in the works that are
[42:23] therein shall be burned up
[42:28] seeing then that all these things shall
[42:30] be dissolved
[42:35] what manner of persons ought you to be
[42:39] able to
[42:40] do
[42:41] it
[42:49] looking forward hastening to the coming
[42:51] of the day of god wherein the heavens
[42:53] are being on fire shall be dissolved and
[42:56] the elements shall be
[43:11] according to his promise
[43:14] are looking for a heavens and a new
[43:16] earth
[43:17] righteousness
[43:23] amen let's just
[44:20] so we pray
[45:14] of denominations be ripped off of our
[45:16] faith
[45:30] whatever it is you
[45:44] in the name of jesus christ we pray
[45:47] amen amen you can be seated as well
[45:54] i want to speak a message this morning
[46:22] now our god has something in his mind
[46:24] when he created this world
[46:36] that spirit brooded over this world
[46:38] according to the book of jesus christ
[46:48] but you know when that spirit brooded
[46:50] over this world because it displeased to
[46:52] move israel
[46:53] your body was laying right there
[46:58] amen amen the the the molecules that
[47:01] make up your flesh right now
[47:05] we're laying right there
[47:18] and the waters had to give way as the
[47:20] dry land began to appear
[47:32] that the warmth of that light struck
[47:34] your mortal bodies
[47:51] [Music]
[48:02] his voice is still going across this
[48:15] that the dark ages had covered over all
[48:17] the world right
[48:33] [Music]
[48:45] luther that came crying out
[48:56] and as they were crying out men began to
[48:59] shake themselves
[49:23] when you hear the tapes of uh brother
[49:25] william branham's
[49:56] we know that this world will be
[49:57] dissolved
[50:00] the ways of this world will be dissolved
[50:06] but before that dissolving something has
[50:09] to take place
[50:24] familiar scripture jesus is talking to
[50:26] the woman at the wells
[50:28] family
[50:31] they've been going back and forth
[50:33] talking about doctrines
[50:38] she
[50:53] in verse 22 jesus comes to give her a
[50:56] revelation
[51:00] he says you worship you know not you
[51:02] don't know what
[51:05] um
[51:06] i don't mean
[51:20] the hour
[51:26] when the true worshipers shall worship
[51:28] the father in spirit and truth
[51:34] and watch this and we got these sounds
[51:36] for the father seek as such to worship
[51:39] [Music]
[51:41] the father is looking for something
[51:45] there's nothing new under the sun yeah
[52:02] now there has been things have
[52:04] transpired upon this world
[52:10] they are contrary to that desire of god
[52:15] but those things shall be dissolved
[52:19] there are things that have taken place
[52:20] upon this world that are contrary to the
[52:23] the order of god
[52:29] all of those things will be dissolved
[52:45] uh
[52:47] in a couple of sermons
[52:53] i think in perfect faith
[52:57] also again in blasphemous
[53:11] he also talks about mental faith
[53:47] [Music]
[53:53] we can't see past the ceiling
[54:09] hey man but we probably as brother brown
[54:11] says
[54:14] break into the supernatural and see
[54:15] where you're at
[54:20] our god is supernatural
[54:41] [Music]
[55:05] so i can agree with that
[55:08] you mentally agree with the words
[55:12] your mind says that's true
[55:16] and as as you as you mentally agree with
[55:18] the word
[55:31] the light begins to shine
[55:46] begins to transform into a spiritual
[55:47] faith
[55:52] it's the word that has come into your
[55:54] mind
[55:57] if it was just stop there
[56:29] rises up on the inside of you
[56:34] you're no longer just agreeing to it
[56:35] with your mind
[56:39] but in your heart you begin to say i
[56:41] know
[56:45] [Music]
[56:56] he
[56:58] [Music]
[57:06] oh you could go through deep depressions
[57:15] [Music]
[57:24] you could be on a ventilator somewhere
[57:29] brain dead as they say
[57:33] they say there's no activity coming
[57:35] across
[57:37] activity
[58:06] amen amen oh what's the difference
[58:11] between come out of her my people
[58:15] come out of those denominations
[58:18] come out of your lukewarm living
[58:31] the bands that are binding you that's
[58:34] cool
[58:48] as we read there in uh uh second peter
[58:54] scene that all these things will be
[58:56] dissolved
[58:59] what type of people are we to be
[59:01] jealous
[59:16] according to the ways of this world
[59:21] with a
[59:22] natural mindset
[59:26] knowing that jesus christ is the same
[59:30] knowing the scriptures like where elijah
[59:33] said lord open that young man's eyes
[59:44] oh we're surrounded by the enemy
[59:49] master what are we to do
[59:52] with this man like oh lord open this
[59:55] young man's eyes
[1:00:04] [Music]
[1:00:12] this young man can't serve me tell his
[1:00:14] eyes
[1:00:17] he's over there worrying about what the
[1:00:19] enemy is doing
[1:00:22] and he can't even see what god is doing
[1:00:26] that's a beautiful
[1:00:35] [Music]
[1:00:40] i just don't know what to do
[1:00:43] i got these blinders on i just can't see
[1:00:46] god doing anything just reduce that verb
[1:00:54] you know when the holy spirit was
[1:00:55] brewing over this world
[1:00:56] they sent this penis remove issue like
[1:00:58] damn
[1:00:59] all the dirt in the world
[1:01:02] uh was under the water
[1:01:04] all the dirt in the world was unknown
[1:01:08] on filmmaker
[1:01:22] because here is going to call for the
[1:01:23] light to come
[1:01:26] but the light how could it penetrate the
[1:01:28] waters
[1:01:32] the light needed to warm the dirt
[1:01:50] lukewarm
[1:01:53] when you begin to back slide
[1:01:57] first
[1:01:59] the enemy will begin to shut your ears
[1:02:04] being
[1:02:18] anymore
[1:02:19] [Music]
[1:02:33] [Music]
[1:02:42] [Music]
[1:02:45] and now when you begin to agree with the
[1:02:46] devil during the week
[1:02:52] and no longer responding to the word on
[1:02:54] sunday
[1:02:58] then you don't feel like praying anymore
[1:03:01] [Music]
[1:03:14] it says supernatural spiritually minded
[1:03:17] oh you're dead
[1:03:19] spiritual that's right amen amen amen
[1:03:23] then he brings his temptations to you
[1:03:25] hello
[1:03:28] and allison you don't feel like going to
[1:03:30] church anymore
[1:03:36] you're you're covering yourself up with
[1:03:38] the waters all over again
[1:03:42] yep
[1:04:53] yeah
[1:04:55] i hope he's found you yeah is your
[1:04:57] question
[1:04:58] if he has found you see who's that cool
[1:05:01] yeah something in his mind
[1:05:04] he has a vision of you and his mind
[1:05:20] of you
[1:05:33] we know that vision exists
[1:05:36] if god has ever once come knocking on
[1:05:38] your heart's door
[1:05:43] and he has a vision of your life
[1:06:14] now in the old testament they have the
[1:06:15] natural veil no
[1:06:32] see they are worshipping the god behind
[1:06:34] that curtain in the temple
[1:06:38] they are worshiping what they thought
[1:06:40] was behind that curse
[1:06:45] but you know god ripped that rail that
[1:06:47] veil too
[1:06:51] what they didn't know is their god was
[1:06:53] hanging on the cross
[1:07:25] no god has been revealed
[1:07:29] ii corinthians says the veil is upon
[1:07:31] their heart
[1:07:37] but if they would ever turn and face the
[1:07:39] lord
[1:08:07] the invisible god came down to moses
[1:08:11] amen moses
[1:08:13] went into egypt
[1:08:20] it was god and moses
[1:08:22] being
[1:08:29] [Music]
[1:09:02] you begin to discern their problems
[1:09:32] someone believed just now
[1:09:36] no i really like that part
[1:09:39] because he would know the light was in
[1:09:41] the room
[1:09:45] he's here he could say sometimes
[1:09:58] because he knew what it took to get that
[1:10:00] presence that was there
[1:10:06] but how do you get that presence to be
[1:10:08] over someone's head
[1:10:10] come on
[1:10:14] oh the people
[1:10:22] [Music]
[1:10:28] let me put this away there are real
[1:10:29] problems
[1:10:32] spiritual problems
[1:10:34] natural problems
[1:10:37] things that were against the vision that
[1:10:39] god had for them before the foundations
[1:10:48] [Music]
[1:10:56] how could he ever get those two together
[1:11:02] the one that has the problem should we
[1:11:04] get the problem and the one that can
[1:11:05] solve the problem
[1:11:10] then he'd make that statement
[1:11:15] someone believed just now
[1:11:18] amen someone will start praying
[1:11:21] they start believing
[1:11:38] you're just praying just now
[1:11:41] now how did brother braham know that
[1:11:45] beginning to subscribe what they were
[1:11:47] praying for
[1:11:50] there was something in the room that was
[1:11:51] greater than him yeah
[1:12:07] but there was a veil that was upon the
[1:12:08] people's hearts
[1:12:11] some could walk out of the meeting and
[1:12:13] say well that's all right
[1:12:19] i say well brother abraham he's a good
[1:12:21] preacher
[1:12:25] or yeah i i know those things can happen
[1:12:28] in the meeting sometimes
[1:12:31] yeah this is the show
[1:12:33] they don't realize that there that god
[1:12:36] was revealing himself
[1:12:42] to get the people to shake themselves
[1:12:47] to realize the day they are living
[1:12:56] and we in our day can say
[1:12:59] well i know brother branham could do
[1:13:01] those things
[1:13:15] the pillar of fire is still here
[1:13:18] hallelujah the god is still here to
[1:13:21] change his people
[1:13:24] to get away from the natural type of
[1:13:26] thinking
[1:13:29] to get the supernatural thinking
[1:13:34] to reject the things of this world
[1:13:38] because they're going to be dissolved
[1:13:39] one of these
[1:13:42] amen
[1:13:44] get yourself on the path to the
[1:13:45] supernatural
[1:13:47] [Music]
[1:13:49] amen i want to read a quote here from uh
[1:13:52] the absolute
[1:13:53] verb
[1:13:56] absolutely
[1:14:02] over in uh 1963
[1:14:05] midnight
[1:14:08] and paragraph 60
[1:14:10] uh guy of switzerland
[1:15:08] now he's watching something here
[1:15:10] you can see amen his mind he he he's in
[1:15:13] the supernatural yeah
[1:15:16] he's down here he's in the earth
[1:15:18] standing on the earth describing
[1:15:20] something he sees
[1:15:34] [Music]
[1:15:48] there came a line of blood
[1:15:50] only
[1:16:45] i'm going to preach a sermon called the
[1:16:46] trail of the serpent
[1:16:52] the trail of the serpent
[1:16:57] because he saw a trail of that serpent
[1:17:00] all through time
[1:17:14] he was preaching that message all along
[1:17:18] but not just that message the pastor
[1:17:22] but he was also preaching on the trail
[1:17:24] of the holy spirit
[1:17:28] as brother brown said
[1:17:30] if you could ever see the the the the
[1:17:33] trail the two spirits in the church
[1:17:38] if you can identify the two spirits see
[1:17:41] the church don't
[1:17:42] do
[1:17:55] so he saw eternity break
[1:18:11] now remember he preached this in the
[1:18:13] message the absolutely
[1:18:16] and absolutely he talked about the word
[1:18:18] being our typos
[1:18:23] we're not tied to the denominations
[1:18:37] and from calvary tied with this line it
[1:18:40] goes on to the thai post jesus
[1:18:45] christ
[1:18:49] and when he comes to claim his own
[1:18:52] economy
[1:19:20] is
[1:19:50] oh maybe when they were slaying those
[1:19:52] lambs at the temple door
[1:19:58] they didn't realize what they were doing
[1:19:59] maybe you know
[1:20:41] [Music]
[1:20:44] when you're
[1:20:59] and if that line ever starts to go up
[1:21:03] no matter how much you're gripped onto
[1:21:04] the mountain
[1:21:08] that line is stronger than your grip is
[1:21:23] they were clipped to a line they went
[1:21:24] from eden to cows
[1:21:34] [Music]
[1:22:06] and the graves begin to open that's
[1:22:08] right
[1:22:19] as jesus christ begin to resurrect
[1:22:49] you know there's a line that also goes
[1:23:18] these
[1:23:24] amen
[1:23:34] and someday he says
[1:23:39] when he comes to claim his own coin
[1:23:44] everyone is tied to that ultimate
[1:23:48] [Music]
[1:24:00] he's
[1:24:11] [Music]

[1:25:57] mental faith began to give way
[1:26:01] to a perfect faith
[1:26:06] it says oh it's just getting milky all
[1:26:07] over people
[1:26:12] dead began to be raised
[1:26:17] the blind began to see
[1:26:20] sins
[1:26:34] that
[1:27:02] i don't have a sign to make me anything
[1:27:06] amen but he's still the same yes
[1:27:09] to tie you back to that message
[1:27:13] amen
[1:27:14] you know there's different thoughts in
[1:27:16] the message
[1:28:17] says that's nothing but the truth
[1:28:20] i believe in him
[1:28:22] amen
[1:28:26] amen line went from eden
[1:28:33] also goes from calvary
[1:28:36] to the rapture
[1:28:38] that lion's been made plain in our day
[1:28:40] since
[1:28:53] you
[1:29:09] when he was preaching that sermon
[1:29:15] called a man running from the presidency
[1:29:20] he says you know a lot of people would
[1:29:22] like to talk

[1:31:57] for him to go to nineveh
[1:32:04] now he's paying the price off his own
[1:32:06] pocket
[1:32:10] to go down to
[1:32:36] but no matter how great the cost is
[1:32:41] for the things that we have done well it

[1:33:45] and that price was more than a dollar

[1:36:07] the bible just upon the deal

[1:37:39] unless he went down into the ship he
[1:37:41] called me mounted
[1:37:43] he fell asleep
[1:37:45] he didn't
[1:37:46] tell me
[1:37:58] the boat began to
[1:38:00] crest
[1:38:01] [Music]
[1:38:15] pretty soon the the waves were twice as
[1:38:17] high as the boat was cool
[1:38:22] so the boat will be going up the way for
[1:38:25] like a couple seconds
[1:38:29] [Music]
[1:38:56] they took down the sales
[1:38:58] sheets
[1:39:00] um
[1:39:07] then they began that wasn't enough
[1:39:10] is
[1:39:24] and that wasn't enough
[1:39:27] the waves were still coming over
[1:39:32] and then they finally said everybody on
[1:39:34] the boat
[1:39:37] start crying out to the god that you
[1:39:39] serve come on
[1:39:43] that wasn't enough
[1:39:46] and so they began to search the boat and
[1:39:48] there was a man sleeping in the bottom
[1:39:50] of the boat
[1:39:52] a little bit
[1:40:05] and they began to quit him
[1:40:09] who are here
[1:40:11] he says i'm a man that's fleeing from
[1:40:13] the i'm the prophet of jehovah
[1:40:18] the god of the heaven that created the
[1:40:20] heavens and the earth
[1:40:23] and i'm running from his presence
[1:40:27] and they are like why would you do such
[1:40:30] a thing
[1:40:34] hey so
[1:40:36] [Music]
[1:40:47] i'm on this boat
[1:41:01] and i have done everything i know how to
[1:41:03] do in my own strength to run from god
[1:41:10] and i now realize that in my running
[1:41:16] i have not just affected me
[1:41:22] but i have now affected the lives of
[1:41:24] everybody else on the boat
[1:41:29] come on
[1:41:30] and begin to get
[1:42:09] and throw me into the price of jehovah's
[1:42:24] he paid the price to go out of the will
[1:42:26] of god
[1:42:39] he was completely at the will and mercy
[1:42:41] of god
[1:42:46] the waves were still there
[1:42:50] the lightning was still there
[1:42:53] the rain was still there i appreciate
[1:42:55] that the clouds were still there
[1:42:59] the cracking of the thunder was still
[1:43:01] there
[1:43:04] but the mercy of god was still there
[1:43:31] [Music]
[1:43:50] as he began to sink with his hands tied
[1:43:52] behind him
[1:43:58] his feet tied together
[1:44:02] there was not one thing left that he
[1:44:03] could do
[1:44:58] i wasn't expecting god to save me expect
[1:45:01] it back to drew me so i thought maybe i
[1:45:04] was done for it
[1:45:08] but the salvation of god came by my door
[1:45:11] [Music]
[1:45:13] because the price that god paid was so
[1:45:15] great
[1:45:18] and no matter how far out of the will of
[1:45:19] god you think you are important
[1:45:23] that line the calvary is still there
[1:45:27] amen as he was thrown overboard his
[1:45:30] mind happened to clip into that lineup
[1:45:35] and god sent him a fish to take him back
[1:45:41] back to that sacrifice
[1:45:46] not knowing that when he had slowed this
[1:45:48] the last slam that he had slain
[1:45:51] the last lamb that he had
[1:46:10] it's seeing that we know these things
[1:46:12] and our canoe several shoes
[1:46:14] that all these natural things will be
[1:46:16] dissolved because it shows nature
[1:46:20] whatever price you've paid to get out of
[1:46:22] the will of god
[1:46:38] you've lost the battle so many times
[1:46:42] you don't know what to do anymore let's
[1:46:43] have a pretty quick effect
[1:46:46] the price that god paid
[1:46:48] could you happy this is still there
[1:46:51] to bring you back to the world
[1:47:09] i want to turn over to or uh
[1:47:12] let's turn over to isaiah chapter 26
[1:47:15] tonight
[1:47:30] yeah a while back i preached a sermon
[1:47:32] called
[1:47:33] understanding
[1:47:47] in the old testament
[1:47:51] david spoke a lot about tender mercies
[1:47:58] and loving kindness a
[1:48:01] compassionate
[1:48:09] and when you go to the old testament
[1:48:14] and you break down those two
[1:48:17] hebrew words
[1:48:22] you know david before we before we read
[1:48:24] isaiah 26
[1:48:30] in psalms 103.
[1:48:40] you know there's a couple really good
[1:48:42] verses there at the beginning of psalms
[1:48:44] 103.
[1:48:50] you know says
[1:48:52] bless the lord all my soul and all that
[1:48:54] is within me
[1:48:58] bless
[1:49:23] [Music]
[1:49:25] he says who redeems thy life
[1:49:40] but there's
[1:49:53] saline
[1:50:04] [Music]
[1:50:12] [Music]
[1:50:22] fills you with the holy ghost
[1:50:24] gives you a crown of loving kindness
[1:50:27] and tender mercy him easily
[1:50:32] and psalms 107
[1:50:35] psalms
[1:50:42] psalms 107 they have some some sense
[1:50:45] yeah there's five stories in that psalm
[1:50:48] yeah
[1:50:51] and each story is shaky stuart
[1:50:54] talks about a people that get to their
[1:50:57] to their wit's end as we say in english
[1:51:00] where they get to their
[1:51:08] [Music]
[1:51:17] they get to the place where they can no
[1:51:28] [Music]
[1:51:45] it talks about those that were wandering
[1:51:47] through the wilderness in the desert
[1:51:52] they're hungry and thirsty
[1:51:55] after they left egypt
[1:51:58] their soul was fainting
[1:52:24] [Music]
[1:52:43] and then you come down to uh the last
[1:52:45] few verses of psalms 107.
[1:52:49] after telling these five stories
[1:52:54] people that were at their at their last
[1:52:56] option
[1:53:09] in their
[1:53:10] lives they get the verse 42.
[1:53:15] it says the righteous shall see it and
[1:53:17] rejoice
[1:53:35] no matter where you are in your life's
[1:53:36] journey
[1:53:52] that the god that loves you so much
[1:53:55] museum has paid the price for you to get
[1:53:57] back to the wilderness
[1:54:06] isaiah 46 or 26 so i was going to read
[1:54:09] there
[1:54:12] isaiah 26 3.
[1:54:15] we'll close with this
[1:54:28] that will keep him in perfect peace
[1:54:31] whose mind is stayed on thee
[1:54:34] because he trusteth
[1:54:48] where
[1:54:58] [Music]
[1:55:02] no it's just over the
[1:55:04] just over the doorpost
[1:55:10] it's a dimension a little faster than
[1:55:11] this one
[1:55:16] and if you can just let these walls and
[1:55:18] the ceiling disappear
[1:55:22] get yourself out of your natural
[1:55:24] thinking
[1:55:28] i realize even if you've paid the price
[1:55:30] to flee from the presence of the lord
[1:55:37] the god will still make sure that line
[1:55:38] is still routed
[1:55:44] just throw
[1:55:56] [Music]
[1:55:58] so i
[1:56:04] [Music]
[1:56:11] and you'll realize that they've
[1:56:25] peace in your mind has been here
[1:56:27] [Music]
[1:56:29] oh that that that that line has been
[1:56:31] here all along

[1:56:37] salvation he paid for it
[1:56:40] that's
[1:57:08] thank you
[1:57:25] you know that line will still
[1:57:27] dip down into time right here
[1:57:32] because he's the same yesterday today
[1:57:36] he has not changed
[1:57:50] because only they they have their eyes
[1:57:52] open to it
[1:57:59] when you see what he's done for you
[1:58:03] you can't truly love him
[1:58:07] until you catch the revelation of what

[1:58:15] scripture he will be accepted
