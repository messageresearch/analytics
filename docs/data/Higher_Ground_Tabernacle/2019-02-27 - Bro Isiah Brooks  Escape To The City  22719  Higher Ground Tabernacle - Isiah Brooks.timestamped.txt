[34:04] the Lord be beautiful and glorious and
[34:08] the fruit of the earth shall be
[34:10] excellent and calmly for them that are
[34:14] escaped of Israel and it shall come to
[34:18] pass that he that is left in Zion and he
[34:21] that remaineth in Jerusalem shall be
[34:24] called holy even every one that is
[34:28] written among the living in Jerusalem
[34:31] and when the Lord shall have washed away
[34:34] the filth of the daughters of Zion and
[34:36] shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem
[34:40] from the midst thereof by the spirit of
[34:42] judgment and by the spirit of Boerne the
[34:45] Lord will create upon every dwelling
[34:48] place of Mount Zion and upon her
[34:51] assemblies a cloud and smoke by day and
[34:54] the shining of flaming fire by night for
[34:58] upon all the glory shall be defense and
[35:02] there shall be a tabernacle for shadow
[35:05] in the daytime from the heat and for a
[35:08] place of refuge and for covered from the
[35:12] storm and from rain let us pray father
[35:17] God we come before you lord jesus as
[35:20] humbly as we know how we thank you for
[35:23] your grace and your mercy
[35:25] we thank you for your goodness Lord you
[35:27] have been better to us and we've been to
[35:29] ourselves and father I don't know how to
[35:32] put this together but you gave us the
[35:34] thought and we're just committing
[35:36] everything into your hands Lord we pray
[35:39] that you would just have your way
[35:41] tonight in your name Lord Jesus Christ
[35:44] move me my person out of the way we want
[35:49] to just see your person on display break
[35:52] and destroy the yoke to the enemy and
[35:54] Jesus Christ's name we pray amen
[35:57] you may be seated we're living in the
[36:04] last days and everybody knows something
[36:08] is about to happen whether you be a
[36:11] religious person or a non-religious
[36:13] person everybody knows that the world is
[36:17] falling apart and really everybody does
[36:21] it they don't know really where to run
[36:24] there are those who are trying to escape
[36:27] and thinking that somehow they'll be
[36:30] able to build on underground shelter
[36:33] some think they can run to the mountain
[36:36] some think that they could you know
[36:37] perhaps discover something on Mars and
[36:40] put a planet
[36:41] put on some type of refuge up there you
[36:44] know people got all kinds of crazy ideas
[36:46] and as if God is stupid and he doesn't
[36:50] know what he's doing but we know one
[36:54] thing that God is God and I heard the
[36:59] prophet of God say which is so true the
[37:01] Word of God declares it that the law of
[37:04] God makes every seed produces itself
[37:11] whether it is a seed of wheat or whether
[37:16] it be a sea of a kookabura seed or any
[37:22] kind of a weed it doesn't matter God is
[37:25] the creator of all things understand
[37:28] that even when when he said in the
[37:31] garden God has given me a man or a son
[37:36] however she put it
[37:37] I mean God is the only one
[37:39] that could have given it to her if Satan
[37:41] could have given her a son he would have
[37:42] made him a creator but the law of God
[37:46] had already been established at every
[37:48] seat should bring forth of his kind and
[37:50] so we realized by God's grace it doesn't
[37:53] matter I mean what the world thinks and
[37:56] and what the ideas are when it comes to
[38:00] the bride of Jesus Christ because we're
[38:03] not the one who's producing this thing
[38:05] we're not the ones who's going to make
[38:08] it happen it is God who will make it all
[38:11] happen something is about to happen and
[38:14] everybody knows it
[38:17] the animals knows it they don't know
[38:19] which way to fly anymore they don't know
[38:21] where to find shelter I mean everything
[38:24] the earth knows it it's wobbling and
[38:27] carrying on like a drunkard and the
[38:29] seasonal changes are or changes because
[38:32] the word world in itself knows it's
[38:34] about ready to give birth now we
[38:38] understand by God's grace that there's
[38:42] only one way of escape there's only one
[38:45] place of refuge there's only one place
[38:48] where a man can hide in this day I am I
[38:54] I like to title this message escape to
[39:02] the city
[39:03] escape to the city if I had a subtopic
[39:08] it would be the right to no penalty the
[39:15] right to no penalty because you got to
[39:19] realize amen the Bible says that for
[39:22] every transgression there's a just
[39:26] recompense he is that all right the
[39:30] Bible also tells us that for the wages
[39:33] of sin is death but there is a gift and
[39:37] that gift of God is eternal life through
[39:41] our Lord Jesus Christ so we think about
[39:45] escaping that means we get free of we
[39:49] whatever had us in bondage
[39:52] now has been done away with
[39:55] we have come to a place where we're no
[39:59] longer held by whatever had us in
[40:03] bondage it means that the Fowler's snare
[40:05] has been broken and you and I must
[40:09] understand also that only God can do
[40:12] that God is the only one that can break
[40:15] the Fowler's snare now when we talk
[40:19] about penalty you and I understand that
[40:22] God told Adam and Eve the day that you
[40:25] eat of this tree you should surely die
[40:28] now God has a law and I want you to
[40:32] understand that this law was given even
[40:34] to Moses before Joshua established it
[40:39] this law was given and I'm going to go
[40:43] through that law it's called this law
[40:47] was dealing with a place of refuge and
[40:53] these cities were named by God himself
[40:58] and we must understand by God's grace
[41:02] that God knew man was going to sin and
[41:07] he knew Israel was going to sin and we
[41:10] know he knew that Israel was going to do
[41:12] things that they should not have not be
[41:15] doing and he also knew that something
[41:17] that they would do would be by accident
[41:19] and some things they would do would be
[41:22] by being deliberate when I was thinking
[41:27] about this refuge and because you got to
[41:32] realize that God has a great plan he
[41:35] he's amazing in what he does and he
[41:39] wants us to know how much he really
[41:41] loves us you know even though he told
[41:44] Adam and Eve you shall surely died he
[41:46] comes right back with his grace and
[41:48] makes a way a refuge you understand me
[41:52] and you know when when I think about it
[41:55] I think about how when Adam and Eve
[41:58] sinned now the Bible says that Eve was
[42:01] deceived
[42:03] she was tricked into it
[42:06] but Adam eyes was wide open hello and he
[42:11] was influenced by the murderer we call
[42:14] Satan Oh Lucifer and when Adam walked
[42:19] out he walked out and then to save his
[42:23] bride but you gotta understand
[42:26] regardless to what his reasoning were he
[42:29] still broke the Word of God and God
[42:33] found a way to save Adam he was guilty
[42:40] both of them were guilty even though
[42:43] they tried to blame the other is that
[42:46] right the only one that did not get away
[42:49] was the man who did it deliberately and
[42:52] that was the serpent hmm cuz that was
[42:59] the law of refuge you could go into a
[43:01] city and be safe
[43:02] if you accidentally killed but it was if
[43:08] it was premeditated you could not you
[43:12] would not be allowed in the city in
[43:14] other words you had to run for your life
[43:18] and we look at this thing and we says oh
[43:23] what a horrible punishment now watch
[43:26] this because when Cain slew Abel God
[43:33] presented him with a way of escape but
[43:37] his answer toward God made it clear that
[43:42] King purposely intentionally
[43:46] meditatively killed his brother Abel and
[43:51] the pivoting of that was to mark him
[43:55] there was no salvation for Cain there
[44:00] was no place of refuge for Cain there
[44:03] was no escaping the penalty and the
[44:08] penalty was death God excommunicated
[44:12] Cain and the Bible said came from that
[44:15] monel went out of the presence of God
[44:18] that's real
[44:20] he was dead before he died right now
[44:26] watch this I don't want to jump but you
[44:30] got to understand there's a reason why
[44:32] the Bible says a voice walked in the
[44:36] cool of the evening because that voice
[44:41] he meant was the Tree of Life that voice
[44:45] in itself was God right
[44:48] so because God cannot find another place
[44:54] a refuge outside of himself God is my
[45:00] refuge
[45:00] David said he's my refuge he's my hiding
[45:04] place
[45:04] he's eclipsed in the rock and you and I
[45:07] must understand and then that God is
[45:10] calling in all of us murderers by birth
[45:19] and you and I must realize listen for
[45:24] the man who said it like this he said
[45:26] these CDs were for people men who
[45:30] accidentally killed he said that's the
[45:35] way it is he said you've got two kinds
[45:37] of people people who don't want to live
[45:40] sinfully people who don't enjoy sin he
[45:46] said those cities were built for them
[45:50] and he said but that man who loves sin
[45:54] don't want to have nothing to do with
[45:56] Christ or salvation he's a murderer and
[46:00] he receives the penalty of a murderer he
[46:04] must die you know how the law would go
[46:10] the law would be that if it was by
[46:14] accident and I'm just gonna because we
[46:17] don't have that much time if it was by
[46:19] accident that man had to run because he
[46:25] had if he killed this man and this man
[46:29] had a brother or had some cousins or
[46:30] uncle's or whatever
[46:33] were would be compelled because they
[46:37] were under the the the law an eye for an
[46:40] eye and a tooth for tooth you killed my
[46:43] brother I'm killing you and those men or
[46:47] whoever would be they had to run escape
[46:51] the city and God had already designed
[46:56] another city a place where they could
[47:01] find refuge is that right
[47:06] first of all when that man if he was to
[47:09] get in a come to the city he had to
[47:12] first a men get by pasty the gatekeeper
[47:16] the judges they had to hear the trial
[47:20] they had to hear what he had to say and
[47:22] he had to plead oh lord have mercy on me
[47:25] huh I didn't mean to do it this is how
[47:27] it really was and they would judge that
[47:31] and if it was found worthy of the city
[47:36] he would come in and it was a law among
[47:40] Israel no matter what the crime was that
[47:43] person was safe but if he purposely did
[47:48] it the relatives of that man could come
[47:53] it didn't matter if the man was on the
[47:55] horns of the altar they could drag that
[47:58] man out of the city just to kill him
[48:01] oh come on somebody I'm coming by God's
[48:05] grace because I want you to understand
[48:08] that this message that we have God has
[48:12] designed it for our refuge hallelujah
[48:18] did it's not the scripture said that a
[48:20] man will become our refuge I mean
[48:26] because that man is all it has always
[48:29] been a man hallelujah though the lamb
[48:34] was slain the lamb in itself was a man
[48:38] and that's the only way you go to find
[48:41] refuge is under the blood of Jesus
[48:43] Christ there's so many people who think
[48:46] well
[48:46] the blood of Jesus Christ if you were
[48:48] under the blood of Jesus Christ that
[48:50] blood would change you
[48:52] blood would sanctify you that blood will
[48:56] fill you and the life of that blood will
[48:59] enter into you the Sun shines and the
[49:06] judgment it doesn't matter the Sun will
[49:08] shine you know it on the just and the
[49:10] unjust the rain falls on the on the just
[49:13] and the unjust but the rain can't change
[49:17] what the seed is neither can the Sun the
[49:21] Sun in the rain only produces what the
[49:25] seed is Oh somebody help me here I love
[49:30] this it brings a peace it brings a joy
[49:33] to my soul to know it meant that I can
[49:36] only produce what I am and God has
[49:39] determined that hallelujah Jesus even
[49:46] sitting I'm skipping a little bit but
[49:47] Jesus said all that the father has given
[49:50] me shall come to me and him that cometh
[49:54] to me I will in no wise cast him out ha
[49:58] because I know him and I know he didn't
[50:01] need to sin in the first place somebody
[50:05] helped me here he was tricked into it
[50:09] hmm see God want us to realize him and
[50:17] that one thing he can't do and I think a
[50:19] lot of time we fail and I say we I'm
[50:21] just generalizing everything we fail to
[50:23] see that God cannot lie but Hebrews 6 17
[50:27] through 20 says we're we're in God
[50:29] willing more abundantly to show unto the
[50:32] air of promise the immutability of his
[50:35] counsel confirmed it by an oath that by
[50:39] two immutable things in which was it was
[50:42] impossible for God to lie we might have
[50:45] a strong consolation and who have fled
[50:50] for refuge to lay a hold upon the hope
[50:54] set before us
[50:58] what was this hope
[51:00] City a place of hiding see we have what
[51:08] we must flee in any oh I'm just gonna
[51:11] get there no sir this is a time to run
[51:14] this is a time to escape you and I know
[51:18] that the Lord is soon to come we know it
[51:20] we don't have to wait for the California
[51:23] earthquake we know it's coming
[51:27] the you and I must realize it meant if
[51:30] you're caught outside of the city the
[51:33] devil who is the executioner has a right
[51:36] to you
[51:38] he is the Avenger of blood he Amen we'll
[51:45] take care of you if you caught outside
[51:48] of the blood only those who are in the
[51:52] blood in Christ will be safe from this
[51:57] guy wherefore the Runner is for us
[52:02] entered I love this because he defeated
[52:07] Satan the forerunner we know we deserve
[52:12] death we know it meant that we are
[52:14] guilty but God came to save those who
[52:19] did who was tricked into it the
[52:24] understanding those a men who didn't
[52:28] mean to do it you know that's how come
[52:31] we can repent you repeat because you
[52:33] didn't mean to do it you repent because
[52:36] she was tricked into it Satan got the
[52:39] best of you right how many of you times
[52:42] you tried to do good and evil was came
[52:45] out of something you tried to do good
[52:47] it's just a way to devil can do things
[52:49] where the venom tells about this story
[52:52] how he went to visit this man who was in
[52:55] prison he was a black man and he got
[52:57] there at the prison he says what a
[52:59] good-looking handsome intelligent black
[53:02] man like yourself doing in here he said
[53:06] I'll tell you the story he said I used
[53:08] to be a Christian he said and and my
[53:11] name was a bishop
[53:14] so my friends would call me holy bishop
[53:17] he said but I got tired and I slipped
[53:20] and I ended up going with the wrong
[53:22] crowd and he said these boys in the
[53:26] neighborhood wanted me to take them to
[53:28] the store said my wife told me not to
[53:30] take him said a they were bad boys they
[53:32] gonna get you in trouble he said I
[53:34] started let him drive my conscience but
[53:35] she said no don't let him do that
[53:37] they're tearing up said I just decided
[53:39] to drive him took him up to the store
[53:41] and while I waited outside
[53:43] I heard gun fires I heard the bullets go
[53:47] off the gun go off and all of a sudden
[53:49] the guys come running out they had
[53:51] robbed the place you see and I tried to
[53:53] tell no no no no I'm not a part of this
[53:55] you got to tell them you know I've got a
[53:57] part of this I'm innocent everything

[54:04] if you're not gonna go with us you're
[54:06] gonna get caught anyway and the guy said
[54:08] well you're not going to get away and he
[54:09] said by that time the police came see

[54:26] escape you gotta run when you see the
[54:29] devil setting you up you gotta run you
[54:31] can't just play with the devil
[54:33] it's like Joseph when Potiphar's wife
[54:36] they make a man you know sir their
[54:39] husband in the head and she saw him and
[54:44] Joseph when she went after him Jones
[54:46] have been played I don't know how he

[54:49] I remember the Bible said he escaped he
[54:51] left his clothes and everything an
[54:56] escape he had to run he had to flee from
[55:01] the situation Oh somebody help me here
[55:05] you can't play with the devil even you
[55:08] don't chose him then playing it parva
[55:12] wife did he was a pot she was a part of
[55:15] the whole thing but he didn't plan it
[55:17] what do you do he had a choice I could
[55:20] follow to this woman or run from her but
[55:23] this woman is a woman of authority she
[55:26] can really get me in trouble
[55:27] she did but he did not know that he was
[55:31] in the plan of God y'all hear me so what
[55:37] am I trying to say this young man Amen
[55:40] with the court he had a shrewd a
[55:44] prosecutor and the prosecutor says sir

[56:03] questioning he was found guilty and he
[56:07] had to spend ten years in prison for
[56:13] something he did not mean to do brother
[56:17] LEM said that's the way it is Satan is a
[56:19] shrewd fella he gets you in trouble
[56:23] and you have to pay for it and then who
[56:25] comes and get you out however yeah he's
[56:29] our y'all hear what I'm saying God had
[56:34] to sit up and you know what the man was
[56:36] I used to be Christian and God sent a
[56:39] prophet and pray for him that he might
[56:41] get paroled you understand me see
[56:45] Amen we are in a situation now that we
[56:48] didn't need to be in but with true sons
[56:51] and daughters of God we just did not
[56:55] happen to happen we were here and in
[56:59] God's sauce before the foundation of the
[57:02] world
[57:02] we were in him but now look at us fallen
[57:09] we didn't mean to do it we didn't intend
[57:12] to be born sinners but God allowed it to
[57:15] happen so that we can see he ears our
[57:19] xscape he is our refuge hallelujah see
[57:25] you and I must understand that the blood
[57:27] of Jesus Christ saved the whole world
[57:30] did you know that the blood of Jesus
[57:33] Christ when it dropped on the earth
[57:35] saved the whole world did you know that
[57:39] that when
[57:40] when the world went through a flood him
[57:42] in the north day and that was
[57:44] justification
[57:45] did you know Amen that God justified us
[57:48] even in the soil the body that you're
[57:53] now occupying was justified even then
[58:00] hallelujah and then Jesus came don't
[58:03] tell me you can't be sanctified because
[58:05] he already sanctified you the blood
[58:09] sanctify and if God can sanctify the
[58:12] dirt before I get into it Oh what can he
[58:18] do with me in my spirit hallelujah but
[58:21] it will do nobody it won't do you any
[58:24] good if you don't accept it huh see you
[58:29] got to accept your salvation in order to
[58:32] be saved
[58:33] I didn't say almost accept it I think
[58:37] I'm saying you got to believe it about
[58:40] faith that you are saying that's how you
[58:43] get sanctified you got to believe that
[58:45] you're sanctified by faith before you
[58:49] ever become sanctified you got to
[58:51] believe you sanctified before you ever
[58:57] get the Holy Ghost you got to believe I
[58:59] got it it's mine it's for me otherwise
[59:05] you won't get it if you keep wondering
[59:07] the reason for me am i one of them no
[59:10] sure without faith it's impossible to
[59:14] please God listen you're running for
[59:17] your life you must escape mm-hmm is that
[59:25] okay the Bible says for as much as you
[59:30] know that you were not redeemed with
[59:31] corruptible things as silver and gold
[59:34] from your vain conversation received by
[59:37] tradition from your father's you don't I
[59:40] mean you inherited things vain
[59:43] traditions but with the precious blood
[59:46] of Christ as a lamb without blemish and
[59:49] without spot prevailing for four days
[59:52] before the foundation of the world
[59:54] but was manifested in these last times
[59:56] for you what are you saying though death
[59:59] is raining seemingly seemingly because
[1:00:05] the Bible tells us that Christ called
[1:00:07] could death hell and the grave it just
[1:00:11] appeared to see it seems like he has
[1:00:14] power but it has no power God's tripped
[1:00:18] him up those y'all better hear what I'm
[1:00:20] saying but you see with all even though
[1:00:23] Satan have been stripped of all his
[1:00:25] power it'll do you no good until you
[1:00:28] believe that do you receive it Oh
[1:00:31] somebody help me here you must believe
[1:00:34] that you are the god of Satan and not
[1:00:38] Satan is your God ah because you and I
[1:00:42] are eternal and Satan is not eternal you
[1:00:51] must realize he meant there's a reason
[1:00:54] oh Lord
[1:00:55] understand there was only six cities
[1:00:59] that they could escape to with the
[1:01:01] natural six but I added two more
[1:01:06] I believe God showed me this he didn't
[1:01:10] right there in the scripture Oh help me
[1:01:14] Lord let me go through it in just a
[1:01:15] moment
[1:01:16] first of all I want you to realize that
[1:01:18] God is sovereign mmm when God said
[1:01:24] whatsoever thing you desire when you
[1:01:27] pray believe you receive that whatsoever
[1:01:30] thing you desire these things that I'll
[1:01:33] do share you also for I go to my father
[1:01:36] that's true he says listen it's true
[1:01:38] he's sovereign you're gonna prove him
[1:01:41] wrong now if you desire to be in a
[1:01:46] rapture who gave you the desire if you
[1:01:50] desire to be holy
[1:01:52] who gave you that desire and then come
[1:01:55] from Lucifer he's wicked you and I know
[1:01:59] what it wants to be under him hello but
[1:02:03] God said he has broken the chains of
[1:02:06] darkness
[1:02:07] hallelujah we always talk about this
[1:02:10] message being the message of Jubilee but
[1:02:12] the Jubilee has sounded and therefore
[1:02:15] every one of us didn't tonight can go
[1:02:18] free ain't no excuse you got take scape
[1:02:25] now all slave didn't go free they really
[1:02:29] enjoyed their masters and when they
[1:02:32] would return or stay there the master
[1:02:35] would take ore and void it that's why we
[1:02:38] don't wear earrings because it is
[1:02:40] symbolic of slavery and when they board
[1:02:45] they would bore you in the ear everybody
[1:02:48] knew now that you you know your slave
[1:02:51] an intentional slave hmm but gotta say a
[1:02:58] scale or diversity I'm gonna tell you
[1:03:02] something the Bible says Strait is the
[1:03:04] gate narrow is the way and only a few be
[1:03:08] that find it it ain't gonna be such a
[1:03:11] great multitude because many of the most
[1:03:14] of the people have chosen to be slaves
[1:03:17] hallelujah but to those who want to be
[1:03:20] free God said he whom the Sun sets free
[1:03:23] is free indeed
[1:03:24] and where the Spirit of the Lord is
[1:03:27] there is Liberty
[1:03:28] Paul says listen I will not be in
[1:03:30] bondage to no man to nothing hallelujah
[1:03:34] that's our Liberty in Christ he is the
[1:03:39] city of refuge I'm jumping now sometimes
[1:03:42] you may feel like you ain't worth
[1:03:44] nothing but I'm worth more than you
[1:03:46] think
[1:03:46] so are you the Prophet God said one soul
[1:03:50] is worth ten thousand worlds look at me
[1:03:53] look at yourself God has said you worth
[1:03:57] more than ten thousand words not just
[1:04:00] one not just to not just three but ten
[1:04:03] thousand where's hallelujah remember the
[1:04:07] story about this uh bomb Oh homeless man
[1:04:12] homeless man is what it was and uh
[1:04:14] somehow he got hit by a car and the
[1:04:18] injuries were really severe
[1:04:21] all the doctors and everything and they
[1:04:22] looked at him and the doctors began to
[1:04:24] talk within themselves not knowing that
[1:04:26] the man was awake and says well you know
[1:04:28] he's just a bomb and he ain't he ain't
[1:04:30] worth nothing he ain't worth nothing he
[1:04:32] he hasn't contributed anything to
[1:04:34] society you know they were really down
[1:04:36] and the man did not know didn't know
[1:04:38] that the man was a lie and the man
[1:04:41] somehow mustered up enough strength
[1:04:43] turned over his listen I'm worth
[1:04:45] something
[1:04:48] hallelujah Jesus Christ died for my sins
[1:04:51] I was something who can put a price and
[1:04:56] this my thought who can put a price on
[1:04:58] the blood of Jesus you could there's no
[1:05:01] man no woman no King of Prince a priest
[1:05:06] a pope or bishop amen they could pay the
[1:05:10] value measure up to the value of the
[1:05:14] blood of Jesus hmm what people don't
[1:05:23] understand is that tough your soul is
[1:05:26] worth ten thousand worlds that's right
[1:05:30] and people determine their own destiny
[1:05:33] by their own choosing
[1:05:35] is that right you know you think about
[1:05:38] all what do you say I'm saying this did
[1:05:40] not King decide he made his own decision
[1:05:45] against God but he couldn't help it
[1:05:48] because of the seed that he was
[1:05:50] hallelujah but then you take Abel he was
[1:05:54] a man of grace and mercy lord have mercy
[1:05:56] on me he understood he was worthy of
[1:06:00] death and he needed a way of escape and
[1:06:02] the only way that he could get gained
[1:06:04] this way of escape was to through the
[1:06:07] death of something else
[1:06:10] hallelujah and we saw by revelation that
[1:06:14] that it it needed a lamb his escape was
[1:06:17] a lamb hallelujah innocent creature he
[1:06:20] meant something that was so innocent to
[1:06:23] me that God saw it as being innocent you
[1:06:28] understand me there is a hiding place
[1:06:31] for the righteous I'm jumping because of
[1:06:34] the
[1:06:35] tonight and hopefully I'll be able to
[1:06:36] teach it better but you know my thought
[1:06:39] is that you and I must understand that
[1:06:41] when the when God established these
[1:06:44] cities by way of the law Moses was
[1:06:47] already off the scene but God told
[1:06:50] Joshua says listen you coming into the
[1:06:53] Promised Land
[1:06:54] you coming into the is that right amen
[1:06:57] Canaan was not heaven Canaan was
[1:07:00] symbolic of the Holy Ghost you hadn't
[1:07:03] even fought in the battles until you get
[1:07:04] it
[1:07:05] hallelujah till you cross over the
[1:07:07] Jordan you said what do you mean yes you
[1:07:10] got a cross over Jordan
[1:07:12] Joshua crossed over Jordan and then
[1:07:15] everybody that needed to cross over
[1:07:16] daughter/father Jordan Joshua is that
[1:07:19] right you cannot get into the Promised
[1:07:23] Land
[1:07:23] without a death to yourself Jesus had to
[1:07:27] die in the spiritual way you understand
[1:07:32] me he hasn't died naturally that he may
[1:07:35] open a way into that spiritual lay Oh
[1:07:39] somebody help me and the Bible tells us
[1:07:45] that even even in Hebrew it tells us
[1:07:47] Amen that we have a inka I ain't got the
[1:07:52] soul hallelujah because Jesus had
[1:07:55] already cross over and goes into the
[1:07:58] veil and as Joshua we following Joshua
[1:08:01] we follow Jesus because Jesus is Joshua
[1:08:06] hallelujah and you got a guy in order to
[1:08:10] resurrect a man and that's the problem
[1:08:14] so many people they look at the the
[1:08:17] order of salvation and they come to the
[1:08:20] justification you know like Luther feh
[1:08:22] Luthor you know Luther said the just
[1:08:24] shall live by faith a man that was good
[1:08:27] for his day where she said oh I need to
[1:08:29] be sanctified that was good for his day
[1:08:32] Pentecostal comes up and say well I got
[1:08:34] to have the baptism hallow that was good
[1:08:36] for their day hallelujah but they had
[1:08:38] never gone into the other place we call
[1:08:43] it the Holy of Holies hallelujah
[1:08:48] and see when you go into the Holies of
[1:08:50] Holies you don't come back out you
[1:08:54] understand me
[1:08:55] here they like Giarrusso I'm jumping in
[1:08:58] with a man you gotta realize they meant
[1:09:01] that the Holies of Holies when you're
[1:09:04] baptized over you feel door sealed with
[1:09:06] the Holy Ghost you are entering into a
[1:09:09] different dimension is that right
[1:09:13] oh you've crossed over the seventh and
[1:09:16] now you into eternity which which has no
[1:09:20] days we don't we don't there you know
[1:09:26] I'm thousand years old
[1:09:31] oh when you get born again you move out
[1:09:36] of the seventh into the eighth is that
[1:09:42] okay listen even in the news like this
[1:09:49] songs of Solomon says oh my dog thou art
[1:09:53] the cleft of the rock in the secret
[1:09:58] places of the stairs let me see that
[1:10:00] countenance
[1:10:01] let me hear thy voice for sweet is thy
[1:10:05] voice and the countenance is comely now
[1:10:09] he says in the secret place understand
[1:10:11] that means everybody it's a secret
[1:10:14] everybody don't know where is that
[1:10:18] brother man comes along any ties in the
[1:10:21] pyramid and he tells how those seven
[1:10:23] steps leads into the King's Chamber and
[1:10:27] you and I we can play with this thing
[1:10:29] all we want to but you can't this this
[1:10:36] is the way back home you understand me
[1:10:43] this is a way back home it is the place
[1:10:47] where we were before we got here huh
[1:10:52] this is the way back home and listen if
[1:10:55] you are see the raw of God will make
[1:11:00] this
[1:11:02] happen in you not by power not by might
[1:11:08] but by my spirit says the Lord who you
[1:11:14] gotta escape we don't realize how
[1:11:17] important it is to us to really accept
[1:11:22] Malachi 4 and believe that God sent a
[1:11:24] prophet people don't understand but you
[1:11:27] see without the voice of God it wasn't
[1:11:29] his voice that we're listening to is the
[1:11:32] voice in the voice it is ordained voice
[1:11:37] Peter said God made an entrance this is
[1:11:41] the entrance the denomination's know
[1:11:44] nothing about it
[1:11:45] organizations know nothing about it is
[1:11:47] right there in the book and they don't
[1:11:49] understand it but it is given to the
[1:11:52] elected to know the mysteries of the
[1:11:54] kingdom it is given to us and now you
[1:11:59] don't have to worry he that begun the
[1:12:03] good work in you its faithful to
[1:12:05] complete it

[1:12:54] on my way to the city no sure he had to
[1:12:58] run he had to detective bust up energy
[1:13:02] from somewhere because he realized once
[1:13:05] he got behind the walls he was safe
[1:13:12] think about it
[1:13:15] why because the Avenger of blood was
[1:13:20] after him

[1:13:31] grateful because the all-seeing eye sees
[1:13:36] us he's the judge he's the jury he's the
[1:13:41] attorney

[1:13:54] your lips the Bible said he's a
[1:13:57] discerner of the heart he knows he goes

[1:14:12] preachers they felt like they should be
[1:14:13] the revenger blood caught in the act

[1:14:20] was higher than all of the judges
[1:14:22] greater than all of the preachers
[1:14:24] hallelujah and when he finished the
[1:14:27] court was out the case was dismissed the
[1:14:31] case was dismissed and he says why man

[1:17:57] I'm not only raised I'd be all but I
[1:18:00] raised up the new I raise up those who
[1:18:02] trusted in me because when they hid in
[1:18:06] that word they were faithful in the word
[1:18:08] they stood on the word and now I'm gonna
[1:18:11] stand for them huh whoo Rock of Ages
[1:18:19] cleft for me let me hide myself in thee
[1:18:24] huh but for the man who loves sin that
[1:18:30] man a man who who loved darkness that's
[1:18:33] what the Bible says why people won't
[1:18:34] repent because they love darkness rather
[1:18:36] than light but for that man that says oh
[1:18:39] lord have mercy have mercy on me God I
[1:18:42] didn't intend to do it thought I didn't
[1:18:44] mean to lie I didn't mean to steal
[1:18:46] whatever even my nature got the best of
[1:18:50] me help me Jesus there's always a balm
[1:18:53] in Gilead no wonder David said thou art
[1:19:07] my hiding place and my shield I hope in
[1:19:12] thy word we need to escape and you know
[1:19:19] people look at me say oh I got it you
[1:19:20] know because I shouted I danced I spoke
[1:19:22] in tongues that don't mean a thing God
[1:19:25] needs to see light hallelujah
[1:19:28] is that okay hallelujah we won't we
[1:19:32] don't want to be your grafted vine a
[1:19:34] grafted branch or anything we want to be
[1:19:36] coming from the root

[1:19:41] David hallelujah he's a very live stream
[1:19:44] of David hallelujah and he's our live
[1:19:47] stream what's in the root comes out in
[1:19:49] the branches that's why the Prophet God
[1:19:52] said in Pentecost if they ever put forth
[1:19:55] another branch
[1:19:58] hallelujah
[1:19:59] not these pretenders the real thing but
[1:20:02] you got to cross over hmm
[1:20:05] it's crossing over time see you got to
[1:20:09] understand they they cross over Jordan
[1:20:12] in the worst time in the worst season
[1:20:15] the waters was risen and high and
[1:20:17] everything else y'all know what that
[1:20:19] means that means it was a lot of
[1:20:20] pressure how we gonna get across
[1:20:23] hallelujah huh hey the waters running
[1:20:26] fast and high and lift it up
[1:20:28] God said I'm gonna show you how to do it
[1:20:30] you don't know how to die but this is
[1:20:32] your season to die I don't care how your
[1:20:35] trials are I don't care what your
[1:20:37] travels are even I don't care see like
[1:20:39] though the waters in water represents
[1:20:41] people bringing you all kinds of trouble
[1:20:43] this is your crossing over time said I
[1:20:46] want you to tell you what I'm gonna do
[1:20:48] you let the word go first put the wine
[1:20:51] fires try to lujah then you can put the
[1:20:53] horn then you can shout then you can
[1:20:55] dance hallelujah
[1:20:56] but stay behind the world and they
[1:21:03] crossed over one thing about these
[1:21:06] cities they were provided by God hello
[1:21:12] one thing about these virtues they're
[1:21:17] provided by God somebody help me here
[1:21:19] they're provided by God and guess what
[1:21:25] they were provided by grace you can't
[1:21:30] work this thing God gives it by grace
[1:21:33] the next thing we realize amen
[1:21:36] it's just that God initiates it you know
[1:21:42] instead what I mean God told Moses
[1:21:44] before Joshua was even in income and
[1:21:46] what the cities would be and what they
[1:21:48] were before and where to place them is
[1:21:51] that right I think if I got it correctly
[1:21:53] three cities were placed on the
[1:21:55] mountaintop and three cities was in the
[1:21:57] valley see because even when you're
[1:22:02] Nevada there's a place of refuge
[1:22:04] hallelujah that's what David said though
[1:22:07] I walk through the valley
[1:22:08] the shadow of death I fear no evil this
[1:22:10] God is always there for you and I you
[1:22:14] and me is that right and God provided it
[1:22:18] he made it easy
[1:22:20] did you know wherever these cities were
[1:22:22] when something went wrong in wherever
[1:22:25] you were amen it was easy Lee accept
[1:22:30] accessible they had a road that led to
[1:22:36] the city I'm enjoying myself cuz I just
[1:22:43] said there is a way somebody help me
[1:22:47] here a highway but in that highway there

[1:23:07] I'll give you rest huh
[1:23:10] cast your cares upon him for he cares
[1:23:13] for you

[1:23:18] need to see but you need to get on the
[1:23:19] straight and the narrow right he
[1:23:25] provides it the blood has already been
[1:23:27] shed the road has already been paid it's
[1:23:31] simple we make it complicated because we
[1:23:34] get self in it let go and let God
[1:23:37] hallelujah be that are led by the Spirit
[1:23:41] of God they are the sons of God

[1:28:38] looking at this thing and I want you to
[1:28:40] understand we've got to escape the thing
[1:28:42] about it is that they were available to
[1:28:44] all they were accessible to all is that
[1:28:49] right
[1:28:51] they were prominent like I said built on
[1:28:54] a mountaintop for what for all to see so
[1:28:58] you were able to see it wherever you
[1:29:01] were you ran you got on that road to it
[1:29:04] and you could see it you you saw your yo

[1:29:24] always open you know the gate was always
[1:29:26] open you had people there who were
[1:29:28] always looking for the offenders you
[1:29:32] know I'm saying you know just think
[1:29:34] about it if a man you running from
[1:29:36] someone and and and and and you know say
[1:29:39] that reaches at the gate and I'm and the
[1:29:41] man is right behind me and rich just

[1:29:55] running you'll find out there's somebody
[1:29:57] right look is that okay
[1:30:00] it's the truth they were always looking
[1:30:05] for offenders you know that was their
[1:30:08] job when you see Amen somebody giving it
[1:30:14] heart to the Lord
[1:30:15] we don't see the invisible but the Bible
[1:30:19] said angels in camp about those who fear
[1:30:21] God angel the Lord who you think Amen
[1:30:27] telling you don't do that that's your
[1:30:30] theophany that's God has the power to
[1:30:41] secure you it has the power 8-minute
[1:30:43] like I said and been built on top of
[1:30:45] mountain so you can see it they were
[1:30:47] what they were constantly looking for
[1:30:49] offenders to come the role was not
[1:30:51] called the gates were never closed and
[1:30:54] the direction was never confused
[1:30:58] everybody knew where the cities of
[1:31:01] refuge were
[1:31:03] brought up as a child hello that's why
[1:31:07] children need to know who Jesus is from
[1:31:11] childhood they need to know and then
[1:31:13] there's a place there's a way to escape
[1:31:15] this world now I'm gonna go through
[1:31:21] these names quickly somebody buddy said
[1:31:26] brother books you don't have a right to
[1:31:27] do that all I know is what God told me I
[1:31:29] had a Jubilee time the first one was
[1:31:34] Kadish and each name each city had a
[1:31:39] name and each name had a meaning Kadish
[1:31:45] mean righteousness Sikkim mean showdown
[1:31:50] Hebron means fellowship right so you if
[1:31:55] you did wrong you had a city of
[1:31:56] righteousness you could run to that all
[1:32:00] right if you need God to bear you up
[1:32:02] like a sheep to shepherd bare the sheep
[1:32:05] on his shoulder y'all hear me hallelujah
[1:32:09] chicken was your place if he believed
[1:32:13] you needed fellowship Hebron was
[1:32:17] Fellowship dezer be easy ER mid fortress
[1:32:22] and know one thing to come with a
[1:32:23] scripture to show you that all of these
[1:32:26] cities were types and shadows of the
[1:32:29] attributes of God as a savior as a
[1:32:33] healer as a deliverer hallelujah rame up
[1:32:37] means Heights huh search searching know
[1:32:42] the breadth the height and the death hmm
[1:32:46] go long with joy you there's a city for
[1:32:52] you now that's just six of them list it
[1:32:57] because that was natural Israel right
[1:33:01] that was the time when Israel needed
[1:33:03] somewhere to run when they made mistakes
[1:33:06] like killing and murder or whatever you
[1:33:08] want to call it but you see now
[1:33:11] Jerusalem because of what Israel did at
[1:33:14] the crucifixion of Jesus they be
[1:33:17] murderers and they've suffered because
[1:33:23] they've been had no place to run and no
[1:33:25] place to hide no matter search the
[1:33:28] history no matter where the Jews went
[1:33:31] they were persecuted before Stalin and
[1:33:34] Hitler came they had a hard time because
[1:33:37] they said let his blood be on us and our
[1:33:39] children so all of their children were
[1:33:42] guilty of what they'd committed and so
[1:33:46] therefore they were they were dealt with
[1:33:49] it and God had the blood of vengeance
[1:33:52] that's why people hated the Jews no
[1:33:53] matter where they would go I think was
[1:33:57] uh which was Wesley the one that that
[1:34:00] looted one of the ones that didn't have
[1:34:02] a revelation who I have to call the Jews
[1:34:05] Antichrist actually but see that city
[1:34:09] Jerusalem supposed to be a city of peace
[1:34:12] but since they've been there all they
[1:34:15] had was bars but still they're now
[1:34:17] building a wall a place of refuge it's
[1:34:26] in this future that I don't have time to
[1:34:27] go go through it but I'll continue it
[1:34:30] Sunday evening and we realized by God's
[1:34:33] grace still there's war still they died
[1:34:36] priest dying everything that was the old
[1:34:40] Jerusalem but that ain't the final one
[1:34:44] you got seven days and brother Brennan
[1:34:49] said it's like seven Church ages but
[1:34:54] there is a mystical age there's another
[1:34:56] one it's in there but you got to look
[1:35:00] for it and it has to be revealed to you
[1:35:04] because we didn't know that there was an
[1:35:06] eighth day somewhere but the Bible says
[1:35:09] it Leviticus calls it and then the holy
[1:35:12] convocation that means there's another
[1:35:16] place how are we gonna hide people you
[1:35:22] and I must realize him and this whole
[1:35:24] world is getting ready to go up and
[1:35:26] frame we don't have an ark like Noah
[1:35:31] we don't have nothing to cross over I
[1:35:33] don't care if you got a a spacestation
[1:35:36] the Bible said the heaven and earth is
[1:35:39] gonna be set on fire where is my place
[1:35:42] of refuge is that right come unto me all
[1:35:47] ye that are late and heavy laden and
[1:35:50] I'll give you rest
[1:35:52] is that right Solomon said he's a hiding
[1:35:56] place he's a secret place everybody
[1:35:58] can't see it like Cain couldn't see his
[1:36:02] refuge everybody can't see their refuge
[1:36:06] they think science is their refuge
[1:36:10] hallelujah
[1:36:11] but there is a hiding place there is a
[1:36:14] refuge is that true organization stop
[1:36:18] that I refuse my organization that's the
[1:36:21] same way Israel thought when when Titus
[1:36:25] and the rest time came they thought
[1:36:26] because I'm a Jew Jerusalem is my place
[1:36:29] and this is a holy city this is the holy
[1:36:32] denomination God started this
[1:36:35] denomination and they didn't even
[1:36:36] realize that God had departed they had
[1:36:39] become a kebab because God had departed
[1:36:42] because of their transgressions
[1:36:45] hallelujah and they closed themselves up
[1:36:48] in the wall and guess what they all died
[1:36:50] there they ended up eating each other's
[1:36:53] children and everything else and then
[1:36:55] when Titus McGann finish with them the
[1:36:57] Bible said the blood was flowing from
[1:36:59] the how horses brow they fail to see as
[1:37:07] a nation where their hiding place was
[1:37:09] but there was one thing hallelujah that
[1:37:12] caught the vision two thieves on the
[1:37:14] cross hallelujah
[1:37:16] the one thief he ridiculed like Oh
[1:37:19] Israel oh cars Jesus hallelujah but
[1:37:22] there's one who was ordained who knew
[1:37:26] amen that this man is a special man I
[1:37:29] love to say it like this
[1:37:30] here he was standing there and they're
[1:37:33] hanging down on the cross he knew he was
[1:37:35] guilty for something in him men knew he
[1:37:37] didn't mean to do it he got caught up in
[1:37:40] his sins hallelujah but he says now
[1:37:42] inspired
[1:37:43] it's nobody's fault but my own
[1:37:46] hallelujah but this man is the innocent
[1:37:48] lamb this man is innocent hallelujah and
[1:37:52] they had written there the King of the
[1:37:54] Jews I love this revelation he said King
[1:37:58] of the Jews
[1:37:59] he says I'm a Jew that means he's my
[1:38:01] king and guess what is his love me me me
[1:38:10] this is what Jesus said this day you
[1:38:13] shall enter into the kingdom hallelujah
[1:38:16] you will be with me in paradise this day
[1:38:19] what was it he knocked on the door and
[1:38:22] Jesus opened it it was no hard words all
[1:38:27] he had to do is accept that Jesus Christ
[1:38:29] was to save you know somebody had mercy
[1:38:33] and God opened the door wide open for
[1:38:35] word hmm if you believe this message in
[1:38:40] the simplicity God will open the white
[1:38:43] door wide open to you all you got to do
[1:38:46] is believe that the door is open for you
[1:38:49] hallelujah
[1:38:50] is that right oh listen but this ain't
[1:38:55] all hallelujah when we escaped when we
[1:39:02] were born and birth into Christ
[1:39:05] there was another City because you got
[1:39:08] to understand that the only City the
[1:39:11] real city is Jerusalem not the natural
[1:39:15] one the one that God builds hallelujah
[1:39:19] you got to understand him and we're not
[1:39:21] look listen if Jerusalem was the place I
[1:39:24] needed to be I bought me a ticket and go
[1:39:27] just now hallelujah if that was my
[1:39:31] hiding place huh oh come on somebody but
[1:39:35] listen there's another Jerusalem they
[1:39:38] meant for everybody it's only meant for
[1:39:40] those who's elected and God has
[1:39:43] justified and so they never seen in the
[1:39:45] first place guilty as charged amen but
[1:39:48] we've escaped hallelujah why because the
[1:39:51] jury the judge the attorney all of them
[1:39:54] were the same

[1:44:21] and God made it made it happen did you

[1:44:27] not Christ three times Amen is now to
[1:44:30] preach on a Pentecost and on the day of
[1:44:32] Pentecost but God had to move him out
[1:44:34] the way he had too much of Peter he had
[1:44:38] too much of him and man he thought it
[1:44:40] was this and that he thought he could
[1:44:41] handle it and God wiped him out
[1:44:43] God had never been able to use Paul with
[1:44:45] nothing he wouldn't never been useful to
[1:44:48] God if God would have just took him in
