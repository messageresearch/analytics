[39:57] amen there is no other fountain that I

[40:17] [Music]
[40:22] it's all this blood that can take you
[40:24] from a sinner to a saint
[40:29] it's only just blood that can transform
[40:32] you
[40:32] [Music]
[40:33] man because he has the power of
[40:36] transformation
[40:39] [Music]
[40:41] we're so happy to be here
[40:44] we just pray that we're just asking you
[40:47] pray for us this morning
[40:52] let's let's go straight to the word
[40:55] open our bubbles in the book of Saint
[40:58] John chapter 14.
[41:02] we read the verse 13 too
[41:09] in my Saint John Chapter 14 verse 13 to
[41:12] verse 20.
[41:24] foreign
[41:32] that's better all right the Bible says
[41:36] and whatsoever you shall ask my name
[41:40] that will I do it
[41:43] that that the father may be glorified in
[41:46] the sun it does
[41:51] if you shall ask anything in my name I
[41:54] will do it
[41:57] if you love me keep my Commandments
[42:00] now verse 16 uh from verse 16 to verse
[42:04] 20 that's uh really what we'll be
[42:06] talking about this morning
[42:10] and the Bible says that and I will pray
[42:14] the father and you shall give you
[42:16] another comforter
[42:18] that he may abide with you forever
[42:25] [Music]
[42:28] amen so if you read this scripture alone
[42:32] you will think like there is three
[42:34] different people
[42:40] you'll see that Jesus was talking to
[42:42] them who was the son of who was the son
[42:44] of God
[42:50] well ask the father who is another
[42:53] person
[42:55] and the father will send you a comforter
[42:58] who is also another person
[43:03] so this you know this when you read this
[43:07] without any understanding of the Prophet
[43:09] that's what you will think that those
[43:11] three different people in God
[43:18] Amen so now in verse 17 that Jesus
[43:21] continues and he says that even the
[43:23] spirit of Truth whom the word cannot
[43:26] receive because it seeth him not neither
[43:30] nor was him
[43:32] uh
[43:39] so now here Jesus now he's clarifying
[43:42] what he said in verse 16 he says that
[43:44] but you know him
[43:46] for he dwelleth with you is
[43:53] amen here Jesus is talking about the
[43:56] present tense he dwells with you so he's
[43:58] dwelling with you right now
[44:02] the spirit of the truth
[44:05] and then he said that and that same
[44:07] Spirit of the truth that is dwelling
[44:09] with you shall be in you it is
[44:15] talking about that comforter
[44:18] and I will and I will not leave you
[44:21] comfortless
[44:23] and I will come with you I will come to
[44:26] you
[44:27] amen now he's no longer talking about
[44:30] the father but he's using the personal
[44:32] pronoun I is
[44:37] meaning that the father Son and the Holy
[44:40] Spirit it's all one God
[44:51] now verse verse 19 the Bible says that
[44:54] he had a little while and the word seeth
[44:57] me no more by ye see me because I leave
[44:59] and you shall live also University
[45:06] [Music]
[45:08] at that day you shall know that I am in
[45:12] my father and ye in me and I in you
[45:17] soon
[45:18] [Music]
[45:21] amen that's the perfect Fellowship this
[45:24] is
[45:31] Lord just to say thank you foreign Lord
[45:35] we pray father God that you help us Lord
[45:39] and you speak to us Lord
[45:41] me as a man Lord I don't know anything
[45:46] I might try to understand is scripture
[45:48] but if you if you are not in there
[45:50] though Jesus is just nothing components
[45:55] why Lord Jesus I pray father Lord that
[45:58] you take me out of the way Lord
[46:00] and you speak to your people put your
[46:03] balance on purpose Lord I just want to
[46:05] be father God the way that you will use
[46:07] father God to speak to us this morning
[46:11] Lord I just want to be a vessel that you
[46:13] would use this morning so that's why I
[46:16] pray for the Lord that you helped me to
[46:18] be so sensible to the holy spirit
[46:21] so that I can say exactly what you want
[46:24] me to say this is exactly
[46:26] thank you for everything
[46:28] Lord those who are looking for the Holy
[46:31] Spirit Lord let's just pray father God
[46:33] that you fill them up
[46:36] those who have needs of Father God that
[46:39] just pray for the Lord that you be their
[46:40] providers
[46:43] Lord in everything father Wanna Give You
[46:46] Thank
[46:58] uh this morning for
[47:01] um
[47:02] this morning I have a we have a little
[47:05] subject that we wanted to share with you
[47:06] is
[47:10] entirely I will be with you even in you
[47:17] amen
[47:19] it's a word that Jesus himself used in
[47:22] the Bible
[47:24] I'm trying to find the verse where I
[47:27] used it but I can't find he said that I
[47:29] will be with you even in you
[47:34] amen if we can read again the uh John
[47:37] Chapter 14 verse 16 to 20.
[47:44] and I will pray the father and he shall
[47:47] give you another comforter that he may
[47:49] abide with you forever
[47:56] even the spirit of Truth whom the world
[47:59] cannot receive because he seeth him not
[48:02] now either knoweth him but ye know him
[48:05] for he dwells with you and shall be in
[48:08] you
[48:09] know
[48:17] and I will not leave your comfort lives
[48:20] I will come to you
[48:23] amen that's a great that's a that's a
[48:26] great promise to lean
[48:28] once you know that Jesus will never
[48:30] leave us alone he will always be with us
[48:34] he had a little while and the world
[48:37] seeth me no more by ye see me because I
[48:40] live and you shall live also
[48:46] [Music]
[48:47] at that day you shall know that I am in
[48:51] my father and ye in me and I in you
[48:59] amen I will not leave you
[49:07] amen you will be with me inside I will
[49:10] be inside of you leading you and taking
[49:12] control of your body
[49:16] that's a promise that we can lean once
[49:19] we can't put all all our strength in
[49:22] that promise all our hopes in that
[49:24] promise
[49:27] to know that God will never leave us
[49:30] it doesn't matter how dark the day is
[49:38] that in the Old Testament God gave that
[49:40] promise to all of to uh uh the prophets
[49:43] and all the the Warriors
[49:48] amen he gave that promise to Moses
[49:52] that Moses I will be with you
[49:56] if you're reading Exodus chapter 3 verse
[49:59] 11 or 12.
[50:02] Moses talking with God when God was
[50:06] telling him to go back to Egypt
[50:09] now verse 11 of chapter three the Bible
[50:12] says that and Moses said unto God who am
[50:15] I that I should go on to pharaoh and
[50:18] that I should bring forth the children
[50:19] of Israel out of Egypt
[50:22] versions
[50:25] [Music]
[50:28] amen Moses look at himself as a human
[50:31] person as a human being
[50:34] amen he looked at his abilities
[50:38] lord I can't even talk properly
[50:42] Lord I Fleet when when Pharaoh want to
[50:45] kill the man and Pharaoh try to kill me
[50:47] Lord I ran away
[50:50] so who am I to go back again to go back
[50:54] but before that pharaoh and take your
[50:56] people out of Egypt
[50:59] so now verse 12 the Bible said
[51:08] certainly I will be with thee and and
[51:12] this shall be a token unto thee that I
[51:15] have sent thee when thou has brought
[51:18] forth the people out of Egypt You Shall
[51:20] Serve God upon this mountain
[51:23] twice
[51:31] Amen in other words Moses is not by your
[51:34] strengths
[51:38] but I will be there with you
[51:41] amen I will be with thee in every step
[51:45] of the way I will always be there
[51:48] amen when you feel the troubles when You
[51:51] Face difficult time call on to me I will
[51:53] be there
[51:56] when Pharaoh would try to kill you you
[51:59] just call call upon me and then I will
[52:01] be there
[52:04] man you just call out my name and I will
[52:07] be there
[52:08] because I am the one giving you the
[52:11] promise foreign
[54:09] I'll always be with me foreign
[55:11] well I meant to people that was crazy
[55:15] amen they've never heard about a flood
[55:18] before
[55:20] those instruments and they went up there
[55:23] and they're trying to check you know how
[55:24] the weather is I mean everything was
[55:26] fine
[55:31] wishing that there is a flood that's
[55:33] coming
[55:36] amen no one knew exactly what he was
[55:39] preaching because he heard it directly
[55:40] from the Lord
[55:44] but those people they thought that that
[55:47] was a bunch of nonsense message
[55:53] well there is nothing I mean we never
[55:56] even seen even a rain if it's never been
[55:58] raining or anything like that yeah
[56:01] but now you're talking about the flood
[56:03] foreign
[56:11] food
[58:07] were different
[58:18] uh someone who has been emptied out is
[58:27] representing uh uh someone who the

[58:34] verse 26.
[58:39] amen that would represent somebody with
[58:41] a new heart and a new spirit
[58:46] amen that would represent somebody that
[58:49] God has given him a new heart and a new
[58:51] spirit
[58:55] amen because a new heart and a new

[59:20] in order for you to become pliable by
[59:23] God
[59:24] Amen in order for you to become easily
[59:26] maneuvered by God
[59:30] for word
[59:32] because you will notice that God told
[59:34] Noah to pitch their word from within to
[59:37] within and without that's good
[59:44] because in itself that would wouldn't do
[59:48] the work

[1:00:01] he said that that is the believer
[1:00:05] once in the hands of God
[1:00:09] got down from from his own
[1:00:11] self-righteousness of the tree
[1:00:18] amen he becomes pliable in the hands of
[1:00:21] the builders
[1:00:26] with every wind of Doctrine
[1:00:29] is
[1:00:32] pliable that fits right into the word of
[1:00:36] God to be used easily
[1:00:42] amen that is that wood that God that is
[1:00:45] why God chose their wood
[1:00:49] Amen to show that amen that he had to
[1:00:53] feel their wood with that that that
[1:00:55] pitch he had to pitch it
[1:00:59] amen and you notice that how God told
[1:01:01] Noah to build the ark it was
[1:01:09] three different levels
[1:01:12] amen the first one second and the third
[1:01:15] the community amen and then he told him

[1:01:32] window up in the side of the Ark Junior
[1:01:34] Batman
[1:01:37] God never showed him to put that window
[1:01:39] in front of the ark or in the back of
[1:01:41] the Ark Junior part Monte foreign
[1:02:20] those were animals living in those two
[1:02:23] levels
[1:02:24] amen but Noah and his family was on the
[1:02:28] third level
[1:02:29] amen they were living there but I mean
[1:02:32] there in the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:02:34] amen and then on top of them that window
[1:02:37] was there letting the light of the Lord
[1:02:39] shine
[1:02:43] a Christian
[1:02:45] amen that you have to go through those
[1:02:48] steps
[1:02:52] amen you have to go through
[1:02:54] sanctification
[1:02:55] you have to reach the baptism on the
[1:02:58] holy
[1:02:59] amen and the light of the Lord will
[1:03:01] shine upon you
[1:03:02] and the God Amen who was with them in
[1:03:06] the Old Testament amen
[1:03:09] God will come and start living inside of

[1:03:14] will be with you

[1:04:18] another it is
[1:04:20] which was different from us
[1:04:23] that was cut down in his young life
[1:04:29] amen and and he was bruised and beaten
