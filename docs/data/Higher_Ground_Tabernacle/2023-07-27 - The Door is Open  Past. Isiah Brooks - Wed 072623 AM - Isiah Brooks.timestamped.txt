[29:06] God bless you this evening glad to see
[29:08] everybody out here this evening
[29:10] as we stand let us just turn to Saint
[29:13] John 14.
[29:15] we'll be reading the 20 and the 21st
[29:18] verse
[29:23] and then we'll go to Revelations 10 9-11
[29:29] John 14 20-21
[29:38] at that day
[29:40] ye shall know that I am in my father
[29:45] and ye in me
[29:48] and I in you amen
[29:52] Revelations 10
[29:56] beginning at the ninth verse
[30:02] and I went unto the angel and said unto
[30:05] him
[30:06] give me the little book
[30:10] and he said unto me take it and eat it
[30:13] up
[30:14] and it shall make thy belly bitter but
[30:17] it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey
[30:21] and I took the little book
[30:24] out of the Angel's hand and ate it up
[30:28] and it was in my mouth sweet as honey
[30:32] and as soon as I had eaten it
[30:35] had eaten it my belly was bitter
[30:39] and he said unto me thou must prophesy
[30:42] again before many people
[30:46] and Nations
[30:47] and tongues and Kings let us pray
[30:57] our heavenly father we
[31:00] come before you Lord Jesus as humbly as
[31:02] we know how
[31:04] thank you Father God for tonight thank
[31:06] you for the Precious Blood of your dear
[31:09] son Jesus Christ that washes away all of
[31:13] our sins
[31:14] father it is because of him we could
[31:16] stand tonight amen resting on your mercy
[31:20] and your grace
[31:21] and father we pray like to pray tonight
[31:24] that you bless each and every heart
[31:26] here tonight in Jesus Christ's name we
[31:28] pray amen you may be seated
[31:32] I could feel a little tiredness in the
[31:34] service
[31:35] so we'll try our best not to be very
[31:38] long
[31:39] but I I can't help but to think about
[31:44] what God has done in this day
[31:47] I want to keep it focused I want to keep
[31:49] it in my heart I want to keep it in my
[31:51] mind I don't want it to slip away from
[31:54] me
[31:55] I don't want this message to become
[31:57] common to me I wanted to be a lie
[32:01] you know it's it's just uh you know I
[32:04] wanted to be real every day
[32:07] and so I know in order to keep that
[32:11] alive I must also fellowship with him
[32:14] every day I can't wait to the weekend or
[32:18] wait till Wednesday come to fellowship
[32:20] with him it must be a daily routine that
[32:23] my God and I meet together Fellowship
[32:27] together talk together uh in so doing I
[32:30] would be able to follow his leadership
[32:33] my my subject is come on in
[32:37] the door is opened
[32:40] and you know I was just reading the word
[32:43] and you know brother Branham tells us
[32:45] that the Book of Revelation is a book of
[32:48] symbols and um to really understand that
[32:51] if you would read Ezekiel you'll know
[32:54] that a lot of those things are symbolic
[32:58] that things that are because the writer
[33:01] or the the you know or the the vision
[33:03] that's given can only be explained in a
[33:06] certain way and according and God used
[33:09] human mentality sometimes to describe
[33:12] things uh but he uses that so that it
[33:16] can remain a mystery it literally closes
[33:18] the book
[33:20] um so I want to say that you know we
[33:23] when we talk about the book when we talk
[33:25] about the door when we talk about the
[33:27] bread when we talk about the water those
[33:30] uh things are symbolic uh of of of of of
[33:33] Christ
[33:35] because Jesus said in in in in in in the
[33:37] word of God he said I am that bread of
[33:40] life amen uh and and we know that in in
[33:43] John 10 9 he says I am the door
[33:47] amen that's right Amen in John 14 6 he
[33:52] says I am the way the truth and the life
[33:55] amen right amen he's the author and
[34:00] finisher of our faith according to the
[34:02] word of God and he says I am the word
[34:05] right in John 1 1. and will you and I
[34:10] must understand amen that everything
[34:12] about the Bible spells out the Lord
[34:15] Jesus Christ
[34:17] amen it's all about God it's all about
[34:20] his Redemption plan it's all about his
[34:23] love affair with the bride
[34:26] I get excited because when you think
[34:29] about Genesis how Genesis starts off
[34:32] with you know Adam and then Adam was
[34:35] lonely and then God blesses Adam with a
[34:38] bride that comes right out of him right
[34:41] that's right it's satisfy Adam and then
[34:45] we know according to the prophet's
[34:47] message that God himself
[34:49] amen could not be satisfied until he
[34:53] receive his own bride right we we
[34:57] basically take the loneliness if that's
[34:59] possible because he's got Angels up
[35:01] there he's got seraphims up there he's
[35:04] got all kinds of creatures up there but
[35:07] he wanted his bride there think about
[35:10] this book we're talking about amen it
[35:14] starts off with a love affair between
[35:15] Adam and Eve and of course that was
[35:17] marred it was a shadow in the type of
[35:19] God's love affair with his bride is that
[35:22] right like you've heard me say you don't
[35:25] know somebody loves you or how much they
[35:27] love you until they break a covenant or
[35:30] they offend you in a way Attica said now
[35:33] look Eve I love you I love you I love
[35:35] you but as long as there was no
[35:38] transgression
[35:39] he had no idea what that love was until
[35:43] transgression came and we found out that
[35:47] he was willing to give his life amen for
[35:50] his bride Hallelujah and in the same
[35:54] manner Christ died for us the Bible said
[35:57] if that while we were yet sinners Christ
[36:00] died for us amen hallelujah yes sir and
[36:06] the Bible says according to you know
[36:08] Colossians 2 and 8. we know he's Elohim
[36:11] and the Bible said in him
[36:14] dwell is the fullness of the godhead
[36:17] bodily so when we saw Jesus we saw God
[36:22] in his fullness all of the attributes of
[36:25] God was in Jesus Christ is that right
[36:29] and the Bible said in that day you'll
[36:32] know that I am in the Father the
[36:35] father's in me and I am in you is that
[36:38] right so we understand by the grace of
[36:41] God Amen that that that that God is love
[36:44] and and the Bible said he that have my
[36:47] Commandments and keepeth them he it is
[36:50] that loveth me y'all understand what I'm
[36:53] saying because you can do things for
[36:56] people only because of out of works but
[37:00] when when when is love it's a different
[37:03] type of thing right I mean look at the
[37:06] people that literally serve God out of
[37:09] fear
[37:10] with those people that serve God out of
[37:12] fear I mean really uh their works are in
[37:15] vain because he made a statement he said
[37:18] if you love me keep my Commandments
[37:21] that's right the love of God must be in
[37:24] your heart amen amen in order for your
[37:26] Works to be accepted
[37:28] is that right listen the Bible called
[37:31] the Rich Young Ruler like I said the
[37:33] other day the Rich Young Ruler and the
[37:36] Rich Young Ruler was loved by God
[37:39] but he still went to hell he did
[37:41] everything according to the law
[37:44] right but one thing he didn't do he he
[37:48] loved his Earthly possessions more than
[37:51] he loved God more than he loved eternal
[37:54] life is that right because we understand
[37:56] Jesus Christ was the only one that could
[37:59] give eternal life
[38:01] now when we see the book
[38:03] of Revelation and we've heard this so
[38:06] many times you are what you eat
[38:09] right so this message is not given to us
[38:13] just to memorize it's it's given to us
[38:17] to digest Amen to receive it and to
[38:21] digest it and to become it amen right so
[38:25] we understand is that right I mean it's
[38:28] amazing uh uh that that even brother
[38:31] Branham said that the word of God is our
[38:33] vitamins
[38:35] right it is our nutrition it is the
[38:37] thing that keeps us healthy amen so when
[38:41] we look at these things we must
[38:43] understand that the Bible is not for us
[38:46] to just look at it and observe it
[38:49] uh it's good to understand you know the
[38:52] dates and times
[38:54] but that's not what God is looking for
[38:56] in this hour God is looking for
[38:59] individuals who love him so much
[39:02] that he that they surrender their lives
[39:05] to him that they can become him
[39:09] he's looking for individuals that can
[39:12] come unto him in such a way that he
[39:15] could bring a birth
[39:17] in them that will be his offspring amen
[39:21] this is what God is looking for he's
[39:24] looking for little jesuses or little
[39:27] crisis says however you want to say it
[39:31] this is what God is looking for now
[39:35] when the word of God came and he says
[39:37] take it and eat it
[39:39] right and I wonder how often people
[39:42] literally take the word and eat it
[39:45] you know we may practice you know
[39:48] reading it well I read this book and I
[39:50] read that but it's all right that's good
[39:52] but there are many people who have read
[39:55] the Bible through and through maybe
[39:57] several times know all the history
[40:00] behind it but never received it in other
[40:04] words it how do you know when you're
[40:06] receiving the word because when you
[40:09] receive the word it brings changes in
[40:12] your life
[40:13] right it brings faith in your life it
[40:18] brings love in your life it brings a
[40:21] respect for God that you would normally
[40:24] not have
[40:25] amen is that right right come on in and
[40:28] I'm gonna say it like this I'm gonna
[40:30] keep saying it
[40:31] because Jesus says on the door
[40:34] and he says listen I'm knocking at the
[40:37] door of your heart if any man would open
[40:39] he said I would come in and suck
[40:43] right so it's just it's not just opening
[40:46] your mind to the message but it's it's
[40:49] literally inviting Christ in amen
[40:52] remember he preached the message doors
[40:55] and doors he said it's not good enough
[40:57] just to say hey come on in but stop in
[41:00] the living room oh stop in the kitchen
[41:02] he wants to go into the intimate part
[41:06] amen hallelujah because that's what he
[41:09] wants he wants intimacy with his bride
[41:13] Hallelujah glory to God like Revelations
[41:17] 3 and 8 says he is the door what you
[41:20] mean it is an open door to the believer
[41:23] now when I say open door that means the
[41:26] revelation of Christ is give being given
[41:30] out to those who want it those who can
[41:33] receive it he said I'm the only one that
[41:36] can open it and I'm the only one that
[41:38] can shut it y'all remember that remember
[41:41] when the word of God said the door was
[41:43] open and you say Well when in Matthew 25
[41:46] when five wise and five foolish were
[41:49] called at midnight well just find out
[41:52] that the Five Wives went into the
[41:54] marriage supper of the lamb but there's
[41:57] a time when the five foolish was shut
[42:00] out yes
[42:01] and they came knocking open up the door
[42:04] but it was too late and brother Branham
[42:07] says that when they asked the wise God
[42:10] virgins to give us of your oil they said
[42:13] to the foolish you go pray up
[42:17] yeah Amen brother Brandon was a I tell
[42:19] you like this God in Simplicity has
[42:22] given you the answer
[42:24] to all the questions how can I make a
[42:27] rapture you go pray up is that right so
[42:32] in Revelation 10 8 the book is open
[42:36] and he holds it in his right hand
[42:39] and the Bible said the angel said uh
[42:42] it's to John you know take it and John
[42:46] went and took the book and that wasn't
[42:48] all it wasn't like okay I received the
[42:51] message he says no sir I want you to eat
[42:53] it
[42:54] Hallelujah y'all hear what I'm saying
[42:57] and it's no strange thing because that's
[43:00] what happened even in the book of of
[43:03] Exodus when the lamb was slain they had
[43:06] to eat the lamb yes right so the book
[43:10] The Bloody lamb and the book that was
[43:13] open is the same
[43:15] God yes it's the same person amen but
[43:18] just in book form that's why brother
[43:21] Brandon talks about the message being
[43:23] the bloody bleeding word of the Lamb
[43:25] it's one and the same the same person
[43:28] but in order to make the actions he said
[43:31] you've got to eat it all up you got to
[43:34] eat the good you got to eat the bad you
[43:37] got to eat the bitter whatever's in
[43:39] there eat it all up he said don't leave
[43:42] nothing
[43:44] hey man come on in God want to have
[43:47] supper time
[43:48] he want to have a time of dining with
[43:50] you is that right it's like on the road
[43:53] to Emmaus when those disciples
[43:57] sat down with Jesus they had no idea who
[44:01] he was he was hiding himself and yet the
[44:05] word of God Amen was what being revealed
[44:08] to them what was it the book was being
[44:11] open yes the Jesus Christ had risen amen
[44:15] the seventh seal of that that moment was
[44:18] being opened to them and he went and he
[44:21] he preached to them started with the
[44:23] prophets from Genesis all the way up to
[44:25] that time showing what how Christ
[44:29] must suffer and die amen he was the lamb
[44:33] for the sins of the world Hallelujah
[44:37] even in this last day when the seals
[44:40] were open what did we see a bloody lamb
[44:43] as though he had been slain from the
[44:46] foundation of the world
[44:48] same land was Jesus Christ
[44:50] Hallelujah and you've heard me preach
[44:53] this before he was a lamb bloody amen
[44:57] and and and and sacrificial lamb but he
[45:00] was the one who defeated Lucifer the
[45:04] dragon yes
[45:06] Hallelujah
[45:08] ferocious about a lamb
[45:10] the lamb is Meek the lamb is humble but
[45:15] this lamb knew how to be led by the
[45:19] father
[45:20] amen because he said I can't do nothing
[45:22] except the father showed me amen is that
[45:25] right I'm in the Father the father's in
[45:27] me I am in you and the bride won't move
[45:31] until she get a thus said the Lord she
[45:34] knows how to be led by the lamb she is a
[45:38] lamb and she knows that Jesus Christ is
[45:41] a great Shepherd amen y'all hear me it's
[45:44] open the revelation of the word is there
[45:47] for us to understand it amen if you read
[45:51] the word of God and you get three Gods
[45:53] then your Revelation is wrong amen if
[45:56] you get two Gods your Revelation is
[45:59] wrong there's only one God Amen and that
[46:02] one God said unto Israel oh here ye o
[46:04] Israel the Lord thy God is one
[46:07] Hallelujah is that right so that's what
[46:11] they even the disciples um the Jews
[46:13] couldn't understand Jesus according to
[46:15] Saint John 10 30. when he said I and my
[46:19] father one think about it even when he
[46:22] told Philip and and the others he said
[46:24] how could it be when you see me you see
[46:27] the father is that right listen this is
[46:29] the way we want God we want God so much
[46:32] in us that when people see us they see
[46:36] the father they see Jesus they
[46:39] understand amen that there's something
[46:41] different about us not because we come
[46:44] to Higher Ground Tabernacle but because
[46:47] we've met the Lord on the backside of
[46:50] the desert
[46:53] brother random
[46:54] was talking
[46:57] about how
[46:58] the Lord in his ministry proved that
[47:01] Jesus Christ was alive and well did you
[47:04] know that that even in your life as as
[47:07] as Believers you must prove to the world
[47:10] that Jesus Christ is alive and well
[47:13] anything about your dressing because
[47:16] more people there are people out there
[47:18] that live dress more Godly than we do
[47:20] sure right it ain't that it's your
[47:24] character amen it's the Christ character
[47:27] in you amen that people will recognize
[47:31] and when they recognize that they see
[47:34] Jesus himself amen right but the only
[47:37] way that you're going to be able to do
[47:40] this is that that word become you and
[47:42] you become the word amen hallelujah it's
[47:45] a union going on but the problem said
[47:48] it's a very invisible Union
[47:50] Hallelujah and that's what we're looking
[47:53] at amen that God oh I got a good I got a
[47:56] good one I got a good quote coming but
[47:58] God would take a little vessel like us
[48:01] unbroken up and messed up and whatever
[48:04] in all kinds of ways and put us back
[48:06] together again in the sanctifiers fill
[48:08] us with the Holy Ghost and you know he
[48:10] doesn't stop there he began to build
[48:12] character in us change us from glory to
[48:15] Glory Hallelujah but in order for that
[48:18] to happen you've got to step into that
[48:21] book
[48:22] amen hallelujah though pages of the book
[48:25] must live
[48:26] and it must live through you yes yes
[48:29] right amen amen here's the message
[48:31] here's uh what president spoke in at the
[48:34] ex physician of the seven show changes
[48:36] he said he was talking to a Hammond and
[48:38] woman he was telling them how Jesus
[48:40] Christ is the same and he says now if I
[48:42] can prove to you and show you that that
[48:45] same Jesus as he promised us that he
[48:48] would do signs and wonders and miracles
[48:50] if I could prove that to you would you
[48:52] then become a Christian and this woman
[48:54] responded Yes he said she said he said
[48:58] she says I accept Jesus as my savior
[49:01] that did it right she was healed and
[49:06] about ten thousand inhabitants came to
[49:09] Christ that day because the gospel was
[49:11] preached in both word and power amen
[49:15] amen God never told a man to labor 30
[49:18] years and harvest nothing he gave us the
[49:22] open door of the word and Power
[49:26] y'all understand me this dog do we talk
[49:29] about Christ himself the word himself
[49:32] must be word and power amen and that is
[49:37] what we are supposed to use
[49:40] amen that is what what gave Paul is
[49:43] great and effective Ministry First
[49:46] Corinthians 2. 4 and my speech and my
[49:51] preaching was not with enticing words of
[49:53] man's Wisdom but demonstration of the
[49:56] spirit and the power you see this is
[49:58] what the bride is about it's not about
[50:01] sitting in church being preached to and
[50:04] you receiving it intellectually when the
[50:06] word comes let me tell you something I
[50:08] really
[50:09] Lima Ohio
[50:13] and as I preach the word of God people
[50:15] who were seeking the Holy Ghost received
[50:17] it I didn't have to lay hands on them
[50:20] but the Holy Ghost fell and they
[50:23] received the Holy Ghost and this still
[50:25] standing the day
[50:27] that's what I'm talking about the
[50:30] atmosphere must be energized Hallelujah
[50:34] it must be fire and you and I must bring
[50:37] our fire with us because when the
[50:40] atmosphere is on fire the Holy Ghost
[50:43] will step in
[50:45] Hallelujah
[50:47] that's exactly right I'll never forget
[50:50] my daughter said to me one day when she
[50:54] was really young she said Daddy I know
[50:59] why God showed up in the fire
[51:02] when it came to
[51:04] Shadrach Meshach and Abednego
[51:06] I said why honey
[51:08] she said when they heated it up seven
[51:11] times
[51:13] God could step in the fire and be
[51:16] comfortable
[51:17] [Laughter]
[51:23] a mediocre thing we've been giving him
[51:26] God God was excitement he you know it's
[51:29] the truth brother Brown said we come to
[51:32] church to entertain him not to be
[51:35] entertained we come to entertain him
[51:39] Hallelujah I'll be honest with you I was
[51:43] driving home the other day with my wife
[51:46] and we was listening to some music and
[51:49] all of a sudden she had to pull over and
[51:50] go
[51:51] to and it was Christian music
[51:53] we had to go pull over and and get
[51:55] something and she came back and she said
[51:57] can you cut that off she says that's
[51:59] putting me to sleep
[52:03] kind of a music we need anointed music
[52:07] Now understand me people of God you are
[52:11] the one that anoints him when the
[52:14] anointing is in you you anointer the
[52:16] singing is that right the anointing
[52:19] flows out of you Hallelujah Oh Glory
[52:22] right listen and I tried to tell people
[52:26] I don't care if it's a hymn if it's a
[52:28] hymn if you sing it from the soul your
[52:30] soul and anoint that ah that him will
[52:34] become something different to you
[52:36] Hallelujah glory to God right
[52:41] coming from the message Exposition again
[52:44] he said he never told them to go into
[52:47] the world and establish Bible colleges
[52:50] nor did he tell them to pass out
[52:52] literature and we're good at it we'll
[52:55] pass out all Brethren's material yeah
[53:02] they need to see life now let me say it
[53:06] like this you can pray for a person all
[53:09] day and if they don't believe nothing
[53:11] will happen that's right the word is
[53:13] given to he'll believe us to deliver
[53:16] believe us
[53:18] to say believe us amen Jesus couldn't do
[53:22] men Mighty Miracles especially around
[53:25] his hometown that's right can any good
[53:27] thing come out of Nazareth he couldn't
[53:29] do nothing because they were unbelievers
[53:31] Hallelujah
[53:34] y'all understand me even in this church
[53:37] nothing can be done if the people don't
[53:40] believe
[53:41] amen you got to believe
[53:43] that's right that's the only way God is
[53:45] going to move that's right you got to
[53:47] believe
[53:48] that's right amen even when it came to
[53:51] Tabitha amen what did Jesus do he put
[53:54] them all out all the unbelievers get out
[53:57] why he didn't want a negative atmosphere
[54:00] amen and neither do I I want to see God
[54:04] in the positive not the negative amen
[54:06] forget what you went through today
[54:08] forget all your trials forget all your
[54:12] failures Hallelujah we need to worship
[54:15] God tonight and thank him for our life
[54:17] health and strength
[54:19] Hallelujah give him the glory that's due
[54:23] to him
[54:24] sir did you know even in the Old
[54:27] Testament you couldn't come before a
[54:30] king with a sad continent that was all
[54:33] automatic death
[54:35] thank God for his mercy and Grace
[54:37] [Music]
[54:39] brother I hope I'm not going too fast
[54:40] brother Isaac I hope they're getting it
[54:42] to you
[54:44] so
[54:45] you know because I get a chance I get I
[54:47] get stirred I get going and sometimes I
[54:50] forget we got an interpreter
[54:52] Hallelujah anyway
[54:56] and when I you know I'm Southern
[54:58] so I preach to you in a southern English
[55:01] sometimes
[55:02] it's not British
[55:04] so you'll not understand me sometime
[55:06] forgive me okay you know when you need
[55:11] me to slow up just throw your hand up or
[55:13] something do me do something there so
[55:15] you catch my attention
[55:18] my wifey back there like
[55:21] so anyway help me out now those things
[55:25] are fine
[55:26] but Jesus told them to do what was to
[55:30] preach the gospel
[55:32] stick with the word
[55:34] and then the signs will follow
[55:37] the very introduction we have in the way
[55:40] the kingdom of God was to preach was to
[55:43] be preached
[55:45] was when he sent out 12 12 Matthew 10
[55:50] 1-8 he commissioned and instructed them
[55:53] on this wise and when he had called unto
[55:57] him to him his 12 disciples he gave them
[56:00] power against unclean spirits to cast
[56:04] out and to heal all man of sickness in
[56:08] all manner of diseases y'all understand
[56:11] me so what am I saying we can call
[56:13] ourselves a message or we want to but
[56:16] the Bible said these signs shall follow
[56:18] them that believe now if that makes you
[56:21] Pentecostal you ought to say hallelujah
[56:24] anyhow
[56:25] amen because I've told message Brothers
[56:27] I said you better be careful yes yes how
[56:30] you say Pentecostal because if you say
[56:32] it in a negative way you could be
[56:34] blasphemed in the Holy Ghost God never
[56:37] took that away from us he literally
[56:39] Advanced us he took us higher but we're
[56:44] to never get rid of the joy that when
[56:47] the Holy Ghost fell on you never get rid
[56:51] of the joy never let the devil take your
[56:54] praise
[56:56] Hallelujah
[56:58] yeah I don't care what they do in
[57:00] America I'm concerned about what they do
[57:02] in heaven
[57:03] the Bible say they worship God all the
[57:05] time Hallelujah they don't have no
[57:08] breaks brother it's always holy holy
[57:11] holy and we don't know what all they're
[57:13] singing but one thing for certain they
[57:15] don't get tired
[57:17] we get tired because we got these
[57:19] old-fleshy bodies but up there they've
[57:21] got the theophany bodies up there they
[57:24] don't get tired you know like I told you
[57:26] before they don't even breathe that's
[57:28] right they don't eat
[57:29] don't eat they don't breathe
[57:31] [Applause]
[57:34] thank you they don't give out of breath
[57:36] so they can hold they can hold a note as
[57:39] long as they want to
[57:43] and it'll still be beautiful right but
[57:46] listen I'm gonna read this for you
[57:49] Hebrews 2 because I think that's what
[57:51] has happened one through eleven
[57:55] therefore
[57:56] Paul is saying we ought to give the more
[57:59] Earnest heed to the things we which we
[58:03] have heard
[58:04] lest at any time we should let them slip
[58:09] yeah but if the word is spoken by Angels
[58:13] were steadfast
[58:14] and every transgression and Disobedience
[58:17] receive a just recompense of reward
[58:20] how should we escape
[58:22] if we neglect so great salvation
[58:26] ah messy people Believers in the Malachi
[58:30] form Believers in Revelation 10 7. come
[58:33] on how are we going to escape if we
[58:37] neglect so greater salvation which at
[58:40] the first begin to be spoken of the Lord
[58:43] and was confirmed unto us by them that
[58:46] heard him amen God also bearing them
[58:51] witness both with signs and wonders and
[58:54] with divers Miracles and Gifts of the
[58:56] Holy Ghost according to his own will
[58:59] amen let me show you something
[59:07] you've seen me do this before
[59:09] but I'm gonna do it again tonight
[59:12] one thing about these bottles of water
[59:15] they're the same
[59:17] Jesus says I'm the alpha and omega
[59:21] right amen and we were taught in school
[59:25] we had to see the difference
[59:28] I mean you could have three wagons
[59:31] two of them read and one blue
[59:35] and the teacher would say Circle or draw
[59:37] the line to those two that are the same
[59:42] well you're not they may be same in
[59:44] every aspect except the color
[59:47] and that color makes a difference
[59:50] right because it's blue it's not equal
[59:53] to the red
[59:55] only the red one you draw a line to
[59:59] yeah because it's the same
[1:00:01] these two bottles are the same
[1:00:04] right
[1:00:07] I'm talking about something here
[1:00:09] because the early church
[1:00:13] in the latter Church
[1:00:15] must be the same amen
[1:00:18] Hallelujah did you know brother Brown
[1:00:21] said Ephesus had all of the gifts
[1:00:25] they even had all of the qualities the
[1:00:28] the statue you see because Ephesus was
[1:00:31] the original scene that's right amen and
[1:00:34] they couldn't lack anything The Original
[1:00:36] Seed had to be the fullness of Christ
[1:00:37] amen but the Rapture couldn't take place
[1:00:41] until the after church
[1:00:44] that's right come on the scene amen amen
[1:00:46] right but in order for the alpha Church
[1:00:48] to come on the scene the Omega Church
[1:00:51] had to be planted that's right it had to
[1:00:53] die it had to rot amen and then come up
[1:00:56] through the church ages and this last
[1:00:59] Church must be like the alpha Church
[1:01:02] y'all hear what I'm saying now this
[1:01:05] water now now if I ask you which is the
[1:01:08] difference I put off oh they look the
[1:01:10] same the same brand everything on but
[1:01:12] you see this one is different because it
[1:01:14] doesn't have as much water
[1:01:16] is not the same yeah
[1:01:18] yeah y'all understand what I'm saying
[1:01:19] and this is why brother Balon says
[1:01:22] listen if we compared ourselves to the
[1:01:25] the Pentecostal Church on the zusu
[1:01:27] street he said we look nothing like it
[1:01:31] go look it up
[1:01:32] we don't resemble it
[1:01:34] that's not right something is wrong amen
[1:01:39] amen but I believe this message right
[1:01:41] now is working on a people to translate
[1:01:43] them
[1:01:45] amen hallelujah we can't let it slip we
[1:01:50] can't listen this is an individual walk
[1:01:52] and I'm trying to tell you you can't
[1:01:54] worry and look at whatever thing oh
[1:01:56] their Message Church their message
[1:01:58] church and we're just divided as anybody
[1:02:00] else
[1:02:01] sure now I'm being honest
[1:02:03] but the word is still the word that's
[1:02:05] right amen stay with what brother
[1:02:07] Branham said and you'll be all right
[1:02:11] say he brought everything that right
[1:02:14] from the word the urum of Durham the
[1:02:16] Bible amen he said that was his quote
[1:02:19] book yes
[1:02:21] Hallelujah you love the Lord amen
[1:02:24] amen now what is man that thou art
[1:02:26] mindful of him
[1:02:27] you know the scripture goes on and said
[1:02:29] you make him Lord just just Lord a
[1:02:31] little lower than the angels say but we
[1:02:34] don't see everything that's put under
[1:02:35] his feet but the Bible said according to
[1:02:37] the ninth verse but we see Jesus who's
[1:02:40] made little a little lower than the
[1:02:42] angels for the suffering of death crown
[1:02:45] with Glory and Honor that he by the
[1:02:49] grace of God should take touch taste
[1:02:51] death for every man amen amen I was
[1:02:56] thinking about that today and I says
[1:02:57] Lord I said this message is so real to
[1:03:00] me because no matter nobody likes to
[1:03:03] fall nobody likes to make a mistake you
[1:03:05] know none of us like getting upset or
[1:03:07] anything like that but the grace of God
[1:03:10] covers you
[1:03:12] right and you know what God didn't save
[1:03:15] you not knowing that you were going to
[1:03:18] do all of the things you've done he knew
[1:03:21] that yes
[1:03:23] just like he told Peter you're going to
[1:03:25] die me three I did not mean three times
[1:03:27] but it did not hinder the position that
[1:03:31] God had appointed for Peter before the
[1:03:34] foundation of the world Amen
[1:03:37] nothing can Dethrone the bride that's
[1:03:41] right you better hear what I'm saying
[1:03:43] nothing can Dethrone the Bride of Jesus
[1:03:47] Christ
[1:03:48] God has already set your seed in heaven
[1:03:52] your seat your chair your throne is
[1:03:56] waiting for you it doesn't matter what
[1:03:59] we do here that's right none of us like
[1:04:02] to sin but if we do the Bible said we
[1:04:05] have an advocate amen we have Jesus
[1:04:08] Christ Our Lord we have the blood of
[1:04:12] Jesus Christ Hallelujah who washes us
[1:04:15] and cleanses us
[1:04:17] from all of our sin we must not forget
[1:04:21] are perfect for being here in this day
[1:04:26] right we mustn't forget see in other
[1:04:29] times the cares of the world and the
[1:04:31] things that happening in the world it's
[1:04:32] all right to know the news and things
[1:04:34] like that I look at it a little bit
[1:04:35] every now and again and I not look at it
[1:04:37] it comes through my apps and stuff but
[1:04:40] my point is it's okay to know those
[1:04:42] things Jesus spokes up some things about
[1:04:43] how those people was killed in the tower
[1:04:46] you know so it's all right but my point
[1:04:48] is this don't allow anything to distract
[1:04:51] you now
[1:04:54] nothing
[1:04:56] is that right
[1:04:58] listen even at the coming of the Lord
[1:05:00] even at the Rapture of the church when
[1:05:02] the foolish versions are the the
[1:05:04] denominational church was marching
[1:05:07] to the rocking
[1:05:10] Rock and come the bride around once
[1:05:11] again and as she was stepping every step
[1:05:15] was Ascension it was taking her Higher
[1:05:19] and Higher and Higher and and we find
[1:05:22] out that those that were at the end
[1:05:24] began to look around we don't need to
[1:05:26] look around
[1:05:27] you don't need to look around keep your
[1:05:30] eyes on Jesus keep your eyes on the
[1:05:34] purpose of God lord I come to be changed
[1:05:38] Hallelujah
[1:05:41] Hebrews 1.
[1:05:43] I'm Excuse me Hebrews 11 5 says
[1:05:46] by faith
[1:05:48] Enoch was translated
[1:05:50] that he should not see death
[1:05:52] and was not found
[1:05:54] because God had translated him for
[1:05:57] before his translation he had this
[1:06:00] testimony that he pleased God
[1:06:03] right come on in
[1:06:07] the book is open
[1:06:08] brother Adam said that that big old
[1:06:11] snowstorm that was hidden the place
[1:06:13] right he said he ran the people down ran
[1:06:16] the other brothers down and he was
[1:06:17] trying to get out himself and then all
[1:06:19] of a sudden a boy said to him
[1:06:22] turn back around go back
[1:06:25] and he says Ah at first I didn't you
[1:06:27] know go back that means my death
[1:06:30] but the voice says go back
[1:06:33] and then brother random realized it was
[1:06:35] God
[1:06:36] thought of this means that's my end I'm
[1:06:38] gonna go back
[1:06:39] then as he went
[1:06:41] and he received God
[1:06:43] the Holy Spirit spoke to him and says
[1:06:46] speak to the storm
[1:06:49] amen amen
[1:06:52] yes sir amen
[1:06:57] speak to the storm
[1:07:02] oh what a son of God
[1:07:04] see that's what God wants in us not that
[1:07:07] we're prophets but he wants that same
[1:07:09] Jesus that he had in US yes amen right
[1:07:13] amen and then afterwards the storm
[1:07:17] stopped
[1:07:18] with its way
[1:07:21] then the boy says
[1:07:23] can I walk with you oh
[1:07:26] Jesus y'all know what I'm saying
[1:07:31] may I walk with you
[1:07:33] and Jesus says oh Lord there is nothing
[1:07:37] greater
[1:07:38] than I would have
[1:07:40] other than for you to walk with me
[1:07:44] but you see he tells the story in
[1:07:47] several places
[1:07:48] now I'm talking about translation here
[1:07:50] I'm talking about God
[1:07:52] opening up a channel
[1:07:54] that's there already but you don't see
[1:07:56] it
[1:07:58] and he says
[1:07:59] he thought I'll go buy meaties
[1:08:03] burial site and just pay tribute to her
[1:08:07] and and he said when he was there
[1:08:10] he saw
[1:08:13] and there she stood in her young self
[1:08:16] and he said he saw himself
[1:08:19] young again
[1:08:21] and she was holding her hands our arms
[1:08:23] out to him
[1:08:26] and he was holding his arms out
[1:08:29] he said something happened I know y'all
[1:08:31] think I'm crazy but listen
[1:08:34] God gave him a
[1:08:36] a glimpse
[1:08:39] of what it is to be translated
[1:08:42] even though his body was still here he
[1:08:45] saw himself
[1:08:48] he saw her
[1:08:54] oh my God that's just something but
[1:08:57] anyway he he moves on with it
[1:09:00] comes down the mountain and finds out
[1:09:02] that God stopped the storm
[1:09:05] [Music]
[1:09:07] but God put
[1:09:11] amen not only did God Amen through him
[1:09:15] stop the storm
[1:09:17] but God gave him a vision of his wife
[1:09:20] oh my God Amen
[1:09:23] listen I'm telling y'all something the
[1:09:26] closer you get to God the more you see
[1:09:28] amen
[1:09:30] is that right I mean even brother Brown
[1:09:33] said God will take you places yeah
[1:09:35] that's it he said that amen he'll take
[1:09:38] you places and
[1:09:42] he'll tell you something the Rapture is
[1:09:43] not a group revelation
[1:09:46] the Rapture is an individual Revelation
[1:09:50] amen and brother Adam said it it was
[1:09:53] Enoch's Revelation nobody else's that's
[1:09:57] right amen and Enoch taught the bride
[1:10:01] now we find out
[1:10:03] and the message lay of the sin Church
[1:10:05] age
[1:10:05] he said now we found out that Elijah
[1:10:08] must mean this age to this church
[1:10:13] to prove that if it was Elijah Elijah
[1:10:17] after he had give his prophecy
[1:10:20] did not have to die he was translated
[1:10:24] and was taken up into heaven a type of
[1:10:27] the church at the end of this Elijah
[1:10:31] that will come at the end of his time
[1:10:34] the church will go in the rapture
[1:10:39] without going through the shadows of
[1:10:41] death amen wait a minute did he say that
[1:10:44] yes he did
[1:10:46] it'll be the rapture
[1:10:48] I believe the great Elijah the great one
[1:10:51] that's to come will be the anointed
[1:10:53] Elijah that will prophesied for the last
[1:10:56] days amen amen now he's using that you
[1:11:00] know like a third or second person but
[1:11:01] he's talking about himself
[1:11:04] he was the Elijah amen right so we know
[1:11:07] that the power that this this open book
[1:11:10] or this this word open brings the power
[1:11:13] of the word in you
[1:11:17] amen
[1:11:20] it brings the power of the word in you
[1:11:24] right and that that power is what to
[1:11:28] transform as well as to translate you
[1:11:32] amen it is the resurrection power and
[1:11:36] authority of the word amen this ain't no
[1:11:39] just denominational thing this is a
[1:11:41] message that will change you but if you
[1:11:44] don't eat it up amen You Gotta Eat It
[1:11:47] that's the only way it gets down and
[1:11:50] changes you like natural food if you
[1:11:54] have the food on the outside it'll never
[1:11:56] change you right but you got to take it
[1:11:59] in and when you take it in it breaks
[1:12:02] down and changes you amen that's right
[1:12:05] it gives you strength strength right
[1:12:10] so potentially
[1:12:12] it's in here
[1:12:14] and what is it
[1:12:16] the word promised before the foundation
[1:12:18] the world see what we we feel to see
[1:12:20] this is the mystery that's been hidden
[1:12:24] throughout all the ages from Genesis up
[1:12:28] to now the mystery of God revealed amen
[1:12:32] hallelujah when the bride herself
[1:12:35] receives portions of the godhead amen
[1:12:39] amen
[1:12:40] yes she does she becomes Queen he is the
[1:12:46] king
[1:12:47] right you say oh bring it scripturally
[1:12:50] when Elsa became Queen yes the king
[1:12:53] asked said unto her I give you half the
[1:12:57] kingdom that's right right and she was
[1:13:00] the one in Authority that put the devil
[1:13:03] in the Lake of Fire
[1:13:05] that killed Haman and all of his
[1:13:09] children got rid of all the Devils
[1:13:12] Hallelujah and that's who we are
[1:13:16] at the name of Jesus every Niche about
[1:13:20] every tongue shall confess and one of
[1:13:24] these old days they're going to kneel to
[1:13:26] Jesus and his bride and they're going to
[1:13:29] testify you were right we were wrong
[1:13:33] Hallelujah and the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:13:36] will be the one judging the world
[1:13:40] Hallelujah this is who you are amen
[1:13:44] don't forget your purpose this is who
[1:13:47] you are
[1:13:49] Hallelujah press into it press into it
[1:13:54] don't let nothing distract you right now
[1:13:57] Hallelujah
[1:13:59] glory to God listen
[1:14:01] the word promise for the foundation of
[1:14:03] the world
[1:14:05] and around there is only reflects the
[1:14:08] negative that will reflect the positive
[1:14:11] the word see and the same thing is the
[1:14:14] translation of the Bride will be the
[1:14:17] same thing the word that's in you
[1:14:20] okay right the body will materialize
[1:14:24] around the word
[1:14:27] and the same thing did by Sarah
[1:14:31] because she had the word inside the word
[1:14:36] materialized around Sarah and the next
[1:14:39] thing you know she was turning Young
[1:14:45] [Music]
[1:14:46] it was a word it was Christ in Sarah
[1:14:51] literally creating a new body in her and
[1:14:55] that's what the word does now the Living
[1:14:58] Word that we're speeding on the matter
[1:15:00] we live is that right that's the Bible
[1:15:03] amen amen
[1:15:06] then all we have to do is just stay in
[1:15:08] the atmosphere
[1:15:10] like Aaron's Rod just stay in the
[1:15:13] atmosphere the life behind the curtain
[1:15:17] Hallelujah the life behind us so bad the
[1:15:21] skin is the one that changes you amen Oh
[1:15:25] Yes But You Gotta Have It
[1:15:27] right yes listen to two paragraph 250 he
[1:15:30] says when the when that old body that
[1:15:33] she had that first body it had to be
[1:15:36] changed in order to produce a son you
[1:15:40] get it that body could not do it this
[1:15:44] body cannot do it so it'll have to be
[1:15:48] changed the same way to receive the son
[1:15:51] how will it take place and when and
[1:15:54] where is the bride goes it it it goes to
[1:15:58] glory amen Heavenly heaven for the
[1:16:01] wedding supper just in type like Isaac
[1:16:04] and Rebecca when Rebecca went to meet
[1:16:07] Isaac remember elieza representing now
[1:16:11] the message that went forth from Abraham
[1:16:14] and elaesar went forth to find what a
[1:16:17] bride for Christ or for Isaac he found
[1:16:20] the beautiful Rebecca in the cool of the
[1:16:22] evening a little dark-skinned girl
[1:16:25] coming out with the water pot on her and
[1:16:29] Eli elieza prayed and said Lord God give
[1:16:32] me good journey now and success for my
[1:16:36] master Abraham and he said go go he said
[1:16:40] go don't take him amongst the
[1:16:43] Philistines don't don't take her get
[1:16:47] over here amongst his people
[1:16:50] showing that the bride of Christ
[1:16:53] Christ is blood relation right
[1:16:57] oh my God
[1:17:00] see you you you he can't marry him until
[1:17:02] you have a DNA change God has to change
[1:17:06] your DNA all right and so they went down
[1:17:10] in this beautiful Rebecca came out and
[1:17:13] got the water part and he prayed and and
[1:17:16] water the the camels and whatever more
[1:17:20] see you notice Rebecca had the final
[1:17:23] Choice she had to to come to Rebecca
[1:17:26] you know I I heard brother random say
[1:17:28] this and I had to listen to this message
[1:17:30] I can't tell you how many times
[1:17:33] but brother Bradham said and you can go
[1:17:35] look it up I'm not may not say it
[1:17:37] exactly like he said it but look it up
[1:17:39] in in
[1:17:40] [Music]
[1:17:40] um
[1:17:41] Christ The Mystery of God revealed he
[1:17:43] said if you re if you believe this
[1:17:45] message he said that is the new birth
[1:17:47] yeah
[1:17:49] amen see what you say you got to be born
[1:17:52] again well he's trying to tell you that
[1:17:55] you got to be born again into this
[1:17:57] message
[1:17:58] when you receive the message that you
[1:18:01] must have an experience
[1:18:05] deep deeper than what you had in
[1:18:07] Pentecost
[1:18:08] and you know what I'm saying it can't
[1:18:11] just remain in the in the inner court
[1:18:13] it's got to go into the holies of holies
[1:18:16] that's where the real birth goes and you
[1:18:19] see what what we don't understand is the
[1:18:22] Pentecostal and all the other people
[1:18:23] they don't have the revelation of the
[1:18:25] word like we do because they they have
[1:18:27] the spirit and in the place of the soul
[1:18:30] but the Bible doesn't say the spirit
[1:18:32] that sin shall surely die the Bible said
[1:18:34] the soul that sinned shall surely die
[1:18:37] amen
[1:18:39] it's all right in the word listen and
[1:18:43] Rebecca and as long as they work with
[1:18:45] the spirit they'll never see the soul
[1:18:47] it's hidden from them they don't know
[1:18:50] they need to go further
[1:18:55] Rebecca had to that's why their lives
[1:18:57] are going out
[1:18:58] that's why you see what's happening I
[1:19:00] thought to myself I I looked at a
[1:19:02] Pentecostal Church shouting and dancing
[1:19:04] and the other day and I'm like Oh my God
[1:19:07] look at all of that and the word says
[1:19:09] they're dead
[1:19:12] that's right they don't even know it
[1:19:14] they're dead
[1:19:17] with all of that
[1:19:20] they have rejected the message of the
[1:19:22] hour amen and so therefore they're dead
[1:19:27] you might
[1:19:31] have come out election is greater than
[1:19:34] Grace
[1:19:35] did y'all know that because you can have
[1:19:39] Grace all your life but if you're not
[1:19:41] elected to be bride
[1:19:44] it does nothing for you but when you're
[1:19:48] elected to be bride Grace is your
[1:19:51] inheritance amen hallelujah no weapon
[1:19:55] formed against you shall prosper
[1:19:57] Hallelujah
[1:20:01] and as soon as it was as soon as it was
[1:20:04] made to her quickly her mind was made up
[1:20:08] see that's what I try to tell people and
[1:20:10] nobody gave me the revelation of this
[1:20:12] message but Jesus Christ himself
[1:20:20] that's bad when you got to watch that
[1:20:22] talk back to you
[1:20:25] I don't understand no Revelation yeah
[1:20:29] y'all listening to my conversation
[1:20:32] because she don't understand
[1:20:35] but anyway let's go on see that's why I
[1:20:37] say you can't do nothing they know
[1:20:39] everything
[1:20:42] but anyway
[1:20:44] she made up her mind and this is what
[1:20:46] I'm saying
[1:20:48] you know you got something
[1:20:50] maybe you're not where you're supposed
[1:20:52] to be but you believe this message with
[1:20:55] all your heart that's Christ
[1:20:57] that's God in you and he that begun the
[1:21:01] good work in you is faithful to complete
[1:21:06] it amen he's going to complete it yes
[1:21:09] sir Hallelujah never doubt that
[1:21:11] [Music]
[1:21:12] event
[1:21:14] amen
[1:21:15] see at the end of the day I want to hear
[1:21:18] well done
[1:21:20] you know you know I walk with God
[1:21:23] and the Bible tells us amen that
[1:21:25] you know he was he had a testimony
[1:21:29] let me move on because time is getting
[1:21:31] late
[1:21:32] see the mystery of the seventh seal is
[1:21:35] the coming of the Lord and the body
[1:21:37] changed for the bride
[1:21:40] right
[1:21:41] because the the mystery was you know he
[1:21:45] came to Abraham and the next time he
[1:21:47] came to Sarah
[1:21:49] you know the bride the church and she
[1:21:51] was impregnated so what were you saying
[1:21:54] Sodom and gomar knew nothing about what
[1:21:56] was going on
[1:21:58] people out there don't
[1:22:01] know this is not given to them
[1:22:03] right it's given to a special class of
[1:22:06] people like the prophet said
[1:22:08] right so what it what what is it now now
[1:22:11] it is the most it is the most secret of
[1:22:14] all things
[1:22:15] the translation of the Bride will be
[1:22:18] given to her at the time most needed I
[1:22:21] mean I typed that in right it's like all
[1:22:24] things pertaining to God will be a
[1:22:26] personal revelation as it was to Enoch
[1:22:31] now when you say well what do you mean I
[1:22:34] I said there were two translations that
[1:22:36] we know of more than two but let me just
[1:22:38] say in the Old Testament There Was
[1:22:40] Elijah
[1:22:42] and there was Enoch right is that right
[1:22:45] Enoch type the bride nor type
[1:22:47] tribulation period but I'm sorry Enoch
[1:22:49] type the bride and of course Elijah amen
[1:22:52] type the bride but when it comes to Noah
[1:22:54] Noah type what the tribulation period
[1:22:57] right but Enoch the Bible said Enoch
[1:22:59] live before God 500 years
[1:23:02] right but there was another section
[1:23:05] people said well that's got to be wrong
[1:23:07] brother but I'm saying this that and the
[1:23:08] other but let me say it like this for
[1:23:10] 135 years amen I believe that Enoch was
[1:23:14] in a time of preparation
[1:23:17] training like now it has to go with now
[1:23:22] when the Holy Spirit when the seals were
[1:23:24] open Brother Bear in shortly passed or
[1:23:26] went on but he's here the mighty Angel
[1:23:30] is here and what is he doing he's
[1:23:32] creating his own bride he's literally
[1:23:36] changing her it's a secret nobody knows
[1:23:41] amen nobody knows
[1:23:44] but the individual that God is working
[1:23:47] on
[1:23:48] amen hallelujah glory to God you say
[1:23:51] give me some scripture the Bible says
[1:23:54] according to Psalms 81 and 7 thou call
[1:23:57] is in trouble
[1:23:59] and I delivered thee amen and I answered
[1:24:03] thee in the secret place of danda Amen
[1:24:07] right seven Thunders under their voice
[1:24:11] oh we cried out Lord there's got to be
[1:24:13] more of you and God brought the message
[1:24:16] to us I prove thee at the water of
[1:24:20] Maribeth right the bitter Waters right
[1:24:23] amen we realize by the grace of God
[1:24:25] there is God always doing something when
[1:24:30] God speaks it's a thunder amen that's
[1:24:33] the word right amen now don't don't die

[1:24:50] don't mind me dude right he that
[1:24:52] dwelleth in the secret place of the most
[1:24:54] high

[1:25:33] snares of the fallen and from the
[1:25:36] national and pestilence he shall cover
[1:25:38] thee with his feathers and under his

[1:26:30] been a full-time missionary not working
[1:26:32] anywhere uh different churches were
[1:26:34] helping me in sponsoring me but there
[1:26:36] came a time I felt like I needed to work
[1:26:38] again
[1:26:39] and the Lord told me go choose the place
[1:26:43] go go find where you want to work
[1:26:46] now see prayer if you talk to God he'll
[1:26:48] talk back you know y'all know that we're
[1:26:50] not working with no Idol no you talk to
[1:26:53] him and you don't hear nothing and then

[1:26:57] think he might have said no he speaks
[1:27:01] and and God says no you go you go you go
[1:27:05] find where you work when you will work
[1:27:07] well there's a place near my house not
[1:27:10] far and I went to that place and before
[1:27:13] I went God told me exactly what to wear
[1:27:19] see I don't know I'ma tell you something
[1:27:21] if you have to go apply for a job don't

[1:28:27] my wife said
[1:28:29] you know that you just the place where

[1:29:14] see I just believe like that if I'm a
[1:29:17] son and a daughter of God the Bible said
[1:29:19] you ask what you will and it shall be
[1:29:21] given unto you amen right uh not the
[1:29:25] consuming of Your Love lost I had a need
[1:29:27] for that job for my family
[1:29:30] Hallelujah now I'm almost done just give
[1:29:33] me a few more minutes
[1:29:34] Romans 8 11-15 but if the spirit of him
[1:29:39] that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell
[1:29:42] in you he that raised up Christ from the
[1:29:45] dead shall also Quicken your modern
[1:29:47] bodies by the spirit that dwelleth in
[1:29:50] you
[1:29:50] [Applause]
[1:29:51] therefore brethren we are debtors not to
[1:29:54] the flesh to live after the flesh for if
[1:29:57] we live after the flesh
[1:30:00] but if you through the spirit do modify
[1:30:03] the Deeds of the body ye shall live for
[1:30:07] as many as are led by the spirit of God
[1:30:09] they are the sons of God Amen for ye
[1:30:12] have not received the spirit of bondage
[1:30:14] again to fear
[1:30:19] but ye have received the spirit of
[1:30:22] adoption whereby we cry Abba Father
[1:30:27] and if he's your father act like he is
[1:30:31] that's right
[1:30:33] know that he is by Revelation know that
[1:30:35] he is
[1:30:37] he that comes to God must first believe
[1:30:39] that he is God and that he's a reward of
[1:30:42] them that diligently seek Him amen you
[1:30:44] got to know what you're working with
[1:30:47] I love it I love it I love it I love it
[1:30:50] David only had god with him and look how
[1:30:53] he conquered a giant with God but he
[1:30:56] said in that day you'll know that I'm in
[1:30:58] you
[1:31:00] in me
[1:31:06] it means inflation and I'm gonna tell
[1:31:08] y'all something and I know you're gonna
[1:31:10] think it's crazy I'm I'm no Prophet I'm
[1:31:12] not near a prophet but my wish my wife
[1:31:14] was here to to vindicate that I tell I'm
[1:31:16] telling you the truth I remember more
[1:31:19] than one time maybe twice at the most uh
[1:31:22] my wife and I was coming from Atlanta
[1:31:24] Georgia we lived in South Carolina
[1:31:27] Columbia and we had to drive
[1:31:30] I was so tired God we had a long meeting
[1:31:33] and I was really tired she was tired the
[1:31:35] kids were tired and I how we pray
[1:31:40] but all of a sudden now whether the
[1:31:42] tires are lifted off the pavement or not
[1:31:44] I I wasn't I didn't have a net long
[1:31:46] enough to look but my point is something
[1:31:49] happened in the car and all of a sudden
[1:31:52] a smoothness came over
[1:31:55] and we traveled all the way home in a
[1:31:58] shorter time period than we normally
[1:32:01] would now this happened twice
[1:32:05] y'all hear what I'm saying
[1:32:07] amen now I have been so drunk in this
[1:32:09] Spirit one time more than once but this
[1:32:12] time I was so drunk in the spirit
[1:32:13] brother I was circling the block trying
[1:32:16] to find my way home
[1:32:18] and somebody had to stop me they saw me
[1:32:21] that some of the church members said
[1:32:22] that ain't that brother Brooks wonder
[1:32:24] why he and my sister said he lost
[1:32:29] I was so drunk I didn't know and so they
[1:32:31] had to put me on the right road to get
[1:32:33] me home
[1:32:34] but you see you know it's just what
[1:32:37] happens
[1:32:38] at that same little church
[1:32:41] we had this picture on the wall
[1:32:45] and and a brother uh was preaching he
[1:32:49] would not come down from the cross
[1:32:52] and I don't have that picture but it
[1:32:54] still exists
[1:32:56] that same Cloud on this picture
[1:32:59] literally formed into a lamp
[1:33:03] and it came off it's like it it was it
[1:33:07] bleeded off of the picture and it's so
[1:33:10] Crystal Clear
[1:33:13] I can't explain it all I know is
[1:33:15] Supernatural things do happen
[1:33:18] right
[1:33:22] I remember you why why am I saying these
[1:33:25] things it's because I I know he's real
[1:33:29] I have Supernatural things happening in
[1:33:31] my life but I want everybody to have
[1:33:33] Supernatural things
[1:33:35] it ain't given to just a preacher I'm
[1:33:37] not a pope I'm not a priest
[1:33:41] Supernatural supposed to happen in
[1:33:43] everybody's life amen and listen you
[1:33:45] don't have to try to make it happen the
[1:33:47] Bible said these signs shall follow them
[1:33:50] that believe
[1:33:51] I don't have no more Holy Ghost than you
[1:33:54] have and the same holy ghost that works
[1:33:56] with me will work for you amen
[1:34:03] who is another person translated I'm a
[1:34:05] close because I can't finish this now he
[1:34:07] said listen acts 8 39 let's turn
[1:34:12] and when they would come out of of the
[1:34:14] water the spirit of the lord caught away
[1:34:16] Philip
[1:34:18] that the eunuch saw him no more
[1:34:21] and he went on his way rejoicing can you
[1:34:25] imagine
[1:34:26] he was a man not only just preached
[1:34:30] but baptized the eunuch and shortly
[1:34:33] after that he disappears
[1:34:38] what the eunuch didn't know was that God
[1:34:41] translated him there yeah
[1:34:44] translation can mean being taken to
[1:34:47] another part of the earth or to another
[1:34:49] dimension yeah
[1:34:51] it depends on God's destination point
[1:34:56] it means to be bodily moved from one
[1:34:59] place to another across time and space
[1:35:03] now I got my own little theology on this
[1:35:06] and and I said like this because I've
[1:35:09] been out to Arizona and I've seen the
[1:35:11] mountains that brother Branham had to
[1:35:12] climb I've seen finger points and all of
[1:35:15] that and I'm thinking to myself
[1:35:17] how
[1:35:19] and I've heard stories how brother
[1:35:22] Branham turns up at a meeting and was
[1:35:25] hundreds of miles away
[1:35:27] prior no way he could admit made the
[1:35:31] meeting
[1:35:32] on time
[1:35:34] by traveling by car now I'm just saying
[1:35:37] whether these things be true or not
[1:35:40] I believe personally
[1:35:42] when that squeeze come on
[1:35:45] God is going to allow us to do things in
[1:35:48] the Supernatural yes sir that we never
[1:35:50] thought was possible amen amen right one
[1:35:54] of the things Jesus did he walked
[1:35:57] through the door
[1:36:02] scientifically that that's impossible
[1:36:05] well his resurrection scientifically is
[1:36:08] impossible
[1:36:09] and what's more impossible or seen to be
[1:36:13] impossible scientifically is when you
[1:36:15] had people have been dead thousands of
[1:36:17] years that got up
[1:36:20] right see you can't limit this message
[1:36:24] and you can't limit God Amen
[1:36:28] you can't do it if you do it you either
[1:36:31] be unbelievable yes but the Bible says
[1:36:33] all things are possible
[1:36:36] how many times I've driven a car with no
[1:36:39] gas none
[1:36:42] all things are possible amen somebody
[1:36:44] got to know what I'm talking about
[1:36:47] and the needle says empty
[1:36:51] I'm almost done thank people I know
[1:36:53] you're tired it needs to be bodily moved
[1:36:55] from one place to another across time
[1:36:58] and space
[1:36:59] you literally break all laws of Science
[1:37:02] and logic and probably disappear in one
[1:37:06] place and appear in another
[1:37:09] and you can't tell me that's not
[1:37:10] possible
[1:37:11] because Elijah and Moses was upon the
[1:37:16] mountain
[1:37:17] right and then John was in our day
[1:37:22] right
[1:37:24] and Ezekiel said he took me up about my
[1:37:27] hair into the heavens
[1:37:29] now he took him and you can't breathe up
[1:37:32] there
[1:37:34] I'm just trying to tell you whatever
[1:37:37] you're going through never ever ever
[1:37:41] believe that it's not possible amen I
[1:37:44] don't even like it when people say God
[1:37:46] is able God is more than able he's God
[1:37:49] yeah amen he don't struggle God he's God
[1:37:53] Amen right yes sir all right I'm gonna
[1:37:57] leave that part I'll go to the next part
[1:37:59] the next time but I just
[1:38:01] I just want to say to you the book is
[1:38:03] open
[1:38:04] but you got to eat the book
[1:38:07] you got to take the message lay in the
[1:38:09] presence of the son like the prophet God
[1:38:11] says I was telling her sister the other
[1:38:13] day
[1:38:14] I said even if you don't feel like
[1:38:16] listening listen anyway because it's
[1:38:19] your inner man that's eating that's
[1:38:21] right not your flesh
[1:38:25] it's your inner men that's eating not
[1:38:27] your flesh
[1:38:29] so always play them play them play them
[1:38:31] play them the devil said well you done
[1:38:33] heard that one before you know that's
[1:38:35] the devil telling you that right
[1:38:37] right because I don't have no no problem
[1:38:39] with the eating a second piece of
[1:38:41] chicken or a third piece of chicken but
[1:38:43] you don't have a piece of chicken
[1:38:45] already well I want another piece so
[1:38:47] that's how it is with the word of God
[1:38:49] don't ever get tired of it
[1:38:52] you love the Lord I appreciate your
[1:38:53] coming amen let's stand
[1:38:58] oh gosh
[1:39:01] when we see what God has done for us
[1:39:05] he's done a great thing
[1:39:09] I love the Lord because he's a God that
[1:39:11] cannot change
[1:39:12] and will not change
[1:39:15] friends will change on you
[1:39:17] family will change on you
[1:39:19] but Jesus never change he's the same
[1:39:23] yesterday today and forever
[1:39:25] and I love him I love him I love him
[1:39:29] he said brother Brooks do you devil
[1:39:31] disappoint him I'm sure I do
[1:39:34] but the Bible tells me that his love for
[1:39:36] me is Everlasting and unfailing
[1:39:39] and I'm so grateful for his Mercy
[1:39:41] because his mercy endureth for all
[1:39:43] generations
[1:39:45] I love his Mercy I love his grace most
[1:39:48] of all I love his love
[1:39:51] and my desire to see that fullness of
[1:39:54] that Divine love that Divine love
[1:39:56] just just just
[1:39:58] overshadow me
[1:40:00] feel me
[1:40:02] like David said let my cup run over God
[1:40:06] I just thank you for your goodness
[1:40:09] against stirred Lord I get emotional
[1:40:12] I can't help it
[1:40:14] I see what you're doing and father I
[1:40:17] want to be in tune with your word I want
[1:40:21] to step right with you Lord
[1:40:24] in Jesus Christ's Name Lord
[1:40:26] bear ask this little assembly
[1:40:29] restore the joys of the people Lord
