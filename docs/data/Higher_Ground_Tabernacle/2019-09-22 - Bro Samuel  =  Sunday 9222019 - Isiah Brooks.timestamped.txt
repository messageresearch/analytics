[11:24] opportunity so you could share the word

[11:33] just stand up on her feet so we can read
[11:37] the word you could open our Bibles this
[11:44] 2nd chronicles 7 chapter 14
[11:57] second chronicles chapter 7 verse 14
[12:08] I loved it when brother Isaac was
[12:10] talking about the importance of prayer
[12:11] amen
[12:12] that's the subject we're gonna be
[12:14] talking about you know it is quite an
[12:17] encouragement when you know you're right
[12:19] in the channel with God it's just God
[12:22] confirming his word amen if my people
[12:27] which are called by my name shall humble
[12:30] themselves and pray and seek my face and
[12:34] turn from their wicked ways then will I
[12:37] hear from heaven and will forgive their
[12:40] sin and will heal their land now mine
[12:43] eyes shall be open and mine eyes attend
[12:45] unto the prayer that is made in this
[12:49] place we can take our seat also want to
[12:56] read in James the fifth chapter
[13:10] James chapter 5 verse 13
[13:20] whoever reads is any among you afflicted
[13:23] let him pray is any Mary let him sing
[13:27] sounds he's any sick among you let him
[13:31] call for the elders of the church and
[13:32] let him pray let them pray over him
[13:35] anointing him with oil in the name of
[13:37] the Lord and the prayer of faith shall
[13:40] save the sick and the Lord shall rise
[13:43] raise him up and if he have committed
[13:46] sins they shall be forgiven him amen
[13:50] this morning I want to speak on the
[13:53] subject endowed with a weapon of mass
[13:56] destruction amen that we would want to
[14:01] talk about prayer many times we think
[14:06] that prayer it is just closing our eyes
[14:09] and repeating some words with our eyes
[14:13] closed and repeating those words to God
[14:16] but that is not it many times we are in
[14:20] a hurry you're left with a few minutes
[14:23] and you have to go to work or you have
[14:26] to rush to school then you just know I'm
[14:28] supposed to pray you know you just close
[14:30] your eyes just mumble some words for a
[14:33] few minutes then it's done that is not
[14:36] prayer prayer is a way of communication
[14:39] with God this this is the provided way
[14:43] that God provided on to us for us to be
[14:45] able to speak to him amen
[14:47] it is it is relationship based and we
[14:53] know that a relationship gets stronger
[14:55] the more you communicate amen
[14:57] let's take for an example a man and a
[15:00] woman in love the more you talk the more
[15:05] you converse the closer you get to each
[15:07] other
[15:08] just imagine to those who are married
[15:10] imagine spending the whole day with your
[15:12] wife the whole 24 hours you just speak
[15:15] for two minutes it it cannot work but
[15:20] the more you talk the more you get
[15:23] closer to each other the more connection
[15:25] there is a man and without connection
[15:29] you would you're not able to
[15:32] to have an effective prayer how many
[15:34] times you have prayed and you feel like
[15:38] your prayer hasn't even gone past the
[15:40] ceiling when you know when you know that
[15:43] that connection with God then is not
[15:46] strong you will feel like your prayer
[15:48] has it even gone anywhere but when your
[15:51] connection with God is strong you can
[15:54] tell you have that satisfaction after
[15:56] you finish praying you know that God has
[15:59] heard your prayer and you know that he
[16:01] will answer a man will draw to read arm
[16:06] or the prophecies about what prayer is
[16:11] in the book the supernatural this prayer
[16:15] is not a perhaps prayer is a sincere
[16:18] thing prayer is talking to God prayer is
[16:23] not getting down shut your eyes and
[16:25] think about your washing at your work
[16:27] you're doing say lord help me and John
[16:30] and he'll miss John's and so forth
[16:32] that's not prayer that's just repeating
[16:35] some words but prayer is to come into an
[16:39] atmosphere where you realize that you're
[16:41] in the presence of God and you are
[16:44] moving to then the deepest of sincerity
[16:47] first it's worship or j hovah how I love
[16:52] you you see it then after the worship of
[16:55] prayer then you come with a sincere
[16:56] heart asking a man being in prayer is
[17:00] being in the presence of God hallelujah
[17:04] we're able to tell that you and God you
[17:08] are having a connection between a father
[17:10] and a son or between a father and a
[17:13] daughter and we always want to be
[17:16] soaking in this atmosphere you are not
[17:19] only praying when you have your eyes
[17:20] closed but you can pray while you're
[17:22] walking you can pray while you are
[17:25] driving once you're in that atmosphere
[17:27] where you have that connection that
[17:29] channel between you and God when it is
[17:32] open amen we know prayer it's the most
[17:37] important aspect of our lives in our
[17:40] Christian walk and one time brother
[17:43] Branham was asked how do we grow
[17:45] he said read your Bible and pray
[17:47] everyday you cannot expect to have a
[17:51] relationship with God and you do not
[17:54] pray to Him every day many a times we
[17:57] forget to pray many times we do not pray
[18:01] we just end up going to God when we want
[18:05] something that's what happens many times
[18:08] I don't know if you ever been on a plane
[18:10] and the plane started Rocking everybody
[18:13] gets religious everyone bows down their
[18:16] head and they start praying because they
[18:19] know that's where their help comes from
[18:21] but you're not been talking to God for
[18:23] the past month or so and you're just
[18:25] gonna come and say please help me to do
[18:27] this but you do not have that
[18:29] relationship established and we are told
[18:33] that we can never pray too much we can
[18:37] eat too much we can sleep too much we
[18:41] can do everything else too much but we
[18:44] can never pray too much amen and we are
[18:47] told in the Bible that we should pray
[18:49] without ceasing and prayer is very
[18:53] effective
[18:53] we know that Jesus before he went on the
[18:56] cross in the Garden of Gethsemane he had
[19:00] to go pray he prayed he went to pray
[19:03] three times for more than an hour for
[19:06] him to get the victory for you and I to
[19:08] be saved today he had to go on the cross
[19:11] but before he could go he had to pray to
[19:14] God to give him the courage because as a
[19:17] man he could not do it but he had to
[19:19] pray for God to strengthen him and for
[19:23] them after the first time that's in Luke
[19:25] 24 45 Luke chapter 24 verse 45 he went
[19:30] to to see the disciples as he had told
[19:35] them to to wait for him as he had gone
[19:38] to pray but alas when he came back they
[19:42] were sleeping because of great sorrow
[19:46] but he was in a much more greater sorrow
[19:48] than all of them but he knew how to
[19:51] channel his problems he knew how to
[19:53] channel his troubles and he went to pray
[19:57] his
[19:59] 22:45 says and when he rose up from
[20:02] prayer and was come to his disciples he
[20:05] found them sleeping for sorrow they were
[20:08] so distressed they didn't know what to
[20:11] do the best thing they knew to do was to
[20:13] go sleep many a times we do that when we
[20:17] are stressed you know you think my life
[20:19] is done I don't know how I'm gonna go
[20:21] forward from here the best thing we do
[20:23] is we want to sleep that problem out
[20:26] hoping maybe when I wake up I'll feel
[20:29] better but you haven't changed anything
[20:32] you have just procrastinated the problem
[20:35] here Jesus taught us that when he went
[20:38] to pray we're told that an angel came
[20:41] and strengthened him and he had the
[20:43] strength to be able to go to Calvary so
[20:46] that he could die for you and me now we
[20:49] know we were healed 2,000 years ago
[20:51] because he got the strength to be able
[20:54] to burn through the pain amen and now
[20:56] you and I are saved because of that
[20:59] courage that he had from praying amen
[21:01] and we know that God always answer
[21:05] prayer he just does not listen but we
[21:10] know he listens and he answers we should
[21:14] never doubt our prayer your prayer
[21:18] should be based on faith amen
[21:21] I'll read another quote in here he him
[21:24] he says get the fear away don't be
[21:28] scared that God's not going to answer
[21:30] prayer God always answers prayer the
[21:35] works already finished he is obligated
[21:38] amen he must do it he's got to do it to
[21:42] keep his word notice now it's a finished
[21:46] work it's already finished your job is
[21:48] just to pray because you know God will
[21:51] answer your prayer when you pray amen in
[21:54] Isaiah 55 essays God's Word will not
[21:58] return to Him void but it will return to
[22:01] him after it has fulfilled the purpose
[22:03] which he has spoken it for and he told
[22:05] us in his word he said if my people who
[22:09] are called by my name if they humble
[22:11] themselves and pray
[22:13] says I will hear from heaven and I will
[22:15] heal their land
[22:16] hallelujah so this is God's Word and we
[22:20] know it will not return back to him void
[22:22] when you approach God in prayer you
[22:25] refer him back to his word and you said
[22:27] Lord you said you would hear my prayer
[22:30] and not only here but you said you will
[22:32] answer it so this is the assurance that
[22:35] we know that God will always answer our
[22:38] prayer when we pray amen at a certain
[22:42] point in time God was conversing with
[22:45] Satan and God said have you considered
[22:48] my servant job he said yes and he was
[22:51] the most righteous person in his day
[22:54] and Satan say wait how can he not serve
[22:58] you once after you've given everything
[23:00] that's around him he's got all the
[23:02] comfort that he needs he has everything
[23:05] that he needs how can he not worship you
[23:07] and God says and Satan ask God to go in
[23:12] a flick job and God said yes go ahead
[23:14] just don't touch his life and here we
[23:17] are seeing God
[23:19] grunting Satan the desires of his heart
[23:23] imagine if God could grant the devil the
[23:26] desires of his heart
[23:28] what more about his child this morning
[23:30] amen what more about you and me whom he
[23:34] paid with his precious blood
[23:35] amen and we also read about Hagar the
[23:40] bond woman she was not on the original
[23:44] plan for God forgot to to fulfill his
[23:48] promise with Abraham and after they were
[23:50] chased away Ishmael was was thirsty and
[23:55] then she prayed to God and God opened
[23:58] their eyes so that she could see a well
[23:59] of water and this was not Isaac Amen so
[24:04] if God could do this to outcasts then
[24:07] what more about you and me hallelujah
[24:09] the people that he bought with his
[24:12] precious blood he art and he is
[24:14] obligated to do it for you and me
[24:16] hallelujah and the Prophet talks about
[24:20] this aspect which really excited me you
[24:25] know he says God is
[24:27] not known by knowing genealogy he said
[24:30] it is by neurology hallelujah where God
[24:34] knows you don't find God by studying
[24:37] books you find God on your knees
[24:40] hallelujah we do not go through
[24:45] education - for us to understand God we
[24:50] don't need psychology for us to
[24:52] understand God we don't go to Bible
[24:56] seminaries someone called them
[24:58] cemeteries amen because they kill all
[25:01] the life that's in the word amen but we
[25:04] know that we come to our knees and we
[25:07] pray to God that's how we get stronger
[25:10] in our faith and that's how we
[25:12] strengthen our connection with God when
[25:15] we kneel down in prayer when we
[25:17] communicate to God each and every time
[25:20] Oh God that every time that we do it
[25:22] because we know that when we kneel down
[25:24] that's when we receive our victory our
[25:28] victory is in prayer and we know that we
[25:33] are told that when the weakest Christian
[25:35] kneels down to pray haven't there all
[25:39] the hell's shakes all the pillars or the
[25:42] foundation of Hell shakes so don't worry
[25:46] and you say I'm a weak Christian you say
[25:49] I've never performed a great miracle
[25:51] I've never raised the dead that doesn't
[25:54] matter so long you are a Christian so
[25:57] long you are saved and bought by the
[25:59] blood of Christ you have the ability to
[26:01] shake hell this morning amen
[26:04] there is nothing that can stop you just
[26:06] by the mere vecher of you being a
[26:08] Christian you can shake all the kingdoms
[26:10] of the devil so there is nothing that
[26:12] the devil can cause you and block
[26:15] blessings for you and cause you to do
[26:17] things because you can break everything
[26:19] a man we know in this look at Acts
[26:24] chapter 12 verse 5 it talks about after
[26:27] Peter was imprisoned the church went
[26:32] into prayer and he was changed he was
[26:35] changed to four soldiers and he was
[26:38] logged way in the prison
[26:40] and he didn't know how to get out and
[26:43] all hope was lost in all was gone let's
[26:47] just read her really quick it's chapter
[26:50] 12
[27:11] we see here odd had executed James and
[27:15] he saw that the people were were pleased
[27:18] with it so he wanted to do the same
[27:21] thing with Peter he arrested him cast
[27:23] him into prison and he wanted to execute
[27:25] him reading from Chapter four and when
[27:30] he had apprehended him he put him in
[27:32] prison and delivered him to four cartons
[27:35] of soldiers to keep him intending after
[27:38] Easter to bring him forth to the people
[27:43] Peter therefore was kept in prison but
[27:46] prayer was made without ceasing of the
[27:52] church unto God for him
[27:53] they prayed without ceasing James also
[27:58] tells us that pray without ceasing this
[28:01] is what the church did and many a times
[28:05] what do we do when one of us gets into
[28:07] trouble we do not pray we start talking
[28:11] about one another if you seen this have
[28:14] you seen that but we were told we are to
[28:17] rewrite the book of Acts so we have to
[28:20] do what the original church did amen
[28:23] they came together as a church and they
[28:26] started praying for Peter after he was
[28:28] arrested a man and when Herod have
[28:31] brought him the same night Peter was
[28:33] sleeping between two soldiers bound with
[28:35] two chains the keepers before the door
[28:38] kept the prison and behold the angel of
[28:42] the Lord came upon him and a light
[28:44] shined in the prison and he smoked Peter
[28:46] on the side and raised him up saying I
[28:49] rise up quickly and his chains fell off
[28:52] from his hands and the angel said unto
[28:55] Him gird thyself and bind on their
[28:57] sandals and so he did and he said unto
[29:00] him cos my comment about the end follow
[29:03] me and he went out and followed him and
[29:06] wish not that it was true which was done
[29:08] by the angel but thought he was a vision
[29:10] it was too good to be true when God was
[29:13] now answering the prayers that were
[29:15] being made by the church and when they
[29:18] passed the first and the second Ward
[29:20] they came out to the iron gate that
[29:22] leadeth unto the city which open
[29:24] of to them of his own accord and they
[29:28] went out and passed on through one
[29:30] Street and fought with the angel
[29:32] departed from him all along Peter
[29:35] thought this was a vision it was when
[29:38] God was answering his the prayers that
[29:40] were being made by the church it was too
[29:42] good to be true when you pray to God you
[29:45] will not believe when he starts
[29:47] answering it is just too good to be true
[29:50] and when Peter was come to himself he
[29:52] said now I know of a surety that the
[29:55] Lord has sent his angel and had
[29:57] delivered me out of the hand of Herod
[29:59] and from all the expectation of the
[30:02] people of the Jews and when he had
[30:05] considered the thing he came to the
[30:06] house of Mary the mother of John whose
[30:08] surname was mark where many were
[30:10] gathered together praying this is where
[30:13] the church was praying without ceasing
[30:15] gather and now even at this point in
[30:18] time they were still praying for God to
[30:20] answer their prayer and as Peter knocked
[30:23] at the door of the gate a damsel came to
[30:25] hurricane named Rhoda and when she knew
[30:28] Peters voice she opened not the gate for
[30:30] gladness but raining and told how Peter
[30:33] stood before the gate and they said unto
[30:36] her thou art mad but she constantly
[30:38] affirmed that it was even so then they
[30:40] said no it is his angel but Peter
[30:43] continued knocking and when they opened
[30:45] the door and saw him and they were
[30:47] astonished immediately once the prayer
[30:52] was the church was praying without
[30:53] ceasing God answered their prayer God
[30:57] commissioned an angel to go and to go
[31:01] and act on the prayer that on the
[31:03] request that was being prayed for by the
[31:05] church so a church we need to pray when
[31:09] we come across the situation let us pray
[31:11] we have evidence here that God will
[31:14] Commission his angel for him for our per
[31:18] for our request to be complete amen and
[31:21] it was too good they said no you are
[31:24] crazy that cannot happen
[31:26] they could not even believe their own
[31:28] prayer but this is what was happening
[31:31] when God began answering their prayer
[31:34] because we know he is a prayer answering
[31:37] God that's
[31:38] why the singer said hallelujah he is a
[31:40] prayer answering God when I pray in
[31:43] Jesus name and I know by faith that he
[31:46] will answer amen
[31:48] because we are given this power and we
[31:52] have to utilize this power as much as we
[31:55] can because this power of prayer was
[31:58] given to the disposal of the bride and
[32:00] we have to use it and we know before the
[32:03] man fell everything was subject to him
[32:07] before Adam fell he had dominion over
[32:10] everything but after the fall he lost
[32:14] Dominion and men were living under their
[32:18] privileges for many many thousands of
[32:23] years until the second Adam came and he
[32:26] had to redeem back human race to where
[32:29] it was supposed to be and here he gained
[32:32] back the title deed which had the power
[32:34] which made the man have dominion over
[32:36] nature over everything all things are
[32:40] subject when you pray in God
[32:44] commissioning Mazdas I read and when men
[32:47] and women quit looking at their sickness
[32:49] and diseases and start looking at what
[32:52] God said about you you will take over
[32:55] all things are subject to Jesus Christ
[32:58] and all things are subject to you in
[33:00] prayer
[33:01] some things know does it say some things
[33:05] all things are subject to you in prayer
[33:08] it is up to you to decide the definition
[33:11] of all you are the one who writes what
[33:15] all starts in way all stops you are the
[33:18] one who categorizes what all easy but
[33:22] here it says all things are subject to
[33:24] you in prayer so whatever it is when you
[33:27] pray that situation is subject to you
[33:30] amen when you ask in his name and
[33:34] believe ask what you will in my name and
[33:37] it will be done that's right how do we
[33:39] ask we ask in prayer whatsoever things
[33:43] you desire when you pray believe you
[33:45] receive it you shall have it God said so
[33:48] so let nothing stand in your way
[33:51] stop looking thing at things you are
[33:54] looking at here look at the unseen God
[33:57] said we could do it so if God said I can
[34:01] get whatever I want when I pray there's
[34:03] nothing to stop me but he says I have
[34:06] dominion over everything there is
[34:08] nothing that can stop you because he has
[34:10] given you all the power to do it amen
[34:12] and now we can regain position and we
[34:16] have dominion over everything there is
[34:18] no disease that can stand before you
[34:20] there is no problem or situation that
[34:24] can stand before you because you have
[34:26] been given dominion over everything
[34:28] everything is subject unto you there is
[34:31] no demon that can afflict you there is
[34:33] no demon that has the right to trouble
[34:36] you as a son of God because you have the
[34:38] dominion over everything hallelujah for
[34:41] we know that with prayer this is the
[34:43] most powerful weapon that God plays in
[34:46] the hands of mankind and we know that
[34:48] prayer changes things in expectation
[34:51] what man calls great God caused foolish
[34:54] and what man calls foolish God calls
[34:58] great so what we've got to do is get
[35:02] back into the program of God and find
[35:04] out after Oh what God wants us to do and
[35:08] the only way I know to do it is prayer
[35:11] prayer is the key that's the answer
[35:15] prayer changes things
[35:17] prayer is the most powerful weapon that
[35:20] was ever put in the control of human
[35:25] beings there is no atomic bomb no
[35:28] hydrogen bomb as powerful as prayer
[35:31] prayer will change the mind of God did
[35:35] you know that it did it one time we know
[35:37] of
[35:38] it was Hezekiah and God had sent His
[35:42] Word we know the highest order of
[35:44] command is that says the Lord that's the
[35:47] final say and God told Isaiah go tell
[35:50] Hezekiah to put his house in order
[35:52] because his time is up
[35:53] but when Hezekiah was told he knew that
[35:57] that says the Lord is the final say
[35:59] there is no man who can change that says
[36:01] the Lord but he came to God in prayer
[36:05] you the power of prayer and he went and
[36:07] he started praying he wept bitterly and
[36:10] he prayed to God to give him more time
[36:13] and once
[36:14] Isaiah was working out I believe people
[36:17] were ask him what did God say because
[36:20] they knew that God sent His Word through
[36:22] the Prophet and they asked him Isaiah
[36:24] what did God say and Isaiah say God say
[36:28] the king is dying going out through the
[36:31] courts what does the word of what does
[36:33] what is God saying God is the king is
[36:37] going to die and he was just giving what
[36:40] God has said and meanwhile Hezekiah was
[36:43] knelt facing the wall crying asking for
[36:47] God to intervene asking for God to give
[36:49] him more time because he knew that when
[36:52] God says something that is it and he
[36:54] knew he was going the only option that
[36:56] he had was to pray there was nothing
[36:59] else he could do and he started praying
[37:01] brother he started praying and God had
[37:05] his prayer and he did what he says in
[37:08] second chronicles he had from heaven and
[37:11] he answered Hezekiah Sprayer
[37:14] whilst he was you praying God told
[37:16] Isaiah go back and tell Hezekiah that I
[37:20] have heard his prayer I have listened to
[37:22] him and I am giving him 15 more years
[37:25] and Isaiah before he was even we had
[37:29] even reached where he was going he
[37:31] turned around and he started going back
[37:33] and people started asking him why are
[37:35] you coming back did God say something
[37:37] else
[37:38] he said yes God told me that says the
[37:41] Lord the king is going to leave and he
[37:43] started walking back up into the
[37:45] chambers in the palace of the king and
[37:47] he went back and he said that says the
[37:49] Lord God has added more years unto you
[37:53] and we are saying God the prayer the
[37:56] prayer of Hezekiah absolutely changed
[37:58] the mind of God it's changed that the
[38:01] decision that God had made and he did
[38:05] this before atonement he did this before
[38:07] Calvary back in the Old Testament and
[38:10] now we are living in the we are living
[38:13] in the actuality of time amen and now we
[38:16] know that when we pray to God we
[38:19] can change situations no matter how a
[38:21] situation look God will change it
[38:23] hallelujah and we know that he changed
[38:26] hezekiah sprayer and hezekiah we know he
[38:31] knew the power of prayer and they use
[38:34] another situation he had all read in 2nd
[38:37] Kings 19 chapter 14
[38:54] Hezekiah received a letter it was
[38:57] threatening from it was from Sennacherib
[39:00] and he was saying he was threatening to
[39:04] come and demolish Israel and Hezekiah
[39:07] received the letter of the hand of the
[39:09] messengers and read it and Hezekiah went
[39:12] up into the house of the Lord and spread
[39:14] it before the Lord and Hezekiah prayed
[39:17] before the Lord and said O Lord God of
[39:19] Israel which dwell between the cherubims
[39:23] thou art God even thou alone of all the
[39:27] kingdoms of the earth thou has made
[39:30] heaven and earth
[39:31] Lord bow down line here and here open
[39:35] Lord thine eyes and see and hear the
[39:38] words of Sennacherib which has sent him
[39:40] to reproach the Living God why was
[39:44] Hezekiah doing this he knew that God he
[39:48] had read 2nd chronicles before and he
[39:51] knew that God always hear from heaven
[39:53] and he will answer and he had evidence
[39:56] that God can do this because he had been
[39:59] given more life and he knew that if I
[40:01] come to God again in prayer he will
[40:04] grant unto me my heart's desire and he
[40:07] says of a truth Lord the kings of
[40:10] Assyria have destroyed the nations and
[40:12] their lands and have cast their gods
[40:15] into the fire and there were no gods but
[40:17] the work of man's hand wood and stone
[40:20] therefore they have destroyed them now
[40:22] therefore O Lord our God I beseech thee
[40:24] save thou us out of this out of his hand
[40:27] that all the kingdoms of the earth may
[40:30] know that thou art the Lord God even
[40:33] though only in Isaiah the son of Amoz
[40:36] sent to Hezekiah saying thus says the
[40:38] Lord God of Israel that which thou has
[40:42] prayed to me again Sennacherib king of
[40:44] Assyria I have heard and this is the
[40:48] word the Lord that the Lord hath spoken
[40:50] turning him the Virgin the daughter of
[40:52] Zion hath despised the love deep with
[40:55] scorn the daughter of Jerusalem has
[40:57] shaken her head at the a man we see that
[41:01] God is telling Hezekiah I've heard your
[41:04] prayer
[41:04] Hebrew first Hezekiah was honest
[41:08] god he said Lord we have seen them
[41:10] destroying other nations and now they
[41:13] are headed for us he knew there was
[41:14] nothing there was no way out for them he
[41:17] knew there was going to be destroyed but
[41:19] Lord he came and he was honest and he
[41:21] said Lord look at this threat
[41:24] he came with a letter that Seneca River
[41:26] had sent unto them and he brought it
[41:28] before into the temple of the Lord and
[41:30] he prayed Lord he our prayer and God
[41:34] gave them victory through that a man so
[41:37] no matter what even if you are given a
[41:40] report by the doctor you go to God and
[41:43] you say Lord I know for sure this is
[41:46] what the doctor have seen this is what
[41:49] they have seen using their machines yes
[41:51] it is true but lord please hear my
[41:54] prayer
[41:55] please Lord heal me and for a shore God
[41:59] will respect your prayer and he will
[42:02] respond and give you your need amen and
[42:04] we know for sure prayer changes things
[42:07] and we seem he did it in Hezekiah life
[42:10] two times he was added more life and
[42:13] this thread of this king wanted to come
[42:16] and destroy Israel it was reversed again
[42:19] a man and we know we know of Esther we
[42:26] read in Esther chapter 4 verse 13
[42:42] then Mordecai commanded to answer s da
[42:45] think not with I sell that thou shalt
[42:48] escape in the king's house more than all
[42:51] the Jews for if thou altogether holdest
[42:54] I peace at this time then shall there
[42:56] enlargement and deliverance arise to the
[43:00] Jews from another place but thou and thy
[43:02] father's house shall be destroyed and
[43:05] who knoweth where that thou art come to
[43:07] the kingdom for such a time like this
[43:10] then Esther bade them returned
[43:12] Mordecai this answered go gather
[43:15] together all the Jews that are present
[43:18] in Shushan and first year for me
[43:20] and neither eat nor drink three days
[43:23] nice or day I out say and my maidens
[43:27] will fast likewise and will so will I go
[43:30] in unto the King which is not according
[43:33] to the law and if I perish I perish so
[43:37] America went to his way and did
[43:38] according to all that Esther had
[43:40] commanded him we know here that Haman
[43:43] had went to King Ahasuerus and he had
[43:46] asked to pass a decree which commanded
[43:49] that all the Jews were to be
[43:51] exterminated all of them they were to be
[43:54] killed and Esther was a queen and she
[43:57] knew that if this decree was passed she
[43:59] was not going to be safe everyone who
[44:02] was of the Jewish descent was to be
[44:04] killed but she knew she was in a place
[44:07] there was only two options
[44:09] it's either she was either a do or die
[44:13] or rather a die or die because if she
[44:16] was not going to go she was the whole
[44:19] nation was going to be killed and there
[44:21] was also an law that said a queen was
[44:27] not supposed to go to the to see the
[44:29] king unless she was Simone so she was
[44:32] between a rock and a hard place she
[44:35] could not go to the king with her
[44:36] petition and she if she went she was
[44:40] going she could be killed because she
[44:42] would have disobeyed the law so if she
[44:45] could she was going to go she was going
[44:47] to be killed and if she was not gonna go
[44:50] there was a decree that was passed that
[44:53] she was going to be killed
[44:55] with all the other Jews she had no
[44:58] option the option that she had she had
[45:02] to go she prayed she called for a fast
[45:05] for three days three nights' the whole
[45:07] nation all the Jews in there say class
[45:10] they started praying and they fasted for
[45:12] they knew they had history that when we
[45:15] pray to God he always answers hallelujah
[45:18] and she prayed and they prayed after the
[45:22] three days she decided she was going to
[45:24] go and she said if I perish I perish but
[45:28] I'm going in to see the king hallelujah
[45:31] she walked in and went to the king and
[45:34] this was a moment where it was going to
[45:37] decide her fate either the king was
[45:39] going to raise a scepter and say she was
[45:42] accepted to come in or she was gonna be
[45:44] condemned to death and she knew this
[45:47] could happen just a few moments before
[45:50] that she knew the King didn't play games
[45:53] because the other Queen that was before
[45:56] her was chased away when she did not
[45:59] obey the King and she was scared she
[46:01] knew this could happen but she said if I
[46:04] perish I perish but she knew that were
[46:06] the power of prayer after they had
[46:08] prayed for three days she believed that
[46:11] God was going to help her a man and she
[46:14] walked in and the King accepted accepted
[46:17] her entrance and she came in and she
[46:19] saved the whole nation so the decree
[46:22] that was made to end her life it was
[46:25] reversed the law that was said it was
[46:28] impossible it was made possible because
[46:30] Esther prayed and it happened like that
[46:33] amen so whatever anything that is meant
[46:36] against you any curse that is meant
[46:38] against you you pray to God God will
[46:41] reverse it it doesn't matter what it is
[46:43] what decree is who made it no matter how
[46:47] many demons or how many devils in
[46:49] healthy that God can reverse that and it
[46:53] will work out in your favor hallelujah
[46:56] amen and we know of matter you are
[47:00] always supposed to have faith in God
[47:02] when you pray you know that God always
[47:05] will help you we're just talking about
[47:08] Esther she had hope
[47:09] she knew that if she she went no matter
[47:12] how bad the situation was God was going
[47:15] to answer and now we come to the New
[47:17] Testament with matter they had sent for
[47:19] Jesus for quite a long time asking for
[47:22] Jesus to come in and pray for their for
[47:24] their brother who was Jesus friend and
[47:27] they said he is he is now he is sick
[47:30] please come quickly so he can so you can
[47:34] pray for him because they knew God they
[47:37] knew Jesus they knew the power he had
[47:39] they had seen testimonies of him raising
[47:41] the dead for him praying for the sick
[47:44] healing the people and he they saw that
[47:46] happening and they knew that if they
[47:48] would approach Christ he would come in
[47:51] and he will help them but God delayed
[47:54] after he heard that he actually went for
[47:56] another journey and the disciples are
[47:59] wondering but we just had your friend is
[48:01] sick but you know he added another
[48:04] missionary Jenny India went and he came
[48:06] after Lazarus was dead and when he came
[48:12] they said Master where were you when we
[48:15] called you to come and pray for Lazarus
[48:17] but now he is gone but I like the
[48:20] attitude that mother had that is in John
[48:23] 1122 who said from German and says then
[48:34] said mother unto Jesus Lord if thou has
[48:36] been here my brother had not died but I
[48:40] know that even now whatsoever that would
[48:43] ask of God God will give it to thee that
[48:46] is the right mental attitude that she
[48:48] had that she said even now no matter how
[48:51] the situation how bad it is gone even
[48:54] now Lord I know you can still do it and
[48:57] we know that Jesus went and he raised
[49:00] Lazarus we know Mark Mary and Martha
[49:04] went and rolled the stone grave the the
[49:07] stone that was in front of the grave and
[49:10] there was not a small stone so this
[49:13] shows this tells us they had faith they
[49:16] knew that Jesus could do it because
[49:18] being able to go do it
[49:20] they had never seen this happen before
[49:21] but they knew
[49:23] they had that attitude Matta had that
[49:25] attitude to say even now no matter how
[49:28] bad the situation look she said even now
[49:31] I know you can still do it no matter how
[49:34] the situation had gone worse from being
[49:36] sick and now it was dead there was
[49:38] absolutely no hope but she said I know
[49:41] Lord even now this is the approach the
[49:44] meant attitude we are supposed to have
[49:46] with God
[49:47] no matter what situation no matter how
[49:49] bad it is you just go to God and you say
[49:52] Lord you go and pray and you say even
[49:54] now no matter how bad it is you probably
[49:58] thought that if it was done maybe a year
[50:01] ago that's when you thought it would now
[50:03] you have no hope but you pray you just
[50:06] say Lord I know even I thought it was
[50:08] going to happen then and there is no
[50:10] hope it's deader than it looked before
[50:12] you say Lord even now and I promise you
[50:16] if you come to him in prayer he is able
[50:18] to answer you hallelujah he is able to
[50:21] do it and he is able to raise the
[50:23] Lazarus that is sick amen that Lazarus
[50:26] who is dead and buried for days he will
[50:29] bring hope where there was no hope and
[50:31] we'll see he cried out Lazarus come
[50:34] forth and he came up this was because of
[50:36] the faith and hope that Martha had they
[50:39] had faith that he could undo the
[50:42] situation that had turned really worse
[50:44] hallelujah because they knew that the
[50:47] importance of prayer amen
[50:49] because pray is the most powerful force
[50:53] that was ever given to us in my Angel's
[51:01] should go before the paragraph seven he
[51:04] says now along this journey
[51:06] he promised to supply everything that we
[51:08] have need of whatsoever you will ask in
[51:10] my father's name that will I do
[51:13] it says whatsoever things not some
[51:17] things but whatsoever things he says
[51:20] whatsoever things you desire when you
[51:23] pray believe you receive it and you
[51:26] shall have it now he gave us the
[51:28] strongest weapon that there is in all
[51:31] the world
[51:31] and that's prayer prayer is that changes
[51:34] things the Christian doesn't really
[51:37] what a force he has when he kneels on
[51:39] his knees before Almighty God in the
[51:42] name of Jesus Christ
[51:44] he doesn't realize that he doesn't
[51:47] realize what power that is if the people
[51:50] could only realize that what is given
[51:53] right unto them anything that you ask
[51:55] for will be given if you can appropriate
[51:58] the faith to believe it for God's Word
[52:01] is true and now God's Word will defeat
[52:04] Satan anywhere any place any time a man
[52:10] because this is the most powerful force
[52:13] the most powerful weapon that God placed
[52:16] in you and I sensed this morning a man
[52:19] for us to use we have to make maximum
[52:21] use of this great whip on a man and we
[52:26] know that many nations they boast we
[52:29] have Russia boasting they about the
[52:31] nuclear bombs they have we have the u.s.
[52:34] it also boasts of the technology and
[52:39] bombs nuclear bombs they have and we
[52:41] have each and every nation South Korea
[52:44] everybody is talking about what they
[52:46] have so why should we be quiet we should
[52:49] also boast because of the power that we
[52:52] have because we have a greater atomic
[52:54] bomb model a greater than an atomic bomb
[52:57] we have the power within us amen we have
[53:00] read we know of auntie Jemima
[53:02] in Tennessee she prayed and she was able
[53:06] to ground the plane a man she prayed in
[53:10] the middle of the night and God listened
[53:13] to her prayer he knew that he knew that
[53:16] he could supply to her her needs and she
[53:19] prayed and she knew that her prayer was
[53:21] going to be answered and it grounded a
[53:26] whole plane that was full of people
[53:28] there were people with the business
[53:30] meetings that were supposed to they were
[53:33] rushing for different things but God
[53:36] prioritize auntie Jemima sprayer amen
[53:39] and you know when you pray God will
[53:42] prioritize your situation no matter what
