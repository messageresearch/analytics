[46:39] now i paul myself beseech you
[46:43] by the meekness and gentleness of christ
[46:48] who in presence and base among you
[46:51] but being absent and bold toward you
[46:55] when i'm with you
[46:56] i'm humble but when i'm away from you
[46:59] i'm bold about you but i beseech you
[47:03] that i may not be bold when i am present
[47:06] with that confidence
[47:08] wherewith i think to be bold against
[47:10] some
[47:11] which think of us as if we walked
[47:15] according to the flesh for though we
[47:18] walk in the flesh
[47:20] we do not war after the flesh
[47:23] for the weapons of our warfare
[47:27] are not carnal but mighty through god
[47:31] to the pulling down of strongholds as
[47:34] with our hearts before we're seated
[47:36] heavenly father we thank you for this
[47:38] opportunity to be here tonight
[47:40] and lord i realize as we
[47:44] rush about life's task
[47:47] lord sometimes our mind or even our
[47:50] spirit
[47:50] might get derailed for just a few
[47:53] moments
[47:55] lord as we search out your will we ask
[47:58] god that you come on the scene now
[48:00] lord in any that might be weary in body
[48:03] we pray
[48:03] you rest them lord any that might be
[48:06] troubled by spirit
[48:08] we pray lord that you arrest the spirit
[48:11] father let us all be brought under
[48:14] subjection to the holy spirit
[48:16] lord we pray that your will would be
[48:18] dumb and the presentation
[48:20] of this word may it just flow lord from
[48:23] the throne of god into the hearts of
[48:26] your people
[48:27] and lord if anything is said or done let
[48:30] it be that your name
[48:31] is lifted up you are glorified you are
[48:34] praised
[48:35] and your children are drawn closer to
[48:37] you
[48:38] father we ask you now to help me get
[48:40] myself out of the way
[48:42] lord that you might speak to hearts of
[48:44] gold from lips of clay
[48:46] we thank you lord in the name of jesus
[48:48] christ
[48:49] amen amen you may be seated
[48:54] i know you've heard this scripture many
[48:56] times
[48:57] and i know you have
[49:00] talked about it many times and
[49:03] read it many times and discussed it many
[49:06] times
[49:07] but something i've always found about
[49:10] the word of god
[49:12] no matter how many times i read it or
[49:14] how many times i have preached from
[49:16] it or heard it preached there's always
[49:18] something more to come out of it
[49:21] right i can preach on subjects brother
[49:23] brooks that i preached on 50 years ago
[49:26] amen and and i've got mess i've got
[49:28] outlines from that long ago and i can go
[49:31] back and look at them and they look so
[49:32] juvenile
[49:33] amen you begin to look well there's so
[49:36] much more in that now than there was
[49:38] then amen but paul
[49:41] here is addressing a thought
[49:45] amen that he has some conflict
[49:48] some men are accusing him
[49:51] of walking in the flesh but now he knows
[49:55] he is not right he knows he
[49:58] is not walking in the flesh though he is
[50:00] being accused of it maybe because
[50:03] of some of his actions some people that
[50:06] are trying to tear down the kingdom of
[50:08] god
[50:09] are talking about paul and accusing him
[50:11] of walking in the flesh
[50:13] amen and paul admits something he says
[50:16] though
[50:17] we are in the flesh i'm in the flesh
[50:21] here tonight
[50:22] right i'm a little tired in body amen
[50:25] and you
[50:26] may be also you may have worked today
[50:28] you may have had struggles and trials
[50:30] and
[50:30] and you're a little tired in your body
[50:32] also amen
[50:34] but though we are in the flesh we know
[50:37] that our warfare
[50:39] is not according to the flesh man now
[50:42] you say wait a minute brother prater i
[50:44] struggle with him every day i want to
[50:45] take you to a route
[50:46] amen of why we have these daily
[50:49] struggles
[50:50] amen remember paul said our weapons
[50:54] are not fleshly amen you may carry a
[50:58] pistol you may
[51:00] you know you you may you may have a
[51:03] a concealed carry permit amen but that's
[51:06] not going to do one thing good about a
[51:08] spiritual battle
[51:09] right amen and i i don't know how they
[51:12] are
[51:13] way up here way up north from where
[51:15] we're at i know
[51:16] amen the country down in arkansas may be
[51:19] a little bit different than it is way up
[51:21] here up north
[51:22] amen but our natural weapons are not
[51:24] going to do one thing
[51:26] to amen expose satan or to bring forth
[51:29] victory
[51:30] in our spiritual warfare amen
[51:33] because our weapons are not carnal or
[51:36] are not
[51:37] fleshly they are of god
[51:40] amen so the scripture is telling us
[51:43] amen that they are divinely powerful
[51:47] oh my amen now when you think about
[51:49] having
[51:50] something at your fingertips that is
[51:53] divinely powerful amen you know there's
[51:56] nothing more stronger than that which is
[51:58] divine
[51:59] amen there's nothing more powerful than
[52:01] the divine
[52:03] amen even father divine is not as
[52:06] divine or not as powerful as our divine
[52:09] father
[52:10] amen his weapons were carnal they were
[52:13] fleshly they were green
[52:15] right amen but ours is is a spiritual
[52:19] weapon that we have amen some of you may
[52:21] not know what i'm talking about
[52:23] amen but i i know that some of you do
[52:26] also
[52:27] amen now listen to the reason that paul
[52:30] is instructing us
[52:32] amen about the weapons that are at our
[52:34] disposal
[52:36] amen he says and this is in in my
[52:39] terminology
[52:40] that we may demolish satan's
[52:44] strongholds amen now to demolish them
[52:47] means that we overcome them
[52:51] right demolish them means that they're
[52:53] not even left standing
[52:54] when we finish the battle amen when the
[52:58] battle's over
[52:59] i shall wear a crown
[53:02] amen so paul himself is using words that
[53:06] brings
[53:07] our understanding common phrases
[53:10] about warfare about the struggles of
[53:13] life
[53:14] amen when he talks about pulling down
[53:16] strongholds
[53:18] amen he's not talking about towers or
[53:20] forts of stone and wood
[53:22] amen such as soldiers used to fight when
[53:24] they would go in to invade an army
[53:26] or a country a land amen they would pull
[53:29] down the strongholds the walls or the
[53:32] tall towers in order to defeat the enemy
[53:36] amen but paul said our stronghold holds
[53:38] or
[53:39] excuse me are not the strongholds that
[53:42] we are fighting against
[53:43] are not strongholds of stone amen but of
[53:48] imaginations oh my
[53:50] amen how many of you know that why
[53:52] brother branham preached the message
[53:54] entitled
[53:55] amen the greatest battle ever fought
[53:57] amen where is it at
[53:58] amen it's fault here before it gets into
[54:00] the heart right
[54:01] amen so we have to have something to
[54:04] combat
[54:05] amen the imaginations that satan brings
[54:09] into our life amen how many of you ever
[54:12] imagined something that's not really
[54:14] true
[54:15] ever imagine somebody said something
[54:18] about you
[54:19] and they really didn't say it huh you've
[54:22] been there
[54:23] amen you ever imagined that somebody was
[54:25] holding something against you
[54:27] amen but they had never ever done
[54:29] anything
[54:31] to to bring you into a conflict
[54:34] amen you ever imagined somebody amen
[54:37] just
[54:37] just you know i i just can't get in with
[54:40] that person
[54:41] it must be that amen that person
[54:44] is against me amen and though they've
[54:47] never said anything a
[54:49] contrary do you you ever said in the in
[54:52] your in your seat in the church and
[54:54] amen imagine that the pastor is picking
[54:57] on you
[54:58] right he's preaching something amen just
[55:01] because he knows amen me and
[55:05] and you know sometimes he is but if he's
[55:08] a real pastor
[55:09] amen he never preaches in a with an
[55:11] intent of pushing you down
[55:13] amen but if he knows you need something
[55:15] he'll lift you
[55:16] up amen because the pastor understands
[55:19] we are lifted by lifting others up
[55:22] oh my amen so paul is telling us we
[55:25] don't have a battle
[55:27] against strongholds of stone
[55:30] but our battle amen is against
[55:33] imaginations
[55:35] if we can just realize amen where satan
[55:39] comes from
[55:40] amen and what satan uses to tear down
[55:44] the kingdom of god
[55:45] it's not going to be amen and it has
[55:47] been in the past i understand that
[55:49] amen in the dark ages and the ages of
[55:52] martyrology but today
[55:53] amen what he has the stronghold that
[55:56] satan has
[55:57] mainly against the bride of jesus christ
[56:00] is the imaginations that she can come up
[56:02] with amen that needs to be defeated in
[56:05] this hour
[56:06] amen not only is paul saying that uh our
[56:09] strongholds are not strongholds of stone
[56:12] amen but they are strongholds of
[56:14] imaginations and they are strongholds of
[56:17] arguments let me come back to that one
[56:21] later if the lord wills
[56:22] amen he said it's not high things
[56:26] like those great towers or those great
[56:29] walls like was built around jerusalem or
[56:32] amen you know the kind of walls i'm
[56:33] talking about paul
[56:35] is saying amen we are battling against
[56:39] high falutin attitudes
[56:42] you say amen oh my highfalutin attitudes
[56:46] got what preacher amen he may believe
[56:49] that his ministry
[56:50] is the one everybody has to come to
[56:53] that's a highfalutin attitude
[56:55] amen i won't tell you who you have to
[56:57] come to you have to come to christ
[57:00] is that right you don't have to have me
[57:02] amen you have to have christ
[57:04] and if christ has anointed a voice for
[57:06] the last age
[57:07] that's the one you need to come to amen
[57:10] those people that can come with
[57:12] highfalutin attitude if you get it from
[57:14] god you've got to get it through me amen
[57:16] god wants that kind of attitude tore
[57:18] down
[57:21] oh i love these amen amen as a matter of
[57:24] fact i need him i don't have a high
[57:26] falutin attitude
[57:27] amen that that i'm the special one here
[57:29] tonight
[57:30] amen as a matter of fact and i'm going
[57:32] to share this brother brooks asked me
[57:34] what i wanted to do about
[57:35] amen two services tomorrow and i said
[57:37] preach one of those other preachers for
[57:39] me
[57:40] right amen because i want to hear what
[57:43] you've got to say
[57:45] highfalutin attitudes
[57:50] our battle and our warfare amen
[57:53] is not taking into captivity
[57:56] enemy soldiers amen but
[58:00] we have to take into captivity
[58:03] enemies thoughts right
[58:06] amen we have to tear down
[58:09] his thoughts that he plants here
[58:13] amen before they get here we have to
[58:16] reach
[58:17] in amen to the spiritual kingdom and
[58:20] pull
[58:20] down his thoughts
[58:23] because his thoughts war against the
[58:27] soul
[58:28] i'll try to slow down some amen his
[58:31] thoughts war
[58:32] against our soul and they war
[58:36] against the spiritual things that we
[58:38] have
[58:40] amen some of these things i'm just
[58:42] hitting high points so that i can come
[58:43] back to
[58:44] amen you know strongholds as we're
[58:46] reading in the bible
[58:48] in in one sense they can be good and
[58:51] another since they're bad because you
[58:52] know god has strongholds also
[58:55] is that right amen he has a place to
[58:57] fortify
[58:58] you he has a place to lift us up he has
[59:01] a place amen to bring
[59:02] us to an understanding of who we
[59:06] are and i understand this that the bride
[59:09] ever sees her name
[59:11] written in this book right amen when she
[59:14] catches that revelation
[59:16] not just by reading or by hearing amen
[59:19] but she really gets that spiritual
[59:21] revelation
[59:22] amen that she is the one in this book
[59:24] that is called
[59:25] overcomers she's the one in this book
[59:28] amen that actually kicks satan into the
[59:32] bottomless pit
[59:33] she's the one that actually comes to the
[59:36] place
[59:36] that she puts him amen in that chain
[59:40] of circumstances oh i know it's god
[59:43] through her
[59:45] but god's going to use her right amen
[59:48] she is him by the way amen so when we
[59:51] look at this we're going to look at some
[59:53] strongholds that are good
[59:55] and strongholds that are bad amen
[59:58] basically speaking
[1:00:01] strongholds are fortified places
[1:00:06] what is fortified amen fortified is
[1:00:08] something that is strengthened it's made
[1:00:11] stronger what is the bride's
[1:00:13] fortification in this hour
[1:00:15] amen well jesus somebody said and that's
[1:00:18] absolutely the truth
[1:00:19] amen and somebody said the word so you
[1:00:21] got the same answer
[1:00:22] right amen we are fortified behind the
[1:00:26] word of god oh my
[1:00:28] amen satan absolutely cannot stop
[1:00:32] amen this word from being performed
[1:00:36] you realize that church you realize why
[1:00:39] brother brian branham taught us the
[1:00:40] seventh seal was a silent seal
[1:00:42] amen why because if it was an open seal
[1:00:45] i mean satan would get in there and mix
[1:00:48] it up right
[1:00:49] but it's that silent seal i mean it
[1:00:51] comes as a
[1:00:52] revelation to the bride now you might
[1:00:55] think
[1:00:56] what you want to about it amen but i do
[1:00:58] know that brother branham said the
[1:00:59] rapture
[1:01:00] is a revelation is that right
[1:01:04] and he said the bride will be waiting
[1:01:06] for that
[1:01:07] revelation of the rapture satan can't
[1:01:10] get
[1:01:10] into that fortification why
[1:01:14] it's sealed by god and will not be
[1:01:18] broken to anybody
[1:01:19] except those who are going in the
[1:01:21] rapture
[1:01:22] and he said the rapture is for
[1:01:25] the bride aren't you glad you're bright
[1:01:29] amen so basically peace speaking
[1:01:32] strongholds
[1:01:33] are fortified places whether they're
[1:01:37] from satan or from god whether they're
[1:01:39] good or bad
[1:01:41] amen it's a place of security
[1:01:44] i can rest today amen
[1:01:48] because i know there's something wrapped
[1:01:51] all around me
[1:01:52] amen you ever hear the song i'm all
[1:01:55] tangled up
[1:01:56] wrapped up and tied up in jesus somebody
[1:01:58] says you ought not be that way
[1:02:00] you ought not be wrapped up y'all not be
[1:02:02] tangled up y'all not be
[1:02:04] i hope i'm not saying something amen
[1:02:06] that i shouldn't say
[1:02:08] amen i want to be wrapped up in jesus
[1:02:10] and if i'm tangled up in anything let it
[1:02:12] be the word of god
[1:02:14] can you say amen amen a place of
[1:02:17] security or survival
[1:02:20] a cliff you know like that the eagle
[1:02:22] goes to
[1:02:24] a high place to build her nest in the
[1:02:27] cleft of the rock
[1:02:28] you know why she does that because it's
[1:02:30] inaccessible to the enemy
[1:02:32] come on it's inaccessible to the enemy
[1:02:35] that's when she builds her nest up in
[1:02:37] the high places
[1:02:38] not only is it inaccessible to the enemy
[1:02:41] amen
[1:02:42] she can see as far as her eye will let
[1:02:45] her see
[1:02:45] and knows when the enemy is coming oh my
[1:02:48] do you ever know why they built a
[1:02:50] their nest on those high cliff sides
[1:02:52] amen because there ain't no serpent
[1:02:54] going to get up there
[1:02:56] can you say amen i want to i want to i
[1:02:59] want my security in jesus christ
[1:03:02] is that right because if it's in jesus
[1:03:05] christ
[1:03:05] it is eternal oh my
[1:03:09] amen a high or
[1:03:12] uh lofty or inaccessible
[1:03:15] place now amen we look at these things
[1:03:19] we know
[1:03:20] the psalmist david he had troubles in
[1:03:23] his life
[1:03:24] amen he had complexes in his life right
[1:03:28] amen he he he did a lot of things that
[1:03:32] that are questionable amen but one thing
[1:03:34] about
[1:03:35] it he was a fighter is that right he was
[1:03:39] a warrior
[1:03:40] he was a he was an overcomer the
[1:03:42] psalmist david wrote in psalms 9 9
[1:03:46] he said the lord also will be
[1:03:49] a refuge for the oppressed
[1:03:53] come on satan pour it on us can you say
[1:03:56] amen
[1:03:56] come on you might not want to say amen
[1:03:58] to that amen but we can say
[1:04:00] satan amen regardless of where you're
[1:04:02] coming from
[1:04:04] regardless of what you're bringing
[1:04:06] against me you are oppressing me
[1:04:08] amen but the psalmist david told me
[1:04:12] amen that if i am oppressed
[1:04:16] i can go to the lord and he
[1:04:19] will be my refuge he will be
[1:04:23] my stronghold he will be my fortress
[1:04:27] in the time of adversity in the time of
[1:04:30] trouble
[1:04:30] in the time of struggle amen i will go
[1:04:33] to the lord he will be my refuge in the
[1:04:36] time of oppression
[1:04:40] don't get scared be cautious
[1:04:44] but don't get scared of covet 19 i see
[1:04:47] that you're not scared of it but i'm
[1:04:48] going to say it anyway
[1:04:50] amen because the lord is our refuge
[1:04:54] right i'm cautious about it right
[1:04:58] i wear the mask i wash my hands i'm
[1:05:00] cautious
[1:05:01] because the thing is real but i'm not
[1:05:04] going to live in fear of it
[1:05:06] right satan is not going to bind me down
[1:05:08] with these things
[1:05:09] now if you notice church in the fourth
[1:05:12] seal
[1:05:13] amen when it talks about the way that
[1:05:15] those things come up on the earth in the
[1:05:17] fourth seal
[1:05:18] now not the seven trumpets the seven
[1:05:20] trumpets are plagues from god
[1:05:23] right but the bride don't have to worry
[1:05:25] about those seven trumpets
[1:05:27] because she's not going to be here for
[1:05:28] the tribulation period
[1:05:30] is that right but when you see in the
[1:05:32] fourth seal which is brother bradham
[1:05:34] said the bride is
[1:05:36] raptured in the fourth seal do we
[1:05:38] believe that
[1:05:40] amen so she is raptured in the fourth
[1:05:42] seal
[1:05:43] and it talks about amen the things that
[1:05:46] are happening around her
[1:05:48] in the time of the fourth seal it says
[1:05:50] they
[1:05:51] kill with a sword now look at all the
[1:05:55] wars we got
[1:05:56] and they kill with famine now look at
[1:05:58] all the famines we got
[1:06:00] right and they kill with death and
[1:06:04] with beasts of the earth
[1:06:07] there's you a a signal amen i don't care
[1:06:10] where it come from
[1:06:11] it's coming from the beasts of the earth
[1:06:14] so
[1:06:14] when satan amen is attacking us
[1:06:18] just before the rapture of the church
[1:06:22] amen he's going to be doing it with
[1:06:24] sword with famine
[1:06:26] with death and with the beasts of the
[1:06:28] earth hold on church
[1:06:29] the rapture is imminent
[1:06:34] the things of the fourth seal are being
[1:06:36] being fulfilled all around us right now
[1:06:40] i've got confidence that christ is going
[1:06:43] to see me through
[1:06:44] not only did david say the lord also
[1:06:46] will be a refuge for the oppressed
[1:06:49] he's always on the side of the oppressed
[1:06:54] so the more satan turns the heat up amen
[1:06:57] the more i'm confident the lord amen is
[1:07:00] coming to my rescue
[1:07:03] he also said a refuge
[1:07:06] in times of trouble
[1:07:10] now let's use a natural circumstance
[1:07:14] amen to combat strongholds
[1:07:18] first samuel 23 14
[1:07:21] talking about david again and david a
[1:07:25] bold
[1:07:26] in the wilderness in strongholds
[1:07:29] now what was he doing he was fleeing
[1:07:32] from saul is that right not only was he
[1:07:35] fleeing from saul
[1:07:37] at one time here he's fleeing also from
[1:07:39] the palestinian or the philistines
[1:07:41] excuse me
[1:07:43] and remained watched now and david
[1:07:47] abode in the wilderness in strongholds
[1:07:50] and remained in a mountain in the
[1:07:53] wilderness of ziff
[1:07:56] watch what it says about david he's the
[1:07:58] one
[1:07:59] amen that said the lord also will be a
[1:08:02] refuge for the oppressed
[1:08:03] a refuge in the time of trouble and so
[1:08:06] he's
[1:08:07] being pressured by saul and he's being
[1:08:10] pressured by the
[1:08:11] philistines and here's the man saying
[1:08:15] i'm under an oppression saul is after me
[1:08:18] i'm troubled on every hand but where do
[1:08:20] i go i go to the mountain
[1:08:23] anybody ever been to israel amen you
[1:08:25] ever go down to in getty
[1:08:27] amen to see where david wrote these
[1:08:29] things from amen in those high mountains
[1:08:31] and those refuge in those places
[1:08:33] where saul couldn't find him unless
[1:08:36] david
[1:08:37] wanted to reveal himself to saul
[1:08:43] and david abode in the wilderness
[1:08:46] in strongholds
[1:08:50] turn your in your bible to revelation
[1:08:52] chapter 12 with me
[1:08:55] and this is fresh this one just came to
[1:08:58] me
[1:08:59] amen this is the ones i like this is the
[1:09:01] one that just came to me
[1:09:03] revelation chapter 12.
[1:09:06] how many of you know that brother
[1:09:08] branham in more than one place
[1:09:11] type to revelation chapter 12. i mean
[1:09:15] is it okay if i make myself comfortable
[1:09:17] all right
[1:09:18] amen and i don't wear suspenders because
[1:09:21] i'm losing weight
[1:09:22] i wear them because i put on so much
[1:09:24] weight
[1:09:26] it don't mean that my wife isn't cooking
[1:09:28] for me it means she's cooking too much
[1:09:30] so
[1:09:32] amen revelation chapter 12 amen
[1:09:35] it's divided into three parts it's
[1:09:38] divided into israel
[1:09:40] it's divided into the bride and it's
[1:09:42] divided
[1:09:43] into the tribulation period now watch
[1:09:46] revelation
[1:09:47] 12 7. and there was war in heaven
[1:09:51] michael and his angels fought against
[1:09:52] the dragon and the dragon fought against
[1:09:54] his angels
[1:09:55] and prevailed not like that amen
[1:09:58] neither was there place found in any
[1:10:01] more
[1:10:02] in heaven and brother brown said when
[1:10:04] satan comes down the bride goes up
[1:10:06] right and the great dragon was cast out
[1:10:08] that old serpent called the devil
[1:10:10] satan and satan which deceiveth the
[1:10:12] whole world
[1:10:14] he cast he was cast into the earth and
[1:10:16] his angels were cast out with him and i
[1:10:18] heard a loud voice
[1:10:19] in heaven saying now has come salvation
[1:10:22] and strength
[1:10:23] my my my amen and the kingdoms of our
[1:10:26] god and the power of his christ for the
[1:10:28] accuser of our brethren is cast
[1:10:30] down which accused them before our god
[1:10:32] day and night
[1:10:33] and they overcame him by the blood of
[1:10:35] them by the word of their testimony
[1:10:37] and they love not their lives unto death
[1:10:39] therefore rejoice ye heavens and ye that
[1:10:41] dwell in woe to the inhabitants of the
[1:10:42] earth third woe by the way
[1:10:44] and of the sea for the devil has come
[1:10:46] down unto you having great wrath
[1:10:48] now what are we talking about amen in
[1:10:50] the time of oppression
[1:10:52] because he knoweth that his time is
[1:10:54] short and when the dragon saw that he
[1:10:56] was cast into the earth now remember
[1:10:58] brother branham said that happens
[1:10:59] when he comes down the bride goes up he
[1:11:02] persecuted the woman which brought forth
[1:11:03] the man child
[1:11:04] the bride and to the woman were given
[1:11:08] two wings
[1:11:10] of a great eagle two wings of one eagle
[1:11:13] not two eagles now two wings of one
[1:11:15] eagle
[1:11:16] an old testament prophet in the new
[1:11:18] testament age
[1:11:19] if you will and what are you gonna fight
[1:11:21] this devil with but the revelation that
[1:11:23] come to us through amen the messenger of
[1:11:25] the
[1:11:26] hour that she might fly into the
[1:11:28] wilderness
[1:11:30] where into her place listen to what
[1:11:33] david said
[1:11:34] where she is nurse for time times and a
[1:11:37] half time
[1:11:38] from the from the face of the serpent or
[1:11:40] for three and a half years
[1:11:41] amen during the great tribulation period
[1:11:43] the bride has been taken
[1:11:45] amen into her place and the serpent cast
[1:11:49] out of his mouth
[1:11:50] water as a flood after the woman that he
[1:11:52] might cause her to be carried with the
[1:11:53] flood
[1:11:54] and the earth helped the woman and the
[1:11:55] earth opened up her mouth and swallowed
[1:11:57] up the flood which the dragon cast out
[1:11:59] of his mouth
[1:11:59] and the dragon was wrought with the
[1:12:01] woman and went to make war he couldn't
[1:12:03] make war with her anymore because she's
[1:12:04] been raptured
[1:12:05] because she brought forth the life of
[1:12:07] christ right she brought forth a man
[1:12:09] child
[1:12:09] the life of christ that's what the bride
[1:12:11] is doing in this hour
[1:12:13] amen she is him she is bringing forth
[1:12:15] she is christ personified
[1:12:21] amen and the dragon was robbed with a
[1:12:23] woman and went to make war with the
[1:12:25] remnant he got angry at her and went to
[1:12:26] make war with the remnant of her seed
[1:12:30] right not with her but with her seed
[1:12:34] which keep the commandments of god jews
[1:12:36] brother branham said
[1:12:37] and have the testimony of jesus christ
[1:12:39] the foolish virgins
[1:12:41] all right i mean the reason i read that
[1:12:43] to you but you see when satan comes down
[1:12:45] and what he's doing right now in the
[1:12:47] fourth seal and he's bringing in all
[1:12:49] this turmoil around the world
[1:12:51] the bride is being gathered into her
[1:12:54] place
[1:12:55] in the wilderness where satan can't get
[1:12:58] to her at all
[1:13:01] my my my my ain't that good god's got it
[1:13:04] in control
[1:13:08] david ebola in the wilderness and the
[1:13:10] strongholds
[1:13:11] and remained in the mountain in the
[1:13:13] wilderness of seth and saul
[1:13:15] saw him every day but god delivered him
[1:13:18] not
[1:13:18] into his hands saul of course you know
[1:13:20] is a type of the devil
[1:13:22] here he is pressing against saul
[1:13:25] or david excuse me and david goes to the
[1:13:28] strongholds
[1:13:29] that god has provided him in the
[1:13:32] wilderness
[1:13:32] same thing that happens to the bride of
[1:13:35] jesus christ
[1:13:38] strongholds you're gracious brother you
[1:13:42] don't have a clock
[1:13:44] and i don't have a watch and there's no
[1:13:47] preacher sitting behind me to fill my
[1:13:48] shirt tail
[1:13:50] amen strongholds are vital places to
[1:13:55] hold
[1:13:56] in the time of battle in the time of war
[1:14:01] there's a place in israel a little
[1:14:03] village
[1:14:05] called latrine l-a-t-r-u-n
[1:14:10] and if you've ever been to israel you
[1:14:13] landed in tel aviv
[1:14:15] and you traveled to jerusalem you passed
[1:14:19] this little tiny village called latrum
[1:14:22] veteran about 80 some people was always
[1:14:26] the population of this little
[1:14:28] village it intersects
[1:14:31] two major populations of palestinian
[1:14:34] arabs
[1:14:36] could i say could i say muslims
[1:14:39] all right amen you know that which is
[1:14:42] always against the revealed truth
[1:14:45] the israelites when joshua was
[1:14:48] was leading them in battle they defeated
[1:14:51] the amorites at this little place on top
[1:14:53] of this mountain
[1:14:55] called latrine that's in joshua chapter
[1:14:58] 10 by the way
[1:14:59] i mean afterwards we begin to follow
[1:15:01] history and we find out that
[1:15:03] when the turks or the were in control
[1:15:05] there in in that land in palestine
[1:15:08] amen they built a fortress and a
[1:15:11] monastery
[1:15:12] on this ancient road which was also the
[1:15:15] road to emmaus
[1:15:16] so you realize it's got a it's got
[1:15:19] connotations of being a
[1:15:21] favorite place with the lord amen
[1:15:25] after the british took over they
[1:15:27] converted this
[1:15:29] monastery this fortress into a
[1:15:32] police station amen and then
[1:15:35] when the war of independence in 1948 was
[1:15:39] fought
[1:15:42] the arab league the arab legion
[1:15:46] took control of this little tiny village
[1:15:50] and this little monastery well you look
[1:15:52] at the pictures of it it's not really
[1:15:54] a real small place but it's a big
[1:15:56] monastery and a real plus
[1:15:58] kind of like our church in fort smith
[1:16:00] you know a great big building a
[1:16:01] small congregation you don't pay
[1:16:04] attention to the building you look at
[1:16:05] what's going on inside the building
[1:16:07] right
[1:16:09] amen last month when i was going up to
[1:16:11] minneapolis my wife and i was going to
[1:16:13] take a vacation up on the north shore
[1:16:15] word got out around fort smith oh this
[1:16:18] they're going to fly into minneapolis
[1:16:21] you know they people coming to us that
[1:16:23] you ought to be careful going
[1:16:25] into that city you ought to be careful
[1:16:29] and i told them that in there on a
[1:16:31] saturday night in good shepherd
[1:16:32] fellowship
[1:16:34] on sunday morning rather i said we were
[1:16:37] told that
[1:16:38] but they didn't see what god was doing
[1:16:41] in good shepherd fellowship
[1:16:43] and they didn't see that a young man
[1:16:45] named joshua was going to be baptized on
[1:16:47] sunday morning
[1:16:48] and they didn't see that joshua was
[1:16:50] already bringing in
[1:16:51] amen friends with him to hear the gospel
[1:16:53] of christ
[1:16:55] and they didn't see the love and amen
[1:16:57] the companionship
[1:16:58] and and the way that little congregation
[1:17:00] is fighting against
[1:17:02] the devil the only thing they're getting
[1:17:04] is what satan is doing
[1:17:06] amen but god had a focus on a smaller
[1:17:09] place
[1:17:10] can you say amen he had focus on
[1:17:13] a few people amen that are bound
[1:17:15] together for one purpose
[1:17:17] and that is to bring jesus christ on the
[1:17:19] scene
[1:17:22] the british converted this monastery
[1:17:25] into a police station
[1:17:28] and then when the war of independence
[1:17:30] was fought in 1948
[1:17:32] the arab legion controlled
[1:17:36] the stronghold called latrin from this
[1:17:40] perch from this high city in this small
[1:17:43] place
[1:17:44] when the jews were trying to get
[1:17:47] supplies
[1:17:48] to the jews the israeli government was
[1:17:50] trying to get supplies to the jews
[1:17:52] in jerusalem the arabs sitting in this
[1:17:55] stronghold
[1:17:57] stopped every caravan you say amen
[1:18:01] they would not let supplies get up this
[1:18:04] road and it's the only way to go from
[1:18:06] tel aviv to jerusalem
[1:18:08] is by this stronghold and it's high and
[1:18:10] lift it up
[1:18:11] and the the palestinian or the arabs
[1:18:13] held it and they would not
[1:18:15] let convoys get through
[1:18:19] so the israeli leaders what must we do
[1:18:23] what can we do five times they tried to
[1:18:26] take that stronghold
[1:18:28] and they couldn't five times they
[1:18:31] assaulted it
[1:18:32] and were beat back amen so one of them
[1:18:35] devised a plan
[1:18:36] let's make an alternate route let's go
[1:18:39] in a way that they don't think that we
[1:18:41] can go
[1:18:42] let's go across this rough terrain if
[1:18:44] you've ever seen it
[1:18:45] amen you know what i'm talking about
[1:18:47] let's go away that they don't think that
[1:18:49] we can go
[1:18:50] and let's get some supplies to our
[1:18:52] brothers
[1:18:53] amen over there in jerusalem you
[1:18:56] understand what i'm trying to say church
[1:18:58] amen when satan is battling against you
[1:19:01] god's got a plan to bring you through it
[1:19:04] when satan has heaped all that he can
[1:19:06] even up against you god's got a plan to
[1:19:09] get you through it
[1:19:11] amen just watch israel
[1:19:16] amen the israeli leaders knew
[1:19:20] that this stronghold had to be taken
[1:19:24] you see they could get some supplies
[1:19:26] through
[1:19:27] they could get some water rations
[1:19:29] through
[1:19:30] but they couldn't get enough to their
[1:19:32] brethren in jerusalem
[1:19:34] they could get a little bit of water and
[1:19:37] they could get a
[1:19:38] little bit of food but they couldn't get
[1:19:40] enough for the whole population
[1:19:43] so the israeli leaders amen said we've
[1:19:46] got to come up with a plan
[1:19:48] and they did the bypass
[1:19:52] now remember five separate times
[1:19:55] this fledgling little army of
[1:19:58] israel assaulted this stronghold
[1:20:01] amen where the enemy had held it for
[1:20:04] eons of time
[1:20:06] amen
[1:20:10] again and again and again
[1:20:14] the arab legion drove the attackers away
[1:20:20] just before the 1967
[1:20:23] war the president nassar of
[1:20:27] egypt decided that we are going to go to
[1:20:31] war we
[1:20:32] are headed for war with israel we're
[1:20:34] going to have war
[1:20:36] and he said i know where the focus is
[1:20:39] going to be
[1:20:40] so i'm going to send reinforce i'm going
[1:20:42] to send egyptian soldiers
[1:20:44] to reinforce the arabs there at latron
[1:20:48] amen and nasser did just exactly that
[1:20:50] just before
[1:20:52] amen the 1967 war i want you to know
[1:20:54] something church
[1:20:55] satan's not ignorant of the day that we
[1:20:57] live in
[1:20:58] can you say amen he's not ignorant he
[1:21:01] knows what he's doing
[1:21:03] he's had 6 000 years of practice
[1:21:07] and all this time this ride of jesus
[1:21:10] christ
[1:21:10] has been circulating circumventing him
[1:21:13] and bringing the little bride of jesus
[1:21:15] christ
[1:21:16] what she needed in the hour that she was
[1:21:18] living in
[1:21:19] you say amen but today
[1:21:22] we've got full seven course i'm in
[1:21:25] deliverance of the gospel of jesus
[1:21:27] christ
[1:21:30] amen
[1:21:33] the six-day war came in 1967
[1:21:39] latrin was captured by the israeli
[1:21:41] defense forces
[1:21:43] for 20 years from 1948
[1:21:46] until 1967 actually 19 years
[1:21:49] amen but from 1948 until 1967
[1:21:53] 20 years oh man
[1:21:56] amen the arabs had tormented the
[1:21:59] israelis
[1:22:00] for 20 years they held this stronghold
[1:22:04] they refused to let supplies get through
[1:22:07] to jerusalem
[1:22:08] but brother when it was god's time can
[1:22:11] somebody say amen
[1:22:13] oh it may look like satan's got the
[1:22:15] upper hand right now
[1:22:16] but when it's god's time can you say
[1:22:19] amen
[1:22:20] he knows just as god knows just as sure
[1:22:24] as the day is long when this bride
[1:22:27] is going to stand in her place and
[1:22:30] undefeated
[1:22:31] by the power of the evil one
[1:22:35] amen you see the strategic
[1:22:39] importance of controlling
[1:22:42] the strongholds the arabs for 20 years
[1:22:46] held what the jews in jerusalem needed
[1:22:50] but the 1966 war amen
[1:22:54] one more time oh hallelujah
[1:22:57] one more time amen i want you to know
[1:23:00] something
[1:23:01] some of these battles ariel sharon was
[1:23:03] there you know who he was
[1:23:04] amen mercy diane the one the one-eyed
[1:23:07] general i mean you know he was there
[1:23:09] also
[1:23:09] as a matter of fact errol cerrone was
[1:23:11] wounded amen taking this
[1:23:14] fortress
[1:23:17] one last time
[1:23:21] the israeli leader said we
[1:23:24] must take latrine
[1:23:27] now listen listen to listen to what they
[1:23:30] begin to
[1:23:31] implant if we don't win this war that's
[1:23:34] coming the 1967 war
[1:23:36] if we don't win it listen if we don't
[1:23:39] win it
[1:23:40] it'll be just like it was in hitler's
[1:23:44] ovens you see it'll be just like it was
[1:23:48] in the days when amen moses before moses
[1:23:52] let us out of egypt kept egyptian
[1:23:54] captivity it's going to go
[1:23:55] back to that time if we don't take it
[1:23:58] this time
[1:24:00] you know what the israeli leaders did
[1:24:02] this last time
[1:24:03] they implanted thoughts into
[1:24:07] the minds of their hebrew soldiers
[1:24:10] if you don't take this fortress
[1:24:13] hallelujah if you don't rise up and take
[1:24:17] this
[1:24:17] fortress your sons and daughters are
[1:24:20] going to become
[1:24:21] captives in the land again
[1:24:24] that's why amen that's why church
[1:24:28] you're seeing a ministry rise up in this
[1:24:30] hour the ministry is not here in this
[1:24:32] hour so much
[1:24:33] amen for condemnation amen but to lift
[1:24:36] us up
[1:24:37] even tell me who i am even show me my
[1:24:39] position in the word of god
[1:24:41] show me what god wants out of me
[1:24:47] i was going to preach tonight on
[1:24:50] nicknames
[1:24:52] and i come in here and i stood out there
[1:24:55] and watched the camera
[1:24:56] and i said i better change my message
[1:24:59] amen because i saw young men playing
[1:25:01] music and
[1:25:03] and and tape systems set up
[1:25:07] i'm going to change my i'm not going to
[1:25:08] talk about nicknames i'm going to talk
[1:25:10] about overcomers
[1:25:14] maybe nicknames later sometime
[1:25:18] i don't know how long i've been up here
[1:25:22] but i got an important question here to
[1:25:24] ask you now
[1:25:26] how many years
[1:25:32] has satan had a stronghold
[1:25:36] threatening your security by your
[1:25:38] imaginations
[1:25:43] how many years has satan threatened
[1:25:48] your home
[1:25:51] your health
[1:25:54] and your church just simply
[1:25:58] by imaginations
[1:26:01] we can't
[1:26:05] the mighty church of ephesus i believe
[1:26:07] was 12 people
[1:26:09] and they did because they had a
[1:26:12] stronghold
[1:26:13] he called the word of god
[1:26:17] a writer that i was reading this after
[1:26:21] about this history he said
[1:26:24] don't you think it's about time that we
[1:26:27] captured satan's strongholds
[1:26:31] huh don't you think it's about time that
[1:26:33] the word of god the ministry of the
[1:26:36] hour pulls down those imaginations
[1:26:40] don't you think it's about time amen
[1:26:43] that the ministry of the word of god and
[1:26:45] i'm not talking just about preachers but
[1:26:46] i'm talking about the word of god
[1:26:48] amen it reinforces the thought pattern
[1:26:51] the bride of jesus christ
[1:26:52] this one last time this one last battle
[1:26:56] amen it says go forth from here amen and
[1:26:59] pull down
[1:26:59] satan's strongholds and defeat him with
[1:27:03] every imagination that he brings
[1:27:05] and every argument that he's got against
[1:27:08] you
[1:27:08] i mean pull him down
[1:27:13] when he wants you to feel defeated want
[1:27:14] you to think defeat
[1:27:20] turn him into the book of revelation
[1:27:23] i didn't say turn there excuse me i said
[1:27:25] turn him
[1:27:27] over to the book of revelation
[1:27:30] and you ever realize what revelation 1 1
[1:27:33] says
[1:27:34] the revelation of jesus christ
[1:27:38] right that's not the revelation of john
[1:27:42] it's a revelation of jesus christ which
[1:27:45] god
[1:27:46] gave unto him brother one is preaching
[1:27:49] on this by
[1:27:50] this series which god gave unto him
[1:27:54] to show unto his servants
[1:27:57] now those servants we understand becomes
[1:28:00] seven
[1:28:01] church age messengers things which must
[1:28:04] shortly
[1:28:05] come to pass the beginning of the church
[1:28:09] ages
[1:28:10] not the end of the church ages but the
[1:28:12] church ages was to begin
[1:28:15] shortly right things which must shortly
[1:28:19] come to pass and he sent and signified
[1:28:22] it or gave authority
[1:28:24] to the revelation by his servant
[1:28:29] excuse me by his angel
[1:28:32] which translates to prophet unto his
[1:28:35] servant john
[1:28:38] which translates to the bride is that
[1:28:41] what brother brahm said
[1:28:42] amen angel there is prophet john becomes
[1:28:45] the bride in relationship to this angel
[1:28:48] amen so who is this revelation of jesus
[1:28:50] christ for
[1:28:51] it comes all the way down from god
[1:28:53] through jesus christ
[1:28:55] through seven church age messengers and
[1:28:57] it's given to the bride
[1:29:00] is that right revelation 1 8
[1:29:05] jesus christ identifying his own self
[1:29:08] he said i am alpha and omega
[1:29:14] the almighty is how he ends revelation 1
[1:29:17] 8.
[1:29:18] i am alpha and omega the beginning in
[1:29:19] the end
[1:29:21] right the first and the last
[1:29:25] the almighty a christ
[1:29:29] identifies his position
[1:29:32] he says i am the almighty
[1:29:36] now you realize the whole book of
[1:29:37] revelation ends up
[1:29:39] if you go over to revelation 22 17.
[1:29:43] amen right or revelation 22 16 is again
[1:29:47] amen where jesus christ is showing that
[1:29:50] angel
[1:29:50] amen the power of himself jesus christ
[1:29:54] shows that last church age messenger
[1:29:57] reveals
[1:29:58] and all that he is through that seventh
[1:30:00] church age messenger
[1:30:01] and revelation 22 17 says and the spirit
[1:30:04] and the bride say come you realize in
[1:30:08] this our church the bride of jesus
[1:30:10] christ
[1:30:10] amen it's not going to be hidden behind
[1:30:13] amen some facade
[1:30:15] of religion but she's going to stand out
[1:30:18] very boldly highlighted in this hour
[1:30:20] that there is an entity on the face of
[1:30:23] the earth and that has taken the word of
[1:30:25] god
[1:30:25] into her bosom she has eaten the word of
[1:30:28] god and becomes the word of god manifest
[1:30:32] i see that you believe it
[1:30:35] satan don't want you to have that
[1:30:37] stronghold so he fights every way he can
[1:30:40] to bring it down
[1:30:44] a stronghold i'm going to try to wrap up
[1:30:46] now
[1:30:47] is only as strong as the person
[1:30:50] inside of the stronghold right at latrin
[1:30:55] that building could do nothing
[1:30:58] it was just there an inanimate object it
[1:31:01] could
[1:31:02] do nothing it took people
[1:31:05] inside to operate the weapons
[1:31:10] that stopped the convoys amen the
[1:31:13] stronghold
[1:31:14] is only as strong as the people that's
[1:31:17] inside
[1:31:17] of the stronghold to keep control
[1:31:22] now watch they were keeping the jews in
[1:31:26] jerusalem from having
[1:31:28] water and food and weapons
[1:31:31] but they had to be supplied themselves
[1:31:34] are you with me you realize the men
[1:31:37] inside that fortress had to have
[1:31:39] supplies themselves
[1:31:41] and if they didn't get supplies all
[1:31:45] israel had to do was cut off the
[1:31:46] supplies
[1:31:49] if we quit feeding satan amen if we quit
[1:31:51] giving him room
[1:31:53] even if we take away from him his
[1:31:55] imaginations
[1:31:56] and his arguments in his life if we tear
[1:31:58] down his stronghold if we
[1:32:00] feast on the unfailing body word of the
[1:32:02] son of man
[1:32:03] we will absolutely starve him
[1:32:06] out
[1:32:10] you realize the holy ghost feasts on the
[1:32:12] word of god
[1:32:13] he loves to eat the word of god oh this
[1:32:16] bride of jesus christ begins
[1:32:18] eating the revelation that pertains to
[1:32:24] her
[1:32:26] strongholds can be controlled on the
[1:32:29] spiritual level
[1:32:30] by demons or by the holy spirit
[1:32:35] what a stronghold actually is
[1:32:38] in the spiritual realm is a habitual
[1:32:42] pattern of thought
[1:32:46] do you ever hear the scripture out of
[1:32:48] the abundance of the heart
[1:32:49] the mouth speaks that's in matthew 12 by
[1:32:53] the way
[1:32:54] matthew 12 35 jesus said a good man
[1:32:57] out of the good treasure of the heart
[1:33:00] bringeth forth
[1:33:01] good things and an evil man out of the
[1:33:04] evil treasure
[1:33:05] brings forth evil things
[1:33:10] i am what i think i am
[1:33:15] what i speak that i am
[1:33:19] [Music]
[1:33:20] amen
[1:33:22] satan has a battle on souls satan has a
[1:33:24] battle on families satan has a battle on
[1:33:26] the church
[1:33:28] but i'm not feasting on defeat
[1:33:32] i'm feasting not on a man
[1:33:36] but on the unfailing can somebody say
[1:33:39] that word
[1:33:40] unfailing body word
[1:33:43] of the son of man right unfair what does
[1:33:46] unfailing mean
[1:33:47] it can't fail amen
[1:33:51] what it's supposed to do it will do what
[1:33:53] the what the body word of the son of man
[1:33:56] is supposed to do it will do what is the
[1:33:58] body word of the son of man
[1:34:00] the revelation of jesus christ
[1:34:05] now as paul taught
[1:34:09] some were accusing him of walking in the
[1:34:12] flesh
[1:34:15] amen and paul
[1:34:18] just goes on in their own talk and says
[1:34:22] i'll just correct their errors with the
[1:34:24] word
[1:34:28] and what's the way he goes about it
[1:34:32] he destroyed what satan was attempting
[1:34:35] to do satan was attempting to destroy
[1:34:39] the work of god lord i'm just in time
[1:34:43] my battery just went dead so
[1:34:46] that's the battery in this
[1:34:50] it just went dead so anything else
[1:34:54] beyond this

[1:34:58] shut up preacher
[1:35:01] amen you understand casting down
[1:35:06] imaginations and every high
[1:35:09] thing that exalts itself
[1:35:12] against the knowledge of christ

[1:35:19] tonight
[1:35:20] i am what i think i am

[1:35:54] in my own stronghold i amen

[1:36:07] brethren when the accuser
[1:36:09] of the brethren is cast down can you say

[1:36:25] demonic powers
