[20:45] glad to have you tonight God is good to
[20:49] us I'm just gonna get right into the
[20:52] Word of God as you would turn with me
[21:06] James 1:17 we have our brother Jack Duff
[21:16] coming this weekend
[21:19] don't forget by God's grace we have
[21:22] service here it's at six o'clock on
[21:25] Saturday and then four o'clock on Sunday
[21:29] evening Sunday morning he'll be
[21:31] ministering down in Iowa City okay okay
[21:41] let us read the scripture James 1:17
[21:44] please every good gift and every perfect
[21:49] gift is from above and cometh down from
[21:54] the Father of lights with whom is no
[21:57] variableness neither shadow of turning
[22:08] Hebrew 11 please
[22:18] we are still working with somewhat with
[22:23] in my father's house we realized by
[22:27] God's grace that it's just to me
[22:30] inexhaustible they're just so much that
[22:35] we can say and we could look into when
[22:39] it comes to the Word of God Hebrews 11 1
[22:43] 2 3 now faith is the substance of things
[22:46] hoped for the evidence of things not
[22:49] seen for by it the elders obtained a
[22:54] good report through faith we understand
[22:57] that the worlds were framed by the Word
[23:01] of God so that things which are seen
[23:05] were not made of things which do appear
[23:09] let us pray father we thank you for your
[23:14] grace and your mercy we thank you for
[23:17] being so good to us
[23:19] we pray father God that your blessings
[23:24] will be upon the people tonight forgive
[23:27] us of our sins and our shortcomings
[23:29] anything we may have said or done that
[23:32] haven't been pleasing into your sight
[23:34] Lord continue to bless your church Lord
[23:39] give us grace to continue to grow into
[23:42] your image father we'll be careful to
[23:45] give you the praise glory and honor in
[23:47] Jesus Christ's name we pray amen
[23:49] you may be seated
[23:57] as we could say it's been a series
[24:01] preparing for the new world you and I
[24:05] understand by God's grace that there are
[24:08] or there is how we want to say it two
[24:11] worlds and we know by God's grace that
[24:15] these worlds are different the ones that
[24:19] we have been speaking of one world is
[24:22] above and the other world is beneath and
[24:26] we understand by God's grace that when
[24:30] it came to this world this world came
[24:33] into a fallen state by way of Adam and
[24:36] Eve and if we express before Adam never
[24:40] did complete the will of God
[24:44] replenished the earth but it was in the
[24:47] image of Adam and not in the image of
[24:49] God and all men are created in the image
[24:53] of the fallen Adam but then yet God word
[24:58] cannot come back void so God made a way
[25:01] and of course this is where Jesus comes
[25:05] in because the fall first Adam calls us
[25:09] to fall and the second Adam redeemed us
[25:12] from the fall and you and I realized by
[25:15] God's grace that when Jesus came he
[25:19] constantly told us that he was not of
[25:23] this world and that well he was from a
[25:26] different place he also instructed his
[25:30] disciples and he told them that when I
[25:35] said like brother varlyn said he he
[25:38] preached his own funeral when it came to
[25:40] Saint John 14 he said let not your heart
[25:44] be troubled is that right if you believe
[25:48] in God believe also in me
[25:49] I go away to prepare a place for you
[25:53] that where I am there you may be also so
[25:57] he told us by God's grace even in his
[26:00] message that there would be a place that
[26:02] he will be would be preparing for us so
[26:08] we understand by God's grace this is why
[26:10] it gives us understanding why the first
[26:14] world was destroyed because we
[26:17] understand that the sons of God saw the
[26:21] daughters of men that they were fair and
[26:23] they multiplied so much so the Bible
[26:28] tells our thinking Genesis 6 chapter
[26:30] that the world multiplied in such a way
[26:33] and violence was everywhere and men saw
[26:36] women and you know how that goes and and
[26:39] we know now that that state has repeated
[26:45] itself and so God destroyed that world
[26:49] Enoch was the only one perfect man that
[26:52] literally escaped the judgment of God
[26:55] nor a man being a righteous seed was the
[26:59] only one that escaped by way of the
[27:02] tribulation and you and I understand by
[27:05] God's grace that that was by water God
[27:08] destroyed it
[27:10] that was the stage of justification we
[27:13] know that
[27:13] and then God sanctified the earth
[27:16] through the blood of Jesus Christ but
[27:18] even in sanctification by blood they're
[27:24] their steer had to be a sanctification
[27:26] by fire because fire is the greatest
[27:30] purifier it burns everything away even
[27:36] in the future home brother Branham said
[27:37] that fire amen
[27:39] the earth going through a fire baptism
[27:41] is it a light figure of the man the
[27:45] human being that needs to go through
[27:47] that fire baptism that will burn all the
[27:51] demons away so you and I know that Jesus
[27:55] Christ when he comes the Bible tells us
[27:58] when he comes and raptures us a way that
[28:01] we will be caught up to meet him in the
[28:04] air so I told you by God's grace in the
[28:07] last few messages that how Adam did not
[28:12] complete so when God's seed would would
[28:16] die a fall asleep God had already
[28:20] prepared a place for them those who are
[28:24] Christ is that right resurrected at the
[28:29] crucifixion of Jesus Christ because they
[28:32] believed on him that was to come they
[28:37] did the sacrifice of the Lamb they
[28:39] trusted that and by faith they became
[28:44] victors through Jesus Christ
[28:46] victory on Calvary now we understand
[28:49] that Jesus according to the prophet God
[28:52] said that when when Lucifer or the devil
[28:56] offered up Jesus said listen during that
[29:00] time of his fasting I give you all of
[29:03] this and when he when he when he told oh
[29:07] Jesus I'll give you all he had a right
[29:10] you know because he won that battle and
[29:14] Adam forfeited the world and Satan or
[29:18] Lucifer he owned it per se right so when
[29:23] he offered this to Jesus he refused it
[29:27] because he knew eventually it was going
[29:29] to be here come on somebody now you and
[29:33] I know the new world is another world it
[29:38] cannot be like this
[29:39] this world is what we would call the
[29:43] negative it is the shadow of the real
[29:47] thing and you and I must understand that
[29:49] in this shadow you got death sickness
[29:54] pain age time becomes a ruler over the
[30:01] mortal man but in the world to come time
[30:06] is done away with we come to a place
[30:09] where it is eternity and and in listen
[30:14] ass
[30:15] we had to be prepared is that right the
[30:18] Prophet God said our coming here was
[30:21] prepared God didn't just send you here
[30:26] by mistake
[30:27] that's why I read that scripture every
[30:31] good and perfect gift comes from the
[30:35] Lord hallelujah
[30:37] and so you and I must understand that
[30:39] because we have gifts amen doesn't mean
[30:42] we become Christians but every good and
[30:46] perfect gifts come from God and so you
[30:50] and I know that these gifts come to us
[30:53] without repentance the gift and calling
[30:56] of God hallelujah so you and I know that
[31:00] what God is doing and and that's what
[31:03] the devil didn't understand she even the
[31:06] psalmist said that Jesus Christ would
[31:09] die and they said but who would declare
[31:14] his generation he said I'm saying in
[31:17] other words there would come a
[31:19] generation that would be will declare
[31:23] the seed of God
[31:25] because the first Adam was earthly and
[31:28] the second Adam is the quickening spirit
[31:31] who is a lord of heaven the
[31:34] understanding so this is why Jesus said
[31:37] unto Nicodemus in order to go over
[31:41] yonder you must be born again because
[31:44] that which is fresh is a flesh but that
[31:47] which is of spirit in spirit hallelujah
[31:50] and remember even Jesus said be ye
[31:54] perfect even as your father which is in
[31:57] heaven is perfect but there is nothing
[32:00] in this world that is perfect somebody
[32:06] help me here so you and I must
[32:07] understand there are worlds there are
[32:11] worlds and more than just two but there
[32:13] are worlds and these worlds are
[32:15] dimensional hallelujah is that right
[32:19] because heaven and earth is basically in
[32:24] the same place but of a different
[32:28] dimension somebody help me here is that
[32:31] the truth
[32:32] that is so true it's not a million miles
[32:35] away hallelujah the Bible said don't say
[32:38] God is up in heaven don't say God is far
[32:41] away the Bible said that God is near
[32:44] thee even in you even in your mouth
[32:50] so we're dealing with people and this is
[32:53] what we are supposed to understand faith
[32:56] if I've said is the substance of things
[32:58] hoped for the evidence of things not
[33:00] seen
[33:01] so faith is able to call those things
[33:04] let me say it like this
[33:08] Einstein discovered a lot of things by
[33:13] way of science Newton discovered laws of
[33:19] gravity motions for every action there's
[33:22] an opposite but equal reaction and
[33:25] highest Stein discovered what we call
[33:28] the quantum theory because they thought
[33:31] that light was some like ways but in
[33:36] their discovery they found out that
[33:38] light was not just in waves but little
[33:41] particles of energy that's able to move
[33:49] it's able to change things for example I
[33:54] can look at something and because of the
[33:57] light reflection it might be read to me
[34:00] but where you standing it could be a
[34:04] different color and that's what they
[34:07] call relativity but the point I'm trying
[34:10] to make is Jesus already told us about
[34:13] it it's already in the word Jesus said
[34:19] tell me Pharisees you're so smart how
[34:21] can the Son of Man be standing here on
[34:25] earth and in heaven at the same time
[34:29] hallelujah brother brown this is in the
[34:34] theory of relativity you can't you can't
[34:38] go you can go but so far but you can't
[34:40] go back to where you started because
[34:44] time and space changes that right
[34:48] for instance whatever time it is now 10
[34:51] minutes I say 10 minutes to 8:00 if I
[34:53] moved this way right I come up to
[34:58] another time
[34:59] what about trying to go back to the time
[35:02] in which I started is in power
[35:04] possible because that time has now
[35:06] become my pass hallelujah but with God
[35:11] all things are possible hallelujah God
[35:15] will art God for you and me will always
[35:18] defy his old laws is that right
[35:22] but what there's a law about gravity if
[35:25] you throw something up gravity is going
[35:27] to put it down but then God defies his
[35:30] own law with you and me by just raising
[35:35] your hand you just defied gravity
[35:38] hallelujah and you must understand that
[35:41] God even defies his law when it comes to
[35:46] relativity he's the creator and God does
[35:50] what he wants to do hallelujah why space
[35:53] why astronauts are trying their best
[35:57] amen tu tu tu tu ah vindicate time
[36:02] travel we know time travel come on
[36:09] somebody because you and I must
[36:11] understand it meant that time travel has
[36:14] always been it's not something that God
[36:17] created is that right
[36:20] God in His Word prophesied that Jesus
[36:24] who was in eternity was going to come
[36:27] down and be a son of a virgin hallelujah
[36:32] and gods were prophesied he would die
[36:36] and he would raise again and go back up
[36:41] hallelujah come on somebody and you got
[36:45] to understand but he was the only one
[36:47] that can go back in time is that right
[36:53] oh come on somebody you said well how
[36:55] could he be here and there at the same
[36:57] time you've got a positive and a
[37:02] negative let me read what the prophet of
[37:04] God says is this okay so you can
[37:10] understand he says what you are here is
[37:13] what is a reflection of what you are
[37:16] somewhere
[37:19] hallelujah you can't be reflecting
[37:22] excuse me for sailing like this you
[37:24] can't be reflecting hell and be in
[37:27] heavenly places you understand me
[37:32] so you got to understand that these two
[37:34] lines these two things exist on the
[37:39] plane whatever you're doing here you're
[37:42] doing there you say well what do you
[37:44] mean brother Brooks you see my shadow if
[37:47] I had a shower and you could see it
[37:49] whatever I'm doing my shadow is doing it
[37:51] at the same time hallelujah
[37:58] so you and I must understand Amen that
[38:01] the work is right let me go home with
[38:06] this now so you can understand amen
[38:09] here we had a time traveler in our own
[38:12] in our day Paul was a time traveler
[38:19] hallelujah he said I went into the
[38:22] heavens and I saw things that were
[38:25] unlawful to tell and then he came back
[38:28] down to earth
[38:30] hallelujah brother Brad was a time
[38:33] traveler he God lifted him up and he
[38:37] says I went behind the curtain up high
[38:39] and I saw you there I wasn't even born
[38:45] yet but I was there in stir - he said I
[38:52] saw you there somebody help me here so
[38:58] you can understand that God defies his
[39:00] own laws for you how can you not believe
[39:04] in the rapture
[39:04] oh come on somebody you and I know that
[39:10] God is the only one they can bring
[39:13] something good out of something that is
[39:15] bad now let me move on by God's grace
[39:21] because I want you to understand Amen
[39:24] here uh-huh-huh-huh let me say so he
[39:30] said let me just read this finish
[39:31] reading
[39:32] he said those who he justified he he has
[39:35] glorified wait a minute now he justified
[39:39] me and he's already glorified me but I'm
[39:42] still moving toward glorification
[39:47] hallelujah amen so let me say it like
[39:51] this too so you and I can understand
[39:53] that this is not a mistake
[39:56] it was pre-planned everything about you
[40:01] is pre playing hallelujah
[40:04] it doesn't take the equation of
[40:05] repentance away hallelujah
[40:09] it doesn't take the equation of
[40:11] confessing away but God knew you would
[40:14] confess God knew you would repent you
[40:18] know I didn't understand it just just a
[40:20] week or so ago I had an experience with
[40:22] the Lord and God took me in a in my own
[40:25] mind how he want to say it back to some
[40:27] decisions I made in life and he showed
[40:30] me the decisions that I made was the
[40:32] decisions that determine the path I made
[40:34] but I walked rather but I couldn't I had
[40:38] the opportunity to decide something
[40:41] different but I didn't do it maybe
[40:44] because of fear maybe because of pride
[40:47] whatever it was I didn't I didn't make
[40:50] those choices but guarding you that the
[40:54] choices I made he was going to work it
[40:57] toward my good cheek to me it could have
[41:02] been a bad choice but with God your
[41:06] choice because you are predestinated
[41:08] it's not bad you said what explain that
[41:16] to me God had already prepared a fish
[41:20] for Jonah because God knew Jonah's
[41:24] decision hallelujah somebody help me
[41:29] here all things work together for the
[41:31] good of them that love God God will
[41:34] always bring in our we're on the journey
[41:41] is that okay
[41:43] time travel now I'm just saying space
[41:47] and time because God defies gravity for
[41:52] you and I gravity holds you would tell
[41:56] me how was he how was Phillip at a
[42:02] meeting and then God transports him
[42:07] hallelujah teleported they're trying to
[42:12] find all of these things and it's all
[42:14] that they're looking for is right in
[42:17] here every answers in the book this is
[42:21] your this is my birth certificate
[42:23] written this is your birth certificate
[42:27] written hallelujah and if we can see
[42:34] that this thing we says I go to prepare
[42:37] a place for you you heard me say this
[42:40] before before those twelve apostles knew
[42:44] the head Thrones God had them there
[42:47] already
[42:51] hallelujah and before you and I knew we
[42:55] had mansions we didn't know it we didn't
[42:58] even know what the mansions were we
[43:01] thought there was no castles or little
[43:02] houses and everything else
[43:03] brother Brown said those mansions are
[43:05] your bodies your new bodies in my kit is
[43:10] that right because when he went beyond
[43:12] the curtain of time he didn't see houses
[43:15] he saw human beings he said where are
[43:21] their houses yeah but that's not what
[43:25] God was talking about when he says I go
[43:29] to prepare a place for you that's what
[43:30] the prophecy seek God has a glorified
[43:34] body he has a body that's made just for
[43:38] you hallelujah he said what do you mean
[43:41] brother Brooks this is not the real you
[43:43] the real you is on the inside you lived
[43:47] in this house this house is getting old
[43:52] leaking right
[43:55] like that song say I need a new building
[43:58] this one is falling apart but over there
[44:03] there's a house there's a body whose
[44:07] builder and maker is God what were you
[44:16] saying
[44:17] that's why it's so important that you
[44:18] feeling a pool you understand me all of
[44:23] us are battling Satan hey man
[44:26] hell and earth is blending hallelujah
[44:30] and we're feeling the effects of it but
[44:33] at the same time no darkness gonna keep
[44:37] a true child of God in bondage
[44:41] help us Lord so that will understand I
[44:46] read it like the Prophet says he said
[44:49] there's a channel like this and that's
[44:52] where mortal lives in here he said in
[44:55] the conglomeration of gaiety and
[44:57] blackness and sin and every once in a
[45:00] while you will see a little white spot
[45:04] or a light so in this you are reflecting
[45:13] light in a dark world and it's only a
[45:18] few of us in all of this only a few of
[45:24] us are reflecting the light of God this
[45:28] is why he said ye are the light of the
[45:30] world I don't see no light you don't see
[45:33] the cosmic light in you either but
[45:36] brother Branham said when the Holy Ghost
[45:37] comes in you it go away with the cosmic
[45:40] light and he reflects the eternal light
[45:44] which is God Himself out of you
[45:48] that's why amen this copies light can't
[45:51] keep us from dying not that every seven
[45:55] years you lose something hallelujah but
[45:58] with the light of God you never lose
[46:02] cause he said I'll never leave you nor
[46:04] will I forsake you which world are you
[46:08] from
[46:09] where are you going what's pulling you
[46:13] because right now you either feeling a
[46:15] pull downward or you're feeling a pull
[46:17] upward hallelujah you understand me
[46:22] and if you don't resist the put down
[46:25] multiple that's where you're going
[46:29] hallelujah but the thing that gets me is
[46:32] when Jesus declared he says I have no
[46:35] darkness in me Oh every time I think
[46:40] about that I think about myself if I am
[46:44] in Christ he has no darkness if you are
[46:48] in Christ you can't be darkness and
[46:51] light at the same time he's somebody
[46:57] help me here so what are you saying
[47:00] you and I have a job in this
[47:03] dispensation you and I have a job that
[47:06] is to reflect Jesus Christ and him only
[47:10] and that doesn't come by way of
[47:14] knowledge it comes by way of birth
[47:20] hallelujah you've got to be born again
[47:23] hallelujah is all I got the Holy Ghost
[47:26] daddy'd enough that Holy Ghost in you
[47:32] must mature you and I must come into the
[47:36] statue of a perfect mate that does not
[47:39] be the see be perfect for which my
[47:43] father in heaven is perfect everything
[47:46] that goes in the city must be perfect
[47:50] like I said the character of Christ is
[47:55] the only thing that opens the portal
[48:00] right the character of Christ people
[48:04] that oh I'm going I'm gonna just go I'm
[48:06] elected I'm chosen of God let me tell
[48:09] you one thing
[48:10] not one demon went into that city
[48:14] nothing that will defile it hello
[48:18] so if you packin bhima's the best thing
[48:20] to do is to get rid of it
[48:22] is that right that's my brother branham
[48:25] said he said if you don't get rid of the
[48:26] demon that demon is there to destroy you
[48:29] he said destroyed the demon before the
[48:32] demon destroy you right because we
[48:40] remember I told you by the spoken word
[48:43] everything was created I don't know how
[48:46] he did it but I used that word you need
[48:49] verse one verse did it in the beginning
[48:54] God created the heavens in the earth
[48:56] bang hallelujah so you and I must
[49:02] understand by that one god created
[49:05] everything everything you were there I
[49:09] was there before he even saying let us
[49:14] make man we were already there whoa
[49:19] because when he said let us make man
[49:21] that was the beginning of something but
[49:24] inside of him the thought y'all
[49:29] understand me the attributes of him in
[49:33] us we were there that's the scripture
[49:36] the scripture said before the foundation
[49:39] of the world I was there when he said
[49:42] this is I was there when he formed the
[49:45] mountains I was there well why were we
[49:48] we were in him hallelujah before the
[49:52] foundation of the world as I said and
[49:57] I'm not going to be long tonight because
[49:58] it's just segments but I want to say
[49:59] this whatever we reflect here is what
[50:03] we're if reflecting right you can't
[50:06] reflect evil and be in heaven wherever
[50:11] your spirit is is where you what you're
[50:13] going to reflect hallelujah and you and
[50:18] I must understand you say what
[50:20] Brotherhood's how would I ever become
[50:22] holy
[50:22] he made it simple and easy let me say it
[50:25] like this he said Peter upon this rock
[50:28] I'll build my church and the gates of
[50:31] Hell shall not prevail against it I give
[50:35] you the key
[50:36] keys to the kingdom now if Peter was
[50:39] given the keys we think Oh Peter just
[50:41] had uh uh repent and be baptized in the
[50:45] name of Jesus Christ for the remission
[50:47] of your sins and you shall receive the
[50:49] gift of the Holy Ghost that's just the
[50:50] beginning because he had the keys what
[50:54] keys the keys that will unlock the
[50:56] divine nature in you hallelujah that
[51:01] will unlock the divine nature in you and
[51:06] here's a prophet of God said listen the
[51:09] Bible said God made a way of entrance
[51:11] interested to what the kingdom of God
[51:19] hallelujah and we must understand that
[51:24] these virtues is effective at the very
[51:27] divine nature of God these virtues is
[51:30] the very power that got Jesus up out of
[51:33] the grave hallelujah it was the same
[51:38] nature when he said to Mary Martha he
[51:41] said listen he said if you believe you
[51:43] should see I am the resurrection
[51:47] somebody help me here so in order for us
[51:51] to be resurrected we need him only
[51:54] inside of us sometimes these are all the
[51:58] portion of the resurrection is in the
[52:00] bride that's what he said but the voice
[52:02] of the resurrection is not the thing
[52:05] it's a person hallelujah
[52:08] is that right the voice of God walked in
[52:11] the cool of the day then the voice of
[52:14] God identified himself at the grave of
[52:17] Lazarus
[52:18] oh come on somebody is that right so the
[52:22] voice of God is saying listen in order
[52:25] for the resurrection of being you my
[52:27] person must be in you it ain't you some
[52:32] people think oh I - go down to the baby
[52:34] sighs ray huh
[52:35] it'll be Jesus because the bride will
[52:40] not even move until you get a dust say
[52:43] at the Lord it will be the bride Christ
[52:47] in Bride form
[52:49] is that right God in-law say changing
[52:54] his mask that's why I was looking at
[52:57] that quantum theory there's got to be
[52:59] something in the natural that would type
[53:01] us out hallelujah and is those particles
[53:05] of light amen is that right
[53:07] everything is unified hallelujah and
[53:15] they say in those in that theory it
[53:16] seems like those little particles of
[53:18] life has a mind of their own
[53:23] hallelujah ha because in the experiment
[53:26] they knew how they didn't try to
[53:28] penetrate the wood they went between the
[53:32] wood and after they came between the
[53:35] wood guess what folks they gathered back
[53:37] together somebody help me here
[53:40] oh one of these old days will break that
[53:43] veil we'll go behind the veil and
[53:46] there's gonna be a great gathering
[53:48] hallelujah but the light of God once
[53:51] again nothing can't stop it let's go
[53:57] stop it
[53:58] they say these Quantum's they said it's
[54:02] the whole universe everything moves by
[54:05] it
[54:06] hallelujah they don't know that did you
[54:09] know that when you see the Sun that's
[54:12] yesterday the light you seeing is old
[54:20] hallelujah that's why you can see
[54:23] eternity I can see in the past and then
[54:26] the same light shows me the future and
[54:30] I'm in the middle you're right here
[54:34] hallelujah come on somebody no matter
[54:37] what not know nothing can nothing of man
[54:42] can put the Sun out and no matter how we
[54:52] see light we see it equally yes if
[54:56] you've got good eyesight and you gotta
[55:01] understand by God's grace
[55:03] Amen that we are what the Bible sees it
[55:06] children of the light that means there's
[55:09] a big light and there's particles of
[55:11] light Oh God
[55:13] oh that came from that same light call
[55:18] it whatever you want to call it but the
[55:20] Bible is right and scientist is trying
[55:23] to understand what God is doing but
[55:27] they're going to if they if they it
[55:28] continue to exist they're gonna have a
[55:30] hard time finding out where we went to
[55:34] when we disappear but is written
[55:42] hallelujah
[55:43] you gotta believe a change of the body
[55:46] is coming hallelujah
[55:50] a change of the body somehow this
[55:53] supernatural light would overtake this
[55:56] natural body and change it hallelujah
[56:01] when I consider thy heavens the work of
[56:06] thy fingers the moon and the stars with
[56:09] our hands ordained what is man that thou
[56:12] art mindful of him and the son of man
[56:15] that thou visitest made him a little
[56:20] lower than the Angels and has crowned
[56:23] him with glory and honor
[56:26] hallelujah you see what I'm saying when
[56:29] Adam and Eve fell who walked in the cool
[56:31] of the evening Jesus they called him the
[56:35] voice of God but that was Jesus and
[56:37] every time his children get in trouble
[56:40] God sends a prophet Son of Man and Son
[56:46] of Man comes and he straighten out the
[56:48] mess hallelujah and every listen what
[56:52] did the prophet of God do in this last
[56:54] day he brought us back to the altar the
[56:59] real sacrifice hallelujah we can't
[57:03] understand he meant that we're not to
[57:06] bow under organization or denomination
[57:09] but we're to power under the inspiration
[57:12] of the
[57:15] that right it can't change Adam and Eve
[57:20] sacrifice was a lamb it cannot change
[57:23] he's perfect it must always be a lamb
[57:26] you know garden said we're looking at
[57:28] him and Eve you got to do this you got
[57:30] to do that you got to do this you got to
[57:32] do that you got to do this the
[57:33] revelation the revelation of of
[57:37] deliverance the revelation of of of a
[57:40] Hakka descent of salvation came through
[57:44] the sacrifice of a lamb yummy
[57:48] there is no restoration without the lamb
[57:52] that's why John shouted I love it he
[57:56] says heaven and earth hurt I say that's
[57:59] right he didn't say hurt I saying he
[58:02] didn't say heard we saying he said hurt
[58:05] I saying
[58:06] Wow cuz the bride is one hallelujah one
[58:11] she has become the I am teach us how to
[58:19] pray and he said unto him when you pray
[58:23] say Iowa right the devil don't like that
[58:30] because when you say our Father you

[58:37] Father which art in heaven hallowed be
[58:40] thy name thy kingdom come Thy will be
[58:43] done as in heaven so is an earth is that
[58:47] right so you got this is what I get that
[58:50] that's Scripture I always get to me that
[58:52] will be done in earth as it is in heaven
[58:54] in earth as it is in heaven however I'm
[58:58] acting in heaven is way I want to have
[58:59] him on earth yeah come on y'all better
[59:04] understand what I'm saying don't you
[59:06] know in heaven there there you're never
[59:09] find a service that's gonna be
[59:11] ritualistic well they're gonna sing this
[59:15] song today hmm well I can tell you the
[59:20] fourth song they're gonna say it'll
[59:24] never be like that
[59:26] therefore it should never be like this
[59:29] you and I should never be able to come
[59:31] to church and know the order of the
[59:35] service
[59:37] knock knock somebody huh we should never
[59:40] hold this is where it's gonna be in this
[59:42] world and you know every little move
[59:45] that we're gonna make that is not God
[59:50] the early church was full of power
[59:53] they came with expectation because they
[59:58] didn't know which way the Spirit of God
[59:59] will go to move that is the way it's
[1:00:02] supposed to be right now
[1:00:05] heaven will never be boring
[1:00:08] but when you get into a religion a
[1:00:11] ritualistic form and style it becomes
[1:00:14] boring Oh in turn is gates with
[1:00:22] Thanksgiving in ha you gotta enter if
[1:00:25] you come in with praise he'll come down
[1:00:27] and consume the sacrifice it's been a
[1:00:32] long time since I've seen drunkest in
[1:00:34] the church hallelujah power power from
[1:00:43] the kingdom that's what we need power
[1:00:45] from the kingdom Holly Lou yes when
[1:00:49] things get rough God sends down the
[1:00:51] power hallelujah do you think Shadrach
[1:00:55] Meshach and Abednego could have
[1:00:57] overtaken that fire on their own no sir
[1:01:00] when they got in trouble God dispatched
[1:01:02] himself down hallelujah what was it
[1:01:06] time travel he came from eternity
[1:01:10] stopped down in time and with that Cup
[1:01:13] is that right jesus said I came from God
[1:01:16] and I go back to God hallelujah he said
[1:01:19] the only ones who can ascend is those
[1:01:21] who descended hallelujah and you and I
[1:01:25] descended and therefore we will assume
[1:01:31] that right oh it's your truth yeah he
[1:01:37] said Jeremiah I knew you
[1:01:39] before you was even formed hallelujah
[1:01:42] and if God knew Jeremiah he knew you and
[1:01:46] I he knew what we were going through he
[1:01:49] knew every trial he was gonna go through
[1:01:51] so let me tell you like this and guard
[1:01:53] them pre plan your trip what you worried
[1:01:56] about it for he's the booking agent he
[1:02:01] knows every stopping point

[1:02:07] connection you're going to make and have
[1:02:09] to make before you get to heaven he's
[1:02:12] not worried about it you said what do
[1:02:15] you mean this is a return ticket pages a
[1:02:19] one-way his return but you see you got
[1:02:23] to be able to pay the price he paid the
[1:02:28] price but you got to get the ticket how
[1:02:32] do you go get it brother
[1:02:33] you got a die and rot oh come on
[1:02:36] see people don't want they don't want to
[1:02:38] hear that somebody think well you know
[1:02:40] when I get to heaven some parts of me
[1:02:42] it's gonna from here it's gonna be there
[1:02:45] no you got a rot and die the only thing
[1:02:50] that will go with you is the gifts that
[1:02:52] God gave you before you got here uh-huh
[1:02:56] every good and perfect gift
[1:02:59] come from God if God did give to use
[1:03:04] your temperament however you want to say
[1:03:05] it it will go with you
[1:03:07] but you see your temperament would be
[1:03:10] patients looking self we ain't no
[1:03:16] fighting in heaven so all of that gotta
[1:03:20] go I ain't no let nobody walk on me yeah
[1:03:25] if it takes that for me to get to heaven
[1:03:27] walk on me huh
[1:03:34] listen you sure all brothers ain't gonna
[1:03:36] let nobody take advantage of me Jesus
[1:03:39] did and when he was going through the
[1:03:43] trials the Bible did say
[1:03:48] [Laughter]
[1:03:57] his face like a threat
[1:04:00] he knew you and I needed this he did
[1:04:04] everything the right way because he knew
[1:04:07] sometimes we will fail and so therefore
[1:04:11] when we die hallelujah
[1:04:13] there not be one wrinkle one blemish
[1:04:18] nothing against us why because we don't
[1:04:21] get we don't get to heaven on our own
[1:04:23] robe we put on his robe
[1:04:25] we're over ourselves in his
[1:04:27] righteousness hallelujah
[1:04:29] he became I was saying that we might
[1:04:31] become his righteousness but see that
[1:04:35] applies to you when you get the Holy
[1:04:38] Ghost otherwise it's just potential hmm
[1:04:44] after death there is life and a lot of
[1:04:47] people don't realize that it ain't
[1:04:49] finished this is this is a continuing
[1:04:53] huh and in and in and in and how what I
[1:04:58] say it in feces they say I'll continue
[1:05:00] um but this is a continuing hallelujah
[1:05:04] it doesn't stop here come on yeah
[1:05:10] however the tree fall that's the way it
[1:05:13] lay oh you ain't gonna just die sinning
[1:05:17] and wake up a saint it ain't happenin
[1:05:22] hallelujah is a continuation of your
[1:05:26] life here somebody help me here see I
[1:05:31] think some sometimes people don't
[1:05:33] understand if you continue in the way
[1:05:37] you understand me let me say it like
[1:05:39] this there were four crosses on Calvary
[1:05:44] we know of the three
[1:05:46] Jesus and the two thieves but then we
[1:05:52] know there was a fourth one because
[1:05:55] Judas hung himself on a sycamore tree JA
[1:05:59] das cast out Devils good preacher
[1:06:03] hallelujah
[1:06:05] but he betrayed Christ and he hung
[1:06:08] himself on a tree hallelujah and the
[1:06:12] Bible said crisis is the man that hangs
[1:06:15] on the tree oh that he had done casting
[1:06:20] out there was saw the miracles of God
[1:06:23] treasure all that chuck church work
[1:06:29] meant nothing it was all canceled out ha
[1:06:37] because he failed to go to Jesus team
[1:06:41] that gold like I heard somebody said he
[1:06:43] went to the high priest but he went to
[1:06:44] the wrong one had he gone to Jesus
[1:06:48] things may have changed didn't I got out
[1:06:54] offer a cane the same thing he said now
[1:06:57] listen God always give you a chance
[1:06:59] God said King go ahead and do what your
[1:07:01] brother did and I grant you rulership
[1:07:03] over here I said that devil wanted
[1:07:09] rulership and he had it right there but
[1:07:13] he was too prideful to repent if he had
[1:07:17] done in King what God required he would
[1:07:21] have ruled a able but prior to keep you
[1:07:28] from the Holy Ghost proud to keep you
[1:07:31] from doing what God wants you to do and
[1:07:33] pride is not of God huh huh
[1:07:38] there's a crop God come to harvest you
[1:07:41] know he said oh yeah I think it's James
[1:07:45] says and he waits for the precious
[1:07:47] fruits
[1:07:55] you say oh brother I'm almost done with
[1:07:57] this section of it because I want you to
[1:08:00] understand that God has something
[1:08:02] working something you ought to be
[1:08:04] feeling strange something strange is
[1:08:07] happening you gotta feel it it's in the
[1:08:10] air it's in the air something is
[1:08:13] happening and I'm so glad I can feel it
[1:08:16] hallelujah and I am able to work with it
[1:08:20] right now you said what do you mean
[1:08:22] listen though those those are a school
[1:08:25] of prophets knew Elijah was going up but
[1:08:28] instead of joining with Elijah they
[1:08:30] stayed in their school only Liza was
[1:08:34] going up I would have joined up with
[1:08:35] Nyjah so I can go up with him hallelujah
[1:08:40] this bride know it's about time to go up
[1:08:43] everybody around the message even knows
[1:08:46] that this is a time to go up but nobody
[1:08:49] wanna join up with Elijah Elijah says
[1:08:53] Lord give me the power when you God I
[1:08:57] want it what else I want a double
[1:09:01] portion of it is that right and he said
[1:09:04] listen if you see me go up you'll get it
[1:09:08] and he saw allowed to go up come on
[1:09:12] somebody why the very mantle of Elijah
[1:09:15] that's what brother man said at the
[1:09:16] first time when he wanted he didn't have
[1:09:18] the he didn't see it
[1:09:20] hallelujah but he'll I sure had to grow
[1:09:23] up and then when he grew up the same
[1:09:26] Colton city larger fit Elijah
[1:09:30] hallelujah that's what the mess is been
[1:09:32] doing he's been causing up to go up is
[1:09:36] that right Paul said grow up into Christ
[1:09:39] now the very role of Elijah the maturity
[1:09:43] of Elijah it's not fitting Elijah he's
[1:09:50] no longer boy he's a man that's what
[1:09:53] Paul said when I was a child I spoke
[1:09:56] like a child but when I became a man I
[1:09:59] put away childish things that's what's
[1:10:02] wrong with the people in the message
[1:10:03] they still children but we ought to grow
[1:10:06] up
[1:10:09] hallelujah there's a power waiting on us
[1:10:12] a power of authority waiting
[1:10:16] he got time to fuss he got time to
[1:10:21] quarrel hallelujah

[1:10:26] people to understand when Matthew 25 was
[1:10:30] made manifest it came in our day there
