on high the most high god no one else can be compared to him amen [Music] so good to see each and every one who was able to come to church this sunday morning amen there is no better place to be on a sunday morning david said i was happy when they said let us go to the house of the lord because he knew that's where he was going to meet his maker he knew that's what he was going to get that his heart's desired uh welcome each and everyone in this place see our brother is it your first time here you're welcome amen sister gladys made it this morning whilst we're standing let us open our bibles to the uh book of psalms chapter 42. psalms psalms 42 verse 1 when you thirst for god approach the real god did you appreciate because anything that you shall do any anything that you put first that's your god some people worship their wives some people worship their husbands some worship their money yes they are trying to quench that thirst for god that they have is he saying but when you have that thirst for god you're supposed to approach god for him to quench that thirst because he is more than willing to fill your heart more than you are willing for him to come so we see each and every human god put a thirst for a desire for a god that's why we have more than 200 religions in the world because that instinct that god placed in a in a human basket they know they are supposed to be worshiping something but satan knows that and then he comes into pervert that's why some people they worship the sun some worship the moon some worship a piece of wood that's carved as an idol yes come why because they have that instinct within them you see the prophet of god said you see it's something natural prophet did you this was natural to thirst for god that was off the journey it is a natural thing secret truth naturally it's just something that you should do god has just made you up like that and it's no superhuman is it a superhuman it's actually a common thing for your human being it is not special for anyone so people do not understand what they're supposed to quench their tests for legends and they try to find the next alternative that's there for them to quench their thirst brother talks a story about his father he says my father was a drunk and he says it is because he had that thirst for god but he did not know that he was thirsting for god all along the next best thing that was there for him was to was to grab that alcohol and be a drunk oh and he did not know that he was trying to quench the thirst for god and it might be a different thing for each and every one of us the devil always have alternatives right in front of you but you gotta get that realization that it is god that i need in my life although i need that car but it is god that i have to put first one although i'm craving for relationships in my life it is god that i have to put first and the prophet of god says when you see what your desires are then by that you can tell what kind of thing that's in you you can tell what's creating this desire there's a certain thing that you thirst for yeah amen in matthew matthew 6 chapter matthew chapter 6 verse 20 says but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven when neither moth nor rust dot corrupt and where thieves do not break through nor steal and verse 21 says for where your treasure is there will your heart be also so whatever you value it shows what's inside of you whatever you put first if you value the things of heaven and you value the things of god every decision you make will be influenced by god whatever you do you will consider god first and sound says consider the lord in all your ways and he will guide thy path but if you value the things of this world the things of this earth your desires and your priorities they're always to fulfill your kind of flesh desires because it is showing that you are trying to fulfill the last of your flesh the last of your eyes first john 2 15 reads love not the world neither the things that are in the world if any man love the world the love of the father is not in him first john 2 15. love not the world neither the things that are in the world on the mount says if any men love the world the love of the father is not in him for all that's in the world the lust of the flesh and the last of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the father but it is of the world and we know that satan is the god of this eden of this world so if you are trying to fulfill the lust of your flesh and the lust of your eyes and the pride of life [Music] that is not of the father but of the world it is so easy to tell what's controlling you just look at what you are craving for and what your spirit your soul is craving for regard not your body that's that's that's how satan is going to attempt he's just going to come and tempt that body but when you are saved satan has no reach to your soul and that's an indicator and if you are craving the things of the world in your soul then you have to see god real quick because god is not there and you need him amen so you can tell what's controlling you but why but by what your desires are i love you will always quench the test of what you need by seeing hearing or talking things that satisfies those desires amen like we just said if your desires are worldly things that's what's controlling you and if you're constantly desiring to read and listen and meditate to god's word and you are supposed to quench the thirst with the thing with the thing that only quenches that thirst when you are hungry you don't go to drink water when you when you want to eat when you have to eat food because that's what your body needs water will not do you any good actually your stomach will start hurting because you're trying to punch thirst for water with the wrong thing amen so we have to make sure that in our control tower we have god in there we have to make sure that we have the holy ghost in our soul when you have the holy ghost you cannot go smoking observation um for me you cannot go do things of the world we you want to satisfy the last of your eyes then you know that there is something wrong that's in your soul is the wrong person in the control tower the prophet of god says there's a control tower of the soul and one for the body and each tower is a warning for the needs of the others each one calls to the need for what the caller is calling for appel and it sends out a wave of warning you see that see the flesh always wants to fulfill the desires of the body and the spirit is also desiring to fulfill the the thirst of the soul elizabeth but we should let the soul take control of each and every part of our body amen you know paul says in romans um in romans 4 22. he says whenever i want to do good you see the five senses in our body that we have that's the contact point with this world of contact and that's not saved so satan is going to try and come to that and tempt you through that hello and he tries to give you an alternative to quench you the thirst of your body if i see this you see yourself your sense of hearing you you're tempted to go listen to worldly music memory conscience imagination reason and affection satan will try and put crazy imaginations in your head make you remember the things you're not supposed to remember and you have affection for the wrong things because he's trying to control you from the soul but if you get god in the control tower you will know that god is always there to help you when the devil comes he will be there to save you just right in time amen and we are not forced but it's a willful subjection to the holy ghost in our soul um come and have full control of us david never forced them to go fight and take water but he was just sitting there and he says i so long and i desire the waters of bethlehem then they took it up to themselves and they say the king's desire is our command [Music] so that they could go and fulfill the king's desires whatever the bible tells us to do we translation it says i find therefore this law when i'm willing to do right that there is wrong that lies near me whenever you decide to fulfill the king's desires so that you go and do what the devil's alternative is fair alternative if you ever notice food smells so good when you are fasting um because papayas will smell really good come on and it's so hard for you to resist that temptation providing an alternative for you the time you decide to fulfill the will that he has in our lives that's what we need to quench the thirst that god put in us you know the will of god the prophet god says the first thing is find out whether is the will of god or not and then if you want to know where there's the will of god look into the bible there is a thing that sets you straight yeah it's the word of god and then if you see it in the word of god for you to do then you do it allah and you have to go and verify first if that's god will put the thirst in you and you go and open up your bible if you see what you're being inspired to do is written in the bible it doesn't matter what things i have to face the shows okay amen it doesn't matter what satan whispers into your ear and whatever alternatives he gives you he's just trying to block the blessings from you then the next day you find out no doubt the devil will make that day twice as bad it is as it was the day before dude i've experienced it many times after you leave sunday morning service you are feeling so victorious oh you come out of the wednesday evening service you're feeling so victorious but then the devil is waiting for you right at the door exterior that monday morning he's going to try and give you a real beating is to demonstrate because he's trying to block your blessings but you're not supposed to stop at anything you keep on going when you come in here sick and you pray and you feel healed when you go out the devil is going to try and make you feel more sick but because it's in the word of god he said you shall be healed so that's the will of god you keep on going do you have any heart's desire it doesn't matter how much the devil tries to to discourage you and say no it was just it was just an emotion just keep on holding on to it because the devil was trying to block your blessings so just keep on fighting on continue it's satan who's just trying to suppress the thirst of god with something else that's why we're supposed to be sensitive to god always sensitive because he places the thirst for what we need at the right time when we need that thing just like your body is going to need food when you need food it's not going to need water when you need food god is more superior to the system that's in your body superior to the system he knows what you need and when you need it so if you are just sensitive to god he will inspire you of what you need sometimes you adjust that then you have this burden on your heart to pray for someone the fourth lives of it you go right ahead and do it that and you are there the right person who is supposed to intercede for them if you're only sensitive enough to know that this is god's will for me i'm supposed to help my brother my sister amen when you are sick there is a thirst for healing and there is already the healing that's provided to quench that thirst when your body is afflicted you need a miracle you are thirsting for a miracle you are thirsting for a paradox so before you ask you already provided the thing that you want to receive so when you kneel down and you pray be sensitive to god he will drop in your mind what you need to be praying for what you are needing at that point in time the other time we were saying when you pray you receive not because you pray i miss you because you are not sensitive to god he is telling you to do something else but he's telling you to pray for something else but you are praying for something else to to satisfy your body last no if the amount of paradox in our lives he prefers on paradoxical if we approach him with the right mental attitude lord i need your help he's more than willing to quench your thirst before god created that thirst for water he already made the water before you created your heart's desires before you desired them before you needed healing before you were sick he provided the healing two thousand years ago before you were in despair he provided the comfort of two thousand years ago i want all you just have to do is to be willing to let him quench that thirst before you sinned before you were even born to commit the sin that you were that you committed you already provided forgiveness for you when he was hanging on the cross and he said it is finished he was projecting his forgiveness and his grace to you so you know he already gave the provision before you have the desire or the need of it before he created adam and eve and before humanity even ever fell yeah god created the very thing you need to quench that thirst that's how god is mindful of us he always creates a provision before the need he knew you were going to be in despair that's why he provided what you need he provides he already has the solution before the problem is is approaching do you have a teacher he is more than willing to come to your health if you just stand in that place and you say lord i need you amen in the scripture that we were reading you know david was a woodsman when he said as the deer panted for water if you listen to this to the sermon thirst was just not talking about thirsting for water just to drink with david but you know in the wild when a deer is out there sorry if it happens to get hurt away from them and if it doesn't get any help it will bleed to death but there is an instinct of thirst that god plays in this deer may i understand that soft plastic that the moment it get it gets hurt the moment it starts bleeding it has to run to find water it has to run to go and find a stream of water the moment it gets to that stream and drinks water the water is going to cool down its body that water is going to stop the bleeding and then that d is going to leave he said but if that d doesn't find this stream of water to die so that's what david was talking about he says that's why he said as the deer painted for the water longer if you look in verse 3 he says my tears have been my meat day and night continually say to me where is thy god what is he talking about he's talking about when he is in trouble his deliverance comes from whenever he is hurt whenever he is torn apart he has to find that river that river of water to that deer that river becomes a river of life place for the water as the deer painted for the water so long do i long for you he's saying whenever i'm torn apart by the enemy jesus christ because it is that waters of life that he gives to you they will save you they will heal you they will deliver you you will deliver before the enemy destroys you let us stand upon our feet amen [Music] amen whenever you fall down you rise up and keep on walking because that's where the river of life is there for you that's where salvation is there for you amen so you do not stop you can play as the deer panther for the water amen the bible says it just meant falls seven times but they do not remain down there they gotta stand up you want solve amen we fall down seven times you get up eight times whenever you get wounded in the battle don't stay in that one place you will bleed [Music] [Music] he makes you unfaithful to god and do start doing things you're not supposed to do that [Music] amen the devil is fighting you he can use hatred against you and your brother hatred against you and your sister until you cannot even say you cannot even shake their hands you end up having grudges with people [Music] [Music] satan has probably been attacking you in all different ways don't stop right there and feel defeated get your brother sister run to the water run to that fountain of life god is willing to stop that bleeding you shall not die he will save you because he died for you amen let us sing as the deer amen [Music] oh [Music] for the water [Applause] [Music] after you [Music] to [Music] does my spirit [Music] the [Music] you are [Music] you're my friend you're my friend and you are my brother even though you are you are the king lord i want you i want you more than [Music] the other so much [Music] my spirit [Music] [Music] [Music] my brother even [Music] [Music] more than see you are my friend and you are my brother oh lord you're my friend oh [Music] he's willing to come and live within your soul amen [Music] oh [Music] lord i want you [Music] only you is [Music] yes [Applause] [Music] lord more [Music] oh [Music] [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] is [Music] brother sister you run to the water [Music] you shall not die he will save you he is that fountain of life that can save you when satan comes after you do not stop where you are keep on running until you find that waterproof that we construct healing in the water for you salvation in the water for you yes deliverance in the water for you yes you can save your [Music] if you can just yield and say pray and pray to god and say lord help me out [Music] knowing that he already made a provision for what you are longing for healing before he was sick just be ready to respond to that terrorist gods [Music] i need grace to reach that river of [Music] [Music] is [Music] that we have to find the river of life you are there [Music] he has been hurting us [Music] [Music] this morning grant the provision for that thirst holy ghost with that kid he told us in your word you're more than willing to give us the holy ghost more than we wanted that we need let us give the lord a clap offering amen let us thank the lord for what he has done let us keep on thanking him for what he will do of my strength and my shield [Music] glory [Music] words [Music] oh yes [Music] for you [Music] me [Music] let us just um [Music] oh lord say you alone it's you alone [Music] does my spirit [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] my
