[28:14] aim and praise God hallelujah thank you
[28:20] Lord amen let's just start with a verse
[28:30] 1 and seeing the multitudes he went up
[28:33] into the mountain he was set any and he
[28:36] was set with his disciples on where they
[28:38] came unto him and he opened his mouth
[28:40] and taught them saying blessed are the
[28:42] poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom
[28:44] of heaven
[28:45] blessed are they that mourn for they
[28:47] shall be comforted blessed are the meek
[28:49] for they shall inherit the earth
[28:52] blessed are they the hunger and thirst
[28:54] after righteousness for they shall be
[28:56] filled
[28:57] blessed are the merciful for they shall
[29:00] obtain mercy blessed are the pure in
[29:03] heart for they shall see God blessed are
[29:07] the peacemakers for they shall be called
[29:09] the children of God blessed are they
[29:11] which are persecuted for righteousness
[29:13] sake for theirs is the kingdom of heaven
[29:15] blessed are ye when men shall revile you
[29:19] and persecute you and shall say all
[29:20] manner of evil against you falsely for
[29:22] my sake rejoice exceeding glad for great
[29:27] is your reward in heaven for so
[29:29] persecuted they the prophets which were
[29:31] before you even let's just ask Lord's
[29:35] blessings from the reading of the word
[29:36] heavenly father we just come before you
[29:38] this morning Lord we can sit through a
[29:40] church service father feel a little bit
[29:42] better Lord and go back to the same life
[29:45] we had before church Lord I know none of
[29:47] us here want that Lord we don't want to
[29:49] just be a hacker's just a little bit and
[29:51] just to get by another week Lord we want
[29:54] your thoughts we want your ways which
[29:57] are higher than our thoughts and our
[29:58] ways Lord Lord lift us up Lord if we're
[30:01] not standing Lord lift us up and let us
[30:03] stand father Lord quicken your word to
[30:07] us Lord I can't convince anybody of
[30:09] anything father but your Holy Spirit
[30:12] we have conference at the confidence in
[30:13] this morning Lord would you just be with
[30:15] us father would you bless His Word
[30:17] father and use use these poor lips
[30:20] father to give your people Lord what
[30:24] they need father that's what I'm here
[30:26] this morning father I pray you bless the
[30:28] here and the receiver father made no
[30:30] thought take preeminence over the Word
[30:32] of God if there's an evil spirits in
[30:34] here trying to stop the service we
[30:36] rebuke you Satan you take your hands off
[30:37] of God's property in the name of the
[30:40] Lord Jesus Christ when you submit you
[30:42] from this building and from the mind of
[30:44] each heart here tonight this morning
[30:47] Lord we just thank you Father now in the
[30:49] name of Lord Jesus Christ for your glory
[30:52] we ask you and we pray for also for
[30:55] brother Brooks father over at the other
[30:56] church father bless him load this
[30:58] morning Lord I pray father that you the
[31:00] noisome father to meet the needs for
[31:01] their in Jesus Christ's name Amen amen
[31:05] you may be seated
[31:07] amen praise God I just hope this that
[31:11] this is uh that we can get to see y'all
[31:14] more often because I I just hate coming
[31:17] into to not know you I would I would
[31:20] rather not just get up behind the pulpit
[31:22] and and not know you I want to get to
[31:24] know you and you know this I say a sign
[31:28] of a Good Shepherd is the one that
[31:30] smells like the Sheep amen and and if
[31:33] I'm a standing Shepherd for a little bit
[31:35] and I never get to smell like sheep
[31:37] that's not a very good Shepherd either
[31:38] so I just want to to be a servant and be
[31:41] among you and to get to know you and
[31:44] fellowship with you as your my brothers
[31:46] and sisters and I love you this seems
[31:49] like an odd text for a topic on prayer
[31:55] and bless and promises but you notice
[32:00] how these all these things the poor and
[32:03] spirit those that mourn are the meek
[32:06] those who hunger and thirst after
[32:08] righteousness the merciful the pure in
[32:12] heart the peacemakers those that are
[32:15] persecuted for righteousness sake it
[32:17] these are attributes of the Holy Spirit
[32:20] is the attributes of a son or daughter
[32:22] of God and with that God in a
[32:25] like jesus said to the disciples that
[32:28] you'll be hated that because we it's
[32:31] because they hated him and he hid the
[32:34] profits so these are signs of the heart
[32:40] of God like it says over in him let's
[32:43] turn over to Isaiah 61 one of my
[32:47] favorite scriptures and you could tell
[32:54] it was it was paramount for Jesus
[32:58] because it was his first text that we
[33:02] see in Scripture when Luke chapter 4
[33:07] we're 61 in verse 1 if you had ever say
[33:11] a man any man the Spirit of the Lord is
[33:17] upon me because the Lord hath anointed
[33:20] me to preach good tidings unto the meek
[33:22] he has sent me to bind up the
[33:24] brokenhearted to proclaim Liberty to the
[33:26] captives and the opening of the prison
[33:28] to them that are bound to proclaim the
[33:32] acceptable year of the Lord and the day
[33:34] of the vengeance of our God what is what
[33:37] is he saying here I would like to to
[33:42] offer to you if you can just in your
[33:44] imagination think of a document for each
[33:49] one of us this morning if we could fill
[33:51] in the blanks and we had to write our
[33:54] name and we had to write what is
[33:57] anointing us as a manifesto for our life
[34:00] is that we could say the spirit of and
[34:04] there would be a blank there is upon me
[34:07] and has anointed to me to blank and as
[34:11] and to and on and on and on and on is
[34:14] that there's it that we are each here on
[34:18] this earth I remember just sitting as a
[34:19] 13 year old young man it just waiting
[34:22] for my mom at the gas station he's in
[34:24] the car and I just heard a voice say
[34:25] just in my a my head say what are you
[34:29] doing here and it was you know how
[34:34] thoughts come and go but this thought it
[34:35] was different it was this question what
[34:37] am I doing here
[34:38] I said what am I doing here I said well
[34:42] the only thing I know I can be doing
[34:44] here is to to to get to heaven and to
[34:49] love Jesus and to spread the the joy of
[34:51] of what Jesus has done for me to others
[34:54] and then I hear that question what are
[34:59] you doing about it
[35:00] and it was just oh Lord that's it saints
[35:03] of God that's why we come to church
[35:04] every day or every Sunday every
[35:07] Wednesday what we come to prayer meeting
[35:09] is because we're asking ourselves the
[35:12] question what am I doing here and what
[35:15] am i doing about it because we can just
[35:18] come to church and we can hear wonderful
[35:20] doctrine and we can hear wonderful
[35:22] revelation but just like scripture says
[35:25] that in first Corinthians tanana that we
[35:27] could have all all these gifts and
[35:29] revelations and everything that but have
[35:31] not love or nothing and love isn't a
[35:33] state of being it's a state of doing
[35:36] it's not a state of a perfection of
[35:40] completion of of now we now we
[35:43] understand no now we now we are doing
[35:45] now we're we're giving out were freely
[35:47] freely giving I was sitting on a roof
[35:52] nailing gutters to the hanging gutters
[35:55] to the roof and I'd mentioned this just
[35:58] a second ago but I just it was just like
[36:00] Lourdes in me is reaction to God calling
[36:05] us is Who am I
[36:07] and then then could you get to that
[36:11] place where we can say here am I
[36:13] because my pastor told me there's a gift
[36:16] in you to preach this is about 10 years
[36:18] ago I think it was going to be eight
[36:20] years ago and and I said Who am I Who am
[36:24] I
[36:24] and I just I feel like I'm going off
[36:29] topic but I just feel like the people
[36:30] the Lord is pulling through you so I
[36:32] just I just just phone leading of the
[36:34] Lord is that is that for two years I
[36:38] said Who am I and the Lord finally said
[36:41] Stephen freely received freely give each
[36:46] one of you this morning you've really
[36:48] received amen now to be able to freely
[36:51] give
[36:52] I remember I had a dream when I was
[36:54] young being a missionary and just just
[36:59] tell you a little bit about myself I was
[37:01] about maybe 12 or 13 years old and in
[37:03] the dream I had a I was in a like hotel
[37:10] or an apartment building and I knew I
[37:12] was going on a missions trip and I was I
[37:14] was shredded I didn't have a suitcase so
[37:16] I was gathering all my worldly
[37:18] possessions and my favourite Nike shoes
[37:20] and my my favorite shirts and everything
[37:22] at that and I was just trying to grab it
[37:24] too and try to hold on to all this stuff
[37:27] and some brothers came in said Stephen
[37:29] what are you doing we need to go we're
[37:30] gonna need to be late for our trip and I
[37:33] looked at that and I was in that moment
[37:34] of the world or God's calling and I just
[37:39] dropped everything and just took
[37:41] whatever I just needed to get by and
[37:43] went and you can see the the symbology
[37:47] there and then the next scene we got out
[37:49] on a plane and we're in the middle of
[37:50] this this is clearing in a rainforest
[37:53] and there was these natives coming out
[37:56] of rainforest and and I were each given
[37:59] a sword and I and the sword I had I
[38:03] could barely hold it in one hand and it
[38:05] was just this small handled sword and I
[38:07] said and the other brothers got a sword
[38:10] and they were using their swords and and
[38:11] I said Lord if I'm gonna fight for you I
[38:14] need to be able to hold this sword and I
[38:17] just was praying lord please give me a
[38:18] sword I can know I can grasp firmly and
[38:21] the sword grew out where I could hold it
[38:24] with both hands and it was just made
[38:26] right so I could really grip it and just
[38:30] to see how the Word of God is like that
[38:31] how that you know at first when we're
[38:33] young we're trying to grip the the Word
[38:35] of God and it's and yet we maybe don't
[38:37] even know how to fight with it you know
[38:39] but with the promises of God for that
[38:41] will defeat every one of our enemies
[38:43] each one of those things are the God
[38:45] that heel up the air by the ice your
[38:47] stripes I'm healed
[38:48] maybe we're just grasping it and where
[38:50] you just don't have a handle on it yet
[38:52] and what we could say just like the man
[38:53] said with the Sun that had the evil
[38:56] spirit that oh lord help my unbelief and
[38:59] then all of a sudden he could grasp at
[39:01] that firmer Amen that wonderful saints
[39:04] of God how that you know the
[39:06] it's the sort of spirit which is the
[39:07] word of God and now that we're learning
[39:09] to grasp that sword and it what how do
[39:11] we grasp it like brother BAM said it's
[39:13] faith that grips that word of God so
[39:17] that God creasing our faith it's that
[39:19] muscle gripping the Word of God to hold
[39:21] fast now they say you heard this the how
[39:24] that when you you grip a sword long
[39:27] enough in battle that even if you were
[39:30] to let go your hand would be God made
[39:32] your hand so that you could never let go
[39:34] that you after a battle is over a lot of
[39:36] times that they would have to pry their
[39:37] fingers with almost like a pliers type
[39:40] thing just to get their hands out of the
[39:42] sword because it would be there was so
[39:44] dead locked onto that sword because they
[39:47] had that death grip saying I'm I'm
[39:49] running for my life I'm standing firm on
[39:51] the Word of God and I'm holding on the
[39:53] sword with all my might and and of
[39:56] course being young in the faith and in
[39:58] this story on the next thing that
[40:00] happened in this dream I had as I was so
[40:03] excited for this the sword now I could
[40:05] grasp firmly I was just started waving
[40:07] it around and showing it off and and
[40:09] before you knew it I struck the tip on a
[40:12] rock and I broke the tip off and I even
[40:16] had anyone used it yet and I just oh I
[40:18] just dropped to my knees I said lord
[40:20] please forgive me you know cure the
[40:22] first thing I do is just abuse the sword
[40:24] you've given me by just being show a
[40:26] show off with it I said Lord would you
[40:28] please forgive me and about my head and
[40:30] opened my eyes and the tip had grown
[40:31] back on the sword and that how that we
[40:34] don't ever want to use this word of God
[40:35] for my ministry or or for you know God
[40:39] showed me this and I think you know wow
[40:41] what would a plagiarism thing to say oh
[40:44] you know well the using it for our own
[40:47] purpose and and to you know like the
[40:50] there was a I love photography how many
[40:54] love photography
[40:55] there was a man Ansel Adams he may
[40:58] remember how he used to take beautiful
[41:01] black-and-white photos back in the day
[41:04] when there was only black and white of
[41:05] just beautiful landscapes you know of
[41:08] just national parks and just oh he just
[41:11] captured everything and you know God had
[41:15] lit the sky he he done all the set
[41:18] design he
[41:20] they put the trees there the foilage the
[41:22] rocks the mountains the creatures
[41:24] everything he had put in the place
[41:26] everything and Ansel Adams would say he
[41:29] says I didn't do anything he says all I
[41:32] had all I did was just being the right
[41:35] place when God wanted someone to take a
[41:37] picture and that's us it's a god that's
[41:41] me and you is that we are in the we pray
[41:44] that the Lord will put us in that right
[41:45] place where when God wants to do
[41:48] something that we're right there to say
[41:51] yes
[41:51] amen how many wants to say yes this
[41:53] morning amen because it's this it's this
[41:56] time that we have even me here this
[41:59] morning there's a reason for it and I
[42:01] know it's not me but it's just that Lord
[42:03] is here this morning for each one of us
[42:05] that he can do something and it's just
[42:08] like we we know brother Branham I know
[42:11] the pillar of fire appeared over his
[42:13] head and what'd he say he says I'm
[42:15] nothing I just happened to be standing
[42:16] there when the pillar fire wanted to
[42:18] take its picture amen
[42:19] so again you he wasn't saying no look at
[42:22] me look at what God did for me no it was
[42:25] I just happened to be standing there
[42:27] when God wanted his picture taken and so
[42:30] that it's it's about him being lifted up
[42:32] like Jesus said I am meek and lowly and
[42:36] how brother branham always talked about
[42:38] God's and simplicity all that God uses
[42:41] simplicity and faith and it was it I'm
[42:46] sorry
[42:47] simplicity faith and humility I believe
[42:50] you said to work as works and that it's
[42:53] not something this big organization in
[42:55] this big pomp that we know that God is
[42:58] working and that the promises that he
[43:00] has in his word coming in effect in our
[43:03] lives that it's just you can only come
[43:08] down like the sermon the lamb and the
[43:09] dove we're we're we're than that place
[43:12] to have a nature to let just like the
[43:15] Lamb of God in the Jordan River when
[43:18] John was baptizing him how he was that
[43:20] lamb and that dove could have send upon
[43:21] him and he wasn't this wolfish nature
[43:24] that was snarling and biting it was this
[43:27] Lamb of God and that the the the nature
[43:30] of the Holy Spirit from the father could
[43:32] come down
[43:33] send upon him amen amen how many wants
[43:36] all the promises of God have you ever
[43:39] stopped to think you know at the end of
[43:40] our life when we get on the other side
[43:41] since of God you know there's so many
[43:43] promises in this Bible how many will we
[43:46] use on this earth how many how many
[43:49] scriptures will we know by heart because
[43:52] they're just so sweet sweeter than honey
[43:54] how much will we capitalize on this how
[43:58] much opportunity will we actually take
[44:01] it's there how much will we take amen
[44:04] this someone had said that there's over
[44:07] I think was over five five thousand four
[44:10] hundred sixty-seven promises in God's
[44:11] Word five thousand four hundred and
[44:14] sixty-seven promises in God's Word how
[44:17] many will we cash in on maybe 300 400
[44:22] who would want to cash in maybe just on
[44:25] a thousand Wow thousand promises in
[44:28] God's Word what about maybe 2,000 maybe
[44:32] that we just enough to get us through
[44:33] life how about all of them amen
[44:36] and you know how they even you think
[44:38] about that and you think about how that
[44:39] even through through through different
[44:43] through different men through the ages
[44:46] that God used to promise to point to
[44:49] those promises and even to think about
[44:51] how when the Lord gave brother Branham
[44:53] his commission when he had he'd he'd
[44:56] just had to get a whole loan with the
[44:58] Lord and the Lord met him and he said if
[45:01] you can be sincere and get the people to
[45:04] believe nothing will stand and you're in
[45:06] the way of your prayer not even cancer
[45:08] and they just it just struck me Saints
[45:10] one time I listened to a sermon and I
[45:12] was thinking about my healing and I was
[45:14] thinking about this Lord remind me
[45:15] Steven that's a promise today that when
[45:20] you listen to a tape and you hear
[45:21] brother Brandon praying and it's not
[45:23] brother branham but it's it says nothing
[45:25] can stand in the way of your prayer so
[45:28] when we're sincere I believe this all my
[45:30] heart since God went on sincere when
[45:32] you're sincere and you're listening
[45:33] those tapes and he said brother Branham
[45:35] is praying for you and that prayer or
[45:38] praying for praying nothing can stand in
[45:40] the way of that prayer not even cancer
[45:42] because and it's not the sovereignty of
[45:44] brother Branham or the power of brother
[45:46] Branham or anything
[45:47] No it's the Lord giving brother branham
[45:49] a promise and just like look at look at
[45:52] Elijah when he was even buried when he
[45:54] was everybody was in in the ground not
[45:58] even buried he was just in the pits and
[45:59] they threw a dead body in there how that
[46:02] even that dead body came back to life
[46:04] because that there was something and
[46:05] that wasn't Elijah
[46:07] it was the anointing that God had given
[46:09] Eliezer Elijah because God does nothing
[46:11] left that seals up through his servants
[46:13] the prophets so it's not lifting up any
[46:15] man but it's lifting up Christ that that
[46:18] same spirit that raised Christ from the
[46:21] dead dwells in you there's a promise
[46:23] it'll do what they look quicken our
[46:25] mortal bodies amen do that spirit
[46:28] dwelling in you you know in this there's
[46:31] things that each one of us how many of
[46:33] us a burden on their heart just things
[46:34] that you've been praying about for years
[46:36] or maybe you don't understand something
[46:38] maybe there's something in the surface
[46:39] you don't understand yet and you've
[46:41] heard it preached over and over and over
[46:42] again those things that you're like it's
[46:45] for me I know it's for me and sometimes
[46:48] it's a season brother Joey right you
[46:50] know that God's just wanting us to
[46:51] persevere you know the trial of our face
[46:53] is more precious than gold right and yet
[46:55] sometimes there's there's ways we can go
[46:59] after something and get it sooner I
[47:01] believe and sometimes that I think I'm
[47:05] just gonna be a vulnerable here this
[47:07] morning and say that sometimes I'm
[47:08] tempted to rather than going in before
[47:11] his presence and staying in his presence
[47:13] I kind of just go out in the waiting
[47:14] room and I kind of just sit back and and
[47:16] just kind of just well I'm gonna swing
[47:20] on you Lord I'm just gonna sit back and
[47:21] maybe maybe I'll just kind of get on my
[47:25] phone a little bit and kind of just
[47:26] we're just all this wait until you have
[47:28] an answer for me oh wow that's neat ooh
[47:30] oh that's pretty neat oh that's a good
[47:32] information and now pretty soon I'm just
[47:34] addicted to information and pretty soon
[47:37] I'm now I'm looking up you know what
[47:38] does Google say about it oh you know
[47:40] what does this say about it and there's
[47:42] nothing wrong with with those things as
[47:44] if it's not an absolute but yet we're
[47:47] here to inquire the Lord not inquire of
[47:50] our iPhone or our Samsung or whatever
[47:53] amen is that that it's that's not the
[47:56] absolute as I'm sure brother Brooks has
[47:57] preached that we that so many times it's
[48:00] the
[48:00] counsel of the ungodly saints of God
[48:02] amen that's it's so many times this is
[48:05] just all that internet is just the
[48:07] counsel of the ungodly so many times and
[48:09] we end for us student to not just be in
[48:11] the waiting room with the world waiting
[48:13] to hear from God and to get complacent
[48:16] and just oh why wouldn't he do something
[48:18] but just to to to push forward when we
[48:21] don't know what to do to see that God
[48:23] has for us
[48:24] I love brother Branham preaches in 1953
[48:28] seeking after Jesus he says now let
[48:31] every one of you your homes be a prayer
[48:33] room just start praying everywhere and
[48:35] how prayer is so important and to make
[48:38] our prayers known to God we must be
[48:42] confident for his promises to be for us
[48:45] that to expect that his promise is there
[48:48] for us that when a man that brother
[48:54] Brown preaches also in the Jehovah Jireh
[48:56] 457 he says when a man is born again of
[49:01] the Spirit of God every divine blessing
[49:03] in this Bible belongs to you I'm gonna
[49:07] read that again when a man is born of
[49:08] born again of the Spirit of God every
[49:11] divine blessing in this Bible belongs to
[49:13] you amen
[49:14] is that for you are you that man are you
[49:16] that woman amen it belongs to you amen
[49:19] let him know that Amen that you're
[49:22] looking for that you're when you raise
[49:23] your hand in faith he's saying oh they
[49:26] believe it
[49:27] I'm rose listening to I just been been
[49:30] witnessing to my my my wife's cousins
[49:33] we'd gone down to a little town in
[49:35] Minnesota Lanesboro and we'd gone biking
[49:38] together and and we're sitting around
[49:39] the campfire cuz they're they're really
[49:41] Unitarianism a lot of that and Lutheran
[49:43] background where they just read prayers
[49:45] out of a book and they just pretty of
[49:48] just can sermons and and everything or
[49:50] just they just believe they believe
[49:51] nothing pretty much for me even going to
[49:54] their church is that just very just not
[49:57] no strong beliefs and we were just
[49:59] sitting around the fire and I was just
[50:00] pouring out to them you know and they
[50:02] said you know I believe I could do good
[50:03] things you know I mean you know we have
[50:05] our faith and you have your faith and I
[50:07] just do get things I'll just I know God
[50:09] God will look at that and say it's okay
[50:12] you know you could just see and so I was
[50:14] just pouring
[50:15] into them just you know the way of the
[50:16] Lord and God's provided way and just
[50:19] pouring out and how many times you got a
[50:20] chance to do be a witness and the first
[50:22] thing after that you just get hungry for
[50:24] more and you just want to feel yourself
[50:26] back up and that's I'd be careful
[50:28] I'm grabbing trailing off a little bit
[50:30] here but be careful because right when
[50:32] you pour out and that freely give now
[50:34] that's when Satan can come and say
[50:35] you're thirsty I'm gonna get in and then
[50:37] the end oh wow
[50:39] brother rich you've done such a good job
[50:42] you know to be a witness you know you
[50:44] can just sit back a while on the set
[50:45] that just just take take your leisure
[50:48] and you know why don't you just just
[50:50] read just read a fiction a fictional
[50:53] book and why don't you just when all of
[50:55] a sudden you're you're needing that
[50:56] verse you again you're needing that life
[50:58] from the throne of God and so many times
[51:01] that that that seniors try to come in
[51:04] for me and when I've just poured myself
[51:06] out and spend that Oh take your rest you
[51:08] know Steven yo you know look at how
[51:10] spiritual you are and you just pour
[51:14] yourself out to others you know just
[51:15] just pat pat Steven on the back and just
[51:18] just just take care of him for for a
[51:20] while but it's taking air of the flesh
[51:22] and not the spirit taking care of the
[51:23] fleshly man of the world and how that we
[51:26] by God's grace can do I've read back
[51:29] into that word and I was on the way home
[51:31] from Lanesboro and everybody was
[51:34] sleeping in the car now I turn on if
[51:36] that sermon on power of decision
[51:39] preached in 1955 there's that as a good
[51:43] series
[51:44] if you ever haven't listened to it
[51:46] brother Brett preached in 1955 I think I
[51:48] think it was 12 times in Chicago because
[51:52] when you when you listen to near the end
[51:54] of those those series you say wow people
[51:59] are just charged up they're just they're
[52:01] just on fire and and yet when it's
[52:04] because he'd already been there seven
[52:05] eight nine times and he pushes on the
[52:08] power of Satan the power of God and the
[52:11] power of decision and you know just
[52:14] talking about how that we know when we
[52:15] when we respond to the Lord and faith
[52:17] how that God sees that I was it was the
[52:20] end the service and the Lord was using
[52:22] brother Branham said there was healings
[52:24] in the service
[52:27] and people were getting healed left and
[52:29] right and and he says oh you know sister
[52:32] your he loved diabetes and the name of
[52:33] Lord Jesus Christ and he says oh isn't
[52:36] that wonderful let's say praise the Lord
[52:38] Nicolle congregation says praise Lord
[52:40] I'm and I'm in the car I'm saying praise
[52:41] the Lord I'm filling back up and he says
[52:44] you know the angel Lord standing right

[52:48] over my body and I just see oh praise
[52:51] God he says you there up in the balcony
[52:53] what do you think of all this and I said
[52:54] I believe it with all my heart and he
[52:57] says you believe it with all of your
[52:59] heart and I just about had I had a had a
[53:01] conniption I said Oh glory to god this
[53:03] is so good is that there's for each one
[53:07] of us even for you young people you may
[53:09] say oh you know that's for brother
[53:10] Steven or that's for adults or is that
[53:12] there's so much that it's just happy and
[53:15] delightful in the Lord Amen don't you
[53:17] believe it Saints I mean you've seen it
[53:19] in your life and that choosing life
[53:21] choosing the Lord if there's something
[53:24] that happens it's so wonderful but it
[53:27] takes our expectations and that takes us
[53:30] running to the throne amen amen but
[53:33] reaching out for the things of God how
[53:35] do we reach out for more of his promises
[53:38] did you know that that brother Bram said
[53:41] prayer is the stepladder to reach the
[53:45] unreachable
[53:46] he says when well when I buy a house why
[53:52] it's just like if this place belonged to
[53:54] me and it was a big arcade and I come in
[53:56] here and I want to find out what I got I
[53:58] go around pull out this drawer and look
[54:02] in it and see what I got here go over
[54:04] here and see what I got in here if
[54:06] anything seems a little bit too high I
[54:08] get me a stepladder I go up to it find
[54:11] out what it's all about
[54:12] amen and when I get God say brother I
[54:15] took this old treasure book of God and
[54:17] looked through it and see what I
[54:19] possessed amen took out this treasure
[54:22] book I find out that every blessing
[54:24] that's in it belongs to me and it
[54:26] belongs to every believer si yes sir
[54:29] if some and they'll listen to this if
[54:32] some of them seems to be a little out of
[54:34] my reach I'll pray till I get to it if
[54:39] something seems to be a little about all
[54:41] my reach I'll pray till I get to it
[54:44] amen every promise in the book is yours
[54:47] he-man Saints this crew this great
[54:51] arcade of gods a commonly belongs to
[54:53] every believer and by one spirit were
[54:55] all baptized in this big arcade and
[54:57] everything in there belongs to us and
[55:00] we're heir of all things and every
[55:02] promise of God amen
[55:04] and then add adoption he lights to it
[55:07] again he says oh but it's so good to
[55:11] look at yes but just like brother
[55:13] Neville said about the arcade yesterday
[55:15] get you a step letter and go around and
[55:18] see what you got
[55:19] yes sir that's what this is like God's
[55:23] Holy Spirit is our stepladder to tell us
[55:27] what we got God's Holy Spirit as our
[55:30] stepladder to tell us what we got see so
[55:34] we have the Holy Spirit and we have
[55:36] prayer because we know how many a parade
[55:38] and just felt like there's nothing just
[55:40] you just praying and just and it's just
[55:42] your praying and like brother Billy you
[55:44] know Billy Graham says you pray till you
[55:46] feel like bring it and that did you know
[55:50] saints of God that you know the
[55:53] scripture says I believe it's in its in
[55:55] Colossians chapter 2 it says you know
[55:57] God has given us the power to will and
[56:01] to do of his good pleasure it's not our
[56:03] power it's not our will that's died will
[56:06] be done so it has to be his will coming
[56:09] in through us so if you're if you're
[56:10] challenged by this and say I want that I
[56:12] want to reach and take God's stepladder
[56:15] of the Holy Spirit but I have the Holy
[56:17] Spirit God can give that to you because
[56:20] remember it's when you when you make a
[56:22] decision for Christ to ask him in your
[56:24] heart that his Holy Spirit hasn't come
[56:27] in yet and how that you have your own
[56:29] renewed will but you don't have God's
[56:32] will
[56:32] there's power of his will in you and how
[56:36] that we have that and now we run with
[56:40] all of our might brother Keith and we
[56:43] say I'm gonna do this for God because
[56:44] I'm saved and I'm gonna do everything I
[56:46] can for the kingdom and then we fall on
[56:48] our face why because God us to teach us
[56:51] can't be any of us amen
[56:53] has to be all of him and that it can't
[56:56] be just our renewed will um there's a
[56:58] wonderful book brother y'all know
[57:01] brother blot a from from the cities um
[57:03] he told me about this book um by a
[57:05] ministry from the end of the 1800s
[57:07] blander Murray and he has this little
[57:09] book called absolute surrender and he
[57:12] talks about that how the man has his own
[57:15] renewed will right when he gets saved
[57:17] and he said further Andrew said he had
[57:20] someone come up to him and say this
[57:23] young man he says I know it was God's
[57:25] willing me and he says well did you fail
[57:28] he says yeah but he says it was not
[57:32] God's willing you for God never fails
[57:34] Amen so we know we each have to get to
[57:38] what is it impossible for man amen Oh
[57:42] wretched man though that we are is
[57:45] possible with God praise be to God for
[57:48] the man who learns both lessons amen
[57:52] that it is possible for God that we can
[57:55] move on we can go on in him we're heirs
[57:58] to the promise
[58:01] Amen praise God this is from this sermon
[58:04] on Jehovah Jireh
[58:06] and he says every bit of it belongs to
[58:09] you it's yours I've give it to you it's
[58:12] yours
[58:13] well Abraham was going to fall heir to
[58:15] all of it so he said get up and walk
[58:17] around through the land and see what you
[58:19] own praise God I think God calls his
[58:22] children of Abraham to do that amen for
[58:25] us to get up and walk around to take to
[58:28] to go through their scriptures uh
[58:30] how many times have you taken a
[58:32] scripture verse and you like even
[58:34] brother Brown says you know lay that
[58:36] need right in your Bible you know put it
[58:38] right next to it you lay it before the
[58:40] Lord speak it
[58:41] that's right brother Keith how that we
[58:43] we I think so many times that Satan
[58:46] wants to make the promises of God so
[58:48] ambiguous well Lord you promised in your
[58:50] word in Jesus name Amen and and is this
[58:52] kind of this hope kind of I don't know
[58:54] if I have it but when we can say I
[58:57] remember we had a bill come up my son
[59:01] Levi needed like this retainer for his
[59:03] teeth - straight in his teeth and
[59:05] to test the morning the making but the
[59:07] Lord has already answered the first part
[59:08] and Bethany was at the dentist's office
[59:11] and she goes it's gonna be thousands of
[59:14] thousands of dollars for this and
[59:15] there's there's they have the retainer
[59:17] and they were about to give it to me
[59:18] should I just finance it I said oh honey
[59:22] I think let's just pray about that why
[59:24] don't we just pray about that see if the
[59:26] Lord provides we don't have the money
[59:26] but let's just pray about that and I
[59:29] said and so we went home and we just
[59:30] took that bill of how much it was gonna
[59:33] be and we just put it right in the Bible
[59:34] in Acts chapter 19 and or no we're know
[59:37] in where it says I will provide all your
[59:41] needs I will supply all your needs
[59:42] according in monterrey riches and glory
[59:44] we just put it right in there and we all
[59:46] put our hands on the Bible and we and
[59:48] sometimes we need to do the things
[59:50] Saints for our brain and our mind and
[59:52] and for our of course faith comes by
[59:54] hearing and hearing by the Word of God
[59:55] so to put attention on that and we
[59:58] prayed over it I just felt so inspired
[59:59] to do that and within a week I tune
[1:00:04] pianos as well as play and I had seen on
[1:00:08] Craigslist a piano for four very very
[1:00:14] low cost and it was a grand piano a
[1:00:17] Yamaha grand piano some to half it gaan
[1:00:20] piano and I said why is it being listed
[1:00:22] for so low and it was a tenth of the
[1:00:27] cost of a brand-new and I said this this
[1:00:33] looks like something that we should look
[1:00:34] at so I called up a gentleman I've been
[1:00:37] apprentice in under for 30 years about
[1:00:40] 40 years actually now and I said Tim I'm
[1:00:44] wanting to know if this piano was any
[1:00:45] good he's like oh that Yamaha 7 a
[1:00:48] half-foot c7 conservatory piano he says
[1:00:50] I know I saw that on there he says I've
[1:00:52] been calling everybody up I know say you
[1:00:55] need to buy this piano he says I tuned
[1:00:56] for our church and I said you need to
[1:00:58] pay me to go down there and get this
[1:00:59] piano for you for your church and nobody
[1:01:02] wanted it and I said well praise God I
[1:01:04] went down there and was it was from a
[1:01:06] Pentecostal Church and they were getting
[1:01:07] rid of it and getting a keyboard and
[1:01:09] said and so right now I mean I'm in the
[1:01:12] middle of just I'm just giving it an
[1:01:13] overhaul to sell it and God made a way a
[1:01:16] provision for me to pay for that bill
[1:01:18] through that
[1:01:19] I'm just so thankful saints of God that
[1:01:21] it's a when we're looking when we're
[1:01:23] expecting we're looking for for the
[1:01:25] promise of God's you know to me like I
[1:01:27] grew up in the message and so especially
[1:01:30] for you youth you hear the things same
[1:01:32] things over and over and over again and
[1:01:33] it feels like a cliche like only believe
[1:01:35] only believe and if we see anything from
[1:01:39] Hollywood to only believe means Steven
[1:01:45] oh oh no I dropped it oh I didn't
[1:01:48] believe but that's not it it's we say
[1:01:53] like where the brand says faith is when
[1:01:57] God drops it down in your heart and says
[1:02:00] it's just so and no one can take that
[1:02:04] away from you it's a gift of God we
[1:02:06] don't work ourselves into it and that
[1:02:07] really helped me for you young people if
[1:02:10] you're trying to understand faith that
[1:02:11] faith is when God drops it down in your
[1:02:14] heart and just says it's just so and
[1:02:18] even if you if you don't have it yet you
[1:02:20] go into prayer knees and say lord I need
[1:02:22] this and I don't have the faith for it
[1:02:25] and don't don't kid yourself or don't be
[1:02:28] on it be honest with the Lord you see I
[1:02:30] don't know I don't have the faith for
[1:02:32] them if you don't have to feel like you
[1:02:33] had the faith let's say when I'll have a
[1:02:34] face for this but give me the faith drop
[1:02:36] it down in my heart that it's just so
[1:02:39] unknown no intellectual can take it our
[1:02:40] way for me that it's just so that I can
[1:02:43] grip this promise but it comes by prayer
[1:02:46] it comes by by laying in that promise
[1:02:50] until you get it and taking that step
[1:02:52] ladder of prayer and then also of the
[1:02:55] Holy Spirit having by His Holy Spirit
[1:02:57] how many have had that time where you're
[1:02:59] praying and you're praying and all of a
[1:03:02] sudden it is well all of a sudden there
[1:03:05] was just rest where you just had that
[1:03:07] rest I so remember at one time I got on
[1:03:10] my knees I was working when I was young
[1:03:12] young girl I know I'm still young but
[1:03:17] the and this lady one of my ladies at
[1:03:19] the caribou I worked at a caribou coffee
[1:03:21] she said will you pray for my son he's
[1:03:24] just going through some hard times right
[1:03:26] now will you pray for my son acid I will
[1:03:30] pray for your son Terry
[1:03:31] Terry and so I went home and I got on my
[1:03:34] knees and I just prayed and you would
[1:03:35] think oh well brother Stephen you prayed
[1:03:37] for hours and you labored and and you
[1:03:39] you just don't the word and you just
[1:03:41] stayed there all night and you sweat it
[1:03:43] and everything out and you cried and you
[1:03:44] prayed and and then in the morning and
[1:03:46] the dawn all of a sudden you got an
[1:03:48] answer and that's how it has to be every
[1:03:50] time and that's what I thought and I got
[1:03:53] on my knees and I was probably on my
[1:03:54] knees for maybe six or seven minutes
[1:03:57] maybe and all of a sudden it's gonna be
[1:04:00] alright
[1:04:01] I knew it and you know that sense of God
[1:04:03] when you have in you go it is well with
[1:04:04] my soul and the next time I saw her she
[1:04:08] says Stephen he's gotten through it he's
[1:04:11] all right
[1:04:12] praise God that he gives us those
[1:04:14] answers we pray sometimes we pray and it
[1:04:17] said let that labor of prayer and I
[1:04:18] believe it's almost led that Cup
[1:04:20] it's getting filled up with prayer and
[1:04:22] then the Lord weights so that cup is
[1:04:24] full and then also pours the all those
[1:04:27] prayers of those years in one moment and
[1:04:29] it's over amen
[1:04:31] so the us if we feel like we haven't
[1:04:35] heard from heaven know that we're
[1:04:36] filling that cup with prayers and that
[1:04:38] he's he's watching those he remembers
[1:04:40] the prayers of the saints amen
[1:04:42] so for us to keep enduring to the end
[1:04:46] and keep praying and believing and that
[1:04:48] for you young people you know what only
[1:04:51] believe looks like in a picture belief
[1:04:55] is a funnel over your head and belief is
[1:05:01] you haven't that funnel open and
[1:05:03] unbelief is closing that funnel and
[1:05:06] having to be a roof over your head and
[1:05:09] so that when God comes passing by and
[1:05:12] all of a sudden he wants to do something
[1:05:14] for you were praying and he comes down
[1:05:16] and if you have that roof on your head
[1:05:17] of doubt just pull this falls off over
[1:05:20] the edge and you're like oh I knew I
[1:05:23] wouldn't get it just comes down and it's
[1:05:25] trying to trying to come out it's just
[1:05:26] pouring down for you but just going
[1:05:28] right off the roof but when you have
[1:05:31] that funnel the funnel of belief and he
[1:05:34] comes gummys by when he pours down it
[1:05:36] just goes right in because you're open
[1:05:39] you're open only believe it's just
[1:05:42] you're open to what his promises are
[1:05:45] and that's what faith is it's not this
[1:05:47] Hollywood faith of if I just believe it
[1:05:49] concentrate and I don't break my
[1:05:52] concentration that's faith and I tense
[1:05:56] my body no ah there it is
[1:05:59] no it's just that openness just stay
[1:06:04] open to the Lord and close I put it put
[1:06:07] a roof on your head when it comes the
[1:06:08] devil you men don't let him rooster all
[1:06:10] right bread brother I'm said you know
[1:06:12] any time he comes around tries a poor
[1:06:14] young cuz you know it's God above God
[1:06:15] with and got in and Satan is trying to
[1:06:17] do that - he's trying to be be over us
[1:06:19] shadow over us and a shadow in us and
[1:06:22] through us so he's trying to do that -
[1:06:25] so don't let him come through put that
[1:06:27] roof over your head of the just just put
[1:06:29] it take that word of God and use it as a
[1:06:31] rough right and even when scene comes
[1:06:34] amen
[1:06:35] but then when when the Lord comes just
[1:06:37] praise God just grab everything you can
[1:06:40] amen
[1:06:41] like what like in the Psalms David said
[1:06:44] open wide your mouth and I will fill it
[1:06:46] and and how he says he daily loads us
[1:06:49] with benefits you know you only think
[1:06:51] about this how many you got to work like
[1:06:53] where you got a truck and you had to go
[1:06:56] to work and then you in you had to go to
[1:06:58] the receiving dock and get all your
[1:06:59] supplies and I'm right when I finally
[1:07:02] had a job where I had to do that I was
[1:07:04] like oh my goodness this is just like
[1:07:06] the scripture because I got my lunch I
[1:07:09] got he had my lunch for the day and I
[1:07:10] got its bait lunch and that's the open
[1:07:12] their mouth wine I will fill it so like
[1:07:14] also that I have I have something in my
[1:07:16] tell me for the day to build have energy
[1:07:18] to work and then he Oh he not only daily
[1:07:21] loads my truck with blessings fills me
[1:07:23] up for the equipment for the day all
[1:07:25] those promises he's just filling up
[1:07:27] filling up equipping quick of being that
[1:07:30] that vessel of our life to be able to go
[1:07:32] wrong and do what we need to do and get
[1:07:33] it done
[1:07:34] amen amen praise God amen is this all
[1:07:39] right
[1:07:39] praise God I just want to be a blessing
[1:07:41] to y'all and I just I just know that
[1:07:44] there's more promises that we have to
[1:07:46] take hold of amen I mean you think about
[1:07:48] its going beyond the status quo right
[1:07:50] the status quo my beat well you know I
[1:07:52] know sister and so and so she had a
[1:07:54] promise you know it's pretty good you
[1:07:56] know that was goes all right or oh they
[1:07:57] even had someone
[1:07:59] happens sometimes and if we just go off
[1:08:02] of that Saints our expectation is way
[1:08:04] down here right that simple faith to
[1:08:10] just believe I had this just I just want
[1:08:13] to tell you testimony Chris your faith a
[1:08:16] lady at work her name is Debbie I work
[1:08:19] for Costco we actually had a grand
[1:08:22] opening for the store that transferred
[1:08:25] to I'm in st. cloud yesterday but I was
[1:08:29] working in Maple Grove last year and
[1:08:32] this lady came up to me and she says we
[1:08:36] were just talking about different things
[1:08:37] and she says you know I have tears at
[1:08:40] night where I get I have tears and I
[1:08:43] said I grew up and and I would just I
[1:08:48] would see things in the room I would I
[1:08:51] would it was like my eyes were closed
[1:08:53] but I would see the whole room and I
[1:08:54] would see spiritual warfare and things
[1:08:56] over me and and everything and I would
[1:08:58] just get and sometimes I could feel
[1:09:00] things on me and a lot of times the Lord
[1:09:04] used it even though Satan minute for
[1:09:06] evil sometimes God would use it for good
[1:09:08] if I let something in if I let in a
[1:09:09] movie I shouldn't have been watching I
[1:09:11] snuck in a movie when I was living at
[1:09:12] home he would show me all the spirits
[1:09:14] that that would let in so it was it was
[1:09:17] good for me to for him to show me that
[1:09:19] but there was I said I had that same
[1:09:23] thing and I said mom taught me that that
[1:09:25] you know it's the power and the name of
[1:09:27] Jesus that kicks those Devils out so I
[1:09:29] would start using that and I come
[1:09:31] against the enemy in my dreams and it
[1:09:34] would work every time and it's amazing
[1:09:37] because I said so
[1:09:40] just rebuke the devil in the name of
[1:09:42] Jesus and I saw her
[1:09:45] two weeks later and I was just going on
[1:09:48] my break we we worked for five hours
[1:09:50] stocking in the store and then we go to
[1:09:51] lunch
[1:09:52] and I usually just run to the lunchroom
[1:09:54] and just sit down and I'm just ready to
[1:09:55] just take a nap because it's so hard
[1:09:58] work but I just felt like Steven go
[1:10:01] outside that's it okay I'll go outside
[1:10:04] so I'm walking out the door not thinking
[1:10:06] anything of it here walks in Debbie and
[1:10:08] she just comes in and she goes Oh Steven
[1:10:10] it worked
[1:10:12] I says what worked and she goes she says
[1:10:16] for 61 years I've had I've had spirits
[1:10:21] over my body I haven't been able to
[1:10:24] sleep on my back for 61 years because if
[1:10:29] I sleep on my back it's a vulnerable
[1:10:30] position and so that's when relief
[1:10:32] spirits will try to come and I'm making
[1:10:35] I'm trying to make this Sun scary
[1:10:37] sounding for our audience but she says
[1:10:41] I'd always have to in my sleep call out
[1:10:46] for my husband John John and it's the
[1:10:49] only way I would know because I can't
[1:10:51] wake up I'm so paralyzed and I were just
[1:10:54] called John John and you would know to
[1:10:56] shake me and wake me up for 60 about 61
[1:11:00] 62 years and she says I'd been calling
[1:11:03] the wrong name this whole time
[1:11:05] praise God aren't you glad for that
[1:11:07] saints of God 60 about 62 years achieved
[1:11:12] in she'd been dealing with this all the
[1:11:14] time where Satan had her bound and just
[1:11:18] horrible horrible horrible things every
[1:11:22] night it happened and she said and I
[1:11:25] said I and I saw her again and she says
[1:11:28] Stephen it's so wonderful and she said I
[1:11:32] could sleep on my back it's just so
[1:11:36] wonderful to be able to sleep on my back
[1:11:37] praise God and do you know what it sinks
[1:11:40] of God what's so wonderful and it's for
[1:11:43] each one of us is that we took the Word
[1:11:46] of God we and we sent the Lord Jesus and
[1:11:49] I just said just sent the Lord Jesus
[1:11:52] over to take two for her to take the
[1:11:55] name of Jesus with her and you know what
[1:11:58] the feeling that I felt is Jesus went
[1:12:02] took care of business he really did it
[1:12:05] that she been doing this for 62 years
[1:12:08] and I just one time just freely she
[1:12:12] freely share with what I had received
[1:12:14] and he took care of business just like
[1:12:16] that he just took care of it and it was
[1:12:18] just amazing how it's like if you send
[1:12:20] someone to do something and you don't
[1:12:21] know if it's going to happen or not and
[1:12:23] you don't know
[1:12:26] they're gonna be able to do it or not
[1:12:27] cuz this is an instrumental task you
[1:12:29] know like I said about the status quo
[1:12:30] you know maybe this happened maybe and
[1:12:32] you come back and you hear they took
[1:12:34] care of business it's over that's to me
[1:12:38] what says there's no God like my god
[1:12:40] even though we've seen it before in the
[1:12:42] past when it's personal like that where
[1:12:44] you say there's no God like my god
[1:12:46] he'd take care of it just just speaking
[1:12:48] his name bringing his presence on the
[1:12:51] scene and taking care of his daughter
[1:12:54] Debbie he said she said she told me she
[1:12:58] said when I was when I was having a hard
[1:13:01] time with the Lord
[1:13:02] years ago she said my daughter came to
[1:13:05] me and she said I saw Jesus mom and she
[1:13:10] said he told me to tell you that to
[1:13:13] believe in him and then he's coming back
[1:13:15] soon so it held her in that time I
[1:13:19] tailed her in that time and that
[1:13:21] sometimes we hear silence from God and
[1:13:24] yet how his promises are speaking to us
[1:13:27] saints of God we say the Lord you're
[1:13:29] silent and yet we have a whole love
[1:13:31] letter of 550 500 promises in his word
[1:13:34] and more I has not seen or years not
[1:13:38] heard orders never even entered in the
[1:13:39] heart of man what God has in store for
[1:13:41] those that love them that's not just on
[1:13:42] the other side saying to God that's
[1:13:43] right now
[1:13:44] right here this morning amen praise God
