[26:13] all of those
[26:14] church ages preceding us
[26:17] they had their little portion
[26:20] of the spirit
[26:21] they had the portion that god gave unto
[26:23] them
[26:24] amen it was theirs as an inheritance
[26:27] something that they could have something
[26:29] they could hold on to they had a portion
[26:31] of the spirit that would
[26:33] get them through the age that they lived
[26:35] through
[26:36] amen they they had their trials
[26:39] they had their tests
[26:40] amen but they had the spirit of god that
[26:43] met them in that time that allowed them
[26:46] to get through to the end of their age
[26:48] and to be what god promised would be
[26:50] there was an overcoming to an overcomer
[26:53] to that age
[26:54] amen and so the spirit of god brought
[26:57] them to the end of their age and made
[26:59] them overcomers in the age that they
[27:01] lived in amen amen
[27:03] and then brother brahma also said that
[27:05] here in the last days
[27:07] amen here in the last stage in the
[27:09] laodicean age amen that we would have a
[27:12] portion amen of the struggles of those
[27:16] that went on before us amen we would
[27:18] have some of those start to seeing
[27:20] church age struggles in our day and we
[27:23] would also have a portion of that
[27:25] overcoming power in that day amen with a
[27:27] uniting of all those ages before us
[27:30] coming together amen to ahead in one age
[27:33] the laodicean h where we have the seven
[27:36] spirits of the church they are the seven
[27:38] spirits of christ we have all the trials
[27:40] of the ages going on before us
[27:42] everything coming to a head amen at this
[27:45] age here amen amen so when when when
[27:48] jesus is writing the church writing the
[27:50] letter here to the churches and he gets
[27:53] to the to the sardisian church page and
[27:56] he's speaking to them amen he said that
[27:59] that you have a few names that have not
[28:02] defiled their garments
[28:04] amen
[28:05] amen you know we have the same thing in
[28:07] our age we have a few that have gathered

[45:16] jonah paid the fare to get on the boat
[45:19] to go to tarshish
[45:21] he was running away from the presence of
[45:23] god
[45:24] amen and there was a cost unto him
[45:27] there was a price that he had to pay to
[45:29] run away from the presence of god
[45:31] god said he should do this but instead
[45:34] he went and did this and there was a
[45:35] price that he had to pay for that
[45:37] and so he he dug down into his
[45:39] pocketbook and he paid the fare he paid
[45:42] the price to run away from god
[45:44] amen but god had already paid the price
[45:46] for him to go right back into the will
[45:48] of god amen amen so it doesn't matter
[45:50] how much price that we pay to get out of
[45:52] god's will the price that god paid for
[45:55] us to get back in the will of god is
[45:56] always greater god always paid the
[45:58] greater price because he gave his own
[46:00] life for us amen
[46:02] amen god paid the price for us to get
[46:04] right back on
[46:05] towards the thoughts of him
[46:17] you know in revelations chapter 3 and
[46:19] the
[46:20] start of seeing age there
[46:22] they were talking about the
[46:24] the book of life
[46:29] and uh
[46:34] he said there in verse four chapter
[46:36] three verse four in revelations it says
[46:38] thou has a few names and sorrows which
[46:40] is not defiled their garments they shall
[46:43] walk with me and wipe for
[46:45] for their worth
[46:47] now i already think about yourself how
[46:49] many times do the people say oh you know
[46:52] i'm not worthy of this i'm not worthy of
[46:54] that but but here god is jesus christ
[46:58] itself is looking at a portion of the
[47:00] bride of christ and saying
[47:02] they're worthy
[47:05] now if there's a promise to one portion
[47:07] of the bride there's a promise to the
[47:08] entire bride amen amen amen they are
[47:11] worthy
[47:12] amen
[47:15] amen
[47:17] they shall walk with me white for they
[47:18] are worthy verse 5 he that overcometh
[47:21] the same shall be clothed in white
[47:23] raiment and i will not blot out his name
[47:26] by the book of life
[47:28] but i'll confess his name before my
[47:30] father and his angels
[47:32] amen they the the folks there and sardis
[47:35] the our brothers and sister believers
[47:36] there they had
[47:39] their names upon the lamb's book of life
[47:41] hallelujah
[47:42] amen they had representation there
[47:46] amen when god wrote the book of life he
[47:49] he put their names there and they had
[47:51] representation
[47:52] now
[47:59] that
[48:00] the book of life is mentioned a few
[48:02] times throughout the scriptures
[48:05] moses spoke of it spoke of in the
[48:07] revelations peter spoke of it and and
[48:09] many others they spoke of it you know i
[48:11] think
[48:12] jeremiah or isaiah spoke of it
[48:16] throughout all the bible there's this
[48:18] book called life that that that men have
[48:21] been it's been revealed to them in a
[48:23] little bit it's been revealed to them in
[48:25] a portion of what it is they they
[48:28] they've had a small inkling of what it
[48:30] could be they're not too sure they know
[48:32] that the one thing they do know is they
[48:34] know that god has a book
[48:36] amen and and brother branham he he he
[48:40] said that when you oh if you were to
[48:42] open the book of life
[48:44] he says that there might be many books
[48:46] that have a lot of words in them that
[48:48] say this or that or this or that but he
[48:50] said well the book of life is not like
[48:51] that he says when you open the book of
[48:53] life the only thing that you see in it
[48:55] is names amen amen amen
[48:59] now i want you to if you think about a
[49:01] man that's going to write a book
[49:03] you know if if a man is an author
[49:06] amen he he when he writes a book he he
[49:09] has to make it he has some decisions he
[49:11] has to make hey man now the the motive
[49:14] for a man to write a book is because he
[49:16] has something in his mind amen that's
[49:19] why men write books
[49:21] because he has something that's in his
[49:22] mind amen when he has something in his
[49:25] mind he wants to take it out of his mind
[49:28] and to express it to the world
[49:32] so that the people that are in the world
[49:34] can can see what it is that this man had
[49:38] in his mind amen and then once he shares
[49:41] it with them those folks will have it in
[49:42] their minds amen
[49:45] and so he takes this thought and he puts
[49:48] it down on paper in a book and he begins
[49:51] to expand it out
[49:53] and expand it out
[49:55] amen he decides he has to decide what
[49:58] the beginning of the book is going to be
[50:00] then he has to decide what the end of
[50:02] the book is going to be
[50:04] yes and he kind of breaks up into
[50:07] chapters and he kind of gets a flow of
[50:09] it from the beginning to the ending this
[50:10] is what the book is going to be about
[50:13] and then he kind of breaks he takes each
[50:16] chapter and he widens it out winds it
[50:18] out and widens it out and by the end by
[50:21] the time he's written his book the book
[50:23] has completely expressed the thought
[50:25] that he had in his mind
[50:27] his thought has been completely
[50:29] expressed of what he had in his mind
[50:30] amen then he has a decision he has to to
[50:33] to to to give that book a title
[50:36] something that he can put on the cover
[50:39] stand and whatever title he chooses that
[50:42] title that's on the on the cover of the
[50:44] book has to express what's on the inside
[50:47] of the book
[50:48] so that if anybody wants to read this
[50:50] book wants to experience this book then
[50:52] they read the title of it that that
[50:54] title will kind of express what's on the
[50:57] inside of that book what's this book
[50:58] about amen and you can see the the title
[51:02] you can have the idea of that title in
[51:05] chapter one and chapter two in chapter 3
[51:07] chapter 5 chapter 25 all the way through
[51:10] that book you'll see that title is woven
[51:13] through the entire book amen amen
[51:19] now our god wrote the the the bible says
[51:22] that there are two things that god did
[51:25] before the foundation of the world
[51:27] there's two things he did before before
[51:30] one blade of grass ever grew on this
[51:31] earth
[51:33] before the before the sun ever shined
[51:36] before the animals ever roamed upon this
[51:39] earth before anything like that there's
[51:41] there's two things the bible says that
[51:43] god did before the foundation of the
[51:46] world
[51:46] one is that he took a lamb and he slew
[51:49] it for the foundation of the world
[51:53] amen the other thing that he did before
[51:55] the foundation of the world is that he
[51:57] wrote a book
[52:00] called life
[52:02] and he put a bunch of names on the
[52:04] inside amen
[52:06] before one blade of grass
[52:09] now this this book called life he he he
[52:12] he he he now first of all you know he
[52:16] when you look at a book you have to kind
[52:17] of wonder is the man that wrote the book
[52:20] is he qualified to write about it
[52:23] and so when you think about the book
[52:24] called life well who wrote it well god
[52:26] wrote it well is god qualified to write
[52:28] about life amen well yeah he's the
[52:30] author of life
[52:32] he is not just the creator of life but
[52:34] he is like amen he is actually the only
[52:37] life amen he's the one that gave life
[52:39] hallelujah if there is life on this
[52:41] world it came from god amen
[52:43] he is the only one that can give life
[52:46] amen he is the life giver amen so he is
[52:48] well qualified to write the book of life
[52:50] amen and so if there is only and there's
[52:53] only one form of life that's the life of
[52:55] the lord jesus christ eternal life is
[52:58] jesus christ amen amen
[53:00] jesus christ is eternal life if he gives
[53:03] you eternal life
[53:04] he is giving you of his own life amen a
[53:07] part of him because that's who he is he
[53:09] is eternal life amen so when god decided
[53:11] to to to write a book about life he is
[53:14] writing about his own life
[53:16] amen
[53:17] he wasn't writing about somebody else's
[53:19] life because nothing else had life he
[53:21] was the only one that had life so when
[53:23] he wrote a book called life he was
[53:25] writing about his own life amen and that
[53:29] life is is is it's who he is
[53:32] it's how he thinks it's what he
[53:34] expresses it's what he wants to be it's
[53:37] the
[53:38] that life is who he is
[53:40] amen life is what you any person you say
[53:44] oh he lived for 70 years and then he
[53:47] died well what'd he do with his life
[53:49] what did he do and that he with his life
[53:51] he expressed who he was what his spirit
[53:54] was what his nature natural every man
[53:56] does that every woman does that she
[53:58] expresses he expresses who he is because
[54:02] the life that was in him they expressed
[54:04] throughout their age with all their life
[54:06] and then by the end they have you know
[54:08] like now they have the celebration of
[54:10] life ceremonies instead of funerals you
[54:12] know and then that's what they call them
[54:14] nowadays instead of a funeral why
[54:16] because they're celebrating the life
[54:18] that the person had amen and they and
[54:20] they and they remember what they did
[54:22] with the life that they were given every
[54:25] man and woman on this earth is given a
[54:27] portion of life
[54:28] to do whatever you want to do with it
[54:32] if you do it to serve god's purpose
[54:36] you're expressing that you have the
[54:37] eternal life of god
[54:39] if you do not serve god's purpose and
[54:41] you're expressing that that life doesn't
[54:42] belong to you
[54:44] and that life will be taken away from
[54:46] you that's right
[54:47] that which you seem to have will be
[54:49] taken away the bible says amen their
[54:51] names they blow it off not from the
[54:52] lands book of life but from the book of
[54:54] life amen
[54:57] so god when he wrote this life he wasn't
[55:00] writing about somebody's what wrote this
[55:01] book he wasn't writing about somebody
[55:03] else's
[55:04] life he's writing about his own life
[55:07] amen
[55:09] now how can the almighty eternal ever
[55:11] powerful god
[55:15] that is eternal
[55:16] that is infinite
[55:18] how can he express himself
[55:21] down here in this three-dimensional
[55:23] world
[55:24] how can he express himself
[55:26] to the human race
[55:28] how can he reveal his life
[55:31] upon the earth how can he reveal his
[55:33] life to us how could he write a book
[55:36] that would express his life
[55:39] so when he so when god began to write
[55:42] this book he just instead of writing a
[55:44] bunch of flowerly language or a bunch of
[55:47] deep thoughts or things like that or a
[55:49] bunch of doctrines or rules to live by
[55:51] he opened up the book and he just
[55:53] started writing names
[55:57] these are the names that are going to
[55:58] express my life upon the earth
[56:00] he started writing adam
[56:03] moses
[56:04] each name he wrote that that when that
[56:07] life when that name when that person
[56:09] appeared and was named over them your
[56:11] name shall be moses amen and moses as he
[56:14] grew up the spirit of a god was upon him
[56:18] to express the portion of god's life
[56:21] that he was here on this earth to
[56:22] express and now by by reviewing the life
[56:26] of moses
[56:28] we begin to see jesus christ showing up
[56:30] and we say oh moses was typing out
[56:32] christ when he did this oh moses was
[56:35] typing out christ when he did that and
[56:36] he began to see little expressions
[56:38] throughout his life that we see god and
[56:41] moses
[56:42] why can we see god and moses why because
[56:45] he had his portion on the land's book of
[56:47] life he was expressing the life of god
[56:49] upon this earth how did he do it because
[56:51] the spirit of god was with him the
[56:53] spirit of god was upon him the spirit of
[56:55] god was leaving him amen and as he lived
[56:57] you know to be 150 years old or however
[57:00] long he lived amen
[57:02] by the end of his days when his days
[57:04] upon this earth was done amen we look
[57:07] back at the years of his life and he was
[57:09] expressing the attributes of almighty
[57:12] all-powerful jehovah god through his
[57:14] living upon this earth
[57:18] his life journey is over but his but
[57:20] that spirit that was upon him was so
[57:22] powerful that men and women have been
[57:24] changed by that ministry
[57:26] the spirit of god has moved and moving
[57:29] and has left a trail out throughout all
[57:31] history amen and every time he lands
[57:33] upon someone you know as god wrote their
[57:36] name upon the lamb's book of life and
[57:37] then when that little that little being
[57:39] arrives on the earth amen and the spirit
[57:42] of god moves across their path also in
[57:44] this light shines the light of the
[57:46] gospel shines upon and they spring up
[57:48] and they begin bringing up their
[57:50] attributes of jesus christ they begin to
[57:52] see in joshua and joseph and moses and
[57:56] in mary and everywhere and then paul and
[57:58] peter they began to see expressions of
[58:01] jesus christ and all these believers
[58:03] because they were their names were
[58:05] written upon the life of god and god was
[58:08] expressing his life to the world through
[58:10] these men and women amen amen and he did
[58:12] not stop at the in a.d 30. he did not
[58:15] stop in 1860 he did not stop in ad-90
[58:19] amen the book was written before the
[58:21] foundation of the world amen but there's
[58:23] still names that are upon that book that
[58:26] are being expressed even to our day amen
[58:29] and when you are born here upon this
[58:30] earth and when they cry out that name
[58:33] that you have amen that's given unto you
[58:36] amen and remember god has a new name for
[58:39] you that's it's in glory amen not a new
[58:41] name but it is a but that is not
[58:44] necessarily a new name for you amen but
[58:47] is what the the the perfection of what
[58:49] he expressed for you that name is this
[58:52] great sum of his thoughts towards you
[58:55] amen
[58:57] as so as david said in the psalms how
[59:00] great is the sum of his thoughts towards
[59:02] me though some of his thoughts is
[59:04] completely encapsulated in the book of
[59:07] life amen when you come upon this earth
[59:10] and you begin walking in the holy spirit
[59:13] you are walking in god's thoughts
[59:15] towards you amen you begin to do things
[59:18] that you didn't think you would ever do
[59:19] you began expressing things you didn't
[59:21] think you could say they may you be
[59:22] insane things you didn't think you could
[59:24] ever say you began singing things you
[59:26] didn't think you could sing i mean you
[59:28] could be in testifying testimonies you
[59:30] didn't ever get tested give testimony to
[59:33] you begin to be changed from image unto
[59:36] from glory into glory you begin to be
[59:38] changed into his image why because he
[59:40] wrote about his life and he has given
[59:43] you the solemn duty not just the duty
[59:47] but the opportunity to express the life
[59:49] of god upon this earth
[59:51] by the power of the holy ghost and he
[59:53] has
[59:54] how great is the sum of his thoughts
[59:56] those thoughts are there
[59:59] amen and the thoughts that he had for
[1:00:01] you from zero to three are different
[1:00:04] than the thoughts that he had for you
[1:00:05] from age three to six the thoughts he
[1:00:08] had from you from age 18 to 21 are
[1:00:10] different than the thoughts he has from
[1:00:12] you from age 28 to 31 amen or 28-35 each
[1:00:17] age of your life there's a different
[1:00:19] maturity in christ amen that you are to
[1:00:22] express the life of christ
[1:00:26] david says i was yo i was young but now
[1:00:29] i am old but never have i seen
[1:00:31] god forsake his his seed upon the earth
[1:00:35] amen
[1:00:36] amen
[1:00:38] god has his thoughts towards you
[1:00:40] they've got changed
[1:00:43] they're the they've been laying there
[1:00:44] since before the foundation of the world
[1:00:47] they think lord why am i here what is my
[1:00:50] purpose in the church what am i doing
[1:00:52] here you know you you if you just come
[1:00:54] here and try to to make your
[1:00:57] your so many thousand dollars a year and
[1:01:00] up until the day you retire and die well
[1:01:02] there's no point in that
[1:01:04] we didn't come here to do that amen we
[1:01:07] came here to express the thoughts that
[1:01:09] god ordained for us to express
[1:01:11] that we only do it by the leadership of
[1:01:14] the holy ghost
[1:01:16] again no one else can express your
[1:01:18] thoughts
[1:01:19] no one else can express what god wrote
[1:01:21] that you would express there is a
[1:01:23] portion of god that you are you yourself
[1:01:26] are here upon this world to express amen
[1:01:31] you here are you are the body of christ
[1:01:34] you are his head you know you are you
[1:01:36] are the portion of his body you are
[1:01:38] flesh of his flesh bone of his bone
[1:01:40] filleth his holy spirit amen and he has
[1:01:43] given you a portion of himself to
[1:01:45] express here upon the earth and he
[1:01:47] ordained it for you before the
[1:01:48] foundation of the world amen
[1:01:50] oh you might get into your your your
[1:01:52] moments like brother man talked about uh
[1:01:55] john the baptist says eagle eye got
[1:01:57] filmed over amen you know the same thing
[1:01:59] happens to the bride of christ they
[1:02:01] spend their time their dull moments you
[1:02:03] know they and they their their eye gets
[1:02:05] filmed over and they forget the purp
[1:02:10] the purpose for which they're here to
[1:02:12] express the very purpose for which
[1:02:14] they're here to to be upon this earth
[1:02:16] amen but god brings a revival upon them
[1:02:19] amen sometimes he'll bring trials on you
[1:02:22] sometimes he brings a desperation upon
[1:02:24] you because that desperation is how he
[1:02:26] gets you right back
[1:02:28] to where he needs to be
[1:02:30] amen brother rich he was talking about
[1:02:32] brother isaiah's sermon the other day
[1:02:34] about
[1:02:35] god brings stress upon you to get you to
[1:02:38] be where you ought to be at the first
[1:02:41] to to and to allow you to become who you
[1:02:44] ought to be amen we go through times our
[1:02:46] lives of great stress
[1:02:48] but it causes us at the end of that
[1:02:50] trial to be more than we thought we
[1:02:52] could be why because now we are
[1:02:54] expressing
[1:02:55] god's thoughts and maturity amen
[1:03:00] amen
[1:03:05] let's turn over to psalm 61
[1:03:07] verse 3.
[1:03:28] i'm sorry isaiah 61 3.
[1:03:43] now we'll oh i should start with verse
[1:03:45] one here
[1:03:51] we're going to read the first or the
[1:03:52] third verse and just
[1:03:55] my thoughts on this was what is the
[1:03:57] motive and the purpose of these three
[1:03:59] verses what is god doing here it says
[1:04:02] the spirit of the lord god is upon me
[1:04:05] because the lord hath anointed me to
[1:04:07] preach good tidings under the meat
[1:04:09] he has sent me to brine up the
[1:04:10] brokenhearted to proclaim liberty to the
[1:04:13] captives the opening of the prison to
[1:04:16] them that are bound
[1:04:17] to proclaim the acceptable year of the
[1:04:19] lord and the day of vengeance of our god
[1:04:21] to comfort all that mourn
[1:04:24] to point unto them that mourn in zion to
[1:04:26] give unto them beauty
[1:04:28] for ashes
[1:04:30] the oil of joy for mourning
[1:04:33] the garment of praise for that spirit of
[1:04:35] heaviness
[1:04:37] that they might be called the trees of
[1:04:39] righteousness the planting of the lord
[1:04:41] and here's the motive
[1:04:43] that he might be glorified that jehovah
[1:04:46] might be glorified amen
[1:04:48] amen
[1:04:50] amen because the spirit of the lord god
[1:04:52] cannot be glorified when when when the
[1:04:56] brokenhearted
[1:04:57] are are still broken-hearted amen amen
[1:05:00] god cannot be
[1:05:02] glorified while you're they're still in
[1:05:05] the prison amen
[1:05:06] amen when you are still captive to your
[1:05:08] sins god is not being glorified amen
[1:05:11] that's not the glory and when you're
[1:05:13] still they're bound in prison but it's
[1:05:14] when the those that are bound to prison
[1:05:16] when they're when they're the prison is
[1:05:18] open to them that's when god is
[1:05:19] glorified amen that's when the testimony
[1:05:22] comes when those that are sick amen are
[1:05:25] healed that's when the glory comes
[1:05:26] that's when god is glorified i was sick
[1:05:28] but god came and he healed me amen so
[1:05:31] the spirit of the lord god comes amen to
[1:05:33] what to bring people out from where they
[1:05:36] were to raise them up to a higher place
[1:05:38] why so that god might be glorified how
[1:05:40] is god can be glorified through the life
[1:05:42] of christ being expressed through you
[1:05:45] amen every every type of christ
[1:05:48] throughout all the old testament every
[1:05:50] person that we can look back and say
[1:05:52] moses was the type of christ or joseph
[1:05:54] was the type of christ every single one
[1:05:56] of them that we look at if we look at
[1:05:58] him closely they suffered because of who
[1:06:00] they were amen
[1:06:03] they suffered because they were types of
[1:06:05] christ
[1:06:06] as they were expressing the life of
[1:06:08] christ on the inside they came with
[1:06:11] great sufferings
[1:06:12] amen they were thrown into prison they
[1:06:14] were falsely accused they were sawn
[1:06:16] asunder they were they were driven from
[1:06:18] city to city because they were
[1:06:20] expressing christ on this world and it
[1:06:22] came with great suffering amen amen you
[1:06:25] know the bride of christ has her period
[1:06:27] of suffering and when we have our time
[1:06:29] of trial amen but when the trial is over
[1:06:32] we shall wear a crown
[1:06:34] amen when the end has come we shall wear
[1:06:36] a crown amen amen in the new jerusalem
[1:06:40] how why because how great is the sum of
[1:06:42] his thoughts towards us
[1:06:45] the things that he has thought about us
[1:06:47] is not for us to stay sick but for us to
[1:06:49] be healed
[1:06:51] not for us to stay bound but to be set
[1:06:53] free not for us to stay in prison but
[1:06:55] for the prison to be open that's the sum
[1:06:56] of his thoughts amen the sum of his
[1:06:59] thoughts is not for us to live here on
[1:07:00] earth until we retire he was about to
[1:07:03] take a body change to reign with him
[1:07:04] upon his throne the sum of his thoughts
[1:07:06] has us sitting there in heavenly places
[1:07:09] in christ jesus the th the sum of his
[1:07:12] thoughts has us living there in the
[1:07:14] peace of the almighty god amen i come to
[1:07:17] to to to
[1:07:19] give you rest amen
[1:07:21] amen i come that you ask abundantly so
[1:07:24] that your joy might be full these are

[1:08:04] amen let's turn over to first
[1:08:06] corinthians chapter two
[1:08:10] just here in closing
[1:08:16] it's funny because i just listened to a
[1:08:18] sermon just two weeks ago
[1:08:21] and i was surprised because i i never
[1:08:23] caught it before i heard brother branham
[1:08:25] coughing throughout the sermon
[1:08:28] and i was like oh
[1:08:30] he must have had a little cold or
[1:08:31] something when he preached that one that
[1:08:32] i'd never heard it before
[1:08:34] and then right after that
[1:08:36] i got this little cough and i said now
[1:08:38] i'm doing the exact same thing
[1:08:40] and i just thought that was
[1:08:42] a little the timing of it was so unique
[1:08:45] amen and we go through our hard trials
[1:08:47] in the nature and we in the natural we
[1:08:49] wonder well why does this happen to me
[1:08:51] in the natural
[1:08:53] but we're not here to look at the
[1:08:54] natural things of this world
[1:08:57] we're here to be spiritually minded amen
[1:09:00] first corinthians chapter 2.
[1:09:06] verse 9
[1:09:09] says
[1:09:10] but as it is written
[1:09:13] eye hath not seen
[1:09:15] nor is the year hurt
[1:09:18] neither have entered into the heart of
[1:09:20] man
[1:09:20] the things that god has prepared for
[1:09:23] them
[1:09:24] that love him
[1:09:26] god has prepared something for you
[1:09:29] we haven't maybe seen all of it yet
[1:09:31] it hasn't all been revealed to us yet
[1:09:34] we all haven't caught the revelation of
[1:09:36] exactly what god has for us we maybe
[1:09:39] haven't seen a vision of it with our eye

[1:09:44] vision of it in our spirits amen but god
[1:09:47] has prepared something for us amen let's
[1:09:49] read the next verse

[1:09:55] revealed them unto us oh
[1:09:58] so the eye hasn't seen
[1:10:00] the ear has not heard it it hasn't
[1:10:02] entered into the heart of man but now
[1:10:04] here in verse 10 but god has revealed
[1:10:06] them unto us

[1:10:26] you begin to get heavenly minded and you
[1:10:28] begin to realize that the things that
[1:10:31] some of god's thoughts are you taught
[1:10:33] are great towards you and they are an
