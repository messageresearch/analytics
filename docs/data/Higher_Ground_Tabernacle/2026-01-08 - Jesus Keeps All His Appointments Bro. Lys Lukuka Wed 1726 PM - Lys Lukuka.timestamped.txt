[31:39] place for he's still on time. [music]
[31:45] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus said Martha
[31:50] show me [singing and music] the grave.
[31:56] But she said, "Lord,
[31:58] you don't understand. [music]
[32:01] He's been there for days." [bell]
[32:05] Oh, the gravestone will roll back.
[32:09] [music]
[32:10] [bell]
[32:11] Then [singing] Jesus Christ. [music]
[32:14] [bell]
[32:16] Oh, Lazarus [singing]
[32:18] comfort that somebody [music] said he's
[32:22] alive. He's alive.
[32:25] &gt;&gt; [music]
[32:28] &gt;&gt; for [singing] days
[32:30] [music]
[32:31] [bell]
[32:32] and all hope is gone.
[32:37] [bell]
[32:37] Oh Lord, we don't
[32:41] understand [music]
[32:42] why you've waited so [singing] long.
[32:47] Oh, by his way, God's [music] way.
[32:53] But [singing] now you're so mine.
[32:58] Oh, isn't it great when [music]
[33:02] they late, but he's still on time.
[33:09] Oh, you may [music] be fighting
[33:14] a battle of me.
[33:19] [bell] You've cried to the Lord. [music]
[33:22] I need you right now. But he has not
[33:26] appeared. [music]

[33:30] But friend, don't be [singing]
[33:32] discouraged,
[33:35] cuz [singing] he's still the same.
[33:38] [music]
[33:41] He'll soon be here. [bell]
[33:43] He'll roll [singing] back the stone
[33:45] [music]
[33:46] and he called out your name.
[33:51] Oh, and his [singing] poor days
[33:57] and [music and singing]
[33:57] all hope is gone.
[34:02] And you [music] say, "Lord, I [singing]
[34:04] don't
[34:06] understand [music] why you waited so
[34:09] long."
[34:12] Oh, by his way, God's way. [music]
[34:18] I so mine.
[34:22] [bell]
[34:23] Oh, isn't [singing] it great [music]
[34:26] when he's 4 days late, he's still on
[34:30] time?
[34:34] Oh, isn't it great [music]
[34:37] that I'm serving
[34:40] a God that's always on time? [bell]
[34:44] God [music] bless you.
[35:06] standing.
[35:15] How many are happy to be serving a God
[35:16] that's always on time?
[35:19] You may think he's late, but according
[35:22] to his schedule, God is never late.
[35:26] He's an ontime God.
[35:35] Let's turn our Bible to Jeremiah chapter
[35:38] chapter 29.
[35:48] uh 29 verse 11
[35:51] and I'll try to be short
[35:57] &gt;&gt; and just to try to encourage you
[36:00] tonight.
[36:02] So Jeremiah 29:1
[36:05] says,
[36:09] "For I know the thoughts that I think
[36:11] toward you, sayeth the Lord,
[36:16] thoughts of peace and not of evil,
[36:21] &gt;&gt; to give you an expected end."
[36:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. I like I like how the Amplified
[36:29] Translation reads. He reads like, "For I
[36:31] know the plans and thoughts I have for
[36:33] you, sayeth the Lord,
[36:37] plans for peace and well-being and not
[36:40] for disaster."
[36:48] So God has a plan for each one of us.
[36:51] It's a plan for plan of peace and
[36:55] well-being and not for disaster
[36:59] to give you a future and a hope.
[37:04] And again, I like the the French
[37:07] translation that says
[37:10] so it doesn't just says I know the
[37:13] thoughts, but the French says I know the
[37:15] project I have worked towards you.
[37:22] So God is a project for each and every
[37:24] one of us.
[37:59] Thank you father
[38:16] Lord.
[38:18] as I surrender myself to you, Father.
[38:20] And I pray, Lord, that you have full
[38:22] control over the service
[38:24] and that you bless your children, Lord
[38:26] Jesus,
[38:28] &gt;&gt; as you have made an appointment with us
[38:29] that wherever two or three are gathered
[38:31] in your name,
[38:34] Father, you told us that you will be
[38:36] there. Not not that you will just send
[38:38] your angels, but you personally will be
[38:40] there. Heavenly Father, Lord, we thank
[38:42] you for being here, Lord.
[38:45] as we pray in the name of Jesus Christ.
[38:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:50] &gt;&gt; You may still uh stand. Let's go to the
[38:53] next scripture
[38:56] which is Ecclesiastic
[38:58] uh Ecclesiast chapter 3
[39:07] &gt;&gt; and I'll just read the amplified version
[39:09] but feel free to
[39:14] &gt;&gt; so the Bible in verse one says that
[39:18] &gt;&gt; there is a season and a time appointed
[39:22] for everything and a time for every
[39:24] delight and event or purpose under
[39:26] heaven.
[39:30] You may have your seats.
[39:33] &gt;&gt; So my title for tonight is going to be
[39:36] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ always keeps his
[39:38] appointment.
[39:42] That's that's I was reading a place
[39:44] where the prophet says that's something
[39:45] I can rest assured on that Jesus always
[39:48] keeps his appointment.
[39:54] And then you see when Jesus created the
[39:55] heavens and the earth like he had a
[39:57] whole plan.
[40:01] You know, God is the best events planner
[40:04] that that ever existed.
[40:08] You know, there's no there's no hazard
[40:10] or coincidences with God.
[40:14] Everything that happens in the life of a
[40:15] Christian, there is a reason for it.
[40:19] It's part of the the plans of God.
[40:22] &gt;&gt; Even the the things that seem as if it's
[40:24] it's going the wrong way, it's still
[40:26] part of God's plan.
[40:32] You know, we humans when we try to plan
[40:34] things, sometimes coincidence can can
[40:36] come in the way.
[40:42] But I believe in a God that knows the
[40:44] end from the beginning.
[40:47] And so he had this whole plan of
[40:49] redemption or this whole plan on earth
[40:53] and he has planned every single event.
[40:57] That's why even before I remember one
[40:59] time when people challenged the the
[41:01] prophet wanted to challenge the prophet
[41:04] when the first time the pillar of fire
[41:06] appeared
[41:08] God gave a vision to the prophet and
[41:10] told him exactly where everybody would
[41:12] be seated.
[41:14] No, that event had to happen in order
[41:16] for us to have the picture of the pillar
[41:18] of fire.
[41:20] So, I'm here to remind you that you're
[41:22] not here just in by coincidence.
[41:27] God knew exactly the sit where you'll be
[41:29] seated.
[41:31] God knew the type of clothes that you
[41:33] will be wearing.
[41:35] Why? Because it's part of his purpose.
[41:38] It's part of his plan. But you know his
[41:40] plan, he says it's to give you a an
[41:43] expected end.
[41:51] You know, the prophet says in the
[41:52] message the the oneness of unity.
[41:56] &gt;&gt; He says in paragraph 11, he says, "And
[41:58] you know, that's God's plan."
[42:01] &gt;&gt; God wants people to be one.
[42:04] &gt;&gt; And it's strange to think, but the devil
[42:06] tries to put his plan into existence and
[42:09] make the people one under his plan.
[42:16] Now look what he says. He says, "Now God
[42:18] has a plan and the devil also has a
[42:20] plan."
[42:24] &gt;&gt; You know, and he says the devil is
[42:26] trying to get all the people under his
[42:27] plan while God is trying to get people
[42:30] to be one under his plan.
[42:35] I don't know about you, but I want to be
[42:36] under God's plan.
[42:39] Why? Because in the plans of God, even
[42:41] when I fall short, he is merciful to me.
[42:46] &gt;&gt; You know, one time they even asked David
[42:48] who did he want to be uh uh under which
[42:50] which plan did he want to be under?
[42:52] Whose mercy,
[42:58] you know, under God's punishment or
[42:59] under man's punishment?
[43:03] You know, but David had chose the plan
[43:05] of God.
[43:07] &gt;&gt; Why? Because when God makes you go
[43:08] through an experience,
[43:11] when God makes you, the Bible says that
[43:12] for every temptation there is a way of
[43:14] escape.
[43:18] And in this beautiful plan of God, he
[43:21] says that your his mercies are new every
[43:23] morning. So that every time when I fall
[43:26] short, I know that the mercy of God is
[43:28] new every morning.
[43:33] So, let's go back to uh the Ecclesiastes
[43:35] chapter 3 and continue that chapter.
[43:39] &gt;&gt; So, there's a season, a time appointed
[43:42] for everything.
[43:45] &gt;&gt; And I I like he even used the word for
[43:47] every event. So, this Wednesday evening
[43:50] was part of God's plan.
[43:54] &gt;&gt; He says, "A time to be born and a time
[43:56] to die.
[43:59] A time to plant and a time to uproot
[44:02] what is planted.
[44:06] &gt;&gt; A time to kill and a time to heal.
[44:10] &gt;&gt; And a time to tear down and a time to
[44:13] build up.
[44:15] So there's a time where there's a time
[44:16] where you got to tear things down.
[44:21] And I know we're here to tear down the
[44:23] kingdom of Satan,
[44:25] you know, and to build up the kingdom of
[44:27] God.
[44:28] and a time to weep and a time to laugh.
[44:32] So according to God's plan, there's a
[44:34] contrast to everything.
[44:38] That's why in Psalm chapter 30, I
[44:40] believe David says that weeping weeping
[44:42] may endure for a night by by joy comes
[44:45] in the morning.
[44:48] So don't be too sad for too long.
[44:51] But I'm here to tell you that God has a
[44:52] plan for everything that happens to you
[44:55] right now. It may just be that you're in
[44:57] a season of weeping.
[45:00] &gt;&gt; It may be that you're in a season where
[45:02] you're sad,
[45:05] &gt;&gt; but but you're not just to be in that
[45:07] season forever.
[45:10] &gt;&gt; David tells me that there is going to be
[45:12] a time where joy will come
[45:15] when things are tore down. The Bible
[45:17] tells me there's going to be a things
[45:18] where things a time where things will be
[45:20] BUILT UP.
[45:24] SO LIFT up your head, you know. Don't be
[45:27] too sad about the situation that you're
[45:28] going through right now.
[45:30] JUST KNOW THAT THE BIBLE says that I am
[45:32] not to be here forever.
[45:34] But what I need to ask God is, God,
[45:36] teach me to be patient.
[45:39] No, teach me to to be patient because
[45:41] this is part OF YOUR PLAN.
[45:43] GOD DOESN'T want you to complain based
[45:45] on your circumstances.
[45:47] God doesn't want you to complain based
[45:49] based on your situations
[45:52] but he wants you to trust him who is
[45:55] God. God is the word. So that's you know
[45:58] that's why we get the devil agitated
[46:00] with you
[46:02] is when you are walking in the valley of
[46:03] the shadow of death.
[46:06] YOU ARE STILL SMILING. YOU ARE STILL
[46:09] HAPPY. WHY? Because you know that you
[46:11] you you don't have to stay there
[46:13] forever.
[46:16] Yeah, there is there's going to be a
[46:17] time where the light will come.
[46:20] The Bible even says that in the evening
[46:22] time shall the light shall be there.
[46:25] There shall be light.
[46:28] So walk as a Christian. Walk through
[46:30] your trials as a Christian.
[46:33] That's what makes you that that's what
[46:34] makes the difference between a mature
[46:36] Christian and a baby Christian.
[46:39] Don't walk with your head down all the
[46:40] time. Walk like a son a son of the king.
[46:47] So he has a plan for everything that
[46:49] happens in our lives.
[46:54] You know that's why even in my own
[46:56] experiences
[46:59] I've had like my first car that I had
[47:01] like my sister had an accident two
[47:03] actually all my cars my sisters my women
[47:05] have had accidents with my my cars
[47:12] and then my my sister I think one time
[47:15] she had an accident with one of my cars
[47:20] &gt;&gt; and I'm I'm sure she was really mad and
[47:21] she probably thought I was going to be
[47:23] mad at her,
[47:27] but I just couldn't be mad because I
[47:28] understand
[47:30] that it's God who gives and it's God who
[47:32] takes away
[47:35] that there's nothing she could have done
[47:36] to prevent that.
[47:38] Why? Because I believe that it's just
[47:41] part of God's plan.
[47:45] It's part it's a trial. It's things that
[47:46] it's God. If you have a car, it's God
[47:48] that decides to give you a car.
[47:51] If you if you have a house, it's God who
[47:53] decides to give you a house. If you have
[47:56] a job, it's God who decides to give you
[47:57] the job.
[47:59] &gt;&gt; And then one day you MIGHT LOSE YOUR
[48:01] JOB, BUT DON'T DON'T PUT YOUR HEAD DOWN.
[48:05] JUST SAY THANK YOU. That's why the Bible
[48:08] says give thanks in all things.
[48:12] Whether he gives or he takes away, I
[48:14] still thank the name of the Lord.
[48:17] Rather, it's a time to tear down or a
[48:20] time to build up. I thank the name of
[48:21] the Lord.
[48:24] A time to mourn and a time to dance.
[48:29] A time to throw away stones and a time
[48:31] to gather stones.
[48:35] A time to embrace and a time to refrain
[48:37] from embracing.
[48:40] A time to search and a time to give up
[48:42] as lost.
[48:46] So sometimes even when you look for
[48:47] something you don't have to keep looking
[48:48] forever. Some
[48:52] there is a time where things are to be
[48:54] found and things sometimes you cannot
[48:56] find them.
[48:58] That's why we call them lost
[49:02] you know even even Jesus doesn't go
[49:05] after all after the lost.
[49:09] &gt;&gt; What I mean by that is that there are
[49:11] some who are already predestinated to be
[49:13] lost.
[49:14] They are the seed of Satan.
[49:17] He doesn't bother going for them because
[49:20] he understand it's a time to be lost.
[49:24] A time to keep and a time to throw away.
[49:29] A time to keep silent and a time to
[49:31] speak.
[49:33] A time to love and a time to hate.
[49:36] A time for war and a time for peace.
[49:40] Now let's skip to verse 11. He says but
[49:43] then he has made everything beautiful
[49:46] and appropriate in its time
[49:51] lord I lost my job.
[49:53] &gt;&gt; Oh that's very beautiful.
[49:58] Lord I lost this and that. It's very
[50:01] beautiful because it says all things
[50:04] works for good to them that love God.
[50:08] So this message is just to to encourage
[50:10] you. I don't know whoever who is going
[50:13] through situations.
[50:15] He has also planted eternity.
[50:20] &gt;&gt; And this is what the amplified version
[50:22] says, a sense of divine purpose.
[50:32] heart.
[50:36] Now this is what the amplified version
[50:38] explains in the that verse says it's a
[50:40] mysterious longing which nothing under
[50:42] the sun can satisfy except God.
[50:51] The prophet has explained to us that
[50:53] every Christian you know that's why
[50:56] you know I I think people are leaving
[50:59] the message because they don't read
[51:00] their Bibles.
[51:03] Because everything that the prophet
[51:04] preached is in is in the Bible.
[51:07] &gt;&gt; You know when I when I saw this I
[51:09] thought about the message the pre the
[51:10] prophet preach on thirst.
[51:14] &gt;&gt; He says that every man that is born
[51:17] has God has put in his heart a thirst
[51:20] for God
[51:23] whether you want IT OR NOT. I wonder if
[51:26] he took it from this verse.
[51:29] mysterious longing which nothing under
[51:31] the sun can satisfy except God.
[51:36] The prophet says that some try to
[51:37] satisfy with alcohol.
[51:40] Some try to satisfy with the THINGS OF
[51:42] THIS WORLD.
[51:44] ONLY God can satisfy that curse.
[51:48] There's nothing in this world that will
[51:49] ever take the place of God in your in
[51:51] your heart.
[51:53] So there's a time for everything
[51:58] &gt;&gt; in the message um the mighty conqueror
[52:05] &gt;&gt; paragraph 140. So my subtopic is Jesus
[52:08] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[52:10] forever
[52:13] because I want to know that if he kept
[52:14] his appointment back in the Bible
[52:18] he's still the same today. You know,
[52:21] don't put God as a God of THE PAST.
[52:23] DON'T PUT JESUS as the God of as the
[52:25] Jesus of the past.
[52:27] But he's the same today and he's here in
[52:30] this building right now. The Bible says
[52:32] that and if this Bible said he is risen
[52:35] from the dead
[52:37] that he's the same yesterday, today, and
[52:39] forever.
[52:41] He's got to be the same in resurrection.
[52:45] He's got to be the same in power.
[52:48] He's got to be the same in principle.
[52:52] And I love this part. He says, sorry, my
[52:53] bad. He said, he has got to be the same
[52:56] in every way except his corporal body.
[53:02] I rest on what the prophet said. He's
[53:04] got to be the same in every way.
[53:09] So if Jesus was always on time to all of
[53:12] his appointments,
[53:14] if he's got to be the same in every way
[53:16] today,
[53:17] JESUS IS ON TIME IN MY LIFE. JESUS IS ON
[53:21] TIME IN MY SITUATION. Jesus in your is
[53:24] on time in your whatever things you've
[53:25] been praying for. I'M HERE TO TELL YOU
[53:28] THAT HE'S not late.
[53:30] He's right on time.
[53:33] His time may not be your time.
[53:36] HIS WAY is not your way.
[53:39] You know, but he's on time. I'll read a
[53:42] quote where the prophet says Jesus Jesus
[53:46] always get to places early.
[53:49] He says that sometime he would even
[53:50] leave glory sometimes he would leave
[53:53] glory a few minutes early so he could be
[53:55] on time.
[53:57] Hallelujah.
[54:00] The prophet says in the message of
[54:03] believers thou this
[54:05] he says if you look the word if you look
[54:08] at the word was way back there.
[54:14] and Christ lived years ago
[54:18] and he's not today.
[54:21] So if you're saying that Christ lived
[54:22] years ago but today he's not leaving
[54:27] and you say and you say he's not the
[54:29] same yesterday, today and forever.
[54:33] That's just what you'll get out of it.
[54:38] So if to you God is a God of history,
[54:42] when you read the Bible, you just read
[54:44] the Bible like you're reading a history
[54:45] book.
[54:48] That's why then you will not get any
[54:49] experiences with God.
[54:53] He says it's not to be looked as
[54:55] history.
[54:59] This book change the way you read the
[55:00] Bible. You want to go anywhere with God,
[55:03] change the way you look AT THE WORD.
[55:07] THIS IS NOT TO BE looked off as a
[55:09] history book.
[55:13] It's it's it's to be get down and look
[55:16] up to it and believe it.
[55:20] So Lord, help me to believe your word.
[55:24] help me to to bring this word to quicken
[55:27] this word in my LIFE
[55:30] SO that I also can have a testimony
[55:34] that Jesus always keeps HIS APPOINTMENT
[55:38] YOU KNOW it's not enough to just read
[55:39] books he stories where Jesus kept his
[55:41] appointment
[55:44] what good does HE DO TO YOU I WANT A GOD
[55:47] THAT IS alive today
[55:50] &gt;&gt; and I WANT A GOD THAT ALWAYS KEEPS HIS
[55:55] IF GOD BE GOD, then where are THE
[55:58] MIRACLES?
[56:00] IF GOD be God, then where IS HE? IF GOD
[56:04] BE GOD, then where is he in your life?
[56:08] Where is he IN THIS CHURCH? Where is the
[56:10] manifestation of the Holy Ghost? THE
[56:13] BIBLE SAYS THAT THESE SIGNS SHALL follow
[56:15] the believers,
[56:19] not the believers following the signs.
[56:23] getting Jesus Christ out of history
[56:28] in the unwelcome Christ. The prophet
[56:30] says, "Notice Jesus had entered this
[56:33] Pharisee home."
[56:37] I believe he he left a little early.
[56:42] He's never late.
[56:45] It's right before paragraph 42,
[56:48] you know. He said he's never late.
[56:51] If you believe the prophet to be the
[56:53] prophet of God,
[56:55] then this word should comfort me to know
[56:58] that I can count that Jesus will never
[57:01] be late in my situation.
[57:05] So then why worrying?
[57:07] Why worrying when Jesus is telling you
[57:09] that
[57:11] it's not over yet?
[57:14] Why worrying when Jesus is TELLING YOU
[57:17] I AM still planning to be there on time?
[57:21] You know, maybe maybe when you don't see
[57:23] Jesus in that situation yet,
[57:27] then that means that the time has not
[57:28] yet come
[57:30] because he always comes on time.
[57:34] And Jesus always keeps his appointment.
[57:39] The Bible say Jesus is here tonight. How
[57:42] many believe that Jesus keeps his
[57:45] appointment no matter how or WHERE YOU
[57:48] ARE?
[57:51] IT DOESN'T MATTER THE SITUATION that
[57:53] you're in.
[57:55] Jesus always keeps his appointment.
[58:00] He kept his appointment with Jonah in
[58:01] the belly OF A WELL.
[58:04] He kept his appointment with Daniel in
[58:06] the lion's den.
[58:09] And then he's here tonight.
[58:12] Wherever two or three are gathered
[58:14] together in my name,
[58:18] I'll be IN THEIR MIDST.
[58:20] THAT'S OUR APPOINTMENT, you know. So, WE
[58:23] HAVE AN APPOINTMENT with the King of
[58:25] Kings.
[58:28] Jesus keeps his appointment always.
[58:32] Now, look at what he says. He says he
[58:34] leaves glory maybe a little early
[58:39] so that he can get here on time.
[58:44] &gt;&gt; I wonder if this is why the prophets
[58:46] always advise on coming to church early
[58:52] because we have to be like Christ.
[58:55] He leaves glory a little bit.
[59:01] &gt;&gt; So I'm I'm here to tell you that
[59:03] Jesus is not late in your situation.
[59:08] He's not He's not late. Don't worry.
[59:11] &gt;&gt; Lift up your head. Cheer up. Be of good
[59:14] courage.
[59:16] I'm here to announce to you that Jesus
[59:18] is on his way. I'm here to announce to
[59:21] you. HE WILL EVEN leave his glory a
[59:24] little early to meet you in your
[59:27] situation.
[59:30] So let's let's let's let's read at a few
[59:32] examples
[59:34] in the in the Bible where Jesus had a
[59:38] few appointments.
[59:40] You know remember Jesus had his whole
[59:41] plan and in his plan in this plan he has
[59:45] he has written maybe on a planner
[59:47] somewhere on this specific day I got to
[59:49] go to Iowa City.
[59:53] &gt;&gt; I have to go to walk to higher ground
[59:56] higher ground.
[59:58] Let let let me explain that. Let's read
[1:00:00] the John chapter 4 verse4
[1:00:05] with the story of the woman at the well.
[1:00:13] The Bible says when therefore the Lord
[1:00:14] knew how the Pharisees had heard that
[1:00:16] Jesus made and baptized more disciples
[1:00:18] than John. Verse one.
[1:00:25] Though Jesus himself baptized not by his
[1:00:29] disciples,
[1:00:34] he left Judea and departed again into
[1:00:36] Galilee.
[1:00:39] But then verse four, remember he has a
[1:00:43] God has a planner.
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; He has a plan for everything. And in his
[1:00:47] plan be because he says I never did
[1:00:50] anything before the my father revealed
[1:00:52] that to me.
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; So in other words it's like I never did
[1:00:58] anything without checking my plan first
[1:01:02] without checking the the plan what what
[1:01:04] was I supposed to do today
[1:01:06] and that day he sees that
[1:01:10] and he must need to go through Samaria.
[1:01:15] So according to his plan today I have to
[1:01:18] go through Samaria but remember but
[1:01:20] remember the Jews didn't have anything
[1:01:22] to do with the Samar Samaritans
[1:01:26] you know so usually when the Jews used
[1:01:28] to go through uh uhh to Galilee because
[1:01:30] Samaria was between uh what's the city
[1:01:33] Judea and Galilee
[1:01:37] they usually bypass Samaria to go to
[1:01:39] Galilee
[1:01:46] But then Jesus that day, he was like,
[1:01:49] I must go there. I have an appointment.
[1:01:53] I have an appointment with someone in
[1:01:55] that city. And because I have a
[1:01:57] reputation that I never miss my
[1:01:58] appointment,
[1:02:02] I am a respector of no persons. I don't
[1:02:05] care what the Jews have between the
[1:02:07] Samaritans and the Jews.
[1:02:11] must arrive at my appointment.
[1:02:16] Then he cometh to a city of Samaria
[1:02:19] which is called
[1:02:20] &gt;&gt; Sichar.
[1:02:24] Let's skip uh to verse seven.
[1:02:28] Now you see that the verse seven says
[1:02:30] there there cometh a woman of Samaria to
[1:02:33] draw water.
[1:02:36] So remember I said there's no
[1:02:38] coincidence with God.
[1:02:42] &gt;&gt; SO how come just around the same time
[1:02:44] that Jesus maybe the only time he had to
[1:02:46] go through that city to that well
[1:02:51] the the the only opportunity for this
[1:02:52] woman to to get in contact with Jesus
[1:02:58] and somehow she happened to find herself
[1:03:00] the same place the same moment where
[1:03:02] Jesus said to be there.
[1:03:06] What was it? It was God. The great
[1:03:09] planner
[1:03:16] who always works on both ends of the
[1:03:18] line
[1:03:20] and he's like Jesus is coming this way
[1:03:23] and he's putting in the heart of the
[1:03:24] woman, the Samaritan woman
[1:03:27] around the same time to go get water.
[1:03:31] Brothers, you're not here on by
[1:03:33] coincidence.
[1:03:36] &gt;&gt; There's a reason why only you could be
[1:03:38] here to this Wednesday.
[1:03:43] Amen.
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; So God orchestrated the whole thing.
[1:03:51] &gt;&gt; And what did he do?
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; This woman was a woman that that was
[1:03:55] living with multiple husbands.
[1:03:59] &gt;&gt; You know, she had, I believe, six
[1:04:00] husbands.
[1:04:02] you know and then God was able Jesus was
[1:04:05] able to discern her her life
[1:04:09] and then her life was changed.
[1:04:13] She just needed one one one appointment
[1:04:16] with Jesus.
[1:04:18] That is you don't need multiple
[1:04:20] appointment with Jesus.
[1:04:22] Just one encounter with Jesus is enough
[1:04:24] for you.
[1:04:25] You know, a lot of people claim to have
[1:04:27] encountered Jesus.
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; But to truly encounter Jesus, you will
[1:04:33] never be the same.
[1:04:37] This woman went from living a a life
[1:04:39] with multiple husbands
[1:04:44] to being convinced that Jesus was the
[1:04:46] Messiah.
[1:04:48] So that's the first example
[1:04:50] of Jesus keeping his appoint.
[1:04:54] second appointment that Jesus said.
[1:04:57] &gt;&gt; Let's go to Luke chapter 19.
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; The story of Zakius.
[1:05:06] &gt;&gt; Luke chapter 19.
[1:05:09] &gt;&gt; The Bible says, "And Jesus entered and
[1:05:12] passed through Jericho.
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; And behold, there was a a man named
[1:05:17] Zakius, which was the chief among the
[1:05:19] publicans, and he was rich.
[1:05:24] He sought to see Jesus who he was
[1:05:27] &gt;&gt; and could not for the press
[1:05:31] because he was little of stature.
[1:05:37] And verse four says, "And he ran before
[1:05:39] and climb climbed up into a sycamore
[1:05:41] tree to see him."
[1:05:46] Look what I like. I like what the Bible
[1:05:48] says, "For he was to pass that way.
[1:05:53] In other words, for he had an
[1:05:55] appointment in that city.
[1:05:59] You know, the Bible is precise on
[1:06:01] everything. It even says for he had to
[1:06:04] pass that way
[1:06:07] and when Jesus came to the place,
[1:06:11] he looked up and saw him and said unto
[1:06:14] him,
[1:06:15] &gt;&gt; so imagine this guy that was too short.
[1:06:19] He's on a place thinking that no one can
[1:06:21] see him.
[1:06:23] But Jesus knows everyone of of he of his
[1:06:26] of his son.
[1:06:28] He says he'll never lose anyone.
[1:06:31] You can never hide from God. If you are
[1:06:35] God, he's always going to find you.
[1:06:38] You don't find God, but he finds you.
[1:06:42] You know, Zakius probably didn't think
[1:06:44] it was that important.
[1:06:46] that Jesus probably that day he had to
[1:06:49] look at his planner again.
[1:06:53] He's like, I have to go through Jericho
[1:06:56] because I have an appointment with my
[1:06:57] son.
[1:06:59] Even though my son was not in a
[1:07:01] condition where he was serving God,
[1:07:05] God still had an appointment with him.
[1:07:09] So it doesn't matter your your your
[1:07:11] circumstance. It doesn't matter how deep
[1:07:14] you are in sin.
[1:07:16] The day that God has appointed you to be
[1:07:18] delivered of all those sins,
[1:07:21] you will be delivered. There's not
[1:07:24] enough demons in hell to keep you from
[1:07:25] being delivered.
[1:07:28] God's purpose will always prevail.
[1:07:32] He said, "And when Jesus came to the
[1:07:35] place, he says, "Look up." He saw him
[1:07:36] and said unto him,
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; he said, "Zakius,
[1:07:41] &gt;&gt; make haste
[1:07:43] &gt;&gt; and come down."
[1:07:45] Why? For today
[1:07:48] when the day that was appointed for you.
[1:07:52] The Bible says there is a season and a
[1:07:54] time for everything.
[1:07:58] So that was Zakius day.
[1:08:02] So everyone of every one of you, you
[1:08:04] have a day appointed with the Lord Jesus
[1:08:06] Christ
[1:08:08] and no one is going to take your place
[1:08:09] in that day. There were multiple people
[1:08:12] on the roads, but no one could take
[1:08:15] Zaki's position.
[1:08:19] There were even maybe way taller people
[1:08:21] in the land that day.
[1:08:25] But the world would say it was
[1:08:27] coincidence
[1:08:30] that somehow when Jesus walks
[1:08:34] and he just gets by the tree where the
[1:08:36] tree where Zakius was
[1:08:40] and he looks up to Zakius it's not
[1:08:43] coincidence. He knew
[1:08:47] you know he says he says for today I
[1:08:50] must abide at thy house.
[1:08:54] Jesus is the same yesterday, today and
[1:08:57] forever.
[1:08:59] Every one of you, you have a day that
[1:09:00] the Lord must abide in your house.
[1:09:04] The Bible even says that in that they do
[1:09:06] not resist the Lord.
[1:09:09] You know, some resist the Lord. And the
[1:09:12] Bible says that in the the the the the
[1:09:14] children of Israel in the wilderness,
[1:09:16] they failed to enter into that REST
[1:09:22] because they didn't believe in the Lord
[1:09:24] for that day.
[1:09:27] But but the Paul says, "But you do not
[1:09:29] hearken your harden your heart."
[1:09:34] You have a day that the Lord is going to
[1:09:36] come to your house.
[1:09:38] But I might say, "Lord, prepare me.
[1:09:41] Lord, prepare me for the day that you're
[1:09:43] going to visit me.
[1:09:46] That's why THE BIBLE SAYS that the bride
[1:09:49] had to make herself ready.
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; Lord, prepare me
[1:09:56] and he made haste
[1:09:59] and then look, Jesus didn't tell Zakius.
[1:10:02] Zakius, slowly come down from the tree.
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; Make haste.
[1:10:12] That's why the Bible says the prophet
[1:10:14] repent quickly.
[1:10:17] When the Lord knocks at your door,
[1:10:21] if you wait too long,
[1:10:23] he's going to move right on and you will
[1:10:26] be left behind.
[1:10:29] Amen.
[1:10:30] You know, and because he had an a time
[1:10:32] appointed in verse 9, he even says, "And
[1:10:36] Jesus said unto him, this day is
[1:10:38] salvation come to this house."
[1:10:42] Remember the subtopic is Jesus is the
[1:10:44] same yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:10:48] You have children that you want to be
[1:10:50] saved.
[1:10:53] I'm here to tell you that there's going
[1:10:54] there's a day appointed for them
[1:10:58] where you too you can be like Zakius.
[1:11:01] You can be like today salvation has come
[1:11:04] into my house.
[1:11:08] So stop looking at Jesus as the Jesus of
[1:11:10] history
[1:11:12] because the purpose is that he will just
[1:11:13] be a Jesus of a history to you but he's
[1:11:17] the same today and today and forever.
[1:11:20] Lord, I also need you in my house.
[1:11:24] I'm here to tell you the Lord is on his
[1:11:26] way.
[1:11:28] There is a day appointed for your
[1:11:30] children to be saved.
[1:11:33] There is a day appointed that you can
[1:11:34] also say salvation has come into my
[1:11:36] house.
[1:11:40] For so much as he also is a son of
[1:11:42] Abraham.
[1:11:48] So that was the second appointment.
[1:11:51] So so far we know Jesus keeps his word.
[1:11:54] He keeps his appointment. And you may
[1:11:56] wonder
[1:11:58] you know some you know sometimes the way
[1:12:00] with Jesus is he may let you may only
[1:12:03] have a few minutes left on earth.
[1:12:08] It seems like not even left on earth but
[1:12:10] it seems like in your situation time is
[1:12:11] running out.
[1:12:16] It keeps on looking worse and worse.
[1:12:20] The third appointment was the thief on
[1:12:22] the thief on the cross.
[1:12:25] Things started getting worse and worse
[1:12:27] for the thief.
[1:12:30] The first the first event he went to
[1:12:32] steal
[1:12:34] or he did whatever wrong he did
[1:12:37] and then the second event he was caught.
[1:12:41] Oh, I used I used to steal but I never
[1:12:43] got caught.
[1:12:46] But then today I got caught.
[1:12:49] &gt;&gt; So things are getting worse for me.
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; But then when he he just thought that
[1:12:53] okay I just got caught.
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; But then they're like you going to be
[1:12:58] crucified.
[1:13:00] &gt;&gt; He's like oh it's worseer again.
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; It's worse again. And he's like, "Okay,
[1:13:07] you're going to be crucified, but if you
[1:13:08] don't meet the Lord, he knew that he was
[1:13:13] going to go to hell. He was going to be
[1:13:14] lost."
[1:13:17] Because you remember on the cross, he
[1:13:18] acknowledges wrong.
[1:13:20] HE says that Jesus didn't deserve this,
[1:13:23] but we deserve to be on this place.
[1:13:31] But Jesus knew that he had an
[1:13:32] appointment with one of his sons.
[1:13:39] That's right. Even on the cross,
[1:13:42] Jesus had an appointment.
[1:13:46] Don't be discouraged, brothers and
[1:13:47] sisters. It's never too late for God.
[1:13:51] This thief on the cross thought that it
[1:13:53] was too late for him.
[1:13:56] Maybe he didn't even know he was going
[1:13:57] to be crucified next to the Lord and
[1:13:59] Savior.
[1:14:06] And he says, he says verse Luke 23:43
[1:14:09] says, "And Jesus said unto him,
[1:14:12] verily I say unto thee,
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; today
[1:14:18] in my planner,
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; today
[1:14:24] thou shalt be with me in paradise."
[1:14:28] So his situation got changed from worse
[1:14:31] to to better
[1:14:34] because paradise was a better place.
[1:14:38] His situation got changed from worst to
[1:14:41] better.
[1:14:45] There is a time for weeping.
[1:14:48] But now that was the time for joy.
[1:14:51] I am sure on the way to the cross he was
[1:14:53] crying.
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; Oh, if only I knew better. You know
[1:14:57] sometimes when you do something wrong
[1:15:00] you start feeling guilty and you start
[1:15:02] you start crying out to God you know you
[1:15:05] start regretting Lord if I had known I
[1:15:08] would have not done this I would have
[1:15:11] not done that
[1:15:13] but then
[1:15:14] weeping endureth by for night
[1:15:21] but Jesus had an appointment with him
[1:15:23] even on the cross
[1:15:25] he was still faithful to his
[1:15:27] appointment.
[1:15:29] You know the cross you might have been
[1:15:31] might have been considered one of the
[1:15:32] weak the weakest points in in the life
[1:15:34] of Jesus
[1:15:38] that the that whole journey. You
[1:15:40] remember
[1:15:42] even in when he was praying
[1:15:45] he got so weak that he even asked if
[1:15:48] this cup may be gone away from me.
[1:15:55] He was even crying, "Father, father, why
[1:15:57] have you for forgotten me or forsook
[1:15:59] me?"
[1:16:01] He was in his weakest moment.
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; But even in his weakest moments,
[1:16:10] he still was faithful
[1:16:12] to his appointment.
[1:16:14] What about now that he's been lifted up
[1:16:17] and now he's at the right hand of God?
[1:16:21] The pro the prophet says the right hand
[1:16:23] of God means the power of God.
[1:16:26] ALL POWER has been given to me.
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; Now you think he's not going to keep his
[1:16:31] appointment with you.
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; Don't be discouraged.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; The fourth one I'm going to wrap up very
[1:16:44] soon.
[1:16:46] We I just sang sang about that. It's the
[1:16:48] story of Mary and Martha and Lazarus.
[1:16:53] their brother died
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; and they went to send someone to tell
[1:16:57] Jesus [snorts]
[1:17:01] about his uh Lazarus death
[1:17:08] and they told him it's he had already
[1:17:09] been two days that he was dead
[1:17:14] but Jesus kept right on with what
[1:17:16] whatever he was doing
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; and they buried Lazarus
[1:17:23] And then Jesus, the Bible says he was
[1:17:26] four days late
[1:17:31] to humans timing according to to our
[1:17:35] timing.
[1:17:37] &gt;&gt; You remember in his time he wasn't late
[1:17:40] because you remember the prophet says
[1:17:43] the the greater your trials the the
[1:17:45] greater God is in your life. The God
[1:17:47] gets the glory in your life.
[1:17:52] The prophet says that Abraham kept
[1:17:54] having more faith the more the longer he
[1:17:56] waited.
[1:18:01] So God was Jesus wasn't late. He was
[1:18:04] right on time.
[1:18:06] And when he came, they're like, "Oh, if
[1:18:09] only you had been here,
[1:18:13] my brother would have not been dead." I
[1:18:16] wonder how many times we apply that in
[1:18:17] our situations.
[1:18:20] Oh, if only Jesus you had intervened.
[1:18:23] If only Lord you could have done this
[1:18:25] then I would have not found myself in
[1:18:28] this situation.
[1:18:31] And a lot of time we say it when we find
[1:18:33] ourselves in bad situations.
[1:18:37] But our Bible tells us that there is a
[1:18:38] time for everything.
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; Even in that situation Jesus was like
[1:18:48] Then I tell you that you will see the
[1:18:50] glory of God.
[1:18:55] Those that wait upon the Lord
[1:19:00] shall renew their strength. There's
[1:19:02] there's a revelation on on patience, on
[1:19:04] waiting.
[1:19:06] You renew your strength the more you
[1:19:07] wait on the Lord.
[1:19:11] Jesus had an appointment
[1:19:15] and he was on time.
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; And you know when Lazarus when Jesus
[1:19:21] spoke the word
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; when Lazarus came out of the tomb
[1:19:26] the Bible if you read it he says like so
[1:19:28] he he came with all the symptoms of
[1:19:31] someone that's supposed to be dead.
[1:19:35] He was bound with like things around his
[1:19:38] hands and they even put things in his
[1:19:40] mouth. He couldn't even speak to say,
[1:19:43] "Hey, I'm alive.
[1:19:56] But my point is that
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; when Jesus speaks a word,
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; you know, Jesus didn't speak uh uh uh uh
[1:20:04] um Lazarus come forth and Lazarus came
[1:20:07] with all those um
[1:20:09] everything that he was done. He didn't
[1:20:11] even say Lazarus come forth again.
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; But when Jesus spoke, there was life
[1:20:20] that was breathed in in Lazarus.
[1:20:24] his word, his life.
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; That's why he says that if you eat of
[1:20:30] this bread,
[1:20:32] &gt;&gt; you'll have eternal life.
[1:20:35] So, he kept his appointment with Lazarus
[1:20:37] and Mary and Martha
[1:20:40] and they gave glory to God.
[1:20:43] So, as I wrap I wrap up, I'm probably
[1:20:46] going to skip something.
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Another appointment that Jesus had
[1:20:53] It was with the saints
[1:20:55] &gt;&gt; in paradise
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; after they died.
[1:21:01] Years went by.
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; But they knew they had a promise
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; that Jesus will come for them one day.
[1:21:11] And when Jesus died, the Bible says he
[1:21:13] went to he went to hell.
[1:21:16] And the prophet explains to us how he he
[1:21:18] he gives an illustration how he went to
[1:21:20] the to paradise.
[1:21:24] You know, the prophet says he knew he
[1:21:26] was coming near the gates of paradise
[1:21:28] where those who heeded the message of
[1:21:30] Noah uh they were waiting because they
[1:21:32] could not go up.
[1:21:38] It's in the message the mighty conqueror
[1:21:40] paragraph 49.
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; You know the key thing it says they were
[1:21:44] waiting.
[1:21:46] What were they waiting on that
[1:21:48] appointment time that they had with
[1:21:51] Jesus?
[1:21:54] Even in hell,
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; even in paradise, even after death, even
[1:22:00] in death,
[1:22:02] he was still faithful to to his
[1:22:04] appointment.
[1:22:06] Jesus will never fail you.
[1:22:10] And I I won't read deep into it. But the
[1:22:12] prophet says that another place the same
[1:22:15] scripture he says these are those who
[1:22:17] waited patiently for this hour.
[1:22:22] He's saying that was that was what Jesus
[1:22:24] was telling the father when he was
[1:22:26] bringing the saints to enter heaven.
[1:22:30] &gt;&gt; He says father I have finished that work
[1:22:32] that you have given me to do.
[1:22:36] I paid the debt for sin.
[1:22:39] I have the keys of both death and hell
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; and your enemy is defeated.
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; And now he says, "And these are those
[1:22:49] who waited patiently for this hour.
[1:22:54] Wait on the Lord. WAIT FOR THAT HOUR.
[1:22:58] He's going to come.
[1:23:01] WAIT FOR THE HOUR.
[1:23:03] Don't Don't be in a haste. Don't be in a
[1:23:05] hurry.
[1:23:08] Lord, teach me how to wait up on the
[1:23:11] Lord.
[1:23:15] There he sets the mighty conqueror,
[1:23:19] trusting in his word,
[1:23:21] believing everything he says, trusting
[1:23:25] him as my all, as my breath, as my life,
[1:23:30] as all that I have. Tonight, I fully
[1:23:33] surrender myself to him.
[1:23:37] soul, body, and spirit
[1:23:41] looking for his second coming in glory.
[1:23:45] When I'm sad, WHEN I'M SAD, I TRUST HIM.
[1:23:50] WHEN I AM GLAD, I TRUST HIM. WHEN I AM
[1:23:54] SICK, I TRUST HIM. AND WHEN I am lost, I
[1:23:59] TRUST HIM. WHATEVER BEFALLS ME, I trust
[1:24:03] him.
[1:24:05] I TRUST IN GOD.
[1:24:08] I SAW THE LORD AND HE HEARD ME. I TRUST
[1:24:12] IN GOD. BUT PUT YOUR TRUST IN THE LORD.
[1:24:16] WHY? BECAUSE HE always keeps HIS
[1:24:18] APPOINTMENT.
[1:24:20] HE'S never late. [snorts] He's always on
[1:24:23] time. He is a He has a reputation for
[1:24:26] being on time.
[1:24:30] You know, we had a situation with
[1:24:31] immigrations.
[1:24:34] It took about 10 years
[1:24:37] that we had been waiting for an answer
[1:24:39] for immigration,
[1:24:42] you know, we started getting worried,
[1:24:44] you know, with everything that that's
[1:24:45] happening with the administration
[1:24:48] administration.
[1:24:51] But in God's mind,
[1:24:54] he knew that there would be a day,
[1:24:57] there would be a day that would be
[1:24:59] appointed where we would get our papers.
[1:25:04] And he had that planned before the
[1:25:06] foundation of the world.
[1:25:09] And then in his own time,
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; he made all things beautiful.
[1:25:18] Whatever you're waiting for, whatever
[1:25:20] you've been praying for for years, for
[1:25:22] months, for weeks,
[1:25:27] &gt;&gt; when that things come,
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; you'll say like the song says,
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; "Look what the Lord has done."
[1:25:36] Amen.
[1:25:37] &gt;&gt; What we've been waiting for
[1:25:41] has now come to pass.
[1:25:44] Now I can also say he always keeps his
[1:25:48] appointment.
[1:25:50] I can always say that he's the same
[1:25:53] yesterday, today and forever.
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; I was I was in need of him in for
[1:25:58] immigration.
[1:26:00] And he answered.
[1:26:02] You are in need of him.
[1:26:05] He's there to answer to you. I'm going
[1:26:08] to close with this one.
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; We have an upcoming appointment with the
[1:26:13] Lord.
[1:26:18] We have two. We had two.
[1:26:22] One is in Luke 17:30.
[1:26:29] The Bible says in Luke 17:30
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; that even thus shall it be in the day
[1:26:38] that day that appointed day
[1:26:42] when the son of man is revealed.
[1:26:47] So he's not revealed any other time but
[1:26:49] there is a specific day
[1:26:54] and and if you read right before that
[1:26:56] verse he'll he give he gives us the sign
[1:26:58] whatever happened in the time of Noah
[1:27:01] Sodom and Gomorrah
[1:27:03] and we are seeing those things happening
[1:27:05] in our day.
[1:27:08] So then by reading the scripture we have
[1:27:10] a revelation or an understanding that
[1:27:15] there's an appointment for the son of
[1:27:17] man to be revealed.
[1:27:22] And in Malachi 4 verse 5-6
[1:27:27] he says again before the grateful day of
[1:27:30] the Lord
[1:27:33] I will send you Elijah the prophet
[1:27:37] before that day I have an appointment
[1:27:39] with this generation
[1:27:43] that I will send them Elijah the prophet
[1:27:47] and The prophet explained to us that he
[1:27:49] was just a son of man revealing the son
[1:27:52] of man.
[1:27:54] What did the son of man did do?
[1:27:58] If you read the bible, if you really are
[1:28:00] a bible reader,
[1:28:02] you will see that Jesus discerned the
[1:28:04] thoughts of men.
[1:28:07] Even when he went to Pharisees, the
[1:28:09] assimon the Pharisees house
[1:28:12] when the Bible says the Pharisees were
[1:28:14] murmuring in their heart within
[1:28:16] themselves.
[1:28:19] But Jesus heard that and he spoke to
[1:28:21] them what they were remembering about.
[1:28:25] &gt;&gt; So through everywhere throughout the
[1:28:27] Bible you even Philillip and Nathaniel
[1:28:30] Nathaniel. He says where you were under
[1:28:33] the tree before Philip CALLED YOU.
[1:28:36] I SAW YOU.
[1:28:39] WHAT was that? It was Jesus in the
[1:28:41] ministry of a prophet. He was the son of
[1:28:44] man's ministry. And he promised that in
[1:28:47] our day, I have an appointment with
[1:28:50] Leicia.
[1:28:51] I have an appointment with this
[1:28:53] generation.
[1:28:55] And I have a reputation for always
[1:28:57] keeping my appointment.
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; And when we we see the message looking
[1:29:04] for Jesus,
[1:29:07] the prophet says, "Yes, sir.
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; You believe me to be HIS PROPHET.
[1:29:13] &gt;&gt; YOU have a mighty good faith.
[1:29:17] HE SAYS NOW YOU ARE SUFFERING with a
[1:29:19] stomach trouble.
[1:29:23] Is that right?
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; It's caused from a peptic peptic
[1:29:29] condition in your stomach.
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; Here is now the prophet discerning
[1:29:37] what was wrong in the in the in the life
[1:29:39] of this brother.
[1:29:42] He says you also are a very nervous
[1:29:45] person.
[1:29:47] That's what's causing the stomach
[1:29:49] condition
[1:29:52] and doing that has caused you to have
[1:29:55] hemoroid
[1:29:57] hemorrhoid
[1:29:59] hemorrhoid. I see you I see you having
[1:30:02] some kind of trouble coughing.
[1:30:07] He says it's a as asthmatic condition.
[1:30:14] Isn't that right?
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; And you also have a a heart trouble.
[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; This brother had a lot of health
[1:30:21] problems.
[1:30:25] But it's never too big for God.
[1:30:30] He said, "Is that right? You believe me
[1:30:32] to be his prophet?
[1:30:35] Then I see somebody standing near your
[1:30:38] side.
[1:30:39] So he's having a vision.
[1:30:41] He says, "It's a woman.
[1:30:44] &gt;&gt; It's your wife.
[1:30:46] She's got some," you know. So the same
[1:30:48] way that Jesus could see Nathaniel under
[1:30:50] the tree.
[1:30:53] Now the prophet is having a vision
[1:30:56] and he's seeing a woman and he says,
[1:30:59] "It's your wife.
[1:31:01] She's got something wrong with her on
[1:31:03] her face.
[1:31:05] and it's cancer.
[1:31:08] And he says, "Is that right? And look,
[1:31:12] your house number
[1:31:14] is 1154
[1:31:17] on McKinley Street,
[1:31:23] this morning, this tonight. The same
[1:31:26] Lord Jesus Christ know your house
[1:31:27] address.
[1:31:30] He knows how many turns you have to make
[1:31:31] to be home.
[1:31:34] The Lord Jesus Christ knows how many
[1:31:36] turns Satan has to make to reach your
[1:31:38] house.
[1:31:40] Then he set up ambushes. He set up an
[1:31:43] ambush
[1:31:46] so that Satan doesn't get near your
[1:31:48] house.
[1:31:52] You know he's the same yesterday, today,
[1:31:54] and forever.
[1:31:56] He says, "And your name is CBI."
[1:32:01] The Lord Jesus Christ is the same today.
[1:32:04] He knows your name. He knows your spouse
[1:32:07] name. He know your family member's name.
[1:32:10] He knows those that you've been praying
[1:32:12] for. He knows every one of those names.
[1:32:16] And even those that you forgot to pray
[1:32:17] for.
[1:32:19] He knows their names.
[1:32:22] You know,
[1:32:23] &gt;&gt; is that right? He says, "Go home and be
[1:32:26] made well.
[1:32:28] lay lay your hand on your wife in the
[1:32:31] name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; Did he keep his appointment?
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; He sent us a prophet,
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; the son of man, which is God in a Jesus
[1:32:44] in a in a prophet form. In a prophetic
[1:32:47] form,
[1:32:50] a prophet revealing Jesus Christ to us.
[1:32:55] He kept that appointment with us.
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; And there are many instances of like
[1:33:02] discerning if you know the message.
[1:33:06] The last one
[1:33:08] is he has we have an upcoming
[1:33:10] appointment. This is to to encourage you
[1:33:13] for the future.
[1:33:16] We have an appointment with God
[1:33:20] to s with him.
[1:33:23] He promised to come back and get his
[1:33:25] bride.
[1:33:29] He has a day appointed for it.
[1:33:35] He says, he says, "We have an
[1:33:36] appointment with him to s with him."
[1:33:41] &gt;&gt; Let's read Revelation 19:7.
[1:33:45] The Bible says, "Let us be glad and
[1:33:48] rejoice
[1:33:51] and give honor to him
[1:33:57] for the marriage of the lamb is come."
[1:34:02] So in other words, for that day, the day
[1:34:04] of the marriage, that appointment,
[1:34:08] the appointment with you, his bride,
[1:34:13] that appointment has come.
[1:34:16] In other words, he kept his his
[1:34:18] appointment,
[1:34:20] and his wife has made herself ready.
[1:34:26] And he say unto me, write,
[1:34:29] &gt;&gt; blessed are they which are called unto
[1:34:31] the marriage of the supper of the lamb.
[1:34:39] He has an appointment. Will you be
[1:34:42] there?
[1:34:44] He keeps his appointment. But do you?
[1:34:50] Jesus is going to be there whether you
[1:34:52] you there or not.
[1:34:54] But do you keep yours?
[1:34:58] &gt;&gt; We may stand. We have an appointment
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; with Jesus Christ.
[1:35:05] &gt;&gt; And in that appointment, he says
[1:35:08] there, I will wipe away all tears from
[1:35:11] their eyes.
[1:35:15] All the tears that you've been shedding,
[1:35:19] I will wipe your tears from your eyes.
[1:35:23] And there shall be no more death,
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; neither sorrow,
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; nor crying,
[1:35:31] neither shall there be any more pain,
[1:35:35] &gt;&gt; for the former things are passed away,
[1:35:39] &gt;&gt; and he said unto me in verse six,
[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; it is done.
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; I kept my appointment.
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; I am Alpha and Omega.
[1:35:52] I am the beginning and the end.
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; He keeps his appointment.
[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; So Lord prepare me
[1:36:03] &gt;&gt; so that my day when my day comes I am
[1:36:06] ready.
[1:36:08] &gt;&gt; You know the prophet I just for the sake
[1:36:09] of time I'm not going to read that
[1:36:10] quote. It's here somewhere.
[1:36:13] The prophet says he's going to let me
[1:36:17] just read that. He says that um
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; um let me find the quotes
[1:36:28] if I even have it here. No. Okay, I'll
[1:36:30] probably just paraphrase it. I don't
[1:36:32] know where I put that.
[1:36:37] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah, I found it. the the worst
[1:36:38] sinner in the city.
[1:36:41] The pro the prophet says this, "There
[1:36:43] said Jesus,
[1:36:46] dirty foot [snorts] stinking, nobody
[1:36:49] paying any attention to him." And I
[1:36:52] encourage you to go listen to the
[1:36:53] message, the worst sinner in the city.
[1:36:56] The prophet explains how we, you know,
[1:36:58] we invite Jesus
[1:37:01] and he always will come.
[1:37:04] But how do we entertain him?
[1:37:09] Many time we leave Jesus we we care
[1:37:11] about everything else but Jesus
[1:37:14] and he's there we're sitting with dirty
[1:37:16] food stinking
[1:37:19] nobody paying any attention to him. In
[1:37:22] other words, nobody paying attention to
[1:37:23] the word.
[1:37:25] Oh Jesus come in my house. But then you
[1:37:28] go a week without reading your Bible.
[1:37:31] You go a week without praying. But yet
[1:37:33] you invited Jesus to come to your house
[1:37:35] that day.
[1:37:37] You know the prophet gave a story of
[1:37:39] this one man. One time he invited Jesus
[1:37:42] for a dinner at his house.
[1:37:46] You know he invited Jesus and then he
[1:37:48] prepared a good meal for Jesus.
[1:37:53] But then he was disappointed because he
[1:37:54] Jesus didn't show up according to him.
[1:37:59] But then there was a beggar that came in
[1:38:01] the door
[1:38:03] and he asked for food.
[1:38:06] And this man said, "No, I don't have any
[1:38:08] food
[1:38:10] because what I have, I have prepared
[1:38:12] that for someone else."
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; You know, Jesus may not come in the form
[1:38:16] that you expect to expect him to come.
[1:38:19] But he always comes.
[1:38:22] I wonder if some of us have has missed
[1:38:25] Jesus.
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; Lord, if I have missed you, I pray that
[1:38:29] you come back again
[1:38:32] and condition my heart.
[1:38:35] Open my eyes that I may see you, LORD.
[1:38:38] May you maybe you came in the form of my
[1:38:40] brother. Maybe you came in the form of
[1:38:43] my sister, maybe my coworker,
[1:38:47] but I missed you.
[1:38:50] I missed you. Maybe that one day if I
[1:38:53] had open my Bible, you were going to
[1:38:55] reveal yourself to me.
[1:38:58] But I missed you, Lord. Dirty food
[1:39:01] stinking.
[1:39:03] Nobody paying any attention to him.
[1:39:08] You know, history repeats itself.
[1:39:11] I just pray that we pay attention more
[1:39:13] to Jesus.
[1:39:14] He says he was left. He left his place
[1:39:17] up there where he was ministering to the
[1:39:18] people.
[1:39:21] He walked two days down through the sun
[1:39:28] and had to start a little early.
[1:39:32] There there's a pattern to Jesus always
[1:39:34] coming early.
[1:39:36] He says he never misses an appointment.
[1:39:39] He always keeps his appointment. I love
[1:39:42] him for that. He keeps his appointment.
[1:39:46] That's the reason tonight I got
[1:39:48] confidence IN HIM.
[1:39:50] THAT'S THE reason tonight I've got
[1:39:52] confidence that the creator of heaven
[1:39:54] and earth is right here.
[1:39:58] He said he's never failed and he will
[1:40:01] never fail. But he says, "And remember,
[1:40:03] men and women,
[1:40:05] boy and girl,
[1:40:08] you got an appointment, too.
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; You got an appointment with him.
[1:40:13] &gt;&gt; You're going to either meet him in peace
[1:40:15] here or you're going to meet him at the
[1:40:17] judgment.
[1:40:20] Whether you want whether you want it or
[1:40:22] not, God has already an appointment with
[1:40:24] each and every one of us.
[1:40:27] It's your choice. Do you want to meet
[1:40:30] him in judgment? or do you want to meet
[1:40:32] him in peace?
[1:40:34] He says, but you're going to keep that
[1:40:36] appointment.
[1:40:39] That's one thing you're going to do.
[1:40:43] So, you don't even have a choice.
[1:40:45] He says, "That's right." He keeps his
[1:40:50] Lord, prepare me. I want to make my life
[1:40:52] ready cuz I don't know when my time will
[1:40:54] come.
[1:40:56] you know,
[1:40:58] I'm sure January 1st of 2025
[1:41:02] some people were looking forward to
[1:41:04] seeing 2026,
[1:41:09] they are no longer part of this world.
[1:41:13] How do you know you're not next?
[1:41:17] But he's given you room to repent.
[1:41:21] The bride made herself ready.
[1:41:25] by our head. Lord Jesus, I pray that you
[1:41:29] help us to make ourselves ready.
[1:41:32] Lord Jesus, I pray that you search our
[1:41:34] lives.
[1:41:36] And Father, if there be anything that's
[1:41:38] hindering,
[1:41:39] if there be anything that's hindering
[1:41:43] us from meeting you in peace,
[1:41:46] Lord, help us.
[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; Help us to be ready.
[1:41:51] &gt;&gt; Lord, you have an appointment for every
[1:41:53] one of us.
[1:41:56] in 2025.
[1:41:58] There's never been a man that was 500
[1:42:00] years old.
[1:42:04] You will, your day will come somehow.
[1:42:07] &gt;&gt; He has an appointment.
[1:42:10] Just pray to your heart while the Lord
[1:42:13] is here and ask him
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; to make you ready
[1:42:18] &gt;&gt; or give you the will or the the desire
[1:42:20] to want to be ready.
