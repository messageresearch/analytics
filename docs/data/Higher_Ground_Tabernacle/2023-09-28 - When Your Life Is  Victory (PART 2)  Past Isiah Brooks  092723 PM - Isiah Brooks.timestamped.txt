[33:04] physically just getting over what they
[33:07] call food
[33:12] poisoning and in in announcing
[33:16] this I just want to say I did something
[33:18] that I told you all not to do on
[33:24] Sunday I was very tired
[33:29] night um and we had uh
[33:34] eaten and when I got
[33:36] home the Holy Spirit spoke to me he
[33:40] knew that I was ready for the
[33:44] bed and God spoke to me and
[33:48] says go
[33:51] pray and I says Lord I'm so
[33:54] tired well to make a long story
[33:59] short I went to bed without
[34:02] praying that's a no
[34:05] no God didn't get me I he didn't get me
[34:08] praying I didn't pray when he wanted me
[34:13] to but when those pain start wrecking my
[34:17] body he woke me
[34:20] up I began to
[34:23] pray and I knew what the spanking was
[34:25] all about
[34:29] and I said Thank You
[34:31] Jesus you chasen Those whom you
[34:34] love and so I was grateful I I am
[34:38] grateful
[34:40] still because it could have been
[34:43] worse I disobeyed my
[34:46] wife she had made some
[34:49] soup she left it
[34:51] out and the soup was so good I didn't
[34:53] want it to go to
[34:55] waste so I got me a little taste of
[34:59] it and then that soup got a taste of
[35:05] me we threw the rest of it out if I had
[35:09] eaten a Whole
[35:10] Bowl I would not be here
[35:13] tonight just to think what a spoonful of
[35:16] that stuff did to me to me I can't

[35:42] made me know that those rules or those
[35:45] things stand for me as well it's not a
[35:49] rule but it's something that we should
[35:53] always amen okay let's get to the
[35:55] scripture
[35:57] Matthew
[36:00] 53-18 ye are the salt of the
[36:03] earth but if the salt have lost its
[36:07] Savor wherewith shall it be
[36:11] salted it is then forth good for
[36:16] nothing but to be cast out and to be
[36:19] troden under the foot of
[36:22] men ye are the light of the
[36:25] world now you have you seen this
[36:28] before we are the light
[36:32] he he said light the world a city that
[36:37] is set on a hill canot be
[36:40] he neither do men light a candle and put
[36:44] it under a
[36:46] bush but on a
[36:48] Candlestick and it giveth light all that
[36:52] are in the
[36:54] house let your light so shine
[36:58] that they may see your good work and
[37:01] glorify your father
[37:03] which think not that I have come to
[37:07] destroy the
[37:08] law or the prophets I am not come to
[37:12] destroy to
[37:14] fill for verily I say unto you till
[37:18] Heaven and Earth pass one or one t shall
[37:23] in no wi pass from the law till all be
[37:29] fulfilled oh Lord we love the
[37:32] Lord let us pray our gracious father God
[37:36] come before you Lord as as we will how
[37:39] and we thank you Father for tonight we
[37:42] thank you for allowing us to be a part
[37:45] Hallelujah of the service Lord thank you
[37:48] for the chastisement father truly you
[37:51] have taken us to a higher
[37:53] plan and we love you father thank you
[37:57] for it God bless this service in a
[37:59] special way
[38:00] hallelu bless oh God the the visiting
[38:03] friends and brothers in Christ Lord we
[38:07] thank you Father God Have Thine Own Way
[38:10] in Your Name Lord Jesus Christ
[38:12] we amen amen you may be
[38:21] seated when it comes to the word of
[38:25] God
[38:27] many people of
[38:30] today as I said last
[38:33] week they say they know
[38:36] him but there's a difference
[38:40] between false
[38:42] teeth false
[38:45] teeth and the teeth that comes from your
[38:50] body the teeth that comes from your body
[38:53] are those that are yours
[38:57] originally
[38:59] yours and they were in you they were in
[39:03] your
[39:04] DNA hallelujah hallelujah and so when
[39:07] they come
[39:09] forth they come forth
[39:13] connected and and I want to say this by
[39:15] the grace of
[39:16] God uh everything uh you
[39:21] see in this world there's some kind
[39:24] of of an invit IM imitation
[39:29] or but as
[39:31] Christians we don't want anything that's
[39:34] false we don't want to be like false
[39:38] teeth
[39:39] or false leg even those things are
[39:43] they're helpful we use them Hallelujah
[39:47] but when it comes to
[39:48] Christ we want to be
[39:52] connected hallelujah hallelujah and the
[39:54] Bible tells us that God knew us before
[39:59] the foundation of the world and he also
[40:02] tells us that we were in the
[40:06] loin we were in his
[40:09] DNA before we arrived here hallelujah
[40:13] hallelujah so that connection I was
[40:16] telling somebody the other
[40:18] day a
[40:20] Calvary was more more than just about
[40:23] more than just uh how can say
[40:28] uh saving you from your
[40:34] sins was uh what God was
[40:37] doing to
[40:39] reunite to
[40:43] reconnect the body of
[40:46] Christ in other words we sin could never
[40:51] change the
[40:53] relationship because a son is always is
[40:56] a son whether he's good or bad but the
[41:00] blood of Jesus came to restore
[41:05] fellowship and if you are a
[41:08] Christian and you're not fellowshipping
[41:10] with God you missing the entire
[41:14] purpose for what you are been made why
[41:18] you came in this day Hallelujah now this
[41:23] day is the the most evil
[41:27] AG it's more evil than any age
[41:30] before so much so that God in
[41:34] description said as it was in the days
[41:36] of no and as it was in the days of
[41:41] Sodom put two things
[41:44] together and and to
[41:46] multiply to give us a
[41:49] great vision of the evil that we're now
[41:55] facing
[41:57] hallelujah hallelujah but God has
[41:59] ordained you he ordained
[42:03] mej to defeat
[42:06] Satan in his own
[42:08] Eden Hallelujah this country our country
[42:14] are being influenced from what we call
[42:16] the
[42:17] underworld Hallelujah that's why Jesus
[42:20] said I am not of this world Hallelujah
[42:25] and even so
[42:27] we are not from this
[42:28] world this world
[42:31] hallel God so you and
[42:34] I
[42:36] must
[42:38] realize who we
[42:41] are and where we came
[42:44] from you understand me and it's time for
[42:47] the
[42:49] church back to its original
[42:54] strength which is God
[42:57] hallelujah hallelujah as I Illustrated
[43:01] last uh you know I might know that um
[43:05] Biden is the president I have that
[43:08] knowledge of
[43:09] him but Biden don't know
[43:12] me and I don't know him Hallelujah so is
[43:16] it with God a lot of people know he's
[43:20] God but as far as knowing
[43:23] god they don't know him Hallelujah and
[43:27] God doesn't know you either Hallelujah
[43:30] is that right the scriptures cannot
[43:33] lie many people who came to Jesus at the
[43:37] end of the day and said Lord have not we
[43:40] done Miracles have not we done great
[43:43] things in your
[43:44] name and Jesus said unto him them depart
[43:48] from me workers of iniquity I knew you
[43:53] not now understand God Hallelujah God
[43:57] knows everything but what he's working
[44:00] with in this particular scripture is
[44:03] that the
[44:04] relationship you claim to have with
[44:07] me never
[44:09] existed I don't know you he say I once
[44:13] knew you he did not say I once knew you
[44:18] he said I never knew you Hallelujah and
[44:23] he God Only
[44:24] Knows those who
[44:27] connected is that right the Bible says
[44:31] the Lord
[44:32] knoweth them that are
[44:35] his hallelujah hallelujah
[44:38] friends it is time that men and
[44:42] women woke up to the
[44:45] fact that we want to be one remember
[44:49] what I said last
[44:51] week God is calling for
[44:54] Oneness no matter who you are if you are
[44:58] real
[44:59] Christian God expect us to
[45:03] unite by
[45:05] Politics the Bible said by one Spirit
[45:08] are we baptized into one body Hallelujah
[45:12] this is the hour where the Christian
[45:16] drops all of their
[45:18] isms all of their skm you hear what I'm
[45:21] saying hallelujah and they are uniting
[45:24] for one cause
[45:27] and that is to show the world that Jesus
[45:30] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[45:34] forever hallelujah hallelujah we we we
[45:38] announced uh just last
[45:41] week sister
[45:43] Angela

[45:50] cancer two types of
[45:53] it and she God by grace his
[45:57] grace gave her a complete
[46:01] healing so much so that the the
[46:04] hospital wrote up a page or
[46:09] paper you know and and announcing this
[46:14] miracle they were saying how they really
[46:17] appreciated
[46:19] Angela hallelujah amen because Angela is
[46:23] a is a born again
[46:29] a capital
[46:30] B because I've known her for years and
[46:34] no matter what she's going

[46:59] Sister Taylor that was
[47:01] just God raised her from the
[47:04] dead that's the woman I told you when we
[47:06] prayed for her God raised her from the
[47:10] dead and she's still living now serving

[47:31] God in order to be
[47:34] victorious you must know that you are
[47:39] free you're free from the laws of sin
[47:42] and death Hallelujah Jesus Christ has
[47:46] made us
[47:47] free y'all hear what I'm saying in other
[47:50] words when you receive the Holy Ghost
[47:53] there is no way you can be con
[47:57] Hallelujah huj it is God's seal of
[48:00] approval Hallelujah it is not me
[48:03] accepting God it's God accepting me and
[48:07] when God accepts you he seals you with
[48:11] the Holy
[48:12] Ghost hallelujah hallelujah we have been
[48:16] ordained to triumph over our
[48:20] enemy not barely make it you see
[48:23] Christians they barely
[48:27] and really when you do that that's your
[48:30] state of
[48:31] being it shows that your God is
[48:36] weak am and Jesus Christ can't be no
[48:40] can't be any
[48:42] stronger than what your faith will allow
[48:45] him to
[48:46] be your
[48:48] ration Jesus Christ will determine your
[48:53] Victory hallelujah hallelujah
[48:56] yes
[48:57] sir
[48:59] remember the
[49:01] Pharisees accused him of being
[49:04] a trying to make himself
[49:08] God but the the truth of the matter was
[49:12] he was
[49:13] God making himself
[49:16] man hallelujah hallelujah now we know by
[49:19] God's
[49:20] grace that it in this age is so so can I
[49:25] say it's an evil
[49:27] age men have lost their
[49:31] desire Ser God with all of their
[49:35] heart remember I told you in this day we
[49:39] have so many
[49:41] seducing ening
[49:43] Spirits so many things that keeps us
[49:47] away from the word hallu hallelujah so
[49:51] you know where I'm going if there be
[49:54] anything in your life
[49:56] that will separate you from God whatever
[50:00] that thing is that thing is your
[50:04] Idol Hallelujah
[50:06] [Music]
[50:08] Hallelujah now when you talk to
[50:10] people it's just like you're just
[50:12] throwing water on the duck
[50:16] backu it's a pitiful
[50:18] thing when you see this nation and
[50:21] people the way they do so star and relig
[50:27] but you don't but the Holy Ghost tells
[50:30] us is that right that in this last day
[50:34] they will be he highminded lovers of
[50:41] pleasure more than lovers of God truth
[50:44] Breakers false
[50:46] accusers
[50:47] inent and despises of those that are
[50:51] good they would have a form of
[50:54] God says that a form of
[50:57] godliness he's working with those who
[51:00] claim to be
[51:01] Christians Hallelujah see if there is no
[51:05] power behind your life you're just a
[51:08] form Hallelujah but the Bible
[51:11] says these signs shall follow them that
[51:15] believe in my name they shall cast out
[51:19] devil Hallelujah is that right in my
[51:22] name they raised the dead Hallelujah is
[51:26] that right this is the power of the Holy
[51:29] Ghost remember the Bible tells us in the
[51:33] 17th chapter of
[51:35] John Jesus is pray and he says father I
[51:41] would that they be
[51:42] one even as we are one Hallelujah Lord
[51:47] give them the glory that I had with you
[51:52] before the foundation of the world give
[51:55] them the Glory Hallelujah Hallelujah so
[51:59] God's prayer was that we would enter
[52:02] into a
[52:03] relationship with invisible God that we
[52:06] call Elohim we
[52:09] call Y know what I'm
[52:12] saying but that
[52:14] relationship it must be
[52:16] [Music]
[52:18] realu I don't know about you but when I
[52:21] talk to God God talks back to me
[52:26] Hallelujah I have a God that listens and
[52:29] I have a God that
[52:31] speaks he's the same yesterday today and
[52:35] forever Hallelujah yes he
[52:39] is hallelujah hallelujah they have a
[52:41] form of
[52:43] godliness but we'll deny the power of
[52:47] God is that right most churches will say
[52:50] that ain't
[52:52] necessary all and holl y'all
[52:56] that Ain
[52:57] necessary hallelujah hallelujah you too

[59:14] things but that won't work
[59:16] anymore Hallelujah because truth has
[59:19] come Hallelujah your will against God's
[59:23] will Hallelujah is that right even our
[59:27] Lord and savior didn't even want to go
[59:29] to
[59:30] Calvary his flesh was not
[59:33] willing to but he said Lord I would that
[59:38] you pass this from me let cut pass from
[59:43] me Hallelujah but
[59:46] nevertheless see that's what we're
[59:48] saying
[59:49] nevertheless not my will but be done
[59:54] hallelujah
[59:55] that's the way it has to go we all
[59:58] struggle with self Hallelujah but you've
[1:00:01] got to deny self you got to crucify
[1:00:05] yourself hallelujah it's no fun it's a
[1:00:09] battle Hallelujah but you must win the
[1:00:13] battle Hallelujah glory to
[1:00:16] God who is he that overcome the
[1:00:20] world but he that believeth that Jesus
[1:00:23] is the son
[1:00:25] hallelujah hallelujah like I was
[1:00:28] saying to someone today I
[1:00:32] think we overcome by
[1:00:36] faith not your good
[1:00:38] deeds there so many that can outdo us
[1:00:41] with good
[1:00:42] deeds Good Deeds don't save you it's
[1:00:46] only the blood of Jesus
[1:00:47] Christ y'all better hear me now amen so
[1:00:51] we we understand that when Jesus Christ
[1:00:54] died
[1:00:55] on saved the entire
[1:00:58] world is that right because the Bible
[1:01:00] said God so loved the world he gave his
[1:01:03] only begotten son that whosoever
[1:01:06] believeth in
[1:01:07] him should not perish so he died for the
[1:01:11] whole
[1:01:12] world I was tell him uh uh my
[1:01:16] son men do not go to
[1:01:19] hell because they smoke because they
[1:01:22] drink because they Li
[1:01:25] because they you were born that
[1:01:28] way hallelujah hallelujah people go to
[1:01:32] hell they will not accept the
[1:01:36] pardon they will not accept what Christ
[1:01:38] did for
[1:01:40] them don't you understand when you
[1:01:43] accept Jesus as your savior you are fre
[1:01:48] hallel that's why he said a man
[1:01:51] believeth in
[1:01:53] me
[1:01:56] he
[1:01:56] [Music]
[1:01:58] live hallelujah hallelujah was telling
[1:02:02] my and my grandson whoever it
[1:02:05] was these
[1:02:07] preachers have made it
[1:02:12] complicated one extreme to the
[1:02:15] next one go the way of the
[1:02:19] law on the way of the
[1:02:22] LI Hallelujah but I God brings it in the
[1:02:25] middle yes he does if you love me you
[1:02:28] keep my commandment not because I'm
[1:02:31] making you if you love me you keep my
[1:02:36] Commandments right that's the difference
[1:02:40] we gain the
[1:02:42] victory through his
[1:02:44] victory Everything Jesus Christ

[1:34:10] perfect because my father which is in

[1:34:17] perfect with human
[1:34:20] efforts
[1:34:22] amen if there's such thing as a Holy
[1:34:26] Mountain it's only because the holy God
[1:34:28] is on the
[1:34:31] M there such thing as a holy man or a
[1:34:34] holy
[1:34:35] woman it's only because the holy
[1:34:38] God in the holy
[1:34:41] man and you've heard me say this if
[1:34:45] Jehovah
[1:34:47] God could make the grounds

[1:35:14] efforts Lord let thy will be
[1:35:20] done is in
[1:35:23] heaven don't you want to be a witness
[1:35:25] for
[1:35:27] God let me close on
[1:35:30] this everybody I won't say
[1:35:33] everybody but a lot of people around
[1:35:37] here I've just building big
[1:35:40] churches you know let them do whatever
[1:35:43] they want to
[1:35:45] do but a real minister of
[1:35:48] God is not called to be a be a big
[1:35:53] churches they come they're called to
[1:35:55] build
[1:35:58] individuals of Jesus
[1:36:04] Christ that we might be a
[1:36:07] Powerhouse right Peter talks about the
[1:36:09] div divine nature of
[1:36:13] God to direct
[1:36:16] people into
[1:36:18] Christ so they will become a
[1:36:22] Powerhouse and that they will become the
[1:36:26] statue of
[1:36:27] Christ am a Dwelling Place of the Holy
[1:36:32] Spirit by his word it doesn't matter
[1:36:36] whether you got a lot of
[1:36:37] folks because if you're
[1:36:40] not that
[1:36:44] word we come to church to hear a word
[1:36:48] that's going to change
[1:36:50] us amen something that the word will
[1:36:53] [Music]
[1:36:55] transform right like I said many times
[1:36:59] God placed a heart right in that
[1:37:04] position and he's the only one that can
[1:37:07] wash
[1:37:08] it he's the only one that can clean
[1:37:12] you and so I say this as the scripture
[1:37:16] says pray at all times in the spirit
[1:37:21] with every prayer and
[1:37:24] request and stay alert with all
[1:37:30] perseverance an intercession for All
[1:37:34] Saints Hallelujah is that all right God
[1:37:37] is so good to
[1:37:42] us in closing my last words
[1:37:47] are according to
[1:37:50] Ezekiel he
[1:37:53] says see
[1:37:55] those who sigh and
[1:37:58] cry for the
[1:38:06] Abomination if you're not stirred or
[1:38:10] touched not by what the world is
[1:38:13] doing the world is doing exactly what
[1:38:16] they supposed to
[1:38:17] do when you see the Christian church
[1:38:22] it bring you to a
[1:38:26] Brokenness their
[1:38:29] souls
[1:38:32] crying cry God would bring
[1:38:36] repentance you only get one shot at this
[1:38:41] life one when that breath leaves
[1:38:45] you if you're not right on this
[1:38:48] side be right on the other
[1:38:52] you need the
[1:38:54] one who says he is the
[1:38:57] door he's the only one he has the keys
[1:39:01] of
[1:39:03] death the
[1:39:04] only is that right and you got to go
[1:39:08] into the
[1:39:10] door
