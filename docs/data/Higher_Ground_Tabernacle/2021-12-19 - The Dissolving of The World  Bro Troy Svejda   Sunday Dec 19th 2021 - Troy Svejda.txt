have been good to me [Music] [Music] today [Music] me [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] me oh [Music] [Music] the same god that moses met plenty here that same desire is still here he still has the same desire because he drew them out of the world plus he hit his own individual they went by their place yeah hey man let's just stand in honor how good our interpreters and he keeps on interpreting while i'm still talking so i know our brother possesses an ability that i don't have yeah they [Applause] [Music] is have done the same thing but the day of the lord will come as a thief in the night into which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise and the elements shall also melt with the fervent heat and the earth also in the works that are therein shall be burned up seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved what manner of persons ought you to be able to do it looking forward hastening to the coming of the day of god wherein the heavens are being on fire shall be dissolved and the elements shall be according to his promise are looking for a heavens and a new earth righteousness amen let's just so we pray of denominations be ripped off of our faith whatever it is you in the name of jesus christ we pray amen amen you can be seated as well i want to speak a message this morning now our god has something in his mind when he created this world that spirit brooded over this world according to the book of jesus christ but you know when that spirit brooded over this world because it displeased to move israel your body was laying right there amen amen the the the molecules that make up your flesh right now we're laying right there and the waters had to give way as the dry land began to appear that the warmth of that light struck your mortal bodies [Music] his voice is still going across this that the dark ages had covered over all the world right [Music] luther that came crying out and as they were crying out men began to shake themselves when you hear the tapes of uh brother william branham's we know that this world will be dissolved the ways of this world will be dissolved but before that dissolving something has to take place familiar scripture jesus is talking to the woman at the wells family they've been going back and forth talking about doctrines she in verse 22 jesus comes to give her a revelation he says you worship you know not you don't know what um i don't mean the hour when the true worshipers shall worship the father in spirit and truth and watch this and we got these sounds for the father seek as such to worship [Music] the father is looking for something there's nothing new under the sun yeah now there has been things have transpired upon this world they are contrary to that desire of god but those things shall be dissolved there are things that have taken place upon this world that are contrary to the the order of god all of those things will be dissolved uh in a couple of sermons i think in perfect faith also again in blasphemous he also talks about mental faith [Music] we can't see past the ceiling hey man but we probably as brother brown says break into the supernatural and see where you're at our god is supernatural [Music] so i can agree with that you mentally agree with the words your mind says that's true and as as you as you mentally agree with the word the light begins to shine begins to transform into a spiritual faith it's the word that has come into your mind if it was just stop there rises up on the inside of you you're no longer just agreeing to it with your mind but in your heart you begin to say i know [Music] he [Music] oh you could go through deep depressions [Music] you could be on a ventilator somewhere brain dead as they say they say there's no activity coming across activity amen amen oh what's the difference between come out of her my people come out of those denominations come out of your lukewarm living the bands that are binding you that's cool as we read there in uh uh second peter scene that all these things will be dissolved what type of people are we to be jealous according to the ways of this world with a natural mindset knowing that jesus christ is the same knowing the scriptures like where elijah said lord open that young man's eyes oh we're surrounded by the enemy master what are we to do with this man like oh lord open this young man's eyes [Music] this young man can't serve me tell his eyes he's over there worrying about what the enemy is doing and he can't even see what god is doing that's a beautiful [Music] i just don't know what to do i got these blinders on i just can't see god doing anything just reduce that verb you know when the holy spirit was brewing over this world they sent this penis remove issue like damn all the dirt in the world uh was under the water all the dirt in the world was unknown on filmmaker because here is going to call for the light to come but the light how could it penetrate the waters the light needed to warm the dirt lukewarm when you begin to back slide first the enemy will begin to shut your ears being anymore [Music] [Music] [Music] and now when you begin to agree with the devil during the week and no longer responding to the word on sunday then you don't feel like praying anymore [Music] it says supernatural spiritually minded oh you're dead spiritual that's right amen amen amen then he brings his temptations to you hello and allison you don't feel like going to church anymore you're you're covering yourself up with the waters all over again yep yeah i hope he's found you yeah is your question if he has found you see who's that cool yeah something in his mind he has a vision of you and his mind of you we know that vision exists if god has ever once come knocking on your heart's door and he has a vision of your life now in the old testament they have the natural veil no see they are worshipping the god behind that curtain in the temple they are worshiping what they thought was behind that curse but you know god ripped that rail that veil too what they didn't know is their god was hanging on the cross no god has been revealed ii corinthians says the veil is upon their heart but if they would ever turn and face the lord the invisible god came down to moses amen moses went into egypt it was god and moses being [Music] you begin to discern their problems someone believed just now no i really like that part because he would know the light was in the room he's here he could say sometimes because he knew what it took to get that presence that was there but how do you get that presence to be over someone's head come on oh the people [Music] let me put this away there are real problems spiritual problems natural problems things that were against the vision that god had for them before the foundations [Music] how could he ever get those two together the one that has the problem should we get the problem and the one that can solve the problem then he'd make that statement someone believed just now amen someone will start praying they start believing you're just praying just now now how did brother braham know that beginning to subscribe what they were praying for there was something in the room that was greater than him yeah but there was a veil that was upon the people's hearts some could walk out of the meeting and say well that's all right i say well brother abraham he's a good preacher or yeah i i know those things can happen in the meeting sometimes yeah this is the show they don't realize that there that god was revealing himself to get the people to shake themselves to realize the day they are living and we in our day can say well i know brother branham could do those things the pillar of fire is still here hallelujah the god is still here to change his people to get away from the natural type of thinking to get the supernatural thinking to reject the things of this world because they're going to be dissolved one of these amen get yourself on the path to the supernatural [Music] amen i want to read a quote here from uh the absolute verb absolutely over in uh 1963 midnight and paragraph 60 uh guy of switzerland now he's watching something here you can see amen his mind he he he's in the supernatural yeah he's down here he's in the earth standing on the earth describing something he sees [Music] there came a line of blood only i'm going to preach a sermon called the trail of the serpent the trail of the serpent because he saw a trail of that serpent all through time he was preaching that message all along but not just that message the pastor but he was also preaching on the trail of the holy spirit as brother brown said if you could ever see the the the the trail the two spirits in the church if you can identify the two spirits see the church don't do so he saw eternity break now remember he preached this in the message the absolutely and absolutely he talked about the word being our typos we're not tied to the denominations and from calvary tied with this line it goes on to the thai post jesus christ and when he comes to claim his own economy is oh maybe when they were slaying those lambs at the temple door they didn't realize what they were doing maybe you know [Music] when you're and if that line ever starts to go up no matter how much you're gripped onto the mountain that line is stronger than your grip is they were clipped to a line they went from eden to cows [Music] and the graves begin to open that's right as jesus christ begin to resurrect you know there's a line that also goes these amen and someday he says when he comes to claim his own coin everyone is tied to that ultimate [Music] he's [Music] [Music] hallelujah and when that faith the constitution mental faith began to give way to a perfect faith it says oh it's just getting milky all over people dead began to be raised the blind began to see sins that i don't have a sign to make me anything amen but he's still the same yes to tie you back to that message amen you know there's different thoughts in the message says that's nothing but the truth i believe in him amen amen line went from eden also goes from calvary to the rapture that lion's been made plain in our day since you when he was preaching that sermon called a man running from the presidency he says you know a lot of people would like to talk but the more spiritual thinking you get man you begin to consider your own life [Music] you know that the footsteps of the righteous are order of the lord [Music] and it says in verse 3 of jonah chapter 1 but jonah rose up to flee into tarshish is that statement is made multiple times in it says that he went down to japan this one you know god had already paid the price for him to go to nineveh now he's paying the price off his own pocket to go down to but no matter how great the cost is for the things that we have done well it shows that the price for you to get back to where you ought to be you know that is a great cost also amen you can pay a lot of money to get out of the will of the lord you pay a price in your health yeah pm pay a price in your family pay a price in your own mind pay a price and your finances pay a price with your with depression we have people that do this oh there's a lot of great prices for getting out of the world but you know the price that god paid for you to get into the perfect will of god [Music] that price was paid at calvary and that price was more than a dollar it's a creative proof [Music] as he walked on this earth you're calling that mouse you'll sit down oh let me tell you there are many great temptations how many here knows what it's like to be tempted [Music] have you ever had a great temptation come upon you then it's just like oh you're just like struggling and the battle is just in your mind so strong dude hey you're fighting you're fighting and you're fighting it was this industry you know that's do right is this one time he went into the desert for 40 days and 40 nights just takes up one or two verses there in the bible just upon the deal you don't know what he went through during those four he paid the price for you yeah peter people thank you all the way to cross dying for your sins he paid the price for you to get back to the perfect oh jonah he paid the price to go to tarshish unless he went down into the ship he called me mounted he fell asleep he didn't tell me the boat began to crest [Music] pretty soon the the waves were twice as high as the boat was cool so the boat will be going up the way for like a couple seconds [Music] they took down the sales sheets um then they began that wasn't enough is and that wasn't enough the waves were still coming over and then they finally said everybody on the boat start crying out to the god that you serve come on that wasn't enough and so they began to search the boat and there was a man sleeping in the bottom of the boat a little bit and they began to quit him who are here he says i'm a man that's fleeing from the i'm the prophet of jehovah the god of the heaven that created the heavens and the earth and i'm running from his presence and they are like why would you do such a thing hey so [Music] i'm on this boat and i have done everything i know how to do in my own strength to run from god and i now realize that in my running i have not just affected me but i have now affected the lives of everybody else on the boat come on and begin to get and throw me into the price of jehovah's he paid the price to go out of the will of god he was completely at the will and mercy of god the waves were still there the lightning was still there the rain was still there i appreciate that the clouds were still there the cracking of the thunder was still there but the mercy of god was still there [Music] as he began to sink with his hands tied behind him his feet tied together there was not one thing left that he could do i wasn't expecting god to save me expect it back to drew me so i thought maybe i was done for it but the salvation of god came by my door [Music] because the price that god paid was so great and no matter how far out of the will of god you think you are important that line the calvary is still there amen as he was thrown overboard his mind happened to clip into that lineup and god sent him a fish to take him back back to that sacrifice not knowing that when he had slowed this the last slam that he had slain the last lamb that he had it's seeing that we know these things and our canoe several shoes that all these natural things will be dissolved because it shows nature whatever price you've paid to get out of the will of god you've lost the battle so many times you don't know what to do anymore let's have a pretty quick effect the price that god paid could you happy this is still there to bring you back to the world i want to turn over to or uh let's turn over to isaiah chapter 26 tonight yeah a while back i preached a sermon called understanding in the old testament david spoke a lot about tender mercies and loving kindness a compassionate and when you go to the old testament and you break down those two hebrew words you know david before we before we read isaiah 26 in psalms 103. you know there's a couple really good verses there at the beginning of psalms 103. you know says bless the lord all my soul and all that is within me bless [Music] he says who redeems thy life but there's saline [Music] [Music] fills you with the holy ghost gives you a crown of loving kindness and tender mercy him easily and psalms 107 psalms psalms 107 they have some some sense yeah there's five stories in that psalm yeah and each story is shaky stuart talks about a people that get to their to their wit's end as we say in english where they get to their [Music] they get to the place where they can no [Music] it talks about those that were wandering through the wilderness in the desert they're hungry and thirsty after they left egypt their soul was fainting [Music] and then you come down to uh the last few verses of psalms 107. after telling these five stories people that were at their at their last option in their lives they get the verse 42. it says the righteous shall see it and rejoice no matter where you are in your life's journey that the god that loves you so much museum has paid the price for you to get back to the wilderness isaiah 46 or 26 so i was going to read there isaiah 26 3. we'll close with this that will keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on thee because he trusteth where [Music] no it's just over the just over the doorpost it's a dimension a little faster than this one and if you can just let these walls and the ceiling disappear get yourself out of your natural thinking i realize even if you've paid the price to flee from the presence of the lord the god will still make sure that line is still routed just throw [Music] so i [Music] and you'll realize that they've peace in your mind has been here [Music] oh that that that that line has been here all along keep healing he paid for it salvation he paid for it that's thank you you know that line will still dip down into time right here because he's the same yesterday today he has not changed because only they they have their eyes open to it when you see what he's done for you you can't truly love him until you catch the revelation of what he's done you can mentally agree with the scripture he will be accepted you can say that sounds he said oh throw me out of my price throw me out of the fair that i paid your ticket throw me into the price that you will reveal you in the name of jesus christ good to you do i say that my wife and i will buy my phone i believe we have service this wednesday i think we'll be here we are heading to michigan michigan thursday i'll be back in january sometime until then hallelujah amen aren't you glad
