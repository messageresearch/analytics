presence this morning Amanda to serve him to worship Him [Music] let's let's go straight to the word take out Bibles and turn to Isaiah chapter 41 13. foreign even the Bible says therefore I the Lord thy God will hold thy right hand saying unto thee fear not I will help thee now baby fortified they may not read it again for I the Lord thy God will hold thy right hand saying unto thee fear not I will help them amen that's all I need for my walk that God is telling me not to fear amen he will hold my right hand watch and it will always be there to help me amen so every day even if you can just keep on thinking that God will always be there to help Allah you won't have to worry about anything let's go to uh Daniel chapter three uh we read the verse 24 to 26. amen it's a familiar story Familiar of the three Hebrews that they did with children amen Daniel chapter 3 verse 24 to 26. Daniel chapter 12 verses the Bible says and these three men Shadrach Meshach and Abednego fell down and bound into the midst of fire of the burning fiery furnace then Nebuchadnezzar the King was astonished uh was astonished and Rose up in haste and spake and said unto the counselor did not did not we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire they answered and said unto the king true O King precipitation is four men loose walking in the midst of the fire and they have no hurt and the form of the fourth man is like the Son of God is the Jew then the king came near to the mouth of the burning fire furnace and spake and say Shadrach Meshach and Abednego you Servants of the most high God come forth and come hither than Shadrach Meshach and Abednego came forth of the midst of the fire ensuite foreign and delivered his servant that trusted that trusted in him and have changed the king's word and yielded their bodies that they might not serve nor worship any God except their own God foreign to all our questions may you provide to all our needs this morning we are the people in need second the new I Am Lord we pray father God that you the providers know that you may reach to every one of us could you please and speak personally Lord I pray father God that you help me to be successful Lord so that father God I can say whatever you want me to say Lord we thank you in Jesus Christ amen amen you may be seated this morning we have a little subject that we wanted to share with you that we're entitled The Fourth Man in the in person and so you see that this people there's three kids they had to stand for God Amen they had a challenge a test that was in front of them is the king asked them to uh uh uh about but you know to uh worship that statue amen by the student for God man you didn't want to worship anybody else you don't want to have any other God you know amen because they only had one God that they were serving so the king commanded that the fire will be headed up seven times harder than it was fire was already hot because of the answer that they give to the king the king got frustrated amen and asked that the fire be heated up seven times I just noticed it this morning when I was reading it is the king asked them those to the soldiers to cast them in the fire I noticed that the Bible says that they were all bounds so to cast them in the fire amen you will not see I mean it doesn't make it didn't make sense to me to see that the soldiers because danger was in front of them the fire was so hot so the only scenario that I could come up with hello the soldiers will be behind the three I tried to push them in the fire that's what the Bible says the Bible says that before they even went to that fire Library killed the soldiers that were pushing themselves the fire jumped that he jumped amen and killed the people that were pushing them to them and left those three living to me that God means that God was with them before they even said the presence of God was already there before they got into that fire he says that I will be with you man I will always be with you amen here we say that for I the Lord amen God said that I will hold that right hand I will help you amen so God was with them before they even went to that far hello amen but now they've got to that fire amen I asked myself that question amen did God really had to come down to be in that fire with them only speak the word and that fire will be quiet God that praised his presence could just continue with being with them every time that we are in need every time we're going through a trials every time we're going through tests amen God is always there with them his presence is always amen he came down to that farm amen that they weren't going through that test alone amen that God was with them amen the prophet says here yeah it says here in the spiritual Amnesia so you don't don't let me see spiritual amen paragraph 98. even he says that I was with the Hebrew children in the fiery furnace I don't the fire couldn't burn we couldn't burn them because of the prince of the fourth man I was with Daniel Amen in the Lion's Den the only uh thank you I was identified in there when the angel of the Lord identified in him in there now by paragraph 100. he says that I was surely with him and Calvary I must be identified with him at Calvary must be there to a place that were not also uh was that identified with him and Calvary I was there with him when he was God will always be just remember said his only begotten son you know of why some fish when he came and to be here but I teach him and to go through the life amen to be marketed um okay amen amen just to be identified with you amen you will do that for you amen he did that for you for you amen he's the fourth man amen every time when you go through trials that shakers God is always there with you amen uh uh there is another quote that I wanted to read if I can find it it's in the power of God of 1955. the minute paragraph 14. amen this is just to remind us that God is always there with us I know that God is there with you and your life is not going as you wanted it pass back so much because in time because naturally amen you can see the clouds amen and there is no there is not the presence of the sun amen you can't see the sun anywhere it's all cloudy with the rest of our own shows that every morning the sun rises up amen even though you can't see it beyond the clouds so that is the same thing I'm sure even when you can't see it as well even when you can't feel it you know that somewhere there is a God that is upset there is a God that listens to your prayers there is a God that cares for you yeah he says we can't see it sometimes but we know it's there amen like the little boy was flying the Kite I know it but I forgot the French word amen they said they said where is it is Allah you know he said that they said that I can't see it it is well amen because he was flying that thing so high amen people just saw him you know holding to a string female according to something uh but they didn't know but they thought that he was crazy or something I was like where is it we can't see it is I can't see it myself correct we might not be able to see it is able to go beyond the clouds sometimes the parents will not run right to the child and to pick them up when life gets done foreign [Music] [Music] [Applause] foreign amen God could have given him a son when he asked for it but God let him go through that 25 years to form his faith who foreign he doesn't give us trials don't party test amen that is beyond our strength amen so everything that you have in life we know that God gave it to you who are doing this knowing that you are able social overcoming it doesn't matter how hard it is you might go through some terrible time it's time terrible times in life the other people will look at you and they will wonder how does it go through it other people will look they say that I wouldn't be able to go through it if it happened to me amen God because God knew Joseph they're only you because we will be able to go through it and even though he knows that you will be able to go through it is amen sometimes you make us go through stuff but foreign amen and the Bible says about you though amen though they were going through those Hard Times might be talking to silence saying that you see what God did that to that man look at her people didn't even think that that man could walk again they didn't know that when they were talking amen there were a soldiering right next to them amen who was listening to everything that they were saying amen who was listening to their songs amen who was listening to their testimony amen who was listening that through those amen answer of that man amen he looked at them he said sir is what must I do Mystery group amen that man did not go she told me manufacture manufacturer he met the life that he saw from

despised amen we weren't supposed to be rejected by mankind we were supposed to be the man of suffering we were supposed to be familiar with pain but surely God took up God took up our pain telling us
