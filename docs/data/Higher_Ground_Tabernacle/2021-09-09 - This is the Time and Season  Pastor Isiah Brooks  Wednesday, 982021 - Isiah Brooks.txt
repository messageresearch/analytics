TRANSCRIPT
========================================
and no doubt he talked in his mind i would say that he he saw the church ages and each church age amen received a portion of bread because remember now the bread is jesus christ it is the word of god and so they received a portion of the bread but listen they never wanted the fresh manna whenever the fresh manna came they just stayed with the old and of course we know what happened it staled it rotted there is a bread amen that was beyond the seven church ages it was a it's behind the veil that bread never growed old right it never got stale and you know the thing about it if you ever thought about it it was not a group thing ain't no matter how many levites there were they couldn't all go behind the veil one person at a time and that one person by god's grace amen was what we call the high priest and you and i understand if you understand what jesus did on calvary when the veil was rent it gave access to the holies of holies to whosoever will a new order had come in because it was no longer law but grace so when he was saying give us this day our daily bread listen understand when that bread is given to you when that aged bread that bread that god gives you every age to eat it brings forth life but this is the key to your life and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors and we've been taught by jesus christ that the only way this bread can be live in you is that the following step it must be taken you have to forgive you've got to love hallelujah all of these things must be in play in order for a true child of god to reap reach perfection he said brother explain that to me remember jesus's last test was after he had been beaten after he had been sped on after they crowned his head with thorns after which amen all they made mercury of him if you be the son of god come down from the cross so all of these things were were just no doubt echoing in his mind and i'm coming to that because the greatest battle ever thought is in your mind right this is where the enemy fights you every one of us but one thing jesus never forgot who he was and what his purpose was father forgive them that was the crowning of his ministry it proved he was the lamb of god it proved amen he was everything he said he was and this profound statement astonished those that were around even some of the roman soldiers could not believe what they heard he's asking for forgiveness lord forgive them for they know not what they do one soldier said surely this must be the son of god see because only the sons and daughters of god has the ability to forgive let me move on the thing that i love about it is because we're like trees i'm coming to something here we are like trees david said i'm planted by the rivers of water and i shall not be moved one water that water that life that stream of life is jesus christ himself and i shall not be moved i'm planted he's in me and i am in him why i love isaiah 61 11 is because the scripture says and as the garden causes things that are sown in it to bring forth as the garden you what are you saying brother brooks i'm saying you are planted in the right place and that place that you planted in causes you to grow in other words you can't run from situations you can't hide from situations the situations have been designed for you for example you're not a cactus a cactus could not survive here certain trees and certain plants can only survive in the territories in which they were planted their life depends on the garden in which they were planted and so god is saying to us when you're there i will cause you to spring forth y'all understand me because even look at jesus in the garden of gethsemane garden of gethsemane he was planted to be there and he said father you know he the bible said he vehemently prayed father whether this cup passed from me but nevertheless let thy will be done don't we all wish we can kind of move out of the squeeze thing that's coming but it's coming this is the age we were planted in it is the age that god gave us grace to be listen it ain't you he said i i am the vine you are the branches all we need to do is stay connected to the vine and the light within the vine will bring forth fruits hallelujah you love the lord he said i will bring so so the lord god will cause righteousness and praise to spring forth before the nations you know you say spring forth when you see something spring it's like it comes up like this you know all of a sudden it just comes up like this wasn't seen at one point but all of a sudden it just come up like this and so that's how god is working with us right now you may look like your failure you may feel like a loser you may feel like you don't have faith listen it ain't you it's god in you god at his appointed time at his set time will bring forth his purpose in you and through you that's it hallelujah isaiah 23 9 says and i will bring forth a seed out of jacob and out of judah an inheritor of my mountain and we know who that is that's jesus christ right and my elect shall inherit it and my servants shall dwell there right now this scripture is us i will say it again this scripture is us we're we we he jesus christ our lord is the inheritor right but we are the elected he said my elect shall inherit it and my servants shall dwell there god is so perfect he's so perfect he designed this body like the temple in heaven is that right because you say your heart has four chambers four living creatures right where the blood of god has flown through but you also is encompassed about with 24 elders 24 ribs and those ribs are there to protect your heart protect the queen protect you see when when moses saw everything it was in symbolism it was a symbol or symbols amen but but but god had you and me and mine this is the timing season that god is preparing himself a bride and i want to say this by god's grace that the messenger actually ministered a message shalom i take it that means peace to the bride i'll take it i don't deserve it but i'll take it i haven't earned it but i'll take it why because it's given ah somebody said to me the other day says listen if something is given to you and you don't take it it's nobody's fault but your own you must take it but let me move on because i don't want to just spend all day all night on this i want you to understand it's like healing deliverance you know it's not enough to say i'll take it it must move from the head into the throne room hallelujah it must come before the king and the king was put out his scepter like he did esther and says you can have half of the kingdom if you like so you and i must understand that we're living in the last days and i i was telling the people there in south carolina i'm telling the people here you come to the house of god for change you want the word to change you it's good to shout it's good to dance it's good to speak in tongues right up and down or out all those gifts and things have already been proven the word is already proven that it and the manifestation before we got here has already been proven that the word is true in that area but you and i we're living in a different age we're no longer in laodicea we're in an eternal age we're in a bright age you understand me you can't get here without the blood you know what i'm saying people come to the message you know all of a sudden we want to put them in the head no they're not in there yet you got to come through justification you got to come through sanctification you got to come through the baptism of the holy ghost and that holy ghost in you must mature that's the words according to peter that god has given us and made us partakers of his divine nature hey listen you can't add one cubit to your statue but you know the man who can be touched by the feelings of our infirmities it's prayer it's seeking god at this hour like you've never sought him before that's the pool hallelujah that is the poor and satan is going to do everything he can to keep you away from your prayer lives don't let let god let go let god and let go there is no way that you can pray and god will not answer god always answers sometimes he answers yes and sometimes he's answering no but he always answers but whenever whichever way he goes with that he will give you the strength to go forward with him now we're living in conditions i was thinking and writing this stuff down and i like i said uh um but god's good you know that my ipad locked up i couldn't find my receipt and now god don't bless me with my receipt and everything and this the ipad was uh i think was 2014 was it yeah that received way back then and it was it was paid for in lime ohio uh by bible believers and they had all that on record and so i can get my ipad unlocked so by the grace of god i'm happy about that see you can't tell me god doesn't answer prayer even the least of things so if you know if he answers those small things you'll answer the big ones too right oh it's the truth hallelujah yes sir when you don't have food just tell the lord now god i'm more than the sparrow that's what he said the bible said listen don't take no thought for tomorrow i i close the field i feed the sparrow and you're better you're more than that you got to know that you are by the grace of god i feel i feel like shouting luke 17. let's go there quickly and i'm going to move faster than i'm going now because i want i want to there's a lot of things i really want to get forward in here you see where we are and i'll say it like this everybody in the message is not going to make a rapture can i say it like that again when everybody that believes they're in the message it's not going to make a rapture y'all understand me it is what it is and why why i say that is because a lot of people are not moving forward you got to move forward into the character of christ and guess what it comes by pain we're talking about rapture now we're not talking about salvation there's a number that could not even be numbered that is saved we're talking about a translation something that's going to change you from this this ram and to the next but i want you to show you the conditions here in luke 17 26 and 30 as it was in the days of noah so shall it be in the days of the son of man they did eat they did they drank they married wives they were given in marriage until the day noah entered into the ark and the flood came and destroyed them all sounds like an ordinary lifestyle here not only in america but all over the world right it was conditions conditions and i think we we saw all throughout our lives we saw all of the conditions the one thing we failed to see even when we didn't know this was the very thought of the son of man we missed it we saw the eating we saw the drinking we saw the marrying we saw all of the partying we saw all of that but it was also at a time when the son of man would be revealed y'all understand me so the son of man is a prophet it is the word he is the word because god made him a part of the word now let's move on amen he says likewise also as it was in the days of lot they did eat they drank they bought they saw they planted and they build it huh can you see it all over the world they're building brand new houses everywhere and you wonder where they're getting all the money i don't know but it is prophecy being fulfilled roads and stuff people are starving and they're building they're thinking about building better roads it shows you that the love of god is not in their hearts right that's another one now right on third one the third one is as even shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed what was it he's saying when you see these signs when you see these conditions know that the rapture is at hand know that god is getting ready to do something because remember in the days of noah when this took place and god was left out of everything the flood came in the time of of lot remember in a time when their conditions were like that it meant god rained down fire when god was left out right as it was he says listen but the same day that lot lot is important the same day lot went out of sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all never have we seen in the history of all history where the whole world now there were cities like rome and cities like greece and cities like capernaum and city like pompeii and city cities city cities but no longer cities now the whole world is corrupt the whole world is corrupt y'all understand me so received by god's grace he's saying i can remember he said now the the the gospel will travel from the east to the west as the sun shining from the east to the west so shall the the revealing of christ a revealing of god and so you got to understand it can't go any further corruption can go no further than than the west coast of california hallelujah now but there's another thing he says in that day he which shall be upon the housetop and he's his stuff is in the house let him not come down to take it away and he that in the field let him likewise not return back you know i look up that word safari because of a sofarity serferting because it means excess you know you can have an excess of eating or excess of spending or in excess of basically all the worldly things and that ex being that is an excess it becomes your ruler it controls you right and so he says listen be careful and believe it or not overeating is a sin and we all do it and we don't even think about amen that we're corrupting our bodies when we do that but we are and we do and that's one of the sins that people are missing i was missing it until recently hallelujah but here is the thing he said during these conditions he says remember lot's wife and what happened amen large wife brother branham explains it he said lot's wife was worried about her loved ones now i i didn't know uh uh what all was going to be said today but i just say this it was to her her kin folks and he said as she walked the greatest battle is in your mind don't let nobody hinder you from making a rapture you pray for them you believe for them but it's not enough to look back for them you understand me it was more than just a looking back but my point is we're we're here and we understand that during this time miss lot played a great part why because you see falling away not just from the message everywhere every denomination every organization people are just forgetting about god but a true believer no matter where they are god is their source of strength hallelujah these are the conditions we're working with now you say well what do you mean because i want you to understand that these times were times of exodus nor there was a time of exodus lots time there was a time of exodus right and egypt it was a time of exodus and now can it be a fourth exodus can it be that god is doing something where he's taking the cream of the cream of the cream of the crop those who feel the pool i hope you're feeling it i feel the pool there's something going on on the inside of me hallelujah i cannot explain it but there is an urgency there is a uh uh something that's moving in me that that's desiring to be more like him that's it see this book was sealed as i said last week it was sealed if you could read it but to understand it was a different thing because the letter killeth but the spirit gives life now we understand that god's church was built upon revelation yes the word says it but what does it really mean and it's not given to any private interpretation you can't put your own thoughts to it that's what's got us in such a confused state now churches are just absolutely confused can't even see the oneness of god but listen because only the prophet of god in this day could bring it out in such a way that we were not oneness and we were not threeness and we were not twoness god has never been won like your finger jesus christ is the son of god yet he is god and people can't seem to understand it he's not a trinity and we understand where the trinity comes from now i'm just going with this so that you can understand how blessed you and i are to understand what god is doing in our day these people did the best they could y'all get y'all understand me and god knows them that are his none of us could ever say that god is not in the denominations because as long as his people are there he's there and only god knows who they are that's why revelation they come out of her my people that that means coming out of a system because even in this message there is a system but you're not here to marry a system or to worship a system you're here to marry christ y'all understand me that's what we come to marry now let me move on by god's grace because i'm trying to get to something listen the bible was sealed but now it is an open book that means this bible from genesis in revelation must declare jesus christ and jesus christ alone right that's what the bible says the bible says he is the alpha and the omega the beginning and the end neither is there salvation in any other there's no other name among heaven whereby we must be saved other than the name of jesus christ all the way through if you can't see jesus christ you're missing it because even in the old testament amen he's shallowing and typing out salvation right when it comes to ruth when it comes to esther amen there were shadows and type and prophecies of what was to take place in the end time hallelujah i'm coming to this now now the mystery of the seventh seal has been revealed and the seven thunders amen has uttered their voices right and the bible said there was a silence that silence began to unfold to the bride of jesus christ because remember you can't preach what was in the seventh if and they think it's going to hold in the eighth that's what the seventh or the sixth age did with fifth age but fourth that's what they all did they tried to hold on to so every age produced a different message but more of it not just a piece of the pie more of the pie that's what we fail to see god never stands still he always unfolding he's always unfolding he's always unfolding and the mystery of the whole bible is you the whole purpose of redemption is to get back to us what we lost when adam and eve sinned as simple as that but god through ages took his own time to deliver and to bring people out and to show what he will do and what he did what was this about a love affair this is a love affair a love of faith it was all because he loved us saint john 3 16 right for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him shall not perish but have everlasting life it's all about jesus it's all about his pride the beginning amen when you saw adam and eve they were one right but adam was stupid he said what do you mean adam when he saw eve he said you're born in my bone and flesh of my flesh and for this cause a man shall leave mother and father and cleave to his wife where mother and father did come into play until after the sin after the fall there was supposed to be no mothers and fathers that's why they asked uh jesus said your mother and your father or your mothers and your brothers here he said who is my mother and my brother but those that do my father's will right he was saying listen we all brothers we all sisters it was to never be f is that right it was to never be husband and wife that that's not the beginning that's not the ending but these things did come to come together would have come together in god's plan to reproduce but it would not have been by sex am i making sense so that the the scriptures can't be broken even when else said i love this i love the scene i just if i ever was to be in a play i would love to be in this but i know i couldn't be esther but when i look and i see how god in in the in the book of esther the silence right you know it was silence it was a busy time the king was on the throne right esther came at a time when she wasn't summonsed and no doubt when those doors swung up and everybody looked they knew the law they knew the law that if the king did not put forth the scepter esther would die they knew the law but when esther walked in i guarantee you there was a complete silence and everybody was staring at esther or the king and esther was staring at the king her focus was in in the king's eye she didn't look down perhaps she was there for a while but no doubt when she got up there in the presence of that king something she had to do you understand me you said what do you mean brother brooks how many of y'all know this to be the truth when you fall in love you don't need a lot of words you can just look at a person and they can look at you and the joy bells are ringing yeah is the truth y'all act like y'all don't forgot what that is but it's true that's how you know when it's the right one you and no words are being said you understand me but you understand him and he understands you and you connected in silence y'all understand me that's how it was with esther and the king they connected in silence they knew they couldn't explain it they knew and the king knew he couldn't live without her oh my god the king knew he couldn't live without her and she knew she didn't want to live without him and he reached out that scepter like john did with the book take this book and eat it you understand me it was the same symbolism of john receiving the book out of the handwritten of him who sat on the throne same thing because the king says i give you half the kingdom whatever you want after don't you understand who i feel like crying don't you understand the hour we're living in we're living in the hour we're living in the hour where god is saying you can have half of the kingdom that means your mother your father your sister your brother whoever it is i'll give it to you all you got to do is ask for it believe it that's the hour we're under the thunders we're under that voice that that nobody else can hear but the pride of jesus that's truth that's true and when she left the king she said ki you know what she said to the king even though she had all those things on her list her bucket list if i could say it like that she said king all i want to do and all i want to do is have a revival hey that's all i want to do give me a banquet and a banquet represents revival a bank it represents celebration i banquet y'all hear what i'm saying guess what when she gave she they had that banquet you think the devil was talking then no haman was quiet as a mouse you want to shut the devil up you start giving god the praise you start enjoying yourself under this message like you ought to and watch the devil shut up he knows he's in trouble he he has forgotten he knows he's in trouble and you and i need to put all that we can put on him hallelujahs and thank you jesus and glory to god and most of all living it put the devil to the shame is that right it's it's true let me go on remember the self the half hour of silence is that right well what happened when ruth went to see boaz she quietly no noise but there was a union spiritually taking place you understand me she had one thought in mind because her mother-in-law had already told her find out where boaz lay and when you get there lay beside him and when she knelt down she laid beside him and no doubt at his feet that's how you meet jesus you meet him at his feet cover me with your garment right do you understand the kind of trouble they would have gotten in if they had been caught or she had been caught there laying at the feet of boaz it was a mystery nobody knew what took place but boaz and ruth oh somebody help me here and when that took place he said listen you're more righteous than i thought you're holy you could have chosen some of these new religions but you chose the old way oh i'm coming hallelujah it was a silence she took it back with her and guess what they got married love at first sight is that right oh let me move on by god of grace by god's grace think about it when those when those are revelation 10 4 let me move on and when the seven thunders had uttered their voices it was about to john was i was about to write and i heard the voice from heaven saying unto me seal up those things did you know that word seal is with the capital s which signifies a person and not a thing it was christ who said seal of the book because only jesus christ could break the seal is that right oh come on folks you think about it when the real when jesus christ when the roman stone though mary and martha rode the dead it was sealed i'm getting two things mixed up no mary martha rose wrote away the stone for for lazarus but when those roman soldiers sealed nothing could break it nothing but in the quiet of the night in the quiet of the night the seal breaker showed up hallelujah and all of a sudden the storm rolled back the flash of lightning came down and there was two angels setting in there who do you think those angels were the bible doesn't say it but i guarantee you it was moses and elijah say prove it they were the ones who were mount transfiguration hallelujah they were the ones amen there at the tomb hallelujah they were the ones a man standing by him saying as he go up you'll see him come down hallelujah he said brother which you shouldn't say that well i'll put it this way when angels are ordained to do certain things they can't switch position that's what's what lucifer wanted to do god had already ordained him to be a covering angel and he wanted to be more than that you understand me whatever those angels were ordained to do from the beginning they cannot change it hallelujah you say oh brother bruce how can you say that that's why in the time of the tribulation when those jews amen are being persecuted and those two prophets comes up who is it moses and elijah not gabriel and michael moses and elijah you say brother brooks you yes that's revelation amen now my point is because moses and elijah was identified with the resurrection right right it was in elijah's ministry you saw resurrection it was moses ministry you saw resurrection because moses was resurrected so they were always identified with the resurrection and those hundred and forty-four thousand that die will be resurrected and even those prophets in the street shall be raised up again so anyway let me move on so you find out by god's way god breaks that seal right and now he's coming to a place and you got to understand the resurrection is this now the coming of the lord is this can i say this just before the exodus what showed up the pill of fire and god said i have come down so that was the coming it was a pill of fire that led them through the wilderness right but the pillar fire shows up again in the days of saul as he going down to persecute the christians the pillar fire comes down and he falls off the horse and he says who art thou lord he said i am jesus and jesus said it is hard for thee to kick against the prick see that was the coming of the lord right so you say oh brother you know if the coming of the lord is so well what about what about see when people see and i'm not going to go over so far with this but i want you to see something when jesus resurrected from the dead the bible said the graves were opened right and the angels are the servants of the lord walked around the city brother branham even dramatizes it you know out of songs oh oh lift up your head uh all your gates will be lifted up and let the king of glory come in now he wasn't by himself but all of the old testament saying was with him huh so when you talk about a cloud this is why the prophet god says listen it was not water vapors and the cloud in the in the wilderness was not water vapors the angel of the lord in camps oh somebody help me here one angel but the host of angel encamps about them that fear y'all understand me so when those that resurrection took place all those servants all those who were dressed now in white robes went up and it's called a cloud he descended ascended in a cloud it's the truth ask god about it he'll tell you so you say what do you mean he said in like manna i will come again not the same he said in like man this is why we do the cloud it was above water vapors it wasn't just water vapors because if you see the original you see faces but what was it oh my what was it when that seven seal broke bring it back to the old testament when the old testament saints raised from the dead paradise was done away with and they moved up higher but they're in a place right now where they desire to come back to the earth y'all understand me even though they're in their theophanies they're not satisfied there's a glorified body that they want to be in so they can eat and drink again and fellowship in such a way we're not meant for heaven we're meant for the earth we're coming back here to live but when god listen paul says i'm jumping he said for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with the shout and with the voice of an archangel with the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise first and what we fail to see is that that is already in the motion because when jesus came when he came in 1963 what did he do it freed your theophany because your theopoly was in the sixth dimension when brother branham saw them ah but those thunders amen when god opened the book that's why he said if you believe this message you have heard from your theophany hallelujah it ain't me that's preaching it's my theophany that's standing though i don't see him he's there you say it can't be that simple yes it is the bible said enoch walked with god he was translated and he was found not hallelujah there was no no no no no uh uh going away party for him nobody knew when he was going to leave they didn't even know that he was going to leave because the mystery was between him and god and don't you understand amen when you when you walk with god in this message you are literally climbing jacob's ladder you're going higher from faith virtue knowledge tempers patience right godliness brotherly kindness and then charity and these steps these are victories these are births that causes a lot of pain because your flesh don't want to die but you know the word of god and you press on you press on and you say god bring me through this birth right especially when you don't have patience patience is the virtue but i'm gonna tell you something you gotta fight to get it hallelujah it just doesn't drop in your lap it's a birth it's a continuation of god in you that's why paul says grow up in to him unless there's a death there cannot be birth birth only comes by substance of death lest a corn or wheat fall in the ground and dies it abides alone now let me go back to the scripture that i read there in isaiah at the beginning he causes it god causes it like the sun causes everything to die and rot god causes you to die and rot you can't do it on your own don't even think about it they couldn't do the law don't even think about it you can't do the law don't even think about it all we can do says god have mercy on us let your grace be with us if you've got strength it comes from god almighty hallelujah it's okay i hope so because when this scripture i think and i uh this scripture when these scriptures and i had this down when this scripture comes uh just like our brother our brother uh keith show uh mentioned to me the day i think was today uh but anyway i don't even have that on here in my notes but but for sure i i had seen something that i had never seen before because when the mighty angel revelation 10 came down and he put one foot on the land and one foot on the sea he was literally declaring victory for all of his people you understand me when those seals were open remember john and this is what god gave me when john opened this when john saw that seal open he was about to write it so that means he could understand what was being said but he couldn't write it because if he had written it the secret would have been given away so he couldn't do it but it was the coming of the lord now you say oh brother books will you see him in the air yes the bible said you will you can't take that away but you must change like paul said from glory to glory god is now oh come on people that's the word the bride has made herself ready how how by saying lord not my will but thine be done because remember i believe that when esther got in the front she had to have that veil because that was an old way of doing things and she put that veil over to let him know you're my headship jesus christ is your headship it's not your preacher it's not your pastor it's not even you the headship is jesus christ and as long as you recognize the word to know that god is the same yesterday today and forever you think about it think about it when moses those disciples i mean all of the israel they didn't want to give up moses and elijah when jesus came they didn't they had a prophet they had a word for them probably they had the old testament and whatever more books they had an attitude and when jesus came with his authority who was the word they says no we ain't changing we've got moses as our prophet see and that's what it is even in the message jesus christ is here but they said we ain't changing we've got william branham as our prophet it's the truth but william branham was an elijah a man like john who pointed you to jesus christ hallelujah there's only one who can save you there's only one who died for you hallelujah there's only one book and that's 11 book of life and that book was in the hands of jesus christ the lamb it wasn't even in john's hand until god gave it to him y'all understand what i'm saying so to see amen that this let me say it like this this is what was quickening me today when the prophet god preached a message the greatest battle ever fought us in your mind and you know what for some reason i was guilty i was guilty believing i've got to win every battle that's been fought in my mind and i forgot about calvary i forgot that he fought for me he fought your battles he won that battle for you that mind battle that you're now going through where the devil said you can't overcome and you can't get victory there he is a liar he is a deceiver right because jesus christ won that battle for you but but in order to for that to be you you have to receive it lord i receive your victory god gave that to me and i thought oh my god i was missing this for i mean a big big big big margin big margin but i look and says oh my god you know even when he put the crown they put that the thorns on that was they were crowning him with the curse is that the truth cursed is the man who hangeth upon the tree and we know thorns was symbolic of a curse the curse cursed be the ground it should bring forth thorns and thistles what was he doing bearing your curse so you can be free hallelujah and the devil said you cursed you can never be cursed he bore the curse for you amen hallelujah lord of god thank you jesus hallelujah so you got to die it must rot and get into corruption and then from that corruption for com forth uh that comes forth life no other way it will work and i thought lord this is why the prophet god says lay in the presence of the son stay in the word stay in these messages listen to them they will change you you can't change yourself it there's a life a voice in a voice that comes to you amen that will change you that will convict you that will bring to you all that you need all you've got to do is be faithful and stay underneath that shekinah glory that god has that's the secret that's one of the great secrets that people don't understand that's what makes us different from everybody else because we have a word that will ripen our character right and understand this in closing i had a lot more to say but you know i gotta preach sunday so we'll have part one two and part three because there's so much to be said and i wanna really work with that uh the coming of the lord and and what you see uh uh uh how can i say it the word of god talks about the sins and paul said i saw him you know because remember paul said i i went and i was in a dimension whether it be the third heaven or not i he said that's what it was he said i was either anybody out of the body but i was there and i heard things that wasn't even lawful for man to utter right you know and so when you see what god did and how mighty he is let's see it like that john said john saw a mighty angel you know and paul said the lord himself right the angel shall descend and the same angel that john saw was the same lord that that paul saw so paul once saw him go up and the other one come down so you got to understand when this thing when this this word that's why this is what shook brother branham because he had in his mind like all of us had in our mind the way the coming of the lord would be he said could it be this thing is beyond me and it was after the seals god began to tell him just like it came just like it was with the with the seven thunders and and the seven trumpets he didn't even know he had preached the trumpets already and the law says already done you've already preached it hallelujah and so was it with the coming of the lord and people say well i don't understand it well the mighty angel came down where is he down he's supposed to be in you it's the same jesus god in morphing right and so you say well what why would you say listen that's what he was trying to tell us it's not enough to be just baptized with the holy ghost you must not only be born again but you've got to continue on until god brings you to perfection and you say what do you mean by that because they're coming another outpouring and none of us can make this rapture the way we are down hello but this outpouring comes at the time of the squeeze that's when it comes that's when we know we're right at the rapture because the prophet god alluded to it at that time of the squeeze at the time of the shutting of the door that's when the bride will be taken up he said the pressure the squeeze will bring them together push them together but it will push us up i am excited because i feel the pool i see the change you say well brother books nobody else don't see it nobody else don't have to see it but i see it by the time it's done everybody will see it it's little by little right women say i'm pregnant and you're looking because you can't see nothing and you say how many months and if she said four or five you're like something wrong with that especially if you can't see it because around that time you see the lump oh you should right so that which was invisible began to manifest itself as it grows you love the lord let's stand god is good to us and you and i know that we're about to take a rapture the thing about it is nobody's going to miss you it it's so it's so secret it's so small in number you see what i'm saying people don't love god enough to even come to church on wednesdays but i guarantee you there are people who could have been here tonight they're out there at the lunch place the dinner place whatever place you know what i mean but the bible said it they don't even know they're partaking of eating drinking and being married they don't know that you you're loving the things of the world more than you loving god you can't do that well you can if you choose to but you're missing the whole thing in that little story brother venom talks about the ranch's son and this lady who was chosen by god how that she was like a cousin and they treated her like dirt they didn't even treat her like a church they treated her bad but they didn't know she was the one the rancher's son chose all of the other ones had their little you know dresses and all of that revival stuff going on and i'm sure they could dance and shout and do all of this and all along she was in the back [Music] there you go while everybody else was making knowledge and look at it in every church the noise is just in a row everybody's right and yet there's a quiet there's a silence god is working in a people they don't even know them they don't see them they don't even consider them as being a church but they are and guess what it wasn't in the front yard it was on the back of the book it was in the backyard here she was throwing out fish water and all along he's observing her character and that's what god is doing the holy spirit that's what the prophet said the holy spirit is observing our character and he says reporting back to the things that we're doing but the one thing that i liked about it is that when the ranch's son came up he says oh i don't heard all about it say you didn't know that but when i was gone [Music] i had my worker watching every move you made he reported back to me you've been good [Music] that's all i want i want a good report that's all i want i don't care about riches i don't care about fame i don't care about money you know the devil says oh you got an issue with money no i got a issue with tithing when people don't pay their tithing because i know that when you don't you're cursed you understand me it troubles me more than that you know it's just more than that anyway i don't want to go into that but my point is we're looking at this thing to understand people it's okay to suffer this is a suffering way take up your cross and follow me it's all right to fall as long as you get up the bible said a just man falls seven times in a day y'all understand me and i want you to understand to be a christian doesn't mean that you got to go to higher ground tabernacle that's not it you got to know god for yourself right you got to know him for yourself you got to have him on the inside people say well i've never done this i've never done that let me tell you what the most solid christians i've ever seen usually are those that hardly ever shout hardly ever dance right they don't have all these extra gifts but they have one gift for certain they love the word they love the word they give their lives to the word and i'd rather have that than the shout the dance i'd rather have that than to be a preacher or a singer because you can be a preacher you can be a singer and if you don't have that love of the word in you you lost [Music] all gifts you can have all of that thank god for a prophet that could tell us like all these things have been done raising of the dead eyes of the blind open the word is true but right now god focus is a bride god's focus is taking people like you his whole purpose of calvary was to bring forth of his kind [Music] that's it a word bribe a people that love the word and live it and the only way you can live it is that the life of the vine be it you you love the lord oh my people we'll pick up on sunday we will be having communion on sunday as well for those who would like to take communion i like to say to those who do come if you're sick any kind of evil or sniffles stay at home we're here to share the lord's table you know what i'm saying my point is you know i'm not i'm not afraid but you know what i'll put it this way we're not here to to to how many of y'all like catching the flute i don't i i don't want it and i know how it is when people um i couldn't stand it me and my wife we went through a lot of changes when when people knew they were sick and then come your house to hold your baby [Music] no that's wrong we had a sister even brought her kids with the chicken pox said well they might as well get it now they're gonna get it later how selfish and unconcerned you know what i'm saying but people do stuff like that because you can deal with something pretty good that doesn't mean everybody else can physically deal with it and i know all these things are in the hands of god we don't know walking down to speak going to restaurants we don't know who's infected and who's not infected and i want to be assured that the blood of jesus keeps us safe [Music] i know he is i i know god has kept me safe but i don't want nobody to you know know you're not feeling well because everybody's faith is not on the same level that's what i'm talking about i'm not saying don't come if you want to come stay in the back just i'm just saying don't come you know for those but if you want to come and you know you you physically well and you you you don't have the covet and all of those kind of things because i'm saying communion folks people say well that is the church is the hospital well then if you got that kind of faith be well by the time you get here because you don't need to come to church to be well right yes [Music] you know what the situations all of the situations they've had to go through it little jew to lord god as young kid father has had to go through so many traumatic experiences but you're the prince of peace and i believe that father you've given us authority over these enemies satan i speak as a servant of the lord as a blood washed christian the holy ghost
