is the only way we're going to make it by him sending his power you appreciate the Lord Jesus we thank God for His grace and His mercy we're gonna go just right into the Word of God as we stand we thank you and thank him for his presence trust the Lord would minister this thought to you Colossians the second chapter and then we'll go to Ephesians 1 Colossians 2 we read that the second and third verses that their hearts might be comforted being knit together in love and unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding - acknowledgement of the mystery of God and of the Father and of Christ in whom are here all treasures of wisdom and knowledge and this I say lest any man should beguile you with enticing words theevans one Ephesians 1 9 and 10 let's go to the six first yeah I could read the whole thing really but let's start there the six fifth first I'm sorry having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of His grace where and he have made us accepted in the beloved in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sin according to the riches of His grace wherein he have abound toward us in all wisdom and prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself you love the Lord let us pray father we thank you for your grace we surely thank you for your mercy and God you're being good to us better to us than we've been to ourselves we pray Lord God this evening Lord that you have a preeminence in the service Lord give us grace to move completely out of your way and we'll be careful to give you the praise glory and honor in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated I was thinking by God's grace how blessed we are and you hear me say that and I say it often because it is true we are blessed that God will would give us secrets he would tell us things that he wouldn't tell no other I'm not sure whether you realized tonight that we who are called bride know more about God than even Israel knew because Israel worshiped under shadows and types you and I know more than Abel did April worship under a type and even though God gave the secret of what he desired from Abel I doubt if it was truly revealed to Abel what the lamb represented all we know is that God to Eva are able to give it and that revelation was sacrifice a lamb God requires blood even when you think about Cain how that God never gave him the revelation of the type God did tell him what he needed to do he just gave him a head knowledge and because of it not being in his heart to accept it he wouldn't humble himself to even the truth when he knew that God could not lie God gave Cain an opportunity to move forward but Cain refused it and by this I by doing so he marked himself we understand the Bible said without the shedding of blood there is no remission of sin don't you know there are many Christians today who don't even understand that's that Scripture and are many people Amen who depend upon their churches or the affiliation familywize you know my father founded this church or my mother was part of this church since it's been founded but those things are not acceptable with God God has a way of doing things he can be so deep yet so simple I marvel ah how God took Israel or Abraham and began a nation it took April from a place that you and I would not have expected God to choose from Abraham was chosen by God and he lived in child ear which was another place we called Babylon where they were great idol worshipers in and things and no doubt Abraham had seen many people worship things that would not even respond when they were called upon but there was something on the inside of Abraham that made him know that the voice that was speaking to him was God and you and I must understand that that's how it always worked we ourselves a man don't even know why how come we when God called us we dropped everything and followed him we don't even know why Amen that after God called us we never could get away from him something God did on the inside of us because listen he never lost one when you and I understand that hear God the Almighty God you and I don't understand what heaven is like we can't imagine what it's like the splendor the glory that awaits us and yet when God came down to earth to hide himself he hid himself behind badger skin and a badger is a bad animal badger and we realized by God's grace that's how God hides himself for an example Amen God doesn't take someone that's already perfect he takes the imperfect and make them perfect that's the secrets of God he can take that which we may consider nothing and make something out of it when we think about God amen and himself unveiling himself to us I do know exactly how much the first Adam knew but no doubt his knowledge was limited you say well why do you say that because Jesus being God and man his knowledge was limited he never understood and never knew amen the coming of the Christ or the resurrection i'ma put this way of the rapture until after his death burial and resurrection we never he walked as a man but yet only inside he was God it was such a mystery that God for thousands of years hid himself behind badger skin nobody knew what was back to accept the prophets they knew that that was the Elohim they knew that was the Almighty God now you say what do you mean because everybody couldn't go behind that great veil only the high priest and everybody was God from afar can you imagine in their minds what they went through how they thought God might Abid even though the word was given to them they still was veiled they still couldn't see God like we see him amen so you and I must understand this this the knowledge in which we have been given is the knowledge that God here from Israel behind the badger skin there was a powerful revelation behind the badger skin and God kept it a secret and in this secret no man a man could control how this art Travel remember it meant David wanted to put it on a cart and he tried to bring a new way and in that new way a man was killed because Amen God wanted to do something in the place that he built this something fall now we know brother branham said it like this he said scientists have been trying to dispute whether there was that whether man thinketh in his heart now scientists have found out that there's a small compartment in the heart where there are no blood vessels and in that little chamber is the throne of God behind all of this dust behind all of this blood vessels behind all of this chemistry behind all of this dirt God hid himself or the place of himself in the heart of a man this man had been liking as a dog he had been liking as a swine he has been liking his law the loss of all creatures since the fall but yet God never changed his mind about where he wanted to abide who and we realize amen that this secret is not given to everybody some people go to church just to feel God some people go they want to know that God is real just by the way they shout by the way they dance or by the way they speak in tongues but we know something that a lot of people don't know you and I understand the very mystery and you say mystery it was a mystery when Nicodemus was told by Jesus you must be born again and Nicodemus in his intellect says well uh should a man die or should a man be placed back into his mother's womb and be born again and he says no no no mama not Nicodemus I'm talking about something that's more higher something higher than the natural man something greater than the natural birth that which is flesh is flesh and that which is Spirit is spirit mom or not you must be born again now even Jesus had a doctrine that they could not understand because Jesus was telling them saying things that they didn't understand what do you mean he said it's good that I come if I had not come to you you would have had a cloak but now that I've come to you this righteousness that you think you have is righteousness like a a whitish supper cup your dad on the outside and you're dead on the inside you look good on the outside but you're dead on the inside hallelujah and Jesus going to say except you believe that I am he you should likewise die in your sins you know what only a few out of those people heard what he was saying a lot of people thought he was was a devil you mean to tell me I've had all of this education and you're trying to tell me I'm lost because I don't believe in you think about it a man who had a bad reputation a man who had a reputation that he was born out of fornication and to the Jews that was a very wicked thing hallelujah it meant a man a man who they accused of being a wine-bibber right and so how do you come amen drinking and things like that when John the Baptist didn't even do that see he didn't have a good reputation he came from Nazareth but oh oh did God not hide himself he had a bad reputation when he wasn't bad hallelujah even the rich young ruler knew that though he may have heard so many things about him he approached him good master out of all the things you see everybody can't see that gee good hallelujah because Jesus even said to the rich young ruler why call it army good only God is good so he was trying to really give him a revelation if you're gonna call me good you calling me God hallelujah then what must I do to inherit eternal life and that's where we make mistakes we approach God and you've heard me say this before Lord what must I do to inherit eternal life we always thought there was something we could do to eat hallelujah to inherit eternal life but won't you to understand your eternal life amen is a gift that God gave you and I before the foundation of the world it is not him that will it no he that run it but God who shows mercy see but we have a duty there's something that God has for us to do and you must know what it is the revelation must be given to you as a individual it's not given as a church or a group but you must know what you come to do every time God had a purpose he defended that purpose he made sure that purpose was met huh because the word of God cannot go out void God has a purpose in doing everything everything God so believe in the death burial resurrection everything has that order is that right and you and I must understand in order to go to heaven we must have that order hallelujah there must be a death before there can be a resurrection now I want you to run that the mystery that Paul had was amazing because all alone the Jews thought there was a Bride of Christ or the bride of God and remember God wrote them a bill of divorcement but there is another people that they were not even considering to be a part of the inheritance of God because they thought they were it they looked down on the Gentiles they looked down on the Samaritans huh because they thought they were it they didn't know something else was coming that was greater they didn't understand the scripture when I was here talking about God was gonna have a bride that God would have a bride call Hepzibah they rabbit but they didn't understand it they couldn't understand how the Gentiles those dirty dogs don't swine eating people hey shrimp eating hallelujah snake eating whatever they were very unclean how can God have anything to do with that right because remember it when guardians I had to speak to Peter when God told Peter to go to Camille's house he dropped down that that uh a sheet of all unclean things and Peter said to God oh no listen I've never put anything unclean in my mouth what he said I've been a faithful Jew I've been faithful to the law he himself did not know the change of the dispensation hallelujah but God review it filled that they meant to Paul and Paul say whatever you eat you give Thanksgiving God does sanctify day so you understand God doesn't she'll show all of his secrets to everybody but to those who are chosen and elected the scripture says is given for you to know the mysteries of the kingdom it was it was kid who thought he could work his way into the kingdom but it was Abel who caught the revelation I am sceptic I am accepted in the lamb I know that lamb has taken my place I'm a sinner but this lamb takes my Kennedy he takes my guilt hallelujah and I am set free see that's a mystery that a lot of people don't understand that's why they don't have joy because they don't understand it is Christ hallelujah don't get me wrong when you're born again a major thing happens to you and when I say really born again I mean really born again but listen we talked about how God he hides himself in Paul was trying to tell us amen in Colossians how that these treasures of wisdom and knowledge is isn't hidden is hidden amen but then the Word of God tells us that is the Holy Ghost that leads and guides us into all truth you know what I mean she just like brother Branham didn't know who he was in the beginning you don't know who you are that's why the Prophet John said when the bride began to recognize who she is hallelujah and we're all that way amen in this journey hallelujah Oh God promised Abraham faced Abraham didn't realize what he had no he didn't look at all the mistakes he made before Abraham came to yield himself to God's purpose y'all heard that you've got to yield yourself to God's purpose hallelujah as long as you hold fast to yourself and don't yield you go get in trouble after trouble after laughter trouble until you finally realize you must die in rock the Bible says let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth but that which is good to the use of edifying that it may Minister grace unto the heroes hallelujah and grieve not the Holy Ghost whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption what every mistake you make God is your witness the Holy Ghost is your witness hallelujah is that right he couldn't be grieving wasn't there to witness it so you what are you saying every time you make a mistake if you don't feel a check if you're not grieved you're not one with him because when he grieves you grieve and it is grieving you repent and that repentance puts you back on track hallelujah let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and evil speaking be put away from you with all malice it is the thing that kills the church y'all here but I'm saying that if these these are not attributes of life everything that I just spoken amen is a attribute of death and be kind one to another tender-hearted forgiving one another even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you you understand me forgiveness is not an option hallelujah to the true believer forgiveness oh let me read that again right and even God for listen says and be kind one to another tender-hearted forgiving one another even as God for Christ's sake not even your sake it's for Christ's sake that God forgives you for Christ's sake oh I'm well you're not worthy outside of Christ none of us deserve forgiveness except through and by Christ hallelujah forgiving one another even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you hallelujah and we remember the story in the Word of God the man who owned so much oh so much a man was asked for forgiveness a man and he was forgiven and then he had a servant a man who needed forgiving and instead of forgiving the servant he beat the servant and those who witnesses beating a man went back to the master and said listen this is what your servant did even though you forgave him he wouldn't forgive the other guy hallelujah and you know what the master did he took away all his forgiveness everything that he forgave the servants all amen he took it all away and the man who was beaten was in a Cabella condition tell you me that's how bad it is all these good things that God has done for us if you don't forgive at the end of the day everything that God promised you is stripped taken away from you somebody help me now Jesus spoke that you could believe it or not now you and I must understand amen listen as Hebrews 10:15 says we're of the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us for after that ye have said have had said before this is the Covenant that I will make with them after those days saith the Lord I will put my laws into their hearts and into their minds will I write them and their sins and iniquities will I remember no more now where remission of sin is there is no more offering for sin so you see why the devil don't want you to get into that place where you are in a place where there are no sins imputed to you whoo you don't have to believe it but the word says so blessed is the man whom God will not impute sin and the Word of God said this see remain it in you you cannot say these are secret things these are things that you and I must understand when we are sealed with the Holy Ghost that God comes along and says listen he's so justified I can't even see the sins that don't mean that you and I are gonna go around and do simple things I said well you know what that doesn't bother me it just shows that you're not born again there's no way a true Christian can do wrong and not be convicted hmm listen secret things secret things I you know I am I marvel at God that God Amen everybody thought that when Jesus died on the cross he was finished brother hallelujah perhaps the devil thought it in his mind oh how I got rid of him oh but on the day of Pentecost hallelujah yeah you know what it had been a burden for those priests they carry all those strolls around all those rolls around and then you know oh this one is over here this one is over there let me get this one hallelujah and then God Amen put it in one book everything and told John to eat it hallelujah and when John ate the book he became the book hallelujah and look at it John when he ate the book he didn't say Oh Lord I'm just so full the Bible said even getting the scream he began to holler he became the yeah hallelujah when he saw that his name in the muck Hey Oh everywhere heard John saying what's wrong with this quiet bride she's supposed to be a noisemaker hallelujah oh people of God you think God don't forgot about you no no no no no no you don't even know what's only inside of you the prophet of God said but when that pressure comes well when that pressure come you're gonna really see what you made out of hallelujah so I trust by the grace of God amen that was only inside is Christ God you got God will force a revival on you you see and everything mounting up against you y'all know how difficult it is to pray you know how difficult it is to fast and keep it going and keep it going there's always busy stopped busy stuff amen you know some time yeah you know what I'm saying it's a real battle and then the kitchen keep on track with everything but let me tell you something people of God whatever you do you better fight the keep on track don't let the fire go to hell this is not a time to let the fire go down the secret is God will come with you and how that you think not hallelujah then your Twitter says Daniel answered and said blessed be the name of God for ever and ever for wisdom and might are hears that's Daniel 20 22 22 and remember amen when the King he need the best shares or whatever his name was you know he won't eat you know he needed to understand what his dream was all about and God through Daniel interpreted to dream to him but this is one of the things that I love about Daniel he didn't say look at me I am the Prophet you know and and I told the King what he needs to know know then you knew where it came from and he said he changes the times and seasons go back danger element said blessed be the name of God forever and ever for wisdom and might are here and he changes the sign and the seasons he removeth kings and set it up kings he giveth wisdom unto the wise and knowledge to them that no understanding he revealeth the deep and secret things he knoweth what it is in the what is in the darkness and light dwelleth with him hallelujah had not listened Amos says God will not if he going to reveal reveal a secret he will reveal it by way of his servants of profit right hallelujah that's what his cut y'all come on somebody brother branham purpose was to reveal the deep things of God and what was in the darkness that's what this message reveals to us and you and I must understand it wasn't just a little Kentuckian it was godlike it wasn't Daniel like it was in Jeremiah Amen and all the other prophets hallelujah but what did he come to do just like he revealed to the king he meant seven years of prosperity seven years of famine prepare yourself hallelujah and that's what the Prophet did to us he said listen when I leave off the scene hallelujah it's going to get worse but prepare yourself hallelujah it's going to become a famine even in the message this message is not the famine but the preachers they won't get the people to the Holy Ghost and without the Holy Ghost you have no fruits you have no line you have nothing hallelujah but dried up pretty people his secret from God drop everything whatever you do you make sure you get the Holy Ghost you make sure you get the token nothing is more important than the token whatever you do get it there's another time to assume you will not make a rapture assuming at the end of the day all you go you won't be able to say oh my god I thought I had it the Bible says make your calling and election sure making sure now well you have a chance but the devil makes you stink if the Holy Ghost is just jumping and shouting and dancing thank God for a prophet hallelujah that brought it down it says listen this birth is just not a feeling it's a life it is the very life of God in you and he said in that day the Word of God said in that day you will know Jesus said that I'm in the father the father is in me and I am in you and if you're not certain he's yeah you better make sure it doesn't matter what it takes hallelujah understand it is God who has chosen you do you really believe you chosen I believe I am hallelujah you know Abraham didn't have a circumcision at the first he had he was chosen elected then he was circumcised hallelujah you may not get the whole egos write-off but you know when you know that you heard his voice you follow the voice and God will bring you to the purpose hallelujah think about it we're in a battle we're in a battle is that right and every military has secret weapons some they call classified that everybody don't know you might be an army but there are certain people that know certain things that you don't know uh because it classified and God has classified secrets available only to the authorized persons see everybody can't get this revelation it's only given to the authorized hallelujah amen amen amen listen you and I must understand Amen that when God even gives us these things it is given to us to keep it in a secret place is that right God gave Samson's classified information and that classified information was concerning himself if you want to remain strong and powerful never let the locks of your hair be cut off hallelujah come on somebody if you want your strength to remain never let the locks of your hair be cut off y'all hear me don't let the devil stop you at temperance don't let him stop you at patience don't even let him stop you have brotherly kindness you and I must go all the way to divine love to experience the power and strength of the Holy Ghost y'all know how that works a special class of people you don't believe it brother Browns here you will recall that I mentioned at the beginning of this message that this book we are studying is the actual revelation of Jesus himself in the church and his work in the future ages then I mentioned that it takes the Holy Spirit to give us a revelation or we will fail to get it hello that's what's wrong with people that's why they've fallen away that's why they dry it up they just thought they had the emotion experience but never had a change of heart let me tell you something God knows when you surrender everything I don't care if it's a speck of the world if you don't surrender it you won't get it hmm that's words of your prophet he said if a speck of the world is in you you do not know God whoo we have a intellectual understanding then I mentioned that it takes the Holy Spirit to give us revelation or we will fail to get bringing these two thoughts together you will see that it won't take just ordinary study and thinking to make this book real anybody who can I get a witness can I get away hallelujah man if that's all it took the intellectual put us into a shame hallelujah but thank God the Bible said these signs shall follow them that believe hallelujah it is good it is going to take the operation of the Holy Ghost that means this book can't be revealed to anyone but a special class of people it would take one with profit insight it would require the ability to hear from God it will require supernatural instruction not just a student comparing version with verses though that is good but a mystery cause the teaching of the Spirit will never become clear how we need to hear from God and lay ourselves open and become yielded to the spirit to hear and know that's the only way yielded to the spirit to hear and know I have already said this book revelation it's the consummation of the scripture it is even placed exactly right in the Canon of the scripture at the end now you you can know why it says that anyone who reads or even hears it is blessed hmm why because there's so many people said what this book is not for us it is not for the church even when I was in denomination is you to tell me he is not for the church but what it was they didn't understand it they would probably wish to cut it out what would it be for if it's not for the charges DEP made for the Jews hallelujah is for those who are blessed so how can you think your cars if you bless it you can hear it you can receive it hallelujah but the problem is God is you and I we must yield to his purpose but the sad thing about it is because the devil God is so busy in this world we got too many things is that right that's what Jesus told us that the cares of this world would choke the life out of you whew too many cares remember I said last week yesterday uh the busy means what burden under Satan's yoke huh burden under Satan's yoke he's got you when you're too busy to get with God somebody help me there is nothing of such prevailing power let me move up and you can see why they who who would add or take away from it would be cursed it would have to be so for who can add or take away from the perfect revelation of God and overcome the enemy huh who can take away from the perfect revelation of God and overcome you cannot oh you don't need you don't need the Holy Ghost you won't if you won't defeat the devil hallelujah oh you don't you don't need the travail you won't get the hope you won't you won't overcome every birth is a mess I'm not talking when you say Oh Lord I receive you into my heart that was conception but there comes a real manifestation of a son of God is that right oh the woman can see but that ain't nothing until that baby comes for that come baby come forth he's no longer living after the life of the church that's what that's how you know when a person is just feel there and heavens cut they are a biblical cord ah everybody come you come to church to get your joy you come to church you get your happiness you come to church to have your fellowship hallelujah you are still connected to the church you need your ol life and that life is Christ in yo if you can't be happy without coming to track something's wrong with you you need a leader to cut that cord Oh somebody help me here oh lord help us Jesus what's gonna happen when they close the door to this church and they will hmm they're gonna close it where will you be what's going to happen because see when that boycott comes your phone to be cut off you've got to know Jesus for yourself hallelujah you gotta have enough God in you to know amen that God is gonna meet his purpose in yo-chan tread Meshach and Abednego says listen I'm not bowing to the image I'm not bowing to the world council of churches or the s communica Council I'm not bowing to it hallelujah even you can heat the heaven million times heart it will never be able to destroy the fire that's in me I'm here for the purpose I am like the Hebrew mice I have one like those a man who's able to withstand the fire because of the real fire the Holy Ghost fire that's only inside hallelujah that's what I'm talking about hallelujah relevance said if you don't know nothing but how you got the fire lit you ought to tell somebody hallelujah captain the fire of God be lit in your life and there's no witnessing nobody to you not telling nobody about it you know I owe you think the Holy Ghost you got is the same that they got but understand some people got some strange fire if that Holy Ghost don't teach him that the word is right hallelujah I don't care how much they shout dance and speaking tongues and you try to tell him about Malachi 4 hallelujah well I don't believe that he's a prophet cut hallelujah we've gotta use a profit in this day cut what you got is not the original hallelujah because the Bible said my sheep here is my advice and the stranger they will not follow what size what size he sins as prophet as a voice of God everybody that didn't hear Moses died everybody that didn't hear Noah die People of God neither that's a secret that's a mister you and I see that the world can't see why cuz it's given to a special class of people you ought to be happy this morning this thing off the three of you Amen to know that God is giving you in stay here in the eyes to see what you gonna do you and I don't know if the devil and since I'm Jesuit in here or something we don't know when they come and go but who cares it's dripping with blood this Holy Ghost gospel is sitting with blood and if they could give their life for it I can give mine too if that's what it's gonna take when you got the real thing you know you're coming up hallelujah that's why Paul said amen oh that's where is your sting o grave where is your victory thanks be to God who giveth us the victory through our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ where is your victory is the big brother is it me you gotta know your victory is in you let the Prophet God said you might win a few battles lose a few battles but you cannot lose the wall hello doublethink he don't trip you because he didn't trip you a little bit today or yesterday but you don't understand there's a mechanism on the inside that makes you get a because the word of gazeta just can fall seven times in a day and they get up we can't help it something on the way cuz we are the resurrection or the god there's nothing of such prevailing power as a revelation of the word see when you know that he's in you know death hell or grave can hold you hallelujah ain't God good I brought my Hagar's and still left back there see in verse three our blessing is pronounced on those who give special attention to this book you bless you bless you bless us not just a blessing a splash special blessing yeah why is it special because Jesus said blessed he said blessed really little ray is it right you're blessed there's nothing of such prevailing powers the revelation of the word see in verse 3 a blessing is pronounced on those who give special attention to this book thank you sir hallelujah ain't God good hallelujah secrets known as secrets don't you underlies that your secret your living walking secret everybody look at you like they don't even understand me but sometimes those ones that are dealing in the darkness they look at you like hey I've seen him do it over and over again what is this that I can see the light how people tell me since I've been here they see lights people you don't even think but you know but they do I think this refers to the old testament customs of the priest reading the word to the congregation in the morning you see many could not read so the priest had to read to them as long as as it was the word the blessings was there it didn't matter if it was read or heard I love it I love it I love it amen you so who are you brother Brooks I'm telling you every day amen it unfolds it unfolds and you say what what do you mean in spite of all my arrows it's part of all that I come short in I grieve him every day sometimes seem like you know I'm always doing something but on the inside he still speech to me and said I love you son you're mine y'all know what I'm saying somehow he gives you that word he comes he comfort you I'll never leaving nor would I forsake you oh I have manifested my name unto the meat unto the men which dog gave me out of the world dying they were and thou gave it them me and they have kept thy word why why did they keep these guys were full of failure hallelujah amen they fastened they fought who's gonna be the greatest among
