[25:56] one of those old say songs brother
[26:01] branham used to sing one of those rich
[26:05] old songs you love the Lord as we stand
[26:18] the Holy Spirit is very sensitive
[26:21] brother branham taught us that and we
[26:27] should know that when we don't produce
[26:34] the right atmosphere God is not pleased
[26:39] and I didn't come to see you I come to
[26:45] hear from God that's all I want to hear
[26:49] from and that is God I appreciate
[26:52] everybody here appreciate our musicians
[26:57] but I also appreciate it when I know
[27:01] that the Lord Jesus is in I can't preach
[27:06] without him I can't sing without him I
[27:10] can't live without him and I don't want
[27:13] to be without him
[27:15] that's just the way it goes as we stand
[27:19] by God's grace we ask that you turn with
[27:24] us too far Philippians 4
[27:35] Philippians 4 you love the Lord will
[27:42] read the fourth chapter the fourth and
[27:49] the seventh verse and then will lead
[27:54] there and go to Ephesians three
[27:58] Philippians four four through seven
[28:06] rejoice in the Lord always and again I
[28:13] say rejoice
[28:15] let your moderation be known unto all
[28:19] men the Lord is at hand be careful for
[28:27] nothing but in everything by prayer and
[28:30] supplication with Thanksgiving let your
[28:34] requests be made known unto God and the
[28:39] peace of God which passes all
[28:42] understanding shall keep your hearts and
[28:46] minds through Christ Jesus
[28:50] I read that again and the peace of God
[28:54] which passes all understanding shall
[29:00] keep your hearts and minds through
[29:04] Christ Jesus Ephesians three
[29:21] beginning at the 14th verse of Ephesians
[29:28] through a chapter but this calls I bow
[29:33] my knee unto the father of our Lord
[29:35] Jesus Christ of whom the whole family in
[29:42] heaven and in earth his name that he
[29:50] would grant you according to the riches
[29:52] of his glory to be strengthened with
[29:55] them his might by his spirit in the
[29:58] inner man that Christ may dwell in your
[30:03] hearts by faith that ye being rooted and
[30:07] grounded in love that's important rooted
[30:10] and grounded in love may be able to
[30:14] comprehend with All Saints what is the
[30:16] breadth and the length and debt and
[30:20] height and to know the love of Christ
[30:25] which passes knowledge he might be
[30:29] filled with all the fullness of God now
[30:35] unto him that is able to do exceedingly
[30:38] abundantly above all that we ask or
[30:40] think according to the power that
[30:42] worketh in us that worketh in us unto
[30:48] Him be glory in the church by G Christ
[30:51] Jesus throughout all ages world without
[30:55] in amen let us pray father we come
[31:01] before your Lord as humbly as we know
[31:05] how and we thank you for your grace and
[31:09] your mercy we thank you for your love
[31:11] and all that you are and all that you
[31:15] will be in our lives
[31:17] father we pray hallelujah that you
[31:21] strengthen us give us words to speak
[31:25] they didn't come to hear my words they
[31:28] come to hear you
[31:29] Lord we humble ourselves before you
[31:33] father
[31:34] my will but let thine be done and your
[31:37] lovely name Jesus Christ we pray amen
[31:40] you may be seated for those who may not
[31:45] understand the reason why we do stand
[31:47] when it comes to the Word of God because
[31:49] we really believe that Jesus Christ
[31:51] lives he's alive the Bible said that he
[31:55] and his word is one and so when we read
[31:58] the word in honor of him we stand in
[32:02] honor of him I know if the President or
[32:06] someone else would come in you stand
[32:09] when the judge you come into his
[32:12] courtroom
[32:13] they say all stand and it's just a
[32:17] matter of respect that we do this so
[32:19] that you could better understand why we
[32:21] do this we're not here to worship
[32:23] anything or anyone outside of Jesus
[32:26] Christ who is the Word of God this
[32:32] message in which we are to minister this
[32:34] morning something that the Lord placed
[32:37] on my heart you know we have been
[32:39] dealing with a place that God has
[32:44] prepared and that is the the essence of
[32:50] hope or faith that a Christian have that
[32:54] we won't remain in this condition but
[32:59] Jesus even according to st. John 14 says
[33:02] let not your heart be troubled if you
[33:05] believe in God believe also in me in my
[33:09] father's house are many mansions and if
[33:11] it wasn't so I would not have told you
[33:14] but I go to prepare a place for you that
[33:17] where I am there you may be also and
[33:21] wherever he is is where I want to be now
[33:26] I want you to understand that this
[33:28] salvation in which we are speaking of
[33:30] doesn't come by human effort even though
[33:34] we believe that faith will make a man
[33:37] work we understand that is not your
[33:40] works that save you your salvation comes
[33:44] by way of God's choosing you
[33:48] not you choosing god it is what we call
[33:52] election by God's foreknowledge God
[33:56] elected us is that right so you
[34:00] understand that I'm preaching this
[34:02] message my thoughts came from the word
[34:05] it came from the the message perfect
[34:10] strength perfect weakness perfect
[34:13] weakness perfect strength how do you
[34:14] want to say it and enticing spirits and
[34:19] I would encourage you to listen to those
[34:22] but I want you to understand that this
[34:25] word that we're speaking is an eternal
[34:29] word it is a word that God has delivered
[34:32] this is what makes us different from all
[34:34] the other denominations and and when I
[34:37] say that different because we're not a
[34:38] denomination we are not an organization
[34:42] right this church this church building
[34:45] the name of this church will not save
[34:47] you salvation only comes through Jesus
[34:50] Christ the Bible says there's none other
[34:53] name no other name given unto men well
[34:57] but we whereby we must be saved and that
[34:59] is the name of Jesus Christ at that name
[35:03] every knee shall bow and every tongue
[35:05] shall confess hallelujah so I want to
[35:11] say this morning as Ephesians says for
[35:13] this cause I bow my knees unto the
[35:17] father of our Lord Jesus Christ we know
[35:21] who the father is is that right
[35:24] because Philip asked Jesus one-on-one
[35:28] occasions show us the Father and Jesus
[35:31] says hi Philip have our long been with
[35:34] you have I been with you so long you
[35:35] don't know who who I am he said when you
[35:39] see me you see the father so everything
[35:42] about Jesus Christ was a reflection of
[35:45] the invisible God Elohim himself so we
[35:51] realized by God's grace that this whole
[35:54] thing that we are now experiencing is
[35:58] about God's love
[36:02] hello you and I must know that God's
[36:06] love is past understanding with this
[36:14] natural mind we can't understand them we
[36:19] cannot comprehend God with this you can
[36:23] even understand God existence with this
[36:27] cause with this amen we have a beginning
[36:31] and we have a ending but God is eternal
[36:35] he has no beginning nor ending and you
[36:39] understand in order to understand God
[36:42] you must believe God by faith right
[36:46] and faith is something that God gives
[36:50] you you can't even believe in God
[36:53] without God giving you grace to believe
[36:55] in it but when that revelation comes
[36:59] there is nothing then can separate you
[37:03] from knowing who he is I like to preach
[37:11] this morning the love that cannot be
[37:14] defined something that God has given us
[37:20] that can't cannot be defined and
[37:24] people's about oh I love you but can you
[37:27] define love anybody seen it have you
[37:32] seen love but love is more real than the
[37:38] book that I'm holding in my hand love is
[37:42] something that comes from a different
[37:44] dimension oh if we could buy it I would
[37:52] work all day just to keep it just to
[37:56] have it because I find out that with
[38:00] love I could conquer everything
[38:06] hallelujah but because God the real love
[38:10] is God not the inferior love fill your
[38:15] love
[38:15] get so jealous gonna kill the man but
[38:18] divine love can love so much it will
[38:22] forgive a man and you and I must
[38:26] understand that God is willing to give
[38:31] this love that you can't you and I
[38:34] cannot define to us I didn't say you had
[38:38] to buy it I said he's willing to give it
[38:43] hallelujah
[38:44] see because without God being you you
[38:48] will never understand him neither will
[38:52] you know him he must live in you for you
[38:57] to even comprehend what he is all about
[39:04] when we think about the riches of his
[39:07] glory and I must say this in just a
[39:10] moment get to my point in womb in a
[39:11] moment the riches of his glory the Bible
[39:15] said is past finding out you know and I
[39:19] have been born into a world I call it
[39:23] the world of death the first moment you
[39:27] take a breath in this life you move from
[39:31] life to death as a child the cute baby
[39:36] you're dying with every breath
[39:39] hallelujah and to know that this world
[39:43] is a world of death why would you say
[39:45] that because everything that comes to
[39:48] life in this world must die and you and
[39:53] I must understand if that be true there
[39:56] must be a world somewhere where there is
[40:02] no death there must be a world somewhere
[40:06] where the people and things never die
[40:12] that right there's a contrast there's a
[40:15] light and there's a darkness
[40:17] mallalieu yeah and we are in this realm
[40:21] of contrasts of good and and of evil
[40:26] hello before
[40:29] Adam and Eve sin it was all good
[40:33] there was no evil it was like the world
[40:36] that we're going to hallelujah there was
[40:40] nothing that could harm or hurt Oh glory
[40:45] to God so we know it exists but when
[40:49] Adam and Eve fail they introduced us to
[40:55] this realm of good evil and every since
[41:01] then we've had to deal with good and
[41:04] evil whether you like it or not it's
[41:07] true because before Adam and Eve fell
[41:11] they stood upright hallelujah and a
[41:17] child was to be born at right like a
[41:20] tree it goes up right but because of the
[41:26] fall we must fall we have come into a
[41:29] fallen world and when a woman has a baby
[41:32] the first thing the baby do it does is
[41:34] drop it falls but that's not the way
[41:37] it's supposed to be the way it was
[41:41] supposed to be we were supposed to come
[41:43] upright and forever live upright but now
[41:48] we see the trees when they get old and
[41:50] they die they fall because of what took
[41:54] place in the Garden of Eden and you and
[41:57] I must understand that this world
[41:59] something had to bring a correction
[42:03] hallelujah something had to bring a
[42:06] correction to this world otherwise God
[42:10] word will go back void and we know that
[42:14] God's Word can not go back boy
[42:16] whatever God speaks it must come back to
[42:20] him just the way he had in his mind
[42:24] hallelujah and when he taught Adam and
[42:27] Eve to be fruitful and multiply every
[42:31] see every child everybody that would
[42:35] come out of that loin was made and
[42:38] created right in the mind of God even
[42:41] though it wasn't in existence
[42:43] since here it was there is that right
[42:47] that's the Bible God said Jeremiah I
[42:51] knew you before you was formed in your
[42:52] mother's womb hallelujah
[42:55] as you say the virgin shall conceive
[42:57] talking about Jesus himself where was he
[43:01] before he came here
[43:03] somewhere somewhere somewhere there was
[43:06] representation of him hallelujah and you
[43:13] if you are eternal and see what happened
[43:19] who I love this I love this so much
[43:21] because when I when I fell because this
[43:26] is a love story you can't define it you
[43:30] think about it before I eat fell nothing
[43:35] was out of place and if there was
[43:38] something that Adam did not like he
[43:41] could change it just by his words and we
[43:45] realized by God's grace him and
[43:48] everything was perfect there was you
[43:50] know whatever wasn't he made it so and
[43:54] you and I must realize Amen
[43:57] such a control and God told Adam he says
[44:01] listen I want you to subdue he ought he
[44:06] already knew something was coming put
[44:10] everything under your feet in other
[44:14] words I want you to be God of this earth
[44:17] and I want you to rule it like I would
[44:20] rule it bring everything under
[44:24] subjection this love cannot be defined
[44:28] but then when I look at Eve and she
[44:31] comes along and he identifies her and
[44:33] tells her who she is and where she came
[44:36] from the thing she loved bone of my bone
[44:39] and flesh of my flesh folks there was
[44:41] something going on there they didn't
[44:43] have to date to love each other it was
[44:47] instantaneous because he was born of his
[44:50] bone and flesh of his flesh he knew
[44:52] where she came from and he knew she came
[44:54] out from him but she
[44:56] yeah she was deceived you understand me
[45:01] how how is it that God always stands for
[45:05] you even when you fall it's deep that's
[45:10] what I call deep that no matter how many
[45:13] times you transgress his love he comes
[45:17] after you because that was the way it
[45:22] was in the time of Adam and Eve whoa my
[45:27] like you heard me say I could say I love
[45:30] you I love you I love you oh I love you
[45:33] but you'll never know or I will never
[45:37] know how much I love you until you do
[45:39] something contrary to what I believe you
[45:45] should do God so loved the world as
[45:51] contrary as you and I can become even as
[45:55] Christians God still loves us Amen it's
[46:00] nothing amen is that right
[46:03] that's what Paul said who should
[46:05] separate me from the love of God who
[46:07] shall separate me no one can separate me
[46:11] and who can separate the love that Adam
[46:16] had for his wife he didn't say what he
[46:23] said who showing that there was an
[46:25] individual what we call a serpent that
[46:29] tried to break that law hallelujah but
[46:33] it could not break the love it
[46:36] solidified the love somebody help me
[46:40] here it was at that time when Adam could
[46:43] oh he could say all Adam so loved Eve
[46:49] because in that soul
[46:53] there's nothing can be defined you can't
[46:57] define that soul because it's eternal
[47:02] hallelujah that's how it is with us and
[47:06] he
[47:08] lost everything
[47:12] he lost all of his authority he lost the
[47:17] power of the spoken word
[47:19] he lost his position as being God of the
[47:23] earth
[47:23] he lost his position in God but even
[47:30] though the devil could break the
[47:34] fellowship he could never stop the
[47:40] relationship because Adam was truly a
[47:43] son and it's just like any father and
[47:46] mother no matter how bad the kids get
[47:48] you know they're still yours
[47:50] that's how it is with God no matter how
[47:53] bad you become you still here
[47:56] maybe I'm the only one that's happy
[47:59] about this oh I've heard it so much but
[48:03] I'm gonna tell you something you know
[48:03] why you you're not excited about what
[48:05] I'm saying
[48:06] cuz you've heard it here it's not in
[48:08] your heart if it was in your heart it
[48:10] would bring you joy it would stimulate
[48:12] you to a place that you couldn't help
[48:15] but just get excited about what's being
[48:17] said hallelujah oh god help us Jesus I
[48:24] tell you what I'm trusting that we would
[48:27] get to heaven we're gonna have a little
[48:28] more excitement than this Oh help me
[48:35] Jesus because you and I must you gotta
[48:38] understand we have an interpreter so I'm
[48:41] trying my best to work with the
[48:43] interpreter so I want you to understand
[48:47] by God's grace that God's love is so
[48:51] rich and so pure and sometimes we don't
[48:55] even understand what God is doing but
[49:00] even when it came to Adam and Eve he was
[49:02] showing in in a short the redemption
[49:06] plan he showed how Adam and Eve was
[49:11] guilty and he showed how a bloody lamb
[49:17] something took their place when they had
[49:21] already been charged and said today that
[49:23] you eat of this tree you should surely
[49:25] God God had already taken care of it
[49:32] before they even step foot on earth
[49:35] there was a lamb slain before the
[49:38] foundation of the world for them there's
[49:43] somebody that's why I don't worry about
[49:46] being saved and don't worry about being
[49:50] in the rapture and don't worry about
[49:52] those things why because I am see when
[49:59] you have met God I know preach it
[50:02] brother when you have met God for
[50:06] yourself he's not the God as I brother
[50:08] said yesterday the god of somebody else
[50:10] he's your God y'all young people who
[50:14] missed it yesterday it was excellent it
[50:16] was really wonderful oh my goodness
[50:19] Bernini how I hope by God's grace it out
[50:22] my brother Samuel would with Minister
[50:24] that message again it was really good
[50:28] now with the bed with it so I want you
[50:31] to understand by God's grace he meant
[50:33] that here God comes alone and the Bible
[50:37] says for God so loved the world that he
[50:40] how many y'all know how to quote that
[50:41] scripture but do we really understand it
[50:45] that God saved the whole world knowing
[50:48] that the whole world would not be saved
[50:52] but he saw you there and he understood
[50:56] he had to purchase a whole thing
[50:59] just to get you and me Oh hallelujah
[51:04] what a love how many of you have ever
[51:07] been really sick and the pain is racking
[51:10] your body and you just wanted to quit
[51:13] and won't quit now every woman has
[51:16] experienced them exactly those who have
[51:18] had babies I'm talking about that kind
[51:20] of pain it's excruciating it's one of
[51:23] those kind of pains you want to stop and
[51:25] nobody can't help it stop and you're
[51:29] thinking yourself the sooner this thing
[51:31] stop the better I'll be and while it's
[51:34] going on
[51:35] feel like I'm gonna lose my mind some of
[51:38] y'all sisters don't forgot that's what
[51:43] they say usually when you have to have
[51:44] the baby you forgot what kind of pain it
[51:46] brings but nevertheless I've experienced
[51:50] the pain one time and I in that pain it
[51:53] was so beyond my comprehension it was a
[51:56] level 10 and above and I wanted to get
[52:02] out of that pain and there was nothing
[52:05] that was taking me out of that position
[52:08] and literally it was setting my mind and
[52:13] I was thinking to myself I thought to
[52:15] myself Calvary Calvary far beyond what
[52:22] I'm experiencing and not one time did he
[52:26] desire to get out of it once she began
[52:29] into it one time in the garden he's a
[52:33] father I wouldn't this passively but
[52:36] nevertheless not my will but thine be
[52:40] done
[52:40] think about it giving birth to one child
[52:45] versus giving birth to a number that no
[52:50] man could number can you imagine the
[52:55] pain the pain was beyond human
[52:59] comprehension
[53:00] and yet he did that for you and me he
[53:08] did that
[53:09] knowing that times you and I would be
[53:12] ashamed of him he did that knowing at
[53:16] times you and I would wit would would
[53:18] would walk away from his word he did
[53:22] that for you and I knowing that we would
[53:26] never be faithful with to him like he's
[53:28] been faithful to us hallelujah a love
[53:32] that cannot be defined you won't find
[53:35] that on the human level hallelujah oh
[53:40] you won't find it I'll say it again on
[53:42] the human level but God love is not only
[53:47] human level
[53:49] it is not what you can give me it's what
[53:52] he can give us hallelujah God gave his
[53:57] life for us and you know what we forget
[54:02] we forget what the sacrifice was all
[54:05] about we forget it
[54:08] hallelujah but God is a God that never
[54:11] will forget is that right
[54:14] he said I'll never forget you I have
[54:17] engraved you in the palms of my lo a
[54:24] love that cannot be defined and even
[54:29] when you think you're going through hard
[54:31] times God is still in control somebody
[54:36] help me here even when the enemy comes
[54:40] in like a flood the Bible said I lift up
[54:43] a standard hallelujah even when the
[54:47] devil thinks he's got you God said you
[54:49] don't have me hallelujah because you got
[54:55] to realize you're representing God there
[54:58] is not a fortress there is not a wall
[55:04] there is not a building there is not a
[55:08] hell that can hold God y'all hit me and
[55:15] as long as you got God on the inside of
[55:18] you you are victorious somebody helped
[55:23] me here let's fly with the Eagles fly
[55:27] come on somebody and you must understand
[55:31] where the eagle is he looks down at the
[55:36] battles where the Eagles fly he can see
[55:41] the storm coming from afar somebody help
[55:45] me here where the Eagles fly they build
[55:49] their nests in a place of safety
[55:53] not even the Predators from Earth can go
[55:57] up that far
[55:59] hallelujah where the Eagles fly they
[56:03] have eyes that can look into eternity
[56:10] they can see the enemy y'all heard that
[56:14] brother preached here last week a few
[56:16] weeks ago he said what does the ego do
[56:17] to the serpent he goes down and he
[56:20] grabbed that serpent he takes him up
[56:23] where the eagles fly hallelujah and then
[56:28] what does he done don't do to the
[56:30] serpent he drops the serpent I think
[56:34] tonight or this morning we need to drop
[56:35] the serpent
[56:37] hallelujah we need to destroy the devil
[56:40] I smiled up hallelujah and understand no
[56:44] weapon formed against us can prosper
[56:47] that's the kind of love I'm talking
[56:49] about I'm talking about the love of God
[56:52] there's always in your favor when you
[56:59] don't even think he's working he's
[57:01] working demo somebody and i'ma jump to
[57:05] something here because I want you to
[57:08] understand answer probably God said in
[57:11] the message paradox what is the most
[57:14] important thing in the world he says is
[57:18] God's church God made the church he made
[57:23] it for a purpose to take a church out of
[57:27] it a bride and that's the most important
[57:30] job in the world
[57:33] Oh somebody help me you mean to tell me
[57:37] I'm important yes you mean to tell me
[57:43] that you are important
[57:46] that's God's love and God's love amen
[57:53] makes you important even when you don't
[57:56] feel important Oh Lord y'all go let me
[58:00] shout by myself I feel like just
[58:02] shouting myself well because I realized
[58:06] today that nothing no weapon nothing no
[58:12] one
[58:13] nothing can separate me from the love of
[58:16] God that's the kind of love hey somebody
[58:24] help me here you say what are you saying
[58:27] brother see this is what would you must
[58:29] understand this good and evil works in
[58:32] your favor well yes
[58:35] boys stop playing this good and evil
[58:38] works in your favor and this good and
[58:46] evil is for you don't let that bother
[58:52] you my point is how can evil work in my
[58:56] favor because God uses evil to purge you
[59:06] though the trying of your faith through
[59:10] the trial of your faith is more precious
[59:13] than gold you don't even know what
[59:17] you're going through what you got in you
[59:18] and to God let the devil comes I'm a
[59:23] district oh we can look at job and I'm
[59:26] just gonna use him for a short period of
[59:28] time but we look at job and God said to
[59:30] the devil where are you going where are
[59:34] you going I know you up to no good
[59:37] [Laughter]
[59:41] yes I know you're looking for some
[59:45] adventure let me ask you this have you
[59:47] considered my servant job just so you
[59:52] know just so you know not one trial can
[59:56] can knock on your door until God says is
[59:59] okay when it does God is expecting you
[1:00:04] to be the winner and reason why some of
[1:00:09] us go through battles is because we open
[1:00:12] the door to the delivery man but if we
[1:00:16] would shut the door or not even open the
[1:00:19] door the battle would go on because you
[1:00:23] just won
[1:00:25] by not accepting the devil's mail and
[1:00:32] you and I must understand by God's grace
[1:00:36] that when it comes to God amen and you
[1:00:41] you are always victorious is that
[1:00:45] disturbed is that the word Paul said
[1:00:48] we're more than conquerors we just not
[1:00:50] oh I just hope to make it in I don't
[1:00:52] already made it I don't know about y'all
[1:00:54] but I've already made it I'm sitting in
[1:00:57] heavenly places right now in Christ
[1:01:00] Jesus yet I'm standing here on earth
[1:01:03] whoa I feel like shouting let me get
[1:01:06] back to Jobe
[1:01:07] God didn't already seen the ending of
[1:01:09] job's battle you think God gonna brag on
[1:01:13] you with hope God is a God of faith not
[1:01:16] Hope Garden already bragged on you
[1:01:21] thousands of years he's been talking
[1:01:23] about this bride thousands of years he's
[1:01:28] talked about you and he knows you going
[1:01:31] to win he knows that no matter what kind
[1:01:35] of trouble you into you coming out he
[1:01:38] knows that something on the inside of
[1:01:40] you will never let you stay down but let
[1:01:44] me say it like this you got to go down
[1:01:46] in order to come up hallelujah see you
[1:01:52] you you you got to understand Jesus
[1:01:54] Christ Himself descended first then he
[1:01:59] ascended but he had to come down in
[1:02:02] order to go up you were there in your
[1:02:06] theophany form Oh somebody help me here
[1:02:10] is that right but you had to come here
[1:02:13] down in order to go up somebody help me
[1:02:19] here so even when you go through your
[1:02:22] trials and you're going down don't worry
[1:02:25] about that because a just man may fall
[1:02:31] seven times in the day but he's gonna
[1:02:34] get up you're going to get up
[1:02:37] something on the inside of you that will
[1:02:40] make you get up many times you have said
[1:02:45] Lord I can't take it I can't go any
[1:02:48] further
[1:02:49] God knows that's the count of mine he
[1:02:52] knows there's some representation on the
[1:02:54] inside of him that's not gonna let you
[1:02:56] do that hallelujah I don't care if you
[1:03:00] feel like you've been backslidden for
[1:03:01] years God has something on the inside of
[1:03:04] you
[1:03:04] that's not gonna let you stay because I
[1:03:14] want you to understand it ain't about
[1:03:17] you it's about him and Jobe had to go
[1:03:22] down is that right the Bible job said
[1:03:25] God says he's a man perfect he's perfect
[1:03:27] I look at him as being perfect he's
[1:03:30] perfect and maybe Joe got a little bit
[1:03:32] into himself you know I don't know but
[1:03:35] God had to let Jobe suffer so Jove
[1:03:40] himself can see where he stood oh I love
[1:03:44] God who I love God
[1:03:46] let's see how much you love him when the
[1:03:47] trials come hmm but this God love
[1:03:53] doesn't waver like ours his love is
[1:03:56] constant y'all hear what I'm saying so
[1:03:59] what did Joe what did God do his love
[1:04:01] his constant love stayed right there
[1:04:04] with Joe have you ever been there
[1:04:08] you're going through trials and you feel
[1:04:10] no anointing you don't feel that quick
[1:04:15] and enjoy you don't feel it yet you're
[1:04:18] going through it and you're thinking God
[1:04:19] where are you and we forget he says I'll
[1:04:23] never leave you nor will I forsake you
[1:04:26] so it's not like he's gone on a vacation
[1:04:29] he's just being quiet he wants to see
[1:04:34] what you're going to do yeah I ever seen
[1:04:37] that before let's say a little child
[1:04:39] when they're getting ready to walk and
[1:04:41] you see them you see them fall you let
[1:04:46] them get back up you see him fall you
[1:04:48] let them get back up and then especially
[1:04:51] when they first started standing right
[1:04:53] everybody get quiet cuz they standing
[1:04:58] you want to applaud but you don't
[1:05:01] applaud until they go down then you fall
[1:05:03] but we want them to know that they have
[1:05:06] achieved something hallelujah
[1:05:10] and you got to understand how did they
[1:05:12] learn these things that they can walk
[1:05:13] cuz they looked and watch to you living
[1:05:17] epistles written and read of all men
[1:05:20] that's how people know that Christianity
[1:05:22] is real when they can see Christianity
[1:05:25] live through you and me that all right
[1:05:31] y'all know we the fallen creature Eagles
[1:05:35] don't know Eagles don't go to school
[1:05:37] right an eagle in the animal how many of
[1:05:45] y'all can build an eagle's nest
[1:05:46] somebody tell me oh no matter how
[1:05:49] brilliant you are then therefore the
[1:05:52] eagle is more superior so they can do
[1:05:56] something you can't do see how the
[1:05:58] nonsense that is but the point I'm
[1:06:01] trying to make is there something that
[1:06:03] God put in them that's transferred
[1:06:07] through them by the DNA or like that
[1:06:09] whoo oh man about ran on that one
[1:06:12] hey something transferred in them by the
[1:06:18] DNA that that somehow this knowledge
[1:06:22] comes it's real Holly
[1:06:25] it comes god mercy if y'all could only
[1:06:30] understand what I'm saying hey see what
[1:06:32] I'm seeing
[1:06:32] it's just that DNA transfers that
[1:06:35] knowledge of how to build an S you'll
[1:06:40] never see mama eagle and daddy eagle
[1:06:43] with a pen pad or some kind of written
[1:06:46] board to instruct them it's already
[1:06:48] given in his past from generation to
[1:06:51] generation and that's what happens to
[1:06:54] the real seat of God if you get the germ
[1:06:57] of God if it quicker than you dare our
[1:07:00] knowledge of God that transpired in you
[1:07:03] you cannot even explain it oh come on
[1:07:09] somebody what about flying when that
[1:07:12] Eagle is kind of being taught to fly
[1:07:16] hallelujah
[1:07:17] guess what happens mama ego takes them
[1:07:20] up knowing they got to go down
[1:07:24] hallelujah
[1:07:25] so sometimes elevation and sometimes
[1:07:30] promotion hallelujah you don't know that
[1:07:35] promotion comes with problems huh
[1:07:41] alright come on mister truth even in
[1:07:45] marriage oh I know I got the right one
[1:07:49] it comes with problems the point is when
[1:07:53] you go up you gotta come down in order
[1:07:56] to go back up and that mother Eagle said
[1:08:00] get on board and those little Eagle is
[1:08:03] jump on the back and she'll take him up
[1:08:06] and all of a sudden the ride is no
[1:08:09] longer fun cuz she flips hallelujah and
[1:08:15] we see flips you can hear those little
[1:08:18] Eagle scream right and she doesn't go
[1:08:26] she doesn't just rush to their rescue
[1:08:29] she waits a little bit and to see what
[1:08:33] they gonna do hallelujah and if they
[1:08:36] don't get it the first time she'll drop
[1:08:38] that position and she'd get him again so
[1:08:40] you better get that the second time
[1:08:41] because you know what if you don't get
[1:08:44] it the second time there's gonna be a
[1:08:45] third right that's the way god watch

[1:12:18] everybody that comes here comes that way
[1:12:22] hey you don't come here by no flying
[1:12:24] saucer
[1:12:26] nobody teleported you here you came by
[1:12:32] your mother's womb and if you had to be
[1:12:36] born here in order to get into that
[1:12:38] other world you must be born that's what
[1:12:41] Jesus said he said to Nicodemus that
[1:12:44] which is born of the flesh is flesh but
[1:12:46] you must be born again and that's once
[1:12:48] to get over into that land you must be
[1:12:51] born of the Spirit that must be our Holy
[1:12:54] Ghost in your life in order for you to
[1:12:56] go there because the Bible tells me
[1:12:59] you're caught in the book of Revelation
[1:13:00] even nothing that will defile that
[1:13:04] shitty will enter therein hallelujah
[1:13:10] I hope I'm not screaming so much but the
[1:13:12] point is I think a lot of times people
[1:13:14] forget you're gonna die
[1:13:16] your momma call me your mama can hold
[1:13:18] your hand but if your time for you to
[1:13:20] die ain't none she can do about it this
[1:13:24] is what gets me doctors think they're
[1:13:25] gods but know what none of them can
[1:13:28] preserve life hmm they do that you know
[1:13:34] they could come to you and they act like
[1:13:36] they're in charge they charge and what
[1:13:41] they using is of God
[1:13:43] science God created it and people
[1:13:47] believing that more than they do believe
[1:13:49] in God why not believe in the man who
[1:13:52] created it
[1:13:52] oh come on somebody let's move on
[1:13:57] listen what we need is fire you know
[1:14:01] love is fire fire is love in the
[1:14:08] perverted sense is called fire huh did
[1:14:14] you all know that oh I'll come on the
[1:14:17] scripture says it's better for a man to
[1:14:19] marry than to burn that's perverted love
[1:14:23] in the fire for and it was real love
[1:14:29] it's real fire oh come on somebody
[1:14:37] yes so what do you mean every time God
[1:14:40] does something it is produced by love
[1:14:45] hello let me say it like this when God
[1:14:48] got in the fire was shot that rat
[1:14:51] Meshach and Abednego it was nothing they
[1:14:53] did it was because God loved them God
[1:14:57] loved him and God came down and stepped
[1:15:00] in the fire that woman caught in
[1:15:04] adultery
[1:15:04] it was nothing she did it because God
[1:15:08] lotta love conquers everything when God
[1:15:16] went down to the tomb of Lazarus wasn't
[1:15:20] that Mary Martha did what nothing
[1:15:22] Lazarus did but I tell you what happened
[1:15:25] those who saw Jesus saw him weep and
[1:15:30] they said wow he truly loved that man
[1:15:37] you want to see God victoriously in your
[1:15:41] life you let the love of God radiate
[1:15:45] through you and it will change even
[1:15:48] death grip somebody help me here that's
[1:15:52] why we're losing battles because we do
[1:15:55] not have
[1:15:56] I love and we're trying to fit you with
[1:15:59] human love you can't God you need God's
[1:16:02] love to conquer Satan in this day oh my
[1:16:07] because you care mouthing Mary cared but
[1:16:11] they didn't they weren't packing what
[1:16:12] Jesus was packing y'all love it
[1:16:17] I know y'all getting tired so many
[1:16:19] people just doze enough and all that
[1:16:22] kind of stuff
[1:16:23] sleepy people of God have mercy we
[1:16:29] appreciate you those who fights some a
[1:16:33] mean fight go give them a fan give them
[1:16:35] a pill of somebody you know I must
[1:16:40] realize by God's grace amen that when
[1:16:43] God is a paradox right you can't explain
[1:16:48] it but it's real hallelujah you can't
[1:16:53] love God if you don't love correction
[1:16:56] God is a God of correction he's a God of
[1:17:01] correction and people when you start
[1:17:04] correcting people they get mad and look
[1:17:07] at you they stare at you to give you the
[1:17:09] high and I'm scared I'm not afraid we
[1:17:17] worked with human flesh I'm not afraid
[1:17:21] why you don't see him but I know he's
[1:17:24] here and I know that when I pray for
[1:17:28] people because when they get attitudes I
[1:17:30] think about that brother that fell dead
[1:17:31] that just caught the attitude against
[1:17:33] the Prophet I'm not a prophet but I'm
[1:17:35] standing instead your attitude toward me
[1:17:40] can get you in trouble
[1:17:41] especially if I'm preaching what God
[1:17:43] says humble yourself therefore under the
[1:17:48] mighty hand of God somebody help me
[1:17:53] because you got a writ you said old
[1:17:55] brothers I don't believe I've got to go
[1:17:56] down first yes even some time when God
[1:18:00] says it's okay to come is that right
[1:18:03] Peter said Lord if that be you bid me
[1:18:06] come he started walking
[1:18:10] on the water he may have been in another
[1:18:14] dimension I don't know but the Bible
[1:18:16] said Peter walked and in just a moment
[1:18:21] time he began to sink because he started
[1:18:24] looking around at everybody what they're
[1:18:27] doing all these safer they don't pray
[1:18:29] they don't dress right why should I huh
[1:18:33] and all of a sudden he started sinking
[1:18:36] and the only way he could have gotten
[1:18:38] out of that situation is that he had to
[1:18:41] say save me Lord right there in the
[1:18:47] reach of Jesus and he started sinking
[1:18:50] that's how it is with our blessings
[1:18:52] sometimes God got it right there in your
[1:18:55] reach and at that moment you start
[1:18:57] doubting God and guess what you don't
[1:19:00] sink and the only thing they're gonna
[1:19:03] get you out of that situation is when
[1:19:05] you say lord save me and mean it from
[1:19:08] your heart I'm almost done I know I've
[1:19:11] gone along this morning but nevertheless
[1:19:14] I want you to understand when it comes
[1:19:17] to promises so that you don't think that
[1:19:20] God is just beating up on you I want you
[1:19:22] to understand that when God promised you
[1:19:25] something there's a price to pay
[1:19:27] oh I'm right you gonna suffer when God
[1:19:34] told Joseph by way of vision do y'all
[1:19:36] have a vision do y'all have a vision if
[1:19:40] you don't you lost the bible said
[1:19:42] without a vision the people perish
[1:19:49] without it if you don't see where you're
[1:19:53] going you're lost if there is no sense
[1:19:56] of direction you're lost on this journey
[1:20:02] like that you heard me say you know if
[1:20:04] I'm traveling and I might be a place and
[1:20:07] I don't know where I'm at I don't know
[1:20:11] where I want to go but I never know
[1:20:13] where I'm going with a map until I find
[1:20:17] out where I am on the map once I find
[1:20:20] out where I am on the map
[1:20:22] I could then plot my course to where I'm
[1:20:25] going that's my preaching is all about
[1:20:30] preaching is trying to give you a place
[1:20:33] on the map where you know where you are
[1:20:35] in Christ so that you'll know which way
[1:20:40] to go help me Jesus I'm almost done
[1:20:46] so I want you to understand amen even
[1:20:50] though God had given Joseph a vision
[1:20:54] Joseph had to suffer to get there he had
[1:20:58] to go through betrayal oh I tell you
[1:21:02] what oh not my best friend
[1:21:05] no your brother there the one betrayed
[1:21:09] you and guess what
[1:21:13] before you be crowned by God you got to
[1:21:17] forgive him hello before God crowns you
[1:21:25] you got to forgive those who have
[1:21:27] betrayed you somebody help me here this
[1:21:36] is serious
[1:21:39] was it with Jesus to Jesus even when
[1:21:43] they were he was and his last breath he
[1:21:46] says Father forgive them for they know
[1:21:47] not what they do he had to forgive those
[1:21:51] who betrayed him and they were of his
[1:21:53] own household I'm just storing those
[1:21:58] things out at you if I said be careful
[1:22:01] for nothing but in everything by prayer
[1:22:04] and supplication with Thanksgiving let
[1:22:07] your requests be made known unto God and
[1:22:12] the peace of God come when you are
[1:22:15] troubled when you are full of anxiety
[1:22:18] when Satan is flat put you in such a
[1:22:21] state of mind you need to talk to God
[1:22:24] he's a peace Giver hallelujah he's a
[1:22:31] chain breaker
[1:22:33] Inu uses singing that song if you don't
[1:22:36] believe it
[1:22:36] he's the chain breaker and when you talk
[1:22:42] to Jesus who is the Prince of Peace
[1:22:45] hallelujah
[1:22:46] he'll give you a peace that surpasses
[1:22:49] all understanding I don't know why I'm
[1:22:53] not upset anymore the storm is still
[1:22:56] raging but you know what the difference
[1:22:58] is I'm in the cleft of the rock
[1:23:00] hallelujah I'm in the shouting praise
[1:23:04] where I can watch the storm and still
[1:23:06] have my peace which passes all
[1:23:12] understanding shall keep your hearts and
[1:23:15] minds through Christ Jesus don't tell me
[1:23:19] he's not the remedy to your problem he's
[1:23:22] the solution to every problem every
[1:23:25] problem but you know what it will not
[1:23:29] work for you if you don't believe it you
[1:23:33] said I don't know how to let go I used
[1:23:37] to think it like this come up into that
[1:23:38] Pentecostal room thinking I had to fast
[1:23:41] so many days mmm I thought maybe if I
[1:23:45] scream and howl or nothing whoo
[1:23:47] hallelujah I could shout it out and all
[1:23:53] I realized all these years all I had to
[1:23:56] do was this let it go let it go is of no
[1:24:07] value anyway let go you should with God
[1:24:14] I want the Holy Ghost I don't know how
[1:24:18] to let these things go yes you do you
[1:24:22] just let it go you just drop it don't
[1:24:30] care about where it lands drop the thing
[1:24:33] in other words stop is that right
[1:24:41] you say brother Brooks and I'm not crazy
[1:24:43] maybe I am but I remember South South
[1:24:46] African brother
[1:24:47] who was telling me a story about this
[1:24:49] man who stole his buggy they called him
[1:24:51] those are those are we call him my SUVs
[1:24:54] stole his buggy and the man was running
[1:24:58] and he said stop in the name of Jesus
[1:25:01] [Laughter]
[1:25:04] and the man stopped hallelujah see
[1:25:10] that's the spoken word you got it that
[1:25:13] authority is yours you tell the devil
[1:25:17] stop I'm not riding you anymore
[1:25:22] I'm not caring all with you no more I'm
[1:25:25] not I'm done and watch God work for you
[1:25:30] he's got to see that word come out of
[1:25:32] your mouth first you got to speak out
[1:25:35] and I'm gonna tell you something you
[1:25:37] can't easily lie even if it doesn't
[1:25:39] connect you keep speaking it right extra
[1:25:43] extra read all about it I'm healed even
[1:25:45] if your faith is not active at that
[1:25:48] point in time if you keep speaking once
[1:25:51] that word is activated by faith it's
[1:25:55] finished my last little quota from
[1:26:03] paradox why would we be afraid to take
[1:26:08] that word to ourselves and apply it to
[1:26:13] ourselves what is the problem we can
[1:26:18] have faith for everybody else but when
[1:26:21] it comes to us our selves we find it so
[1:26:25] difficult to apply it no you're not
[1:26:30] worthy
[1:26:31] no you never will be worthy he makes you
[1:26:35] worthy his your worthiness comes by his
[1:26:39] grace oh I don't live right
[1:26:42] nobody did with Jesus the Bible said all
[1:26:45] come short of the glory of God only one
[1:26:48] man was perfect and that's Jesus Christ
[1:26:50] and he said he became our sin that we
[1:26:56] might become his righteousness
[1:27:00] let's Stan you can't define his love and
[1:27:05] I'm gonna tell you something I'm not
[1:27:07] gonna call I'm not gonna come short I'm
[1:27:09] not I'm not I refused to allow this
[1:27:13] world to make me live like an
[1:27:15] underprivileged child I refuse it you
[1:27:23] know if I watched everybody else and
[1:27:25] everybody else's behavior you know how I
[1:27:27] probably wouldn't even be here
[1:27:29] but you know what I've had an experience
[1:27:32] for myself I know God for myself maybe
[1:27:37] I'm not where I should be but I do know
[1:27:40] I'm not where I used to be and it ain't
[1:27:43] no matter if I'm living I'm living all
[1:27:46] the signs of life is in me and all the
[1:27:50] signs of life should be in you let me
[1:27:53] tell you something I learn about nature
[1:27:56] nature expresses itself according to the
[1:28:01] order in which it has been created in
[1:28:05] other words you'll never see a Apple
[1:28:08] transforming itself into an orange
[1:28:12] every see to bring forth this kind and
[1:28:14] that's what we've been preaching that's
[1:28:17] what Malachi 4 was all about to give us
[1:28:20] a word that was unadulterated that we
[1:28:23] can produce the kind of seed that he was
[1:28:27] carrying and that seed was the seed of
[1:28:30] God a word
[1:28:34] without his own thoughts and without his
[1:28:36] own desires and you and I must
[1:28:39] understand if that seed is in us and it
[1:28:41] is Quicken you don't have to worry about
[1:28:45] that baby forming itself hallelujah is
[1:28:50] that right all you do is you God use use
[1:28:53] using and in the way of a conception but
[1:28:57] when God comes into you and that
[1:28:59] conception is made that child will grow
[1:29:02] as long as you handle it in a healthy
[1:29:05] way feeding it drinking when you ought
[1:29:08] to drink doing the proper things it
[1:29:11] grows because it's life outside of your
[1:29:15] life and that's how it is with true
[1:29:18] believers oh I don't know I just I just
[1:29:23] got to stop I gotta quit okay well if
[1:29:26] you get God you ain't got to quit it
[1:29:29] will quit you oh Lord
[1:29:33] do you know right under well I should
[1:29:35] have been you know I took that last
[1:29:36] drink yesterday and I think I'm gonna
[1:29:42] take another one today you don't have to
[1:29:47] quit drinking if you get enough god
[1:29:50] it will quit you is that right come on
[1:29:55] sisters y'all those of us who don't have
[1:29:57] babies and everything else you know you
[1:29:59] probably before you got pregnant you
[1:30:00] love cheeseburgers
[1:30:04] but if you get a baby and he don't like
[1:30:06] cheeseburgers you're gonna have trouble
[1:30:09] [Music]
[1:30:11] is that the true that burp that baby go
[1:30:15] like whoa are they working hallelujah
[1:30:19] but what if that baby like pickles with
[1:30:21] with with with peanut butter and you
[1:30:24] know that don't even sound good
[1:30:27] guess what before you know it you lose a
[1:30:30] Papago give me some pickles and peanut
[1:30:32] butter why because that baby is calling
[1:30:37] for something it means you may not need
[1:30:39] it but the baby knows in order to grow
[1:30:42] healthy there's something that peanut
[1:30:44] butter and something in that pill co
[1:30:46] that's gonna make me physically healthy
[1:30:48] hallelujah that's how the Holy Ghost is
[1:30:51] in you we'll do that we think that would
[1:30:54] defile everything that will make it sick
[1:30:57] it's gonna kick it right on out you get
[1:31:00] to the place you stop cause it's go quit
[1:31:03] and like James says if you pray enough
[1:31:08] and believe God can take away the desire
[1:31:10] then you won't have a temptation you
[1:31:14] don't have temptation unless there's a
[1:31:15] desire in you and if that's a bad desire
[1:31:18] that's what we call demons it is what it
[1:31:23] is but God's love for you he died for
[1:31:29] you even knowing how many times you were
[1:31:31] gonna fall
[1:31:33] he knew every bad thought he was gonna
[1:31:35] have it doesn't mean you don't have the
[1:31:38] Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is there to
[1:31:40] mature in you the Holy Ghost is there to
[1:31:43] grow you up so that you can be without
[1:31:46] those little baby things all right I
[1:31:50] don't want you to say I think I'm saying
[1:31:52] you ain't got it you can have it in you
[1:31:55] growing trying to bring you to maturity
[1:31:59] but you gotta allow him to do it just
[1:32:03] let go I want you to think about the
[1:32:06] world what is this world to you nothing
[1:32:08] what has it done to your other than
[1:32:10] bring the pain and sorrow
[1:32:13] disappointments at times you think oh
[1:32:16] god I'm gonna lose my mind why because
[1:32:18] of this world
[1:32:19] now there's another world Jesus came to
[1:32:23] open that portal port or for you I am
[1:32:28] the way the truth and the life he says I
[1:32:30] am that door I'm the only way of
[1:32:33] entrance if any man comin the only man
[1:32:37] gonna go to that place he must come back
[1:32:39] that's just the way it go but you know
[1:32:43] what you must realize you've been born
[1:32:44] sinless you belong to you but you've
[1:32:47] been you've been here in a place that
[1:32:48] you can't help yourself and only Jesus
[1:32:50] Christ came I know that my mother was a
[1:32:54] Christian I love the way she lived and I
[1:32:57] used to try to live her way and every
[1:33:00] time I look around I was falling on my
[1:33:01] face I didn't know nothing about no Holy
[1:33:04] Ghost and then when I found out about
[1:33:06] the Holy Ghost that scared
[1:33:08] because you know how people in out those
[1:33:11] day they felt like you had the jerk and
[1:33:12] all that kind of stuff that to say you
[1:33:14] got it and so it was scaring me you
[1:33:19] ain't got a jerk
[1:33:22] hallelujah and that's what we've done
[1:33:25] we made the holy ghost sensations and
[1:33:28] that's what we get sensations and I've
[1:33:31] been guilty of myself you know you can
[1:33:33] beat on this on the pulpit all night
[1:33:35] long until you surrender and you don't
[1:33:39] have to beat on this pulpit to surrender
[1:33:41] you can surrender right there where
[1:33:43] you're standing it's surrendering God I
[1:33:48] surrender
[1:33:49] I don't know how to surrender but I
[1:33:52] surrender is that right the Prophet God
[1:33:55] said is like trying to put y'all would
[1:33:57] put those babies you know they're trying
[1:33:59] to get him dressed
[1:34:00] you couldn't that sleeve one on and and
[1:34:02] you're trying to work that one harmony
[1:34:04] they coming your way and you're like
[1:34:06] trying to get it the other way and they
[1:34:07] going this way and but finally they they
[1:34:10] stop resisting you and and keep stealing
[1:34:13] in you could put that sweater or that
[1:34:15] jacket on then that baby gets so happy
[1:34:17] cuz they've learned something they've
[1:34:21] learned to yield to your direction and
[1:34:25] that's what God is trying to get us to
[1:34:27] do yield to his direction and not our
[1:34:30] you love the Lord
[1:34:32] [Music]
