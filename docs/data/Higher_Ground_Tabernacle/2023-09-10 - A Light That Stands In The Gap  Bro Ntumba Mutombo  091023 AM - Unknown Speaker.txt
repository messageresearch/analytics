now you may be seated for a moment I just just want to introduce and like uh dear brother Sam said this morning I come from Portland Main M uh by way of spoken word Tabernacle uh the spoken word the spoken word Tabernacle and my father is a pastor Pastor Ben Mumbo there and we've been serving in that Community maybe 20 20 something years and we've had hundreds we've had three and we're still going strong and so this morning we were I was asked to greet you thank you so much for the work that you're doing here and God bless you and don't slow down we're running a race and the race is not given to the Swift but he who endureth until the end and if I look at the time we're in the end time and you've made it this far so keep going amen amen amen for a text uh this morning I titled the message of the light that stands within the Gap there's a light that stands in the G and I pulled from the the Bible from Exodus chapter 14 and if we can all just stand up to our feet together I know I've already said a lot but let's just read this and we'll enter in so I just I it takes me a long time to put a foundation I'm new at this bear bear with me amen amen amen and when you get there just say Amen please Exodus chapter 14 we'll start from and I'm I'm going to keep skipping we'll get to where we need to go and the Lord spake unto Moses saying Speak unto the children of Israel that they turn and encamp before pyro and MD and the Sea over against Vis Bal zon the Bon before it shall encamp before before it shall ye encamp by the Sea verse four and I will harden Pharaoh's heart who will harden I that he shall follow after them and I will be honored upon pharaoh and upon all of his host that the Egyptians may know that I and the Lord and they did so the Bible describes as the 600 chariots that and everyone had a captain over them verse number eight and the Lord hardened the heart of pharaoh king of Egypt and he pursued after the children of Israel and the children of Israel went out with a high hand they went out with boldness nine it says but the Egyptians pursued after them all of the horses and Chariots of pharaoh his Horsemen and his army and overtook them en camping by the Sea beside fio and Bion verse 10 bear with me a few more verses we're almost there almost there tell your neighbor we almost there we're almost there and when Pharaoh Drew nigh the children of Israel lifted up their eyes and behold the Egyptians marched after them and they were sore afraid they were very afraid and the children of Israel Cried Out unto whoto the Lord and they said unto Moses first they cried out into the Lord but then now they say to Moses because there were no graves in Egypt no graves in right you taken us [Music] away to die in the wilderness wherefore hast thou thou dealt us with us to carry us forth out of Egypt why did you take us out amen verse 12 tell your neighbor we're almost there verse 12 it says here that is is not this the word that did that that Did we tell thee in Egypt saying let us alone that we may serve who the Egyptians Wow Wow for it had been better for us to serve the Egyptians then we should die than that we should die in the wilderness I know you know someone who's like that sometimes we just want pity all the time we're obsessed with our pain and we're obsessed with feeling down and sad but there's a deliverer in the land verse 13 we're almost there and Moses said unto the people fear ye not and stand still and see that the salvation of the Lord which he will show you today for the Egyptians whom you have seen today you shall see them again no more how long forever forever forever and the Lord shall what fight for you and what does he tell you ye shall hold your peace nothing else he doesn't say hold your anxiety doesn't say hold your pain doesn't say hold your depression hold your peace amen you may be seated in the house of the Lord and Lord we ask that you bless the word this morning speak to us Lord this is not a show this is not a spectacle we came to learn from you move the man out of the way in Jesus name we pray amen amen we're in the house of the Lord and there's liberty there's Freedom we so let me be free for a little bit so now we take a look at the children of Israel and they've Exodus they're in the Exodus to exit to exit is to leave they have left the world and they are walking towards their promise but God is God right he doesn't want anything to be easy for us just you know Easy Street we call it he sends the deliverer but then he also sends the enemy what so The God Who wants you to have a wonderful prosperous life a great life will deliver you but then send your enemy towards you but he also tells you that I'll make you a seat at the table of who of enemies so that you prosper in their face not in secret so now God the god of Heaven starts to deal with the heart of Pharaoh Pharaoh who who's who's going to build the pyramids who who's going to who's going to fight for you who's going to take care of the soldiers who's going to who's going to cut the grass who's going to run Walmart walm who's going to do that she's speaking in Pharaoh's ear just telling them all those things remember your firstborn Pharaoh aren't those the people it begins to do something in the heart and now Pharaoh is there and and he has everything he ever wants in his life but now he wants you so now his heart is hardened and then he stands up 600 chariots 600 captains left stand up stand up go get every single person there and bring them back here we have work to do whose Army are you fighting for this morning we have work to do here but God knew what he was doing he always knows what he's doing and the Bible says that I I God will harden Pharaoh's Hearts but I myself the Lord will get the glory through Pharaoh's Army and they will know that I am the Lord I was reading somewhere this writer said that the beginning of anxiety is the end of faith and the beginning of true faith is the end of anxiety what do you want so when this is taking place now the children of Israel begin to get anxious because they're they they don't understand how big God Is So if Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever if he has delivered them them from the grip of pharaoh why won't he do it again they were in captivity for 420 years 420 years and God finally delivered them God will use your enemies to show his glory but when things get a little anxious when when when things get a little difficult we we begin to get anxious we begin to take things in our own hands before we used to pray for food now we Rejoice for food stamps we the enemy has put so many substitutions in God we used to rise up in the morning for I'm immigrant so don't don't me any other way I'm an immigrant we used to rise up in the morning first thing and go fight for work nowadays we can just sit home and the government can send us a check it's easy that way but God is looking for an army what are you going to teach your children you have to stand up but now anxiety can set in our hearts we begin to take things in our own head we begin to find different programs and different things we Mo we move from City to City looking to see how we can receive the greatest benefits but have you tried Jesus he's waiting for you let go of what you're holding on to and now he's looking for you but now there's anxiety in the camp at some point they were rejoicing they were rejoicing we marching to Z beautiful Zion they were rejoicing clapping their hands [Applause] jerus all of these things they were rejoicing as they were leaving Moses W to Moses just read Mo her son am and Jed's son I knew that that God was going to be great I told you Moses I tell you I saw I knew he was going to be great they were rejoicing because they entered into the Exodus but when the trouble started to come to why don't you just let us die I love being a slave Moses they told me when to eat they told me when to sleep they gave us meat they gave us onions they gave us p and they gave us spices we ate good Moses now what do we have so now they wanted to become dependent again on the person that is making you a Slave but there is a light that stands in the middle of the so now we're as we're progressing forward God tells them to rest but as they rest they start to hear a uncertain sound coming from behind them there was Pentecost happening in the camp but behind them there was uncertain sound they could hear trumpets they could hear horses but but wait what does that sound but what did Moses do he kept his eye on the pill the cloud that led by day he didn't look left or right he kept moving forward until they came up to him and told him that and in my mind I bet you they were scared they knew Moses had anger issues if you read your Bible you know that Moses are you hey bro John are you going to tell Moses you the Egyptians are coming I thought we were free they begin to doubt their Deliverance they begin to doubt their prophet because things got a little difficult but as they're moving forward they begin to just worship because they know that God dwells in the presence of the worship and in my mind this is what I picture the elderly has walking forward the elderly were walking forward with tears in their eyes because they remember they remember captivity the younger ones were moving forward with joy but they also remember that and the young the ones who just got married freshly married they were already talking about the plans of the promis land they going do I'll work here and there that's what they'll tell this is my mind don't say it's a doctr this what going on in their minds they're making plans of their future but as the enemy approaches they begin to get anxious but God dwells in the the presence of his worship the Revival begin to die down because the enemy was coming closer and closer but it's important for us to worship and every step you take is yours it's your possession when you're not worshiping you're being stagnant it's not good to be stagnant every time you worship you have more faith to move forward move forward worship the enemy can take your freedom but he can never take your worship he can take your freedom but he can never take your worship God is worship let them take everything else world but never never take your worship cuz God is worship there's a thought that comes into my mind don't become a slave to what you see don't become a slave to what you hear because there's freedom in the name of Jesus and when God is about to move he watches us he sees you come to church on Sunday you needed a breakthrough but you come to church like this like a zombie come on zombie not zombie but zombie come come zombie dead but he wants your worship so if you're free here when you need something he's going to remember your worship he's going to give you according to your heart's desire amen amen don't lose your worship so now the children of Israel moving forward and Moses was not Disturbed at all he tells them to fear not stand still you might see your enemy today today is going to be the last day let's move forward and God spoke directly to his Prophet we're almost there tell your neighbor we're almost there still laying down Foundation and God always speaks directly to his Prophet amen amen how many believe we have a prophet just check him just check him God speaks directly to him Moses had his eyes on the cloud in the pillow of fire and the people had their eyes on the back of Moses and wherever Moses moved they moved understand what I'm saying here don't miss what I'm saying if Moses stopped here they stopped here if Moses began to worship here they worship there don't forget who Moses is brother Bram says in the message this great servant Moses in 1955 January 22nd he says Moses he was the priest he was the king and he was the lawgiver everything a type of the Lord Jesus Christ the priest the king and the lawgiver everything a type of the Lord Jesus Christ and when the Lord spoke to Moses Moses spoke to the people don't miss what I'm saying hallelujah amen don't you give your ear to a man who has not given his life totally to God especially the young sisters in the room amen amen we the church we're the bride there's people who are speaking speaking chattering but keep your eyes on the servant the TR Moses was called message why Christ speak preach in 1963 July 14 in the morning he said God had called him from Moses God had called him from his birth put qualities in him of great faith and then come down with his presence and anointed that great something in him so God created him puts the puts the qualities in him then comes down with his presence and anoints Moses and then he sends him down with his word not with Moses's word but with God's word and he brother B said he was properly a Vindicated of his claims no matter how many quacks had raised up and how many other things had happened God was speaking at oh Moses was identified Moses what Moses said God honored we're almost there tell your neighbor we're almost there what Moses said God honored I hope you understand what I'm doing I'm paralleling without paralleling don't leave your neighbor behind everything that Moses said everything that Moses said God honored that brother brandham says I want you to never forget that word what Moses said God honored why because God's word was in Moses amen amen hallu God's word was in Moses yes sir in Moses so everything Moses said it was who thank you we're almost there tell you almost there God says he speaks through it Moses and he confirmed it and the Vindicated claims in the message Witnesses brother Brenham says for I have heard the groans of their task Masters and so forth and I amen I have come down I have come down to deliver them who the Lord Brother almost there now look I have come down to deliver them but I'm sending you Moses was the Vindicated prophet of God he was the priest he was the king he was the lawgiver That's Another Brick we're building Brick by Brick here we're building a pyramid so now we're moving forward and God tells Moses to rest so what is that mean the children of Israel have to rest amen between what the sea and Pharaoh's Army Lord I thought you delivered us but look what's in front of us there's the sea and behind us is the it's the Army are we going to go into Rapture right now how else God always provides a way God knows and when ver Exodus 14:1 and it says now when Pharaoh Drew n the children of Israel lifted up their eyes they lifted up their eyes and behold the Egyptians marched after them and they were sore afraid and the children of Israel Cried Out unto the Lord and they were comfortable they were comfortable they were comfortable but God wanted them to move forward finally they recognized God and they knew in the mind of the Egyptians was more likely to kill them all or to take them and bring them back into cap never let your eyes be the judge of the promise that God has for your life your attention leads to adoration so whatever you put your eyes to whatever you put your ears to is what you begin to adore whatever you put your eyes to and ears to you begin to adore so now you wonder why you're dealing with anxiety you wonder why you're dealing with depression you wonder why you're dealing with loneliness because whatever you put your attention to begin to adore so turn your eyes to Jesus turn your eyes cuz when we pay more attention to him he will continue to lift you up we spend hours and hours and hours just head down head down like we're praying but we're just scrolling and then we wonder they effects of our actions we wonder about the effects of our actions so Jesus tells us right if our eye causes us to sin plug it out he was talking about our phones that's the prophetic because he knows the time we're going to be spending and spending and adoring and adoring and comparing comparing comparing comp comp just just comparing ourselves to our neighbors and our friends we want a better house we want a better car what about Jesus where where have you placed him in your life you spent your time on on con oh I don't know if that's even popular any you spend your time on Instagram and Facebook inst Facebook what'sapp Church what'sapp of whatsappapp yes you spend your time there and then you wonder what's going on why can't you get a promotion why why don't you have any peace because your eyes are on the wrong things turn your eyes to Jesus turn your eyes to Jesus come back to the Heart of Worship come back to the Heart of Worship if God promises to set you Free's going to set you free if God promises to heal you he's going to heal you fre if God tells you you're going to be with your children going to be with your children God tells you you're going to be together with your family you're going to be with your family turn your eyes back to Jesus because there is a light that stands in the gap of the darkness he's waiting for you he's waiting for you come back come back but you're So Satisfied because it makes your brain feel good mindless scolling scrolling ring makes us feel I I'm I'm a I'm the first one to cast the stone on myself I'm not I'm not I'm not holier than you but this was something he placed in my heart amen come back if he promises you you're going to be the head and not the tail he's faithful to Performance [Music] young man if he promises you will be a king he's preparing a queen for you ah say Amen ah young man say Amen he's preparing a queen for you I'm living proof of that amen glory hallelujah hallelujah God is faithful to perform that everything he promised he will fulfill now we're almost there tell your neighbor we're almost there if they're sleeping wake them up so now what what's taking place is that there is a mixed multitude that exits so so so the doubt is very strong within the camp it's not just Believers that are on this journey with us hello are we still awake this morning it's not just believers who are on this journey with us brother B talks about the three kind True Believers make believers nonbelievers right so these people are walking towards the promised land singing the songs of Zion they're worshiping and praising and adoring true Judas Judah scariot Scot he was a Divine healer hello hello hello hello he was in the presence of God Almighty and he was healing people healing people he was doing the work of God he slept even close to God Almighty everything he was doing was according to the gift that he was given everything but the but brother Bram says something the prophet say something he was a seed of discrepancy Google that not Google it table it tonight in the message seed of discrepancy so whatever he was doing in the presence of the Mighty God it was okay by God but as as the enemy was going around and all over the Earth are we still together the enemy has that power too all over the Earth he was looking for what he was looking for a body hello hello just the same way God is looking for a body Satan was looking for a body so now they're sitting here at the table after they take that last supper and he mentioned something whatever whoever you want to do whoever wants to do that do it now the Bible says that the spirit entered into do this the same one who was a Divine healer the same one who walked in talk with God the same one who paid the ties more than you the same one who was in church first the same one who came to the altar every day the enemy was looking for a body and if your soul is empty where is he going to go inside so you have to fill it with worship always don't dwell on your phone it just takes a moment it just takes a moment so you have no power to judge anybody because it just takes one seconds for the enemy to just enter into you have to be on your guard parents teach your children how to pray show them show them I know we have jobs I know it's hard my dad used to come home at 4: in the morning 5 in the morning after working all night bun my children walk come downstairs we come down like zombies to let's pray 4 in the morning did my dad care about our feelings at that he didn't care even if the young ones me and Jo Maybe but there was habits he was building in us there was habits he was building in us oh man me when it comes to sleep this this God's gift to sleep it's a gift it's a big gift and my dad would wake us up we sing a few songs at that time yeah like we come on Sunday mornings now that's how I was singing We're but he was building something in us so as we grew up we didn't forget we didn't forget now there's a mixed multitude tell your neighbor we're almost there there's a mixed multitude and brother Bram says this thought in hearing recognizing and acting on the word of God 1960 February 21 take take notes and read and listen to these tapes when you get a chance I promise you I'm not making this up paragraph 72 he says that whenever there is a Revival it always produces twins that's a rude remark that's but it's true when there was a birth out of Isaac and Rebecca It produced twins when the world was created It produced twins two trees and when Cain and Abel were born It produced two when ishma and Isaac was born two when Esau and Jacob was born It produced but listen what brother oh man I love this message one of them the natural of the earth and the other one supernal and one looked at the natural the intellectual and the other walked by spirit it's always been that way so now as they're leaving uh Egypt there were some who were looking at the natural and other was looking at the superal because a Revival was taking place we're almost there and in the message Redemption by power preached in 1954 March 29 don't be offended if I'm quoting the prophet I'm a young preacher I need to paragraph 116 he says Jesus said in the parable of the swer when is so went forth and sold seeds and some the enemy come around and sowed some seeds in the wheat and what did he say let them grow you're not God to judge people cuz you know someone's life outside a church if you're God raise your hand here I want to meet you thank you when when things are happening outside you pray for them you let them grow Moses knew he knew that there was a mixed multitud Pastor knows only Jesus can save and the same way he provided for you could be a way he provides for them don't speak poorly about your neighbor speak poorly about your seatmates pray for them and let them grow amen paragraph 117 brother brand says you're always pointing out how Wicked the world is a getting but you fail to see how powerful the church is getting at the same time let them grow she is rising up standing on the field oh she's a little f f but brother God is with her and she's going to Triumph just as certain as Christ Rose from let them grow God's Church shall never fail the Gates of Hell will not Prevail against it let them grow but now the children of Israel seem like there's no hope heart is full of Doubt anxiety just one more day Lord oh I thought we were free I thought we were free and Moses looked towards them and as sure as Jesus who rose from the dead thing he said was fear not Moses turns towards the congregation of two million even with the non-believers he says fear not tell your neighbor fear not brother brandham said the trouble with the church today is that it is scared to death that we're going to fail how can you fail when you're in Christ you can't fail you've got everlasting life do you believe that the fear entered the camp but Moses says fear ye not stand still and see the salvation of the Lord he didn't say read about it no sometimes we read the quotes sometimes we hear the healing we listen to the tapes we hear how the Miracles have come how brother Bram would impart that gift into the into the sanctuary and heal and heal and heal and we listen to the tape maybe raise our hand and go back to our life but Moses tells the congregation that you're going to see the salvation of the Lord and I'm telling you this morning that you're going to see the salvation of the Lord so those healings that you hear about in the it can happen right now you just have to believe you will see the salvation of the lord it's not in the past it's right now you will see the salvation of but Moses after you tell them to fear this is his conference with God Moses why are you crying Exodus 14:1 15 Ex we're almost there we're almost there mes why you cry speak speak unto the children so that they go are we reading together that they go forward 16 says but we're almost there I promise now after you spoke right build up their faith then lift up thy rod so now the children of Israel have finally put their focus back on the prophet they finally put their focus back on their King priest and their lawgiver finally so when he lifts up his hand with that rod but the brandham said that was not the rod of Moses hello hello he said that was the rod of God the rod of judgment why do you think that Rod ate the the the the snakes in that cuz God is the judge the Supreme judge and the same Rod that ate those snakes mes took it again when the children of Israel got sick and they looked at the rod again and they received their healing it's the same Rod it's not Moses but God and now Moses lifts up the rod stretch out thine hand over the sea and divide it and the children of is is shall go on dry ground through the midst of the sea on what kind of ground John what kind of ground dry dry I don't know if you guys have ever had water and sand in your hands if you get rid of all the water what do you have mud right or right but God said the ground is going to be dry what don't miss those Little Miracles God is so specific oh my dry groundy how long would it take to dry out Isaac brother Isaac Minister men of God how long would it take a long time Allelujah dry ground through the middle of the sea 17 and again God says this again and I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians so they shall follow them and I will get me honor upon pharaoh and upon all of the host all of the host all of his host upon his chariots and his Horsemen and the Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord it didn't say Moses said it didn't say so the Egyptians are recognizing something that God is Lord in the in the children of Israel are recognizing that God is Lord but they're looking at two different perspectives the children of Israel are looking at the prophet are we are we together and the Israelites are looking at the children of but who's getting the glory the lord Through The Eyes of pharaoh I will receive my glory and honor upon his chariots upon his Horsemen tell your neighbor we're almost there this is where all this inspiration came from this verse right here and the angel of God which went before the camp of Israel removed and went behind them Hallelujah and the pillar of the cloud went before their face and stood behind them what it went before their face and stood behind them wait is that possible is that possible so this this pillar of the cloud removed and went behind them and before them yes sir Amen brother Bram says in the same message uh redeeming Power by power paragraph 131 he said listen tighten up up the harness now the angel of God which went before the camp of he is still here amen amen that same angel that was with the children of Israel is still here hallelujah I believe the angel of God launch that went before the camp of Israel removed and went back behind them in the pillar of fire pill of the pill of the cloud went before their face and stood behind them he says or went up from here and stood back there a go between in the time of trouble there is a light that stands in the Gap that is the same light that is here today if you accept it if you believe brother B says in 132 paragraph 132 you're there you're there paragraph 132 we're almost there tell you we're almost there when trouble begins to face you sickness on every trouble the angel of God comes up and goes out between you and the sickness and stands there in the way every sickness there's no name didn't say cancer it didn't say sugar diabetes every sickness every sickness and it stands in the way cancer where are you going cancer where are you going and he stands in the Gap and he fights for you but he's providing a way because what's in front of the children of Israel is the sea they're still stuck but God needed to do something spectacular H it's always that last second when he shows up were there praise our God or burning the fire praise him or burning the fire we'll put you in prison for a long time they didn't stop because God is worship so every day they praised God and they prayed they fasted they didn't eat with the food that the other people ate separated themselves with the word and now when it's time puts the fire to the kill seven times harder than any time fire like no other and then he asked him just one more time bow down to me and they say no way so now as they're walking into the fire fire like no other brother Brenham says they start to talk to one another hey bro you you prayed up you prayed up a little bit of Doubt starts to enter bro did you pray last night that fire is hot but which direction did they go forward so so so the so the take a step one by one John are you sure are you sure I pray did did you pray oh Lord we need your help and as they take a step forward they enter into the K the the the furnace and what burns the people who are holding them the ropes that were on their hand burn gone finished and now God is is is sitting on his throne sitting on his throne his beard running down or whatever I don't know I can't wait to see he's sitting there on his throne and and and M abedo praising God because he knows the same God who delivered them before deliver them again do it again and again and again so now God is sitting there with his archangels the angel of the rain they they all in a conference with one another and they're about to go send the rain to calm down the fire but God says something wait wait I'm going [Applause] myself wait I'm going myself what have you done to prove your worthiness to God what can you do what can you do he said wait they could have sent the rain his son was there on the cross his skin ripped apart blood coming from from his eyes mucus saliva on his face and and and he could have sent anything down to stop it in that moment but he said wait because he was thinking about you he was thinking about you you he had you in the back of his mind he said the Angels were ready with their Spears and their swords they were ready he said wait he said wait there is only one propitiation of sin he became sin for for you he said wait be still and know that I'm [Music] God he said wait in that afternoon and one more God himself how desperate have you been have you come to that point yet in which God says himself to his angels wait I'm going myself I'm going myself wait amen the promise was still there God gave his promise to the children of Israel brother Bram say in 133 that they would go into the Land There was a million I a million probably Milli 133 coming in to pursue them and run them down and chop them down like a bunch of animals but the angel hello are we still here this morning tell your neighbor we're almost there we're almost there some of you aren't even saying that guess guess we're lost they were coming in to chop them down like en and it said but the angel but the angel of the Lord who was there to carry them to the prom carry them to the promised land rose up and and went and stood in between them and danger he's he's waiting to do that for you only believe but you got to let the non-believers grow you too focused looking at your [Music] neighbor sister did you hear about this

the way standing in between you and trouble you in trouble all of it 135 and I know he's here right now you can call me a fanatic if you want to I'm not responsible for what you say hello hello call me crazy I don't care I don't care I'm not responsible for what you say but I brother B says but I'm responsible what I say God but he who led the children of Israel but he who led the children of Israel if I have judged it right on that light that you see tonight or seen in that picture or you seen in that picture I suppose they put them out tonight that same the same God that same God is in the building now to do ex just exactly what Jesus did in that day he's here to confirm just what he did that day on Calvary when he took all of your sin when took all of your pain when he took all of

same God what what's changed about him he just changes his mask no oh God is good oh man the same God is in the building right now to do exactly what he did the angel of God is moving up to stand between us sickness to stand between us and death death where is your stingl am am can't fear that God has a funny way of bringing us to understanding him 2019 we celebrated a wonderful thing we we we use uh 2 Chronicles 2020 as the one going into 2020 going into the New Year's celebration for 2020 second 2 Chronicles 20 verse 20 February 2nd 22 222 2020 I get a phone call for my sister say hey go pick up this other sister the in the back of the phone I'm hearing my mom screaming crying like I've never heard before and I knew something was wrong it it Disturbed my spirit and and I live an hour and 30 minutes up north and I'm going to church that Sunday February 2nd 2020 and and I'm hearing the screaming and it did something to and I couldn't figure it out and I'm driving as fast as I can cuz they texted me just come home just come home on my way to church and I couldn't figure it out so I'm driving and I'm just going through just every thought in the world all all this regret all this pain and know something is wrong know it and I get home to my parents house screaming in the background and my my sister comes outside and she says am I died in a sleep my brother died and sleep 20 26 years old and his sleep peaceful but God has a funny way of showing still I was there couldn't figure I I no thoughts no emotions nothing I felt empty felt broken I didn't believe it we drove up to and I went to the room and I I saw him there his no breath nothing and it became real to me but still more we went downstairs and we prayed and we worshiped with tears coming down the enemy canot Take My Worship amen even though I witnessed that with my own eyes my best [Music] friend the enemy can't take your worship and I left there as low as I could have ever been two a week later I'm trying to drive to work a little snowstorm I'm driving up a hill my car does a 360 and then a car comes towards me and I get out of the car not even one scratch on my body because I know that God Is Watching Over Us and the enemy cannot take my wor it did not slow me down the reason why I can even hold this today is because of that pain I experience God has a funny way of making us draw closer to wow wow sometimes he breaks you sometimes he bruises you it did him good to bruise his son so that you can live if you want an anointing you need oil and how do you get oil pressing pring and now I can stand here today knowing that he is still God and I didn't lose my hope I can't even slow down I'm even going faster now he's still God and he knows your pain he knows everything you've experienc he understands all of those things and he's ready he's willing take you to the promised land only believe and verse 20 tell your neighbor we're almost there oh we're getting weaker and weaker God where's the body change you guys become younger again body change verse 20 it says and it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel and it was a cloud CL of Darkness to them to them who is it a cloud of Darkness to who are we still here to the Egyptians the same light that was a light to the Israelites was the same light that was a cloud of Darkness Egyptians because God was working on something because to separate the sea to lift the sea and to dry the ground it was going to take some time right but it gave light by night to these so that the one came not near to the other all night the Egyptians couldn't see anything but the light was shining in the evening time the light shall come so the same light that you see through this Revelation you can read these words you can listen to the tape and it does something to you but someone else can listen to these words and listen to the tape Darkness cuz in the evening time the light will come God is not the author of confusion God will bring Darkness to the enemies who was chasing after you and create separation with the same light you have the light walk in the light beautiful light Jesus the light of the world so you march forward you march forward and 21 and Moses stretched out his hand over the sea and who the Lord again sometimes people have confusion between brother Brandon being God we have people have a confusion on that but he's working through the Propet everything the prophet said was God although Moses stretched his hand out the Lord is still doing all the work and the Lord caused the sea to go back to be pushed back by a strong East Wind and made the sea dry land and the waters were divided tell your neighbor we're almost there and the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon dry ground and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand and on their left and the Egyptians 23 and the Egyptians puru and went in after them into the midst of the sea all of Pharaoh's horses all of his chariots and Horsemen and 24 and it came to pass that in the morning watch the Lord looked unto the host of Egyptian through what the what through the pillow of fire god was looking through the pillar of fire I'm more excited than you you he was looking through the pillar of the and of the cloud and then he troubled the host of the Egyptians again again and he troubled the army of the Egyptians again 25 and took off their Chariot so what they were using to get the [Music] Israelites God God himself took off the wheels of the Egyptian what so God tells Moses go freeze the freeze the Israelites freeze the isra he hardens the heart of pharaoh tells pharaoh go after them Pharaoh goes after them 600 chariots and then he takes the wheels off the Chari man you see how easy it is for God don't put these things in your hand let God be God he's fighting for you am he's fighting for you let's go tell your neighbor woman there and and and that they drave them heavily so the Egyptians said let us flee from the face of Israel what let us flee from the face where's the face in the front in the what how they seeing a face go read tonight for the Lord exactly what God had promised to do this is the words of the Egyptians this is a direct quote Exodus 1425 I don't have the year I don't have the year but they say to one another let us flee from the face amen for the Lord for the Lord fight for them against the Egyptian amen amen every single device that the enemy has used to harm [Music] you and separate you from the love of God will be crushed every single weapon you have to just come to a place of belief only belief you can be between the Sea and the Egyptians but God always provides a way Amen brother Bram says God has made a way for us God loves his children he loves his people he wants to help them he wants to help you more than you want help if you can just get that in your heart that God is more willing to help you out more than yourself tell your neighbor we're almost there we're almost there we're almost there but he has a way and that's the only way that he will work is through his way there is only one way brother brandham says You must come to his terms not your terms but his terms amen amen amen back to verse 26 we're almost there I promise I've been saying that for an hour and the Lord who the Lord said unto Moses stretch out thine hand over the sea again so this is not Moses it's not the prophet that was doing these things hello hello God needed his vessel he he used him for his glory Turn Your Eyes Upon him now this direct connection 5G ultrawide yeah 5G 5 5G good connection oh 5G con 5G Hallelujah and he tells him direct [Music] Moses stretch out your hand again because the people needed to see the man hello oh we're almost there they needed to see the man so he said stretch your hand over the waters may come uh uh that the waters may come up again upon the Egyptians upon their chariots upon their horses and what did Moses do and when Moses received the word from God he stretched out his hand over the sea and the Sea returned to his strength when what the morning appeared so this might have been all night all night long God was keeping those walls up but when the S began to shine s s n yep when it began to shine the Egyptians fled against it and the Lord who the Lord overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea amen somebody amen amen somebody amen ah 28 and the waters returned and covered the Chariots and the horsemen and the host of pharaoh God got rid of all the evidence all the evidence you wouldn't even know that there were Egyptians and everyone that came after everyone that came after you God will just get rid of all the evidence clean but the people needed to see a body so not even one survived the Bible says and 29 it says here but the children of Israel walked upon dry land in the middle of the sea and the waters were a wall on the right hand and left in conclusion verse 30 we're almost there tell it was getting weak we the Lord verse 30 thus the Lord who the Lord saved Israel that day out of the hands of the Egyptians and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the sea 31 and Israel saw the great work which the Lord did upon the Egyptians and people feared the Lord and believed the Lord and his servant Moses amen they believed and feared the Lord and and his servant Moses amen God is still working he's still moving he's still proving himself this very day this is what happen we have to take on the whole armor of God and the Bible says when the enemy comes in like a FL God will raise up the standard against it says in Eden he gave them his word for their armor just the word spoke then the enemy came in in like a flood and he took the word and made it flesh amen 62701 write this down listen to tonight or sometime the enemy came in like a flood paragraph 112 and he took the word so God took the word and he made it flesh from up God was up there speaking this
