[0:07] first time I've ever come here amen and
[0:10] only one sister is
[0:12] here we thank God for sister Aaron
[0:15] pressing it on
[0:17] sister well I'm glad we got them back
[0:19] from Alaska they act like they wanted to
[0:21] stay up there
[0:24] so amen amen you love the Lord amen let
[0:28] us turn by the grace of God to uh Psalms
[0:32] 40 and then acts
[0:36] 7 Psalm 40 and acts
[0:50] 7 we're just going to read Psalm 40
[0:55] And1 and
[0:58] two I waited patiently for the Lord and
[1:02] He inclined unto me and heard My
[1:06] Cry he brought me up also out of a
[1:09] horrible pit out of the myy clay and set
[1:14] my feet upon a rock and establish my
[1:19] goings
[1:20] am let's go to the third verse that's
[1:22] real good all of it is
[1:25] good and he had put a new song in my
[1:29] mouth amen even praise unto our God many
[1:33] shall see it and fear and shall trust in
[1:37] the Lord amen you love the Lord amen let

[1:52] please tonight we're just going to work
[1:55] in a uh subject on
[1:58] prayer uh uh this is the hour that we're
[2:01] living in and I believe this year is
[2:03] going to require more prayer than
[2:05] ever I believe with all my heart that's
[2:08] what will cause a people to be
[2:12] translated the communication that they
[2:14] will have with God In Prayer is when
[2:17] they will receive secrets from God that
[2:20] no one else will receive you know it's
[2:22] amazing because a lot of time people
[2:24] don't know that that's where God reveals
[2:27] himself in the secret closet
[2:30] amen it is a thing that I know that is
[2:33] required and I really believe that is
[2:35] why so many people fail and come short
[2:38] but the Bride of Jesus Christ feel the
[2:40] urgency she knows amen she's got to talk
[2:43] with him more now than ever amen de love
[2:46] the Lord acts 7 and
[2:50] 34 acts
[2:53] 734 we'll
[2:58] read I have seen
[3:01] I have seen the Affliction of my people
[3:03] which is in Egypt and I have heard their
[3:07] groaning and have come down to deliver
[3:10] them and now come I will send uh thee
[3:14] into
[3:15] Egypt and this Moses whom they refused
[3:19] saying who is made thee a ruler and a
[3:21] judge the same did God send to be a
[3:24] ruler and a deliverer by the hand of the
[3:27] Angel which appeared to him in the
[3:30] bush he brought them out after that he
[3:33] had showed wonders and signs in the land
[3:36] of Egypt and in the Red Sea and in the
[3:39] wilderness 40 years this is that Moses
[3:44] which said unto the children of Israel a
[3:46] prophet shall the Lord your God raise up
[3:49] unto you or of your brethren like unto
[3:53] me here uh excuse me him shall ye hear
[3:57] amen
[3:59] let us pray father God we come before
[4:02] you Lord Jesus as humbly as we know how
[4:05] we thank you for your goodness we thank
[4:06] you for your grace surely Lord you've
[4:09] been better to us than we've been to
[4:11] ourselves and we pray this evening that
[4:13] you would break and destroy the yolks of
[4:15] the enemy I pray father that you would
[4:17] give us a heart to hear and to receive
[4:21] Lord not the heart and I that not the
[4:24] heart in our head but the heart in our
[4:26] hearts Lord oh God I pray right now that
[4:29] you would just have that perfect will
[4:30] here tonight though be a few Lord we
[4:33] know that you are here because you

[4:47] flesh Lord and we'll be careful to give
[4:49] you the praise Glory and Honor in Jesus
[4:52] Christ's name we pray amen amen you may
[4:56] be seated
[5:01] amen as I said by the grace of God I
[5:04] believe with all of my heart amen that
[5:07] this is the year of prayer if you would
[5:11] turn with me amen also to Psalm
[5:14] 27:14 amen Psalm
[5:17] 27:14 we we we really see the world
[5:20] falling apart people don't know what to
[5:23] do uh but the bride amen you know all of
[5:26] this confusion that's going on yet
[5:30] in the midst of it all God has a bride
[5:33] that is being
[5:34] revived a amen I believe with all of my
[5:37] heart amen she is coming to a place
[5:39] where she is totally dependent upon
[5:42] Jesus Christ she have denied herself and
[5:45] she's trusting in the almighty God who
[5:48] promised that he would bring her to a
[5:51] Perfection amen that's where I'm at
[5:54] that's where I am today I realize by the
[5:56] grace of God there's nothing that I can
[5:58] do I've tried tried so many times to
[6:01] live it Hallelujah I've tried so many
[6:04] times to make it happen amen but I
[6:07] realize amen that I can't do it the only
[6:10] way that it can ever happen is that I
[6:12] have the God who made it happen on the
[6:15] inside of me and he is the lifegiving
[6:18] source amen now here we find out in
[6:21] Psalm 27 which I always love this
[6:24] chapter because it is the rapture
[6:25] chapter
[6:27] amen amen here the the 14th verse it
[6:30] says wait on the Lord be of good courage
[6:34] and he shall strengthen thine heart wait
[6:38] I say on the Lord now watch what it says
[6:42] in the 13th verse I had fainted unless I
[6:46] had believed to see the goodness of the
[6:48] Lord in the land of the living and I'm
[6:52] going tell you what amen I could truly
[6:53] say last year 13 perhaps that was my my
[6:57] what I was had I not known and had had
[6:59] not seen I would have
[7:01] fainted now maybe y'all don't know what
[7:03] I'm talking about but by the grace of
[7:05] God Amen we all come to that point God
[7:08] has to give us something Amen to keep us
[7:11] moving by the grace of God and I don't
[7:14] know how difficult 203 was for you but
[7:17] it was very difficult for me but by the
[7:19] grace of God God gave me something if I
[7:22] had been going by my own strength I
[7:24] would have fainted Hallelujah come on
[7:26] somebody it was just that tough but God
[7:29] brought us through is that all right
[7:32] amen I tell you what I don't know why
[7:34] people aren out here tonight I know some
[7:36] can't come because of the roads and all
[7:38] but my the first year the first service
[7:40] on the first the first my goodness I
[7:42] thought this is pretty good but by the
[7:44] grace of God I want to end it the same
[7:47] way but y'all know what I'm saying and
[7:49] everybody couldn't make it don't get me
[7:50] wrong but it is a blessing to be in the
[7:53] house of the Lord
[7:54] amen so when you come and you look at
[7:56] these things and you say to yourself
[7:59] amen by the grace of God I am so blessed
[8:01] now I said this once before and I think
[8:04] I said this be prior to my leaving you
[8:06] know when uh when Jesus was feeding the
[8:09] disciples uh uh and he said unto them
[8:12] except you eat my flesh and drink my
[8:14] blood amen you have no life in you amen
[8:18] you know many times throughout the years
[8:21] amen the world the church World attacked
[8:24] this message in so many ways but now is
[8:27] attacking the Flesh of the message
[8:31] the bloody bleeding word is that right
[8:33] but the prophet of God said it was
[8:35] during that time that God slowed up the
[8:37] Miracles amen so that he could teach
[8:40] them yes amen see in other words what is
[8:43] happening now has been such a blessing
[8:46] for the True Believer because it
[8:48] anchored them it literally made them
[8:51] grip the solid rock y'all hear what I'm
[8:53] saying because then Jesus turned to him
[8:56] during the time he was teaching them eat
[8:57] the Flesh and drink the blood right and
[9:00] he said except you eat the Flesh and
[9:02] drink this Blood you will have no part
[9:05] of me is that right and then he turned
[9:08] to Peter after 70 turn he says will you
[9:11] go too Peter said no sir how can I turn
[9:15] amen how could I leave this amen when
[9:17] your words are the words to eternal life
[9:21] your words only you only have the words
[9:24] to eternal life and so that grips that
[9:28] bride and anchors her in and say where
[9:30] can I go I can't go on the B Because
[9:33] amen he produced chickens forgive me
[9:35] Lord amen amen I can't go under no other
[9:39] what other Ministry you know that can
[9:41] feed you like this one and promise you
[9:44] eternal
[9:46] life bringing you to a transformation
[9:49] it's not some figment of our imagination
[9:52] we see ourselves growing and moving from
[9:55] glory to glory it might be moving slowly
[9:59] but it's moving
[10:00] amen
[10:01] hallelujah now when we talk about an
[10:04] exodus and and we're working with
[10:06] somewhat Exodus because you've got not
[10:08] only to come out of Le the seia but you
[10:11] must go into Christ is that right so
[10:14] it's a spiritual spiritual thing Amen in
[10:17] the beginning the first Exodus was a
[10:19] natural to a natural then a spiritual to
[10:21] the Holy Ghost and from the Holy Ghost
[10:23] to the Eternal land is that all right so
[10:26] this is the Third Exodus that we're now
[10:29] experiencing but you must receive the
[10:31] Holy Ghost in order to go Eternal amen
[10:34] it is the only way of escape this is the
[10:37] only generation that have truly been
[10:39] promised a
[10:41] Rapture is that right we have been
[10:44] promised a translation even as
[10:47] Enoch Hallelujah of all ages we are the
[10:51] only age that can truly walk with God
[10:54] outside of Enoch Hallelujah because we'
[10:56] got the whole body the whole word amen
[11:00] and now we're walking with Christ little
[11:03] by little little by little and whether
[11:06] you understand it or not as you walk you
[11:09] are ascending amen
[11:13] hallelujah now look at this thing
[11:16] because amen he says here God is making
[11:18] ready to fulfill his Divine promise
[11:19] remember with Moses he was now making
[11:22] ready to fulfill his Divine promised
[11:25] word that he had give to Abraham and
[11:27] Isaac and Jacob now
[11:29] years amen hundreds of years had
[11:33] passed come on somebody 400 years had
[11:38] passed and yet you still had
[11:41] Believers looking for The Exodus is that
[11:44] right amen but yet God never amen forgot
[11:49] his promise in the season the due time
[11:53] God always make his promise right amen
[11:57] see we don't have to worry about it cuz
[11:59] we we didn't promise he did amen is that
[12:02] right but it is a time where you and I
[12:04] must oh I realized today amen or
[12:08] yesterday or whenever it was amen I
[12:09] thought Lord I've got to get put some
[12:11] more time into prayer amen you know I'm
[12:14] praying but I got to put more time into
[12:16] it amen because realize amen that that's
[12:19] where God is
[12:20] talking I was I was laying on my bed
[12:23] taking a nap today and this is God gave
[12:25] me this particular message so I hope and
[12:27] trust well I know those of you who are
[12:29] here you'll be blessed by it
[12:31] amen listen therefore you can rest
[12:34] assured that God has promised in this
[12:36] Bible he's going to do it just no need
[12:39] of trying to think anything else and say
[12:41] well the prophet was and maybe was wrong
[12:44] or that couldn't happen in this day look
[12:46] almost impossible then more impossible
[12:49] than it does now but God did it anyhow
[12:52] because he promised he would do it now
[12:55] is that right it look more listen oh I
[12:59] think about it we can read it we can
[13:01] look at the Ten Commandments and yet and
[13:03] still we don't know how difficult it
[13:04] really
[13:05] was can you imagine a man in Exile
[13:10] coming back risking his life of being
[13:13] immediately thrown in jail but you know
[13:15] what they were so powerful they said
[13:17] this man is insane Hallelujah they had
[13:20] to and Moses come with the orders of God
[13:24] Amen right now wh watch this because God
[13:28] had to take 40 years to prepare him amen
[13:33] 40 years to beat out all that Egypt put
[13:36] in him amen think about it most of us
[13:40] haven't even been 40 years in this
[13:41] message that's why amen he's got to
[13:43] double it up on
[13:45] us he's got to Beat It All Out Of Us in
[13:49] order for us to PR to prepare us for
[13:52] this
[13:55] Exodus one thing I love about it is
[13:58] because
[13:59] uh where I read I think I read uh acts
[14:02] didn't I read acts amen and he says uh
[14:04] God comes along he says but you see I've
[14:06] come down because I've heard their
[14:09] groanings you know what groanings mean
[14:11] to utter something you know when you
[14:13] uttering your groanings you are in pain
[14:16] and grief you know you're not at the at
[14:18] the at the uh uh kneeling in prayer and
[14:22] just rejoicing this is a different kind
[14:24] of prayer it's like giving birth to
[14:26] something you know you're groaning
[14:28] you're Mourning you you're in pain
[14:30] because you realize amen there's
[14:32] something that you need God to do oh
[14:35] I've got something good if y'all don't
[14:37] mind me reading a little bit because
[14:38] I'll be doing a lot of reading and
[14:40] you've heard me say many times that this
[14:41] is a time that we've got to prepare for
[14:44] war in time of peace I wish that was my
[14:46] original quote but it's not but
[14:49] nevertheless by the God by the grace of
[14:51] God you've got to prepare this is your
[14:54] time this is your opportunity you know
[14:57] the enemy is coming because we have a
[15:00] prophecy
[15:02] amen I was telling the church uh over
[15:05] there in Ohio I said let me tell you
[15:07] something if you listen to commercials
[15:09] and the news and things like that God
[15:11] will speak to you right I forgot what
[15:13] phone company that is talking about
[15:15] bundling right and you knock on the door
[15:18] and and and and they trying to introduce
[15:20] this bundling to you and you say but we
[15:22] don't bundle right and what happened
[15:24] they turned their backs on you and said
[15:26] well you're not welcome in this
[15:27] community that's what they're saying
[15:29] right and that's exactly what time we're
[15:31] living in when you tell somebody I'm not
[15:33] an organization denomination they turn
[15:36] their backs on you no we don't
[15:39] bundle Hallelujah come on somebody you
[15:42] look at this thing and brother here it
[15:44] was amen uh we we missed the inspiration
[15:48] here and I don't mean no har there's a
[15:49] lot of things about the president I
[15:51] don't like what he doing amen but he's
[15:53] ordained to do it that's right come on
[15:55] somebody he can't do no more than what
[15:57] he's doing even seduces must wax worse
[15:59] and worse Hallelujah but one thing he
[16:02] was inspired to say we're bringing a
[16:04] change Hallelujah and if you can realize
[16:08] that God is speaking whenever the devil
[16:10] says something if you listen you revert
[16:13] you take it back into a spiritual realm
[16:15] and you'll catch what he's saying amen
[16:17] amen right because he's averal he says
[16:20] the truth he tells a lie but it's the
[16:22] truth turned around amen so anyway a
[16:26] change and we realize amen okay we
[16:29] recognize the change the change is that
[16:31] we're coming fully now into a one world
[16:34] order Pro prophet of God called it a a
[16:37] dictatorship he said way back then
[16:40] America had come into a military
[16:43] dictatorship Hallelujah and we are now
[16:46] at the Harvest of this
[16:49] dictatorship right we were talking with
[16:51] some of the people there in Alaska they
[16:53] got the they got the places built
[16:56] already for those who will refuse to
[16:59] Mark already ready here in America they
[17:02] got ovens over there in Ohio folks the
[17:06] spirit of Hitler is on
[17:09] America and people don't see it
[17:12] Hallelujah but it was those wise Jews
[17:15] that escaped the Holocaust they saw it
[17:18] coming they got out of the places but
[17:21] those people who thought they could
[17:22] mingle with everything else and saved
[17:24] everything and of course there were some
[17:26] who weren't weren't monetarily able to
[17:29] move but those who could they did y'all
[17:32] hear what I'm saying but in this change
[17:35] you and I must recognize you can't save
[17:37] your life buying gold and buying this
[17:40] and buying that the Bible say if you
[17:42] don't take the mark you will not be able
[17:44] to buy or sell they don't care if you
[17:47] got gold they don't care if you got
[17:49] silver they don't care what you have the
[17:52] point is if you don't humble to the
[17:54] system you will be exiled from the
[17:57] system Hallelujah y hear what I'm saying
[18:00] oh come on somebody so you got to know
[18:02] what you know that you know that you
[18:04] know
[18:06] am amen I heard him say on the Third
[18:09] Exodus today he said everybody that Mr
[18:12] Rapture will take the mark now I don't
[18:14] know how that works out when it comes to
[18:16] the to the white Throne judgment but he
[18:18] said everybody that don't take the mark
[18:22] of God will take the mark of the
[18:24] beast woo Jesus have mercy Lord listen
[18:29] he says now I am come down to deliver
[18:31] them out of the land of Egypt and to
[18:34] bring them up out of that land into a
[18:37] good land see so he took them out of
[18:39] Egypt to bring them into a good land now
[18:42] why did it take 40 years for them to get
[18:45] there hey that's right unbelief amen and
[18:50] murmuring and complaining about the
[18:53] leadership oh Lord hey glory to God
[18:57] hallelujah come on somebody that's what
[18:59] they did and they failed to see it was
[19:02] God who was doing the
[19:05] leading it wasn't Moses that caused the
[19:08] the the land to dry
[19:10] up God LED them that
[19:14] way Hallelujah is that okay amen and God
[19:18] sent down a little bit of Mana for him
[19:20] amen amen and then they weren't happy
[19:23] with that the message is just too simple
[19:27] we need some deep stuff we need some
[19:30] meat and God gave him the meat and what
[19:34] did it do make him
[19:35] sick oh Lord have mercy did it save them
[19:39] no sir they ate all that meat and still
[19:41] died in the
[19:42] wilderness look at them now look at them
[19:45] now people don't even know how to pray
[19:47] no
[19:48] more listen he says I'm going to be with
[19:51] you certainly and I'll be with you my my
[19:54] never never failing presence will be
[19:57] with you wherever you go don't be afraid
[19:59] I'm coming down to deliver I'm sure the
[20:02] spiritual mind catches that so if he
[20:04] told them in Exodus I'm come down to
[20:07] deliver what do you think the mighty
[20:08] Angel did on in Revelations 10 amen what
[20:11] do you think that Mighty Angel come down
[20:13] to do what he put one land uh foot on
[20:16] the land one on the sea he come right
[20:18] down to do what deliver his people amen
[20:21] no matter where they were amen no matter
[20:24] where you are God come to deliver you
[20:26] say oh brother he come to yes he's come
[20:28] to deliver you and me am it doesn't
[20:31] matter God promised that he said he
[20:34] would oh my but he does it in such a
[20:37] simple way amen hallelujah he does it in
[20:41] such a simple way the people don't even
[20:43] recognize what is he doing now he had
[20:45] done all those Miracles all those
[20:47] exploits there in Egypt but there was
[20:49] one thing the Egyptian missed if they
[20:53] could have stopped the people from
[20:55] putting the blood on the door Post in
[20:56] the little they would have wck
[21:00] Israel they would have gotten it
[21:02] Hallelujah they would have all
[21:05] died if they had understood the
[21:07] importance of the blood
[21:10] W glory to God but they couldn't see the
[21:12] importance of that Lamb's blood but
[21:15] Israel knew the importance of the Lamb's
[21:17] blood the bride know the importance of
[21:20] the Lamb's blood and she will place it
[21:23] on the doorpost of her heart she doesn't
[21:26] care because she realized that the Death
[21:29] Angel is
[21:30] coming see they think they got it but
[21:33] you see you got to have a lamb without
[21:34] sprinkling we got to have a lamb without
[21:37] spot and you look at the denominations
[21:39] come on somebody the organization look
[21:41] at the
[21:44] lamb oh help us Lord help us Lord help
[21:47] us Lord that was the victory that was

[23:48] a book of Acts he give us the Holy
[23:50] Spirit to lead us and guide us he give
[23:52] us a land and why are we out of it well
[23:54] why is the church out of it why is it
[23:57] the great Christian Church today living
[23:59] again like the book of Acts bringing
[24:01] forth the same thing there's some
[24:03] reasons for it we know that we broke up
[24:06] and we're in a terrible condition and
[24:08] the most terrible condition that the
[24:09] Christianity has ever lived in is today
[24:12] and we're on right on the brink or on
[24:15] the brink of a great terrific judgment
[24:17] laying for the church and before his
[24:19] judgment can happen God's calling an
[24:21] exodus just like he did
[24:23] then the amorites sins were heaped up so
[24:27] he's calling a SP spiritual Exodus now
[24:30] is that all right amen and let me tell
[24:32] you something it's heaped up it's heaped
[24:35] up amen you got to realize by the grace
[24:38] of God Amen you think to yourself can
[24:40] this country or can this nation ever go
[24:42] any further yes and it will by the grace
[24:45] of God but
[24:46] oh my the full Judgment of God will
[24:50] strike them amen when they come after
[24:52] his
[24:52] bride you don't trust you don't touch my
[24:55] people now is that right you don't touch
[24:57] my people amen amen and that's what the
[25:00] world don't understand they hate us now

[25:05] that thing is really going stronger and
[25:07] stronger and stronger and I'm going tell
[25:09] you something even organizations and
[25:11] denominationalism they hate a True
[25:13] Believer you know what they say you
[25:15] don't have to do all that that ain't all
[25:18] necessary that's the that's for the Old
[25:20] Testament when God called you to dress a
[25:23] certain way or act a certain way God
[25:25] don't require for us to do that now but
[25:27] that's what they told me and I believed
[25:28] him for a
[25:30] season Hallelujah but something on the
[25:33] inside wouldn't let me rest I knew amen
[25:36] that somehow God was uh calling me to a
[25:39] higher calling so are

[26:23] judgment according to what's on your
[26:25] heart amen oh help me Jesus help me Lord
[26:30] Romans 8:26 says likewise the spirit
[26:32] also helpeth our infirmities for we know
[26:35] not what we should pray for as we ought
[26:38] but the spirit itself maketh
[26:40] intercession for us with groanings which
[26:42] cannot be uttered have you ever been
[26:43] there that's when you know you're
[26:44] praying hallelujah amen all of a sudden
[26:47] the spirit of God just takes over and
[26:49] just groan you think Lord what's go he
[26:51] just groaning he's making words that you
[26:53] don't know nothing about he's telling
[26:56] God things amen that he don't want
[26:57] nobody else to hear
[27:00] hallelujah hallelujah I'm telling you

[27:19] light prayers and we think we
[27:22] prayed many times we've just amen
[27:25] uttered words and there was no there was
[27:27] no death to it there was no real feeling
[27:30] or you know when you're talking with
[27:31] somebody God God is a god of feeling
[27:34] right he he wants some depth to it amen
[27:36] and when you can get into the Holy
[27:37] Spirit listen let me tell you something
[27:39] when Jesus Christ went to the Garden of
[27:41] Gethsemane he didn't say a like prayer
[27:43] he knew his judgment his trials was
[27:45] coming this this thing that was going to
[27:47] come upon him and he knew it wasn't
[27:49] going to like prayer wasn't going to do
[27:52] it amen hello you hear what I'm saying
[27:54] he prayed amen he come back three times
[27:58] can can't can't you pray with me one

[28:27] you something something isn't that like
[28:29] us often time we get down to pray and we
[28:32] get back up and our will is still
[28:34] living it's when you got to get back
[28:37] down until something comes and touch you

[28:42] strengthened
[28:44] him but you got to have something
[28:46] something got to come forth amen listen
[28:48] that's why the Bible said in 1
[28:49] Thessalonians 5:17 pray without
[28:52] ceasing that means no
[28:55] intermission Hallelujah the more I can
[28:57] think about prayer the more I'm going to

[41:11] and then she just bent down but
[41:13] understand this lady was in excruciating
[41:15] pain when she pressed through that crowd
[41:17] God don't ever make it easy for
[41:19] you and she was an excruciating pain she
[41:22] had been bleeding for 12 years she
[41:24] should have been dead
[41:27] and you know she was weak and thin right
[41:30] had to have been you you you you see and
[41:33] and here she was going through mipos
[41:35] whatever it was but she had tried every
[41:38] kind of physan there was and there was
[41:39] nothing that could satisfy her and she
[41:41] presses through the crowd press now you
[41:44] got to realize what a crowd is like
[41:47] right if you can imagine amen what what
[41:49] it would be on a night you know like you

[41:53] people get stomped and trampled and all
[41:55] that kind of stuff and it was a crowd
[41:57] amen that would perhaps difficult to
[41:59] press through but God allowed her the
[42:00] strength to press through to Touch the
[42:03] Hem of His
[42:05] Garment how she didn't get knocked over
[42:08] steel I don't know because she had to be
[42:12] down in order to touch the him right now
[42:16] here she touches his him and he looks
[42:19] around and says who touched me his
[42:21] disciples think he's crazy because
[42:23] everybody's throwning him impressing him
[42:25] but he said virtue
[42:29] right and this lady amen must she had to
[42:31] been praying she had believed she had a
[42:33] full Assurance without one word of
[42:37] scripture if I could just touch the Hy
[42:40] of His Garment I know I'll be made whole

[42:45] protocol there was nothing amen that was
[42:47] telling her if you you you know you know

[42:58] God Amen she moved amen and she touched
[43:02] to him and was made whole let me tell
[43:04] you something she didn't need somebody
[43:05] to tell her that some a faith dropped in
[43:08] her and she believed it and God gave it

[43:57] know God has given me the great Victory
[43:59] to do it amen amen you know it's
[44:01] wonderful prayer is really wonderful
[44:03] it's not like you talking to yourself
[44:05] you speaking to God and you know what if
[44:07] you listen he'll talk back to you how
[44:10] many times God has talk oh I was looking
[44:12] for a scripture people I was looking for
[44:14] a scripture and God been talking to me
[44:18] talking to me today and I'm I'm I'm
[44:20] looking in the scripture today in my
[44:22] back office for something else and I
[44:23] looked over to the left hand side and
[44:25] there was my answer
[44:27] right in the scripture right in the
[44:30] scripture here God directed me amen I
[44:33] thought I was looking for one thing he
[44:34] knew exactly where it's in
[44:36] me I love that I love that amen Hebrews
[44:44] 4:16 let us therefore come boldly into
[44:47] the throne of grace that we may obtain
[44:49] mercy and find Grace to help in time of
[44:51] need see so if we don't go and seek God
[44:55] for this help it's our own
[44:59] thought anybody need from God here
[45:02] hallelujah I do I need more of him I
[45:05] want to be just like him I I want to die
[45:07] completely to my thoughts my ways my
[45:09] actions my
[45:12] everything come on somebody I I know I'm
[45:14] not the only person well amen if if God
[45:17] had not laid something in you and I we
[45:20] would quit long time ago that's why
[45:22] people backslab because they God haven't
[45:25] haven't anchored them in there amen but
[45:29] when God anchor you amen nothing can
[45:31] turn you around because you can see the
[45:33] Finish Line
[45:40] amen I've been Ching myself I'm sorry
[45:43] I'm not sorry I'm enjoying myself
[45:46] Hebrews 11:6 amen but without faith it's
[45:50] impossible to please him for he that
[45:51] cometh to God must believe that he is
[45:54] and that he is a reward of them that
[45:55] don't seek him now we got to understand
[45:58] he is God and he is a rewarder if you
[46:01] seek Him He will reward you that's what
[46:03] he's saying but your faith contacting
[46:07] God brings the results your faith
[46:11] contacting God brings the results in
[46:14] other words Lord if you don't if you
[46:16] don't come on the scene I'll die right
[46:17] here I ain't going nowhere until somehow
[46:20] we bring this thing together right
[46:23] that's when you really get something
[46:25] from God Amen you got to really really
[46:27] believe that he was wounded for your
[46:28] transgressions you got to believe that
[46:30] he was bruised for your iniquity you got
[46:32] to believe he come to deliver you if he
[46:34] saved you that means he come to deliver
[46:36] you amen cuz that's all part of the
[46:39] Salvation plan save Deliverance heal all
[46:43] of that is in the atonement every bit of
[46:45] it and if he can save you which is more
[46:47] difficult than healing
[46:49] you amen healing is the easy part come
[46:53] on that's just in your flesh
[46:57] uh uh but saving is in your soul he got
[46:59] to go to the third Court to get that
[47:02] Hallelujah and if God can save you he
[47:04] can heal you he can deliver you amen
[47:07] he's done it amen he's already done it
[47:10] and that's the thing we got to recognize
[47:11] he's already done it talking about
[47:14] sincere prayer and I'm going to move on
[47:16] but sincere prayer you talk about 2
[47:18] Kings 20 and5 where he Hezekiah set his
[47:21] face to the wall and says Lord save me I
[47:24] don't want to die you know what I mean
[47:26] you think Hezekiah was up there doing
[47:28] some rosaries or
[47:30] something he was sincerely praying and I
[47:33] believe he really prayed right he prayed
[47:37] and he prayed and he prayed till he
[47:38] touched God and God dispatched the
[47:40] prophet said go on tell H I'm gonna give
[47:42] him 15 more years and he's different
[47:45] from
[47:47] me when I'm ready I want him to take it
[47:50] right on don't wait no not even a second
[47:54] longer come on somebody I I what what
[47:56] about all your family I'll meet them on
[47:58] the other side that's all I say I ain't
[48:00] jeopardizing nothing hezeki got 15 more
[48:04] years and 15 more years he got in
[48:06] trouble right I don't want to jeopardize
[48:09] God knows the perfect time to take me at
[48:12] his timing is when I want to go amen
[48:15] amen now here we go because I'm going
[48:18] tell you A True Believer by the grace of
[48:20] God I'm almost done people Psalms
[48:23] 3513 uh which is a a real good scripture
[48:27] cuz we're not here praying just for
[48:29] ourselves if you can't pray for your
[48:31] enemy you need the Holy Ghost amen
[48:34] Psalms
[48:35] 35:13 but as for me when they were sick
[48:39] my clothing was sackcloth I humbled my
[48:42] soul with fasting and my prayers return
[48:44] into my own bosom I behaved myself as
[48:47] though he had been my friend or brother
[48:50] I bowed down heavily as one that moured
[48:53] for his mother now that's deep but but
[48:56] in my adversities they rejoice and
[48:59] gather themselves together yay the
[49:01] objects gather the objects gathered
[49:05] themselves together against me and I
[49:07] knew it not they did tear me and ceased
[49:10] not but he understood they were his
[49:12] enemy and he still prayed with them
[49:15] regardless to how they treated him now
[49:18] that's a real real Christian is that all
[49:21] right but I'm going to show you what
[49:22] Collective prayer do will do if we
[49:25] really come together you know sometimes
[49:26] we come to together prayer even on
[49:28] Thursday but you know I don't know how
[49:30] much prayer we're praying and how much
[49:32] we praying prayer you understand what
[49:35] I'm saying how sincere really is because
[49:38] when I see what they did on in the book
[49:40] of Acts the Bible said and uh when they
[49:42] prayed at midnight Paul and Silas prayed
[49:45] and sang Praises unto God and the
[49:47] prisoners heard them heard them now
[49:50] heard them right and suddenly there was
[49:54] a great earthquake so that the
[49:57] foundation the prison were shaken and
[49:59] immediately all the doors were open and
[50:01] every one bands were loose now now they
[50:05] prayed they they weren't praying they
[50:07] prayed and they sang and they worship
[50:09] and they prayed and they sang and they
[50:11] worship so much so it touched heaven and
[50:14] Heaven come down and shook the place now
[50:16] that's real prayer amen what about that
[50:19] prayer when Peter and was in jail they
[50:21] came together and they prayed all of a
[50:24] sudden the whole Angel dispatched
[50:26] himself and there Peter out the door the
[50:28] gate swung open without a right that's
[50:31] prayer same God Amen same God same God
[50:37] but somehow those people knew how to
[50:39] enter into a place that just seemed like
[50:42] we're just not doing
[50:45] it we ritual ritualistic say things but
[50:49] God is looking for somebody to get Ri
[50:51] down in there till if they their heart
[50:54] explode they going to get there see a
[50:57] real real down in that prayer we somehow
[51:00] we missing it folks we're missing it you
[51:02] see what you know I'm talking about
[51:04] collectively now cuz you talk about that
[51:06] woman and here she was a Pentecostal
[51:07] woman she says Lord where is that Elijah
[51:09] she said I prayed all
[51:12] night huh Lord don't let my son die like
[51:15] this I don't care if he die but save him
[51:19] Hallelujah I'm That Kind of a woman I'm
[51:21] a shite amen amen and I promised I
[51:24] dedicated him though he went wward yeah
[51:27] amen see a lot of time you dedicate them
[51:29] they still go but God say he'll bring
[51:31] them back I believe that with all my
[51:35] heart amen and they prayed they prayed
[51:38] they prayed they prayed or she prayed
[51:40] and then God broke a vision see I
[51:43] believe that I believe that same thing
[51:45] is now now now now amen that if you
[51:49] really want an answer from God and you
[51:51] set your heart to pray like you ought to
[51:53] don't worry about no time you get in
[51:55] there I don't care if you're not your
[51:57] eyes swell up until till they close amen
[51:59] I believe as you set your heart to pray
[52:01] like that confessing your sins and
[52:03] making things right before God and then
[52:05] seeking his petition or seeking him to
[52:08] answer your prayer he have to he can't
[52:11] refuse you right I mean come on look in
[52:14] the book of Acts this is my last
[52:16] scripture he will hear your prayer amen
[52:19] you so what you mean God don't care who
[52:21] you belong to and where you belong when
[52:24] sincere prayer God hears it it he said
[52:28] what do you mean he was Kus he was just
[52:30] a
[52:31] proelite huh Kus a proelite a gentile
[52:36] well what was the Jews
[52:38] doing there's not one record where the
[52:40] Jews God said I've heard your prayer
[52:42] this proelite believed God more so than
[52:46] the so-call
[52:47] original and he sought his face and God
[52:50] said your prayers has come up as a
[52:52] memorial meaning that he prayed more
[52:55] than once
[52:57] amen he constantly pray he built
[52:59] something in the spiritual realm that
[53:01] built from one level to the next level
[53:03] to the next level to the next level that
[53:05] God had to say listen look at this guy
[53:07] here he stands as a
[53:09] memorial here Jesus was told don't go to
[53:12] the
[53:13] Gentiles Paul didn't were supped I mean
[53:15] the the uh disciples weren't even
[53:18] supposed to go to the Gentiles God had
[53:19] to raise up amen then Jesus breaks it he
[53:23] go to Samaria said I have need to go to
[53:25] Samaria
[53:27] and now God comes in and why did happen
[53:30] why why why Gentile because the Jews had
[53:33] rejected and Paul was coming on the
[53:35] scene and God was turning the AIDS right
[53:38] then and there shutting the Jews out and
[53:40] opening the doors for the Gentiles
[53:42] amen and here was this man a proelite
[53:45] Amen in the Jewish faith but he prayed
[53:47] so much to his prayer went up as a
[53:49] memorial and guess what God comes along
[53:51] and he and he works with Peter and and
[53:53] and all of the rest of them and says but
[53:55] they said well no no and no unclean
[53:57] thing has ever come in my mouth but God
[53:58] said you know what I call clean don't
[54:01] you refuse it amen hallelujah now you
[54:04] say well brother what you saying I'm
[54:05] saying we've got to go
[54:08] deeper brother bandam talk about prayer
[54:10] and he says it's a
[54:12] traveling he said you call it Soul
[54:15] travail but in reality is soul
[54:19] travel we need to get deeper and I
[54:23] believe by the grace of God that's where
[54:24] God is calling us for this year
[54:27] to go into a place where God can take us
[54:30] places anybody know what I'm talking
[54:32] about you want you want God to just take
[54:34] you places how many time you dream I
[54:37] mean how many you prayer and somehow you
[54:39] think you slipped off into the dream and
[54:40] then you see
[54:42] things because you like
[54:47] wow you know it's amazing it's amazing I
[54:51] mean even today I mean this morning when
[54:53] I when God showed me something about one
[54:55] of my children and I'm like wow I mean
[54:58] it wasn't good but still he showed it to
[55:00] me gave me Grace to know how to pray I
[55:04] mean come on when you wake up from a
[55:06] dream you you know so real you wake up
[55:09] you go back to bed and then finish
[55:11] yourself start where you left finish
[55:13] again you wake up you go back three
[55:17] times has happened to me this
[55:18] morning who could have done that for God
[55:21] why did he show me not to criticize cuz
[55:24] anybody without the Holy Ghost a do do
[55:26] anything
[55:28] amen huh but God gives us why because we
[55:32] High we're priests amen right not high
[55:35] priest but we're priests amen Kings and
[55:37] Priests handling the blood of Jesus Amen
[55:40] doing like job amen I'm I'm okay I know
[55:42] my children out there sinning perhaps
[55:44] they'll be doing things out I can't keep
[55:46] up with them but I'm a I'm I'm a
[55:48] sacrifice the lamb amen that's what we
[55:51] here for amen we are amen the blood of
[55:53] Jesus Christ by the spirit Hallelujah
[55:56] the Holy Ghost in US amen makes us
[55:58] preach and that's why we can cry out
[56:00] amen the spirit and the bride say
[56:04] come we got to stand in the Gap amen got
[56:08] to stand in the Gap because Satan will
[56:10] devour he'll consume but right now if
[56:14] the salt loses savior remember amen
[56:17] destruction will not come until the
[56:19] bride is in such a fewer
[56:22] number God say destroy it you see what
[56:25] do you mean that's how it was in in the
[56:26] days of
[56:27] Sodom fat
[56:29] 50 40 30 hello it's got to be so few in
[56:34] number like God did in Sodom before the
[56:37] fire falls think about it everything
[56:39] else had gone
[56:43] worldly those who once believ don't
[56:45] believe no more Hallelujah come on and
[56:50] as it was in that day before the fire
[56:51] can fall that's why the prophet God said
[56:53] it'll be a handful that'll make a
[56:55] rapture not that they there wasn't any
[56:57] before died all but at the time of the
[57:00] translation It'll be such a few
[57:04] compared that God will be just to
[57:06] destroy it he'll take us up out of
[57:09] there you love the Lord let's
[57:23] let I wish I could have a one 2 three
[57:27] show you how it's all
[57:30] done but everybody's different all I got
[57:33] to tell is you got to just get on your
[57:35] knees and say God I heard your word I
[57:38] believe what brother Brooks preached was
[57:40] true take me there show me reveal it to
[57:43] me drive me deliver me or lead me you're
[57:48] the master you know and and and we know
[57:51] we've got to follow those bloody
[57:52] Footprints you see what I'm saying and
[57:54] that Bloody footprint those Footprints
[57:56] take you to Calvary folks it takes you
[57:58] to that place where you got to die out
[58:00] to yourself and I know with all of my
[58:02] heart I wish the whole church would have
[58:04] been here to hear this because prayer is
[58:06] the key to the Rapture I'm telling you
[58:09] it is the key to the
[58:12] Rapture that's where God will say things
[58:15] to you that a preacher can't tell
[58:20] you you love the Lord let's just B A
