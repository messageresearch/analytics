[27:16] unto the cave of a deulim and the truth
[27:20] of the philistines pitched in the valour
[27:22] of griffin him and david was then in a
[27:25] hole and the garrisons
[27:27] of the philistines was then in bethlehem
[27:31] and david longed and said old that one
[27:35] would give me drink of the water of the
[27:39] well of Bethlehem which is by the gate
[27:42] he men and the three mighty men break
[27:46] through the host of the Philistines drew
[27:49] out the well from the will of Bethlehem
[27:52] that was by the gate and took it brought
[27:55] it to David nevertheless he would not
[27:58] drink thereof but poured it out unto the
[28:02] Lord and he said be it far from me O
[28:06] Lord that I should do this it's not this
[28:11] the blood of the men that went in
[28:14] jeopardy of their lives therefore he
[28:17] would not drink it these things did
[28:21] these three mighty men let's borrow his

[28:32] into your house father we thank you just
[28:36] for the thought this morning that we
[28:37] could get up and arise O God and as
[28:41] David said I was glad when they said

[28:45] Lord

[30:02] God O Lord God bless us this morning in
[30:07] Jesus name we pray amen amen you may be
[30:12] seated
[30:14] hallelujah amen I want to use for just a
[30:18] topic this morning give the King what he
[30:21] desires a man give the King what he
[30:25] desires and just a background this text
[30:31] before we give the main text of what we
[30:35] want to share I like to look at the
[30:40] three characters in the story that
[30:44] surrounds David during this time and I
[30:49] just thank God that when we leave and go
[30:53] home then we're not going home sad amen
[30:58] I don't know about you but all that God
[31:01] has done I'm not about to leave here
[31:03] with my head hanging down how many got
[31:06] the victory Amen and what God has done
[31:10] for us
[31:11] amen it doesn't take much you know you
[31:15] don't have to beat and scrap and cry and
[31:18] do all of that just remember what Jesus
[31:21] have done for us the victory that you
[31:24] have in Christ Jesus amen you realize
[31:27] how much power you have against anything
[31:31] that comes against you amen and you know
[31:35] I just want to look at these particular
[31:37] characters and I hold
[31:39] that protect perhaps before we get into
[31:42] the text here and I believe we do that
[31:45] we have these kind of people here
[31:47] amen not the boys me and I can't make it
[31:51] and I don't know what I'm gonna do
[31:54] amen you need a revelation if that's
[31:56] your thoughts amen so but just as a way
[32:00] of encouraging you I'm thankful that God
[32:02] surrounded David with some money man
[32:06] amen and you know if you're gonna go to
[32:09] war don't need and taking anybody
[32:10] thinking you're gonna lose
[32:12] just leave them home but how many know
[32:14] that we already have the victory I feel
[32:17] like preaching already but I just want
[32:20] to get into the text here in the Bible
[32:21] says and with just background and just
[32:23] verse 8 if you look a man one of the
[32:25] mighty men that the Bible gives a
[32:28] caption to his name was Ladino the Bible
[32:32] says in verse 8 that he lifted off his
[32:33] spear against eight hundred whom he slew
[32:37] at one time Amen now I know that that
[32:41] just looks like that's pretty hard to do
[32:43] sweat slaying 800 but how many know the
[32:45] Bible says that one can chase a thousand
[32:49] how many you believe that amen
[32:53] so a man that's and in the Bible you
[32:57] know and the Hebrew translation of the
[33:00] his name adeno means heart amen hard and
[33:05] solid that's what God wants he wants you
[33:08] to have a hard mindset a rock-solid
[33:11] mindset made up your mind you convinced
[33:15] your concern amen
[33:17] the Bible says that Jesus said his face
[33:19] like a flint he said I must do the work
[33:24] that the father given me work while his
[33:26] day for night come no man can work Amen
[33:30] in a sense we can say that Jesus was
[33:31] hard-headed Amen even the church was
[33:35] hard hit him many times they would take
[33:37] the church and persecute him and beat
[33:39] him and whip him and tell him don't
[33:41] speak in his name Amen don't talk in his
[33:44] name and they would take the beaten take
[33:46] the weapons go right out the door and
[33:48] bring the name of Jesus
[33:50] amen hallelujah so amen the church has
[33:54] to be hard-headed in a sense
[33:56] Amen no matter what they say man I'm
[33:58] gonna stay with the word no matter what
[34:02] they say to me I'm gonna believe the
[34:05] word how many believe the words
[34:08] hallelujah amen
[34:10] all right and then this next character
[34:13] in verse 9 I've caused him Aliza the son
[34:19] of dode old aho Heights one of the three
[34:23] mighty men of David the Bible says of
[34:27] him when they defied the Philistines
[34:31] they were gathered together to battle
[34:34] and the men of Israel were gone away but
[34:40] you know the word Aliza means God has
[34:44] helped how many you believe that God has
[34:49] helped amen the Bible's that now I know
[34:53] I said God has helped there's a
[34:58] different not God is going to help you
[35:00] this morning God has helped amen by His
[35:05] stripes we were healed by what Jesus
[35:09] done on the cross you are already healed
[35:12] not I'm going to be delivered I have
[35:15] been delivered whatever it is that I
[35:18] want God to do he's already done it he's
[35:21] waiting for my faith to catch up to what
[35:24] he's already done hallelujah amen y'all
[35:28] ought to give God praise come on put
[35:30] your hands together give God praise yes
[35:34] Amen I'm not gonna be that long but I
[35:36] just I just want you to catch these a
[35:38] little day sometimes people oh I want
[35:40] God to do something if you can just
[35:42] recognize he's already done it
[35:44] oh my all right Ellie's a God has helped
[35:51] a man not it's a good thing to know that
[35:53] you can't do it alone no you can't do it
[35:56] alone we cannot do it with alone you
[36:00] know you can't even live this word alone
[36:03] you can't live this word by the letter
[36:05] Amen because a letter killed but the
[36:07] Spirit will pick up that word and bring
[36:10] it to life
[36:11] amen amen God has helped now remember
[36:14] that these are the men that God
[36:16] surrounded David with God has given you
[36:19] help already there's something there's
[36:21] somebody even there's somebody around
[36:24] you don't believe amen this one doesn't
[36:27] believe but don't worry there's somebody
[36:29] that will believe if that word goes on
[36:32] good ground it'll bring forth Amen God
[36:36] will not be without a witness he'll have
[36:38] someone that'll have faith it might be
[36:40] short and small and not with big muscles
[36:43] Amen but they got faith hey man God has
[36:48] helped God has helped amen

[40:14] we're not too loud here they might run

[40:19] I think of how powerful God's Word is a
[40:21] man do you love him amen we not gonna be
[40:24] long here but that let's just go just to
[40:26] another carrots
[40:27] these three characters in this last one
[40:29] I want to look at in verse 11 and after
[40:31] him was Shama so you had a dino who was
[40:36] hot amen and you had le Eleazar who God
[40:41] has helped and now we have Shama many
[40:49] times people only get a revelation of
[40:52] half of his name sham yep y'all know
[40:58] what a sham is let me know what a sham
[41:01] is bogus and sometimes people get half
[41:05] the word and they think this is a sham
[41:08] this is bogus it doesn't work and that's
[41:13] what Chama name means in the natural
[41:19] it means astonishment loss and sometimes
[41:27] the devil will hit you so hard you think
[41:31] I've lost everything but in the
[41:37] spiritual Shama has a different meaning
[41:40] in the spiritual Shama means the Lord is
[41:46] dead so just when you think you lost it
[41:53] just when you think he's not there he's
[41:57] actually there oh I love a man it seems
[42:03] like God isn't there Amen but just
[42:06] remember he's jehova shamma I will
[42:10] always be with my bride I will always be
[42:13] I will never leave you nor forsake you
[42:20] and I like both of those I mean I you
[42:23] know sometimes people can leave you and
[42:25] forsake you but I'm glad that he won't
[42:27] leave me and nor will he forsake me and
[42:31] that that means a hope you know it means
[42:32] something when people won't forsake that
[42:34] means God says I'm always identify with
[42:37] you
[42:38] I'm not gonna stand over here and say oh
[42:40] I don't know who I don't know who that
[42:41] is no he's gonna identify that's my
[42:45] brother I'm not gonna leave you and
[42:48] neither will I forsake you I'm going to
[42:52] be identified with you how many believe
[42:59] God is present not atmosphere is a
[43:01] little bit higher here and it feels how
[43:03] many feel good in here this morning Amen
[43:06] can we turn a corner and we bought done
[43:07] it everybody all right can we go a
[43:10] little farther Amen I want to just break
[43:13] into this little piece of the right now
[43:15] I'm just getting to the text but this is
[43:18] where I want to get to and I hope God
[43:22] has someone I believe you do I don't
[43:24] believe he would send me this far hey
[43:26] man I can feel the faith in here amen
[43:31] but I want now this say Lord open my
[43:33] eyes now
[43:34] let's peel into this little verse here
[43:36] just for a moment to see what God was
[43:39] sending us a little short ball hitting
[43:41] me and always father say to you the
[43:44] Bible says here amen in verse 14 David
[43:53] was in a hold and the garrisons of the
[43:57] Philistines was then in Bethlehem and
[44:02] that is a kind of sad situation here
[44:10] David's in a cave and the Philistines
[44:13] over in Phil's in Bethlehem that
[44:17] shouldn't be
[44:19] are you with me and the Bible says that
[44:24] David long how many are longing David
[44:32] long to Bob say he'd long he said oh
[44:36] that one would give me a drink
[44:43] now I'm sure
[44:44] badwater just think now their water they
[44:49] were in a cave but David wanted a
[44:52] certain kind of drink alright you know
[44:58] maybe somebody would come hand him a
[45:00] soda I'll take a soda but the Bible says
[45:04] he long from a drink from the well of
[45:08] Bethlehem it was a different type of
[45:11] dream coming to know what I'm talking
[45:16] about yes it was a clear crystal
[45:20] springing a man drink that you had to
[45:23] get from way down in a will so now we
[45:30] have a conflict here what David is
[45:33] warning they could not supply where he
[45:36] was God had positioned his servant in a
[45:42] hole we couldn't get out and then he
[45:45] made him thirsty for something that will
[45:49] fill his quickened thirsts until he said
[45:52] oh I long for a drink I don't know about
[45:55] you but I'm longing for a drink
[45:58] I can't drink anything and if they won't
[46:01] feel me and I'm tired of drinking soda
[46:07] pop soda pop soda pop suddenly after
[46:09] Sunday's soda pop soda pop soda bomb you
[46:13] know people are satisfied with soda pop
[46:15] how many no there's nothing like a good
[46:17] old fresh good old fresh drink from
[46:22] water from the well of Bethlehem was
[46:31] they're hungry said I must have that
[46:33] drink
[46:35] can you imagine look who are we talking
[46:38] about here now everybody think women
[46:41] don't everybody put on your thinking cap
[46:42] think about we're talking about David
[46:45] how many know David you know David you
[46:47] know King David you know the warrior you
[46:49] know he was a fighter how many know he
[46:51] was a fighter how many know he could
[46:53] fight listen are we talking about these
[46:55] three mighty men but you know how many
[46:57] know they wasn't
[46:58] comparing to david we're talking about
[47:00] the little guy that for a bear amen
[47:05] we talked about a little short guy at
[47:07] the back come up and hug him but david
[47:11] had enough law that his bear hug was
[47:14] bigger than the Bears back home
[47:17] amen we talked about Amanda Amen slew a
[47:20] lion amen and what the Bible says he
[47:22] took his mouth and open it up you
[47:25] realize how much power it takes to do
[47:27] that you allow so much character it
[47:30] takes to do that when you're not paying
[47:34] attention and the people all shouting
[47:35] and all getting carried on and you mess
[47:38] around and you pull too hard and you rip
[47:40] the sheep but I believe it took power
[47:43] and character to a man to pull that
[47:46] lion's mouth open delicately strong
[47:49] powerful but humble and character not to
[47:53] do something so somebody else can see it
[47:55] but to do something to save the life of
[47:58] the sheep when nobody else is looking
[48:01] and to pull it up delica lee strong but
[48:05] humble and pull the sheep out tap the
[48:09] little blood mark there and throw him on
[48:11] his shoulder and go on back to the flock
[48:14] and I love that's how Jesus did for us
[48:17] he didn't just rip us I know he ripped
[48:21] the devil and pull us out gentle in and
[48:25] heal those scars and those bruises and
[48:29] all those temptations and trials and
[48:32] listen I'm so thankful for the blood I
[48:35] got to go here just a moment but how
[48:37] many thank God for the blood listen to
[48:40] blood not only cleanses you but it
[48:43] purifies your mind amen and the blood is
[48:46] sprinkle on your conscience so you don't
[48:49] walk around feeling guilty about the
[48:52] evil you done not only does he save your
[48:55] soul but he purifies your conscience I'm
[48:58] not a sinner I never was a sinner I
[49:02] actually what a mean I before I came
[49:04] here
[49:05] I was somewhere else a man how
[49:11] you thank God for the great Shepherd
[49:15] delicately pulling you out of the
[49:17] enemies sometimes people don't you know
[49:21] you got to go deeper it's more than the
[49:23] blood the blood purifies your conscience
[49:27] from dead works to serve the Living God
[49:31] listen you can't serve God without a
[49:33] peel conscience you can't serve God did
[49:39] the devil counsel remind you all you
[49:41] know what you did last year
[49:42] you know what you did last week you know
[49:45] what you did last night don't you know
[49:48] but the blood of Jesus sprinkles your
[49:49] conscience when I confess my sins he is
[49:54] just to forgive me of my that's the
[49:58] scripture but the other part of us say
[50:00] he cleanses me from them he forgives you
[50:04] but he cleanses what he has to do is not
[50:06] only forgive you but it has to clean
[50:09] your conscience because if your
[50:11] conscience still thinking about it
[50:13] won't be long you be right back
[50:16] but if he purges your conscience when
[50:18] the devil called the old man you don't
[50:21] know what he's talking about
[50:23] hallelujah is somebody ought to give God
[50:25] praise Amen let's give God praise amen
[50:29] let me get back hey man I didn't mean to
[50:32] go all there but the Holy Spirit went
[50:34] there so I had to go where he goes amen
[50:36] but David here Amen desired a drink and
[50:44] here's what I want to leave in your
[50:48] heart and in your spirit how many

[1:07:26] amen
[1:07:28] I was a girl my undergraduate degrees in
[1:07:32] concert piano that's pretty good
[1:07:34] you know but right at the end of
[1:07:36] graduating I want to say that I lost my
[1:07:38] mind I didn't lose it but I just
[1:07:40] couldn't remember nothing cuz you know
[1:07:42] the call of God is so big it makes
[1:07:44] everything else you're doing so small
[1:07:46] and people are trying to grab so many
[1:07:49] big things they think it's big and it's
[1:07:51] nothing and here the power of God and
[1:07:53] the call of God is greater and they
[1:07:55] won't
[1:07:55] grab to that and all of a sudden I
[1:07:57] started seeing how small and how Paul
[1:08:00] calls it dung all this stuff I strived
[1:08:03] for all this education Paul was smart
[1:08:05] and educated amen
[1:08:06] then I'm been small and educated by
[1:08:08] write four books of the you can't write
[1:08:09] no books in the Bible but for a man how
[1:08:12] many know what I'm talking my but God
[1:08:13] used that education to lie him a man to
[1:08:16] share the word and right at the end of
[1:08:19] that God said no I'm not gonna let the
[1:08:21] devil get that that was for me you got a
[1:08:25] brain amen and I thought oh I'm going
[1:08:29] here but God said no you're not God sent
[1:08:34] a loving man a stern man a caring man a
