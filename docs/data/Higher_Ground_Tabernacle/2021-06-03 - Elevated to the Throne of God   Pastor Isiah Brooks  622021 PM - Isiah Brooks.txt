such a wonderful job when i get into the spirit of god i forget my age somewhat like caleb i feel so young but as we stand we're going to ask that you turn with us to excuse me i tell you what let's start with the scriptures that we were working with on the last message because i want to kind of tie this in let's go to isaiah 43. should regardless good in this place we're looking at a time where god is getting ready to do some greater things let's start by god's grace i'm just going to start up here at the first verse but now thus said the lord that created thee o jacob and he that formed thee o israel fear not for i have redeemed thee i have called thee by name thou art mine when thou passes through the waters i will be with thee and though the rivers and through the rivers they shall not overflow thee when thou walketh through the fire thou shall not be burned neither shall the flame kindle a pundi for i am the lord thy god the holy one of israel thy savior i gave egypt for thy ransom ethiopia and zebra for thee since thou was precious in my sight thou has been honorable and i have loved thee therefore i will give men for thee and thy and people for thy life fear not for i am with thee i will bring thy seed from the east and gather thee from the west i will say to the north give up unto the south keep not back bring my sons from afar my daughters from the ends of the earth even everyone that is called by my name for i have created him for my glory i have formed him yea i have made him one more scripture please we ask that you turn with us to revelations the third chapter revelations third chapter you love the lord we ask that you turn with us to the 20th verse i'm sorry behold i stand at the door and knock if any man hear my voice and open the door i will come in to him and i will suck with him and he with me to him that overcometh will i grant to sit with me in my throne even as i also overcame and have sat down with my father in his throne he that have an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the church is let us pray father god we come before you lord we thank you for your grace and your mercy lord we realize lord that there is nothing that we can say or do oh god it's all about you so we're asking tonight lord that you forgive us of our sin cleanse us from all of our unrighteousness lord and we pray that you'll speak through this earth and vessel lord give us ears to hear in our heart to receive lord give us a place o god in your kingdom to grow and mature oh god to the perfect statue of christ bless us lord because we know it's not him that willeth nor he that runeth but you lord jesus who shows us the mercy give us the mercy and grace that we need to be perfect in that sight in jesus christ's name we pray amen you may be seated one of the scriptures that i really wanted to get to and i'm not gonna uh i'll just verbalize it when god called john in the book of revelation and you heard me say this many times he says come up hither and the bible said that john was in the spirit on the lord's day so we understand according to brother branham that john represents and types out the bride and john couldn't get the revelation that he needed standing earthly he had to be in the spirit so is it with this message we have come a long way we've seen some stand we've seen some fall we've seen some come and we've seen some go and we've seen sun some return but at the end of the day god has never lost one we entitled this message when we first started the destiny of god's will and it's amazing uh how and testament it's amazing how brother uh orlando was just kind of tapping into thoughts and things that we have ministered because you know we know what a testament is the testator has to die but we must understand by god's grace in order for us to have what the bible calls a testimony we not only should be test tested but we in the trial that we go through we must die in order to live and so we we we want to kind of tie this in because like i said this bible this book is like god's uh redemption diary and in this book it tells all of the events that he has done and wanted to be recorded because there were a lot of things that were done and not yet recorded even in the new testament we find out that he said that they said that if everything had been recorded there would not be enough books to put those things in and of course you know our prophet he came and he he said that in his ministry which is christ's ministry he did more things than what jesus did at least things that are recorded so we we look at this thing and we we wonder what god is doing as i said by god's grace that this is a destiny you know it's a journey there is a point of ending but our ending is just only the beginning of what we call eternity and it's not him that willeth nor he that run it but it's god who shows the mercy and the grace of god as we were saying we have come through uh justification sanctification baptism of the holy ghost and now we've come to a time where uh the person of christ is supposed to be seen we've come through the jumping we come through the shouting we've come through the speaking in tongues and all of those things are good but none of that can guarantee you heaven you can do all of that you can be as religious as religion can be but it's not based upon those things everything we do has already been decided and god by way of his foreknowledge knew every decision we would make and at the end of the day it boils down to the place where god has chosen you and elected to you to be bribed you can't work your way into it you can't fast your way into it you can be the most like i said the most religious person in the message and it still doesn't guarantee you we have heard the prophet of god say many things and one of the things that he said you can have the holy ghost all of your life and still be lost but he's not talking about your soul he's working with the spirit man because the holy spirit can work on your spirit use you and yet you haven't been converted and you say well prove that to me peter james john and all of the disciples were sanctified they cast out devils in in the name of the lord they saw miracles and yet they were not converted and god told peter peter when you are converted strengthen your brethren see conversion is something you can't do only god can do that but i want to read a quote here coming from the mighty god unveil and brother battle said and that's what's the matter today my lutheran brothers my baptist brethren my pentecostal brethren and all of my brethren of different denominations that's what it is see you're trying to give a note hit back in the days of luther wesley like the like when uh you know the actually the music sheet here shows that it's another day and that is the problem with a lot of the people around the message now i understand you understand me if you ordained to make the rapture it is god's duty to reveal it to you because he said it is given unto you to know the mysteries you didn't earn it it's given to you when peter received the revelation of who jesus christ was all of them at that point in time did not know but peter voiced it because the lord knew peter had it and he said unto peter flesh and blood did not reveal this unto you but my father which is in heaven and upon this rock this revelation of who jesus is i build my church see that's deep that's really something that a lot of people think well you know it was a revelation given to peter but everybody in that in all the disciples had to come to know who jesus was right because they had a commission go ye therefore and baptize all in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost they had to know who jesus was in order to fulfill the scripture according to acts 2 38 they had to know that this wasn't a trinity this wasn't a duet or a dual thing this was one god in your faith manifested himself in three different attributes he was the father in creation the son in redemption and the holy ghost in the world today now i'm saying let me move on see he said we can't live in the light of luther he was a forerunner we appreciate his part but we played that out we're way over here and this is the point i wanted to say in the back of the book we're in the back of the book all of those other things they're all good they played a part in the music sheet but now we're coming to the end of the sheet we're coming to the finale you know i love the way those musicians would do they'll play that music all the way in to the end and then after at the end they give that little final drama zoom i like that and we know that when he gives that final that those are cards that final card is the end and you understand that's the end it is at that time people began to applaud somehow it seems like that final in gets more applause than all of the other works because that musician is saying i have come you have heard you've been it's been wonderful to you but now this is the end room and that's what god is saying understand that last chord is the important chord it's the finishing chord hallelujah and that is what the pride is she is that finishing card hallelujah she emphasized that everything was complete and in order now we're in the back of the book so therefore there must be something greater remember i told you that being born of god it's very important we can't allow ourselves to be pulled into a system because it is the system that deceives cain was a system of worship abel was worshipped you understand me let me say it again cain had a system of worship but abel was worshiped it wasn't a system so you can understand one was a sheep and the other one was a goat and the goat was trying to impersonate the sheep but the sheep didn't have to do an impersonation the sheep itself was the person hallelujah and remember as i said in the last message or two that god could not give abel the birthright even though he was the firstborn but he was not the first born of adam and this is why cain got angry at abel because he realized that he could not inherit he wasn't a part of the original bloodline so he could not inherit what belonged unto abel you understand me so you can understand what i'm saying think about it jesus when he was on earth they hated him they were jealous of him because he was not impersonating he was the real life and that life produced the supernatural it was his it was his he didn't have to muster it up all he had to do was yield to the anointing those who were impersonating may have looked more righteous than he the system always looked better they perfect the system they perfected so much until it literally looked like the real thing the difference is the life versus the imitation of life and we realized by god's grace amen that here it was the life of christ that was on display and jesus himself said it's not me i'm just a reflection of the one that's greater than i am and i can't do nothing except i see the father doing it then jesus said also he said if you're not born again if you're not spiritual you can't even perceive the kingdom of god so we find out that jesus had a a complete connection with the unseen uh dimension of god hallelujah you don't believe it he did so much so when they crucified him he said my god my god why has thou forsaken me and brother branham said it was at that time during that time of the crucifixion that jesus christ had never been separated from his father amen he went to calvary as a man he suffered as a man he felt disconnected as a man y'all understand me so but it was god moving this man into a position so that we could be redeemed hallelujah and why would we need redeeming because the bloodline had been defiled hallelujah and god needed a perfect blood adam mess it up but god needed a perfect blood and that perfect blood could only come through jesus christ fallen man that's what we were fallen man and i showed by the the the other uh this age is different it's different it's not uh it consists of two kind of you know kind of intertwined but but you you you've got an enoch and a and a noah kind of you know you know connected so much so that you you got a foolish version and a wise version but the you got to understand that the foolish version had a different covenant than the wise the wise virgin had an unconditional covenant hallelujah and they followed the leading of the holy spirit the foolish virgin did not have that oil to sustain them and to carry them all the way through so they had a covenant which you got to understand if you don't have the grace of god the only thing left is law and the bible see because they were virgins they lived it but they lived it according to the law and not according to the spirit even though because there was a time they did have the spirit but understand it they ran out of oil and what would make you run out of oil is when you don't know how to get refilled right you don't know how to get refilled because the the the age of change the dispensation pretty much like i said let's leave it like that the age have changed it's changed from laodicea to the bride age and the one who could you could buy the oil from it's no longer present you can't get it you see because without william branham we would not have had the oil and the extra oil that represented the stimulation of the revelation of the word it was the light that was going to carry us to our destination hallelujah i love this because let me say it like this let's take a worm that would soon be a butterfly the life is already in the worm hallelujah there's nothing he needs to do other than be a worm it is the life that changes him you we don't do it it's the life in us that changes us from glory to glory to glory to glory hallelujah amen enough walk with god understand walking with god is walking with the word walking with god is walking with the anointing walking with god is also walking with the inside of the word the revelation of the word and when you walk with that you can't help but to have an ascension is that right because you understand the ascension is that act of rising to an important or higher level like for example christ ascended right and when he ascended he said well what do you mean enoch ascended hallelujah moses ascended yes if he didn't they couldn't find his body brother brown said he typed out the resurrection the resurrection the dead saint that will be resurrected and when they were they were resurrected were they did they accept i said yes sir they did hallelujah they went into a different place a different place other than paradise because paradise was emptied out but we went into that what we call now the sixth dimension that dimension underneath the altar that plays that that william branham was ascended to right in there amen he was in a place and we don't fully understand it but he was in a place he saw his dog he saw his horse he saw a mansion he saw his wife he saw his daughter you see what i'm saying amen but that was a place he said i didn't call it heaven i just told you it was there you didn't know it was that but i was there and you know you got to understand that these things these dimensions that that just far beyond anything we can imagine because all we know is just these little three things right we just know this dimension feel and touch and taste and you know what we see and all that stuff but it's beyond that amen so you what are you saying it was a preview a prelude amen of of of where we're going he said when i saw those millions they were running and hugging me and said oh that precious brother why are you preaching this that's our destiny that's where we are going hallelujah and when you have heard this message you've literally heard from your theophany it is a vindication that you're not only here but you're there hallelujah i love that because you know einstein he came up to that theory a real relativity where you could be in one place and then be in another place but he got it from jesus the bible said jesus said tell me how can the son of man be standing here and standing in heaven at the same time hallelujah he was trying to tell him this is not the only place you're being reflected there's a reflection a higher influx of reflection over there hallelujah i just believe that when you're in the spirit of god you're literally fellowshipping with your theophany hallelujah so anyway let's move on by god's grace you're talking about the sentence you know paul says i can't even tell you amen whether i was in the what heaven i was in the third heaven wherever he said but the things i saw was unlawful for me to speak in other words it's not right it ain't the time yet hallelujah amen and so these things that can only be known at the end time why do you think god would tell you come to these things to tell you what what was prepared for you uh you know he said i go to prepare a plate for you that where i am there you may be also understand the place that we're going is not the final is not the ultimate goal the ultimate goal is for god to see himself in you in that day you'll know that i am in the father the father's in me and i am in you is that right that's the ultimate goal because remember i told you that adam and eve purpose was to replenish the earth the first element is that their main purpose was to replenish the earth with true sons and daughters of god and they missed it because of their sin hallelujah but the second adam who's a quickening spirit the bible said he's the lord of heaven and heaven y'all understand what that means that's our father and if he's a quickening spirit you must be a quickening spirit see but we must go beyond as our brother was saying beyond the veil this is what the prophet god was saying that when you go beyond the veil if you just shut the door that's that's what we're having the problem of shutting the door once we get behind there because when you shut the door you have you have rested from all of your labor there's nothing you need to do from that point on hallelujah you just that dead rod and god because you're in the presence of god it is god who gives you life it is god who makes you flourish it is god who makes you blossom it is god who makes you bloom it is god who brings forth the fruit is god as it was supposed to be from the beginning because of the fall we instituted human effort we are the ones amen that put this thing in action adam and eve they brought works into into place of grace you know this thing started off with grace it started off with love it unmerited and this is what the message have come to restore you know we we look at god and he says well unmerited favor unmerited grace it was always that but you see a lot of times people don't understand that when unmerited grace and the unmerited love is given to you you're still supposed to keep the word amen you see you're supposed to keep it if he says don't do that means don't do but you're doing the don't do not because it's law but because you love him the key of the whole message is love jesus is love that's why the bible said if you say i love my brother i hate my brother and love my god he said you are a liar you can't love god without loving your brother hallelujah a lot of times people want this thing to be easy my subject this evening is to elevate it to the throne of god elevate it to the throne of god and when you elevate it to the throne of god you must understand it's not something you do because the bible says no man can add one cubit to a statue so how do i get to the place i need to go here's the simple answer to that they that are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god see it's being led by he's the shepherd and we're the sheep as long as we follow him that's what david said didn't he say it the lord is my shepherd i shall not want that's what he said but one of the things that really caught my attention was that he said he thou prepared a table before me in the presence of my enemies huh thou anointed my head with oil and my cup running over think about it it's it's literally predestination that's what david said you prepared it you know what prepared me it means it was done before we got there it was already ready like i was telling somebody no wonder brother branham said that that uh jonah was not vaccinated the reason why he could truly say that is because when jonah got there on the boat the boat was predestinated waiting on it it wasn't just a boat waiting on it the fish was waiting on him and not only was the fish waiting on him none of it was waiting on him god had already prepared it hallelujah sometimes we because we can't see the future we think we're in the wrong place oftentimes you're in the right place for the right things to happen so god can take you to the destiny he's already planned for you to go to there's nothing that's mistake it's prepared to take oh i'm in a place and people don't like me they hate me prepared prepared hallelujah the table is prepared in social enemies that's why the bible said you must love your enemy they pray they are the ones that can help you how can my enemy help you help me he is there to help develop your character hallelujah though anointed listen and that's the thing when you come to a table when you come to a table you know a table is a place of inter interaction it's a place where you know you you how can i say you nourish yourselves you share at experiences table new creation new new revelation is created that's why the bible says our conversation should be holy we talk with one another so sometimes we hear something like oh i've never seen that before that you're at the table hallelujah and understand amen what that the simmer says and my cup i thought lord what is that cup what is the symbolism of the cup the cup is your soul it is your soul that's being filled and built is that right you grow up into him hallelujah when at the table you say well what do you mean remember on the road to emmaus they went into that little hut the whole time jesus talked with them and all he got was a burning heart did not our heart burn as he talked to us along the way see because you feel good about the word doesn't mean that you got the revelation of it hallelujah the bible said when he did a certain thing and broke the bread then were the eyes open everybody leave out a church feeling good but you don't need to let go out just feeling good you need to understand what he's telling you at the table walking out there and they ran back he's alive he's alive understand that's what it's all about the whole thing is that you're setting at the table of malachi 4 and revelation 10 7 you're eating the word but that word is not set there just to make you feel good it is to bring identification and and to to know that christ is identified with you and you identify with him and what did he bring you back to even at the table he brought you back to the cross the sacrifice the piercing of the hands huh that's what it's all about the symbolism of that cup when that word is given to you and that revelation began to flow deep down and it's what is going to what does the true revelation of god produces love not only love for god but love for your brother have you ever felt like that you come out of service and you want to hug everybody even the sisters but you know you can't and you say oh sis i feel so good when we get over there we'll do it you know it's just that love that overflowing love that literally comes in your heart and come to yourself and you're feeling so good you stimulate it right brother keep coming time and you come out staggering you don't mean to stagger but that anointing is overflowing it feels your soul it overflows in your soul the cup might come running over and what is the revelation surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life what did he tell you then he'll he'll never keep the mercies from you he'll never to keep goodness from you you you just had an intimate relationship with him sitting at the table a table that's been prepared for you oh yes yes amen you say do you get what do you eat there at the table huh the bread the word he said if you eat this bread you'll never hunger ever again you there's bread there there's is that what he what happened in the communion what did he bring amen he brought the symbolism of life to you i am that bread ah he took wine he said stimulated amen i'm gonna not just give you some dead piece of bread hallelujah but if i bring light to that bread through that wine it stimulates you is that right and he told the woman at the well he says listen if you drink of this water you'll never thirst again hallelujah so there's more david was looking at something he saw a prophecy he saw something fulfilled there he says and me what i want you to understand i'm in the hands of the shepherd hallelujah i fear no evil why because thou art with me is that right surely surely thou art with me he said i'll never leave you nor will i forsake you i will always be with you what do you mean even through the hard times it's still the will of god hallelujah you don't think john understood that john the baptist it took him a bit but john didn't want to just die without knowing his work had not been fulfilled once he realized his destiny had come to an end he said i just want to know are you the one because john understood i must decrease while he increased you understand me but what we must understand is that the denomination has come to a place where they're dead i know they can still shout they can still dance they can still speak in tongues they can still prophesy they still pray and people get healed listen but he said it's more to this than that hallelujah what are you doing is just straightening up the mess that adam and eve did but i did it jesus did it right and i'm doing all of these things but that's not what i want i don't want the strength of samson i want his heart hallelujah yes i gave him those miraculous things that in his life but that's not what i wanted i had to send him through oh what were you saying do you think that the capture of samson was a mistake may have been on his part but god ordained it hallelujah you think the delilah was a vessel of dishonor prepared hello prepare for samson she took samson's in a place he had never been he was blind he was mocked he was laughed at backslidden but he was seed surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life what yes that's what it's going to take to get to the throne you can't get there on your own you know i used to think enough when he said enoch walked with god and was translated i thought for a long time you know you know you know how you have you know we think law i did he not well you know he had to walk so circumspect but don't you understand it was never enoch it was the anointing folks it's the anointing it is the christ that made enoch walk with god it wasn't law it was christ it was the anointing and enoch had a had a had a how can i say he was uh sensitive enough [Laughter] to know when god was leading him that's what we need we need some anointing uh christ sensitivity hallelujah you love the lord right he was that bread he said you'll never thirst he told a woman at the well you know you know if you drink of this water you shall never thirst again so god has never changed his menu hallelujah he's never changed his menu hallelujah he may have given you cannot say it like this without us being carnal he may giving you some better seasoning but he's still been serving the same thing is that right common manner becomes something great in the eyes of the believer you think if they would if they had known that was christ in the wilderness they would have handled it differently if the people know that the message is christ it is the revealed word it is the anointed word of the hour if people could see that they would give it a better revelation a reverence than what they do is the truth it's become common manner to a lot of people and when it become common you can't grow you can't live you're going to do just what they did in the wilderness they died hallelujah because it was so common they kept complaining they kept murmuring hallelujah and they failed to see that the thing that they were eating was the thing that was giving them life man does not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god hallelujah you love the lord amen we we we must understand that this message has taken us to a higher level you know samson did some great works he did but the latter end was great that was you see that was you sampson was blind to himself blind to the philistines hallelujah dead to himself dead to the philistines and the only thing that he had left was the leadership of the holy spirit that's where the bride must come to be blind to herself blind to this organization blind to the system of the message you understand me it is here that's why people sat and died the way they've been dying because they've fallen in love with the system they're practicing they're trying to produce the rapture on their own effort you can't do it it's christ in you if that same spirit be in you that was also in christ jesus as it quickened his body it shall quicken yours it will raise you up you cannot raise yourself it will raise you it is the life or the law of the life hey it's the law of the light it's called in you the hope of glory hallelujah hallelujah coming from the north not brother says now people can live in the spirit dance in the spirit they shout in the spirit they go to church in the spirit and they can absolutely have the real spirit of the of god anointed on that spirit but still be lost and just a devil possessed and just as devil possessed as they can be with that spirit why because it's on the spirit the anointing is on the spirit conversion come by the soul with that soul die it shall live hallelujah y'all understand what he's saying and we've seen that pentecost isn't all messaging all i mean you know can't even love each other but they can shout they can dance they can whatever more that ain't it we're falling into the same trap of the devil because you feel good and because you got a good thing and you know it's a real anointing but yet in your soul you know you're not converted you should know hallelujah think about it i think about the this is a drama you know you got to have those exciting parts you got to have those love stories come on hollywood does it you know it's not good until you get the love scene yeah come on folks let's not be connor but it's true people don't look at donald duck anymore they want some exciting portions war and fighting and love and romance and all of those things where did they get it from though they have perverted it the true love story is in this bible the true love story all hollywood does is mimic what god has already done and twist it and make it perverted and filthy but there is a real love story in this day and you and i we're the queen you understand me we're the center of the attraction we are the things that have been hidden from the foundation of the world remember when i quoted that quote last week uh wednesday and i showed you the fullness of the godhead bodily right the foothill was father son and holy ghost right but i showed you by god's grace how the fullness and i got the quote too the fullness of the godhead bodily has moved it's shifted into the bride of jesus christ she is the fullness of the god is that right after which you have received the holy ghost you shall receive what power that means authority that means you're no longer amen uh how can i say it god has break brought you to an inequality hold up brother an equality absolutely he showed it in type hallelujah that's why the seals had to be open so you could see what god is calling you to where your destiny is taken to you did jesus say it he said if you overcome it i'm just i'm gonna worry about it now he said if you can overcome he said i'll cause you to to sit in my throne even i have i have sit in my father's throne you say that's not equality yes it is saint john 10 30 he said i and my father are one he made himself they said what you make yourself equal with god hallelujah see he was equal y'all understand me more than that he was god so when he said amen i i that's why paul said we're joined with christ in the old the seals had to be opened the headstone had to come why because it was marrying time it was wedding time it was wedding supper time and you cannot marry the groom if he's not there so he had to come by way of seven thunders yeah i'd rather hear what i'm saying there was a predestinated bride that had to be there is that right and you had to have somebody to introduce the bride to the bridegroom and that was william branham oh will you take this man to be your lawfully wedded husband and she says i do hallelujah amen so you said what do you mean brother brooks esther says listen i got it written down somewhere esther the fifth chapter one through three three and esther goes to see the king now they told us that you can't do this but that's to say if i perish let me perish i'm going to see the king and when she went before a king i have to hear it was out of season he did not call for her you understand me the bride had made herself ready he did not call for her she went to him say where is that scripture when rebecca saw isaac in the field she went to him somebody i feel like shouting john up here because you got to realize it's something you've got to see who's in the field who's in the field you've got to come up to him hi from glory to glory to glory to glory amen from faith amen to knowledge to you know temperance patience all the way up god doing what filling your cup changing you and when you get to that final your cup was so run over it'll quicken your mortal body and change you from your from his this immortal immortality oh we we better understand this thing this thing is life it is the law of life like that that worm could not change itself into a caterpillar you cannot change yourself to a saint you cannot change on and bring on the theophany and the glorified oh it's the life in you that does it and god's word cannot come back forward you're talking about authority he put that staff out there and she didn't put it on the side she didn't bring it down to the bottom she touched the top showing she was equal oh come on somebody and he didn't say get your hand down from there he said no come on come on come on what is it that you want i'll give you the half of the king see you see what i'm saying he's already told her what he's going to give her she hadn't even asked yet he's telling her i'm giving you the half of the kingdom he said brother branham because you have chosen the hardaway i have reserved for you a greater portion a big part of this whole thing and the problem god said these people who overcome in his message we get the greater part we get the greater reward we suffer we got to go through it why because the greatest battle ever thought where is in your mind brother keith and i were talking and i thought you know that's true we fight the same devil most of our battles come from the sexual battle that's how it started and that's how it ends keeping yourself from the filth of the world that's your greatest battle that was great as battle that was brother brown whose greatest battle it wasn't a demon of epilepsy or the demon of that or that it was sex he had to put that cross in front of him because of the naked women and everything y'all hear what i'm saying it was then it is now hallelujah everything everything is centered around that thing that took place in the garden no matter what you look at on on tv and the billboards and everything else it's all about sex you can't even sell a product without it being sexy when a truck became sexy but take that take a woman and put it in front of that a naked woman and put it in front of that truck and she gonna sell that truck for you hallelujah you know what they say you got to treat this thing like it's a woman a man don't drive a man truck that that truck becomes a sheep yeah y'all hear what i'm saying it's always that musicians a lot of the musicians in the world they play it oh let me not go there because it is true it's something that's going on in their spirit that makes them play certain ways anyhow go look it up but my whole point is everything is centered around the very fact that it was sex in the garden instead of an apple you said well what about esther did not he give her the authority esther not only became the authority that saved the the foolish virgins which were those ones who got was going to get killed and they had had the right to fight that was a type she was already in the castle they were the ones who had to deal with the devil after she left she exposed the devil and haman you said who was haman type the devil that's why the prophet we pray for the foolish virgins because we don't pray for them they wouldn't make it they won't make it we're the queen of the foolish virgins hello now esther didn't have to fight to stay alive but they have to fight and that's when that tribulation that period comes on them they're going to have to fight to stay alive you know what i mean spiritually and because they fought roles were given to them it's still the grace of god you hear what i'm saying and esther became the mediator oh you better not say that yes she did she mediated between her people and and the foolish out there she mediated that's why we must pray for those who are not of the foe we we have a responsibility we're under the blood they are not they just think that they are that's the words of the prophet they they find themselves in the tribulation because they thought they were under the blood and they were not where is the blood under the reveal word god has moved the ark of the covenant where is it now in you hallelujah and where is the blood on the altar that's why we can pray for mercy we can pray for grace we are those who are praying that's why the word of god said to ezekiel those that sigh and cry hallelujah what about ruth you understand me ruth looked like this was a this was a mistake you know how could naomi and her husband them go out to moab when there was a law against moab don't have nothing to do with them god god held that thing against them but there is a seed the lord knoweth them that are his god don't care about your background the only thing he's looking at is your seed his seed you understand me all of us was in a messed up background everyone especially in america america has been an adulterous generation for years do you know how long it takes to clean that up 400 years and we haven't even existed for that so if it wasn't for the grace of god none of us would be suitable to be saved it's not your fleshly inheritance god ain't working with that because the gentiles have been mutts for ages god's looking at the seed that was planted in you before the foundation of the world that's it and god showed that through ruth right she was a morbidity she was a mixed breed but that god didn't care about that she wasn't that in her soul she was thoroughbred in her soul y'all understand me and god saw that and god went through he took naomi and her husbands and her sons through all that hardship to produce what one roof and this world is going to go through all of that crazy stuff to produce one prize amen who israel got to go through stuff to do what to produce a hundred and forty four thousand it was playing the table was prepared hallelujah the anti-crisis is building up for one thing to put pressure on the bride destroy denominationalism uh uh the foolish right foolish young virgins and to do what to kill a hundred and forty four thousand won't be one lead lest it won't be one more and only god will know the number you understand me you say well well brothers what are you saying listen you gotta understand like brother brown said the book of ruth is a very beautiful picture there how that boasts type out christ how that ruth went over in a strange country as a backslid sliding went out of the land and brought back with her uh uh uh uh uh you know naomi did that he had it switched over he said i mean naomi and brought back ruth and ruth came back and she was what uh of another country of a more bite and when she came back she was a morbidity absolutely a picture of the gentile bride of the church because every one of us most of us who were in denominations we were more by this half word have organization amen listen he said he said and listen he he goes on and says and let your people he said when when ruth said to naomi let your people be my people and let your dwelling be my dwelling and let your god be my god and nothing but death shall separate us he said where you die i die when you are buried i'll be buried now there is a picture of the gentile coming into christ she's dying her whole goal is to die to self that he might live yes sir you love the lord amen god is so good to us amen god is so good to us now we we said well what do you mean brother we have a destiny and that destiny amen has been planned by god no matter how messed up it is now y'all y'all i'm gonna use my brethren you got one from the congo and one from zimbabwe how did you get here i'm just saying tonight think about it now this you didn't know me i didn't know you think about keith up in des moines i never dreamed i would ever be in des moines never had a desire to be in des moines and when he told me about how the lord showed him i was going to be pastor demon i laughed so what i'm trying to say is all of this has been ordained look at my brother here i've seen him in years you know the last time i seen him he came through by iowa city do you think it was a coincidence i don't know what god has in store for him but tonight was no coincidence everything is ordained by god and you and i must understand is what brother brooks you say what can that be well remember when paul was preaching so long and a young man fell asleep and failed after he died do you think that was an accident god didn't know what was going to happen he knew it and it all was done for the glory of god so even the most tragical things that may in our minds think how can it happen let me tell y'all something my children right now you look at them whether they're looking at this i don't know i'm not saying all of them but let me tell you something and i want the devil to take note to this it doesn't matter what it looks like it doesn't even matter how the devil judges it it has nothing to do with the devil i don't have to understand what he's doing but he promised me every one of my children i don't know how god's going to bring him through but in my mind they already come through i don't have to help it i don't have to usher it i don't have to do nothing because he promised it y'all understand me a promise can never be broken by god hallelujah ask whatsoever you will and believe it in your heart it shall be given unto you he can't stop that that's his law and life itself will make it happen hallelujah you look at these things and you say oh brother brooks what are you trying to say let me tell you something and i'm closing on this it's unconditional don't even think it don't even let satan come to your mind because of what you've done this is what's why it's happening well if it is it's going to have to be undone because god's purpose is going to be filled yeah how many of us let me ask a question it's as much as when it comes to parents there is no such thing as a perfect parent no such thing we all make mistakes i have made plenty if i could go back and change it i would i think but you know what i think about how god is playing this thing i better leave it alone because he's the one that's bringing forth the virtue he's the one that's going to bring the change he hasn't made a mistake even though my mistakes may seem like mistakes the bible said that the lord knows how to do what everything that works against you he knows how to turn it into good because all things work together for the good of them that love god now you say well well brother where where are you taking me with this so let me let me say this something that we were discussing earlier today we know we can't change ourselves but forgiveness from the lord is needed for us every day and the only way that we can ever get cleansed every day is to confess our sins because he said if you confess your sins he is faithful and just to forgive you of your sins and to cleanse you from all unrighteousness that's it that's all we have to do you say well what do you mean because when you confess your sins you're basically saying god you're right and i'm wrong that's all adam and eve had to do but they did not they will got in the way and they when they will got in the way they they produce pride father lord that woman you gave me the woman says lord that serpent you gave me but when it comes down to decisions it's your choosing at the end of the day you can say the devil made me do it but listen brother i'm saying you can't even blame the devil no ain't the more it's you it's your will your will he may have influenced you but you find your the final choice was yours other than so you got to understand god god going to get the devil but he going to judge you too god judges us all and you got to understand at the end of the day is what i have done and that's why you can't this is what people never grow up in mature because they want to blame everybody else for their faults and the problem is not everybody else is that individual right god gonna say what have you what did you do with this gospel well so and so no no no no what did you do you're standing alone but that's how it is now you're standing alone with god it's you and god at the table you and god that's fellowshipping at the table he's prepared the table and then he told he shows you where your enemies are is that right that's israel what they had to do god said don't worry about it i'll go before you i prepared it for you but i'm gonna go before you you're gonna win the battle all you got to do is do exactly as i told you to do you do what i tell you to do you'll come out as a winner right but lord there's so many no no no i told you to get before the army and you shout and praise god do you know you know make some good noise some worship noise and i i'll fight the battle for you that's what he did a lot of time we try not fight about you can't fight the devil he you pull your fist up at him he laughs what can the natural do with the supernatural absolutely nothing let's stand i'll finish it i'm not done but i want you to understand that we get with this whole message has come to elevate us take us from this carnal state to a higher plane you just this church was a name higher ground for nothing you got to believe that it was inspired for god by god of it it was amen that means god intend to take us there and so we we must understand that it doesn't matter what everybody else is doing it's what god expects us to do as individuals people keep pressing i know it's difficult i know it's hard i have battles now look like a like i've never had before my mind sometimes my mind goes on a freeze right in the middle of a subject or a sentence and all of a sudden it freezes you know you can't you can't do nothing wait till it come back right but god knows every freeze he talks at all you know and you look at it like he doesn't understand no he does but sometimes you know what if pride is there it becomes so embarrassing and we try to make excuses for it but there's no excuse you didn't turn it on and you can't turn it off it works at his own will in his own pace you understand today i had a little a talk with god and um i remember uh saying that i wasn't gonna take that shot and i told everybody that god told me not to and i really believe he did but then i did take the pfizer i apologize to you all for that um i don't know what really made me do it other than forgetting the word of god like he did i told her not to eat the tree and she did it and basically that's the way i felt when the conviction came upon me i don't one of the things that really bothered me is because i had someone say to me brother brooks i haven't taken the shot because you're not taking it no no no you can't do that don't put that weight on him every man for himself if you feel like you should take it take it the reason why i say that is because if you take a surface the bible says nothing shall now you can't do it if you ain't taking it in favor i didn't take it because i was fearful my purpose is one of the things that hurt me the most is because i don't want to be one that would transmit anything to anybody you know um and then i thought if i'm gonna travel i want to go somewhere where i can come back home i don't want to be locked overseas because i can't i don't have a shot and they don't ban it you know what i'm trying to say it's just that kind of thing it's way i've been thinking and people of god i i just the reason why i'm apologizing i've made it right with god because i really believe he told me and i did it and whatever the consequences are if there'll be any maybe you know he said he would i made things right but i don't want anybody to depend on my leadership in that area that's common but spiritual things that's a different thing and uh you know it's like okay brother bruce because you're jumping off the river i jumping off the bridge i'll jump off because you're jumping no no no no that's not the word wise [Music] we must all inquire of the lord and see what the will of the lord is now they saying that this vaccine has all kinds of effects and side effects it's a modern day genocide so we had whatever comes whatever comes like i said do you think god didn't know what i was going to do even though he told me i'm the one that's finding out what i and like i was telling brother keith today i said there was no pressure but you know i knew it was wrong because i hid it from the bike and the very day i was going to tell her she discovered the paperwork in my car and i told her i was going to tell her and i would tell keith i'm going to tell the church why because i want to be open and honest with everybody and so this is my confession i pray that you forgive us [Music] one thing about me i'm not shy we love the lord and i don't believe anything can harm me that's one thing i didn't say nothing couldn't test me but there's nothing can hurt me if god can protect [Music] the saints of old and boiling oil and everything else they had to go through it's not my flesh i'm concerned about it's my soul this is why i'm making confession because of my soul i'm not i just trust that all of you understand and so i made i was afraid to make it right publicly because my friend brother barnes stanley barnes he's going to hear this and i want to say to him i'm sorry he's very fearful for me and anybody he found out his mom took it and he just really upset him [Music] when he hears this [Music] anyway you love the lord let's have a word of prayer and we'll have our song father god we thank you for your grace and your mercy we thank you for being so good to us father you've been better to me i've been to myself lord we thank you for your amazing grace we thank you for being good to us for being our shepherd even sometimes when the shepherds [Music] lord how soon i forgot the words that you spoke to me [Music] i thank you for your unity thank you for bringing the conviction i thank you for enlightening the burden releasing me from the guilt consciousness thank you bless your people bless the hearer of the word bless those who came out tonight [Music] i really believe when god saved thou shalt not no matter what it is all of us bring confessions we go against the world every day [Music] just so you know it's easy i found out it's easy too easy if you don't watch and pray if you don't keep prayerful you'll let the things of the world influence you against the word of god so easily it was so easy but then you know when you cross that line the holy spirit is right and you say well how do you what i was talking to a brother overseas that's how the conviction came i was talking to brother overseas he said brother i i guess you you haven't taken that vaccine yet because you told me god said so i got to make right with him too but it's okay when he said that i'm like oh my goodness you love the lord father we thank you we thank you for your amazing grace it's not enough to pray you said pray pray pray pray without cece help us lord to be more watchful help us to be more circumcised help us lord to cleanse our hearts and our minds and our soul through confession every day that we would wash ourselves in the word every day throughout the day lord god that we'll stay virtuous before you lord god we pray for the people we pray for those who came out tonight though we be few in number lord we pray lord god that the word of god is that was spoken we'll find good ground we ask these things we pray in your name in jesus christ's name we pray thank you for the victory amen take up your gross and follow jesus oh take up your cross every day oh don't be ashamed [Music] to say that you know he oh count the ghost and take up your cross and follow him oh take up your cross and follow jesus who take up your cross every day oh don't be ashamed [Music] oh [Music] don't be ashamed [Music] and follow me [Music] oh striving alone to face [Music] could temptations go where could i go where could i go i am seeking a refuge for my soul [Music] oh [Music] a refuge for my soul [Music] oh where could i go [Music] oh [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] where could i go oh life here is [Music] oh [Music] i am a refugee [Music] oh [Music] for my soul [Music] oh where could i go [Music] you
