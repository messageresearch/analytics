TRANSCRIPT
========================================
belong unto us and to our children forever amen the secret things belongs belong unto the Lord Our God but those things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children forever amen and belongs to us so that we may do all the words of this law amen let's go to uh ecclesiast chapter 12 verse 13 ecclesiast 12:3 man here the Bible saying Solomon speaking here saying that let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter fear God and keep his Commandments for this is the whole duty of menen if you read here very carefully Solomon we know that Solomon was the wisest man on earth except for Jesus Christ amen and here he saying that this is the conclusion of the whole matter and that conclusion is fear God and keep his Commandments amen let's bow our heads father we humbly come before your throne of grace Lord to say thank you Father Lord thank you for keeping us alive Lord thank you Father for protecting us Lord thank you thank you Father for giving us another year father Lord Lord Jesus Lord now we here father Lord to serve you Lord we just pray father God that you help us Lord Do It Lord as you want us to do it father Lord we pray father God that you help us to be so sensitive to the Holy Spirit God so that we can say whatever you want us to say father Lord Lord I took my time to study your word Lord to meditate on this and I don't know exactly how to tell it to your people father I just pray father Lord that you help me Lord so that they can receive this message Father Lord we thank you Father for everything bless our pastor wherever he is and bless the bride all over the world in Jesus Christ name we pray amen amen amen you may be seated amen I I'll read again here the where the Bible Solomon is talking here in ecclesiast chapter 12 verse 13 amen here Solomon is saying that let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter fear God and keep his commandment for this is the duty this is the whole duty of man amen if you if we continue verse 14 it says that for God shall bring every work into judgment with every secret thing whether it be good or whether it be evil amen so this morning by the grace of God will try to uh uh bring this little subject that we entitled fear honor and respect fear honor and respect amen I will try to go very slow slower than I usually preach amen so that everybody can understand or get something from this so the title will be fear honor and respect so in in uh in Deuteronomy 29 where we read amen here is Moses talking to us he's saying that the secret things belong to the Lord Our God but those things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children forever that we may do all the all the all the words of this law and now here Solomon comes back and he says that the conclusion of the whole matter everything it's got concluded in one two things one is fear God and two keep his commandments so what is fear according to the Bible this fear that we're talking about here amen we're not talking about fear of being afraid of somebody or being scared amen so what is fear fear is having a deep respect and honor for God rather than being scared of him so having a deep respect in other words having uh uh uh reverence so to have the a big respect uh for God and honor is to have a higher respect or great esteem so in other words fear honor and respect they always go together so you cannot prophesy says that before you respect God you have to fear Him First and when you fear Him and you respect him that's how you honor him so how do you honor God Amen so we'll take a little story here of the meanest man uh uh the prophet preached about that I think his name was Simon yeah he he sent someone to go look for Jesus to invite him to his party and we know the story when Jesus got to that place instead of him taking care of him amen he left Jesus by himself he took care of everybody else's by Jesus amen and the prophet comes and said that that was a disrespect to him to Jesus he did not respect him amen because he did not take care of him he did not give him the attention he deserved he did not give him the honor that he deserved and it's the same thing sometimes what we do today at church amen we come to church and everybody prays Lord be with us when we come to church in our minds we have one one goal is to go meet God when we pray in the morning we say Lord be with the service today amen and the prophet says that God never misses his appointment amen whenever you call him amen it doesn't matter if you are a sinner or not God will show up amen but for him to bless you amen that would depend on on on your attitude towards him so it's something that you give to him and he gives you back so if you respect him you take care of him amen you give him all the honor he deserves amen he will bless you back amen noce that Simon was not a Christian amen Jesus ended disciples and everybody knew exactly who Simon was he was a bad man amen but nevertheless when he invited Jesus amen Jesus showed up amen because he was invited but the blessings that was that were reserved from him for him amen they were given to someone else who took care of Jesus so every time we come to church every time we pray in our houses or wherever we are amen we have to make sure to take care of him amen we have to make sure that we show him the respect amen that's how he will bless us back amen the Bible also talks about the story of Elias and his sons and his two sons amen the Bible says that those kids amen they were stealing offerings from the altar they were playing at church amen doing things that are not that that they were not supposed to do at church they were constantly disrespecting God's presence amen and we know the end of those guys of those two kids they all died amen and their father also died amen the prophet says I believe in the message respect if you read that message I'm not going to read it but if you read that message you will see that the prophet said that every time you disrespect God's presence amen there is a curse that will come after that amen so we have to make sure Amen to do our best Amen to always respect him let's turn to John chapter 2 verse 13- 16 John chapter 2: 13-6 amen it's a story that everybody knows the Bible says that and the Jews Passover was at hand and Jesus went up to Jerusalem and found in a temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves and and the uh and the Changers of money seeding and when he had made a Scorch of of of of small cords he drove them all out of the temple and the sheep and the O and and The Oxen and pour and poured out the the changes money and overthrew the tables and said unto them that saw dos take these things hence make not my father's house and House of merchandise amen and the prophet comes back after reading this it says that this is the only time in the Bible where it shows Jesus Christ being mad at something where just Jesus Christ being angry of something amen and what was the reason because people disrespected the house of God amen they turned the church amen into uh uh a market they turned the church amen which is supposed to be the house of God which is supposed to be the House of Prayer am they they turn it to things that they they were doing and enjoying amen people starting selling doves and animals and and and and things for sacrifices changing money so it became something it became a market and as we read here Jesus St something and took up took two cords and starting to beat people up amen it start to drive out all those animals and setting them free and uh uh uh overturning tables why because they took the house of God and they made it a market amen they were disrespecting the house of God Amen because the house of God is supposed to be a House of Prayer amen when God told Salomon to build a temple amen when Solomon built that Temple says that every time that the children of Israel will have something in their hearts or a prayer request every time they they will turn themselves to the direction of that Temple and pray amen God will hear their prayers and will give them whatever they were asking amen because the church is a House of Prayer amen the church is a place is a holy Place amen a church is not a place for us to come and meet people amen a church is not a it's not a place for us to come and start talking to one another amen a church is not a it's not a playground amen it's a Holy Ground when Moses went to meet Jes when Moses went to meet God in the burning bush amen God told him to take off his shoes because he was standing on the Holy Ground when Joshua met that angel of the Lord amen that angel of the Lord told him to take off his shoes because he was standing on the Holy Ground amen when you see the archangels in the presence of God Amen the prophet says that they Clos their eyes and they Clos their nudity amen showing that respect that reverence because the presence of God is there and so this is the duty of all the Christians amen Solomon says that this is the conclusion of the matter fear God and keep his commandment so to fear we understood as we said earlier Amen to fear means to respect and to respect means to honor and we have to honor God's but God's house the house of the Lord amen as if God was standing himself there physically amen because this is the place where God speaks to us amen this is the place where we speak to him amen so we have to honor this place amen with higher respect amen let's go to uh uh uh Deuteronomy chapter 10 verse2 so now let's go and and see what is fear according to the Bible Deuteronomy chapter 10:2 the Bible here saying Moses still talking he says and now Israel why does the Lord the Lord thy God require of thee but to fear the lord thy God to walk in all his ways and to love him and to serve the Lord thy God with all thy heart with all thy soul amen what is God requiring of you amen is to fear Him Amen to walk in all his ways to love him to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul so in other words to serve him with love amen there is a difference between serving God because you have to do it and serving him with love amen sometimes we get so used to our duties at church amen us incl us preachers included amen we so we get so used to our duties at [Music] church amen you know very well that you have to show up to church sing and clap your hands and pray and then go home or come and lead the songs and then go or preach or play or whatever you do here at church amen so we do it so very often it becomes a habit it's just something that we wake up well toor today oh today is Sunday so we have to go and do whatever we're supposed to do come amen that is not serving God with all thy heart and your soul amen because you're not serving him with love amen you're serving him just because you have to amen it's the same thing with our jobs amen very few of us go to work because we love going to work amen we just go because we have to we go because we know that we have to feed our families amen we have bills to take care of so we have no other choice but to go amen this is the same thing with Christians they go because they know as being Christian people are expecting them to go to church people are expecting them to show up every every service amen but they're no longer going because of that love amen but they're going just because they have to show off to show up their presence amen that's the reason why people come late their church amen because they don't come with that love amen that's the reason why people don't sing as loud as they can at church amen because it's no longer with that love that they do it amen it's just a something that they have to show off the appearance that the pastor saw me today at church I have a specific place where I sit so I have to be there if people see me missing they will come and start calling me so I have just to show up amen but we have to do it with love amen remember when you were when you were once saved or when you just receive the holy spirit amen you were serving God with love amen missing church for you was compared to death amen you were praying all the time reading your Bible all the time amen fasting all the time amen so now the question years how long has it been since you've done it amen how is your walk with Christ right now amen are you going up or are you going down amen taking too much responsibilities amen that you are not forced to work much bunch of overtimes amen that's making you come to church late and when you come you as sleep sleeping because you don't have enough time to rest amen but we have to start taking it very seriously amen coming to church has to be as if you're going to meet a president amen if you go meet Donald Trump or Joe Biden Donald Trump Jo Biden amen you will make sure that you have your best dress on you make sure that you are on your best behaviors and you're behaving yourself accordingly but how do we treat God how do we treat him it's not because we're not seeing many death in our family that that means that God is pleased with our behaviors other trials and some of the tests that we go through it's because of our own behaviors and our disrespect to God Amen in the message law or Grace paragraph 63 paragraph 63 the prophet here says that now we ought to come to church with the highest reverence the highest of reverence we are to enter enter we have to enter the church like real saint of God walk over and take our position and keep our minds on Christ we are to forsake everything of the world like that and if you are really born again he said that this may cut just a little bit but you know this is the House of Correction if you are really born of the spirit of God that's where your heart lays amen your thought is your thought is anchored Yonder amen we have to come to church with a highest of reverence Amen to enter the church like real Sint of God Amen to come to church with higher of reverence amen it doesn't mean that you start getting ready when your alarm sounds at 8:00 a.m. or whenever you wake up but we have to start with the preparation amen if you have to go to a football game to go see Messi for your first time or to go see uh Steph Curry play basketball for your first first time you will not start to get ready the day of the game amen you will have to make sure that you buy your jersey beforeand and bring all the songs and prepare all the songs learn all the songs that people will be singing at the stadium amen you will get ready before the game or days before the game amen it's the same thing we have to do with church amen to start getting ready before we come to church amen Saturday night amen put yourself away amen start meditating amen expecting what God will do for you when you get there amen the prophet says if the Christians could come to church as prepared as all the preachers amen other people will be receiving healing every time they come amen all your needs will be provided amen because you coming prepared amen with an expectation but today so sadly people come to church without an expectation amen they just go to church because we have to go to church amen they don't even think about God before that amen they'll be doing something else amen contrary to the word and then just jump and shower and come straight to church without preparing themselves but the prophet said that we have to come to church with the highest of reverence amen enter the church like real sints amen this doesn't mean that you have to be all stiff and not not smiling or laughing or not smiling or you know having your Bible in your shoulder and walking like somebody who's about to die no no amen but you have to come with real sense which means that you know inside of you it's clear of all impurity Amen Let the inside of you reflect what is out well let the the outside reflects what is inside amen because it doesn't matter it doesn't benefit you to look holy when inside of you you're not holy amen so how can we respect God and honor God at church amen in the message God hiding himself in Simplicity then revealing himself in the same paragraph 26 and this is giving few rules that we have to respect the church it's saying that and now this may seem a little rude but it's not a place to visit it's talking about the church it's a place of worship we should never even murmur a word inside of [Music] here outside of worship to one another we should we should never even murmur a word inside of here outside of worship to one another unless it's absolutely necessary see we should never rally around we should never run through the building or let our children run through the building Amen to jump he said that the Tabernacle folks uh uh knows know this that this building is going to be dedicated to the service of the almighty so therefore dedicating ourselves let's remember when we enter the that Sanctuary keep still to one another and worship God Amen it says that we should never rally around we should never run through the building or let our children run through the building amen this one I know this because I sit in the back there and when you see in the back there you see kids running in and out of the church amen it's not good amen because we're not supposed to be running a church inside of this building so meaning that every parent have to be responsible for their kids here in this building amen the same way you where you bring your kids here in this building the same way you have to make sure that those kids stay with you all the time amen not to let them run in and out of the church as as if it's a playground amen because this is a place of worship amen amen when we enter the sanctuary the prophet say keep still to one another and worship God Amen so when those kids run in and out amen that do that disrupt the the the the work of the holy spirit amen it's distracting the people people who are sitting right next to you amen and sometimes it's also disrupting the preacher who's preaching amen so it's not a good thing because we have to respect God Amen we have to honor him and we have to fear Him which means that we also have to respect this building when we come here another way for us to show respect to [Music] God Amen is to respect this building as well amen the prophet continues in paragraph 32 of the same message he says now there's there are little children little babies they don't know no different the only way they can get what they want is cry for it and sometimes it's a drink of water and sometimes they need attention and so we have by the grace of God dedicated a room room it was called a cry room but it's right straight in front of me amen Jump by next paragraph 33 it says that now it never bothers me maybe me here at the pulpit maybe I won't even notice it but there is other people sitting near and it bothers them see they come here to hear the service amen for us amen those rooms I mean they're outside there amen we don't have a specific room but outside there you'll see those three uh little closets for change B babies and stuff amen it says that sometimes they need a drink of water and babies sometimes they need to eat but they're not supposed to be eating inside of this place amen if they need to eat amen you can take your baby and you go outside and you feel free to feed the baby and just make sure after you do that you clean after you amen because we did not hire someone to clean the church we don't have someone that we hired officially to clean the church that we pay monthly for the for cleaning the church and also we are adult I don't think that anybody would love if somebody comes to your home and start throwing things everywhere and you'll be happy with it you will never like it because you want your house to be clean you want your house to be in order you don't want trash everywhere amen so is this is the house of God and this is how how God wants it amen our God is a god of order amen Our God doesn't like when things are not in order so which includes taking care of this building as well amen it's good to bring candies for your kids amen when they're hungry you give them chips and and whatever they do eat amen you cannot punish the kid to stay hungry for three 3 hours or two hours however the service will last but just make sure when you do that amen it's not inside of this this Sanctuary this place here it's outside there and when you do that clean after yourself amen don't wait until a brother or sister will tell you to clean up but be responsible amen and clean up after yourself that will make the life easier for everybody Amen to continue again he said in paragraph 42 he said that as soon as the service is dismissed leave the auditorium because you're through you're through in the worship then then go out and talk to one another and whatever you want to do if you got something that you want to talk to somebody to see them well you go with them to their home do you go with them or to their home or whatever it is but don't do it in the in the auditorium theori let's dedicate this to God see this is a meeting this this is his meeting place amen where we meet with him and the Lord Goes Forth from the sanctuary of course I believe that that will be pleasing to our Heavenly Father amen this is a meeting place his meeting place amen this is where we meet with him amen this is where he comes and he talks to us so when we are done I believe the pastor told us um believe couple Sundays ago since uh it's no longer it's not cold outside anymore amen we were advised to leave the to completely leave the building to go outside because when we stand there and we talk sometimes people stay here to pray or to meditate or to do whatever they want to do with God Amen we still hear people laughing and and talking and and shouting here in this build and sometimes it it it it's very hard to connect when you're praying because you still hearing people people's voices so we were told to leave this building completely amen by this Auditorium this place here amen it's a place where we meet with him amen that's the reason he was dedicated for that for that purpose amen where God will come and have the preeminence amen where God will come and have the authority where God will come and talk to us amen that's the purpose of this place amen if we turn again to Christ is the mystery of God revealed paragraph 84 amen the prophet says here the reason why I'm reading a lot here I don't want it to come from me alone to people think that this is coming just for me or brother Isaac just wanted to say this I wanted to show you to this is what the prophet himself was sing in his church that's those are the orders that he was placing in the church so we also have to respect it so paragraph 84 he says and now you've got tapes on that you've got tips on what we believe you've got tapes on disciplines uh in the church how we behave ourselves in the Church of God how we got to come here together and sit together in Heavenly places he said don't stay home if God is in your heart you can't hardly wait for them doors to open out y to get to get in here to fellowship with your brothers if you don't feel that way then I tell you it's time for you to go it's time you got to praying amen it says that we've got tapes on discipline in the church well you say well brother Isaac we live in a time of Grace which means that there is no laws and and stuff yes but there is still discipline amen the way we have to behave ourselves and in the Church of God Amen and that shows the respect to God because when we don't behave properly it's disres respecting God and when we do disrespect God there is a curse that will come after remember one day brother Bram was preaching and then two young men two young couples started kissing inside of the church amen and God told Brother brandham to say something whatever he will say will come to to pass amen because they were disrespecting God's presence amen when we come here we're supposed to have one Focus amen our mind is supposed to be on one thing which is God and His word amen and God is God is uh uh requiring God God is requiring us to respect him to honor him and to fear Him amen when we serve him we have to respect him we have to honor him we have to fear Him amen let's turn to Malachi chapter 1 verse 6 to verse 8 amen preaching this amen everybody is included me me me as well myself as well amen because sometimes it happen that you start taking those things for granted amen you come later Church it becomes a habit amen amen we just need God's grace to help us amen Mal chter 1 verse 6 to verse 8 it says that a son honor his father servant his master if then I be a father where is my honor if I I be a master where is my fear sayth the lord of hosts unto you oh priest that despised my name and he said wherein have we despised thy name verse seven you offer polluted bread upon my Altar and you say wherein have we polluted thee in that say the table of the Lord is content contable if you offer the blind for sacrifice is it not evil and if you offer the lame and sick is it not evil now the Bible says that offer it now unto th Governor will it be pleased with thee or accept that person see the Lord of hosts a son honth his father and a master honor and and a servant honor his master if I the Lord be a father where is my honor if I the Lord be a master where is my fear where is my respect where is my honor sayth the Lord you offering blind sacrifices you offering the lame and sick offer it onto the governor will he be pleased with thee or accept th person say the Lord of host you see well brother Isaac we don't offer animals Lambs anymore how can I offer a a blind lamb or a sick lamb to God Romans 12:1 it says that your body is a sacrifice offer your body as a as a living SA sacrifice to God he said that I beseech you therefore Brethren by the mercies of God that you present your body as a Living Sacrifice holy and acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service amen offering your living body as offering your bodies as a Living Sacrifice amen this doesn't mean that you have to kill yourself no but the way you serve him that is offering your living body as a living your living body as a Living Sacrifice so how do you do that do you do it with love or you do it just just because you have to do it how do you praise God do you praise him with love or you praise him just because you have to praise him he says that if I am your father where is my honor if I am your master we call him our lord lord means Master but where is my fear where is my honor where is my respect the sacrifices that you giving me if you offer it to your Governor is he going to be happy with you is he going to be pleased with you amen those are questions that we have to ask ourselves and examine ourselves if the if if a president will not be happy with the way we're treating God if we treat the president the way we're treating God right now if and if he's not going to be happy which means that we have to change amen we have to do better because Christianity it's not just a name Christianity it's a life amen your life is the thing is the one that determines that you're a Christian amen calling yourself Christian doesn't change anything amen calling yourself message believer or if and if you can call yourself Brandon I doesn't change anything but is your life worth of that name amen if you had to died today are you ready amen those are questions that we have to ask ourselves amen what do we do with God what do we do with his house what do we do with the word that we hear Amen in Ezekiel chapter 33 I believe amen but God was telling Ezekiel he said that people are excited coming to hear you not because they want to do what you're telling them to do but because your sermon is sounding as a sweet music to their ears amen you will see the pastor or any preachers coming here preaching hard and we go home we forget about everything amen those sermons has become a habit amen we don't even pay attention to it amen he has become sweet music to our ears and we're wondering why our lives are not going forward amen it's because we Mock and disrespect God by serving him with negligence amen because lack of Love creates negligence when you're not doing something with love amen you will be negligent amen you just doing it because you have to do it I'm just preaching because I have to preach I'm leading the songs Just because I have to lead the songs I'm coming to church just because I have to come to church singing or clapping my hands just because I have to there is no love behind amen first Thessalonians chapter 5 verse 12 to13 amen and not the word to respect God is also to respect his servant amen first Thessalonians chapter 5 no let's read uh uh let's read the prophet first before we do that in the message respect paragraph 165 respect paragraph 165 the prophet said that if you can't respect the man respect the office he holds in God that's exactly right see respect him if a minister comes up your pastor always respect I've heard congregations talk about their pastor how just talk about him ruin him down ridicule him how is that Pastor ever going to do anything for you I don't say this church but I mean churches I have seen you've got to love your pastor you've got to know that he is a human being but yet God has made him his Pastor the go the Holy Ghost has made him overseer then you've got to respect him in that manner and no matter what the pastor doing if you respect him in your heart as God's servant God will respect you for doing it amen Prophet said that now he's hearing people church members gossiping against their pastors ruining him down ridiculing him amen he says that we're not supposed to do it amen if he's a servant of God and if he's your pastor amen you have to respect him no matter what the pastor has done if you respect him in your heart as God's servant God will respect you for doing it amen a pastor's mistake is not a way for you to start talking against him or or or starting and starting gossiping against him amen the prophet said that he's a human being which means that he has mistakes but God made him his Pastor God made him an overseer which means that he has we will have to respond he will have to it will be accountable for your soul so no matter what he has done if you like it or not amen it's not a reason for you to start gossiping against him it's not a reason for you to just to start talking against him to run him down or to ridicule him amen but you have to respect him in your heart as God's servant and God will respect you for doing it amen this is the prophet himself telling us to do it amen it's not brother Brooks coming here and requiring you to respect him amen it's not Brother Sam coming here and telling you to respect him and respect it doesn't mean that every time you see him you see him amen you have to behave like somebody who has no water in his body it's all dried [Music] up no that's no longer dis that's no longer that's no longer respect but that's being afraid of somebody amen but respect him with your actions amen it doesn't mean that you have to start carrying his Bible around or his suits or whatever amen but you have to respect him with your actions amen him being there or not Amen in his presence or not amen you have to respect him amen when other people are starting talking about him against him what do you do do you join him or you defend him amen you have to respect your pastor 1 Thessalonians 5:1 12-13 and we beseech you this is Paul talking we besit you Brethren to know them which labor among you and are over you in the Lord and admonish you and to esteem them very highly in love for their work's sake and be at peace among yourselves he said that to esteem them very highly in love for their work sake amen many of us here if I ask and people are being honest amen if if I ask and people are being honest amen I'm not asking you guys to raise your hands on even some of us do not consider brother Brooks as our pastor because some of us still have other pastors or whatever choice you have to make that's fine amen because a pastor you have to choose him yourself amen but still you have to respect the man or you have to respect the office that that person holds it doesn't mean because you don't see him as your pastor you have the green light to treat him the way you see pleased amen you have to respect him as as a servant of God and God will bless you for doing so amen same thing with the church amen it's not because you have chosen Higher Ground to be your church that you have to come and behave the way you want or show up whenever you feel like showing up amen it still is the house of the Lord amen God still comes here and bless people amen God still comes in this building and speaks to us amen the presence of the Lord is still in this place amen so for you have to respect this house because it's a house of the Lord whether it be your church or not whether it be your church or not and we have to do the same thing to every Church where we go and to every pastors or to every Servants of God that we see amen no matter what they're doing amen we have to respect them because of what they're doing for Hebrews chapter 13:1 17 says here obey them that have the rule over you and submit yourselves for the watch over your souls for the watch for your souls as they that must give account that they may do it with joy and not with grief for that is unprofitable for you have to do it with joy not with grief because when they're doing it with grief it's not profitable for you but they have to do it with joy and the way to somebody would do his work with joy amen it's if he's feeling that he's not doing that work in vain amen he's having help everywhere amen it's like Moses God told Moses that in this battle the victory will be will be based on you how strong you are go to the mountain and start praying every time your hands will be up in the air the victory will be in the camp and when you take your hands down defeat will come amen Moses was old amen obviously was the pastor of his church but he couldn't do that work by himself amen he needed people to hold his hands Amen to keep those hands up amen for them to have the victory amen same thing with the church amen the pastor is one person amen he can do all the works by himself amen he needs us Amen to hold his hands for us to have the victory amen because he will go out of his way to fast for you amen he will go out of all of his way to pray for you or or be away from his family just for you to receive a word so we have to respect that work amen we have to all respect that work and God will bless us by doing so Amen in first Thessalonians where we just read the last part the Bible say that and peace be among yourselves peace be among yourselves amen if I ask a question I don't need people to answer are we at peace with everybody we talk to everybody in this room can we have a fellowship with everybody in this this room do we even know everybody's name in this room I'm guilty of that because I don't I don't know everybody's name I talk to everybody but I don't know everybody's name amen but it says here that peace be among yourself amen are we at peace with everybody do we talk to everybody in the church order message paragraph n the prophet here is saying and remember God is looking to me to see what uh uh to see that I state in the word and I am looking to you to see that you carry out the word see you carry out the word in this church and keep it spiritual for remember all the forces of the dark kingdom of Satan will be turned against you as you begin to grow in the Lord and you must be soldiers not just fresh recruits but soldiers you aged soldiers now amen cuz if I ask everybody here how long there have been the message it's been years for the majority of us at least amen so you're aged soldiers now and being trained to fight and Satan will come among you cause you to dispute with one another if he can the prophet said I turn him down just immediately because you are Brethren and he is the enemy amen he will come to cause you to dispute with one another he knows very well that a United House never goes ahead I mean but a house that's not United will never go ahead amen for us to work in full power we have to work as one because if we have we have sick people in this place amen we have people with needs amen how can we pray in one Accord amen if I don't talk to Brothers Frank amen how can we pray in one Accord amen if me and brother Frank have problems that have not been resolved yet amen the prophet said that the devil will come at you will come among you cause you to dispute with one another he said turn him down just immediately Amen in the message adoption adoption uh uh number one paragraph 54 amen he says I think it's it has a different ttle in French it says that there there is where the church is failing today on that walk do you know that even your own behavior can knock somebody else out of getting healed the your your misbehavior of unconfessed sin of you Believers can cause this church to bitterly fail and at that day of the Judgment you will be responsible for every bit of it or you say well wait a minute brother brandham well that's the truth think of it amen that every that you know that that your behavior can knock somebody else out of getting [Music] healed your misbehavior your unconfessed sin can cause this church to bitterly fail so which means that every one of us we have a responsibility for this church to go ahead it's not only the pastor's job it's not only the preacher's job amen we doing our work amen deprive oursel from sleep Amen to get ready to hear the word of God so that we can come and preach you are you doing your work because the prophet here is giving charge to every Believers it says that your behavior can cause this church to bitterly fail amen Matthew 5: 23- 24 amen here you will see that there's reconciliation before offering amen you Matthew 5 verse 23 to 24 the Bible says that therefore if thou bring bring thy gift to The Altar and there rememberest that thy brother has out against thee leave there thy gift before the Altar and go thy way first be reconciled with to thy brother and then come and offer thy gift when you coming with your prayers amen you have needs you need healing for your family amen you need a new job amen everybody every one of us do have need and remember that your brother has ought against you the Bible is telling us to leave it to the altar leave that prayer leave that gift go find your brother fix it first then you can come you remember the prophet talks the story um I'm finishing here the prophet is talking about telling the story of a couple amen they were about to divorce because they just couldn't leave with each other amen so in divorce they went to they had to split everything 5050 so the prophet says that they went to their house they sold their house first amen they split the money then they're started going through their belongings the wife took whatever that was hers and the husband took his so it happened that they had a baby who passed away so when they were looking for when they were taking their belongings they saw a single shoe of that baby so the the wife wanted to take it the husband also wanted to take it because that shoe belong to the both of them because the both of them have that that memory of that baby who passed away amen they didn't want to let go of that memory so when they sold their shoes when they sold they saw they saw that the shoe wondering who would take it then they came to themselves they started crying they started weeping asking themselves what are we doing right now amen the prophet says and and then they got to they got back together the prophet said the thing that got them back together is because they have had one thing in common amen that was important than their misunderstanding or their their uh uh uh um you know things that they weren't getting along with amen they had one thing in common and they didn't want to let it go so that one thing in common got them back together amen we call ourselves Christian the B the Bible said that we have one spirit amen we have one body we have one head amen which is the Lord Jesus Christ amen so that has to be a reason amen for us to get back together amen it doesn't matter what the what the brother did to you amen it doesn't matter what the sister did to you amen no matter how bad it was amen just because you are a member of the same family amen having one parent I mean one father one Spirit one body amen that should be the only the reason for you to get back together amen if we can't apply it to this church amen you have one church amen one Community this community amen you all are members of Higher Ground Tabernacle amen this supposed to be a reason for us to get together amen it's supposed be a reason for us to get along Amen to fellowship with one another amen what is that sin or what is that thing that the brother did or the sister did that is very very very hard for you to forgive to forget I mean to forgive amen Peter asked God asked Jesus he said Jesus the Lord tells us to forgive seven times till seven times is that correct I mean in a day to to forgive s till seven time and Jesus answered him he said that until seven times but but no he said that until 70 * 7 70 time seven in one day amen even if you take that 70 times seven away you just take that seven times a that will be enough for you to forgive your brother amen if Jesus Christ amen the purpose of of him being here on Earth was to say us but we treating him as a chief of demons we called him names we crucified him with thieves amen we treat we treated him of no value but still he forgave us he said father forgive them what about us Steven amen he was there to bring a message but the same people that stoned him to death his last word father forgive them are you being stoned to death no you're still alive so what can't you forgive I know it's hard we have feelings sometimes we get hurt but at the end of the day we're still members of the same family you know in a family brothers and sisters we can fight hurt ourselves sometimes we don't even talk for days but at the end of the day we'll come together and fix it as a family amen the prophet says here how can you hate your brother who do you see or despise him and you say you love God who you don't see who you have not seen he says that you become a liar and the truth is not in you but when we come to a place where the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us from all sin then we are brothers then there is no difference in us our little old brins that we have tracked on us don't mean a thing because we all been cleansed by the blood of Christ amen he washed us with his blood Amen in closing I'll read in Psalms chapter 73 verse 26 Psalm 73: 26 this is David prayers here David saying my flesh and my heart faileth uh May Fail My Flesh and my heart May FL May Fail but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever amen as a human being we do fail we do sin we do make mistakes our flesh and our hearts fail but God is the strength of our heart and our portion forever amen and here and he's come he's here this is the prophet and he's come he's here I know he is let's make him welcome with a
