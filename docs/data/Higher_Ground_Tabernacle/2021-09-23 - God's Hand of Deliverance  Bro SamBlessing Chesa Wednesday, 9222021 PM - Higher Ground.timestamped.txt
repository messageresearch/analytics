[53:45] second chronicles chapter 7 verse 14.
[54:08] if my people which are called by my name
[54:12] shall humble themselves and pray
[54:15] and seek my face
[54:17] and turn from their wicked ways
[54:19] then will i hear from heaven
[54:22] amen
[54:35] not only here
[54:51] down to our rescue there is open bibles
[54:54] to the book of james chapter 5
[54:56] verse 15.
[54:59] james chapter 5
[55:02] verse 15
[55:04] 15
[56:15] which are called by my name
[56:17] if they shall humble themselves and pray
[56:20] and seek my face
[56:22] and turn from their wicked ways
[56:25] then will i hear from heaven and i will
[56:28] forgive this and will heal their land
[56:30] he said i'm not a deaf god i'm not a god
[56:33] that is made by hands but i will hear
[56:36] and i will answer your prayer i will
[56:38] heal your land amen
[56:41] so speaking on god's hand of deliverance
[56:43] and when we when we read in the book of
[56:45] james
[56:46] is writing and he's telling us that
[56:48] effectual feminine prayer of the
[56:50] righteous man availeth much so prayer is
[56:53] a
[56:54] is a tool that god plays in the hands of
[56:56] man
[57:10] it is that channel that
[57:12] god made a provision for his children
[57:15] the people who are called by his name we
[57:18] know we are called
[57:19] by the name of god
[57:21] we are bro we are the bride of christ so
[57:24] our last name is the bride of christ we
[57:26] take the last name of our
[57:28] bridegroom of our husband amen
[57:32] by his name
[57:34] everyone knows prayer works
[57:37] in times of trouble everyone goes to
[57:39] prayer
[57:40] everyone gets religious when things when
[57:43] things go bad
[57:44] i remember the other time i was on a
[57:46] flight
[57:48] before the flight took off
[57:50] off the word prayer everyone was just up
[57:52] to the old business but then once the
[57:55] flight the plane was in the air
[57:58] we came in a storm and this was a little
[58:00] plane
[58:01] and there was a lot of turbulence when i
[58:04] looked around everyone was praying to
[58:06] god because everyone knew that
[58:09] we called on the name of god
[58:11] god can
[58:13] many times people forget to thank god
[58:16] when god
[58:17] answers their prayer
[58:20] people just want to rush to god for
[58:22] prayer because people know that prayer
[58:23] work
[58:24] amen but we know we're not supposed to
[58:26] go only to god when we need prayer when
[58:29] we need uh god to help us when we need
[58:31] god to save us
[58:33] because we know we have a relationship
[58:35] with god
[58:36] when you are praying it's just not a
[58:38] one-way communication you are just
[58:41] sending words but we know pray it's
[58:43] talking to god
[58:44] when you are right there in that channel
[58:46] when god speaks back to you you can get
[58:49] off from there knowing that i have a
[58:50] word from the lord i heard him speak to
[58:53] me so you can get off from there with
[58:56] confidence and you say god told me this
[58:59] because you were not just kneeling there
[59:01] mattering a lot of words but you know
[59:03] you had that relationship with god when
[59:06] you speak he hears you and when he speak
[59:10] you hear him too
[59:12] the prophet of god tells us this he says
[59:14] pray is not a perhaps
[59:15] prayer is a sincere thing prayer is
[59:18] talking to god
[59:20] pray is not just getting down shut your
[59:22] eyes and thinking about your washing or
[59:24] your work that you're doing and say lord
[59:26] help me
[59:27] and john me and he'll miss john's and so
[59:30] forth that's not prayer
[59:32] that's repeating some words but prayer
[59:35] is to come into an atmosphere where you
[59:38] realize that you are in the presence of
[59:40] god and you're moving
[59:42] into deep sincerity
[59:44] first it's a worship oh jehovah how i
[59:48] love you you see it
[59:49] then after the worship of prayer then
[59:51] you come with a sincere heart asking
[59:54] that's not what many people do many
[59:56] people just come to god lord help me
[59:58] this this this and that but prayer it is
[1:00:02] you have to have a relationship with god
[1:00:04] when you come to him you worship him
[1:00:07] lord i love you lord lord thank you for
[1:00:10] the things you have done for me he he
[1:00:13] loves worship because he's a god god is
[1:00:16] an object of worship
[1:00:18] he created you and me to worship him so
[1:00:21] when you come and kneel down in prayer
[1:00:23] he wants to hear that worship he loves
[1:00:26] it he is a jealous god he does not like
[1:00:29] you worshiping other things
[1:00:30] many times we worship our phones
[1:00:33] that's the first thing you look at
[1:00:34] before you when you wake up that's the
[1:00:36] last thing you look at before you go to
[1:00:37] bed
[1:00:38] you go you have replays you have a
[1:00:40] relationship with something else that's
[1:00:42] not god and god is something that you
[1:00:44] just send a lot of words and hoping that
[1:00:46] he will answer some time but no
[1:00:49] you gotta have that relationship with
[1:00:51] god
[1:00:52] and know that when you speak
[1:00:54] he hears when he speaks back to you you
[1:00:57] hear also
[1:00:59] it is not just kneeling down in prayer
[1:01:01] you can be in prayer whilst you're
[1:01:02] walking that's right amen you were just
[1:01:05] in that presence you are just sucking
[1:01:07] that atmosphere you are having that
[1:01:09] communication you you are open to hear
[1:01:12] what god is telling you
[1:01:14] so pray is not just saying words you can
[1:01:16] be right there
[1:01:17] just meditating you are sincere focused
[1:01:20] on god and god comes down and god can
[1:01:22] speak to you just bathing just soaking
[1:01:25] that atmosphere
[1:01:27] amen
[1:01:29] the disciples came to god and said they
[1:01:31] came to jesus and say lord teach us how
[1:01:33] to pray and he told them the lord's
[1:01:36] prayer
[1:01:37] which had all the components of praying
[1:01:40] there is a worshipping of god and the
[1:01:42] most important part that i liked is it
[1:01:44] says let it be on earth as it is in
[1:01:46] heaven he was not just talking about
[1:01:50] the physical earth but this earth
[1:01:53] that lord whatever your will is in
[1:01:55] heaven may it be on us
[1:01:58] this physical this
[1:02:00] physical body which is the earth
[1:02:03] so when we are praying we are not
[1:02:04] praying just for what we want but we are
[1:02:07] praying for god's will in our lives to
[1:02:09] say lord whatever plan you have for me
[1:02:12] in in heaven may you make it manifest in
[1:02:15] my life because whatever you have in
[1:02:17] earth may it be whatever you have in
[1:02:20] heaven let it be to me on on earth this
[1:02:24] uh physical earth
[1:02:25] like uh david said your word is
[1:02:28] established in the heavens
[1:02:30] whatever before anything happens it has
[1:02:32] to happen in heaven first before it
[1:02:34] happens on this earth
[1:02:36] so whatever you need whatever your plan
[1:02:39] is whatever god wants you to do he
[1:02:41] already has it established in heaven so
[1:02:44] when you come and pray you say lord
[1:02:46] whatever you've already established make
[1:02:49] it manifest in my life lord amen that's
[1:02:53] what we got to do when we come in prayer
[1:02:55] the prophet of god says get the fear
[1:02:57] away
[1:02:58] don't be scared that god's not going to
[1:03:00] answer your prayer that's right
[1:03:02] god's always
[1:03:04] answering prayer
[1:03:06] the works already finished
[1:03:08] and listen
[1:03:09] he is obligated
[1:03:11] he must do it he's got to do it to keep
[1:03:15] his word see notice it's a finished work
[1:03:19] he's obligated
[1:03:21] god he may not be touched with a lot of
[1:03:23] things but when you hold him onto his
[1:03:26] word he knows he's gonna make it come to
[1:03:28] pass
[1:03:29] so
[1:03:30] you know he says in his word if my
[1:03:32] people who are called by my name if you
[1:03:34] humble yourselves in prayer he says i
[1:03:36] will hear
[1:03:37] so when you do exactly that he is
[1:03:40] obligated by his own word he is tied
[1:03:44] down by his own word to come down and
[1:03:46] hear your prayer
[1:03:48] and he will come down to heal your land
[1:03:50] he will come to hear your harsh desire
[1:03:53] and he will be there to supply your need
[1:03:58] amen that's true we don't serve a poor
[1:04:00] god the bible says
[1:04:02] he will supply our needs according to
[1:04:04] his riches in glory so i know whatever i
[1:04:07] need he is able to do it the prophet of
[1:04:10] god says god is willing to bankrupt
[1:04:13] heaven just to make sure
[1:04:15] that
[1:04:16] your need comes to pass amen
[1:04:19] so i know god is rich and i don't i
[1:04:22] don't i don't have a need that god
[1:04:24] cannot fulfill i haven't all my needs he
[1:04:27] can fulfill it
[1:04:29] he is not going to have to to to to
[1:04:31] pluck off the pearl gates and sell them
[1:04:33] so he can supply your needs but if he
[1:04:35] has to do it he's got to do it because
[1:04:37] he's got to supply your need so i'm
[1:04:39] standing you stand there rest assured
[1:04:42] knowing that when you pray
[1:04:43] it is a done deal
[1:04:45] it is just a matter of time until god
[1:04:48] answers your prayer
[1:04:50] amen because he is obligated he must do
[1:04:53] it he's got to do it to keep his word
[1:04:56] now it's a finished work he has a god
[1:04:59] that has a reputation that he never
[1:05:01] fails he never failed before so he's not
[1:05:04] going to start today
[1:05:06] so i can stay rest assured knowing that
[1:05:08] he has done it before he has done it
[1:05:10] over and over again so he's going to do
[1:05:13] it for me he has done it for all those
[1:05:15] people who pray to him will humble
[1:05:17] themselves and pray
[1:05:19] how are you any different he is going to
[1:05:21] come through for you amen
[1:05:23] we read in the bible of esther
[1:05:26] who prayed
[1:05:27] when she was in a hot spot
[1:05:29] she knew that
[1:05:31] all the jews were supposed to be killed
[1:05:33] and she knew that there was only one way
[1:05:36] out that was fasting and praying and the
[1:05:39] power of her prayer
[1:05:41] turned a decree that was meant to kill
[1:05:44] her and all the jewish people but she
[1:05:47] said i'm fasting if i perish i perish i
[1:05:51] am going in to see the king
[1:05:53] before she went in to see the king she
[1:05:56] fasted went and wearing sackcloth and
[1:05:59] she was there fasting and praying
[1:06:01] because she knew that the god of abraham
[1:06:03] isaac and jacob is a god that he is
[1:06:06] prayer
[1:06:07] amen she was a praying girl she was a
[1:06:10] she was a praying because she knew what
[1:06:12] the word says so she knew that
[1:06:14] if we humble ourselves if we pray to god
[1:06:18] he is going to hear from heaven and he
[1:06:21] will answer our need it doesn't matter
[1:06:23] what haman had already orchestrated and
[1:06:26] brought so that they could die but the
[1:06:29] power of prayer turned around that
[1:06:31] decree and made the king to to to to go
[1:06:35] against his own law because the queen
[1:06:38] was not allowed to come in unless the
[1:06:39] king had summoned her but because of her
[1:06:42] prayer
[1:06:43] that prayer kept her all the way going
[1:06:45] to the king and offering her
[1:06:48] supplication to say we there is an enemy
[1:06:50] who wants us killed and that prayer
[1:06:53] protected her going to the king
[1:06:56] that same prayer turned may the king
[1:06:59] turn around the decree and get the enemy
[1:07:02] killed instead
[1:07:04] so when esther and all the jewish people
[1:07:07] the israelites when they came down to
[1:07:08] pray
[1:07:09] god heard their prayer
[1:07:11] he came and he turned it around the
[1:07:13] enemy that wanted to kill
[1:07:16] the jewish people the enemy that wanted
[1:07:18] to kill esther and mordecai he's the one
[1:07:21] who ended up being hun on his own
[1:07:23] gallows
[1:07:24] that's what the power of prayer was
[1:07:27] amen it sent the curse back to the
[1:07:30] sender
[1:07:30] whatever what he wanted to do to them it
[1:07:33] ended up happening to him so we know
[1:07:35] when we pray
[1:07:37] the curse whatever satan wants to do to
[1:07:39] us god is accumulating him he's waiting
[1:07:42] he's going to do the same thing to satan
[1:07:44] he's sending the curse back to satan
[1:07:47] amen
[1:07:49] all we just have to do is pray and know
[1:07:52] that god hears our prayer prophet god
[1:07:54] says god is not known
[1:07:57] by genealogy or by theology god is known
[1:08:01] by neology that's where god is known by
[1:08:04] you don't find god by studying books you
[1:08:07] find god on your knees that's where you
[1:08:10] find them it doesn't matter you may read
[1:08:12] the bible from from from from cover to
[1:08:15] cover but if you don't have that
[1:08:17] relationship with god you are wasting
[1:08:19] your time
[1:08:20] and you gather relationship by praying
[1:08:23] to god
[1:08:25] the other time someone was telling
[1:08:26] brother branham he's you know saying you
[1:08:28] don't know the word but he says yeah i
[1:08:30] may not know all the word but i know the
[1:08:31] author
[1:08:32] that's what matters because whenever you
[1:08:35] need the word the author is going to
[1:08:37] drop it right in your heart whenever you
[1:08:40] need it because you have that
[1:08:42] relationship because this is god in
[1:08:45] letter form
[1:08:46] john says in the beginning was the word
[1:08:49] and the word was with god and the word
[1:08:52] was god so we know we are reading god
[1:08:55] expressed in the letter form so when we
[1:08:58] read the word and have that relationship
[1:09:01] we become invincible
[1:09:03] when you pray you know nothing can stand
[1:09:06] before you
[1:09:07] because you have the power you are
[1:09:09] standing on that solid ground that
[1:09:12] foundation of jesus amen of the word
[1:09:16] itself
[1:09:18] amen it is by neology
[1:09:21] not theology
[1:09:22] amen
[1:09:26] hallelujah we also read of a man we know
[1:09:28] hezekiah hezekiah he was a king and
[1:09:32] the israelites they were in trouble
[1:09:34] there's this king called sennacherib he
[1:09:36] wrote a letter and he says i am coming
[1:09:38] to destroy you and he put in evidence of
[1:09:42] all the kings that he had destroyed
[1:09:44] before and he sent to hezekiah says look
[1:09:47] at what we did to that king and this was
[1:09:50] not a lie this was something that had
[1:09:52] happened
[1:09:53] and a messenger came to king hezekiah
[1:09:56] and brought it to him and when hezekiah
[1:09:58] was looking at it that those were facts
[1:10:01] were saying remember that king we
[1:10:03] destroyed him that king we destroyed him
[1:10:06] that king we destroyed him and sanaka
[1:10:09] rip said you as well i'm coming to
[1:10:12] destroy you and that was a fact hezekiah
[1:10:15] he knew better
[1:10:17] he knew that there was only one way out
[1:10:19] he wasn't putting his trust in the army
[1:10:21] or himself but he knew that if i go to
[1:10:24] the temple
[1:10:26] and humble myself if i kneel down to
[1:10:29] prayer god from heaven he's gonna hear
[1:10:31] my prayer and he will answer it so he
[1:10:34] went with that letter to the temple and
[1:10:36] he set it down and he said lord
[1:10:39] listen to what this king is saying but
[1:10:41] now this king
[1:10:43] overcame these other kings
[1:10:45] because he had his trust in gods that
[1:10:48] they were made
[1:10:49] man-made gods
[1:10:51] gods that cannot hear and he had his
[1:10:53] trust in those gods when he did when he
[1:10:56] had these victories
[1:10:57] now hezekiah
[1:10:59] look
[1:11:00] this man did this with these uh gods
[1:11:03] that do not have
[1:11:04] that that are made by man
[1:11:07] gods that are that are
[1:11:09] made by wood that are made by carpenters
[1:11:11] but he said look my god is different
[1:11:14] we serve a living god a god who hears a
[1:11:18] god who is alive a god who he is a god
[1:11:22] who talks that's why he had that
[1:11:24] confidence when he went and laid that
[1:11:27] letter in the temple and says lord look
[1:11:29] at what this blasphemous man is saying
[1:11:33] he wants to come and destroy us but he
[1:11:35] knew he said lord i have my trust in you
[1:11:38] that's why god he says i have my
[1:11:40] covenant with my people
[1:11:42] he heard hezekiah's prayer and he
[1:11:45] listened and he came down and he
[1:11:47] destroyed sennacherib in his own country
[1:11:50] before he even camp they didn't even
[1:11:52] have to fight him but because hezekiah's
[1:11:55] prayer effectual fervent prayer reached
[1:11:58] god and god said i will answer your
[1:12:01] prayer
[1:12:02] and god gave it to him
[1:12:04] so that's what we got to do
[1:12:06] come to god
[1:12:08] whatever problem you have come lay it
[1:12:11] on the altar
[1:12:13] you don't have it doesn't have to be the
[1:12:14] fist this physical altar it can be the
[1:12:16] altar of your home whenever you have a
[1:12:19] problem lay it down before god say lord
[1:12:22] look what this men are saying look what
[1:12:25] these people are saying but i know you
[1:12:28] are a greater god
[1:12:30] you are a mighty god you are a conqueror
[1:12:32] god is able to hear your prayer god is
[1:12:35] able to come
[1:12:36] and deliver you from your situation if
[1:12:39] the doctor gives you a report in his
[1:12:42] and you don't like it you say lord
[1:12:44] look what
[1:12:47] being said right here saying i have
[1:12:49] demons in my body but i don't want it
[1:12:52] you go lay it down right before god god
[1:12:54] is able to change that report because
[1:12:57] he's a god who listens if the if the
[1:13:00] doctor gives you a report that says
[1:13:01] you're covet positive go bring it right
[1:13:04] to god and say lord he's saying it's
[1:13:06] positive but i want it negative god is
[1:13:08] able to turn it around and he can heal
[1:13:11] you if they say you have cancer they're
[1:13:13] giving you six months to live
[1:13:16] you just bring it to god
[1:13:18] lay it in front of god god is able to
[1:13:20] reverse it he is able to turn it around
[1:13:23] because he is a god who listens he is a
[1:13:26] god who he is prayer amen amen
[1:13:30] the prophet god says and when men and
[1:13:32] women quit looking at their sicknesses
[1:13:34] they quit looking at their diseases and
[1:13:36] started looking to what god said about
[1:13:38] it he'll take over
[1:13:40] all things are subject to jesus christ
[1:13:43] and all things are subject to you in
[1:13:46] prayer amen when you ask in his name and
[1:13:49] believe i'll read that again he says all
[1:13:52] subject all things are subject to jesus
[1:13:54] christ
[1:13:55] and all things are subject to you
[1:13:59] in prayer
[1:14:00] when you ask in his name and believe so
[1:14:04] when you kneel down to prayer you have
[1:14:07] that authority god has placed that
[1:14:10] authority that all things are subject to
[1:14:13] you
[1:14:14] whatever situation you are praying for
[1:14:17] whatever disease that's troubling you or
[1:14:20] whatever affliction that's coming after
[1:14:22] you it is subject to you in prayer so
[1:14:25] when you kneel down you commit that
[1:14:28] issue to god you know that that thing is
[1:14:31] subject to you you have power over it
[1:14:34] he says ask what you will in my name and
[1:14:37] it will be done that's right
[1:14:39] whatsoever things you desire when you
[1:14:41] pray
[1:14:42] just believe you receive it and you
[1:14:45] shall have it
[1:14:46] god said so it is in his word his word
[1:14:49] never fails so you know if he said i
[1:14:52] shall have it it means i shall have it
[1:14:55] because he says it in his word so let
[1:14:58] nothing stand in your way stop looking
[1:15:00] at things you're looking at here
[1:15:02] look at the unseen amen god said we
[1:15:05] could do it so so long god say that
[1:15:08] that's all that matters
[1:15:10] god said it i believe it that settles it
[1:15:14] so you stop looking at the symptoms or
[1:15:17] what your eyes are showing you or what
[1:15:19] your eyes are not showing you
[1:15:21] look at the unseen
[1:15:23] look at what god said in his word amen
[1:15:27] stop looking at what your sight is
[1:15:29] telling you or not telling you
[1:15:31] that is a lie that's a lying vanity
[1:15:34] amen god said heaven and earth shall
[1:15:36] pass away but my word
[1:15:38] shall never pass away
[1:15:40] so you stop looking what sight is
[1:15:43] telling you but you start looking at
[1:15:45] what faith is telling you faith does not
[1:15:47] look at anything else it just looks
[1:15:50] straight and focused on what god says
[1:15:52] amen amen look at those are the 12 spies
[1:15:55] when they were sent into canaan the
[1:15:58] other 10 came back saying we cannot do
[1:15:59] it because they were relying on their
[1:16:02] sight
[1:16:02] they forgot god's promises they forgot
[1:16:05] what god has said that you this land is
[1:16:08] yours because they were listening
[1:16:11] and uh
[1:16:12] they were they they they yielded
[1:16:14] themselves to what their sight was
[1:16:16] telling them
[1:16:17] and they lost their faith and they said
[1:16:19] we cannot do it but you see joshua in
[1:16:21] caliber was not looking at that they say
[1:16:24] it doesn't matter even if they are
[1:16:25] giants
[1:16:26] god's word
[1:16:28] has
[1:16:29] is able to give us that victory against
[1:16:31] those giants
[1:16:32] it does not matter whis the word of god
[1:16:35] says that land flowed with milk and
[1:16:37] honey that's why we have seen that milk
[1:16:39] and honey so whatever that's standing in
[1:16:42] in our way we're gonna go pass through
[1:16:44] it god is going to give us the victory
[1:16:47] because it is written his word
[1:16:49] so don't look at what your side is
[1:16:51] telling you what symptoms you have
[1:16:54] god is able to take you through it just
[1:16:57] look at the unseen and look at what god
[1:16:59] said you will do the prophet god also
[1:17:02] says he says now along this journey he
[1:17:06] promised to supply everything that we
[1:17:08] need says whatsoever you ask
[1:17:11] the father in my name that i will do
[1:17:14] whatsoever things you desire when you
[1:17:17] pray
[1:17:18] believe receive it you shall have it
[1:17:21] now
[1:17:22] now he gave us the strongest weapon
[1:17:25] that there is in all the world
[1:17:28] and that's prayer
[1:17:30] prayer is what changes things at some
[1:17:33] point he says prayer is more powerful
[1:17:36] than a hydrogen and atomic bomb
[1:17:39] prayer is the most powerful weapon there
[1:17:42] is in the world
[1:17:43] and god placed that weapon in your hands
[1:17:47] he plays it in my hands so nothing can
[1:17:50] stand before us
[1:17:51] prayer is what changes things
[1:17:55] hezekiah was told that you have 15 years
[1:17:57] to live he was given no he was told that
[1:17:59] you're about to die and then he said
[1:18:01] lord i know this is what you say but he
[1:18:04] went to god with a petition because he
[1:18:06] knew god had listened to him before and
[1:18:08] destroyed the enemy and now he sees
[1:18:11] another enemy is coming in his body this
[1:18:13] disease he says if you defeated that
[1:18:15] enemy you can't defeat this enemy again
[1:18:18] and he went to god in prayer and he said
[1:18:20] lord i need more time please heal my
[1:18:23] body and his prayer before the prophet
[1:18:27] was was already gone after the prophet
[1:18:29] said he he said he came and said that
[1:18:31] says the lord before he was gone
[1:18:34] god changed his mind and he told the
[1:18:37] prophet another word and tell him and
[1:18:39] say go tell him i give him 15 more years
[1:18:42] hezekiah's prayer changed the mind of
[1:18:44] god because he knelt down he prayed and
[1:18:48] god heard his prayer so whenever you
[1:18:50] were in need
[1:18:51] god is able to change his mind for you
[1:18:55] he's able to give your harsh desires the
[1:18:57] prophet of god says the christian
[1:19:00] doesn't realize what a force he has when
[1:19:02] he kneels
[1:19:03] on his knees before the almighty god in
[1:19:06] the name of jesus
[1:19:07] he doesn't realize that he doesn't
[1:19:10] realize what power that is
[1:19:12] if people could only realize what's
[1:19:16] given unto them that anything you ask
[1:19:19] for will be given if you can appropriate
[1:19:22] that faith to believe for it because
[1:19:25] god's word is true
[1:19:27] and i like this part he says now god's
[1:19:30] word will defeat satan
[1:19:32] anywhere
[1:19:34] anyplace
[1:19:35] and any time i'll repeat that again
[1:19:38] and now god's word will defeat satan
[1:19:41] anywhere
[1:19:43] anyplace
[1:19:44] anytime it doesn't matter where you are
[1:19:48] it doesn't matter where it is it doesn't
[1:19:50] matter what time it is so long you have
[1:19:53] the word of god in your hand satan
[1:19:57] cannot stand before you doesn't matter
[1:19:59] what force he sends your way
[1:20:02] god's word is able to defeat him
[1:20:05] anywhere any place anytime
[1:20:08] his word never fails
[1:20:10] so god this is the weapon that gave god
[1:20:12] gave into our hands so that we can
[1:20:15] overcome satan
[1:20:16] it's more powerful than the atomic bomb
[1:20:19] it's more powerful than the hydrogen
[1:20:21] bomb he says god is in his word so when
[1:20:25] we stand upon the word we know we are
[1:20:27] holding on to god himself because this
[1:20:31] is god in written form amen
[1:20:33] heaven and earth shall pass away but
[1:20:35] god's word will never pass away that's
[1:20:38] why we got to stand firm on the promises
[1:20:41] of god he has never failed and he is not
[1:20:44] going to start today
[1:20:46] he has never failed
[1:20:48] the sages of old so why is he going to
[1:20:50] start failing on you today he is not
[1:20:53] going to do that he is not a man that he
[1:20:55] should lie neither is he a son of man
[1:20:58] that he should repent whatever he says
[1:21:00] he stands on it and whatever he said has
[1:21:03] to come to pass it has to come to pass
[1:21:05] amen
[1:21:07] the prophet god also says he says i love
[1:21:10] this god he says that's the death stroke
[1:21:13] to satan
[1:21:14] when a man takes god at his word he says
[1:21:18] that'll kill satan every time that's
[1:21:21] right that's a death struck to satan
[1:21:24] when you take guarded his word when you
[1:21:27] stand upon that word it says that'll
[1:21:29] kill satan every time
[1:21:32] not sometimes no
[1:21:34] but every time you take god at his word
[1:21:37] that will kill satan that will stop him
[1:21:40] dead in his tracks he cannot do you no
[1:21:43] harm whatever he has devised against you
[1:21:45] it will not work he says that's the
[1:21:48] hardest heating that satan can get when
[1:21:51] a man will take god in his word yes sir
[1:21:54] that's all you have to do
[1:21:56] take god at his word and stand right
[1:21:59] there you know god is able to come
[1:22:01] through for you it is that solid ground
[1:22:04] that when you are standing on it no one
[1:22:06] can move you
[1:22:08] nothing can move you no sickness can
[1:22:10] move you
[1:22:12] no friend can move you no trial can move
[1:22:15] you when you are standing on that solid
[1:22:18] ground
[1:22:19] when satan comes in like a flood god
[1:22:22] always raises its standard against it
[1:22:24] amen you will float in that flood so
[1:22:27] when you are floating in that flight
[1:22:28] doesn't matter how high the the flood
[1:22:30] goes you are floating right on top
[1:22:33] you will never sink
[1:22:35] you will never drown amen so we know
[1:22:38] whatever flood satan brings our way
[1:22:40] we're gonna float right on top of it it
[1:22:43] will never drown us amen
[1:22:46] just like he did for noah was talking
[1:22:48] about how he told noah to build a gothel
[1:22:51] word you know the golfer hood is made uh
[1:22:53] it's made of a material that it's it's
[1:22:55] like a sponge it's it's uh it's porous
[1:22:59] it it sucks water so god told noah to
[1:23:02] build he told noah to build an ark using
[1:23:05] that golfer word but when he was making
[1:23:08] this golf away when he was making the
[1:23:10] ark using the golfer wood people were
[1:23:12] laughing at him like that's not even a
[1:23:14] material you can use to build to build a
[1:23:16] boat but noah wasn't looking at what
[1:23:18] people were saying he was looking at the
[1:23:20] word of god and he was standing flat
[1:23:22] footed on it and god told him to go boil
[1:23:26] the evergreen tree that had the sap in
[1:23:29] it so when he would boil this golfer
[1:23:31] wood in this sap it would suck this goth
[1:23:34] this hot this hot um
[1:23:37] evergreen tree sap and it would come in
[1:23:39] and it would strengthen and solidify
[1:23:42] this god forward so this god forward it
[1:23:44] was as light as light as can be but it
[1:23:47] was a strong steel it could not drown
[1:23:50] this was god's strategy
[1:23:53] a way out for noah he knew a flood was
[1:23:55] coming but that flood was not going to
[1:23:57] sink him the prophet of god tells us
[1:23:59] that there's a mystery of this ark that
[1:24:02] this god forward is us and when if we
[1:24:04] are able to lay in the presence of god
[1:24:07] and let god fill us so that we are so
[1:24:10] full of god we know that there is no
[1:24:12] flood that can drown us there is no
[1:24:16] storm that can destroy you
[1:24:18] when you are riding you know you have
[1:24:20] god inside of you you will float on
[1:24:22] every flood
[1:24:24] no storm can break you you will crash
[1:24:26] through each and every one of them
[1:24:28] because you are standing on the promises
[1:24:30] of god you are standing flat-footed he
[1:24:33] will never fail whatever god says amen
[1:24:36] he says there is a promise that says
[1:24:39] many are the afflictions of the
[1:24:41] righteous but god delivers out of them
[1:24:44] all amen
[1:24:46] that is a promise but it's in two parts
[1:24:48] it says many other afflictions
[1:24:50] of the righteous but it doesn't end
[1:24:52] right there it says but god delivers
[1:24:56] them out of them all so all the
[1:24:59] afflictions that's going to come away
[1:25:01] they use a promise that you are going to
[1:25:03] get out of them they use a promise that
[1:25:06] you're going to overcome them and that
[1:25:08] is the word of god it never fails amen
[1:25:11] so there is a deliverance that is
[1:25:14] promised for you there is a deliverance
[1:25:16] that that is set aside for each and
[1:25:18] every trial that's coming your way
[1:25:21] because before the problem was there god
[1:25:23] already made the solution
[1:25:25] he knew you needed a way out so he
[1:25:27] already said there so whatever
[1:25:29] affliction it is from
[1:25:31] all different walks in of life when it
[1:25:33] comes your way you know that god
[1:25:36] wants to deliver you out of them all
[1:25:39] amen
[1:25:40] nothing can stand in your way when you
[1:25:43] know you are standing on the promises of
[1:25:45] god and you know with prayer
[1:25:48] you have that invincible weapon
[1:25:51] satan cannot do you no harm satan cannot
[1:25:54] move you satan cannot shake you amen
[1:25:57] and we know many tests are going to come
[1:25:59] away
[1:26:00] many afflictions many trials are going
[1:26:02] to come away but they are not going to
[1:26:04] sink us
[1:26:05] they are not going to drown us the
[1:26:07] prophet of god says
[1:26:09] he was talking about job he says and the
[1:26:11] devil was turned loose on him and he
[1:26:13] began to kill his children destroy his
[1:26:16] goods and he had some of his church
[1:26:18] members come to him and say
[1:26:20] oh you are a sacred sinner you've got
[1:26:22] something in your heart that you haven't
[1:26:24] confessed job but job know that he
[1:26:27] hadn't done it
[1:26:28] he was sure that he had met god's
[1:26:30] requirements and he stood pat on it so
[1:26:34] so long hair fulfilled god's
[1:26:36] requirements and you are standing
[1:26:38] flat-footed on the word of god it
[1:26:40] doesn't matter what comes your way
[1:26:42] doesn't matter whatever trial god allows
[1:26:45] to come your way you know god already
[1:26:47] has made a way out
[1:26:49] he says but job no he hadn't done it
[1:26:52] he knowed he had confessed his sins
[1:26:54] called for god to try him search him and
[1:26:58] see if there was anything wrong
[1:27:00] god was waiting to see what job will do
[1:27:03] because satan said i'll make him i'll
[1:27:05] make him curse you to your face
[1:27:07] so you see when job was going through
[1:27:09] his trial god allowed satan to do it
[1:27:13] god had confidence in job so when a
[1:27:16] trial comes your way you know god is
[1:27:18] already ordained because satan is not
[1:27:21] allowed to touch you unless god says go
[1:27:23] ahead and do it
[1:27:24] and when that trial comes your way
[1:27:27] god already has confidence in you that
[1:27:30] you will come out of it because he
[1:27:32] himself is the one who's gonna deliver
[1:27:34] you out of it so there is no need for
[1:27:37] you to worry there is no need for you to
[1:27:39] be dismayed whenever you're going
[1:27:42] through that test you know that god is
[1:27:44] there for you so you may feel forsaken
[1:27:48] when trial comes your way and it may
[1:27:49] seem that god has forsaken you but he is
[1:27:52] waiting for you to hold on
[1:27:55] the prophet said god was waiting to see
[1:27:57] what job will do
[1:27:58] so god is waiting to see what are you
[1:28:00] gonna do in that trial he's waiting for
[1:28:03] you to see are you gonna give up or
[1:28:05] you're gonna keep on holding on to the
[1:28:07] word waiting for him to come and deliver
[1:28:10] you as he said in his word he will
[1:28:13] hey man because you all you have to do
[1:28:16] is just stand still
[1:28:18] right there on his word god will come
[1:28:21] through and deliver you
[1:28:23] many times when we fail or god is
[1:28:26] tasting or testing our patients
[1:28:28] we start looking for alternatives you
[1:28:31] start looking at your horoscope what
[1:28:32] does my zodiac sign about me because you
[1:28:35] are giving up on the word you stop doing
[1:28:38] that just look at what god says about
[1:28:41] you you're going to look up oh what does
[1:28:43] um i i am an aquarius what what does the
[1:28:46] internet say about about me this day and
[1:28:48] you're looking for a lucky charm
[1:28:52] just focus on god just stand on the word
[1:28:55] of god
[1:28:56] god is waiting to see what you're gonna
[1:28:58] do he is just waiting for you
[1:29:01] to be patient and keep on holding on
[1:29:04] there is a deliverance that is set for
[1:29:06] you
[1:29:06] your deliverance has a date on it he is
[1:29:09] coming to deliver you amen
[1:29:11] so don't lose your focus you're going to
[1:29:14] start putting your trust in people and
[1:29:16] not in god when things start going wrong
[1:29:18] but god does not want you to do that
[1:29:21] because god is a jealousy god when
[1:29:23] people help you you're gonna start
[1:29:26] accrediting your deliverance to people
[1:29:28] and god does not want you to do that so
[1:29:31] the moment you start
[1:29:33] losing your hold on your word and you
[1:29:35] are starting to put your your trust in
[1:29:36] people know that you are headed off the
[1:29:38] wrong way but you come back focus on the

[1:29:52] might be four days late it might seem
[1:29:54] four days late to you but he is four
[1:29:56] days on time amen he knows what he is
[1:29:59] doing amen
[1:30:01] so when you feel forsaken
[1:30:03] don't worry about it know that he's
[1:30:06] right besides you he said i will be with
[1:30:08] you even in you till the end of the
[1:30:11] world so
[1:30:13] i don't have to worry because i know he
[1:30:15] is with me
[1:30:16] he is in me so it doesn't matter what
[1:30:18] things i face god is always there to
[1:30:20] pull me out amen amen i was reading this
[1:30:23] poem the footprints on the stand of time
[1:30:26] this man was saying lord you said you
[1:30:28] will be with me you would be with me
[1:30:31] so when i were walking in the sands of
[1:30:32] time there were two sets of footprints
[1:30:35] but there is a time when there was one
[1:30:36] set of footprints where were you he was
[1:30:39] asking he thought lord that's when i was
[1:30:41] having difficult times i was just seeing
[1:30:44] two set of just one set of footprints
[1:30:46] where had you gone the guy says you know
[1:30:49] what when you saw that one set of
[1:30:51] footprint that was me carrying you
[1:30:54] that's not your footprints that was my
[1:30:56] footprint carrying you because he never
[1:30:59] failed he said i will be with you till
[1:31:02] the end of the world whatever you go
[1:31:04] through you know that god is right
[1:31:06] beside you if he is not beside you know
[1:31:09] that he is carrying you so you will go
[1:31:12] through each and every trial you go
[1:31:14] through each and every affliction amen
[1:31:17] because he is compassionate about you
[1:31:20] god
[1:31:22] knows each and every feeling you go
[1:31:23] through
[1:31:24] there is no feeling that he doesn't know
[1:31:28] he wants felt forsaken too
[1:31:30] he once felt god has had forsaken him
[1:31:33] when he said my god my god why has thou
[1:31:36] forsaken me this is the first time in
[1:31:38] the bible where you see jesus
[1:31:40] he felt like god had forsaken him he
[1:31:43] felt like god had turned his back on him
[1:31:45] but he knew
[1:31:47] just to stand on the promise of god
[1:31:49] jesus had that option to decide not to
[1:31:52] go to calvary
[1:31:54] he had an option to not have that
[1:31:57] feeling to feel like god had forsaken
[1:31:59] him but he decided to go all the way
[1:32:02] with god's word because he knew that
[1:32:04] god's word never fails
[1:32:07] and through that feeling of being
[1:32:09] forsaken that's where he got victory
[1:32:12] through going through all the way with
[1:32:14] feeling being forsaken that's where he
[1:32:17] was able to get your salvation that's
[1:32:19] where he was able to get your healing
[1:32:22] because he decided to stand on that word
[1:32:25] of god on the promises of god he was
[1:32:28] able to rise victorious he was able to
[1:32:31] overcome death hell and the grave he was
[1:32:34] able to overcome satan because he
[1:32:36] decided to go through all the way he
[1:32:39] decided he allowed and accepted to go
[1:32:42] through all the pain because through all
[1:32:44] that pain he saw the price that was
[1:32:46] right at the end he saw you he saw me
[1:32:49] you were right at the end of that pain
[1:32:52] at the end of those lashes he saw you
[1:32:55] right there and he says i am going
[1:32:57] through it so he decided he stood on the
[1:33:00] word of god
[1:33:02] so when your trial is coming your way
[1:33:05] don't look in the trial look at the end
[1:33:07] of the trial
[1:33:08] god has a prize at the end for you
[1:33:11] when you are sick don't look in your
[1:33:13] sickness there is a testimony right at
[1:33:16] the end of the end of your trial you are
[1:33:18] going to be able to say god was carrying
[1:33:21] me through
[1:33:22] there was not anything else that was not
[1:33:25] my doing that was not luck that was not
[1:33:27] a doctor but that was god only who did
[1:33:31] it so you have to be patient stand on
[1:33:34] the word prophet god said god is just
[1:33:37] waiting to see what you will do so you
[1:33:40] just stand flat-footed on the promises
[1:33:43] of god god is able to come through for
[1:33:45] you amen
[1:33:48] because they're going to come a time
[1:33:49] where it seems like your prayers are
[1:33:51] unanswered you pray seems like nothing
[1:33:53] is happening at all you say lord i want
[1:33:56] to be healed you are just sick you are
[1:33:58] praying for your loved one you're
[1:34:00] praying for your daughter your son your
[1:34:02] your brother your sister but it seems
[1:34:04] like nothing is happening it seems like
[1:34:06] god is not answering your prayer
[1:34:08] god he is just testing your patience he
[1:34:11] wants to see what you will do
[1:34:15] you know i just thought about lazarus
[1:34:16] the other time he was a poor man and we
[1:34:19] know lazarus he was a beggar at the rich
[1:34:21] man stable
[1:34:22] and
[1:34:23] he had the word that says what david
[1:34:25] says i have never seen the righteous
[1:34:28] begging for bread but he was right there
[1:34:31] begging for bread
[1:34:33] what a trial was that
[1:34:35] he is right there begging for bread and
[1:34:37] he's saying he's a righteous man
[1:34:40] he was going to the synagogue every day
[1:34:43] i bet people from the church were saying
[1:34:45] you are a secret sinner because that
[1:34:47] word is not applying to you
[1:34:49] but he kept on
[1:34:51] standing on the word of god i believe he
[1:34:54] remembered what job said even though he
[1:34:56] slayed me yet i will still serve him he
[1:34:59] just stood right there because he knew
[1:35:02] that the price at the end he was going
[1:35:04] to be in
[1:35:05] father abraham's bosom so it doesn't
[1:35:07] matter when god seems like he's not
[1:35:09] answering your prayer just be patient
[1:35:12] stay right there god wants to see what
[1:35:15] you were going to do so just stand right
[1:35:18] there and see the salvation of god
[1:35:20] amen at the end of your patience at the
[1:35:23] end of your trial there is a prize for
[1:35:26] you
[1:35:27] him and so
[1:35:28] he never lazarus never stopped standing
[1:35:31] on the word of god although he was right
[1:35:34] that he's poor he's begging for bread
[1:35:36] but he still stood right there amen
[1:35:39] it takes a special revelation for you to
[1:35:42] keep on standing like that
[1:35:44] it takes a special revelation for you to
[1:35:46] be like abraham
[1:35:48] and wait for 25 years
[1:35:50] whilst you're waiting on the promise but
[1:35:52] despite all that abraham stood still on
[1:35:55] the promise he knew that god never fails
[1:35:58] he had god say it with his own mouth and
[1:36:01] he heard it with his own ear so he knew
[1:36:05] that he was going to have isaac through
[1:36:07] sarah
[1:36:08] he did not want he did not want to have
[1:36:10] a child with haga although sarah forced
[1:36:12] him to
[1:36:14] he knew that the promise was going to
[1:36:16] come through sarah that why that's why
[1:36:18] he was standing on the promise of god it
[1:36:20] doesn't matter how old he was
[1:36:22] that word was going to change him and
[1:36:26] and condition him condition him to be
[1:36:28] able to receive that promise that word
[1:36:31] was responsible to rejuvenate him to
[1:36:34] make him younger that word was
[1:36:36] responsible to to change sarah so that
[1:36:39] they're able to receive the promise
[1:36:41] because when god promises
[1:36:43] his promise has to come to pass
[1:36:46] it has to happen
[1:36:47] it's just a matter of time
[1:36:50] you just gotta wait wait on the promises
[1:36:53] of god
[1:36:54] stand on that unshakable foundation
[1:36:57] solid word of god
[1:36:59] god will always come through for you
[1:37:02] the prophet of god says maybe your
[1:37:04] healing might linger a little bit
[1:37:06] god's got confidence in you that you
[1:37:08] will hold on
[1:37:10] if you believe that the holy spirit
[1:37:12] signs and wonders he promised
[1:37:14] then accept it and just hold on to god's
[1:37:17] requirements amen he says i'm the lord
[1:37:20] who heals all thy diseases it doesn't
[1:37:22] matter how long it might take i know i
[1:37:25] will be healed it doesn't matter what
[1:37:27] affliction it is i know he's going to
[1:37:28] deliver me out of it
[1:37:30] amen why because god said it and i
[1:37:34] believe it
[1:37:35] that settles it amen amen the bible says
[1:37:40] weeping may endure for a season but joy
[1:37:43] comes in the morning
[1:37:44] you don't know how long your night may
[1:37:46] be but so long day is a night it means
[1:37:50] that there is a morning coming
[1:37:52] abraham had a night that lasted for 25
[1:37:54] years but after those 25 years his
[1:37:57] morning came and joy came just as sure
[1:38:01] as you held onto the promises of god
[1:38:03] amen so just as sure as you are seated
[1:38:06] right there whatever night it is know
[1:38:09] that joy is coming in the morning as
[1:38:12] soon as the night is finished and the
[1:38:14] day breaks and the sun rises
[1:38:16] your troubles will be finished god will
[1:38:19] wipe away your tears and he will stand
[1:38:21] upon his promise joy is coming your way
[1:38:24] you may be sick for a night but healing
[1:38:27] is coming in the morning joy comes in
[1:38:30] the morning you don't know how long your
[1:38:32] night is gonna be
[1:38:34] just keep on holding onto the word of
[1:38:36] god he will never fail you amen
[1:38:38] you may be depressed for a night but you
[1:38:41] know that relief is coming in at the
[1:38:43] rising of the sun
[1:38:45] your deliverance is coming it's on its
[1:38:47] way amen amen you might be fighting for
[1:38:50] a battle throughout the whole night
[1:38:52] however long that night is but you know
[1:38:55] joy comes in the morning deliverance
[1:38:58] victory is coming at the end of the
[1:39:00] night at the end of your fighting joy
[1:39:03] comes in the morning amen
[1:39:06] your deliverance has a predestinated
[1:39:09] effective date that it has on it so you
[1:39:12] know however long it is when that date
[1:39:15] comes
[1:39:16] it has no option
[1:39:18] things have to change
[1:39:19] things have to happen
[1:39:21] the children of israel were in bondage
[1:39:23] for 430 years but there was a promise
[1:39:26] that at the end of those years there was
[1:39:29] deliverance that was coming so it
[1:39:31] doesn't matter how pharaoh hardened his
[1:39:34] heart or whatever he did because their

[1:40:18] army could not do it they tried to rush
[1:40:21] after them to try and give them back put

[1:40:26] son has set free is free indeed when god
[1:40:30] sets you free you cannot go back in
[1:40:32] bondage amen pharaoh tried to go against
[1:40:35] them he tried to rush and and take them
[1:40:37] back in bondage but their deliverance
[1:40:39] was already set and god has said you are
[1:40:42] free you are a delivered people so that

[1:42:01] god's deliverance has a date on it you
[1:42:03] are coming out of it
[1:42:05] amen god's purpose to utterly destroy
[1:42:08] pharaoh's army because he was trying to
[1:42:10] stop god's deliverance it doesn't matter
[1:42:13] what stands in your way between you and
[1:42:16] your deliverance so long god say that
[1:42:19] you will come through out of it
[1:42:21] god will deliver you amen amen he had he
[1:42:25] had the whole army go and stand in the
[1:42:27] middle of he waited until they were in
[1:42:29] the middle of the red sea
[1:42:31] and then angels came and they took off
[1:42:33] all the wheels from the chariots of
[1:42:35] pharaoh's army and then right there he
[1:42:38] destroyed all of them because god he was
[1:42:41] just proving his word that whatever i
[1:42:43] say has to come to pass i said you will
[1:42:46] be delivered in 400 years time is up it
[1:42:50] is you to get out nothing can stand in
[1:42:52] your way amen
[1:42:54] this was what god was doing all he was
[1:42:57] doing he was coming to deliver his own
[1:43:00] he was
[1:43:01] they had been praying for over 400 years
[1:43:04] and god heard their prayer he was coming
[1:43:06] to deliver his own people amen you are
[1:43:09] worth a lot of
[1:43:12] value don't let no one
[1:43:14] try to down trade you and say you are
[1:43:16] worth nothing you are royalty you are
[1:43:19] god's seed when royalty gets lost or
[1:43:22] royalty gets in trouble the king comes
[1:43:24] with his own army nothing is going to
[1:43:27] stand before him amen so he is going to
[1:43:30] come you better tell your oppressor that
[1:43:32] you have come
[1:43:34] for the wrong one you have messed with
[1:43:37] the wrong one because when god is coming
[1:43:40] nothing can stop him he goes all the way
[1:43:43] until he sets you into your deliverance
[1:43:47] amen
[1:43:48] you are worth a lot of value god has
[1:43:51] angels encompassing around you a host of
[1:43:55] angels that is protecting you that is
[1:43:58] how important you are because god wants
[1:44:02] you to be delivered amen
[1:44:04] you are his royal seed he chose you
[1:44:06] before the foundation of the world so he
[1:44:08] has angels those that fear the lord
[1:44:11] angels incompete around them
[1:44:13] someone said uh brother abraham says
[1:44:16] someone said to me many times said
[1:44:18] aren't you afraid brother branham when
[1:44:20] you go or there at nighttime that maybe
[1:44:22] that angel of the lord might leave you
[1:44:24] sometime i said i'm sure he won't
[1:44:27] because he promised me he wouldn't do it
[1:44:29] i've got faith in god to believe that he
[1:44:31] will meet that requirement if he said
[1:44:34] those that fear the lord angels
[1:44:36] encompass around them
[1:44:38] angels are encompa
[1:44:39] encamping around you so you know you
[1:44:42] have the protection
[1:44:43] look at elisha and gihazi god had
[1:44:47] angels more than a whole army protecting
[1:44:49] two people
[1:44:51] because
[1:44:52] he cares for his own he pro he was
[1:44:55] giving them deliverance because this
[1:44:57] this army was coming they were not
[1:44:58] coming to
[1:45:00] to play games with elijah they were
[1:45:02] coming to destroy him because they knew
[1:45:04] that he has been the reason why they've
[1:45:05] been losing battles all this time
[1:45:07] so god had a whole host of heaven in
[1:45:11] camping around his children
[1:45:15] these angels were more than the army of
[1:45:17] the assyrians so god has angels around
[1:45:20] you i read this other one called that a
[1:45:23] light he says brother branham said god
[1:45:25] is anxious
[1:45:27] to deliver you
[1:45:28] and i when i i know what anxious means i
[1:45:31] know what anxious means but i went back
[1:45:33] to the dictionary to look it up it says
[1:45:35] yeah god is anxious to deliver me
[1:45:38] anxious he's extremely uneasy
[1:45:41] you know he's jitter he's antsy he
[1:45:43] cannot wait he is under that
[1:45:45] anticipation
[1:45:47] you know he is imp you know when you're
[1:45:49] anxious you're you're you're impatient
[1:45:50] for something to happen that's the
[1:45:53] feeling that god has when you are in
[1:45:55] trouble
[1:45:56] god is anxious to come and deliver you
[1:45:58] so nothing will stop you amen
[1:46:01] keep on holding on deliverance is on its
[1:46:04] way the bible says he is our protection
[1:46:07] so he will protect you at all costs amen
[1:46:11] and the bible says he is
[1:46:13] he is our city of refuge so whenever you
[1:46:16] are in trouble when you are running away
[1:46:18] from your enemy you run to god he's the
[1:46:20] city of refuge he is going to protect
[1:46:23] you
[1:46:24] now look when you're running to the city
[1:46:26] of refuge it's not you're running
[1:46:28] because you're right
[1:46:29] you're running because you have
[1:46:30] committed a crime but despite you
[1:46:32] committing a crime
[1:46:34] god is going to protect you he's going
[1:46:36] to say come on in
[1:46:38] and the enemy cannot touch you what you
[1:46:40] have done wrong he's going to say he is
[1:46:43] justified he has never done it in the
[1:46:46] first place
[1:46:47] amen he is our city of refuge so
[1:46:50] whenever you have done something wrong
[1:46:52] you run to god and say lord i'm sorry
[1:46:54] he's going to hide you and he'll say you
[1:46:56] cannot touch him the enemy says
[1:46:59] but he lied to me while he did not do it
[1:47:02] in the first place but he stole this
[1:47:04] from me
[1:47:05] god is going to say but he did not do it
[1:47:08] in the first place amen because you are
[1:47:10] justified doesn't matter whatever crime
[1:47:13] you have committed
[1:47:14] there is that city of refuge you run
[1:47:17] that god has protection for you amen he
[1:47:20] is going to tell the enemy that get away
[1:47:22] leave him alone he never done it in the
[1:47:24] first place
[1:47:26] you were coming after the wrong one
[1:47:28] he never do it you cannot touch him
[1:47:30] because he is covered by my blood so you
[1:47:34] are covered by jesus blood
[1:47:36] no one can touch you satan cannot touch
[1:47:39] you amen
[1:47:40] so he is our city of refuge bible says
[1:47:43] he is our strong tower he is our
[1:47:46] fortress a fortress is it's like a it's
[1:47:50] almost like an army base you know it's
[1:47:52] built around you cannot break into it so
[1:47:54] when god says i am your fortress you
[1:47:56] know he is surrounding you he is around
[1:47:59] you no one nothing can harm you nothing
[1:48:02] can break into where you are because he
[1:48:04] is surrounding you he has got you kept
[1:48:08] he has got you safe in his arms david so
[1:48:11] many times he said he is my hiding place
[1:48:15] whenever the enemy comes in after you
[1:48:18] god is there to hide you
[1:48:21] he says he is my hiding place you are my
[1:48:23] hiding place you keep me from trouble
[1:48:26] you surround me with songs of
[1:48:28] deliverance amen god is there to hide
[1:48:31] you when you're running away from your
[1:48:33] enemy amen let's stand up on our feet
[1:48:36] amen
[1:48:37] he is our protection
[1:48:40] he is our city of refuge amen he is our
[1:48:43] strong tower you are my hiding place in
[1:48:46] sea
[1:48:48] he is our protection city of refuge
[1:48:51] he is our strong tower he is our
[1:48:52] fortress he is our hiding place amen
[1:48:56] you see whilst i was starting i came
[1:48:59] across
[1:49:00] i just thought how does the mosquito
[1:49:02] repellent work
[1:49:04] so i thought a mosquito repellent you
[1:49:05] know it repels it chases away
[1:49:08] the mosquitoes i thought maybe it has a
[1:49:10] fall foul smell that when the mosquitoes
[1:49:13] smell that uh that smell they'll run
[1:49:15] away from it but it doesn't work like it
[1:49:18] and i went further to read to see how it
[1:49:20] works
[1:49:21] so the way the mosquito repellent works
[1:49:23] it
[1:49:24] it confuses
[1:49:26] and interferes with the receptors of a
[1:49:29] mosquito so a mosquito has sensors or
[1:49:31] receptors that's looking for you
[1:49:34] so it's coming to to try and sense sense
[1:49:37] sense your body heat and try to sense
[1:49:39] that um
[1:49:40] that carbon dioxide that you're
[1:49:42] releasing off but what the mosquito
[1:49:44] repellent does it goes and it confuses
[1:49:47] those antennas and the mosquito cannot
[1:49:49] find you
[1:49:51] it says the receptors are used to detect
[1:49:54] body heat and carbon dioxide that's
[1:49:56] released by your skin when those
[1:49:58] mosquitoes are searching for prey but
[1:50:00] these receptors are confused and they
[1:50:03] cannot find you you are hidden the
[1:50:05] mosquito can fly right by you but it's
[1:50:08] not going to find you because you are
[1:50:10] hidden
[1:50:11] its receptors are confused so when god
[1:50:14] hides you satan cannot find you
[1:50:18] he is coming after you but he will come
[1:50:20] right by you but he cannot find you
[1:50:24] one singer said praise will confuse the
[1:50:26] enemy
[1:50:27] so satan will not find you
[1:50:30] sickness will try to come after you but
[1:50:33] it will not find you why because jesus
[1:50:36] is our hiding place he is hiding you
[1:50:40] amen whatever afflictions trials that
[1:50:43] are not predestinated to come for you
[1:50:46] they are not going to find you because
[1:50:48] god is hiding you
[1:50:50] satan will not find you amen
[1:50:55] hallelujah
[1:50:56] you know satan is like a roaring lion
[1:50:58] looking for whom he might
[1:51:00] devour
[1:51:01] but he cannot find you because the blood
[1:51:04] of jesus christ is covering you
[1:51:07] amen
[1:51:08] just about two weeks ago
[1:51:10] kovi tried to find me but it could not
[1:51:13] find me because i was covered by the
[1:51:15] blood i was even healed before i even
[1:51:18] knew i had covered because god was
[1:51:21] hiding me
[1:51:22] jesus was hiding me and i came out of it
[1:51:25] saying satan you are a liar
[1:51:27] you cannot touch me because the blood of
[1:51:30] jesus got me covered i'm looking many
[1:51:32] people in here they had called with
[1:51:34] satan was trying to come after you but
[1:51:35] he could not find you because jesus was
[1:51:39] hiding you
[1:51:40] in his in the cleft of the rock that's
[1:51:42] where you hide
[1:51:44] god is anxious to have you delivered
[1:51:47] god is anxious for you to come out of
[1:51:49] your affliction
[1:51:51] and he will deliver you
[1:51:53] because that's what he said in his word
[1:51:56] all you got to do just stand flat-footed
[1:51:59] and you know he will come for you amen
