morning you may be seated for just a [Music] minute we have had some weather in this place Haven we weather I just want to make a few announcement before I get into the word of the go of the Lord amen we appreciate everybody uh being here today but we want to just say something by the grace of God to the families and is dealing with controlling your children you know we know the message said that if you can't control your children you need to stay home until they're controlled please teach your children not to play in the please teach your children not to run in and out of the church amen uh because we we want God to visit this place we have a few brothers who have volunteered to help with the children them order out there but just but just remember they're not your nannies right hello unless you're going to pay them now if you pay them my point is they're not supposed to be taking care of your children while you just enjoying yourself here in the service keep that in mind uh it's not it's not so much as a rebuke it's more like an exaltation want you to keep in mind Where Your Children Are and you shouldn't know what they're doing and if you don't have them if they're not in control they need to be in here and if you can't control them in here you you've got some homework to do you love the Lord amen you appreciate the Lord we want to keep the vest as clean as possible no cluttering and all of that no l talking and gesturing and joking even myself I'm I'm correcting metime we because of winter we forget that that is still the part of the House of right and we shouldn't be slumbering in our seats while we're in the house of God and even crossing your leg legs is disrespectful to me so if you have a habit of crossing your legs for deliver at least in the house of am if we understand the unveiling of God we also understand that when preacher is preaching not the man but it's God anointing and the more respectful we become the more anointing we'll see in this so that's all I need to say so we thank God for you're listening now let us stand and we'll have a reading of the word coming from Hebrews the 11th chapter and we'll be reading the Third third verse and it goes through faith we understand that the world were framed by the word of God so that things which are seen were not made of of things which do appear amen amen praise the Lord I want you to read one more scripture with me Genesis 1 1 [Music] 23 and then from there St John 1-4 in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth thank you sir and the Earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the [Music] deep and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters and God said let there be light and there was light St John 1 beginning at the first verse in the beginning was the word and the Word was and the Word was was with God and the word was God the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was the light of men now let us pray Heavenly Father we thank you for your grace we thank you for your mercy we thank you for your love and all that you are doing for us even right now you have been so faithful and great is that faithfulness and we thank you for the mercy that you give unto us which is renewed every morning great is thy faithfulness father bless us this morning Hallelujah in a special way and we'll be careful to give you the praise Glory and Honor in Jesus Christ name we pray amen you may be seated on Wednesday we preached a message dealing with uh the same Glory and I said yes I said that I have been ordered and ordained to preach the message to the bride I trust everybody in here is the Bride of Jesus Christ and to be honest with you that's not my business who is and who is it I just know that God has spoken to my heart and I try and I pray that God will give me the grace of God uh to take it to the next level good to see you brother Isaac you've been on my heart amen amen we've been praying for you God is good to us while I'm thinking about that remember brother Josh the reason he's going through a great trial right now keep keep him in your prayers my subject this morning going Beyond this Dimension We Know by the grace of God that this is what we call the third dimension and and in this Dimension based on carnality Amen I believe before the fall we were linked to God in a different dimension remember the blood of Jesus Christ does not come just to save us uh but to position Al Place Us in that position where we we have fallen from this is why we needed a resurrection his death would have meant nothing if there had not been a resurrection because of the resurrection power God is able to transform us he's able to translate us is that right he's able to change us from this Mortal body into a body of immortality so when you get the Holy Ghost that is a down payment of your Resurrection gu see eternal life has no beginning and it has no ending and so therefore as a man or woman we would have never been able to obtain that it had to be a gift we couldn't buy it because of his value and if there's a man in this world who is a trillionaire he could never buy his salvation no one no money can purchase this I don't know about you but I want to dance right now the world that is to come will also be a world that's resurrected this world that we know had to go through justification sanctification and a fire baptism y'all understand me before Jesus could ever return in his physical this world had to change Hal hallelujah hallelujah and though the fires will burn the atmosphere and burn the demon power away Hallelujah there stands a dimension that will never be touched somebody help me by the fires that will destroy Heaven and Earth y understand what I'm saying resurrected in his eternal state where this world will never from that point on pass away after Jesus returned the world will never pass away and after Jesus returned to you you will never pass away hallelujah hallelujah see faith is From Another Dimension is that right because before the earth was formed Faith was there is that right it took Faith create everything that you see and this faith I'm talking about is not a thing it's a person we didn't know that we thought Faith was like this handkerchief something we could handle we talk about a natural Faith but the supernatural faith is God himself you say why would you say that because the Bible says that the just shall live by his Fai it is unseen but you know when you got it hallelujah hallelujah see the Unseen is more real than the seen is that right the prophet of God was in a a discussion with a man and he said I can't believe anything or nothing that I can't see because if I can't see it it's not real and the prophet of God said anything that cannot be S this is what the guy said anything that cannot be scientifically proven this is what the God says he said then I think there's nothing to it but brother Bram said I don't like to be different but I have to be now the things that can be scientifically proven is not real it's only the things that can scientifically excuse me it's only the things that's not scientifically proven is real in other words I don't care how deep get they cannot find the real thing finding the real thing doesn't come by science it comes by faith oh Lord help me now what it is we must learn how to focus on the Heavenly things because God said it we are now sitting in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus even the prophet of God says don't ask for the little things ask for the big things hallelujah hallelujah let's let's let's understand God is Big hallelujah hallelujah he's bigger than the universe Hallelujah he's bigger than anything you can see God is but though he be great he knows how to hide himself hallelujah hallelujah see we must understand we're no longer once you're born again you you're no longer of this world you in the world but you're not of the world and you got to elevate your thoughts Hallelujah you got to believe what the word says about you Hallelujah if you don't have the faith of like Enoch how you expect to have a translation Hallelujah Now understand the resurrection of Jesus Christ Pro to us that there is life after death hallelujah hallelujah I mean I don't care how many Sadducees stood there at Lazarus grave come on Lazarus has been dead 4 days but when Jesus said I am the resurrection I am the life Hallelujah is that right if he said he was then he is now and when he called for Lazarus he wasn't looking in the Earthly way of looking at things Hallelujah he he married him said Lord they were still conal they were still natural Hallelujah and they said Lord in other words how could this thing be he's been dead four days he's thinking Lord but here Jesus was looking into another dimension Hallelujah he said don't Lazarus sleeping I'm going to wake him today in other words when you die in Jesus You're Not Dead you're still alive Hallelujah understand the Bride of Jesus Christ she cannot die Hallelujah is that the Bible the Bible said like this if you believe in me no you were dead yet shall you live hallelujah hallelujah oh come on somebody even under the law the law couldn't even hold Moses in the grave is that right because here was Jesus trying to teach his disciples what life is all about y understand me he took him up on Mount Transfiguration and up on Mount Transfiguration there stood Moses and Elijah and the prophet of God said Moses represented the the law he was the resurrected Saints Hallelujah but Elijah represented the translated Saint Hallelujah they both were there on the same Mountain come on somebody and then Peter said Lord who should we make a tabernacle to should we should we make one for Moses shall we make one for Elijah Hallelujah then that Jesus says No Moses and Elijah had to disappear let me tell you something like this Moses and Elijah had to disappear in order for them to see Jesus somebody help me here they fulfilled their Ministry but now Jesus Christ is on the scene is that the Bible the Bible tells us is that right even brother brandom said that the whole theme of the Bible is Jesus Christ Hallelujah it has to be Jesus there's no other name given them Heaven whereby a man must be saved but at the name of Jesus Christ we've got to look to the Unseen Abraham came looking at the Unseen he was able to not look at what the flesh dictated to him Hallelujah this is what we must understand if you're going to get victory in your life over any sickness you cannot look at the symptoms you must look at the promise hallelujah hallelujah the Bible said with his stripes we were healed not with going to be we are don't get me wrong when God is ready for you to go you can go but it doesn't mean you died not believing Hallelujah is that right oh come on on somebody the Bible says ye are gods that ain't for your head that's for your heart and as a man think in his heart so is he you understand me cuz if you're thinking in your head like that the devil can take it from you but when you know that you know that you're know when you know you got the Holy Ghost you know you got God on the inside he said so whatsoever you will believing that is yours he says it's yours hey it may take a little time but in his time he makes all things beautiful Hallelujah see everybody can't hear the voice of God the voice of God is dimensional it's on a certain frequency that only the a certain frequency that only the V the Bride of Jesus Christ can hear that's why he said my sheep heareth my voice and a stranger Hallelujah they will not follow let me tell you something about this grace before I go any further so many of us are still trying to live holy try all you want to you you'll never make it the grace of God comes to give you the Holy Ghost Hallelujah and when you come to that Revelation had it's not I that live but it's Christ that lives in me hallelujah hallelujah I don't care how you try the Bride of Jesus Christ you have been so Justified if you truly got the Holy Ghost you've been Justified as though You' never sin in the first place you got to elevate it you got to think with the mind of Christ Hallelujah Hallelujah with men things are impossible Hallelujah but With God all things are possible hallelujah hallelujah yeah Lord and the voice of God is is on on such a frequency it never changes Hallelujah my sheep Hearth my voice no matter which age it's in if you was in the age of Ephesus you heard his voice if you was in the age of spera you heard his voice y'all better hear me if you was in the age of Philadelphia if you are a sheep you heard His Voice Hallelujah Hallelujah because what people don't understand Paul wasn't the shepherd it was God in Paul who's the shepherd you understand me we don't follow man we follow God glory to God see I know some of y'all get nervous when I bring it like this but let me tell you something it's something youve got to come through Hallelujah you know William Bram had to be saved himself y'all understand me he even was concerned about his mom salvation before she died is that right see is an individual thing it doesn't matter who your parents are You' got to know Jesus for yourself Hallelujah you've got to go beyond this Dimension because Flesh and Blood no Flesh and Blood we enter into the kingdom hallelujah hallelujah you love the Lord see we live in a world of unbelief everything's unbelief right you talk about God healing you and people are they going to think you're crazy with all this medicine with all these doctors you mean to tell me you'd rather for Jesus to heal you I must tell these doctors something your medication May Aid me but only Jesus can heal me y'all hear what I'm saying no no no medication can heal you only Jesus Christ Hallelujah can heal you glory to God if God want to use medication to help you in your faith that's fine Hallelujah there was some he spoke to and they were healed there was some he had to put mud and spittle in their ey to help them heal there were some who had to go dip in the waters God don't have to do that but he's working with your faith and understand God will go out his way to make you a Believer is that right even in the time that brother Brandon was here and people were receiving Their Blessings of healing he brother B would cry out sister don't do that it's right there you going to miss it you hear what I'm saying when God pronounce healing on you you must Focus you should never let your thoughts sway Hallelujah because if God said so that's what he meant but we have to wait you're going to be tried Hallelujah but I found out some things that even in the natural if you speak a word and really believe it and focus on it it will come to pass did you not know that I mean even in science they call it call it the quantum theory and all of these particles they're there even though you can't see them they thought at one time that the Adam was the biggest one then they broke it down to the photons and neutrons and now it's all the way down to what they call quarks Hallelujah but if you don't look at them random look like they're moving everywhere and this is why they say that there are multiple universes because once you focus on one it it stands at attention but you understand it's Everlasting if I got it correct but my point is this I know that there's one more like me living in another place come on somebody scientists they can come close to it but they don't know how and what it is come on somebody but we know everything's moving by the power of God and when God said let there be light that light vibrated [Laughter] Hallelujah you're sitting here by the vibration of the word hallelujah your body is whole by the vibration of the word hallelujah one thing I know is that God has his eyes on you and as long as God eye is on you you're going to do what he said do he's the allseeing eye he's omnipotent he's omnipresent hallelujah hallelujah and he's omip omnipotent omnicient om presentent and omnipotent y'all know what those mean see science they're seeing things that they cannot explain even Einstein Brother bam said it like that came so close to knowing god or seeing God he did conclude that there is a God y understand me and you know we've got all of these sintific sociological people in their intellect they say there is no God I'm going tell you something the birds are smarter because they call it Instinct but we call it God it's God who has set things in order that when it's time for the birds to travel back to the South raises up a leader oh y'all didn't hear it and so when it's time for us to make a journey God raised up a leader oh come on what what would this you understand me this is why the world is so confused because they refused the leader they rejected Malachi 4 they they had Jesus standing at the outside of the door when he came to leave them I don't know about you but I'm ready for my change Hallelujah yes sir one thing about Quantum is there have to be an input and an [Music] output but when you put something in it comes out even greater on the output y'all think God didn't know what he was doing he knew what he was doing because when Adam fell God knew what he wanted to produce hallelujah hallelujah that's why I read that scripture that that Jesus was the light or the life of men see Adam was supposed to be it but he fail see we need to know who the real life and the real light why would you say that because after Adam fell there were thousands of years they had that had passed where man in his Perfection was never seen again the perfect man came about by a virgin birth Hallelujah and that virgin birth came by an Angel speaking the word you shall have a son and you going to call his name Jesus she she she might have had another thought that she might want to call him something else but see there's power in the name of Jesus maybe I'm maybe I'm I'm see that's why the devil don't care if you say God he don't care if you say Lord there's many lords there's many gods Hallelujah but he does not like the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah huj because when you say that with Revelation he knows he's got to Bow Hallelujah he's got to Humble himself to the name of Jesus Christ hallelujah hallelujah and the Bible said that the whole family of Heaven and Earth is named after him oh come on come on somebody when you when you get the true Holy Spirit your name changes your character changes hallelujah hallelujah right so you got to understand what God is doing let me show you how God how he works math a woman gave two mites in church two coins to Jesus in service and Jesus rung it up and gave her eternal life hallelujah hallelujah see it's just little things you [Music] think that doesn't matter but it matters he even said if somebody gives you a drink of water in the name of Jesus Hallelujah they can receive eternal life oh my people come on now we must understand that when we talk about Dimensions Beyond ours we must understand that our prayer penetrates those Dimensions is that is that that right God told Daniel I heard your prayers 21 days ago is that right he was an angel fighting on the behalf of Daniel what what about you Daniel is a servant you are Sons and Daughters of God hallelujah hallelujah but you got to understand when you praying you're changing your atmosphere when you are praying you're moving from this four dimension to the dimension right there where God is am this is prayer in just saying words prayer sincere prayer though you be here will translate you into a Heavenly places Hallelujah you must understand oh you don't believe this they say you can leap they call it a Quantum Leap if you're feeling sad you actually carrying that atmosphere with you and your sadness is going to affect somebody else hallelujah hallelujah but there's a Quantum Leap they say they call it that's what they call it if you start talking positive you can actually come and change that atmosphere now what did Brother brandham say said we are little creators hallelujah hallelujah and all we got to do is speak the difference come on somebody just like our brother said the other week if you're sick sometimes all you need is a good hallelujah oh sometimes all you need is a worshiping service and the devil will leave you alone hallelujah hallelujah but as long as we carry that negative atmosphere Hallelujah you literally pulling up demons to make you even sadder what but when you begin to praise God because God inhabits the praise of his people when you begin to praise God it'll take you into Heavenly places oh come on I think it was Jehosaphat when God told Jehosaphat you know you're not going to fight this battle I'm going to fight the battle but I want you to put all the instruments in front I want you to put the musicians I want you to put the choir I want you to put all this joyful sound in the front even the devil knows it's working Hallelujah you get a basketball team on one Accord their team could be behind Hallelujah but if that that that group of people that believes in that team if they rally together and began to shout and jump and praise that team turns around why because even though they're Fallen they're still Fallen sons of God and they have the ability according to the Clon Theory to leave to change order to change things you say it doesn't work it does work it was Saul demon possessed but he called David to change the atmosphere insane man Hallelujah was now had a menro who was able to change the atmosphere you can change your atmosphere you don't have to be sad you don't have to be lonely you can change your [Applause] atmosphere hallelujah hallelujah if you say your world is falling apart your world is falling apart Hallelujah because what comes out of your mouth is what what either God reacts to or the devil reacts to Hallelujah Hallelujah you love the Lord yes sir you got to re you got to understand who you are now as long as you lineing up with God you don't have to worry about failing but if you're doing all you know right to do God will come through Hallelujah if there's sin in the camp he can't move you got his hands tied Hallelujah you can be a prophet and God won't move Hallelujah brother Ram told that lie a baby need to be prayed for nothing was going to happen until he confessed and made that prayer made that thing right once he made right he was able to pray for the baby and the baby was right you understand me same with you Hallelujah am I right or wrong glory to God you can't you can't live a sinful life and expect God to just bless you now he going to bless anyway cuz he reigns on the just and the unjust Hallelujah but I want to be just I want to be justified under his blood I want to be in the right place I want to receive the right blood blessings from him hallelujah what shall separate me who shall separate me from the love of God nothing can separate you hallelujah hallelujah why why why because his eyes are on you Hallelujah and as long as his eyes is on you you will do exactly what he said there Hallelujah God focuses you don't think his eyes on you he said Phillip I saw you under that tree I saw you under that tree yall understand he's walking down the road he said come on down zakus amen amen if he can see zakus he can see philli he definitely can see you Hallelujah he knows all about you and if he can see me I need to see him is that right because when God call zakus come on down zachus you're a little bit too high you yeah yeah break down Bring It On Down Hallelujah and if you're the seed of God if you you're the seed of God you could be full of Pride but you're still a seed of God hallelujah and God will bring it down y'all better hear what I'm saying God will bring it down oh my God we're serving a living God this is the time bride you you ought to be rejoicing it's later than you think hallelujah hallelujah I I I I I woke up this morning well what the thought woke me up and I was thinking the day before the earthquake will that be like what will that be like there's no warning [Music] system you understand me I don't know how all of that's going to work but whenever it happens I want to be on the Lord's Side y'all better hear what I'm saying because they can't give a warning until after the earthquake has already started hallelujah what about tsunamis millions of thousands of people have been killed it doesn't matter even if the warning goes out the thing is moving so fast that most people can't even move out of the way Hallelujah but there is a hiding place there is a shelter I don't know about you but I'm feeling pretty good this morning because I'm not looking at the natural things what I see is not real wait a minute you might be looking at your brother you might be looking at your sister and you might think oh that's a hypocrite what you see is not even real y understand me you cannot see the seat of God that's in the heart of a man you cannot see the seat of God that's in the heart of a woman you better hear what I'm saying they may not be acting right right now but God has his eyes on them somebody and God is going to bring that person right to the place they ought to be Hallelujah Hallelujah don't give up on your loved ones hey God has a plan God has a purpose and when you have focused and you have prayed with that Focus you got to realize it has to come to pass Faith doesn't waver Hallelujah faith is straight I don't care what it is sons of God the whole creation is waiting for your manifestation Hallelujah you need to come up to the bat you need to stand up and understand who you are Hallelujah God ain't looking for some he you're here already but you got to have faith you got to believe who you are your focus will create your reality Hallelujah did y'all know that if you constantly saying I ain't no good I'm so weak you gonna be no good and you GNA be weak the Bible say you ought to say I'm strong when you're weak say I'm strong don't give the flesh no glory don't let the devil make you speak things that shouldn't be spoken Hallelujah I never be weak you could never be weak because God is strong Hallelujah he's my power he's my strength he's my everything Hallelujah God is going to see this thing happen I don't know how I'm going to be changed but I can see a change you understand me I don't know how the final things going to happen but I see it happening somebody help me here I didn't call myself to the message the message called me I didn't look for it it look for me it looked for you it called you Hallelujah and Jesus said If any man come unto me I will in no wise cast him out Hallelujah glory to God I don't have to worry about being cast out Hallelujah God will go out his way amen is that right God will go out of his way to save you is that the truth here the resurrection is on think about perhaps when it's when it's on again when it comes on again maybe there'll be some doubters like Thomas God didn't have to come to Thomas but his eyes was on Thomas you understand me God saw Thomas before he doubted hallelujah hallelujah and he comes through the door didn't even bother to knock he comes through the wall right Thomas I need to help you here ye have little faith yes I need to push it up some sometimes God will let you go will take you he come you all out the way and God will come knocking on your door just to wake you up just so that you can see I love you still you're doubting me Thomas but see there's a seed in you I cannot ignore Hallelujah and the Bible say the Lord knoweth them that are here if we had judged if we had judged Thomas if we had looked at Thomas like oh man what you talking about you don't believe us we're telling you the truth what kind of believer you are hallelujah hallelujah that's not what Jesus did Jesus compassion Jesus love Jesus Mercy caus him to walk through that door address Thomas Hallelujah and if I got it right I think Thomas was the one that was killed in the right because of the Gospel of Jesus Christ Hallelujah see once you know like Thomas came to know my Lord my God Hallelujah huj from that point on Thomas developed a new vision he was no longer looking in the caral he looked beyond the caral you are Abraham's seed you are ordained to look beyond the Hallelujah you are ordained to call those things that be not as though they were hallelujah hallelujah so you can understand Hallelujah Proverbs 23 and7 I'm just going to read the first part for as he thinketh in his heart so is he if you're thinking in your heart is you're a loser that that's what you are oh Lord I I'm just a failure that's what you are I used to say this all the time I'm a man of many faults and God said stop that stop speaking that because if you speak that that's what you will become you understand me science is going to make sure you become that is that the truth it is a scientific fact if I had a flower rose bush and I would go to that rose bush and I would curse that rose bush that rose bush will eventually die but if I go to that rose bush and begin to praise it and bless it it will live you say that ain't true Jesus Jesus proved it was he said to the Fig Tree you going to die this is your day to die did it die even from the root he was a Son of God let me ask you who are you what are you if you listen I know this to be true you can take crazy all you want but my tree in front of my yard it was planted out of season it was dying and the Holy Spirit said go pray and pray and bless that tree now God is my witness I went outside in the cold and I blessed that tree in the cold that tree bloom twice and now that tree is healthier than the other tree bigger than the other tree taller than the other tree that was there already and if God have respect for a tree what about your children Hallelujah when you say oh you're just so bad stop cursing your children you don't have bad children and if you keep cursing them you stupid what are you saying Abraham's word blessed and curse what about your words there are times I would pray and call some of y'all Rebels you'll never know but God says stop that they're not see we don't know who you are and we don't know your time of change but I believe that all of us have that time to change and if God stop me I know you will change somebody help me here come on now come on y'all think y'all getting see God got his eyes on you fix hey he sees everything we do he hears our thoughts a far off hallelujah hallelujah than you lord it's the truth so I don't do that no more cuz I don't know who's bride and who's not but I hope everybody in here is hallelujah listen I want you to understand something when you come to the Lord Jesus Christ you must recognize that there is no sin sin is unbelief saints of God we have faults there's a difference because of this flesh yes sir y understand me but B said we all have sinned and come short of the glory of God because there was a time we were Sinners but now God has elevated us you can't be a sinner a saint at the same time Hallelujah but look what Psalm says Psalms 103 and2 as far as the East is from the West so far ha he removed our transgressions from us is that all right you know the problem is we judge our we judge each others before we judge ourselves and the Bible never say judge your brother the Bible said judge ye yourself see whether you be in the faith is this okay y'all getting quiet I'm almost done yo yo yo Yoo yo yo y your time is almost up I got five more minutes St John 14 beginning at the first verse the problem is we letting the devil bring us into this negative attitude he's destroying he's destroying you because you got to understand and he's he's strategic this is a battle and I don't want to get into right like that because I got to teach today in the people but what do you think the devil is doing he see what you're capable of doing so he put everything in your way to stop you from doing it you understand me he can hinder you he just can't stop you you understand me and and he uses your flesh to engage you and I'm just going to drop this we make mistakes in our flesh it Grieves us and so the devil say see you ain't no good you ain't nothing but a hypocrite huh because he see a gift in you he sees the purpose that God for you has for you that's nothing but the truth is that right I mean come on come on we let's I'm just going to I'm tapping into my next message let's tap David let's get David on the anointed by Samuel with a whole Horn of oil that ran from his head all the way down to his feet but David had an enemy it wasn't the devil it was his flesh that's right your enemy is your flesh and the more spiritual you are the more the devil is going to ride you that's the truth if you're gifted Satan gonna fight you he trying to stop God from using you hallelujah oh come on somebody if you don't believe me take out check out Samson had the same problem David had y'all think that flesh is going to be your buddy that's one of Satan's strategies his greatest strategy is lost anyway I'm G leave that alone but my point is this y'all think yall so holy anybody holier than brother brother Bram y know what I'm trying to say he had to put a cross up front the more spiritual you are on the positive side the more negativity you're going to get on the left side people don't even understand you that sister canane she's all the spirit but when she come out of that Spirit of the law the devil is right there to meet her y'all know what I'm talking about anybody come on it's the truth sometime it gets so bad you can't even control your eyes you like Lord help me help me it's trth true that's right let's move on continue let not your heart be troubled ye believe in God believe also in me don't don't let your heart be troubled God do promise and whatever he promised is a yay to you no matter what Satan tries to do you know I think about Peter how Peter denied Jesus and Judah Judas one time and Peter never lost his position Judas had was hung himself and Peter was on the day of Pentecost preaching the message see when you a seat of God you I hate to say it like this but I'm going say there special privileges comes with the being you understand me in my father's house are many mansions if it were not so I would have told you I'd go to prepare a place for you you better accept that this is personal I don't know how it's going to look but part of it if not all of it will be something I will enjoy no right it will be something I will enjoy you know if even even there if I just got a little corner I'll be happy you know why cuz there I'll never get tired nothing will ever be boring we can't even imagine it he said if I go and prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you unto myself that where I am there you may be y listen I hear I I feel this let me tell y something Peter had a bad temper he had one of those temples to fight to kill and God changed him he didn't change himself that's why he could write there and add to your faith virtue knowledge all that if anybody knew about transformation Peter knew about it don't you worry he that begun that work in you you got to have faith he's faithful to complete it I I I don't can't do it anybody in here can do it and if you can do it show me how you're doing it you can't it's all by the grace of God I don't even care how religious you think still a sinner saved by grace it is what it is where th go ye know and the way you know and Thomas said un him Lord we know not whether thou going and how can we know the way and Jesus said unto him I am the way listen to this Lord which way to go I am the way should I go that way I am the way Lord what about what this professor say he said I am the truth I don't care what they teach in school the Bible is the truth and he says I am the life no man cometh unto the father but by me how cuz we are accepted in the belov Paul put it this way my life is [Music] he in Christ Jesus I got a hiding place in the word of God so I'm we're going to stop on this Ephesians 2:8 for for by grace are you saved through faith and that not of yourself it is the gift of God do y'all understand that cuz your religion can't save you coming to this church don't save you it's the grace of God hallelujah hallelujah you love the Lord hallelujah hallelujah we'll just stop here God is so good to us Amen Let Us stand turn on in moments like the I'll sing out a song I'll sing out a love song to Jesus in moment like the I live up my hands I lift up my hands to you Lord sing it I love you Lord sing in I love you Lord sing [Music] it Lord I love you let's sing

places but I thank you for the effort I really appreciated I was blessed you are good people Your Blood Washed don't forget that people God put us all together you look at Peter when he was trying to kill that Soldier but he still had seed we make mistakes all the time anybody know what I'm talking about but God got this covered you you supposed to be happy it doesn't matter what you're going through you create the atmosphere atere that woman who husband just threw the food all on the floor She said must Jesus bear the cross alone and all the world go free know there's a cross for everyone and there's a cross for me you're not getting out here without suffering but the Bible said the suffering of this world cannot be compared to to the glory which God has in store for us I go through it Jes said it's a vapor I know it's a vapor right I'm almost at that age but I'm still saying saying come Lord Jesus come I I'm free I can say that I can say that with confidence I'm free come Lord Jesus his blood has protected me his blood is protecting you you said with all your faults that's why God put that robe on you when you entered into the door right amen showing that you was invited to

that he's working with me it's all for me and I have the ability to change my atmosphere let me say it like this God don't always say yes he sometimes say no no we got to love him when he say yes and
