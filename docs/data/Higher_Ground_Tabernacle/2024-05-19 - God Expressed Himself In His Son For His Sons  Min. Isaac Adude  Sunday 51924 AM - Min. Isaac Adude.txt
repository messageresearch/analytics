[Music] and oh [Music] amen could you have please [Music] fore fore [Music] [Music] [Music] am fore word made us beh Glory for God was manifest In the Flesh justified in the spirit seen of angels preached unto the Gentiles believed on in the world received that into glory amen that mystery of godliness is the same God amen who was in the beginning amen the same God was manifest In the Flesh and the same God was justified in the spirit the same God was seen of angels and the same God was preached unto the Gentiles amen it's the same God Amen you may be seated so this morning we have a little subject that we wanted to share with you that we entitled it uh God expressed himself in his son for his son amen God expressed himself in his son for his sons amen because if you read throughout the entire Bible you will understand that amen that every time that God talk to every time that God does something he does it as a son amen when he wanted to talk if he wants to talk to you he will use he will use a form of a son amen because the Bible says I believe uh somewhere it says that uh nobody has seen God Amen but we have seen the image of him which was Christ Jesus Christ am so here in the Bible here in John chapter one where we read amen he says that in the beginning was the word and the was and the Word was with God and the Word was God Amen in other tra translations of the Bible amen the Bible says that in the beginning was the logos and the logos was with God and the logos was God amen because the logos is the word amen the logos is the spirit amen the prophet says that it was that spirit that came out of God Amen that's what we call the logos and the Bible teaches us in first John Amen in 1 John Chapter 5 Verse 6 I believe amen it says that the spirit and the word are one amen so the logos which was the spirit of God Amen the prophet came after that and said that the logos was the attribute of the fullness of God Amen it was the word it was also the word amen because if we go back before the beginning amen before the time start amen before that the prophet said that God was a thought amen and being in that form of a thought amen he couldn't create because a thought cannot create amen a thought is there to plan Amen to think about what's supposed to happen but it cannot create amen the prophet compare it to uh an architect amen he says that before before before starting to build or to uh uh to do something amen it will have first to think about what is supposed to do what he wants to do amen before he builds a house amen he has to start he has to draw to start drawing that house Amen to see the representation of that house the Drone man he said that that was the same thing with with God before the beginning he was a thought Amen in that thought being that thought amen he was drawing The Plan of Redemption amen how everything was supposed to happen amen how the creation was supposed to happen amen how the world was supposed to be formed am but in that state amen he couldn't create so for him to create if we read in in Genesis chapter 1 I believe Genesis CH 1 verse one amen the Bible here says that in the beginning God created the Heaven and Earth and now if we go down and the Earth was without form and Bo and darkness was upon the face of the deep and now and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters amen the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters am the spirit of God was filling out every empty spaces amen so God did not have a space to create so for him to start creating amen he had to condense himself Amen to condense himself in a form amen that form that we call the logos amen and then after that that he started to speak amen remember he was a thought amen and in that thought in that state he couldn't he couldn't create amen so to create he had to become a logos the logos amen that's why we say that the word I mean that's what the Bible says that and the word of God and the Word was with God amen because that Spirit of logos had to come out of God Amen to start creating amen the prophet came after that and said that the logos is the thought expressed amen because it's the word amen the word is the thought that's being expressed amen God had to think it first and then speak it so why you see in Genesis amen God saying that let there be light amen and the light was amen because he became the word am able to speak the creation and that thing will come to happen will come to pass amen he said that let there be light amen the prophet said that the light is the Vindication of the word of God is the Fulfillment of that word that came out amen so God was a thought without being expressed amen that was before the beginning amen that was before John got the revelation of the beginning amen that was before Genesis chapter one and when he started to create amen that's when time began amen that's when John started writing that in the beginning was the word amen when God transformed himself amen by becoming the word the prophet calls it amorphic meaning that it's the same God Amen changing mask amen so the prophet here says now in the beginning God dwelt Alone with his with his attributes as I spoke of this morning that's his thoughts there was nothing just God alone but he had thoughts just like a great architect can sit down in his mind and draw out what he thinks it's going to it's going to amen create he said now he cannot create he can take something that's been created and make it a different and make it in a different form because God is the only one that can create but he gets in his mind what he's going to do and that's his thoughts that's his desires now it's a thought and then he speaks it and it's a word then amen it first starts by being a thought amen you thought about the Redemption amen you thought about everything amen then when you started to create amen he started to speak that same word amen that's when he became that logos amen that's when he became that word amen amen so here if we go down in in in uh uh uh Genesis you will see that uh uh Abraham had to meet that same God Amen when Abraham met God when he met amen the prophet said that MC was the theop Amen in that form of being a theophonic he could never be hungry amen so the theop cannot eat so he could never be hungry a theopen he cannot sympathize because it's a it's a body that doesn't have feelings amen it's a body that cannot feel pain it's a body that cannot it's a body not like our body amen so for the plan of the Redemption to come to pass amen the prophet said that that that theop that amen had to become Jesus Christ amen in the body like you and mine Amen to be able to feel our pain to be able to to to sympathize with us able to be hungry to eat with to understand what we go through in order for him to go and die on the cross for us amen the body to he could not could not die on the cross for because that's an eternal body amen it's a body that cannot die amen remember in Hebrews chapter 7 ver 13 amen the Bible says that for This MC king of Salem priest of the most high God who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the Kings and blessed him to whom also Abraham gave a 10 a tenth part of all first being the interpretation king of righteousness and after that also king of Salem which is king of peace so now verse three amen that without father without mother without descent having neither beginning of days nor end of life but made lock unto the Son of God Amen abideth a priest continually amen did not have a father amen did not have a mother amen amen did not have a beginning it did not have an End Amen because when you have a father or a mother amen you have a beginning which means that we have to keep the record when you were born amen so that's why the prophet said that that M was not Jesus Christ amen because Jesus Christ had a beginning amen Jesus Christ had an end well we see how he he down on the cross that body amen but that was was did not have a beginning that did not have a n that did not have a father and that MC did not have a mother amen but the prophet said that the MC amen he became Jesus Christ amen I'm going to read it here in the message who was this it says now now the difference between him and you as a son it said that at the beginning the word and IM morph body he came in and lived in that and the person of then later we never heard no more of of because he became Jesus Christ am was the priest by he became Jesus Christ now you B you bypass that because in that formen he know all things he knew all things amen you have never been able to know that yet amen because the prophet said that when we were the the word God uh uh uh um uh if I can say the um I don't want to use the word Evolutions but amen the way Jesus the word god came to uh the way he does things amen he has he has steps that he has to resp to respect amen the first was the the body I'm sorry the first was the word which is the theophany amen then comes the body amen and then after that it's the glorified body amen so we coming to Earth here the prophet said that we had to jump our theophany we bypassed it that's the difference between us and Jesus amen Jesus was there amen and he knew everything amen but because being the theophany amen is the word is the body is the word body amen it's the body that knows everything amen he knows the beginning and the end amen so Jesus Christ amen being the word amen he knew everything amen that's why they said to uh uh the uh those Pharisees that before Abraham was I am amen because he was that Worden because he was the one that came to Abraham because he was the one that revealed himself to Moses amen he was the one who revealed himself to all the prophets of the Old Testament amen he was the same God Amen changing masks amen that's why now we get so confused amen people start believing in three Gods amen God the Father the Son and the spirit amen but it's the same God Amen the word and the spirit amen he was the spirit in the old test amen because seeing God was death amen seeing God was an instant death amen if he wasn't when he was on the mountain amen touching that mountain was an instant death amen when he was in Moses amen people couldn't people couldn't look at Moses face to face Moses had to Veil himself amen because he had the glory of the sh because before Christ amen he was impossible for the human being to be able to see God that's why when Moses requested God to see that's why when Moses requested to see God Amen Jesus did not see show him his face am but he had to turn his back amen so that Moses could see his back because it was impossible to see him face to face so that's why he had to become the son that's why he had to make he has to be made flesh to become flesh Amen to become Jesus Christ amen so that we can talk to him so that we can see him amen so that we can touch him amen because before that amen talking to him was impossible remember the children of Israel amen after want to tell Moses Moses we don't want to hear from you anymore we want to hear from God himself amen Moses brought them to the mountain am and God was speaking to them but they couldn't understand him amen because everything that they was hearing amen was Thunders amen they couldn't translate those amen so that's why God had to send a prophets Amen to be able to translate that word for us Amen to tell us what God is saying Amen to tell us the plan of God Amen that's why God that's why that was the plan of God Amen Amos 3 amen it said that God will reveal his word to the prophet first the prophet said that why is that so it says that because God is a spirit and the spirit and the word is one amen so the prophet has the spirit of God and since the prophet has the spirit of God Amen the word of God will have to come to the prophet amen and when the word of God comes to the prophet amen then the prophet will have to give that word to the people amen that's the same thing that happened to Abraham when the son of man came to Abraham [Music] amen the son of man did not go to lot amen because that would be against the word because the word has to come to the prophet Abraham was a prophet amen so the word has to come to him amen the word has to be revealed to him first before he goes and tell it to the people amen so that's why the son of man had to come to amen and it did not go to lot amen amen the prophet continue you come like Adam like me you become you you you became from the attribute of to the flesh you became from the attribute to the flesh to be tempted but when this life is finished here if this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved we have one already waiting amen that's where we go amen that is the word then we can look back and see what we done now we don't understand it we have never become the word amen we've just become the flesh man not the word amen but clearly uh uh clearly makes it clear you will never be the word unless you was a thought in the beginning amen that proves the predestination of God you can't be the word unless you a amen you had to be in you had to be in the thinking first amen you had to be in the thinking first amen you had to be the thought first amen that's why God Amen when he was talking to job amen he was asking him job where were you amen when the Son of God was creating everything amen where were you amen you were in his mind amen because Redemption amen it's not something new Redemption it's not replacing amen but Redemption amen is to bring back what once was Amen to bring it back that's the same thing with Resurrection amen it's to bring back what what what what was first amen Redemption let's say for example I had this bottle of water amen and I lost it for some reason amen I lost this bottle of water amen and I took another one amen it's still a bottle of water amen and I take it and I say that this is the same thing no it's different this is not Redemption amen this is replacing amen Redemption amen is to find that was lost amen and to bring it back amen that is the Redemption amen so you were in the thought of God before amen you were in the thinking of God Amen and when you became flesh amen you amen you fa with Temptations and and sin amen you lost mean you you lost your your birth right amen the devil Satan now had a claim on you amen so God had to redeem you back amen he was not finding for another person he did not find another person amen he did not find another brother Joseph no he did not find another brother Isaac he did not someone else but he had to find that same person that was in his thought am to bring him back amen that is redemption amen that is Redemption for us amen and the only way to do that amen he had to become flesh amen that's what we say amen God had to express himself in his son for his sons amen he had to express himself Amen to become a son to become that word made flesh amen for you and me amen for his sons and his daughters amen that's the purpose amen become become the son of his own house may a high priest of his own house amen amen Hebrews chap 4:4 16 amen the Bible here says seeing then that we have a great high priest that is passed into the heavens Jesus the son of God let us hold fast our profession for we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmity but was he no points temped like as we are yet without sin so now let us therefore come boldly onto the throne of grace amen that we may obtain mer obtain mercy and find Grace to help in time of need amen and the only way to do that amen you had to become a son amen you had to be made flesh amen so he came by a he came by the woman amen but he was not of the woman amen that's where the Catholic people get confused amen they go pray Mary and say that Mary since is the mother of God is's the closest person to God to that's why they pray amen so that Mary can intercede for them amen but the word tells us amen God had to respect the biology so meaning that as a baby to come as a baby of Flesh amen God had to borrow a woman and a man Amen to pretend being the father of him of the parents amen but he was not of them amen because if you look at Jesus DNA you compare it to Mary or Joseph amen it's two different DNA amen it's two different things amen it's not even close amen amen amen that's why that's why the Bible call it it was a virgin birth amen amen there was the Bible said that uh uh uh Jesus was the child of the holy spirit amen a child of God himself amen I'm not going to go there in detail that amen so Mary was there amen she had a purpose amen Joseph had a purpose well Amen to raise the son Jesus amen but they weren't the true parents of Jesus Amen because remember when Jesus was lost amen Mary and and Joseph came to him and said that your father and me have been looking for you for days amen Jesus answered he said that don't you know that I have to take care of my father's amen if you read if you read the Bible amen we will know that the father when he said the father's business amen we try to say we say well it's Joseph amen there is no scripture in the Bible where it says that Joseph lift up the Bible and started preaching amen Joseph was a carpenter amen if Jesus meant Joseph by saying that he has to take care of his this business amen he was going to be found building houses and doors and windows amen because that is his father's business Amen to take care of what his father was doing amen but Jesus was found in the temple amen preaching amen sharing the word amen taking care of his father's am because his father is the word amen so he had to be in the business of his father amen doing the exact same thing amen so God wanted to be a father amen so the only way to become a father amen he had to become a sonen he had to become a son amen the same way to become a father he had to make himself a son the prophet said in the water baptism paragraph 146 and 147 now the father Son and Holy Ghost now after he dwelt in that pill of fire then came down and and then came down and made himself a body brought himself down a tent of human flesh and dwelt in and dwelt in Among Us God dwelling First Timothy chter 3: 16 without controversy Paul speaking great is the mystery of godliness for God was manifest In the Flesh yet Creator became savior Amen in the great song of of Boo clber in the great song of boo clber WR is a songwriter that the great Creator became my savior and all God's fullness dwelleth in him amen now notice father then he was the father way above us couldn't even get around where he was at then he became son that we could touch him feel him Prophet said that he was a man and then he gave his life amen that blood cell was broken by cruel sinful Roman spear when he pierced his heart broken heart killed him his water and blood separate grief broke the cell because of the sin of the human race amen the great Creator became my savior and all God's fullness dwell in him amen so what do we mean by all God's fullness amen let's go to uh Colossians chapter 1 verse 15- 19 Colossians chapter 1 verse 15-9 amen this is the supremacy of christacy amen amen the Bible here says who is the image who is the image of the invisible God the first born of his cre the first born of every creature for for by him were all things created that are in heaven and that are in Earth visible and invisible whether there be Thrones or dominions or principalities or Powers all things were created by Him and for him and he is before all things and by him all things consist and he is the head of the body the church amen who is the beginning the first born from the dead that in all things he might have preeminence now verse 19 for he pleased the father that in him all fullness that in him should all fullness dwell Amen in him all fullness dwell amen that dwell in Jesus Christ amen remember we said amen that the logos amen was the attribute of the fullness of God Amen so in the logos was everything amen he was it was the creator the Son of God Amen the Healer amen all the attributes of God Amen was in that logos amen and throughout the ages amen God had to reveal himself amen a portion of him little by little amen I believe in a message uh I forget uh where I read amen the prophet says that amen the logos being the fullness of God Amen that's why God that's why God could not pour everything into Moses amen because Moses was a prophet amen but he poured everything into to Christ all the fullness Amen dwelt in him what you say what brother ISAC what do you mean by that amen let's turn to Matthew chapter 16 verse 16 Matthew chapter 16 verse 16th so before we read that so we have to uh uh understand that that God had to come under three sons name amen he first came as a son of man then he came as a son of as a son of as a Son of God then he will come as a son of David amen so Jesus was the son of man amen he was a human being the son of man notice that Jesus never referred himself as a Son of God Amen but he always saying that he was the son of man amen but in him dwell all the fullness of God Amen so in him was the son of man was the son of God was the son of David even though when he came to the Earth amen he came to manifest the min of the son of man am but yet in the same time amen he was all of that am because in him was D in him dwell all the fullness of God Amen so Matthew 16 verse 16 Matthew 16:16 Matthew so now God is talking to his disciples so let's go let's start to verse 13 here Matthew 16:3 amen the Bible said that when Jesus came into the coast of cesaria pH he asked his disciples saying whom do men say that I the son of man am amen himself is telling them who do men say that I the son of man because when he came he came as a son of man the son of man being a prophet amen the son of man means a prophet amen verse 14 the disciple now starting to guess amen it said that and they said and they said some say that thou are John the Baptist some say that you are El lias either say that you are Jeremiah or one of the prophets amen they didn't have no Revelation amen they started guessing what Jesus was amen they they started saying what why they've been hearing people saying so now in verse 15 Jesus made it more personal he asked them he said that and and he said unto them but whom say ye that I am amen I know what other people are saying about me but what about you my disciples amen what do you say that I am so verse 16 here and Simon Peter answered and said thou are the Christ the son of the Living God Amen Peter did not repeat by saying that thou are the cross the son of man amen because Jesus came as a son of man so he would have made sense for Peter to say that you are the son of man he was going to be correct amen but he cut the Revelation he said that you are Christ the son of the Living God Amen and Jesus instead of rebuking Peter by saying that Peter this is not my Ministry this is not something that supposed to be now it's something that's supposed to come after but Jesus praised him he said that blessed are thou Simon for the Flesh and blood has not revealed it unto thee by my Father which is in heaven amen you have got that Revelation from my father amen because he came as the son of man amen but because Peter had that Revelation amen he called him Christ the son of the the son of the Living God Amen and we know here that Jesus is not rebuke him amen because Jesus is the word and every time the word was out of context Jesus never let it go it was always rebuking the error amen we see it with his with Mary and Mary and Joseph amen they came pretending being his father amen Jesus rebuked them and said that I have to take care of my father's J so if you read in Matthew chapter 15 verse 21 to uh uh to 20 amen here the Bible is talking about that woman who wanted her daughter to Beal amen then Jesus went then and departed into the C of of and behold a woman of Canon came out of of of the same coast and Cried unto him saying saying have mercy on me oh Lord thou son of David my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil so here this woman is calling Jesus Son of David and Peter called him Son of God God praised Peter because he caught that Revelation from God himself amen but this woman he's calling the son of man son of David and instead of Jesus praising him for the revelation AC but Jesus rebuked her instead amen why did Jesus rebuke her not because she was wrong amen because he was also the son of David amen but she was rebuked because that promise was not for her because the first coming of Jesus was not for the Gentiles amen it was for the Jews alone amen so she took something that did not belong to her and tried to apply it for her for herself and Jesus being the word he knew that something was wrong so straight ahead he rebuked her saying that I am not sined but unto the lordship of the House of Israel amen because Jesus was sent to the lordship of Israel amen not to the Gentiles amen but she came claiming Jesus being the son of the son of David amen verse 25 then came she and worshiped him saying Lord help me but he answered and said it is not meat to take the children's bread and cast it to dogs amen Jesus even compared her called her a dog amen but her faith was so strong amen she kept on going amen she kept on going amen she said truth Lord that's the truth yet the dogs of the crumbs which fall from the master's table amen now she's starting to know her place amen and then Jesus answered and said unto her oh woman great is thy faith be it unto thee even as thou will and her daughter was made whole from that very hour amen you see that Jesus had to rebuke her amen because she wasn't a Jew amen but she was taking something that didn't belong to her amen but if we go to Luke chapter 18 Luke chapter 18 L uh verse 35-42 verse 45 to3 42 uh 35- 42 Luke 18 35-32 amen where we read in uh uh Matthew 15 a woman calling Jesus Son of David and Jesus rebuked her and now here you see the blind B amen the Bible says here and it came to pass that as he was Come N unto Jericho a certain blonde man Sat by the way side begging and here on the multitude passed by he asked what he meant and they told him that Jesus of Nazareth passed by and cried and he cried saying Jesus thou son of David have mercy on me amen it's the same you know calling Jesus the same thing amen the woman called him son of David she was rebuked but here the blind Bim calling him son of David amen but God healed him instead amen because she was from the he was from the house of Israel amen God came to them amen God came to manifest himself to them amen so even though he called him son of David amen he wasn't wrong amen because in him IM dwell all the fullness of God IM dwell all the fullness amen Peter had the Revelation that he was the son of God Jesus said amen to it amen because in him amen he had that logos amen that was also a Son of God amen amen amen the blind barus called him the son of David amen remember the son of Jesus will come as the son of David Jesus will come as the son of David Amen to Reign Amen to be on his throne to Reign amen so when he came in his first coming he came as a son of man amen as a prophet amen he did not come as a Son of God because a Son of God is a spirit amen a Son of God is a spirit amen that's what in Genesis I believe chap chapter two I believe when God said that let us make men in our [Music] image amen you will understand the first man that was made it wasn't the physical man amen it was man's spirit amen because the image of God is a spirit amen so him being the son of God he's a spirit amen it's that logos amen it's that pill of fire amen it's that holy spirit amen that is the Son of God Amen that's what Jesus said amen I have to go up amen I have to die first amen and go up am so that God can send the Son of God Amen so that the ministry of the son of God becomes available to you because they couldn't dwell both of them couldn't be at the same place because it was the same person so one had to give away to another amen that's God being a Morphin amen changing mask amen a son of man amen is a man a human being amen that you can touch that you can talk to amen he will be hungry amen he will eat amen he will sleep amen he is a human being amen a Son of God Amen he is a spirit amen you can't see him amen you can't touch him amen amen he can't eat amen because he's a spirit and the son of David amen he is a king amen he comes to Reign Amen to take his throne amen of his father Amen to Reign amen so that's why God had to make Express himself in order for him to reveal himself to you amen he had to become a son amen for your Redemption amen he had to become the son of man amen to die on the cross for you Amen to lead you in all truth amen he had to become the Son of God Amen so that he can dwell inside of [Music] you amen and that spirit will lead you in all truth Amen to Reign and to become a king amen it will have to be the son of David amen God Express himself in the son amen for his sons amen a son amen is a shape that God takes Amen to reveal himself to to his people amen that's why we call a son amen the logos the prophet called it the Son of God Amen it was a shape that God took Amen to lead the children of Israel amen he was that Pillar of Fire amen he was that cloud amen he was that logos that revealed himself to the prophet amen he was that son amen so that is God Amen that is his purpose Amen in closing amen I had a lot to say Amen but uh because of time we going to jump and try to Amen in closing on Amen we read the the prophet here looking for that U scripture all right I'm I'm in closing I'm want to read the prophet here and the message the true Easter seal paragraph 261 I mean 206 amen um let's see here if we read this we're going to jump into something else I won't I won't be I won't be able to close five minutes amen let's read uh question and answers questions and answers chapter amen paragraph 209 and 101 amen here is somebody asking the question amen is asking brother Bram a question it says some say brother Bram is the son of Go is is the son of man and I thought the pill of fire was the son of man am I mistaken amen so here's the answer brother brand amen he said that well that's a good question very good but I am not I'm not the son of man but a son of men there is quite a difference Jesus Christ was the son of man the Son of God the son of man the son of David amen but I am a son of man amen because amen as we say it the first coming of the son of man amen was for the house the lost sheep of Israel amen that's why God had to rebuke that woman when she called him the son of David amen so God did not want the Gentiles just to go like that without experiencing the same thing amen so that's why he promised amen that the same thing that happened that he did amen that he would do it again Amen in uh uh Luke Chapter 177e let's see where is it Luke chapter 17 all right Luke chapter 17 here uh verse 30 Luke all right let's start with verse 28 amen hear the Bible saying likewise also as it was in the days of lot they did eat they drank they bought they sold they planted they build it but the same day that lot went out of Sodom he ran fire and a brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all even thus shall it be in the day when the son of men is revealed amen even thus shall it be in the days where the son of man shall be revealed in that day he which shall be upon the Housetop and his staff in the house let him not come down to take to take it away and he that is in the field let him likewise not return back amen even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed amen so here this promise or this word that Jesus was saying amen it was not really for him Jesus Christ being their present the son of man amen it was for another Ministry of the son of man that was supposed to and when that Ministry of the son of man will be revealed amen then we will know that the end is near amen it's that Ministry had to be revealed again amen the ministry of the son of man amen that's why when when when uh uh that person asked brother Bram asking brother bam if he was the son of man Amen brother bam had to correct him and say that I am I'm not the son of men but I am a son of man amen with the ministry of a son of man to reveal the son of man amen to reveal the son of man meaning that to do the exact same thing that Jesus did amen what is the ministry of the son of man amen when the son of man went to Abraham amen he did three things amen the first thing amen he gave the word he revealed the word to he revealed the revealed uh uh the uh he discerned was discern amen he knew what Sarah was thinking amen the second thing amen he revealed the word amen and the third thing he had communion amen those are the three things he did amen he revealed the word saying that shall I hide to Abraham what I'm about to do amen that he revealed Abraham what he was supposed to do amen the second time when that Ministry came again on Earth amen Jesus Christ himself being the son of man amen he did all those three things again amen he revealed the heart he revealed the thoughts amen of that woman at the well amen he told her of all the of the husbands he had amen he revealed the word amen and he had communion as the Las thing with his disciples amen so according to this amen that Ministry had to come again amen it had to be revealed again and that ministry will have to do that three things again amen what was it amen to reveal the thoughts amen that's why you will see sometimes when bram's Ministry amen he had to turn his back to the people amen and discern the thoughts of people amen and say sister you there you going through this and that and this amen it was that Ministry that he was revealing amen the second thing amen was to reveal the word amen we have the Seven Seals amen the seventh seal was a secret amen but now it is revealed to us amen the third thing amen it was a communion amen that was the last message of brother brand was communion that was the ministry of the son of man amen repeating every time amen I said I didn't want to go through this amen it was the same Ministry amen repeating itself amen because we understand amen that brother bam had actually two Ministry that two purpose that had to accomplish one of Malachi 4 and the other one of the of revealing the son of man amen it's two different things amen Malachi for being Elijah amen his ministry was the ministry of restoration amen he had to restore amen that's why you see brother bam preaching about marriage and divorce amen that was the ministry of Elijah that was the ministry of Malachi 4 amen that's why you see brother Ram preaching about the baptism in the name of Jesus Christ amen that was the ministry of restoration amen that's why you see brother Ram preaching about the serpent seed Amen brother Ram teaching on Grace Amen brother Bram teaching on justification sanctification BM of the Holy ghosten telling us that there are no women angels and no women preachers amen telling us that the the difference between Eternal uh uh uh that there is no eternal hell amen preaching about predestination election and and free moral amen that was the ministry of Malachi 4 amen that Ministry amen had to make way a way amen for the ministry of the son of man amen so that the son of man being being revealed he had to clear that first put everything in order telling us that he is not God amen telling us that brother Bram is not God that he is only a prophet amen that has a purpose that he has to fulfill amen he was re was rebuilding the altar he came down and showed us that the only name of worship is the the Lord Jesus Christ that only with the name of Jesus Christ that we are saved that only with the name of Jesus CHR we receive the Forgiveness of our sinsen he had to make clear that everything is being understood first amen before manifesting the other Ministry before because if he did not restore it he was going to create a big confusion people were still worshiping brother brand people will start calling him God in order to avoid all those confusions he had to rebuild the altar first amen showing that Jesus Christ amen he's the only one who's supposed to be worship he's The Only Name That's supposed to be lifted up amen showing amen that there is no comparation you cannot compare brother br and Jesus Christ amen even though their Ministry might be so similar yet you can never compare the two because Jesus Christ was a virgin born amen he never sinned he never lied never made mistakes never was confused never came back and corrected himself amen he was different amen he was God himself amen people worshiped himen people knelled before him people worshiped him amen but when he came to brother Brandon amen he was a human being as you and me amen he had his struggles amen he had his own personal things that he had to go through he had his own mistakes that he had amen he came down amen amen had to do that the ministry of Malachi 4 Amen to make sure there's a difference between them two amen that can never be compared amen not under any circumstances amen not under any situation amen you can't place them in the same level amen amen because brother bam had that Ministry amen let's go ahead and read that quote that we wanted to read first if I can find it here in the true Easter SE paragraph 206 amen here the prophet says now you just see if he is still the same if he is still the high priest that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities now this is Brother Bram talking to to someone amen revealing that Ministry of the son of man he said that I never seen you in my life you're a stranger to me I know nothing about you but God knows God does know you amen you see he had to make that difference that him brother Bram had no idea of who that person was amen but God who knows everything amen knew exactly who that person was and now he continue he said if he God can reveal to me by his holy spirit the resurrected Christ who come here and give me a temporary Resurrection by my spirit that my spirit goes away now and his Spirit comes in then to let you know whether he is alive or not now I don't know you that's me I don't know you me and my spirit amen we don't know you amen amen but he knows you so now here here he's saying that but he God wants to borrow my body Amen to prove that he is the resurrected Christ amen and I'm so happy to loan it to him give to him anything he can get out of it before brother Bram say this amen he had to make sure amen that him himself being the person brand the son of Charles brand had no idea of the person that was in front of him he specifically said that me and my spirit amen we have no idea of who you are amen but God wants to borrow my body amen he wants to come in amen he wants to express that Ministry of the son of man amen so in order for him to do that and the only way for him to do that I have to borrow him my body meaning that I have to let my spirit go Amen to let him come in Amen to perform that Ministry amen because him know he knows who you are am he knows exactly who you are amen so by reading this people reading this now they get all confused amen they started making brother brand of God Amen making him who is not amen by him him being CLE here saying that I don't know you amen me and my spirit we don't know you that's me me and my spirit we don't know you but he knows you but he wants to borrow my body he wants to borrow this body Amen to prove that he is the resurrected Christ and I'm so happy to learn it amen if you read other other quotes amen you will see brother brandham saying amen he said that the logos came down amen it's in his church he said that the deity is now in in is now in men amen because of that Spirit when it comes in you amen he makes you a deity amen you become God Amen you become God Amen because God cannot speak unless he uses your mouth amen God cannot touch unless he uses your hand amen you become God Amen it's like Moses amen God told Moses that you will be God for for Aaron amen Aaron will be your prophet and you will be God Amen because God was using his mouth amen that did not make Moses God Amen Moses did not become the object of of of worship he was just something that God used to deliver a message to his people amen that did not change Moses to make him God Amen it with brother Branden God used his mouth Amen in other quotes if you read it you will see God himself talking and said that this is me God talking amen but still that doesn't make brother brandham God Amen it doesn't give you the opportunity to go worship amen because the only name that you can worship amen it's the name of the Lord Jesus chist amen The Only Name that can save you is the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen The Only Name that can heal you it's the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen The Only Name that can give you the RT amen it's the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen The Only Name that can save your family it's the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen it's not the name of Paul amen it's not the name of Moses it's not the name of br it's not the name of Elijah amen but it is the name of Jesus Christ himself amen because it's that name amen every knee shall bow amen every tongue shall confess amen that he is God Amen he is God Amen the name that's above all other name amen the devil hears that name and he Tres amen demons heal that name and they ran away it's with name of Jesus Amen so we are supposed to lift him up we supposed to praise Him amen we supposed to thank him am we supposed to worship him we supposed to give him all the praise we supposed to give him all the honor we're supposed to reverence that name amen the name of Jesus Christ amen so take the name of Jesus with you amen everywhere you go amen take that name with you amen everywhere you go take that name with you amen if you sick take that name with you amen if you have problems amen take that name with amen if you have a need take that name with you amen if you have a question I need answer am take that name with you it's only under his name amen that you will receive your heart desire amen it's only under his name am that you will
