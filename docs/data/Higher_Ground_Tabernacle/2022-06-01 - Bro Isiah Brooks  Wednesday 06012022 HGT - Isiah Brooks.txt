they also may be one in us that the world may believe that thou hath sent me and the glory which thou gaveth me i given them that they may be one even as we are one i in them thou in me that they may be made perfect in one and that the world may know that thou has sent me and has loved them as thou has loved me oh i get excited every time i read that particular scripture it is a sure salvation revelations one and eight [Music] i am alpha and omega the beginning and the end which is which was and which is to come the almighty one more scripture please that'll come we'll come from matthew 6 and 6 but thou when thou prayest enter into thy closet when thou has shut thy door pray to thy father which is in secret and thy father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly let us pray our gracious father god we thank you for your amazing grace we thank you for being so good to us thank you for being the god of heaven the god of earth the god of the universe and thank you for dwelling within us it is an honor and a privilege lord jesus to know that you have made us your tabernacle and we ask in your lovely name that you have free course here this night tonight let your perfect will be done we ask these days in jesus christ's name we pray amen you may be seated when we think about the message that malachi 4 brought us we must always remember that this message is called the end time message reason being is because we really believe that malachi 4 the one though be little amen there will be those who will have faith in it because remember the rapture will not be this great number of people in this age that will be translated it will be a few even as not being one in a million so we know that by god's grace that it's not by human effort yeah you can't be saved by because i chose god no no you didn't choose god god chose you and because he chooses us he doesn't make a mistake you understand me and everyone he has chosen has been chosen for a purpose amen now the purpose in which god has chosen us far may not be some grand thing you know because we realize that then hollywood brings to us that you have to be this great superstar superhero in order to be to gain recognition but in god's eyes what he calls great men call foolish and what what god what we we you know i mean god calls it foolish rather and we understand that when god calls something great it's really humble great he said what do you mean just like john the baptist he came out of the wilderness looking like a wild man and i love to say it like this you know eating a wild uh honey eating wild locust and popping them in his mouth like peanuts you know but he looked like a crazy man he wasn't properly dressed his hair wasn't calm his teeth wasn't brushed you know he was just one of those things that we would see today as a homeless person but remember jesus was a homeless person too he said uh foxes have hoes and birds have nests but the son of man has no place to lay his head so we realized that even the early church they weren't a grand dude there wasn't something greater puffed up they they weren't pompous but they were small they were lowly so much so they didn't have much because when peter approached the gator beautiful and he saw the man who was crippled he said silver and gold have a none but such as i have give id so it shows us that something is wrong with the mix something is wrong with what's happening now because now christians who used to be poor are rich and they increase with good and they have this idea in their head they have need of nothing but let me tell you something no matter how rich you become not one thing that you obtain in this world will go with you when you die the only thing that will go with you is the character of jesus christ i pray that we have that coming from the message god provided place of worship the prophet of god said but the hours come that every kingdom has to give way now you and i know amen that america is in trouble and she's poking the bear and and russia has said in their own i heard it on the news that america has declared war with her and you and i know what brother branham says he said russia will be the one that will drop the bomb but before one bomb drop we'll be gone now we don't know how how far this is going to go and how long is going to last but one thing i know is that god is dealing with his bride he's working with her right and he's he's he's literally cleaning her up and he's literally it meant changing her heart and her mind about this world because you have to hate this world there's nothing in this world for us and even though we prosper our prosperity must be uh given to the fact that your soul is prospering so what good would it do for you to prosper in this world and your soul is not prospering the word of god say what what what what what what what is to gain if you gain the whole world and lose your soul your living has been in vain but here the prophet said but the hours come that every kingdom has to give way because there is a kingdom of god that's established i love that word in the human heart huh not in heaven the human heart because heaven and earth will pass away but the word of the lord shall stand and ezekiel tells us that god is god will not only just just give us a new heart or give us a new spirit but he said that god would give us himself hallelujah in that heart and so you must understand that the kingdom of god is with where in you you must acknowledge that because it will uh how can i say it when that revelation strikes you you won't feel any more that like god is a million miles away because he said in that day you'll know that i'm in the father of the fathers in me and i'm in you i'm so happy and that's the way i pray now god i thank you for abiding in me i thank you for choosing me as your tabernacle hallelujah i have a place to worship even if this is destroyed hallelujah listen let me move on is established in the human heart by what the baptism of the holy spirit and the presence of jesus christ now he says the baptism of the holy spirit and the presence of jesus christ that's why brother brahma said justification make room for sanctification sanctification makes room for the baptism of the holy ghost and the baptism of holy ghost makes room for god or christ himself see we must understand living in the uh i got here let me finish this quote first i'm sorry i'm just excited by the baptism of the holy ghost and the presence of jesus christ and christ will come to his bride and will set up a kingdom here on earth that will never be dis diminished how do you get into this kingdom you are born into it how do you know it you just keep how would you belong into a kingdom and disagree with the king see you would be what and the king is the word in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us the same yesterday today and forever god provided place of worship 1965. so what are we doing here we have wasted so much so much time playing religion playing church now i don't believe that we intentionally did it but it was handed down to us in such a way that we fell for it hallelujah you said well what do you mean brother brooks just like the pentecostal church has has handed down all of their dogmas and their creeds and their doctrines to their offspring and their offspring are still standing on that not realizing that god has departed but to them they're right they will fight you for it and they have no idea that they have been married to a system am i right or wrong because jesus is not there revelations 3 he's on the outside of the laodicean church age and brother adam said you have to come out of that to hear his voice you said but they can shout in this i know the bible says he in all above all through all he's all in all jesus christ the living god amen he's he's the one that operates everything hello the same god that gives life to a skunk is the same god that gives life to a rabbit but you know i know that the nature of a skunk and the nature of a rabbit is totally different and they both look cute you know they're cute but to be honest with you i'm not gonna pick up a skunk i will pick up a rabbit especially one of those white fluffy ones but you know the point is we must understand the message must take us farther we've been at a standstill we have been in a place where religion has become our culture it is the truth and it's not religion religion don't save you it might cover you but it doesn't save you the bride of jesus christ knows she must be covered by the blood of jesus christ and you know and i know there are three stages that leads into the fourth justification sanctification baptism in the holy ghost and that leads you into the holies of holies which is christ and in this place man is restored back to his position before the fall now we call it behind the veil brother branham called it behind the veil brother adam also called it amen the shekinah glory and this stage has been the first age outside of the first age where the pill of fire showed himself hallelujah right when paul was going to persecute the christians the pulifiers showed up and paul fell from his horse and said who art thou lord and he said i am jesus see he said that because the people when he prayed in in saint john 17 the people and god was one hallelujah they didn't have no overseers no rulers those things came at the woods when men began to exalt themselves you know why didn't not brother branham leave a hierarchy of preachers behind him he did not and that was done for a purpose because he said this message will never organize or become an organization there's nothing wrong with being organized but when you become or an organization where everything must look the same like mcdonald's and burger king and whatever more wearing the same uniforms and acting the same way and you know what i'm saying it's wrong but we have fallen into that kind of a mess and i'ma call it just what it is we have been called to go behind the veil there will be a generation that will do it remember when israel were crossing over the uh the uh uh jordan or the jordan amen and and one or two tribes i believe once they cross over they cross back over what what was it did we do that when we crossed over we saw the pillar of fire then all of a sudden amen we moses is dead and what did we do we crossed back over and thought that the pentecostal way of doing things was going to be the one the way that was going to make us uh ready for the rapture if it didn't work for them it's not going to work for us why did the message why did we have to have the seals open why did the thunders have to roll why did the message have to come why it had to come because god needed to perfect the people pentecostal message cannot perfect you it can only take you into the spiritual realm it can never take you into the holies of holies they don't have a word to take you there they cannot but you and i must understand amen if and i believe this message with all of my heart brother bran said when those seals will open amen it took us back to the place where adam and eve was before the fall and you've heard me say that so many times the church building was not constructed by martyr and clay by adam and eve they were the house of god and you and i must understand if we're going to get back there there's got to be surrendered surrendering cementing and dying to our own will because it was the will of of adam and eve to break the word so we must die to that we can't allow this and you say well brother books don't you see something has to be wrong the bible says these signs shall follow them that believe hallelujah and even though we're not running out the gifts gifts are supposed to follow us if the word is right and the word is right god is looking for a mature bride that can handle the gifts that can handle the word why you say well what do you mean they're not trying to seek a kingdom or build a kingdom hallelujah because the kingdom is already built and jesus christ is the king of the kingdom and he's in where your heart i'm so glad that that's the way it is hallelujah where there is listen at what point in time when we realized the truth of the word that the message when it was opened made us priests and kings and yet we're running around like little poppers poor little me poor little me that's nonsense you got to understand there is no condemnation to those who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit and this message has declared to us that we have been completely justified as though we've never seen him in the first place hallelujah and listen what i'm saying when it comes to judgment the bible says that judgment begins at the house of god you know what we were thinking this church no sir judgment began at your house and if you're the house of god you're the one that's judging your sins hallelujah come on somebody but if you judge your sins correctly the bible said that god has given us a freedom from the conscience that will condemn us that's why we can't do nothing for god we're so busy judging ourselves looking at ourselves we are so unworthy how can that be if god has made you worthy how can you say you're not worthy he's made you worthy by the blood of the lamb you've got to come up higher and have the mind of christ if you are accepted in the beloved that means you cannot be rejected but the thing is the problem with us is that we have been so traditionalized we say we're not catholics and yet and still we do repentance hallelujah god said before you even called me i heard you i forgave you before you open up your mouth hallelujah the blood has washed us clean we are not a filthy church we are the bride of jesus christ because we are in him and he is in us he said father i pray that they be one even as well y'all don't know i feel like shouting up here he he's here and the anointing of god is trying to penetrate these things that just condemns you all the time your flesh will be with you until god changes it and it will never ever walk with god not your flesh it is your enemy but god knows your enemy and god nailed your enemy to the cross hallelujah yes he did he defeated satan for you and when we began to see those things we'll begin to understand we are an invisible army but god cannot operate through us if we don't believe it that's why satan works so hard on us he works with our conscience in the way we feel that your feeling has nothing to do with it amen the real you you don't even know him yet the real you is when you can go behind the veil when you go behind the veil and you shut yourself in like like brother branham said amen you'll realize amen that it is there you find yourself it is there you come alive it is there you begin to see life for what it really is hallelujah but until then you still looking through a glass darkly like paul said hallelujah you understand me you and i must understand that god is calling for a bride that's going to be bound by the word and when i say the word i'm not talking about the little the the the rhema you know what i mean we're talking about the logos hallelujah and you can't get the logos without the rhema you got to have the letter but you have to have the revelation of it it's important brother said when we get over there we'll realize how important revelation was to us hallelujah god is not pleased he's not pleased with what he see when we call ourselves he's not pleased it's not his work that has failed but it's us we have failed him in the sense that we're not taking his word you won't be the first one he's rebuked on the road to emmaus he walked with three a disciple two disciples amen that should have known he said oh fools and slow of heart did you not and why didn't you believe all that the scripture have said concerning me or the messiah then he went through all the prophets he opened the book the word was opened and he began to preach who jesus hallelujah is that what he did in his last day through the through william brown and what did he do the book was open and he didn't preach himself he preached jesus the same yesterday the day and forever a god that changed not he was the only man on this earth that was able to go all the way back to the old testament and bring it up to the new testament and gave us a vision of what it is it was god in him god in him and what you're going to do with the scripture that says who going to lay in the charge that god's elect i'm so tired of these pharisees and sadducees in this message and all they want to do is point fingers at you and you ain't doing this and you ain't doing that let me tell you something all of us is in flesh and you can't tell me you walk in perfect in this flesh your perfection only comes by jesus christ he said well i'll never do that but you thought it and the bible said there's a man thinking this is hard so is he you're guilty brother branham said we're failures to begin with but we must understand this failure the failure that we used to be god has made us victorious paul so said paul even said we're more than conquerors don't tell me you can't conquer whatever the devil brings before you you can conquer it through christ jesus is that right why because great is he that's in you than he that is in the world that's the word but we're so busy with hollywood and i have to be careful because i can get excited and dramatic uh cold and everything else but you know i don't mean to i just it just excites me but there are those you think running up and down now he you know what i'm saying preaching like that it's okay if that's what you want to do but my point is who's being changed with all that excitement with all that music with all that choir and all of the things that we've been doing just like pentecost it's all right if the people are being changed and this word comes to change you it came from out of the holies of holies and if you lay in the presence of the word it will change you that's what i'm talking about you can jump as high as you want to like the prophet of god said as long as you live in it but the life comes first then the jumping i'm alpha and omega i want you to think about this when god opened this up to me he showed me something i had never seen before i'm alfred omega that means he's the first and the last he's the beginning and the ending right he which which is which was and which is to come the same yesterday today and forever same scripture right but what is he trying to tell you anything outside of me won't be there what was with me in the beginning will be with me at the end and nothing in between you understand me you have had to you had to be an attribute of god in the beginning and if you were attributing to god with god in the beginning you'll be a manifestation of that attribute at the end nothing can that's why the bible said nothing no weapon formed against you shall prosper listen it doesn't matter who's talking about you and spreading lies and whatever people do nowadays they they still people why do you get upset with it your adversary is the devil brother so and so sister so so grow up mama junior hit me you know that kind of stuff we gotta crawl you know it's all right to take licks it's okay let me tell you something before the bride gets up out of here you and i will go through what we call a squeeze we don't know how bad that's going to be you mean like food you might like clothes you may like house whatever the case may be will you still love him that's the only way you're going to make it it cannot be fill your love it can't be religious love it has to be the love of god which is divine in your soul peter even said lord you know i love you god you know i love you but he said peter you're going to deny me three times peter was greed because he really loved jesus in the filial but it wasn't enough it wasn't enough then it won't be enough now you got to have a divine love and that divine love comes through prayer you don't have to shout you don't have to dance you don't have to run up and down the aisles all that's good if that's what you do but the point is when all that is done do you have the peace of god in your soul listen he said what now you're the temple of god that's what paul said he had to speak to the corinthians because they were such a wild group the corinthians they had everything going on in the church all kinds of natural disasters and and and paul had to say hold up no ye not you are the temple of god if you devour the temple god is going to destroy you hello now he could not have been talking to the bride because that's not the way the bride operates but he had to send out the warning hello somebody but here's the key one of the things that i think that most people missed when we talked about the ark of the covenant and the way israel had everything set up they they missed the most important thing and that was the priest with that incense and that incense was waved and that instance represents prayer and you know what you didn't hear it it was a silence it was a secret because even today israel don't know what it means but the bride of jesus christ understands the power of prayer you understand me he said when you pray shout out no no no no he said go in your closet shut down in your heart pray here hallelujah because listen it ain't about how loud you you pray he said listen this is a secret this is a love affair ah i'm on your throne talk to me not here here because now because you're in need we're sitting in heavenly places in christ jesus and he said when you pray oh i could tell you i've got some good testimonies but they're not ready they're not ready yet but i can tell you something happened the other day and my wife says oh you handle it because you the one prayed for it and it's true i did but i did not expect it to come so soon praise god i'm just being honest with you and what i'm trying to say is i didn't say it i didn't tell the devil what i needed i'm learning how to really commune with him and he's communing with me hallelujah you say do you make mistakes yeah i make mistakes and he saw it he's seen it before i made the mistakes you know i i loved what brother ben he set me free then said yeah god understand your weaknesses and he cares for you hallelujah so the devil said we know god don't care for me why do i have to go through this all the time i i've been there i can't tell you how many times i've been there but one thing i know if you sincerely ask god to overcome he's going to do it because you're asking according to his will huh what meat what can it be lust of the flesh the lust in the eye and the pride of life if you're battling with one or two or three of these or all three he said whatever that is you can overcome it blessed is there those who overcome these things and people it ain't you it's the overcomer in you what happens when you pray in secret god began to bring it into the public god began to let other people see they said man that brother is blessed oh that sister is blessed but it ain't because you know how to pray the protocol is very important and you got to understand your jesus for the day you say oh brother brooks now what are you saying well the jesus that people worship yesterday is not the same it's the same jesus but it's unfolded in a greater way you say well how can you say that because remember the woman at the well and you talking about the law huh but one thing jesus commit gave the jewish people a compliment he said to the woman he said the jews know who they worship but you samaritan you don't know what you worship understand what i'm trying to say even though they so-called worship the same are looking for the same god in worship but they had a different revelation of him amen and so is it today everybody some people think jesus is baby jesus still in a manger somebody thinks he's two people three people you know that kind of stuff somebody some people think he's in uh is a lesser god to god he cannot be if he is he's a liar and he cannot lie he said i and the father are one and all you got to do is say lord explain that to me so i'll tell you if you can't see it god and jesus christ being one you'll never be able to see you in god being one it's a revelation see is god alone in his attributes this whole scene of redemption was only given to us that we might know him in a different way so when we get there we won't do another lucifer thing alpha and omega the first and the last with him from the beginning listen people of god so that you understand i'm working with predestination when i was a baptist i was saved when i became an apostolic i was saved when i came into this message i was saved what dare you say that were you baptized in the name of jesus christ yet i was baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ before the foundation of the world i got the holy ghost before the foundation of the world that's on record it didn't happen in time it happened when there was none i feel like shouting here and the devil always trying to throw something at you only be elected those who were with him from the beginning will be there at the end and nothing can stop it this is why i'm saying people believe it say lord i want to be about my father's business whatever it is i want to do it for you if it ain't nothing but providing you with a donkey did you know that that man who provided jesus with that donkey was ordained to provide him with that donkey and you never hear nothing else about him but with all my heart i know he'll be there it's a secret place that's why god just puts us into a little simple place like this and you know i i sometimes i thought many times i i surely want me a building but i only want a building if god wants us to have one and if this is the place that he set us in until he till we change and go in the rapture so be it i'm not here to interpret his word i'm just here to preach it and however he interpreted he interprets it the way he wants to and i'm going to say amen to it either way it goes he said well what do you mean brother works listen it's gotten to a place that even people now don't know how to pray that's why they can't pray long they don't know how to pray or what to pray for when there's gazillions of things that we need to pray for god wouldn't tell you to pray without ceasing if there was nothing to pray for but the truth of the matter is we're just too selfish we just pray for our needs and we forget about everybody else's but there are so many things to pray for i can't go through the list but you should never work you should never run out of words and you got to understand by god's grace amen that when we do pray we are in union with the holy spirit it's not a ritual it cannot be a ritual or a tradition then we become like catholics we worship just you know what's the difference if you're going to use the our father's prayer like the rosary beads same tre same same stuff don't even understand what the our father's prayer is don't even know what it means we think it's just a little nice prayer that we sing amen by the grace of god god knows who he talking to and you and i must understand when it comes to these things amen it's not because we are so smart that we got it it's because god reveals it to us he that dwelleth in the secret place of the most high shall abide under the shadow of the almighty and i know people in this message don't like for me to talk this way but i don't care what you think about it i go and do and i do what god tells me to do i'm not going to get you all excited because right now we need change it's going to be heaven or hell there ain't going to be no in between if there is a purgatory this is it y'all look like so sad y'all look so sad i'm not gonna say nothing but you gotta understand by god's grace he that dwelleth in the secret place of the most high i don't know how to tell you like i have to use the word y'all because it includes everybody but those of us who not included in that you know you're not but don't correct the holy spirit he knows who he's talking to he that dwelleth in the secret place of the most high shall abide under the shadow of the almighty i will say of the lord he is my refuge and my fortress my god in him will i trust psalms 27 3-8 says though and hosting camp shouldn't camp against me my heart shall not fear though war should rise against me in this will i be confident what is the message to you and my point is this where is jesus christ then he said if they say low here and lo there don't go where the carcass is there were the eagles be gathered what are you saying brother brooks until we realize that we the bride of jesus christ is the manifestation of jesus christ for this hour you got to see it you got to understand who you are and what god has called you for he did not call you here to go hollywood on him that's what pentecost did oh they got the sensations and they can make the money and they can pull the people and everything else and make them speak in tongues and everything else and what did you get but a conglomeration of mess and then over here you know you say well you don't get the holy ghost this whole you get the holy ghost but holy ghost without sensation but that don't mean you dead we got people here that are dead and people by the grace of god i can't tell you i can't give you life i cannot but the holy ghost can though in that house shouldn't camp against me my heart shall not fear the war shall rise against me and this will i be confident one thing i have desired or desired of the lord that will i seek after one thing that must be your prayer priority this one thing if not the devil will get you it doesn't matter who we who you are and who you claim to be your earnest desire is to be what god wants you to be in this last day and you'll never complete that until you find yourself behind the veil how many people in the message have died believing they were there and found out they were not because they followed a prophet and never met jesus because they were married to a system oh y'all we're gonna we're gonna have a rude awakening i don't know who they are but i'm sure there have been many people who can live any kind of way but because i follow william branham he's my prophet he's this that the other listen brother branham was never your savior and if you think like that you're lost already jesus christ is the only one that's your savior it took his blood to redeem you that's why i love brother branham because he always did exalted jesus christ he never ever uh exalted himself during wholesome camp against me my heart shall not fear the war should rise against me in this will i be confident why are you reading this because brother branham said this is he preached the rapture out of this particular scripture and if he preached the rapture out of his this scripture that means this scripture is prophecy i will not fear oh come on somebody you see that police car coming in your your and you're not even wrong but your heart skip a beat i will not fear cast that fear down when you know when you know you're right you stand for it you don't care about what nobody thinks about it you stand on writing that i might dwell listen i just want to say it like this we've got a lot of pain and sorrow coming up the road and i don't think what we the people who we call bride is not ready for it i don't know where god gonna make us ready how it's gonna happen but i know as we are now people can't take little things people still have that spirit of fighting in them physically and the sad thing about that that means you're not born again you ain't got the goods right because though peter had the ability to cast out devils though he had the ability you know to preach the gospel hallelujah he still was not converted and he followed jesus and he wanted to take the head off of that soldier the soldier duck and he got his ear and god had already told him he wasn't converted for in the time of trouble he should hide me in his pavilion in the secret place of the tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me up upon a rock am i here to condemn you i am not that's not what i'm doing i'm literally trying to spread love to you tonight i'm trying to get you to see by god's grace it's all right the bible says according to revelation repent leonard said we're always repenting listen but if you read your church age book if you haven't read you can see the nicolaitan spirit is among us it is call it what you want to but it's really that's what it is if it wasn't so we would have never been divided because nicolaitanism divides people your group against mine my group against yours because my leader preached different from yours and he's more deeper than yours and listen the amount of knowledge you know is not what gets you there because you could be as ignorant as a rock but if you know how to pray and get a hold of god you'll be there now shall my head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me therefore will i offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy i love to see that i'd love to see some joy i was seeing yeah i would sing praises unto his unto the lord hear o lord hear o lord when i cry with my voice have mercy upon me and answer me when thou shalt seek thy my face and that's what he's saying seek my face my heart said unto thee thy face lord will i seek seek me uh seek me upon a rock set me upon a rock right so listen give me a revelation and that's what he'll do because your born-again experience is a revelation before it is ever a good feeling it's a revelation it's when faith breaks to you and you are identified in christ by your faith in christ am i bride can i ask you something if you're not bribed then what's going to qualify you what can you do to make yourself pride tell me what can you do the bible says you can't even have one cubit to your statue so how in the world we're going to make a statue of a perfect man brother branham said it's not you that add to it he adds to you you get born again you get that sea quicken and it will grow in you oh help me jesus it's so much but when thou prayeth enter into that closet and when thou has shut thy door pray to thy father you can have a literal closet if you want to i do but the point is amen you always should have somewhere you could pray and not be interfered with because just as sure you you you set a time to pray or tell somebody i'm getting ready to pray your phone gonna ring off the hook the secret of life is found in a secret place is that right oh come on even in the natural when two come together it is in a secret place i'm almost done just just i'm almost done but i'm here to to i know i'm screaming because i i don't know what else to do i know what god is doing in me i know what he's doing in me he's changing me and i know that i see that and i'm glad about that i'm closer to him now than i ever been you know what i don't care you know the thing is people don't know this nobody knows this the only person that knows this is god himself i don't know what's in your heart but god knows what's in my heart as well as yours and god also thank god he didn't save us on merits well you know you've been a pretty good boy i think i'll save you no he never works with that usually he get the scum of the earth like myself huh all the years that i've been saved i wish it would have taken the same moment i got saved to clean me up but it didn't work that way and it doesn't work that way but just like i tell people by god's grace i have been as honest with god as i possibly can i don't say as you've heard me say before lord forgive me of my known and my unknown sins i got enough conscience and enough holy ghost to know when i sin you're unknown oh lord help us jesus i don't mean to laugh but it's the truth people pray like that i've heard them pray that's when they don't know god why would god say if your conscience condemn you then you're condemned why say that because he set a law within you whether you were sinner or saint for that they shall come upon thee that thine enemy shall cast a trent about thee and compass thee round and keep thee in on every side and shall lay thee even with the ground thou children within thee and they shall not leave in leave in thee one stone upon another because thou kneweth not the time of thy visitation and i'm gonna tell you something that's exactly what has happened to us jesus was right there the word was right there preaching to them trying to get them to see a different order is come and that order was grace and he came in our day through william branham and gave us a new order and yet we so many people didn't realize the visitation it wasn't the man it was god in the man they if they understood paul paul didn't say well you know i'm the angel to the church he didn't know it and if he did he couldn't tell nobody but look what he did it was something compelling him to preach the word of god in a way that nobody else could do it's like jesus christ nobody fully understood him until he died then after his death he became the testator became a testament a new one by the blood and then that gospel was so hard to preach because they were so bound by the law think about it in the smyrna church age which means builder of bitterness they hated the christians because they were preaching grace i'm talking about the jews in smyrna hated the christians burned them to the stakes whatever they could do to kill them they even as i was i was told they even broke the sabbath to build fires to burn them up you understand what i'm saying that hatred is not gone the hatred is still here the only thing that's keeping it now bound is the law but wait to that law is lifted when the church or the christian church will become the enemy to the world and you can see that thing moving politically already what you're going to do are you going to be ashamed of your faith are you going to be shamed what god has done for you and listen people the world hates william branham they don't know they don't understand but a prophet is without honor in his own country and every prophet was killed in a bad way they hated isaiah so much they cut him in half they didn't understand their visitation and because you don't understand your visitation that means you left in darkness and the judgment of the lord will strike going on and he says listen and when he and when he and he went into the temple and began to cast out them that showed therein and them that bought saying unto them it is written my house is the house of prayer but ye have made it a den of thieves oh that's not in our day yes it is you got preachers with tons of money tons and the people still walking the church ain't holly got no clothes huh it's true don't be talking about my preacher well it's true i'm not saying people are doing these things willfully but you see they've been caught up into the system too and it's going to take god to reveal to them don't worry he will the bible said he'll never come short with of one no all that was in his mind to be bride will be there no matter what it takes to bring them up it's going to happen some of us are being led by like a lamb and some of us will have to be driven by like cattle but we'll be there but the lord is in his holy temple let all the earth keep silence before him you know i'm looking at the scripture and i've seen it so many times and i thought oh there it is paul said it's not i that live but christ that lives in me paul is saying this or earth has come to a dead silence my mind my mind and my mind is gone they used to say it he's just saying that song in the pentecost my mind is gone yeah you can take it another way too but the problem the truth of the matter is is true you and i say well brother brooks is too hard no it's not hard don't say that don't even let the devil put it in your mind you know it's hard when you think human effort yes it's hard because you can't accomplish that but prayer god can and that's what you must that's where you that's where see david understood it he said i looked toward the hill for when's coming from my health and my health cometh from the lord you think jonah knew where which way to turn when he was in the belly of the well by faith god turned him you don't know the way i don't know it i'm being led by the lamb of god right now his leadership you say brother brooks you preaching different from everybody else i can't help it when you see what you see you must declare what you see watchmen on the wall what are the night he said the night cometh and so does the morning right you and i must understand this is a dark time and i have been ordained to declare what i see i don't care about friendships as long as i got friendship with jesus that's all that matters you say oh brother brooks you keep you keep preaching like that i ain't coming back well you're not leaving me you're leaving god they didn't understand it when jesus said eat my flesh and drink my blood they left him because they disagreed with his dog or doctrine they didn't understand it listen if they only had stood still just for a little while god would have revealed it to him but instead they walked away because they had all of this stuff in their head this message is a revelation god in you christ in you the hope of glory and let me say it like this you're not getting getting getting to heaven on your morality morals it will not get you there because there's so many people in different religions who have better morals than all of us but morals is not it have you been washed in the blood of the lamb that's it within the soul of man are no emotions and that's what you must understand william branham state that there is only one that dwells in the heart and that's either faith or doubt oh let me say this and then i'm gonna close because it's almost nine o'clock in in the way of a true prophet of god he says i do believe that's paragraph 138 i do believe in purgatory but i believe it's right now you purge your own soul purgatory means to purge and when you see listen purging is not easy you say what do you mean you women sisters y'all know when you got a stain this is the way it used to be we used to wash with our hands you know and we scrub it put that soap on there and try to get that thing out right and when you couldn't get it you put more on it and then you get a brush but you got to be careful because you could brush a hole in it done that too so my point is listen you got to be purged purgatory means to purge and when you see you've done something wrong get out there and clean it out of you by confession and crying and fasting and praying [Music] see whatever it takes this got to go that's what he's saying whatever demons in me it got to go whatever darkness that's influencing me it has to go and listen those demons those spirits is not in your soul it's in your it's in it's not in your flesh it's in your flesh your spirit but never in your soul your soul has the holy spirit but he's a gentleman he's not going to make you do anything you got to let go and let god and guess what those who suffer in the flesh has ceased from sin y'all know what i'm saying it's like saying i'm not gonna eat any more ice cream and the day you say that somebody bring a big bowl by your house now you're gonna you're gonna forget you're gonna forget quickly if you haven't made a constitution with yourself that i'm not gonna eat no more ice cream because you know what the devil said if you don't receive this ice cream you're gonna hurt their feelings and then after you eat that ice cream you don't hurt your own feelings oh lord help us jesus i'm almost done people someone even laughed at me when i when the lord came here not long ago and gave me a vision i always wanted to see about binding that serpent i always wan wondered how to do how to i should step out like that and when that's what i've wanted all my life then i began to fast and pray said what would you do for that for and i said in there he said i was not sincere enough after he come then i wanted to purge myself not wait till you die let some priest try to purge you purge your soul but see they took it out of the uh authoritative word and put it over in the hands of some man-made dogma to bring money into the church or because they look at worldly things and worldly church gets power in the world political power but god looks to his word and any word that's contrary to god's word is wrong as far as i'm concerned it's the word or nothing yes sir yes sir he would he would go straight to the foundation he would tear the thing to pieces he would have to he would have to he couldn't do nothing else if amos was here today he couldn't do nothing else for remember he is the true prophet of god who the word come to he couldn't do nothing else but go back to the word no matter if all the pentecostals in the country gathered around him and said sir amos we believe you to be a prophet but you're off of the word we want to straighten you up he wouldn't he would stay with the word there is nothing else he could do because he's a prophet he didn't need their cooperation he got a message to give and all the father has given me will come to me and he's going to preach the word and he's going to preach it just like he would be it would be in the bible and therefore we turn to him now see no matter what it would be the word of god comes to the prophet their interpretation of the word the right interpretation and i said all of that to say brother branham's and what god gave him as an interpretation of the word is absolutely right but you got to understand that interpretation comes out revelation because remember he was preaching even to branham tabernacle and one time i think billy paul asked him you know how many you think you got got it all brother branham said to ben and paul only a few out of all that preaching only a few got it only if you understood what he was saying and that's just the way it is everybody might see the pill of fire but everybody don't see the voice hear the voice that's a known fact when paul fell down and those people was with paul they they saw the pill of fire they heard the thunder but they didn't understand what was being said and that's the thing with the message a lot of people read it but they don't understand it if you miss that the message is to restore us back to the position from which we fail it's not at your death it's now god restored brother branham here before he died you understand what i'm saying he was restored here he had a hot temper remember he lied he was going to fight that man over that tree he was going to shoot those boys he was a man he had flaws and flaws and all that but when it came to the word that was god speaking and i said all of that to say to you you might have plenty of flaws but it does not declare is not a way of declaring to you that you're not bribed you understand what i'm saying because your flaws is not what god is looking at somebody help me here i mean the wedding supper was what when you came to the wedding they put you on a road that road was the holy ghost and brother bam said that road was put on everybody regardless to what they were wearing so that when they came in they all look alike but it didn't change what was underneath that that's where the raptor comes in god would change this by body he would move the corruption and make it incorruptible that's god in you and then he would cause us to what change in a way of dimensional change the glory of god father i would that the glory that i have with you be with them right and you and i must understand the glory of god is not because you got this face that's shining like the light the glory of god is that that light is shining through you people can see the light don't hide it under a bushel he said but put it up on a pinnacle somewhere that people can see it this is not pentecost it's beyond that it's where god restores us and little if we go walking with him little by this is what we don't know how long he not walk with god but the bible said he walked with god it was found not and brother branham said the bride is a type of enoch and never in the word did you find one fault against enoch because his life was hidden god the bride of jesus christ stands spotless those of us who receive the holy ghost and moving into that perfect yeah that perfect that perfection that's god like being said he ain't beating this baby you love the lord let's stand i made it 8 59. god is so good to us i i i i'm zealous for him i'm zealous the thing that i want most more than anything now while god is working on me i want to be able to tell somebody about what he's doing i don't know a man yet who died and died without flaws because our perfectionist is not within us of ourselves is the perfection of christ our lives are what hid in christ jesus i don't understand it all but i believe it all and i believe with all my heart that god wants a a bride that's happy i've never seen a bride getting ready to be married or whatever the case may be and she's got a long face and she's so unhappy you know even when my wife and i was getting ready to get married we're getting ready to celebrate our 45th or 46th anniversary i forgot which it is in july the first part of july but i could remember the time when those there were some girls who posed as friends and said they would be her what they call them flower girls maids or whatever they call them i'm thinking about a funeral landing bribe me but you know there were some girls who quit and they thought they were going to interrupt the wedding because they were jealous of her several of those girls they told people that they that i was their husband i'm like you knew something i didn't know but the point is it didn't disturb nothing because god already had somebody there waiting and the wedding went well i think we had about 12 people 12 bribe me or whatever big wedding you know what my wife all we had to do was pay for the cake all the pictures was paid for the church gave us a wedding we went to the woods and got all our flowers in south carolina you get all kind of weeds and flowers and you decorate it put it together it'd be looking good and so my wife had like a we didn't know nothing about this message but she had like a rainbow color of gowns everybody had on a different color gown not even knowing and what what made it so so so wonderful we we were married in 1977 so do the math so it'd be 45 years i think but in the in in the beauty of all of this we have come through rough times we've had our glorious times we've you know you have your ups and downs but my love has never changed for my wife sometimes it gets a little more difficult because of the pressure and the things that we go through uh but listen immediately i give my life for my wife and my children because i know that god gave them to me and gave me her y'all don't have no idea and i don't think my wife had an idea either when she married me but she had she mad of all the problems and so that's why i love her so much because she stayed with me she stayed with me through thick and thin and that's the way god wants to see us she he wants to see us stay through sticky thick and thin no matter what we go through we've committed ourselves to him and that's what a marriage is it's a commitment lord i love you to death do us part and so i say these things people i know i'm i'm preaching a little different from the way i used to preach because i i see i see something and i see god bringing us to a maturity by the word and we won't have to worry in a little bit about the gifts and all of the things that comes with the word because as soon as we come into that place god is going to anoint us but it's it's it's individuals it's individuals you can't you can where the church is dead well what part of it are you if it's dead bring it to life you'll be the live one i love god in the morning when i write in the morning when i ride in the morning when i rise give me jesus give me jesus [Music] give me jesus [Music] you can't have all of this world just give me jesus in the morning amen oh in the morning when i run oh in
