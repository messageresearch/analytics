father lord chapel sinister lord we come to you father god as humbly as we know lord with all our burdens you continue to be with us jesus christ we pray our father lord you speak to your people lord

words that i will read with father god lord and everything that will be said oh god lord as i always pray o father lord help me to be so sensitive to the holy spirit lord i can go wherever father god he leads me to take the first place lord jesus christ amen amen amen let's uh open our bibles in the book of psalms we read the chapter 55 of psalms we read from verse 1 to verse 7. then we'll jump to the 22nd verse psalms 55 verse 1 to verse 7 and then verse 22. amen the bible says give ear to my prayer o god and hide not thy self for my supplications [Music] attend unto me and hear me i i i mourn i am i mourn in my complain and make a noise because of the voice of the enemy because of the oppression of the wicked for they cast iniquity upon me and in rough they hate me my heart is sore pain within me and the terrors of death are fallen upon me fearfulness and trembling are come upon me and hope and horror has overwhelmed me and i said oh that i oh that i had wings like a dove for then would i fly away and be at rest then i would then without wandering far off and remain in the wilderness verse 22 the bible says cast that burden upon the lord and he shall sustain thee he shall never suffer the righteousness to be moved subtitle i have it uh enforce the lord of god amen i had two subjects so i didn't know which one to choose from amen so here we see in verse 55 david he's resting his case you know before god's praises you know he's saying that give here to my prayer oh god and hide not thyself from my of my supplication amen because he found himself he was in trouble and he couldn't go anywhere else so the only place that he had to go was to god you know that's why he said i give here to my prayer amen if we go back uh uh to start my subject if we go back in uh uh genesis chapter 15 verse 1 to verse 6 genesis chapter 15 verse so here you'll find that abraham was splitting his case before god you know because he found himself you know getting older after these things the word of the lord came unto abraham it came unto abraham in a vision saying fear not abraham i am that shield and i exceeding great reward and abram said lord god what will thou give me seeing i go childless and the steward of my house is this illegal of damascus amen that was his play that was his that was you know he was pleading his case before god you know saying that lord you have promised me all those promises don't say nature lord you gave me all those promises lord here i am lord you blessed me lord here i am i'm gay i'm i'm going childless you know soon i will die is you know he's the one that i have the one that i trust right now but lord i'm going i'm going away without the sun so now verse three the bible says that and abraham said behold to me behold to me thou has given no seed and little one born in my house is mine in my hair so now here verse 3 abraham is trying to give alternative to god you know saying that you know whoever will be born in my house you know he will be he is the one who will take control of everything so now here's the response of the lord and behold the word of the word of the lord came unto him saying you know this shall not be done here that you're trying to give me will not work you know it's not what i have in my thoughts you know what i have in my thought that you have to have your own eyes you know you have to have you know someone has to come out of your you know that he is the one who will take care we take care of everything and he brought and he brought him forth abroad and said and he said unto him so shall thy seed be [Music] you know lord i have confidence in him he's the one who will take care of or take care of everything after me lord whoever will be born in my house is the one who will do everything you know god knew exactly what abraham was what was you know god knew exactly what what was the answer the answer that abraham was expecting to hear from god jesus so therefore before god pronounced that word of the pronounce to prepare the land you know he had to prepare the heart of abraham you know he had to take away the stony heart you know he had to take away all the day out inside of abraham you know in order that when god will speak the word you know abraham we have nothing else but to believe that word you know because i think it was 75 or 80 years old at that time you know but when abraham will hear that word [Music] so that's why you know in verse six the bible said that abraham believed in the lord abraham and he counted him he counted he counted it to him for righteousness [Music] amen he believed in the lord you confirmed that was counted so now if we if we keep on going verse seven she will continue he said that now abraham and now now he said unto him i am the lord that brought thee out of er to give the this land to inherit it and he said lord god whereabouts shall i know that that i shall inherit it you know now god is giving abraham the sign you see and he said unto him take me and here for of three years old and the she goes of three years old and the realm of three years old um and it traded off and a young pigeon in jean colombo and he took unto him all these and divided them in the midst and laid each piece a one against one against another amish lord so now god is giving god gave him the sign that he was looking forward to this so now if you look at it closely you look closely to verse 9. you see that god asks abraham to take five five animals you know those animals because he had uh he had a heifer is his animal genius the she goat devin chevro he had a ram unbelievable it turtledove and then a pigeon in colombo you know five clean animals it sank animal and all of those animals were three were three or three years of age you know typifying christ you know five is the number of grace you know three years old remember you know from the baptism of jesus christ to his death was 3 years amen and then god tell them to abraham to divide those animals into a dread you know that was the type of the cross you know now he is giving us his grace he may not in the contract you know dividing himself you know god took the body and gave us the spirit you know so that that spirit being in us you know we can go straight to god and plead our case at calvary you know we can go you know but you can go straight to god director he rendered the curtains enough [Music] you know to give you an open interest instrument to the holies of holy [Music] [Music] you know it opened that line that line that was closed between men and men and god so that now men can have a personal relationship with their creators [Music] whenever they need god don't shut oh whenever they need help check zombies one day man they can go to their clothes they close donation and close their doors family pot and stop praying and god will hear them why because you wanted that relationship to be restored that's why when he was promising abraham a son you know he had to give him that you know he had to give him that sign you know to say that abraham the son that i'm promising you know he's a type of a promised son that is christ [Music] you know who will come he will bring joy to the world you know he will set the capture free eva he was wounded blissey he was bruised he was smart so that you can go and plead your case [Music] the prophet said that by being wounded the prophet so from calvary's cross where the bruising [Music] like a bunch of walls upon him come on um he made he made his gift from calvary and he landed in heaven's doors remember [Music] they are free it's unbelievable sickness can be healed now sinners can be saved the captive can be free can be set free why because he accepted to suffer that pain you know he accepted to go through all of their you know you know for you to be for you to be free you know so that you can go to him and plead your case because when you read the psalms you know most of the time when you read the psalms they could follow you know those are david's prayers you know david's song is only shown to them you know simplifications you know prayer is asking god for deliverance you know asking god for support you know asking god for strength you know whenever david was in need you know you know he had to go to god for forgiveness you know when the enemies were there and wanted to kill him you know he had to go before god you know he had to go before god for refuge amen and that is the that is the example that the christians should example whenever you need help go to him you know he has an open ears he just want to hear you know a man he has a he has a secure line that is set only for you you know so that whenever you need him you know just call happily you know like daniel daniel you know when he started to pray before even opening his mouth you know god already sent angels to come and answer his prayers that's the same thing that happens see like [Music] amen here's paul he's saying that therefore being justified by faith our lord jesus christ by whom also we have access by faith into his great into this grace wherein we stand amen foreign knowing that tribulation work is patience and patience experience perseverance and experience and hope mick is not ashamed of the experience because the love of god is shed abroad in our hearts but the whole is by the holy ghost which he has given unto us now that's my favorite verse of this chapter amen man will one die yet pure adventure for a good man some would even dare to die but god commendeth his love toward us in that while you know christ already you know could cleanse you with his blood [Music] you know when the devil says that you can't be saved you know when he says that you can't receive the holy spirit you know you just have to repeat these words you know yet before i was a sinner a function a man christ died for me kissed him upon him before i was even born avocation the man he died for me so i don't care what you want to tell me man i don't care whatever you want to say i don't care what evidence you trying to bring before god very important if you don't you know saying that or i have evidence of him sinning if he doesn't man i have the text that he was testing to someone you know texting about gossiping [Music] you know when all of those complaints comes before god you know god will look at the devil and say you know i declare him not guilty you know and that not it won't even stop by saying not guilty amen god purchase your god purchase you by his blood amen the crimson blood of cry of christ cleanse you from all your sins but you just have to accept it man you just have to go and rest your case of calvary so here paul is talking about justification you know you will see that justification you know it's it's it's as if you didn't do it in the first place you know why it's because uh there is a i heard a brother was saying one one time that there's a country you know bach i think in you know uh uh like in the 60s or a long long time ago you know before i was born of october 20. amen he says that you know in that country it also be when somebody do you know when someone does something wrong those crooked confidence you know they use the word to justify it they had to justify him you know in other words that they had to kill that person person you know and killing that person onto your sister's son you know that means that everything that he did before him made everything that he did when he was alive it's all gone a party but if that person you know comes up you know it never happened the person you know resurrect [Music] you know but if that person you know something happened that that person yeah that person you know is is resurrected you know that person will come back as a new person because everything wrong that he did died with him amen in other words that person is now justified amen that's the same thing that christ did for us amen the bible plainly say that the soul does sinners that so that will perish you know he took our place and he died for us you know and then in other words that you know we are now that's why we are now justified because everything that we did for every and everything that we're going to do you know he died for us you know he was punished for it and then and then that's why that's the thing that is making us being justified you know as if we never done it we've never done it in the first place amen because christ took out the christ took our punishment he took it with him on the cross has nothing to do with us no it's just a resting place that we go for a while but we go where we know that one day you know when that trumpet will sound competitive amen all the amen and those who will still be alive amen there will be quicken there will be change in the twinkling of an eye on including amen because christ took our place you know raise your shoulders and and go tell the devil that i'm free and whatever he will try to tell you you know but that doesn't mean that you don't have to come to god and ask for forgiveness amen as a christian we have to go before god every day and ask for forgiveness amen the prophet says the prophet now listen then the the list of the believers of his believers i took this quote from brother brooks because he read it on wednesday night now listen the list of his believers no matter how long or little or whatever you are people christ is the head of the body is that right well wherever the head is the body is with it where my head goes it takes my body with it and where jesus is the church is with him amen he don't get out of his word the head wherever the head is that's where the body will be amen if the head is a victorious if the head is victorious that means that their hand is also victorious jesus christ overcame everything jesus christ that's something the core you just have to have faith amen to enforce the law of god you know to the devil and tell him exactly what god promised you exactly there's three type of people or three kinds of faith you know there is people who don't believe yeah you know even though something is clear they just don't believe me you know they don't want to believe in the verb you know the second group of people is is those people where the intellect you know knows that god is real you know in their head they know that this miracle that just happened is real and then they're trying their best to believe amen they're trying their best to believe the promise of god the promise those are the group the third group that's where the group that every every promise of god always comes to pass see uh amen because he's not trying to force himself to believe those promises amen he's not trying to force to agree with those promises or he's not trying to sympathize with those promises but those promises has been revealed to him and the faith of god has been revealed to him amen that's what when they hear those promises without asking no questions you know that's why you have you see abraham you know when god gave him the promise of a son you know that was a revelation to abraham he believed that promise yeah but you say but where isaac but what do you mean the brother faith is a promise i mean faith is a revelation you know everybody who came before moses you know those people didn't have the bible to read moses is the one who wrote the bible the first the first book of the bible you know tell me where those people were getting you know that wisdom to have faith in god where was there getting you know that you know that faith you know it wasn't because the word or the promise of god was pleasing to their ears you know it was because those promises and those words were revealed to them you know you have for example for example amen out of the out of the the garden of eden the god that faith to offer to offer a lamb for for sacrifices you know that's why sometimes we just don't have to force ourselves to believe something amen you can do you know you you have the promise of god god said that you know you uh but uh he was bruised for us he was bruised and and beaten so that we can be healed all of them they read the same the same text but you see one is healed and the other one is you know both of them will say amen amen but you see one is here then the other one is amen because sympathizing with the word you but inside of you that's not change it's not changing your spirit can create those emotions and atmospheres but as long as that revelation is not into your soul nothing will happen so our prayers to god will be that lord give me that revelation of the face i don't know so that whenever you know the work has to be manifested reserved manifest amen because when abraham believed it he had two testimonies one testimony from god loving all the jews and the other testimony from the men from people amen james wrote the testimony of abraham according to people and paul wrote the testimony of abraham according to god you know in other words james wrote the testimony his work that was the the work of his faith that was the thing that justified him and then and then paul said you know paul said what was it was the faith that god gave him amen in other words that james saw what man was saying for you [Music] you know we will not be able to open your soul and then see the faith but the only way that we can see the faith that you proclaim to say you proclaim to say that you have me seeing the works amen in other words that works is the weakness of faith works give weakness of faith of the faith that you have inside amen that's why abraham when he believed god he started walking dr abraham get get get i want to lead you to a land you know abraham didn't know the land abraham never heard the voice of god before that voice of god just quickened his soul i said what did you have something amen quickened the first that was slipping inside of him and you gave him strength to start walking caught in the fossils you know gave him strength to start walking you know in other words abraham was raising up his hand and said lord wherever you want to lead me lord lead me i will follow you abraham amen that's what you know god didn't tell abraham where he was going you know god was teaching abraham how to trust him come on you know sometimes we read things in the bible that we don't understand uh the fundamental you know you get the half of the of the verse and the other half you don't get it you know whatever you got two scoops of it you know have faith either start walking amen go to him in prayer i live amen and and then he is our healer amen you read that word you just get the part that that by the bible said that he is a healer you know god never taught abraham when he was going to give him a sign of son [Music] you know he saw a vision of joseph you know he saw a vision of god giving me a son and he called his name joseph joseph when his wife was pregnant you know everybody thought that you know this is joseph coming today but his wife gave birth to her girls to sarah he is a farmer you know many people say that you know he is a false prophet you know there's even one brother who called the prophet and started laughing then god punished our brother and that brother died amen the thing that people didn't understand is that when god showed that vision to him god never told them when their son was coming [Music] god told him that you will have a son julian and he named him joseph jose you know god never told him that that son will come after 10 other child 10 other children will come after five years the doctor said that your wife cannot conceive anymore you know because if she tries again she would die the prophet was telling them that you know that that's not your that's not your problem you know god gave me a vision of another son you know if people were laughing at him you know saying that he saw a josephine he's only like you know he saw a girl instead of a sort of a of a boy you know he knew what he saw you know when the devil was trying to create obstacles [Music] saying that his wife was not going to conceive anymore you know the prophet had to to enforce the law of god you know he said telling them that this is what god told me what will happen amen there is no negotiation you know this is what it is and this is what will be all the successful say you know they say that you know there is no water up in the upper ball no one knew what they heard nowhere no one knew what is so good so he didn't matter if the journal oh if the the news were saying that he was a false prophet or he was a false teacher a man he knew exactly what he saw you know even though he was the only one seeing that vision let's see let's all those children of israel israel they knew the promise of god isabella promises that i will be with you and i will deliver you today amen they knew the promise of god they knew the promise that god gave to joshua couldn't heal upon you that wherever your footstep will be you will have that blend in position you know all of them knew those words you know all of them in their prayers they were repeating those words but god revealed that word to david only reflected amen so that when david saw goliath david wasn't going by you know a word or a scripture that he knew intellectually amen david was not going but with the scripture that he learned in his son's school amen but david was going amen and then we know the results amen because david to him was revealed the word of the lord that's why it doesn't matter how many scriptures that you know amen it doesn't matter how many quotes that you know commented hey man it doesn't matter how many but how many bible uh how many uh uh tape that you hear every day it's good but as long as those tips are not revealed to you amen you're just feeding your intellectuals you know but you have to pray god create that lord every time i hear your words no let that knew exactly that going to church only will not save me knew exactly that giving giving my tithes will not save me [Music] you know giving my offerings will not save me or singing will not save me or making sacrifice to get a church will not save me you know even though all these things are good you know but he knew one thing we would save him amen was the revelation and kane all of them offered the sacrifice amen all of them took their time they do have you know to prepare an offering for god and that was the sacrifice that was the offering that god was looking at amen that's what when we come to church you know we have to come by revelations sunday morning when you wake up oh every wednesday when you come to church you have to come about revelation amen you have to pray god lord reveal me give me the revelation of yours [Music] circumstance that i'm going through that when i will hear those words amen i will have the faith to overcome it amen david he had to enforce the law of god he came and he saw all the wives that was they that were left in the city were gone had to go claim those servants amen and when david went to claim those everybody that belonged to him amen he didn't go to negotiate with the with the with those philistines he didn't go to negotiate with those enemies but he went to take the everything that belonged to him and then he went with the promise i'm going to take them back you take the promise of god amen you take the law of god the law of god and then you go enforce into him [Music] and you present the word to him and say that here's the word now i need everything that belongs to me i need them back only you know i don't need a conversation with you but i am taking everything amen because they belong to him they are my property amen god gave them to me so therefore i have the rights to take them back to you amen if the devil took your privilege to become a son of god amen amen god promised those to me amen when he was dying on the cross he said that it is finished when he said it is finished that means that everything is finished amen everything that i will need fight because christ will overcome over all of those battles and then you're asking you for one thing only if the modern church accept him accept the victory and it's course you see you've been suffering for a long time accept the victory it is yours you've been praying for a long time accept the victory it is yours amen accept the answers it is yours god provided himself a sacrifice amen so that you can go and walk in victory amen accept the victory it is yours like abraham you know he told the servant i'm going up and i will return me and the son will we come back as long as those words came out of his mouth may allah and then he [Music] [Music] is it so simple women have faith in god and speak the word now the prophet said that so faith so is faith so it is faith that doesn't produce worth the prophetic anyone has the right to doubt your testimony if your faith doesn't produce works see voter foreign [Music] you can't make anyone believe that you are healed say well i don't know see why yeah sure i got all the faith in the world but you you don't have because if you are or if you got faith then works is merit to faith husband and wife one identifies the other with the other one amen they're all ghosts they they go together amen when you say you have faith we have to see that it works but if your faith doesn't have words the thing that he had to do you know when he gave that prophecy of a virgin that would conceive of revelation maybe himself didn't understand what he said is one question but tell me how is this going to happen amen the angel gave him the answer to that now mary this is mary and mary's answer said lord let it be [Music] amen when i was driving i was with this paul brothers [Music] oh i had to pay because i didn't pay my tuition for that semester one semester hey man i try to work out the payment plan with them repayment they say that well since we gave you the first payment plan but you didn't you didn't respect this is not even you know what i get like my monthly payments that's your monthly you know my monthly salary you know even though it was i had other bills to pay mcc but how am i gonna have the money that's six thousand dollars in two weeks amen by god's grace i didn't complain amen by god's grace i didn't doubt well i just said them okay that's fine i paid in two weeks okay how was i going to do it i didn't know come on amen the first week came the first week passed la promeras i still have i still didn't have anything hey man i was thinking because i i had i had you know ideas how i was going to do it but everything didn't work out so everything i was trying to do to fair didn't work so i only had one place to go on the man he wants to go to god and pray to god i said lord i only have one week left and i have to pay this extra peace and lord you know it very well that it's impossible for me to do it in one week it's enough to see christie you know even though i decided to not spend my money it was still not working but nevertheless i didn't deal with it but ask me how much you know i had to get out of my pocket to pay the money amen god is my witness i only i want to spend a thousand that one thousand dollars to pay that thing i know you did this before the secretary man you created the way when i needed you amen and i believe that you still the same god amen and god god provided the way amen amen only have faith in god no matter how impossible the situation looks great amen you have few hours to resolve the situation [Music] don't think about tomorrow you know as i feed the little bird [Music] i will take care of you so what are you afraid of why are you complaining amen just take the word of god when you're about to hold your dreams and good on him i'll leave you already and say lord this is your promises lord you did this with me before but this is tough and i believe that you will feel the same god and you will do this again now the devil will start to bring thought inside of you you know the devil will start bringing you know all kinds of stuff with you amen you're going through this because you did this god is not hearing your prayer because you're sinned in your prayer because you did this and then all 13 verse 18 to 23. amen the bible says that hear ye therefore the parable of the sword when anyone hears the word of the kingdom this is the is giving now the interpreter is now interpreting the the the parable he gave in the first first verse when anyone hears the word of god of the kingdom and understandeth it not lost then cometh the wicked one and catches the way that which was sung in his heart this is he which received seed by the way the same is he that hears the word and ending with joe receive it which received earth for a while is monkey persistence for when tribulation or persecution rises because of the word and why he is offended he also now received the seed among the thorns is he that hears the word and the care of this world and the deceitfulness of riches shocked the word so now the question is you know you know how are you going to have that good ground in natural when somebody want to you know uh uh sow seed it just doesn't come it just it does doesn't go doesn't go and then start you know taking corns and and just um throwing seeds wherever you need to put water to water the land and do whatever you know those uh uh for farmers do they do it in order in order to prepare that land to receive whatever seed that will be thrown amen and this is god's job to do i felt amen before he gives us his promise amen he knows exactly our response to the promise amen he knew it before the foundation of the world those promises will land in the good seed in the good ground and those promises will bring forth fruit and he is the one who does the work amen if you if you need more more proof you can we can go to ezekiel chapter 36. it's god who does the work he is the one who does the the work on the ground therefore ezekiel says in verse 36-37 i mean chapter 36 verse 26 27. amen in other words ezekiel is giving this the this parable of jesus but now he is explaining to people how god will take somebody from you know would take a ground that's that had stones and thorns so that when the promise of god will it will hit that ground because the point is we'll bring forth first verse 26 the bible says [Music] and i will take away the stony heart out of your flesh amen in other words that you know those i think the three the first three cases that jesus was talking in in chapter 13 of matthew everything that will try to uh uh uh that would try to choke the word when the word will land in ivan and he will put in verse 27 say that and i will put my spirit within you in other words it's not your work it's not you working those judgments or it's not you working hard to keep those judgments amen it's the grace of god that god gives to anyone amen he gives you the promise and it gives you the grace that contact us to have faith the voila foreign amen he gives you the promise of zakat that promised amen and then he prepares the land amen so that when those promises will come the preparation that he did the preparation would cause you to work to walk in the statue don't say lord to keep the judge and to keep his judgment it observation them this is all amen so amen it's good to stay under the good atmosphere but your prayer will be your prayer shall be but lord just prepare that land inside of you amen lord just take away the stone of your heart and god give me the heart of flesh he said no i call the muslims amen will cause me to do your judgment to work in your statutes i mean to keep your judgment secure amen it's the heart of flesh that god will give you amen it's the revelation that god will give you the revelation of faith that god will give you that [Music] so she didn't matter if people were keeping her from going from going to god in a particular situation you know she didn't matter if people were keeping her from touching amen she jesus care about touching jesus face oh touching jesus hands to shield the mountain but she had a face that was so strong unfortunately that's the lord even the helm of your garments amen just amen if you're not trying if you can't touch his face amen if you can't see his face super powerful because everybody's going to him you just have a promise of god who is sympathetic to your goal say lord even the hand of your government is it to your memory lord even your share the lord lord even though as long as i'm under your shadow amen you just have to have faith amen faith [Music] amen this was talking about his healing you know of of of of of seeing the seventh dove so now here we understand one thing i discovered when i was listening to this message uh on the winds of the snow white now when the prophet was giving the testimony of being healed technically it wasn't healed when he was giving that program when he was giving that testimony he saw the vision but he wasn't healed yet but he saw the vision so sure that he knew that his healing will be welcomed soon amen so that's why he was standing and giving the testimony amen because you know that that seventh that was coming with his with with uh uh uh he's he's healing so that's why he created me that's why he stood before people i told them about the and testify we started to testify about his healing yeah man and then the promise will be and then that he will have his healing amen and then and the prophet says where did the dove come from up there in the wilderness i'll say this god said abraham needed a ring for his son he is jehovah the lord can provide for himself the sacrifice you think of it the same god remember but the same inspiration by the same kind of people in colombo to give you faith in your heart you believe that you're going to be here amen have their faith amen pray god the spirit of the holy ghost please do something please give me forgive give me faith in my heart to believe that i'm going to be here it meant to believe that i will have research for my questions a man to believe that i will have a result for any equation that i have a man to believe that every need that i have will be provided amen you pray for that revelation you don't have to force yourself to agree with it amen no matter how good the word sounds no matter how that word brings emotion to your spirit amen as long as there there is no faith we see i'm talking about the following amen it doesn't matter whatever the spirit will feel like very important come on these people yeah it doesn't matter however your body will feel like come on that would do nothing but pray god's i said lord even though my spirit is not feeling like i'm healed memphis is clean and somewhat concentrated man oh even though my body is not feeling like i have the answer the only thing that matters is inside there in that chorus salter amen it's like a dove in colombo amen nowhere nowhere you will see a dove taking a shower nowhere because jamaica has an oil inside of him amen [Music] see and they will give a testimony amen like james did with with abraham come zach if you're only zoned because they're in the inside god is filled with faith amen your [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] victory [Music] hours and only your your only hope is in the saying is in god and then you have the word of god every promise in the book is yours he died for you amen amen he shared his blood for you even so that you can have your cleansing you could physically send the holy spirit for you you don't quite listen to this amen every promise there sing the song and every promise in the book comments amen and every promise in the book is mine [Music] every chapter is [Music] [Applause] [Music] is [Music] in the book [Music] every verse and every [Music] is [Music] [Music] every verse and every

brother troy he has an announcement after his announcement he can close in a word of prayer amen amen god bless everyone it's good to be here amen i enjoy what our brothers ministered on and uh i rest my case at calvary amen i can tell you the truth that i have made that a practice in my life amen as my brother testifies he asks well amen every single one of us who claims to be a part of the bride of christ to have a position in the body of christ all of us have a responsibility to to to wrest our case at calvary amen to examine our lives and when you see things that you know like you can improve because we have a responsibility over our bodies over our over our souls over our families over our positions amen so that every part of our life would bring honor and glory to the body of the lord jesus christ it's our responsibility as a part of the body of christ amen and i just wanted to announce you know last year i began praying in a specific direction for my life and uh asking the lord to change some things amen is looking at uh things that are going on in my life and busyness and some chaos that entered in just ask the lord to come in and make a change amen and as i began to pray that way some things began to move just as our brother says when you when you lay your case at calvary heaven begins to move on your behalf amen as i begin to pray now as i look back through time over the last year i can see that things began to move and so i want to announce that uh i have accepted a job out of state um state of michigan we will be leaving the church here probably sometime around the first of the year it's a not an easy decision to make been here for probably 18 years or so since the church started since brother keith invited me to the bible studies we've enjoyed our time here brother isaiah has been my pastor since 2007. uh it's not a decision i take lightly my love for brother isaiah has no bounds god gave him to me as a pastor i've enjoyed every moment of it and uh respect him and this church is a place that god has chosen here in this area to hold up the banner of jesus christ you know and as i see the you know wondering as i see myself moving on from this place it does bring me a lot of joy to see our brothers that have risen up musicians ministers song leaders years ago i would have wondered you know well i felt it felt like i was abandoning the church but now i see that god has risen up all these young men to take these these different roles and places and i know the church is in a good place amen so i just i just wanted to uh make this announcement as didn't want anybody to be left out amen my wife and i our family were in the process of buying a house there in michigan we're working on getting rid of our house here in iowa we'll probably making a lot of trips back and forth you'll probably see less and less of us as we try to spend part of our time there and part of our time here but we'll definitely be here through through january so i love every single one in here every single person in this place i love and enjoy i've enjoyed our fellowship and i just want to thank god for every single one of you not one person here that i have anything against any any oughts any any funny feelings i love every single one as a member of the body of christ and i just wanted to say carry on support our great pastor that god has given us and uh it's not a goodbye it's just a looking forward to see what god has amen as i've said you can see god's hand in it all i've seen some supernatural signs and a little bit of leadings here and there as you know how god does and i'm just looking forward to see what god does we'll be attending that church where the camp meetings just took place there in michigan and they right at this moment don't have a pastor so we'll definitely be keeping that keep that in your prayers and god will give them a pastor after god's own heart i know i'll be praying that direction as well so
