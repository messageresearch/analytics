TRANSCRIPT
========================================
after their daddy Ahab and when I say Ahab I mean you know Ahab had a lineage and so this king would rise up and he would do right then after he would do right that he would die and then another king would come up and he would do wrong it was like they were like a a seesaw they were always up and down up and down up and down and they had terrible kings that led them into bail worship and all kind of idol worship and they they were the kind of sin that Israel were doing really should have never been named among them these these sins uh fleshly sins that were basically the things that heathens would do or the the Canaanites and all of the Hittites and all of these other things they were so influenced by these people and to be honest with you it all came through religion and that's why God did not want you know a Believer to marry a non believer because that that nonbeliever if he had he didn't believe in in the god of the believer he had the tendency of swaying them to to to believe their God we've seen that by the grace of God uh through Solomon Solomon married all those wives and at the end of the day Solomon was a idol worshipper we saw that with with uh Jezebel and a Ahab and and he followed with with Jezebel and he ended up idolatra so so what I'm trying to tell you is that when it comes to Faith you need to marry if you're going to marry someone fall in love with someone it need to be somebody that you are equally yolked with and believe the same thing y'all agree with that because otherwise you're going to have a battle on your hand an unnecessary battle and so I I'm saying these things because this is what brought the scene Jeremiah scene they had become so uh caught up with everybody else's religion and everybody else's way of doing things to they Lally forgot about God exactly what we're doing now right they come to church they they they did the things that they would do and then they would come back in go in the church as if they didn't do nothing they were clean you know and and that's not the way God wanted God hates that that's why I kind of brought in Revelations 3 where God talks about uh uh Le theia you L you lukewarm and and you not he hot nor cold you lukewarm and he said that kind of a condition he said makes me sick to my stomach and I'll spew you out of my mouth those of you who have read the first chapter is uh is there any questions we're not done there yet but is there any questions is there anything you would like to say okay we'll move on now we we realize that God God told Jeremiah now listen it's going to it's a tough time and I want you to understand that U it's not going to be easy now did not God say in all day I'm trying to pull everything together because if you you you really enjoy Jeremiah when you see that Jeremiah is basically talking about our day everything almost everything and and you see even the behavior of preachers right there in Jeremiah and it it amazes me because God is the same yesterday today and forever always remember that if God judge Israel for a certain thing he will judge you for the same thing he's not going to let you just do whatever you want to do and call it Grace God is a just God and like I said Grace is given unto us only to do what is right he gives us that space and time to make things right that's what Grace is Grace is not okay I'm under grace so I'm going to sin sin sin sin sin no that's disgrace Grace is the opportunity that God gives us to make that thing which is wrong right let's read the 17th verse please he said thou therefore girdle up thy Lo and arise and speak unto them all that I command thee be not dismayed at their faces lest I confound thee before them now is that what we feel when it comes to witnessing most of us are afraid to tell the truth to people to their face because we are afraid of their faces and God say don't be afraid of their faces let me tell you something and this is something that was given to me just the other day we ought to have the opportunity when we have the opportunity to witness we ought to witness readily and speedily as if the man was drowning and he's about to die because really in reality you don't know when his next breath is going to be taken from him and a lot of time we say oh I'll wait till the next time well he might not have a next time to tell him about Jesus but the thing that that is we're afraid of we don't we don't want people to hate us we don't want people to dislike us we want people to just like us and and and appreciate our religion that's not a true that's not what Christianity is about We Are Soldiers we're warriors with the lights of the world is our responsibility even as it was Jeremiah's responsibility to tell the truth no matter how much it hurts for behold I have made thee this day listen what he tells you don't listen people if God has built a wall of fire about you you don't have to worry about the enemy he can do all the Talking he want to he can do all the listen there was a sister and I know her she just went on to be with with the Lord she loved the Lord so much but her husband would beat her but she kept praying for him she kept uhh praying for him and believing God and she kept on loving him and one day he went to hit her and he had a stroke and he was in a wheelchair till he died now she had to push him around you understand me God knows how to turn the tides but we've got to learn to understand that there is no weapon formed against us that will prosper none that's truth that is truth now God didn't tell you that you'll never get slapped but he said listen he'll give you the ability to turn the cheek and listen I know this sound crazy but the the Bible says touch not my anointed that's mean all of us that's not for just a preacher or a prophet or some teacher or something that's all and do my prophets no no harm when he says touch not my anointing I mean us then he sings it down to a prophet and do my Prophet no harm right because God is the one that is on our on our side remember uh I was just listening to the uh a message look looking at unto unto the Unseen and brother Ram is telling the story about how the rifle blew up and the devil tried to kill him and he said uh the one doctor said he's it's a miracle because God had to been standing near because there was enough power in that explosion that would have taken his head off and you know brother M makes the statement he says well the devil tried to kill me but he can't do it till my time is up yall understand what that means no doubt they wanted to kill Jeremiah they did a lot of things to him they I don't want to get ahead of myself because you know I can I can do that I'm trying to stay just kind of line by line so it'll build up by the grace of God but they they wanted to kill him but God had already told him behold I've made thee this day a defense City and an iron pillar and Brazen walls against the whole land against the kings of Judah against the princes thereof against the priest thereof and against the people of the land and they shall fight against thee but they shall not Prevail against thee for I am with thee said the Lord to deliver Thee the battle is on on we can't we can't stop the battle the battle is on all right so so so let me let me um let me go here to uh excuse me there's something I wanted to read quickly but when it comes to uh uh let let's go to the scriptures here let's start let's just I know I'm jumping around but let's start at the 13th verse and kind of go down again again the word of the Lord came un me asking what do you see and I replied I see a balling pot is lid lifted from the north to the south then the Lord said unto me disasters will be poured out from the north and on all who live in the land and now I'm reading for another from a different version but it it's I read this because it's kind of it's clear he said indeed I am about to summons all the Clans and kingdoms of the north this is the Lord's de declaration they will come and each King will set up his throne at the entrance of Jerusalem gate they will attack all her surrounding walls and all the other cities of Judah I will pronounce my judgment against them for all the evil they did when they abandoned me to burn incense to other gods and to worship The Works of their own hand now I'm going to stop right there because some of us may not know what's happening in our country but remember when brother brandham said that the Demons of the ant luian day went into Hollywood and from Hollywood Hollywood has corrupted basically the whole world you know they used to hide who they worship now they are giving praise to Satan they're talking about how they are the sodomites and how they are you know uh Babylon and and they they they laughing like it's a joke because but they they saying in a boastful way now I'm saying in these things so that you can understand that what we see here in Iowa we have been really preserved I mean we see some things but we don't see all things and and and but this country as as well as other countries is rotting to the core and God has brought a judgment when brother Brandon brought the message indictment he was like he was just like jerem IA bringing the indictment to Jerusalem or Judah and and and you and I must understand no matter how long it takes it must happen the word of God cannot come back void I read this thing about the the pot because here's God saying I've got a boiling hot pot of water and I'm going to pour it all over Judah in other words I have brought judgment and she she's going to she's going to feel the Judgment that I have brought and that's what we don't see we we we it's almost like a parallel that that now judgment is coming because remember Elijah came to bring judgment he came to bring judgment right now we see okay he said that great and uh uh notable day but you and I must know amen that there are those who are are blessed in here and there's a there a group that is cursed and God has come to to fulfill the cursing of Elijah and you say what what do you mean when judgment struck the W West Coast that was God and Alaska almost sunk California had a terrible earthquake you know what I'm saying y'all remember that historically and we now right now amen a a again in the same situation but you have never ever seen in the history of man in our day you have never seen a nation fight God like this nation are y'all aware of that and when you challenge God God will take the challenge this is why we've got to stand we've got to be the example because listen if there was somebody to repent in Jeremiah's day they would have repented and guess what I'm going read this I thought I thought I put it in my notes but I don't see it but I I'll say what happened a lot of things happen but the thing that God was really angry uh with is that they forgot to rest the land they didn't do the Sabbath and because they didn't do the Sabbath God said your punishment is 70 years in Babylon as slaves and you say well what do you mean brother Brooks I'm trying not to jump but I'll say it like this a lot of the enemies walk right through the Gates of Jerusalem walk walk right through the gates there was no there was no real defense cuz everybody was tied up into their own little business and God brought judgment he brought Kings into the gate now you say what do you mean what's happening to us our enemies are walking right into the gates call it the order whatever you want to call it but they come they have free access to this country and they're not coming here to do a picnic they are God's ordained people to bring judgment on us that's what it is you got them down there killing folks stealing taking their homes squatting in their yards and their houses and everything else and nothing can be done what is it God's judgment on America because what we what did we do we turn our back on God now we want a Revival you crossed the line already there's no more Revival in America every individual could have a Revival but not the whole nation we're done judgment we're hanging in the balance just like it was and guess what they still marking God like they marked Jeremiah they still mocking God they they mock you oh uh we believe in in William brownon we believe in the the messenger of the day we believe he was a liar Elijah you know they mock us but it doesn't matter because God has already set judgment on this nation and nothing can turn it back right I was telling the brother the other day I think it was Brother Rich and I were talking iot uh but anyway we were talking about all the things that that that that is taking place because brother bam talks about be prior to the Rapture the bride will receive an an anointing will receive an outpouring and um you know you see this ex coming through uh the country and everybody talking about Nineveh Nineveh but we remember Nineveh wasn't first destroyed Nineveh was going to be destroyed but Nineveh repented right but now we know that there is no repentance you know all we can do the bride the Bride of Jesus Christ is making herself ready and like say right at that cross that little thing is a Rapture now not meaning it's going to happen exactly on the eighth but brother brandom said it will set in motion A Spiritual Awakening for the bride and I'm looking for it because I realize by the grace of God something has to Shake us to make us realize we're at the last days no hiding place you can run wherever you want to run there's only one hiding place and that's in Christ Jesus if you reject that there's nothing left for you he said I will pronounce my judgment against them for all the evil that they did when they abandoned me to burn incense to other gods and to worship The Works of their own hands and that's exactly what we do we got football we got basketball we got all these Sports they worship worship their God they they they you know how can I say it it's so bad to to they don't care if you know that they're worshiping Lucifer and everything else yeah like I was telling somebody I said that's why you got to ask God to deliver you from television and all these other things because you are literally allowing yourselves to be entertained by serpent seed he says now get ready stand up and tell them everything that I command you do not imit intim do not be intimidated by them or I will cause you to to you to cower before them in other words don't don't don't don't let no no nobody intimidates you Jeremiah and we're so we're so so weak and I Pray by God's grace that when we finish this lesson that you'll understand that that this lesson is not talking about Jeremiah he's talking about you Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and we cannot allow ourselves Amen to be defeated now they did a lot of things to Jeremiah that you can find Christ in it they beat him they did all kinds of stuff they threw him in prison and then an Ethiopian man came and helped delivered him out of that prison like that the colored man that came and helped Jesus carry the cross even though Jeremiah didn't have to go to the Cross amen we know that God still had little symbolisms there throughout that showing that Jeremiah still walked a a part of of his own life and what we need to understand by the grace of God is that he is a present help in a time of need and I I can't stress that enough and I I I by God's grace today the 18th verse I am the one who have made you a fortified City an iron pillar a bronze wall against the whole land what is he saying I have made you undefeated you can't be defeated I've made you out of this material the Bride of Jesus Christ cannot be defeated because of the material that he has made us out of and I know just say well look at this thing it look like a time of history but if we take that scripture he's the same yesterday today and forever it no longer becomes history it becomes now is that right I mean even in Jesus day he when he was walking the path who fought him most his own people the one who betrayed him Judas from the tribe of Judah the same tribe Jesus came from I mean you know when you see this you got to understand and bring it down to your level your greatest enemy will be among you it ain't to be out there it's going to be among you and you've got to know who you are and where you came from and where you're going that's where your peace is right I have a peace God has given me a peace I'm not worried I'm not afraid I'm not nervous about nothing because God has given me a peace and that same peace I'm sure some of you already have those of you who don't ask God for that peace so you can't be worried this is not oh Lord I'm just don't know what's going to happen tomorrow yes we do but we must prepare ourselves for it right it's the truth you know I I'll say it like this a lot of places you know in in Iowa has these uh uh Sheltering places you can go when a tornado come and um some don't but those of you who have those kind of little shelters underneath or whatever basement you're not going to just stand at the top of your stairs because and you see the tornado coming you say oh well I'm going to be all right no you're going to go down to a place of safety and that's how it is now you see the storm coming find your place of safety right I know this is uh uh uh a little different but we know that uh he was surrounded by all enemies and I got in my notes it sounds like the borders of America being invaded by the surrounding countries and that's exactly right but we can't be afraid of anything perfect love cast out fear he said they will fight against you and you know I know I'm if you don't know I'm telling you now the Christian has be become the target we are the enemy now when this country was based upon Christianity now we we are the enemy uh of this country because this country has sold out to all kinds of idolatry you know socialism communism You Name It Whatever Pagan thing can go on in this country they they allow it and it's okay except there's no room for the Christian and that's what Jesus said if they did it in the green they do it in the dry so understand you and you're not the only place of safety is Jesus Christ and he's already given you words of confidence I knew you do you all believe that he knew us he know us and he knew us before the foundation of the world we're not something that just happened now we'll use that scripture yeah Lord you know we're preacher preaching oh yeah God knew me before the foundation of the world now you really know to you need to know that he knew you is there any questions any questions yes thank you uh not really a question I do have but just uh just you finish com verse five which says that before I formed the uh in the belly I knew you just like to say uh I was first of all I want to I want to thank you because I was reading Jeremiah it was just like a new book to me again you know a lot of things coming out and um just like you say looking at the state of the country right now reading the chapter five kind of um it kind of uh came came into my mind about what's going on even in the country nowadays um in the Supreme Court you know talking about with productive right you know a woman can do whatever they want attacking life you know but when I read this something pretty much told me God God knew me before that's election before even I was formed you know what I mean so and the country today is just pretty much going against the scripture saying that no you know we don't need God to legis legislate people to legislate anything you know what I mean and be playing you can be talk about the birth and everything yeah yes exactly and because it's pretty much taught now in schools to even our young sisters that it's your body you know you do whatever you want you know if you don't feel like you you have to give birth you can terminate life any any time so it's really crucial for us as Christians to know that life is precious because God ordains it before even you know it is formed so that's just something that came in my mind well and it's true brother and it's true the fact of the matter is in our country you'll have people who would want to kill you for standing for the word this particular scripture because they think that life they really don't think much about life because they murderers you know their father is a murderer so they can't help but to be murderous I mean you can you can kill a child all the way up to almost the ninth month and in some places even after they're born when they're born you know how they do they suck the brain out of them you know just really cruel stuff it's nothing but bail worship it's witchcraft behind all of that and and and they they bewitch young girls innocently and tell them it's okay but then when those girls do it they realize it's not okay but then it's too late you see but the truth of the matter is that what devil is trying to do is stop the Royal seed when you see him killing babies he's trying to stop the Royal seed that's scripture every time he he he tried to kill the babies and Egypt you know uh kill the babies in Bethlehem it was always the Royal seity he was behind because you see if he could stop that then we can't have a Rapture because God said I have never Lo lost one you see what I'm saying so God God knows how to hide his his own he knows how to maneuver things around regardless to what they do they of course they're going to have to give account for what they're doing we we we look we look the scriptures and we see well you know uh the Jews worshiped and Moab and and um excuse me uh uh MOA I can't think of the god the the the name the the Moab bites worship and they were they were they were um uh sacrific children and that's exactly what we're doing it's just a new form of what we doing it but it's still if you see those that do it uh in the because there are Cults and religious people in high places that literally sacrifice children that way and worse so we haven't we say uh intelligently we we've moved forward but we haven't we've gone backwards this nation is backsliding and it's worse than it's ever been and it's come to a place where God has to bring judgment upon it yeah yes brother as I understand it I mean we uh us as a bride it we're carrying on brother Brandon's Ministry yes even though you know we're the bride and we are carrying that on and brother Brandon's Ministry was the word amen that's all he was bringing out was the truth of the word amen and um so what I'm saying he Jeremiah was sent to quote unquote religious people yes they were still going through the forms yes but they just weren't they were not following God that's right so um what I'm trying to say is you're absolutely right that what I've experienced and I'm sure many here you get more opposition from people who know some of the word yes sir than you do that people who don't know anything about the world exactly right and so we are in the sense of Jeremiah yes sir you know yes sir that's what it seems like to mean to me too brother it really is it puts you you become the character of that day you know we put Jeremiah here but really we are what he was you know we are the ones who are now fighting against the wickedness of Israel spiritually right because we have fought fall we have backslidden so much and and if you can't put yourself in this book if you can't become the character of the book you see what I'm saying we can say oh we Rebecca you know we're Rachel we're this that and the other but you got to understand you all the others too I mean those characters that God has in his book is for you because you supposed to be the whole book and you supposed to be able to find yourself in this scripture if you was in the day of Jeremiah who would you be right if you can't honestly say I'll be Jeremiah then then that means you're on the other side of the fence I mean come on even in the days of Jesus who would you have been what are those disciples Jesus or Judas you understand what I'm saying you got to put yourself in the book because the book is about you it is about us and everything that J jiah had to stand against is what the Bride of Jesus Christ is standing against right now and who is our enemy who the people hates us those so-called Christians that's the truth they can't stand it because you can live it and they can't and there's always been a jealousy between the two right always but don't be afraid of their faces always tell them the truth no matter what because God Is Standing On Your Side remember jeremi made it through all of the others made it through now does it mean that they didn't suffer no they suffered if you're going to be a real Christian you're going to suffer but Jesus said if you don't suffer you don't rain and if you're going to suffer suffer for righteousness sake not because you stealing or smoking or drinking or something like that suffer for the righteousness of God right God is so good to us I um I had uh oh here it is here it is um let's turn to Isaiah Isaiah 1 Isaiah 1 like I said I don't I don't have my Bible with me so I thought I I quoted it out but I don't have it but I'll tell you in Isaiah 1 it talks about the vision of Amos um and and in Amos you know uh we understand God raised him up as a prophet and we know by God's grace that when when um the scriptures is is is is being unfold uh to a prophet usually I've not seen where God has said great things but one thing he did say and I'm I'm going to jump here and I'll come back to this later but he told Jeremiah he said he said I know and I've given you I've given you an expected end and so you and I must understand that God God in the the righteous of God we have a a end and is not the wrath of God is actually an expected in and though we be uh few in number God God always work in that that that small group of people Isaiah uh 1 um can I get you to read it um uh brother Frank please yes sir down to the seventh and I want everybody to pay attention to what being said okay the vision of Isaiah the son of Amos which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of oziah J aaz and ezekiah kings of Judah here all heavens and give ear o Earth for the Lord hath spoken I have nourished and brought up children and they have rebeled against me the O knowth his owner and the as his master's creb but Israel does not know my people does not consider sinful Nation hold that just there cuz that that's one of the scriptures I that's really want he said what the ARX know the master and it's amazing because if you look through nature all nature know who God is they know their maker and they listen to his voice but you take a man as I had somebody say the other day out of all the animals we're the most wicked we're the most wicked we do more D damage to the to the Earth and everything else all other animals they they work with nature when we work against nature yet we supposed to be the brilliant ones and and it's a sad situation when we come to a place where uh uh uh the Bible got to tell you that the the what we call dumb animals got better sense more sense in the man they know their creator they know their maker and we have no idea who he is go ahead sir verse four I sinful Nation or people Laden with iniquity a seed of evildoers children that are corruptors they have forsaken the Lord they have provoked the Holy One of Israel unto anger they are gone gone away backward five why should he be shuen anymore ye will Revolt more and more the whole head is sick and the whole heart faints from the soul of the food even unto the head there is no soundness in it but wounds and bruises and petrifying sores they have not been closed neither bound up neither MiFi with one windman seven your country is desolate your cities are burned with fire your land Strang Str devour devour it in your presence and it is desolate as overthrow by strangers you see you see what's happening that that that scripture though it be in Isaiah is actually you could see your our day I mean we got all these foreigners all these people coming in and and you know if when it was being done right that was okay but what I'm trying to say is now we are totally being invaded I mean we got Isis all kind of you know Muslim fa factions and you know we got the Chinese coming in and they are sending all their army forces on feet I mean it just it it amazes me that that people are not Awakening they're not wake they they don't know and then we've got these churches coming together believing that everything can be saved nothing can be saved we're now ready for the burning the only thing that can be saved is the Bride of Jesus Christ no organization can save you no president can save you no Pope can save you the only person that can save you is Jesus Christ himself right and this is what Nehemiah was I mean Jeremiah was saying turn back to God and even though he was opposed by other prophets is still did not stop what the the prophecy of Jeremiah uh from coming to pass matter of fact every Prophet that stood against uh Jeremiah was killed and destroyed whether it be a king a king's Sons whoever it was they were killed by Babylon and this is what I tell people I said I don't care what kind of system they're building at the end of the day Daniel say I saw a stone heun out of the mountain rolling down to Babylon and that same Stone who is Jesus Christ destroyed the image and you and I must understand in order for us to make it we must Al also uh keep our hearts our minds sted on the Lord Jesus read read Jeremiah and read it uh spiritually say the Lord show me where I stand and what I should be doing in this day because what I've been asking the Lord I said I don't know if there be any to be saved but if there are somewhere some show me and give me the Zeal to talk to them cuz people it's like you know you got the life raft and the Titanic is going down and you holding the life life raft not willing to give it to no one else and that's not right if you truly believe this message know that we're right at the end like how long nobody knows but I tell you what it's closer now than it's ever been you know and I want tell you something the the the oncoming election if we have one we'll be an eye opener to a lot of Christians and uh brother brother rich I don't have that quote that quote that you showed me today do you have your phone with you or yeah the scripture yeah I'm let let let yeah yes sir that was a powerful scripture that he shared with me today and I think we we'll end the lessons with that because listen if if we don't get a chance if we don't start praying God can't help you if you don't pray you got to pray you got to ask God to help you to escape this thing I'll read it yeah yeah it's uh it's actually in St St Luke the 21st chapter I'm I'm going to read I'm going to I'm going to read uh the 33rd verse and come on down 32nd verse that's even better said verily I say unto you this generation shall not pass away till all be fulfilled Heaven and Earth shall pass away but my words shall not pass away and take heed to yourself This is what where we're coming at take heed to yourself lest at any time your heart be overcharged with safiy and drunkenness and care of this life and so that they come upon you unawares for as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth watch ye therefore and pray always pray always for what that ye may be counted wory to escape all these things and shall not come to pass that that shall come to pass and to stand before the son of man now he said pray pray that God will count you worthy see if you don't pray God can't count you worthy you got to pray that God will account you worthy to escape all these things that should come to pass and to stand before the son of man if you don't pray that God will account you worthy you may not make it CU prayer is the key prayer is the key prayer is the key if my people they wish I called by my name would humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways he said I will hear from heaven and heal the land and I'm telling you that's where the devil fights us the most prayer but I don't care if it ain't nothing but help me Jesus that's all you know give it to him cuz God knows the heart right it it's it's it's really you know you you look at this thing and I'm like I just can't hardly wait till I get till we get into some other stuff with this because the de the enemy I can't find my Bible I'll find it it's somewhere but my my point is this uh I trust something was said tonight this is like I said just the opening of what God had Jeremiah to do and understand his battles was hard and every time he thought he could trust uh something would always fold and go back just the other way so at the end of the day it was like Jeremiah and his scribe almost that's all he had practically but one thing for certain you think about it and I I'm jumping but I'll say it like this here Jeremiah and I think B I might be pronouncing that wrong but anyway he help Jeremiah write the Scribe write there there's all of his testimonies and and and the word and then um one man heard about it and I think it was the king or whoever it was and we'll read that next time we come but but but he destroyed it can you imagine they didn't have internet they didn't have typewriters they had the rights and if you know the way the Jews their letters and all that that wasn't easy and for somebody to come and just destroy it and then you got God says no do it over again so what I'm trying to tell you is this you got to learn how to expect the unexpected in your life but don't give up you don't give up you got to know who you are when you know who you are you don't give up I saw something on the other day and uh it was on one of my little news clips and I'm going to let you go but they said first first time they had ever witnessed four Eagles sharing the same nest they've never seen that before for his Deliverance you think God just put that together just for them to see it's a Unity it's a coming together y'all understand me that's not even a part of their nature like that sharing the nest and all different ones say have a corner to to to to bring their eggs forth It's not heard of but that's what they saw saw and I seen it on the video it's amazing and I thought to myself the natural types is spiritual if we as Eagles could come together and really share everything that we have without some kind of law or rule helping one another being in unity in such a way Satan will be automatically defeated because Jesus said excuse me brother bam said if I had any gift he said I'd rather have perfect love than any gift there is because one thing about perfect love it can't be defeated love conquers all amen any questions any thoughts and don't be ashamed uh to to to have anything if you have something and you want to write it down and then when I come back I'll add it we'll do that for you too is there anything you want to say Brother Rich I appreciate you all being here let's have stand and have a word of Prayer by the grace of God let's let's show up Sunday excited yeah let let's let's show God that we really love him and appreciate him our Heavenly Father God we come before you we thank you for your goodness and your grace we thank you for being so good to us Lord we we're just working this little bible study Lord and we need your help we need your inspiration and everything that we want the people to see the parallel uh that that's between Jeremiah in our day so they can see their place and their position and know that yes it's a difficult we chosen the harder way but yet and still like brother Brandon was told by that angel we he had a great portion of Heaven waiting on him and we're so glad to be a part of his Revelation or his uh gift because the scripture said that if we uh receive a prophet in the name of prophet we we receive a prophet's reward and father we just so thank you for your Amazing Grace bless each and everyone that came out tonight in your name Jesus Christ we pray amen amen we're dismissed amen
