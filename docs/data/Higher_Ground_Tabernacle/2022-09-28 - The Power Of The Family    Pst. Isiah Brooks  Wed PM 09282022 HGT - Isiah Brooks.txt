this hour [Music] but there will be few in number it is a universal thing and God is really getting his bride amen amen amen amen let me start it off in my key here on the road who he made us two men walk that way [Music] as they reached their destination the two men begged the third to stay and as they talk together breaking bread and pouring I finally now realize the Simplicity of his eyes how can he he desire to have fellowship with me there must be something more within that only he can see I pray the Lord please take my life I give it all to thee today every day you confused you with me [Music] picture and photographs memories of old stories of every kind that has never yet been told and there's a picture in my kitchen that displays the suffers seems [Music] oh how can he desire to

fellowship with me [Music] [Applause] Lord please take my life I give it all to thee oh granted every day you commute with me oh granted every day you commune with me [Music] every day [Music] Hallelujah my Earnest desire I'm not looking for fame I'm not looking for fortune and right now I just want to see him thank you for musicians we're going to ask that you stand with us we appreciate our visitor friend amen this is the slow night but you're more than welcome amen and uh we appreciate everybody that comes out on Wednesday nights because normally gospel God gives us a little more grace amen don't uh if as you see I I'll just leave that alone but you know I just appreciate you and if you have any questions about anything you know we ask that you ask our precious brother no if you need that any questions at the service you could always ask me by God's grace we appreciate everybody Mark the third chapter you met brother Frank brother Frank is a real good brother yeah so he's precious he's a song leader too I didn't say yeah to whatever you said I was just [Laughter] amen we're going to ask that you turn with us to Mark the third chapter which um you know we've been really praying for God to give us a real Revival I'm not talking about the shouting and the dancing and the speaking in tongues and all of the things that everybody consider that consider as a Revival but in reality Revival is getting the trash out of your lives once you can get the trash out of your lifeguard can then fill you with the spirit and then he can use you as a real clean Sanctified vessel but we understand that in this age it doesn't come easy you've got to fight for it you've got to fight every devil that there is to get a hold of God and God ordained it to be so if you truly want the true Holy Spirit the true God of the Old and New Testament in this day you're going to have to look beyond all creeds dogmas all systems everything that appeared to be Christian you find God in his word Mark the third chapter beginning at the 23rd verse we'll read 23 to 27. and I trust by God's grace that he will give me the opportunity to at least get the meat of what I want to say out tonight without keeping you so long uh because I realize amen that a lot of things will be said by God's grace and I trust that you know that you'll be blessed mark 3 23 and he called them unto him and said unto them in parables how can Satan cast out Satan if a kingdom be divided against itself that Kingdom cannot stand and if a house be divided against itself that house cannot stand now the word house can be used as your own home your own house but it also can be mean a nation it could also fit into uh you know people say I'm I'm a Baptist I'm a method I'm a president I'm this now uh but how can it stand if it be divided and if Satan rise up against himself and be divided he cannot stand but hath and in so you understand what division does it literally brings things to an end no man can enter into the strong man house and spoil his Goods except he with first buying the strong man and then he was spoiled his house Matthew 20 excuse me Matthew 12 28 through 30. Jesus speaking but if I cast out Devils by the spirit of God because remember In this passage of scripture they called him Beelzebub they called him the devil but if I cast out Devils by the spirit of God then the kingdom of God is come unto you or else how can one enter into a strong man's house spoil is good except he first buying the strong man and then he will spoiled his good his house excuse me he that is not with me is against me and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad isn't that something one more scripture Luke 12 51 53 I suppose you that I come to give I suppose that I am come to give peace on Earth I tell you nay but rather division for which from his Force there shall be five in one house divided three against two and two against three the father shall be divided against the son and the son against the father the mother against the daughter and the daughter against the mother the Mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law and the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law let's pray Heavenly Father God we come before you we thank you for your grace and your mercy and we thank you for being so good to us Lord we thank you God for being so good to us we pray father that you would bless the service in a special way move me completely out of your way Lord have thine own way and speak to your people the words Hallelujah that you would have them to hear in your name Jesus Christ we pray amen you may be seated I don't know whether or not our sister Joanne is listening in when God gave me this message I had no idea what you were going to go through but I will say that when we preach that message about the unexpected uh attack of the enemy the unexpected battle and how we ought to behave when these things do take place you see because a battle take us unexpectedly it doesn't mean that we loses the battle because every battle is ordained by God and God expect us to win these battles but you can't win the battle until you learn how to trust the word when you trust God God will fight your battle you understand me my subject tonight is the power of the family now I know that sounds strange but just give me a time or two and I'll try to bring you to a place where Satan has been hiding himself because the family in itself is one of God's institutions you know the church is and we call it church family we call each other brothers we call each other sisters but in the beginning when God made Adam and Eve Adam and Eve was the family of God and then from Adam and Eve was to Spring Offspring which would have been for Adam and Eve's family which would have been the family of God it's always been that way God had a family he was a father you can't be a father without having offspring so we realize by the grace of God that when we when it comes to these things you and I must understand because of the Fall got Calvary was all about restoring the family of God right even the Bible said the whole Heaven and Earth the family of God is named after him now Adam and Eve and then their family but we know what happened the serpent came in and he broke what did he do divide it the family divided Adam and Eve now you got to hear what I'm saying because I'm gonna tell you that's what has happened to America that's why we see the chaos that we see now because Satan was smart and shrewd and he knew how to break the backbone of the nation and he did just that and now because of what he did and because of what we allowed him to do this is why we see chaos everywhere and he's not finished with it either this season that we are now living in is so broken with distrust and jealousies and hatred even amongst families is that right I mean how did that happen I can remember in my day family was family yeah you can fall off or you'll fall back in Mama made sure you did it say you're sorry and those things we had to do but because of what Satan has done families are now killing one another without any remorse but God comes to restore his family and he starts with trust because that's you say well you know trust is something else she says have faith in God well you can't have faith in God till you trust God and Trust bring you into believing God or believing in him right amen Faith uh have faith and do you believe in me is what Jesus says right because that's what happened even when God told Adam and Eve don't eat of the tree don't do this no doubt Adam told Eve and Satan came and he broke her faith in her own husband and when he broke the faith in the husband he broke the belief and therefore when he when belief is is is is is is broken you know what believing is when I say I believe that means I'm agreeing with you I'm in an agreement with you hey and once that agreement is broken then Satan comes in and brings division and he knows how to work in our minds to bring in unbelief because unbelief is the only true sin right sin in itself is unbelief unbelief in what unbelief in God unbelief in the word and right now it is what our nation and the world is trying to get rid of the Bible trying to get rid of the word trying to get rid of Christians who believe in the word but Satan has failed before he started because God has already established everybody amen that that will make bride you know we're living in a day and we in such a chaotic age and you know the Bible says according to Amos he says I will I will not do anything except I show it to my servant the prophet amen Amos 3 7. and you know it's amazing because we don't even see that the world is about to end everything I just saw on the on a a report uh yesterday how Russia and China had ships a hundred miles out of Los Angeles checking us out ready for the battle and people don't understand that the world can't take another battle not atomic Hallelujah but they fail to see it must happen it's got to happen it's just one of those things that is preeminent we don't know the exact day and it's going to happen but it's going to happen why is it a few months ago maybe of a year a year ago after the after the covet because Eternal Genesis 6. and I turned to Genesis 6 and Genesis 6 talks about how violence was all through the land just before the flood you understand me violence men hating one another right and listen we we know by God's grace that that the the prejudices that we're now experiencing has never been color they make it a color now but in all nations All Nations it has always been Tribal wars it's about what tribe you belong to even Israel they had 12 tribes and they fought each other when they were supposed to be United y'all understand what I'm saying so the devil knows how to bring division by pointing out something that's little and a little difference that's all he needs a little difference it meant to break up the house that's what he does even among Every Nation whether you're black white yellow green purple with it don't make no difference if you have different tribals tribes one thing they're better than the next how did that happen right it was Satan Satan who made one think that the other one was better than the next y'all don't maybe you don't hear me but all of this is to keep Mankind from uniting now that I think about it even in the days of old right after the flood men saw one another as being the same and they built a towel they were on one mind one Accord and had not God stopped them they would have built a tower up to the heavens is that right but God said never again hallelujah what did he do he confused the other languages and he knew that Satan would take opportunity in that to make one think that they're better than the other he not only stopped that but we had the Continental Divide and God began to break up the land mass put one here put one there put them here and put them there and he did all of that because he knew Satan was the author of confusion Hallelujah now oh y'all come on now you know it's true and then what what they say did Satan do when when there was just tribal laws and people were still trying to come together to be one and then he he brought in this uh damnable hearsay that we all came from monkeys and that was the Divide us even more it's the truth because he knows that when you get mad on one Accord he's capable of doing any and everything now let me you know I I didn't even go I didn't even intend to go that far [Laughter] but you see where I'm going with let me show you the institution of marriage a marriage ceremony is really based upon trust and love you can't say well it's based on beauty because you'll find some couples and you wonder where and how it happened because you might find one man that he may be handsome other he might be ugly and the woman might be beautiful and you look at that like how but you see it's mystical it's a mystery it's somehow when God put two together and they know it that they know that they know are automatic Trust comes and you don't even know where it came from love her well she been good to me she's Rich she's pretty you can give all of those answers and every everyone will be wrong the best answer to that is I don't know why I love her I just know I do right it's not it's unconditional they're not circumstances there to say I love you because if you say I love her because she gives me gifts every year well what happens when she stops see that that that's not real but you find a couple or individual and somehow they connect in a way they don't even understand it how it happens but they know it's real Hallelujah and you find the trust it's true trust and believing right you know it's amazing because maybe I've been a little bit too liberal but I'll say when it comes to my wife I've never distrusted her when it comes to another man it never it just you know uh uh I can remember I backed that up I remember I didn't distrust her but I remember there was a little jealousy about a one fella but anyway I don't want to embarrass you either but you see the thing was it wasn't it wasn't her it was me you understand what I'm saying I'm saying but then God knocked on this block one day and woke me up she probably about no idea what I'm talking about but anyhow God brought me through that little error in my mind marriage ceremonies are based upon trust Than Love you know I mean it's something about this trust well trust and love goes together you know it's a key it's something that clicks you together and you don't even know how it happened or you don't know why it happened and when it happened but it happened I'm saying something here because you got to understand that what Adam felt for Eve wasn't based upon how good looking she was when I guarantee she was probably the best woman of the most beautifulest woman ever formed because she was the number one it wasn't her beauty but it was something he trusted and he loved her so much until he knew he couldn't live without her now I'm coming to something because she's pretty because she's Rich because she's kind she did this she did that and all of that runs out all wrong answers see I love her because I love her and I don't know why I love her love is a mystery it is an agreement to agree is that I do I do you see what I'm saying I trust you with all my heart don't you ever marry someone you cannot trust with all your heart well I feel I might not well you better not if you feel that you might not you understand what I'm saying because it's got to be a mutual thing it's got to be a connection that that that you cannot explain people said love at first sight I believe in that but it ain't just that I would appearance the individuals are in love with is somehow they connect with your inner man because it's really Supernatural Satan tactic is to divide and conquer the home he knows that the house divided can't stand listen if all of America homes if they would all mothers and fathers sisters and brothers would get together and confess and say forgive me I love you it'll straighten the nation out everything will be straightened Satan would be defeated because he'll never have at that point he has no Avenue no place to enter in to divide see that's the kind of trust God wants to have with us a trust that he knows that you're going to remain a virgin unto him and that you're not going to allow Satan to to to to to come in with some kind of Lie to make you disbelieve his word you hear what I'm saying it's it's I love him and if I love him I believe every word he says even though I don't understand it all I believe it all and that's what he said and in this day do you think I come to bring peace he says no I come to bring sword why because everybody here is not mine I come Amen to divide houses because everybody in the house is not mine you say what go down to Jericho there's a woman over there right all the Jericho is not mine but God came in and all of a sudden there was a division see God brings the word as well he separate the right from the wrong but Satan brings in confusion the strong man has to be bound and in this case the strong man is Satan he's the devil and God is willing to come in and cast him out spoil his Goods make him ashamed he thought he had what he had but what he had is no longer his now you say well brother books where are you going with this when the families mothers and fathers y'all know that's true right everybody is gone All Families almost every family I know is going everybody going every way but this way the unity of the family is almost gone there was a time husbands and wives and children sat down together and had Bible studies taught them talked about the Lord you know what I mean it was god-centered but Satan knew he could not allow this to remain so what did he do he brought the television we kicked that out he brought the iPad the the he kept working it and now even the families are more interested listen I've seen it happen I was at Gray's Lake one time and he was a husband and wife on a boat supposed to be a love affair a little sweet Audi she had her back turned and she was on her phone and he was on his phone and the boat was just moving by itself what was that you see the division they don't even know it what did covet do when people who had not mothers and fathers who hadn't seen each other probably in a long time because they're always working one worked the ship that works it's just trick of the enemy so when Kobe came and they had to be in the same house they couldn't get a loan brought a lot of divorces did y'all know that see but the devil knows what he's what are you saying these things for if we're going to have a Revival in this church it must start with the families families must pull themselves together and realize the world is more important than anything else absolutely I'm guilty but I'm willing to repent pining the strong man right listen they tell us listen it's in the word we never thought we'll see this day Mothers Against fathers fathers again mother sisters against Brothers against this everybody's against everybody guess what and they probably don't even know wow I don't trust this one why you don't trust him I don't believe that why you don't believe because you have a lack of Love especially when the person is telling you the truth second Corinthians says for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh for the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal But Mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds what are you saying remember that sister her husband was an alcoholic and she was a real devout Christian love the Lord and her husband went out with the boys and her husband told them uh uh they said oh man ah hey these Christians he ain't no such thing as Christian that one drunk says wait a minute if there ain't nothing but one I know who she is and he says my wife is a Christian what a testimony for a drunkard to give about his wife that his wife and listen they're divided but she still trusts him she still loves him just the way he is if somebody help me and the truth of the matter is a man says oh come on home they came home and he says listen we're going to put it to the test watch what I do honey come get me some food I think she fixing some eggs and stuff and then she brought the eggs and said he's just acting super drunk you know I don't like my eggs like that fix them over what she do she knelt on that floor and she began to pick up those eggs but she had Jesus in her mind Hallelujah she knew what the word says Hallelujah he was obedient to the word amen and she said she began to sing must Jesus bear the cross alone and all the world go free no there's a cross for everyone and there's a cross for me Hallelujah guess what her husband got saved in all of his buddies see all you got to do is be salty Hallelujah allow God to keep the unity of the spirit and the bond of Peace that's what we're here for the Bible says amen that the world will know us by the love that we have one toward another we don't fight against flesh and blood but spiritual wickedness in her places is that right you know we can't just you know people say well I I just you know Bob says casting down listen the weapon of our Warfare are not carnal But Mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds casting down imaginations and every High thing that exalt itself and that's the thing it seemed like everybody when they get saved all of a sudden they got the spirit of discernment hey and that's all you can do is discern bad spirit and you better check your discernment because discernment discerns everything right it's up against the knowledge of God and bring into a captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ I know you said but brother Brooks just seem like it's off the wall but you know what somebody need this and it's going to somebody that somebody might just be me you understand me because listen I'm seeing things I've never seen before right precious brother gave me this scripture and I told him I said I'm going to use this thing Psalms 23 5-7 dial prepares the table before me in the presence of my enemy God set you up for the battle in the presence of your enemy thou anointed my hair with oil my cup Running Oh see God don't put you in a battle without anointing you the anointing comes as well as the battle but this is the part that I like surely goodness and mercy shall follow me they ain't going to go before you it ain't coming with you it's coming after you follow you no matter what you go through his goodness and mercy is coming when you think you're in a dark Valley when you think that the battle has been been won by the enemy here come God that's the way it is you say oh no brother yes it is when Israel thought they had to had lost to the Battle of of of with the Philistines he'd come a little boy with carrots and biscuits and whatever more he was carrying to his brothers is that right they thought it was all over Goliath had won and here come a little fella who trusts the Lord is that right and that's what David said trust the Lord with all your heart and lean not to your own understanding you acknowledge Him and He will direct your path that's it no matter how big the devil is he ain't big enough you understand me your God my God Amen he is a defeater he is a giant slayer Hallelujah there's not a civilization that man has built that could withstand the judgments of God Hallelujah Egypt couldn't do it Rome couldn't do it Creek couldn't do it amen I'm sure there are others but my point is every one of them that thought they were so great and that they could outsmart God where are they now I don't care how great this country is it'll never be able to outsmart God when you challenge God which we have boy we got it coming amen surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and I would dwell in the house of the Lord forever David apologizing for cutting the Garment of Saul right he could have killed him but he didn't right it's amazing how we can say and do things to one another and think God is not watching hello he's watching everything he's even taking down your thoughts right now is being recorded on your position and your attitude and everything else about the word of God hallelujah foreign this is the turn right and and listen you it's amazing what an apology would do and I find out that there are so many Christians I can't apologize what are you talking about uh forgiveness what are you saying you can't forgive you need a real baptism of the Holy Ghost if you can't forgive that means God can't forgive you but brother but you don't know what I've gone through hey I don't need to know what you're going through everybody's going through something and some people worse than what you going through Hallelujah but the beauty of it is that God didn't choose them he chose you what a mighty God we serve Hallelujah I'm doing everything but shouting up here folks I'm in my spirit he's moving this way and moving that way God is good God is good God is good see what is it it's amazing how jealous he can bring a person down you know jealousy was brought on by the church people you know during David's time jealousy you know that's why it's not good to praise people oh brother so-and-so you're so good oh brother it's all right to comment them at time but don't overdo it the flesh is weak he get lifted he get puffed up y'all know it's true I don't like too much of it because it hinders my preaching and sometimes it hinders my singing people don't understand what I work through Amen to get God's glory to come down yeah I just want to hear him say Well done right hey me and a brother was talking about says yeah David says you know can you imagine they're having a wonderful church service and all of a sudden you know how they break out in the chair and he said saw a thousand and David oh my goodness and I'm the king he's the king you know Saul's the king and you know you're praising the member of the church you're giving him more Glory see it didn't bother David why did it bother Saul because Saul was carnal jealousy right can be it can be a wicked inspiration it is a wicked especially if it's the wrong kind of Godly jealousy is one thing but when it's jealousy against your brothers or jealousy against your sister you know that is so wicked and literally it divides the church being divided don't doesn't matter it does when Jesus was getting ready to raise up Tabitha amen he put all the unbelievers out all of them get out why because he knew A House Divided can't stand normally that's what happens when you go to church and somebody's trying to get God want to heal them they can't heal them because you got unbelievers we believe us and that unbelieving Spirit hinders God God loves one Accord nest and he doesn't care if it's two or three because he said if you gather in my name two or three right that's what you will and it shall be given it's not the mass the multitude you know what we need to start saying those who don't believe y'all can go you can be excused right division is something else and what we don't realize is that division just didn't start here it was in heaven Lucifer divided the church in heaven that's why we got angels and that's how we got demons demons followed Lucifer and those that stay with God are angels Hallelujah is that right he brought that same division down into Earth now look at this look look look look look and then when when when when when when Satan or Lucifer who being a murderer inspired the serpent and and guess what the the seed of the serpent comes and he's a murderer and what did he do divided the family so it was so bad because he wouldn't repent God drove him out of the Garden of Eden and from from ever since then you've had two kinds of people a people of God and the people of the devil and what happens they mix all up mix all up and then the flood y'all know how that works and then at the end of the day God knows them that are his no matter how mixed up it is with us God knows the bloodline amen and after the encountered God's mercy and goodness will do what follow you how many times that's been sold in your darkest night in your darkest hour your darkest moment when you think it can't get any worse then all of a sudden the sun shines it happens because goodness and mercy shall what follow them follow you why the seed of God you don't understand how blessed you are but God is in he's he's he says listen content for the word faith that was once delivered unto the Saints and that Faith was Unity it was they loved each other look what God did when when ananias and Sapphire tried to bring Separation by their actions she's a little living levels the whole lump if he had only let that go others would have done the same but God made an example and destroyed them right there that day is coming again because God's bringing Unity to the Church of God and when I say that I mean universal I don't mean in just a little Fellowship I mean God is bringing Unity there's a working that God is doing in the hearts of men and all they want to do is love and forgive love and forgive and restore that's it you know we're not caring about who you are where you came from all that kind of crazy stuff I don't need to know your mom or your dad or neither your grandpa you don't know what I'm saying I don't need to know none of that the truth of the matter is we're Sons and Daughters of God you have heard the call of this end time message and God has brought you out of a system we can allow this to become another system we've got to fight we've got to move we gotta tear down every Philistine there is It's gotta be guess what you're gonna look like the radical you're going to look like the oddball because you on fire for God let everybody else be lukewarm if they want to be Hallelujah but those of us who can discern the time and the season hallelujah we're praying God set my soul of fire Hallelujah glory to God you love the Lord oh my God I'm gonna read this Matthew 10 24 you don't have to turn there he said think not that I've come to send peace on Earth I came not to send peace but a sword for I am come to set us man at variance against his father now when God dropped that King sword into the prophet's hand and that king showed us now in the bride's hand what do you think he says oh this is a beautiful sword no God gave that sword to fight it is a great division oh my God it's not to bring peace everybody so oh I want to tell a message I want to tell him I want to witness to him and praise God but let me tell you something if that individual those individuals if they're ordained of God you bring peace but if they're not again of God you bring War but we can't be afraid hello we got to be like the woman amen Jesus said you got five of us and one you got ain't your own she was a prostitute and she could care less whether she'd be stoned or not but she went into the City and said come see your man that's all I'm saying you got to drop all these feelings your feelings ah oh I can't witness this they might say no or they may say this or they may say that don't care about what they say you are seed you plant the seed you do what you got to do amen relatives it doesn't make any difference if relatives are wrong there's no way I'm gonna stand with a relative mom no because God Is Watching Me he's watching me if my relative is wrong and the other brother is right I'm standing with the right you understand me that's the way it's supposed to be oh that's my natural brother I hope God don't care about your natural brother amen to ask Jesus if Jesus your mother your father your mother and brother who you know how to go they're here to see you and Jesus who is my mother who is my brother who is my sister but those that do my my father's will right those are real brothers and sisters those who do the father's will people say no I gotta stick with my family ah because if my family going to hell our show ain't going with them that's just it I'm being real with you that's just real yeah if they're going to hell I ain't going with them no go buy yourself that place you can go by yourself that's all I'm saying if I have come to set a man that varians against his father and his and and and and and and the daughter against his mother and the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law and a man's foe shall what be they of his own household that's where your battle is coming from it's not from the street or you know you might get some battles off of a job but your main battles it's going to come from the church that's where it's at and God put all us together to make us what bring each other to perfection right was it iron sharp in his arm that's what it is don't get up oh my sister listen you don't look at your sister did not read the scripture we do not wrestle against flesh and blood it ain't your sister it ain't your brother it's the spirit that operating on them listen the Lord understood it When They Crucified him he said father forgive them for they know not what they do now that's love when you make excuses and understand it's a spirit that's talking and not the person himself and he said and he listen and he that loveth father a mother more than me is not worthy of me and he that love is son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me and he that taketh not his cross and follow after me is not worthy of me if the battle is coming the battle is coming if the battle is with your wife or your husband your son and your daughter amen it's the battle but at the end of the day whoever you were battling with must see you standing on the word you keep that nonsin up what you go what God always come first God always come first and it's just a matter of Truth and the Bible said the truth shall make you free he that receiveth you receiveth me and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me he that receiveth the prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive what a prophet's reward um he said I don't believe in the prophets no more but you don't believe the full word because God said there will be some and what people don't understand is that in this last day God sent us a prophet why because of the mess we're living in everybody's right now everybody's not right God is right and God interprets his own word amen and when God sent the prophet the majority of the people don't receive him that's the truth even when Jesus came the prophet of all prophets right the world turned his back on him crucified him even the church hated him why he used the Living Word show me one thing he did wrong show me one thing he did Evil Jesus Christ right they said that when they were crucifying Jesus Mary ran up to the you know I think this is Josephus account Mary ran up and says what did he do what did he do he was good they slapped in her face see people don't want to hear truth they say they do when truth comes is a different story he that receiveth you receiveth me he that receiveth me receiving him that sent me he the receiver the prophet in the name of the Prophet shall receive a prophet's reward he that receiveth the righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man reward and whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold water only in the name of it of of a disciple verily I say unto you he shall in no wise lose his real war we forget about that but my point is this and I'm coming to a close in this session may God help us all because our most of our marriages are I won't say marriages I want to say families a fact is fragmented and it's going to take God to bring it all together don't even think you can do it it takes down on my knees just like that woman when she was being mistreated about her husband she went down on her knees you know what I'm saying that's the only thing but you gotta understand Focus bring a Unity to my family bring a Unity between my wife and me you understand me bring a Unity Lord so that we can be an example in the church a little 11 levels to hold up you know when you see a family together it is the one of the most beautiful things you've ever seen and I'll be honest with you in my life I've only seen a few families throughout the Pentecostal church and some in the message that was so United you could tell it they weren't faking it was real love and respect for one another how many of y'all remember how we used to have respect for one another but in America and I guess in all over the world are these cartoons have showed these children how to be disrespectful not only to their mothers to their fathers to their their that's the scripture right wives been disrespectful to their husbands husbands disrespectful to them y'all understand me how do they see this television right and all of that stuff has been slowly moving in a dark way to do what divide the family and it's done just that because we know and listen it stayed outside of the church for a long time until we welcomed it in right we allowed it to come in and when it came in guess what our children became delinquent you know what brother Brandon said he said you ought to spank the parents I thought I I forgot I forgot to paste it but he said you ought to spank the parents because they're the ones who delinquent foreign may God help us I've been crying out that the teachers they for Sunday school teachers you got to teach them if you don't Lord may God help us and that's one thing I love about my wife she's she's constantly trying to give Judah that word you know and I appreciate that she's more she's faithful to it the more faithful that I am you know but you gotta teach these children how to love God and know that God is not a tyrant he's a god of love and God if you trust God he'll he'll he'll he'll manifest himself to you doesn't make any difference how old you are you can be young I can remember praying before the Lord didn't even know him but I knew the god of my mom you know what I'm saying I've seen God work in her life and I would pray things and I knew he would do it and he would do it let me tell you something you cannot pray for a better family and God won't listen don't listen this is oh his whole thing about Redemption is to bring his family back together in such a love that they would have such a respect for one another amen that they wouldn't let one crack come between them and that's what has got to start we got to start here with that I don't care if your family is unsaved you still gotta love them and if you've done wrong make it right they need to see Jesus in you right and people of God we wouldn't have never known I'm trying to say this enclosure let me close there's a lot of things I could have said this tonight but let me say it like this if the world is falling apart because of the vision what are we supposed to be doing because the Bible tells us even the prophet of God comes along and says this is United times and signs this is the invisible Union of the bride with her husband and our Union comes by way of trust and believe in one another and when we can trust and believe one another that means we don't have to worry about you gossiping we don't have to worry about you backbiting we don't have to you understand me and we understand that if you misunderstand me you're going to be a man or woman enough to try to get it under understanding of what's being said you know what I mean you're not going to let the devil play in your mind because that's where division comes I'm guilty and I'm sure all of us have been guilty one point or another but you know we need to repent and ask God to say Lord help us be better Christians this is my family I'm part of your family where you like it or not vice versa and we need to treat each other that way love one another that's what Jesus said love each other even as I have loved you people of God I know it just it may be a simple message but I tell you the truth this is a foundational message if we could work on this you'll be surprised on how to change things that's been the issue here and everywhere else Everybody Somebody think they're better than somebody else and because they don't come from this when they come from that and you know I'm thinking where do I fit in you understand what I'm saying my point is listen there's only one blood hello that's what the Bible says we all came from one blood that means our origin is from the same place and there's only one blood that was shed for you and that's the blood of Jesus Christ right no man can save you you can't even save yourself it's all about the grace of God trusting that God will deal with your heart and you know it's amazing how we all go through something I I I I hope my sister I I really hurt for our sister Joanne it's something personal that I can't say over the pulpit but I hurt and you know I I could feel the pain but I want to if she's looking at this I want to tell her you don't you you know just try your best to straighten up and trust God this might look like the worst but God got something better you know no man is in control of this God is in control and you know I've seen my own children you know put me in a position I mean I'm thinking oh my but you know what I trust God and I always go back to the fact that God saved job's children they got killed while they were partying right and God gave job his children God can give me mine that's the way I look at it I trust him let's stand I hope this has been a blessing to you and those of us who are fathers and you know we know we got one mama in here we got to work hard we got to get our family back we got to get our children back try to sow the word you know try to sow the word as much as you possibly can you know uh but most of all pray you gotta pray God that God will work quick and fast through prayer he can do things you can't do is that right so let's just pray that God let's pray before we met dismiss let's pray that God will unite the families in this church and that they would resolve all their differences husband and wives children you know how disobedient children are now they talking sassy their mom and their daddy oh my God it wasn't like that in my day and now even the politics is again it's for them no they can talk to you and you can't touch them oh you don't live in my house then because God say spare the rod just bought a child I believe that I don't believe you need to abuse them but I need you need to spank them enough that they know that the devil just pulls a trick on them right I just believe that if you don't teach them there is a devil they'll never know it's one psychology and all that stuff saying that's you no no no there's two Inspirations one is of God and one is of the devil right that's the way it works let us pray our gracious father God we come before you we thank you for your grace and your mercy we thank you for being so good to us Lord I wish I could just preach it the way I feel it and the way I see it oh God have mercy upon us Lord I I was thinking about the power of the family and and Lord how how how how great that is there was one family and we recall his own that's on record uh and it was nicodin uh that was in the scripture Lord and how God that his prayers went up as a as a memorial father I pray right now Lord Jesus that you give us families like that that when the Holy Ghost moves it moves on all of us Lord help us now Lord keep us and guide us Lord and oh God be real because when we find ourselves being divided we find ourselves denying the very cross and the Very cause of your coming help us dear Jesus unite our families bring love and trust back between husband and wives and sons and daughters and children Lord help us now Lord God that will work together as a team we'll pray together Lord and fast together in whatever it takes to get these this work done help us now Lord I'm willing Lord to go all the way I want to see a Revival my heart thirsts for the true and living God not some denominational thing some systematic worship but the kind of worship there Hallelujah the head oh God since the day of Pentecost all the way up throughout the ages men who knew you who had your name written on their hearts help us Jesus forgive us Lord for all of our shortcomings forgive us of our idolatory ways Lord that help with God set our souls of Fire let us be whatever they want us to be but most of all let us be what you want us to be bless us now keep us in guide us Lord in Jesus Christ's name we pray
