[20:55] you know we praise the lord for bringing
[20:57] us this far hey
[21:02] without taking too much time we can
[21:03] stand and read the bible
[21:07] we open our bibles in the book of
[21:09] proverbs
[21:12] we read the 22nd chapter
[21:15] and the first verse
[21:19] [Music]
[21:23] proverbs
[21:25] chapter 22
[21:28] the first verse
[21:38] the bible says
[21:40] a good name is rather to be chosen than
[21:43] great reaches
[21:45] and loving favor
[21:47] rather than silver or gold
[21:52] repetition
[21:54] [Music]
[21:59] and uh let's let's go again to genesis
[22:02] 27 36
[22:07] [Music]
[22:10] genesis chapter 27 verse 36
[22:24] yeah chapter 27 verse 26 verse 36 my bad
[22:28] i'm sorry
[22:32] i'm sorry
[22:33] the bible says
[22:35] and he said he's not it's not he rightly
[22:38] named jacob for he has supplanted me
[22:42] these two times
[22:44] he took away my birthright
[22:46] and behold now he has taken away my
[22:48] blessing
[22:49] and he said has thou not reserved a
[22:52] blessing for me
[22:55] yeah genesis 27 verse 36
[23:22] [Music]
[23:48] thank you father god for giving us our
[23:50] father lord this good health mercedes of
[23:52] adolescent day thank you father god for
[23:55] giving us so follow this breath of life
[23:59] for now i want to approach to your word
[24:00] father god we pray that you'll be with
[24:02] us
[24:25] tonight i think if i can
[24:27] call it give it a subject or title it'll
[24:30] be a name change
[24:36] a name change so uh
[24:38] it doesn't mean that you know we have to
[24:40] change our name so you know
[24:43] no you know what it means that the bible
[24:45] every time most of the time when the
[24:47] bible uses the word names you know it
[24:49] more likely means character
[24:55] so basically a character changed a
[24:57] change of character it's about
[25:00] the character because you know it's a
[25:02] new year we're going to a new year you
[25:04] know
[25:05] you know new year doesn't mean you have
[25:07] to flip the page and forget about
[25:09] everything that happens
[25:14] because if you're not if there is no
[25:16] change the same you who was last year
[25:18] you will be the same you know the next
[25:20] coming year
[25:23] so if oh i forget what i just said uh
[25:27] if
[25:28] let's move on
[25:31] i'm sorry
[25:32] you know uh last year if if you did if
[25:35] there is no change it'll be the same
[25:37] year who was last year that would be the
[25:39] same view next year
[25:48] you know that's why i say you know a
[25:50] change of a name a name change
[25:55] because we know that every time that we
[25:57] in the bible you know names represented
[25:59] characters
[26:04] you see the bible is talking about you
[26:05] know lao laodicea
[26:08] but if you go you know studied the
[26:10] audition
[26:14] you will see that as the bible says you
[26:15] know it was uh neat it was uh neither
[26:18] neither cold nor or hot
[26:22] in nation
[26:27] you know one from the south and the
[26:29] other one from the north lands
[26:33] and the one from the south was bringing
[26:34] hot water
[26:49] and if you drink it you will vomit
[26:52] so meaning that you know as its name you
[26:55] know as the character is it comes
[26:58] and i also believe that when adam was
[27:00] naming animals
[27:03] no he didn't just name animals just by
[27:05] the sake of naming them in apaches
[27:07] donation he saw the character of each
[27:10] animals and then he gave a certain
[27:12] specific name to it
[27:15] you know it's so a lion was a little bit
[27:17] aggressive and he gave him a name life
[27:21] you know
[27:22] so it's so uh a lamb and then he gave
[27:24] him a lamb
[27:27] you know all that was the name it was
[27:29] attaching character to them
[27:32] and i believe here in this room that we
[27:34] most of us here do have bible's name or
[27:36] we have names that have good meanings
[27:41] if our character doesn't compare the oh
[27:43] it doesn't match up with the name that
[27:45] we do here
[27:52] only having a name doesn't mean anything
[27:54] that's
[27:55] a minority you know last time when i
[27:57] preached uh well we said that you know
[27:59] we read from the bible where we saw five
[28:02] women had to go to one man
[28:08] to ask that men to have you know they
[28:10] went to him and said give us just your
[28:12] name and don't we don't care about
[28:14] anything that we would do
[28:19] they just wanted a name but they didn't
[28:21] want to take the character that was
[28:23] coming with this name
[28:27] you know as the bible says you know
[28:28] everything that you ask in the name of
[28:30] jesus
[28:32] you know it doesn't mean that it's just
[28:34] the name jesus
[28:36] you know because there is a lot of
[28:38] people you know we have our brothers
[28:39] mexicans you know they're all named
[28:41] jesus because i want to pray mexican
[28:45] when he's talking about jesus he's
[28:47] basically talking about the character of
[28:49] jesus
[28:52] and my wish this year this coming year
[28:54] is that everybody you know if we can
[28:56] change our
[29:03] you know god god will really use us in
[29:05] the in the in a spreading of you know
[29:07] better than how we did yeah last year
[29:13] the more we go or the more years we
[29:15] spend and you know the more you know our
[29:18] spiritual will become or the more you
[29:20] know closer to god we become
[29:22] the more the prisons of our son the
[29:24] priesthood
[29:27] you know we read here in genesis 27 so
[29:29] i've only done genesis no it's basically
[29:31] talking about jacob
[29:33] you know you see that jacob was blessed
[29:35] by his father okay
[29:37] but still he had his name with him
[29:40] you know he said the name jacob means a
[29:42] subplaner
[29:46] you know a supplanter you know someone
[29:47] who would do everything in his power to
[29:49] get whatever he needs yeah can't keep it
[29:51] felt you know he can't wait
[30:05] now and then after he met the angel
[30:08] you know he saw that you know when his
[30:10] life was changed
[30:13] you know but but his name was not
[30:15] changed
[30:16] you know now you heard the new jacob
[30:19] same with the same old name that wasn't
[30:22] matching up some
[30:24] god has to give him a new name
[30:28] of israel
[30:30] you know but israel that that means the
[30:31] one who has fought with with the angel
[30:33] with god and he has overcome israel
[30:38] thank you you know as i say that we most
[30:40] of us most of us don't have bible's name
[30:42] by bible names
[30:44] for example you know my name is isaac
[30:46] for example
[30:47] if you say isaac means laughter
[30:54] laughter so which the way i understand
[30:56] it is like you know it's someone who
[30:58] it's really hard for him to get mad or
[31:00] to get frustrated
[31:06] [Music]
[31:12] you know name and character character is
[31:14] something very important
[31:16] the prophet says that a character is a
[31:18] victory
[31:20] you know a character is not a gift
[31:23] you know a character is a victory
[31:25] it's something that we have to fight for
[31:29] it's something that we have to you know
[31:30] it's not it's not freely gift
[31:34] you know it's something that you have to
[31:35] win it okay
[31:37] you have to fight for it
[31:40] it's when the lord is giving you trials
[31:42] and temptations
[31:59] you know because here sam uh solomon
[32:02] says that a good name is better than
[32:04] gold
[32:06] salomon
[32:08] you know a good character is better than
[32:10] all the riches of the world
[32:14] what benefit you will have when you have
[32:16] all the goals and you don't have a good
[32:18] or a good uh uh character or a good name
[32:23] you know by the second thing is that we
[32:25] who call ourselves christians that shows
[32:28] that you know who have the name of
[32:30] christ attached to us
[32:33] you know when we go out in the city
[32:36] you know when we go out to schools you
[32:37] know
[32:39] you know when we go when we go to work
[32:42] no we don't reflect the name of the
[32:44] character we don't reflect the character
[32:46] attached to the name christ
[32:50] you know it's hard for people to say
[32:52] that this one is a christian yeah
[33:07] which means that when people have to
[33:09] expect something that is greater than
[33:11] what in our life right now
[33:14] expectations the premier secretary you
[33:16] know but you know we have to change our
[33:18] character has to change
[33:21] you know and the only person who can do
[33:22] it is god
[33:25] you know the only person who can do it
[33:27] is god that's a person
[33:28] if you can only come to him
[33:32] this is a new year
[33:34] i don't want to just turn the page of
[33:36] the book
[33:38] but i wanna i wanna have a change i
[33:40] wanna experiment something you know a
[33:42] change in my life because we have an
[33:44] experiment you know you see that you had
[33:45] a bad habit
[33:48] you know you were
[33:49] stubborn or something jacob
[33:52] you know but you pray to god and say
[33:54] lord this new year i want to be a new
[33:56] person
[33:58] jesus
[33:59] look at me and say lord lord i want i
[34:01] want people you know those who knew me i
[34:03] don't want them to recognize me again
[34:05] anymore
[34:08] you know you used to come
[34:10] late to church you know you say lord i
[34:12] wanna you know i wanna change i wanna
[34:14] have a good character change my
[34:16] characters
[34:26] you know we have a lot of people in the
[34:27] bible you know that the names you know
[34:29] where where you know who reflected their
[34:32] lives
[34:41] you know he was a man he was a a very uh
[34:43] angry man a mad man
[34:49] 10 of his servants you know to go to him
[34:51] and and and to ask him i think he did
[34:53] something to david and they did david
[34:56] send his servant to go to him to go talk
[34:58] to him
[35:00] david
[35:14] 25 25.
[35:19] you know you will see that neighbor the
[35:21] the uh
[35:22] neighbor
[35:23] the the name of neighbor means adult or
[35:26] a vile person
[35:35] yeah
[35:36] so and that's how it works second
[35:38] circulating you know that's that's
[35:40] that's what is reflected
[35:56] my prayer this morning i made it tonight
[36:00] is that you know to pray to god to say
[36:02] lord
[36:04] lord i i don't want i you know i want to
[36:06] change
[36:08] but i want to i want to have a new walk
[36:10] with you via you know i want to have a
[36:12] new life
[36:14] you know oh my past lord i don't want to
[36:16] be that anymore
[36:19] i really want to change and i think the
[36:21] lord is really you know the lord is more
[36:23] more than welcome to change our lives
[36:26] the lord is more than welcome to change
[36:28] our characters
[36:31] you know because he said come come unto
[36:33] me you are weary
[36:35] you know you are thirsty come to me i'll
[36:37] give you free water
[36:41] you say come by gold with no price
[36:46] you know i he has the good things that
[36:48] we need
[36:50] the only thing that we can do is just go
[36:51] to him and express to him and tell him
[36:53] how we feel

[1:00:55] to transpire
[1:00:57] you didn't know what was getting ready
[1:00:59] to take place
[1:01:01] something just came across
[1:01:06] speaking to him

[1:01:09] nothing other than the creator of the
[1:01:11] heaven
[1:01:16] keeps holding me
[1:01:19] and later on that creator said abraham
[1:01:22] is my friend
[1:01:24] abraham emmanuel
[1:01:26] no matter as the years going on and the
[1:01:29] years went on
[1:01:31] that abraham left all the things of the
[1:01:33] world behind
[1:02:32] he came
[1:03:00] and he was getting old
[1:03:03] but he is even though he's getting old

[1:04:20] and the blessings of god come to pass
[1:04:22] all over again

[1:38:08] you would be surprised
[1:38:10] at the number of people in this message
[1:38:19] [Music]
[1:38:24] grace is the unmerited love of favor
[1:38:28] [Music]
[1:38:34] it is something that god
[1:38:37] chose to do for you second question
[1:38:44] and oftentimes we first frustrate a test
[1:38:47] of ourselves the grace of god
[1:38:50] by trying
[1:38:51] to help god do it
[1:38:56] but we must understand
[1:38:58] that grace is free
[1:39:01] i don't know about you but i take mine
[1:39:04] i'll receive mine
[1:39:07] because i know that it's the only way
[1:39:09] that i can be saved
[1:39:22] is that
[1:39:23] which is revealed to you personally
[1:39:29] is that thing that god gives you
[1:39:34] that no man can take away
[1:39:38] hallelujah amen brother branham prays
[1:39:42] in what heareth thou elijah
[1:39:45] 1959
[1:39:47] he said lord
[1:39:49] may our hearts be open tonight
[1:40:07] and let the holy spirit get you listen
[1:40:09] just speak into us your new power the
[1:40:12] things that he would have us to know
[1:40:17] that we might know god okay
[1:40:20] fear god
[1:40:28] for thou knoweth our frail frame
[1:40:32] for thou knoweth
[1:40:34] our frail frame and our make-up
[1:40:40] we would ask that you would forgive
[1:40:43] every sin that we have dead
[1:41:03] trust with thirst to be like the church
[1:41:06] of the living god
[1:41:08] they translated
[1:41:09] granted lord accord
[1:41:11] speak to us now
[1:41:13] as we wait further
[1:41:29] because it fits right into what i want
[1:41:31] to say tonight okay
[1:41:35] it is about character
[1:41:38] it is about god
[1:41:40] and it is also about knowing that god is
[1:41:43] your friend and not your
[1:42:10] and one thing i know about the changes
[1:42:12] that's about to
[1:42:20] [Music]
[1:42:25] is going to make a change occur in you
[1:42:31] whether you like it or not
[1:42:34] hallelujah
[1:42:35] you're going to either get closer to god
[1:42:40] or you're going to give him up who's
[1:42:41] what was that somebody help me tonight
[1:42:43] they didn't want to swear because we
[1:42:45] must realize
[1:42:46] this is a depth of god
[1:42:50] that god has predestinated us too
[1:42:54] [Music]
[1:43:04] that god will not pull you through a
[1:43:06] tube
[1:43:08] [Music]
[1:43:46] that we don't have to make a lot of
[1:43:47] noise
[1:43:50] it's all right if you make it
[1:43:52] because i like noise
[1:43:55] hallelujah
[1:43:56] but i understand sometimes people
[1:43:59] get the wrong interpretation
[1:44:02] resolving
[1:44:31] but the bible tells me that when they
[1:44:34] asked jesus how to pray
[1:44:38] hallelujah one of the things that gets
[1:44:40] me
[1:44:42] let that will be done in earth
[1:45:13] [Music]
[1:45:14] oh
[1:45:24] hallelujah
[1:45:26] maybe some of y'all don't understand
[1:45:49] he said i've had those feelings after
[1:45:52] i've come out of a meeting
[1:45:56] application
[1:46:24] wonders if you visit the scene at the
[1:46:26] beginning and sit in a car on the
[1:46:28] outside a meme ladder and hear them cry
[1:46:32] say hey legion do you say that wasn't
[1:46:34] nothing but psychology
[1:46:38] there is nothing
[1:46:48] then i crawled under that juniper tree
[1:46:51] hello
[1:47:02] [Music]
[1:47:05] but we all hit those experiences
[1:47:11] come on somebody amen we all go through
[1:47:13] those times
[1:47:15] but the mercies of jehovah man
[1:47:18] the mercies of jehovah
[1:47:33] and he knows his servants knees
[1:47:38] so he just put him to sleep
[1:47:43] and while he's laying there
[1:47:46] waiting to recuperate i'll turn down the
[1:47:48] city
[1:48:58] he said
[1:49:12] i've been back in a cave
[1:49:14] long enough
[1:49:20] and you have to
[1:49:22] see to know that there has been a lot of
[1:49:24] earthquakes
[1:49:26] shaking
[1:49:35] what is it
[1:49:36] s-t-e-w-s
[1:49:38] stews
[1:49:44] and big meetings uh
[1:49:47] shows but where has been god
[1:49:50] out of it
[1:49:51] now listen to them with you he said i've
[1:49:54] seen it all i've seen god heal jesus
[1:50:01] where he asked the question
[1:50:03] but where has god been i'll always get
[1:50:06] you out of it
[1:50:13] there's got to come something deeper
[1:50:15] than a healing service
[1:50:18] god becomes something deeper than a gift
[1:50:20] to speak with tongues
[1:50:35] the wind went forth
[1:50:38] but god wasn't in it
[1:50:40] we've had rushing mighty winds
[1:50:43] all over the country
[1:50:46] and sensations
[1:50:48] blood in the face
[1:50:55] [Applause]
[1:50:59] you know what one thing i love about
[1:51:00] brother branham
[1:51:02] he never compared himself in a sense
[1:51:15] he never went out to compare revivals
[1:51:18] with them in
[1:51:32] all the great fuss
[1:51:34] to say shows all the great arguments
[1:51:37] america is guilty of listening to those
[1:51:40] noises
[1:51:44] but god is not in the knowledge
[1:52:04] hallelujah amen don't you see what god
[1:52:06] is doing never he would pass against
[1:52:08] he's trying to get us to focus
[1:52:13] full of confusion
[1:52:27] as they are
[1:52:42] god
[1:52:56] and great
[1:53:05] [Music]
[1:53:18] trying to get something over to us
[1:53:21] at this point has not yet been opened
[1:53:34] [Music]
[1:53:52] when you see so-called christians today
[1:53:57] people that goes to church
[1:53:59] and live their dignified lives
[1:54:02] and go out and deny healing he is
[1:54:21] for books i believe you call it scaffold
[1:54:24] work
[1:54:26] let's say framework again
[1:54:28] all right
[1:54:29] it's a bonus
[1:54:31] it's a bogus it's a fake it's this one
[1:54:34] it's a frame
[1:54:53] y'all get what i'm saying except for one
[1:54:55] person see all of the things that we're
[1:54:57] doing two seconds
[1:54:58] oh god
[1:55:00] more of it
[1:55:02] yeah
[1:55:04] [Music]
[1:55:29] we didn't
[1:55:45] small
[1:55:46] voice
[1:55:50] that's something that puts the cream in
[1:55:52] the life
[1:55:54] hallelujah
[1:55:57] that's something
[1:55:59] that though you speak with tongues of
[1:56:01] men and of the angels memphis
[1:56:03] and have not exactly
[1:56:06] you are nothing that's right
[1:56:10] see we're beyond the church ages
[1:56:14] it was something god said there yeah
[1:56:17] it was lots of framework
[1:56:20] to peel something up because three
[1:56:23] questions y'all better hear what i'm
[1:56:25] saying
[1:56:26] i'm quoting the prophet
[1:56:40] that's
[1:56:48] paul said i'm pressing into that simple
[1:56:51] question
[1:56:53] hallelujah
[1:57:07] what else can god do for you guess get
[1:57:09] your pen
[1:57:10] he's already justified
[1:57:13] hallelujah amen amen and those who he
[1:57:16] said those whom he justified
[1:57:18] he's already glorified
[1:57:20] hallelujah none of us should sit here
[1:57:23] with sad faces
[1:57:31] put on the bride
[1:57:33] hallelujah
[1:57:35] why because she's freezing
[1:57:50] is that
[1:58:18] you and i must understand hallelujah
[1:58:21] he said there's one more thing left now
[1:58:23] yeah yeah i want you to understand the
[1:58:24] shows
[1:58:25] there i would not even be in iowa
[1:58:29] i had not heard that small steel voice
[1:58:32] season of
[1:58:45] and
[1:58:46] i don't mean no harm but i didn't even
[1:58:48] know that there were black people in
[1:58:49] iowa
[1:58:53] iowa i'm telling you the truth
[1:58:56] and for a while my wife and i when we
[1:58:58] first got here we were looking and
[1:58:59] didn't see nothing hey
[1:59:10] [Music]
[1:59:15] okay okay
[1:59:18] hallelujah yeah man
[1:59:20] y'all understand what i'm saying
[1:59:22] what i'm trying to say is sick as you
[1:59:24] said i was born in south
[1:59:29] south carolina and now i'm in
[1:59:31] iowa
[1:59:34] hallelujah
[1:59:35] what got me here was predestination
[1:59:41] oh somebody helped me here
[1:59:56] to conquer this
[2:00:11] and god hey take me to a cave where i
[2:00:14] can find it
[2:00:15] you know what brother says
[2:00:17] he said i don't care take me to a cave
[2:00:19] i mean if i gotta get in a cave
[2:00:38] something that puts the cream in the
[2:00:40] light yeah
[2:00:42] that's something yeah so you speak with
[2:00:45] tons of men and of angels
[2:00:50] you're nothing
[2:00:52] my question is when has when
[2:00:56] how long it's been
[2:00:58] how long has it been
[2:01:01] since god spoke to you the quickest
[2:01:04] dreams about it
[2:01:06] not from the head but from your heart
[2:01:10] the country of zappos
[2:01:12] here
[2:01:13] you said i've never heard his voice dude
[2:01:15] you better get up and go somewhere
[2:01:20] hallelujah
[2:01:35] is because they're dead
[2:01:37] because they speak in tongues
[2:01:38] god is with them
[2:01:42] but brother branham said something
[2:01:43] different
[2:01:45] david hart had david had all the
[2:01:48] pentecostal signs
[2:01:55] see going the church is not good enough
[2:01:58] generally saying that you belong to this
[2:02:01] message is not good enough
