[0:00] is a tree of life to them that lay hold
[0:07] upon her and happy is one that retain it
[0:17] her was that alright let us pray
[0:23] father God we thank you for your mercy
[0:28] and your grace this morning we thank you
[0:32] for being real to us we pray this
[0:36] morning that you your perfect will be
[0:39] done Lord anoint your servant this
[0:44] morning break and destroy the yokes of
[0:49] the enemy and father will be careful to
[0:52] give you the praise the glory in the
[0:55] honor feed your people this morning in
[0:59] Jesus Christ's name we pray amen
[1:10] we like you may be seated we like to
[1:18] give you a subject and we like to say by
[1:27] God's grace that God has already
[1:32] determined what the end of our lives
[1:42] will be he is a God that is perfect and
[1:49] therefore he cannot change his mind
[1:55] our days are numbered as I said the last
[2:00] time when we spoke it doesn't matter how
[2:02] many vitamins you take it doesn't matter
[2:07] how much anti-wrinkle cream you you put
[2:11] on your face because we all have been
[2:17] stricken now I'm not saying anything
[2:20] wrong with the cream I'm just saying no
[2:27] matter what kind of medication you may
[2:32] be involved as far as taking it is not
[2:37] science that prolong your days we know
[2:44] by
[2:45] God's grace that there is a living God
[2:51] you can't thirst after God except God
[2:55] put the thirst in you but the Bellamy
[3:01] verse says sometimes it takes a long
[3:04] time for son and daughter of God to
[3:09] realize that they are sons and daughters
[3:13] of God that's why you find some people
[3:17] who have may have lived about 90 years a
[3:23] sinner but just before they leave
[3:31] salvation is brought to their door you
[3:37] and I determines nothing god is already
[3:40] determinate he has determined the bounds
[3:45] of the ocean and the sea he has
[3:48] determined how far you got to go in this
[3:50] life he is already determined how much
[3:53] you're going to achieve and none of us
[3:57] can supersede what he has already
[4:01] determined you and I ought
[4:05] be glad because God gave us something
[4:11] that the world is looking for he didn't
[4:19] give it to you when you were born in
[4:22] this dimension but he gave it to you
[4:26] before the foundation of the world he
[4:31] planted a seed in you and that seed in
[4:40] itself
[4:41] his brother Jasper said last week has a
[4:43] time and a season it's going to spring
[4:48] forth I like to entitle this message and
[5:00] you'll see where I'm coming from in just
[5:02] a moment at the scent of water sound
[5:09] pretty strange but God liking himself to
[5:16] water water can be a life-giving force
[5:21] as well as a destructive force
[5:31] that is living in this world can live
[5:35] without water water is essential for
[5:44] living naturally and spiritually
[5:50] remember he told the woman at the well I
[5:54] know you're thirsty but you're really
[5:58] thirsting for something that is
[5:59] spiritual and not natural this natural
[6:04] water you're gonna have to come back to
[6:06] this oh well but the spiritual water
[6:09] that I give you will spring up into
[6:12] eternal life and you never thirst again
[6:16] - for a long time we never knew what
[6:20] never thirst again and I wondered what
[6:25] it meant but there is a time in your
[6:27] life as a Christian you are completely
[6:31] filled and when you are completely
[6:35] filled you never thirst again you'll
[6:41] notice a it's like drinking water when
[6:46] you drink water and you are filled up to
[6:48] Minette water you'll never thirst as
[6:52] long as you are filled and so is it with
[6:57] the Spirit of God I love this if I had a
[7:04] subtopic
[7:05] I would basically a subtopic this
[7:12] message planted among the trees because
[7:18] God liken us as trees look at Genesis
[7:23] you'll find that God when he was doing a
[7:27] be creating I'm a read it in just a
[7:30] moment Genesis 2 5 through 9 when he
[7:33] planted the trees he also planted Adam
[7:39] Genesis 2 5 through 9 and
[7:43] plant of the field before it was in the
[7:47] earth in every herb of the field before
[7:50] it grew for the Lord God had not caused
[7:54] it to rain upon the earth and there was
[7:58] not a man to till the ground but there
[8:02] went up a mist from the earth and
[8:05] watered the whole face of the ground and
[8:09] the Lord God formed man of the dust of
[8:14] the earth and breathed into his nostrils
[8:16] the breath of life and man became a
[8:19] living soul he himself was a tree but he
[8:25] was a different kind of tree he was a
[8:29] tree that could talk he was a tree that
[8:32] could walk he was a tree that could clap
[8:35] his hand all right the Lord God planted
[8:40] a garden eastward in Eden and there he
[8:45] put the man whom he had formed and out
[8:51] of the ground made the Lord God to grow
[8:53] every tree that is pleasant to the sight
[8:58] and good for food The Tree of Life also
[9:02] in the midst of the garden and the tree
[9:06] of knowledge of good and evil said what
[9:10] do you mean brothers I'm coming to it
[9:12] understand amen that the tree of life
[9:15] who was it absolutely was Jesus Christ
[9:20] and the tree of the knowledge of good
[9:22] and evil who was it he was Satan
[9:26] but God called them trees Adam was a
[9:31] tree Eve is a tree that right and we are
[9:38] the offspring and the fruit of that tree
[9:44] let me say it
[9:46] in a tree cannot live without water have
[9:53] you ever seen it
[9:55] it's amazing how trees can grow in some
[9:58] of the most strangest places you even
[10:02] find trees in the desert and that tree
[10:08] is designed to find water when no other
[10:14] animal would ever know where is that
[10:17] those roofs are so attracted it is
[10:21] literally drawn to wherever the water
[10:24] may be remember there was no rain all it
[10:32] was was a mist and God used that mist
[10:36] and he grew a beautiful garden see
[10:42] because those trees even knew how to
[10:45] take what was given to them and make
[10:48] life out of it that's in the natural
[10:54] what about the spiritual because you
[10:58] cannot even grow it takes water to
[11:05] literally push fruits out that tree
[11:12] can't produce a fruit without water it
[11:17] can't live without water it can't
[11:19] produce fruit without water
[11:24] hallelujah
[11:26] you said well you mean brother Brooks
[11:28] just bear with me in just a moment even
[11:32] in the scripture we find out that even
[11:34] nature nations are called trees Israel
[11:39] is called the fig tree hello and brother
[11:46] random preached the bride tree you are
[11:51] tree and you must bring forth fruit but
[11:58] you'll never be able to bring forth
[11:59] fruit if water if is not present now I'm
[12:06] speaking spiritual without the Holy
[12:09] Ghost you'll never be able to produce
[12:14] spiritual fruit you and I must realize
[12:21] that even Pharaoh himself was called by
[12:26] God a tree to whom thou thus like in
[12:31] glory and in greatness among the trees
[12:34] of Eden every tree bring forth of his
[12:38] kind you can't be me I can't be you but
[12:45] we all have the same life of God on the
[12:48] inside I hope some of y'all understand
[12:51] me Jesus walked by a tree it was a fig
[12:56] tree and it brought forth no fruit and
[13:02] that fig tree was cursed because it
[13:08] failed his purpose hello brother branham
[13:13] lack in his life he said let the Holy
[13:15] Ghost which is the water of God let it
[13:18] push out let it push out you keep
[13:23] drinking but let it push out and we'll
[13:27] come to church we'll sit here and then
[13:29] we act like we're something on the wall
[13:31] somewhere but the Bible the Bible tells
[13:36] me just at the scent of water it doesn't
[13:42] have to be an outpouring but just at the
[13:46] scent of water I don't want to jump but
[13:51] that tree Birds think about it
[13:59] just little bits of dewdrops we're due
[14:03] to a plan and I wonder what's happening
[14:09] at a time where God is pouring out his
[14:13] spirit well there's the evidence of that
[14:18] spiritual water it's not there to
[14:23] decorate the leaves but is there to
[14:27] penetrate that particular Pratt
[14:30] so that plaid can bring forth fruit so I
[14:33] can live you and I cannot live without
[14:37] the anointing hallelujah it is the
[14:43] anointing that destroys the yokes and as
[14:47] long as we fail to consecrate ourselves
[14:50] and bring us into a position where the
[14:54] anointing can come in we will soon dry
[14:58] up and wither away but all without it
[15:07] you'll never know your purpose you'll
[15:11] never know what you are until the
[15:14] anointing reveals what you are you said
[15:20] what what do you mean brother Brooks
[15:21] remember Aaron's rod Aaron's rod never
[15:26] bought it until it was placed in the
[15:31] Holies of Holies right under the water
[15:36] of God right in the presence of the
[15:38] anointing and once it was placed in
[15:40] there it brought it it bloomed and it
[15:45] brought forth almonds from that rod from
[15:49] that blooming front we now know that
[15:52] that rod was brought from almond tree
[15:58] the identity of that dad rod was now
[16:04] made manifest you said what do you mean
[16:07] brother was that's
[16:09] the Bible said it rains on the just
[16:11] trees it rains on the unjust it rains on
[16:16] the sweet unknown on the weak and it
[16:18] raised on the tail but you don't know
[16:21] what you are you know what the rain is
[16:25] you cry for it because every living
[16:28] creature needs water
[16:30] every living thing needs water
[16:33] but that water only manifest where you
[16:37] came from and where you're going
[16:40] a kind of a real tree what you are is
[16:44] all I want to get better thank God
[16:48] because if you hunger and thirst for
[16:51] righteousness the Bible says you shall
[16:54] be filled
[16:56] hallelujah this is what brother Branham
[16:59] says which was first is he which was
[17:06] first a sinner or a savior a savior for
[17:11] Savior is more powerful than a sin than
[17:15] sin which was first the healer or the
[17:18] sickness
[17:19] it couldn't be a it couldn't be a hill
[17:23] unless he was over the sickness it is a
[17:26] healer he can conquer the secret and
[17:29] faith is the victory that overcomes
[17:32] every curse of the devil
[17:34] faith is a victory faith in what not
[17:39] faith in your church not faith in your
[17:42] greed not faith in some man but faith in
[17:45] Jesus Christ who made the promise that's
[17:49] the victory what is it it is the victory
[17:53] see my almost feel crippled but faith is
[17:58] the victory
[17:59] I still feel sick but faith is the
[18:02] victory
[18:03] oh it's overcomes the world see when you
[18:08] climb when you can climb into God by
[18:11] prayer until you see the fees conquered
[18:14] unto you there is nothing that can hurt
[18:17] you then
[18:20] let me say that again when you can climb
[18:22] into God by prayer until you see the
[18:27] thief conquered under you there is
[18:30] nothing that can hurt you then you
[18:34] overcome you got 50 miles of elbow room
[18:38] you're sailing free then you who have
[18:43] been a drunkard and a slave to whiskey
[18:47] you would be a master over him then that
[18:51] old devil of alcohol that made you drink
[18:54] he's your master now but when you get
[18:58] faith I don't mean make-believe real
[19:01] thing
[19:02] he's your servant then you can lay down
[19:06] tobacco you women and men when it comes
[19:09] to a place to where you can get to that
[19:12] spot to where you have overcome it by
[19:15] faith you're the master then Oh somebody
[19:19] help me because you and I must realize
[19:22] amen what and who we are what tree you
[19:28] from hello what tree are you from you
[19:36] are from the Tree of Life
[19:40] hallelujah let me move on blessed is the
[19:46] man what people don't understand without
[19:48] the nona you never know who you are
[19:50] you'll never know your ability
[19:53] hallelujah let me put it in this way
[19:56] here was said uh-uh-uh
[19:58] David excuse me Samson and we find out
[20:02] that Samson had lost his identity until
[20:08] God had blinded him until God had made
[20:11] him a spectacle amen to the Philistines
[20:15] hallelujah but one day he found out that
[20:19] his anointing had come back see it is
[20:22] that's what about say a carnal mind
[20:24] cannot perceive the things of God
[20:28] ah because when you're born again you're
[20:31] born of another world you
[20:33] from heaven you're born Amen to see
[20:36] things that the natural man can't see
[20:40] blessed is the man that walketh not in
[20:43] the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth
[20:46] in the way of sinners nor sitteth in the
[20:48] seat of the scornful but his delight is
[20:52] in the law of the Lord and his law that
[20:56] he meditate day and night and he shall
[21:00] be like a tree planted by the rivers of
[21:05] waters that means they meant by God's
[21:08] grace he has a strong a place where he
[21:11] can think oh you look at these
[21:13] Christians that a void of joy
[21:15] some of y'all look like y'all comatose
[21:17] this morning y'all just staring I could
[21:20] hardly hear Amen from some of you are
[21:22] you alright hallelujah Amen up from the
[21:28] tree of life when the tree the tree of
[21:31] life is full of joy I'll let you know
[21:36] that's the truth you know anyway let's
[21:38] move on thank you brother I love that
[21:40] move amen
[21:41] he was the only one thank you
[21:44] not the only one but you know me and he
[21:47] shall be like a tree planted by the
[21:50] rivers of water that bringeth forth his
[21:52] fruit in season now come on
[21:56] where are you free where are your fruit
[22:02] like a herd of brother the other day you
[22:05] you you can't pluck up something that
[22:07] has never been planted huh you can't
[22:12] read roots from a tree that doesn't
[22:14] exist
[22:18] y'all know what I'm saying you and I
[22:20] must understand even if you don't search
[22:24] for that water you're gonna die because
[22:31] each and every one of us have been
[22:32] wounded by sin that right that's what
[22:36] David said as the heart painted for the
[22:40] water Brooks show my soul
[22:45] for the living god if you don't have a
[22:49] thirst you better get to God
[22:51] you need the thirst for God hallelujah
[22:55] unless you say I'm filled already if you
[22:57] filled already you know I tell you what
[23:04] I was telling the church the other day
[23:07] doubt in Iowa City I say here it is a
[23:13] great earthquake struck Alaska right by
[23:21] Anchorage right in that area encouraging
[23:24] all and brother branham said and I think
[23:26] was 1962 when the judgement struck the
[23:30] earth
[23:30] it went up that coast and it almost sunk
[23:34] Alaska you know by way of science they
[23:39] said that thought underneath there is
[23:41] locked and loaded and it is going to
[23:46] move see what happened just the other
[23:48] day is not the end of it it's just the
[23:51] beginning it has started our movement
[23:56] and eventually Amen and I really believe
[23:59] sometime soon California is gonna get
[24:03] the big one now if you are not how can I
[24:08] say it if that does not alarm you in a
[24:13] good way a way of Lord let me examine
[24:18] myself let me make sure I am filled and
[24:24] sealed with the Holy Ghost should
[24:29] California go down I'll go up if you're
[24:34] not ready yet when do you think you will
[24:37] be it oughta make you thirsty for more
[24:43] God hallelujah you know I'm not done
[24:48] with Jeremiah I just gave you guys a
[24:50] rest but there in Jeremiah Jeremiah
[24:53] tells about our day it was his day but
[24:57] it's a
[24:57] p-ting where the Christians had become
[25:02] so worried and the Christians had become
[25:06] so onion - to God that no matter what
[25:11] was being preached they wouldn't hear
[25:17] instead of them receiving the Word of
[25:20] God and enjoying the Word of God you
[25:21] know what they did they beat Jeremiah
[25:25] they put him in prison and eventually
[25:29] they killed him
[25:31] hallelujah and we see that even this
[25:35] morning there are those of you who would
[25:37] like you're not connecting you think I
[25:40] don't feel it I do feel it cuz I'm
[25:42] connected to him but let's move on I
[25:46] thought I'll throw that out because
[25:48] there are so many people in this message
[25:50] I want you to look around right now and
[25:53] judge within yourself where and how do
[25:57] we compare to the Pentecostal church on
[26:01] the day of Pentecost no let's go on how
[26:06] do we compare to those who we call
[26:09] shocked
[26:10] in the 1960s and excuse me 50s amen
[26:14] let's call 1906 the Zulu Street revival
[26:17] where do we stand in comparison now we
[26:23] are all saying yes we've got the truth
[26:26] but that ain't just that just not all it
[26:30] it's not truth his life job says and I
[26:39] love Joe because Joe was I like I like
[26:43] Joe because Joe was kind of like a
[26:44] spiritual scientist to me he saw
[26:47] everything out he looked around and he
[26:49] saw the trees he saw this he saw that he
[26:51] saw that everything had a chance to come
[26:53] back but he says oh but man where is man
[26:58] in there you understand me
[27:00] Joe 14 17 17 he said for there is hope
[27:04] of a tree if it be cut down that it was
[27:09] proud again
[27:10] and that the tender branch there uh will
[27:13] not cease so you understand that if you
[27:15] cut a tree down and that cut that tree
[27:17] is connected to some water vein it'll
[27:21] grow again it'll start all over it will
[27:25] not die in a sprout out branches of the
[27:27] sprout I'll leave and then because that
[27:30] water is supplying that tree with life
[27:33] and though the root thereof watch all in
[27:37] the earth and the stop there up die the
[27:39] ground get through the sit of water
[27:43] that's my subject it will bud and break
[27:49] forth bowls like a plant just give me a
[27:54] little bit kind of remind you what the
[27:58] man inhale says let Lazarus come and dip
[28:04] his hand in a little bit of water people
[28:07] he couldn't take that water the hell
[28:09] because water is a symbol of life and
[28:13] Lazarus was dead there's a give me a
[28:16] little bit of water and I have a revival
[28:19] see that's how it is with the tree give
[28:21] me a little bit of water and I have a
[28:23] revival that's why we need the anointing
[28:37] my brother Sam you know I really
[28:38] appreciate you don't owe me now call
[28:40] your name out yes I do because you an
[28:44] example as far as I'm concerned I'm not
[28:49] saying you faultless he goes to school
[28:56] but he finds time to come to church
[29:00] because you know what that's life
[29:04] liar
[29:07] amen we'll always find a place to find
[29:13] water somebody help me here
[29:18] hallelujah the roots will go down in the
[29:21] ground even though the ground may be
[29:23] solid but those roots will penetrate
[29:28] because it smells there's water
[29:32] somewhere is that right that's how it is
[29:35] with a deer hallelujah
[29:37] when a deer is wounded it's like I gotta
[29:39] call attached I gotta find where the
[29:42] water is there's a little bit of water
[29:45] somewhere if I could just have just a
[29:47] little bit I'll know I have a revival oh
[29:54] but the man diet and wasted away yeh man
[30:00] given up the ghost and where is he as
[30:04] the waters fell from the sea and the
[30:06] flood decay it and dry it up so man lie
[30:12] it down and rise it's not to the heavens
[30:16] be no more
[30:17] they shall not awake nor be raised out
[30:20] of their sleep hear what I'm saying
[30:23] listen without the spiritual water there
[30:26] is no awakening have you have a soul
[30:32] seeds all seized do not bud Oh cease
[30:38] don't come up it could be a Pinto be
[30:41] seed but all of them
[30:44] doesn't necessarily have life thing or
[30:47] they don't meet the quad
[30:49] vacations or conditions did you know
[30:53] that even among the pinto beans every
[30:56] one of them are elected and chosen by
[30:58] God God is number the man of pinto beans
[31:09] but he's nothing every tree he knows
[31:13] exactly where you are
[31:16] hallelujah is that right God comes along
[31:19] and you're not making the kind of fruit
[31:21] you're not producing the kind of fruit
[31:22] he wants what does he say he says I'm
[31:24] coming down and I'm gonna be a farmer to
[31:26] you and I'm gonna prune you bad and when
[31:30] God begins to cut off this and cut off

[32:29] season like our brother said everything
[32:32] has a season you got a winner you gotta
[32:33] summon you got a spring you got a fall
[32:35] and every one of us must go through it
[32:39] hallelujah you know I've been told and I
[32:42] don't know how true it is but I've been
[32:43] told that a tree is it is at its
[32:46] original color in the fall but that tree
[32:52] is dying per se the life is leaving the
[33:00] whole of the tree
[33:03] but it's at that time it's most
[33:06] beautiful everybody go from coast to
[33:09] coast here in America up in the
[33:11] mountains down in the valleys to see the
[33:14] trees dying but they're not dad does he
[33:21] so have the appearance of being there
[33:23] that life goes we're down in the root of
[33:28] the tree and every one of us gonna have
[33:32] those moments
[33:33] we're gonna have those times we're gonna
[33:35] have those seasons where look like we
[33:37] don't even have enough strength to
[33:39] praise the Living God
[33:41] hallelujah but this too will pass every
[33:45] season has a number ties and dates and
[33:48] all of a sudden he moves back around
[33:50] from falling and you think old fall is
[33:52] pretty bad all my leaves are gonna and
[33:57] all I look like as a dad tree Emily's
[34:03] coming spring is coming
[34:05] oh come on somebody you know I was
[34:08] telling somebody I was born down in in
[34:11] South Carolina and most of the time you
[34:13] find people down there that's pretty
[34:15] happy and you got a lot of smiles why
[34:17] because we hardly ever have a winter
[34:22] hallelujah but when winter pass from
[34:27] this day when went to pass y'all know
[34:31] what I'm saying right now y'all lookin
[34:33] at me because y'all hate the cold cold
[34:36] brings attitudes it's the truth
[34:40] coal brings attitude coals take away
[34:44] Amen to smiles from the face
[34:47] I'm just waiting to some of y'all down
[34:50] here you know but that's what it does it
[34:53] takes it takes to smile you very seldom
[34:57] see somebody walking through the snow
[35:00] no you got a frown on your face you
[35:03] can't stand the condition and some of us
[35:06] spiritually goes to that you know you
[35:10] cold you know you're not hot oh god but
[35:14] I'm telling you now god has a Danis
[35:17] bring for you even in the springtime
[35:20] the birds sing that the trees they got
[35:25] new leaves and they show off but if they
[35:30] didn't have life if that sound didn't go
[35:38] that wouldn't go down to the to the root
[35:40] of the tree guess what
[35:42] when spring would come there would be no
[35:46] resurrection hallelujah is that okay see
[35:50] I want you understand that unbelief is
[35:52] the perversion of faith you can t
[35:58] believe you can't even go nowhere
[36:00] without believing that you are true son
[36:03] and daughter of God who brought it
[36:07] who brought unbelief there was no such
[36:09] thing as unbelief until Lucifer
[36:12] introduced it to the angels in heaven
[36:17] and daily Lucifer came down and
[36:20] introduced it to E and then he
[36:23] introduced it to us now we fight with
[36:30] the negative and the positive it's
[36:33] something to believe God is that right
[36:36] oh it's true I heard the prophet of God
[36:38] says Amen if faith is Dmitri he said we
[36:41] will have more faith in doctors then we
[36:46] will in God word God said with your His
[36:51] stripes you are healed you know if we
[36:57] really believe that the Prophet God said
[36:58] you'll never come into the prayer line
[37:01] perfect faith don't need a prayer line
[37:05] is not the within until you get there
[37:08] but the point is God wants us to have
[37:11] perfect faith because in order to have
[37:13] perfect faith you must have perfect life
[37:17] even Paul when it came he meant to the
[37:20] Christian or to the spiritual aspect of
[37:22] things he said for we have been planted
[37:25] together in the likeness of his death
[37:29] and I was
[37:30] meditating on then I says Oh Lord
[37:32] there's a lot of suffering in his death
[37:37] hallelujah
[37:38] so you what do you mean you got to
[37:40] understand there was a lot of suffering
[37:41] leading up to his death before he died
[37:44] there was a lot of persecution there was
[37:48] a lot of our rejection hallelujah there
[37:51] was a lot of afflictions and then placed
[37:54] on him before he died
[37:56] hallelujah and you and I must go through
[37:59] the same kind of a thing there will be a
[38:02] lot of friction there'll be a lot of
[38:03] suffering there'll be a lot of things we
[38:07] must go through but are you willing take
[38:13] up your cross and follow me you know I'm
[38:17] trying to get people to the Holy Ghost
[38:18] the real Holy Ghost not just fake thing
[38:21] that is religion and make everybody feel
[38:24] like you got it and you can't even love
[38:26] your brother or love your enemy
[38:29] hallelujah I'm not talking I'm time of
[38:31] the real Holy Ghost I'm not talking
[38:33] about this religious thing that you and
[38:35] I have adopted within ourselves and
[38:37] think that's it but every tree must
[38:41] bring forth of his kind
[38:44] Jesus was the perfect example of what a
[38:48] man should be and what the tree of life
[38:51] is you got to break through the barriers
[38:58] did you know winter is good for some
[39:01] seeds because winter will freeze that
[39:05] seed and that seed a man will eventually
[39:10] explode because of the ice and the
[39:12] moisture in it and when that seed
[39:15] explode it releases life because that
[39:24] seed there's a life in that seed that
[39:27] will break through the barriers
[39:31] hallelujah and you and I must break
[39:33] through the barrier of laodicea did you
[39:37] know that Laodicea is a barrier
[39:41] it will haul you it would keep you it
[39:44] will imprison you and then to slop the
[39:47] nisshin and being dilatory and all of
[39:50] these things it'll make you feel at ease
[39:54] in Zion but you've got to break through
[39:58] this thing you cannot allow oh god don't
[40:03] you understand people that the Lord is
[40:06] soon to come I can't say that enough
[40:09] whether you shout whether you - whether
[40:12] you run up and down this aisle means
[40:15] nothing because what God is looking for
[40:18] is life you think about it even though
[40:28] Jacob I bet he had he was a seed and
[40:31] Jacob had to do what wrath so he had to
[40:35] break through the barrier of all
[40:37] unbelief he had to harass you with the
[40:41] angel
[40:41] he had already the blessing but he
[40:44] wasn't he wasn't he wasn't he wasn't
[40:46] satisfied with being blessed you blessed
[40:49] but that that's nothing to be satisfied
[40:52] with until you see the life of your
[40:56] blessing you must see the Christ in you
[41:00] that's what matters and when that angel
[41:04] came by way of his prayer he said I'm
[41:07] not gonna let you go to you bless me
[41:10] hallelujah
[41:11] like the brothers say God likes to
[41:14] inconvenience you and I'm gonna tell you
[41:16] something now prayer has become an
[41:22] inconvenience to a lot of believe us I
[41:26] don't have time to pray hallelujah I
[41:30] have time for Facebook I have time for
[41:34] the iPad I have time for texting but I
[41:38] don't have time to pray hallelujah
[41:42] exactly right we need to repent your
[41:45] soul is at stake did you know brother
[41:48] brems at that foolish Rogers and the
[41:50] wise version was made out of the same
[41:53] material
[41:55] but the wise version they prayed until
[42:00] they got a while and it's joy
[42:03] somebody help me here she shall be
[42:09] called a tree of life you know that's
[42:11] what he was at the beginning she was a
[42:14] tree of life but when they said the
[42:18] prophet of God said she became the tree
[42:21] of death the tree of good and evil came
[42:25] by way of Eve hallelujah
[42:27] she joined herself to the start but and
[42:30] now she became what the serpent was and
[42:36] she spread her gospel hallelujah
[42:39] oh come on somebody that's what she did
[42:42] everybody or everything every that yoked
[42:46] herself himself to her became what what
[42:50] she was what about Mary at Simon's house
[42:55] see when you won't Jesus when you get
[42:58] just the scent of the water when there's
[43:03] a smell because that lady though she
[43:05] wasn't at the well her name was Mary and
[43:07] she wanted what she wanted life property
[43:12] God said when she got the Simon's house
[43:14] she elbowed her way she knew Jesus was
[43:20] over there somewhere she looked and she
[43:22] saw from a distance and she knew she had
[43:24] to push through the crop why because
[43:28] there was water over there and she was
[43:31] fasting for life hallelujah that woman a
[43:36] man who had the easier blood sick sick
[43:41] had to go to every physician there was
[43:45] wasted all her money she wanted to be
[43:48] healed whoa but Jesus Christ is the real
[43:52] healing spring he is a wily man that can
[43:56] fix it just right for you though that
[43:58] woman was buckled with pain amen she
[44:01] didn't walk like this but she was buckle
[44:04] and to be honest with you to him was the
[44:06] only thing she could reach
[44:09] sometimes a menu buckled because of pain
[44:13] hallelujah but I want you to know that
[44:15] same Jesus still handler he's got a
[44:16] hamster
[44:17] she said if I could just but touch the
[44:20] humorless comet what was it she smelt
[44:24] her way through there was something on
[44:26] the inside that directed I because she
[44:29] was a tree and she reached out and
[44:31] touched it you understand me
[44:35] oh how bad it could be how bad but I
[44:39] want you to know that God is a world a
[44:41] word a water a refreshing is that right
[44:45] because that deal once it was wounded it
[44:49] knew it the only way that I can survive
[44:51] is to make sure I stayed by the river of
[44:55] water if I stayed where water is why
[44:59] because they were healing purchase
[45:01] before
[45:02] hallelujah there's healing righteous in
[45:04] this water no matter how bad the room is
[45:11] that water will make the blood clot if I
[45:15] could just get it with all those
[45:17] minerals in it all those vitamins in it
[45:20] inner inner to work you know why I get a
[45:22] whole it'll keep me alive but it's if I
[45:25] get away from the stream you wound it
[45:28] you heard it you get away from this
[45:30] dream you're getting away from the
[45:33] source of life the thing that can really
[45:36] heal you is in Jesus Christ God don't
[45:41] care no difference between man is that
[45:45] right yeah Lord
[45:47] each one of us says whether we are white
[45:51] brown black or yellow we could transfuse
[45:56] blood to each other and save others life
[45:59] by blood transfusion did you know the
[46:02] greatest illness there is is death death
[46:08] is a sickness it is contagious you're
[46:15] born in it the doctors
[46:20] find a kill anybody got a kill oh come
[46:27] on somebody see that's what I'm saying
[46:29] he Jesus is to kill but God brought the
[46:35] inoculation

[46:40] take the medication you're going to die
[46:45] somebody help me but in one shot of
[46:49] Jesus can make a man who's dead for days
[46:54] get up rotted wood whines all in it but
[47:02] before he died he was inoculated he had
[47:07] Jesus in Jesus and already told him if
[47:11] you drink of this water you'll never
[47:12] thirst again is that right he said I am
[47:17] the Living Waters
[47:20] people say what were you saying

[47:50] hallelujah come on somebody but let me
[47:53] say it like this
[47:55] when it comes to life you and I must
[47:59] know by God's grace except you accept
[48:05] the Lord as your life you cannot live
[48:12] and you know we fail to see why Jesus
[48:15] died Jesus the seed of God had to die
[48:22] had he not died you and I would have
[48:26] never come forth somebody help me
[48:31] that's why even Adam could not leave
[48:35] circumstances the way they were Adam
[48:38] knew he needed e for reproduction though
[48:46] she said I have a word from the Lord
[48:49] that I must bring forth of my kind he
[48:54] couldn't just do it on his own hello
[49:01] that's why you have male and female
[49:04] that's why in God he has is male and
[49:07] female and that Leila female is sat
[49:12] there to produce to bring of its kind
[49:17] all trees are not deciding you must have
[49:22] a male tree and you must have a female
[49:25] tree hello did y'all know that because
[49:30] you got to understand the bees sweet
[49:32] honey bees they know how to transform
[49:35] transport the problem they know how to
[49:38] bring this Germanisation together right
[49:45] and that's what God is doing when God
[49:50] design you he design you as a feminine
[49:52] part of him but you'll never be able to
[49:57] produce your kind until you get with the
[49:59] male you gotta get with Jesus Oh help me
[50:06] Lord job says how many I want to live

[50:30] history hallelujah you must understand
[50:34] he I love being a Christian being
[50:36] a Christian is not easy just like being
[50:40] a tree is not easy and when you are
[50:43] planted
[50:44] the ground as a tree guess what you
[50:48] can't move it doesn't matter how the
[50:53] seasons change you came whoo I look at
[50:58] some of those trees it meant when those
[51:00] snow storms are coming I don't know how
[51:04] do you feel but all I could imagine if
[51:09] that was me standing there and I can't
[51:13] get out of the cold because I'm planted
[51:18] but that cold is important for my growth
[51:23] to come
[51:24] I need that cold just like I need the
[51:28] fall I need it I need those season
[51:31] changes did you know and then even the
[51:35] vegetables need a cold snap they say
[51:39] when they get adjust a little tip a drop
[51:41] in the temperature
[51:42] it makes the vegetables better so wheat
[51:46] that's right brother and so you and I
[51:48] must understand because if you don't get
[51:51] the cold you'll never be sweet you need
[51:57] it every one of these seasons are given
[52:01] to us it meant so that we as a tree can
[52:04] bring forth much fruit hallelujah I
[52:09] don't know what trees say and I don't
[52:11] know tree language one of these days I
[52:14] will because Jesus spoke to a tree and
[52:20] he says you can too
[52:22] he said if you say to this tree be that
[52:25] plucked up and move over yonder he said
[52:26] that tree must obey you so ever did the

[53:30] born again of God you have the same
[53:33] abilities hello somebody did you not
[53:37] know that when the straw was raining and
[53:40] the sea was beating against the ship ah

[55:01] to even create
[55:04] is that right he's all when the screams
[55:07] come I don't know what I'm gonna do
[55:09] I tell you what what Jesus did and it
[55:12] wasn't even a squeeze his disciple says
[55:15] rod we have toiled all day and we don't
[55:18] have no fish Jesus said cast your net on
[55:22] the other side all my life he said
[55:31] didn't L say cast it where did those
[55:34] fish come from those disciples had
[55:37] already proved that they weren't there
[55:39] but the ability of creation is in the
[55:43] mouth of the believer Oh somebody help
[55:48] me here is this okay the Bible said the
[55:53] law of the Lord is perfect converting
[55:56] the soul the testimony of the Lord is
[55:59] sure making wise the simple the statue
[56:03] of the Lord are right rejoicing the
[56:05] heart the commandment of the Lord is
[56:07] pure enlightening the fear the Lord is
[56:11] clean enduring forever the judgment of
[56:14] the Lord are true and righteous
[56:15] altogether more to be desired are they
[56:19] than gold real water real nourishment
[56:25] which would you prefer a mansion you can
[56:32] have all the mansions you want on this
[56:34] earth it ain't up at a dump anyhow
[56:37] hallelujah every mansion in this earth
[56:40] is a dump
[56:42] compared to the one God has prepared for
[56:44] you ooh
[56:48] well I spit all our time and our energy
[56:51] trying to establish something here
[56:53] instead of excavating our souls in God
[56:57] huh
[56:59] the Bible said that those trees that
[57:02] didn't have no root they perished but
[57:06] the seed that had root I take it all the
[57:09] way back to God because my root is in
[57:11] God Jesus is the root and offspring of
[57:14] David I take it all the way back to God
[57:16] that's why I can
[57:18] today because my root is in God and that
[57:24] root is like a tree planted by the
[57:28] rivers of water is that right
[57:30] oh lord help us Jesus just give me a
[57:36] little something as that song saying to
[57:42] hold on to give me something and you
[57:47] know what when it comes to God God is
[57:49] willing to give it but he must first
[57:52] inconvenience you hello
[57:55] think about the gold rush that's what
[57:57] the Bible says right the Bible says amen
[58:00] ah that in that day the gold rush people
[58:04] was travelling afar off facing all kinds
[58:07] of unseen danger because in their minds
[58:10] they had that vision that they were
[58:13] going to strike gold
[58:15] once they used to come in the church if
[58:17] you're not coming looking for gold and
[58:21] the Bible said that the Word of God is
[58:24] more precious thing going that gold can
[58:28] purchase anything you want seek ye first
[58:32] the kingdom of God and His righteousness
[58:33] and God would at all these things to you
[58:39] is that right you and I must realize
[58:42] that if you seek God and get his
[58:45] righteousness everything else will be
[58:49] added what we need now is what Jesus did
[58:58] Jesus was such a fountain of life even
[59:03] his spit was a cure he told that by man
[59:09] he said how many God will let somebody
[59:12] else do that to you what am I brought a
[59:13] little bit of mud up in here a little
[59:15] bit of dirt and spit innings and mix it
[59:16] as they come and let me anoint you can
[59:23] you imagine what that blind man was
[59:25] thinking we need her
[59:31] no doubt the devil says Oh him/her what
[59:36] did he just do what did he just do some
[59:48] of you would have said I'm out of here
[59:52] but Jesus you know blind people have a
[59:57] good hearing he could even hear him
[1:00:00] mixing it what are you gonna do with
[1:00:04] that you know what but he was desperate
[1:00:08] would you when you're desperate you
[1:00:10] don't care about the inconvenience when
[1:00:12] you test but you don't care what God
[1:00:13] does what would do to make it right he
[1:00:18] was definite I want to see and Jesus
[1:00:21] took that spin on that clay and just
[1:00:22] press it into his eyes think about it
[1:00:25] people of God hallelujah
[1:00:28] he said now you go wash in the pool of
[1:00:32] Siloam there and the Bible says that man
[1:00:35] went and washed came back seeing one
[1:00:41] place he said he came back seeing seeing
[1:00:43] me and less trees and so when quite
[1:00:45] right Jesus did it again for watching
[1:00:49] get to the second wheel it is amazing
[1:00:55] how when you're desperate you don't care
[1:00:58] when the voice speaks when the Tree of
[1:01:01] Life speaks to you Amen you're not
[1:01:04] you're not gonna do like naman all right
[1:01:06] why do you want me to dip in the Jordan
[1:01:09] there's so many rivers out here that's
[1:01:10] much more cleaner and that little wise
[1:01:15] servant say yeah but your leopard you
[1:01:21] bout as dirty as that River hallelujah
[1:01:23] you might as well what harm is it gonna
[1:01:26] do you to go dip seven times like he's
[1:01:28] saying right but see when you really
[1:01:32] want God you do whatever the words say
[1:01:35] if you really the tree if there's a
[1:01:37] ceiling you
[1:01:39] that seed would say just at the scent of
[1:01:42] water just at the scent of life I'll
[1:01:48] spring forth you love the Lord now we
[1:01:51] come to a time I'm about ready to close
[1:01:56] there are so many people I say it like
[1:01:58] this the Prophet God's let's put it this
[1:02:06] way
[1:02:07] I heard him just the other day he said
[1:02:09] God told him just to stand on the corner
[1:02:11] stand in this place and and he was going
[1:02:14] to come by brother Ram said I had stood
[1:02:16] there a long time you know how we are
[1:02:19] God's say just go somewhere sit there
[1:02:22] stand there and I'll be there he never
[1:02:24] tells you at what time but you want to
[1:02:27] see how how long you gonna wait come on
[1:02:31] inconvenience when he says listen I know
[1:02:33] this is your plane you got a catch but
[1:02:35] you keep walking I think about that all
[1:02:38] the time because I catch planes and I
[1:02:42] just wonder sometimes what would I had
[1:02:45] done hopefully I would have followed the
[1:02:49] voice like he did and he didn't tell him
[1:02:53] you know it didn't sound like brother
[1:02:55] bang just went here to there he had a
[1:02:57] walk keep on walking
[1:03:01] keep on walking like God tell you when
[1:03:04] you in prayer keep on praying keep on
[1:03:08] praying well I don't create an hour and
[1:03:11] that's enough keep on praying I don't
[1:03:16] pray to another hour that's enough keep
[1:03:18] on praying
[1:03:20] where should I stop praying like Jacob
[1:03:28] when the daybreak
[1:03:32] just before the daybreak that's when he
[1:03:35] got his victory he prayed all night
[1:03:40] he wrestled all night that's what
[1:03:42] happens sometimes you're not a so we're
[1:03:44] a through it unbelief we're a so tired
[1:03:47] we're a sewage sick asleep we're a sir
[1:03:50] with thoughts but you keep rascally God
[1:03:54] I ain't going nowhere till you give me
[1:03:58] that Holy Ghost I ain't going nowhere
[1:04:01] until I see that I'm healed I'm not
[1:04:04] going nowhere till I see that I'm
[1:04:06] delivered does make sense what kind of
[1:04:13] tree are you the Bible said bitter and
[1:04:17] sweet water King come out the same
[1:04:19] fountain you can't be holy and unholy is
[1:04:27] that all right Yuma I must
[1:04:33] stand by God's grace if you don't stay
[1:04:38] by the water
[1:04:42] you're wither and die
[1:04:47] that's why Satan has us all bound up for
[1:04:52] the traditions and thinking of salvation
[1:04:58] say brother but you shouldn't say it
[1:05:00] like that well somebody got to say it
[1:05:04] oh come on folks I'm not directing this
[1:05:08] at anybody particular I'm talking to the
[1:05:10] whole church unanimous I'm talking to me
[1:05:16] if I get to a place where I can't feel
[1:05:19] his presence just a little bit
[1:05:24] something's wrong
[1:05:26] there's been a breach something is going
[1:05:28] wrong somewhere if I get down in prayer
[1:05:31] and I don't ever make a connection
[1:05:33] something's wrong
[1:05:35] because I've been told that Jesus keeps
[1:05:38] all his appointments but God can come
[1:05:42] down and prove its present to you if
[1:05:44] you're not right in your heart and you
[1:05:46] know what I'm saying I'm talking to us
[1:05:49] now we're living in a time with God is
[1:05:52] soon to come what if this earth starts
[1:05:54] shaking here in Des Moines what would be
[1:05:57] your first thought what would be your
[1:06:00] first thought Oh Lord I'm gonna die and
[1:06:02] if that be the truth where are you going
[1:06:05] where do you think you're going if your
[1:06:08] life is not holy everybody here ought to
[1:06:12] examine yourself I examine myself every
[1:06:14] day I've lived a Christian life for a
[1:06:18] long time I know what religion is and
[1:06:19] I'm not interested the only thing I want
[1:06:22] to see is Jesus in me you love the Lord
[1:06:27] when it gets to the place where reading
[1:06:30] your Bible is boring you are in trouble
[1:06:33] they are hidden David said how sweet are
[1:06:40] their words unto my taste when it gets
[1:06:43] to the place that the word of God is not
[1:06:45] sweet to you
[1:06:47] what brother Bergson ain't never been
[1:06:48] sweet where you have never gotten it you
[1:06:50] never eaten it because this word when
[1:06:53] it's you eat it is sweet yeah I love it
[1:06:56] you ever need a word from God and all of
[1:06:59] a sudden something come up on the pages
[1:07:00] uh-oh
[1:07:01] boom that brother know what I'm talking
[1:07:04] about right somehow you can sometimes
[1:07:07] taste it when the preachers preach and
[1:07:10] all of a sudden he hears something and
[1:07:12] that revelation strikes you it seemed
[1:07:14] like it even goes into your mouth am I
[1:07:17] the only one with that experience it's
[1:07:19] sweet
[1:07:22] let's tan
[1:07:44] at the end of the day at the Covenant
[1:07:54] coming of the season we're all fruit
[1:07:56] trees bear fruit some lemons some limes
[1:08:02] some apples some oranges it's going to
[1:08:10] bear whatever is it do you understand me
[1:08:14] whatever verse in you will bear will
[1:08:17] manifest itself that's why it's so
[1:08:22] important that we don't let the season
[1:08:26] pass us by
[1:08:28] can you imagine what it's going to be
[1:08:31] like at the end of the day when the
[1:08:34] rapture is already taking place some of
[1:08:38] us sit in our corners
[1:08:40] some of us wishing that we had done
[1:08:42] better
[1:08:43] some of us wishing that we have prayed
[1:08:47] how you gonna hear the voice of God and
[1:08:49] you don't have prayer life hello how are
[1:08:54] you going to hear the voice let me say
[1:08:56] it like this did you realize Amen that

[1:10:08] I called the spirit of time this period
[1:10:12] of time the hour of temptation and is no
[1:10:15] time to sleep but you know what he said
