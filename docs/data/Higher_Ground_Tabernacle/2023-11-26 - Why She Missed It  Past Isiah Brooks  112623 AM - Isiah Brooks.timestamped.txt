[53:58] match nothing compares to this

[54:08] preach but we'll ask him to come
[54:14] up ask the pastor to come
[54:18] for
[54:22] amen I don't know where he's um
[54:28] sister
[54:33] [Music]
[54:45] Ruby we are doing something that we
[54:47] haven't done
[54:51] before so we'll ask the pastor to come
[54:53] and stand
[54:55] in front of the church and his wife
[54:58] sister Ruby please come in front of the
[55:07] church how many love our
[55:09] [Music]
[55:13] pastor
[55:15] amen I'll read a scripture in Jeremiah 3
[55:19] Jeremiah
[55:21] 3:15 if you can put it on
[55:24] the
[55:25] it's on the slide so you can read
[55:29] together Jeremiah 3:15 says and I will
[55:33] give you pastors I think I'll need an
[55:39] interpreter brother Frank you can help
[55:42] interpret
[55:45] [Music]
[55:51] please Bible says and I will give you
[55:53] pastes according to Mine Heart heart we
[55:56] shall feed you with knowledge and
[55:59] [Music]
[56:12] understanding amen and we have no
[56:15] doubt that our pastor is god-given
[56:21] [Music]
[56:26] amen and we know the month of October
[56:29] was a pastor appreciation
[56:30] [Music]
[56:33] month amen but we we can appreciate our
[56:36] pastor at any
[56:38] time because he's always there available
[56:41] for USS
[56:44] 24/7 Sunday to
[56:47] Sunday amen also want to read a quote of
[56:50] what the prophet
[56:53] says in a Christ The Mystery of God
[56:57] revealed paragraph
[57:00] 81 if you can show it on the slide
[57:07] please he didn't know I was going to do
[57:11] this so please pray for me I might get
[57:13] in
[57:14] trouble for doing this without the
[57:17] pastor's
[57:19] permission the prophet says and stay
[57:21] with your
[57:23] pastor
[57:26] see he's the
[57:29] shepherd and you give him
[57:34] respect he'll lead you
[57:38] through not because he he just feels
[57:41] like
[57:44] it or for any other
[57:48] reason but because he is ordained of God
[57:51] to do
[57:53] so so God gave us our
[57:57] pastor from his own
[58:00] heart and he ordained him to lead us
[58:06] through at some point in time the
[58:09] prophet says he's a he's a burden
[58:13] Bearer throughout the year January
[58:15] through
[58:17] December you do not know what he's going
[58:19] through he's carrying all of your
[58:23] burdens
[58:26] when you have that burden he's feeling
[58:27] it for you
[58:30] too so you you have your burdens
[58:34] alone and they're troubling
[58:37] you but imagine him carrying everyone's
[58:42] burdens and his own burdens
[58:45] too amen that takes A God Called
[58:50] man God ordained man that's why the
[58:54] prophet says give you
[58:58] respect and you
[59:01] through amen so Pastor Isaiah Brooks and
[59:04] sister
[59:05] Ruby is Brooks sister Ruby with the
[59:08] church is higher ground Tabernacle we
[59:10] want to say we appreciate
[59:13] [Applause]
[59:17] [Music]
[59:22] you amen I understand uh a few members
[59:27] of the
[59:29] church you might have shown your
[59:31] appreciation to him uh
[59:35] individually multiple times I believe
[59:38] that but we have never uh given them an
[59:42] appreciation as a
[59:46] church so we thought it necessary to
[59:49] give them an appreciation as a the whole
[59:51] church
[59:53] together
[59:56] so I know a lot of people in the church
[59:58] contributed some
[1:00:01] money so we can just get small
[1:00:05] tokens to to give it to
[1:00:09] them and know we cannot attach monetary
[1:00:12] value to how much we appreciate
[1:00:15] them or how much or to equate it to how
[1:00:19] much he cares for this
[1:00:21] [Music]
[1:00:23] church but but Pastor will say please
[1:00:27] our talking of
[1:00:30] appreciation when you look at
[1:00:33] it look at it as a symbol or a talking
[1:00:36] that Higher Ground T appreciates
[1:00:39] [Music]
[1:00:42] you amen so as um the the small gifts
[1:00:47] that we got
[1:00:51] them to be brought and handed to them
[1:00:56] [Music]
[1:00:58] as a show of
[1:01:00] [Music]
[1:01:11] appreciation can somebody take a picture
[1:01:23] please
[1:01:32] and when I say the
[1:01:35] pastor the prophet says when God calls a
[1:01:39] man he calls his wife
[1:01:42] too so when he's carrying all those
[1:01:46] burdens she's also caring it
[1:01:49] too and she's supporting when he is
[1:01:53] tired
[1:01:56] she's there for
[1:01:58] him and not for him only alone but for
[1:02:01] she's there for
[1:02:04] us
[1:02:06] amen so that's all we had to say we love
[1:02:10] you we appreciate
[1:02:11] you
[1:02:20] amen that's all I had to say and this
[1:02:23] just does not end
[1:02:25] here if you feel like you want to do
[1:02:27] something for them please go
[1:02:30] ahead
[1:02:32] Hallelujah so let's stand upon our
[1:02:35] feet as we invite P

[1:06:41] perfect but I'm going to be incorrect
[1:06:43] this
[1:06:45] morning uh this could not have come at a

[1:07:58] you I've been trying to arrange
[1:08:02] things so that I could be here more
[1:08:07] often and God has made a
[1:08:11] way I contacted a brother a
[1:08:16] pastor that believes in the Holy
[1:08:20] Spirit and I'm waiting on him to return
[1:08:25] uh on whether he'd be able to come or
[1:08:29] not but I invited
[1:08:32] him so that we could have at least four
[1:08:35] days of
[1:08:39] meetings definitely uh just dwelling on
[1:08:41] the holy
[1:08:43] spirit so that those of us who do not
[1:08:48] have may
[1:08:51] receive and those who want
[1:08:54] a
[1:08:57] refilling may

[1:11:51] verse and from there we go to to Matthew
[1:11:57] 25 I I preached a portion of this
[1:12:00] message in Iowa

[1:12:24] beginning at the seventh
[1:12:27] verse let us be glad and
[1:12:31] rejoice and give honor to him for the
[1:12:34] marriage of the Lamb is come and his
[1:12:37] wife hath made herself
[1:12:45] ready and to her was granted that she
[1:12:48] should be arrayed in fine linen clean
[1:12:51] and white for the fine Ling is the
[1:12:54] righteousness of the
[1:13:01] Saints and he said unto me right blessed
[1:13:05] are they which are called unto the
[1:13:07] marriage supper of the lamb and he sath
[1:13:10] unto me these are the true sayings of
[1:13:22] God
[1:13:24] and I fell at his feet to worship him
[1:13:26] and he said unto me see thou doth it not
[1:13:30] I am the F thy fellow servant and of th
[1:13:33] Brethren that have the testimony of
[1:13:35] Jesus worship God for the testimony of
[1:13:39] Jesus is the spirit of
[1:13:52] Prophecy
[1:13:55] Matthew
[1:13:57] 25 we'll read the first 10
[1:14:10] verses then shall the Kingdom of Heaven
[1:14:13] be likened unto 10 virgins which took
[1:14:16] their lamps went forth to meet the
[1:14:22] bridegroom
[1:14:27] and five of them were wise and five were
[1:14:33] foolish they that were foolish took
[1:14:35] their lamps and took no oil with
[1:14:40] them but the wise took oil in their
[1:14:43] vessels with their
[1:14:47] lamps and while the bridegroom carried
[1:14:50] they all slumbered and
[1:14:52] slept
[1:14:55] and at midnight there was a was a cry
[1:14:57] made behold the bridegroom cometh go ye
[1:15:00] out to meet
[1:15:04] him then all those virgins arosed and
[1:15:07] trimmed their
[1:15:11] lamps and the foolish said unto the wise
[1:15:14] give us of your oil for our lamps are G
[1:15:22] out
[1:15:27] but the wise answered saying not so lest
[1:15:30] they're not uh enough for us and you but
[1:15:34] go ye rather to them that sell and buy
[1:15:37] for yourself
[1:15:43] [Music]
[1:15:45] this and while they went to buy the
[1:15:48] bridegroom came and they that were ready
[1:15:51] went in with him to the the marriage and
[1:15:54] the door was
[1:16:02] shut now and then at the time I'm sorry
[1:16:06] I'm sorry read something else let us
[1:16:08] pray father God we come before you Lord
[1:16:11] as humbly as we know how Lord we thank
[1:16:14] you for your grace we thank you for your
[1:16:17] mercy Lord because of your grace and
[1:16:20] mercy we are able to stand behind behind
[1:16:23] this pull pit
[1:16:24] Lord it is not our righteousness that
[1:16:27] you look at but it's the righteousness
[1:16:30] of your dear son Jesus Christ that you
[1:16:33] have covered us
[1:16:34] with and we're so thankful father for
[1:16:38] those who are here this morning we thank
[1:16:41] you God for all that you do and I pray
[1:16:44] this morning that you look beyond all of
[1:16:46] our
[1:16:47] faults and see our needs this morning
[1:16:51] may the May the word of God find good
[1:16:54] hearts Lord hope that it may bring forth
[1:16:58] a hund
[1:16:59] fold of your word in this last day we
[1:17:03] thank you Jesus
[1:17:06] Christ your
[1:17:08] ways are Beyond pass beyond finding
[1:17:13] out but I thank you for your loving
[1:17:16] kindness in Jesus Christ's name we
[1:17:20] pray amen amen you may be
[1:17:27] SE this message
[1:17:32] was an
[1:17:36] inspiration uh brought to me by uh a
[1:17:39] quote that I read that brother brandham
[1:17:43] said and I I'll bring out that quote uh
[1:17:47] uh in the
[1:17:50] message because I really believe
[1:17:54] uh that we're we're right at a
[1:17:57] period where where the door will be
[1:18:02] shut uh there will be those that will be
[1:18:05] locked
[1:18:07] out but then we are also in that
[1:18:11] period brother brandham
[1:18:14] said that the Bride made herself
[1:18:19] ready so I entitled this message
[1:18:24] why she missed
[1:18:28] it we're not talking about the bride
[1:18:31] now we are talking about that other
[1:18:35] five that heard the Midnight
[1:18:39] Cry and they fail to keep oil in their
[1:18:46] lamps remember even in the
[1:18:49] text they all slumbered and slept
[1:18:54] am the wise
[1:18:57] slumbered the foolish slumbered they
[1:19:01] slept but they all heard the
[1:19:07] cry Hallelujah I
[1:19:10] believe that the word of God is
[1:19:13] requiring from
[1:19:15] us what we call rapturing
[1:19:20] Faith and rapturing faith
[1:19:24] is a faith that does not
[1:19:27] waver it cannot
[1:19:30] waver it is what brother Brandon called
[1:19:33] an undisturbed
[1:19:36] faith and I believe that the bride will
[1:19:39] be
[1:19:41] tested so that she may see where she
[1:19:45] stands we talk about the
[1:19:49] Supernatural and brother brandham tells
[1:19:51] us that when that squeeze comes
[1:19:54] we will see the bride in her full
[1:19:59] color because she said the church is is
[1:20:03] at its
[1:20:05] best when she is under
[1:20:09] pressure and I'm not talking about just
[1:20:11] Financial
[1:20:13] pressure I'm talking about pressure
[1:20:16] concerning your
[1:20:18] faith Hallelujah you're going to be
[1:20:21] challenged
[1:20:24] and I trust by the grace of
[1:20:26] God that you will be well
[1:20:30] prepared for this oncoming
[1:20:35] storm Hallelujah ain't God
[1:20:38] good amen what we need to do this
[1:20:43] morning I believe it's uh examining
[1:20:47] ourselves I'm not here to condemn
[1:20:50] anyone but I am definitely here
[1:20:53] here to make you
[1:20:55] think to make you look deep
[1:20:59] inside to make you shine the light on
[1:21:02] your
[1:21:03] soul to see whether you be in the faith
[1:21:07] of the Lord Jesus
[1:21:09] Christ Hallelujah coming from the
[1:21:12] message marriage of the
[1:21:14] Lamb paragraph
[1:21:18] 54 brother Adam say it's like this so
[1:21:22] many
[1:21:23] say if the Lord will take this evil
[1:21:26] spirit from me from drinking and from
[1:21:32] gambling or from
[1:21:34] lying or stealing I'll serve him but
[1:21:39] that's up to you see you've got to do
[1:21:43] something
[1:21:45] too they that overcome shall inherit all
[1:21:50] things they that overcome
[1:21:53] and you have to you have power to do
[1:21:57] it but you must be willing to lay it
[1:22:01] [Music]
[1:22:02] down Hallelujah see she has made herself
[1:22:09] ready I like
[1:22:11] that you
[1:22:12] see God could not push us through a
[1:22:16] little
[1:22:19] Pip and pull us on the other other end
[1:22:23] and then then saying blessed is he that
[1:22:27] overcometh you had nothing to
[1:22:30] overcome he's just pushed you
[1:22:33] through but you've got to make a
[1:22:36] decision for
[1:22:38] yourself I have to make a decision for
[1:22:41] myself and in doing that we shall show
[1:22:44] our faith and respect to
[1:22:46] [Applause]
[1:22:48] God Abraham was promised a child AB
[1:22:53] but he must maintain This Promise for 25
[1:22:59] years the up and the
[1:23:01] Downs that he had in
[1:23:04] Temptations in those 25
[1:23:07] years but he held to the Word of
[1:23:11] Promise my question are you
[1:23:14] holding to the Word of Promise maybe you
[1:23:18] don't see your
[1:23:20] Perfection when you're looking in the
[1:23:22] mirror you don't see the
[1:23:24] Perfection Hallelujah but it is not your
[1:23:28] face that you're supposed to be
[1:23:31] seeing when you look in the word of God
[1:23:35] you are looking to see the character of
[1:23:38] Christ be in
[1:23:40] you
[1:23:42] hallelujah how how far have I
[1:23:46] traveled uh in this
[1:23:48] journey and am I the
[1:23:51] same am I I the same as I was 10 years
[1:23:55] ago 5 years ago three years ago we know
[1:24:00] as the coming of the Lord
[1:24:03] approaches sin becomes
[1:24:06] magnified Hallelujah but you should
[1:24:09] become closer to God hallelujah I don't
[1:24:13] know about you but my
[1:24:16] desire is to walk with God as inner walk
[1:24:21] with God
[1:24:23] Hallelujah see Israel had to fight and
[1:24:28] and I think a lot of times we fail to
[1:24:32] see we got we have to
[1:24:35] fight fight it's a everyday fight
[1:24:40] Hallelujah and every day you might win
[1:24:45] some you you going to lose some but
[1:24:48] that's in your life but in the mind of
[1:24:51] God
[1:24:53] you never have you never lost a
[1:24:56] battle
[1:24:57] Hallelujah because in his mind we stand
[1:25:02] perfect I love him for that because he's
[1:25:06] not going to give up on you he's not
[1:25:09] going to give up on me Perfection is who
[1:25:12] he is hallelujah not he puts us to the
[1:25:19] test even as the prophet of God said
[1:25:22] this is the most evil
[1:25:24] Agee of all the
[1:25:27] ages but he chose
[1:25:30] you cuz he
[1:25:32] knows no matter how evil it is the light
[1:25:37] that he places within
[1:25:39] you will always cast out the
[1:25:43] darkness Israel had to fight for the
[1:25:46] land that was promised to her matter
[1:25:50] fact the Bible say says wherever you
[1:25:54] place your
[1:25:55] feet claim it possess it
[1:26:00] Hallelujah because it's yours Hallelujah
[1:26:04] now the thing that I want to
[1:26:06] say is that when you know God has given
[1:26:09] you
[1:26:12] something and Satan comes to take it
[1:26:16] away God has
[1:26:18] purposely placed you in the
[1:26:21] battlefield
[1:26:24] you don't you just don't throw up your
[1:26:26] hand well it must be the Lord's
[1:26:29] will no it's the Lord's will for you to
[1:26:33] keep that which he's given to
[1:26:38] you Hallelujah and when you've done all
[1:26:41] to stand the Bible
[1:26:43] says you
[1:26:46] stand is that right because the battle
[1:26:49] is not
[1:26:50] yours the ble is the
[1:26:54] Lord
[1:26:57] hallelujah Hebrews
[1:27:00] 12 one and
[1:27:04] two she she missed
[1:27:08] it why did she
[1:27:12] miss now we could say it happens that's
[1:27:16] what's
[1:27:18] happening
[1:27:21] Hallelujah uh the scripture goes on to
[1:27:25] say wherefore seeing we also are
[1:27:29] compassed about with so great a cloud of
[1:27:32] witnesses let us lay aside every
[1:27:36] weight and let us run with patience the
[1:27:40] race that is set before us his
[1:27:45] name on you that's
[1:27:49] God accepting you
[1:27:52] but we have
[1:27:55] problems accepting God's
[1:27:58] decision concerning
[1:28:00] us hallelujah you know I was born a
[1:28:09] Brooks my blood
[1:28:12] DNA
[1:28:14] declares that my father is my
[1:28:17] father and no matter how I try to deny
[1:28:21] him
[1:28:24] it doesn't make any difference because
[1:28:28] my blood gives me
[1:28:31] away my DNA tells me who I
[1:28:35] am Hallelujah I was telling one
[1:28:39] relative uh saying uh to this
[1:28:43] individual uh because his daddy is a a
[1:28:45] real what we would consider well he's
[1:28:48] he's he's a sinner as
[1:28:51] yet and and and we were telling us uh
[1:28:55] that my the young man that he he he
[1:28:58] doesn't have to be like his
[1:29:01] daddy and he said well well what else
[1:29:03] I'm going to be I'm a
[1:29:06] son Hallelujah but if your daddy is a
[1:29:10] murderer doesn't mean you have to be a
[1:29:13] murderer see when it comes to Jesus
[1:29:16] Christ God don't care what your daddy or
[1:29:19] your mama was or even
[1:29:23] Hallelujah he's come to give you a birth
[1:29:26] something that's going to change you
[1:29:29] mean really go into your DNA and change
[1:29:33] your DNA from
[1:29:35] being your daddy's DNA into the DNA of
[1:29:39] Jesus
[1:29:40] Christ now how many of us believe that
[1:29:43] brother Bram said it like this when you
[1:29:46] receive the Holy Ghost God gives you a
[1:29:49] blood
[1:29:50] transfusion
[1:29:52] and I believe that I don't care what my
[1:29:55] daddy was or is hallelujah my Earthly
[1:30:00] father has nothing to do with me
[1:30:04] now y'all understand what I'm trying to
[1:30:10] say maybe before I got born
[1:30:13] again I had my daddy's
[1:30:16] habits but when I get born again my
[1:30:20] daddy's habits must
[1:30:23] go Hallelujah is that right if my daddy
[1:30:27] was a
[1:30:29] liar that I I'm no
[1:30:32] longer
[1:30:34] dictated by his
[1:30:36] genes or his
[1:30:38] DNA Hallelujah I am now
[1:30:42] controlled by the DNA of Jesus Christ
[1:30:46] himself Hallelujah and the word of God
[1:30:50] declar what ever Jesus
[1:30:53] is we are in this
[1:30:56] world Hallelujah I'll stay with the
[1:30:59] word I'll believe the word I'll act upon
[1:31:03] the word see that was one of the
[1:31:07] reasons she missed
[1:31:10] it she didn't have that
[1:31:13] Revelation that she
[1:31:15] needed to go all the
[1:31:18] way and that Revelation only comes
[1:31:22] by the Holy Ghost embodying
[1:31:25] you because the Bible says hallelujah
[1:31:30] that the Holy Ghost will lead you and
[1:31:33] guide you into all truth all
[1:31:42] truth I don't know about
[1:31:48] you but I'm still
[1:31:50] feasting
[1:31:52] on that message brother Cooper
[1:31:56] brought Hallelujah it was made so
[1:32:01] plain in the
[1:32:04] scriptures of who we
[1:32:07] are it gave me a complete
[1:32:10] picture or
[1:32:13] image of who I am to
[1:32:16] be and I'm not going to back off of
[1:32:20] that goes on to say in the second verse
[1:32:23] of this Hebrew
[1:32:25] chapter looking unto Jesus the author
[1:32:29] and finisher of our faith who for the
[1:32:33] joy that was set before him endured the
[1:32:36] cross despising the shame and is sat
[1:32:40] down at the right hand of the Throne of
[1:32:44] God
[1:32:50] hallelujah
[1:32:55] you understand what he said the joy that
[1:32:57] was
[1:32:58] set before him he
[1:33:02] understood what his
[1:33:05] crucifixion would mean to the world he
[1:33:09] understood what his sufferings was going
[1:33:13] to bring to the world he understood the
[1:33:17] effect of his dying he understood the
[1:33:20] effect of his re uh
[1:33:23] resurrection and he knew that he was the
[1:33:26] first born of the Brethren Hallelujah he
[1:33:31] understood amen that he was the
[1:33:33] beginning of God's creation and he
[1:33:36] understood that you and I was going to
[1:33:39] come after him Hallelujah had Jesus
[1:33:44] failed we would have
[1:33:47] failed hallelujah our victory it's not
[1:33:51] in our carnal being it's not what we do
[1:33:56] it's what he has done for
[1:33:58] us
[1:34:00] hallelujah there is no failure in
[1:34:04] God I was talking to a friend of mine
[1:34:07] from South
[1:34:08] Carolina and and she was
[1:34:11] testifying of how she met some of the
[1:34:14] old friends of
[1:34:16] ours and how they got in and they were
[1:34:18] in the store wherever they were praising
[1:34:20] the Lord
[1:34:23] and then she said to me there's no shame
[1:34:26] in the
[1:34:28] name Hallelujah you see because some
[1:34:32] people who call themselves Christians
[1:34:35] are still ashamed of the
[1:34:39] name when they're not in
[1:34:42] church Hallelujah but you cannot be
[1:34:45] ashamed of the name is that
[1:34:48] right Hallelujah every KNE
[1:34:53] every tongue must
[1:34:55] confess hallelujah amen that he is Lord
[1:35:00] to the glory of God brother bam said it
[1:35:03] like this we must
[1:35:06] fight if we must
[1:35:09] Reign but we find out that we we we
[1:35:13] become
[1:35:14] lazy because things we don't know our
[1:35:17] enemy he said this age doesn't know her
[1:35:23] enemy you know the all the other ages
[1:35:26] had to suffer they had to go through
[1:35:29] something but he said our greatest enemy
[1:35:33] in this age is Easy
[1:35:37] Living Easy
[1:35:41] Living how many of y'all
[1:35:43] remember when you had a rough time you
[1:35:46] your way wasn't so
[1:35:49] easy it was doing no time times you
[1:35:52] prayed it was during those times you
[1:35:55] prayed it was during those times you may
[1:35:58] have fasted it was during those times
[1:36:01] you
[1:36:02] kept your
[1:36:05] Bible
[1:36:07] open Hallelujah but
[1:36:10] now we don't see what the enemy is
[1:36:14] doing so easy now God has blessed you so
[1:36:18] well now that you feel I don't have to
[1:36:22] come to
[1:36:23] church I could just look at it on on on
[1:36:25] the video and many of us don't look at
[1:36:28] it on the video but you can't fellowship
[1:36:31] with me on the
[1:36:35] video the Bible says when you see that
[1:36:38] day approaching come together the
[1:36:44] more coming from the
[1:36:46] message marriage of the
[1:36:48] Lamb paragraph 86 I'm taking my time
[1:36:52] because I really want this to to to to
[1:36:54] grip
[1:36:57] you a friend of
[1:37:00] mine uh just got over
[1:37:07] Co and I and I guess that's she hadn't
[1:37:10] never had it
[1:37:12] before a very a very healthy
[1:37:15] [Music]
[1:37:16] woman and uh around 70 I think
[1:37:22] but she described what she just went
[1:37:26] through she said if I could imagine
[1:37:31] hell that's what I would
[1:37:35] imagine she said she hurt all
[1:37:39] over she had pain down her
[1:37:43] spine she said it was worse than having
[1:37:46] a
[1:37:47] baby she said she was on the floor
[1:37:50] wallowing and rolling because of the
[1:37:52] pain was so
[1:37:55] excruciating Hallelujah but she said
[1:37:58] prior to that attack of the
[1:38:00] devil God had already given her a
[1:38:04] dream and she saw herself coming out as
[1:38:07] a winner y'all hear what I'm saying so
[1:38:11] God didn't
[1:38:12] spare the attack but God prepared her
[1:38:16] for the attack understand God is not
[1:38:19] going to spare us
[1:38:21] from the suffering that we're going to
[1:38:23] have to go through but he's trying to
[1:38:26] prepare us hallelujah I want to be
[1:38:32] prepared and I'm preparing
[1:38:35] now
[1:38:39] 86 y'all remember the promises we made
[1:38:43] him and that same thing when you come to
[1:38:47] Christ we said Lord if you would re
[1:38:51] receive me into your I'll love you I'll
[1:38:54] be true to you I'll serve you day and
[1:38:58] night it's too bad we forgot
[1:39:01] that I'll serve you day and night I'll
[1:39:06] fast I'll pray I'll be loyal to you I'll
[1:39:10] bring my tithing into the
[1:39:13] storehouse I'll pray many times a day
[1:39:17] I'll do anything and I pledge all my
[1:39:21] love to you that's what you should do
[1:39:25] that's exactly right where you promis
[1:39:29] that and it should come from your
[1:39:32] heart if you promise your husband that
[1:39:36] and not from your heart you mean it you
[1:39:40] you are
[1:39:43] absolutely not living correctly with
[1:39:47] him it's kind of a crystallized affair
[1:39:52] and and what did he saying what is he
[1:39:53] saying if you listen to that message he
[1:39:57] said if a husband or a wife married each
[1:40:00] other and the love that they felt in the
[1:40:05] beginning if or if that wasn't real he
[1:40:09] said she just
[1:40:11] married in the eyes of God you're not
[1:40:14] even
[1:40:17] married the
[1:40:19] woman said you just bearing his
[1:40:25] children so even at the
[1:40:28] altar when you say I love
[1:40:32] you and I
[1:40:34] do if you're not telling the
[1:40:39] truth God can't sanction
[1:40:42] that and more than likely you'll be
[1:40:47] miserable during your entire marriage
[1:40:51] until you have a come to F love that
[1:40:55] person like you supposed to love that
[1:41:01] person you don't like hearing that but
[1:41:03] that's the
[1:41:05] truth and I'm going bring that to
[1:41:07] Jesus your relationship with God is not
[1:41:13] accepted until you love
[1:41:18] him if he he's not going to accept that
[1:41:20] on the lower level he can't accept it on
[1:41:23] the higher level and he said if you love
[1:41:26] me you will keep my
[1:41:29] commandments so if you don't love
[1:41:32] Christ hello he knows
[1:41:37] it you can't hide it from him you might
[1:41:40] be able to hide it from your natural
[1:41:43] spouse or whatever but when it comes to
[1:41:46] God he knows if you really love him
[1:41:53] Hallelujah and if you don't really love
[1:41:56] him you're kind of like false
[1:42:00] teeth you're there but you didn't come
[1:42:02] from
[1:42:04] him Hallelujah you love the Lord
[1:42:07] hallelujah I'm not I'm not trying to
[1:42:09] beat you now don't get me wrong I'm not
[1:42:12] trying to beat up on you I'm really
[1:42:15] trying to love on you if you want to say
[1:42:18] it like this trying to get you because I
[1:42:21] know your
[1:42:22] battles I know my battles I know how
[1:42:26] intense they
[1:42:27] are at
[1:42:29] times but there I do know one thing
[1:42:33] there is not a
[1:42:35] speck of darkness in my
[1:42:38] heart when it comes to staying with God
[1:42:43] or leaving
[1:42:44] God hallelujah I'm like Paul who shall
[1:42:48] separate me from the love of God no
[1:42:52] matter what I've got to go through no
[1:42:55] matter what he sends me through no
[1:42:58] matter how much I must
[1:43:00] suffer my heart is knitted to his heart
[1:43:04] Hallelujah glory to
[1:43:07] God you said brother Brooks are you
[1:43:09] going to make
[1:43:12] it already
[1:43:15] me and those of you who will have the
[1:43:18] Holy Ghost sealed with the Holy Ghost
[1:43:20] you made it
[1:43:23] already
[1:43:25] Hallelujah glory to God you love the
[1:43:27] Lord coming from question and answers
[1:43:31] paragraph

[1:43:39] understanding
[1:43:40] uh uh the spirits that that works with
[1:43:45] them and I'll say like
[1:43:47] this if you don't love him
[1:43:51] he will become boring to
[1:43:55] you at some point in time you're going
[1:43:58] to get tired of
[1:44:00] Jesus because you don't love him you
[1:44:03] know what I'm saying it's like you
[1:44:05] you're dating
[1:44:07] somebody because somebody else told you
[1:44:09] to date
[1:44:11] him but you don't love that
[1:44:14] person after a while that person becomes
[1:44:16] very annoying to
[1:44:19] you and believe Believe It or
[1:44:21] Not Christ becomes annoying
[1:44:25] annoying to some Christians because they
[1:44:29] don't love him
[1:44:33] enough you don't want somebody to come
[1:44:35] by your
[1:44:36] house all they're going to do is talk
[1:44:39] about
[1:44:41] Jesus what else to talk
[1:44:47] about I want to know what he's done for
[1:44:49] you and I want to tell what he's done
[1:44:52] for
[1:44:53] me Hallelujah now let's paragraph
[1:44:57] 151 now and then at that time
[1:45:02] see the Gentile bride is in
[1:45:05] heaven and the sleeping
[1:45:08] virgins the Gentile
[1:45:11] virgin is not to be saved during that
[1:45:15] time she's already been
[1:45:18] saved but has been re rejected in the

[1:45:24] tribulation
[1:45:26] period for the time of

[1:48:33] Creeds and denominations and
[1:48:37] things see those little foxes that you
[1:48:42] thought you thinking it doesn't matter
[1:48:45] it does
[1:48:47] matter when Jesus was on the cross
[1:48:51] he wasn't even
[1:48:53] clothed he was
[1:48:55] naked and that's what he gives us he
[1:48:58] doesn't give us a word that's clothed
[1:49:01] that's why we needed a prophet that God
[1:49:04] will reveal to us the Naked Truth The
[1:49:08] Naked word is what God has brought to us
[1:49:12] hallelujah and when we see the naked
[1:49:16] word we is no sh to us hallelujah it's

[1:50:12] Christ
[1:50:13] Christ that's the great
[1:50:15] Jewel Jesus that body right h I have a
[1:50:20] ticket to go to heaven when the train
[1:50:24] comes by one of these dark
[1:50:28] mornings oh what
[1:50:30] blessing Hallelujah you see
[1:50:35] identity the only
[1:50:37] identity God wants to
[1:50:40] see is his
[1:50:43] identity in you the word in you made
[1:50:48] manifest in this day
[1:50:50] Hallelujah listen when he saw Jesus when
[1:50:54] Jesus were being baptized by John he
[1:50:57] comes up out of the water and the Holy
[1:51:00] Spirit descends upon him and declare
[1:51:04] this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well
[1:51:07] pleased to dwell
[1:51:09] in right then and there Jesus was
[1:51:13] identified with God and when God gives
[1:51:17] you the Holy Ghost he identified
[1:51:20] himself in
[1:51:22] you Hallelujah this is why we need it
[1:51:27] without the Holy Ghost you don't get to
[1:51:29] heaven and holy this Holy Ghost is
[1:51:32] beyond a Pentecostal
[1:51:35] experience y'all know what I mean it's
[1:51:37] beyond speaking in tongues it's beyond
[1:51:40] jumping and shouting it's beyond dancing
[1:51:44] Hallelujah it is actually a
[1:51:47] change of life in your most being
[1:51:51] Hallelujah in other words he turns on
[1:51:55] the Heavenly
[1:51:57] switch Hallelujah he turns on the
[1:52:00] Heavenly switch with that which was
[1:52:02] darkness in you must
[1:52:05] flee
[1:52:07] Hallelujah is that right brother B said
[1:52:10] you don't have to quit
[1:52:12] it you don't have to quit it with the
[1:52:16] Holy Ghost it quits you
[1:52:22] Hallelujah that's the
[1:52:26] truth I hate seeing people run
[1:52:29] around saying there in the
[1:52:32] message and doing everything sin is
[1:52:38] doing I hate seeing
[1:52:41] that I'm not saying you're
[1:52:44] not I said but you're not alive
[1:52:47] yet potentially you are
[1:52:50] you got to be
[1:52:51] changed if God told
[1:52:55] Nicodemus who was a man who followed the
[1:52:59] word I'm introducing you to a New
[1:53:02] Kingdom a new way of
[1:53:04] life what you understand is flesh what
[1:53:07] you understand is flesh but I'm spir
[1:53:10] speaking of a a Heavenly Kingdom I'm I'm
[1:53:12] speaking of something that is
[1:53:14] spiritual and just as you were born in
[1:53:17] this this world this kind of a kingom
[1:53:20] naturally you must be born into a
[1:53:22] spiritual
[1:53:23] Kingdom
[1:53:25] hallelujah hallelujah is that all right
[1:53:29] think about it you know when it comes to
[1:53:33] our ering
[1:53:36] ways we we understand and and I'm going
[1:53:40] to use this morning
[1:53:42] vasy because she she messed
[1:53:45] up she was
[1:53:48] Queen Hallelujah
[1:53:50] right and a lot of times when we talk
[1:53:52] about vasti vas we always look at the
[1:53:56] denominational
[1:53:58] churches but let me tell you what vasy
[1:54:02] is she is a
[1:54:06] spirit not a
[1:54:08] denomination she is a
[1:54:10] spirit and you can be Anointed with

[1:54:18] had is in this age to anoint you
[1:54:23] Hallelujah yes we we talk about the Holy
[1:54:26] Ghost he's here to anoint us as well but
[1:54:29] in this
[1:54:30] age you still have the spirit of
[1:54:34] vasty Hallelujah thinks she's all
[1:54:39] that Hallelujah can't come to an altar
[1:54:42] call or won't repent when the king's
[1:54:46] constantly calling him the word is being
[1:54:49] preached
[1:54:50] and and the King wants you to come into
[1:54:52] His presence and you sit still in your
[1:54:55] seat you feel his pres but you fail to
[1:54:59] respond back to it that's the spirit of
[1:55:02] vasty Hallelujah she's she was
[1:55:06] Queen you're in the message look how far
[1:55:10] God has brought you Hallelujah he didn't
[1:55:13] leave you in Pentecost he didn't leave
[1:55:16] you with the Baptist he brought you into
[1:55:19] this
[1:55:21] Hallelujah and you still don't want to
[1:55:23] respond to him Hallelujah but I'm going
[1:55:26] tell you something don't respond you
[1:55:30] don't have to respond because God has
[1:55:33] anointed some
[1:55:35] Esters Hallelujah and we're not about
[1:55:38] the outward appearance we're about
[1:55:41] what's in the heart we listen to
[1:55:44] Moriah we listen to the messenger of our
[1:55:47] day we play the
[1:55:51] not just to get an intellectual
[1:55:53] understanding but we we want to know who
[1:55:57] the king is what he likes and what he
[1:56:02] dislikes and whatever he wants of us
[1:56:06] whatever he demands of us that we'll do
[1:56:10] amen
[1:56:12] hallelujah glory to God Esther I'm just
[1:56:16] going to read it here Esther first
[1:56:20] chapter
[1:56:23] 9-13
[1:56:24] Hallelujah and vasty the queen Made A
[1:56:28] Feast for the woman in the Royal house
[1:56:31] which belonged to the king of
[1:56:38] shur and that's the truth you know
[1:56:41] people are having feasts even in the
[1:56:45] message Hallelujah there are people who
[1:56:47] come to your house to eat dinner
[1:56:50] food and won't even come to
[1:56:52] church Hallelujah I ain't going all I'm
[1:56:56] not going to go too much into that it
[1:56:58] it's good to
[1:57:00] Fellowship on the seventh
[1:57:02] day when the heart of the King was
[1:57:04] married with
[1:57:07] wine he he he
[1:57:10] commanded
[1:57:13] Bona big ABA zista and cauas the Seven
[1:57:18] Chamberlain that served the prince uh
[1:57:21] served in the presence of Asos the
[1:57:39] king to bring vasty the queen before the
[1:57:42] king with the Crown
[1:57:44] Royal to show the people and the princes
[1:57:48] her beauty for she was fair to look
[1:57:59] upon but you know what you can take and
[1:58:02] you can go all the way up to that up the
[1:58:06] scale all the way up to brotherly
[1:58:11] kindness and you still can be
[1:58:16] rejected because the measure of Christ
[1:58:18] is divine
[1:58:22] love the
[1:58:24] Pentecostals came all the way up to
[1:58:26] brotherly
[1:58:28] kindness but they failed to cross
[1:58:31] over Hallelujah when God gave the
[1:58:34] revelation of The
[1:58:36] Headstone when Christ stood there in his
[1:58:40] presence even saying come unto me
[1:58:43] Hallelujah they stood there and
[1:58:48] refused to come because of their Creeds
[1:58:52] because of their dogas you don't belong
[1:58:54] to our church you didn't come on our
[1:58:59] schooling so this cannot be Christ but
[1:59:02] it was Christ wasn't a
[1:59:05] Pharisee he wasn't a
[1:59:08] sadducee he was none of those religious
[1:59:11] things he was the word of God made
[1:59:15] manifest and so must it be the same
[1:59:18] thing with us we're not a Baptist we're
[1:59:22] not Methodist we're not Pentecostal and
[1:59:25] we're not what you call message this
[1:59:28] message is to bring us into being the
[1:59:32] revealed word of the
[1:59:35] hour
[1:59:37] Hallelujah must be the
[1:59:40] word the word is defines who you
[1:59:45] are Hallelujah you worry don't worry God
[1:59:49] will always give you the revelation of
[1:59:52] who he is what he's doing in this
[1:59:56] day thank you
[1:59:59] Lord
[2:00:00] hallelujah
[2:00:03] right she had
[2:00:05] it now I'm going say it like this even
[2:00:07] if if it was typed out to be the
[2:00:09] Pentecostal Church it goes beyond
[2:00:12] that cuz you know the Pentecostal Church
[2:00:15] they had all the gifts they had people
[2:00:18] being raised from the
[2:00:20] dead they they had great ministers and
[2:00:23] all that they had it she once she once
[2:00:26] was
[2:00:27] beautiful you look at her now you can
[2:00:30] tell she has been
[2:00:32] excommunicated she really thinks she's
[2:00:34] still with God but look at her she no
[2:00:39] longer looks like a
[2:00:41] queen she stripped her clothing she wear
[2:00:45] all this makeup she does everything the
[2:00:48] world
[2:00:49] does trying to impress
[2:00:52] God but you can't impress god with your
[2:00:56] substance he gave you the
[2:01:02] substance gave you
[2:01:05] everything y'all getting quiet on me but
[2:01:09] I hope it's because you're
[2:01:11] thinking but when Queen vast refused to
[2:01:14] come at the king's
[2:01:15] commandment 12th
[2:01:18] verse
[2:01:23] therefore by this
[2:01:26] chamberlains therefore was the king very
[2:01:29] raw and his anger burned in
[2:01:36] him then the king said to the wise men
[2:01:40] which knew the
[2:01:41] times they knew the
[2:01:44] times and let me say it like this
[2:01:46] brother bam knew the
[2:01:48] times and he kept telling us about the
[2:01:51] times it's later than you
[2:01:54] think what 2 minutes to midnight or
[2:01:58] however it was 3 minutes but where are
[2:02:01] we

[2:02:15] fruit that's the
[2:02:17] time
[2:02:19] Hallelujah you understand me Hallelujah
[2:02:23] first let finish this this verse then
[2:02:26] the king said to the wise men which knew
[2:02:29] the times for so was the king's manner
[2:02:33] toward all that knew law and
[2:02:43] judgment Hallelujah you understand me
[2:02:46] what she was judged with law and
[2:02:50] judgment Hallelujah but the Bride of
[2:02:53] Jesus Christ God gives us
[2:02:56] Grace Hallelujah is that right listen
[2:03:00] whether you realize it or
[2:03:02] not Esther broke the
[2:03:05] law when she went in to see the king she
[2:03:09] broke the law but she was not judged by
[2:03:12] the law she was judged by grace and love
[2:03:17] y'all hear what I'm saying this is how
[2:03:19] the bride is
[2:03:21] judged Hallelujah by grace and

[2:04:09] confirmation should I say that again I

[2:04:17] says if he has never give you the
[2:04:20] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:04:23] yet then he hasn't confirmed your faith

[2:10:19] fornication going out with the world
[2:10:22] professing something living something
[2:10:25] different that that won't work never
[2:10:29] work what the church ought to
[2:10:31] do is to do like Esther
[2:10:34] did Esther refus the adoring of the
[2:10:38] world Hallelujah now let's get down to
[2:10:41] the because the adorning of the
[2:10:43] world is not wearing a short
[2:10:47] skirt
[2:10:48] the dawning of the world is accepting
[2:10:51] the spirit in you that will make you
[2:10:54] wear a short
[2:10:57] skirt y'all hear what I'm saying the
[2:10:59] adorning of the world is taking your
[2:11:03] spiritual man and allowing your
[2:11:05] spiritual man to take on the attributes
[2:11:09] of the world because if that spiritual
[2:11:12] man takes on the attributes of the
[2:11:14] world physically he's going to do right
[2:11:18] what's in his Spirit people say oh you
[2:11:21] can't judge me on what I wear I don't
[2:11:25] have to you judging yourself the word
[2:11:28] has already said it Hallelujah glory to
[2:11:31] God what's on the inside will reflect on
[2:11:35] the
[2:11:38] outside
[2:11:40] Hallelujah I'm almost
[2:11:42] done the love of God will always
[2:11:46] manifest itself to the bride
[2:11:50] I I I want to say this
[2:11:52] again those of you who who gave even
[2:11:55] those who didn't give
[2:11:57] her but but you were United in spirit
[2:12:01] to to to do what you did this
[2:12:05] morning I I'll never forget
[2:12:08] it uh it was so on
[2:12:14] time and normally I'm a real cry baby
[2:12:19] but I'm still in inside so
[2:12:23] emotional thinking you and loving you
[2:12:30] more for for what you did
[2:12:32] today you know you know the depth of
[2:12:35] what I'm saying one of these old days uh
[2:12:38] when we get to
[2:12:42] heaven
[2:12:43] Hallelujah here in here in is now set
[2:12:47] forth the love love of
[2:12:50] God he desired in a love family of his
[2:12:57] own a family of
[2:13:00] Sons Sons like
[2:13:02] himself there before him lies all kind
[2:13:06] all mankind as one lump of
[2:13:11] clay out of that same lump he will now
[2:13:15] make
[2:13:16] vessels unto honor and unto
[2:13:21] dishonor the choosing will be his own
[2:13:24] choosing then those chosen ones born in
[2:13:29] of his spirit will be trained to conform
[2:13:32] to His Image in their in their
[2:13:36] walk listen I'm going repeat that then
[2:13:40] those chosen ones born of his spirit
[2:13:45] will be what
[2:13:46] trained to conform to His Image in their
[2:13:52] walk he reproves with all long
[2:13:57] suffering and gentleness and
[2:14:06] mercy now I'm going to throw this in how
[2:14:08] many times we've done something wrong
[2:14:10] and we say God will never do it
[2:14:13] again and then we find ourselves doing
[2:14:16] it
[2:14:16] again that's his long
[2:14:20] suffering Hallelujah is that right that
[2:14:23] that he reproves you because he brings
[2:14:27] condemnation to you Hallelujah but he
[2:14:31] knows you will repent he he knows you
[2:14:35] say God forgive me seven times in a day
[2:14:39] a just man will fall but he'll get up
[2:14:44] Hallelujah is that right he chasen with
[2:14:47] n na scarred
[2:14:50] hands listen to this now sometimes this
[2:14:55] Potter must take the vessel he is
[2:14:57] working on and thoroughly break it down
[2:15:02] in order that he may rebuild it exactly
[2:15:05] as he desires
[2:15:16] it
[2:15:19] so let me say it like this when you go
[2:15:21] through major
[2:15:22] storms is not always the
[2:15:28] devil many of times is God answering
[2:15:32] your
[2:15:34] prayer Lord I want to be like you L do
[2:15:38] y'all believe the word the Bible said
[2:15:41] the suffering of this world cannot be
[2:15:46] compared can't be
[2:15:48] compared there's no equality in it
[2:15:52] nothing that can be compared to the
[2:15:55] things in which he has prepared for
[2:15:57] us I want to see that I want to
[2:16:01] experience that I want to be a part of
[2:16:04] that Hallelujah yes Lord I'm almost done
[2:16:09] folks I know you're tired some of you
[2:16:11] just getting off from work I I it it was
[2:16:15] it was cold in here and I tried to turn
[2:16:16] it up
[2:16:18] so but I know how to I know the
[2:16:22] struggle but it is
[2:16:25] love that is his
[2:16:30] love another way of his love there is
[2:16:37] not he doesn't know how to do it no
[2:16:39] other kind of
[2:16:41] way now you look at the Son of God who
[2:16:45] goes through the Wilderness for 40 days
[2:16:49] no food and I don't know about the water
[2:16:52] it says he didn't have but all I
[2:16:55] know he made
[2:16:58] it you understand me he wasn't
[2:17:02] spared he had to
[2:17:04] suffer Hallelujah and people said
[2:17:08] well I want you to take
[2:17:10] note he suffered more after he received
[2:17:14] the Holy
[2:17:16] Ghost and the devil will tell you you
[2:17:19] must not have the Holy Ghost look how
[2:17:21] much you're suffering the devil is a
[2:17:25] liar Hallelujah if I don't have it why
[2:17:29] are you bothering
[2:17:34] me right why you wasting your time on me
[2:17:38] if I don't have it see why you bothering
[2:17:43] me and why are you constantly telling me
[2:17:46] I don't have it
[2:17:48] when I know you are a
[2:17:53] liar oh God have mercy because if he can
[2:17:57] keep you believing that you don't have
[2:17:59] it he's literally he's stunting your
[2:18:05] growth hallelujah oh little
[2:18:08] flock do not
[2:18:10] fear this age is fast
[2:18:14] closing as it does those tears will be
[2:18:18] bound
[2:18:20] together I'm trying to get us ready here
[2:18:22] and as a threefold cord is not easily
[2:18:28] broken they will have a tremendous
[2:18:31] threefold strength of Poli political
[2:18:34] physical and spiritual satanical
[2:18:46] power
[2:18:51] and they will seek to destroy the bride
[2:18:53] of
[2:18:56] Christ she will
[2:18:58] suffer but she will
[2:19:01] endure Hallelujah fear not those things
[2:19:05] that are coming upon the
[2:19:07] Earth for he who loved his
[2:19:11] own loveth them until the
[2:19:14] end so let let me say this cuz I'm going

[2:20:58] Bosworth starting at uh paragraph
[2:21:03] 12 and it
[2:21:05] reads and I said brother
[2:21:09] Bosworth one more thing I would like to
[2:21:12] ask
[2:21:14] you he he said what is that brother Bram
[2:21:18] I said now you put in about 60 years for
[2:21:22] the Lord in
[2:21:27] service or maybe and I said when was
[2:21:31] your happiest time in
[2:21:35] life he said right
[2:21:39] now and I said brother BOS brother you
[2:21:42] know you're
[2:21:44] dying he said I can't die
[2:21:50] y y y that means so much to
[2:21:56] me when you come down and you're not
[2:22:00] afraid of
[2:22:02] death cuz you know you can't
[2:22:05] die you know you getting ready to take a
[2:22:08] trip come on somebody if if a wagon
[2:22:11] would pull up right in front of the
[2:22:13] church right
[2:22:14] now and call my name and says I'm
[2:22:17] getting ready to take you to that other
[2:22:19] dimension right
[2:22:23] your you know what what you think I'm
[2:22:26] going to
[2:22:28] do H what you think oh no I'm going to
[2:22:30] love these people I'm going to
[2:22:33] stay that ain't mean me yet I'm just
[2:22:38] saying I going to say
[2:22:40] byebye see you later I'm going to run
[2:22:44] out that door I ain't going to walk I'm
[2:22:46] going to run
[2:22:48] might dive or jump but I'm getting in
[2:22:50] there you understand me isn't that what
[2:22:54] we want
[2:22:57] folks when I was a kid That's what Satan
[2:23:01] would
[2:23:02] always bring
[2:23:05] fear I would be buried and alive and
[2:23:09] people didn't know me they couldn't hear
[2:23:10] me
[2:23:11] scream I used to dream
[2:23:15] that and I'm knocking on the coffin's
[2:23:17] door trying to get
[2:23:19] out but I was
[2:23:22] lost I the dream falling off a
[2:23:26] clip falling what was that my soul was
[2:23:30] talking to
[2:23:32] me Hallelujah and since I got
[2:23:35] saved I don't have none of that kind of
[2:23:37] stuff no dreams of that nature
[2:23:40] none right so let me get back to the
[2:23:43] this just so you know a true saint of
[2:23:46] God should never have a dream
[2:23:48] dream of of you being lost or dead or
[2:23:52] unless God is speaking
[2:23:55] [Music]
[2:23:56] something Hallelujah he said I can't
[2:24:01] die I died many years
[2:24:04] ago and he said brother Brandon all that
[2:24:08] I have loved and cared for for the past
[2:24:13] 60 years I'm watching for him to open
[2:24:17] that door at any time and come and get
[2:24:21] me think about think about what I'm
[2:24:24] saying now when I when I said that if
[2:24:28] you have a dream bad one like that know
[2:24:30] that came from the devil it didn't come
[2:24:32] from
[2:24:33] God hallelujah no weapon formed against
[2:24:36] you shall
[2:24:39] prosper
[2:24:41] Hallelujah I think of
[2:24:43] that the the palm the Psalm of Life
[2:24:47] life lives of Great Men all remind
[2:24:53] us we can make our lives
[2:24:56] Sublime with parting leaves behind us
[2:25:01] footprints on the sands of
[2:25:03] time and he certainly left Footprints to
[2:25:08] me before he
[2:25:10] died went on into Glory about about one
[2:25:15] hour or maybe more
[2:25:18] before he passed away he had been kind
[2:25:22] of asleep for a few
[2:25:25] hours and his wife his sons loved ones
[2:25:29] were standing around and he and the old
[2:25:31] man woke up looked around and raised up
[2:25:36] run across the
[2:25:37] floor shook hands with his mother who
[2:25:41] had been gone for many years with his
[2:25:44] father and for over and hour he shook
[2:25:48] hands with people saying this is Brother
[2:25:52] John yes you came to Christ in my
[2:25:55] meeting in Juliet
[2:25:58] Illinois here's brother shaking hand
[2:26:02] with converts that had passed on for
[2:26:04] many
[2:26:05] years he said I'll tell you sometimes I
[2:26:10] believe in that hour we'll pass from
[2:26:13] this earth into
[2:26:15] another I believe
[2:26:17] sometime the river is going to be hard
[2:26:19] to cross anyhow you know I believe maybe
[2:26:24] the Lord says to our loved ones go down
[2:26:28] to the river and meet them down there
[2:26:32] for as Jacob said we'll be gathered with
[2:26:36] with our people
[2:26:38] someday Hallelujah now I'm just crazy
[2:26:42] enough to believe
[2:26:44] that Hallelujah
[2:26:47] glory to
[2:26:53] God you may stand he said now I want to
[2:26:58] ask you
[2:27:00] something that God is trying to perform
[2:27:02] in his
[2:27:05] church and the church is trying to
[2:27:07] perform by the
[2:27:09] Creeds and the two can't work
[2:27:12] together you got to get rid of the
[2:27:15] Creed and get Christ
[2:27:17] in and how can you do it when he sees
[2:27:21] the blood when the blood has been
[2:27:24] applied with a sincere heart and a hand
[2:27:28] laid Upon Jesus Christ and a heart
[2:27:31] that's true before God to confess his
[2:27:34] wrong and be born of the Holy Spirit
[2:27:38] then the work of God would follow as he
[2:27:41] said it would do yeah
[2:27:44] Church wants to perform
[2:27:47] through their Creed and see how many
[2:27:50] members they can get God wants to
[2:27:52] perform through the power of the blood
[2:27:55] to get Christians born again that's
[2:27:58] exactly the difference of it Hallelujah
[2:28:01] you must
[2:28:03] reject to do this you've got to reject
[2:28:06] the Holy
[2:28:08] Spirit and his performing power to
[2:28:12] accept the Creed you have to see the
[2:28:15] truth before you can accept an error and
[2:28:18] if you're going to be a Christian you
[2:28:21] have to walk over over God's
[2:28:24] promise I mean you you you he said you
[2:28:28] can't Hallelujah in order to get get an
[2:28:31] error you have to walk over God's
[2:28:35] promise he said because there is a red
[2:28:37] light flashing before
[2:28:40] you all the time all the time this is

[2:48:01] on
[2:48:03] hallelujah amen how many appreciate the
[2:48:06] message this morning
[2:48:08] amen amen we just have a few
[2:48:10] announcements to
[2:48:11] make um this coming
[2:48:18] Sunday we have a joint service with the
[2:48:21] Saints in Iowa
[2:48:27] City and we have the service here in De
[2:48:31] Mo starting at our regular
[2:48:35] time and we have a guest uh preacher
[2:48:38] who's coming
[2:48:40] in that's from from the
[2:48:43] Congo Pastor Gideon
[2:48:47] kasongo amen so he was um used to be the
[2:48:51] pastor of some of the Saints in this
[2:48:55] church used be brother kambas
[2:49:00] Pastor brother
[2:49:03] Isa and probably a couple of other
[2:49:06] ones so we'll be having a service
[2:49:10] here and he'll be
[2:49:12] ministering amen and um as a pastor once
[2:49:18] mentioned uh Brother Joseph for the
[2:49:23] TV and um in as much as you think the
[2:49:25] church has a lot of
[2:49:30] money the church does
[2:49:33] not because we the
[2:49:35] church do not pay
[2:49:38] offering so we barely are able to pay
[2:49:43] rent
[2:49:48] barely make it to pay
[2:49:50] rent so we are not able to get
[2:49:53] additional stuff that the church
[2:49:58] needs like
[2:50:09] equipment so if you feel
[2:50:11] led you can approach the trustees or the
[2:50:15] um the pastor or the technical
[2:50:21] Brothers if you feel like you want to
[2:50:23] help because we need to get our
[2:50:27] microphones our wireless
[2:50:31] transmitters so if the Lord impresses
[2:50:33] that upon your
[2:50:36] heart you are more than free and more
[2:50:38] than welcome to do
[2:50:42] so amen and our sister Ruby just
[2:50:45] mentioned that since um we are having a
[2:50:48] joint service next
[2:50:56] Sunday it's good for us to have a
[2:51:01] potluck so um the way it
[2:51:05] works you make something from home
[2:51:10] food whatever food you're going to
[2:51:13] make each and every person or each and
[2:51:16] every
[2:51:17] family you bring
[2:51:20] food and we all share that
[2:51:23] food we love one
[2:51:27] another someone say sharing is
[2:51:31] caring so I believe um for the
[2:51:35] Sisters if you can coordinate with
[2:51:38] sister
[2:51:40] Ruby and um I don't know you'll figure
[2:51:43] out who is helping with the
[2:51:48] coordination so that everyone does not
[2:51:51] bring just
[2:51:54] [Music]
[2:51:55] fuu and you don't have meat or anything
[2:51:58] else so uh please just help coordinate
[2:52:01] with the sisters I don't know whoever
[2:52:02] they're going to
[2:52:06] pick amen and
[2:52:09] lastly uh we have a card that we're
[2:52:11] supposed to give to the pastor and his
[2:52:13] wife
[2:52:16] brother Simon is holding
[2:52:19] it so unfortunately it's not big enough
[2:52:21] for everyone to write a
[2:52:23] [Music]
[2:52:27] message so it's okay if you have a
[2:52:29] message you can tell
[2:52:32] him but we would like everyone to sign
[2:52:35] their name on the on the
[2:52:39] card yeah or a family representative or
[2:52:42] just anyone to to write the just to sign
[2:52:44] the
[2:52:44] [Music]
[2:52:46] name amen so when the pastor can look at
[2:52:48] it he remember
[2:52:51] you amen so everyone you need to write
[2:52:54] there even if even if you were not able
[2:52:57] to
[2:52:58] [Music]
[2:52:59] contribute we still need your signature
[2:53:01] over
[2:53:03] there amen we have come to the end of
[2:53:06] our
[2:53:08] service one more time just turn around
[2:53:10] to your neighbor and
