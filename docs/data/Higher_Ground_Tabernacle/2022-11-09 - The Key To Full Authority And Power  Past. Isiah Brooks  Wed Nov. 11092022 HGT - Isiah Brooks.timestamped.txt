[45:15] lift me up
[45:17] in every day I live
[45:22] Lord I love you more
[45:26] the more that I Surrender the more that
[45:30] I Surrender
[45:33] the lighter my Lord
[45:38] the more that I release my kids the more
[45:45] you take control
[45:48] the more that I can humble myself the
[45:54] more you lift me up
[45:57] in every day I live
[46:01] Lord I love you more can we sing that
[46:06] one more time oh the more that I
[46:10] Surrender
[46:12] the light earth
[46:16] [Music]
[46:33] [Music]
[46:35] in every day I live Lord I love you more
[46:42] every day every day I live
[46:48] Lord I love you more
[46:53] in every day I live Lord I love you more
[47:03] oh
[47:04] hey I live
[47:07] Lord I love you more
[47:17] is every day that I live I love him more
[47:19] amen
[47:21] we get right into the word of God now I
[47:23] appreciate that
[47:33] one last
[47:35] I spoke we preached on God's order of
[47:38] things
[47:40] building up with that we're going to
[47:44] work with some other scriptures here
[47:48] basically
[47:51] trusting that the Lord will
[47:54] give us understanding of the scripture
[47:58] in the way that he does things
[48:01] sometimes God is even misunderstood by
[48:04] Christians
[48:06] because he doesn't tell us what he's
[48:08] doing
[48:10] but God is depending upon our trust
[48:14] trust doesn't doubt
[48:16] and Trust doesn't question
[48:19] trust believes
[48:21] and so by the grace of God I like to
[48:24] read Revelation 16 and 7.
[48:31] and there will read psalms 19 and 7.
[48:40] Revelation 16 and 7.
[48:44] and I heard another out of the altar
[48:47] saying even so Lord God Almighty
[48:52] true and righteous
[48:55] are thy judgments
[48:59] Psalms 19 and 7.
[49:07] the law of the Lord is perfect
[49:11] converting the soul
[49:14] the testimony of the Lord is sure
[49:18] making wise the simple
[49:23] let us pray
[49:26] our gracious father we thank you for
[49:29] your grace and your mercy we thank you
[49:31] for being so good to us
[49:35] without you Jesus we are nothing
[49:39] but Lord with you we are everything
[49:42] and I pray Lord God tonight that you
[49:45] would give us ears to hear
[49:47] in a heart to receive what the spirit is
[49:50] saying to the church
[49:52] bless us now and we give you glory we
[49:55] give you praise we give you honor o Lamb
[49:58] of God that takes away the sins of the
[50:01] world
[50:01] in your lovely name Jesus Christ we pray
[50:05] amen you may be seated
[50:15] in the way that we are
[50:19] bringing the word tonight
[50:23] I'll try to
[50:25] work some more with it on Sunday by the
[50:28] grace of God
[50:33] but tonight I want to
[50:36] kind of deal with the key
[50:38] to full Authority and Power
[50:43] now we know by the grace of God that the
[50:46] Bible says that
[50:47] after which the Holy Ghost has come upon
[50:49] you you shall receive power
[50:52] and if we look at the early church we
[50:55] can see that they truly had Authority
[50:58] and Power
[51:00] but throughout the church ages there was
[51:02] something left and something lost
[51:06] only because the church got out of the
[51:09] order of God
[51:11] remember when Peter preached
[51:14] Peter said this saying Jesus
[51:17] God has made Lord and Christ
[51:22] and somehow they fell out of the order
[51:24] of that
[51:26] we understand the deed of the nicolaitan
[51:28] became a Doctrine and we know all of the
[51:30] things that went on after that
[51:34] we know how justification came by way of
[51:37] Luther and sanctification came about
[51:39] Wesley and the Pentecostals and all of
[51:42] the things that was restored to God and
[51:44] God was doing a new thing
[51:46] restoring the gifts of God back to the
[51:49] church
[51:51] but even the Pentecostals got out of
[51:53] order
[51:55] they left organization they left the
[51:59] denominations and they were free spirits
[52:02] they were led to go where God would lead
[52:04] them and it was such a a wonderful time
[52:07] that went on you know you'd hear people
[52:09] say God told me
[52:12] now you don't hear those kind of things
[52:13] because the order of God has been broken
[52:18] God must be headship he must be your
[52:22] head and not your tail
[52:25] right he can't be second person to you
[52:27] he must be the person
[52:30] matter of fact he must
[52:33] be your only person
[52:39] God always
[52:43] warns us and
[52:45] he tries to keep us
[52:47] in order remember I told you how the
[52:50] church A's got out of out of order so
[52:52] much to God say okay I know one way to
[52:56] keep you in order and that was the Holy
[52:58] Ghost
[52:59] So He restored the Holy Ghost back in
[53:02] the church
[53:04] to gain order
[53:06] but we find out that men and
[53:08] personalities got in there and then when
[53:10] they made the evidence of speaking in
[53:12] tongues as the Holy Ghost we find out
[53:14] that what was happening now is that as
[53:17] Satan seduced Eve and brought forth two
[53:19] seeds
[53:21] so did the devil do it by way of the
[53:23] word
[53:25] he began to bring two C's out of the
[53:27] word by perverting the revelation of the
[53:31] word
[53:32] nowhere that God ever said that the
[53:34] evidence of speaking in tongues with the
[53:36] Holy Ghost but if you ask the majority
[53:38] of the people in laodicea they'll say I
[53:41] got the Holy Ghost because I spoke in
[53:43] tongues
[53:44] but that is truly a false Doctrine
[53:47] when the Holy Ghost comes it may not
[53:50] make in tongues
[53:51] tongues and we understand this and
[53:53] tongues just
[53:55] but when the Holy Ghost comes it comes
[53:58] to change you
[54:00] amen and to take you out of this Fallen
[54:03] order
[54:04] into a higher order
[54:06] Paul calls it a higher calling
[54:10] but it's out of this natural man into a
[54:15] spiritual man
[54:17] and that's the only kind of man that
[54:21] will be accepted
[54:23] in the true kingdom of God
[54:26] matter of fact the Bible said that you
[54:28] can't even understand the scriptures
[54:31] understand what God is saying except you
[54:34] be born again
[54:36] of the spirit of God
[54:39] but one of the things that I find out is
[54:41] that God has no respect
[54:45] for those who have no respect for him
[54:50] if you don't respect the word
[54:53] you cannot expect God to honor you
[54:57] he is a king
[54:59] he is God
[55:01] now remember
[55:02] when
[55:04] the lamb took the book
[55:06] something Mighty happened there
[55:10] because remember when the angel bowed to
[55:14] John about to the when John bowed to the
[55:17] angel the angel told John get up
[55:21] worship thou God
[55:24] but when the lamb was revealed when the
[55:27] lamb took the book when the lamb
[55:30] declared something that was not visibly
[55:33] or or spoken he declared when he took
[55:37] the book he and God was one
[55:40] how do you know that
[55:42] because the elders bow
[55:44] the Angels bow
[55:46] everything in heaven bow
[55:49] and angels and and and they only bow to
[55:53] God
[55:54] and so as that Lamb with bloody lamb was
[55:57] standing there it was signifying that
[56:00] God and man had become one
[56:04] and Jesus Christ was the first of his
[56:07] creation
[56:08] is that right knowing that there would
[56:11] come other brethren
[56:14] so what you're saying brother Brooks is
[56:16] when the bride and Christ really becomes
[56:19] one
[56:22] all Heaven and Earth
[56:25] will bow
[56:33] see but you'll never have
[56:35] respect for God if you don't fear Him
[56:38] most people don't fear God
[56:42] they don't see him
[56:44] and they don't understand him
[56:47] because if they feared him they never
[56:49] would have crucified him
[56:51] but the reason why they crucified him is
[56:54] because they didn't fear Him
[56:56] and they didn't understand him and they
[56:59] didn't see him
[57:01] right there in their faces but they
[57:05] could not comprehend that this man born
[57:09] of a virgin born a carpenter son a
[57:12] Nazarite out of Nazareth was God
[57:17] amen
[57:20] they couldn't see him
[57:22] the same man that cried at Lazarus tomb
[57:27] wept they said that's not just a tear
[57:30] coming down your cheek
[57:33] but he was all God
[57:38] yet he was a man
[57:40] and John in the first chapter of Saint
[57:43] John said he was the light of men every
[57:48] time I read that I get excited because
[57:51] he's basically saying this is the
[57:53] Revelation he was the revelation of what
[57:56] a real man is supposed to be
[57:59] a real man of God
[58:01] amen has Authority
[58:04] because he's the son
[58:06] I'm going to read this
[58:09] because it's so important to respect and
[58:12] when you find out that people have no
[58:15] respect for one another that shows they
[58:17] have no respect for God
[58:20] people can't forgive each other
[58:23] and let me tell you something oh I'll
[58:25] bring it in the message
[58:26] hatred is murder
[58:31] that's what it is God will classify you
[58:34] as a murderer
[58:37] I'm gonna show you in the scripture just
[58:38] a moment I'm not I'm not I'm not just
[58:40] adding I'm telling you something that's
[58:42] real
[58:44] listen coming from the message respect
[58:48] and his his brother Ram said in the in
[58:51] in the paragraph 53
[58:55] and that and because that God is God he
[58:59] deserves a respect
[59:01] that's right he and he we've got to
[59:06] respect him
[59:07] and give a fear to him
[59:11] and that brings in that brings respect
[59:15] God has demanded that for who himself
[59:19] and for all his servants god listen let
[59:23] me see that God has demanded that for
[59:26] himself
[59:28] and for all his servants
[59:32] how we know that they are his servants
[59:36] because he vindicates these servants by
[59:39] his word
[59:41] he takes these servants and make them
[59:43] Servants of God
[59:45] and proves that they are servants by
[59:48] making his word work through them
[59:50] service servants
[59:53] then as you respect that servant you
[59:56] respect God
[59:57] so when I respect you and you respect me
[1:00:01] and we respect each other then we are
[1:00:04] respecting God Amen
[1:00:06] did not Jesus say is so much as you have
[1:00:10] done unto the least of these my little
[1:00:14] ones you have done it unto me
[1:00:17] and it would be better for you than a
[1:00:20] millstone hang at your neck and you
[1:00:25] would drown in the depths of the sea
[1:00:27] than to offend one of them
[1:00:31] I think all of us need to listen to this
[1:00:35] Hallelujah for I say unto you behold
[1:00:39] their face their Angels always before my
[1:00:43] father's Faith which is in heaven
[1:00:47] their theophonies are standing there
[1:00:51] Hallelujah
[1:00:53] now we know that we are that they are
[1:00:56] that we being children of God that we
[1:01:00] are a part of God and God demands this
[1:01:04] respect
[1:01:05] and then God shows who his children are
[1:01:09] he shows it by wonders and signs
[1:01:13] and that's it being done
[1:01:18] you understand that so respect goes a
[1:01:22] long way I'm telling you you can't even
[1:01:24] reach God's level
[1:01:26] of perfection a maturity until respect
[1:01:30] comes
[1:01:34] now that shows that at the beginning I'm
[1:01:37] reading another quote from there they
[1:01:39] had nothing to start with
[1:01:41] as Abraham and his seed after him 61.
[1:01:47] huh
[1:01:48] for if you love God
[1:01:50] you can't you couldn't wire you away
[1:01:54] from church
[1:01:55] they couldn't chain you away from it
[1:01:59] they can't hide a Believer from God
[1:02:03] yeah wait a minute wait a minute now he
[1:02:05] said nothing can keep you from church
[1:02:09] if you love God
[1:02:13] but you can't love him if you don't
[1:02:15] respect him
[1:02:18] hey that's the truth you can't love me
[1:02:20] if I if you don't respect me and I don't
[1:02:22] love you if I don't respect you
[1:02:26] respect goes both ways
[1:02:32] the problem is we forget who's in the
[1:02:35] house
[1:02:39] they can't hide a Believer from God he's
[1:02:44] in his heart oh he might be all deceived
[1:02:47] now there are many people that actually
[1:02:50] think that they're right but if they're
[1:02:53] just stop and watch your life you see
[1:02:55] the spirit of God isn't in there if it
[1:03:00] doesn't cope with the Bible
[1:03:02] then there's something wrong with the
[1:03:05] experience that you have
[1:03:07] so you must come back line up with the
[1:03:10] word to see if the life of God is in you
[1:03:13] if you love the world better than your
[1:03:16] love prayer meetings what
[1:03:19] if you rather watch a television program
[1:03:22] than to pray
[1:03:24] there's something wrong with you
[1:03:27] if you'd rather take a Sunday afternoon
[1:03:30] and ride instead of going to church
[1:03:32] there's something wrong with you
[1:03:35] somewhere because where your heart is
[1:03:38] there's your Treasures are also said the
[1:03:42] Lord Jesus your heart is built into it
[1:03:46] you are part of it you become a part of
[1:03:49] Christ because you're built into the
[1:03:51] structure of Christ
[1:03:53] because you're the bride of Christ if
[1:03:56] you love him
[1:04:02] coming into the power coming into full
[1:04:05] Authority and power this is what the
[1:04:08] message came for
[1:04:09] Pentecost failed
[1:04:13] just like vasty failed
[1:04:16] but what was the king what was it the
[1:04:19] matter about vasty he King ahasura
[1:04:23] wanted to show off
[1:04:25] his beautiful wife to the world
[1:04:29] and if that was his motive if that was
[1:04:31] his objective if that was his desire
[1:04:34] then what about now
[1:04:36] we have come in this day to declare that
[1:04:39] Jesus Christ is alive and well he's not
[1:04:43] dead
[1:04:46] the Pentecostal Church may be
[1:04:48] but the bride is not
[1:04:52] how are we going to get there
[1:04:55] by faith
[1:04:57] by respect
[1:04:59] by Trust
[1:05:01] Trust
[1:05:03] doesn't need anything
[1:05:06] trust is such a revelation
[1:05:09] that it doesn't need anything
[1:05:12] to make it happen
[1:05:14] when you trust somewhere somebody is
[1:05:16] unconditional
[1:05:18] it's not because of what they've done
[1:05:20] for you it's just something that makes
[1:05:22] you do it it's like when you love God
[1:05:25] you can't even explain it
[1:05:28] don't know why amen no matter what
[1:05:30] you're going through amen you know you
[1:05:32] love him that's why Paul said who
[1:05:36] shall separate me
[1:05:38] from the love of God
[1:05:40] see
[1:05:41] see
[1:05:43] II Peter
[1:05:44] 1 4-11 we know these scriptures but I'm
[1:05:47] gonna read them anyway
[1:05:49] we're gonna get the fourth verse it says
[1:05:51] whereby are given unto us exceedingly
[1:05:53] great and precious promises that by
[1:05:56] these ye might be partakers of the
[1:05:58] divine nature haven't escaped the
[1:06:00] corruption that is in the world through
[1:06:02] what lust not only does this scripture
[1:06:05] vindicate what happened in the Garden of
[1:06:08] Eden
[1:06:09] with the serpent and Eve
[1:06:12] but it also brings us to a place to know
[1:06:15] that we must change
[1:06:18] there's a way of escaping the damnable
[1:06:21] nature of the devil
[1:06:25] right ah Jesus wasn't playing when he
[1:06:28] said make the tree good or make it evil
[1:06:31] because we've lived throughout thousands
[1:06:35] of years eating off the tree of Good and
[1:06:38] Evil
[1:06:39] but there must come listen you can't
[1:06:42] listen you you got to respect God
[1:06:45] if you don't believe that God can bring
[1:06:47] you to a state of perfection
[1:06:49] you're disbelieving the word
[1:06:54] why would God put it in the word that
[1:06:57] you can be perfect
[1:06:59] not the perfect Perfection is not taste
[1:07:02] not touch not handled not Perfection is
[1:07:06] having God in you
[1:07:08] he is the only perfection
[1:07:11] be holy for your father which is in
[1:07:14] heaven is Holy that's the only Holiness
[1:07:16] you ever have is God the holy God in you
[1:07:25] and he says beside this giving all
[1:07:28] diligent add to your faith virtue into
[1:07:30] virtue knowledge into knowledge
[1:07:32] Temperance and to Temperance patience
[1:07:35] into patience God like this remember I
[1:07:36] said last week your attitude toward the
[1:07:40] word and toward what God God's judgment
[1:07:42] determines where you are in your
[1:07:45] maturity
[1:07:46] if you think God has cursed you if you
[1:07:49] think God is mean if you think God Amen
[1:07:52] is punishing you amen you're still a
[1:07:54] child
[1:07:55] in your growth
[1:07:58] but if you see God as your counselor
[1:08:03] you see God as your Shepherd you see God
[1:08:07] as your deliverer you see God as your
[1:08:11] best friend you see God as your all and
[1:08:15] all then you come to understand like the
[1:08:18] scripture says your judgment
[1:08:22] is faithful it's true
[1:08:24] it's righteous
[1:08:26] because you've kept me out of Harm's Way
[1:08:29] is that right though you prepare the
[1:08:33] table before me in the presence of my
[1:08:35] enemy guess what he does he anoints my
[1:08:39] head with oil and my cup runs over what
[1:08:43] was he did he prepared you for the
[1:08:45] battle by giving you his anointing
[1:08:52] huh though I walked through the valley
[1:08:54] in the shadow of death I would fear no
[1:08:57] evil why because thou art with me is
[1:09:01] that what he said I'll never leave you
[1:09:03] nor will I forsake you as I said as a
[1:09:07] child when you spank a child they don't
[1:09:11] understand and they think you're being
[1:09:13] mean they think it's not necessary and
[1:09:16] maybe they think the punishment is too
[1:09:18] harsh
[1:09:20] but you got to understand
[1:09:22] that those spankings have been inspired
[1:09:25] because of love
[1:09:27] and when Mom and Daddy see you hanging
[1:09:30] around somebody that they know is not
[1:09:33] right
[1:09:34] they know it's going to have a bad
[1:09:35] influence on you guess what they're
[1:09:38] going to tell you if they're good
[1:09:39] parents you cannot be with that person
[1:09:44] that person cannot be your friend
[1:09:47] you understand me you might thought mama
[1:09:49] you don't know him like I know him yes
[1:09:52] he does
[1:09:53] daddy knows him too because one thing
[1:09:56] that God give parents just like he give
[1:09:58] animals discernment
[1:10:05] get Pastor some too
[1:10:09] and see what but but when you just like
[1:10:12] I told I was saying this to the church
[1:10:13] in Iowa City
[1:10:15] I did something really bad in my life
[1:10:17] one time
[1:10:18] one time
[1:10:20] and I got a I got a whooping
[1:10:23] wasn't a spanking
[1:10:24] it was a whooping
[1:10:26] and my mama had my sisters tie me down
[1:10:29] so I couldn't run
[1:10:31] and she gave it to me
[1:10:34] and when I got up I thought mama had
[1:10:36] been so mean
[1:10:37] so embarrassing it was so embarrassing
[1:10:39] I'm gonna go tell you the whole detail
[1:10:41] stuff
[1:10:42] but I'm telling you amen I put it this
[1:10:44] way my throat my clothing was so thin I
[1:10:46] felt every lick
[1:10:54] but you know what
[1:10:55] I grew up with a resentment
[1:10:58] I loved it but I resented her for that
[1:11:01] because my eyes was blind to what she
[1:11:04] was doing
[1:11:05] my mom didn't cut off a limb
[1:11:08] she uprooted the tree
[1:11:12] and that's what parents have to do
[1:11:14] sometime you know this no you got it you
[1:11:18] got to put it to him so you uproot the
[1:11:20] tree the power said you ain't gonna kill
[1:11:22] him it's Peter rods for the child
[1:11:26] beat him the Bible says
[1:11:29] you ain't gonna kill him what are you
[1:11:32] doing driving that nonsense away
[1:11:37] and when your child can see that you
[1:11:39] mean it and that you kind of have crazy
[1:11:41] they'll never do it again
[1:11:46] maybe y'all didn't get one like that but
[1:11:48] I did
[1:11:49] hmm
[1:11:51] now I'm saying all of these things
[1:11:53] because I'm reading these virtues these
[1:11:56] virtues are vital
[1:11:58] to the authority and Power
[1:12:01] because remember this nature is what
[1:12:04] Adam lost this is basically the title
[1:12:08] deed
[1:12:09] because the title D was Christ himself
[1:12:11] it was the nature it was the thing that
[1:12:13] covered Adam and Eve where they didn't
[1:12:15] know they were naked
[1:12:17] the virtues were there
[1:12:20] and because of the Fall it was taken
[1:12:23] away but because of Calvary it's been
[1:12:25] restored
[1:12:28] Hallelujah and when the lamb took the
[1:12:31] book remember
[1:12:32] these scriptures were always in the book
[1:12:36] but they could not be unfolded until the
[1:12:40] Malachi 4 came on the scene and he
[1:12:43] Hallelujah under that inspiration Eminem
[1:12:45] was able to bring a message the statue
[1:12:48] of a perfect man
[1:12:50] what was God bringing
[1:12:52] your way back
[1:12:54] to full Authority and Power
[1:12:58] but what's happening to us
[1:13:02] we're allowing the same demons
[1:13:05] that destroyed Israel in the in the
[1:13:07] wilderness
[1:13:09] destroy us
[1:13:11] the same demons that destroy Pentecost
[1:13:14] is now working among this message to
[1:13:17] destroy us
[1:13:19] what happened
[1:13:20] God was with Pentecost
[1:13:23] in a mighty way but you know what
[1:13:26] happened
[1:13:27] they got puffed up
[1:13:29] just like Israel they thought they were
[1:13:31] better than everybody else remember God
[1:13:34] worked with Israel but the moment she
[1:13:36] got puffed up and thought she was better
[1:13:38] than everybody else
[1:13:40] guess what happens when you become
[1:13:42] prideful the fall comes
[1:13:46] Hallelujah once you fail fall once you
[1:13:50] got to be careful you'll fall again what
[1:13:53] happens when you crack the glass
[1:13:56] ah you might be able to seal it but the
[1:13:59] grass glass is cracked
[1:14:01] if you drop it again it cracks more
[1:14:05] and what happens when it cracks the
[1:14:08] devil takes part of your nature
[1:14:11] remember when Adam and Eve fell he took
[1:14:14] everything
[1:14:17] and so every time you mess up without
[1:14:20] repentance
[1:14:22] Satan takes a part of you
[1:14:26] the good part
[1:14:28] because what happens when you mess up
[1:14:29] and you don't want to confess you begin
[1:14:31] to lie
[1:14:33] and when you lie you're still
[1:14:35] Hallelujah and when you lie you under
[1:14:38] the inspiration of Satan himself because
[1:14:41] he is the father of Lies
[1:14:44] oh somebody help me here
[1:14:48] see
[1:14:50] oh magnify the Lord with me we always
[1:14:54] sing that right
[1:14:55] we have no idea what we're saying most
[1:14:57] of the time
[1:14:59] but when we magnify the Lord we take we
[1:15:02] take the word
[1:15:03] that's in a in a state
[1:15:06] and literally from a natural state into
[1:15:08] a spiritual state
[1:15:10] see that's what Jesus did when Jesus
[1:15:12] came in his day the Pharisees and the
[1:15:15] sadduce seed had the word so scrupled up
[1:15:18] they couldn't even recognize him
[1:15:21] had they understood the scriptures they
[1:15:23] would have been able to identify John
[1:15:25] the Baptist
[1:15:26] and because they missed John the Baptist
[1:15:28] they missed Jesus
[1:15:30] somebody help me here
[1:15:32] see that's how it is with the
[1:15:34] Pentecostals they had it so scrupled up
[1:15:36] they missed the Elijah
[1:15:38] and because they missed the Elijah they
[1:15:41] would miss Jesus Christ himself
[1:15:45] so what did he have to what did Jesus
[1:15:47] come to do he came to magnify the Lord
[1:15:51] magnify the word you understand he came
[1:15:54] to put every man on the same level
[1:16:00] oh let me say that again
[1:16:11] amen
[1:16:12] thus if you break one law
[1:16:15] you guilty of them all
[1:16:19] let me read it for you Matthew 5.
[1:16:22] 21-28
[1:16:24] you have heard
[1:16:26] that it was said by them of all time
[1:16:30] thou shall not kill
[1:16:34] and whosoever shall kill shall be in
[1:16:38] danger of Judgment of the judgment
[1:16:40] but I say unto you
[1:16:42] that whosoever is angry with his brother
[1:16:47] Without a Cause shall be in danger of
[1:16:51] the what did he just do
[1:16:53] he took it to he took the Act of Killing
[1:16:58] to in the spiritual realm to show you
[1:17:01] every time you hate somebody you are a
[1:17:04] murderer
[1:17:06] that's the way God judges it
[1:17:12] and whosoever shall say hit to his
[1:17:15] brother Reika shall be danger of the
[1:17:18] counsel but whosoever shall say thou
[1:17:21] food shall be in danger Hell Fire and
[1:17:23] what are you saying you're talking to a
[1:17:25] creature of God and you're telling him
[1:17:28] he has an airhead
[1:17:30] he's empty
[1:17:32] a fool
[1:17:33] you ain't got no sense
[1:17:37] and when you do that you're judging
[1:17:39] yourself
[1:17:42] for a person to be foolish is one thing
[1:17:44] but to call them a fool
[1:17:46] is a different thing
[1:17:51] and that's the way we do each other
[1:17:53] even in the church we speak things that
[1:17:55] are negative to what our brothers and
[1:17:57] sisters not even knowing we're causing a
[1:17:59] change in the atmosphere in their lives
[1:18:02] when you curse that's why the Bible say
[1:18:03] curse not
[1:18:06] right
[1:18:08] bless and curse not
[1:18:12] you call somebody stupid do you know
[1:18:14] what you're doing
[1:18:16] you've forgotten who's in the house
[1:18:20] and when you are when you offend the
[1:18:23] least of these
[1:18:25] you've offended God
[1:18:28] that's why people don't understand why
[1:18:29] they they're lies I'm talking about
[1:18:31] message Believers I'm talking about
[1:18:32] people who call themselves Christians
[1:18:34] that's why they don't understand why
[1:18:35] their lives are so messed up
[1:18:38] simply by the way you judge each other
[1:18:41] and disrespect each other
[1:18:49] the Bible said you can't even pray he
[1:18:50] ain't gonna even give you a good answer
[1:18:53] therefore if I bring a gift to The Altar
[1:18:56] and they'll remember and that they're
[1:18:58] remembered that thy brother have ought
[1:19:00] against thee remember that your brother
[1:19:02] yeah that you've got to ought against
[1:19:04] the brother but you have a you your
[1:19:07] brother has all against thee lead there
[1:19:10] thy gift before the Altar and go thy way
[1:19:13] first be reconciled to the brother and
[1:19:16] then come and offer thy gift
[1:19:19] that means God don't care about all your
[1:19:21] screaming and hollering and oh
[1:19:22] Hallelujah God forgive me this if you
[1:19:24] got an ought against your brother your
[1:19:25] brother and you know your brother has it
[1:19:27] all against you you need to make it
[1:19:29] right
[1:19:31] agree with thine adversary quickly
[1:19:35] while Thou Art in the way with him lest
[1:19:38] at any time the adversary deliver thee
[1:19:41] to the judge and the judge delivery to
[1:19:44] the officer and thou be cast into prison
[1:19:46] do y'all understand what that means when
[1:19:49] you don't make it right right then it's
[1:19:52] hard to make it right later
[1:19:55] is that right when it comes to
[1:19:57] confessions if you don't confess right
[1:19:59] then it's very difficult to confess
[1:20:02] later
[1:20:03] the devil going to compound your problem
[1:20:06] and jail you up
[1:20:11] and you're gonna stay there till God
[1:20:12] have mercy why because you didn't have
[1:20:15] respect of his word
[1:20:17] that's what it is
[1:20:19] his word told you to do something but
[1:20:21] you don't have respect for his word to
[1:20:23] do it
[1:20:24] and that's God
[1:20:26] you're disrespecting God when you
[1:20:29] disrespect his word
[1:20:34] hmm
[1:20:36] verily I say unto thee Thou shalt no
[1:20:38] means come out this till thou hath paid
[1:20:40] the uttermost farthings we have heard
[1:20:44] that it was said by them of oh thou
[1:20:46] shall not commit adultery but I say unto
[1:20:50] you that thou that whosoever looketh on
[1:20:53] a woman to lust after her have commit
[1:20:55] adultery with her already in his heart
[1:20:57] what was Jesus doing he was taking all
[1:21:00] those laws that the Pharisee had
[1:21:04] beat the people down with imprison them
[1:21:07] with and basically would say you're the
[1:21:09] same
[1:21:10] you're on the same level
[1:21:13] because you might look like you're on
[1:21:14] the outside and you may have never done
[1:21:16] it but in your heart
[1:21:19] he said there's dead men bones you've
[1:21:22] committed these same acts in your heart
[1:21:25] that's why they couldn't stand Jesus
[1:21:29] because he he like John the Baptist he
[1:21:31] he he he made the he brought the ones
[1:21:34] from the valley lift him up and took
[1:21:36] those that were on the Mountaintop and
[1:21:37] brought him down put them on the same
[1:21:39] plane let me tell you something that's
[1:21:42] what Calvary does it puts you on the
[1:21:44] same plane God don't care if you're rich
[1:21:47] or poor you've got to repent you got to
[1:21:50] respect your word and you got to do
[1:21:52] right before God that's it
[1:21:56] you know you see things in the message
[1:21:58] and you see people all lifted up and
[1:22:00] puffed up and everything you know they I
[1:22:02] get in trouble because I don't pay them
[1:22:03] no attention
[1:22:05] they want me to
[1:22:07] you know gravel at their feet or
[1:22:09] something
[1:22:10] I don't do that kind of stuff
[1:22:12] and I want nobody else doing that to me
[1:22:14] I respect you as a minister
[1:22:16] you respect me
[1:22:18] right
[1:22:19] brother sister in Christ
[1:22:22] that's it
[1:22:23] but nobody Lords over me
[1:22:27] and you're not going to see me lording
[1:22:29] over you
[1:22:30] but I will preach the word
[1:22:32] and you need to let the word Lord over
[1:22:35] you
[1:22:37] nothing but the grace of God
[1:22:40] the Bible said what shall we say then
[1:22:42] shall we continue and send that Grace
[1:22:44] May about you know I'm bringing this to
[1:22:46] you you know why I am because you know
[1:22:49] what when you see that you're on the
[1:22:51] same plane
[1:22:53] it gives you Grace to have Grace
[1:22:58] then you don't judge somebody unjustly
[1:23:01] almost like what Jesus did they said
[1:23:03] kill her killer killer killer Jesus
[1:23:06] wrote in this I don't know what he wrote
[1:23:07] but I want to ask him one of those days
[1:23:09] what did you write in the sand you know
[1:23:11] what I mean
[1:23:13] he
[1:23:14] who's without sin anybody in here
[1:23:17] let him cast the first stone
[1:23:19] they all walked away
[1:23:24] and what we got to realize that there's
[1:23:26] none of us who we you know this is the
[1:23:28] house of judgment
[1:23:29] you come here to be judged by the word
[1:23:32] Hallelujah but we don't have our
[1:23:34] personal ideas and our personal way of
[1:23:37] judging each other
[1:23:39] because oftentimes when we judge one
[1:23:41] another we're just as guilty
[1:23:46] um
[1:23:47] how are we going to have love in this
[1:23:49] church
[1:23:50] if people won't forgive or you know they
[1:23:53] I'm come stuff way back they don't
[1:23:55] brought it all the way across the walls
[1:24:00] no it's true
[1:24:01] 20 years ago they did that to me
[1:24:05] 20 years
[1:24:08] five years
[1:24:11] not just over the waters in America
[1:24:14] oh when I went to that church they did
[1:24:17] that to me they did
[1:24:19] you still a baby
[1:24:22] grow up
[1:24:24] as the world said get over it
[1:24:28] because God has a way for you to get
[1:24:30] over it
[1:24:33] cast all your cares upon me is that the
[1:24:36] Bible
[1:24:37] cast all your cares upon him because he
[1:24:40] cares for you
[1:24:42] Hallelujah I always think about it
[1:24:46] when I get offended or something about
[1:24:47] it do something wrong with me I always
[1:24:49] say Lord I've never suffered like you
[1:24:53] and if you didn't hold a grudge why
[1:24:55] should I
[1:24:58] I don't have no enemies and they might
[1:25:01] be my enemies but I don't have any you
[1:25:03] know personally I don't have any enemies
[1:25:05] there's nobody I hate
[1:25:10] I can't make people believe that but God
[1:25:12] knows my heart
[1:25:15] I love everybody that I know of
[1:25:18] I do I really do who sometimes is
[1:25:20] misunderstood
[1:25:22] because correction comes in different
[1:25:25] ways
[1:25:26] but I can truly say that every time I've
[1:25:28] ever tried to correct somebody it was
[1:25:29] because of love I have never taken sides
[1:25:34] with anybody
[1:25:35] I've always tried to be led by the Holy
[1:25:38] Spirit
[1:25:40] God is my witness
[1:25:42] I'll Stand before God with that
[1:25:44] statement
[1:25:45] y'all understand what I'm saying you
[1:25:47] know what I I look at things and I says
[1:25:49] God have mercy because we we we all
[1:25:53] faulty there's nobody perfect in here
[1:25:59] you understand me I I think about my
[1:26:02] wife and I you know what has kept us
[1:26:04] together because we love each other
[1:26:07] I don't go around every day I love you I
[1:26:11] love you I don't need
[1:26:17] foreign
[1:26:19] my actions
[1:26:21] my being willing to stay
[1:26:24] it just if love can be seen if you're
[1:26:27] looking for it
[1:26:30] right
[1:26:32] so anyway let's move on that's how it is
[1:26:34] with God
[1:26:36] has already proven his love for you
[1:26:41] the Bible said one would even Dare To
[1:26:43] Die
[1:26:45] but he died
[1:26:49] God forbid
[1:26:50] how shall we that are dead and sin live
[1:26:53] any longer therein know ye not
[1:26:56] that so many of us as we're baptized
[1:26:59] into Jesus Christ were baptized into his
[1:27:02] what death now he's talking about the
[1:27:05] water baptism that's Holy Ghost baptism
[1:27:07] therefore we are buried with him by
[1:27:09] baptism into death that like as Christ
[1:27:12] was raised from the dead by the glory of
[1:27:15] the father how was he raised from the
[1:27:17] dead if that same spirit that was in
[1:27:21] Christ dwells in you as it quickened his
[1:27:25] body it will Quicken your moral body
[1:27:27] Hallelujah you die and his Spirit lives
[1:27:33] God's autumn the next thing and I I
[1:27:37] don't want to be too much longer I'm
[1:27:39] sorry God's order
[1:27:41] amen it's when when God always separate
[1:27:46] Darkness from light and that's where it
[1:27:48] hurts
[1:27:49] be separated from the world that's where
[1:27:52] it hurts
[1:27:54] God always separates the darkness from
[1:27:56] the light
[1:27:57] he started in Genesis and he's still
[1:28:00] doing it today
[1:28:01] is that right
[1:28:03] he says now why listen I read this quote
[1:28:05] the last time why does God call these
[1:28:08] churches his churches even though they
[1:28:11] are the false thine
[1:28:13] the truth of the matter is that they are
[1:28:16] Christians but they are not Christians
[1:28:19] of the spirit
[1:28:20] they are Christians of the flesh they
[1:28:23] are bearing the name in vain Mark 7 7
[1:28:28] says how be it in vain do they worship
[1:28:31] me teaching the doctrines the
[1:28:34] Commandment of men but indeed they are
[1:28:36] Christians for what else could they be
[1:28:39] let me tell y'all something if you come
[1:28:41] to a place in this message and you you
[1:28:44] don't believe in the Supernatural you're
[1:28:46] not a Christian
[1:28:47] and I don't mean just believing it it
[1:28:50] should be working in your life somewhere
[1:28:56] brother um
[1:28:59] Willie
[1:29:01] for white horse
[1:29:03] call me this the other day my wife was
[1:29:06] there we both prayed for it
[1:29:08] he had a had operation it was bleeding
[1:29:11] real bad he he takes me today
[1:29:14] completely healed
[1:29:17] eating food
[1:29:19] nothing they couldn't they did the scope
[1:29:22] thing couldn't find nothing but
[1:29:23] everything's healed
[1:29:26] daddy that was God
[1:29:28] and then God had my wife read a quote
[1:29:31] from Brother branham's healing
[1:29:34] healing thoughts just just it was just
[1:29:36] perfect
[1:29:40] and God healed the man our elderly man I
[1:29:43] said God don't take him
[1:29:45] I said they need him up there he's the
[1:29:47] only preacher
[1:29:50] that's kind of like in Alaska
[1:29:52] where the knights don't turn like ours
[1:29:54] do with the dicks it's yeah I was up
[1:29:57] there one time and never did get dark
[1:30:01] but you see when you pray and you pray
[1:30:04] because you want God's perfect will
[1:30:07] to be made manifest
[1:30:10] regardless of what it is
[1:30:13] in other words when when the enemy
[1:30:15] attacked my body I told the Lord I don't
[1:30:16] want to live just to be living I want to
[1:30:18] live if God if you can use me I want to
[1:30:21] be used by God
[1:30:23] right not not just to be here to be here
[1:30:26] I want to be used by I want him to use
[1:30:30] me while that while he can whatever it
[1:30:33] takes for him to to use me I want him to
[1:30:36] use me if you got to break me down to
[1:30:38] build me up I want him to use me
[1:30:41] you see what I'm saying I have no other
[1:30:44] desire
[1:30:45] other than to be used by God
[1:30:48] I'm gonna go ahead on the move move on
[1:30:50] with that see let me let me say it like
[1:30:52] this and so I'm gonna tell you
[1:30:55] remember in Genesis
[1:30:57] brother Branham said the Holy Spirit
[1:30:59] brewed upon the waters
[1:31:02] you remember that
[1:31:04] and then brother William said he's
[1:31:05] liking that as he may he was making love
[1:31:08] to the Earth
[1:31:09] to the Seas making love
[1:31:12] you see when the Holy Spirit comes in
[1:31:14] here you're supposed to make love with
[1:31:16] him
[1:31:17] you're not even supposed to let him go
[1:31:20] right you should try to you're supposed
[1:31:22] to contain him try to hold him but
[1:31:25] you'll never hold him if you fear the
[1:31:28] Holy Spirit and you just
[1:31:30] and then you're watching everybody else
[1:31:32] enjoy Jesus
[1:31:34] Hallelujah you know what I'm saying you
[1:31:37] know I love my sister Rachel I love when
[1:31:40] she goes oh however she does that
[1:31:44] because that's that anointing makes her
[1:31:46] do that
[1:31:50] and the anointing so supposed to bring
[1:31:52] some kind of reaction from you
[1:31:55] right if fire strikes you you're gonna
[1:31:58] like wow right there's a feeling with it
[1:32:01] but then you don't just let it go you
[1:32:04] keep moving with it
[1:32:06] and that's where the churches are
[1:32:08] failing
[1:32:09] the holy spirit will come in and we'll
[1:32:11] just let him come and go to song Eden
[1:32:13] and you know what that's why I try to
[1:32:15] tell you if you sing in a song the holy
[1:32:17] spirit is on there milk it
[1:32:19] work it
[1:32:21] until people are blessed
[1:32:23] y'all understand what I'm saying
[1:32:25] you just don't
[1:32:27] because you gotta list you don't cut it
[1:32:29] if he's pleased with that song Let It Be
[1:32:35] we took condition
[1:32:40] it doesn't matter whether it's slow or
[1:32:42] fast Jesus love them all
[1:32:47] you love the Lord
[1:32:49] he said brooding means making love
[1:32:53] and when the Holy Spirit make made love
[1:32:56] to the calcium in the potash and the
[1:32:58] petroleum on the earth and formed it
[1:33:00] together and made a human being out of
[1:33:03] it y'all hear what I'm saying these
[1:33:06] bodies was brewed over so these bodies
[1:33:09] wants it
[1:33:11] oh come on somebody have you ever felt
[1:33:14] the Holy Ghost and then you didn't want
[1:33:16] it
[1:33:17] no it's something about the Holy Spirit
[1:33:21] presence that makes you more more of him
[1:33:24] we ought to act like we want more of him
[1:33:28] Hallelujah
[1:33:30] yes sir if you tell you to jump if he
[1:33:32] tells you to run if he tells you to
[1:33:33] scream whatever do it don't you worry
[1:33:37] about nobody because he's brewing over
[1:33:39] you Hallelujah he's changing something
[1:33:42] in you
[1:33:43] he might just have you sitting there
[1:33:45] crying but don't you worry about it you
[1:33:48] keep crying
[1:33:50] whatever he's moving on you to do do it
[1:33:58] Hallelujah
[1:34:01] but it's not systematic
[1:34:04] is how he brings it
[1:34:07] you don't wait on somebody else
[1:34:09] you let go and let God have his way
[1:34:13] Hallelujah is that okay
[1:34:16] he said listen
[1:34:18] human being listen he said then he made
[1:34:20] me human beings out of it then in return
[1:34:22] as human beings recognize him and makes
[1:34:25] love back to him
[1:34:28] with the promise that he would raise us
[1:34:31] up in the last days what kind of a faith
[1:34:33] should we have all the fear is taken
[1:34:36] away
[1:34:37] right have y'all understand me when the
[1:34:40] Holy Ghost comes guess what happens fear
[1:34:42] leaves it's gone you're not even
[1:34:44] thinking about fear
[1:34:47] Hallelujah why could you could bury me
[1:34:50] in the sea but the trumpet will wake me
[1:34:53] no matter where how far what take place
[1:34:56] where we're going to come from the dust
[1:34:59] Hallelujah now improve with the with
[1:35:02] this God gave us the consolation that
[1:35:05] through the righteous Son of God who
[1:35:08] shed his blood I I never like to use
[1:35:11] that name split because split is a is an
[1:35:14] ancient uh and an accident he never
[1:35:18] accidentally done it he knowed what he
[1:35:20] was doing and he did it for a purpose
[1:35:23] and he shared his blood freely at
[1:35:25] Calvary giving his god-given blood and
[1:35:30] the reason that God required blood and
[1:35:32] the lamb was an atonement for making a
[1:35:35] perpetuation for our sins in the shadow
[1:35:37] of Shadow form but never could take away
[1:35:40] sin because the blood of animals
[1:35:43] couldn't atone for the sins of man it
[1:35:47] was only a type because the worshiper
[1:35:51] once purged would have no more sins or
[1:35:54] desires of sin in this case the
[1:35:57] worshiper once purged has no more desire
[1:36:00] of sin
[1:36:02] now let me go back to that
[1:36:04] see the Lambs the Bulls and the goats
[1:36:06] could not do it
[1:36:08] see what I'm saying
[1:36:10] but you see when the Lamb of God took
[1:36:12] the book
[1:36:13] you understand what's the real blood
[1:36:16] the real life the life of God himself
[1:36:20] was released in such a way to take away
[1:36:23] all sin
[1:36:25] that's why the prophet God said you
[1:36:27] justify you stand as though you've never
[1:36:29] seen sin in the first place but that
[1:36:31] only comes when you take in the blood
[1:36:35] not potential you really got the Holy
[1:36:38] Ghost
[1:36:39] Hallelujah
[1:36:43] one thing I know about dogs if you had
[1:36:45] them pinned up a long time and you let
[1:36:47] them loose
[1:36:49] it's gonna haul it'd be hard to get them
[1:36:51] back
[1:36:53] dogs know when they free
[1:36:56] they know when you open that gate and
[1:36:59] you don't close it quickly
[1:37:03] and sometimes you take all day trying to
[1:37:05] find them they run and while they're
[1:37:08] running they look like they're laughing
[1:37:12] so enjoying it
[1:37:14] right
[1:37:16] the truth of the matter is if you don't
[1:37:19] respect God if you don't respect this
[1:37:21] anointing he's not going to respect you
[1:37:24] either
[1:37:25] that's just all to it
[1:37:29] but when they come into the heart
[1:37:31] um let me let me come back here the same
[1:37:34] question settled with the Holy Ghost
[1:37:36] coming to the human heart it casts down
[1:37:39] reasoning it goes above our intelligence
[1:37:42] intellectual Affairs now today the
[1:37:44] reason so many of us up and downs things
[1:37:47] are entered uh religious people because
[1:37:50] there's an intellectual concept of
[1:37:52] Christ
[1:37:54] in other words it's in their mind and
[1:37:58] not in their heart
[1:38:00] see it they just mentally believe it
[1:38:03] and your Mentor will reason
[1:38:06] could it be so
[1:38:08] could Divine Healing be so could the
[1:38:11] baptism of the Holy Ghost be so
[1:38:13] now that's the intellectual reasoning
[1:38:16] but when that comes into the heart it's
[1:38:19] a faith it's a positive there's no
[1:38:23] question at all about it it's all
[1:38:26] settled forever it's in your heart
[1:38:29] your heart doesn't reason because it's
[1:38:33] the throne The Dwelling Place of the
[1:38:36] almighty God
[1:38:39] of the almighty in in the heart you
[1:38:42] understand me
[1:38:43] right so we say oh Lord have mercy
[1:38:48] you and I must understand by God's grace
[1:38:53] we're coming into uh
[1:38:56] I'm I'm close we're coming into a
[1:38:59] position because I finished our Sunday
[1:39:01] Lord's will or start on this uh as I
[1:39:05] said in the first service
[1:39:08] God's judgment
[1:39:10] has been so misunderstood
[1:39:13] but the Saints of old understood that
[1:39:18] now when it comes to job how would he
[1:39:22] you know he he knew he had done right he
[1:39:24] God called him perfect
[1:39:26] so job couldn't understand what was
[1:39:28] happening to him
[1:39:31] but one thing job understood that God
[1:39:34] was holy he was righteous God never real
[1:39:37] that God or gave him accused him of
[1:39:39] anything
[1:39:41] in fact job looked within himself and
[1:39:43] saw his faults
[1:39:46] even though God called him perfect
[1:39:50] he kept his integrity
[1:39:54] right
[1:39:55] and even he didn't understand he
[1:39:58] understood the judgments of God naked I
[1:40:01] came into the world naked I go back
[1:40:05] um
[1:40:06] the lord giveth and the lord taketh away
[1:40:09] blessed be the name of the Lord yeah you
[1:40:12] understand me that's the way a mature
[1:40:14] Christian thinks
[1:40:16] no matter what I go through blessed be
[1:40:19] the name of the Lord
[1:40:22] see it's it's it's something that pushes
[1:40:25] you into a mature see devil the devil
[1:40:27] can't get you when you mature
[1:40:31] he condemned you because but he can't oh
[1:40:33] he can't rock you he can't he can't
[1:40:34] overtake you that's why God said listen
[1:40:37] listen devil I got a good man here his
[1:40:39] name is job have you considered him I
[1:40:42] know him
[1:40:45] that's the way we want God we want God
[1:40:48] to know us
[1:40:50] know our breaking points
[1:40:53] if there be any
[1:40:56] the devil said no no no I I get him here
[1:40:59] you know cursing he'll curse you and no
[1:41:01] no
[1:41:03] God says no sign that won't happen I
[1:41:06] know him
[1:41:10] think about it
[1:41:12] do you think the judgments of God is Not
[1:41:14] righteous it doesn't seem like it always
[1:41:16] look good
[1:41:18] did you understand what God Did In The
[1:41:20] Days of Elijah
[1:41:21] and I said it ain't gonna rain till I
[1:41:23] call for it
[1:41:25] three and a half years of famine
[1:41:30] people were starving children dogs cats
[1:41:34] whatever everything was starving and
[1:41:36] dying
[1:41:38] but God had a purpose
[1:41:41] God had a purpose and Elijah was that
[1:41:44] purpose
[1:41:45] God was proving to Elijah no matter what
[1:41:48] the world is going through I'll take
[1:41:50] care of you
[1:41:53] amen when he ran out of food dead I
[1:41:57] don't know where the clothes were
[1:41:57] getting it from
[1:42:01] but God prepared a widow woman right you
[1:42:03] see what I'm saying God always makes his
[1:42:06] connection
[1:42:08] and never did you see Elijah amen rail
[1:42:11] against God
[1:42:14] he didn't say oh my why couldn't you
[1:42:17] have a loud dub to bring me the food
[1:42:21] no a raven a black bird well we a dirty
[1:42:25] one
[1:42:27] but you know every time I think about
[1:42:29] that kind of bird I say you know what
[1:42:30] God Sanctified that one
[1:42:34] God Sanctified that one
[1:42:39] you say what brother Brooks you think
[1:42:42] about Paul
[1:42:44] I think about all Paul said I've been
[1:42:46] Shipwrecked I've been dead three times
[1:42:48] and resurrected they don't beat me they
[1:42:50] don't did everything but I learned
[1:42:55] it's a teaching
[1:42:59] I learned to give thanks
[1:43:03] I learned to worship him I learned a man
[1:43:06] to to realize he's in control I'm just a
[1:43:10] soldier in the army of the Lord y'all
[1:43:12] understand me he he came to a
[1:43:14] realization oh because once you know him
[1:43:18] nothing can keep you away
[1:43:20] that's what Paul said who shall separate
[1:43:22] me
[1:43:24] huh famine tribulation persecution
[1:43:27] nothing
[1:43:28] nothing the devil can throw at me will
[1:43:31] separate me from the love of God I'm
[1:43:33] here to stay why because I'm one with
[1:43:37] him I'm a part of him and I know by the
[1:43:41] grace of God this message came to change
[1:43:43] me and he's changing me from glory to
[1:43:46] glory even now
[1:43:49] I expect this message to change me I
[1:43:52] can't change myself but I respect the
[1:43:55] word that God brought through Malachi
[1:43:57] for and because I respected God respects
[1:44:00] me hello when I listen to the message I
[1:44:04] listen to be changed
[1:44:11] hmm
[1:44:12] many a time me and those tapes have a
[1:44:15] crying party
[1:44:17] praying and whatever more I don't care
[1:44:19] what people say but I know it's still
[1:44:21] alive
[1:44:24] I believe in the fivefold ministry y'all
[1:44:27] believe we didn't find foreign
[1:44:28] absolutely
[1:44:30] but I'm gonna tell you something
[1:44:31] sometimes
[1:44:33] when there's no friends
[1:44:35] and family I click it on
[1:44:39] but before I click it on
[1:44:41] I asked God which one
[1:44:44] send me and sometimes I go to the word
[1:44:46] like that I said Lord I need
[1:44:48] encouragement give me a word for today
[1:44:50] he's never failed me
[1:44:56] never fail me
[1:44:59] Hallelujah
[1:45:02] I'm almost done
[1:45:04] oh Lord
[1:45:09] let's just leave it there
[1:45:12] what is he doing what does this message
[1:45:14] come to do
[1:45:17] came to give you a new song
[1:45:20] is that right when the Sears were
[1:45:22] opening Moses and all different ones
[1:45:25] sung a new song
[1:45:27] when they came out of Egypt you think
[1:45:29] there was a whoa what they would kind of
[1:45:31] song they were singing Under slavery
[1:45:34] no they were free
[1:45:36] they come out singing a new song
[1:45:39] thank God I am free I don't know whether
[1:45:42] that was the one or not
[1:45:44] but I guarantee you it has something
[1:45:46] going on like that
[1:45:48] and here we come out of organizations
[1:45:50] and nominations and we have no idea some
[1:45:54] of us how free God is where God has
[1:45:56] brought us
[1:45:58] brought us to a freedom
[1:46:01] where there are no laws
[1:46:04] but love
[1:46:07] is that right that's the law
[1:46:10] we're in the age of the law of love
[1:46:14] Divine love I ain't talking about that
[1:46:17] mushy stuff that everybody else think is
[1:46:18] love now amen you can see how perverted
[1:46:21] that gotten because Hollywood is
[1:46:22] perverted to the uttermost
[1:46:25] but uh real Divine love
[1:46:32] don't even know why you know when you
[1:46:34] love somebody you don't even know why
[1:46:36] you love them you just love them
[1:46:39] something happened to me today
[1:46:41] I was coming just coming home from the
[1:46:44] church here I was down here earlier and
[1:46:46] I'm closing
[1:46:47] I went by uh
[1:46:49] the gas station I had to go by the
[1:46:51] teller because I needed to go pay a bill
[1:46:54] I come out and this guy with his hair
[1:46:57] all
[1:46:58] Woolly and
[1:47:00] looking rough and dirty
[1:47:03] however you want to say it he was he
[1:47:05] didn't smell bad because I got close up
[1:47:07] to him later
[1:47:08] but what happened he was saying Hey sir
[1:47:10] Hey sir I said I can't help you I can't
[1:47:12] help you
[1:47:15] I didn't know whether he's coming to mug
[1:47:17] me
[1:47:19] but he was coming to do he looked pretty
[1:47:20] rough
[1:47:22] oh my God
[1:47:25] the Lord is faithful
[1:47:28] I didn't even get to the red light
[1:47:29] before God convicted me
[1:47:34] I got on the highway and I had to turn
[1:47:36] all the way back around I said oh Lord
[1:47:38] please let him be there
[1:47:41] so when he came I I looked for him and
[1:47:44] didn't see me then all of a sudden he
[1:47:45] came out of the store I said hey hey hey
[1:47:48] come here come come
[1:47:50] I said I am so sorry sir I didn't even
[1:47:53] listen to what you had to say
[1:47:57] I said I do apologize I said I feel bad
[1:48:00] I I cut you off I didn't even listen to
[1:48:02] what I didn't even pay and all I could
[1:48:04] think about was God doing me like that
[1:48:07] that's all I could think about oh God
[1:48:09] have mercy on me and so
[1:48:13] I said what you needed what you needed
[1:48:15] he said oh I needed some gas in my car I
[1:48:17] said I'll fill it up for you right now
[1:48:19] he said no somebody else did it for me
[1:48:21] he said but thank you for coming around
[1:48:23] God bless you God bless you I said here
[1:48:25] here's twenty dollars
[1:48:29] I said here's some extra change he said
[1:48:32] thank you thank you thank you thank you
[1:48:33] God bless you he was a Christian
[1:48:38] you know you just never know
[1:48:41] who are you talking to
[1:48:45] and we're so quick to judge the outside
[1:48:49] and I was guilty as guilty you guys
[1:48:51] could be
[1:48:53] but what a powerful blessing God
[1:48:56] gave to me and all I could think about
[1:48:58] was all of the people that helped me I'm
[1:49:00] seeing all my flashes everything was
[1:49:03] moving through my mind I felt so small
[1:49:06] and right now as that talk I steal heavy
[1:49:09] on my heart because I fell
[1:49:11] but I corrected my failure
[1:49:14] but it's something that I'll never ever
[1:49:17] forget
[1:49:19] and that is I'll never do that again by
[1:49:22] God's help in his grace
[1:49:24] turn the man down without hearing what
[1:49:26] they have to say
[1:49:29] it was a lesson for me
[1:49:33] but it was a good lesson
[1:49:37] because all I could think about was how
[1:49:39] many times God has heard me
[1:49:42] never turned me down once
[1:49:49] see love goes beyond the church building
[1:49:53] love love the unlovable
[1:49:57] and I don't know what all that had to do
[1:50:00] with that guy but I just know what it
[1:50:01] did for me
[1:50:03] and you know what it felt so good
[1:50:05] God conviction you know you mean that
[1:50:08] that burden that heavy thing get on your
[1:50:10] heart and you got to go back and make it
[1:50:12] right see that's that's the Holy Ghost
[1:50:15] In You
[1:50:17] we love the Lord
[1:50:20] I'm so thankful for how he's teaching me
[1:50:23] that was the Judgment of the Lord
[1:50:25] you understand the very thing I'm
[1:50:27] preaching I had to go through something
[1:50:29] like that and
[1:50:32] but I made it right with him and and the
[1:50:35] young man that's dead he said all I
[1:50:38] wanted to do is have some money so I can
